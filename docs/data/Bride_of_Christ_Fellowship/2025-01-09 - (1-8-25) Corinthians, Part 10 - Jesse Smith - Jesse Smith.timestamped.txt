[2:04] I do have a few slides here by God's
[2:08] grace hopefully this will work I know
[2:10] the iPad didn't work on Sunday maybe the
[2:13] laptop will work
[2:15] here okay well Glory all right we're at
[2:18] part 10 here by God's grace in chapter
[2:20] six so averaging about maybe two sermons
[2:23] per chapter here by God's grace so um
[2:26] this chapter is outlined by scoffield CI
[2:28] scoffield here uh the first eight verses
[2:30] are the Saints forbidden to go to law
[2:33] against each other and then verses 9- 20
[2:36] is the sanctity of the body and marriage
[2:40] Hallelujah now in our outline this is of
[2:43] course uh Scofield's outline of the
[2:44] entire book all 16 chapters we're on
[2:46] this uh fourth section here we've done
[2:48] the introduction the Believers standing
[2:50] in Grace uh and their carnal divided
[2:53] condition about their favorite preachers
[2:56] and then dealing with sexual immorality
[2:58] the brother sleeping with his step uh
[3:00] mother and then uh we're looking at here
[3:03] we're kind of starting that and then
[3:04] we'll hopefully get to the sanctity of
[3:06] the body and marriage by the grace of
[3:08] God then you get into Christian
[3:09] Liberties for a number of or three
[3:10] chapters and then the headship in the
[3:12] Lord's Supper which how many enjoyed the
[3:14] Lord's Supper on Sunday praise God when
[3:15] that a beautiful time in the Lord
[3:17] hallelujah I love renewing my vows to
[3:19] the Lord hallelujah talking it over with
[3:20] Jesus the spiritual gifts and charity
[3:23] and then uh the resurrections because
[3:25] there's more than one Resurrection
[3:27] Hallelujah closing instrument I'm sorry
[3:29] instruction and greetings so tonight you
[3:31] know we we've kind of preached through
[3:33] these first two uh areas uh Paul knew
[3:37] they needed a more excellent way this
[3:38] was a church with a lot of trouble yes
[3:40] they had a lot of tongues a lot of
[3:42] interpretation a lot of Miracles they
[3:45] had so many tongues interpretation Paul
[3:46] said just now limit it to three now you
[3:49] got everybody wants to say something
[3:50] every wants to do something everybody's
[3:51] got a gift in time he said but just do
[3:53] three now when you're gathered together
[3:55] and if you don't have the interpretation
[3:56] just save your tongues for home right
[3:58] you had to set it online because they
[4:00] had so much going on which is one is is
[4:03] good in one way as it's led by the Holy
[4:04] Spirit uh but it's got to be in order he
[4:07] said God's a god of order praise God and
[4:09] so uh we looked at how they had
[4:11] divisions amongst themselves and then
[4:13] the sexual morality they weren't sad
[4:15] about it they had not mourned about it
[4:17] um and they needed to mourn about sexual
[4:19] sin it was leaven in the church and I
[4:21] would argue uh not in a mean way but I'd
[4:24] argue in a in just a scriptural way that
[4:25] all these are forms of Leaven uh because
[4:28] they're sin it's it's dis disorder it's
[4:30] disrespect it's confusion all these
[4:32] things uh lust of the eyes lust of the
[4:35] flesh pride of life uh and then uh so
[4:38] tonight we'll get to how uh they sue
[4:40] each other the the the Christians here
[4:41] in this church were actually going to
[4:43] court against one another uh and then
[4:47] you know we saw we'll see how uh they
[4:49] battled drunkenness uh at the Lord's
[4:52] Supper so you know we came to we came to
[4:54] church on Sunday for for communion and
[4:56] nobody was drunk on the natural wine
[4:58] Hallelujah but you're welcome to get
[5:00] drunk on the Holy Ghost Hallelujah you
[5:02] might shout praise God you might cry you
[5:04] might weep you might dance you might
[5:05] scream you might whatever you're going
[5:07] to do you're going to give God glory
[5:08] Hallelujah because on the day of
[5:10] Pentecost they they were declaring the
[5:12] wonderful works of God look what God has
[5:14] done Jesus Christ is alive God sent his
[5:16] son he's raised from the dead he sent
[5:18] his holy spirit to his people hallelujah
[5:20] they were just declaring all the
[5:22] wonderful things God had done hallelujah
[5:24] so let's have a drink tonight of this
[5:25] the great Holy Spirit praise God
[5:27] hallelujah and then uh they were AR or
[5:30] they were uh dividing themselves by
[5:32] finances who had more money than others
[5:34] and the rich would to eat with the poor
[5:36] and so forth and then their gifts were
[5:38] out of order no interpretation causing
[5:40] confusion he said it's like Barbarians
[5:42] in here people are speaking in tongues
[5:44] and no one knows what's being said it's
[5:46] it's like there's barbarians around here
[5:48] so we got drunken people we got sexual
[5:50] immorality we got bar barbarians we got
[5:52] all these things in one Church what a
[5:55] church I said what a church that needs
[5:58] some cleaning Hallelujah brother Bram
[6:00] said brother BR said the gifts were to
[6:01] keep the church clean Hallelujah so if
[6:03] they could get the if they could get the
[6:05] gifts in order it would clean out the
[6:07] church Hallelujah and then uh they were
[6:09] lacking generosity Paul said none of you
[6:11] gave me anything when I was struggling
[6:13] it was all the church at Philippi gave
[6:15] gave me to my need so they weren't even
[6:17] generous you had rich people in there
[6:19] that weren't generous arguing about
[6:21] who's the greatest preacher rich people
[6:22] suing the poor people or rich people s
[6:24] suing rich people this was a book of
[6:27] Acts Church we'd say remember Paul said
[6:29] Paul was told by Jesus you have much PE
[6:31] I have much people in this
[6:33] city so this shows this is a really
[6:36] young church right they were really
[6:37] young immature but there many of them
[6:40] were Believers Paul said so but many of
[6:43] you are sick and weakly and dead because
[6:45] you haven't judge each other so I wonder
[6:47] what some of them died for maybe suing
[6:48] other people maybe having sexual
[6:51] immorality uh maybe being prideful about
[6:53] their Financial State I mean these were
[6:55] all things that were were still
[6:57] currently existing after many were weak
[6:59] and sickly and basically had brought a
[7:01] temporary curse upon themselves so what
[7:04] what an interesting church this is we we
[7:06] say that that that's saying the least
[7:08] and then they they would allow all these
[7:10] false preachers to come in and Paul in
[7:12] the second letter my wife was reading it
[7:13] this week too in the second letter Paul
[7:15] has to go through listen I'm a real
[7:17] saint of God look at my resume H how how
[7:20] how can I not be a true servant of God
[7:22] and Paul's trying to open up their eyes
[7:23] say I'm the true servant these guys are
[7:25] the fake ones they're not under
[7:27] persecution they're not suffering for
[7:28] being a Christian all that live Godly in
[7:30] Christ Jesus shall suffer
[7:33] persecution just this week I was called
[7:35] Cain on an email I was called Kan Kane I
[7:40] was called a
[7:42] knead on a on a sermon I was called now
[7:44] they didn't call my name but they
[7:46] referenced my videos I made they call me
[7:47] a knead they call me a knowitall uh I'm
[7:50] telling brother BR I have a greater
[7:51] Revelation than brother brandham I'm
[7:52] wasting your time and my time just this
[7:56] week what has the last 10 years been
[8:00] all that live Godly in Christ Jesus
[8:02] shall suffer persecution praise God that
[8:04] was just this week that's actually not a
[8:06] bad week actually I've been caught a lot
[8:08] worse things than
[8:09] that verse one dare any of you now dare
[8:13] in our in our language means to express
[8:15] shock so Paul's saying I'm shocked at
[8:17] any of you having a matter against
[8:20] another you would go to law before the
[8:23] unjust and not before the Saints now
[8:26] courts in those days were not the same
[8:28] as today today you file in this room and
[8:30] yeah there might have TV cameras on
[8:31] there but not mostly for People Like Us
[8:34] in those days though courts were out in
[8:35] the public and people came to watch the
[8:39] Roman government invited them to come
[8:41] because it showed their power and
[8:42] authority especially with
[8:44] crucifixion uh you know a Roman citizen
[8:46] could never be crucified that's how bad
[8:48] the crucifixion was it was such an awful
[8:51] death it was the worst death of course
[8:53] we know our Lord had to die that way to
[8:55] save us hallelujah thank God Amen but
[8:58] they were public shows and and they were
[9:00] uh they were designed to be
[9:02] entertainment you've seen the Roman
[9:04] Coliseum where they're entertained with
[9:06] uh humans uh fighting lions and bears
[9:08] and all kinds of animals you You' heard
[9:09] things about that this was their form of
[9:12] of teasing people mocking people making
[9:14] fun of people and Paul said how dare you
[9:17] take another Christian to the
[9:19] court Hallelujah and not before the
[9:22] Saints so he said you have a courtroom
[9:24] he said but it's the house of God
[9:27] hallelujah amen not out there with us
[9:29] the the sinful public but it's with the
[9:31] Church of the Living God that's your
[9:33] court that's where we going to get a
[9:35] real Fair court trial hallelujah it's
[9:37] simply not an option for us some of you
[9:39] probably reading my notes going on you
[9:40] know the uh the closest thing I've heard
[9:42] was in 2001 when uh brother Donnie
[9:45] Reagan from uh Johnson City Tennessee
[9:47] had said voice of God that's the company
[9:49] uh that prints brother Ram sermons on
[9:52] book and makes copies and translates
[9:54] brother bam sermons for other countries
[9:55] they threatened to sue his church and
[9:57] any other churches who are making their
[9:59] own copies of brother brandom's sermons
[10:02] which was a bunch of nonsense but
[10:04] eventually they stopped their threats
[10:06] they sent letters through lawyers saying
[10:08] don't you copy anymore and brother
[10:10] Donnie was just bringing out this
[10:12] scripture Paul dared them how dare you
[10:16] he in other words expressing shock and
[10:17] disdain that proves What Spirit these
[10:20] people are under if they're claiming the
[10:22] name of Christ and suing Christ's
[10:25] children in front of Sinners that's the
[10:28] whole point here in front of of
[10:30] Sinners it it's it's uh and Paul's
[10:33] saying if you're going to have a a
[10:34] dispute yes we're going to have them
[10:36] I'll show that in the next few slides
[10:37] here we're going to have them but if
[10:39] we're going to have them let's keep it
[10:40] in house
[10:44] Hallelujah so Church Believers have
[10:46] always had disagreements it's just part
[10:48] of the Christian experience if you
[10:50] haven't yet you haven't been a Christian
[10:51] long
[10:52] enough Hallelujah like I said you want
[10:56] to see Miracles hang around you want to
[10:58] see dis disputes hang
[11:00] around you're going to see him by God's
[11:02] grace because that's that's just human
[11:04] nature we're partly human and we have a
[11:06] little portion of God's divine nature
[11:09] Hallelujah a measure Jesus had the Holy
[11:12] Ghost without measure in other words the
[11:13] full all the power all the authority uh
[11:16] the the full obedience to God but we've
[11:18] got it in a
[11:19] measure so we've got measures of us that
[11:22] don't have the Holy Ghost Hallelujah
[11:24] your flesh really don't have the Holy
[11:26] Ghost it might have it for a few moments
[11:28] or maybe hours while you're praying or
[11:30] dancing or walking in the spirit
[11:32] rejoicing or something like that but
[11:34] eventually that anointing lifts
[11:37] Hallelujah and then you uh begin to feel
[11:39] like a human
[11:40] again but Abraham and lot Abraham was
[11:43] much uh more dedicated than lot brother
[11:45] Abraham called Abraham like a silver
[11:47] dollar lot was like a penny Hallelujah
[11:50] but there was disagreements with their
[11:51] herdsmen so how they solve it look the
[11:54] gentleman stepped in Abraham as
[11:56] gentleman says stepped in you take the
[11:58] choice I'm even though I'm older I'm
[12:01] your uncle I'll give you the choice to
[12:03] take whichever land you want what a
[12:05] Christian gentleman that was not
[12:07] demanding his own way it's got to be my
[12:09] way it's got to be my way he walked in
[12:11] there with humility said you take your
[12:14] choice Hallelujah and what he made the
[12:17] wrong choice it led to the death of many
[12:19] of his family members including his wife
[12:21] made the wrong choice he based upon what
[12:23] he saw with his eyes not what he knew in
[12:25] his heart am he should have known in his
[12:28] heart he was saved eventually but he
[12:29] should have known in his heart that he
[12:31] was going to his family was going to get
[12:32] captured by the cares of this
[12:34] world but he didn't have enough wisdom
[12:36] and understanding again he wasn't as
[12:37] spiritual as Abraham Moses and Jethro
[12:40] Moses like I spend all my time with
[12:41] these arguments and disputes Jethro said
[12:44] give all the easy ones to the the these
[12:47] other 70 and you just handle the big
[12:51] ones so that means we're going to have
[12:53] little disputes in our church and we're
[12:54] going to have big disputes in our church
[12:55] brother rod have you ever seen a dispute
[12:57] in a
[12:58] church he's been a Christian his whole
[13:01] life I was raised in the church and I've
[13:03] seen disputes in every church I've been
[13:05] there's always a dispute somewhere it's
[13:07] just human nature but we got to let the
[13:09] divine nature decide who's right and
[13:11] wrong
[13:12] hallelujah amen remember Paul says in
[13:15] later in this letter he said heresies
[13:17] have to arise to prove who's the true
[13:20] Servants of
[13:21] God but now if both if both so if
[13:24] there's a dispute in the church and one
[13:26] person's wrong and they humble
[13:27] themselves or repent well then they're
[13:28] not a heritage anymore you know they're
[13:30] they're just corrected they're just now
[13:33] more mature if they keep a good attitude
[13:36] toward it Hallelujah and the whole Book
[13:39] of Judges what is that about we need
[13:40] judges we don't have a prophet to judge
[13:42] here Moses has passed on Joshua's dead
[13:44] we need judges to judge all our
[13:48] disputes remember Absalon stole the
[13:51] hearts of the Israelis on their way in
[13:53] to get judged by David he stole their
[13:57] hearts and the first murmuring in the
[13:59] book of Acts in chapter 6 when the
[14:01] Grecian widows were were complaining
[14:03] we're not getting food like the Hebrew
[14:05] women what's wrong with us we're not
[14:08] we're not Jews something wrong with us
[14:10] and they're complaining and so uh uh
[14:12] they tell them okay now develop some
[14:14] deacons let's make sure everybody gets
[14:16] fed Hallelujah find me some Holy Ghost
[14:18] filled men and women that's what we need
[14:20] today amen now deacons are only men but
[14:22] today let's have Holy Ghost fill men and
[14:24] women that will solve the church's
[14:25] problems Hal Hallelujah right that'll
[14:27] solve the complaining the murmuring the
[14:29] backbiting whatever it is that will
[14:31] solve the problem get people that have
[14:33] the Holy Ghost
[14:34] hallelujah amen that's right Church you
[14:37] know that's right Hallelujah dare any of
[14:40] you he says so Paul recommends go before
[14:42] the Saints with disputes rather than the
[14:45] unjust why go before the unjust which
[14:47] are unrighteous sinful deceitful
[14:51] people why would you go take two
[14:54] Christians Saved By Grace washed in the
[14:55] blood and stand before someone who's not
[14:57] washed in the blood
[14:59] and it's likely not all the time but
[15:02] likely filled with demon powers look
[15:05] what these judges have done to Donald
[15:06] Trump and all these conservant they're
[15:07] filled with demon
[15:09] powers Hallelujah because they don't
[15:12] rule justly if they don't do the truth
[15:15] they're filled with demons of Lies lying
[15:18] Spirits so Paul said why would you do
[15:21] that go stand before uh unrighteous
[15:24] deceitful
[15:26] judges he said don't you know that the
[15:28] Saints will judge the world why would
[15:31] you go outside the church why would you
[15:33] go out to the world when you're going to
[15:34] judge them you're asking the world to
[15:36] judge you no it's tot it's totally
[15:39] backwards you're judging the world
[15:42] Hallelujah is that
[15:44] right you're judging the world why would
[15:46] you go out to the world to be judged
[15:49] you're going to judge
[15:51] them and if the world shall be judged by
[15:53] you are you unworthy to judge the
[15:56] smallest matters so see someone who's
[15:58] got the Holy Ghost they can judge the
[15:59] big issues these big things like we saw
[16:02] fornication and drunkenness but even
[16:04] down to little small disputes amongst
[16:06] Brethren oh this person hurt my feelings
[16:08] this person well okay well let's talk
[16:12] about
[16:13] it right why keep a spirit of bitterness
[16:16] and resentment it's just a small little
[16:19] thing why why keep an e why let an evil
[16:22] spirit get in there surely we can judge
[16:24] if we got the Holy Ghost we can judge
[16:25] who's got a good spirit who's got a
[16:27] wrong Spirit just give him the word test
[16:29] that's what we find out every time in
[16:31] other words like like the Bible said uh
[16:33] if you're going to come against a pastor
[16:34] you got to have two or three Witnesses
[16:36] like it's got to be clear it's got to be
[16:38] so simple okay yes the pastor broke the
[16:41] broke the word here right but if not
[16:43] it's just an evil spirit on the other
[16:45] person it's a critical spirit and you
[16:48] got to say God forgive me I'm guilty of
[16:50] having a critical spirit forgive me wash
[16:52] me and give and renewing me creating me
[16:54] a clean heart renew a right Spirit
[16:56] Within Me Hallelujah but so hard amongst
[16:59] people even Christians sometimes it's so
[17:01] hard against them but we should be able
[17:03] to judge small little things and then
[17:05] big huge things like marriage and
[17:07] divorce that's a big one that's a real
[17:10] big one Hallelujah all these huge
[17:15] matters uh who's qualified to preach
[17:17] who's qualified uh to song Lead who's
[17:20] qualified to be a musician who's
[17:22] qualified to hold offices these are
[17:24] bigger things right who's qualified to
[17:26] be a deacon
[17:29] uh we're accusing a deacon of some wrong
[17:30] now that's a big thing because the
[17:33] deacons are ordained of God in the book
[17:34] of Acts and Paul lays out here's what a
[17:37] a bishop needs a pastor here's what a uh
[17:40] here's all the qualifications for a
[17:42] deacon there's no qualifications in the
[17:44] Bible for a song leader so those aren't
[17:47] as as more severe or a a piano player or
[17:51] a organ player or a drum player
[17:53] everybody with me there there's no
[17:55] requirements for that those are smaller
[17:57] matters but God said if you can judge
[17:59] the big things you can judge the Small
[18:00] Things
[18:02] hallelujah
[18:04] amen so's no no question church at all
[18:07] you will judge the world Hallelujah the
[18:10] ninevites testimonies and the queen of
[18:12] the South testimony will judge those
[18:15] self-righteous legalistic Pharisees and
[18:18] through the Holy Ghost we can judge the
[18:21] smallest and the largest issues now some
[18:24] people will have more judgment than you
[18:26] could even have more judgment than the
[18:28] pastor really because it's called the
[18:30] there different gifts gifts of
[18:32] discernment so someone could have a
[18:34] greater gift of discernment let's say uh
[18:36] two talents of discernment let's say the
[18:38] pastor might just have one Talent of
[18:39] discernment well he still got
[18:41] some right now I hope as a pastor I hope
[18:43] my discernment is higher than others you
[18:45] know at least most people but that's the
[18:48] point like you know we God has all these
[18:50] gifts out there God wants to use all the
[18:52] gifts discernment means to judge judge
[18:55] the spirit does this come from God or
[18:57] does this come from the wicked one
[18:59] amen hallelujah so if we have the Holy
[19:01] Ghost and we get in the mind of Christ
[19:03] then surely God will show us what to do
[19:05] I was reminded this week did you know
[19:07] before uh George Washington and all the
[19:10] founding fathers do you know before they
[19:11] started the war did you know they prayed
[19:13] for hours before they would start their
[19:15] meetings hours like two or three hours
[19:18] and they did that for years before
[19:20] deciding to go to war and yet we'll make
[19:23] a decision about something big something
[19:24] big in our lives maybe a job or maybe
[19:26] marriage or something and we'll just
[19:27] make a quick decision like that and we
[19:30] don't even really realize have we put
[19:32] enough have we really given God time to
[19:34] get uh to speak to us to get past all of
[19:37] our own feelings and ideas and opinions
[19:39] in other words if we want to draw close
[19:41] to God we got to be sincere Hallelujah
[19:44] we got to keep the feast with sincerity
[19:46] and truth hallelujah now just share this
[19:49] I dated and then courted my wife for
[19:50] four years before or four and a half
[19:52] years before I proposed so see I God had
[19:55] gave me time to know to marry the right
[19:57] one so see what you got to do
[20:02] buddy see what you got to do
[20:05] brother when that time comes buddy you
[20:09] better pray now I'm not saying God can't
[20:10] do something quick God can't do
[20:11] something quick I'm just saying you you
[20:13] know in that in that area of my life God
[20:16] uh dealt with me for years years and I
[20:19] ask God for signs is she the one God
[20:20] always give me a sign
[20:22] hallelujah hallelujah right darling
[20:25] hopefully she got a sign too
[20:28] now your life the current life you live
[20:30] right now the way you live your life is
[20:32] a either a a blessing to others or it
[20:35] condemns the unbeliever because Noah
[20:38] moved with fear his building the ark
[20:42] condemned the world so what I'm saying
[20:45] right now yes you'll judge Angels later
[20:47] yes you'll judge the world later but
[20:48] you're actually judging others right now
[20:51] Hallelujah kind of
[20:53] indirectly the way you live your life
[20:55] judges all these other people all these
[20:57] people say they want to go in the
[20:58] Rapture well are they making themselves
[20:59] ready right it's just like Noah you want
[21:02] to be saved from the flood to come you
[21:04] want to be saved from the tribulation to
[21:05] come you better work like Noah worked
[21:07] Hallelujah we better put time into the
[21:09] word put time into prayer put time into
[21:12] the studying the word of God hearing the
[21:14] voice of God knowing the spirit of God
[21:17] Hallelujah Jesus said watch and pray
[21:19] that you be counted worthy to escape all
[21:21] these judgments that shall come upon the
[21:23] face of the Earth have we given God a
[21:25] worthy time to deal with our hearts to
[21:27] clean out our lives lives to wash us By
[21:30] the Waters of the word
[21:32] hallelujah now that's the question are
[21:34] we washed as thoroughly as we can be God
[21:37] again God's not asking for everyday
[21:39] Perfection but God's asking uh will you
[21:41] let him wash away all bad remaining
[21:44] habits and live Victorious over the
[21:48] devil
[21:51] Hallelujah and there's the anointing
[21:53] again I'm going to reference this just a
[21:54] moment this is the anointing to this
[21:56] breaks every Yoke the anointing breaks
[21:57] the yoke right so the anointing of Faith
[22:00] breaks the Yoke virtue breaks the Yoke
[22:02] of all these other sins I'm going to go
[22:03] through them at the end that's that's
[22:05] how this that that's how the anointing
[22:07] God builds you up strong this way and
[22:09] then caps you seals you off finishes you
[22:11] off with the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[22:13] love God is love amen the Holy Ghost is
[22:15] God hallelujah amen it's a mystery Paul
[22:19] said it's a mystery hidden from ages
[22:20] Christ in you the hope of Glory
[22:23] Hallelujah so see your current obedience
[22:25] to the message of the hour what God is
[22:27] revealing right now brother ab's
[22:28] Ministry it already condemns the
[22:31] unbeliever you sisters when you walk
[22:33] around those skirts it condemns those
[22:35] women that know better that are wearing
[22:37] pants and
[22:38] shorts or those young girls that wear
[22:41] the slits the young teenage girls that
[22:43] wear slits and the sister said that's
[22:46] right that's right hallelujah or the
[22:48] sister I walk around in high heels yeah
[22:50] I'm a message believer walking around in
[22:52] high heels
[22:54] nonsense you wouldn't do that if you had
[22:56] the Holy Ghost Hallelujah wouldn't off
[22:58] your body you wouldn't make yourself
[22:59] body look like that you wouldn't do that
[23:01] you know it's not natural God calls us
[23:04] to be natural the way God made us
[23:05] hallelujah not made to do those things
[23:09] so see your life sisters when you dress
[23:10] that way Malachi when you dress when you
[23:12] guys get dressed Godly mercy and all
[23:14] these brothers that's what you do you're
[23:16] condemning the World by your actions
[23:19] that's why a lot of times they don't
[23:20] like you because you're your life
[23:23] condemns them Hallelujah that's
[23:27] right what did Jesus say the men of
[23:29] ninev will rise in judgment against you
[23:31] shall judge the world right so the men
[23:33] of nin will rise up and they'll condemn
[23:36] the
[23:38] Pharisees that was uh 600 something
[23:40] years before the Pharisees 600 700 years
[23:43] when the men of Nineveh repented at the
[23:44] preaching Jon it might have been 500 I
[23:46] can't quite remember but it was course
[23:48] it was uh hundreds of years before
[23:50] because they repented at preaching you
[23:54] know what God's looking for tonight
[23:55] somebody to repent by the preaching of
[23:57] the word
[23:59] if someone's living in sin and hasn't
[24:00] confessed their sin God wants you to
[24:02] repent tonight Hallelujah and if you do
[24:05] God will say I receive you if you don't
[24:07] God will say you better repent
[24:09] soon or you'll get judged right or you
[24:12] be
[24:13] condemned because the men of Nineveh
[24:15] just heard Jonah say you got three days
[24:18] I'm sorry 40 days right was it 40 days
[24:20] 40 days sorry you got 40 days or God's
[24:22] going to destroy this place and they got
[24:24] to business seeking God hallelujah
[24:27] that's right the of the South she'll
[24:29] condemn all these Pharisees
[24:31] self-righteous legalistic Pharisees
[24:33] because she came from the uttermost
[24:34] parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of
[24:36] Solomon Hallelujah now I've read these
[24:39] before so if you repent sincerely after
[24:42] preaching it makes you worthy to judge
[24:45] others church and I know that's true
[24:47] even in our church if you and I Repent
[24:49] our church and other people don't repent
[24:51] and they fail to repent God will use us
[24:54] on the day of judgment against them
[24:56] that's right Hallelujah
[24:59] so it's very important to repent when
[25:00] you know it's time to repent to rejoice
[25:02] when it's time to Rejoice to give thanks
[25:04] when it's time to give thanks
[25:07] Hallelujah see traveling to hear the
[25:09] wisdom of preaching not Mighty Miracles
[25:11] like the Red Sea like uh you know Queen
[25:13] of the South didn't see the Red Sea part
[25:15] and all the billions of gallons of water
[25:17] she didn't see that all she saw was
[25:18] Solomon under the operation of of uh
[25:21] Discerning the thoughts and Tents of the
[25:23] heart with his gift of wisdom and
[25:25] discernment that's all she saw and yet
[25:27] she'll go to heav Heaven because she uh
[25:29] uh she supported the word of God that
[25:31] was revealed in her day Hallelujah the
[25:34] man of God who was preaching in her day
[25:36] she was faithful to it she believed it
[25:38] and she supported it Hallelujah she
[25:40] traveled far to see it
[25:42] Hallelujah and God will honor that type
[25:44] of
[25:46] faith that makes you worthy to judge
[25:48] when you're willing to drive or travel
[25:50] to to meet God when you're willing to do
[25:52] that that will judge others who are too
[25:54] lazy to do it Hallelujah just like if
[25:57] you're willing to repent in of service
[25:59] and say you're sorry you don't even have
[26:00] to come up for prayer you can tell God
[26:02] wherever you are but the main thing is
[26:03] if you really repented you'll be changed
[26:05] when you leave out those doors
[26:06] hallelujah or that door Hallelujah I
[26:08] guess you got doors one door two door
[26:10] Hallelujah you'll be changed God will
[26:13] know if you meant business or not amen
[26:17] Church we've been blessed to see these
[26:18] fulfilled prophecies from William
[26:19] brandham as well Supernatural works of
[26:21] the Holy
[26:22] Ghost Congressman Upshaw was in a
[26:25] wheelchair for what 60 years and brother
[26:28] saw a vision while he's in the service
[26:30] and and tells him he's going to walk he
[26:32] got up and walked and then he wrote
[26:34] letters to musolini and all these other
[26:36] guys telling his testimony trying to get
[26:38] them to come to Jesus a paralyzed man
[26:40] walked through God's Prophet Hallelujah
[26:43] I heard on tape brother man told Marilyn
[26:44] Hickey he said uh thus sayith the Lord
[26:46] you're from a place with mountains all
[26:48] these things you're from Colorado he
[26:50] said if you'll believe you'll have a
[26:51] baby thus sayith the Lord 10 years later
[26:54] she had the baby Hallelujah and she only
[26:56] had one baby Hal Hallelujah but it was
[26:59] thus sayith the Lord hallelujah see thus
[27:01] sayith the Lord cannot fail that's God
[27:04] speaking through a prophet that's God
[27:05] giving his spokesman his word hallelujah
[27:09] and it cannot fail Hallelujah that's
[27:12] right no you're not that we shall judge
[27:15] Angels now this is confusing to me as
[27:17] far as not in a bad way but I just don't
[27:19] understand how we will judge angels I
[27:21] would
[27:23] imagine I'd imagine you know as Paul
[27:25] cast out Devils you know out of that
[27:27] woman that with the spirit Divination in
[27:28] the book of Acts I imagine Paul will
[27:30] judge that angel on I'm sorry that
[27:32] fallen angel on the day of judgment
[27:34] because you tormented that girl I
[27:36] condemn you to Hell something along
[27:38] those lines or maybe Jesus will say that
[27:41] but God will raise up Paul and that
[27:43] woman that that got the demon offer
[27:44] hopefully she got saved right by God's
[27:46] grace and God will use those Believers
[27:48] to say devil you tormented me all those
[27:50] years all those months but now God's
[27:53] given us the Victory and now you're
[27:54] condemned because you rejected Heaven
[27:56] you rejected God and you're judged uh to
[27:59] be annihilated in the Lake of Fire cuz
[28:02] that's why hell was created for the
[28:03] devil and his angels Hallelujah is that
[28:07] right amen what about these angels Paul
[28:10] said Paul said there's going to be
[28:12] Angels that'll come around and try to
[28:13] preach a different gospel like they did
[28:15] to Joseph Smith Joseph Smith met an
[28:17] angel all these preachers on the
[28:19] internet say meet Angels but they're
[28:21] preaching a different
[28:23] gospel if they don't repent of that
[28:25] those demons are going to lead them to
[28:27] hell if they repented that and if they
[28:29] admit I was a false teacher I taught the
[28:32] word wrong I believe false prophecy God
[28:34] forgive me wash me in your blood I'll
[28:35] never preach again I'll never prophesy
[28:37] if they really genuinely repent then on
[28:39] the day of judgment they could judge
[28:41] Angels amen hallelujah don't you think
[28:45] Micaiah Church don't you think Micaiah
[28:47] will judge that lying spirit that was
[28:49] upon those 450
[28:51] prophets because he knew it right he
[28:53] knew Hallelujah he knew he said the Lord
[28:56] showed me I saw the Lord High lifted up
[29:00] and the Lord was in his Temple
[29:01] Hallelujah glory to God and all these
[29:03] Spirits came forth and finally the lying
[29:05] Spirit don't you think M will stand
[29:07] there and as a testimony you lying
[29:09] Spirit you tried to have me killed you
[29:10] had me tossed in prison got me beat and
[29:12] all these things like that I judge you I
[29:14] condemn you to Hell by the grace of God
[29:16] by the power not by the grace but by the
[29:18] power of God the Judgment of God
[29:22] hallelujah don't you know we'll judge
[29:25] the world and we'll judge angels
[29:29] angels that likely probably tormented
[29:31] people around us or even ourselves in
[29:33] our
[29:34] lifetime
[29:35] hallelujah what about 2 Corinthians
[29:38] 11:14 where Paul said Satan will
[29:40] transform himself into an angel of Light
[29:43] don't you believe anybody that says they
[29:44] saw an angel heard an angel take that
[29:46] Angel's word back to the
[29:48] word because a real angel will never
[29:51] change what Jesus Christ told Paul to
[29:53] preach Hallelujah the Bible said right
[29:56] now Jude 1:6 we've already gone over and
[29:58] second Peter 2:4 there are already
[30:01] Angels now in Chains awaiting that
[30:04] judgment so I imagine that's the angels
[30:06] that were uh uh I'm sorry the fallen
[30:09] angels that were battling the former
[30:10] Believers like maybe Noah's day and
[30:13] maybe even the days of the Lord Jesus
[30:15] it's really interesting though I don't
[30:17] have all the answers on it but we know
[30:19] we will judge the a we will judge the
[30:21] world and we will judge Angels if we can
[30:24] judge the world and we can judge demons
[30:27] he says how much more can we judge
[30:29] things in this
[30:31] life Hallelujah if we're going to judge
[30:34] going into eternal life and and our
[30:36] judgment will make people either be
[30:38] saved or lost he said how much more
[30:41] should we judge right
[30:43] now
[30:46] Hallelujah everybody's thinking real
[30:48] deep huh so Matthew 25 we get this scene
[30:51] at the uh the great white Throne
[30:53] judgment and we can see how Saints will
[30:55] judge the Earth right we know that these
[30:58] are the ones that are lost uh Jesus said
[31:00] depart from me you curse and everlasting
[31:02] fire prepared for the Devil's Angels
[31:03] we're familiar with this I'm just going
[31:04] to skip ahead so this is what the
[31:06] judgment will sound like Jesus will say
[31:07] depart from me let's say to these people
[31:09] in akan or something like or or people
[31:11] uh in Havasu or something like that you
[31:13] know just something around here he said
[31:16] because you didn't repent at the
[31:18] preaching you heard at at bride of
[31:19] Christ Fellowship and they'll say I
[31:22] never heard you preach a bride of Christ
[31:23] Fellowship
[31:24] Jesus and he'll say I was preaching
[31:27] through the fivefold ministry here or
[31:29] there and the saints that were in bride
[31:31] of Christ Fellowship will raise up and
[31:33] testify against them because they didn't
[31:35] repent but we repented Hallelujah
[31:39] everybody see that by God's grace quite
[31:41] quite plain so Jesus gives the
[31:43] condemnation and Jesus even lets them
[31:45] say what when when did I I never saw you
[31:48] sick I I never saw you in prison I never
[31:50] saw these things and Jesus will tell
[31:52] them it was me in my church it was me in
[31:54] the body I'm the head the bride is the
[31:57] body amen Church imagine that we're
[31:59] connected to the Head Hallelujah we are
[32:01] the body of Christ in other words he's
[32:03] moving he gives the intelligence for us
[32:05] to move
[32:06] Hallelujah he tells us what to do he
[32:08] tells us what to say he tells us how to
[32:10] judge he's the mind we have the mind of
[32:13] Christ
[32:14] Hallelujah glory to God Amen I'm so
[32:18] encouraged because I've seen in all
[32:19] these people come against me over the
[32:20] years I've always seen God
[32:22] Prevail all these accusation against me
[32:24] like I said I just you just got to do
[32:26] what you got to do you got to stay with
[32:27] the word of God
[32:29] hallelujah or it might sound something
[32:31] like this depart from me you didn't
[32:32] travel far enough to hear the word of
[32:34] God like the Queen of Sheba or the queen
[32:36] of South and they said I never heard you
[32:38] preaching far away
[32:39] Jesus and Jesus will say when you heard
[32:41] about your chance to travel and maybe
[32:43] drive two hours to go to the akan
[32:46] church my fivefold Ministry was
[32:48] preaching or maybe you have to travel to
[32:51] go a certain place uh maybe to make it
[32:53] your home church and you failed to go
[32:55] Jesus would say that was me preaching
[32:58] you didn't travel you didn't make the
[32:59] sacrifice to see me
[33:02] preach right and here are the Saints
[33:05] that went and traveled all those hours
[33:09] they drove across the state they drove
[33:10] through snow I know my wife and I can
[33:12] say Amen we were talking about that we
[33:13] were young we were kind of foolish well
[33:15] I was kind of foolish I'm not gonna say
[33:16] my wife I was kind of foolish when I was
[33:18] young I drive through any snow any snow
[33:21] and a couple times some of our friends
[33:23] found us got in the ditch you
[33:25] know we were just there's no wisdom
[33:28] right and then God had to show me I
[33:29] almost hit a car one time going home
[33:31] from church so I've tried to learn to
[33:33] grow in Grace and knowledge of the Lord
[33:35] to have the wisdom of
[33:37] God because Zeal so quickly eats up
[33:39] wisdom so
[33:41] quickly but Jesus will say listen I I I
[33:45] I never heard about you preaching an
[33:46] acan how could I I never I never drove
[33:48] there because I didn't know and Jesus
[33:50] said it was it was me in the fivefold
[33:52] ministry not just me but all the
[33:54] preachers amen oh it's too far to go to
[33:57] church there's no excuses the queen of
[33:59] sha didn't make any
[34:01] excuse Hallelujah when nobody else was
[34:04] at the altar I didn't feel like I should
[34:05] go up and repent there's no excuses amen
[34:08] if God speak into your heart follow the
[34:10] leadership of the Lord hallelujah clean
[34:13] out your house amen clean out your
[34:14] temple praise God it's God's house
[34:16] listen to the voice of God
[34:20] hallelujah he'll say depart from me you
[34:22] curse you didn't visit me when I was
[34:23] sick you didn't give clothes to me when
[34:25] I was naked you you didn't give me water
[34:27] to to me when I was thirsty and take me
[34:29] in when I needed housing nor yet uh you
[34:32] didn't visit me in prison they say I
[34:33] never saw you sick naked or thirsty
[34:36] homeless or imprisoned and they'll say
[34:38] when you saw Christians in these
[34:39] conditions it was me because they're my
[34:42] body and here's the saints that actually
[34:44] went and visited them gave them clothes
[34:47] visited me in prison prayed for me when
[34:49] I was sick he'll raise up Believers that
[34:51] were faithful to the word of God like
[34:54] Brother Andy raber so so eloquently told
[34:56] me
[34:59] uh when he was coming here he remember
[35:00] he was our song leader for a while that
[35:02] remember that my wife remember that such
[35:04] a wonderful song leader but one even
[35:07] before he came here my wife had baby I
[35:09] think it was Caris I can't remember
[35:10] which one it was so Andy Andy call Andy
[35:14] has his wife call all the sisters in the
[35:15] church they fill up an entire uh truck
[35:18] bed full of frozen food for our family
[35:20] and he drives it two hours
[35:23] here and we had just enough room in our
[35:25] freezer all the food could get in there
[35:27] the little left s we cooked that
[35:29] night and I said I was crying I said
[35:31] Brother Andy what can I ever do to repay
[35:33] you and he says these words he says what
[35:35] other reason are we here other than to
[35:38] help one another and that those have
[35:40] stuck with me all those years Caris is
[35:42] what 11 now yes I got it 11 you believe
[35:47] that
[35:48] joking would you understand what what
[35:51] other purpose are we here to help out
[35:53] when we can help
[35:55] out especially if somebody's sick naked
[35:57] thirsty homeless remember even a cup of
[35:59] water I'm thirsty brother Jess even a
[36:01] cup of water in the name of the disciple
[36:03] you get a reward for
[36:05] that just just be we just got to be
[36:07] sensitive to what are the needs of the
[36:09] church how can I help out maybe I can
[36:11] just go visit and pray but it's like
[36:13] you're visiting Christ
[36:16] Hallelujah and these are things that are
[36:18] are these are works that is proof a
[36:21] person have saving Faith we're not saved
[36:24] by works we're Saved By Faith but Faith
[36:26] causes us to work work
[36:29] Hallelujah so we kind of know what it's
[36:31] going to sound like to judge the world
[36:32] this is what it's going to sound
[36:34] like I never saw you Jesus I never saw
[36:37] you well I was in Pastor
[36:40] Jesse I was in Sister
[36:43] Lydia and you didn't do it right that's
[36:46] what it's going to sound like and you
[36:48] will judge The World God will raise you
[36:51] up or raise somebody else up who is
[36:52] willing to do it willing to travel
[36:54] willing to repent willing to do all
[36:56] these visit the sick pray all these
[36:57] things give clothes all these things God
[36:59] will raise up somebody that was willing
[37:00] to do it God help us to hear the voice
[37:02] of God
[37:03] tonight
[37:07] Hallelujah if then you have judgments of
[37:10] things pertaining to this life set them
[37:12] to judge who are least esteemed in the
[37:14] church notice the most humble Saints in
[37:16] a local church should be trustworthy to
[37:19] judge between their more esteemed
[37:20] brothers and sisters so I'm not don't
[37:23] raise hands but who who among us if I
[37:25] said name me the most spiritual people
[37:27] people in our church who would be the
[37:29] first few people okay now if I said who
[37:31] are the least spiritual people in the
[37:33] church don't say names out loud
[37:36] okay give me the few names of who would
[37:38] be there Paul said if we truly have the
[37:41] Holy Spirit the people that we thought
[37:43] maybe the least of the least esteemed
[37:46] the least popular the least even they
[37:49] will be able to judge the matters
[37:52] correctly you know why because they're
[37:54] humble because they know they're nothing
[37:56] they know they're nobody
[37:59] so Paul said just get the least they're
[38:01] so humble right who who Glory who does
[38:04] God draw nigh to the proud or the
[38:05] esteemed or the
[38:07] humble that's right good answer Church
[38:10] you're good Bible believing Church
[38:11] Hallelujah keep studying the scripture
[38:13] where does God Draw N to the humble he
[38:16] resists the proud but he gives grace to
[38:18] the
[38:19] humble and Paul said even a baby
[38:21] Christian could judge these matters this
[38:23] guy suing that girl or that girl suing
[38:25] that girl even a baby could judge these
[38:27] things
[38:31] find the most humble those are the be
[38:33] the people qualified to
[38:35] judge now notice Paul is speaking all
[38:38] this to shame
[38:40] them now I don't remember the last time
[38:42] I preached a sermon that shame the
[38:46] church I don't remember the last time I
[38:48] tried to put shame on you so God hasn't
[38:51] led me to do
[38:53] it but as a preacher I could be led to
[38:55] do that if we are in a a similar
[38:58] condition to the way the Corinthian
[38:59] Church was thank God we're not now
[39:01] there's some areas we can grow in
[39:03] absolutely yeah let's be honest we we
[39:05] all can
[39:07] grow but this was written this was
[39:09] written to shame the people how dare you
[39:13] do these things why would you go to the
[39:15] world to judge Saints you're going to
[39:17] judge them it's you're going backwards
[39:19] totally contrary to God's
[39:23] thinking he said then he shames him
[39:25] again is it so you don't have a wise man
[39:27] among you you got all these gifts all
[39:29] the prophecy all the tongues all these
[39:30] interpretations you got all this but you
[39:32] don't got one person with any wisdom in
[39:34] their
[39:37] mind you have to leave the church with
[39:40] the gifts and the supernatural got to
[39:41] leave that to go to a bunch of demon
[39:43] possessed people to judge your matter to
[39:46] get your
[39:49] way God have mercy no not one shall be
[39:53] able to judge you don't have one in this
[39:55] church
[39:57] you have 10,000 instructors Paul told me
[39:59] you have 10,000 teachers everyone want
[40:01] to step up take their chance okay it's
[40:03] my turn to teach okay next brother it's
[40:05] his turn to teach all these
[40:07] instructors he said you don't even have
[40:09] one of those guys that can sit down and
[40:12] judge between two people trying to sue
[40:14] each other and stop this
[40:19] nonsense but brother go to law with
[40:22] brother like I said can you imagine me
[40:24] in this church we're all leaving I say
[40:27] God bless you brother Patrick I'll see
[40:28] you in court tomorrow I'm gonna get my
[40:29] $100 back see you God bless
[40:33] you can you imagine that that's what
[40:36] this church was God bless you brother I
[40:37] know You' never do
[40:39] that take shaking hands on Sunday love
[40:42] you brother see you in court on
[40:45] Tuesday you're GNA you're G to give me
[40:47] my car back you're gonna give me my
[40:49] house
[40:51] back that that's that's the Holy Spirit
[40:54] no that's not the Holy
[40:55] Spirit that's a selfish
[40:58] Spirit he calls it a extortioner spirit
[41:01] later he calls it a robbing
[41:03] Spirit he calls it
[41:05] out it's a
[41:07] shame a church filled with all these
[41:09] gifts so see Church you know even even I
[41:12] even I I want more gifts in the church
[41:14] Austin I would love to see more tongues
[41:15] interpretation prophecy all these things
[41:17] but yet you can have all that and still
[41:20] have all this
[41:23] nonsense and then brother R tells us
[41:25] don't be don't don't ever try to
[41:26] imperson something just be what you
[41:29] are just be just be humble and let God
[41:32] Work among you don't try to be something
[41:34] that you're not just wait on the Lord
[41:37] and what he'll renew your strength like
[41:40] the eagle how many know that you ever
[41:42] been weak before and you just wait on
[41:44] God then all of a sudden oh I got my
[41:45] strength back by God's grace got my
[41:48] vision back Hallelujah I got my I got my
[41:51] Zeal back Hallelujah now as is
[41:54] balanced they could find so many people
[41:57] speaking with tongues but not one person
[41:59] has wisdom or
[42:01] judgment how can you speak in tongues
[42:03] and then speak lot uh hatred and lies
[42:05] like I'm going to go sue
[42:08] you right exactly or prophesy or any of
[42:11] those Faith speak in faith and yet then
[42:13] go I'll see you I'll see you at the
[42:16] courtroom and that's going to be out in
[42:17] front of everybody making fun of us
[42:19] mocking us oh this is what Christians
[42:20] are H what a bunch of Pretenders
[42:23] impersonators oh they just got head
[42:25] knowledge just head religion they don't
[42:26] have nothing real
[42:29] Paul says how dare you do something like
[42:32] that now therefore there is utterly a
[42:34] fault this means a loss or defeat among
[42:37] you because you go to law with one
[42:39] another why do you not rather take the
[42:41] wrong why would you not rather suffer
[42:42] yourselves to be defrauded or robbed so
[42:46] see church when this happens when when
[42:48] these disputes get so intense they've
[42:51] already been defeated and entrapped by
[42:53] Satan remember we preach on the snares
[42:54] of the devil
[42:57] when when people get to this degree like
[42:59] I'm going to have my way and I'm going
[43:01] to do something about this Satan has
[43:03] already trapped them they're snared and
[43:06] they can't get themselves out because
[43:09] Paul says you've already you're utterly
[43:11] with the fault you've already been
[43:12] defeated by
[43:14] Satan right you're asking
[43:17] demon-possessed people not always but
[43:18] most times judges to judge between
[43:20] Spirit-filled so-called members of the
[43:22] body of Christ you're asking demons to
[43:24] judge a the Holy Ghost
[43:27] but it should be the Holy Ghost judging
[43:29] those with the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and
[43:31] their little mind
[43:33] battles which they battle spirits not
[43:35] possessed but maybe oppressed or tempted
[43:38] by temp temp or tempted by evil
[43:40] spirits it's better to take a wrong it's
[43:43] better to take a loss of money or
[43:45] whatever property and be defrauded than
[43:48] to ask demon-possessed people to judge
[43:50] the body of Christ because Jesus was
[43:53] already judged for them all their sins
[43:56] were placed Upon Jesus so why are we
[43:59] asking demon-possessed people to judge
[44:01] the body of Christ Christ has already
[44:02] judged he was righteous amen he was holy
[44:05] he's the son of God hallelujah he's
[44:08] already been
[44:12] judged and church don't you know God
[44:14] will fight for
[44:16] you let people wrong you like I said I I
[44:19] was after these people said these things
[44:20] this week I was like I was so uh Angry
[44:23] I'm just like I got to go I got to go
[44:24] work out so it went worked out I felt
[44:26] better afterwards
[44:27] work off all that I was angry like these
[44:29] people called me out and said these
[44:30] things about me brother Austin I was
[44:34] like but now I prayed about it I've
[44:37] relaxed I've worshiped the Lord and I'm
[44:39] just fine God will fight my battles for
[44:42] me if they're attacking me unjustly well
[44:44] that shows what Spirit they got but if I
[44:47] pray for them that shows what spirit I
[44:49] got amen hallelujah so in every case you
[44:52] have a chance to show what Spirit you're
[44:54] of Hallelujah in every trial you can
[44:57] show to everybody around you what Spirit
[44:59] are you operating under the Holy Ghost
[45:05] Hallelujah nay you do wrong he's talking
[45:07] about to the people suing which is
[45:09] unjust or wickedly and defraud Rob with
[45:12] your brethren so see some of these
[45:13] people going to the courts they were
[45:14] actually trying to rob them
[45:17] unjustly so get some money maybe some
[45:20] interest like the Bible condemns
[45:21] Believers from charge and interest to
[45:22] Believers remember the new Old Testament
[45:24] it speaks of that so Paul's saying some
[45:27] of these brothers are trying to sue for
[45:28] a little more money than that that they
[45:30] should actually get trying to rob them
[45:31] of
[45:32] money now Church why wouldn't God just
[45:36] kill some of these people like ananas
[45:37] and sairus they they were they were
[45:39] lying about money why didn't God just
[45:41] kill because God is rich in
[45:44] Mercy the church was Advanced from the
[45:46] day of Pentecost right and brother B
[45:48] said God you know through the seven
[45:49] Church ages through the seven Church
[45:50] ages they started losing the anointing
[45:52] right they lost it the low point was th
[45:54] Tia but then in Martin Luther's day they
[45:56] got more back John Wesley our day so it
[45:59] was solely dying and then it got a
[46:00] Reformation or sort of a a restoration
[46:04] in the days of the Sardis Church age
[46:05] right Martin
[46:08] Luther so see it had to be this and so
[46:10] God had to show Extra mercy God had to
[46:13] show Extra Grace Hallelujah remember
[46:16] Church they they were they were robbing
[46:18] people of finances but Paul tells us the
[46:21] next chapter husbands can rob their
[46:23] wives of marital pleasure and vice versa
[46:26] why wives can rob husbands of marital
[46:28] pleasure and the church
[46:30] said it's still
[46:32] robbing right whether it's money or
[46:35] whether it's uh family relations we'd
[46:37] say it's still
[46:40] robbing shall a man rob God how about
[46:43] Rob God's son or do God's daughter right
[46:47] church right think about that I mean we
[46:50] gota we got to be spiritual praise God
[46:52] we got to be led by the Holy Spirit
[46:54] praise
[46:55] God so now I'm done with
[47:00] 1-8 now let's go verses 9 to
[47:03] 20 wasn't as bad as I thought it was
[47:05] going to be feel quite good now by God's
[47:08] grace let's look at the sanctity of the
[47:09] body and marriage so right after the
[47:12] section on suing he goes right into
[47:14] don't you know he so said dare any of
[47:16] you to sue now don't you know eight
[47:18] verses later the unrighteous shall not
[47:19] inherit the kingdom of God it's an
[47:21] unrighteous thing for brothers to sue
[47:23] each other it's wicked he called it
[47:24] Wicked so clearly these people suing
[47:26] each other did not have the baptism of
[47:28] the Holy Ghost they might have been
[47:30] saved they might have had a certain
[47:31] level of sanctification but they surely
[47:33] surely were not born again there's no
[47:35] way if a man's trying to sue another man
[47:37] so he can rob him of a little extra
[47:39] money he he don't have the Holy Ghost in
[47:42] his soul I'm talking about his soul
[47:44] Jesus said I'm coming to give rest for
[47:46] your soul Hallelujah I'm going to give
[47:48] you the seal in your soul
[47:50] Hallelujah great in the Old Testament
[47:52] they couldn't have that remember they
[47:54] couldn't have the Holy Ghost in the soul
[47:56] in the old Old Testament cuz Jesus
[47:57] wasn't glorified according to John 7
[48:01] 37-39 but now you can have it in the
[48:05] soul and so Paul tells them these people
[48:07] suing people these people sleeping
[48:09] around these people divided don't you
[48:11] know they will not inherit the kingdom
[48:13] of God inherit means to possess given a
[48:16] lot of God's not going to give you a
[48:17] portion of his kingdom if you can't live
[48:20] the right
[48:21] way he's not like my wife was sharing
[48:25] with me a mem from Galatians uh before a
[48:27] a son is adopted he's got to prove
[48:29] himself worthy by a
[48:31] tutor right Galatians 3 says that you
[48:33] got to be trained by the tutor and then
[48:35] when you're trustworthy then I adopt you
[48:37] into my family that's what the baptism
[48:39] of the Holy Ghost is the baptism of the
[48:41] Holy Ghost is Charity that's what it's
[48:42] called that's the spirit of adoption
[48:44] Paul says that Romans chapter 8 it's the
[48:46] spirit of adoption you're born again now
[48:49] God you're placed into God's family now
[48:51] God can use you praise God
[48:55] hallelujah Malachi have seen it but I
[48:57] had a brother come up uh he come up to
[48:59] me and he at that there in Tennessee at
[49:01] the youth ban he come up so humbly he
[49:02] said brother Jesse I just want to tell
[49:04] you I get to use you because you're
[49:05] right up front all the time sorry buddy
[49:08] maybe I use
[49:09] Mercy he comes up and he was real
[49:11] sincere he brother Jesse I just want to
[49:12] tell you it's an honor to meet you your
[49:16] videos remember that brother did you see
[49:18] it he said I your videos have helped me
[49:20] so much all these years I wanted to be
[49:22] able to meet you and talk to you and I'm
[49:23] like me I said brother it's an honor to
[49:26] meet meet you thank you I said cuz we're
[49:30] all saved by grace I just kind of laugh
[49:32] because I'm like I feel foolish around
[49:33] here you know who am I Mal gu knows me
[49:35] I'm just another man you know until the
[49:37] spirit of God gets on me then I'm
[49:39] Different you know by God's grace but it
[49:41] was it was just so uh it was just so
[49:43] encouraging to me that God it was
[49:44] another reminder God had put me into
[49:46] service to do his will I'm doing his
[49:49] will by the grace of
[49:52] God he said don't you know if you live
[49:55] this is unrighteous living this is
[49:57] living that's not uh it's not living
[50:00] that's born again living is these people
[50:02] haven't crossed over into the baptism of
[50:04] the Holy
[50:05] Ghost that that's what Hebrews chapter 4
[50:07] says remember Hebrews chapter 4 says
[50:09] don't come short being left of a promise
[50:11] of
[50:13] God right that's what Hebrews chapter 4
[50:15] says don't be come short of it in other
[50:17] words go into the promised land remember
[50:19] like Israel leaving leaving uh Egypt
[50:22] into the Red Sea that was like water
[50:23] baptism when you get baptized now
[50:25] Crossing through the wilderness was
[50:26] sanctification but the third step was
[50:29] Crossing Jordan taking your position in
[50:31] the promised land hallelujah amen and
[50:33] that's what it is for us we get saved
[50:35] then we got to get Sanctified which
[50:36] means purified and then we got to get
[50:38] filled with the holy spirit that puts us
[50:40] into service God can use us
[50:43] hallelujah amen you want to be used by
[50:45] God get filled with the Holy Ghost
[50:47] Hallelujah then God will use
[50:50] you
[50:52] Hallelujah so in chapter five he
[50:54] addresses a fornicator which even the
[50:57] world wouldn't do most worldly sinful
[50:59] Romans wouldn't do that a man sleeping
[51:01] with his stepmother Paul says that's so
[51:04] wicked but remember Israel did worse
[51:07] than the heathens whose land they took
[51:11] over right so people that that get
[51:13] accustomed to God when God becomes
[51:15] common to you Church look
[51:16] out you'll do things you never thought
[51:18] you'd
[51:20] do do not let God become common to you
[51:23] don't let the word become common to you
[51:27] because these people in the word they
[51:29] went the furthest into sin even than the
[51:31] Sinners and here it happened in the book
[51:33] of Acts
[51:34] Church unbelievable because you think
[51:36] you think oh God's so merciful God will
[51:38] forgive me he ain't going to forgive all
[51:39] that if you purposely transgress against
[51:42] him he ain't going to forgive all that
[51:43] unless you truly
[51:45] repent right and then chapter six he
[51:48] addressed the robbers these men suing
[51:50] each other so now he's going to rebuke
[51:52] all these sins didn't they know the
[51:54] kingdom of God is inherited through
[51:56] through
[51:57] obedience and what we preach on Sunday
[52:00] character you've been thinking about
[52:01] that I've been thinking about character
[52:02] are we you know on Sunday night I always
[52:04] I like I like to hear what my children
[52:05] remember for my sermon and almost every
[52:07] one of them said something about
[52:08] character I was like Oh Glory good I was
[52:10] led of the Holy Ghost to preach on
[52:11] character it's a good reminder it's your
[52:14] moral Excellence it's how obedient you
[52:17] are to God's
[52:19] word and Paul said don't you know God
[52:21] ain't going to let any just anybody
[52:23] inherit the kingdom of God it's people
[52:25] that are obedient they obey God's Voice
[52:28] Hallelujah they do what God says to
[52:31] do don't you know these people suing
[52:34] each other they're not going to get the
[52:35] kingdom of God this man sleeping around
[52:37] he's not going to get the kingdom of God
[52:39] these drunk people they're not going to
[52:40] inherit the kingdom of
[52:47] God brother Braham said he's quoting the
[52:49] scripture naked physically we came into
[52:51] the world but naked spiritually we will
[52:52] not leave oh no he says we're going to
[52:55] take something with us what that
[52:56] something is is all we can take with us
[52:59] nothing less and nothing more there's
[53:00] only one thing you're taking with you
[53:01] when you die lyia reminded me of this I
[53:04] forgot this on Sunday thank you Lydia
[53:06] props to
[53:07] you he said we had better be real
[53:10] careful now to see what we take
[53:12] something that will make us right before
[53:14] God so then what will we take with us we
[53:16] will take our character brother that is
[53:19] what we will take with us hallelujah now
[53:22] what kind of character I'm sorry will
[53:24] you take with you will it be his whose
[53:27] character was molded by suffering
[53:29] remember Church the only time we get
[53:31] better at obeying is when we suffer it's
[53:33] the only time we're going to get better
[53:35] at a better Christian is to
[53:38] suffer it's not when things are going
[53:40] good not when everything's happening
[53:42] that's great and it seems like every
[53:43] prayer is being answered it's when we
[53:45] suffer then we're going to get better
[53:47] obeying the
[53:49] Lord or will it be the softness of this
[53:53] characterless leoan people
[53:56] it is up to each one of us for in that
[53:58] day every man will bear his own burden
[54:00] now I was down there at that youth
[54:01] meeting too and I I I could share some
[54:03] of these brothers were really I mean
[54:04] they're coming out of services right so
[54:06] they're coming out they're all joyful
[54:08] and they're all telling me God corrected
[54:09] me on this and God corrected me on that
[54:11] they're just telling their their all
[54:12] their past sins and I'm like you
[54:13] probably don't want to say that too
[54:16] loud
[54:21] right which is it's okay I'm glad
[54:23] they're overcoming it but they get they
[54:25] better get build up stronger cuz those
[54:27] demons are coming
[54:30] back enjoy your seasons of Victory but
[54:33] you better start lifting some spiritual
[54:35] weights and get stronger because those
[54:36] demons are going to come back trying to
[54:38] get in with seven
[54:39] more enjoy the victory but there's a
[54:42] battle
[54:43] coming
[54:47] Hallelujah but see but you know this
[54:49] reminded me because all these these I
[54:51] should say all three or four brothers
[54:53] were telling me all their mistakes and
[54:54] I'm like oh you were struggling with
[54:55] that for years and my eyes are
[55:00] like
[55:02] years no I'm just going to put a word in
[55:04] there porn struggling porn for years or
[55:08] laziness for years or not reading my
[55:10] Bible for years or not praying for years
[55:13] years and I'm
[55:15] like okay Glory Hallelujah praise the
[55:20] Lord what kind of character do we have
[55:22] are we soft or do we have character like
[55:25] Christ
[55:26] that God lets us suffer God lets us go
[55:29] through trials so it keeps us closer to
[55:31] God
[55:32] hallelujah what kind of character do we
[55:34] have is it soft character or is it fir
[55:38] tried character like Jesus
[55:42] Christ that's the only thing you're
[55:44] taking with you now what's that
[55:46] character that character is the the the
[55:48] the the white robe the righteousness of
[55:50] Christ in other words Christ has helped
[55:52] you to do what's right go you have God's
[55:53] anointing to do the right things and the
[55:55] church say it's not your works but it's
[55:57] God's grace that's formed a character
[55:59] into you where you can yield to the Holy
[56:01] Spirit you can die every day
[56:04] hallelujah it's up to each one of us for
[56:07] in that day every man will bear his own
[56:09] burden I can't take your burden on I
[56:11] can't take your burden on you got to
[56:12] Bear your own sisters got to Bear your
[56:15] own
[56:15] burdens right I can't take on your
[56:18] burden you can't take on mine we got to
[56:20] overcome by Christlike
[56:23] character know you not that the
[56:25] unrighteous should not inherit the
[56:26] kingdom of God be not deceived neither
[56:28] fornicators idolators adulterers
[56:30] effeminate men abusing boys so sexual
[56:33] abuse nor abuser of themselves with
[56:35] mankind homosexual nor thieves nor
[56:38] Covetous nor drunkards nor revilers
[56:40] which are railers scolding scolding
[56:43] harsh abusive language so see that's
[56:45] done on like X and this is done on
[56:47] Facebook people scold like I I got a lot
[56:49] of railing done to me this week I was
[56:51] surely ra raked up and down the rails
[56:53] this
[56:54] week it was one of my favorite preachers
[56:56] too I was like oh man he's one of my
[56:59] favorites he's bashing me well that's
[57:02] all right I'll pray for
[57:04] him nor extortioners so there's the
[57:06] robbers he's calling out those robbers
[57:08] those men trying to sue each other none
[57:10] of them shall inherit the kingdom of God
[57:14] now Paul just lists 10
[57:16] sins right and so so these 10 sins will
[57:20] keep you from the baptism of the Holy
[57:22] Ghost you ever understand that because
[57:25] because the Holy Ghost is the kingdom of
[57:27] God Luke 17:21 Jesus says the kingdom of
[57:30] God is within
[57:32] you what's Kingdom it means rulership
[57:35] what is the Holy Ghost it's God ruling
[57:37] your
[57:38] temple Hallelujah so Paul says if you do
[57:42] these sins you're not born again the
[57:45] kingdom of God is not in
[57:47] you now for us in our church it's
[57:49] probably going to be uh you know if
[57:52] we're living pure sexually if we're none
[57:54] of us are going to be homosexuals or
[57:55] abusers it's probably going to be like
[57:57] thieves Covetous revi uh
[58:00] revilers extortioners maybe right as
[58:03] long as we're we're keeping our body in
[58:06] subjection to the Holy Spirit we're
[58:08] keeping our sexual passions under
[58:12] control now you remember this uh a
[58:15] couple years ago I preached on the 23
[58:16] sins that disqualify from the kingdom
[58:18] within so these 23 sins keep the people
[58:21] from the baptism of the Holy Ghost Jesus
[58:22] gives us seven in Matthew 15 evil
[58:24] thoughts murders adulteries
[58:27] fornications thefts or extortion false
[58:30] witness lying and
[58:32] blasphemies now I got I got a whole
[58:34] video on that so I'm not going to read
[58:35] all that Paul gives us 16 more sins
[58:38] idolatry a feminite child molestation
[58:41] homosexual sodomites Covetous Envy
[58:43] drunkards uh revilers uncleanness
[58:46] lasciviousness witchcraft which is also
[58:48] drug drug addiction hatred now think of
[58:51] that hatred hatred people hate people
[58:54] they hate others and they won't be born
[58:55] again men all because they can't
[59:00] love variance which is heated
[59:03] disagreements emulation jealousy see
[59:06] just because people are jealous they're
[59:07] not going to get the Holy Ghost you got
[59:10] to be happy for people if you want the
[59:11] Holy
[59:12] Ghost wrath passionate anger Strife
[59:16] electioneering for position desire to
[59:18] put yourself forward seditions heresies
[59:20] and reing now here's the sad part
[59:21] remember the Bourbon Street attacks on
[59:23] New Year's Day I told this to Haven it
[59:26] was so sad how many 15 people died but
[59:29] if they would have obeyed the Bible the
[59:30] Bible
[59:31] forbids loud parties that go late into
[59:33] the night that man attacked at 3:00 a.m.
[59:37] they should have been in
[59:39] bed and I'm not I don't wish any evil on
[59:42] anybody I just told Haven I said Haven
[59:44] revelings is one of the sins that if you
[59:46] have late night parties you do not
[59:48] inherit the kingdom of God other words
[59:50] the Holy Ghost is going to say go to bed
[59:52] so you get up early and
[59:53] pray now unless he keeps you up in the
[59:55] night to study and pray and fast or
[59:56] something like that you you understand
[59:57] there there's
[59:59] balance but think about that all those
[1:00:01] people would not have lost their lives
[1:00:03] if they just would have obeyed the
[1:00:07] scripture and so those people could
[1:00:09] never inherit the kingdom of God now of
[1:00:12] course because they're passed away of
[1:00:13] course they won't I don't know the
[1:00:15] condition before they got drunk or I
[1:00:16] don't know I don't know if they're drunk
[1:00:17] or not I'm just saying God forbids late
[1:00:20] night
[1:00:22] parties and such were some of you so we
[1:00:24] were all these things church we were all
[1:00:26] these things at one point and the church
[1:00:28] said good we don't have any
[1:00:29] self-righteous Pharisees in here tonight
[1:00:32] although I have been called a couple
[1:00:33] weeks ago the Pharisee of akan I've been
[1:00:35] called that
[1:00:36] too these railers I tell you Bo they
[1:00:39] surely know how to try to get me fired
[1:00:42] up but I won't I wrote I wrote that one
[1:00:44] guy back he called me Kane today I wrote
[1:00:46] him back I said and I said well that's
[1:00:48] fine your that's your own opinion I said
[1:00:50] I just hope the sweetness of the Holy
[1:00:52] Ghost will soften your hard heart
[1:00:53] someday
[1:00:57] he said you're just like cane of the
[1:00:59] cane seed and you can't all because I I
[1:01:02] believe um I believe there's seven years
[1:01:04] left in Daniel 70 weeks instead of three
[1:01:06] and a half that's the only reason he's
[1:01:07] calling me
[1:01:12] Cain that's
[1:01:14] it that's all that's why I said that I
[1:01:17] said may God soften your poor hard ice
[1:01:20] cold heart with the sweetness of the
[1:01:22] holy spirit will you believe in the same
[1:01:24] water baptism the same evidence of the
[1:01:26] Holy Ghost God sent a prophet all we
[1:01:28] believe all these other things we
[1:01:29] disagree on one thing now I'm Kain I'm
[1:01:32] sorry you got a hard heart this guy's
[1:01:34] got a hard Heart Lord help
[1:01:36] him such were some of you so I I know
[1:01:39] for sure I could testify I was a lot of
[1:01:40] those
[1:01:42] things but I love how the spirit of God
[1:01:45] makes us a were we were robbers and the
[1:01:49] church said we were sexually immoral and
[1:01:51] the church said we were drunkards or
[1:01:53] drug addicts and the church said
[1:01:56] but we've been washed Hallelujah we've
[1:01:59] been clean that's what sanctify means
[1:02:00] cleaned out set aside for service
[1:02:04] purified we were dirty but we've been
[1:02:07] purified by the name of the Lord Jesus
[1:02:09] that's why we get baptized in the name
[1:02:11] of the Lord Jesus Christ and by the
[1:02:13] spirit of our
[1:02:16] God there's only one other time the word
[1:02:18] wash is used and and they ananas told
[1:02:21] Paul rise up be baptized wash away thy
[1:02:23] sins calling upon the name of the Lord
[1:02:26] so how you wash your sins is repent of
[1:02:28] your sins say God I'm I'm sorry forgive
[1:02:31] me clean all this dirtiness out of my
[1:02:33] heart I want a fresh start make me a new
[1:02:35] creature give me a new life Hallelujah
[1:02:37] wash me in your
[1:02:39] spirit and then we can be the word group
[1:02:42] I I was that we were that but not
[1:02:44] anymore Hallelujah things I used to do I
[1:02:49] do them no
[1:02:51] more Hallelujah I'm in that word crowd
[1:02:55] there I
[1:02:57] were what did Jesus Christ do he loved
[1:03:01] us Jesus loved me Jesus loved you and so
[1:03:05] what'd he do he washed you from your own
[1:03:08] sins in his
[1:03:10] blood he took you and he drew you close
[1:03:13] to himself and he took his own blood and
[1:03:15] he washed all your sins away with his
[1:03:18] own
[1:03:19] blood and then he didn't stop there now
[1:03:21] that he's got youall clean he's like now
[1:03:23] I'm going to make you a king now I'm
[1:03:25] going to make you a priest if that isn't
[1:03:27] the love of God I never saw it
[1:03:29] Hallelujah to take a dirty stinking uh
[1:03:32] rotten uh Wicked person wash him with
[1:03:35] his own blood with his own sacrifice and
[1:03:37] then give him a position give him a
[1:03:39] purpose in life Hallelujah to be a king
[1:03:41] and priest unto God it's the love of God
[1:03:44] how rich and pure how glorious and
[1:03:46] strong
[1:03:47] Hallelujah it shall forever do endure
[1:03:50] Saints and Angels
[1:03:52] songs oh yes no
[1:03:56] say he washed Us in his own blood he
[1:04:00] made us Kings and Priests so we see
[1:04:03] God's predestination in view
[1:04:05] here that
[1:04:08] clock and in Revelation 7 now I believe
[1:04:11] these are the foolish vergins but some
[1:04:12] people believe it's the bride all right
[1:04:14] whatever again don't call me a Cain just
[1:04:16] because I disagree with you on one
[1:04:17] little
[1:04:18] thing I didn't kill anybody you're
[1:04:20] actually killing me with your words I I
[1:04:22] didn't kill anybody you're the one
[1:04:23] trying to kill me I didn't do anything
[1:04:25] he said these which came out of great
[1:04:27] not the Great Tribulation but of Great
[1:04:28] Tribulation and have washed their robes
[1:04:31] and made them white in the blood of the
[1:04:33] Lamb so now we get the idea in one way
[1:04:36] God brings us unto himself and washes us
[1:04:38] but here we get another idea we're
[1:04:40] supposed to go to God and we have the
[1:04:43] responsibility okay it's time for wash
[1:04:44] day now I know all you sisters love wash
[1:04:47] day and my house is just so much
[1:04:50] fun when you got 10 people to wash their
[1:04:52] clothes
[1:04:56] at my house you got to take one basket
[1:04:57] at a time dump it down the stairs
[1:04:59] another one coming another one got some
[1:05:02] more Yep keep coming yeah got some keep
[1:05:04] coming and who walks it over there to
[1:05:06] the laund or the the washing machine my
[1:05:08] sweet dear
[1:05:09] wife so she takes her own and all of our
[1:05:12] dirty clothes she takes it to be washed
[1:05:15] and that's what we're supposed to
[1:05:16] do we're not right with God we should
[1:05:18] bring our dirty gar and say lord it's
[1:05:20] time to wash these I'm bringing them to
[1:05:22] you I know enough
[1:05:25] right I'm not GNA I'm not going to have
[1:05:27] a hard heart I'm going to bring my dirty
[1:05:29] condition I'm going to bring my sinful
[1:05:31] condition to you because I know you make
[1:05:32] me clean Hallelujah if that washing
[1:05:34] machine can make the clothes clean what
[1:05:36] about the washing machine of the blood
[1:05:38] of Jesus Christ
[1:05:40] Hallelujah Glory how much more
[1:05:43] thoroughly will we be washed by the
[1:05:45] blood of Jesus Christ than your natural
[1:05:47] washing machine I told Naomi at some
[1:05:50] point she's going to tell the
[1:05:50] testimonies to our little ones about how
[1:05:53] she always grew up wanting a washing
[1:05:54] machine in the house
[1:05:56] so sister prepare that
[1:05:58] testimony our little girls and little
[1:06:01] Bros they don't know what they got I
[1:06:04] don't know what I got right we don't
[1:06:05] know what we
[1:06:07] got but look we have even something
[1:06:09] better than a washing
[1:06:11] machine a natural washing machine we
[1:06:13] have a spiritual washing machine and
[1:06:16] they don't they God don't take any coins
[1:06:17] either you can't you you don't pay for
[1:06:19] this this is all
[1:06:20] free I used to go to the
[1:06:22] lrat oh yeah I remember when you used to
[1:06:25] go buddy
[1:06:27] glory amen Vindication two
[1:06:30] witnesses but God's washing machine you
[1:06:32] don't have to pay you just got to carry
[1:06:35] your dirty clothes and put it into put
[1:06:38] it into God's machine Hallelujah and it
[1:06:40] all comes out perfectly clean and wide
[1:06:43] you don't even got to iron
[1:06:45] it it's already beautiful it's already
[1:06:48] clean so here here we see the will of
[1:06:51] man where we have the responsibility
[1:06:53] okay I know I'm dirty I'm coming to
[1:06:54] Jesus wash me I want to be one of those
[1:06:57] were I used to be like that I'm not like
[1:07:01] that
[1:07:03] anymore I'm almost done all things are
[1:07:05] lawful to me but not all things are
[1:07:07] expedient all all things are lawful for
[1:07:09] me but I will not be brought under the
[1:07:11] power of any he's talking about the
[1:07:13] power of of drunkenness even
[1:07:15] homosexuality right robbing people
[1:07:17] reviling all those sin sexual sins all
[1:07:20] he said I'm not going to be a Christian
[1:07:22] should not be brought under the power of
[1:07:24] that where you feel forced to do do it I
[1:07:26] just have to do this I just can't escape
[1:07:28] it those sins don't control us we
[1:07:31] control them
[1:07:32] Hallelujah that's what Paul says then he
[1:07:35] says some of these things are lawful for
[1:07:37] me see we have to examine even the
[1:07:39] things that are lawful we have to
[1:07:41] examine is this beneficial to my life
[1:07:43] like I've told you before if you can't
[1:07:44] handle a smartphone yeah it's lawful for
[1:07:46] you to have it but is it beneficial that
[1:07:48] you have it can you really handle
[1:07:51] it or is it is it mastering you is it
[1:07:54] making you you do things you know you
[1:07:56] shouldn't do now you're a
[1:07:59] slave now you got to get out of your
[1:08:01] slavery Hallelujah whatever's making you
[1:08:04] do something you don't want to do you
[1:08:06] are a slave to that you're Mastered by
[1:08:08] that and Paul said it shouldn't be so
[1:08:12] Hallelujah see it's lawful to sue
[1:08:14] somebody but not for benefit as a
[1:08:17] Christian not for your beneficiary your
[1:08:19] your financial
[1:08:22] benefit my goodness now this second and
[1:08:25] blue this was the key to me beating
[1:08:27] tobacco chewing tobacco when I first
[1:08:29] became a Christian and this verse was
[1:08:31] the key to unlock my Temperance so I was
[1:08:34] I was a fresh Christian in the message a
[1:08:37] lot of good Bible knowledge but I
[1:08:38] couldn't overcome tobacco I told my wife
[1:08:40] I said I said we're engaged I don't know
[1:08:42] if I can ever overcome this I don't
[1:08:45] know but one day I came across that
[1:08:47] scripture I said oh my goodness I was
[1:08:49] reading the Bible I saidh and it was
[1:08:52] like a key jumped off the page to me ah
[1:08:55] it's it's legal for me to buy chewing
[1:08:58] tobacco it's legal but it's not
[1:09:01] beneficial and I realized wow I'm under
[1:09:03] the power of this how does this little
[1:09:05] can of tin have power over big me I'm
[1:09:08] 190 pounds what this little 3 o can has
[1:09:12] control over me this 3 o controls
[1:09:17] 190 I wasn't
[1:09:19] 190 but I realized I had just a moment
[1:09:22] that's right I'm my life is controlled
[1:09:24] by this little tin right some of our
[1:09:26] lives are controlled by the wrong things
[1:09:27] on our phone or the motivation for fame
[1:09:30] or or money or or sex or something
[1:09:32] something like these things you know uh
[1:09:34] uh robbing you know all these list he
[1:09:35] lists 23 of them their lives are focused
[1:09:38] on that getting back at people
[1:09:41] wrath
[1:09:43] jealousy their whole life is centered on
[1:09:46] this but we do not have to be brought
[1:09:49] under the power of anything I don't have
[1:09:51] to be brought under anybody's power
[1:09:52] except God's power
[1:09:56] now I'm going to show you a picture next
[1:09:57] so children if you don't like uh people
[1:09:58] that have had surgeries don't look at
[1:10:00] this next picture because this guy has
[1:10:01] surgery he's missing parts of his jaw
[1:10:04] this was the actual picture or very
[1:10:06] similar one I hung up when I was a
[1:10:07] message

[1:13:51] that and that little Mustard Seed Glory

[1:14:18] always meant so much to me so I knew
[1:14:19] when I was going to preach 1 Corinthians
[1:14:21] 6 I had to bring that picture up I'm
[1:14:22] just glad I found it online
[1:14:25] one more look this is what the devil
[1:14:27] tries to do he tries to steal your
[1:14:28] future look what he does he tries to
[1:14:30] deform you and make you look not like
[1:14:34] the image of God like you're supposed to
[1:14:35] be you're supposed to be a true child of
[1:14:37] God you're supposed to you're supposed
[1:14:39] to look like a real
[1:14:40] Saint not some deformed
[1:14:43] thing meats are for the belly and the
[1:14:46] bell is for Meats but God should destroy
[1:14:47] both of them now in those days the the
[1:14:49] Corinthians just had that saying well
[1:14:50] Meats go for the belly belly for Meats
[1:14:52] so if it's there I'll just eat it
[1:14:54] remember carpm that sees the day
[1:14:56] remember that yeah you got that that's
[1:14:58] that's from Rome right and so what did
[1:15:00] that mean well I only got today I'm
[1:15:02] going to indulge in everything today
[1:15:03] that's what that would say so Paul's
[1:15:06] combating their
[1:15:07] thinking he's saying but God's going to
[1:15:10] destroy the stomach someday the belly
[1:15:12] God's going to destroy that right or
[1:15:14] you're going to die the body is not for
[1:15:16] fornication but it's for the Lord and
[1:15:18] the Lord is for the body a't that
[1:15:21] awesome God God wants us to realize our
[1:15:23] body is not for fornication the those
[1:15:25] are just little temporary Pleasures our
[1:15:27] bodies were actually made to give God
[1:15:29] glory to magnify God to do the works of
[1:15:32] God that's when your body is being used
[1:15:34] at its best Hallelujah not when your
[1:15:36] body feels the best by fleshly lust and
[1:15:39] things like that that's not what your
[1:15:40] body's made for your body's made to
[1:15:42] glorify God
[1:15:43] hallelujah I know you're getting tired
[1:15:45] I'm getting tired too and God has raised
[1:15:47] both up the Lord and will also raise him
[1:15:50] up us up by his own
[1:15:52] power one more thing I got to say
[1:15:56] where is okay
[1:15:58] there I know I'm going a little extra
[1:16:00] long tonight I guess there's an extra
[1:16:01] poll in here we got extra people here
[1:16:02] tonight so I think people are pulling
[1:16:04] here a little more by God's
[1:16:06] grace know you're not that your bodies
[1:16:08] are the members of Christ don't you know
[1:16:09] you're a part of the body of Christ if
[1:16:12] you were a part of this body let's say
[1:16:13] you're the shoulder let's say you're
[1:16:15] you're some type of
[1:16:16] a some type of a bone in here or
[1:16:19] something like that if you're part of
[1:16:20] the body of Christ why would you why
[1:16:22] would you uh put sin into this body
[1:16:24] you're part of the body of of Christ
[1:16:25] this body's
[1:16:26] sinless you're a part of the body of
[1:16:29] Christ would you take the members of a
[1:16:31] harlot and join them with Christ God
[1:16:33] forbid God forbid We join any sin into
[1:16:36] this body of Christ he lived above it so
[1:16:39] church we can live above it because he's
[1:16:43] inside of us hallelujah he's now inside
[1:16:46] of me Hallelujah think about that I was
[1:16:48] inside of we were inside of him at first
[1:16:50] Glory we we were in the mind of God and
[1:16:53] now God's in us hallelujah
[1:16:55] glor that was fresh to me amen we were
[1:16:58] inside of him and now he comes down he
[1:17:00] condescends and dwells in our
[1:17:05] soul what don't you know again he's
[1:17:08] shaming them what don't you know that he
[1:17:10] which is joined to harlot is one body
[1:17:12] don't you know you always be one with
[1:17:14] that person for two saith he shall be
[1:17:16] one flesh but he that's joined unto Lord
[1:17:19] is one Spirit remember Paul taught we're
[1:17:21] supposed to be married to Jesus Christ
[1:17:25] Hallelujah that's right so that means
[1:17:27] when we're married to Christ we're
[1:17:28] baptized in his name we take on his name
[1:17:30] we're filled with his Spirit right we're
[1:17:32] married unto him we're joined under him
[1:17:33] we have the same Spirit as Jesus
[1:17:36] Christ people see Christ in you brother
[1:17:38] Mercy right people see Christ in you
[1:17:41] brother Patrick right right Malachi they
[1:17:43] see Christ in you when you yield to
[1:17:45] God's spirit because your spirit is one
[1:17:47] with
[1:17:50] Christ flee fornication see every time I
[1:17:53] read that I get the idea of Joseph right
[1:17:55] Piper's wife is like every day she's
[1:17:56] like sleep with me sleep with me let's
[1:17:59] let's go let's go make love let's do all
[1:18:01] these things and he's just like no no
[1:18:03] and finally the last time he's like I
[1:18:04] just got to run
[1:18:05] away and that's what we should do in
[1:18:08] Temptation run from
[1:18:10] fornication run from it he didn't try to
[1:18:13] listen to it like Samson well tell me
[1:18:15] some more Delila tell
[1:18:17] me he's like no I gotta get out of here
[1:18:20] it's time for a mile run
[1:18:25] that's what we should do church that's
[1:18:26] what the Bible says flee fornication run
[1:18:28] from it every sin that a man doeth is
[1:18:30] without the body but he that committeth
[1:18:32] fornication he sins against his own body
[1:18:34] and I would Al also argue his own soul
[1:18:37] because in Proverbs uh Solomon tells his
[1:18:40] son don't go down to the house of that
[1:18:42] her gates are the gates of
[1:18:45] hell right now we know people can be
[1:18:47] saved from adultery like David right but
[1:18:48] few very few will find the narrow road
[1:18:50] that leads to Life Church there's over
[1:18:53] 30 STDs
[1:18:55] there's over
[1:18:56] 30 right that's why we that's why people
[1:18:59] uh shouldn't go join to harlots and just
[1:19:01] sleep around you should get marry one
[1:19:02] person and stay married your whole
[1:19:04] life the worst ones are
[1:19:07] AIDS now AIDS attacks your immune
[1:19:11] system and it could be fatal if it goes
[1:19:14] untreated now we know Magic Johnson of
[1:19:15] course that came out when I was a boy
[1:19:17] well teenager and he's still living
[1:19:19] because he had all the money to buy the
[1:19:20] it's called Art therapy but if you don't
[1:19:23] have the money for that you're going to
[1:19:24] die die you are going to die the second
[1:19:27] most serious one is syphilis it leads to
[1:19:29] uh damages the heart brain and other
[1:19:31] organs it's only curable in the early
[1:19:34] stages so if they don't catch it right
[1:19:35] away they
[1:19:36] die HPV is uh cervical throat and other
[1:19:43] cancers there's no cure for those
[1:19:45] infections once they got it it's a total
[1:19:48] judgment on them just like God said you
[1:19:50] sin against your own body you destroy
[1:19:53] God's Own Temple when you don't care of
[1:19:55] take care of your sexual uh
[1:19:57] passions Hepatitis B and C they cause
[1:20:00] chronic liver disease therosis and liver
[1:20:04] cancer all from sexual
[1:20:09] imorality they should I shouldn't say
[1:20:11] that here and herpes is a uh reoccurring
[1:20:15] sores and their
[1:20:17] lifelong but it's living with the mental
[1:20:20] uh Agony and the quality of life is
[1:20:22] totally destroyed all because of a
[1:20:25] few moments of pleasure and Paul said
[1:20:28] run from that you young people run from
[1:20:33] that so see for for some people this
[1:20:37] this helped me with my struggle some
[1:20:38] people need to see some people that are
[1:20:39] so sad because they've got
[1:20:42] STDs if that's your struggle you hang up
[1:20:44] a picture
[1:20:46] well be be as discreet as you can but
[1:20:48] hang up a picture of somebody that's
[1:20:49] crying weeping over all the pain from
[1:20:51] these STDs or death put up a put up a
[1:20:53] grave there died of age
[1:20:55] do something to try to overcome Draw N
[1:20:58] to God and God will draw n to you what
[1:21:00] is that that's the fear of the Lord
[1:21:02] hallelujah the fear of the Lord is to
[1:21:04] hate evil
[1:21:07] Hallelujah sorry about this thing I get
[1:21:09] a new one finishing up here what know
[1:21:12] you not your body is the Temple of the
[1:21:14] Holy Ghost which is in you which you
[1:21:16] have of God and you're not your
[1:21:19] own you can't do whatever you want
[1:21:22] because you didn't bring yourself here
[1:21:24] you can't do whatever you want God sent
[1:21:25] you here God gave you life God gave you
[1:21:28] breath you are not your own you are
[1:21:31] God's Property hallelujah amen because
[1:21:34] you were bought with a price you were
[1:21:36] bought with the precious blood of Jesus
[1:21:38] Christ Hallelujah am he purchased you on
[1:21:41] calvary's tree he said it is finished
[1:21:43] that's legal terms for it is paid and
[1:21:45] full I have paid the price for the
[1:21:48] Forgiveness of their sins I took the
[1:21:50] penalty of their sins that they could
[1:21:51] take on my righteousness and forgiveness
[1:21:54] of sins sin you were bought with the
[1:21:57] price there therefore glorify God in
[1:22:00] your body and your spirit which is our
[1:22:02] which are
[1:22:04] Gods Church think about what's the most
[1:22:06] important thing you've ever bought
[1:22:07] probably a house or how about your car
[1:22:10] when I bought those two cars I got that
[1:22:11] I own right now I promised God I said
[1:22:13] God if you help me pay these off early I
[1:22:15] will wash these and take care of them
[1:22:16] and sweep them out and boy do
[1:22:18] I now sometimes I slack a little bit but
[1:22:22] why brother Mercy it was such a problem
[1:22:24] price I said I don't really want to
[1:22:26] spend my money on this you know but I
[1:22:28] want something that's reliable I don't
[1:22:30] want things breaking down all the time
[1:22:31] but I paid such a price that I'm willing
[1:22:33] to really go to the lengths to keep this
[1:22:35] in good condition because such of a
[1:22:36] price was paid and if we could only
[1:22:39] apply that to our spiritual State such a
[1:22:41] price was paid for me that I could have
[1:22:44] the the love of God eternal life then
[1:22:46] helped me to take care of my temple
[1:22:48] Hallelujah help me to glorify God
[1:22:50] everything I say everything I do help me
[1:22:53] to run from Evil flee from Evil that's

[1:25:56] they're under a power of any evil spirit
[1:25:58] I pray they will start fighting against
[1:26:00] it in the name of Jesus Christ may they
[1:26:03] resist Satan and Satan will flee in my
[1:26:08] case it took some weeks or months but
[1:26:10] Lord I kept resisting and you gave me
[1:26:12] Grace other people have had testimonies
[1:26:14] they just laid down their bottle one day
[1:26:15] and they're done with drinking the rest
[1:26:17] of their life Lord but you're the Great
[1:26:19] Mighty conqueror you're the Great Mighty

[1:26:28] give us

[1:26:40] Jesus God we thank you for overcoming
[1:26:43] power today I pray our teenagers could
[1:26:45] have the baptism of the Holy Ghost in
[1:26:47] those high schools I pray our adults and
[1:26:50] parents could have the baptism of the
[1:26:51] Holy Ghost in our homes so the children
[1:26:54] can see what the real spirit of God
[1:26:56] looks
[1:26:58] like a life that's worthy of the Gospel
[1:27:01] granted Lord Jesus those of us who work
[1:27:04] outside the home may we have such a life
[1:27:06] consecrated to Christ that people can
[1:27:09] say that we're filled with the Holy
[1:27:12] Spirit real
[1:27:15] Christians Lord we don't like to say it
[1:27:17] but may we live such a life where our
[1:27:18] works condemn the Sinners or maybe we'd
[1:27:22] say it convicts the sinners and they
[1:27:24] want to get saved Lord

[1:27:29] given will
