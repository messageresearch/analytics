tonight at brother Samuel brownings in Sheffield so we got leave here by 4 okay so we normally have two Services every Sunday so we're going to the second one's at 3:00 so we're going to move that up to 2:30 so just so you know I'm going to try to shorten the sermon here by God's grace so let's see how that goes Hallelujah so we'll take about an hour here let me set my timer here hope you're enjoying working through the book of Romans by God's grace such a wonderful book and brother Ram said this is a deep book brother Ram said uh Paul couldn't preach these types of things to the Corinthian Church because it's so deep and we're not trying to be deep like in a prideful way but the Bible said the spirit searches the Deep things yay the Deep things of God so we're taught from the scripture that the Holy Ghost will guide us into deeper things and that's what we want we want a more personal walk with the Lord how many you want that like God I don't want a superficial walk like I kind of know God I want a deep walk with the Lord or we can really know we are the bride of Christ all you husbands know you whispered all these secrets made all these promises to your bride before you took her and I'm sure you make some more now that's your married like honey I promise I'll take you out this summer for a little getaway that's what I'm telling my wife some of you help me out with that by God's grace but we whisper these secrets right these personal things that's how I want to know Jesus praise God Amen I want to know I want to know him that well where he whispers his love secrets to us hallelujah amen amen amen Romans here uh chapter 8 I think we'll start at verse three I just want to read uh 3 four and five by God's grace you know last Sunday we looked at the righteousness U of the New Testament we're not under the condemnation of the Old Testament we're under the righteousness the ministry of righteousness Paul calls it and it's Jesus Christ sharing his righteousness with us praise God amen amen we have no no boasting in heaven we can't brag on anything in heaven uh all the righteousness comes from Jesus Christ he makes us righteous it's imputed to us as a substitutionary sacrifice our sin was placed upon him his righteousness comes Upon Us Praise Goden hallelujah we're robed in his righteousness Romans 8:3 for what the law could not do in that it was weak through the flesh God sending his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh and for sin condemned sin in the flesh that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the spirit God bless you may God has blessings to read his word you may be seated I know that's why you're here Church you're walking after the things of the spirit how many want more things of the spirit you know we get so wrapped up in carnal things you know we just have to we have to take care of insurance and bills and uh eating and feeding ourselves and taking care of our families uh and it's such a blessing to have the the Holy Spirit move in spiritual Supernatural ways how many look for Spiritual things in your life amen amen remember like I preached a few weeks ago brother said he would approach a new year and he'd lay out a thousand imitations he said he'd lay them out on a table and he'd say Lord direct me to which ones and he he said I I go for a drive I go for a walk and I pray and talk and wait for God to give him some type of inspiration praise God and to me church that's the simple humble way that if that's how a prophet look for inspiration that's how we can look for inspiration praise God Amen yes we pray we read our Bibles and we're dedicated to God but as we go throughout the day we keep our minds focused on the Lord and we look for the inspiration of the Holy Spirit praise God for God to put somebody on your heart or God leading you to go to a certain place we want to be led by the spirit of God hallelujah amen amen now verse three tells us that uh the Bible says here that God sent his own son in the likeness of sinful flesh now it wasn't sinful flesh Jesus never sinned he was tempted at all points but the Bible said he was without sin praise God Amen Hallelujah God sent him like that and of course his flesh brother R said he could have headaches right he could be in the boat trying to sleep off a headache and then the disciples would wake him up and said come speak to the storm he said oh you have little faith he'd have enough uh enough awareness to rebuke the the disciples if you only had a little bit of Faith you could rebuke the storm God help us amen amen help us today hallelujah amen we know he's the same yesterday today and forever praise God so God would encourage us he had to rebuke us to use some of the Godly uh Power and The Godly Authority that he's given to the people of God Amen but the Bible said uh Jesus he took on flesh to condemn sin in the flesh that means he condemned all of our sin he paid for all of our sins that's why the Bible said there's no condemnation to us amen Jesus condemn sin hallelujah it's like Moses with the Brazen serpent brother that said that serpent represented Christ that's what the Bible says right see it represented sin was already judged right amen it already gone through the fires of Affliction right the fires of judgment the serpent had already been and burnt right Jesus went through the fiery uh sufferings of death and and persecution he went through that and when he rose Hallelujah we could look on him like brother said we could look on him in Hallelujah anyone that want to be healed from the serpent bites anyone that want to be healed from any sickness anyone that want to deliver from Death all they had to do was look and live to Christ hallelujah look to the word of God look to Jesus hallelujah how many been healed by Jesus hallelujah how many have looked to the The Serpent and you've lived hallelujah oh thank God that's what our life is is built upon Hallelujah the revelation of Jesus Christ hallelujah amen he condemned sin that's what the cross did it condemns sin so the Bible says we are now under no condemnation let's all say no condemnation can we no condemnation there's no condemnation remember that's a damnatory sentence there's no damnatory sentence to you as you walk in the spirit as you're led by the Holy Spirit as you're believing in Jesus Christ there's no damnatory sentence he he won't look at you and say I never knew you he'll look at you and say I knew you Hallelujah well done I knew you well you are my bride amen you wer just a servant you were my bride HJ that's what that's what the Bible says there's no condemnation there's no damnatory sentence hallelujah amen and that's what Jesus told us in Matthew 7 the reason he looks on the workers of iniquity they never knew him they did they had gifts of God but and they could yield to God for temporary times but they didn't do the will of God but see we're the opposite of that we do the will of God Amen Hallelujah we don't work in it inity when we see iniquity in our lives we say God forgive me I don't want to work it that's right amen I don't want to constantly do iniquity I want to overcome iniquity and if you'll help me do it I'll do it by your grace amen amen cuz the Bible said I can do all things through Christen I can't do all things by my own effort but I can do all things through Christ praise the Lord amen hallelujah not through my works not not by any Works lest any man should boast Hallelujah but it's the power of Christ Hal Hallelujah he said you abide in me I'll abide in you Hallelujah and ask what you will it shall be done for you hallah amen now verse four that the righteousness of the law might be fulfilled in us who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit so in the New Testament we have a power to fulfill the righteousness of Christ when we freely choose to to crucify sin and walk after the Spirit we fulfill the righteousness of the law hallelujah we're walking uh in in obedience to the Holy Spirit In other words we're living a righteous life we're living as we ought to yes we're presented sin or righteousness and because of our love for Jesus because of our appreciation that he died for our sins we choose Holiness amen Jesus said if you love me keep my commands hallelujah it's a love affair Hallelujah and that's how we fulfill the righteous of the La we love the Lord Our God with all of our heart soul mind and strength amen I just feel so discouraged sometimes people say you're legalist and all these things and no if if you're really in love with Jesus you just want to do do what's right that's right your motivation is love Hallelujah he said if you love me how many love him here today Hallelujah then you want to know his commands you want to do his commands God that's right you want to please him you don't want to grieve the Holy Spirit as Ephesians 4:30 says you don't want to grieve the Holy Spirit you want to obey the Holy Spirit yes amen and so that's how we walk in the righteousness of the law it's the Holy Spirit God has forgiven all of our sins and now we walk in the power of the Holy Spirit verse five for they that are after The Flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that after the spirit the things of the of the spirit now we all had days where we're just walk in the Holy Spirit and almost all day how many know that's a great feel praise God amen amen but then there are certain days where we do have to we do we have we have to battle sin right even the Bible said Satan left Jesus for a season well that means he was coming back yes and that means some of us are going to go through difficult Seasons where it seems like Satan is right there all the time where he's got his demon powers right there don't be discouraged just realize you're in a season Hallelujah draw nigh to God he'll draw nigh to you Hallelujah resist Satan he shall flee hallelujah it's a Bible promise you've got a Bible thus say the Lord you mighty men and women Hallelujah we reached on the Mighty Men series last year we're Mighty through the power of God it's the it's the word of God that pulls down strongholds it's the word of God that helps us overcome addictions or or iniquity or depression or whatever it be it's the spirit of God that pulls that down and makes us free in Christ Jesus amenallah so we must not mind the things of the flesh that's why we come to church to get a new mind Hallelujah had a tough week that's fine but let's get our mind back on the things of God hallelujah right see sometimes we do mind the things the flesh but God the previous chapter he said I hate myself right Paul said that I'm a Wretched Man but yet I got no condemnation I Paradise one side I'm wretched one side I never sin in the first place praise God right the real me the part of me from my spiritual DNA from God never sin but I live in this flesh body because I have to have something to overcome I got to get some victory praise God I got to do something Hallelujah I got to bring uh the word of God into reality into my life I I have to manifest Christ I must be identified with Jesus Christ hallelujah amen I've got to overcome in my day Hallelujah we were called to overcome in this hour Hallelujah verse six for to be Carly minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace Hallelujah so uh the emphasis I want to put on here is life and peace life and peace remember we were preaching on the book of Acts we'll get back to that Lord will yes I just been feeling this poll to Romans Lately by God's grace remember they were the apostles were in jail I believe it was chapter 5 and the angel broke them out I like how God breaks his people out of jail hallelujah amen amen hallelujah and they he said go what he said go into a cave and hide he said go back in the public and speak all the words of this life amen hallelujah I mean this is what this is the life of the believer it's a life of of Peace Hallelujah I want to just emphasize that you know recently I talked to a brother I'm going to try not to use as many names here I'm not going to I'm going to try not to address all the trolls I've been addressing the trolls a lot I'm going to try to address the trolls today okay they troll me all the time I'm going to try not to you you watch me brother amen okay you let me know say no trolls no trolls try not to address it it just WS on my heart mind sometimes I don't want to get any bad habits sometimes I feel like it's a warning of the ho Spirit but I don't want to I don't want to focus on the trolls today but you know um this idea of life and peace a young believer recently he and I were talking on the phone we talk for about an hour last week and uh he's uh he's fairly new to the message I'm going try not to say names here but he said uh you know uh some some some a sister Church these people say they got they just received the Holy Ghost and and they come into this brother's church and and and they're they're fresh in the message and they don't know about the Holy Ghost and uh these people that say they got the Holy Ghost are putting all this pressure on the church and people and and I know some of the situations very detail some of the people are going bound depression saying we don't have the Holy Ghost like these people because all these uh things wrong because these people coming in are bringing in all these uh Corrections and all the well this is how it worked for me this is how it worked for me you need to do this and you need to do that and church I just want to bring it out that uh I think people like that they're a little overzealous because it's not producing life and peace the gospel should produce life and peace that's right now is there an element of desperation yes you must have an element of desperation there's times God brings us to desperation amen but these people you know this this new church they fresh into the message and so forth and and and the last thing they need is depression right we got enough depressed people right yes and we can't decide when God's going to fill us with the Holy Ghost we can't speed up our sanctification come on God come on try to speed up a oak tree being Bor or I'm sorry raising not being Bor but an oak tree growing full potential right come on come on you you know the packet said you're going to be uh 100 foot tall come on you're only 2et tall right and so see it's I believe it's a critical spirit or the spirit of Pride that comes in and takes away the joy now one time these same sisters were telling me they wanted to be the first one to dance in the spirit and but now because of this influence and that's why I'm going to preach next week is influences we got to watch the influences the same people that wanted to dance and be freeing the spirit are now depressed because these people are are criticizing their lives let's live a life of Peace Hallelujah let's strengthen one another praise God that's how we know it all amen Carly minded like car like you you know your experience has to match mine brother amen and now everything you do you just need a patter after my no God has a variety hallelujah amen God L of variety Hallelujah some people get the Holy Ghost in the church some people get it in their basement right some people get it in a prayer a prayer meeting yes amen hallelujah you know not everybody's situation is the same but one thing for sure if you're hungry and thirsty after righteousness you shall be failed Hallelujah if you want to feel the wind of the Holy Spirit just wa you don't know when it's coming but it's going to blow Hallelujah you these winds blow last night right right 13 cuz the wind blowing praise God the wind is going to blow hallelujah amen the Holy Ghost is going to move he's going to fall Hallelujah he's going to the Bible said he did not fall upon them yet in Acts chapter 8 by God's grace there's a certain time in season where the Holy Ghost Falls we just must be in position I was reading this morning in second Samuel David got out of a position that's why he fell with basba he was out of position right King Kings go out to war in the springtime yeah hallelujah holy ghost fi Saints keep battling in the war Hallelujah right the war of prayer hallelujah amen the war of worshiping God the spiritual warfare they take on the six pieces of the armor of God David left the war David was out of position we got to stay in position we got to fight the good fight of Faith hallelujah amen that's right I'm not saying you know me there's times we need uh vacations I need a vacation every now and then MH but Springtime was a time for battle you don't you don't go out without the king the king's Your Leader you don't go out to war without the King right but see when he was out of position that's when it happened that's when he became carnally minded and he saw a woman clean herself what is her name out of position but spiritual mindedness is life and peace hallelujah amen see if he would went out to war he would oh this is I have peace with God I'm doing exactly what God called me to do praise God right amen amen now verse seven because the carnal mind is enmity or hatred against God think about that the same man just said I'm a Wretched Man right remember he said earlier in chapter 7 I I bring myself into captivity to sin every time we sin and fall short of God's glory we brought ourselves into captivity we we've let ourselves be enslaved right prison yeah right and Paul said sometimes I do that I just love what he said he said sometimes I do things I hate may God help us to hate the sin that we're struggling with let us lay aside every weight and sin that so easily does be set us hallelujah amen yes it's hatred against God because why it is not subject to the law of God neither can be when we're walking with human thoughts you know will never obey the word of God that's how you know you're walking in the spirit when your mind is like no I got to obey the I got to obey the word what's the word say what's the Holy Ghost say what does God want me to do now you're walking in the spirit praise God but as long as you're Walk In the Flesh you cannot please God that's what the Bible says remember Hebrews 11 here it is in Romans 88 as well so then they there in the flesh cannot please God right right we know that as long as we're uh giving into sin or doing things that we hate we cannot please God but as soon as we confess I heard brother ra say this week as soon as the breath goes out of my lips and I say forgive me he said Jesus has forgiven me praise God that fast it has to be that fast remember in the prayer lines brother would tell them confess your sins now because once you get in the prayer line if you don't confess it then God can see it but as soon as it's confessed God don't see it anymore amen hallelujah praise God that's exactly right they that in the flesh cannot please God and we're not we're not legalist or trying to be perfect but we want to be mature hallelujah amen we want to obey the Lord we want to serve God we want to uh we want to have abundant fruit the Bible said if you abide in Christ you can have much fruit yes amen we want people we want the Saints and even Sinners and we want people around us to know we're Christians am we want to look at each other's life and say wow I can see the fruit of their lives amen I can see the the testimonies coming out of their lives amen hallelujah we we should be each one of us are a tree and as long as we're planted and drinking in the waters of Life we'll push out fruit in every season amen amen some Seasons we got to get pruned up a little bit right knows all about pruning have you pruned meel now gu knows about pruning praise God hopefully all all the rest of them can go over there and work and keep learning about pruning praise God but but there are seasons where we're going to be pruned but let's not be discouraged God's trying to he's trying to uh help us be more obedient remember Jesus learned obedience through the things he suffered if we're suffering it's a good sign God is helping us to obey the word of God hallelujah amen amen God doesn't want us to fall into complacency right right right where the word just doesn't impact us anymore we're not moved by the word of God anymore God doesn't want us to be complacent Hallelujah we cannot please God if we're operating in the flesh Hallelujah now verse n but if but ye are not in the flesh but in the spirit if I like that word if God always puts it in there there's all these conditional Promises of God if so be that the spirit of God dwell in you now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he's none of his now church I I preached this before but you know this even the foolish virgin are his right right if a foolish virgin is able to be virgin to all the word that they know well then they must have the Holy Spirit in their minds right yes not their souls because if they had that they'd be wise virgins Jesus said I'm bringing you rest to your soul right yes they they couldn't have that the Old Testament because the blood of BS and goats right but a foolish bir so so what I'm saying is that some preachers use this and say not even the foolish virgins are saved nonsense right nonsense what about the thief on the cross that was under the law right you said how is the the the how is the thief Jesus's because Jesus said today you'll be with me amen Jesus Took ownership of him right there and says you'll be with me Hallelujah you're mine hallelujah amen because the spirit of Christ was working on him the spirit of Christ was on him enough to say this man's holy we deserve this he don't deserve that see so the the same Thief was belonging to Jesus Hallelujah the spirit of Christ was working on them hallelujah amen that's right see CU in their minds they've obeyed they've accepted the word of God and the Bible said in Ezekiel 36 they have a new heart remember there's three steps to being filled with Holy Ghost new heart new spirit my spirit amen so this deep on the cross truly had a new heart because he wasn't mocking Christ so see he belonged to Christ amen amenallah alah he belonged to Jesus so much that Jesus said you'll be with me in Paradise today praise God yes amen hallelujah amen oh that's a wonderful scripture there by the grace of the Lord now I just have a scripture on my heart and I'm trying to remember what it was going to there by God's grace sorry can't think of it now now if any man have not the spirit of Christ he's none of his we want to belong to Jesus praise God Amen the spirit of Christ work working in our hearts and lives maybe I'll think of it here later Romans 8:10 and if Christ be in you the body is dead because of sin but the spirit is life because of righteousness amen amen amen so see your body is dead because of the sin we must not feed it sinful desires but the spear is life because of righteousness which is right doing the spirit's always going to tell you to do what's right yes amen hallelujah oh my it's beautiful verse 11 but if the spirit of him that raised up Jesus from the dead dwell in you he that raised up Christ from the dead shall also Quicken your mortal bodies by a spirit that dwelleth within you praise God Amen what a promise if the spirit that was in Jesus is in you we like that song it will Quicken your mortal body hallelujah amen amen what a blessing to know and remember church I'm going to go back to this cuz I was studying this go to Romans 6 remember this if you have been baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you are promised a resurrection amen all this ties together Hallelujah Romans 6 4 and 5 therefore we are buried with him by baptism into death that like as Christ was raised up from the dead by the glory of the father even so we also should walk in the newness of Life yes for we have been planted together in the likeness of his death we shall also be in the likeness of his resurrection amen amen so baptism represents the death Jesus paid for all of our sins we we died to ourselves just like Jesus died for us but then Jesus was raised and so will you be raised if you go down in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ you'll be raised in the name of the the Lord Jesus by the spirit of Jesus hallelujah amen like I put on that video yesterday brother ra said I command you he said in the thus sayith the Lord he said in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ he said if you were baptized and father and Holy Ghost I command you to be reapz in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that's a man that knows God hallelujah amen that can say thus sayth the Lord and use the name of the Lord and he's got a scriptural foundation for it hallelujah amen it takes us back to the Bible Acts 19 where they were re-baptized for the baptism of the Lord Jesus Christ amen amen amen so we get this idea here Church Hallelujah you are his if Christ is in you either even through repentance or sanctification we call it justification is repenting you're saved you're forgiven sanctification you're getting Sanctified your daily habits are getting cleaned out you're getting a new mind to serve God and then the baptism of the Holy Ghost God's Spirit dwelling within you you belong to Christ at all three stages yes in fact if you're a true true child of God and your name was on that book before the foundation of the world you always belong to God hallelujah amen you eternally belong to God because he put your name on The Book of Life Hallelujah am and if we're Holy Ghost filled the Lamb's Book of Life amen that other wonderful section amen amen hallelujah now remember what I was thinking of it was 1 Corinthians 15 so keep your spot there I was reminded of this this week uh 1 Corinthians 15 Paul summarizes the gospel so when someone gets saved they need to hear the simple gospel right when I got saved you know I didn't know the message or anything like that I didn't know the message of brother I got saved at a athletes Athletes In Action conference brother Preston that's I wasn't even the message I went down there I was all these I play football in college I was with all these football guys and I seen them raise their hands I'm like God forgive me I need to serve God I repented of my sins right there but I belong to God right there praise God but there was more God wanted to show me praise God thank God for brother Simon Hallelujah now First Corinthians 15 but when you get saved you need this we we need just simple gospel message gospel means good news yes amen see that's why I think many people have fallen away around the message they're taught don't cut your hair don't wear shorts for the brothers don't grow long hair Brothers don't smoke they're taught all this but they're they're never taught the gospel right see they're kind of like fear fear serve God a base of fear I mean it's good to know God's commands But first you got to have a new heart praise God that's right if you just serve god with the Heart of Stone it's just going to be the law all over again that's right right it's just the law the law the law but once you fall in love with him now you got a new heart now you want to you want to obey praise God that's right and I mean I I don't blame preachers and parents tell your kids the word of God tell your kids the word of God but make sure they know the good news the good news that Christ died to save Sinners Hallelujah and we're all Sinners we've all fall of God's grace but God gives us hope if we believe in him he's forgiven our sins and we pass from Death unto life Hallelujah good news in the gospel hallelujah amen amen and here Paul just gives us this a wonderful it's just a summary of The Gospel remember brother said he said I come here in defense of the Gospel of Jesus Christ if you want a good gospel Sermon Just on salvation go listen to Pardon I listen to that this morning pardon uh October 28 1963 brother Ram starts with Romans 8:28 all things work together for good and he's freely given us all things and brother Ram lays out salvation by the blood we're all saved by the blood whether you're Presbyterian or Baptist he said we all find everything in common at the cross amen hallelujah now at the end he brings it he brings it to well now we're established church churches he said but now if if we're just serving God by tradition said if Jesus was here he'd be throwing over some tables with some whip cords and some rope cords right but if you want a good gospel sermon go listen to that one praise I was blessed about yeah amen save salvation gospel it was just as simple you he's careful with those trolls now it's just a simple beautiful gospel message the blood is enough is what I'm saying Jesus is enough H that's right salvation through the blood of Jesus Christ Hall yes if you really love God you want to be Sanctified and have gifts of the Spirit like AA and then you receive brother's message Hallelujah that's right you will praise God if you want to obey the word of God God the Holy Ghost has to guide you into all truth amen praise God but here this is a just a beautiful summary and it meant a lot to me when I remembered it verse one 1 Corinthians 15:1 moreover Brethren I declare unto you the gospel which I have preached unto you which also ye have received and where in you stand so we got to stand in the good news amen amen amen don't let the devil tell you you're not saved say you're not saved right I'm saved Hallelujah right you're the one that's not saved right yes Hallelujah by which also ye are saved if you keep in memory so what do we need constant reminders yes that's my prayer Lord Jesus remind me of your gospel amen remind me of your Saving Grace that I didn't do anything to earn this you gave it to me praise God amen amen you gave me the the most wonderful Christmas present ever salvation and then the baptism of the Holy Ghost then Christ was born in the manger of my soul praise God I heard Brother Don say something really it was funny he said for Christmas he said one of these years they set up the mangor scenes you know and they put the baby Jesus that plastic baby Jesus in the he said what and they they they put it out in their yard and people drive by and there's uh uh baby Jesus in the manger scene he said one of these years I'm going to replace that manger scene and I'm just going to lay out in the yard and I'm going to put that baby Jesus right on top of my soul because that's what happened Christ came into this manger Hallelujah Christ came into your manger he wants to build your he wants to be born in your soul praise God next December man got remind me of that I'll I'll lay out there in the yard for a couple well maybe half hour or something

received how that Christ died for our sins according to the scripture see you don't have to pay for your sins he already paid for them amen amen the simple good news of the Gospel amen anybody want good news when they come to church today you got some good news right there hallelujah amen amen and that he was buried and that he rose again the third day according to the scriptures and that he was seen of sephus then of the 12 and that he was seen of above 500 Brethren at once of whom the greater part remained under this present but some are fallen asleep and after that he was seen of James and then of the Apostles and last of all look how Paul says I'm the least of the servants I'm the least of the Saints because he was the last one to see Jesus and last of all he was seen of me also as one born out of time Hallelujah brother man said numerous times he felt like he was born out of season he should have been alive there at isusa Street not don't know all things but I don't know about that I just think it's beautiful Paul says here I was born out of season I wish I could have walked right there with Christ and then I wouldn't have then why he would not have done all the persecution of the church remember Church don't forget that message you can take revenge on the devil Hallelujah whatever your past looks like use that as motiv don't use it as as depression use your past as motivation to take renge on the enemy praise God right that's what the Bible says second Corinthians chapter 10 I believe having an already Readiness of mind to Revenge uh the things wrong that you've done uh let's let's go look at it I I feel like I'm tearing enough uh 2 Corinthians 10 I believe it is either six or 10 I'm have to look it up if you find it let me know 10 is it 106 thank you second Corinthians 106 thank you appreciate that thank you sister oh yeah I was in the right chapter I just wasn't looking at the right verse verse four for the weapons of our Warfare there's those soldiers Hallelujah are not carnal But Mighty through God through the pulling down of strongholds see God has given us Mighty weapons to overcome our trials we don't have to stay discouraged we don't have to stay uh depressed or addicted we we got Mighty weapons say those walls are pretty strong we got mightier weapons in the wall it's just a wall you got Living God hallelujah it's just a wall that we've allowed to be build up we've got a mighty weapon to pull down these strongholds so we know which one's stronger the word of God is stronger than your strongholds Hallelujah but what you got to do you got to cast down whatever's in your mind cast down any imagination right every High thing if you feel like your head surrounded by a bunch of lies and temptations cast them down amen because they exalt themselves against the knowledge of God and lift up the knowledge of God Amen and bring into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ and having in our Readiness to Revenge all Disobedience see that's the way you overcome addictions and and difficult times and struggles that's the way you overcome it you you have you have to have have this attitude of Revenge I'm not g to

peace hallelujah amen thank you sister good job on that one Hallelujah now now we go back to Romans here yeah that one just came on my heart here praying this morning work that down that's right that's a wonderful summary of The Gospel yes how many believe that by God's amen hallelujah that's what we believe our life is based upon these scriptures praise God if the spirit of God dwells in you whether with J justification sanctification or baptism of the Holy Ghost and you die like that then the spirit of Christ will raise you up Hallelujah you're wise virgin you'll raise up at the first resurrection if you're foolish virgin you'll raise up at the white Throne judgment and Jesus will call you his sheep Hallelujah Hallelujah he'll not call you a goat he'll call you a sheep praise God because his Spirit was in you and you were his on this Earth praise God Amen remember I always go back to this remember in 20 it was in 2015 or 2018 it was during Barack Obama's presidency remember those Isis people raised up and they were killing they were beheading the Christians in front of everybody most of those Christians weren't message Believers but yet they were willing to die for Jesus now you know God will give them the martyr's crown if they're living if they're willing to to lay down their life and say I'm not denying Jesus Christ I'm denying Allah and you know Jesus has a martyr's crown for them hallelujah amen hallelujah CU what what would your faith be if you were put in that situation what would my faith be right we don't want to be prideful uh people and say everyone's got to be be just like me everyone's got to believe exactly what I believe let's recognize the spirit of Christ hallelujah amen let's recognize people that are believing the good news and standing in this Grace where they are called praise God they were called to be Christians there they were called in whatever I think some of them were Anglican if I'm not mistaken I have to go look it up on the news reports Anglican which is pretty close to a Catholic but yet they're willing to give their lives for Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah and surely God has a martyr's crown for them right amen I believe it amen because they believe the good news Jesus said If you deny me before men I'll deny you before the Holy Angels of my father and look they did not deny Jesus before men they got on tape on YouTube and everything all all over the Internet they're willing to give their lives for the Lord and Savior Jesus Christ hallelujah amen amen I know they got a reward Romans 8:12 therefore brethren we are debtors not not to the flesh to live after the flesh Hallelujah so we're not in debt to live more in more sin for if you live after the flesh you shall die but if ye through the spirit do mortify there's that word that crucify right wait wait wait brother Jess you said we have good news and part of the good news is to be mortified yeah that's part of the good news praise amen yes the good news is you're saved by grace but now you got to mortify and crucify the desires of the flesh right amen I thought it's joy unspeakable full of Glory there are seasons of that praise God Amen that's right but there's also Seasons to be tested to be proved to be tried hallelujah amen I was Sister sent me a good text and I went back sister I listened to that sermon from Brother Brooks from 2007 uh because brother Brooks was preaching in our dedication Services it was uh August 11th 2007 I can just remember it for some reason um I can hear a 26y old Pastor brother Jesse saying amen my voice got a little deeper over the years maybe was just bad recording software 2007 but brother Brooks is preaching on how we're like Samson brother preached that he's preaching what brother R preached the church if we give the devil the secrets brother brother Brooks was focusing just like brother on prayer he said if we give up our prayer lives then the devil can beat us up and enslave us right and brother Brook says you know he says uh he says he says you know we'll have a good week of prayer right but then the next week the devil battles us right or we give into the flesh but brother Brook said just keep pressing through he said and you'll get the victory other words leave last week behind have a good week this week amen get the victory this week and then sister uh Karen Sanders she just started screaming shouting pray pray pray listen to the preacher pray pray pray listen to the preacher pray pray pray she said thus sayith the Lord listen to the preacher Amen in other words Church let's be encouraged you had a bad week say you're sorry confess your sins but let's have a good week this week amen thus say the Lord amen because it's the Bible scripture amen amen hallelujah laying aside the things that are in the past press forward toward the mark of the High Calling of God amen amen hallelujah amen I appreciate that sister because I was like wow we don't get many thus at the Lords in our church I don't want to forget that one amen the one time the brother Steven came I was out preaching in Columbus but he said thus say the Lord some of you feel like you're dying spiritually and bang remembers this uh after I got back I heard that on tape I went and asked everybody in church who feels like they're dying spiritually three people said they were dying spiritually I said well let's get right with God Amen as far as know they're all going to church right now they're still in the message amen amen hallelujah we feel ourselves getting weak on God well let's repent let's get back to God Amen how many believe that amen see all that needs to be done those mortify the Deeds of the flesh cast down anything that exalts itself against the word of God and let's take revenge on Satan am amen let's take revenge on the works of iniquity right The Temptations let's take revenge on that in other words let's let's know what God's called us to do and let's go do it praise God Amen my said I like a man of vision he said not a man that sits around and doesn't know what he wants to do I like a man of vision that he he he he's moved to do something he knows what he's called to do for he's got Ambitions hallelujah amen amen hallelujah amen what's your ambition for 2024 well we're how many days we in we're 15 days 14 days in anybody still got any resolutions or got any Revelations which one you got resolutions will come and go Revelations will overcome the Gates of Hell Hallelujah right Revelations I got a friend uh at work you know she's a Christian teacher and we're at bible club and there's all the kids are there we're teaching Bible Club on on on Friday morning we're singing We we dance around my classroom we dance like David dance every week the kids want to sing dance like David is anybody surprised I said I was dancing too i l around I told the brother in the back I said every time I dance I feel like a kid again I I just love this but the the one of the teachers we take turns teaching the children you know their kindergarten before and she said uh she said children she said I learned I can't make nine resolutions in the year I only got to make one I thought there were some there's some wisdom in that you know there's all these things we wish we could get everything right in our lives but let's focus on what's most important praise God you know I guess the reason I'm saying that is cuz she would by the end of the year she feel like she failed why didn't get to all these n but what if you got to two or three right what if you really got victory in two or three those areas amen amen let's look at the good that God's done amen let's remember some of these victories come on Joshua let's have some Memorial praise God God's brought me through he's going to keep leading me on the Hind to God will be with me in the future just like he was with me in the past Hallelujah he's the same yesterday today and forever Hallelujah yes amen but it's through the spirit the spirit the holy spirit is leading us to mortify the Deeds of the flesh I'm looking at the time here so yeah okay Hallelujah you know that the spirit will always lead you to Die daily same man that wrote Die daily in Corinthians he wrote this here mortify the Deeds of your flesh take up your cross daily and follow him now last Sunday I ended with the joint a thought hope you enjoyed that by God's grace this week I'm going to I felt led as I was listening this week to brother I want to skip down to Romans 8:28 I want to close with a few I know I'm saying closed pretty early aren't I what's going on brother nothing I'm trying to watch the CL Romans 8:28 for we know that all things work together for good to them that love God yes Amen to them who are called according to his purpose same man that said I hate things I do I'm a Wretched Man yet I have no condemnation now he says all things work together for for good even his struggles would work together for good amen right like that I wrote down some thoughts here I was just praying up here I thought oh that's right I want to share with a few of these thoughts God even uses our mistakes right to glorify God Amen brother Ram said Moses sent out the two spies he said Joshua I'm sorry the 12 spies he said Joshua learned from that and he didn't send out 12 Spies he learned from it so even our mistakes right even the mistakes of the Prophet can help us to do what's right amen hallelujah amen let's look at some other examples I thought even Elisha when he died you know he Elisha didn't get raptured up into heaven he died of an awful disease but even that worked out to good his bones were laying there and they threw a dead man on his bones and the anointing that was still on that body brought this man back to life and that fulfilled the 16 Miracles Elisha had to have because he had a double portion of God's spirit so even death even in death there's a purpose in that all things work together for good Hallelujah even his death all the sufferings and the place where he was laid everything has a purpose and church if all that has a purpose what about us being here today am like I tell Naomi be all the time God sent you 5,000 miles just to our church of all the churches it could have been that many churches why here well cuz God has a purpose we're called according to his purpose PR amen like I told you last week I could have went to AIO state to play to run track instead of football at aan well God had a purpose I had to come to akan I didn't know akan from anything on the world you know I guess it was a Pennsylvania accur too I didn't know that it could have been any place but God has a purpose and everything will work together for good if you love God how love God today just love God obey God keep God's commands believe the gospel and everything will work out for your good Hallelujah am amen hallelujah there's a we've been reading through the book of generations thank you again brother Jose I keep thanking you till we get done and I'll thank you that I'm sure one of the brothers said he said uh every time we were sick he said we call brother for any little thing and he said God answered all his prayers he said but we learned to lean too much on brother Brandon he said that's why I think God took brother brandom off the scene so even so all things work together for good God lets our prophet die in a car accident 1965 but this brother says it taught us to lean on the holy spirit amen and not so much on a man and the church say yes am amen all things work together for good Hallelujah remember David's Disobedience he brought the ark up this is one of the most fresh lyia sh with me but even in that Aza died how awful that was but as part of that David he learned to obey the scriptures the next time the ark at least the ark then the ark at least finally got into its rightful place in Jerusalem because of the mistake and then obad Ed got blessed for three months right in the midst of mistakes there's always a blessing praise God there's always a purpose God wants us to learn God wants us to see everything works together for good Hallelujah a I texting he was say saying how Ecclesiastes has been meant a lot to him lately amen I love that book you got to have a spiritual mind though when you read that he'll say like there was nothing good in anything I did Under the Sun yet the Bible says we should be zealous for good works yes right right so he's coming from an old man perspective of he wasted a lot of years yeah right so we got to take we got to right divide that but I love what brother brother Austin was sharing there and I think I'm just going to read it I'm going to go to Ecclesiastes 12 you know you would think look at all the mistakes of Solomon's life the idolatry the wars remember he bow two adversaries because he he didn't obey God God raised up two adversaries on purpose and God told him I'm going to raise these two men up because of the evils you've done with idolatry multiplying wies and then even God uses that as a type it was a mistake but God you all things work together for good amen please ask you 12 and this is what I'm talking about you know sometimes the enemy tries to distract us away from the Simplicity of the Gospel which we love the Simplicity and we also want the deeper things of God like like Paul said Church what we want is the whole counsel of God lord don't leave any of your wisdom out I want all the wisdom amen because wisdom builds her house that's right I want God to build a testimony I I want God to build uh Christian testimonies in this house Hallelujah in our church what's the conclusion of the matter see all things work together for good you know Solomon tried to find uh happiness in women in building things in riches and all these things that he had and he found I cannot find happiness in any of it so he said let us hear the conclusion of the whole matter fear God and keep his Commandments for this is the whole duty of man you think Solomon has any regrets I imagine his life was filled with regrets but it all work together for good because he loved the Lord and the church these are his last words amen hallelujah these are his last words recorded in holy RIT and what's the last thing you share with the family fear God respect God keep his commands Hallelujah for God shall bring every work into judgment with every secret thing whether it be good or whether it be evil amen but this encourages God help us to get our secret sins under the blood of Jesus Christ Hall any secret thing anything we're doing wrong let's make it right by the grace of God let's know that God forgives let's know that God Saves that God heals that God fills with the Holy Ghost that God makes everything perfect in his time hallelujah amen amen hallelujah all things work together for good y to them that love the Lord now I finally feel feel like preaching now like I'm trying to feel religious now here's brother's prayer after someone died in a plane crash think of that we've had that in the message there's some brothers out west that died in a prayer in a plane crash years ago when I first come in the message it was a pastor and his sons died in Arizona in a plane crash and when I first come in the message brother Preston that was hard for me to hard for me to understand all like all I knew was wow revelation God sent the prophet Miracles all and then you get this news you're like wait what I was just a baby babies don't understand everything neither do lot of 43 year old babies I'm 43 but this just meant a lot to me brother this is from ex expectancy 1952 in Battle Creek Michigan he said the brother has been in an airplane crash and been killed it's Ben and Florence Smith and then he said here's special prayer brother BR a man who's in the hospital that's only 42 that's right let's bow our heads and pray for these now the reason I'm reading this is because brother Brandon brings out Romans 828 so I want you to see how a prophet of God how would he bring out Romans 8:28 in the moments of Unexpected death or things that are just hard to understand how could all things work together for good to them that love the Lord he said heavenly father I pray you look down here on this desk this afternoon actually you know what I can put these quotes up here so then you guys can see it you can read along that would help you I don't know I like to do that many times along with me and you see these people oh I think of that bereaved home of that man being killed in that crash God all things work together for good to them that love you he just died in a plane crash and he thinks of that home what does that home feel like right now right after the plane crash and he quotes Romans 8:28 trusting that his soul was right with you and today he wouldn't return if he had to think of that stepen after he got Stone he would not have come back if he could if he was asked to he'd take his choice he'd stay where he's at I pray that he was saved Lord that you'll Comfort all his loved ones you think you know let's say he had some moments before the he knew the plane was going down do you think he probably cried out to God I would hope so if he was trained in the Bible or the message or something God gives opportunities where we can make things right I pray that you'll Comfort all his loved ones and let them know that he said I would not have you in your brethren concerning those things that are that those that are asleep for we believe that Christ died and rose again the third day even so them that sleep in Christ should God bring with him that's first Thessalonians 4 how is brother going to understand this how's he going to help the people Romans 8:28 and also first Thessalonians 4 you'll see your loved ones again hallelujah amen amen amen we believe that Lord he said wherefore Comfort one another with with these words you'll see them again Hallelujah and we believe it's the truth and if this Earthly Tabernacle we Des all we have one already waiting to move into one not made with hands but God himself has made us a body that when these Spirits shall be set free from this one we go to that glorious body realizing that one day that the blood of the bulls and goats and sheep covered sin but the blood of Jesus Christ takes it away and we go straight into the presence of God from a plane accident right into the presence of God amen amen think they were sad about it I mean you might had a little fear in that moment everybody would have been fearful in a plane crash but they go right from that moment the the moment of the impact right to the presence of God Amen Hallelujah he said how we thank you for this oh no wonder we can stand Fearless Lord how many want to be Fearless today amen amen I told you before sometimes I fear about 2024 if these government leaders did this in 2020 what are they going to do now I don't know right we we have to trust God we have to be Fearless yes amen right no wonder because we have the vision the word of God we have the Assurance of the Holy Spirit and he's here to vindicate and prove God's power to us that he loves us and is with us in these dark hours of the closing of the world's history this other man here Lord in the hospital I pray you heal him may your spirit be upon him and deliver him this afternoon and may his testimony cause others in that hospital just to get up and walk out and be made well Grant it father so whatever situation may God Comfort the the the greeting people in the in the home and may God heal people in the hospital right Jose was in the hospital a couple years ago they didn't expect him to get out but he's out by God's grace amen Jose told me last Sunday I said brother how you feeling did you say brother something like this is the best I felt in a while didn't you tell me something like that Hallelujah am God's heard our prayers Hallelujah by God's grace May there be an oldfashioned meeting somehow some way Lord break through here in America and do great things before our Lord comes we ask it in night in Jesus name and didn't he do that church Hallelujah 13 more years God did great things he opened the seals preach marriage and divorce anoint the on in the end times the seven Church ages my God so much God finished the mystery of God God was still working and all things work together for good to them that amen I think it's beautiful how brother R always wanted to preach marriage and divorce listen to the tapes he always wanted to preach it even in the the early 60s he'd say one of these days I'm going to preach it and God allowed him to preach it before he took him off the scene I love that because God will not take you till he's finished with you amen amen how many think God has something for you to do left right right some of us are younger there must be a lot for us to do praise God by the grace of the Lord may God do great things before our Lord comes that's saving Souls that's filling people with the Holy Ghost that's laying hands on the sick and they shall recover hallelujah amen amen that's one of the five identifications of the church brother Mark 16 in action that's one of the five identifications you got the right Doctrine the right baptism uh the signs wonders and miracles I forget the other two but brother says that's what she's got she's got Mark 16 in action Hallelujah the Holy Ghost follows us cuz we're Believers amen amen amen now here's another one I'll just I'll finish with this one because I'm almost on my hour I got two minutes left on my hour I'm going to try to keep my word here I never want to break my word I mean you understand what I'm saying what I'm saying is sometimes I wish to close early but the Holy Spirit takes us a little longer and notice I said the holy spirit amen cuz you would know if it wasn't the Holy Spirit we'd be sinning right he'd be sitting there like come on brother you're sinning or you're preaching false Doctrine right right so that's how we know it's the Holy Spirit if you're being blessed it's the Holy Spirit if I'm preaching false Doctrine it's the devil I should have closed early but how many know I'm teaching the truth today by yes amen by the grace of the Lord so I just thought here here's a uh now this brother was a deacon at at uh brand Tabernacle so before brother preaches this and brother BR calls this one of the highlights of his message here uh Blasphemous names this is one of the tapes that I believe I'm not mistaken he kept he kept secret and they released it after he died there was a 11 brother Morris show me that picture I got on my phone somewhere it was such a such a direct harsh sermon he said I'm not releasing this to the public because it was so uh against denominational Spirits right which is the Antichrist Spirit right but he said one of the first things I want to say the passing of our gracious brother Taylor while we were gone so brother brother Ram wasn't there for the funeral brother Neville did the funeral brother Taylor had been coming to church for years and years all of us knew I'm sure but if there' be some strangers here it was that precious Old Gentleman that always found you a seat to sit down brother Taylor last time I saw him now until I see him until I see him a young man he was standing there at the door about three or four Sundays ago he said I'd like to have some books brother brandom i' like to distribute these books think about that what's your last memory of some people that pass on what's your last memory the last ask memory of this man can I have some more books to pass out to people can I share the gospel a little more if God takes us early may that be one of our testimonies amen the last thing you remember about me I wanted to win souls I wanted people to hear the message I want them to know the same Jesus that I know praise God Amen what a beautiful Story the last thing he remembers can I have some more books to pass out to can you help me try to save some Souls that's precious he wasn't arguing about something right he wasn't arguing condemning brother Bram or something like that he was asking for books to save Souls what I understand he had diabetes and went in a coma and not knowing he had the diabetes when he died he never died he just went to be with the Lord Jesus talking to the soul right because death means separation right that's what brother's talking about and he was faithful a wonderful brother now think about this all things were together for good and these are the last words a prophet would say about you like think about this if this was you a faithful wonderful brother always mindful of other people like I I remember when my grandmother Garza Julia Garza died everybody that got up there to say a word about her said every time you left her house she gave you food or gave you money or gave you something every time you left her house she was always giving you something on the way out that was her testimony she and was faithful to church took her family to church all these things and that's very similar to this brother here always mindful of other people see cuz why he had eternal life right when you have eternal life you're mindful of other people you don't live for yourself you live for others how many want to do that my God Amen I like to hear those amens here and you know maybe when we cross over the bar wouldn't it be nice to see brother Taylor there and he'd find us a place to sit down on the other side oh if he's a deacon in life he'll be a deacon afterlife sound like Samuel he was a prophet in life he was a prophet after life he told Saul you'll be with me tomorrow I wonder if there's deacons in heaven Hallelujah I think in commemoration of brother Taylor I wasn't here to speak it with brother Neville at his funeral but I want to say a word of my appreciation to his widow sister Taylor iose is here somewhere this morning bless her loyal heart so we see a man who's always mindful of others and we see a loyal wife MH brother Taylor one day he said come up and see me I got a little Lake dug up here put some fish in it so you come up and fish always mindful of somebody else and there was someone mindful of him that was Christ to give him salvation Hallelujah that's that's the only reason anything good can be in our lives is because of what Jesus did for us amen I think in commemoration yet for this church as it gathers in the body this morning let us Stand Together bow our heads before God our heavenly father we as human beings this morning and the comers to this place and worship thy great hand has moved Among Us and taken from us one of our precious brothers who we love and know that thou did love him and you had a reason for this Lord all this Lord or it would not have happened in this way knowing that our Bible tells us that all things work together for good to them that love God and that he did a man dies of diabetes didn't know he had diabetes but all things work together for good to them that love the Lord there's a certain coworker I have and uh she was telling me how her dad passed young I think it was 52 young and uh in the story you know their family was poor and they're they're I think they're Catholic I'm not mistaken and brother had a lot of success praying for the Catholic how many heard that on the table especially listen to Seven Seals brother talks about the Catholics had faith in brother Ram's gift they had confidence in brother Ram's gift and God heard many of the catholic's prayers which is interesting but in the story they were on hard times and all of a sudden uh the husband died and they found out after the autopsy he died of cancer he never let them know so the the wife is like there goes my money he he's he's the bread winner just out of nowhere he just he wouldn't go to the hospital act like everything was okay just I'm a little sick today died of cancer he you know uh and then the little he had little daughters they didn't have Dad anymore and I'm just struggling along for I think it was like 6 months or something like that just struggling along and especially financially they're really struggling like what about the house what about this how are we going to make it out of this and relying on everybody else and then one day in the mail they got a check in the mail for half a million dollars from a life insurance policy and I thought wow what a good example of all things work together for good to them that love the Lord the man and he was a Catholic man so apparently once he got sick he took out insurance policy to take care of his family he didn't want to go through all the uh the chemo and everything like that and he wanted his family to be taken care of I thought that's a pretty Gallant thing to do to make sure his family's taken care of now he might have got a couple extra years you know on the the chemo treatments but you know to each his own right each his own I just thought that's another good example of all things work together for good to them that love God and like said do you think that man if he's in heaven if he's in heaven do you think he' want to come back back here no there's no way once you have a taste of eternal life you think you want to come back like brother said he said imagine being a pig living in a pig pen and then then he said being a human would you ever want to go back to the pig life no the church said that's what brother say it's like a pig life down here the stinking Pig living inside of our members right sin the sin that dwells within our members the dirty sin that dwells in our members not me but the sin that dwells within me we look around the world we find nature and every way speaking to us and the grave cannot hold him brother Taylor amen amen for on Earth he served the purpose that you sent him here to do he was a good loyal brother am we find that in the life of bodyy life and the life of that sun that rise of a morning to give us light in the middle of the day it becomes at a middle age I'm trying to finish up here this the last qu in the middle of the day becomes a middle age and then the evening it dies again only to rise again the next morning fresh and new because it served God's purpose brother Brooks used that quote when he preached my wife and I's wedding to talk about the godhead he said the son the same Sun that rise in in the morning is the same Sun at noon time not a second son not a third son or a second person the same son he said then the sun of the evening is not a different sun it's the same Sun but there's three phases Morning Noon night he said the same one that died rose again rise again the next morning God I around and some the people like yeah you got to hear the message praise God even at a wedding you got to

then in the face of all nature in the Bible the promise of the Holy Spirit we can gladly rejoice in our heart to know that our brother Taylor likewise Lord serve God God's purpose and to say that he would not rise again would be to deny our Bible Our God and all things that God has given us to look at to know that there is a resurrection so we're looking forward to the time when we shall see him again when he's young and healthy and never know no more to be sick or get old bless his precious wife that loyal companion of his how that we will miss them Lord long as we see them going together
