so thank you brother and i requested my family to sing that one this morning too praise god i was telling them we just got to keep investing in our gifts you know we got to be faithful with the talents that the lord has given to us praise god so we've got to keep investing thank the lord for that greetings in the name of the lord jesus christ it's good to see the saints today brother shang it's good to see him let's give him a round of applause god bless you sir [Applause] great to see buddy been praying for you so god richly bless you buddy thank the lord for his grace let's go to one i think i'd like to read out of three portions of scripture this morning if it would be all right i'll just try to quickly get to the word joshua chapter one we're looking at i think part three of this little series here on the book of joshua i had three or four vindications yesterday when i was studying uh i talked to different people on the phone and talking to different people they kept saying things about being strong and needing god's strength and overcoming fear and so i just knew it was the i feel like this is the right way to go i'm feeling it so it would please the lord this morning to look at this little thought here joshua chapter 1 praise god let's look at verse five we'll just read five only want to start with this thought of how god promised to never leave joshua he promised to be there with him faithfully continually so let's read verse five together one two three there shall not any man be able to stand before thee all the days of thy life as i was with moses so will i be with thee i will not fail thee neither for safety i'm sorry nor forsake me go to hebrews 13 verse 5. let's read that so we have the old testament version of god saying i'm never going to leave you and here's the new testament version where god said i'll never leave you of course there's others jesus said i'm with you lo i'm with you alway even to the end of the world but hebrews 13 says jesus is with me i'm glad to know christ is here this morning amen because he promised hebrews 13 5. he's here for many reasons but we'll see in verse five and six i'll just read verse five and six myself let your conversation be without covetousness and be content with such things for he has said i will never leave thee nor forsake thee here's a new testament writer saying god is going to always be with us and never forsake us now let's read verse six together one two three so that we may boldly say the lord is my helper and i will not fear what man shall do unto me so god's presence brings such a confidence that we're not afraid what any man can do to us no man or woman shall be able to stand before us all the days of our life amen let's read one more uh james the next book hebrews james five seven through eight and i sent brother bang a text to get his uh memory verse ready for march by god's grace so we have a couple more services in february we'll move on to march if the lord terry's here james 5 this is our memory verse and as we said may god write this upon the tables of our heart here let's read this psalm three one two three be patient therefore brethren unto the coming of the lord behold the husbandman waiteth for the precious fruit of the earth and have long patience for it until he received the early and latter rain beat your hearts for the thing of the lord draweth not let's have a word of prayer if you have a unspoken need on your heart let's just make it known unto the lord somehow heavenly father we just come again in your presence we're so encouraged by this word already lord god you promised you'd never leave us or first nor forsake us lord and the scripture says men swear by something greater than themselves but lord you couldn't do that you couldn't find anything greater than yourself so you swore by yourself so thank you lord for your unfailing promises from the eternal one from the all-powerful one from the almighty one the almighty god tells us he never leaves us nor forsakes us we thank you for your presence lord god that we feel this morning just speak to us in a special way lord and i pray your holy ghost we'll have preeminence lord bless each and every soul here our visitor brother shang all the saints lord that are here those live streaming god just have your way let your spirit give us the word of life that we're so hungering for in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're seated there praise god i had to go in my office there because i just want to pull out that uh dictionary real quick i'll probably get to that just a little bit i mentioned that a little bit last year i mentioned that a little bit this year as well for this service here so i think we can switch over here i like to show some quotes i hope this will be okay you know i've been mentioning the last few weeks about um how god told joshua no matter what uh he would never leave him right he would never leave him nor forsake him and and uh we're told brother branham tells us that that no matter when we make mistakes or failures as long as we confess our sins and say we're sorry god will never leave us and so we want to i just want to look at that thought of course that's jordan uh before it would uh or that was that's what it looked like you know kind of when joshua would would walk in there and the waters would move back it was such a mighty river at that time but god god uh broke it of course divided it uh so i want to just briefly review you know the last two services we looked at four apple four different applications to joshua and uh then last week we showed joshua's character before he became the leader i like his character he's just quick to get an army ready the very first thing we hear he's ready to go fight the next day he said get an army ready you're fighting amalek the next day then we see him he just wants to spend time at the house of god just in god's presence and uh seeking god's face it's such a beautiful picture of the believer today that they just want to spend time in god's presence amen and so uh today i want to take a couple of thoughts i want to look at two thoughts that are kind of within this application uh the first application of how crossing jordan for joshua represents us crossing into the new birth or the born-again experience uh the baptism of the holy ghost this third work of grace i want to look at a couple of thoughts going into this this first thought that god never forsakes you despite your failures uh so if you make a mistake god's not gonna leave you forever right of course the bible says after chasing you like a child affect you but he's never gonna leave you right he's never going to forsake you and i'm looking at brother branham's example here and then i want to hope to end by this i hope to end with this understanding your position in the promised land the holy ghost baptism i just kind of want to review a few thoughts on that by god's grace so let's start with this now i want to remember this from uh last week you know god told joshua as i was with moses so will i be with you i will not fail thee nor forsake thee right and he sells and be strong and of courage now brother adam says that uh he said i'm going to skip down here what a consolation must have been to joshua when he heard god say as i was with moses so i'll be with you although if i'm trying and i fail god won't leave me i don't have much confidence in anybody that's too afraid to do anything i'd rather be found a failure than too lazy to try so the the issue is with laziness we we all know we've got something to do but we've all got to overcome the fear uh that satan is bringing at us or the laziness temptation right so we've got to overcome fear and we've got to overcome the lazy spirit amen how many warriors we got here this morning that want to they want to be strong and they want to be active praise god amen they don't want to be sitting on the sideline they want to be out on the front lines amen so we got two things we got to overcome we got to overcome fear and the bible said perfect love casts out all fear so if we're scared of something we got to go back and remember our first love we gotta and that's jesus christ amen hallelujah the love of jesus christ the fact that he loved me first he died for me first he died to save me first and then i recognized that then i love him amen and no man can stand before me or you all the days of our life now i want to bring this up too he said god don't hold you responsible for your mistakes he only holds you responsible for your willful sin okay so i want to just want to just look at this for a moment here because i want to look at the example of william branham here uh but he says and then he quotes a scripture he that sends you the truth but a man that's going to do something right oh i hate the blunder right so do you we hate to blunder but we got to realize we're human we're going to blunder we're going to embarrass ourselves sometimes right we're going to make a blunder we're going to feel like we've disgraced christianity we've disgraced god but he says you're going to fall you're going to make mistakes but if you're really divinely called and god's in your heart you'll rise again amen amen in other words you won't quit praise god amen if you if you really feel god's love in your heart and you know god's called you to do something even if you make a mistake you're going to try again amen amen hallelujah that's why you know some of my sermons may fall to the ground brother shank sleep while i'm preaching and it may and it's my fault many times it may be my fault right but that's not but that doesn't going to stop me from going to pray more it's not going to stop me from going to fast and seek god's face and and live in this bible praise god until it becomes more of a reality to me that my life can be a blessing that the light of christ can reflect off of me and people can see the light of jesus through me praise god amen it's never going to stop me no matter how many mistakes i make we're all going to blunder right everyone's going to fall short you're never going to find a perfect christian the only perfect one is jesus christ amen that's the one we're all following we're all trying to strive to be like jesus but we're all going to stumble but we've all got to learn to take up our cross again follow jesus never give up and give everything we have to the lord amen amen now i want to um look at now here's the scripture that brother graham's quoting now look this is hebrews 10 because this is the covenant of course this is the new the new covenant after the old is vanished away the curse of the law he said the new covenant i'll make with them after those days saith the lord i love this i'll put my laws into their hearts and in their minds will i write them amen church if we got the word on our minds we should be thinking about it right if you if god if you let god write the word on your heart and your mind then it should be on your thoughts all the time right and there are sins and iniquities well i remember no more what a blessing man now where remission of these is remission means sending away right just like you send a letter away or you send something back to the company this doesn't fit i'm going to send it back you remit that you send it away right well that's what the bible says the remission of sins is there's no more offering for sin praise god hallelujah so there's no more uh condemnation to them that are in christ jesus now notice the next verse is now here's where we get to this idea now we're forgiven as long as we confess them but then the bible says we've got to we've got to not forsake the assembling of ourselves together as some is this week i talked to a man in canada and he's uh he doesn't go to church anymore he said i don't see any benefit to it and he said we're gonna he said i'm gonna be ready for the rapture i said no you're not i said you got you have to assemble at church if you want to go in the rapture praise god you've got to because you've got to be with the body jesus christ is the head right this this imagery but you and i are the body amen he's the head the head is in heaven but the body of jesus christ is here on earth and we've got to be a part of that body amen we can't say we're not a part of that body we've got to find our place in the body and we've got to do our job we've got to serve our function we've got to serve our purpose in the body of christ amen we can't be cut off or attached to it or detached from the body we've got to be a part of the body we've got to be feeding the body strengthening the body cleaning the body helping the body amen we've all got a part to play in the body of christ in other words i need you in my life and you need me and your life praise god we need one another in our lives we're going to sharpen each other like like the children i've been seeing right we're going to sharpen one another with the word with testimonies with with scriptures we're going to sharpen one another we're going to build one another up because we're a body and we're growing together and we're growing up the bible said into him praise god amen see we don't forsake god but we exhort or we encourage one another and the more we do it more as you see the day approaching so we should see ourselves gathering more coming to church i preach on that all the time so i'll move on for if we sin willfully after that we receive the knowledge of the truth there remaineth no more sacrifice for sin so this is the same chapter as we read earlier right the bible says you're if you write the word of god upon your heart all your sins are remitted but then it says a few verses later but if you purposely sin and do it on purpose and forsake the body of christ there's no more sacrifice for your sin because you've left it you you've left the sacrifice right and we don't want to leave it we want to stay right stay right there with it praise god amen and all that's left for someone that leaves the body of christ and doesn't go to church and and sins willfully they live a life of iniquity the only thing that's left for them is a fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries so in other words the house of god is where you find mercy praise god amen this is where you find god's mercy amen this is where the blood of christ is preached amen this is where you access the blood of jesus christ because the spirit of god is preaching about access to the blood amen amen but if you leave that away and leaving iniquity iniquity is uh knowing the truth but transgressing it on purpose right then all that remains left is judgment thank god for his mercy that we can have today so true now i want to spend a little time on brother brown now i want to i've got this book for brother shang uh because i think i showed it to you guys a few weeks ago i'm sorry months probably about six months ago by this time so i just want to show it uh the reason brother uh shang and everybody watching too i've got numerous questions online too about brother branham we're not worshiping brother branham all's we're saying is that he was a prophet and he spoke in the name of the lord am i my next coming book i got 30 thus saith the lords 30. now guys like t.d jakes and joe osteen they've never spoken thus saith the lord but who speaks thus saith the lord a prophet speaks not saith the lord all you gotta do is open up jeremiah open up ezekiel i think there's about 200 some thus saith the lord's in ezekiel when you're a prophet of god you speak thus saith the lord okay so the reason i want to we're not worshipping brother brandon but we're looking at his example in his life and how he had to under he had to grow in grace he had to he had to grow an understanding uh and this book shows how uh the whole revival from the 1940s and 50s was all started by brother ramsey's ministry of course it was the holy ghost right in the brother band's ministry you know they have his picture in there with the revivals and everything thousands of thousands of people there's the pillar of fire picture 1950 the pillar of fire took a picture with god's prophet well the pillar of fire was with another prophet named moses the pillar of fire was with another prophet named paul on the road to damascus so the pillar of fire always accompanies a prophet amen amen so i just want to share that and and brother shang when your dad was sick in the hospital your brother vang took that prayer cloth from brother jose and brother branham prayed for that prayer cloth bang laid that cloth on him your dad when he was in a coma two days later he woke up amen oh there you go because there's not power in the cloth but the cloth represents that god sent his servant amen amen right because the bible said god they took they took aprons that they just laid on paul's body and they took those aprons and they give it to somebody else and they get healed because it represents a servant of god was here praise god amen and if you've got faith in god you'll have faith in his servants amen that's why i want to just look i just want to take a few minutes and look at brother graham's confession how he can he confesses making mistakes but god never left him amen so i just want to encourage you moses made awful mistakes right he didn't circumcise his children and the angel was going to kill him but his wife saved him his wife saved him zapporo saved him because the angel was going to kill him but she went and circumcised gershom and threw the foreskin on the ground they said you've been a bloody husband to me and he made mistakes he smote the rock god said speak to the rock moses smote the rock and god said you glorified yourself you're not going the promised land see prophets are not perfect they're only perfect with thus saith the lord everything else they can be human they can make mistakes but when it's a real prophet of god he'll speak the same lord it will come to pass and that's why i'm using brother graham's example here so i've mentioned this the last two sermons so let's go through this here now this is akron right this is akron this is right down there by the hospital shang's probably familiar with that aren't you brother 59 right you take 59 right there you drive right back i did it all the time years ago now brother brahm gives us he gives his teaching in this message as it was with moses motivation to deliver israel but he was given two signs so the people could see oh he had two signs remember his hand and what was the other one the hand and the staff thank you and the staff he had two signs to prove that he was going to take the people to the promised land or he's going to deliver them out of egypt right he was given two signs so the people would believe his commission now in this sermon as i was with moses brother adam said i was given two signs the first poll in the second poll right to get the people to believe the commission was to pray for the sick and he said if you can get them to believe not even cancer will stand before your prayer amen amen praise god so both prophets now that's why he's a brother brother man was a bible prophet so just like moses had two signs brother branham had two signs because he was a bible prophet and the beautiful part is you can we can listen to brother branham's second sign on tape and you can hear him tell people the secrets of the thoughts intents of their heart it's beautiful and it never fails amen hallelujah just like moses's staff never failed amen every time he struck it every time he threw it any time he used that it never failed amen the signs never fail but the signs are only there to raise your faith to possess the commission so you can possess what god has called you to do so i hope this helps by god's grace hope you can see this cause this is the thought now brother graham's his confession is he's gonna say i i labored too much on the signs okay now he's a human right so he got a little imbalance right he was putting too much emphasis on the signs all right but did god ever leave him god never left him amen hallelujah god never left god never said i'm done with you you made a mistake no he just he made a mistake he just overemphasized the gift but then he learns here in 1960 that i can't emphasize the gift i've got to emphasize the commission praise god and i think you'll see what i'm talking about did anybody listen to this message this week as always with moses anybody get a chance lydia did okay praise it amen when did you listen to it okay good good i didn't tell her to do that but good and if you haven't church i would encourage you to listen this message it's only a two hours i think it's two hours and 11 minutes i just i go on youtube and i can play a little faster on there i played at one and a half speed so i can listen to a little bit faster because sometimes there's breaks in the action you know you can still catch it you can still catch a revelation so i want i just want you to see that uh that that there you know god gave them signs that were pointing to the arrival or the possession of the commission and we've gotta we've gotta make sure we don't make we don't put too much emphasis on the signs today right same thing for us okay so that's why i'm using brother bram's example because he was a very biblical prophet his ministry matches that of the bible okay now i got a lot to read here but i charge you before god the elect angels and jesus christ the commission was pray for the sick the qu the question was insufficient to do it brother ram knew he couldn't he couldn't do it he couldn't do what the angel was asking to on his own for this cause you were born this is the means of your peculiar birth and life he said that you are to pray for the sick if you'll get them to believe you and be sincere when you pray nothing shall stand before your prayer not even cancer how many has read that through the years it's all over the world now i said i cannot do it i'm insufficient to do it they won't believe me i'm poor i have no education that was me questioning he said moses was given two signs to vindicate his commission so are you not you will you're given two signs one of them will be your hand so brother shang brother branham would take people's hands i think it was his left hand right he would he would hold someone's hand and there would be dots that would arise on his hands and they would be in different patterns and depending on the pattern he could tell them what the disease was so it was tuberculosis there might be like a certain number of dots it was cancer the dots might be over there he had a gift and people saw it everybody could see it on his hand he had that gift okay the other gift he had you'll know the very secret of their hearts and their minds now that's called discernment and i've met uh i met a woman brother shang where brother branham told her in a prayer line you've got tuberculosis you're dying he said but go weigh yourself next monday you're going to gain one pound and then go your way yourself the next monday you're going to gain another pound and you're going to be healed and she was so she was dying of tuberculosis but brother and brother knew her life and told her secrets and then told her what to do and it came to pass and that's on tape it's on tape and her testimony is on tape too you can watch it on i think it's on youtube and by this they'll believe by these two signs now remember listen don't you fail to get this the sign is not the commission the sign only points to the commission right you get out here on the road and see a sign that says five miles of jeffersonville that isn't jeffersonville that's a sign to show you you're on the right road so see when brother ram would use his gifts that was a sign to show you you're on the right road to believe amen right but just because the gift operates doesn't mean that person is going to believe it in other words just because god shows you something a dream that doesn't mean you're going to believe it you've still got to believe it amen word god's word is laying right here but you've still got to believe it amen you've got to believe it for yourself you've got to take it and possess it and say yes it's mine i'm not going to doubt it i'm going to accept it praise god same thing you gotta believe it yourself and this poor sick crippled world is waiting for deliverance so it's waiting for the commission but they're looking at a signpost have mercy the signpost is nothing but a sign to prove the commission there's a new ministry it's just been revealed to me pray for the sake get the people to believe you god can never leave that but i'm ready to leave this mountain i want to grow across jordan i want to carry the commission what are you saying brother brandon it's 1960 what are you saying you fail with the signpost well just hang on he's going to explain it he puts too much emphasis on the sign itself okay and then and you can listen to this this is nothing new it's been laying there on the tapes all these years i just think it's a good time for us to go over now don't you and another woman said now here's brother i'm giving a woman to discernment she said my back i've got back trouble they they can't find what it done brother branham said you believe me to be his prophet she said i do now he sees a vision what happened back yonder in the early month of june they're trying to work on you trying to operate for a slip vertebra she had a slip vertebra it's not so it's a i'm sorry they thought it was a subvert vertebra it's not it's a pinched nerve you got it by lifting the load when you work for mcspadden's market she said i remember when it was done i remember it now that doesn't heal her now look here's a woman she don't know why she got back trouble brother ram sees a vision and said you got it when you were lifting something but man said that secret doesn't heal her it only points to the fact she needs to believe amen right quit leaning on the signpost let's go on to the city let's get away from this mountain let's get to the city let's cross jordan amen amen praise god there's nothing wrong with the gifts but we can't lean upon the gift more than the promise more than the commission praise god i hope it'll be clear to you i think it'll be clear as we go on brother said i've wrung so now he said i failed now he says i've done wrong that's why i base these sermons the way i have brother branham preached these sermons to show people that he'd made a mistake yet god never left him amen hallelujah praise god amen you can be a true servant of god you can be a true man or woman of god and make a mistake but god's not going to throw you away god wants to teach you god wants you to make he wants to make you more like jesus amen the only way to do that the only way to learn obedience is through what suffering you got to suffer and say oh i failed i'm a i'm a failure i made a mistake and what does that make you do brother amen it makes you lean on the lord more right when you make a mistake and you embarrass jesus or you embarrass the church or you make a disgrace that makes you say next time i'm going to pray more or next time i'm not going to speak that until i know for sure i'm going to make sure it's god's will i'm going to lean on the everlasting arms amen see failures are important for us to learn from our mistakes so we lean on jesus we trust him more we wait on him before we do anything he said because he said as i was with moses so i'll be with you and when that hand come down and pointed that very same scripture remember the holy spirit came down and pointed to joshua one one through nine that was the holy spirit time brother ma'am you've got to cross over in the third pole the first bolt second bowl but you've got to cross over in that third pole speaking the word all right revealing the word amen preaching to the eternal loss amen which might be fulfilled by us for a long time i've wondered because i didn't know what the commission was i've looked for something supernatural beyond that god cannot get away from his commission god give the commission that's what it must remain but all the penalties also people like signs they like to see it the bible said a wicked indulger's generation seeks after signs but the commission was pray for the sick and tens of thousands times thousands that i prayed for or failed to pray for yeah here it is because they all desired the sign they all desire so what did brother brown fail and he didn't pray for enough people because he let each person pull out the gift of his discernment in the prayer line and it sapped his strength so much after five or six or seven or eight of those he couldn't pray for anybody else my brother said that's where i failed now does that help anybody by god's grace he says i'm wrong i've failed i'm a failure i've done all these things yet did god did god discern those people yes did some people get healed yes but not as many people got prayed for as god would have liked and you're going to see in the quote here the angel lord says you've done wrong you should have prayed for more you cause all this carnal impersonation and yet was it still was he still a holy ghost-filled saint yes yes right confessing his sin filled with the holy spirit of god no condemnation right in heaven none in heaven but he had to learn on the earth how to operate his gifts the right way see not everybody got prayed for that should have got prayed for now you know church we love brother branham here we're not making any him look we're just we just we're just being honest we're just showing him as an example that he failed god at times but god was with him never forsook him and so this is to encourage us that if we make a mistake and it might be for a long time you're going to see the quotes here 12 or 14 years he said but i'm ready to leave this mountain i'm ready to praise god people can make mistakes 10 15 we'll say like this 20 years and they might even they might even be genuine holy ghost-filled saints but god is allowing them here to work out their own salvation with fear and trembling so that they'll learn to be a better servant of god the other day i was trying to work the ministry got into the room a man coming to the plot platform said now brother brandon wait a minute my case is different i just got to know something now here's an example was what brother branham would say a man will come up and say pray for me and he said i'm not leaving until you give me a discernment a vision well what's he going to do brother ram said he would cater them he would say okay i'll wait here until god sends me a vision but he should not have done that he was what he says later i said well doctor the doctor can examine you oh no i don't want that i want to know right now my case is so different look at that look how can i say like this look how carnal spiritual people can be are you with me they're they're so carnal they think uh they they think they've got to have a sign i've got to see a sign poster i got to have a signpost now to make sure i'm going to arrive at akron we shouldn't have to say that right we should know we know the way to akron we're going to arrive there we don't have to have a signpost because he already promised me to make it amen i've already had promises right i've already seen the other signposts but see people get so carnal i've got to have a sign i've got to feel something oh my help us lord i've got to see something i've got to feel something i've got to somebody's got to do something now there's nothing wrong if you're if we're all gideons not your i'm a gideon we're all gideons there's all times we need a sign but we've got to learn by the holy spirit at times just to accept the word and go forth and believe it amen but this man says no i've got you've you've got to give me a vision he says well i don't want he said uh he said well praise the lord that's right he said the rest of you come on and let me pray for you when i did that you know what the next one said then the next person just didn't want brother man to pray for him the next person wanted another vision he said because my case is just as important as his well if he got a vision i want a vision too he said and then when i got to about six or eight of these the meeting it like to killed me now brother brahm admits in this sermon that wasn't god's will god doesn't want his servants to be almost dying at the paul at the platform in other words brother should not have set them all up in order brother branham should have preached the word and then just pray for them quickly and he says it later just pray for them quickly let them pass through and then when god would send a vision then he should have told the vision of that person but he just should have made sure he prayed for all the people if you listen to perfect faith 1963 you'll see him doing this he said it don't have to be a a vision every time you just have to believe god's word every time amen he says just let him pass through the prayer line just pray for the sick that's the commission pray for the sick get them to believe and they'll receive the healing if they've got genuine faith but every person's got to have a sign every person's got to have a feeling every person's got to have something they can touch or feel or something supernatural rather than just faith he said i've always wondered why that would do that to me is because i was doing it wrong let me say like this when preachers wear themselves out and they almost go crazy or they get a mental problem it's their fault right brother man made that statement he said i'd rather wear out than rust out but he said the holy spirit told him later that's he can't do that because he is going to wear himself out right so you get like remember that quote we showed a few months ago you got to take care of god's man amen give the man some rest praise god give the man a little bit of time to sleep right let him sleep in let him get some rest let this let the daughter of god get some rest amen so brother man was he's basically hurting himself by letting each person pull a vision out of him through his gift he said that's just the signpost post pointing the commission it's not the commission hundreds have passed over the platform without receiving anything i just prayed for them it's right back on the people if you will believe see the commission was given that's the original the signposts had been produced now if you can believe that if you will believe that god sent me into the world to pray for the sick people i'll be able to pray the prayer faith for you that's the only way it can be done god can never get away from his commission i failed him i've here about 14 years with nothing but straight discernment i failed him because i haven't prayed for more people i was using the gift in a way that i thought was the right way but it wasn't the right way around and around the world till tens of thousands a million cases i guess i asked you one thing did never fail no sir if the signpost won't fail how much more will the commission never fail if the sign that's the minor part if the sign point of the city if it doesn't fail to tell you the city's there how much more will the city be there when you come there's the commission amen now my ministry is changing it's already changed there will still be discernment they'll still carry on just as i feel that god wants me to say but until then i'll pray and lay hands on the sick as he told me to do and carry out my commission i waited a long time for this but i believe now that we're ready to take the promised land he's already born again right but this is the application of his ministry his ministry's got the crossover amen his ministry's calling to the first bowl the second full but he's got to get into the next phase the last phase of his ministry praise god and just as sure as there will be there'll be some rahab waiting there'll be someone waiting that'll believe it with all their heart maybe we looked at that on a few wednesday nights ago what's the beauty of rahab the beauty of rahab is she never saw moses do one miracle amen hallelujah she never uh she never saw the staff turn the surface said oh i believe all she did was here all she did was hear about there's a mighty god there's an army rising up there's an army coming over here and i believe there's a living god and she believed all she did was believe and the bible said faith comes by hearing amen that's what god wants us today he just wants us to hear the word and accept the revelation that god will keep his promise amen that's why that's what brother i'm saying i need some rahabs in my ministry not that they got us not somebody i just i got to see a vision i got to feel something i got to hear something just somebody that believes god and loves god and knows god cannot fail amen amen hallelujah now now look here again i've leaned heavy on the signpost myself lord you show me about this before i pray for them here he is here he is confessing his wrongs i'm not going to pray for somebody until i know more secrets about them that was wrong brother graham says that was wrong now look what he says now look at this church i told you these words right because i don't know what i might do how cruel that was i asked the congregation to forgive me how cruel a man of god how cruel that's what brother branham says because he would focus too much attention on this one person when he's going to say it out there there was hundreds of sick people that needed his prayers but because he was misusing his gift and trying to make sure before i pray i don't know if god's gonna hear my prayer the angel told him god would hear his prayer right the angel had already told him and commissioned him if you can get them to believe nothing will stand before your prayer but it's like every service he was just trying to trying to get everybody to believe instead of focusing on the commission that if you preach the word and if they've heard the word then faith will come by hearing the word of god amen i hope this isn't shocking anybody too bad does anybody feel like they've been shocked this morning hope evan hope i haven't shocked anybody too bad how cruel was brother branham now according to his words from 1948 to 1960 he says how cruel i was praying for a few people rather than for praying for hundreds if not thousands more now is he forgiven absolutely but he made a mistake did god ever leave him no absolutely not how do you know because all the way down to 1965 before he passed away god was still giving him thus saith the lord about marriage and divorce amen let's say the lord about who's this melchizedek all these thus ate the lord and then the monk before he died for the amen god healed him of that stomach condition every seven years it would come back every seven years and then finally right there in november of 1965 he said i've seen it god delivered me that that raccoon ran out of me or whatever it was that squirrel whatever it was it ran out of me i'm free and god's healing came on the wings of a snow white dove the holy spirit kept his promise healed him never left him our god is faithful amen amen god never left him amen god god he can imagine god healed him a month before he died he only got to enjoy that healing for a month hey amen but it wasn't showing it's showing god's gonna finish what he started praise god i said i'll say like this when he passed over he got the rehealing anyway he got the real healing he got a new theophany hey hallelujah a new body amen a glorifies a theophany body a word body praise god no more pain no more suffering that was the real healing praise god how cruel i was i asked the congregation to forgive me the congregations of this world that's listening on the tape forgive me i was wrong i should have never carried out like that that was his commission that wasn't his commission in the first place that was a sign pointing the commission i should have prayed for the sick everywhere instead of just these five six or seven or eight on the platform now see it's right back to the laps of the people see brother he says it see god wanted everybody just to believe not just eight people to believe all right does everybody understand that by god's grace if he would discern their hearts then they would believe well well that's good but that's only eight people instead of hundreds or thousands of people god wanted thousands to believe not just eight see it's right back in the laps of the people if you will believe that god commission is to be done here it is in the word it's exactly what the word the commission that i say now here's an example that he gives in the sermon he gives this sermon a crippled girl can you imagine this this is what this is why brother graham said it was so cruel a crippled girl is trying to crawl up to the prayer line but the ushers keep pushing her back and she doesn't get prayed for because brother brahm prayed for the four or five people or six whatever and then he couldn't pray for any more this is what this is the example so the example of him being cruel is he didn't get to pray for other sick people he said uh he said surely there's some other way besides this and brother moore brother moore was a preacher there was a poor little girl crawling up to the building crippled poor little thing trying to get up to where i was i looked down at the child and stared started crying well they couldn't bring her in the line she didn't have a prayer card not knowing that was the child's last night it was her last night at the meeting to try to get up and get healed and brother moore and them helped her out to get out of the line she was trying to can you imagine a little girl trying to get through to the line and the ushers take her back because you don't have a prayer card the next day we sat and talked over he said brother graham that hurt me i said hurt you what do you think it had done to me so brother moore was sad this little crippled girl crawled up here didn't get prayed for he said brother that hurt me he said it hurt me more see a crippled little girl that stuck with me that's been about 10 years ago a little crippled girl over there in illinois late little blackhead brown eyes crawling a little polio girl trying to get up to where i was at and the ushers down there had to help her and set her back in the seat crawled out of her seat to help her get up there why you can only take so many and if i'd cut some of them out put her in there without a prayer card others would have hurt their feelings or have their feelings hurt see that's right couldn't do it i said surely there's some other way wish i'd have known then what i know now things would be different it sure would have been different now let's not don't let the brother brand because how many people have you neglected to pray for how many times have you said yeah i'll pray for you sure i'll keep that in prayer but you don't keep it in prayer are you with me church that's not i'm not sharing with this with you to get upset with brother abraham i'm showing you he was a man right he was trying he was trying to understand the signpost and the commission and he made mistakes but god never left him god still loved him god so forgive him he was still god's eliezer amen to get abroad ready for isaac amen and though the thing is that people today can we say like this haters today you've ever people call them haters the crit the criticizers today of brother branham have no idea what it's like to have thousands and hundreds of thousands of people come into a meeting and have faith in your prayers they've never even gone to meetings like that they have no idea the pressure that's on them right the pressure that was on brother abraham they have no idea so they they they criticize and judge brother branham when they have no right to do that because they've never walked in issues they've never sacrificed like him amen they've never prayed like him they've never labored like him well see we understand that we can give him grace because god was with him god forgave him god helped him god answered his prayer god was with him god was in praise god see he said things would have been different if i'd only known then what i know now i would have not handed out prayer cards he just would have prayed and let the people just receive it right there ah hallelujah now let's get back to here now i'm ready to go to jordan this morning i'm ready to stand my commission i've loved people i've catered them so look at this brother ram was he was catering to the people rather than another than the commission see he felt bad well this brother wants a vision and okay i'll let you pull a vision out of me but he's going to get tired he's going to get weak he was catering to the people just like church you remember he catered to his mother-in-law you remember that his mother-in-law said don't you take my daughter out there with all that trash that pentecostal trash and he catered to her for a little while i don't remember that remember in south africa he catered to the ministers he said because i love people so he let his human love get in the way of the love of god and the church said we do the same thing i'm going to get to something just a little bit just something small i'm going to get something in a little bit here brother man was trying to do he was trying to for trying to like force them to believe that's kind of it's kind of like what he was doing just like you and i will try to force people to get saved right we're trying to force them like with my mom when we first got saved i tried to like force her to believe we were yelling out to go back later and apologize i was just like mom gave me the message i was really immature back boy if i'm immature now how much more mature was i back then i believe i'm more mature than i was but you know you you want you want to see people believe it so bad right you just want to like force them that's kind of what brother was doing he was just he just wanted everybody just to believe so much that he would give himself of his limited energy give himself there but other people lacked instead of letting god just send the vision right that god's in the vision he said i love people i've catered them he's he's met me vision after vision which i don't have time to tell you know it's wrote these books he's and the angel said you're catering too much to the people to walk with me you'll walk alone you're putting too much emphasis on those signs praise god i didn't know what the rest of it was but the hour didn't come i'm sorry the hours come the hours come when i seen the hand come down to joshua as i was with moses i'll be with you i believe it this morning from henceforth i serve god in my commission he wants he can show them to me if he does not never will i stand before the people trying to let their faith pull something out of me anymore see he was just standing there just pull something out of me pull something out of me just use me just use me instead of saying god you use me i hope you understand by god's grace i'll pray for the sick i'll commit them to god let them go if they believe the commission ah god is just as true he's brought me this far just as he did to moses to joshua so he hasn't did it the same praise god see if they believe the bible says lay hands on the sick and they shall recover if they just believe that they'll get amen right because god heals about 99 of the time doesn't he every time you get sick did god heal you brother shang yeah me too 99 of time every time i get sick he heals me every time and god promised to do that so why do we need sometimes another sign what we shouldn't have to have it right well that's what that's what brother brown was doing he was giving them extra signs leaning on the signpost rather than just saying keep going you're on the road to akron praise god you're on the road to your destination you will be healed just keep going keep marching towards zion amen my humble prayers god forgive me let me rise and try again help me lord let me lead this people and stand the word so we can go up to jordan go in the promised land where the great ransom church of god will be saved and sin no more that's my desire this morning believe it and live believe it healed believe it and be healed i speak to you in the name of the lord let us pray believe it live like this is after the prayer now look believe and get well i can't make no one believe it you have to believe it yourself so see when brother and was standing there he was just like trying to get them to believe just believe just so he's letting himself be the gift be used on one person rather than on hundreds if not thousands see that's what i was saying earlier he was just like trying to just force them to believe just give them every single every single uh clue and proof that they're gonna be healed rather than just letting them believe the promise that god had given them now i hope you're feeling pretty good about your next healing everybody feeling pretty good about your next healing next time you get sick god promised he said by the stripes of jesus i'm healed praise god and if our faith is strong enough in the word we won't need anything else we'll just need the promise amen although it'd be nice to have a dream it'd be nice to have somebody call you up and say are you are you sick the lord just told me you're sick well thus saith the lord you're going to be healed that would be nice to get that but you really don't have to have that you've got to have faith in the blood amen that's all we really need right he said i'm tired of staying on this mountain of the signpost i want to go up to jordan i want to enter the full promises you've got to be kidding me i want to get faith within myself not looking at a sign not looking to something god has revealed or some kind of a signpost i would look towards cover and say by faith i come lord god i'm coming in the name of the lord jesus there's times you might need a sign but brother man is trying to show us real faith in god's word will just take the word of god at its face value and say that's enough evidence for me praise god amen god said repent and be baptized in the name of jesus christ and you shall be filled with the holy ghost that's enough evidence for me praise god amen people say god show me a sign i'm going to get the holy ghost he already did it's action 38 praise god amen sign right with his unfailing word amen what's he trying to do church he's trying to increase our faith how many feel that say lord increase my faith he's trying problem was trying to get the people's faith to be increased in christ there's the signposts were there for a purpose but they're just there for a short time right because you got to keep moving on to your destination your healing your salvation whatever promise of god you're approaching how many believes this is the will of god oh something just makes me feel i done right it's off my chest i've been on there for 12 years knowing there's been something wrong brother lee brother jose 12 years he knew he was doing it wrong he said i've got it off my chest this morning i know it's off there i've said it's taped it's off my chest now you know what that brother from canada he called me up to confess his addiction to poor i said hey this is the first time we've ever talked first time i said well god bless you sir he said i need to confess my pornography addiction to you i said okay yeah i was totally shocked i didn't know that was gonna be the call he said i said oh okay sir well yes if you confess it god will forgive god will forgive you and he says is that what the bible says confess your faults one to another i said yes sir i said now you've got to get a home church and serve everybody get so focused on your home church family that all this pornography all this lust it'll just all flow it'll all blow away praise god amen if you go to the house of god and start loving god's people and serving them and having bible studies and more church all the time all these things are going to fly they're going to blow it will drive that chaff away and all that will be left is the seed of god's word amen now it's up to him now if he'll do it i gave him a minister's number up there in canada i said bleed in all caps i said please please call that brother and get a home church you're never going to defeat satan without the body of christ never you won't do it remember you can only be saved so he's getting into your personal faith you can only be healed by your personal faith see the signpost the fact that there's a sign doesn't make you healed you've got to have personal faith that jesus is your healer right right you have faith well i have faith god did a miracle that's or god discerned that's good but you've got to have also faith in god's promise that you're seeking look at this i preached the word for 12 years you've confirmed that around the world i've had forgiveness and i know that i did not do it willfully it's because i thought i was doing right 12 years brother johnny 12 14 years he was doing it the wrong way and yet god still healed people god still saved people god still strengthened brother branham but god eventually corrected his servant because every child of god must be corrected and then george did you know this the angel said because you've done this he tried to explain he tried to show everybody and explain the two signs he tried to explain dots he tried to explain the discernment and because of that people started making up their own and we got it today we got prophets of their imaginations the bible says they just make up stories or like one story was this guy today or on the video said i went into jesus's eye and i saw the future and all kinds of i can smell demons and this one lady's got pink hair on the internet she says jesus takes her to heaven every day for a daily vision oh it's a bunch of nonsense and she cuts her hair like a man all kinds of stuff that's nonsense but what are they they're prophets of their own imagination see every action we do has a reaction and so the prophet made this mistake and the angel said you've caused many impersonations just then the one who'd been talking with me stepped around in front of me it was him the angel lord he had his hands folded he looked at me and said just what i told you not to do i said yes that's right he said you see the first poll was when you just used to put your hands out to the people tell them what was their trouble the second poll was when you know the secrets of their heart and instead of you keeping that to yourself you tried to explain all about it and tell people what you did and said you didn't know anything about it yourself how could you explain it now look at that isn't that something the angel said you you can't explain supernatural things and yet you're trying to explain supernatural things right it's just like you and i are trying to explain well how did jesus raise from the dead well here let me try to explain it well the spirit went out of his body and then uh you know two days later you know it kind of came back in through his feet and then well no maybe it went right into his we don't we we weren't there we're not the author of life jesus is the author of life amen god's the one we shouldn't try to explain things we don't understand but what do you say he said i cater to the people so much oh talk about amazing grace he and he caused a big bunch of carnal impersonations to rise up and you see what you've done i said lord i'm sorry oh i'm sorry i don't know what to do and just then this little confused the church everybody had a sensation everybody had this right down in my heart god knows the truth i know it wasn't right because he told me so see it's a false impersonation it's only throw the people off so brother madam even says he knows what he did he tried to explain all the supernatural things he said that caused a bunch of people with pretend sensation have real sensations yes but and they weren't right with god and they took that and brother ham should not have explained it they took that and tried to create some other sensation themselves now i'm getting back here now i'm going to get back to this and i'm going to kind of bring it up to a new thought so i'm leaving this thought now he said what a consolation that must have been to joshua when he heard god say as i was with moses so will i be with you although if i'm trying and i fail god won't leave me he's going to make mistakes if he's really divinely called and god's in his heart he'll rise again amen praise god now let's look at your thought your your position we're here let me just see for a moment i've already been an hour so let me uh i might save that for next sunday here yeah i think i'm gonna say that for next sunday let's let's close with this so yesterday i just called this this brother not in our church i just called this brother i felt led to call him and we talked and as we were talking about we talked for an hour and a half now usually i don't talk to brothers on the phone for an hour and a half i'm not really a phone talking kind of guy i just felt led of the holy spirit and as i'm talking the discernment started working in my life and i started saying how coronavirus has exposed the spirit of fear on people because now they're so scared they won't even go to church and god knows i wasn't i wasn't trying i knew nothing about this and the brother said that's exactly what i'm battling i haven't gone to church for x and x and x number of months and so right there i said oh i knew that was the holy spirit because it discerned his life and i didn't i didn't know and if he told me before i didn't remember because i was just and the scripture came to my mind in revelation 21 the fearful the abominable will not inherit the kingdom of god so the discernment started operating in my land and did another one but i can't remember right now another one hmm maybe the holy spirit will bring it back to me so i told that brother i said now unless you've got fear i said the only thing you got to do you've got to be strong and courageous that's all you've got to do right god all god told joshua was you be strong and courageous praise god amen amen you can either fear back and be a afraid and shy and nervous about something you can either choose to be shy and afraid or you can stand up there and walk and face it face to face and deal with it and not be afraid i say let's be strong in the lord amen let's be strong in the lord no matter the situations that arise in our lives we have the promise that god is never going to forsake us amen god's never going to leave me brother amen praise god as long as i confess my sin i might make a mistake here there i might fall short of the glory but god's never going to leave me because he commissioned me to do my commission amen amen same thing for you god gave you a divine commission so you've got to fulfill it praise god and he'll never leave you or forsake you now look at this the lord is talking he said moses is dead he said be strong and of a good courage for unto this people you'll divide for inheritance the land which i swear to their fathers only be strong and very courageous that you observe to do according to all the law which moses my servant commanded thee don't turn to the right or the left that you may be prosper wherever thou goes amen now look the law will not depart out of your mouth in other words always talk about god right meditate there in day out i'm sorry day in and night that thou mayest observe to do all that's written therein for them thou shalt make thy way prosperous and thou shalt have good success the only time the word success is used in the entire bible they got a big magazine called success you ever seen that and they put all the millionaires all the billionaires on there all the prostitute models all the prostitute men that are role models the actors that's not success that's a lie from hell that's that's destruction praise god that's failure but real success is speaking the word talking the word thinking about the word all the time if you do that you'll possess the promise of god hey man they gotta put us on the front of that success magazine one of these days put the little church in akron that little bride yes because she's speaking the word she's being strong she's meditating in the word she's loving the word she's a real success amen no man or woman no demon can stand before that woman all the days of her life amen because she's in the word all the way all she does is think about the word amen no look he asked him a question haven't i commanded you in other words are you listening didn't you hear the command i gave you be strong he says it again be strong enough to imagine why would god do that joshua must have been discouraged he hears be strong god says haven't i commanded you yes yeah be strong and courageous that's what we are that's why sometimes church you got to hear a sermon time after time after time listen to it be strong be courageous take god's word speak god's word be strong don't be afraid thank god that he gives us reminders because we need him praise god we need him joshua needed him and if he needs them we'll need them too praise god don't be dismayed don't be depressed don't be discouraged be strong instead amen god is with you wherever you go like at the doctor out you know i i confessed last week i felt like a failure i walked in there i started right away i said praise the lord sir god bless you sir and we got to talking and everything like that the dentist and he said you know what you're a pastor right i said yes sir i'm a pastor he said i've talked to many pastors no one's been able to answer this question i was just you know i was before you came in i was i was singing uh i was singing this song i was looking out the window i was singing he careth for you cause that the the doctor told me that god didn't care for me but i want to tell the devil no god does care for me i was singing he careth for you through sunshine or shadows he careth for you you know he's grinding on my tube for like 15 minutes brother shutting you know give me like five shots and i can't feel nothing he's like ah he's got me in a headlock and then he stops he says no no one's ever been able to answer this before he said what was jesus doing between the time he was 12 and 30. was he out in the desert and hiding out and doing all kinds of things i looked at him i said no the bible said he was a carpenter and he was learning to submit to his mother and father and growing in favor with god and with man he said oh that's what the bible said didn't go out the wilderness i said after he got the power of the holy ghost and he almost cut me off because he stuck that thing back in my mouth i was just talking about the power of the holy ghost and he said oh oh then he moved on to something else amen see we've got the answer to the devil's questions praise god we got it i like that because god gave me just a few opportunities the same words there and i got to tell him something that no one would have been able to tell him ever before see because the bible says no man will be able to stand before you all the days of your life that's just just a small testimony it made me feel good because it when uh they brought the question all the other preachers didn't have the answer because all the other preachers didn't know the message but we know the message now joshua he takes this message with amen and he goes talks to his generals he says now he says you this is all that god's command us we're going to do that and then and then the the the officers answer back to joshua and they say whosoever he that rebel against the commandment will not hearken unto the words and all thou commands him and he shall be put to death only be strong and of a good courage now if you go reading the bible moses told joshua the same thing moses before he died he said joshua be strong and courageous so now let's let's look at the order before moses died joshua was watching him he served him and moses looks at him says joshua you only be strong and courageous just be strong a few weeks later moses dies a few months later he dies and then god comes himself into vision says joshua be strong and courageous haven't i commanded you be strong and courageous and then he he takes that and he shares it with the people and the people say joshua we've only got to be strong and courageous amen in other words everybody is giving him the same message all around and brother shang you heard it so many times he started believing that praise god amen that's how we are we hear the word preach sunday after sunday after wednesday and pretty soon we start believing it amen amen so much so saints that uh he said it again in joshua 10 he's got he's got those five kings on the run they lock him in a cave he brings them out and he stands he puts these these kings on their on their faces and he puts his feet on their necks and he says listen all you army of israel listen he says he said come on here listen to me he put and he said put your necks on put your feet on there next and he said don't be afraid nor be dismayed be strong and of good courage for thus shall the lord god do to all your enemies whom ye fight praise god he got so filled with the power of god he started speaking the power of god amen and then he experienced it himself he was strong and courageous and now you guys watch this this is how you do it you've got to put the devil under your foot praise god don't let the devil put you under his foot you got to put the devil under your foot praise god you've got to conquer the devil you got to be strong you've got to be courageous you're more than a conqueror in christ jesus amen so what's the order how do you get strong brother jess well i got a few things for you this is what i'm closing with i know i'm about an hour hour 15 minutes that's not too bad the steps in joshua are this first remember that god is faithful amen if you want to be strong remember first god will not fail you amen hallelujah he won't fail you he promised i'll never leave you nor forsake you the second step is keep all of god's commands i like when naomi said that a few seven days ago how do you know you got the holy ghost i keep all god's commands that's exactly right that's what the holy spirit told joshua amen you keep all the commands i'll be with you no one will ever stand before you all the days of your life and then third thing after you keep them just talk about it all the time share testimonies texts about how's your week been in the lord got any good victories in the lord what you've been reading this week what you've been praying about this week stay confessing the word of god stay meditating upon the word of god and you'll be a success oh my one more scripture get your bibles to go to second corinthians 12 the last one you have my word last one second corinthians 12. now behind all of this i hate to you know i gave you an order there but behind all this let me show you what comes first behind all this second corinthians 12. paul had a met a buffeting devil sent to him allowed by god god allowed this to keep him humble and he asked three times lord can you take this devil away so i can see better and the lord said no my grace is sufficient in your weakness well how did paul become strong verse 9 he said to me my grace is sufficient for thee for my strength is made perfect in weakness most gladly therefore will i rather glory in my infirmities that the power of christ may rest upon me therefore i take pleasure and infirmities and reproaches and necessities and persecutions in distresses for christ's sake for when i am weak then i am strong so what's the what's really the first thing that has to happen the first thing is you got to be humble and the church said amen oh i want to be strong brother jesse i want to be courageous so do i but the first thing to do is be humble realize i'm in a battle i can't i can't i can't win this battle myself i have no ability i defeat the enemy so lord you are my you are gonna give me grace to make make it through this battle praise god and i'm resting the bible said he's resting on the power of god that's when you're strong praise god when we realize we have no ability of ourselves so we're just resting on the word of god god give me the word to say give me the give me the prayer to pray i'm resting on your power and then you remember god's faithfulness then you remember his promise then you keep all the commands and then you speak the word of god upon it let's stand our feet musicians you can come almost hour and a half so pardon me i just i knew this was going to be a longer one i should have told you at the beginning may the lord bless you richly you love the lord today that to me that place is it just gives me so much understanding with brother brahms some of these quotes i've never understood for years and finally this year i feel like oh now i can see why he failed he was leaning on he was letting just somebody pull something out of him rather than the commission pray for as many people as you can pray for as many as you can let's be strong today church how do you want to be strong you know that person i talked to yesterday i got done i said thank you for sending me a little text i said thanks for talking with me brother he said the spirit of fear has left me i cast out a demon just by quoting the word of god amen amen see the power of that all you gotta do is speak god's word brother shane and if that person believes it the devil's got to go amen praise god he said all the fear i can show you the text all the fear and depression has left me i said praise the lord that's what we're to do them that believe in my name shall they cast out devils amen hallelujah he said all the weight and the burden of all these financial things and all oh it's all left me yay man just like when you guys play cast off demons my thank god for his mercy how many grateful for the holy spirit today just play something here something sweet here nobody should leave here except they're strong in the lord let's not leave here weak in the name of the lord let's leave her strong in the power of his might he said that he said i love that word only only be strong that's all you got to do just remember be strong don't let the devil push you over don't let the devil discourage you don't let the devil tell you you're nothing he's nothing to jesus he's more to conquer he's in more than a a battle for you and i he can overcome us like nothing but we're talking about jesus we're talking about greater is he that's in me than he that's in the world amen that's what i'm talking about i'm no match for satan oh but the one inside of me the power inside of me he's the one that will conquer satan at every to every champion amen he's never lost the battle even when he died it looked like he lost but he didn't lose he only conquered amen he destroyed death through death amen hallelujah and he's here today to help us out as well by god's grace amen only be thou strong and courageous heavenly father i come in the authority of jesus christ you commissioned me like you commissioned all preachers be instant in season out of season preach the word hallelujah thank you lord we feel your presence here

leader amen god help us lord to be strong you've told us before and time and time again help us to speak your word today dear god and put that devil under our feet hallelujah the neck of that devil under our feet that we can be conquerors amen that we can testify to others like i testified to that brother yesterday the lord it's only by your grace i'm nothing i know i'm nothing i'm a failure
