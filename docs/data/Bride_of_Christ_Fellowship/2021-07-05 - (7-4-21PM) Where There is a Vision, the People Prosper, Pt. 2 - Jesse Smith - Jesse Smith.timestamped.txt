[1:00] about vision i just kind of want to
[1:01] rehearse uh what our vision
[1:03] should be as we grow individually uh we
[1:06] should grow
[1:07] together right and then we should uh
[1:10] grow around the world
[1:12] we should grow believers around the
[1:15] world
[1:15] it'll be a small number right but we
[1:17] still have to go to every nation and
[1:18] make disciples of every nation so
[1:20] um lord willing as this coveted thing
[1:22] blows over hopefully there won't be any
[1:25] uh massive variants right brothers

[1:29] my goodness
[1:30] we got the blood of jesus thank god we
[1:31] have the blood of jesus i don't fear
[1:33] these things anymore you know we didn't
[1:34] know at the beginning and
[1:35] the devil kind of uh put some fear maybe
[1:38] into me and maybe others i don't know
[1:40] i know i was scared at first but um by
[1:42] god's grace
[1:43] now we know there's no weapon that's
[1:46] formed against us that shall prosper
[1:47] amen praise god and if i die from the
[1:50] variant i'm in the presence of jesus
[1:52] right don't feel bad for me

[4:43] just one again say we thank the lord for
[4:45] everybody being here and appreciate you
[4:46] pressing out your way to the house of
[4:48] god tonight
[4:49] and i just kind of want to rehearse a
[4:51] little bit about you can pull up the
[4:52] slides here uh
[4:54] just a little bit about our vision um i
[4:57] know i've said it over the years and at
[4:58] some point i want to do that i want to
[4:59] put joel 2 23 through 26 up here some
[5:02] someday
[5:03] and put our vision uh but i'll work on
[5:06] that at some point you know i still want
[5:07] to work on some other things first
[5:09] uh but that's our desire our desire is
[5:12] to see
[5:13] uh the prophecy god has spoken about has
[5:16] come to pass
[5:18] okay that's what we desire because
[5:19] nothing's gonna happen except what's
[5:21] already been said in the word that's
[5:22] that's why i love it peter peter
[5:24] didn't have to guess on the day of
[5:25] pentecost he said this is that which
[5:27] joel spoke of and i imagine we'll say
[5:29] the same thing right before the rapture
[5:31] right because it's in joel right it's in
[5:33] the same chapter joel 2
[5:34] the beginning of the bride and the
[5:36] ending of the bride is in joel chapter
[5:37] two
[5:38] it's amazing it's just an amazing uh
[5:41] prophecy from the prophet joel so
[5:43] uh you know that's what we're moving
[5:45] towards uh this time of restoration
[5:48] right this time of uh restoration of the
[5:51] word
[5:52] of the anointing of all god's promises
[5:55] you know
[5:56] and we're just we're we're growing into
[5:58] that you know i
[5:59] i'm very thankful you know you know uh
[6:01] we every church goes through seasons
[6:03] right but we're in a real season of
[6:04] victory right now i mean look god just
[6:06] healed johnny you know god just
[6:08] blessed your family your family now
[6:11] i mean look you know god just provided
[6:13] everything you know
[6:14] we're in a real season of victory god
[6:16] has given us rest from our enemies
[6:17] praise god
[6:18] as far as like major battles right we've
[6:20] had some major battles over the years
[6:21] with individuals that come against us
[6:23] but
[6:23] god has given us major victories so uh
[6:26] we're we're very thankful to be in the
[6:27] season here
[6:28] and i just want to look again you know
[6:30] last time we looked last week we looked
[6:31] at the vision prophetically where we are
[6:33] uh and i'll just rehearse that i'll just
[6:35] go quickly over that real quick so i can
[6:37] see it again uh we're at the uh
[6:39] end of daniel's image there the feet of
[6:41] daniel where iron and clay are
[6:44] together but not totally mixed together
[6:45] protestant catholic uh right at the feet
[6:48] of that image we're also
[6:50] the prophetic feast of weeks uh right
[6:52] we're at the lat which is the final
[6:54] wheat harvest right before
[6:56] they go into the seventh month or the
[6:57] feast of trumpets
[6:59] where the two prophets come and call
[7:00] israel together we're right there at the
[7:02] end of the harvest
[7:04] and we're also at the end of the seven
[7:05] church ages
[7:07] right we're at 115 years in this church
[7:09] age right and some people think it'll be
[7:10] the shortest it could be
[7:12] if it is we don't have long to the
[7:13] rapture i'll tell you that
[7:15] which that would be that'd be a blessing
[7:17] but if it tarries let's be thankful
[7:19] anyway praise god let's have enough
[7:20] endurance where we can last
[7:22] even if it uh tarries longer we will by
[7:24] the grace of the lord
[7:26] uh so then we ended we ended by looking
[7:29] at the dynamics so
[7:31] the latter rain will be just a refilling
[7:33] of the holy ghost it'll be a time of
[7:34] complete consecration brother ramsey
[7:36] will be an easy thing
[7:38] so just like it was easy when you first
[7:40] got filled with the holy ghost i
[7:41] remember when you two got the holy ghost
[7:44] we i mean my wife and i just talked
[7:45] about it for weeks like wow they're such
[7:47] different people you know they're
[7:48] they're really on fire really dedicated
[7:51] really you know so that was a
[7:52] so that as easy as that was for you guys
[7:55] as we saw in their lives in each one of
[7:56] our lives when we when we
[7:58] believe we got the holy ghost that's
[7:59] what the rapture will be like
[8:01] that same joy that same stimulation that
[8:03] same excitement
[8:05] that same reverence right that same
[8:06] hunger and thirst for god
[8:08] that's what it'll be like praise god for
[8:10] all the bride it'll be a refilling of
[8:12] the holy ghost
[8:14] uh and he said uh that we've worked in a
[8:17] small measure and that interesting we've
[8:18] just worked in the small measure
[8:20] uh but the the full measure will come
[8:23] down as the headstone comes down
[8:25] christ jesus now here's the scripture if
[8:28] you've got your bibles like i said i got
[8:29] now i got thir or 41 minutes left so
[8:32] i'll try to
[8:33] just try to stay with this here i can as
[8:36] much as i can
[8:37] so i want to just bring out just a few
[8:38] simple thoughts here and i think they'll
[8:40] be a blessing to you now the first one
[8:42] you don't you don't have any for that
[8:43] one but uh go to that one go to acts 2
[8:45] 42
[8:46] and then while you're going there i'll
[8:47] read this
[8:49] so in the upcoming book i just have a
[8:51] section on in chapter 6 about the the
[8:53] mystery
[8:54] of christ in you the hope of glory i
[8:56] show how tongues are not the evidence of
[8:57] the holy ghost
[8:59] right thank god there were tongues we
[9:00] thank god there still are
[9:03] but we show how not all speak with
[9:05] tongues now
[9:06] right right after that section i show
[9:08] how there's other evidences jesus said
[9:10] the holy ghost would do in your life
[9:12] right so we know there's there's one
[9:14] experience of being born again but it
[9:15] produces all these fruits of the holy
[9:17] spirit right
[9:18] all these uh characteristics we have as
[9:20] born again believers okay
[9:22] so for the first one i have let's see
[9:24] i'm three four five six
[9:26] i have seven other characteristics uh
[9:29] so you have to have an emotional
[9:30] experience like the day of pentecost
[9:32] right
[9:32] a seeing hear experience then you have
[9:34] to have love for other christians
[9:36] because john 13 35 says by this shall
[9:39] all men know that you're my
[9:40] disciples if you have loved one to
[9:42] another amen
[9:44] now we just had mj tell amen and i out
[9:46] in the hallway
[9:48] he just said out there before he left he
[9:49] said i wouldn't be where i am without
[9:51] your love for the amen and my love
[9:54] and i thought wow look i mean he's only
[9:55] been here what three weeks
[9:58] and he's already felt so much love he
[9:59] knows he wouldn't be where he was
[10:01] now if it wasn't for just our love just
[10:03] our stopping to talk to him right
[10:05] you know because we've had that
[10:06] opportunity not everybody's had that
[10:07] opportunity but we've had that
[10:08] opportunity
[10:09] and he can feel our love right he can
[10:11] feel the love that we all have as for
[10:13] him as a christian
[10:14] i thought that's a great testimony
[10:16] because that's what real christians are
[10:17] that's our vision
[10:18] to love people right to show everybody
[10:21] that we're jesus's disciples
[10:22] because we love everybody praise god
[10:25] also supernatural signs and wonders mark
[10:27] 16 verse 17 and 18
[10:29] these signs shall follow them that
[10:30] believe in my name shall they cast
[10:32] out devils they'll speak with new
[10:34] tongues they'll lay hands on the sick
[10:36] and they shall recover praise god that's
[10:38] a sign of a christian amen
[10:40] thank god for those signs brother
[10:41] branham calls that the keystone of the
[10:43] of the church like a foundation of the
[10:46] church it's a necessary part
[10:48] to have the power of the holy ghost
[10:49] flowing through the church praise god
[10:51] thank god for that he does that next is
[10:54] remembering jesus's word so if you're
[10:56] born again you'll remember the words of
[10:58] christ
[10:59] john 14 26 the holy ghost shall bring
[11:01] all things to your remembrance
[11:03] whatsoever i've said unto you okay so if
[11:06] you're born again
[11:07] when you need the word god will send the
[11:09] word
[11:10] he'll make you remember the word you
[11:12] might not have thought about it but god
[11:14] will send you the word
[11:15] to help you remember at the right time
[11:17] next testifying about and glorifying
[11:19] jesus
[11:20] in john 15 26 and 16 14 he said the
[11:23] spirit of truth shall testify of me and
[11:27] he shall glorify me so if you're born
[11:30] again you will testify of christ
[11:32] hallelujah and then he shall glorify
[11:35] christ as well amen
[11:37] hallelujah that's our testimony bragging
[11:39] on jesus amen
[11:41] being convicted of and overcoming sin
[11:44] john 16 8 says he will reprove the world
[11:47] of sin when he comes the holy ghost
[11:49] so the fact that you get convicted of
[11:50] your sin is proof you're born again
[11:53] but then also overcoming sin for first
[11:55] john 5
[11:56] 4 says for who whosoever is i'm sorry
[11:59] for whatsoever is born of god
[12:01] overcometh the world amen see we've got
[12:04] to be one of those overcomers in the
[12:05] laodicean church age
[12:07] overcome and will sit with him in his
[12:09] throne praise
[12:10] god amen next number six
[12:13] will no future events and god has given
[12:15] to uh
[12:16] us to that through brother branham john
[12:18] 16 13 the spirit of truth
[12:20] will show you things to come
[12:24] somebody say like this we now from my
[12:26] understanding we know the fourth
[12:27] vision's coming driving the scars we
[12:29] knew that was coming
[12:30] right a state of undress i believe a
[12:33] greater state of undress is coming
[12:35] that's just me because i believe they
[12:36] got to be fulfilled in order i could be
[12:38] wrong
[12:38] but that's what i believe right and then
[12:40] what was the sixth one the sixth one was
[12:42] oh the powerful woman
[12:43] that could be the roman catholic church
[12:44] right or it could be a woman in power
[12:46] that the nation has to bow to that woman
[12:49] this this nation hasn't bowed to kamala
[12:51] harris
[12:52] as much as people want to say it they
[12:53] haven't bowed to her as far as that's my
[12:55] opinion i don't believe so
[12:57] but there will come a woman uh she'll
[12:59] they'll bow to that woman
[13:01] okay i believe it's the catholic church
[13:03] uh now
[13:04] and then the seventh is the destruction
[13:06] of america we won't be here for that one
[13:08] there's no way there's no way uh we are
[13:10] kept from the wrath of god
[13:12] because we are the children of god and
[13:13] we kept the word of his patience
[13:15] and last number seven will listen to and
[13:18] believe the human messenger
[13:19] sent to preach during their lifetimes
[13:22] because john 17
[13:23] 20 and 21 say neither pray i for these
[13:26] alone
[13:27] but for them also which shall believe on
[13:29] me through their word
[13:30] that they all may be one so the fact
[13:34] that you believe brother branham the
[13:35] fact that you recognize the fivefold
[13:36] minister
[13:37] ministry today that's further proof
[13:39] you're born again
[13:40] amen amen hallelujah how can you
[13:44] say you love jesus and deny the stars
[13:46] burning in his hand
[13:47] you can't you can't be born again and
[13:50] deny the very burning
[13:51] light right the burning light of those
[13:54] seven stars in the hand of god
[13:57] ah thank you lord amen all right now you
[13:59] got your bibles
[14:00] acts 2 42. let's read that now here
[14:02] church here's see we're growing
[14:03] individually in those seven things right
[14:06] we're loving each other uh we're getting
[14:08] remembrance from the holy ghost
[14:10] we're listening to the word of god we're
[14:12] knowing future events we're being
[14:13] convicted we're overcoming
[14:15] so we're we're growing individually but
[14:17] we've also got to grow together
[14:19] okay now as an encouragement you know
[14:24] and i've said this before and i'm not
[14:26] downing other churches who don't have
[14:27] two services on sunday i'm just saying
[14:30] we're trying to we're we're actively
[14:31] trying to do our part to gather more as
[14:33] we see that day approaching
[14:35] right we're actively trying to do that
[14:37] by gathering twice on sunday
[14:39] most churches don't do that in america
[14:41] so we want to do that
[14:43] uh and then we want to have fellowships
[14:45] you know like we did last summer and we
[14:46] want to keep like we did last week we
[14:47] want to have fellowships like that
[14:49] uh and when guest preachers come you
[14:51] know if they're traveling from far
[14:52] distance i try to do a friday saturday
[14:54] or sunday
[14:55] whatever we can squeeze out of our
[14:56] schedules we try to make a little extra
[14:59] sacrifice
[15:00] okay but look at the book of acts church
[15:02] uh 2 verse 42
[15:05] and they continued steadfastly in the
[15:06] apostles doctrine of fellowship
[15:08] and breaking in bread and in prayers
[15:12] okay and fear came upon every soul and
[15:14] many signs and wonders were done by the
[15:15] apostles
[15:16] and all that belief were together and
[15:18] had all things in common now i always
[15:19] remember when sister naomi told me that
[15:21] when she read that and she was so
[15:22] blessed by that being in the bible
[15:25] and that's how and that's one of the
[15:26] areas we have to grow
[15:28] together we have to be sensitive to each
[15:29] other's needs and if somebody needs a
[15:31] car
[15:32] let's help them out right we've done
[15:35] that before so
[15:36] praise god bless you your tithes have
[15:38] paid for that car i got for austin
[15:40] remember that
[15:41] because he needed a car to get to work
[15:42] in the church
[15:44] see uh there's other people i'm not
[15:46] gonna name but we've helped out
[15:49] right uh with with larger amounts of
[15:51] money
[15:52] because we should have all things in
[15:53] common everybody have food shelter
[15:55] clothing transportation
[15:56] if you've got if i got something you
[15:58] should have it too
[15:59] right that's a real christian family and
[16:02] if not then we're kind of like
[16:03] hypocrites right
[16:05] and we can we're not pointing fingers
[16:07] but we can see other churches how
[16:08] they're hypocritical
[16:09] by not following what this church had
[16:12] because whatever the church had we
[16:14] should have because we got the same
[16:16] spirit praise god
[16:17] right we got the same holy ghost the
[16:18] same water baptism the same love we have
[16:20] all the same holy spirit all these
[16:22] things we should have the same thing
[16:23] praise god
[16:24] amen that's right i believe that
[16:29] uh verse 45 they sold their possessions
[16:31] and goods and part of them to all men
[16:32] every man had need so
[16:33] if there's any needs church then i need
[16:36] to know if you know in need of someone
[16:37] who's a faithful tithe pair here
[16:39] i need to know if i'm not aware of it so
[16:42] you keep letting me know
[16:43] that way we keep we keep growing in this
[16:44] book of acts church because we are a
[16:46] book of acts church but we can grow in
[16:48] it
[16:49] so we've got to grow together right
[16:52] we're already growing individually we
[16:53] see that
[16:54] we've got to grow together as well we
[16:56] have to have the same care
[16:57] i have to have the same care for vang's
[16:59] family that i do for mine
[17:01] right if not i'm a hypocrite because
[17:04] this church
[17:05] had the same care they would sell can
[17:07] you imagine selling your house
[17:08] so you could take that money and then
[17:10] spread it out to everybody in the church
[17:11] can you imagine doing that
[17:13] i can't but i mean i i'm thankful they
[17:15] did thankful we
[17:16] thankful we haven't had to do that right
[17:18] we're thankful we had them do that
[17:20] um now they must have owned their houses
[17:22] because none of us really probably own
[17:24] our house right
[17:25] we're loaning it we're getting a loan
[17:26] from the bank to have it but
[17:28] this is the kind of love they had and if
[17:30] this is the original love
[17:32] there's only one kind of love and we got
[17:33] to have that same love
[17:36] okay uh now verse 246 and they
[17:39] continuing daily with one accord in the
[17:40] temple
[17:42] and breaking bread from house to house
[17:44] did eat their meat was
[17:45] with gladness and singleness of heart
[17:49] praising god and having favor with all
[17:50] the people and the lord out of the
[17:52] church daily
[17:53] such as should be saved because that's
[17:55] where we you know they met daily
[17:57] and that course didn't mean everybody in
[17:58] one gathering but they just met daily
[18:00] with each other
[18:02] so we want to make sure we try to
[18:03] increase our gatherings together
[18:05] amen it's going to be a challenge i was
[18:08] talking with brother amen maybe we can
[18:09] do like
[18:10] you know this is just an idea but maybe
[18:12] we can do supper like at vang's house
[18:13] what not he has work but we have to
[18:15] maybe do lunch or something you know we
[18:16] have to
[18:17] one night a couple weeks later have
[18:19] supper at naomi's house so we all bring
[18:20] food or
[18:21] something uh because if if they were
[18:24] constantly together
[18:25] then we need to get together constantly
[18:27] now it's a challenge because we all got
[18:29] children we all got work schedules but
[18:30] we can pray too
[18:31] we can pray if we really want to be
[18:34] together we can pray praise god
[18:35] which we should be doing right because
[18:38] we should gather more and
[18:39] because it's a bible command we should
[18:41] gather more as we see that day
[18:42] approaching
[18:44] okay that's we'll get to in a little bit
[18:45] that's actually the next one
[18:47] so see whatever this church had at the
[18:49] beginning we've got to duplicate it
[18:51] and we will because we have the same
[18:52] holy spirit praise god okay
[18:56] so see that that's our blueprint that's
[18:58] fresh after the church was born
[19:00] minutes days after the holy ghost fell
[19:02] and they were born again
[19:03] this is what this is what they did so we
[19:06] should do the same thing
[19:08] amen uh
[19:12] let me just say this you know when we
[19:13] first came in the message like my wife
[19:14] and i
[19:15] john lisa that's how we were we were
[19:16] always every weekend we're at each
[19:18] other's houses i mean during the week we
[19:19] lived so close to each other it was
[19:21] it was really nice we're actually for a
[19:22] couple of years we were just right down
[19:24] the street
[19:25] uh from john and lisa we're constantly
[19:27] over there together
[19:29] it was a real you know just really great
[19:30] times in the lord
[19:32] you know before we drive the lima
[19:34] sometimes we'd sleep at john's house
[19:35] remember that hunting
[19:38] it wasn't always easy you know just
[19:40] being in a different bed you know it's
[19:41] harder being a different bed
[19:43] so there were some rough times you know
[19:44] but we're just always together
[19:47] always together three hours there bang
[19:49] we would just drive there listen to
[19:51] music and talk and drive back
[19:53] that night you know just repeat it week
[19:55] in week out for a year and a half you
[19:56] know just always together
[19:58] um and that that's that's what god wants
[20:00] god wants his family growing together
[20:03] okay hebrews 10 24. let's look at that
[20:04] one
[20:10] i'm going to pull it up here because
[20:11] there's some greek words i want to look
[20:12] at real quick
[20:13] hebrews 10 24.
[20:18] yeah okay uh 10 24 let us consider one
[20:22] another
[20:23] to provoke unto love and good works now
[20:25] that means to
[20:26] this actually means to irritate right
[20:30] now we take that as a negative word
[20:32] but irritation right can be a good thing
[20:34] like with pearls right
[20:35] the pearl pearls are made through
[20:36] irritation right that's an ear that's a
[20:38] dirt irritation that gets in the oyster
[20:41] right and so it builds that pearl over
[20:43] time but so we should consider one
[20:45] another to irritate
[20:46] unto love and to good works in other
[20:48] words encourage them unto good works
[20:50] right
[20:51] if i irritate you forgive me i don't
[20:53] want to irritate you i want to be a
[20:54] blessing to you
[20:56] okay i don't want to irritate you
[20:59] sometimes i can't control myself so i
[21:00] scream and shout and cry and spit you
[21:02] know i
[21:03] i don't mean to irritate you but
[21:05] sometimes i just can't control it that's
[21:06] how it comes out
[21:08] like today about lost my breath i was so
[21:10] happy in the lord and so thankful for
[21:11] his mercy and his grace
[21:13] i just i just don't know how to control
[21:16] it contain it
[21:17] but see we we have to can look at one
[21:20] another and some
[21:21] i'll just use my brother bank i have to
[21:22] consider brother bang and how can i
[21:25] uh encourage him unto love and good
[21:27] works how can i be such a brother that
[21:29] would make him want to
[21:30] love and do good works how can i live in
[21:33] such a life where i can
[21:34] amen can look at my life and he'll want
[21:37] to be more holy and he'll want to be
[21:38] more like christ you know that
[21:39] that's that's what we have to do we have
[21:40] to consider others and how can we
[21:43] encourage
[21:44] them how can we uh not not
[21:47] how can we provoke them how can i help
[21:49] them to be a better christian right
[21:51] verse 25 here's how we do it not
[21:53] forsaking the summings of ourselves
[21:55] together as the manner of some is see
[21:56] there are some christians that they
[21:57] don't
[21:58] gather together more but exhorting one
[22:01] another now exhorting means
[22:03] to uh comfort it means to to
[22:06] call to address to speak to to admonish
[22:10] to beseech uh to console to strengthen
[22:15] okay to instruct to teach to comfort and
[22:18] courage
[22:19] okay so basically speak an encouraging
[22:20] way to someone
[22:22] and so much the more as you see the day
[22:24] approaching so see church
[22:26] uh if we're away from each other we
[22:28] can't encourage each other in the
[22:29] in the lord like i i like a text from
[22:32] brother amen but i like seeing him more
[22:35] right i like getting texts from mother
[22:37] vein but i sure like hugging him a lot
[22:38] more than that
[22:39] and just getting a text you know i like
[22:42] to hug you know
[22:43] i like to hug the saints and the
[22:44] brothers you know and
[22:46] there's so much more effect you can have
[22:48] on someone in their presence
[22:50] okay that's why we must assemble
[22:52] together more right no matter what the
[22:54] devil tells me when i'm about my mind
[22:56] battles when i get the presence of the
[22:57] lord
[22:58] and we experience the joy and the
[22:59] blessing of the lord we
[23:01] overcome all those bad all those mind
[23:02] battles just fade away praise god
[23:04] the music casts them out praise god
[23:07] right the music casts all those nine
[23:08] battles out then we don't worry about it
[23:09] anymore and
[23:10] you know we're all clean and we're all
[23:11] clear refreshed and everything but see
[23:13] when we gather together
[23:14] we consider how can i encourage the
[23:16] saints and how can i
[23:19] strengthen them and the bible said so
[23:21] much the more
[23:23] as you see that day approaching it's
[23:25] okay so
[23:26] it's it's it's commanded for us to get
[23:29] together
[23:29] more okay and so we've got to find a way
[23:32] to do that
[23:33] all right so just pray about that that's
[23:35] our vision our vision is find more ways
[23:38] to be together right find more ways
[23:42] to how can i grow to be a better
[23:43] christian right grow how can i grow
[23:45] that's my vision i'm gonna grow
[23:47] uh in my in my walk with the lord right
[23:50] i'm going to love more
[23:52] i'm going to do all these things jesus
[23:53] told me the lord's going to bring more
[23:54] scriptures to my remembrance praise god
[23:57] i'm going to love all the saints more
[23:58] i'm going to love other people more
[24:00] we're going to grow together
[24:02] now proverbs 27 17.
[24:06] this is iron sharpens iron
[24:09] now tell you that's really strange that
[24:10] they used iron because iron is always
[24:12] likened unto
[24:13] rome you know so i was thinking about
[24:15] that i don't quite have the revelation
[24:17] on that but
[24:18] as iron sharpeneth iron
[24:24] sorry i typed in the wrong thing and now
[24:26] it's taking me a long time to get there
[24:27] partner
[24:27] what was it 17 oh 27 oh
[24:30] sorry oh yeah sorry
[24:36] okay that's i saw talking about mj today
[24:38] too you know he's like wow
[24:39] he was just saying what the blessing the
[24:40] service was and i'm like brother that's
[24:42] why the house of god is so important
[24:44] a christian sharpens a christian
[24:47] right you're going to be a sharper
[24:49] christian by coming to the house of god
[24:52] and i hope it happens during the song
[24:54] service and the preaching
[24:55] and then i hope it happens in the
[24:56] parking lot or in the hallway
[25:00] iron sharpens iron so a man
[25:03] sharpeneth the countenance of his friend
[25:07] okay so the countenance is the face or
[25:09] the person
[25:10] the presence and the word sharpen means
[25:13] to
[25:14] make alert makes you more keen or wise
[25:19] okay so a wise person will make another
[25:23] wise person more wise
[25:25] right we make each other more wise by
[25:28] being together
[25:29] we make each other more keen to the
[25:31] enemy's attacks
[25:34] okay that's what we get we become more
[25:36] alert right he told us to watch and pray
[25:38] so the more we're together the more
[25:40] we'll be ready for us coming amen
[25:42] hallelujah we're more alert for the
[25:44] coming of the lord
[25:46] because i see brother bang living for
[25:47] the coming of the lord i see brother
[25:48] amen
[25:49] i see our sisters living for the coming
[25:50] lord we're all living for the coming of
[25:52] the lord
[25:52] it refocuses our sights and our focus on
[25:56] the things of god
[25:58] that's our vision is to be sharpened
[26:01] right
[26:01] uh to be more alert for the coming of
[26:03] the lord we sharpen one another
[26:06] praise god that's how we grow together
[26:08] we gather together more physically
[26:10] we try to think about how can we
[26:12] encourage one another and then how can i
[26:14] make my brother my sister more wise in
[26:16] the things of god
[26:17] right that's we want to sharpen each
[26:19] other make us more alert for the coming
[26:21] of the lord
[26:23] all right and then we grow the world
[26:26] revelation 10
[26:27] 8-11 this is what we know simon would do
[26:30] and brother
[26:31] jason demars
[26:35] brothers that do missionary work and i
[26:37] haven't talked to simon
[26:38] we're gonna have him preach out here
[26:39] then i can ask him so i just i keep
[26:40] forgetting i mean i can easily send him
[26:42] a text i can call him he's my brother
[26:44] i just keep forgetting uh revelation 10
[26:47] 8 and the voice which i heard from
[26:49] heaven spaking to me again and said go
[26:51] take the little book which is open
[26:52] in the hand of the seventh angel i'm
[26:54] sorry the hand of the angel i'm sorry
[26:55] which stand upon the scene upon the
[26:56] earth that's christ
[26:58] and i went to the angel and said give me
[26:59] the little book and he said to me take
[27:01] it eat it up and it shall make thy belly
[27:03] bitter
[27:03] but it shall be in thy mouth sweet as
[27:05] honey and i took the little book out of
[27:07] the angel's hand and ate it up and it
[27:09] was
[27:09] in my mouth sweet as honey as soon as i
[27:11] had eaten it my belly was bitter
[27:13] and he said to me thou must prophesy
[27:15] again before many peoples
[27:17] nation tongues and kings
[27:21] so we take the open book god has loosed
[27:23] the seals this is the book that was
[27:24] sealed with seven seals
[27:26] he loosed it in heaven brought it down
[27:28] to earth we've got to eat it it's got to
[27:30] become a part of us
[27:31] right it's got to become a part of the
[27:33] missionaries too and they've got to
[27:34] prophesy again
[27:36] before peoples nations tongues and kings
[27:40] what a commission i don't know how we're
[27:42] going to see kings
[27:44] i don't know how kings are going to hear
[27:45] this message but the bible said we've
[27:47] got to prophesy the kings
[27:49] okay that's got to be natural too this
[27:52] has got to be natural peoples natural
[27:53] tongues natural
[27:55] kings and nations okay god will do it
[27:57] god will take care of that just like god
[27:58] allow brother brandon to meet all those
[27:59] kings right that was all god's doing
[28:01] there's no way brother
[28:02] that's what brother adam told the angel
[28:03] how can i do this i got a 7th grade
[28:05] education
[28:05] i don't have any money and the lord said
[28:07] i'm going to give you signs
[28:09] i'm going to give you these two signs
[28:10] praise god amen and god did it god
[28:13] brought to pass for his glory okay now
[28:16] i'm gonna
[28:16] i'm gonna come back to that last
[28:18] scripture of course
[28:19] uh but remember this church remember i
[28:21] showed you this years ago here's all the
[28:23] here's our church and remember i showed
[28:24] you this a few years ago you guys
[28:25] remember this
[28:26] every now and then i'd like to break
[28:27] this out to kind of remind us so here's
[28:29] here's the nearest churches there's
[28:30] sheffield it's 63 miles north
[28:34] uh albion that's a johnny and then we're
[28:35] gonna head back there
[28:37] that's 112. now look at all these look
[28:39] at all this all these people all these
[28:40] souls in here dying
[28:42] lost going to hell or maybe foolish
[28:44] versions look at all these souls
[28:46] wholesale i preached there a couple
[28:48] times camden too this is
[28:49] uh southern pennsylvania there's a
[28:51] church there
[28:54] uh columbus now there's a couple of
[28:56] churches there that kind of get older or
[28:57] broken
[28:58] up um i'm not sure the state of those
[29:02] right now
[29:02] mansfield there's a church that's that's
[29:04] when brother aaron used to go to now he
[29:05] don't go there anymore
[29:06] but there's still a little gathering
[29:08] there in mansfield 65 miles
[29:10] and that's and that's where uh stephen
[29:11] now drives from he so he drives
[29:13] 130 miles every time he comes to church
[29:16] appreciate that sacrifice
[29:18] and so then here now here we are and i
[29:19] put all the green dots where there's
[29:20] message churches
[29:22] so no wonder jesus said the harvest is
[29:23] plenty
[29:25] but the laborers are few amen
[29:28] now jesus don't expect us to go down to
[29:30] every door right and knock on every door
[29:32] he don't expect us to do that
[29:33] but he expects us to pray for laborers
[29:37] he said pray that the son of man will
[29:39] send laborers into the harvest
[29:42] so we've got some of these boys raising
[29:43] up brother bang maokai
[29:45] zion we need some preachers and we'll
[29:47] see if the lord does it you know we'll
[29:48] see
[29:49] i'm no pressure guys no question i feel
[29:51] bad for brothers sometimes there's all
[29:52] that pressure to preach you know
[29:54] and you too brother amen bang no
[29:56] pressure brothers
[29:58] but you know as the as we pray the lord
[30:00] will raise up ones to go
[30:02] and remember the lord will only send
[30:04] them if he knows somebody is over there
[30:06] to receive it
[30:07] like remember he went to the maniac of
[30:08] gadara he sailed all the way across the
[30:10] ocean
[30:11] the sea just to save that guy and then
[30:13] he left and went back
[30:15] amen jesus went down to that uh samaria
[30:18] found one woman that samaritan woman at
[30:21] the well saved her soul
[30:22] priest of the city and then he left he
[30:24] said i need to go by samaria praise god
[30:27] amen
[30:27] in other words jesus will send us
[30:29] wherever he needs us to go like he sent
[30:30] me to chipotle with my jesus head on
[30:33] the fine brother mj there right
[30:36] right see he just he sends us wherever
[30:39] we need to go right a little bible study
[30:41] at
[30:41] a little college house with brother bang
[30:43] and devon
[30:45] like he'll just send us wherever we need
[30:46] to go but i'm just letting you know
[30:47] there's all this space in here
[30:49] and as i've told you i feel burdened
[30:51] this scripture says we must
[30:53] prophesy again amen we must tell them
[30:56] again
[30:56] what's going to come what's come is
[30:58] there america getting a revival no sir
[31:00] but there is a bride's revival praise
[31:02] god because it's
[31:04] in the word of god we must eat the open
[31:06] book the book is now open
[31:08] eat the open book and know the prophecy
[31:10] for this day amen
[31:13] all right now i'm going to go back here
[31:15] because i want to read this quote
[31:16] there are quotes where brother branham
[31:18] says
[31:20] their culture brotherham says the bride
[31:21] hasn't had revival yet but he's talking
[31:23] about the latter rain
[31:24] but there's other quotes like this uh
[31:26] you know
[31:28] 11 months before he died where he said
[31:30] the revival is going on right now
[31:32] it's the revival of his message
[31:35] but god rich of mercy has pulled us out
[31:37] of that chaos talking about
[31:38] denominations
[31:39] and let us see it before the thing hits
[31:40] here rich in his mercy send us back a
[31:42] revival divine healing and the coming
[31:44] again
[31:45] of the power of god according to history
[31:47] no revival ever lasted over three years
[31:49] this revival carried for 15 years it's
[31:51] been a burning fires around and around
[31:53] the world why
[31:54] because we deserved it god rich in mercy
[31:56] not because we desired it or because we
[31:58] deserved it rather
[31:59] just think what it's done so see brother
[32:02] abraham
[32:02] before he dies you know he's already
[32:04] telling you the revival is here
[32:06] there is one more latter rain revival to
[32:08] come but the revival divine healing the
[32:11] power of god
[32:12] the opening of the seals that's going on
[32:14] right now and that's the revival that's
[32:16] hit our church amen
[32:18] it brought you out of your denominations
[32:19] and brought you out of cma right
[32:21] it brought you out of there brought me
[32:22] out of the chapel and brought us out of
[32:24] pentecostalism and brought us to this
[32:26] revival amen
[32:28] the revival of the word of god the full
[32:30] truth restored to the church
[32:32] and that's what this book that's why i
[32:33] brought it out just if you ever want to
[32:34] look at it you can borrow it if you want
[32:35] but i put post-it notes where even the
[32:37] writers who wrote this book let's see
[32:39] what was it what year was this
[32:41] i think it was 1988 let me check
[32:44] so they wrote this pentecost so yeah
[32:45] 1988 so this is when my mom was healed
[32:47] of cancer they wrote this book
[32:49] they looked at the history of the
[32:50] pentecostal revival and all this pages
[32:53] so
[32:54] after world war ii brother branham's
[32:55] ministry started the revival
[32:57] and he said it's now affected every
[32:59] church in main street usa
[33:01] so any church in the usa that has a
[33:03] healing it's because of god's prophet
[33:05] amen hallelujah any church that's got
[33:08] the power of god
[33:09] or divine healing it's because god
[33:11] fulfilled revelation 10
[33:13] 7 amen hallelujah praise god the seals
[33:16] are open the mysteries of god are
[33:17] revealed

[34:01] it's uniting time i'm not sure what
[34:02] scripture that was the move is on the
[34:04] bride that's a quote

[34:07] walk our enoch type to walk with god
[34:09] laying in the presence of the sun that's
[34:10] matthew 13 right he'll harvest out the
[34:13] wheat separate the wheat from the tares
[34:15] and then it's time for the preparing of
[34:16] the third pole or ladder rain he calls
[34:18] it a shaving down time
[34:21] it's all these time it's the time of all
[34:23] these revivals all these moves of god
[34:26] all described in different ways but all
[34:28] rolled up into one
[34:29] we're looking for the coming we're being
[34:30] prepared the bride has made herself
[34:33] ready for the return of christ
[34:35] amen hallelujah so go to joel 223 then
[34:39] we'll go back to this here i like that
[34:41] picture it just
[34:42] encourages me
[34:45] so mj lives in canton
[34:49] see just so just just use your
[34:50] imagination for a little bit he moves
[34:52] he lives in ken let's say some of his
[34:54] family gets saved
[34:56] you can start a little church down there
[34:59] right
[35:00] and now look then the church if the lord
[35:02] willing a church would pop up there
[35:04] you never know right you never know
[35:05] what's going to happen
[35:07] so you got to be open to that i mean
[35:10] there was two brothers in calgary falls
[35:12] we thought were going to come you
[35:13] remember
[35:14] greg smith and keith king do you
[35:17] remember those guys we had two guys at
[35:18] that
[35:19] mo drive church i thought for sure they
[35:20] lived in calgary falls i thought they
[35:21] were going to come the message
[35:23] they received everything brother they
[35:24] received the godhead everything william
[35:26] branham until the serpent seed
[35:28] they just couldn't get the serpent seat
[35:29] i'm like brothers
[35:31] they thought because they were so caught
[35:32] up on the nephilim
[35:34] the nephilim were fallen demons that
[35:36] married women i'm like
[35:37] demons can't marry demons can't press in
[35:40] the flesh you know they
[35:42] but you know so we were so close i mean
[35:44] we've been so close to having so many
[35:45] souls come in
[35:47] but then the word comes they don't like
[35:49] it and they draw back
[35:51] but just think just think you know if
[35:53] all these souls that we witnessed to
[35:54] over the years
[35:56] you know it's a it's been a blessing but
[35:58] i'm just saying you know god can do
[35:59] things very quickly right god raised up
[36:01] a church in akron there was no church
[36:03] before here
[36:04] we're an answer to stephen's prayers
[36:05] right stephen alexander's prayers he
[36:07] prayed for a church 10 years before we
[36:08] got here
[36:10] so we're an answer to his prayers now
[36:11] there's a message church in akron praise
[36:13] god
[36:16] okay so joel 2 23 just again
[36:20] this is our vision we don't want to
[36:21] forget it it's prophecy you and i
[36:23] are going to fall into this prophecy we
[36:24] believe it all the years that the
[36:27] the church has lost from pentecost it's
[36:29] going to be restored
[36:31] it's going to be restored with a unity
[36:33] of faith
[36:34] verse 23 be glad then you children of
[36:36] zion and rejoice in the lord your god
[36:38] for he hath given you the former reign
[36:40] moderately that's the teaching reign
[36:41] brother ramsey's ministry and he will
[36:42] cause to come down for you the rain the
[36:44] former rain the latter rain in the first
[36:46] month or
[36:46] as it was at the first so if you look at
[36:48] the hebrew that can also mean as it did
[36:50] at the beginning
[36:52] in other words we're at the same holy
[36:53] ghost power that got the beginning
[36:55] and the floor shall be full of wheat now
[36:57] i like to emphasize this we should have
[36:59] lots of wheat
[37:00] and the fat shall overflow with wine and
[37:02] oil
[37:03] so wheat represents food wine and oil
[37:05] wine is the stimulation the joy
[37:07] and the oils the baptism of the holy
[37:09] ghost so
[37:10] overflowing imagine a church overflowing
[37:12] with joy
[37:14] we're almost there right we've got great
[37:17] services overflowing with joy haven't we
[37:19] praise god i know i have amen hallelujah
[37:24] services overflowing with joy
[37:25] overflowing with people filled with the
[37:27] holy ghost
[37:27] overflowing with word like wow that was
[37:29] amazing word
[37:32] i'm full on the word of god amen this is
[37:36] the this is
[37:37] the prophecy like brother william told
[37:40] me after service he's like wow
[37:42] he's like wow he said look at the word
[37:43] of god that came this morning he said
[37:45] and notice brother brown never even
[37:46] preached those things
[37:47] he said that's god getting in the that's
[37:49] the holy spirit getting into his word
[37:51] and bringing out further revelation from
[37:53] the word that's what brother williams
[37:54] said and he's been around the message
[37:56] for 40 years
[37:57] see you don't have to always say brother
[37:58] and said brother i'm saying that's good
[38:00] for sometimes when you need to know what
[38:01] a prophet said
[38:02] but once you move on you can move on
[38:04] from some of those things and go into
[38:05] more of the word of god things maybe
[38:07] brother ram didn't mention but
[38:09] everything you bring out will line up
[38:10] already with what the prophet said as it
[38:12] lines up with the word
[38:14] there'll be no contradiction same spirit
[38:16] but brother said it's not different
[38:18] revelation
[38:19] same revelation more information
[38:22] hallelujah same revelation more
[38:26] information he teaches that in the
[38:28] church age book as well
[38:30] okay this is what god is going to
[38:32] restore he wants to restore this
[38:34] and like i'll say like brother brandon
[38:36] said we've experienced this in a measure
[38:39] in a small measure right we've
[38:40] experienced a third pole in a small
[38:42] measure
[38:42] some of you have spoken to things and it
[38:44] happened
[38:46] right look at bang lane laying that
[38:47] prayer cloth on his dad two days later
[38:50] the power of god comes into place
[38:53] you know jose and i spoke to those women
[38:55] who couldn't have have children
[38:56] just spoke the word yeah i spoke the
[38:58] word too with your dad you know
[39:00] all those times we can think of all the
[39:01] testimonies see we worked it in a small
[39:03] measure
[39:04] but the bible said we're going to
[39:06] overflow with these things oh won't it
[39:08] be a time
[39:10] won't it be a time and see i i'm
[39:12] pressing towards that right we're
[39:14] believing that's going to come to pass
[39:15] we don't know when
[39:16] but we're believing that's going to come
[39:18] to pass
[39:20] verse 25 and i'll restore to you the
[39:21] years that the locusts hath eaten the
[39:23] cankerworm and the caterpillar and the
[39:25] palmer worm
[39:25] my great army which i sent among you
[39:27] that's the demon powers right
[39:29] all the things they've eaten away god is
[39:31] going to restore back
[39:32] that includes fellowship praise god
[39:34] right like gathering more as we see that
[39:36] day approaching right
[39:37] gathering together being together
[39:38] sharpening the saints praise god
[39:40] the gifts of the holy spirit are in
[39:42] there brother man teaches on that in the
[39:43] uh
[39:43] the restoration of the bride tree sermon
[39:45] the four bugs right the four insects
[39:47] same insect
[39:48] four different stages and they they ate
[39:50] away the fellowship the gifts and
[39:52] there's two
[39:52] two more things i can't think of right
[39:54] now but i'll think of it hopefully later
[39:56] i'll preach it later
[39:57] so god's going to restore back all those
[39:59] things the gifts fellowship all the
[40:00] promises of god
[40:01] verse 26 and you shall eat them plenty
[40:04] and be satisfied and praise the name of
[40:06] the lord your god
[40:08] that had dealt wondrously with you and
[40:10] my people should never be ashamed so we
[40:12] have boldness coming
[40:14] this this former rain and latterly
[40:17] latter rain will produce
[40:18] boldness and satisfaction amen
[40:22] we so satisfied in the house of god and
[40:24] with each other praise god
[40:26] right and we will praise the name of god
[40:29] amen
[40:30] this will be a church that praises god
[40:32] hallelujah
[40:33] worships god gives him glory because
[40:35] he's been so wonderful to you oh
[40:39] thank you jesus bye
[40:43] hmm yeah i came early and prayed with mj
[40:46] too i got here about 9
[40:47] 30. so i was up here praying and uh i
[40:50] was i spent that first maybe 30 minutes
[40:51] just
[40:52] praising god i was weeping and crying
[40:54] and snotting and
[40:55] it just flowing like a faucet but i was
[40:58] just i was just so thankful just to get
[40:59] to church and praise god
[41:01] for all the things he'd done when i
[41:03] remembered one of the things that
[41:03] happened i was at the
[41:04] library yesterday i was thanking god i
[41:06] just i stopped in the library and i just
[41:08] raised my hand i thank god
[41:09] because i was i was sitting by zion here
[41:11] on this little they have like a little
[41:12] uh
[41:14] like a toy bus right it's like a big bus
[41:17] i think the girls know what i'm talking
[41:18] about you're on the bus okay remember
[41:20] zion was sitting by me on the bus
[41:22] he was crawling off head first and he
[41:24] was falling off
[41:25] and i didn't even see it i turned and
[41:26] looked and instantly my hand went like
[41:28] that
[41:28] faster than i've never moved that fast
[41:30] in my life and i caught him like this
[41:32] and his head was down here and i just
[41:34] had my hand on his back and he was just
[41:36] like
[41:36] he was just like pinned there by the
[41:39] just by the grace of god
[41:41] he would have fell right on his head
[41:43] it's concrete floor
[41:45] they would have been screaming crying
[41:46] all these things and it was just like
[41:48] that brother instant
[41:49] instant and i was like oh my goodness i
[41:52] and i just raised my hands right there
[41:53] in the library and now they're usually
[41:54] quiet in there but you would have heard
[41:55] me yesterday
[41:56] you'd heard me saying thank you jesus
[41:58] thank you god i know the angels of god
[42:00] were with me because
[42:01] if you ask my wife i'm not that way like
[42:03] when kids fall i'm just kind of like
[42:09] but yesterday it was just the lord it
[42:11] was just the lord i mean i look
[42:13] instantly and and usually i'm not that
[42:15] strong right to hold
[42:16] a child like that i just like pinned him
[42:19] down against the
[42:20] the seat and half his body his head's
[42:23] down here and his legs are up here yeah
[42:25] just it was instant and that's not me
[42:27] that
[42:28] that's not my characteristics i'm not
[42:31] really a quick responder like that
[42:33] but i just had to stop and thank god uh
[42:35] because i see his hand in mercy
[42:36] otherwise what am i saying he's been
[42:37] wonderful to me
[42:38] how could i not praise him how can i how
[42:41] could i not praise my god
[42:43] amen he's been so good to me yes i just
[42:45] remember that was one of the things from
[42:47] yesterday
[42:48] okay so see god is building up a church
[42:50] who will never be ashamed a bold church
[42:52] that loves the word of god that will be
[42:54] satisfied with the word of god that will
[42:56] praise and worship amen
[42:58] hallelujah that's what we got here amen
[43:00] we got praise and worship praise god
[43:02] hallelujah and we want to overflow with
[43:05] wheat
[43:06] wine and oil thank god
[43:10] and god will restore all the things the
[43:12] church has lost god will restore it back
[43:15] i believe he's doing that i believe he's
[43:16] doing that i can see it praise god all
[43:18] you gotta do church is go to
[43:19] denominational church that's all you
[43:20] gotta do
[43:22] or just be around denominational people
[43:23] watch how they act watch how they treat
[43:25] each other we've got real love here
[43:27] we've got mercy forgiveness correction
[43:29] you know kindness you name it
[43:32] we got it you just got to be around
[43:34] other people for a while and you'll see
[43:35] you'll be really thankful lord thank you
[43:37] for giving us a wonderful church family
[43:40] okay now i'm gonna try to bring this
[43:42] down to close i got uh oh yeah six
[43:44] minutes let's play that
[43:46] now i'm just i'm just bringing these
[43:47] quotes out for more outreach okay these
[43:50] are same quotes i had
[43:51] i've shared them a couple years ago but
[43:53] the brand says do you realize the
[43:55] responsibility
[43:56] of this city of tempe here so let's
[43:58] change it to akron
[43:59] the city of akron i believe is resting
[44:01] upon your shoulders
[44:04] so we have a responsibility to save
[44:06] souls in akron
[44:08] right i believe that god has made you
[44:09] lighthouses each one of you you
[44:11] you have the responsibility of the sins
[44:12] of the city it's resting upon ministers
[44:14] upon the church people the pilgrims as
[44:16] we're journey journeying through
[44:18] don't you believe that what you're not
[44:20] afraid surely you're not afraid to take
[44:21] god's word god keeps his word
[44:23] god is not a god to say that he's one
[44:25] thing and then another if he promises
[44:27] anything then that he will do
[44:28] god keeps his word do you believe that
[44:32] okay so just think about the book of
[44:33] acts now church if all
[44:35] if the responsibility of sinners is on
[44:37] our shoulders what they do in the book
[44:39] of acts they just
[44:40] they they did outreach right but they
[44:42] kept all the sin out of their church and
[44:43] then the lord added daily
[44:45] such as would be saved so we got to keep
[44:48] gathering together more right
[44:51] keeping ourselves pure strengthening one
[44:53] another and then god will add to the
[44:55] church
[44:55] as he sees fit but at the same time we
[44:58] can pray
[44:59] at your seat or this altar and ask god
[45:01] to forgive the city of its sins
[45:04] and forgive our loved ones we can ask
[45:06] god to
[45:07] forgive this city of all their
[45:08] abominations now we know
[45:11] we know uh not everybody will receive it
[45:15] but brother mj was even telling us the
[45:16] member today he was saying
[45:18] uh the reason i i was delivered out of
[45:20] homosexuality because somebody was
[45:21] praying for me to get out of it
[45:24] and how many times have i prayed against
[45:25] the homosexuality right here
[45:27] and wept and cried for the abominations
[45:29] of homosexuality
[45:30] right here i'm not saying it was me but
[45:32] i'm just saying i was one of those
[45:33] prayers
[45:34] i wasn't the only one praying but he
[45:37] doesn't know how he got out he said but
[45:38] i know people were praying for me to get
[45:40] out of homosexuality
[45:43] see so see we we're not supposed to go
[45:45] to every door right we don't have to go
[45:47] door to door
[45:47] god will send them here right god will
[45:50] send them here now you can go door to
[45:52] door if you feel led like i want to go
[45:53] church to church that's
[45:54] really that's what i want to do just
[45:55] because i see paul doing that
[45:57] and i thought man if paul did that he's
[45:58] got the holy ghost i've got the holy
[46:01] ghost
[46:01] i want to do that somehow but i just
[46:04] want to encourage you you know
[46:05] this we've got a burden we got a
[46:07] responsibility to the city to get the
[46:08] word out
[46:10] praise god but iran said that ought to
[46:13] be if we believe
[46:15] the coming messiahs at hand i think we
[46:17] ought to lay aside everything else and
[46:18] be concerned
[46:19] of getting this message to the land's
[46:20] yonder as fast as we can do it that's
[46:22] right
[46:22] if we're convinced but we preach that
[46:24] there's coming a messiah and want to put
[46:25] a hundred million dollars in a building
[46:28] and if the messiah's coming what good is
[46:30] that going to do
[46:32] i believe see if i had a hundred million
[46:35] dollars i believe the messiah was coming
[46:37] i would support a missionary program
[46:39] that would sweep around the
[46:41] country see right quick and get a church
[46:45] ready for him
[46:46] if you had 100 million dollars what
[46:47] would you do
[46:50] he said he would do a countrywide
[46:53] missionary meeting
[46:54] campaigns just to preach around the
[46:56] nation to get everybody ready for the
[46:58] rapture
[46:59] okay so let's just consider this let's
[47:01] consider these quotes you know as part
[47:02] of our vision
[47:04] we want to reach akron uh we want to
[47:07] reach more people for the kingdom of god
[47:08] we want to send brother simon
[47:10] and brother jason to mars when we start
[47:12] hearing about them going on missionary
[47:13] trips again we want to give them little
[47:14] offerings to help them out
[47:16] but we want to see how else can we try
[47:18] to spread the gospel more
[47:20] how how can we get the word out more
[47:23] because
[47:23] because also church you have to remember
[47:24] there's no condemnation to us that are
[47:26] in christ jesus
[47:28] right if we're in christ jesus there's
[47:30] no condemnation to us
[47:32] so god's not gonna look and say well you
[47:33] didn't do enough missionary work on the
[47:35] day of judgment you're condemned you're
[47:36] going to hell
[47:37] that's not that's not part of it because
[47:39] there's no condemnation the blood
[47:40] separates us from all condemnation
[47:43] and then as we yield to the holy spirit
[47:45] he teaches us how to do outreach
[47:47] right and so now look at our lives look
[47:49] at our lives we're a lot of young
[47:50] families here right
[47:53] and we got we got to raise our children
[47:55] we can't neglect our children we got to
[47:56] pay the bills
[47:57] god's given us jobs he's blessed us and
[47:59] everything so we have to say god
[48:01] we want to we want to do our part how
[48:04] can we do our part well we can do our
[48:05] part by
[48:06] us growing helping each other grow and
[48:08] then asking god
[48:10] give us labors that we can send forth
[48:12] into the mission field
[48:15] and i i'd be willing to go i'd be
[48:17] willing to go i just need god to send me
[48:19] right i'm sure some of you others would
[48:20] like to go too
[48:22] just to try to go out and find anyone
[48:24] just to
[48:25] have a program to try to get people
[48:28] looking to the coming of christ try to
[48:29] get them to look at the word of god
[48:31] and the gospel does everybody understand
[48:34] you know i'm trying to say like we just
[48:36] got to be have a vision to
[48:37] and i've preached this for years now you
[48:39] know over and over over the course of
[48:40] the years
[48:41] but i just want to keep our minds on
[48:43] that you know we got to be open to the
[48:44] holy spirit
[48:45] using us in different ways to try to
[48:47] reach more people
[48:49] which like it might be me going out
[48:51] witnessing and
[48:52] you know having a guest preacher here
[48:54] like i said you know
[48:55] that's how i i feel like that's how god
[48:57] could do it
[49:00] okay
[49:02] oh i like this so brother perry green
[49:04] had meetings
[49:05] in texas and he invited lots of people
[49:07] to come here brother brandon preach
[49:09] i'm grateful to perry green and these
[49:10] brethren that's put forth their efforts
[49:12] to make this meeting a success
[49:14] if there's anybody lost in this city in
[49:16] this generation it certainly won't be
[49:17] upon them fellows
[49:19] because they've turned every stone to
[49:20] try to make it a success
[49:23] feeding the people see getting them
[49:25] places to sleep and
[49:27] on television everywhere just taking the
[49:28] money right out of their own pockets
[49:30] and placing it right out so they know
[49:32] that the crowds that we have wouldn't be
[49:34] able to support such as that so they
[49:36] took it out of their own pockets to do
[49:37] it
[49:38] there's my 45 minutes how many more do i
[49:40] got
[49:42] so brother ram said i think it's
[49:43] wonderful like somebody with a vision
[49:45] like that
[49:46] i believe it was said over in hebrews 11
[49:48] chapter of whom the world is not worthy
[49:50] and to stick their neck out in a time
[49:52] when the ministry is so unpopular
[49:54] against too many of the people that
[49:56] should believe it
[49:58] yeah let's stop let's stand on our feet
[49:59] there's 45 minutes right there perfect
[50:02] actually kept my word that time actually
[50:03] i shouldn't say that but actually kept
[50:05] my
[50:05] uh my limit i'll say it like that i
[50:08] always want to keep my word
[50:10] musicians you can come so church can you
[50:14] see the vision that i'm trying to
[50:15] project here by the word of god
[50:18] we all want to uh we want to see
[50:20] ourselves grow i'm going to pull that
[50:21] quote up real quick yeah
