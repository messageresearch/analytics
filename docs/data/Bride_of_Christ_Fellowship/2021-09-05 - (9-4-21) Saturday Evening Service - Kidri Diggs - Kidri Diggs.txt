lord not only just the speaker but both here to be able to receive the word in our hearts not just in our minds lord we want to be more than just a hearer of the word but we want to be doers of the word so we know in this time lord that many of people can quote scriptures and quote the bible in all forms and manners but the most important thing is to being able to live what we hear and live it

the preaching of the word to give us lord for any ways that's not like your ways and these thoughts it's not like your thoughts keep us under your atoning blood in the wonderful name of jesus christ we pray church amen amen amen you had your bibles let's turn to isaiah chapter 60. isaiah chapter 60 and we will go to um [Music] i believe i want john chapter one amen isaiah 16 the bible says arise shine for the light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon thee for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness the people but the lord shall arise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee and the gentiles shall come in thy light and kings to the brightness of thy rising amen let's go to john chapter 1 saint john chapter 1. saint john 1 and 1. the bible says in the beginning was the word and the word was with god and the word was god the same was in the beginning with god all things were made by him and without him was not anything made that was was made in him was life and the life was the light of men and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not amen may the lord bless you love his word you can have your seats let's give the lord a handcuff of praise [Applause] if i can by the grace of god i want to use for a subject the light has come the light has come now uh before we get to going i want you to understand this light i'm talking about is not a light bulb you know but this light i'm talking about is a person amen and this person when he began to shine it illuminated the whole world and you know as the scripture says in in and this kind of stands out to me in in verse in chapter 60 it says arise isaiah in 61 it says arise shine for the light is come and the glory of the lord is risen upon me so if we're walking in the light we're walking in god's glory amen that means that right now if you're standing in the right presence of light you have the right light in your life that the glory of god walks with you daily amen there's no darkness around you there's no dark habits there's no trials in your life that'll produce darkness no there's light there there's light there shining the pathway amen you know let's look at it a little bit deeper by the grace of god amen when i say deeper let's just go with time i'm not a deep preacher amen so that's not what i'm saying but he says for behold the darkness shall cover the earth are we there are we in that time where darkness has covered the earth and if you don't believe me like we said last night we said last night that man's heart and his mind and the imagination of his heart was only evil continually he was so evil that god said he was going to destroy the earth because the whole earth was in gross darkness amen but then god when he first spoke to the earth first thing he said was let there be what light amen hallelujah so god's first words to the earth was let me shine hallelujah hallelujah because god is that light amen now the bible says for behold the darkness shall cover the earth we're here church we're in we're in a time where this scripture is being a reality amen this scripture is being manifest right before our eyes you say brother jesus what you talking about my gross darkness gross darkness upon the earth because what should be wrong is considered to be right and what's right is considered to be wrong you could never tell me when i was a young man that now they tell me it's all right to smoke marijuana in public we're in that day well wrong is right and right it's wrong now they say it's okay to be uh something you're not it's okay to be a homosexual it's okay to be a lesbian ghost darkness has covered the earth church if you go to the beach by god's grace you'll see a woman out there in a bikini right because seems to be all right but if i if somebody breaks into a house and she's cutting her underwear she'll say no same thing she has on then it's the same thing she wears at the beach gross darkness has covered the earth and men's and women's minds they can't even see that they're in a time where they're living in darkness but we need light but the light has come amen he says for behold the darkness shall cover the earth and gross darkness gross darkness means a whole lot amen growth darkness the people amen but the lord shall rise upon thee and his glory shall be seen upon thee and the gentiles shall come to the light hallelujah so what god has done in the midst of all his darkness he's seen something that will shine in our life what did he do he sent the word hallelujah he sent a word that was shining our souls where we wouldn't get caught up or we wouldn't remain in darkness now the bible said in the people gross darkness so god had a sin a word hallelujah that would be greater than the darkness upon the face of the earth and we said in simple terms god sent the message hallelujah god sent the man with a message hallelujah that came from the origins and the in the secret places of god's mind hallelujah that will show us how to live that will show us what it takes to get to heaven hallelujah and through this message god continues to rest his glory upon us amen because it says arise and shine the light has come and the glory of the lord is upon thee amen so if you are sitting in what we call the message of the hour you are sitting in the glory of god but you must receive the light let's look at life for a second if we sit in this room close all the blinds cut all the lights out we'll be sitting in darkness amen but when we hit the switch hallelujah darkness scatters amen so what i'm saying to you tonight if you have the right kind of light darkness will never overtake you it's not powerful enough amen you can take the darkest day on the face of the earth and walk out there with a flashlight and it'll always push through hallelujah it will always push through he'll push through in the strongest hurricane all you got to do is have the right kind of batteries cut it off and the light will begin to shine hallelujah it could be destruction everywhere but if you got the right kind of light it'll show you where to go it'll show you what to step over hallelujah you're gonna be what does life do light it uncovers amen hallelujah because you can go in your house you know you just take for for for um spring most of your sister spring time you say okay that's the time to clean up that's the time to get the house right time for spring cleaning and what do you do you go through the house sweeping you go through the house cleaning doing all these things but what about those areas of the house that are dark hey man what do you do you open the blinds you open the curtains let the light come through so you can see what needs to be distracted from the house hallelujah it might be sitting in a dark room been there getting got molded and got a smell on it but once you cut the light on shine it you get rid of it because you don't need it anymore amen and that's what the word of god has done in our life god has shined god has taken the mildew out god has taken the old stuff that we've been holding on for so long and gotten rid of it by his life light uncovers things that have been laying there in secret that's what the word of god does god has come and given us a word and he's shed light hallelujah on the places of the scriptures that we didn't know anything about it was always there but the light came hallelujah so you can see what you see light brings forth of an understanding amen now i'm from carolina took me about nine hours to get up here now just say for instance when i get ready to go back home i take highway 77 straight back no i don't have to jump on 40 i don't have to jump on 26. 77 all the way there i got that bar i i i know i got to go through a search got to go through petersburg and and charleston west virginia and all these things you know go through charlotte and all that and i'm almost there so many miles i mean i know the way back but you know what hallelujah sister smith that will be a hard journey back with no light [Music] if i decide at the service tonight i'm driving back home it's going to be dark hallelujah no matter how much i think i know the way hallelujah that ride will be a very dangerous ride without any headlights so i need harley like hallelujah to show me where i'm going amen i might know intellectually uh i might know intellectually where i'm going but without the light i'll never get there safely hallelujah and we can ask people intellectually where you want to go heaven and hell everybody says heaven that's an intellectual saying intellectual thought nobody wants to go to hell hallelujah but let me explain something without the correct light you won't get there [Music] hallelujah because hell also projects a false light so we need light light shows that you're going the right way and you know coming and going hallelujah there are certain things there's there's certain landmarks there that the light shows me you're going the right way holly light is a knowledge of things amen and what god has done when he's come and opened up this bible through a messenger he's given us things that other generations didn't have hallelujah we have an understanding of what it means to walk by faith we have an understanding of what it means to have godly love hollywood godly peace amen hallelujah we're living in a day where the light in the glory of god is resting on us but why light why did god say let there be light amen let's go back to the beginning god created the heavens and the earth and all these things you know it was dark but then god said let there be light why because he knew when he created the earth that there was mysteries already laying there in the earth and the only thing that could bring it forth is the contact with the light amen amen church there's two things that you need to make it out of here two things you need to make it out here one thing uh let's take a let's take a seed there's two things that seed needs honey of course we know it has to be germatized but it can be germatized all at once i can take that seed place it up here on the pulpit an apple seed honey sweet apples red sweet apples i can have that seed place it here on the pulpit know that it comes from red sweet apples but it'll never be able to produce sitting up here you say brother it's in church is it a holy ghost atmosphere no it needs more it's a true apple seed but just bring it in the church ain't good enough there's some more things that it needs for that life to come forth hallelujah so one thing that it needs you just can't believe it you can't believe it but you know what every seed needs it needs some matter some form of dirt [Laughter] everybody in here got some dirt in their life hallelujah everybody here at one point or another you were covered in dirt hallelujah hey man you baby you have bad habits bad thoughts bad situations but you at one point were covered in dirt but let's get it right hallelujah we hungry the people of god we are good dirt hallelujah because don't you know a real seed it doesn't grow in any kind of dirt hallelujah it has to be good dirt hallelujah you don't you don't know you don't develop an apple orchard in clay honey but no it has to be dirt hernia that can give something back to the seed holy that's why you have trials and tribulations that's why you make mistakes and all these things because that dirt is there hurry up to pull things off of you so we all need some dirt but say it with me i'm good dirt honey and you know that when you die what happens to your body it goes back to the dust it goes back to the dirt amen but you know what church god allows certain failures and certain things to happen in our life hallelujah why because that's what you call cultivating the seed [Music] god allows certain things to happen so he could show how strong he is so he can show that he's stronger in the dirt now you keep in mind hallelujah you in a farmer's farming you don't know what he's planted unless he told you hulia is there below the dirt hallelujah but the dirt's not strong enough to change the life inside hallelujah all right no matter how deep it's buried hallelujah the surroundings of the dirt is not strong enough to change the life inside and no matter what you may have done no matter where you might come from if you got the seed of god your failures have never changed that hallelujah your mistakes will never change that because if god gave you the life he can't take the life back so we need some dirt but good dirt but you know what else that's he what happens why it's buried in dirt that dirt smothers it that dirt compacts it that dirt gathers it that dirt hardly suffocates it amen and what does it do it forces her the shell to let go of his insides hallelujah did y'all realize that when you bury that seed the life is not coming from the shell the life is coming from what's inside earlier but it takes dirt hallelujah to dry that shell out so he could break away and the life can begin to come forward but the only way listen church even in that moment holy that seed is not having contact with the light yet it's the dirt and the filth in his life here that's bringing it to another stage and i don't know about you but i got tired of living in sin i didn't even know who god was i didn't even know who a prophet was hallelujah but all i know is i got tired of the dirt and then god through his word start dealing with me amen and as god dealt with me the dirt hallelujah amen suffocated the shell and the shell began to break free hallelujah then the real me then the real you it began to come forward hallelujah and now it's just there's two things remember i said one was dirt hallelujah what was the other one light hallelujah even though that seed is covered by dirt it can still feel the warmth of the sun hallelujah he can still feel the presence of the light hollywood he can be covered and smothered in dirt but when his time comes it feels the warmth of another atmosphere hallelujah hey man and then it starts to feel some kind of a pool here that brings it out of the dirt and that's what the light of the world has done for you and i it pulled us out of the dirt it pulled us out of the nomination it pulled us out of the world and once that seed got above the dirt there was no going back listen listen the way a seed connects with the pool of the light it never says this is too much i'm going back down he never does that but the pool of the light is bringing out new stages in his life that has never experienced before so it was a seed then it turns into a plant and from a plant to a tree and trees puts out branches and then it begins to bear fruit and then the fruit did the same seed that originally was planted hallelujah oh that started with two connections dirt and light but the greatest of the two is light hallelujah because once you come above above the dirt light deals with you for the rest of your life in every season that tree bathing in the light brings forth fruit holiday year after year bring forth fruit year of the year bring forth fruit so once it gets in the presence of the light it experiences unlimited power remember brother branham said when that tree is this size every bushel that it will ever bear is already in it that's right think about that every bushel when that tree is just big this is you i like peaches you take a peach tree and get that bee holly every bushel of peaches is in it right then so i say to you when you come to god and you rededicate your life well you get the holy ghost holy every blessing is in you right now every victory is in you right now every promise is in you right now every connection every relationship everything you ever need is in you right now hell yeah i'm looking for a testimony because it's already in me there's just a certain time of season where it comes forward hallelujah amen the church listen one thing that i understand i ain't gonna be long y'all know about the clothes one thing you must understand the bible says in saint john it says in saint john like where we just read saint john the first chapter it says verse 5 it says and the light shineth in darkness and the darkness comprehended it not see people in denomination they can't understand why we live the way we live some of your unsaved family members can't understand why you live the way you live why you dress the way you dress why you do what you do they you know why it's because they don't understand the glory of god they're looking at the glory of god and they got a problem with it but but the scripture clearly says holy that the light shineth in darkness and darkness comprehended it not they don't understand why god will use a man hallelujah with a sixth grade education hallelujah why god hallelujah we used to use men in the bible like peter james and john they said peter couldn't even spell his name hallelujah but he was walking in so much light god said hey he got the keys to the kingdom [Applause] oh my and think about the church god is is all knowing holy when you step into this lightness glory hey man it's mind-boggling to the to the to the to the normal individual amen you think about it they thought they had an accusation against peter he denied the lord lord told me he was going to deny him denied him three times on the third time he was cussing but he still was in the light because jesus had already told him that the devil desires to sift you as weak but i have prayed for you hallelujah so before he got into anything that thing that he had to fight had to get through jesus prayers first so if you go through anything let's realize this god has to allow it because he's praying for you and you tell me what is it who is it that's struggling [Applause] foreign to give to you for it to give to you before i get to me god has to give him permission hallelujah because there's nothing stronger than his prayers remember jesus said i know the lord hear me always but he looked like he was walking in darkness when the man he cursed he swore he denied the lord and everything he looked at jesus looked like he was walking away hallelujah but even in that moment god didn't come back and say give me my keys back god knows hallelujah what you're going to do how you're going to do it and when you're going to do it that's how powerful this light is it shines in the midst of darkness in darkness comprehended it not they look at us all the time and they say you don't deserve it that's because darkness comprehended it not it ain't whether i deserve it or not is that we're elected to it hallelujah we've been elected we've been predestinated none of us deserve it hallelujah but we've been elected we've been chosen hallelujah hey man i love that pawn because you take a a a a prophet who had to stand before hundreds of men hallelujah who had uh lld's and cds and all these things and all these big degrees and they couldn't hold a table next to him why because he had true light see one thing about a prophet and i'm sure you notice whatever he gets he gets straight from god there's no mediator [Applause] so the light that was shining in our prophet's life it came straight from god so i want to say to you when you listening to the prophet the prophet is not your mediator amen you're getting the same treatment he got amen hallelujah amen we don't have to pray through a prophet so god can hear us no we go straight to god why because we're walking in the same light that's where people have made their mistake when i say darkness comprehended it not they say oh you're following a man and brother branham did this and brother branham did that we're not following brother branham we're following the lights we're walking in the light as he is in the light hallelujah and we have fellowship with christ [Music] one thing the white the light does it reveals it uncovers it gives direction amen that's what the light does and that's what this word i hope you understand what i'm saying when i say light i'm talking about the revelation of the word i'm not talking about led or whatever you call it hell yeah but just to just just to make it clear hallelujah you'd never get that light unless you got one instrument hello you got you need two instruments but you got to have a positive amen but you know what that light will never shine without a negative you need a negative hallelujah to see the expression of the positive amen just like driving your car your car would never crank without a negative ground you have the right gas the right spot plugs all the horsepower but without that negative ground it won't go nowhere and the sad part about it now they're making electric cars so everything about it all of you projects you need a negative and a positive in order for you to get good results amen and that's what god has allowed amen and what like i said in the beginning when he created the earth and the world and so forth god knew that there were mysteries laying there hallelujah laying there in the earth so he had to shine the light to pull out those mysteries hallelujah but what he did to get that light to shine he took each seed through a progress amen he took he took joseph hallelujah through a progress and it seemed like everything was negative but the light was always shining because in the time where it looked like everything was was negative he was still gaining ground amen oh listen church what you got to understand is every negative experience got him closer to his destiny look he had the fighting i'm talking about walking in light first he had to have a relationship with god amen he had dreams and god was giving him dreams and things and he go back and tell his brothers and told his mama so y'all told his dad say everybody you're gonna bow down to me they look at him man you crazy see darkness company that not they couldn't understand what he was talking about but then church hallelujah look at god we are not the question god sometimes what we got to do we just got to go with it you just got to go with it let me tell you how the person lord i don't know what you're doing but i surrender all right joseph joseph had to do that amen hey man he used his family hallelujah to get all these things going he used his father first hey man use his father first hallelujah to get the light to move in amen and darkness comprehended it not hallelujah you know he said that he had all those boys 11 boys say but he loved joseph the most holy and his brothers can feel that amen and they got really real jealous of him and then one day hallelujah he blew all these stacks on blew their minds they were so mad at this they just couldn't believe it one day hallelujah he gave joseph a coat a covenant coat hallelujah gave it to him in front of his brother and joseph put that coat on and you know what he did brother he spitting around that coat like he ric flair [Music] and his brothers looked at and said oh boy i i used to be jealous of you but i hate you now but you know what he was doing he was walking in the light darkness comprehended it not what was happening right there the glory of god was in that house hollywood because god knew hey his brothers had to go from jealousy to hatred to where they would sell him to slavery because the caravan was on the way [Music] but every negative experience got him closer to his destiny but you know what you we ought to rejoice if you're going through things that means there's you you're taking steps closer to your destiny amen listen first thing you had to fight was hatred and jealousy hallelujah jimmy had to go into slavery amen had to fight that did he get into potiphar's house hallelujah now he has to fight lust hallelujah hey man he has to fight the spirit of lust and he has to fight a lion demon oh my and continue to walk in the light because when part of his wife she was after him every day it wasn't just one time she was having a marriage chelsea chelsea every time you turn around joseph and joe's like leave me alone i got to work she's like joseph oh my joe's like please please just leave me alone and she's like chelsea and finally she just got so she was just so demon possessed she just tried to grab joseph like oh no i can't do it and besides my lord won't let me do it see you continue in the light hallelujah even though hallelujah even though he was sold into slavery he kept his convictions of what was revealed to him hallelujah he continued to walk in the light and part of his wife is probably saying i can't understand you man if this was somebody else he would have been seized the opportunity but joseph walking in the light hallelujah he had to come through a lush demon then she comes and she lies on him and say look you brought this man in the house look what happened and she was lying now joseph goes into jail hallelujah but in the jailhouse his gift was still working he was still walking in the lights look he said rise shine the light has come from the glory of god is upon me look even though he was going through all that all the people around him could see that there was something different about it he's in jail and they're taking note of him that's right he's running the jailhouse oh my church should have played the buck the butler and the baker come down they have a dream and joseph begins to interpret their dreams in jail holly still walking in the but you know what happened to people different things happen in their life and they get discouraged they wanna i can't understand this why would people getting scared discouraged the first thing they do they say i'm leaving church i don't understand that church is the first place you should be trying to go because you can hear the word and be encouraged but if you stay home hallelujah if you stay home you're going to get weaker and weaker and weaker amen but if you come to church hallelujah you open yourself set up to be encouraged by the word of god amen but the first thing people do is when they have questions they go talk to somebody worldly or some unbeliever and the first thing they're going to do is give them some negative advice fellowship in the light hollywood amen and now you look at joseph joseph to the place hallelujah he didn't dream for two people harley butler he interpreted butler's dream in the baker's dream and he tells both of them verbatim what was going to happen and it happens why because the glory of god was upon him amen hallelujah he had hallelujah heard straight from god amen and now he tells them what happens one dies the other one's just restored and joseph tells them verbatim he says hey don't forget me down here so now the next thing he has to fight is being forgotten and you know when people feel like they're forgotten they get depressed and now all these spirits are coming towards joseph but he's getting stronger hallelujah even though he's been forgotten holly the butler's been restored and he's doing his job and everything is good but joseph know he wouldn't be there he wouldn't interpret his dream right hallelujah but now joseph has to be to a place where he can be treated wrong and still walk in the light holly but then his day came hallelujah where pharaoh had a dream hallelujah dream of all dreams biggest dream in the kingdom hallelujah hallelujah and the servant said i remember my mistake hallelujah there's a man hallelujah in the jailhouse who's walking in the light hallelujah and he can tell you exactly what your dream is because he did it to me hallelujah so now pharaoh comes down remember all the stuff he had to go through he had to fight jealousy hatred lust hallelujah lying how do you fight being depressed and forgotten and now he's to the stage hallelujah where pharaoh's coming to talk to him why because he stayed in the light in our church what i want to show you is by the grace of god he interprets his dream hollywood shows pharaoh tells pharaoh exactly what god's going to do now pharaoh says hey hey man hey there's so much light in your life i need you to run the kingdom see if you let the light shine your light will be a witness to unbelievers and unbelievable want to fellowship with you as you walk in the light pharaoh puts him to a place where he's running the whole kingdom now what i want you to understand because joseph walked in the light and the glory of god was resting upon him everybody that ever did him wrong was now in his hands wow his brothers potiphar his wife the caravan the the the the warden in the jailhouse everybody was in his hands now let me say let me share something with you god will never expose you to true light if you will not develop the character and that's what the light is all about god developing your character because that light pulls out the mystery of the seed hallelujah if you plant that seed in the dirt nobody knows what it is but as it makes contact with the light the revealing and the mystery of what it is it unfolds in the presence of the light and that's what the lord has been doing all this time hallelujah of course they know who the husband is but nobody knows who the bride is but she's revealed as she walks in the light so you can look right next to the person beside you you don't know if they ride or not but the only way you know hardly who they really are by how they walk in the light listen far close let's go to saint john the fourth chapter we'll show you how powerful the light is st john four oh my you know it's very important to be in a in a church that's preaching the word of god when you're walking in the true light me and a friend of mine was talking i was on the way up and my desire you know um my i'll tell you what my unsupported request is i'm praying about moving you know i'm looking for a house and different things like that you know and it definitely has to be a move of god because every move i've ever made concerning that area god had to open the door for me so i just pray about it and and allow the lord to work his thing hallelujah hey man but you know me and a friend of mine was talking he want me to move where he got a good church and all that stuff and this and that and i was out thinking about i say bro that's fine i said but what i want is to be in the will of god amen i don't want to be in a church just because my friend is dead or my family is dead holy i can move somewhere i can move somewhere uh because i got a good job it's a nice area and have no fellowship with god somebody asked me one time i was doing a time share it was like well what about this place has they been there what about this place been there what about that place been there and she's asking me you said what would you what one place would you that you haven't been would you like to go i said hawaii she said why have you been there yet i haven't got a church invitation hallelujah so before you make any decision think about your spirituality first hollywood whatever you got to do holly don't go somewhere where you separate yourself from god every other area in your life is good but the god area is suffering i've seen it happen church i've seen people make decisions based upon living down here in this world no when we live down here we want to live for god hey man you remember there was a there was a there was a uh a man who the lord was telling him and this is a white man he said he said if the law would tell him to move to africa and the man was like man you crazy one of his friends like man you crazy gonna move to africa you got young daughters he said look brother he said if it's the will of god for me to move to africa africa is the safest place for my family what we want is to stay in the light i ain't moving arizona just because brother branham had a lot of supernatural events out there no amen i'll go as he leads [Applause] listen saint john chapter four and we know this is the story of the woman at the well and jesus said he must needs go by samaria but let's look at this look at the story and look at how hello god already knew what kind of seed she had inside but she had to make contact with the light hallelujah not a mirage but the real light because in that day you had sadducees and pharisees hallelujah but they weren't good enough to unlock the mystery of her life hallelujah what they did they made her feel like an outcast they separated her but when the true light came he unlocked the mystery of a life that's what the true word of god will do it'll unlock the mystery of who you are coming to this time you had sadducees pharisees very powerful uh religious men hallelujah but they couldn't turn out who she really was to them she was just an ill-fated woman a prostitute woman he said look now let's look at the conversation uh let's start at verse seven well i'm just reading let's go to verse four say and he must needs go through samaria then come as he to the city of samaria which is called psycho near to the parcel of ground that jacob gave to his sons his son joseph verse six now jacob's well was was there jesus therefore being weary with his journey set thus on the well as it was about the sixth hour now look at this church this is the lord jesus christ we're always thinking about what can the lord do for me what can the lord do for me but let me tell you something there are times where god wants you to do something for him and the way he's going to start this conversation not by him doing something for her but her doing something for him hallelujah you know sometimes before you get down and ask god about what you need maybe you have to say well lord before i do this i know you need some praise before i express my need lord i know your name needs to be lifted up so i'm gonna get down here on my knees and i'm gonna worship you i'm gonna give you praise and honor and glory i'm gonna lift your name on i because you're a great god you're a wonderful god you're a mighty god before you get down there oh lord i need to oh lord oh lord the devil do oh lord the devil sometimes we talk more about the devil in our prayers than we do god you know god probably sitting there doing this because all you do is talking about the devil you know your trials and tribulations are for your good look let's read well i'm at verse six verse seven there comes a woman of samaria to draw water jesus says unto her give me to drink holly whoa but see in her mind she got a reason and spirit she looking at his color looking at her color and say of customs me and you ain't supposed to be having no dealing she didn't realize she tried he trying to give her some water where she never thirst again he's trying to bring her he's trying to bring her to the light hallelujah but she'll never be in darkness again he's as far as disciples were going away until the city to buy meat then said the woman of samaria unto him how is it how is it that thou being a jew asking drink of meat which was a woman of samaria for the jews have no dealings with the smear see jesus is oh he's not always politically correct he will do the complete opposite of what you're thinking hollywood because he wants you to understand when you get to this level you're trying to get to it wasn't on your own merits it was strictly by the grace of god hallelujah then jesus asked to say to her if thou knewest the gift of god and who it is that saved the deed give me to drink thou wouldn't have asked of him and would have given thee living water the woman said unto him sir thou has nothing to draw with see the visitation was already supernatural he said give me a drinking ain't got nothing to draw with hallelujah sometimes jesus will ask you of things that you know you're naturally not capable of that means he's trying to step you into the supernatural hallelujah when you get in situations and it's a tight situation you don't know how and the scripture comes to your mind god wants you to operate in that scripture hallelujah she worrying about what he got to draw with oh my verse 12 are thou greater than our father jacob which gave us as well and drink thereof himself and his children and his his cattle jesus jesus answered and said unto her whosoever drinking of this water shall thirst again but whosoever drinking of the water that i shall give him shall never thirst but the water that i shall give him shall be in him a well of water springing up unto everlasting life that's why he didn't have anything to draw with because what he was dealing with he was dealing with the inside man see what he was doing he was shining light honey he was shining light with his conversation the word hey this is one of my favorite this is one of my favorite combos right here boy whoa the woman said to him sir give me this water that i made certain that i that i first died neither come here to draw now listen to jesus jesus said unto her go get thy husband and come in before hallelujah she can fully come to that place she supposed to be he got to deal with her sin and what is he doing he's shining light in the area of her life that's holding her back whoa let me read something to you church this is what the prophet of god says this is powerful when i read this he says now listen he says go get your husband that's the sin in her life that's stopping her from walking in the light but listen what he says this is what the part of god says he says and then when the holy spirit in him moved away her past and showed it to her that light struck it what was he doing by addressing her situation he was shining light on her sin that her sin could never condemn her again [Applause] when you're doing wrong and the word of god comes and addresses that role what is it god is setting you free cause he's exposing the devil hallelujah by shining light in that area hallelujah he said that life struck it she said i perceived out to be a prophet she said now we know i know it that that when messiah cometh that he is going to he's going to be and we ain't had a profit in hundreds of years we have never had a true problem for hundreds of years and she said how you tell me about my husband and told me how how many i have and so forth why say i don't understand what was it jesus was taking away her condemnation [Music] shining light on the areas that's been condemning her here and once he dealt with that she said i perceive you to be a prophet because the scripture says she says i got five hallelujah she said i got five in the one he said yeah you got five and the one you with ain't yours hallelujah why because it was the seventh one jesus that was gonna set her free [Applause] because seven is completion amen hallelujah and now she really met the true husband man amen and from that conversation now everybody else thought she was just a woman hallelujah that was trapped in all these bad relationships but christ knew she was bright [Applause] and before i closed although the disciples walked with him they didn't have the holy ghost yet so they couldn't understand what was taking place so what he did before he went dead he told him to go a different way hallelujah so he could deal with her and her conscience could be made clean without feeling the condemnation of those who walk with jesus and you know we do that in the message of the hour hallelujah because some some people live a little bit higher and some are on this area are struggling that don't mean this person is better hallelujah it just means that maybe they haven't gotten there yet because look once jesus introduced himself and shine the light in her life hallelujah disciples and her all of them was in the same boat then they were no better than her all of them was walking with jesus without the holy ghost experiencing the supernatural experience in the miracles walking with jesus could none of them brothers come up to her and say i'm better than you no she can say i understand who he is god just like you do because the bible says from that moment when he shined light on her sins and she didn't feel condemned anymore she ran down into the city saying come see a man hallelujah who's told me all things about myself and the bible says that the city came out upon her words to see christ now before that moment how many of the disciples ever did that and that's the way god has today his seed is already here his word the only thing it needs is light on it and he is that light for he is the word the word and the light is the same thing the life in there is the light of word she is the life the germ of life lays within the grain and the grain the life is what breaks forth and breaks forth out the life out of the grain that's the way that christ in the word makes the word do what it's supposed to do on you so while you're listening to the word what is it doing it's opening something up in your life [Music] he's unlocking a mystery hallelujah it ain't that we're better than anybody else it's just that god has made us in such a way that we can comprehend the light we can understand what's taking place hallelujah and now church because it is light god is given through a vindicated prophet we live day to day with the glory of god resting upon us hallelujah so when the scripture says arise and shine the light has come it's talking about you hallelujah because if you have received the word for your daily word for your hour that means you're walking in the revealed light and that means that the glory of god is resting upon you hallelujah so what we have is not just a church doctrine what we have is the shadowing of god upon us because nobody knows where the moon is and what it's doing until the sun shines on it hallelujah and nobody knows who we are and what we're doing until we came into the light hallelujah and you know they call us this they call us that and all these things but just remember when you shine light on something it never tells a lie it always speaks the truth you know like i said you can cut this room make it dark uh close all the blinds and all of us can stand outside and we have a guessing contest about how many chairs are in here yes sir right jesse might know but we can come in i said well there's probably about 80 chairs in here and somebody else said no i think about 60. somebody else would say well i think i think it's about 50 and then you can start counting the people but it's still gonna give you the correct answer the only way to know how many chairs are in here we have to come back in cut the light on and the light will reveal the number the light takes away all the mystery because then you can go one two three four you can just go oh no why because the light is revealing every spot [Applause] wow in the light of god's word is revealing every spot of your life every journey every move everything you ought to do if you walk in the light hallelujah god will stay in control of things so that's what we want church we want to walk in the light of the revealed word listen don't follow these people up to my the messages and the message that and brother branham this and brother brown said listen i don't care you can say what you want to say about the prophet you can say what you want to say about jeffersonville all that stuff as far as i'm concerned brother branham did his job concerning me all right introduce me to the light [Applause] i ain't looking for a greater light hallelujah because this light hallelujah it shines so bright that it never goes dark hallelujah it took away the mystery of service now i know who i served amen i serve hallelujah and how to get back to him to serve again that's what this message has done the people who are walking in darkness and comprehend the night not the comprehensive not the light they're putting everything on brother branham when it was never about him it was always about the one who would shine here amen amen and the one that is shining is christ it's like the trinitarians they believe in three gods right right the truth believe in three gods think about it you can tell they're walking in a false life because the scripture says god is a jealous god so if you get to heaven the trinity and doctrine are you going to worship because god is a jealous god you go to jesus the father gonna get jealous you go to the father god go get jealous if you go to you go to god the son gonna get jealous so which one is it it has to be just one [Music] [Applause] see church you see how important this light is we have yeah it uncovers everything and takes away we're not living by mystery anymore the message is no longer a mystery getting back to god is not a mystery has been revealed all we got to do is walk in it there might be some things you'll understand keep walking see it's just like when i drive other places and i you know some place maybe i've never been before hallelujah if i got the correct light i'll get there i have to pay attention to the signs and everything but i'll get there as long as i stay with the proper instructions hallelujah but i continue to walk in that light amen and so will we amen let's pray let's pray lord we love you we thank you for your word we pray lord say it help your people lord god you've truly given us lightning tremendous light lord let this light continue to shine in our lives not just a church light lord but the light of who you are [Music] god [Music] is [Music] jesus [Music] just [Music] me [Music] jesus [Music] [Applause] that's all i'm saying [Music] the light then you should have received them praise the lord [Music] [Applause] [Music] so let's have a moment our heads god's grace [Music] so beautiful to see how the lights stay with joseph throughout all the negatives in the midst of all the negatives there he stood walking the light while the world was in darkness hallelujah and he was a savior to the entire population [Music] thank you lord we just want to lord offer ourselves lord tonight on your altar here sacrifice lord god god we all want to be walking the light lord may we search our hearts here lord help us [Music] shine the light lord god in our hearts and our minds and our memory through something from the past something god that needs the light shine on it and we're aware of it god made we make it right now hallelujah if there's any darkness of sickness in our bodies in jesus name god may we let the light shine there may we haven't reached faith and confess our sins or if [Music] [Music] the glory of the lord is upon us and we thank you lord we see it hallelujah others see it on us oh god thank you god help us always remain in that light by your grace in jesus name one more time [Music] all [Music] jesus [Music] me [Music] is [Music] is [Music] revelation [Music] bye
