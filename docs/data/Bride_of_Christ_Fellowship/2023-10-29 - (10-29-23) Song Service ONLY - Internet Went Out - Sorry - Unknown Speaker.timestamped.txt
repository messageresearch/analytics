[33:55] grace Exodus 12
[34:05] Exodus 1211 we'll read 111
[34:09] 1213 I kind of had this thought kind of

[34:36] verse 12 and thus shall you eat it with
[34:39] your loins girded your shoes on your
[34:41] feet and your staff in your hand and ye
[34:43] shall eat it in haste it is the Lord's
[34:45] Passover let's read verse 12 together

[34:51] the land of Egypt this night and will
[34:54] Smite all the firstborn in the land of

[35:04] judgment I am the Lord I'll read verse
[35:08] 13 and the blood shall be to you for a
[35:10] token upon the houses where ye are and
[35:13] when I see the blood I will pass over
[35:16] you and the plague shall not be upon you
[35:18] to destroy you when I smite the land of
[35:21] Egypt praise God how many thankful for

[35:31] Deuteronomy 10 verse1 17 we'll read that
[35:33] as
[35:36] well Deuteronomy 10 verse
[35:41] 17 there's one of the I think there's
[35:44] five or so scriptures that call God the
[35:46] Lord God of
[35:49] gods Deuteronomy 10 ver 17 and
[35:55] 18
[36:00] verse 17 says for the Lord your
[36:03] God is God of gods and the Lord of lords
[36:09] a great God listen to How it describes
[36:10] him a mighty and a
[36:13] terrible which regardeth not persons nor
[36:17] taketh reward you can't bribe him you
[36:18] can't play around with him you can't
[36:20] pretend with him he's a great and
[36:21] terrible almighty God he doesn't respect
[36:25] one person above another aren't you glad
[36:27] children should be glad women should be
[36:29] glad young people old people everybody
[36:31] should be glad he doesn't respect
[36:33] persons Verse 18 he doth execute the
[36:37] Judgment of the fatherless and the Widow
[36:40] and loveth the stranger
[36:42] Hallelujah giving him food and rment
[36:46] let's have one more word of prayer if
[36:47] you have a need on your heart let's make
[36:48] it known unto God Heavenly Father we
[36:51] come to you you're the Lord God of gods
[36:54] and we worship you today Lord we' read
[36:56] your scripture here this is just taking
[36:58] a topical context here Lord God I pray
[37:01] You' to anoint me anoint your people
[37:02] Lord that's what causes all the
[37:04] difference is the anointing of the Holy
[37:05] Spirit directing Us by the word of God
[37:08] hallelujah so may we have both spirit
[37:10] and Truth the anointing and the true
[37:12] revelation of the word of God today as
[37:14] we always desire Lord God to be true
[37:17] worshippers so father just take control
[37:19] now of the service I pray You' minister
[37:21] to the needs of your people these are
[37:23] your sheep the Bible say
