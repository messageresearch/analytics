bought a card back there for brother John his family's out traveling they're having a vacation this weekend likely to sign in thanking for his 11 years as the church officer just say thank you or god bless you or thank you for your service I haven't signed it yet but I thought I'd set it out there after service you try to do that actually work out if it wasn't here today this family was out traveling couldn't do it last week is easier one of the situation's so if you would do that I appreciate that also once brother Lawrence does his special I just had a little sheet here last year I passed these same sheets out I just said if you have any questions this is like the middle of the year it's nice to you know stop in the middle of the year and see if there's any questions about any sermon content or anything like that there's three things on here the first one is you have any suggestions for Van Nuys the church officers and the Deacons think do anything better does the pastor you do anything better so if you have any suggestions or the trustees there's anything physical with the building we could do better you would like your suggestions on that or if you're interested in serving in a in a office and you meet the qualifications you know your let me know about that the second thing is questions and answers last year I hand them out I didn't get any back so I guess

desire meeting with me or just some fellowship with me I know my most of my fellowship comes on Sunday between services and after second service that's the most time I have for fellowship because

more we're grateful this morning or as as you said Lord with your on the earth you said the Holy Spirit would bring all things to our remembrance let's do that this morning Lord we've heard a lot and we've read aloud you're studying a lot in our view we know a lot north perhaps but father bring what we have need up to remembrance this morning or what would be needful in this our Lord Jesus we give you glory use it as a vessel bless your people Lord God we're here in your presence to soar with you raise us up Lord set a win to the Holy Spirit that we can stretch our wings and fly or not with you this morning speak to us through thy word Lord as it has never failed Lord we expect you to move Lord we look or to your sphere moving amongst us here we thank you for it in Jesus Christ's name to reset the study bodies this morning praise the Lord let's go I want to look at the series of the baptism of the Holy Ghost we'll go back to that this morning or just kind of in another and a different sermon I was going to priests last night but then this morning I woke up and prayed and I just felt led to go this direction so I'm gonna go with this let's go to Psalms 104 verse 15 s are there Psalms 104 15 over Luke 536 was one of 415 I don't have any slides today or quotes I prepared all that yesterday I thought I was going to preach that message I just got notes and you don't have to look at me today or close your eyes and pray or something like that but thankful for God's grace appreciate the Saints pressure up to the house of God to be like to preach on the oil in the line today by God's grace I can determine that's kind of what message has been on the heart this morning so I can preset Psalms 104 verse 15 of course we're going to take a type out of this not a natural application although it could be you know but to the spiritual side of this Psalm 104 verse 13 and why that maketh glad the heart of man and oil to make his face to shine and bread which strengtheneth the man's heart you want to look at all these in the spiritual aspect the wine today because we would only take natural wine if it was communion well it's not going mean in Sunday so I'm going to look at this in the in the fact the avenue of the Holy Spirit is wine and the oil not so much talking about our natural basis but our spiritual base our presence and then the bread of course which is God's Word amen let's go to Luke chapter 5 36 and he speak also a parable unto them no man where the piece of a new garment upon an old if otherwise then both the new maketh a rent and the piece that was taken out of the new agree if not with the old and no man put his new wine into old bottles else the new wine will the bottles and be spilled and the bottles Shall Perish but new wine must be put into new bottles and both are preserved no man also having drunk old wine straightway desired new where he saith the old is better name as far as one more time forward prayer don't need on your hearts make it unto God Heavenly Father or my hands up I've need of you Lord that's your people this morning physically those present here in the building and those live-streaming father may we feel your presence and we rejoice in your presence let me just be Lord a vessel channel each one of us Morgan the channel of faith Lord God to receive the promises or to believe the promise mode we just thank you for this time father that your spirit dwell amongst us now Lord as we look to you Lord you said faith comes by hearing hearing by the word of guys nor we hear your words this morning help us to hear them and believe them Lord and you know they'll take effect we thank you for that in Jesus Christ's name everything how about if she pays increase I think it's been quite a while since I preached on the oil line so I just got to felt led to to go this direction this morning the last time I preached on the the batches of Holy Ghost series was last month so I'd like to pick that back up again I still got a lot to do but I want look at oil mine this morning a Wednesday night if you didn't this and that I think you'd be blessed we looked at the last message of the thirteen church age and looked at stars at the end on Christ is the morning star hope you enjoy that and that was a wonderful I left stirred up I stayed stirred up amen I've been stirred up so very thankful that could mean one of God's stars amen but ultimately Christ is the warning star praise the Lord the great star the North Star so let's look at this star here this morning oil light and then more willing tonight we have another service Lord willing at four o'clock by God's grace I was feeling sick this morning as well but I feel a lot better now must be the anointing but I'm trusting that I'll be able to minister again at 4 o'clock by God's grace so let's just trust the Lord to give us His mercy today so let's look at oil wine again if you're familiar you know with the message your brother Brandon you know the majority of the times he preached on the oil wine was in 1963 during the series of the seven seals we know by God's grace so if you look it up there I think there's 22 hits in 1963 the other years just have a few hits every now and then but he started preaching a pretty heavy of course in the seals the third seal and four seal and then had a lot of questions and the questions and answers on this seal how many know that the seals were given to us with the state the law and the revelation behind the symbol none I have any word and that's what Christians need to understand that follow the message not every word brother Brandon ever said was the state the Lord because he said I'm not infallible right brother Branham said that he said I'm not infallible he said in fact if you call me infallible brother Branham said that's one of the most awfulest things you can do so I'll be showing folks on that recently brother Branham was infallible but when God would tell him what the word meant that's in family and so that's what we had with the seven seals and that's why I mean so much to us the seven seals of the seven Church ages because it's God's interpretation of his own word through a prophet and God said surely if I do anything I'll do nothing except I give my secret to my servants the prophets and so we're thankful that God has given us the revelation of this hour and what is it there for to do the seals were there to show us the four works of Satan that we might overcome that praise the Lord and the church age is broken document further the four before horse riders and four anointings you know we we take all the anointing of the ego in our day but in every man's day had a different anointing right before anointings that's why this seals means so much to us now the church ages is just the more detailed look at those anointed right as we've been seeing that with by tira any of those believers were under that oxen team they freely their lives they increase their work just like an ox works really hard right a cow we work really hard you don't because they're beasts of burden so the church ages gives us a more detailed look that's why we're blessed to go through that and I can said last week you know if we're not interested in church ages now we would have been interested in 1960 right so we got to be hungry and thirsting on the Word of God which we are amen and though as I told you Turkey has have to trust me and maybe on that day God showed you but these church Angels have truly given us understanding of where our church is right now yeah yeah because the the faithful those that are pressing on the overcomers are overcoming all those temptations that we've been preaching on and you've heard me as a pastor and you'll get used to it you know you father's are you ready if you have children you have to deal with some of the same things over and over again right fathers grandfathers yep yeah you sometimes you have to deal with things mother's let the deal with things over and over stop some of that sometimes the problems just don't disappear how many know that you have to deal with situations again and again what is it doing it's building your faith it's testing your patience and so as a pastor you hurt me you don't preach all things over and over again a lot like church attendance right and faithfulness and tidying it love for God and worshiping God and coming to the house of God leasing but I've got to do that because that's what the church ages are all that's one of the main things about the church changes is being in the house of God loving God and serving God right it's one of the most important things and I hope that's been made clear I've just but and I had to stop this morning if you just bear with me you remember in acts 20 when Paul was leaving Ephesus what'd he do he warned down for three years with tears that wolves would come in I remember that from the scripture the Bible said day and night he warned them with tears that was were coming now bite of a master if I focus on something for six months or I gotta warn the church for six eight months or five months or two months and I hope you'll bear with me by God's grace because we've got different things attack the church if you've been watching the church as a whole you know and so we're just trying by the Holy Spirit to stay with the Word of God and it just shows you that I love you that I try to keep you away from those things number my backside Illinois one man and one woman with the poison of sin and that the neck it'll be a cancer and he'll try to say we'll try to spread that through the whole church but brother Branham said you just love them he said either that person more debt and be one of you or God will drive them away you understand that by God's grace so see I'm aware of thing I'm aware of situations and what we're trying to do we're trying to keep the poison out we're trying to keep divine love as our weapon praise God divine life so I just want to start with that now oil and wine there's a lot of great quotations on this which we'll get to some of them of course you won't be able to finish it all by the grace of Lord but we started off in the natural I want to look at some scripture Mike and just let me um if I can just a moment let me just read a short quotation and questions answers on the seals yes brother grant what does oil and whitening and questions answers on the seals he said oil as we took in a symbol means the Holy Spirit wine and oil is connected together the Bible we know that there's 40 verses where why did I are in the same verse raised the large just like wisdom and knowledge if you look a lookup wizard now sometimes you'll find I think there's 80 or 90 scriptures on wisdom and knowledge they always go together because they're connected together you can't happened it you can't have a wisdom of God's you have the knowledge of God you can't you have to first know what the Bible says then you get wisdom so it is with the Holy Ghost you have to have the baptism of the Holy Ghost right and that brings stimulation of Revelation that's exactly right through David Laury I said in why he said the stimulation wine stimulates now I felt like was it depressant but I'm going to show you some science here from an article I found just this morning that says wine is actually a stimulant that was really good as from 2017 program said what stimulates the church so if I ask you much stimulates you know what your editor ah to be revelation any man revelation means the unveiling of the truth amen so when something you didn't know before and God makes it known to you and all to make you really excited a man all right right because that's the operation of the line he's to stimulate you by God availing something you didn't know before it might be something personal maybe something that might not be so maybe maybe at the Bible you are aware of but just how that situation applies to your life amen or maybe something I never go to this about that I never knew this parable type that I never knew that Old Testament character roof type this I never knew that so it can work cover God implanted to work like last Sunday I got a good stimulation in artuz EQ where it set on those feast days you can't go in and go out the same way when you come into the outer core you have to leave a different way that you came there was too many people for you to turn around you know the outer court go worship and then you'll just back out there's too many people the one the way you came in you had to go out a different way and that's my brother Graham said you can't leave this service different or you can't leave even the same you got to leave different praise God and also the other idea was they don't want you to turn your back you know to the to the sacrifices they always lend you to face it um they want you to turn around if you go out the same way we always want to put our face towards God's face how many want to look in the face of God again you're holding this night but I look into your face my look into your presence a bit so that's to me that's revelation that stimulates that stimulates me I want to read the Bible more because I can see more Troost through those golden nuggets we'd say or those types and shadows for our day I love the day met that's why I love the Word of God was constantly unfolding now program said oil wine went together he said in the church worship notice assemble together connected together so when we're together oil and wine needs to go together there you go today I said if you got a concordance you look and see the whole thing wine oil is met together worship if you got it crew didn't why it says it there I notice this oil is always the Holy Spirit we find that in Ezekiel he said we find it on the New Testament why do we anoint the sick with oil we annoy the sick with oil because it symbolizes the pouring out of the Holy Spirit of all men the wise virgin had oil the unwise had no oil spirit see that is the oil and then the why did the oil represents God God is the spirit he said I didn't know that the other day so sitting there he said what does the oil line represent see that you hurt that that was the black horse rider and that was during the time of the Dark Age my man said I believe if you get that the third seal tape you'll find it there these gods as we understand it by God's grace oil is the Holy Spirit wide is the stimulation of Revelation praise God now here's the art of God isn't mentioned here I want to read this real quick it was on NPR that's also on CBS News it was a Pro 80th this year it said are you looking to give your brain a workout just pour yourself a glass of wine now we don't do that except for communion a scientist from Yale School of Medicine says drinking red or white wine sparks a reaction in both the sensory and emotional parts of the brain glory hallelujah your senses see your five senses and then your emotions are touched when they're affected when you drink wine haha oh yeah essentially when we're sipping our favorite vintage now of course we're talking about Holy Ghost now it takes the brain a lot of work to process exactly what we're drinking the brain activity is similar to if you're solving an equation you never try to solve something you're mounted and plan something out or coming up with a solution to a problem so when a person drinks national wine it's like their brain is trying to solve a problem and all their senses are X sighs and you're ready to solve the problem I like how that sound oh you when you get a good drink of the Holy Ghost what's it make you dude solve the problem that Satan's placed in your life I with me you're a mole ready to have your senses exercised towards the things of God when we're drinking off the line of the Holy Ghost amen I notice it also it affects your emotions that's why you have emotional drugs right and that's why I gotta have some when the Holy Ghost Falls it has the same effect as a drunk man in the natural as it would in the spiritual brother ramsett you don't look for emotion when the Holy Ghost Falls but it comes with it hey just like that's right that's right moves your emotions so does the Holy Ghost Rooter motion I'm starting to get happy now ain't it you see because it starts but you talk about God you start getting happy because God is love God is not depression not his victory in enemy God's love amen thank you Jesus he's love and that's what our scripture said it number the Bible said oil makes his face to shine what me Steve is so different when they stoned him he had the face of an angel and at the base the devil's both thought their doctrine was right like you saw Wednesday both will say their doctrines right but only one of them was right and the man with the angel anointing on his face the man with the oil rubbed upon his face at the Holy Ghost upon him that was the true believer amen remember your face represents the presence right so when we say oh we have the line I'm sorry when the oil when the oil rubbed upon our face it means the Holy Spirit is our pet is on our countenance in other words when you look at somebody you should see a real believer in man you should see somebody who's fighting for Christ someone who's in love with Christ you should see someone who is walking in the spirit amen to that because it's rubbed upon the face just like the natural benefits to oil there's you know my wife wrote a book on essential oil so I didn't ask her but part Brisas I promise you that but uh but I just his thought was kind of inspired to me this morning knows I have much time to talk Danny by the support but there's many effects to the natural oil as you know there's a Roma therapy topical therapy cooking and vitamin e D and others there's so many benefits to oils there's healthy oils that are unhealthy oils but oils have such amazing effect upon the individual it touches every area of a person's health let me know that oils you can smell them in you can rub them on you can eat them you know that they minister to the whole body you believe that and then why simulates the brain and why i stimulate your mind no wonder the Bible said be renewed in the spirit of your mind see you need to wait when your vibe is is weak and you're struggling and my battles we need a good drink of wine praise God that will help us to solve the problem that Satan's put in front of us that's exactly right being renewed in the spirit of my number don't forget this and greatest by the overflow I was listening to this week brother branham said the battlefield is your mind and he said it's a no-man's land let me know that so see your mind is such a delicate place Church it's a no man advantage it's not a place that it's not a good place to 12 unless God's presence is there our thoughts can cause us to lose sleep right worry our thoughts can cause us to be fearful and anticipate things that aren't even going to happen right jump into conclusions our minds can get still so bent on something that we can't get out of it right we just we're directing a certain way I've just got to buy this I'm just going to go to this we just got to do that it's a no man's land the mind is a very dangerous place that's why Satan attacks even in the mind but we need God's anointing we need to drink on the Spirit of God that will stimulate our minds to solve the problem brother have said God's children have the devil's answer to this question amen so the Holy Spirit gives always gives us the answer to Satan's questions how to do you but does anybody love you are you good for anything does God even care about you the Holy Ghost has all the answers to solve all your problems will you be healed or not the Holy Ghost has an answer a man every word of God is he a man under the video it's exactly right now I'm not having time I don't want to spend most of my time on on these scriptures on all the scriptures like I said there's over 40 but I just want to hit a few highlights here by the grace of the Lord why makes the glad the heart of a man but see when you see people happy in the lore what's happened they've drunk it up the line of God right they're happy in the Lord and the Bible said I'm Mary Hart makes good medicine right that's why you see billboards they'll put children's smiles on billboards why would they do that why would they put somebody smiling you know for a hospital side we don't smile and go to the hospital it's usually a problem we go to the hospital right why do they put that there because a smile can change an atmosphere right the joy and evanescent natural joy but what about a spiritual joy praise God why makes glad the heart of man and you've heard I don't have it in front of me but I've read studies where wine is good for the heart if you had my wine in moderation that's why would you continue that's one reason of communion that's not the only reason that just one a small reason light of itself is a good thing but we must have temperance praise God it's exactly right oil makes the faces shine and then that last person I guess not much on time because I just preach on that lot but the bread which strengtheneth the man's heart so wine makes your heart glad and bread get your heart rate so gladness to the art through the wine and then strength through the bread or the Word of God I'm about to trip but when I come and hear the word of God I come and preach the Word of God and I get under the anointing of God I get stronger I don't get weaker I don't I don't start as quote no dowdy clothes I don't start doubting or quoting safety then this Dallas I just keep quoting the Word of God amen that's what it does is the real bread of God strengthened to heart and then when the wise there makes you happy in the Lord amen thank you lord now I'm going to read out of Easton's Bible dictionary because mother Graham said he was reading curtains Bible dictionary but it says olive oil seems to be most used amongst the Hebrews it had many purposes it anoints the body or the hair so you anoint the body with oil good type of the Holy Spirit now like this one a damn time to study on this one but maybe later the oil and wine were using numerous offerings such as the meat offering right there was other ones too oh yeah the daily sacrifice always they had to have wine and oil okay you see that church how important is for us to be glad every single day I'm just a lord help me with that to be happy every day help me to offer sacrifice a man of Prayer so I can have oil I can offer oh I don't mind every single day amen it was a daily worship and then it was a meat offering worship which were scheduled you know those were different scheduled of feasts and some were like that and remember it was a meat offering but there's no heat involved it was actually bread which is what more fellowship more communion with Christ and I like that amen because his bread is neat it is deep it's rich holiday all right amen I just want you to say that I want you to stop for a moment and think about that our offerings to God are not accepted unless they're done the right way yeah to be with me what does that mean I'm not trying to what I'm trying to do is try to help us to all look at our offerings of the more clearly are we offering oil line every day praise God neither are we just smiling are we rejoicing are we cried are we trying to give God or just our full love everyday oh we have to have oil line or you break the Word of God every see how important is to stay walk in the spirit and daily sacrifices and feasts of offerings and church services we need oil and wine amen the baptism with all the ghosts and the stimulation that comes behind it I don't know if you've at least once or twice every service some of the city lights we saw art I just give God glory as you you a booth or some like that because it feels like something rushed over beat maybe I didn't see in that like what is it it's God trying to strengthen the heart of man is God trying to make the heart happy for him and then it's God trying to show you his love church amen it's kind of trying to show me his love on the new you and I all those verses here you know from the concordance but um the sin offering and jealousy offering did not have oil and oil line of course we know because Christ was the sin offering right and the Holy Spirit had to lead him sometime you know by the Garden of Gethsemane in order for all this sin to put on him God couldn't put sin on the Holy Ghost they're two separate things right so the Holy Ghost had to leave Jesus at some point and Sid had to come upon him right that's like the sin offering sin offering could have no oil in life it just was a offering unto God remember oil was used in the burning of lamps praise God like the wise virgins how many want to be a life for Christ even as we said on Wednesday a star for Christ and on the moon either type each one has her own glory on it again you see and so we must have oil to burn brightly for Christ amen it's for used for medicinal purposes like in isaiah 1 verse 6 and we'll get to Luke 10 in just a moment like this too is also used for anointing the day but the Holy Ghost on a dead thing and that's a good thing right it's a good thing to put the Holy Ghost on some dead you'll come to life amen just like that dead branch of errands right it wasn't living you put that dead thing in the spirit of god what happened it starts producing fruit but actually Lord who left my life belated the holiest of holy death and I can bring forth more fruit if it looks dead if this area let me say like this if I've been proved if I've been cut by the word and I don't see you through that area and I feel like it's dead but Lord place it in your presence that another branch can grow out and you could have fruit for your glory nay I could come out of my life because I mean oh it hurts to be proved and got a lot of things to happen in trials and situations and the way people treat you and the way things will happen Oh God will allow them to happen to prune you praise God but that only means more fruits coming later on amen and just gotta wait for the right season how many times I've seen that as a pastor you know well Graham said I'm not gonna go there I don't know who passed that by god I love the Lord amen oil was one of the most valuable products in the country according to deuteronomy 32:39 she killed 16:13 it was a sign of gladness according to Psalms 92 10 and it's also when you were in sorrow you could have put oil on let's see it the opposite so when we're sorry don't get me wrong there's a godly sorrow at the balance that out remember 2nd Corinthians chapter 10 there's a godly sorrow which leads to repentance that could be a good thing but more than often the oil the Holy Ghost makes a person glad and makes them strong makes them joyful that's why God gives us the Holy Ghost I didn't have that before we can experience real joy we could experience real happiness so God give it to us so we can be a different race amen remember Christ was the firstborn among many brethren are you one of those many then he was the beginning of the new creation of God amen God's I'm going to start a new creation new Testament people that have high spirits sealed inside of them unto the day of redemption amen good happy milchester because our the flood of bulls and goats but now happens because God has a new race of people on there I'm glad to be one of those in that new race CNN the race that has audio and wide in the soul praise God now the Divya it's exactly ready that's why as we send some people's lives maybe are never accepted by God you've seen it people try to contact God try to give an offer and try to come to church for a while and they ultimately fall away because they're not accepted wife is they're not in the right condition they haven't brought online in other words they haven't died to themselves we've all seen just like a they offer the wrong thing said of offering their life as a sacrifice rooms up offering a sacrificial light they just try to give something else like money or time or church attendance or something like that or just make little sacrifices but the entire life has got to be given an unreal sacrifice happen today amen amen and God accepts that kind of sacrifice like I looked at mother in the face recently and he's told me well brother Jesse I do this I did this and he's claiming he's got the Holy Ghost I did have a heart to tell mother he wasn't one of my sheeps I didn't say anything about it but he looked at me said I believe I got the Holy Ghost and I still do this this this at least was some pretty awful things and I said sir I said the problem is you just haven't died out to those things because when you really die out those sins have no more pull apart amen I mean to get you to obey them you might be tempting the flesh but you're dead to them and they'll never rise again 89 is that right and Church the man started me for about five seconds and change the subject and what was it to me that's a vindication they know better they know they haven't prayed until they've got breaking through church and I don't care where it happens I don't care if it happens here or at your home or if you need to break through you got to pray until you die out and that God's will be done in your life I don't care where it happens it's nice to see it happen here but it don't have to it can happen anywhere amen and God just wants to see us broken remember that scripture where Jesus said either you will fall on the rock and be broken or the rock will fall on you remember that anybody remember that no okay let's let me look it up that's that's what's happened in church we've got to throw ourselves upon Christ and that's what you do when you die to yourself you throw yourself Allah I'm selling out lock stock and barrel Lord take all of me you throw yourself upon Christ and you're broken and then you can put the pieces back in handy but if not if we don't sacrifice ourselves and fully sell out then Christ is going to come and smash-ups is not like the image you never can answer amen right he has to come and smash that but we need to recognize they wanna throw myself on your mercy I'm throwing myself at the feet of Jesus and say hey and it helped break those chains and break those bonds and I'll make you a new creature in Christ Jesus amen let me find if anybody finds it first let me know I think it's broken I'm going to look at the New Testament yep Matthew 21 let's go Matthew 21 don't you love your dances this fella today I have a big fat huge concordance up here flipping Panda give me second church he did that there's numerous eyes I've heard in church amen let me look through this when we find that scripture he asks the brothers who looked on the good carden's Matthew 21:43 now look he's talking to the Israel I am going to take the kingdom away from you in other words you're going to reject the baptism all the ghosts I'm gonna give it to somebody else so this scripture ties him perfectly with the baptism of the Holy Ghost this is taken from the Jews and given to the Gentiles verse 43 therefore I say unto you the kingdom of God shall be taken from you what's the kingdom of God Jesus said it comes out with observation he says the kingdom of God is within you and given to a nation bringing forth the fruits thereof alright see you next verse verse 44 the sober timeline and whosoever shall fall on this stone shall be broken put on loose rubber shall fall it will grind him to powder look what'd he say I don't want Christ to fall on me and riding me up I want to freely give myself to Christ I'm gonna say little Jesse that's what I want to I wanted it broken on Christ absolutely one of the other remember I preached a sermon here's about if anybody remembers it beau might they might I call it a broken worship or broken individuals I thought something like that because either one you're going to be either have one of the other either your worship is broken at you're dead stiff and starchy and full of pride and lust or you're the one who's broken ain't a head you're broke you have no will of your own you just want the with a guy and then your will is broken Christ is broken your will and it's not what once anymore it's not what brother Adam once it brother item it's not what I want anymore my most broken Christ's can have his way in me and then a teammate amen praise God that's description I hope you enjoyed that by God's grace that's a man the kingdom of God that's a Holy Ghost baptism Scripture because the kingdom of God is the Holy Ghost all right I hope that's a help by God's grace now for why accordions Baba dictionary it starts off I say our Lord miraculously supplied wine at the marriage feasts is now what Jesus does he turns the water of the word into why amen and that's his first miracle and it took place at a wedding praise God right he takes the word and he makes it into wine and just stimulate you praise God amen because we're washed by the water of the word amen that's exactly right Christ always does that Christ always will supply he'll turn though every day service every day water they'll turn your every day Bible reading into why Amen to stimulate you they meant to let you know that it's wedding time amen other than its ladies eye and this is needed for the wedding reception I do thank you Jesus now in Bible days natural wine when it was drunk even by Jesus this says water was always mixed with it and it was a custom in the days of Christ the people indeed are everywhere very sober in hot climates that's why the why he was super watered down in the days of Jesus because if you're drinking a lot of alcohol and it's hot you're losing water real fast and you're going to die you're going to die of some type of a problem pretty soon in fact a drunken person is rarely seen the sin of drunkenness however must feet must have not been uncommon to olden times for its mentioned either metaphoric here literally more than seventy times in the Bible yet they would still do it because they were addicted to the effects of alcohol all right now it goes in to say the drink offering was present the daily sacrifice right and also the offering of the first ah there's a good one so see you even got to have a holy ghost to pay your tithes and offerings the right way okay right because there's a lot about racial people that pay them right but they're not paying it the right way they're paid it to the preacher rather than paying to God are you with me on that so you got even have the Holy Spirit mixed in your first fruit offerings see because it takes the Holy Spirit to do it it really does remember brother Mannis with ties and offerings are eternal he said eternal that means I never have an ending I mean God will remember those all the offerings that you gave back all the ties you getting back I'll keep a record of it that's exactly right now it says this line was used at the celebration of the Passover hi when the Lord's Supper was instituted the wine and unleavened bread then on the Paschal table were by our Lord set apart as memorials of his body and blood praise God amen now let's uh let me read a quote now I'll get a few more scriptures I'm just just going to try to preach an hour like I said I feel good but now I'm feeling okay by God's grace thank God for His mercy so let me go to the fourth seal now brother Graham preaches it in the third seal but just a short little section he spends more time reviewing it in the fourth seal the next night if you haven't listened that or read that recently now but man said but Satan was forbidden to touch the oil wine which was a little that was left but Graham said we touched him he said it might have sounded a little rude but is just exactly the truth he said let's renew review that now we left off on the power of the line what the oil represented the spirit he said and where to find the scriptures the oil and with oils always symbolizes the Holy Spirit he talks about the foolish virgins and so forth I'm going to skip ahead and said now oil symbolize always fair always connected and worship and wide symbolizes that is the power of stimulation by revelation and that's when something has been revealed it gives stimulation to the believer because it's presented by revelation it's something that God has said it's a mystery they can't understand it see but after a while God comes down and reveals it and then vindicates it like that amen so stimulation happens when you have a mystery in your life or a mystery about the Bible and God comes and answers your mystery amen he solves your mystery dissolves all your doubts now you ought to be stimulated by that amen God knows the desires of your heart amen praise the Lord I talks about Moses how God came in backed up what Moses said that's what I was using that God backs up what we say as the stimulation that he's actually speaking he gives a few more examples I want to just real quick here he said now the power of revelation brings stimulation to the believer for the power of natural wine is to stimulated it'll bring a person that's all slumped down to a stimulation well then now there is a power of Revelation the word give stimulation of joy to the believer stimulation of satisfaction the stimulation that is vindicated it's proven now I was a sinner and I saw numerous people when they were not drinking they were very shy individuals but once they would start drinking they were the life of the party you have to raise your hand I seen it numerous times some of the guys I would never say anything at school we go to the party and then they just start mouthing off at everybody I think what got into that guy well why I got in that guy alcohol guy to that guy and burn Ram said that's what it is for a Christian he said when you're all slumped over so if you see the illustration slumped over or depressed or discouraged the Holy Spirit comes as wide to make you straighten your shoulders and stand strong as a believer Amen if you weren't testified about God's Word now you are in amen that's what it's for you're the life of your job you're the life of your home not because it's not a party right it's a job but you're the life of the group because the Holy Spirit is in you amen and you're solving problems right you're thinking you're letting God's will be done oh my the will of God the revelation of God's Word is in your heart but all you think about is God your stimulated amen it's exactly right well Graham said no no Bible he said in the scripture it's called knew why they were drunk on new wide or spiritual wine he says sorry and then he says Jesus he quotes Jesus in John 6 it is the spirit that quickeneth the flesh profiteth nothing the words and I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life amen but remember the word itself is spirit it is spirit in Word form let me know that the Holy Spirit is this is a word and spirit form praise God this is the word right this is the word but the Holy Spirit is this word in action that's my brother madam said the Holy Ghost will only point you to the word I mean that's one of the people tell me they got the Holy Ghost and they move outside the word I say you're back Synod writer you're disobedient or you don't have what you claim to have because the only ghost only points you to the Word of God I know we have to prepend alien that you a backside to Haley and things like that I'm talking over all your overall life the seasons can I say that the seasons of your life you go through seasons we get you're still dedicated to God you're still evading the Word of God you're still a beating to what the word says the Holy Spirit is the word in spirit for me says that's right now it goes on he says it stimulates and it gives joy because it's God's Word now how many would be honest to say real justice that joy straight but it don't last as long as I should let honey be honest you don't raise your hand it happens to me I've told you before I'm so stimulated sometimes if I walk out of service and then something bad will happen the man now the child might say something or child will spill something I've got to be careful to keep that joy going right but we've all experienced it where we're joyful going out but by the time we get to the car something happened someone stepped on our spiritual toe or so obvious we just forgot see how easy this is sniffing it opposite in and out of this that's why we got to just keep drinking it praise God he does keep the word upon our heart amen he he keep the bottle of the word close Kos Amen you seen those guys that the parties that have they have to help us to have the beer cans attached to them or they got the belt well that's what we are with the Word of God that's a mockery but in other words we always have the Word of God ready to talk about and you don't know if you have to have it on your cell phonee up there you have to pack the Bible but when you're ready you can't wait to witness or you can't wait to sing a song then you're like one of those guys or one of those girls or whatever you are you just live on the Word of God and see you want to pack it that's how I'm going to be on a packet everywhere I've built so many times this week I was ready at my family's vacation to just talk about the Prophet I got like two or three opportunities so I said hey he's the Lord for that right here I'm just I'm just pumped primed and ready to go just ask me about it just ask me about it and they finally did I got to talk about a little bit by God's grace ah but see that's what we pray for that's what we live for we packed the Word of God that we might be a vessel to share to somebody else praise God my man who said see he says then then the slide brings joy beyond measure sometimes we went through that that brings such a joy to you get over flooded the last time I got over flooded and danced was after I preached that message in December Lloris my number because there was even his microphone was left in the sanctuary on the key to the door never a service key to the door in December I was so happy off of that I just started running in front of it I just I couldn't I was losing my energy so I just felt out on the pulpit so I'm training this altar I would pray to giving God glory I'm so over flooded I got to do something with that don't you enjoy the overflowing than I hate reading it might be tears for you it might be a screen for you I don't know what it is for you but that's what happens when you get so overflow with the line of Christ you got to express yourself in some way in the end a man he said you get over flooded and then we're going to gain the example of David saying my cup runneth over are you it runs over amen as I said on Wednesday Church I'm going to revisit that just for a moment if we go to church and we're getting nothing out of it we've got to check up on ourselves yes the preacher needs to check up on himself but if I'm preaching the word brother Graham said that that man is anointed of God if I'm preaching the word let me this is example I thought of if I preach acts 2:38 here this morning and you already know you got you know baptized the right way then the Holy Spirit in you ought to be able to say amen to that and then think of those who haven't been baptized in acts through 2:38 and your eternal life living for somebody else ought to pull upon that word so God deal with that individual deal with that fight of your own so they'll get baptized that's if you got eternal life how many how many guys are alive that's what should happen at the preaching of the word right here's my man said if the Apostles had any treaty what was it acts 2:38 write the book of James the New Testament was even written till 80/60 so they preached from 33 AD to 6080 without one written word they just preached by the Holy Spirit I'm entitled ABC and they couldn't say acts 2:38 as it wasn't written yet they didn't say Peter said at the Creed of the Apostles the eternal prescription repent be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus coming hey and as I gave the example of Wednesday I don't care if you have steak every Friday night or pizza every Thursday night if you're hungry you can't wait to eat it and the church said Amen if you're thirsty you don't care if it's water well you might or milk or Gatorade when you're really thirsty you'll take whatever is calling that you don't take anything and that's why we got to check ourselves when we come to the house of God praise the Lord hey man it's a feeding time it's supper and it proves that people aren't pulling on the Word of God if the words wrong that's my fault but if the words right then you're to spend too much time feeding on other things and you're not hungry right that's nothing but the truth amen praise the Lord I'm Cameron's acts 2:38 or what okay what it is we're revelations then seven how can we not be hungry and excited about the Word of God when there's people that need that might need that word on it we can all say that search we can all say this by God's honesty we've all thought people have had the Holy Ghost and all they don't need acts 2:38 and they fell away into sin and approve they never even repented in the beginning and we wanted to run to the Holy Spirit keep preaching on it why delicious Ricky preached on church attendance and worship and come in too early to pray why is the Holy Spirit what is it why does God like the pastor to keep preaching on those thickness you see that because there's actual real needs there and none of us can know all we can do is obey the Word of God and make our calling an election Shin and that's why we don't shut up that's why don't push away the broccoli and pizza in front Friday night Tuesday pizza not at all that's why I get excited every time for pizza 9 mana right or so they go to Jamie go I decide I'd sue she every Sunday but every Sunday I get excited for more sushi and why because I'm hungry for it I developed a taste for you and I want to develop a taste for the light of God amen the oil Holy Spirit amen see we can't let it get old well if you let a mac and cheese get old and hungry for mac and cheese if you let mashed potatoes get old your exact on adventure doc can you hungry your mashed potatoes are served so see we have to live for others praise God we have to have to live for others and learn to pull upon the Word of God and that's why we share with the churches well I want the church to learn my dad said if we can't learn he said we're mules I don't want to be a mule Church I don't want to wait till my last breath to kick somebody up dead before I go God takes him out there I guess that's what I'm you will do he said oh wait so it's dying day to kick the farmer and back he said because you can't teach him anything he just wants to get upset with people's I want to be a thoroughbred I want to be someone that's got papers the Bible papers I know where I come from I know where I'm going I know what I am and you can teach me something I'll be obedient David and then I responded to God's leadership and I'll be able to learn something and I'll be able to share with somebody else that's my that's my desire for the church Lord winning tonight I want to do a little bit more that just no slower can we learn to come to church early and pray can we learn to keep pulling on the word even if it's something we heard already because I know any of you that push away something you've already eaten already well I already had broccoli last year I'm not gonna have any problem well I really like why they were like hamburgers but I already had a hamburger give me something new what kind of what kind of pressure would be on the on the cook you kind of create something brand new every single meal bread and don't use anything old use everything brand new what kind of pressure would use like that sisters I don't think my wife would like that I already had this last year don't bring we ate this last week we have potatoes last week I never want another potato don't throw that to me god help us to have the right attitude I say fun to that help us to have the right attitude because that's the only way the Holy Ghost is by holding and create the atmosphere upon them upon the Word of God no matter what's being preached the program said if it's the truth to agree with it Damon say Amen to it amen brother amen but may have said oh there's a lot of fanaticism people carrying on and we don't have a lot of that here which is a good thing you don't want fanaticism you want the reality and I just listened to what your style Elijah from 1959's listen that yesterday and brother Graham goes to the other side of emotion he said some of the greatest things are the most quiet things he talked about the planets rotating do you know the earth spins at over 100,000 miles problem program said did you ever hear it did ever hear the moon spin no a hundred thousand miles per hour not sure that's it's moving around the earth I'm sorry the earth itself spins at 6,000 he was 6,000 miles per hours 600 something something like that I've got my numbers mixed up but it has two speeds you know around the Sun and it also does own rotation I think it's 600 miles per hour spinning the earth is spinning itself around its axis and so see we got to do the mail don't look for a motion to start but he said wait till God reveals something he said then let your such a cup overflow that and his mocha I said watch he said watch how quiet it gets in the discernment line he said that's what should happen and then God would reveal something he said that it's time to rejoice at umass hallelujah I hope that help that's understood by God's grace but Ram said Agra this before I want to read again I've seen people in the day when as long as the music is playing everybody was jumping in screaming when the music stopped has stopped well that's still alright as far as I'm concerned you see as long as people lives right last year I went to a church with Steve al Jim you've ever seen Alexander he took me the single guy who's real skinny you know kind of tends to be homeless remember him he said I want to take you to this Apostolic Church so what happens on church that's exactly what it was they took turns running around the church during song service they got their half hour early and all the preachers walked up and forth like this praying out loud you know tapping people on the shoulders all the preachers rub on the go like this and all the people out there you know waving their hands for half an hour before service and then during the songs they take turns running Simon's mouth comes here right now got sprinting around the church one boy we go then another then when the boys got done the girls would go over that but as soon as the music stopped - it's a seat that might mean you're just kind of putting it on praise God now look what he says next but when you start bringing that word that's the thing that actually brings light that brings the joy of stimulation of new wine and that's what it was on Pentecost was the word vindicated amen that's what I wanted to see church that's not don't want to see that here we see the special meetings you see it sometimes here but don't try to see more of it as a pass that's my greatest desire to see Mormon that the word actually brings more emotion than even the Psalms although that's good it's good it's good to worship during the song but the word that actually brings like life-changing revelation will actually bring the most noise and the most rejoicing and Oh stimulation just the preaching of the word Amen alright I see this Amen I 2 times I preach I had to stop preaching because of all the work she's going on I really appreciate that I was there for the cans I can other one wasn't going on yeah other ones though I just could never saw that I was preached on Elijah I was preached on Elijah how he went up to heaven a garment fell down and he said where's the god of Elijah not saying where's the god of william branham and the people were just really and they just kept clapping and shouting standing up a praising God sighs let's quit I can't preach anymore I already preached about omens that's why but see that's the atmosphere I'm not saying every service has to be like that I'm just saying that's what brings life is the word the Word of God revealed to you and I that should bring us more stimulation anything else but if you get overflowed during the song service and be like me run across here all flat down on the altar just worship the Lord do whatever you do for the kingdom of God that's right now the last examples are David he said David cup runneth over and he said when David danced around the ark he said that was his cup overflowing he said anyone was actually the right example because it was he was dancing because the word was returning the word was being restored to its rightful position and that's what happened to us the work it to the rightful position we'll have to rejoice amen I've had so many Oh since my children I've been baptized three my own children you can believe I was spiritually praying and crying and rejoice it what that happened I was a dancer but I was crying to weep and embrace it God when the word comes to your house you save into that when the word comes back to its position in your life you'll give God glory amen what's going to hold it back you can't get old your emotion because that happens with mine and all amen it's stimulate you praise God okay let me try to move on here and I just want to say this as I preach this I don't forget to say this brother Brandon you know when you went behind the curtain time he said they said they're going to judge for administering what he says I preach football preached where Paul baptized in Jesus Christ's name i baptize he said where Paul preached the Holy Ghost I Priscilla lead let me say for me by God's grace I appreciate to go to the same way brother Brendan amen why didn't I we are the most impressive preachers preach the that the water baptism the same when I was good that's a wonderful start but we want to preach the Holy Ghost baptism the same way as well even its wine and oil you first receive the oil and that brings stimulation of wine to your life say hey it's exactly right I just want to lay that in there so important we've got to preach it the exact same way to praise God let me do a two more let me do I got three more here I've already gone two hours so I don't to go to much longer and my watch the ropes I have a watch let me set the timer here not even here old and the thing broke already I know what you enjoy people are saying I know what you say in the UH mid 15 minutes here by God's grace let's go and look back to Luke five with a five owner reprogram set out this Luke chapter 5 to 5 read this earlier about the new wine and bottles now whether I preach this thought I'm going to read in Lima Ohio praise Lord which is where I started serving the Lord in the message none message now Jesus says verse 37 no man putteth new wine into old bottles else the new wine will burst the bottles and be spilled and the bottles will perish and new but new ye must be put into new bottles and both are preserved no man also having drunk old wines straightway desired new for he saith the oldest better oh my what a tight there let me read rip up Graham said here he said this great revival we're speaking of us has to come from heaven it can't come from man it wasn't boredom and it was bored of God has to come from God you can't put this revival an old theology and mix it up jesus said that st. Luke you can't put new wine in old bottles I often wonder why that statement was made while you can't put new wine in old bottles I come to find out he said we use a glass jug a bottle why couldn't I put a new line of those things but I found out back in the days when Jesus was speaking up the bottles wasn't made of glass they didn't have the glassblowers in those days they was made out of animal skin and the animals could have been tannin soda or tied up and they put the new wine the liquids in a skin bottle and after that the bottle becomes so old no why did or anything it dried out the animal oil of the skin left and then it got hard and stiff so that is that never ever to remember that by God's grace their bottles were actually animal skins so you couldn't put new wine that had potential to grow in a bold skin praise the Lord a man a man who said I see what Jesus meant if you put new wine unfermented wine into a bottle like that and the new wine at life in it it went to working and fermenting it would burst the bottle that's the way you take the baptism of the Holy Ghost and put it in an old dry formal cowhide it'll blow up as sure as the world you just can't have it like that you try to take the back to the Holy Ghost with the old experience of something long drawn-out church experience it'll blow up sure is the world but new wine said Jesus goes in new bottles the new bottles has still the animal oil in the skins and it's flexible that's the way God's church must be for animal flexible amen now for us what does that mean we got to be flexible to bend a little bit to bend our actions a little bit every see what I'm talking about if you want revival we got to change our behavior man we can't do the same thing over and over and over again how many want to be able to bend to the Holy Spirit that means change your position to something different right if you want revival you've got to be flexible you got to be able to say okay why don't do this very often but I'm gonna try this probably God's leading me to do this amen that's right how do I be flexible og man praise not and we got to be willing to do things we normally don't do go BAM so you know you can put the new one which represents the word put the new one in a whole bottle and you'll read the word and it says Jesus Christ the same yesterday today and forever the old bottle will go poof he says blows up I don't believe it the baptism Holy Ghost is just as real today that roseboom I don't believe it and what do you do you spoil both bottles and wine a church we don't have to say nonsense to deny the work of the Holy Spirit we just have to sit still and not act upon the Word of God how many understand that understand that but the bantam said a preacher can preach all night until he's sore the lungs but until the people make a move it won't do anything he said you can pour a gallon of oil on them all night the people have to move another in other words people have to follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit includes me exudes all of us that makes sense no one ever this church I've never seen anyone say no I don't want the Holy Ghost they never said that oh no I don't believe in I don't believe it's okay to show I've never seen anybody do that well I don't believe in speaking in tongues I've never seen anybody do that but people with their actions and their attitudes if they don't like the worship they that they're actually doing that even though they're not saying it to understand that in Trinidad the first time ago or time I preached there I had preached loud I preached excited and I preached up the Holy Ghost and the pastor's wife went home and was the next one Saturday morning and she said she was cleaning the room the Holy Spirit came down her and said her name every under name was and she said don't make fun of that preacher he's preaching my word and so she came to me after the service the next day and repented because she was making fun of in her mind she was looking down upon my emotion in my zeal for Christ and she apologized in front of the pastor she thought we were having supper after the service and she apologized afterwards so that's one time I know God vindicated it's okay for me to get free to spear amen it's okay to show emotion right but she was sitting there the whole time and she wasn't saying oh you're just a nonsense message preacher you know she wasn't saying that she was just in there like everybody else but see God knows the reigns of our mission oh god I search in your heart as a man my man said your thoughts right now louder in heaven your actions are right now I thought what should we be thinking all things are possible Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I believe in the Word of God I believe the Holy Ghost as wine and oil I believe it's for somebody today and then see we think well I've got it I see you're not living with eternal life but this isn't for me this isn't you're not living for others right and you're saying I'm not hungry we don't want to want more of God who doesn't one nickname a drink you like I like kombucha who wouldn't want enough fresh mason kombucha or kefir who would I'm on that I know Lord likes dr. pepper not right now horse who doesn't like enough fresh drink of dr. pepper who doesn't like a fresh drink of the Holy Ghost in the head who doesn't like that who doesn't like a fresh meal from God a fresh Word of God but we got to come hungry to the house of God amen not blow up see people can blow up and I don't I might not see it on their faces but by their actions they blow up it shows that got old you said formal starchy sniff experience we got to be flexible and say on I love you Jesus I'll do whatever you say man man in other words I'm willing to get more of myself to you I'm willing to sacrifice more Lorenzo and Dan better go Scott had 120 brand-new Pentecostal bottles setting with their necks up don't you love that a putter 20 brand-new Pentecostal bottles freshly skinned can I say like that freshly skinned with all the oil so you can pour wine in there may God help us to be like that a man that was I'd be old skidded old message believers that don't want to move to the Holy Spirit we want to see more of God we want to see gifts we want to see interpretations we want to see revelations we want to see all God has for you and whatever he has you wanted amen but we can't be old dead skins and expect to grow with the Holy Spirit no you got to be flexible and moving already spirit always fear cause the more sacrifice you got to give more sacrifice that's exactly right and you got to have your neck up my grandson and their bottles and next up in other words fill my cup Lord I'm lifting up or film I want more of you not well I'm a message believer this isn't for me I've been a message on these years that's the wrong attitude that's a a worldly because that's a worldly stuff attitude I don't know what's a stuffed buffet attitude I know how to say that you're just so full with the world you have nothing no hunger for God what you been looking at what's been doing on your phone what you've been doing in your free time what do we do it we must be doing things for the kingdom of God amen must be feeding on the Word of God and let me go this time five agree just in about four years I want to bring it out the thought Katie this morning in Esther chapter five I'm sorry Esther chapter two remember this type Vashti was the queen you missed - what what is her name meanie name I remember means beautiful Vashti was a beautiful woman and say like this she was a beautiful church and she must have been merged and before she got married because she could be queen that sound familiar foolish virgin right she was beautiful church in the boost version is a beautiful church it is because their version to the where they're not having intercourse with the world right and having daily interactions are not with the homosexuals all things things like that they're they're pure to the word and the Bible said that the king called for Vashti to come show herself before and the king is all full of stimulation I want to know my church to be seen all of these these leaders to see the real church in action and she said no I'm having my party I'm having my wine party with the churches I'm not coming this to your party see that she denied the word yet she's having her own life part that's what about us in a wine banquet in other words she was being stimulated with anointing but when it come down to obeying the word look she couldn't obey the word the presence of the king are you with me she went away the word in the presence of the king she wouldn't go further with God to obey the Word of God Church me to go further with nothing ma'am we need to keep seeking after God don't stop seeking after God once you get the message to get baptized right away keep seeking out your God a man she said I'm going this far King and I'm not going any further that's a denominational spirit that's why she has to be purged during the tribulation because she's mixed with the denominations and she won't go further into the true Tolman of the word that's right she was having her own banquet see she like she wanted to be anointed to be recognized by the churches my desirable aim is not to see how other churches think we're a great Church my desire to be anointed so the king will love me so I can serve the King better with me so I'm hoping the king that's how I want to be anointed not to please other churches not to impress you know other churches around this area but so that we can please the King and do it the King say that's exactly right what's Esther me star everybody's a night stars amen she was beautiful but Esther was a saw ha ha ha I know there goes for simulations they've had a revelation she was the star of God so what an Esther do she obeyed everything heavy I said only what he said and that pleased the king she became queen remember that and then she had at the time of the death at the time of persecution she had two banquets the first one was the banquet of wine remember that Esther chapter 5 she had a wine banquet in other words she knew what the king light the King liked to drink wine praise the Lord and she could prepare it and the king loved this when the King say the king said Oh Esther I give half half the kingdom and she said what do you want he said give me one more party let's have one more banquet last you tomorrow night so one banquet party was enough she needed the second annoyed day she needed a double anointing are with me church a former rain and a ladder draining programs that the rapture the church will be what the refilling of the Holy Ghost one banquet one parties on a note we need another praise God amen ah see that she just wanted to impress the churches with her anointing but Esther knew the King called her and she knew she was accepted that she knew it the King like if God is going to hear my prayer I'm going to touch God's heart I've got to prepare something he loves and that involves line that involves stimulation the King loves stimulation amen that's exactly right remember this this type ties in exactly with magic 22 when the King if I wasn't tell them which I've been in Matthew 22 for behold I prepared my dinner my oxen and my fatlings are killed and all things are ready come into the marriage to see it's the same thing both both stories have a king who's having a feast having a supper right and only the ones that come are the ones who are the true bride right one of them was taken out right the man without the garden was taking off some was Haman taken out crazy God will fan the banquet opened up half blind with the king but both were taken out and only the true bride was left you can say unto that only the true bride will stay at the wine the wine banquet right that's exactly right and that ties in with our prophecy for our day Joel - 23 to 26 we'll have plenty of wheat and plenty of wine oils remember that I don't go along I think I'm trying to run me off forgive me let me try to close I hope that is all that's still your vision church that's all mission it thus saith the Lord the bride has had plenty of wine and plenty of oil amen and if we're honest let's look at our church and say God help us have more wine than any man and who brought you who brought the wife who got the oil the Old Testament to the house of God it was the people and that it could smiie all of us was have a hidden prayer life with Christ and we must bring the anointing this church hey Manny let's say to our feet I better cook I'm going to none now if you're not more together the Holy Ghost that's alright because the Holy Ghost is here to help people who need that in years past I've always just laid hands I've just laid here but I found maybe that's not the way to do it I found by the brand of Nod there are times do that going in a row we want to listen let your brother brand I'll share my time we're looking for the brand he'll let the people just lay there and pray there's times you praise and receive the Holy Ghost lays hands with us other times like an Albuquerque where he just lets them pray until somebody gets a breakthrough so I want to offer that today and also offer another time the people want the Holy Ghost it's here what spirit is guiding me not preach anything off the word today and I'm free to Antichrist doctrine are there they say oh you don't need the wine and oil oh you got it if you're just justified no you don't you got to go justification sanctification that's just with all to go in we've seen all people that all tried to put walk through the motions of being baptized but never really repenting and never really getting the wine annoying man you've all seen that oh I know I do I know so much Niger is really hungered and thirsted for the baptism all he goes I don't know I want to offer it and as I close I want to use Luke 10 the story of the Good Samaritan remember brother Simon last year preached the healing prescription on Wednesday night remember that that was a masterpiece the healing prescription what was Jesus is healing prescription as the Good Samaritan pouring oil and wine I remember that when we're sick and wounded and broken what is Christ gonna pour in he's a foreigner oil he's going to port in line amen and then for the RAM said he takes you to the end which is he says a local church he said in the pastor Jesus will give the pastor two pens to take care of you he's in that pastor will need you the rest of the way I hope we know how closely connected the rapture is with the fivefold ministry in the local church hope you know that because Jesus takes him to a local church we have to have a local church to them we have to stay in our post of duty but what we want is we want to get the Baptist all he goes they then find our position the church not just come to church and try to find a position and then fall out of church but stay in the church the man should stay to the rapture or stay tuned you go to meet the Lord by the grave last Bodhi says he says if you're really determined to stay on the road with this leader the Holy Spirit stay right with the word and if you stay with the spirit we'll keep you in the word that's right it'll take you right along the line the path of the word and don't be afraid it won't hurt nothing it'll just help you if you are hurt it will heal all the hurts the Holy Spirit will so if you're not born again the Holy Ghost is here for you today if you think you're born again believe you're born again praise God but if you're hurt and the Holy Ghost is here for that too but that's the Holy Ghost will never hurt you it will heal let's just our head for a moment remorse if you come here let's just play that spirit living God all fresh I don't know if anyone's seeking the Holy Ghost but all's I know is I felt like God changed my message this morning to preach this and it may be building I know that as well I understand that but I want to preach what brother Adam preached I want to preach what Paul preached the Holy Ghost is oil and wine it is a baptism and then the stimulation that comes from the revelation of the word of God and it brings joy overflooded gives you a life of service programs that held them so they can even be slaughtered and martyred and it never left him he said the effects of the holy spirit never left them the rest of their lives I can say amen to that the effects of what got into me when I came the message has never left me amen I've never went back out to the world I've never back slid like that it's never left me because it's a seal to the day of my rejection it's the healing prescription then widen oil that's that word prayer and I will see if anyone wants have any prayer for this and if we don't have anybody then we're just going to pray for the whole church I just want you to join me in prayer that's just by it how many father we love you today [Music] moorpark 16 I think of my mind of the baptism of the Holy Ghost series we've gone through thus saith the Lord and the Holy Ghost [Music] the real tongues of the Holy Ghost the Old Testament or shadowing of the Holy Ghost the Upper Room or we going through all this the Lord here I wasn't even planning Lord but this morning I felt like this is what you had me to do Lord I've just tried to be obedient I just tried to follow this leading I felt let it do it father if there's anybody hungry you they feel like they've never been bored again I'm afraid they'll come and seek you Lord God I crave somebody believes they've had the born-again but they're hurt someone's hurt them may you brain a fresh anointing or got a fresh drink Lord God I would stimulate them to go approach that person that's hurt them to talk to them about it and don't let it fester and become a root of bitterness for your profits that will kill the Holy Spirit in their life father we just want to be reverent Lord God I know this is a beautiful subject
