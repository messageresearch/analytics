God's children pise God and so uh we are happy uh to be here this morning by God's grace and so uh appreciate uh your pastor your precious Pastor yes and uh appreciate brother Jesse I uh I admire him not only as a man of God but as a child of God uh I believe he's uh you know there's many preachers but there's very few that live the life is that right so we don't want to just preach behind the pool pit we want our life to preach yes on Mondays and Tuesdays Thursday afternoon Saturday morning and so so that's one thing that I do appreciate about brother Jesse it's always as Daniel of old has an excellent spirit so appreciate him and his family sister Wendy God bless you Sister appreciate the new faces and so uh God bless you and so if we can maybe we'll just get right into the word of God God we want to send greetings from back home precious Pastor brother great and then uh my family couldn't make it uh today so I'm riding solo so uh appreciate uh them and sorry it's been so long since we have been here so uh appreciate brother Jesse's longsuffering [Laughter] praise the Lord we're going to um uh read out of Revelations chapter 4 uh verse one very familiar scripture uh this is uh obviously after uh the seven Church ages uh and we see here as brother Brandon will tell us I'd like to read a quote after this this is John in a pre figure a type of our shadow of the Rapture says after this I looked and behold the door was open in heaven and the first voice which I heard was as it were of a trump talking with me which said come up hither and I will show thee things which must be Hereafter Amen brother Ram says Revelations chapter 4 he says John being taken up immediately after the church age he was the type of the Church immediately after the church ages is over this lady will see a church age then comes the Rapture the church goes up like John did into the presence of God Amen and so this morning by the help of God I'd like to speak to you uh on just a uh for sake of a title a study on the Books of John amen let's just bow our heads in order of prayer Heavenly Father father Lord we love you today and thankful to be called your children Lord we just want to gather around your word ask Lord that you would be welcome in this place Lord I I know that your children have made you welcome in their worship and so Lord I I want you to be welcome behind this PO that you would just anoint us Lord with your great Holy Spirit that we could yield Our Lives to you and that you could be glorified this morning Lord we commit all that we are into your hands we love you we praise you we ask all these things to be so the name that's above every name our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ amen amen God bless you like and so um study on the Books of John and uh so if uh John would be a type of the Bride then he would be an expression of the Bride throughout the scriptures we' be safe to say that yes and so uh we know that the Bible itself is a love letter to the Bride of Jesus Christ is that right yes amen but but if maybe I could say if um if John wrote particular books or letters then wouldn't those be an expression of the bride of Christ yes amen and and and so what I did is uh I I kind of comb through John first John 2 John third John and Revelations to compile um some things that was uh brought out that was special for us in our age amen and it's it's actually pretty phenomenal uh and so looking at we're going to mainly focus on the Book of John John uh but but then we may go to you know the the other letters but just so that you understand if John is a type of the Bride then uh then he ought to be different than all the other gospels is that right and so uh which is true uh and so if you look at Matthew Mark and Luke they are referred as the synoptic gospels uh they have a common Viewpoint and and and it's a it's a general theme through Matthew Mark and Luke but John differ very significantly uh actually so much so that uh it's it's it's said that there's only 8% of the Book of John in the other three gospels and so they referred to Matthew Mark and Luke as the synoptic gospels because they share a common viewpoint but John is different in and all of and in the all of gospels so much so that the early Christian Movement thought that it was a heretic and they wanted to take the Book of John out amen but but but it has to be that way because remember John is the eagle is that right uh if we if we would look at Revelations chapter 4 brother bam talks about this about the four living creatures the zoom he said the the first beast in Revelations 4:7 the first Beast was like a lion the second beast like a calf the third Beast had the face of a man the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle amen is that right amen uh very important everyone to to be mindful of this uh that living that fourth living creature which was an eagle God gave it an adjective it wasn't a eagle in the valley it wasn't an eagle setting on a forch or on a branch but it was a flying eagle it was an eagle in action and and so it's very important for us to realize that and so uh these these these four living uh creatures that last one being an eagle was actually John and and if we go back to the Old Testament uh Tabernacle when the 12 tribes of Israel would be around that uh Tabernacle and that Mercy Seat uh you would have them in tribal order but there was actually an inner circle to that tribal order and it was an inner circle of Dan was to the north uh to the West Was Ephraim to the South was Ruben and to the east was Judah now remember what what Moses when God took him up to heaven what Moses saw in heaven Moses pattered on Earth and so then being the eagle he would wave to the North that that that banner and it would be an eagle can you say Amen so so when Dan would be on the North side there would be an eagle that would be flying to the north because that was a representation of Revelation 4 those four living creatures can we say Amen to that all right y'all with me and so when we see John John or when we see Dan Dan uh uh was actually to the north but but what this what brother Bram takes this as as as he brings it to the New Testament brother brandham says it was Matthew Mark Luke and John guarding the book of Acts can we say Amen to that everybody with me so far and so and so the the Dan the tribe of Dan would be the eagle and so uh uh a Dan to the north John he was that eagle anointing but now want no no wonder no wonder that that whenever they would refer to John throughout the early Christian Movement they would not be able to understand John because John was not an Earthly creature John was a Heavenly creature because he was the eagle amen yes so you had you had Matthew which was the lion he was an Earthly creature right remember uh uh this was uh the the when brother Bon refers to the Beast he's talking about a Powers right and so there was three Earthly powers that was that was there to combat brother benam as he tells us those four living creatures was to combat that Antichrist spirit that that white horse rider that Antichrist Spirit running through the ages is that right and so and so when when that when that white horse rid was loose God sent a lion anointing to combat that Antichrist Spirit but now watch in the last in the last Beast that was a Heavenly creature the first three were Earthly but the last four was Heaven the last the very last one was Heavenly so so really in essence the reason why they couldn't understand John is because it wasn't for their age they they were living under a sealed book it was it was a it was not a Heavenly anointing being released to them amen yes but in this last age this last anointing would be a Heavenly anointing a flying eagle that we would not have to live in the Molly grubs but we would have the Power released to us by the baptism of the Holy Spirit to soar in the heavenlies to Fly Above the storms of lady oia God gave us the ability listen remember that black horse rider it was still an Earthly power that he that that that horse was an Earthly power and it's no match for a flying eagle because we are called and anointed to SAR in the heavenli praise the Lord yes amen are y'all with me so so so John being that eagle he he was he was uh he he should be special to us yes right Glory so when we see John we ought to see ourselves amen right yes now let's let's um I've got this is about a prob about a five-part series I'm trying to shrink down into two so bear with me we won we will just hit the highlights of it amen what I what I'd like to do is take you to Israel but then I want to take you to the seven Church ages highlighted there in red with me now watch when you go to the seven Church ages Ephesus Sam pram Saar Sardis Philadelphia lady oia watch how a pat remember when John caught the revelation of the Book of Revelations he was on the aisle of patmas is that right yes so think about this even geographically John had to come out of her my people to catch the Revelation amen amen praise God Amen yes so so if John had to come out of cuz remember he was the Ephesian Pastor yeah right right shouldn't we have to come out of H my people if we want to catch the Revelation yes amen amen praise the Lord is that shows how perfect God's gospel is amen so so even geographically God would be expressing something to us because remember the aisle of patness was not a pleasant place right but God sometime puts us on an aisle of P to get us to stop looking around and start waiting for the vision remember brother bam tells us that those visions that John received they covered a two-year period now so when you sit down and you read the book of Revelations you can read it in an afternoon but John didn't receive it in an afternoon he received it over at two years span before he could catch the full revelation of the book of ref rations and so one minute he would catch a vision the next minute he'd see a scorpion yes yes it's kind of like what like we do we tat a revelation from God and then we deal with the devil praise the Lord friends don't don't think it strange concerning the fiery trials that that are there around you it's for a p amen amen and John brother bam tells us that John remember after he turned from Almas only thing he could say was little children love one another am amen see sometimes it takes an AIS of patmas before we can catch the true love of God he found there was something real and that was was this disciple that wanted to call fire down on the city and burn them up and they wouldn't give enough to eat John the bride yes but yet the bride can still get carnal remember he wanted to be like a li C fire down from heaven we ain't called to be like brother brandom and P eagle belck and a cowboy haty we called the P the Holy Spirit yes amen prise the Lord and so John this is so beautiful if you wanna I know I got PowerPoint but if you just uh keep the Book of John open yes sir uh and remember we we probably won't hit go through all of it but what I want this to do by the help of God is from now on when you read John you ought to read it differently yes because as we go through these scriptures Parables and stories everything that I show you in John is only in John amen so be mindful of that yes so if if John being the eagle and Matthew Mark and Luke do not put it in their three and John is only putting it in his wouldn't it be special for us yes amen yes yes would that not be a fair statement to make yes sir yes sir and and and and amazingly everything remember only thing I extract from John is when it's solely in John so if there's a story that's in Matthew Mark and Luke I leave it out but it's only those things that I found in John all right you with meise God God and you'll see it it it'll it'll it'll it'll testify to this message line by line by line by line matter of fact you give me the first chapter of John and I can preach to you this entire message that's right right yes yes shows how perfect it is Friends yes sir and so and so brother brand ain't shooting from the hip when he says these things remember he's hitting the highlights and he says Ministry is to dig down deep yes sir is that right so I read you one scripture and one quote and now we're gonna take this by the help of God by the Holy Spirit and I pray that he would loose it for us and we'd be able to see God's grace amen now remember John if you look at John he is he is that eagle so when he starts his book he doesn't start at the birth of Jesus nor does he start at the ministry of the Prophet for that day amen but he goes back to in the beginning was the word amen yes Hallelujah because remember he's he's Eagle anointed and so he wouldn't just start at the birth of Christ he would go back to the beginning of the creation of God you just you can't make this stuff up friends in the beginning was the word and the Word was with God and the Word was God and the Word was made flesh and dwelt among us and we beheld his glory the glory as that the only begotten of the father full of grace and truth now one thing that you'll catch in John John is constantly catching Jesus saying these things that he come from God and he goes back to God that he proceedeth and he come forth from God in 8:42 in John 133 that he come from God and went to God in John 15:26 the spirit of Truth would testify which proceedeth from the father and shall testify of me what John is telling us is what the prophet of God gave us in great description that whenever God he would say let's just stand across the bister of time and he sees that when God said let there be in that little L go appeared he said it was like a a son playing before father that's what Jesus is saying when he said I proceed if it come from God that was the lust right and John catches these things I just gave you three just so you can see there's there's many more in John but uh which is so beautiful because John is the eagle and so he's going to catch details that Luke The Physician cannot because Luke is a man he's a physician yes right Mark is is an ox he's sacrificial Matthew is a lion right and that's the anointing that they worked under but John worked under the prophetic e anointing and so he's going to look things a lot deeper than just superficial now one thing beautiful John separates in the very first chapter he he he he realizes that the prophet of God was not God Amen but he realizes that the prophet of that hour came from God so so he has the ability to separate separate the the profit from from God Amen just like this bride does in this last day right he says there was a man sent from God whose name was John amen I mean came from God yes how about the other twoth thirds of you where' you come from how many many came from God he come from God and we're going back to God don't just leave it at Jesus don't just leave it at and John and brother Brandon friends you got to see yourself here right and the same came for a witness to Bear witness of that light that all men through him might believe watch he was not that light but he was sent to Bear witness of that light amen amen now John the disciple is differentiating the prophit of the hour from the word of God made flesh yes yes right now also John gives lots of description on the prophet of the age which it have to be right now something else that that you will see um is John now this is something that you'll have to read all the gospel to catch but John never alludes to himself he's always Peter and the and the other disciple that ran to the tomb or the disciple whom Jesus loved or the disciple who landed on the breast of Jesus and so John here right here in John 135 again the next day stood stood after John stood and two of his disciples now if you read this whole story he names one Andrew but he doesn't name the other now this is just me I don't have a quote for this so you can set it leave it right beside you on the Pew that's fine uh but but but to me you you see uh John right here if you read the whole story now watch and looking Upon Jesus as he walked he said Behold the Lamb of God now the prophet of this day introduced the manifested word of God and watch the two disciples followed and heard him speak and they followed Jesus so now you see the the the the the disciples making a turning a corner and transitioning as brother bham tells us in what is the attraction on the mount the prophet turn behold there comes the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world now what's the attraction it changed from the prophet to his prophecy and so we see when John introduced the Messiah now it changed from the prophet of that hour to what the prophet said the same way friends we are today we are holding to our Prophet the messenger but we're not holding to him so much that we're not beholding who he's pointing to Hallelujah now watch in John 3:24 we're going to bounce around just a little bit now he gives details about John being cast into prison then there arose a question between some of the John's disciples and the Jews about purifying and they came unto John and said unto him Rabbi he that was with the Beyond Jordan to whom thou bear witness behold the same baptizes and all men come to him John answered and said a man can receive nothing except to be given him from Heaven amen ye yourselves bear witness bear me witness that I said I am not the Christ but that I am sent before him he that hath the bride is the bridegroom but the friend of the bridegroom now John the disciple is catching John the Baptist position that he being the prophet is the friend of the bridegroom he catches the Jewish custom of that friend of the bridegroom that would be go before the bridegroom and would announce introduce the bridegroom to the bride after all those Jewish ceremonies for thousands of years John the disciple catches it and go this is him he's the friend of the bridegroom he's looking at it going this this is eler introducing us to is right now watch remember you only find this in John and which standeth and hearth and rejoices greatly because the bridegroom's voice this is my joy therefore is fulfilled he must increase but I must decrease so what is John telling us John is trying to identify to us that the prophet cannot be exalted above Christ that's what brother brenham's uh purpose was was just to introduce us to our Isaac and John is so perfectly catching it and pulling all this in yes Glory now watch if you you go to St John 5 Jesus he picks up what Jesus says about John Jesus he was a burning and Shining Light John the Baptist and you were willing for a season to rejoice in his life they were willing for a season to rejoice in the light of the prophet of the hour but it was just a season amen Hello friends yes is this not what's being fulfilled right now in our day they were willing for season to rejoice in this end time message I I don't want to just rejoice in this message for a season I want to for all eternity because the message is a person but search the scriptures for in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me do not think think that I will accuse you to the father there is one that accuses you even Moses in whom you trust watch what Jesus is doing Jesus they're they're trying to hold to this letter the dead letter but they're missing the manifested word right Jesus himself he says for had you believed Moses you would have believed me for he wrote Of Me amen see see how see how John is picking up on these things yes yes and he's picking up on these things because of of us because the same the the remember remember the the the same thing that happened at the first coming is going to happen at the second yes yes is that right yes and so all these things in a prefigure a type or a shadow are being unfolded and so when we see these things it it ought to it ought to encourage us when we see the things that are happening amongst our ranks it's not us just tremble and shake and you know sweep a quote underneath the rug and act like it's not there I don't know about you friends I'm not afraid of any quote I don't need to sweep any quote underneath the rug you know I I I came from a family would never deal with the issues and you know just we want to look happy and act like everything's all right we never want to deal with anything I don't I don't like that let's let's roll the sleeves up and let's get dirty let's figure it out let's work it out let's fix it yes sir yes sir we ain't got nothing to be afraid of friend you go sweeping a quot underneath the rug something's wrong with your Revelation right right amen now let's go back to St John chapter one and watch what Jesus does when Philip finds Nathaniel and we know the story and Nathaniel says to him you know he they say Philip says that he had found the Messiah and nael said Can there any good thing come out of Nazareth and he says come and see and so when Jesus Jus saw sees Nathaniel coming he tells him behold an Israelite and indeed whom is no gu and so Jesus does the Messiah sign yes yes Glory yes what Jesus is doing right there when when he discerns in 147 is actually second pool can I get an amen from Pastor yes sir now watch after and he tells him he said when did you see me he said when you under the Fig Tree I saw you but now watch what I have highlighted and and and whenever Nathaniel he says Rabbi Thou Art the Son of God Thou Art the king of Israel Jesus answered him because I said unto thee I saw thee under the Fig Tree thou believest Thou shalt see greater things than these and he said verily verily I say unto you Hereafter because you reive the second pool heaven will be open and the angels of God will be ascending and descending upon the son of man now what Jesus is doing he is reflecting first second and third pool all right here because St John 51 is is the third pool Ministry because remember what what what what happened what happened on Sunset Mountain yes sir what what happened when that cloud appeared amen what happened when that prophet of God went back and preach those seals yes brother Brenham tells us each angel came each day revealing the Loose Ends and so when you read the SE when you listen to or read the seals brother brandham says an angel came to him every day and so it was what Jesus is saying because you receive this Messiah sign by believing to discernment you are going to see the angels of God us sending and descending upon the son of man and so what did we see in 63 we saw the angels of God Serv of ascending and descending upon a son of man he was a son of man revealing the son of [Applause] man Hallelujah are y'all with me Glory Glory Wonder so so so John is catching all this and so in the very first chapter of John you see the message of the hour in typ and Shadow am I crazy praise the Lord yes sir now watch after this immediately after the first chapter Jesus is at a marriage supper right right beautiful and he does his first miracle yes and he turns the water yes into Revelation amen yes he does Amen when you receive the son of man Ministry this water becomes wine remember when Jesus goes to to to the to the marriage they're out of wine right there's six water pots Jesus is the seventh he fills them to the brim and then he says pour out and when they begin to drink they say you save the best Revelation to the end of the marriage supp amen amen praise God glor oh my brother that's right you it just shows how perfect this message is this is what I this is what I I hope it does for you because you know you can take the Old Testament but it God doesn't change his pattern and and and brother Brandon wasn't smart enough to pull all these things out and to place them so perfect so that somebody 60 50 years ago could preach this to you this morning without using a quote FY it's beautiful it's perfect not because I compiled it because it's the word of God right it's God's pattern he's beautiful and how he works now watch and and then after he does this and we're going to skip some because St John Chapter 2 Jesus uh Beats out of the temple with a with a braided Whip and uh that's a beautiful story in itself uh let me just this is just me I can't I can't some of this stuff I can't give you a quote but it's just types and shadows if you look at St John Chapter 2 Jesus braids the whip that's at the beginning of his ministry yes sir yes sir and he beats him out when he goes down to descend of the Mount of Olives he beats them out of the temple again that's in uh I can't remember Matthew Mark somewhere around there and and so there's two beatings of the cleansing of the temple God's perfect in three yes when's the third come we are the temple right and what it's not beating us out it's not legalism it's receiving the baptism of the Holy Spirit that's what the purif purification comes yes amen and Jesus was showing two is not Perfection it's three yes amen yes praise the Lord now and then in St John chapter 3 after he gives his first Miracle then he gives his first Doctrine all these things are in John just to remember and so he gives us the first doctrine of being born again I want you to notice the order and the significance of it because all of the seals and all those things are important but the most important thing is being born again yes it's his first Doctrine and his first miracle his first miracle was really testifying of the first Doctrine yes amen yes Glory Glory now and so and then also something else that you're going to find when you read John is John is one that is constantly over and over and over in the scriptures giving the evidence of being born again yes yes yes you know that me knows the testimony of sister Bruce right yes yes remember she had the holy ghost but she didn't know she did right you know and that was the first that's the only time there was a discernment that was recorded or a private interview listen that was good but that don't mean we all just base our testimony on sister Bruce right right right right because when you take the scriptures we have to know knowing we have the Holy Ghost in first John 1 one and verse two he says for the life was manifested and we have seen it and bear Witness and show it unto you that eternal life which was with the father when was manifested unto us which we have seen and heard declare we unto you yes they they didn't point you to an iPad they didn't point you to a book they showed it to you amen we ought to be able to show people eternal life Hallelujah glory in in St John excuse me 1 John 2:3 and here hereby we do know we we do know that we know him if we keep his Commandments he that saith I know him and keepeth not his Commandments is a liar and the truth is not in him but who so keepeth his word in him verily is the love of God perfected hereby know we are in him amen yes how do we know that we're born again because we are we are not contrary to the word of God but we are the word of God and and I we're not talking about just talking about the seals we're talking about every jot and T of the message am I believe we ought to live a Holiness life don't you that's right amen amen I believe we ought to live righteous before man and God hallelujah I'm not I'm not saved by works but my life ought to testify on Wednesdays amen yes yes Glory Glory first John 4:4 ye are of God little children and have overcome them I want you to notice little ones it's just so beautiful John actually talks to the little ones because remember John's trying to catch the little ones before Satan does amen glory that's right beautiful you little ones don't don't just turn off once you once Sunday school's over but you pay attention because God wants to talk to you just as much as he wanted to talk to brother Jesse amen you know you know this is inside note but times where a preacher come up and he's just preaching to the pastor to show how much Revelation he has you scratch your head you're like then you realize there about 30 40 other people in there to me I know brother Jesse understand I'm trying to get these little ones right there amen get that little boy in the vest right there just looking at his book hopefully he's got a little tuned in ear yes those are the ones I want to catch them little ones see because the older ones doesn't got it I got to worry about them we want to get the little ones don't we yes amen see that he that is in the world they are of the world therefore speak they of the world and the world Hearth them we are of God notice Jesus I come from God I go to what does John say we are of I am of Larry Smith right right yes sir John we are of God he that knoweth God heareth us he that is not of God heareth not us hereby know we the spirit of truth and the spirit of error yes sir another beautiful thing we'll get into later on probably this even evening John is is always hammering on the truth the spirit of Truth he's want to capitalizes on that because this is the hour we have truth amen amen right now then St John 36 3:16 how do we know that we're saved how do we know we're born again by Calvary yes God so loved the world as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness even so must the son of man be lifted up glory and we know St John 3:16 for God God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten son that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have ever lasting life amen Jesus is talking this to Nicodemus yes Jesus is prophesying amen now after this guess where he goes to the woman at the well Glory Glory now remember and when you see these sevens they're all throughout cuz remember she had had five husbands and the one she was living with was not her husband amen amen she didn't know she was going to get water but she ended up catching wine am because she met the seventh husband Christ that's right amen right and he tells her tells her right we know the story he had needs to go by Samaria and he begin to discern her you know the same way I don't know about you well you know don't ever turn off the discernment lines right right because if if if you if you'll pay attention and be Spirit God will discern your heart yes amen amen amen sometimes you know he'll say you're a deep thinker you cross you cross Bridges and when you get there they're never like they're supposed to be right you build Bridges and I listen that I'm like that's me yes sir yes sir that that that message is just as fresh today in 2016 as it was pred 40 50 years ago amen because it's not a it's it's not just a man from Kentucky it's the word of God for our day right glory and so and so when and so Jesus begins to discern her heart and he tells her God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth amen and so Jesus lays down this principle for her and we know the story she said come see a man come see a man that's told me you know and she ended up she ended up turning from a harlot to a messenger of God hello right now brother brandham takes this and he says and look at that little old illame woman she recognized it she wasn't indocumentadas not how big you are or how little you are he judges your heart what you want to be amen hallelujah praise the Lord for that Hallelujah and she didn't want none of that stuff and when this flashed before her that's what she wanted no matter what she was then she was ready to come see God judges the heart amen glory glory man judges the outward appearance God looks upon the heart no matter what she was that light flashed in that settlement she brought the essence of eternal life amen beautiful that little woman standing at the well in all that dirty condition that she was what did that symbolize so now the prophet of God says this was a symbol remember she's only in John right right the woman in the well is not in Matthew Mark or Luke beautiful only in John bride amen what did she symbolize that God in these last days would pull out out that that woman being ill Fame uh sit all kind of messed up baggage wow wow and she was a type an expression of this last day bride that God would have somebody at his marriage table I want to be there don't you amen amen praise the Lord now after this he goes to uh the nobleman in St John 4:50 um and this Noble woman had a man or had a son that was sick now uh uh in the other gospels this is to me uh brother B's not really clear on clear on this because he kind of combined the Centurion with this nobleman so I don't really know for certain but I don't know if this man was a gentile but even if he isn't he sure is expressing Gentile Faith yes yes because remember the Centurion had a servant the nobleman had a son yes and so this then Jesus when when he came to Jesus and and and he and he he he tells him his situation Jesus tells him in verse 50 go thy way thy son liveth and the man believed the word that had been spoken unto him and he went his way so this man believed the word that Jesus had spoken brother B takes this and he refers to this as Gentile Faith because uh Jews need something to touch lay your hands on there all these different things but but Gentiles just believe it I'm not wory for you to come under my roof but just speak the word right and so in verse his servants met him and said his son liveth verse 52 then inquired he of them the hour when he had be to amend and they said unto him yesterday at the seventh hour amen the fever left him glory and so brother vam takes this he actually preached on this because this is actually the second Miracle brother B preached a message called the second miracle and he takes this and he says because it said he begin to amend so it wasn't an instantaneous healing but but he calls it a miracle anyways the scripture does says it was Jesus's second miracle and brother bam says seemingly we wouldn't call that a miracle but it was a Mira Miracle because anything out of the ordinary it's Miracle so so so right now any say because we are here instead of having a hangover on Sunday morning we're here under the anointing of God and so right now anything that's out of the ordinary in lady oia is a miracle yes and so what is it we as Gentiles we just believe it brother benam says he says talking about faith he says next next has Faith that's deep it takes quite a little while some has Faith Like a mustard seed but if it's Mustard Seed Faith genuine Faith hold on to it keep believing it it'll become marble Faith then it'll become grapefruit faith and then it'll become Mountain Faith what he saying all we got to do is just believe amen amen just keep holding on Amen now is this okay yes wonderful Wonder praise the Lord now we just so you know we started about 45 minutes into this you know we about 15 minutes wonderful disclaim there all right um now we're going to go to St John chapter 6 and this is when Jesus is feeded fed to 5,000 now I want you to notice what happens because it's pretty striking what happens after Jesus feeds the 5,000 the Bible says in the 15th chapter that that when Jesus perceived that they would come and take him by force and make him a king he departed again alone into a mountain into a mountain himself alone so after Jesus feeds them and supplies their need they want to exalt him to a position of King amen but I want you to notice they're under the wrong anointing because they were bypassing Calvary and Redemption just to have a king over them amen now we're gonna we're going to skip over something and go back to it but Jesus picks this up in the 21st in this in the 25th verse and when they had found him on the other side of the sea they said unto him Rabbi when comest thou hither Jesus answered them said verily verily I say unto you you seek me not because you saw the Miracles but because you did eat of the Loaves and were filled now I want you to notice this is in only in John and it's actually because what is the hour my rights give me is that right it's it's you owe me right yeah it's it's uh it's the it's the government mentality of of you owe me you take care of me right uh sad sad to say when when they when they elected our President Obama they ran through the streets saying you know President Obama's gonna pay my rent right right they elected him because of the loaves right and the fishes right come on somebody f look at what is happening here in St John Jesus is saying you don't want me for miracles you want me for a handout wanted to make him a king they wanted to bypass Redemption and Calvary to exalt him to a place of kingship the same way we are lady oia when they vote they're not voting for what's right and what's wrong it's what you can do for me the Lord you won't find that the message so you can set that on the side few too but I can only say what I see so uh but but you see this in typ and Shadow friends this is this is this is John and so when and all I can show you is when not when you extract these things they're only in John so they got to before for us yes right and so remember brother ramam says every move that Jesus had had a significance and so when Jesus is saying these things only in John is for a purpose right now we're going to go back we're going to backtrack just a little bit into John and I want to take you to to there's Jerusalem on the map but we want to go to the north side of Israel to the Sea of Galilee and and we're going to go to when Jesus uh after he feeds the 5,000 he he he's he's as you see in St John 623 the Bible says after they went to capernium there was boats that came and they give us a description that when Jesus fed the multitude 5,000 they remember they were in the desert but they were somewhere near tiberious amen now it's very important because if it's somewhere in around Tiberius Jesus tells them to go to cernium yes everybody with me amen now if you take that it's about six and a quar miles from tiberias to capernium very important detail all right everybody with me so he just fed the 5,000 somewhere near capernium or Not N to Tiberius we see that 623 now I'm going to take you to St John 619 the Bible says when the evening was come very important evening time amen verse 19 so when they had rode about five or 20 or 30 furlongs that five and 20 thongs is about three miles okay now so they are somewhere about right there are y'all with me yes is that good amen does that make sense yes sir now everything is for a purpose Hallelujah and they draw and they they see Jesus walking on the sea and drawing nigh unto the ship and they were afraid right and he said unto them it is I don't be afraid right and so no doubt there's winds and waves and they're rowing and Rowing and they're trying to get somewhere and they're in the middle of their journey and the only thing that can say they're afraid of verse 21 is is now I gave you all this just for verse 21 the Bible says then they willingly yes amen when they willingly amen amen you can look at the winds look at the waves you look at your problems right you can point the finger to everybody else right amen yes but remember how many do I got point back at me so no matter who I point to yes now I got six point back at me right right so who's the problem no brother it's me that's me brother me brother he probably win but it says when they willing praise God praise God Jesus will not force his way into your ship amen amen you can roll and roll row and R you may get there but it was all you right so really what happened is there was actually a translation Glory yeah amen yes if you look at that immediately and run it through the Scriptures it means immediately it's not a Greek word that means something different so trust me we ain't got time to go into it but you look at a Greek word it means immediately when they received him into the ship and iMed medely the ship was at the land whether they went Jesus wasn't dealing with the 5,000 the multitude he was dealing with elect amen yes Glory so he said brother brother G I'm bride okay you still got a will so what yes yes you still got a will I don't care how much bride you are you still are a problem I'm still a problem amen we we have got to get to that spot if Jesus in The Garden of Gethsemane the word of God the word of God the Son of God God made flesh would say not my will yes but that be done amen what are we as sinful man Redeemed by that precious blood right ought to say Amen it's my will I'm the one I'm the Man Hallelujah right amen they immediately so so here's the thing what what we ought to take from this is when we're in a circumstance and we're trying to get somewhere the problem of it is is not getting there the problem of it is is letting Jesus in the ship get you there Jesus Jesus Will separate himself and go in the mountain you know kind of like the eagle looking down at his Eagle go in the mountain to pray but his eye was on the Little Eagles playing they we do right right you know how children getting like we all like father how many fathers is in here and we see him when we see him struggling and we like Papa Eagle let me show you how to do it right right amen because Papa Eagle knows how to do it yes and by the way if you're a real daddy Papa Eagle loves to do it for yeah loves to instruct them yes let me do it with you yes praise God and so they were immediately at the ship whether they went now after this Jesus feeds them but he's not feeding them just for anything any reason after Jesus does this miracle he unfolds himself in another characteristic and he says I am the bread of life praise God praise God now he says I'm the living bread which came down from heaven If any man eat this bread he shall live and the bread that I will give is my flesh which is I will give for the life of the world then Jesus said unto them verily verily I say unto you except you eat the Flesh of the son of man and drink his blood you'll have no life in you and the doctors and the Physicians and the nurses said this man's a vampire that's right right and he didn't explain it amen amen yes just the same way he he'll he'll let listen to a tape and he won't explain it just to see your reaction amen yes and if you say oh nothing to it into you go a frog plop plop go right Amen brother we don't want Frogs We want rainbow trout if you a rainbow you'll be on the you'll be on the bank flipping and flopping I don't know but it's good brother I don't understand it but I love it Hallelujah now and we see in St John 666 now you only find that I believe it's in first or 2 Chronicles chapter in verse 666 and we know this is the marking of the Beast yes sir only in John by the way wow wow yes sir from that time many of his disciples went back and walk no more with him remember the moment you reject the Seal of God you receive the mark of the beast yes sir yes sir yes sir then said Jesus unto the 12 now what he didn't sugarcoat it right you ever know you ever notice like preachers are becoming more like politicians even in the message yeah right I wonder if a listen to The Prophet anymore right right right then Jesus said unto the 12 he didn't pity Pat them all amen will you go away also amen you listen to the message you say that man called me a chicken right beside that man call me all what you are what's on the inside of you is what really matters right and then Simon said these beautiful words answered him Lord to whom shall we go thou has the words eternal life Glory he didn't understand it but he knew there was something about that voice Glory watch brother man takes this watch this and he says now remember in the days of that that lion came the original word talking about the the first AG he said 100th of them listened to that line in the days of the ox came just a teeny little bit of them listened to the ox message in the days that the man come he worked among them see he was shrewd he got a little group out what and what did they do Satan seen that so he just sent them right back and marries them into it and remember when the eag finally comes it'll be 100 of 1% that'll listen it's a eagle [Music] age you know it's so popularly talk about the 1centers right right Glory we're the 100th of the 1% amen that really missing God because we're under anointing you want to talk about a billionaire the Billionaire's Club we're the 100 to the 1% Club amen not just not just listening to the message not just occupying a a message view or you know looking down on denominal Brothers but actually living the message becoming the message now we're coming up to St John chapter 7 and we saw a lot of seven so wouldn't St John 7 be special yes sir yes sir to the seventh age amen let me answer it for you yes now we'll go through some things in St John God does seven miracles before the resurrection in St John 2 he turned the water into wine in St John 4 he healed the s woman son in St John 5 he heals the man at the pool of Bethesda in St John 6 he feeds the 5000 in St John 6 he walks on water in St John nine he heals the man that was born blind and in St John 11 there's the resurrection of Lazarus amen so in St John there's seven miracles before the resurrection praise God praise God and then after to the resurrection there's a great catch of fishes yes amen amen now in St John he gives himself seven characteristics of I am yes in St John 6 he tells us that he's the bread of life in St John 8 he tells us that he's the light of the world Amen in St John 10 he said he's the door of the sheep in St John 10:1 he tells us that he's the Good Shepherd in St John 11 he tells us he's the resurrection and the life and in St John 14 he tells us he's the way the truth and the life and I want you to notice at the seventh characteristic he doesn't stop at just revealing himself amen amen but he actually reveals who you are too Glory Glory oh Hallelujah Glory Hallelujah because it's at the seventh age at this age bride age it can't just stop it brother Brandon right it can't stop at Jesus amen it has to come to the full measure yes GL I am Divine but you you are the branches I am present tense he reveals himself in the characteristics seven distinct characteristics only in John he reveals himself as the I am also in J St John 8:58 he just seals it up and says before Abraham was I am all right now now then watch in St John 7 verse1 this is this is uh this is very significant now remember uh when John wrote this he didn't write chapter 7 verse one right right right but some man later on down the road added every chapter and verse yes sir yes sir but God knew where the chapters and verses was when he anointed John to write the book amen right right yes so the significance at St John chapter 7 would have to be vital to the seventh age wouldn't it yes yes it would have to right and it is now very important because in verse two he gives us the description that it's the Feast of Tabernacles was at hand now the Feast of Tabernacles how many knows that there's seven feasts yes sir unto the Lord how many knows where the the Feast of Tabernacles is that preach it brother that's thank you sir yes yes sir the Feast of Tabernacles was the last Feast yes the seventh Feast so in St John 7 is the last Feast now watch now there's a turmoil in Jesus's immediate family because his Brethren is confused not his disciples remember he has four brothers and sisters right right amen yes now and so we see that uh remember he talks about Mary you know your mother and your brothers outside it was his brethren in Matthew 13:55 was James Joseph Simon and Judas he had sisters so Jesus had brothers and sisters by the scriptures but I want you to notice in St John 7 Brethren are confused yes yes therefore they said unto him depart hence and go to Judah that thy disciples Also may see the work that thou doest now and it says for there now watch their confusion for there is no man that doeth anything in secret and he himself seeketh to be known openly if thou do these things show thyself unto the world for neither did his his Brethren believe in him and he tells him go up unto the feast I go not up yet unto this Feast for my time is not yet full come his Brethren is confused because they're saying if this message was real the whole world would know God wow wow just like they're saying if brother Brandon was a prophet how come nobody knows about it right right brother amen yes right good I read it out of the book friends and so his Brethren at this St John 7 at the Feast of Tabernacles there's a turmoil in his immediate family just like some of us are treated like we're crazy by our family oh William Brown right right but let me let me give you a little bit of encouragement though they're confused in St John 7 if you read Acts chapter 1 I think 13 and 14 Mary and his brethren go into the upper room Mary and his brother go in the upper room they get the baptism of the holy spirit so they miss Jesus but they caught the Holy Ghost so just hold on Friends be salty when they don't understand you you still be salty am don't don't get mad that's when you show your colors yes and if you fly up and you want to blast them something's wrong with you you get all hoty and high minded something's wrong with your spirit that's right Jesus didn't do anything he didn't act up amen waitting they missed it for a season but he knew they'd catch it and we have to have that same faith for our families Glory beautiful amen you read that in Acts chapter one I believe or 14 now I I want I want you to notice Let me just I missed this part brother Brandon tells in future homie says the Feast of Tabernacles was the last Feast the seventh Feast we are worshiping now under the Feast of Tabernacles the seventh Church age right right okay so I'm not not just shooting from the hip on this so so now we see he tells him to go up for his time has not yet come now in verse n when he said unto these he had had said unto these words unto them he Abode still in Galilee but when his Brethren were gone up they went they went he also up unto the feast I but as it were right right kind of like the sealed mystery yes sir yes right and so Jesus is playing all these things out and Jesus is hiding himself in the last Feast secretly praise God now now about the mid this this Feast of Tabernacle was lasted seven days so in the midst of this 7day Feast Jesus goes up to the temple and he begins to teach Glory Glory he begins to unloose amen it begins to unfold now remember what did what did the angel tell brother brandom about the third pool be a public show amen praise God beautiful right it'll be a secret and Jesus is doing the same thing when when he comes in the middle his Feast secretly now watch now as as he begins to unfold himself watch what they say in 7:25 then some of them then some of them of Jerusalem is not this he whom they seek to kill but Lo he speaketh boldly and they say nothing unto him do the rulers know indeed that this is the very Christ watch the confusion Jesus manifested flesh notice the confusion in the church how be it we know that this man when he is but when Christ cometh no man know whence he is so now they're confused about Jesus and denying him to be the Christ right verse 28 then cried Jesus in the temple as he taught saying you know me and you know whence I am he's telling them you know exactly who I am just like Nicodemus said Lord we know that our teacher come from God cuz no man can do these things but because of their denominational differences they would not accepted amen yes he says and I am not come of myself but he that sent me is true whom you know not but I know him for I am from him and he that sent me then they sought to take him but no man laid hands on because th not yet come and many of the people believed on him and said when Christ cometh I want you to notice there they Believing on him but they're not seeing him for what he truly is yes yes yes will he do more miracles than these which this man doeth notice what they're doing brother Bram this same thing happened in our age brother brandham tells us this he says oh you false teachers listening to these tapes all these years and seeing God confirm exactly what he said and you sat in your study and know it's the truth right and because of your denominational differences you dispute them and tell your people not that it's not not so woe unto you your time is close at hand amen and the same thing is happening as Jesus is in the midst of that Feast revealing himself the exact same thing is happening in a prefigure what happened in the first is happening in the second amen yes goodness watch in St John 12 you're only going to find this in St John you also find it in nine nevertheless among the chief rulers Al so many believed on him but because of the denomination they did not confess him lest they should be put out of the denomination right amen for they love the Praises of that denomination more than the Praises of God you won't find this in Matthew Mark or Luke you'll only find it in John W when they're being put out of the church you also find in St John chapter n when the man that's born blind is healed and he gets put out and Mom and Dad reject him for the denominational church right right and watch St John 162 they shall put you out of the synagogues ye the time cometh that whosoever kth you will think that he does God a service is that not where we're at right right yes were they were they're calling wrong right and right wrong y sir when when they're when they're saying that you got to teach your children all these filthy things right when when you try to raise them right and according to the scriptures that they say that you're full of hate right right yeah on friends this is this is Bible this is Bible we we have not to think it's strange concerning these things that are come to try us some strange things happen it's got to be but God promised that there would be a standard raised at this time glory amen oh W one o' let let me just let me just can I just find a place to stop Yes you find it yes sir now watch in St John 7:37 I want you to notice the placing of this it's the last day the great day of the feast so at the end of the seventh Feast the last day of the feast Jesus stood up and cried what's he doing he's he's he's he's loosening himself he's revealing himself what what is this seven sealed book friends it's not just a history when when those seals was loosed in 1963 it loosed The Plan of Redemption yes yes it wasn't just so we can know what the White Horse red horse Pale Horse black horse all that was it was to show our name is in the book amen yes and Jesus is doing this in prefigure If any man thirst let him come unto me and drink he that believeth on me watch as the scripture had said out of his belly shall flow rivers of Living Water so remember he goes up in secret at the beginning at the end he unleashes himself he looses himself and something that is inside becomes May known yes right where is the water at but but where the water is not just coming out of Jesus right it's coming out of you amen where is the word where is the seed yes sir send me yes amen when was it put in you thank you it wasn't when you came to the altar you received it it just had to be released and it was when you saw your name in the book those seals were revealed they were loosed and out of you out of your belly flow rivers of Living Water the life is in the sea yeah it just had to be quicker it had to be loosed amen just like this book it took the mighty angel coming down to loose those seals and what reveal who we are hallelujah it's what's coming out of us it's Rivers 66 of them of one word amen Rivers bur rivers of water amen and Jesus is loosening this and and as he said because this spake he of the spirit which they that believe on him should receive for the Holy Ghost was not yet given because Jesus had not yet glorified and so what is this friends it's not information this message is not information right it's Revelation amen yes it's not how much we know it's who we know oh yes amen amen beautiful it's it's not real it's not realizing that I've got to have a eagle belt buck and I got to be a good Hunter and right I don't have either one of those but it's knowing that I heard the eagle cry yes yes and when I heard that eagle scream I realized hey I looked at them feathers I looked at mine and I looked at her feet at my feet Yes yes I said if she can do it am yes glory and we ought to be able to hear this message and go wait a minute what he's saying that's me yes Glory when he says something like you ought to say hey he's got a wing like mine yeah when he preaches Holiness she like hey he believes like I believe yes amen amen and it's something that realize that's me I look in the word of God when I read John I go my goodness a woman at the well yes yes yes sir and I believe this all that I said to this spot was so that we all in this room ought to be able to see this book and go amen glory we ought to see John look at him in a different life as not just the disciple whom Jesus loved but when we read that he laid on the bosom of Jesus we ought to go hey amen amen when John says the disciple whom Jesus loved he got to go hey yes Glory when Peter's running or when Peter's following the uh them behind Jesus when he's getting ready to go to Calvary and the other disciple we ought to go hey that's me Hallelujah beautiful we ought to be able to realize these things if God put them in here only in here that I believe they're special for us so that we could see the the pattern of God and be able to see the continuity of God and go wait a minute God's trying to tell us something amen and ought to encourage us to be able to realize that in this last feast in this last Feast maybe I just share this we we'll stand we'll stand I'm so sorry and and and and let me just say this I wanna I want to share this with you because after this if you look at if you look at the Feast of Tabernacles something else was special that happened at the Feast of Tabernacles it was also during the time of the year of release how many knows what the year of release is that's when that's when the the the high priest would go through the country and he'd blow the trumpet and whoever was a slave they could throw whatever they had down and say I'm free amen amen no matter how great a debt it was no matter how busted up the marriage was Family Life addiction they could throw it down and say I'm free that was the year of release and so when Jes Jesus is expressing this uh uh Watch What Happens because immediately after this you know what happens it's the woman that's caught in the act of adultery and they go contrary to the word only bring her and they throw her at his feet this woman was taken in adultery what the Bible Moses says this how you say Jesus just wrote he said he that's without sin Let You cast the first stone and the Bible says then he stoop down the road the Bible says when they heard it when they hold heard that spoken word conviction struck their heart yes yes and I want to say this when you feel conviction listen little ones when you feel convi how many knows what conviction is when you do something wrong and you feel bad yes you know when you do something wrong and you feel bad that's the greatest feeling in the world you want to know why because there's millions that don't feel it right but when you do wrong and there's something in your heart that's oh oh I shouldn't have done that yeah yes oh that's the greatest feeling in the world amen amen because that's the goodness of God that's leading you to repentance Hallelujah but you know what when that conviction struck them they left the word but there was something different about her she stayed yes amen she stayed yes yes and when Jesus lifted up himself and saw but the woman he said unto Heroman where are those thine accusers have no man condemned thee she said no man Lord and Jesus said unto her neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more see what did he do remember the Feast of Tabernacles year of release he loosed her God in the eighth chapter what is eight a new beginning praise God the eighth chapter the new beginning hello is that right brother talks about the eighth day going back to the beginning and when she is in her sinful condition she hears the word conviction no man Lord I don't condemn you just go and send no more and what happened he loosed her he gave her a new beginning on the eighth chapter what is that speaking of what is woman in the Bible Church bride and what is he doing what does this message do what does the seals do it's not just loosing the the book of understanding it's loosing us from our sinful ways it's loosing us from a life of condemnation it's loosing us from a life of guilt and shame it's loosing us from this uh uh Lal condition yes yes and it's giving us life and life more abundantly praise God our heads as we bow our heads maybe every head bowed every eye closed and if if you if you're at that spot you've got that conviction in your heart it's in my heart just now we are the happiest people in the world not not happiness and laughter like the world thinks it but happiness and joy that the Holy Spirit convicts us when we do wrong showing us the error of our ways but it's not to condemn us it's to really loose us yes that we can go and sin no more and brother sister you that's here this morning under the sound of God's voice not mine the sound of God's voice the voice that's talking to you in your heart when you feel that God is dealing with your heart not to just give you a halfway Deliverance but to give you total Deliverance amen but what you have to do is you have to let him in your ship you have to be willing to let him in your Shi yes maybe you've rode for more than 25 or 30 fur Longs maybe you've rode for years you're trying to get
