every every person be here to you tonight and may your glory Lord manifested ones lips were so grateful for you Lord we're so grateful for this opportunity in the living more time lift up your great name we just counted a privilege Minister not to us in Jesus Christ Church said Amen praise God let's take our Bibles for tonight the God's grace we'll go to the scripture I like to look into you looking at the kingdom of God we've been looking at it quite frequently tonight I like to look at a couple parables and we'll see how far we can get so let's go to Revelation 13 by the grace of the Lord I believe we'll just go there we'd like to look at the the symbols that deal with sin so let's go to Revelation 13 of course we're not negative I'm sorry we're not majoring on the negative here focuses on the negative but when we look at the negative it always illuminates the positive and always manifest the truth if we look to the scripture here so let's read this parable here tonight the grain of the mustard seed here praise God earth you chapter 13 I'm sorry did I say revelation 13 I'm sorry Matthew chapter 13 maybe that song were these got me thinking about Revelation worthy the lamb forgive me my fault revelation 13 I'm sorry Matthew 13 thank you goodness my goodness Matthew 13 my all right and I'd like to look at the leaven let's look at the leaven scripture here tonight I apologize I want to find it real quick here in my Bible the 31 oh thank you sir appreciate that yes thank you thank you appreciate that oh yeah that's the and then Elevens right after that yeah so we can do 31 to 33 thank you appreciate that all right Matthew 13 not revelation Matthew 13:31 I'll read verse 31 another parable put he forth unto them saying the kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of mustard seed which a man took and sowed in his field first which indeed is the least of all seeds but when it has grown it is the greatest among herbs and becometh a tree so that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof now let's read verse 33 together here on three one two three another parable spake he unto them the kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven which a woman took and hid in three measures of meal till the whole was 11 may God has busing reading of his word you may be seated I'm just gonna put a visual there but I don't have many quotes here tonight they'll just got a few visuals just to kind of keep us thinking about the kingdom of heaven this of course is a chapter I wrote I think Joy's already may have read this chapter here and edit it for me I had to expand it sister I forgot to tell you I told you about that but had to expand it because I went through the scripture and I seen there were 16 parables about the kingdom of heaven so first I thought there was only seven not really maybe studying it as much as I ought to so Lydia you can switch over there and I found out there were sixteen so by God's grace so I look at the the grain of the mustard seed tonight and the leaven hid in the three measures of meal tonight okay this is part eight I believe of the series and will be rejoicing in the word of the Lord here alright so let me go back here so I've now found out I could be wrong on this too but I've given a lot of time and study hopefully I got it nailed down now because I went and searched every time the New Testament said Kingdom and then I was focusing on Jesus's parables and I believe I found 16 parables of the kingdom of heaven I hope that's right I once thought there was only seven but shows it gotta study something now a lot more before I make a statement like that themes of the kingdom now I divided these sixteen into some common themes I just kind of had this thought come upon my heart as I was studying it I saw how there was themes so like tonight we'll look at this we'll look at the the two parables on sin and what's interesting that I found is that each theme has Italy two parables and that's like Jesus said in the mouth of two or three witnesses let every word be established so that was very comforting to my heart the Holy Ghost and the rapture have two that are very similar the King son and the ten virgins five of them deal with plain salvation the treasure in the field the pearl great price will may be preached on those may be Lord willing next Wednesday the labors in the vineyard the unmerciful servant and the seed cast in the ground this has been a real fresh revelation to me this parable shows the three works of grace justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost I never seen that I really started studying that and praying about that because brother Brandt well we know the Bible says Jesus says the kingdom of heaven is within you so the kingdom of heaven has to be the baptism of the Holy Ghost so why would Jesus use a parable about the three stages of wheat unless he was talking about the three works of grace which is ZQ also prophesied of new heart new spirit my spirit amen so you can totally see that those three stages all through the entire Bible of course there's a whole lot more of them you know but I'll just stop right there now there's to our own kind and time rather conditions two of those you've already preached on those I just put the ones I preached in orange just to give me a visual there's two on the Jew and Gentile the wicked husbandmen and the great supper and there's three on responsibility or I just maybe call it stewardship I could get rid of service and responsibility and we just preached on that last week of the four grounds last week by the grace of the Lord so hopefully those have been a blessing and they've been a blessing to you now still my prayer church is your pastor still my prayer Ben pastored almost 14 well thirteen half years that everybody can recognize their gifts and talents in their life my that's and that's one of the great mysteries is the mystery of God's will so if you don't know keep praying keep seeking God devote extra time and study and prayer to it so that you can know what talents or what pounds the Lord has placed in your life and then you can invest in them right now you can see such you can see them abound as Peter said you'll see them abound more and more you know as all these all these character attributes of a statue preferred manner in you you'll see them abound more and more that's my desire and I'm gonna just Lord willing one Sunday we'll look at gifts again and we'll keep preaching on that to try to just clinch that nail so everybody can be seeking God for their gifts in life and their purpose in life praise God so let's go back here I'll just I'll just leave it up there I don't really like I said I don't have a lot of quotes to show today I just want to kind of show the scriptural teachings on these and how the Prophet brought these out alright so we'll try to get to these two like I said we have time maybe we'll jump to some of the other ones here you know sometimes I think I got plenty of notes I go so fast sometimes I don't think I have enough and it goes so slow so many times of course it depends on the poll of the people praise God so may Lord bless us tonight now the first one here the grain of mustardseed now I tried to try to give these revelations or one one sentence revelation just to kind of make it concise so it seems like the revelation of the grain of mustardseed is that the false church started small but grew until it was large and filled with all demonic powers okay now there's there's two quotes on the church age book where brother Branham does use these parables for that purpose and so that's why I I take that stance on it now of course it will look at the other side it could we know mustard seed Jesus does say mustard seed does represent faith but as far as the kingdom of heaven it seemed knowing the end times and knowing the church ages like we do and knowing how brother Branham worked about four or five years on the church age book it would seem that after four or five years of working on the book and those symbols that all those thoughts were well thought out and they were salt with prayer to the Lord and so it seemed like the main emphasis of this parable is to show the deceitfulness of sin and how the false church started small but then grew to as large and filled all didn't I'm sorry demonic powers so this is the parable and it has sort like we said dual meaning okay but the get meaning it seems to be more powerful or more prevalent in Scripture and it's especially the message than the first but the first one is how a tiny mustard seed is like under faith in God's Word so we can read that in Matthew 17:20 I'll just turn there Matthew 17:20 we'll just read it out of scripture Matthew 17:20 and Jesus said unto them because of your unbelief for verily I say to you if you have faith as a grain of mustard seed you shall say unto this mountain remove hence to yonder place and it shall remove and nothing shall be impossible unto you now we looked at this recently when we preached times and seasons and brother man takes the same scripture remember he struggled with this scripture for years what does it mean how can a man do this and brother man was struggling with Jesus said this before the atonement you know before is the cross and everything and and then the Holy Spirit showed brother Branham that it was God it was God using the human voice it wasn't that human thought thought in his own words himself but it was God actually borrowing that person like me borrowing this microphone amen God borrows the human's voice and it's God speaking through the individual and not the individuals thoughts themselves in other words this person if they're going to speak to the mountain they got to have the mind of Christ first they men before they speak praise God and so that was the great revelation that the Prophet learned when he spoke six squirrels into existence he learned that it's it's the faith it's faith is a revelation of the will of God brother Branham says and so that's what each person must speak to to remove a mountain in the message milligrams cause mountain sicknesses and so church you know you and I can look back on our lives and we can see times where obstacles seemingly as great as a mountain have been moved by us speaking the word right think about great trials or great struggles that you've had to endure in life and alls it took was the anointing of the anointing of the Holy Spirit to come upon you you speak the word and then the mountain moves whether it was that day whether it was instantly or whether it took a month or a week or five years or whatever it took there's power and the Word of God when the when God speaks or an individual it's just like God speaking amen that's not the individuals word anymore it's God's word amen and so we've seen it as well I was rehearsing often but speaking of different you know to these two situations where women could have babies we've spoken the word and then instantly right after that soon after that they had babies amen when doctors have told them you're never gonna have a baby impossible but the power of the spoken word when it's spoken by God's will it moves the mountain amen and that's not for us to pat ourselves on the back or know how to make us more humble to realize that thank God we got out of the flesh and could get in the spirit long enough to do God's will amen because it's so often we don't do God's will and we want to do God's will praise God we want to walk in the spirit as often as we possibly can we know we backside daily and so forth like that but we want to get back in the spirits moving amen now that's the scripture about how faith is small like a mustard seed now and then this faith brings forth miracle fruit when it's kept out of the heart so let's go to mark 11:22 mark 11 22 and 23 yeah very similar scripture here parallel passage and Jesus answering saith unto them have faith in God for verily I send you that whosoever shall say in this mountain be thou removed and be thou cast in the sea and shall not doubt in his heart so the sea there is doubt that will creep in but shall believe that those things which he says shall come to pass he shall have whatsoever he saith amen and brother him you know many times he likens dau unto a cloud like on a cloudy overcast day right but man was talking about in if God be with us where be all them caracals right on the it was the the New Year's Eve service in 1961 I believe if I'm not mistaken and brother Adam preaches on that and he talks about how Gideon he was a gallant man but he said a lot of doubt had clouded over Israel because they had had a miracle how to had profits for a while and Gideon said if God be with us where be all the miracles and brother Adam said that the angel the Lord had to come to Gideon and then Gideon had to prove God Gideon was the kind of person that needed proof from God before he would act and church many times were that way to God show me a sign God showed me a sign God showed me a sign there's nothing wrong with that church like Guinea was a man of God but see God knew and Robert I remember I read the quote last Sunday that God works with the creature the way he's made some people don't need signs some people just need to feel that anointing and then they just speak whatever comes their mind praise God they don't have to have a sign but many of us well we want to go to Lourdes and prayer and say Lord I'll know it's you if I pray and let this come to pass right and there's nothing wrong with that you know we know that as long as the heart is right God doesn't mind being proved does he because he even says it with ties prove me right prove if you obey your ties see if I won't open the windows of heaven and pour our blessings you don't have room to receive amen I think that how many witness that he does it I am I'm a witness praise God that he does it and we're faithful he pours out the blessings praise God but see the thing we got to do is keep faith in our heart and not doubt the Word of God now what's he what's comforting to us and only don't let the devil play guilt trip on you well I doubted for awhile I doubted for a while don't let the devil put a guilt trip on you because I know a man who who's called the father of faith and he went through many doubt trials did he not did not Abraham down a few times and and even bring forth an Ishmael and he died you know he went through some difficult times but the Bible said and brother man tells us when God wrote the divine commentary on Abraham the Bible said he staggered not at the promise of God amen I don't know you see he didn't give up on God he made a mistake he fell short of the glory God but a righteous man is not judged by what he falls a righteous man is judged by how many times he Rises amen so see don't let the devil beat you up and say well I thought I spoke the Word of God five years ago or I thought it was maybe it wasn't don't doubt keep believing praise God keep trusting in the Living God never lose your confidence cast out away therefore your confidence in their Living God amen see faith many times has to last longer than a week it's gotta last longer than a month or longer than a year longer than a decade Abraham's faith lasted 25 years right and then he had that faith when he had to take Isaac up there to be sacrificed again his faith had to keep lasting but church you know and I know if it's God's faith and if it's a mustard seed and you keep watering that faith it's gonna grow into something great praise God with each trial that you get victory over of each trial your faith increases how many can say Amen look at your life over last year you know you overcome this you overcome that you overcome criticism you overcome a lack of money you overcome a sickness and your health being attacked you overcome all these things but what does it do each time it prepares you for the next battle praise God each time you're gonna feel a little stronger and each time you get a little more confident in God then I know God he was with me last time he'll be with me this time amen like David he was with me with the line he was with me with the bear and God will be with me to overcome this Goliath Amen honey to this uncircumcised philistine Amen so see it's we have to keep the doubt out of our heart and the way to do that is prayer worship confession praise God coming to the house of God amen to receive and be refreshed remember Bertram's house is the house of God is a hospital praise God the Good Samaritan parable brother Ram teaches on he says see Jesus was that Samaritan he's the one that thank God thank God when you were wounded he poured in the oil and the wine I know yeah he poured in the baptism with Holy Ghost he poured in the stimulation and then he takes you off to an inn and by the and says that in keeper is your pastor but don't be upset don't be discouraged God give him two pence God give them the spirit and truth praise God amen so when you're as sure as you're regaining strength as you're growing as you're as you're coming and getting healthy in the house of God your pastor will preach the Holy Spirit and oh preach truth and that'll be enough and when Jesus comes back at the end the parable says if he owes the preacher anything he'll give it to you but she's thinking oh it's nothing amen he don't need to owes nothing all he's given his grace is sufficient for our weaknesses praise God he shall have a gyro he's provided all things amen hallelujah so see God's faith that he gives us is small like a mustard seed but we've got to protect that praise God how many protecting it tonight you're holding on to the promise of God you're watering the promise of God and you want to see it grow into something great in your life amen so that when the mountain comes you're able to speak to the mountain and move the mountain amen by the power of God hallelujah as we said we when they're in Albion a few weeks ago there's numerous sisters that come up with doubt and brothers that come up with doubt and lying spirits you know hovering over them and each time as we just got down to the very cause of this as we got down to the root of every little root of bitterness or the whatever root it was when it was rooted up then the mountain or whatever this obstacle was it had to leave praise God and tears of Thanksgiving and shouts of joy were experienced in other words mountains were moved by faith amen the will of God revealed and then mountains moving those mountains my lay there for five years ten years twenty years some of them thirty years some of them 60 years old and not knowing if they're saved or born again but when the Holy Spirit begins up Rudy when the Holy Spirit begins the movie you're gonna see mountains move if you can just believe with faith in your heart amen it's as simple just saying I believe I believe I have confidence I know God's Word can never fail amen oh my so small little mustard seed but it brings forth great things if we can just keep out all the doubts I like my brother branham said he said doubt your doubts right doubt your doubts if you're doubting something well no I shouldn't have that why do I have then I doubt that Satan's lying right he's a liar and a father of lies praise God so let's doubt our doubts and let's hold on to God's unchanging hand if we're the seed of Abraham then we know we're the friend of God as well more than a friend were his bride amen remember program said Jesus is whispering love secrets to his bride as we approach the wedding right he's whispering his love secrets his promises amen hallelujah now I'd like to move now to the the negative side cuz I it seems to be there's more scriptural support here for this parable being about the false church kind of the wheat and the tares you know you have the wheat with any other tares and the tares are so there's so many of them you know that that they can't root up the tares because if you read of the tares to read up the root up the wheat as well as we looked at at the parable the net you know the net that's all that's all about you know the end time conditions how there's good vessels and bad vessels there's the the anointing falls on the just and the unjust praise God the anointed ones at the end time so we have to recognize that Jesus not just all of his King all of his kingdom parables don't just deal with good things or happy things many of them reveal the enemy praise God and we ought to be thankful for that that's the glory of the seals the glory that seals is that yes we can see our four anointings but the glorious we see that anointing in order to feed the white horse rider praise God the red horse rider the black rider The Pale Rider that's the glory of it that we have the anointing to defeat Satan and every one of his tricks if you're not excited about that you better get excited about that hey man you ought to be excited that sin gets for exposed in your life and doesn't become something but doesn't become a big mountain or a root of bitterness you ought to be thankful that you can fly above all those temptations with that ego anointing amen we ought to be amen hallelujah now here's the mysterious part many people don't see the false church in the scripture yes I can recognize the faith but we also recognize the false part of it too because the the early false church started by the very smallest of lies the Jesus calls it Nikolay it ISM and then now it's flourishing and it's so great now to eat we preached on the Mystery Babylon a few months ago it's so great now where the Bible said that all the kings of the earth make love to the Roman Catholic Church all nations all nations all nations are deceived it's so it's grown so great that every nation is going to come in to some type of evil relationship with the Roman Catholic Church and it's gonna be a worldwide thing and that's what we see here the worldwide habitation of devils and this great I'm sorry this small little sea that goes into this great church that's filled with all demonic powers now notice how God protected his church in their infancy so if you go to the scripture let's go to acts five thirteen and fourteen notice how God protected the church acts five thirteen and fourteen ax5 13 and 14 now remember this is right after Ananias and Sapphira now there's a good teaching for Sunday Peter had the gift of discernment right because they come lying to him but see how the see how the gifts kept the church clean see how that see why we need to be able to be we have to be so yielded to the Holy Spirit that we have gifts moving in here that would discern a lying spirit right god forbid it should come in but God test his church right and Satan's pointing every gun in our church to try to take down our church because we say we got the baptism of Holy Ghost we say we got the message of the hour we say we got thus saith the Lord so Satan's got every one of his guns trained at us so what better Church to come in and and try to see with lies see what do we need we need the gifts in operation right they don't have to be in the service they can be outside - doesn't really matter God we shouldn't care where they happen we should just care that they that they are used for the glory of God amen we should be eat just as yielded in here as we were yield in the parking lot amen we should be just as yield in our prayer closet before church or just as you'd in our car like our sister was yield at the air at the grocery store what a beautiful testimony of how God can speak to a heart no matter where you are we should be so you know wherever we are that God can speak to us and then through us to keep the church clean amen hallelujah remember any church that doesn't receive the gifts brother Branham says is not the real bride so see bride if we're a bride we can't say well you know the gifts or just something we don't have to worry about know we have we want the major the majors the baptismal egos we want the giver but then if you got the giver he wants to show you the gifts praise God so see we got to have a great balance there but look at this gift of discernment see they couldn't lie to Peter cuz he got this gift of the sermon and the Holy Spirit picked it up he said you lied to the Holy Ghost amen now verse 13 and 14 and of the rest Durst no man join himself to them but the people magnified to them so see at the beginning God protected this people see that not anybody could join their church at the beginning the Holy Ghost was fallen there under the line anointing their boat they got signs wonders and miracles and and it's just on a tremendous level it's a old tremendous level and no man could join God was protecting her because she's in her infancy don't you mothers coddle your babies right after they're born do you let anybody hold him I know my wife doesn't I don't need really either I don't like I don't like we got a brand-new baby just give her to somebody who's coughing or walk off the street you don't know what the germs they've been around you want to protect that baby and so Jesus here is protecting the early church and he kept it keeps everybody out for a while remember the church agents art to what 80 53 when the Holy Ghost fall 80 33 or 34 one of those I'm not sure and I'm not really a scholar like that but so for about 20 years or more God protects them and God lets them grow and become strong and feed on the sincere milk of the word of God amen Oh church have you tasted tonight that the Lord is good amen Peter said have you tasted that God is gracious how does that taste oh it's delicious a man its glorious it's wonderful God is gracious and that's the taste way we should leave in our mouths when we leave service God is gracious God is merciful hallelujah look at verse 14 and believers were the more added to the Lord look at added to the Lord multitudes both of men and women talked about growing pains and then the next chapter they got growing pains right all these people are these Grecians our organ where is our daily bread where is our daily bread and then they get wisdom to raise up deacons don't they see every church goes through growing pains don't they when God adds to the church there's a little growing pains but there's just row fees of God's grace amen hallelujah we grow in grace and knowledge of the Lord but see God was keeping his church pure at the beginning keeping them from the the pollution of all these false teachers now also notice this - I want to just reading some of these notes I have here around now around 1890 when John wrote his epistle first John now Ford they're about 60 years and now he says there's not just a few Antichrist he said there's many Antichrist in the world so ciose it took was a little bit of time and they go from having no no evil really in the church other than just their he own humanity but God was keeping out all the false teachers for a while but then 60 years later there's many Antichrist out into the world so let's read that so you got that as well well I don't think I put that one in my notes so sorry I'm sorry I won't be able to pull that one up I thought I would I must've forgot my footnote on that one oh my so forgive me fast-forward are now 2000 years and now the false church is the greatest largest group in the world praise God right the Roman Catholic Church is the greatest church in the world right so see they went from having hardly any at all none 60 years having many and now it's almost worldwide the world the world of the field is almost all tears but thank God there's a little group in Akron praise God thank god there's a little group in Alabama praise the Lord there's a little group in Pennsylvania there's little groups and there's little patches of wheat and Jesus thinks so much of it he'll come back just for a little bit Jesus will glean just a little bit because he thinks so much of that wheat amen how do you judge the thing we got to do the Bible said be patient therefore unto the harvest see we get so impatient I want the Lord to come now every year well the Lord's gonna come in 2016 the Lord's gonna come in 2017 the Lord I get so tired of it after a while let's stop guessing the year let's just get ready praise God let's just stop guessing years let's just start saying the Lord sent me or lord help me to send some missionary lord help us to do something for your kingdom help us get the all the last seeds out there let's not guess that it let's do something about it praise God amen ah so this mustard mustard tree on the negative part of this parable is the Roman Catholic Church because she claims to be the mother church or the first false Church that rejected the leadership of the Holy Spirit now notice this great tree is a lodging of birds now many birds normally symbolize evil spirits right now there's one time I shared this with a friend recently and there's one time birds didn't represent evil and it was with Elijah when the crows came in fed a member that and I was that's the one time I can find in Scripture if anybody can find anything else let me know but it seems like every other group large group of birds always represents evil okay the first one was Genesis 15 10 11 we're not going to read they're just for time sake but Abraham God is God's showing him the unconditional covenant and he divides the beasts and all these birds this before he's put to sleep all the birds come down and brother Ram says that was Abraham driving away the evil spirits amen hallelujah and then later on in Genesis remember Joseph interpreted the dream of the the baker remember the Baker the Baker had all those birds eating the pie out of his head and Joseph interpret all those birds as death praise God and then revelation 18:2 says that this woman this Roman Catholic Church is a cage of every unclean and hateful bird right and so almost every time in Scripture other than this one time and like I said there could be more it seems as if birds oh there's another one in our other parable that we preached on last week remember the birds came down and snatched the seeds by the wayside remember that one so right there's five witnesses I just gave you five times whenever you see a bunch of birds it seems like it's the evil spirits Jesus called it Satan in that parable they snatched away the word swiftly out of the heart of the person okay so seeing this parable Jesus tells with the birds in this great great tree you know it could represent you know faith or the early church but most likely it represents the false church because that's how she's described in Revelation 18 verse 2 she's a habitation and the hold of every foul spirit and a cage of every unclean and hateful bird hallelujah God could not give a more brutal honest or scathing description of Rome could he then saying you're filled with every demonic power there ever could be my what a rebuke think about that church every kind of demon or bird lives in the Roman Catholic Church and its system right because she's the mother of what harlots she got daughters and the proof is ever before us is it not mine so see Church we gotta be mindful that be careful which church you visit amen in the message but also especially outside the message because if they are dot if they agree with Rome then they become a home of every evil spirit right because they do they partake of the same sins that the mother does that turn turn ad doctrine and pretty soon they open themselves up to all the other spirits right by it's just you got to be so careful because members Satan comes in like the white horse remember he comes in like a real small grain of mustard seed it's so small he wants you to miss it you won't just want you to let it slip on through but then it'll grow into something awful oh my goodness now in the book I'm the next book I'm putting this remember last year is about a year ago August 2018 all these abuse allegations came up in Pennsylvania over the course of the last 70 years 300 priests abused more than a thousand victims just in Pennsylvania and that's just what was reported it was a grand jury report including rapes whippings and abortions and then suicides all because of the evils in the Roman Catholic Church done through priests that's right and then I watched this video of a man from Pennsylvania that sadly experienced the abuse he said there's something wrong in the DNA of the church because it encourages a right season so even they recognize former members recognize there's something in grow wrong in other words they got the wrong seed you got the original seed the Word of God amen and the Word of God will not produce those kind of fruits big fancy buildings and beautiful outward but inwardly ravening wolves they got the wrong seed so it produces corrupt fruit we've got the right seat it produces the right fruit amen hallelujah see the DNA is wrong the heart of the core the word of the church is wrong of the Roman Catholic Church because it's built upon man's Creed's said the Word of God and then I read a report that said this is the timeline it went from Louisiana in 1985 a huge outbreak an exposure of the priests and then went to Austria in 1999 then I went to Boston in 2002 and see Church we forget about these things we hear time goes by and we just forget but thank goodness God is anointing some of these journalists to remember her evils and her crimes amen Ireland in 2009 a huge scandal against the Roman Catholic Church to Germany in 2010 Netherlands in 2011 Dominican Republic in 2014 Austrian 2017 and now Pennsylvania 2018 and that's just a few of them that ain't all of them I just took a few off the CNN report that's on CNN they reported that mine see wasn't just one state just one church it's a it's a global infection can I say like that it's not it's an infection it's kind of like Paul said the gangrene remember are those false preachers I'm a Gnaeus and philetus remember it's like gangrene they were preaching that the rapture has already happened right and Paul said it's like gangrene it's eating the people alive and that's what the evil in the Roman Catholic Church is it's eating them alive see they're getting eaten from the inside but we shouldn't be being eaten from the inside we should be growing from the inside amen we should be growing from the inside out not not eaten alive and not our confidence being destroyed in the preachers and our churches our confidence shouldn't be being eaten alive or destroyed our confidence should be growing and building because each one of us should be watering the seed of God with praise amen and then last year I saw a report where now the nuns are getting accused in Pennsylvania see don't stop with the priests it's infects the nuns do I mean it just it goes to the you know almost everyone's involved in other words it's just so awful now remember this word effeminate in the Bible a lot of people don't know what that means but that word effeminate in the Bible means child molesters it doesn't mean a man that looks dresses like a woman or has a high-pitched voice like a woman like some people think they just I don't know sure where they get that idea but the word the Bible said the effeminate will not inherit the kingdom of God if you look it up in the Greek it means a man who keeps a child for a sex slave that's what effeminate means so it says I doubters murderers whoremongers adulterers fornicators and then it says effeminate thieves all these will not inherit the kingdom of God so see the Bible lays a plane there that the effeminate will not inherit the kingdom of God see that's why we are a part of the kingdom of God because we let the little children come to Jesus see they route the little children of their NC but we pushed the children of Jesus to keep their Ennis II to get more holiness by the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen how did I yeah of course we know sin will always affect every person but I'm saying we don't Rob the children of their innocence we try to point them to keep their innocence and experience the love of Jesus Christ by honoring their body like the Bible says it's a temple the Holy Ghost praise God hallelujah in a man a real man or woman that's got the Holy Ghost won't beat and abuse their children they'll balance the scripture that says the rod trains the child right they won't take that too far because if they got the Holy Ghost then they got a teacher inside of them praise God and the Bible says they have need that no man teach you praise God on some of these things because the Holy Ghost is your teacher inside of you and you wouldn't mistreat one of these little ones remember the Bible says those that mistreat the little ones and teach them to do evil it's better it be better for them if a millstone was tied their neck and then throw it into the sea right then the mist each one of these little ones oh my mother's father's we ought to be so careful what we say to our children praise God we ought to teach though true to them and then live it before them praise God oh my see what it is it's a habitation of devils and I hate to have to preach those things but it's the gospel truth my it's a revelation so see many times church the group of birds represents spirits but when you have God his spirit is always represented by one bird the Dove amen I don't know yeah at Jesus baptism the Holy Ghost descended like a dove and abode upon him and remained on him empowering his earthly ministry praise God I love that the scripture says it abode on him so it came to dwell on him and it remained on him and he went about good I'm sorry went about doing good healing all that were sick praise God amen now let me give you a little bit dad about the Roman Catholic Church before I move on to the leaven one since I searched it out I'm gonna preach it to you praise God I invested a lot of hours in this and I think it's gonna help people I believe not here this is my vision for this next book the first book with a vision was a show was more of a outreach to people who don't know why we dressed the way we do and all started with that Verizon worker she's like she saw my girls I was getting a new iPhone 8 a few years ago she's like what your girls wear long skirts is that a religious belief and I was so blessed I'm like wow she's not condemning me she's being kind to me and that started the ball rolling for that book come like my if she wants to know I wish I and I tried to go back and give her a book which she was gone for she wouldn't you know she wasn't there anymore I would love to give her a free copy of that book I would but see now I got him in my car I got him in my backpack in case anybody wants when I could just push pass it right out push you to it so I'm ready now I learned my lesson I won't make that mistake again in other words I always have an answer I gave her an answer but I want to have more of an answer to give to her but my vision for this book is the Bible said the mystery of God must be finished revelation 10 7 and most people don't know that brother branham finished every mystery that's called a mystery in the New Testament most people don't know that and many of them church he gave us thus saith the Lord right he gave us thus saith the Lord about the Godhead and that's a mystery he said thus saith the Lord turned and turned him is of the devil he said those people are he said they can be saved but they're genuinely wrong he said it's time that they know they're wrong thank God we knew we were wrong hey bad idea thank God and there's other ones that were giving us like the mystery of iniquity like brother Ram preaches on the 4 horse riders and then he turns around and said who is this rider it's the Antichrist and then he ends the second seal by saying that's thus saith the Lord hey man oh yeah so many of these we've got thus saith the Lord on and my vision for this book is to be able to spread it to preachers and ministers people that will study and that they can see how brother Han taught any doctrine that's called a mystery God finished it for us so now we don't for scratch our heads and say I wonder what the mystery of iniquity is I wonder that what the mystery of godliness is I wonder what the mystery of the kingdom of heaven it is Amen I wonder what the mystery of Christ in you the hope of glory is is the like Billy Graham says do you get the Holy Ghost as soon as you repent is it like Oral Roberts as he says you just got to speak in tongues to get the Holy Ghost no it's like the Bible says when the when they were all in one Accord they were filled with the Holy Ghost and they began to speak in tongues and glorify God amen and everybody understood their tongue at that time amen see something emotional has to happen but as I said I don't care what form it comes in he said whether it's a tongue or a shout or a rejoice or a weeper a cry he says I don't care what form it comes in as long as something happens as long as the person's changed amen and then if you got the right spirit you'll live like it you won't live like a devil you won't go back in the world your only hunger and thirst for righteousness amen he said there's no certain evidence it's not everybody's got to speak in tongues or everybody's got a prophesy or everybody's got a scream or shout or cry you don't know what to do only God knows what you'll do when you get the Holy Ghost but one thing's for sure you'll know and you get the Holy Ghost a behead some will happen to you amen and people will think you're drunk praise God somebody will think you're drunk hallelujah thank the Lord amen now let me just go a few more data points here my so this this mustard seed a tree became the greatest among the herbs now the Pew Research Center there they're a research organization Catholics make up over 50% of the global Christian population over 50% so if you go around the world one out of every two Christians you meet will be Catholic of course we know they're not genuine meant most the time sometimes they are they can be saved as foolish version or they can come out of that and come into the revelation that we have which is gods were latest revelation one out of every two would say I'm Roman Catholic 36% are Protestant 11% as Orthodox with over 1.2 billion Catholics an ever growing number of abuse victims this third parable represents the Roman Catholic Church and not the true church that's because jesus said few there would be that find it praise God few there would be that find it that's the way I can see it by the grace of Lord because the Bible said iniquity would abound Jesus said because iniquity abound the love of many shall wax cold so see the church that's growing today is the false church in such great great numbers right we know it's gleaning time for the bride just a little here a little there small groups here and there and Jesus said he had to shorten the days in order that some Souls might be saved that's in Matthew 24 22 let's read that it's no no I don't think it's not a long time since we read that at least myself Matthew 24:22 and now emerge context of this Jesus only spoke Matthew 24 and 25 to his was Twelve Apostles I can't remember if Judas was gone at this point or not but anyways this was just amongst his preachers spoken amongst his preachers at the 24 22 and except those days should be shortened there should be no flesh saved so Jesus has to shorten the days just so somebody can get saved and brothers you know brother bless you know it we hear things all time oh great revival in this denomination great revival in that denomination come on come on who's really getting a revival to clean out all the trash of their life and they go on social media in their bikinis oh I'm saying I'm a Christian like all social media smoking a cigarette or a man just got back from the latest Marvel action film in which 50 million people died and he's rejoicing over all the death I'm sorry you took a demon demonic death spirit during that movie whether you knew it or not amen you're worshiping that right worshiping spider-man oh yeah a spider-man I got a spider spirit in your heart some demonic spirit in your heart it's worship but see he had a short in the days that some will be saved right that's Scripture but for the elects sake those days shall be shortened hey man thank God so see Church no matter what these revivals say I don't care what they say that's fine I mean I hope there's some people getting saved but the majority time there's gonna be fewer and fewer and fewer people being saved jesus said if you there be the founder it's because of iniquity it's because a license to sin right government's letting people send churches letting people sin because the license of sin iniquity of bounds and the love of Christ the real love of Jesus Christ in the word is getting smaller and smaller that's right and remember Paul prophesied the same thing let's read it in 2nd Timothy 3:13 2nd Timothy 3:13 Paul says the same thing so not only there's a Lord Jesus prophesy that Paul says the same same thing 2nd Timothy 3:13 now this is of course after this a beautiful chapter well for us where it shows the perilous times the last days verse one perilous times shall come and describes how there are lovers of pleasures more than lovers of God sees nothing they don't love God they have some love for God but it's covert of course is not a gap a love right it's just figlio love but the trouble is they love sin more than they love God but not so in our church we love God more than sin amen verse 13 but evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived amen see the preacher especially those mega preachers because they have the most influence right over worldwide audiences millions of millions of people tuned into them they have the most deceptive messages many times because Satan is using them not every time but many times Satan is using them to deceive the masses on the greater level right because they have access to tens of millions of people right hundred million people may watch them in a month's time or something like that so Satan sippin in false doctrine right and he's deceiving them he's saying all the positive things about the Bible but none of the curses all the blessings but none of the curses I'm sorry God don't work like that when God brought Israel in I just seen it in Deuteronomy 28 when God brought Israel in he made him confess the blessings but you better read your Bible remember he made them confess the curses - I know yeah in other words God's not it's just a prosperity gospel right he wants your soul to prosper and the only way for your soul to prosper is to get rid of all the unbelief from the doubt amen to get rid of all the sin they got Amen see evil seducers wax worse and worse deceiving and being deceived not like you know the famous the biggest one is that I'm not gonna say his name tonight sometimes I say it I'm not gonna say it tonight I try to do a better job on that I'm not against a person's character but I got a preach false doctrine so I got a preach against false doctrine sorry I don't preach false doctrine if I do correct me the Holy Spirit will correct me praise God but see though the main number one preacher he won't preach against homosexuality and he says it openly I won't preach against it but I'll ten headings of homosexuals in his church and they don't even know that they're they don't even know that he's sealing his fate if you don't repent of that because the Bible says the only way you rejoice over that is that you have a reprobate mind so that's Romans 1 the only way you wouldn't stand up against that is that your mind has been rejected by God so God's giving you over to a lie to believe the lie that God loves you and God loves your sin and God loves homosexuality well in one way you could say yeah he died he loved him so much to die for him but he doesn't love the fact that they reject the word right he doesn't love that and without repentance they won't be saved and neither will we all of us got to repent repent be baptized every one of you in that lovely name of the Lord Jesus Christ and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost see so with this prophecy the prophecy of waxing worse is getting worse and worse fewer and fewer being saved and you hear the 1 this week I'll just say his name I do pray for these guys after I preached many times the Holy Spirit will convict me I'll go down to the altar and pray for these mega preachers cuz if I all said pray for all men I don't know whose cross to line it looks like they've crossed a line but I don't know maybe God can say but this week did you hear but Benny Hinn he come out in the heat he denounces prosperity gospel and said it's wrong he said it's wrong all these years for him to ask for a thousand dollar offering now the sad part is it's shallow because if it was real repentance that man will give back all those millions of dollars because that's what Zacchaeus did right when Jesus said Zacchaeus come to your house today he said Lord I repent and if I've done anything wrong I'll give him back four times the amount now let's watch if Benny Hinn gives back all those millions of dollars I doubt it very much did you see the dateline on him years ago ten years ago they went and followed him for a while they went to the hotels he would spend many nights in a row in a hotel that cost ten thousand dollars a night ten thousand dollars and poor dying people are descending him $1,000 and he's pleading with him send me a thousand 75 thousand and now I always said at the end of his life now he wants to say it's wrong but the Bible said there must be fruits of repentance it's not just lip service amen see these many of these rich men like to honor God with their lips but their hearts are far from him amen and if we say we're wrong church we gotta just more than say it our behavior and our our repentance has to prove that we're done with the sin we can't say I'm done with this I'm done with this sin and then let and then you know look at the app again like let's say it's a bad app you've got delete the app and you got to keep every other app away that's got anything bad on it praise God you got a show to God and show to everyone how sincere you are yet to bring forth fruits of repentance so let's see if this so-called man of God mega preacher brings forth any fruits of repentance because he says he doesn't want to get a rebuke when he gets to heaven for all that money well I don't know about that and we know God's merciful but listen if there's no fruits for it then it doesn't any do any good but RAM says there's such a thing as thorough repentance right thorough means doing everything right right they're going to the one you did wrong against and confessing it and making it right to them now look he has a he has influence he has a huge influence millions of people he's got a Daily Show unless they cancelled I don't know maybe he's getting unpopular maybe they want a a rich young guy now are you rich young woman or something like that I don't know but millions of people look who Satan is using these millions of people they only tell the blessings and church a lot of those promises aren't even for them they're for us because we're the bride amen those preachers are preaching promises to them that don't even belong to them they belong to us amen and here we are struggling just to try to hang on and hold on and they're receiving it you'll get little blessings but see the rain falls on the just and the unjust amen so we got to accept God's Word we got to be overcomers speak God's Word and watch it move Mountain amen hallelujah praise God thank the Lord see that wax is worse and worse Jesus said fewer will be saved my my my my well let me find a place place too close here here let's do this let me close with a different thought I would just wanna I had this thought come to me right at the right before service I want to look at the evidence of the Holy Ghost one more time all right bear with me there it is all right now years ago I preached this little message called the way of holiness whereby man talks about the way of holiness and I studied it out every time brother Branham said the evidence for the Holy Ghost all right he called it many different things but let me read the church age book this let me read the exact quotes from the church age book the evidence of the Holy Ghost so see the false church will raise up raise up keep growing greater and greater that means the true church is gonna get smaller and smaller and smaller right because yes is shorten the time that some flesh will be saved so in other words the fruits of the Holy Spirit or the people with the real evidence of the Holy Ghost will be fewer and far between praise God that means we'll have a lot of people not just for us a lot of us around message churches if they're really not born again then they're just putting on a show now that's if they're pretending now hopefully there aren't they're on their way through saint saint vacation genuinely right hopefully they're on the right road justification st. vacation but what we see a lot with all these people falling away with believe the sign everything what we see a lot as a lot of people impersonating the evidence of the Holy Ghost that really don't have it they really don't have it so let me read you 10 direct quotes from the church age book we know the evidence that the Holy Ghost is being led into all truth because that's John 16:13 when the Holy Spirit comes he'll guide you into all truth Jesus says that is the evidence praise God see because when you're child of God you can be taught by your father yeah my children if they don't obey me then they're disobedient children but if they obey met my wife and I then they're really our children right they have to obey the real children of God obey daddy hey though I'm quoting now those who could receive the word he who can believe the word that's actually broken sisters I'm sorry that's broken cisterns but the madam said they angel Lord had to straighten them out and show them that the evidence of a ghost is those who could receive the word he who can believe the word all right now church age book page 140 the Holy Ghost is evidence is one taught the word by the Holy Ghost page 140 again the group that can and does hear what the Spirit is saying and receives the revelation thereof amen and ever Jesus said if you've got the revelation then it prevails against the gates of Hell so this proves it's person who's born again their lives will prevail over the sin of all the sin right in their lives it will prevail because revelation overcomes the council's of Hell that's right page 141 the evidence is hearing what the Spirit says page 143 the evidence is that we could have the teacher come and teach all truth we heard the word received it and live by it hey hey man Alleluia number six page 143 in every age the evidence was the same those who had the spirit the teacher heard the word and that spirit in them took the word and taught it revealed it to them and they were of the group that heard the messenger and his message and took and lived it see every time he quotes it it's saying the same thing the people that hear the word and live all the word number seven for the evidence is for the believer to receive the word for the age in which he lives that's page 155 number eight is page 157 if you are true seed if you're truly baptized with the Holy Ghost you will esteem his word above your necessary meat and yearn to live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God now many times for us that means fasting right testing this song that's that's my new joke right it means fasting we have to fast we have to esteem God's Word more important than a little meal than one trip to rallies now that used to be for me I don't do rallies anymore one trip to Olive Garden you have to steam the word above more the word more than our necessary meat praise God that's what it means for us we have to get closer to God by denying ourselves see we see it all the time people who overeat and I'm not criticizing anybody I'm not and at all but we see one of the lusts in America is gluttony and people stop fasting and so they don't consecrate to God and the Bible and Isaiah 58 tells many ways many blessings that come through fasting amen you know the Bible talks about prisoners being set free when we fast remember when we fasted for Christopher I called a fast for Jose's grandson Christopher that was years ago my we fast I think on two occasions he didn't get heal right away but he got healed in about three years after that hey man and Jose would come up here remember on Sunday he was crying because God answered his most recent prayer see we got it fast we have to seek and that's the evidence of the Holy Ghost is someone who's in the word fast things the part of the word prayers a part of the word giving alms is part of the word gifts are part of the word so if we're the bride we want all the word day man and you can't be the bride unless you have all the word that's why we need to live all the word page 169 he said the evidence is just the same as it was back in the day of our Lord and that comforting to know that meanness is the same in Jesus day as it is today it is receiving the word of truth for the day in which you live jesus never did stress the importance of the works as he did the word and that beautiful see after a while Jesus started preaching doctrine right the first fall miracles second pole he started prophesying against them and then his great big campaigns were dispersed right because he started saying you got to eat the flesh you eat my flesh and drink my blood he never explained it see he started emphasizing the word above miracles and that's when you started seeing the separation right that's when we saw the separation brother Branham in those days he started bringing the message serpent seed and holiness marriage and divorce water baptism the real Holy Ghost evidence and that's when you started seeing a great separation no more invitations lot less invitations it is receiving the word of truth for the day in which you live Jesus okay already read that he knew that if the people got the word the works would follow that is the Bible see because these signs follow them that believe if you're a believer these signs will follow you praise God now one encourage you I it's my testimony I believe I got the Holy Ghost in 2003 but I didn't start seeing a lot of miracles till 2010 I don't know if that's true for you brother West or not I I wish I would have seen him right away but for some reason it seemed like God just held him off and I was just learning the message and preaching I mean I was still pastor and everything like that but around 2010 I started seeing miracle after miracle after miracle after miracle so I know there's times and seasons with God praise the Lord there's times and seasons but if you're a believer these signs will follow you praise God put the word first always obey the word put the revelations of the message first because the message is the Bible every word brother Branham said it's the Bible the message is the Bible and the church said message does not brother Branham he preached the message cuz he preached the Bible praise God but that's the spirit we got a battle of the day that old Antichrist worship and brother Branham spirit my goodness verse i'm sorry/not verse quote number 10 page 273 in the church age but let's say in our feet a person that is truly baptized by the Holy Ghost into the body of Christ receiving the fullness of the Spirit will be in the word all the way now tell me how somebody going to be in the word all the way when they don't come to church all the time and the church said see that's the evidence you're in the word all the way see many message people they just preach they just go around the same thing God sent a prophet seals serpents eat around around instead of going to the rest of the word it's good we got to know those things how many thank God for those things every day I thank God for the word of God this message has changed my life but see the Holy Ghost wants us to go deeper into the Word of God because every mystery the moms of the mystery of God must be finished and that means going down in the mystery of God's will for your life right the mystery of God's will for my life going down to these mysteries that deal with us individually right and seeing where we stand with God because we know we've got to stand before Jesus and Jesus gonna say what did you do with the talents I gave you right what did you do with the poem that I gave you and we want to be faithful servants praise God and I hope that helps Malachi won't you come to the piano here does that help by God's grace see that fall Church I believe that parable no that's I could be wrong but I believe that that falls parable or that parable rather is about the false church because she grows up real great but at the end time the church is so small so small but this false church grows up so big in all the bird's nest on that and it's their habitation but what's the evidence of the true church she's in the word all the way she loves all the Word of God I mean of the Word of God tonight of course she did you come out on a Wednesday night some of you drove an hour somebody drove longer my goodness so we got a long drive home but the reality of it is you drive you drive anywhere we're for the Living Word of God because why you esteem it more than your necessary meat you could've went out to Applebee's tonight you could have went out to McDonald's and got some well I don't know if that's true meat or not it's probably you know GMO meat but you understand some of you like I didn't eat supper tonight I'm not bragging or they like that I'm just saying I have seen this word above my necessary meat but that's like brother Brahim said before meetings he would fast on a Friday you know breach to Saturday Sunday I try to model my life after the servant of God see if we want more of God we've got it the Word of God has to be higher esteemed in our lives we don't want to become placing right we don't become complacent we don't make I'm slothful we don't be soft we want to be faithful we want a hunger and thirst after righteousness let me stop right there you love the Lord tonight praise God let's just bow our heads for a word of Prayer I just felt led to kind of finish on that evidences and church Ollis let me read a few more with your heads bowed brother Ram said the evidence is sighing and crying for the abominations my we do that often here don't we the Holy Spirit will come upon me brother William and I'll just weep for the sins and a crew to drive nasties abortion clinics and these sports bars where they worship the Browns and they worship LeBron James I just got a holy seal for the Lord they know about this should be worshiping their Creator the one who's giving them breath Jesus so that's evidence I did cried he said the fruits of the spirit are an evidence will they they are because they're part of the word he said the Holy life is the evidence he said this is a desire to save souls of evidence that is it's part of the word he said when you're a dude with power numerical sense on that side and it is it's part of the word he said to my love is evidence he said believe for the truth is the evidence that's what the Holy Spirit brings believe the truth see Church everything in the word is part of the one evidence in other words all the word is revealed for our a Holy Ghost help we have to sign we have to pray too fast give up meals that they give money to the missionaries or money we gotta be faithful we got to be fully invested in all and that's been my heart since 2001 when I heard this message and I trust by God's grace it will always be my oyster [Music] Heavenly Father we thank you for your word we thank you for this word or God for these parables are to teach us about in this case and I've ever seen them the false church and when we ended with the true church evidence all the grace of God I destroyed we don't want to be going around in circles like Israel you want to go deeper the promised land hey you want to possess the gates are enemies hallelujah you want a door promised possession hallelujah our inheritance long before we go to heaven amen you want to see our spiritual heritage achieve it on the earth you'll be faithful as kings and priests now you send it your word rule over City place we're passing and interceding and giving to the pole praying for our brothers and sisters may we steam your word above
