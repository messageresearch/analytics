go to Romans chapter 13 I'll continue on this book of Romans series here it's part 28 by God's grace Romans chapter 13 verse1 Lord willing we may get through uh the chapter here tonight almost towards the end of this book by God's grace been a refreshing book God's word is so true as we saw uh Martin Luther was converted through this book Hallelujah John Wesley was converted through the book of Romans hallelujah hallelujah and God sent brother Braham to restore all these truths amen all the mysteries of God and numerous of them were in The Book of Romans Hallelujah so we're grateful for Amazing Grace Romans 13 verse one we'll just read verse one then we'll be seated by God's grace let's read that on three one two three let every soul Soul be subject unto the higher powers for there is no power but of god the powers that be are ordained of God Amen may God bless the reading of his word we may be seated praise God we're now in this sixth section here of the book of Romans we uh looked at uh chapter 12 on Sunday by God's grace the Christian Life and service according to CI scoffield and got through chapter 12 and Lord willing tonight we'll get through chapter 13 13 is about submission to authorities and how love fulfills the law Hallelujah then chapter 14 gets into U judging not one another apparently the Roman Church had issues judging one another and no doubt because you had half half of them were Jews and half of them were Gentiles the Jews were very uh legal minded right and then the the Gentiles they were just naturally more worldly and so of course you had uh you know one judging the other and so Paul has to bring a balance to this by the grace of God Amen and then chapter uh 15 is about Christ's example of service hope for Jews and Gentiles and Paul's Ministry praise God so we'll look at verse one here I'll just preach through this here by God's grace then at the end I there's is there's one more special prayer request I want to do at the end I have a uh I have a friend uh from my hometown uh he has is Ms and uh he's in Hospice now I think he's 30 we'll be let's see six years younger than me so he'd be 38 and he's lived a long life that's a long life with Ms um and his dad texted me and said can you come see him before he dies and I'm like well you know we got all this going on you know my wife's not feeling well got the bank situation you know with identity the so Lord willing I'll try to see him on Friday but I do want special prayer you know maybe we can all just pray for him um uh I was I went to bed crying on Sunday night you know thinking about this uh good friend and uh I just I hope God will just give me Grace so I can be there and make sure the man is saved you know he's a 38- year old man but he's been in a wheelchair since I since I've met him and he's just lost more and more control where he can't even talk anymore you know when I met him he could move his arms and his head and everything like that and now he can't move anything you know that's just the that's the nature of Ms so uh that's I want to remember to pray at the end and I've forgotten a couple times to pray at the end so brother Rod remind me or somebody remind me by God's grace I get thinking about the word and I just forget but that's a really important need there so uh Chapter 13 Verse one let every soul be subject under the higher powers for there is no power but of god the powers that be are ordained of God there's quite a lot in there I'm not going to get on all this but you can look at every example down through the Bible and in every example there was always a Believer but that believer was normally under the headship of a heathen ruler like we just saw Daniel a couple weeks ago and there's Daniel under Nebuchadnezzar right and Daniel had to submit to the law of the Babylonians right and then the mes and Persians but in each case where it it the laws you know went against his faith he cried out to God and he would ask for Mercy he'd ask for an exception in every case according to the word of God God granted his request because his one desire was I don't want to be defiled with the world praise God him and the three Hebrew children you know they uh they didn't want to be defiled and so I just love that if there was a desire to be pure God made a way for them to be pure Hallelujah remember in when Paul wrote this this was a time of Peace for Christians but the peace didn't last very long in Rome uh Scofield says this letter was written around 60 AD how many remember the name Nero the Roman Emperor Nero well in 64 ad uh on purpose he burnt down three quarters of Rome and blamed the Christians I don't know if you read that in history and he went they went through the city and martyred nearly every Christian and so uh you know in this case you know we have to look at the context of this so Paul must have wrote this in a time of Peace where Christians have had the Liberty to exist in Rome right let every soul be subject under the higher Powers there's no power of God but the powers that be are ordained of God so God ordained Nero right in the first century right God ordained Nebuchadnezzar in fact he calls Nebuchadnezzar my servant right he called Cyrus my servant right God will use them for God's purpose so we have this reality there's times where Christians have peace and there's times where they go they go through persecution and God allows both right each one is for a different kind of testimony remember there's two kinds of crowns there's a martyr's crown and there's a crown that you must strive for those who strive for the Mastery Hallelujah and so we must strive until persecution comes to us we must strive Hallelujah and as long as we have peace we must submit to the higher Powers the law right uh because God ordained this you know it's hard for us to imagine but God ordained the current president in there right now it's hard for us to imagine that right but if we go back a couple more you know with other ones it's hard to imagine how God allowed that but God did allow it it's all fitting into prophecy right this nation we know this nation is in Roman or Revelation 13 11 to18 this nation is the Beast that rose up out of the land not the sea not many people but out of the land North America right this and this this nation is going to be used to lay down the mark of the beast we don't know if it's in our lifetime or another lifetime but we can see it going that way look how they're persecuting uh the administration is persecuting the the leading opponent right you can you can search that's what Nero did Nero Nero murdered all his political opponents right and in the history of our nation we've never had the persecution with an opponent like it is right now and remember it's birth pains it's just going to get slowly worse and worse Jesus said it's birth pains all these things are birth pains right so we can see it going that way but God allowed this what is it bringing us to it's bringing us to a place of pressure where the Potter is applying pressure to the clay praise God we've got to be willing to uh praise God no matter what pressure comes way am I know God knows I need that hallelujah amen we all need that because we've had nice lives right we've had very peaceful lives for the most part but we can start to see things are changing slowly but surely and you know as the scripture says as long as the higher powers are in obedience to God then we should uh obey them now we know earlier you know in time you know around 34 ad right in the book of Acts we know as soon as you know the uh the the government arrested the Christians you know uh they said don't speak in the name of Jesus but we know they had to speak in the name of Jesus we know if a man if a man government says something against the word of God we'll take the word of God Amen so that must be understood within this context here Paul's not saying you know uh stop worshiping you know or stop praising God he's saying as long as the laws are align with uh Christianity obey them now it's interesting as you know maybe in Canada they're not allowed churches are not allowed to speak against spanking children did you know that so preachers have to make sure in Canada they could go to jail if they and this has been for years they've had this for years because I asked the brother about it they're like yeah you just got to wait till the live stream's off and you got to teach it in small small groups and don't you think they're going to send at some point don't you think they're going to send spies in there yeah so we have to understand this in light of uh in light of what government says we understand the pressure is coming down and so we got to be ready by God's grace Paul's going to say it later he said he said it's high time that we've slept let us wake unto righteousness Amen in other words we got to stir ourselves up praise God because we don't know what God will allow we got to be ready right we have to be ready for whatever God may allow and so Nero four years later as we said uh he he purposely B he created he created a disaster brother Nero created This Disaster himself and then he blame the Christians for it sounds a lot like our government right they create 911 and then they take rights away right they create January 6 and they do other things right political persecution the same thing same Spirit right it's that Roman Spirit hallelujah it's that iron Spirit right we can see it plainly and so this is and brother Ram says thus sayi the Lord the same persecution uh that that the the Pagan Rome put on the Christians will repeat in America and that's in Revelation 13 if you don't take the mark of the beast the Bible said they'll kill you right but thank God we're trusting we'll be out of here by God's grace that's according to Revelation 3:10 because you kept the word of my patience I will keep you from the hour of Temptation that will come upon the whole world Hallelujah that's a promise that we believe Hallelujah now Romans 13:2 whosoever therefore resists the power resists the ordinance of God so when a uh when a government is in obedience with God and you resist it you're actually resisting God right and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation Hallelujah so people today you know uh you know you you've seen it over the years I forget the name of that one group down there in Texas but there was this radical Christian group and they were uh speaking murder and all kinds of things and uh they were and they were eventually arrested and that was rightly so right they they don't have they don't have the freedom of speech to to want to kill people and murder people you can't say those things right that's rightly so so when people break the laws and they get punished that was the that was a just punishment in other words right so to resist the the the the laws that are acceptable to God is to resist God hallelujah now we can see it on things like we should be very honest with our taxes right we should very be very honest when we drive our cars Hallelujah we should be completely honest in those things right because if we resist the the laws of God as long or laws of man as long as they obey the laws of God if we resist that then there's going to be punishments for it Hallelujah verse three for rulers are not a terror to good works but to evil now again that's in context as long as the rulers are not evil right think of again think of uh the book of Acts wil thou then not be afraid of the power do that which is good and thou shalt have Praise of the same so in a peaceful government if you do what's right people will praise you right you have you have a good reputation good now verse four for he's the minister of God to thee for good this is when you have good leaders but if thou do that which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain or punishment right corporal punishment is what Paul's speaking of in the Roman civilization for he's the minister of God a Revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil wherefore you must needs be subject not only for wrath but also for conscience sakes you won't obey the laws of land so you don't get wrath God's wrath upon you right but also for your conscience so you have a good conscience I know I've kept the laws amen right I've kept the word of God also I've kept both Hallelujah laws of man laws of God right verse six for for this cause pay you tribute also so he's speaking of paying tribute to Rome or taxes to Rome for they are God's ministers attending continually upon this very thing verse seven render therefore to all their dues tribute to whom tribute is due custom to whom custom Fear To whom fear honor to him honor I'll never forget this one uh man man he was a preacher and he he was a Baptist preacher he found what he thought was a loophole not to pay taxes well guess what he he went around bragging around I have to pay taxes well he got arrested and spent about 15 or 20 years in jail right now that that's fine I mean I mean I guess I'll say like this you know he might have found something but like he should have known they're not going to let you get away with that it would have been better just to give them their their money that they want and have your freedom to preach the gospel and the Very Prime of his ministry lost it all in the very Prime of his ministry right he's still alive today every now and then I'll watch one of his videos I don't want to name him but that that's just something where you know uh uh someone thinks they see something but you better be careful it'd be better just to go with the flow Hallelujah right and keep just a couple a couple dollars right verse eight owe no man anything now of course this doesn't mean not to take out debts it doesn't mean that it just means you better pay pay your debts Hallelujah but to love one another for he that loveth another hath fulfilled the law so now we get into this uh section here on love this is how love this is how the love of Jesus Christ fulfills all the all the commands hallelujah amen this is it right here verse n for this Thou shalt not commit adultery Thou shalt not kill Thou shalt not steal Thou shalt not bear false witness Thou shalt not covet and if there be any other commandment it is briefly comprehended in this saying namely Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself this is how love keeps all the law of God Amen right because when you love when you love you never as we're going to hear in a few verses when you love God and love people you you'll do everything you can not to do them any ill will Hallelujah love keeps all the entire law so if I love God then I'll love his creation if I love his creation I won't commit adultery I won't kill his creation I won't steal I won't bear false witness I won't covet because I love God and I love God's people hallelujah verse 10 love worketh no ill to his neighbor therefore love is the fulfilling of the law Hallelujah that that's how you know uh the Bible also calls it Integrity right this is what aimik had right this is what Abraham had this is what job had Hallelujah Hezekiah had Integrity right when you when you're walk in Integrity you don't want to do anybody any wrong you just you wish the best for everybody Hallelujah and so this is the uh reality of Love Christian love within a peaceful government praise God and we have that for the most part now of course you know Church uh there are some states where it's it's just totally chaos right now like New York New York City and Chicago Philadelphia there's some places you might not want to go in Philadelphia right we talked about that there are some places you don't want to go because it's it's there there's uh violence crime uh people wandering the streets all kinds of things I mean uh the cops I just watched a video this week uh the cops passed somebody breaking into a business and didn't even stop him out in California just let him go uh you know it just this is the way some places are are coming right because there's no law there's no rule of law there's no consequence to the law the I'm talking about the natural law right and so when we walk by love we seek no ill to anyone we want to be pure in everyone's sight verse 11 and that knowing the time that now it is high time to wake awake out of sleep for now is our Salvation nearer than when we believed so this is quite a statement now now I just thought I didn't even catch this he wrote this just four years before Nero would bring persecution on Christians wake up in other words wake up make sure you're treating others the right way Hallelujah because the holy spirit is here is going to warn them it's time to wake up live pure live honest he's GNA he's going to say that a little later live honest before all men now this also calls to mind the parable of the 10 virgins right in Matthew 25 they were all sleeping but then there was a voice that said the bridegroom's coming go you out to meet him it woke them all up Hallelujah so it kind of gives this idea in every generation there comes a waking or a shaking to the generation I believe we're getting close to that by God's grace with this political we're getting closer to that I've never seen it like this right it's a shaking time Hallelujah God gave us four years of Peace you know from 2017 to 2020 kind of well kind of I guess Co was in there too right there was peace for Israel remember all the the peace treaties with isra is during those years economy was good everything was good now look what's happened these last four years just a little space of Grace right there right those four years so Paul is saying hey wake up we got to be spiritually awake our Salvation is nearer than when we believed right and and that's just logical that's common sense right the Rapture is sooner than it was last year Hallelujah whatever God whatever big move is coming with the tribulation or whatever rapture it's nearer than it ever has been we ought to wake up Hallelujah be awake and this is now this is in the context of doing good works of of being a A good rule following citizen by God's grace a law-abiding Christian citizen right verse 12 so I believe it's very applicable for today Hallelujah the night is far spent the day is at hand the dawning of a new day what's he talking about the day of the Lord the Millennium right now the day of the Lord is Armageddon and after Christ comes down now it's God's day but God has to destroy all his armies all the enemies the enemy armies rather and then a new day Dawns the Millennium Dawns Hallelujah so the the night is far spent Hallelujah the day is at hand in other words the Rapture and the millennium are at hand let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light let us put on the full armor of God hallelujah amen all the six pieces Hallelujah five of them are defensive one of them is offensive Hallelujah put on the armor of God remember this is the same thing he said in first Thessalonians 5 we are not children of the night we're Children of the day hallelujah hallelujah we are not children of Wrath God has promised us a pardon of Wrath right as far as the tribulation it's a pardon from the tribulation but just like those Christ down in Rome in Nero's Day sometimes God allows people to be persecuted and give their lives as Martyrs it's happening a lot in Kenya I saw some uh news about Kenya Christians being persecuted in Kenya right there I mean there's different places all around the world where people are being persecuted and so Paul's saying wake up God help us to wake up Hallelujah help us to put on the armor of light help us have on the full armor of God hallelujah verse 13 let us walk honestly as has in the day not in rioting and drunkenness now think about all the Riots of 2020 my goodness I'm glad we weren't a part of that Hallelujah and of course drunkenness we shouldn't get drunk I hope you haven't Hallelujah since you became a chrisan now chambering is sleeping around like fornication so don't don't Riot drunkenness uh fornication and adulteries and uh wanness which is lusciousness or lawlessness don't live a life like that not in Strife striving against people or envying other people hallelujah and so here Paul this is what he's telling the Christians living in Rome which was full of that I was reading some history and they had all these festivales to all their gods and these people would have parades it's just like today my goodness it's just like today where they have all their pride parades and all their sin parades and everything and they be up late nights and loud music and everything those Spirits don't die but thank God the Holy Spirit will never die Hallelujah one day the evil spirits will die Hallelujah but the Holy Ghost will never die Hallelujah and so Paul's saying now so see people in the church some of the Gentiles must have been kind of getting tempted by this because he said don't do this he said put on the armor of light put on the armor of God hallelujah remember in every church if it's a believing church sometimes you got wise and foolish virgins I talked to a preacher years ago and I I said brother I said H how come I said said brother is you know is everybody in your church born again he's like no I don't believe that I said well then what do you do well he said well I keep offering the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said but then I realize if they're a foolish virgin I just want to help them be the best Christian that they can be I thought that really blessed me that gave me a lot of wisdom in other words I can't force somebody I can't give the increase only God can give the increase I need more increase in my life amen we all need more increase in our lives Hallelujah that really help me right and that that scripture going back to Jesus's parable of the wise and voen virgins they were both together Hallelujah they both heard the cry amen they both heard wake up the bridegroom's coming Hallelujah the night's far spent the day is at hand put on the armor of light Hallelujah go you out to meet Jesus amen hallelujah so it makes it makes scriptural sense it fits all the scriptures Hallelujah that you know some foolish vergins might have been kind of tempted by these things and so Paul's got to say do not walk there walk an honest Life Walk in a life of Holiness and Purity putting on the armor of God hallelujah so out of these which ones will we be most tempted by probably by strife and envy right right if we're going to be tempted by some of these I I don't think any of you going to get on your riding gear and go out and try to join somebody in Minneapolis or something like that right no no we won't but by God's grace we won't find you down at the bar getting drunk but some of these things do enter in Strife right divisions envying you know wondering why this person has it better than we got it right we all battle I battle we all battle these things right it's Satan's job to fight us amen but we're more than conquerors in Christ Jesus amen we got to have a battle we got if we're going to be Overcomers we got to overcome something Hallelujah and this is the good memory verse I think it was was Eden chose this one or was it virtue but put you on the Lord Jesus Christ remember that memory verse one of the girls it was Eden God bless you Eden this is a memory verse a couple weeks back but put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ don't put on rioting gear don't put on drunkenness sleeping around uh lawlessness uh strife and envying other people put on the Lord Jesus Christ amen am and don't make a provision don't make a plan for the flesh to be satisfied right to fulfill the lust thereof don't plan it out don't plan out uh fulfilling any lust plan to stay pure amen plan for Purity amen hallelujah plan for the presence of God hallelujah amen let me just share this when I was a sinner and even when I first come in the message when I was a sinner in the message I W uh I would do most of my evil sins when I was locked in a room all by myself right I get out I get out the things that were evil in other words I knew they were evil right but I I I made a plan well this time I'll go do that so like one example when I was a teenager I had really uh bad things and so I'd go in the bathroom I'd been there for a long time and they'd be like come on I got to use the bathroom I'm like um I'm sick or my stomach hurts in order so I could sin like chewing tobacco or other things I'm not going to mention the details but worst details right and see and then even as a Believer you know the same thing too I remember when I first got saved I was still chewing tobacco and cam would be in the room and I tried to hide it like I wasn't chewing cam was a Christian you know I tried to hide it you know I try to do it when nobody was looking you know but here he says don't make provision for it now eventually by God's grace I got strong enough where I didn't do that anymore praise God and haven't for you know over two decades Hallelujah but that that's you know but that that was the characteristics of when I was a sinner or a new Christian I made plans to fulfill the lust thereof but now we should make plans to obey God's word hallelujah amen in other words we should make a plan last time I fell here how am I going to overcome it this time Hallelujah I'm going to pray more this time or I'm going to avoid that or I'm going to turn this off this time or you know we got to make plans for Purity Hallelujah make make make plans for Holiness praise God this is Paul's advice to the Saints in Rome Allelujah they saw the parades they saw the loud music the drunkenness the sleeping around they saw all these things but he said don't put that on put on Jesus Christ hallelujah amen put on the word hallelujah remember he said it back in chapter 10 the word you don't have to go up to heaven to get the word you have to go descend down to get the word he said the word is close to you it's nigh even in thy lips hallelujah amen so other words speak the word of God hallelujah hallelujah I shall not be afraid I shall not be moved amen I shall overcome amen by the blood of the lamb and the word of the testimony Hallelujah he is with me Hallelujah he'll never leave me he'll never forsake me hallelujah amen I've always set the Lord before my face as David said Hallelujah the Lord goes before me he's my re reward Hallelujah God is all around me he's the hither to God Amen Hallelujah if he's done it hither to he'll do it the rest of the way Hallelujah call recalling Brother Jim sermon amen put that on so Paul's saying don't put on these carnal things put on the word of God Amen and then of course this is in light of obeying man's commands and here now he starts getting into overcoming um the sin that was around the society that they lived around right I just read it I think of of it now you know even homosexuality was a big thing Nero married a man yeah he married a man and so Nero acted as the woman that's what history says at least the the web page I was reading just aw awful I mean this is such I thought this just like this just like this nation right just like this this this nation because it's the same Roman spirit it's still the legs of iron right we're down at the feet actually we're down at the feet now remember Church don't forget those 10 toes are the 10 tyrants or rulers that raised up during the Great Tribulation remember they give all their power unto the Beast for an hour remember that so I just want to on on that picture of the man remember so we're down here we're right by the feet right we're almost towards we're almost at the Great Tribulation period but we're not there yet right close see just give you idea where we are on that statue right it's from the time of Nebuchadnezzar here we are we're right at the feet my my goodness we're right at the feet it's it's a it's quite a shock here by God's grace so here and this this word was powerful amen this word was powerful enough for them to be arrested and then thrown in the Coliseum and then mocked and then fight animals and lions that's what the history says they were fed to Lions but they had this word amen they had a prophet thus sayith the Lord hallelujah and it was enough to overcome hallelujah praise God what they do they put on the Lord Jesus Christ amen one picture just showed all these Christians huddled around in the Coliseum and they're all just saying their last prayer as the lions come running at him and the Lions just tear him up but the last picture of them is just praying together huddled up like a bunch of lambs Hallelujah bunch of lambs huddled up and what was their testimony their testimony was we're not going to fight back we'll go see Jesus today I'll see Jesus Hallelujah in Paradise amen I'll be with Christ in Paradise Hallelujah now it's not the heart of the earth now it's in heaven Hallelujah chapter 14 verse1 him that is weak in faith receive ye but not to doubtful dispensations in other words uh don't argue with them dispute with them so this is an interesting point too my wife and I and I'm sure we talked about it over the years there's always going to be Christians that are stronger than others right that's why you have the wise and foolish virgins there's a scripture in Thessalonians uh it says support the feeble-minded right so that's going to be the wise virsion I'm sorry the foolish virgin is going to be the feeble minded and Paul had it in his church too let's look that up let's go to uh I think it's 1 Thessalonians 5 but I I'll find it support the feeble-minded you're always going to have some Christians uh that are in need of maybe more support yes 1 Thessalonians 5:14 there it is or they might be newer Christians or something but again church I've said I believe we have a very mature Church by God's grace because remember the Corinthian Church was suing one another right they had men sleeping with their stepmothers they they would get drunk before communion Hallelujah the church said Paul said remember I always read it for communion eat at home don't come together and get drunk at the Lord's table so so that's why I say by God's grace we're a mature Church Hallelujah we can handle the Deep things of God Amen do we want more of God of course do we need more of God I need way more Hallelujah we need way more but let's be thankful for what we got and reach out in the spirit for more hallelujah amen now uh 1 Thessalonians 5 yes 14 now we exhort you Brethren warn them that are unruly that's why we got to give warnings Comfort the feeble-minded support the weak be patient toward all men now that's faint-hearted Comfort the fainthearted now there's all times when we feel like there's there's times when all of us feel like fainting right like when these things happened to me I feel a thing in my stomach I'm like I feel like I I feel like this is GNA be a hard day I felt better by God's grace after going to the bank today or the the banker today but you know there there's times when we all feel faint like can I how long can I keep battling this how long does this have to go on right and we need God to give us Grace hallelujah amen but now let's look at the context here this is Comfort the fainthearted okay now let's go back to Romans 14 so here now in Romans 14:1 we see people that are weak in faith now Faith remember is Assurance or trust that's what the Greek means there's some people that have a difficult time trusting God right and we know that's what Satan's job is to make us doubt God's word right that's what he did with Eve that's what he did every time he tries to get the Believers to distrust God's word but that's why there's Services Hallelujah that's why there's preaching that's why there're singing amen that's why there's texting and calling your your loved ones amen your Saints Hallelujah that's why there's that we're to encourage one another praise God Amen when we need it so brother Austin you and I need to text each other a lot the next few days okay buddy let's send each other our favorite songs and just let's encourage each other by God's grace we're going to need it we're going to need it by God's I need it we got to do that Hallelujah but him that's weak in faith receive you but not to doubtful dispensation so don't receive people when they just want to dispute and argue we've all seen the difference there's a difference between somebody coming in and accusing somebody but then the the humility the difference is somebody's humble and says you know could you help me understand why this is that and that there's a big difference right so Paul's saying receive the person that's weak in faith or having a hard time I don't understand this could you really really struggle and I love you I really like to understand versus someone who's like oh you're a false you're not a real believer you're a liar you're a you're an impostor you're a Judas you're doing this and that there's a big difference amen hallelujah so he's saying those that are weak in faith receive unless they're in these disputations they're in the accusation mode and I've seen it and I don't like it right but we have to deal with it sometimes verse two for one believeth that he may eat all things another who is weak eateth herbs and now look in Paul's case they were disputing about what Christian should eat well I'm a vegetarian well I I eat both I'm an omnivore you know and this is one of the problems in Rome right you have Jews and you have Gentiles Jews had very strict dietary laws right Gentiles none verse three let him that eateth despise him not I'm sorry despise him that eateth not so let him not despise him and let not him which eateth not judge him that eateth for God hath received him Hallelujah so God received both God receives a vegetarian and God receives a meat eer verse four who art thou that judges another man's servant so now we get down to the bottom of this Paul says the problem here is people judging Christians judging each other right you're not living up to my standard you're not as holy as I am and it's a sinful attitude of judging another man's servant let's remember that we're all God's servants Hallelujah I'm not the boss of everybody I'm not I'm a I'm I'm supposed to be an example I'm not supposed to be the boss I'm an example Hallelujah a minister is supposed to be an example of a servant God help me hallelujah amen who art thou that judges another man's servant to his own Master he standeth or fth yay he shall be Holden up for God is able to make him stand Hallelujah God's going to help you stand Hallelujah God will help this person stand if he's got a different idea than you God will help both of you stand hallelujah we're not in other words we're not to judge and tear people down we're supposed to build people up Hallelujah in these areas of Christian Liberty now he's going to get into some areas mostly food and wine okay food and wine now of course this doesn't impact us very much you know under brother bram's Ministry brother Bram was very strict against drinking wine you know he would only do it in the the communion of the Saints in the church right now there is a liberty Paul says here there is a liberty to drink drink wine but he says do it just amongst yourself do it in your own home and don't cause other people to stumble we'll get to that here towards the end you can do that but be careful you might get drunk right and that would be a real shame right now remember those days were different too they didn't have clean cleaning water units like we got today their main drink was watered down wine right because the water was not clean they could easily get sick if they just drank straight water right that's why Jesus at the wedding that's why uh he he gave them wine he can give them even the best wine and but it it would be the cleanest wine it wouldn't be wine that would make them drunk God who is against drunkenness would not make people drunk It's a cleaned out water and wine mixture Hallelujah God will never contradict himself Hallelujah now oh yeah also we get holidays in here as well or holy days you have that Liberty in there as well verse five one man esteemeth one day above another another esteemeth every day alike let every man be fully persuaded in his own mind Hallelujah so we've tried to preach on that you know especially Christmas is the main example in the message you know uh in brother R's Ministry there's times brother ramam spoke really harsh against certain elements of Christmas but he always celebrated Christmas he gave his children gifts and they had a tree and everything but there's times brother R rakes people around the coals because they were worshiping those things right they talked about Santa Claus they lied to their kids and so if you if you take the balance up it makes perfect sense if you balance it Hallelujah in other words if you celebrate Christmas and all the focus is on Christ and we give gifts uh that that make us remember God's gift to us Jesus Christ there's nothing wrong with that praise God there's also nothing wrong wrong with going well it's December 25th I'm going to treat it like any other day I'm not going to give out gifts there's nothing wrong with that either the main thing is don't cause somebody else to stumble don't lead someone down into a path of sin Hallelujah that's the the main thing we get from the scripture Hallelujah let everybody be fully persuaded his mind isn't that something Paul says Paul says it's okay in a Christian Church that we're fully persuaded on opposite ideas and that that's exactly how it is with Christmas right some people are just fully persuaded I can do it the right way some people are fully persuaded I'm not even going to touch anything of it and Paul says that's okay whatever whatever you're fully persuaded by he said allow just just be persuaded Hallelujah as long as you don't sin amen what a what a message for some Jews and Gentiles amen now you know the Jews all the Jews would think oh it's Passover oh it's first fruits it's it's Pentecost it's Tabernacles we need to have this big Festival right and the Gentiles would be like you don't have to have all that and Paul's like okay let him right because remember even Paul he kept his vow and he went to Jerusalem and shaved his head remember when he kept The Vow there in the book of Acts and Paul's the one saying you can do that or not either way just be fully persuaded in your mind just love God because love fulfills all the law Hallelujah just don't judge others don't just don't exalt yourself be humble Hallelujah there it is amen don't judge another man's servant we're all Servants of God hallelujah we're not to be judges over others we're to be servants and encouragers of others Hallelujah now verse six he that regardeth the day regardeth it unto the Lord and He that regardeth not not the day to the Lord he doth not regard it he that eateth eateth to the Lord for he giveth God thanks and he that eateth not to the Lord he giveth I'm sorry he eateth not and giveth God thanks either way God gets thanked right how many thank God on Christmas right if if you're doing Christmas how many thank God on December 25th even if you're not doing Christmas right amen either way we thank God for a day hallelujah thank God for a life and health and All His blessings Hallelujah we give it all to the Lord so whether you eat meat or don't eat meat give thanks to God all time so the main idea is give thanks love one another do not judge one another encourage one another we see the mind of Christ here hallelujah verse seven for none of us liveth to himself and no man dieth to himself Hallelujah ain't that beautiful we all live and die to Christ how many living for Christ here hallelujah how many when you die if Lord willing if we die how many will die for Christ die to Christ Hallelujah we'll go to meet him Hallelujah that's why I'm living hallelujah we're all doing this for God whether we celebrate the holy day or not whether we eat meat or not whether we drink wine or not we're all doing it for God's Glory Hallelujah verse eight for whether we live we live unto the Lord whether we die we die unto the Lord whether we live therefore or die we are the Lords amen that's why Paul said for me to live is Christ to die it is gain Hallelujah cuz he gained Christ hallelujah amen Paul said when we're absent from the body we're present with the Lord hallelujah amen second Corinthians chapter 5 verse n for to this end Christ both died and Rose and revived see there's a one of the six kinds of Revival right as a resurrection that he might be Lord both of the dead and the living this is the very effect of the death and resurrection of Christ that he paid the price for everyone's sins sinner or Saint so he he redeemed all those people right and then they can choose they can accept his grace and be redeemed in their soul but he purchased their souls amen with his own blood Hallelujah and so all men have to come all men have to come and and bow before Christ and recognize that he purchased them amen and the Bible says you're bought with the price the precious blood of Jesus hallelujah amen verse 10 but why Dost thou judge thy brother so see there were some judg Jud going on the church right and I'm talking about sinful judging brother you're on the way you're brother you're on the way to hell you're not even a brother anymore you might be serpent seed sister you're a serpent seed because you eat meat or don't eat meat or you don't celebrate Passover or do celebrate Passover Hallelujah there's too much judging going on right why and so he says why do you judge them why Dost thou said it not thy brother for we shall all stand before the Judgment seat of Christ amen so see some people in the church were acting like they were judges but Paul says hey don't don't don't get caught up on that because you going to be judged too we've all got to stand before the Judgment seat of Christ I tell you that that that's a fearful thing sometimes you think about that I'm going to stand before Christ and the Bible said I'll give an account of what I've done in my life now church sometimes I have a hard time remember what I did yesterday if I had to give an account to Malachi what I did yesterday i' have to go look on my phone right what what did I have on the schedule yesterday but there some somehow when we when we when we come to the presence of Christ we'll be able to give account whether good or bad of our lives so we want to have given a good account hallelujah amen so the way to do that is not judge other people right serve God don't Lord over other people serve God do the best you can be fully persuaded that what you're doing is the word of God this is the way this is the way that we'll have a good conscience and when we give account of Our Lives to Christ we'll know we're doing it with all honesty Hallelujah and we know he'll receive us because he looks at our heart he Sayes does this person have the love of God or not are they trying to do good for everybody or they trying to do ill will towards other people hallelujah I love this verse 11 for it is written as I live sayith the Lord every knee shall bow to me and every tongue confess shall confess to God hallelujah every knee shall bow every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord of of course we know we better bow our knees right now Hallelujah that's why Paul said I bow my knees to the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ we bow now Hallelujah we worship now amen we confess him now praise God because we know if we don't we'll be forced to do it there we don't want to be forced to do at the white Throne judgment we want to do it now while we're alive hallelujah amen amen verse 12 so then every one of us shall give an account of himself before God now let's just review this one CA can you put up Luke 1233 real quick just a reminder here just a reminder you know one thing in America we have to give account of is our finances just a reminder now Jesus plainly tells us how to get treasure in heaven sell that you have and give alms provide yourselves bags which wax not old a treasure in the heavens that faileth not where no Thief approaches neither moth corrupt so other words giving God loves a cheerful Giver Hallelujah so Jesus plainly tells us when we give to others that can't pay us back that Soares up a treasure in heaven and that will not fail hallelujah amen so we want that we want to have that in our account in heaven Hallelujah right we want to have it recorded because we're in a given an account the Lord will say what' you do with your money what' you do with your time may we saw it on on uh we saw it on Sunday I gave you these talents I gave you this money what' you invested in right I gave you the ability uh to have words of wisdom or words of knowledge right all the nine gifts of the holy spirit I gave you ability to preach I gave you the ability to sing or Gifts of healing I gave you these gifts what' you do with them oh God we got to give an account hallelujah amen oh it's it's a striking thing so Paul says don't judge others in these areas of Liberty because you're all going to stand before Christ and give an account of what you did in the body this is a sobering chapter every one of us will give an account of himself before God pull uh Matthew uh 25 19 and 20 of course this is the parable that uh the talents as we mentioned on uh Sunday after a long time the Lord of those servants cometh and reckon with them so here's where Jesus is going to reckon with us what' you do with what I gave you here's the account now look look at the confidence of this man and so he that received five talents came and brought the other five saying Lord thou deliver me unto me five talents and behold I've gained beside them five talents more here's a man that's ready to give his account hallelujah amen in other words what I'm saying there's 45 minutes I'll try to finish up here what I'm saying is we should have some idea what do we do with our money right how much did we give to the poor right how much did we invest in our gifts in our lives what did we do what what do we try to do for God hallelujah we should have an idea of what we gave to God because we're going to give an account Hallelujah this is also related of course accountability that's where we get the word from right accountability how many like accountability right accountability somebody gives you something well I'm gonna come back and get it or I'm let you borrow this they're going to come back and get it aren't they you're going to be accountable what' you do with this right uh like oh I let my neighbor borrow my lawnmower well there's accountability what do you do with my lawnmower right what did I do with his lawm more what did I do with his ladder he let me borrow his ladder what do I do with it I got I got to be accountable for it I want to say I used it and here it is it's in better condition than when you gave it to me right like if we ever move out of this place we'll have to give an account now if the Lord terries right and and even the landlord has already said you guys have made this way more beautiful than it was you've uh so we we have the we we have the the account we've we've we've invested in this and this is better off because we were here praise God that's just the natural amen what about spiritual we should try to make people's lives better spiritually because they were in contact with us hallelujah amen hallelujah let verse 13 let us not therefore judge one another anymore so he says stop all this judging now talk about a church right there talk about a church where people were judging others oh you're you're condemned because you ate that you're condemned because you drank that you're condemned because you you didn't worship on the day like I did they're judging each other Paul says let's not judge anymore stop judging he says but judge this so here here's here's something you can judge each other on here's where you can go around and and judge each other that no man put a stumbling block or an occasion to fall in his brother's way that's how you should judge each other in other words go I go to Brother house brother have I called caus you to stumble in anything right sister Zur have I caused you to stumble sister n me have I caused you to stumble Casa have I caused you to stumble that's the judging God wants us to do hallelujah amen to live so pure before each other that we don't condemn each other but we go and say judge me right uh let me know have I caused you to stumble this is the kind of church God wants Hallelujah I believe it's what we got Hallelujah by God's grace I'm just so you know I'm not blasting the church tonight I'm just I'm letting you know what the gospel says right and we've lived it by God's grace amen hallelujah we've lived it so let us judge that I'm not going to cause somebody to stumble now the obvious example I've named this one about a thousand times in the last few few few weeks Peter in Galatians Chapter 2 everybody think everybody remember that stumbling block he he told Barnabas and these other Jews we're not going to eat with the Gentiles because I fear these other Jewish teachers and he taught the church to separate themselves what he do he caused them to stumble over what food just like Paul said amen Holiness we're more holy because we're Jews and we have the 613 laws and we have all this background information on Moses's law but Peter put a stumbling block in the people's way and caus them to stumble but we know by history of course he repented but it took a prophet to walk up and put his finger under his nose in front of everybody said you're the one to be blamed now could we accept that kind of rebuke if God did that to us that take a real man of God but you know Peter was used to it Peter was humble he was a humble man Hallelujah because he'd been humbled right he said Lord I'll never leave you I'll die with you and within a few hours he denied him three times and he wept his he bitterly wept after the the cck crowed Hallelujah he bitterly wept and then Jesus Jus asked him do you love me Peter do you love me more than these do you love me he said thou knowest he said feed my sheep preach the word of God be an example be a servant serve God's sheep Hallelujah so if he could accept that rebuke from Jesus surely he could accept it from Paul Hallelujah so that's the only judging we should do in here judge ourselves brother amen have I offended you in any way brother that's that's how we should judge each other Hallelujah let's have that kind of judgment amen be so pure think about that we'd be so pure that we could s go up to one another after service and say you know brother brother Malachi did I you know did did I offend you in any way that's Purity right that's that's trying to get others to be encouraged not to cause them to stumble Hallelujah now there's certain stumbling that we won't do the Bible said let the blind lead the blind Jesus said that there's certain stumbling they'll do but Paul's talking about stumbling in the Christian church between wise and foolish virgins and no doubt how how many believe uh Peter was a wise virgin if anybody was a wise virgin he had the Holy Ghost he's a spokesman on the day of Pentecost he had the keys to the kingdom he opened the door to the Jews Samaritans and the Gentiles in cornelius's house all three human groups he opened them up to but then he stumbled here in Galatians Chapter 2 was God done with him did God throw him away no sir Hallelujah he's one of those he's one of those elders ERS on the 24 Thrones in heaven Hallelujah the four and 20 Elders amen the 12 apostles and then of course not Judas somebody took his place either Paul or Mias and you have the 12 sons of Jacob amen he's still one of those amen he still surrounds the Throne of God hallelujah am that's amazing grace amen that's the kind of Grace I believe in right there thank you Jesus amen if I call somebody to stumble I know there's Grace to forgive me hallelujah amen amen if I seek it and if I Repent just like Peter did hallelujah what a scripture my so this is what we got to judge Lord help me not to cause somebody to stumble verse 14 I know and am persuaded by the Lord Jesus that there's nothing unclean of itself but to him that is seeth anything to be unclean to him it's unclean now he's going back to Food and Wine but If thy brother be griev with thy meat now walst thou not charitably destroy not him with thy meat for whom Christ dith okay so Paul Paul must have heard about somebody in the church a young Christian saw a more mature Christian eating meat and that meat was probably sold in the market by a sinner who had sacrificed that animal to their Idol that's what this context is Right Wendy Wendy talked about that you know she'd seen in her country and and things she'd seen where the they they lay the meat before their Idols the Hindu and all kinds of Idols that they have and then they would eat that people would have parties there in Hong Kong and they actually sacrificed for uh their gods like that was something she saw she witnessed it okay but here Paul sees it in Rome and he says if a Christian can buy the meat and it doesn't matter it doesn't cause him to stumble it's just meat I don't worship those Gods it's just a piece it's just a slab of meat but if a young Christian looks at that says he's eating meat to a sacrifice Idol and Paul says don't eat it right care about your brother if you do something that Grieves somebody and they get weaker he said leave it alone and don't do it Hallelujah now you again you'll know the difference between somebody who's an accuser a critical spirit versus somebody who's just weak in faith or faint-hearted and the church said you can always tell the accusers is always prideful and uh they're not humble but per someone who's weak in faith or fainthearted they're humble they're still loving right Hallelujah destroy not him with that meat whom Christ died Hallelujah for whom Christ died verse 16 let not then your good be evil spoken of for the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink but righteousness peace and joy and the Holy Ghost so Paul says both sides right you can look at both sides right don't destroy somebody but also don't let your good be evil spoken of so you have a right if you're the one eating meat you have a right to say brother this doesn't offend me I pray over this I got Paul's other letter that says I give Thanksgiving for this amen every creature of God is to be received with Thanksgiving but then a mature Christian he goes on to say a mature Christian won't do it in front of the the younger Christian right that's what this is all about keeping your brother strong keeping your sister strong right so you got to right in verse 16 you got to right to stand up and say you know this brother sister I'm sorry this Grieves you but this doesn't grieve me I understand it God made the meat right the meat doesn't defile a man it's what comes out of a heart that defiles a man right but if this hurt you I'm not going to do it verse 17 for the kingdom of God is not in meat and drink but righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Ghost hallelujah amen all three of those amen I love that what a what a trio hallelujah it's like faith hope and charity Hallelujah but it's a it's a Rome a Rome version Hallelujah he he told the Corinthians faith hope and charity here he says righteousness peace and joy and the Holy Ghost amen I like that for he that is that in these things serveth Christ is acceptable to God and approved of men so this is now called serving Christ when you keep yourself from doing something you'd like to do but you you do it just to help out your brother now that's called serving Christ so when I have to sacrifice just so I don't cause my brother or sister to stumble that's a Ser that's a servant's heart right there right now I'm now I'm serving Christ and as you'll see in the next chapter that's what Christ did Christ forsook everything in order to serve us he had a right to be married he had a right to live long he had all these rights but he forsook all of his rights that he might serve us hallelujah and so we must follow his example praise God Glory verse 19 let us therefore follow after the things which make for peace the things wherewith one may edify one another so see it's all about building each other up not grieving or offending others but building them up verse 20 for meat destroy not the work of God see meat eating meat's not going to destroy the kingdom of God all things indeed are pure but it's evil for that man who eateth with offense so if that man who eats meat he knows about this offense and if he still eats it says I don't care what that baby Christian says then that's an offense to Christ all right I'm trying to think of a way it applies to us you know I guess the closest one is probably Christmas right I can't really think of any others that would be like a real controversial thing I can't think can you think of any brother amen what are some Christian Liberties I yeah I think with you know women's clothing Sometimes some people go really far on that like we talked about with the toes showing toes and uh wearing jean skirts and things like that that would probably be something later but we don't have any we don't have any interactions with that we just hear about that all right now verse 20 for meat destroy not the work of God all things endured to are pure but it's evil for that man who e with offense so if we offending somebody and we still we know we're offending them and we still do it it's evil that's evil verse 21 it is good neither to eat flesh nor drink wine nor anything whereby thy brother stumbleth or is offended or is made weak Hallelujah so everything we should do should edify other people should encourage other people amen verse 22 hast thou faith faith have it to thyself before God so now let's go back to the meat and the wine and everything else if you do that just do it with you and God in the privacy of your home right something's going to cause you to stumble just do it in the privacy of your home so I guess how it may apply to Christmas if I know somebody doesn't worship or was doesn't celebrate Christmas I'm not going to go in there in church and give them Christmas gifts all right maybe that's one a good example I'm not going to go in there and say Merry Christmas Merry Christmas I'm just going to be careful what I say around them if they don't want to celebrate Christmas Yeah Christmas cards got to watch everything no gift cards you know don't give anything don't talk about it just have peace just edify them oh a wonderful service and praise God hope you enjoy the weekend and have a wonderful week in the Lord I've been thinking about you you know just keep everything off of something that might cause somebody to stumble Hallelujah uh verse 20 oh yeah we are 22 okay finish up 23 and he that douth is damned if he eats because he eateth not of faith for whatsoever not of faith is sin what a great rule that is for us right that's a good uh that's a good scripture we should use for all of our lives do I re and and I've said it before but if there's a question about it we want to leave it alone until we're sure right because we have any doubt in our mind the Bible said it's sin I'm not sure if this is right or this is wrong now one area that's been uh working on me the last few years is with music that's why I preached on it I wonder brother awesome I thought is this right or wrong to listen to this amen I thought should I listen to this or not you but God's giv me Grace now where I can understand like I've told Malachi we can listen to some songs but if we played it like that in the church it wouldn't be right right in the church we just want everything as holy as it can possibly be in other words if anything's kind in the middle we're not even going to do that it like that in the church we're just going to keep it totally clean Hallelujah right because there that there's another one I just thought music is an area of Liberty too that's right amen all right see that just comes as I'm preaching but I'm going to close I'm not going to keep going okay I'm not going to catch the Revelation now and go with it but you you understand there's areas of Liberty now jewry one I wrote that book where's my book I just go through the areas of Liberty like with rings you know Joseph and morai had rings on and there are these people that say Christians shouldn't wear Rings well then you're condemning morai and Joseph for wearing rings it goes back to your why are you doing it what's your objective what's your motive behind it like even that scripture about plating the Hair Braiding the hair you you'd be surprised how many people from Africa email me about that it's honest question but you have to look at the context I mean anyone looks like looks at a girl like a let's say a 10-year-old girl with a braid at nighttime you know that's not sinful like you just have the common sense she just don't want her hair getting all tangled up at night I mean right but if you look at the context he's talking about people that are spending lavishly on gold and and costly array in other words spending a lot of money on fancy worldly hairstyles wasting money that's the context a braid is not a sin right it's an area of Liberty if you I mean any Common Sense the reason people condemn it is because the uh it's Pro it's probably men that don't have long hair that doesn't get messed up at night time you don't get all entangled and everything like that they have to do that the girls have to do that in order to keep their hair from breaking and tangling and everything so it's these areas of Liberty that we have to have even Joseph had a necklace the Bible said Pharaoh gave him a necklace well if you condemn necklaces on men then Joseph is condemned if there's a purpose for it there's got to be a purpose for it Hallelujah a Godly purpose amen right all these areas and so God gives us this final word here at this chapter for whatsoever is Faith is not I'm sorry whatsoever is not a faith is sin so let's make sure all of our decisions are rooted and grounded in our faith our Revelation and we do everything we can to edify one another and not to judge one another musicians can come let's stand to our feet here praise God how many enjoy the word of God tonight amen amen good scriptures like I said I felt like we've been a mature Church we've we haven't judged one another we haven't done some of these things like the Corinthians did by the grace of God that's how I know we're a mature Church Hallelujah we look at the word of God we live the word of God another good example is that flat top haircut you know I preached on that a few weeks ago 10 times brother Ram said oh they got their flat top hair haircuts then they ask him brother Brandon is a flat top haircut wrong he said no he said I just say that he said there's no scripture against a flat top he said brother you live as you live to be 56 like me you'll have a flat top you'll have no hair I love that joke you'll have a flat to all your hair is GNA fall out Hallelujah so Church what does it take it takes the love of Christ how many want more love in their lives how many want to wake up from any Slumber Hallelujah and just be alert with the full armor of God what what amazing chapters these are how they apply to us as persecution was coming on in four years now think about that at some point there's going to be a number of years before the persecution hits the us we're starting to see it where they're like I said they're putting them they're doing kangaroo courts is what they're doing against their political enemies we're starting to get there and so God help us to recognize what time it is hallelujah put on the armor of God let's bow our heads for a word of prayer father God we thank you for tonight Lord God we thank you for the word of God what a beautiful chapter you've given us through St Paul Lord as Peter said holy men of old were moved by the Holy Ghost hallelujah thank you God for moving your men to write the word of God and give us these wonderful Revelations I thank you Lord for the kingdom of God in our church it's righteousness joy and peace Lord I preached it last year that we've had this wonderful season of Peace since 2018 Lord God hallelujah six wonderful years Lord of Peace haven't had to deal with the critical Spirits Lord we thank you for that God thank you for your mercy and Grace Lord and that's what we've been trying to we've been trying to edify one another here Lord God yes Lord may we do like Paul said judge this may we judge whether we're causing people to stumble or building them up Lord God let us judge ourselves as Jesus said judge yourselves lest you be judged Hallelujah Lord I look at our church and I don't see in my perspective I don't see people causing others to stumble Lord God so Lord our desire tonight Lord is to always have faith in everything that we allow in our lives these areas of Liberty Lord God lord you receive someone who eats meat you receive someone who doesn't you receive one who celebrates certain elements of Christmas like brother brandom and you receive those who don't you receive them Lord God you just want them fully persuaded hallelujah thank you Jesus Lord let us be awake Lord for the night is far spent Lord we see this birth pain of political persecution Lord and for me it is so hard to see this nation fall so fast dear God I weep over it Lord God I cry out to you Lord have mercy Lord God strengthen your people Lord God help us Lord to put on the full armor of God hallelujah we thank you Lord for the ministry of the word of God hallelujah thank you for the ministry of the Holy Spirit Lord in this hour Lord God showing us we're a part of the kingdom of God and may we do all in our power Lord God to edify one another in love we thank you for this opportunity Lord to hear your word now let us apply it Lord as we as we looked at that scripture God may we lay up treasure where it cannot be corrupted it cannot be taken away Lord God let us lay up treasure in heaven Lord God one day we know we'll give an account Lord and we want to do it with joy Lord God we want to have the the response ready well Lord you gave me this but Lord here's what I've tried to do with it Lord God you gave me this little preaching gift and I tried to do this with it Lord God hallelujah you gave me this little gift to
