[Music] [Music] sisters many years known brother Jessie I'll tell you what I was quite content to stay right behind his ministers oh sure nice place the grace of God yes yes sir in our area Lord God do some very how'd I do you know I might am I just sing a song I heard some very wonderful song specials god bless each and every one of them I think I usually sing just a little song you get get the nerves out of the way and then we'll get right over to to where we feel led to go today men I think I must sing a song my time to the message if we get there try not to be tremendously long today but my try sing that song if I can we are climbing Jacob's Ladder we are climbing Jacob's letter we are climbing Jacob's Ladder we are climbing Jacob's Ladder soldiers uh-oh Oh every round goes higher and higher for every round goes higher and higher every round goes higher higher soldiers of the orange for every victory is sweeter and sweeter every victory it's sweeter and sweeter victory gets sweeter sweeter soldiers of the cross oh ha oh yes now sinner do you love my son [Applause] [Music] see if we can get this thing started up [Music] okay let's see if we can put this up here go to Revelation six five you have your Bibles there we go praise the Living God you know sometimes that don't go through so when it does go through just makes you wanna rejoice all the more just trying to limit down some sermons a pastor that church over Napoleon but by the grace of God you preach a lot of sermons you just try to find God's mind I believe this would be a great blessing to you cuz a brother sister or one thing about it all is that when you when you see that the message is so tied in with the Word of God but there's nothing like it we see people nowadays though they'll run out of the message amen and and and a lot of people look at a prophet they look at this though and then perhaps just look at a quote but you see they never come to a place that they realize that the message and the word all those go together just right amen so today we want to just kind of bring a thought to you maybe inspire you a little bit if God would allow and we'll see I'm an inspirational preacher I've had a brother say one time he said I heard you were a nervous emotional preacher and didn't know how to quite feel about that too hadn't run the quote yet but I found brother Branham one time say he was a nervous emotional preacher so I kind of felt good about that after that but anyway I we just take what the Lord will give us and we just try to just allow the Holy Spirit to speak to his bride Amen brother says to remember it was his blood that purchased you oh what a great Savior we have amen so here I preached 50 sermons at the home church on the on the on the seals and pertaining to those things and we're gonna try to Bunch maybe four sermons into one here and maybe we're just moving into tonight if we can but I believe will be a blessing to you in Revelation six five you have your Bibles here if not we got it up on the screen up here it says here it says when he had opened the third seal I heard the third beast say come and see and I beheld and lo a black horse and he that sat on him had a pair of balances in his hand remember who that rider was that old stinkin devil and they mem and I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts say a measure of wheat for a penny and three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the wine all right so I want to bring our attention to this as we get ready to pray who is your all in all this morning who is the one in the middle of your experience today who is the one that's going to see you to this rapture it's the Lord Jesus Christ now isn't he amen so notice as your prophet brought this who was that voice I heard a voice in the midst of the four beasts in the midst means middle before beasts protecting that lamb amen so it was the lamb speaking to his little church there wasn't it amen let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer we'll get right into this our most beloved Lord Jesus Christ Saviour God friend everything to us Lord here we have Oh God knowing that Lord there's not one of us even worthy to be in this room Oh God we're the elect would be found but yet Lord God you had predestinated us from the foundation of the world you O God we heard your voice and Lord we come after that oh god you truest God thank you Lord for in this our Lord as we see the challenges of the hour raising up against the world against the church against all who call themselves by the name of Christ then Lord you've given us onward oh god that would prevail over anything that the devil could bring Lord we're trusting today Lord that as we've read this scripture you'd add your blessings to it Lord and/or not just that but Lord as we hear the word of God may Oh God that word just settle deep in our lives God bring forth a little change in our lives our perspectives Oh God as so many times we see ourselves bound up Oh God thinking that we don't have a chance or maybe maybe we were just sitting there beaten up and bruised gone but Lord we have a word today that is greater than any challenge that this world could bring us O God we pray O God put us in thy word put us in a place oh god that this word is a greater than anything that seats before so gone we believe that you'll do it Lord and we're asking Lord he is certainly inspired Lord maybe Oh God we believe it as we move ourselves out of the way they oh you would come in the midst of this assembly we know by the very promise of your word that we're two or more gathered you say there you will be Lord so we realize right now that you're here right amongst just little common people here you are we were should be so we love you we ask you to have your preeminent way today in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the church said together they may be seated you don't happen to have a lapel D brother [Music] let's keep one my hand still today we're going to minister a little message called an oil and wine experience and maybe we'll just reach reach recap just a few things we'll get right into this remember brother sister the opening of the seals made this a new book to you it was the opening of the seals that was that God would begin to unravel the fullness of who he was to his church right amen he would take all those things that the Reformers and all these other men of God had probed at and what he would bring it to a place that what the entire word would be open to the church right and they meant as we see that God would anoint these things to start breaking forth to the believer we understand that their prophet would spend a night after night after night breaking these seals by the power of the Holy Ghost to the church amen now those sermons were actually preached brother sister to revolutionize your experience amen they were actually to turn your walk from a place of being a probing experience into an experience that would actually have a life Amen for very life of Jesus Christ expressing from it Amen hallelujah that no matter where you attorne you would find until the consummation or coming of Christ that God would be right drawling you closer and closer to a word experience that would see this coming of the Lord in it hallelujah so now we want to take this little idea of course in the white horse that devil he came in so subtle and then what then very carefully and very quickly he began to dismantle that little that little Ephesus church now didn't hear right amen and then whoa then he annexed this Antichrist she'd begin another move and he would begin as a red horse and he begin to kill the true Church of the Living God right amen I know your pastors preach on these things so we don't want to go too much but you know it ain't a crime brother sister to go back and get into the archives of your pastor sermons right amen so maybe it'll help there a little bit - amen he's a real man of God amen so now notice here that that second horse rider he would begin watch through them the move of Catholicism in the false word he began to destroy the true trail children of God right and little by little what that true church would be coming to a death right under you get all the way in the fourth seal there and you'd find that one yes was sitting in it with a pale horse but right before we see in that fourth church age the church coming to a nine hundred years of death right we would find that God he only did it so he could show a jet burial and a resurrection to the church right hallelujah so we see that here in the third seal that what we see that what God would allow this black horse rider bringing spiritual death he'd be selling endorses and pendants and all these things like that and what you'd begin to what bring an end to the sons of God killing them off remember what makes this so amazing brother sister they didn't even have the Word of God the Bible had been wanted moved by Catholicism into Jerome's Latin Vulgate a dead language they put the Bible in a dead language so that the common people couldn't even read the Word of God brother sister of that alone or to inspire us this morning hallelujah as we get our Bibles and we wipe off the the six day seven day dust you'll next Sunday service Omaha those people long for the Word of God hallelujah and they couldn't get it right because they've been brought into the dead movement of Catholicism but what we see that in the midst of that remember the promises at for Church ages that said that what it would be greater the works would be greater at the last and in the first OMA and we see what would begin to go on now I'm going to tie this in with a Bible by God's grace if we can I want us to tie that right back in in Revelation six it's now notice here that it was God's commandment here though that black horse rider would ride God restrained him you can't kill my children now I want you to think about this because brother sister there has never been a time in the Gentile dispensation that the church has been left without the oil and the line you know why it's not me that stopped it's not him after any of you that stop it it was Jesus Christ himself and when Satan tried to take it away Jesus Christ said oh no you don't there was a voice in the midst of the force four beasts that said a measure of wheat for a penny of three measures of barley for a penny and see thou hurt not the oil and the line it is been God's covenant to his charge Amen that they do not have to live in experience without the oil and law Satan tries to trick you he tries to keep you from it but brother sister if you watch this then you can have it I guess we better get in and define these things a little bit to see how important this really is to us now we know I'm not going to spend a lot of time here because we all know what the oil is right but the oil is what the oil is a type of the Holy Ghost Satan has never been allowed to touch your Holy Ghost remember your prophet said he can never go in there if he did he'd be called your brother he can't go into the place not his place you neither Kenny hinder the oil from being at the prominent position of your experience hallelujah isn't that something brother sister we don't have to sit here in this lay back and say all I wish I had it I wish I could have it remember Jesus told that devil see thou hurt not so the only thing you can come and do is come and Bluff you hallelujah brother sister that's what he'll do he'll let you come to the message I'll let you put on a skirt and you'll sit there and while you'll say okay it's illegal ISM and watch you'll start only judging your experience by the length of your skirt brother sister that's where the bible says they he is in the spirit is not in the law it's not a license to sin but it wants to point to you that watch that the experience of the Holy Ghost it places the word inside you that's the difference we're not legal if I thought about preaching ever this morning brother sister but there's so many of us we are actually you'll receive the Holy Ghost and then Satan will try to bring you right back to sanctification when we understand the scripture it tells us that the Holy Ghost was to set you to service we got the Holy Ghost brother sister it's time to serve God it's time to get a little boldness in you because you know you've received something amen you've caught something that is taking you from carnality and it's placed you into a desire for the word itself oh ma now this is where we really lose connection especially in this day because we realize that that the idea of Pentecostalism is so despised even in the message and I don't want to take it too far I wanna tell you right in the balance that God has it they meant now I want you to see so what Satan can't touch your Holy Ghost but I told you I want to take this back to the word because if you see how important this is to your experience then you'll begin to really say Oh God what is your worship that you desire of me now look at this in the fourth seal what I love about the seals is you can't just listen to the third seal and get the third seal you got to go to the fourth seal sometimes you got taken you dig down they'll say something about in the seventh seal hallelujah that's alright because we're a full book bride amen and we're a full message bride we don't just say well that's before the seals I don't have to follow that but we can look at the whole message and live under the progressive revelation of it amen now notice what your prophet says here he says now now the power of notice here I want to touch one he says now now the power of revelation brings stimulation to the believer for the power of wine natural wine is to stimulate hurt not the oil in the line brother sister we can be sitting here right now with all the ghosts but did you know that Jesus Christ didn't tell saying hurt not the oil and stop right there he said hurt not the oil and the line brother sister if you can catch him in a line today I'm not saying you're gonna jump move around ah but I'm telling you you at least put a smile on your face because the word was made to stimulate you hallelujah some of us we drink a little coffee in the morning and you get to a place I just like that coffee but you'll find out that you're like college stimulates you a little bit it takes you from a place you kind of feel a beat up in the morning I know I'm probably the only morning person here the good morning starts about 10 o'clock it's been a real long time since I've been there but anyway notice here it says see it's to bring a person that's all slum down to us stimulation when we come into the house of God brother sister you come in out in the house of God without a smile you're broken up you're maybe having some trials in life when you come and hear the word of God it is actually supposed to take you from that condition and place you into a spot that you are now back in the joy of God the word and the gathering of the church is to take away the slump in the bride you know a God could do in this building today if we leave a slump today it would put it so all things are possible right here hallelujah so now notice it says well then now there's a power of the revelation of the word give stimulation of joy to the believer stimulation of satisfaction the stimulation that it's vindicated it's proved it's called in the scripture as we want to refer to it as new why we always refer to it like that as these are drunk on new on alright on spiritual wine I think the best interpretation would be on spiritual Wow so Jesus Christ he never wanted the victory to leave your experience you know when you feel a little victory you can't get a little happy you see God move on one year request you start getting a little happy hallelujah we're doing a a Bible study a couple of about four or five months ago and a sister she had got a lump on herself and and we were doing a Bible study her husband had prayed for those still there and then on a Sunday night we had a little Bible say I felt late I said let's go healing and I started giving a healing Bible study I felt the Lord all over I didn't know why but it felt good and subtle Wednesday I had that sister come up she says I don't know if it was if it was my husband or then the scripture coming for but she said I came to a place on Tuesday was gone it disappeared in there it was Jesus Christ all the way eternity he is the same type of God amen so this is where we begin to look because I want you to see brother sister we should be a very stimulated people but it's not a very stimulating hour every brother I talk to you church attendance is down everywhere I see in the midst of my own church people once stood so strong now we don't even have enough power to even make it to church I got a sermon for it it's coming let me say not here nope right not here but there should be something that's so strengthens the believer hallelujah brother sister we should be in a place that we are so in love with Christ we can't wait for the church doors open that's not me making it up that's a quote from the messenger of this hour even because we get a victory here but a lot of times we miss the fact of what this is this is a place to come and get gassed up this is a place to come get refueled you're here right now not through a religious service you're here because he's here you're here because you believe he's here to work on you to change you to raise you up to watch a bring some satisfaction to your walk amen and you'll do it right through the foolishness of preaching home ah something I love it cuz Paul call the foolishness of preaching but that's so many times what we allow it to be oh it's just a foolish little thing when brothers sister it's the very way God ordained to speak to us ohana our main portion now I'm gonna deal with wine for just a little bit and so this in here because a lot of times we like to stay away from this the Bible says about line in judges 913 it says in the vine said unto them should I leave my one which cheer if God and man and go to be promoted over the trees just a little statement on line but notice that grow that wine itself it cheers up God and men you wonder why you're not so happy it might not be the oil you might have the Holy Ghost but what you've allowed Satan to take your line you've got some wine in your experience it's going to turn your own brother sister oh no you hear because God ordained it to cheer you up now I want you to notice this it's not just for your chair but it's something that cheers God how could that be how could something natural be that way oh I'm glad you asked brother sister we're gonna get to it notice again in Isaiah 65 verse a it says thus saith the Lord as the new line is found in the cluster and one sayeth destroy it not for a blessing is in it so I do for my servants sake that I may not destroy them all so notice when the grape is turning and is becoming one the idea will find in the scripture if someone says destroy it a little too happy you look a little bit too excited for the Lord Jesus Christ but that's not what the Lord said but words that destroy it not for there's a blessing with it a blessing with the line Oh hallelujah you know if the Bible says brother sister it says in Ephesians I believe it says it says be not filled with wine wherein a success but be filled with the Holy Ghost hallelujah we're not looking at taverns and and wine sections because brother sister that is only an impersonation of the real thing amen and I'll tell you what if those people can get to a place where they give them nicknames like wino and drunks because what it's the only thing that satisfies them and what that's all they can do is cling to the impersonation then what about the believer to the truth emulation of this word oh my I'm Tony brother sister I'm this a type of preacher help that's all right I started getting a little stimulating myself and I start getting happy I hope that's all right hallelujah and I'll tell you on if you start feeling that that the line isn't just up here and it's starting to move around it'll give you a little cheer today it'll give you a little blessing today because brother sister it is not a joke that he's here it is the altar truth that we're living in right now my god never done left me he left Jesus Christ at the cross took the Holy Ghost away so then when it could come down to you he say I'll never leave thee nor forsake thee you might feel lonely little bit sometimes but brother sister draw nigh unto Him and He will draw nigh to you oh ma let's continue with this getting ready to make a little turn it's good so it's 104 15 now it says here it says in wine that maketh glad the heart of man you see this look at naturally how much that the scripture says this place into your experience notice happy joyful happy so the line will make your heart glad and oil to make his face shine that Holy Ghost make your shine right up and you'll find it it's not shined up you got a smile on your face which strengtheneth man's heart now the connection today we're only making with oil and wine because of the seals but I'll tell you what brother sister you're going to find out that it's always bread oil and wine and there's a purpose for that bread the word oil the Holy Spirit and wine the stimulation that goes to the believer this is beautiful brother sister I hope we can connect let's see now if there is a connection in question answers on the Selah 103 assist wine is the end oil is connected together in the Bible in worship now this is going to turn this completely in your face now and for me it's second time it feels good notices oh if I would only stayed in the third seal I never would have found that but here the profit and moved on the Holy Ghost he speaks and says that oil and wine is connected together in Bible for worship so notice this as we get ready to read this when Jesus Christ said see thou hurt not the oil in line why was he saying that because oil and wine is directly connected to your worship I hope you're feeling all right Mary prophet he started preaching it you start getting all excited whoa that wasn't just 50 years ago brother sister that's he still does that he still does it I preached on Wednesday night on 144,000 brothers sister I have the Holy Ghost on me a half hour after service it's one of those feelings you couldn't get away from I like those I treasure those because I have plenty of experiences where that's not there and if God would choose to just rest on me a little bit I'll sit there and soak it all up in peace joy and happiness amen so notice here it says see and the line as we put that's where I got the idea of stimulation wine stimulates and wine is the anti-type of its natural from stimulation is a revelation what is one the stimulation of Revelation we hear the word of God it stimulates us by the revelation I'm gonna tell you if you're a Bible believer you love when the word opens up you absolutely love it amen now notice she says now just think what stimulates the church revelations you say you see what it is we don't just shout - shout we don't just dance the dance we don't just raise our hands to raise our hands but it's actually because we love him and we're stimulated by him the revealing or opening up he says now watch the oil and wine went together in sacrifice when together in church worship assembled together connected together alright now notice this as begin to move the idea here is that what wine and oil are connected perfectly to worship in this body hallelujah and what they go together in sacrifice and when we assemble together see why it becomes important because the oil wine is for you when you leave each other and the oil wine is when you come together let's go now in our Bibles we're going to run through the scriptures now run right with me if you can if not just stay right up here now notice what God does very early on in Israel here in Deuteronomy 7 13 now notice he commands his blessings upon them and it says and he will love thee and blessed me and multiply thee he will also bless the fruit of thy womb and the fruit of Island come like warm valois 9 oil the increase of thy con the flax of thy sheep in the land which he sware unto thy father's to give one of God's proof for his love to his church was that he would bless them and we see here as you read up there in the yellow it says that what he would give them proving his love to them he would give them oil and one and once again of course you see corn dude around me 11:14 it says here in Deuteronomy 11 14 it says then I will give you the ray of your land in his due season the first rain and the latter rain that thou mayst gather in thy corn and thou lie and thine oil so what God's blessing to his people was to fully provide for them in the natural and notice God in His ideas and in his predestined word written from the foundation of the world ordained wine and oil to be part of the blessings alright we'll try to go through this part quick notice in Joel 2 19 it says yea and the Lord will answer and say unto his people behold I will send you corn and wine and oil and ye shall be satisfied there with God says I'm gonna give you enough to make you satisfied brother sister we should be satisfied in our experience of Christ amen we should be satisfied so much that it should make us one more Joe 223 says be glad then he children of Zion rejoice in the Lord your God for he has given you the former rain and moderately and he'll cause to come down for the rain the former and latter rain in the first month and the floor shall be full of wheat corn and the fat shall overflow with wine and oil this is prophetic brother sister and I will restore to you the years that the locust has eaten the canker and the caterpillar and the Palmer my great army which I sent among you and ye shall eat in plenty as far as the all-in-one and corn is concerned we are a plentiful Church he promised not just in that hour but in this hour we would be satisfied hallelujah that's why brother sister you see we ain't P warmers around here we are participate in bringing the word forth amen hallelujah no preacher can do it by himself but it takes the entire body of Jesus Christ getting into a place yes Lord come Lord dwell here move on my request God I've got family members god I've got friends but I want to see this prosper amen ma just take it a little bit farther now Deuteronomy 14 22 it says here that thou shall truly tithe all the increase of thy seed that the field bringeth forth year by year now we're talking about tithing and thou shalt eat before the LORD thy God in the place where she shall choose to place his name there the tithe of thy corn in the line and then oil and the first things of the hers and of the flocks that thou mayst learn to fear the Lord thy God always goddess didn't make you so that it's just you that has the corn and all and wine but he made it so he would give you enough so you could get it right back come on we said Oh God I've just got enough to make it another day when the Word of God says it brother sister in the Old Testament remember the old is only a shadow of the new we are living below our privileges brother sister because he has promised that we can have a moon now let's continue we're gonna get ready to turn this a little bit here I want you to see what your prophets say he said it's kind of connected with worship Testament God would want so they could tithe just so they were tired well I can't pay my house maybe you're lacking a little corn oil online he promised he would supply me nothing you got to do he promised he would supply hold him to his word now remember he said he would cut it off if you didn't serve Exodus 29 38 now notice here it says and now this is that which thou shalt offer upon the altar two lands of the first year day-by-day continually the one lamb bow shall offer in the morning other land thou shall offer at evening now notice this a lamb in the morning a lamb in the evening it's a daily sacrifice God looks for this was the law that he provided for his children no ma and with the one lamb a tenth deal of flour with the fourth part of a hint of bean oil and the fourth part of a hint of wine for a drink offering and the other land thou shalt offer an evening and shalt do thereto according to the meat offering of the morning and according to drink offering thereof for a sweet savour and offering made by fire unto the Lord when God set forth Israel now notice God would bless them with corn oil and wine but notice these things were things that would cheer up not just man but God and God says if you want to please me he says give me a meat offering and a drink offering in the morning and in the night we don't just praise him oh god I prayed in the morning I gave you a little bit of love as good enough but we see that watch that that oil and wine it would be part of your daily sacrifice notice God's desire was for his church to be able to give him all in line every day this was the worship that he was looking for you got daily to that land amen then tell you what you give me a mean offering and a drink offering show me that you love me think about that now I want to show you something here Israel in their happy moments and their good times we see that they just be and they weren't in captivity and so forth but they be giving this sacrifice every day daily the blessings would come but then every time we see in the scripture they begin to what work with idols they begin to a lot to lose faith in God and well then we find that they would actually become a conquered people and no longer were they able to do their sacrifices no longer were they able to please God now I want you to see that how this is going to tie in with your life here as this is just something it really was a blessing to me and Deuteronomy 28 47 he says because thou service not the LORD thy God with joyfulness and with gladness of heart notice for the abundance of all things because notice because they weren't serving God and happiness because they weren't glad for all the blessings that God put in their lives isn't that something brother sister in the and of Laodicea we want more but are never satisfied only we've get this right they say they say a person's got four acres was he wanted he wants more land a person has got a decent call what does he want he was a nicer car a person that makes this much money or an hour when he finds out he can do that oh I want more money an hour we're never satisfied with what God gives us and we'll see someone that's got maybe a better job or whatever and then we'll start getting down on our experiment it's not a blessed Christian and what you want you base your experience oh look at that pastor he can get anointed and what you start losing your thankfulness for all the things God does you start losing your joy of your experience you know I think about this brother sister because I feel like I am constantly preaching and I know it's hard because I find it myself to people we sit here it's just so hard for us to get a smile on her face you know in my church I'll sing I'm so happy oh I'm so happy and I start saying I start smiling and everyone right when I sing that I usually sing for a reason cuz everybody's like wait a minute you're talking that Jesus Christ is preaching to you and alls you can do it or it's time to worship your God all you do so I start seeing so happy all of a sudden everybody's like hey baby it's like a brightening happens just in the song then we get done I feel have you don't ya that's like some Saul ways some sort of momentary satisfaction and then and then just after a few minutes everybody's just back down can I get a Amen thank you and my church they say how about mourn one come on now adore to God and then they all get excited I say praise Lord cuz that's what it is if I'm not preaching I realized the challenge in the in the landscape cuz satan is constantly ruling over trying to find us we've got to make it to a place brother sister that satan is not welcome in this room we have come to glorify Christ we have come to make him known we have come so a lot so that when souls come they can find the same joy peace and happiness that Jesus Christ has given us so notice what he does because they won't serve him happily Oh with joy therefore thou shalt shalt thou serve thine enemies which the Lord shall send against thee in hunger and thirst and a nakedness and one of all things just because you weren't happy to serve God well that's the Old Testament oh no it's not why do you think in the New Testament finally ringing you hear ringing Thanksgiving you're ringing joy the old is the new brother sister the new is in the old it's what it is I'm the Lord I changed not notice because they wouldn't serve God happy he give him hunger and thirst and nakedness in one of all things and he shall put a yoke of iron upon thy neck until he have destroyed thee now notice where this goes the Lord shall bring a nation against thee from far and from the end of the earth to Swift as the Eagle fly I thought we were supposed to be the Eagles flying will hear the seals all glory to God oh you know it says in Revelation there's a flying eagle hallelujah bunch of sad flying eagles we're not just feeted brothers sister you can change just go to the cross I can change but it just doesn't have to be a smile on Sunday or a smile after service we can change we control the atmosphere your prophet said we were masters of every circumstance so what we do he'd send the nation after my nation 50th verse of fierce constants which shall not regard the person of the oil nor shoo-shoo favor to the young and he shall eat the fruit of thy cattle and the fruit of thy land which until thou be destroyed notice so what does he do he's cutting off the blessings which also shall not leave thee either corn wine or oil notice what was the corner on line it was the very worship they had to God their worship would be destroyed before God I'm not just a preacher I'm a partaker hallelujah the oldest or the increase of like I and the flocks of sheep until he have destroyed thee just cuz you're not thankful for the things God gives you you'll sit there dead in the church see my smile for me please thank you cuz but notice it's the same thing I can read all this but I want to show you he says the same thing because that serves not the LORD thy God with joyfulness of gladness of heart for the abundance of all things therefore shalt thou serve thine enemies he repeats it at how this begins to turn on him Joel 1:8 he says lament like a virgin girded with sackcloth for the husband of her youth the meat offering and the drink offering is cut off from the house of the Lord the priest the most ministers mourn the field is wasted the land mourneth for the corners wasted though new wine is dried up in the oil languages their backslidings took them so far from God yes that he cut the very daily sacrifice of pleasing them and the priesthood could do nothing but sit there and more oh come on now ye are priests and kings what's the house of God as a joy to come up to the house of God as now your assembly been turned over and you find that all that lies in the house of God it's a house of mourning there's no joy in the house of God hardly a joy to come into the house of God and what was it just because we weren't happy with living in America we have so many blessings brother sister what the whole crop would waste over and it would cut off their very worship to God I'm gonna jump times sake started real late try not to end late notice cheer I want you to see this I got a few of these I want to run to you because we need to see these things perhaps you've heard them I pray the recap will be a little good for you then and Luke 10:30 it says in Jesus answering said a certain man down from Jerusalem to Jericho and fell among thieves which stripped him of his raiment and wounded him and departed leaving him half dead oh my the Good Samaritan oh brother were deeper than this we're so much deeper and by chance there came down a certain message priest that way and when he saw him he passed by on the other side oh mama likewise another message Levite put in that message part hope that's now right but we're kings and priests brothers sister and he says and when he was at the place came and looked on him and passed by on the other side someone sick someone wounded someone half dead brother sister this is why we begin to what we see it brother sister that this orchestrates our entire experience and the crazy thing of it all brother sister is Satan can't do one thing to you but bluff you if you don't got all online we have laid it down so he passed my I'm on the other side 33rd verse but a certain Samaritan come on no Gentile as he journeyed came where he was and when he saw him he had compassion on him preach the whole series on compassion brother sister compassion is the ability to enter into another sufferings notice this Samaritan he wasn't some stones religious man as far as well I'm too good for you right I've heard people say so many times that the people in the message act like they're thoroughbreds and then they can't even witness nobody they can't love nobody it should not be that way cuz brother-sister if we can see ourselves in the book we're Samaritans in this hour amen Oh hallelujah we said oh well the prophets said that Jesus is a Samaritan right Jesus was a certain man right I'll tell you what who's Jesus's hands and feet today who did he say you're an ambassador you have the Ministry of reconciliation you are called brother sister to find those hurts those bruise those half-dead but look at this I want you to see that there's this characteristic you know it so well about the Samaritan he had compassion on him 34th verse and went to him and bound up his wounds pouring in oil and wine and set him on his own beast you see he had a beast as a power brother sister he didn't just have enough I could hardly stand up he was packing the Samaritan oil and one we wonder why the world is dying we were called to fulfill this you were called to help all those beaten and broken people but you know what what sets the Samaritan aside is he had oil and wine and a beast look at this look at this [Music] set him on his own beast brought him to an inn and took care of him and on the morrow when he departed he took out two pence and gave them to the host and said on him take care of him and whatsoever thou spend this long when I come I will repay thee we can keep on giving Haven which now of these three thinkest thou was neighbor unto him that fell among the thieves remember your Bible said what that Satan's seek he seek to steal kill and destroy you see the crazy way these people are acting they've only been robbed of the devil we've got too rich of a word too rich of a God to be hindered and to be called robbed ourselves just remember you can take it back the law of the land your prophets said is to enforce a claim you can pray in such a way that Satan will have to give it back so notice what he says to them last verse and he said he that showed mercy on him then said Jesus and him go and do likewise the commandment to the children of God was a ye would go and do likewise notice I go just a little bit give me another 10 minutes let's try to get this done he says the Samaritan this is according to the internet here found this wonderful the Samaritan poured oil and wine on his wounds then he bandaged them up notice it was common for travellers during that time period to carry a flask of oil and why notice this was a common sanitizing medicine the two were being together and poured on the wound the line was used to cleanse then why would watch it would kill the germs off of that person Oh hallelujah we had he run into the starboard sister you've got it a lot of times they're asking for a handout but brother sister we can give them a spiritual handout that is greater than any natural capability amen so what the line would cleanse and the oil to quell the pain so odd it would take away the hurt the auto was made to take all the hurt of that dead baton steal and kill destroyed experience way you could apply notice even today well what about Tylenol brother what about rubbing alcohol God's got a good way doesn't he even today the combination of the two elements are considered highly medicine all they're connected right with worship connected right with how you please God every day he said he'd keep giving it if you keep on loving it if you keep on thanking them for if you kept on a lot you kept on doing likewise hallelujah you were called one to move in experience unbeaten by Satan to bring forth oil and wine a stimulating experience you know so many times Roasters we try to witness but how happy are you in your witness god bless you know God sent a prophet and they look at you and say okay oh and you expect them how's the half-dead gonna help someone half dead you weren't called to be half dead you aren't called to be half effective you are called to what to carry the flash game you had the ability not just to lay some some oil on there but y-you could put them together and have a highly medicine or dose for this world's population and what it wasn't just medicine for someone else it was medicine for yourself [Laughter] come please bring it out with your prophet said he'll say just a couple sentences he'll say it's connected and worship it's connected with your sacrifice your sacrifice of praise is to be accepted with the oil and wine experience brother sister you can have it today look what he said he said you did lamb and of 57 you know I think these meetings are when we catch the sinner you know Jesus found a man one time in a parable was on the road from Jericho from Jerusalem to Jericho it showed he was backsliding I want to say this right now brother sister I got a brother that just just started come to my church about a year ago and his wife was always the one that served the message the the strong s'en he was always back so that always hope this is all right and his wife she finally turned on the message and walked off and he called me up he said I gotta meet you we met in a subway it's so ordained there's one person that was working behind the counter it was in the middle of this another big shopping mall no one come in until the end and we sat down and I've never had this happen on a little meeting counselling session we sat there and the Holy Ghost just fell down in the midst and he started weeping and crying I said you know he series like I can feel right there that brother gave His life back to God he's been serving God faithfully ever since and his wife has absolutely been tormenting him and you know brother Mike the one in the wheelchair the other ones gonna be walking pretty soon here and we talk like sons and daughters of God here brother sister you say how can it if you heard his experience 9 months ago I was up there minister on a Wednesday night and the Holy Ghost was there he got in his truck and started driving back in his wheelchair he said he hadn't felt his legs for eight or nine years he said all of a sudden he felt this he felt this anoint he come in the root coming in his car and then he said went all through his body and he felt his legs hadn't felt him for almost nine years hallelujah it's going to happen mark the Word of God hallelujah and this brother he started getting all sad about it he said and there's been like ten people who have these dreams that brother Mike's gonna walk he said you said brother camel I don't mean to lean on this but how come God gives this brother all these dreams and and I don't get nothing I said brother God must have knew that you were strong enough that you wouldn't need that but I said God can do it if that's gonna be something you need for your faith but technically you shouldn't need that anyway you should be looking at the word cuz I mean she just gets worse all time I said glory to God she's gonna break hard cuz you know what we doing the message we say yep they left the message I knew they were so procedure God's gonna bring this one brother sister so anyway it was just a couple of days after that and then two people in the church had dreams that she walked up in the church say God is that faithful and now all these little things are just happening we have to live in the reality of this word brother sister we've got to look at this and look right in the face of an impossibility and say o death where is your sting o mountain be thou removed just backsliders cuz we got oil on one plenty of it so notice he was back saying he met him on the road and the enemy had beaten him and robbed him and left him half dead that was physically alive spiritually dead your prophet he says the priests and the Levites so forth past him but the Good Samaritans Jesus taught it King picked him up poured oil and wine and take them to the end now no she said now there's the place I want to get you you he taken him to the end and said to the caretaker take care of him he a couple of pennies or whatever it was to pay his way and said now if he needs any more just go ahead and take care of him it'll I'll make it when I'll make it right when I come he says now your shepherds God give you the spirit in the word to take care of these wounded ones that's been brought in he types the in as the church says you can bring him in you can apply the oil and why some of us are looking at a flask right now doesn't have to be that way the devil took it from you well you can take it right back so if you need any more you'll take care of that when it comes to you to speed the Sheep now I want to get to one more place you see that I'm not just making these things up but God ordained these things to be in Scripture now notice when God fleed from Esau he came to a place called el Bethel how many know what Bethel means Beth ll God Beth the house Bethel means the house of God so in Jacob left and he fled from his brother's wrath he met God on a place where he seen angels descending and ascending run and we think we are climbing Jacob's Ladder and there he was there and he had that vision that dream upon him and what right after he he set the pillar up any poured oil over it he said this is El Bethel the house of God now when he actually came back on his way back from all those wanderings God comes to him in Genesis 30:1 5:1 he's got quite a group with him now why some kids and those who says and God said unto Jacob our eyes go to up to Bethel and dwell there and make there an altar unto God that appeared unto thee when thou fled us from the face of that of Esau thy brother and then Jacob sent him to his household and to all that were with him notice he's got to clean up put away the strange gods that are among you and be clean and trade your garments puts the whole house under the word yes come on sis you come back up to Bethel now you come up to the house of God third verse and let us arise almost done and go up to Bethel and I will make thee there an altar unto God God said you go that or make an altar there then that make you want to say better is one day in your courts than a thousand elsewhere who answered me in the day of my distress and was with me in the way which I went so here he does cleans everything out and starts heading to the house of God again he'd went by a different way but God called him back to the house of God notice in the night verse I want you to see this because I want you to notice this particular little thing that when Jacob was going he had an experience where he poured oil No Genesis 35 9 says and God appeared here in Bethel and unto Jacob again when he came out of but paddan-aram and blessed him and God said unto Him thy name is Jacob thy name shall not be called any more Jacob but Israel shall be thy name what's Israel me a prince with power with God God said unto him I am God Almighty be fruitful multiply nation in the company of nations shall be of thee and Kings shall come out of thy Lords and the language I gave Abraham and Isaac to thee I gave it and to thy seed and after thee will I give the land and God went up from him in the place where he talked with him and Jacob set up a pillar in the place where he talked with him even a pillar of stone and he pour a drink offering there on what was the drink offering why poured wine on it notice this is his offering unto God at the first he just laid some oil on there but after a while and what and coming back to his homeland brother sister we're coming back to the original word all the way it has been preached to us 50 years ago but we've got to eat this book because it has to manifest itself through us that's what's waiting on this rapture brother sister is that what we've got to allow this word to become a full revelation to us so he poured a drink offering their own and he poured oil their honor and Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him of course there we realized he comes right back to the homeland now don't he now let's stand now brother sister I want you to see this that when we look at God the house of God God requires that when we go into the house of God that we can still bring him all in line he wants you to come to the house of God with an expectation god I can hear from you you are here you are going to stimulate my experience with the revelation of this word and God I brought my Holy Ghost that's why we come early we pray up we get ready we don't wait for the word that comes okay I've been laying here dead the whole time we come we know what the house of God is for we know what we're here to do and brother sister if ever there was a time we should be getting a good Samaritan mentality and saying God when I run into the half-dead backslidden let me be packin oil and wine that I can touch their wounds cuz why are you here today because almost all of us have had a tan experience with God where one day he found you half dead one day he found you back slid he found you completely in the world and then either he come along or he sent someone along the way to minister this message to you and when the message was ministered to you it was and you found yourself in El Bethel ever since and brother sister we weren't just to receive an experience to say okay God someone help me out I guess I'll come in the house of God now but we realized that we're mature soldiers today we should be look and say I've got my own line right here I'm heading out let's see if we can apply just in case there's someone long way see when we come into the house of God God Here I am here's my worship Lord hallelujah I brought my token today I brought my stimulation of the Lord I need this didn't come to feed today been feeding all week cuz I've been giving a daily sacrifice before my brother's sister as we close I know just a little bit with it I'll shut this thing but as you look at yourself right now look at home the last weeks months years wherever you've been at brother sister what has it been to you have you found yourself a victim of the horse rider where he stole your Holy Ghost you don't feel like you got much you don't feel like you got anything hey if not that how about the stimulation of the Word of God about the hearing of the word have you found yourself no this is what a place but here Anthony go refresh I just want to be able to be filled up to be able to take and go out and be able to help those that are battling that are broken to be able to face you in all my worship
