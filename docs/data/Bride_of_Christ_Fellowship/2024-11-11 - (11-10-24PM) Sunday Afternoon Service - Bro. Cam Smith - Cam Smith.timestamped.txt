[0:00] am uh very much so looking forward to
[0:03] seeing what God is going to do here amen
[0:05] uh we're in a process right now where
[0:07] Satan is fighting harder than ever
[0:10] before but all that really tells us is
[0:14] it's going to the wind's even going to
[0:15] be
[0:17] sweeter uh the victory is uh it's
[0:20] getting sweeter all the time isn't it uh
[0:22] when you see especially you know you see
[0:23] people that have left this message they'
[0:26] they've moved on they've gone other
[0:27] routes and and uh yet you sit you sit
[0:30] right here and you're like I still
[0:31] believe this I still can't find nothing
[0:32] myself I can't find nothing wrong with
[0:34] this is like
[0:36] perfect Hallelujah so uh we Rejoice uh
[0:40] that the Lord has given us that
[0:42] Revelation amen uh so once again uh we
[0:45] love every one of you you're you're
[0:47] precious and uh let's stand for the
[0:49] reading of the word
[0:50] now I'm just going to preach another
[0:53] simple message uh I've I've pre been
[0:56] preaching some uh different serieses
[0:58] I've been preaching the the last message
[1:01] uh that Jesus gave to his disciples at
[1:03] home I've had quite a blast doing that
[1:05] I'm seeing the relevance of it I'm
[1:06] seeing how powerful it is to us I'm so
[1:08] glad that when we look at that you know
[1:10] what uh he's the vine we're the branches
[1:12] that's for sure amen uh and then I've
[1:14] been working also with what happened in
[1:16] 1963 that has been a fun fun time for me
[1:19] I was actually praying and uh the the
[1:21] Lord just came to me and said Put it on
[1:23] a chart and I did and uh it's it's
[1:26] helped me tremendously even and the
[1:28] church uh so we're appreciative of all
[1:30] those things from the Lord uh tonight
[1:31] we're just going to take just a little
[1:33] thought and uh once again I don't come
[1:35] in as a pastor I'm coming in as an
[1:38] evangelist so uh I hope that's all right
[1:41] and uh I'm not even going to do a
[1:43] PowerPoint tonight we're just going to
[1:44] go with it uh Hebrews 11:1 if you have
[1:46] your
[1:53] Bibles Hebrews 11:1 and after that uh we
[1:57] are going to
[2:00] 1 John 53 after that we're just going to
[2:03] preach a very simple little message
[2:05] tonight where is the victory okay uh
[2:08] where is the
[2:14] victory is between this in the open and
[2:16] sealed evidence so I I think Victory is
[2:18] pretty important right
[2:20] now Hallelujah uh Hebrews 11:1 it says
[2:24] now Faith is the substance of things
[2:26] hoped for the evidence of Things Not
[2:28] Seen uh for by it the elders obtained a
[2:32] good
[2:33] report uh through faith we understand
[2:36] that the worlds were framed by the word
[2:38] of God so how is God doing all this
[2:41] through
[2:42] faith we understand that the worlds ref
[2:45] framed by the word of God yes so when
[2:48] you place faith on the word of God what
[2:52] does it do
[2:57] materializes Hallelujah remember the
[3:00] quotes our Prophet gave us it's going to
[3:02] come to a time where you'll speak it and
[3:04] it will materialize right in front of
[3:06] you I believe that
[3:10] Hallelujah and he says so that the
[3:13] things which are
[3:14] seen were not made of things which do
[3:18] appear okay 1 John
[3:24] 53 so notice he made something out of
[3:27] nothing didn't he yes hallelujah
[3:29] hallelujah a lot of us look at that I I
[3:30] was just a big nothing I still feel like
[3:33] a nothing but he done made something of
[3:35] us right showed you you're the Bride of
[3:37] Jesus Christ what what more could you
[3:39] want you don't have to be like David try
[3:41] to be a David was satisfied just let me
[3:43] be a
[3:45] doorkeeper in the house of my God but
[3:47] God actually called you to sit on the
[3:48] throne with
[3:50] him
[3:51] Hallelujah uh 1 John 53 it says for this
[3:54] is the love of God uh that we keep his
[3:58] Commandments and his Commandments are
[4:00] not Grievous for whatsoever is born of
[4:03] God overcometh the world and this is the
[4:07] victory that overcometh the world even
[4:12] our faith Hallelujah you're going to be
[4:16] a Victor you're going to be an overcomer
[4:18] how you going to do
[4:19] it by faith Hallelujah let's bow our
[4:23] heads for a word of prayer thank you
[4:25] Lord our precious Lord Jesus Christ um
[4:28] we just taking this little thought as we
[4:29] we just feel the pole to go that way
[4:31] Lord and we're asking oh God that you
[4:33] just add your blessings to it Lord we we
[4:35] know that uh these days are long oh God
[4:37] and yet uh we want to make every moment
[4:39] count Lord so here it is we're bringing
[4:41] our all to the house of God again this
[4:43] evening uh once again inviting you Lord
[4:46] uh we understand by the prophet Lord
[4:48] that you never turn down one
[4:51] invitation so we invite you to be here
[4:53] oh God we we invite you to change our
[4:55] lives we we also God we we want to see
[4:59] you manif ested in our midst oh God uh
[5:02] it's really our heart's desire is to the
[5:05] way we read everything in the Bible we
[5:07] believe that we're still in the Bible
[5:08] days so we're asking oh God that you
[5:10] just be merciful unto us tonight and uh
[5:12] knowing that you're still at the throne
[5:14] you still ain't left there that that
[5:15] really gives us confidence oh God that
[5:17] you're here to minister the word of God
[5:18] unto us so Lord we're just asking uh uh
[5:21] raise us up oh God give energy to those
[5:23] that might be tired uh give strength oh
[5:26] God uh in mind that we might be able to
[5:28] receive the word uh for this moment oh
[5:30] God so we're just believing that you do
[5:31] it uh give us a move of your spirit we
[5:34] pray in the name of Jesus Christ we say
[5:36] Amen you may be
[5:39] seated I did not get to greet brother
[5:41] Vang I I kind of grabbed him two or
[5:43] three times and sister CA were so happy
[5:44] the lord gave them a baby there uh
[5:47] that's awesome Amen and uh two boys and
[5:49] two girls amen and uh with with parents
[5:52] like that you know they're just going to
[5:53] be a big bunch of sweethearts aren't
[5:55] they so uh I was writing brother van
[5:59] their day when we were doing these
[6:00] things and we've known each other for 20
[6:02] years I'm like wow said the only thing I
[6:05] regret is just same with my brother
[6:06] Jesse I wish we could all been together
[6:08] this whole time uh but God has had
[6:10] different routes for us amen uh so we're
[6:13] happy with whatever the Lord wants and
[6:15] yet we know that there's a time that
[6:16] we'll be gathered together unto him
[6:18] Hallelujah uh there'll be the Gathering
[6:20] of the outcast amen you realize that's
[6:22] the scripture causes right causes the
[6:23] outcast brother brandom uh called Jesus
[6:25] an
[6:26] outcast it's just somebody nobody wants
[6:29] nothing to do with amen uh but yet those
[6:31] outcasts what were they actually called
[6:35] Victors so tonight we just want to work
[6:37] this little thought uh where is the
[6:39] Victory and uh we showed you uh where
[6:42] the victory is here it's in your faith
[6:45] uh but we'll just uh try to go through
[6:47] this as best as we can um in if we
[6:51] Define that word Victory uh it means
[6:55] Conquest the defeat of an enemy in
[6:58] battle uh or of an antagonist in contest
[7:02] as a gaining of the superiority in war
[7:05] or combat uh Victory supposes uh the
[7:08] power of an enemy or an antagonist to
[7:11] prove inferior to that of the Victor
[7:15] amen uh Victory however depends not
[7:18] always on Superior skill or Valor uh it
[7:21] is often gained by the fought or mistake
[7:23] of the vanquished my there's a lot going
[7:25] on there with the Victor right there's a
[7:27] lot going on there with victory free
[7:30] amen uh but yet uh we're so glad because
[7:33] you see uh this world was not created uh
[7:37] that Victory would be something that we
[7:39] feel like we have uh from playing a
[7:42] sport or uh or maybe by uh um gaining
[7:47] mass mass amounts of money or or just
[7:50] being uh Superior intellectually or
[7:52] whatever that is but uh we understand
[7:55] that God made this
[7:57] world and this world was actually
[8:00] brought forth to bring forth the elect
[8:03] seed amen uh that's the whole purpose of
[8:05] all this right now uh you think about it
[8:08] the very purpose that this world is
[8:10] still going on is because God still is
[8:13] in the business of pro of what promoting
[8:17] or uh growing his elect seeds so that
[8:20] they can bring forth the perfect victory
[8:23] that God caused them to have amen
[8:25] hallelujah you see we can go in the
[8:27] scripture we could talk about this all
[8:29] night long but uh you see in the Old
[8:31] Testament uh the scripture says he did
[8:33] not call them to be the tail he called
[8:36] them to be the head amen he didn't make
[8:38] them to run from 10,000 he made five to
[8:41] chase 10,000 amen it was always God's
[8:45] will that as his church is gathered
[8:48] together unto him that they would be
[8:51] able to drive back the enemy amen uh
[8:55] Hallelujah a lot of times brother sister
[8:57] uh we get in the mindset that we're we
[8:59] live on the defense Hallelujah we know
[9:03] the book of Ephesians tells us about the
[9:05] whole armor of God and and uh wow uh boy
[9:08] I've got to have everything covered
[9:10] right but we understand that when you
[9:12] look at that armor there's absolutely
[9:14] nothing on the backside amen you are not
[9:17] made to run from the enemy Hallelujah
[9:19] you are not made to to shy back in into
[9:22] some sort of complacent defeated
[9:25] condition but you are actually called to
[9:28] what engage
[9:29] the battle amen alls you needed for one
[9:33] is a weapon and that was the sword right
[9:36] the sword of the spirit to put the enemy
[9:41] to flight amen and remember it's the
[9:44] Wilds or the tricks of the devil that
[9:46] you need the shield of Faith
[9:49] amen you have as a soldier in the army
[9:53] of Jesus Christ the ability to stop all
[9:58] the attacks that brings to you if we had
[10:01] time to go through it you could find out
[10:04] that uh uh when you look at Psalms 111
[10:07] our Prophet talked about the tree that
[10:08] would not
[10:11] wither Hallelujah you can go into second
[10:13] Peter 1 with the stature of a perfect
[10:15] man and what if you do these things you
[10:18] shall never fall right God has ordained
[10:23] us to pack this Revelation right now
[10:26] amen hallelujah but there's only one way
[10:29] that you're going to be able to do that
[10:32] and that is to actually Express what you
[10:35] are
[10:37] amenah this is a
[10:39] failure this is a loser right you think
[10:43] about it some of the greatest victories
[10:45] you'll have in this life is actually
[10:47] overcoming
[10:49] this Hallelujah let's look what a
[10:51] prophet said how can I overcome in
[10:55] 63 he says see as I said at the
[10:58] beginning you are born
[11:02] defeated that's a good
[11:06] start right and that birth can never
[11:11] bring you to life because you're born
[11:18] defeated and you're in a defeated World
[11:23] amongst defeated
[11:26] people amongst defeated Creed
[11:29] s defeated
[11:32] denominations sir you've got to come to
[11:37] Victory some way
[11:40] Hallelujah brother sister I'm just going
[11:43] to be bold so so excuse me for my
[11:45] boldness but people are the vast
[11:48] majority of this message is living in a
[11:50] defeated
[11:52] State Hallelujah and there's many
[11:55] reasons why Hallelujah they they've been
[11:58] brought under for for the most part
[12:00] they've been brought in Creeds and
[12:03] dogmas they've been brought into
[12:07] denominationalism Hallelujah I remember
[12:09] 20 years ago I never would have guessed
[12:10] coming into this message that I would
[12:12] see the same things that I seen in the
[12:14] Assembly of God but I'm watching it I'm
[12:17] watching Vacation Bible schools we're
[12:19] watching the youth separated brother
[12:21] Jesse and sister Chris we at the church
[12:23] last year doing that right when I was
[12:25] ministering that but but what we find
[12:27] that it was always God God's desire that
[12:30] the word would be enough amen the word
[12:34] would be all you would need for victory
[12:37] amen hallelujah hallelujah so if VBS
[12:40] ain't in here for our children do I need
[12:42] it for my
[12:43] children but if you actually look at the
[12:45] underlying effects of it what it
[12:47] actually does is it teaches your child
[12:50] that you can blend entertainment in with
[12:54] the
[12:55] word well what's more fun is it the
[12:58] entertainment M ment or the
[13:02] word hallelujah these these these these
[13:04] young Victors up here what's going to be
[13:07] their victory in this world when they
[13:10] can see that they were made to live this
[13:13] word out and that they can watch no
[13:16] matter what they see around the message
[13:19] world the actual World itself but that
[13:21] they have the ability if they just
[13:23] submit fully to this they will produce
[13:26] this amen
[13:29] Hallelujah you see there's got to be
[13:31] some way to
[13:35] overcome you've got to be able to get to
[13:38] Victory somehow now Luke 188 it says uh
[13:43] it's working of course with a parable of
[13:46] the of the just and the unjust judge
[13:48] right but uh we see in the eth verse
[13:51] says I tell you that he will avenge them
[13:53] speedily nevertheless when the son of
[13:56] man cometh shall he find faith on Earth
[14:00] amen amen so when he was actually when
[14:04] Christ comes hardly anyone will have
[14:08] faith any
[14:10] faith think about it when brother
[14:12] Brandon preached a Seal's message he
[14:14] said there only be so many he said and
[14:16] the rest won't even want to come that's
[14:20] right they don't even want to be in a
[14:23] Rapture they don't even care about about
[14:26] what beating the Devil up amen
[14:30] you were called to drive the devil mad
[14:33] amen you were called to watch through
[14:37] Christ be a foe that the devil don't
[14:39] even know what to do with
[14:43] you let me ask you does the devil know
[14:46] what to do with you remember brother
[14:48] brandom I believe was in the contest he
[14:50] said that he studies you out he studied
[14:53] you out your whole life he knows what
[14:55] little weaknesses get you to fall get
[14:58] you to do things you're ought not do
[15:00] right but you see just because he has
[15:02] been that wise in his attempt to destroy
[15:06] you does not mean that your weapon of
[15:09] the word of God is Not stronger to
[15:12] destroy him amen notice that's why he
[15:16] has to pervert the word because if you
[15:19] get a revelation of the true word you
[15:21] yourself will become an invincible Army
[15:24] before
[15:26] God hallelujah
[15:30] so we understand in Hebrews 11:6 it says
[15:34] but without faith very simple okay but
[15:37] without faith it is impossible to please
[15:41] him Hallelujah for he that cometh to God
[15:46] must believe that he
[15:48] is and that he is a rewarder of them
[15:52] that
[15:53] diligently seek Him think about this for
[15:58] you that came up for prayer this morning
[16:00] this
[16:02] afternoon you literally were exercising
[16:07] Faith okay did you feel
[16:13] it what if you didn't feel
[16:16] it see what are you basing your faith
[16:21] off Faith doesn't look at what you
[16:25] feel Faith takes what you believe
[16:30] Hallelujah remember when it came down to
[16:33] John Ryan what did John Ryan
[16:35] do he came up three times in the prayer
[16:39] line
[16:40] blind because brother Bram said Do you
[16:42] believe he said yes I believe you're I'm
[16:44] Healed and he walks off he goes back to
[16:46] his seat can't see comes back up he says
[16:49] brother Bram I I need you to pray for me
[16:50] again I or or I don't know what's going
[16:53] on here you you said I was healed and
[16:55] brother Bram said I thought you said you
[16:57] believed
[17:01] and that's how it
[17:02] ended but something had to
[17:06] transform in John Ryan's heart so that
[17:10] he was no longer looking at what he
[17:13] couldn't
[17:15] see think about it that is a challenge
[17:18] that many of us have never even entered
[17:21] into that's right he had almost one of
[17:25] the ultimate
[17:27] challenges because frankly he couldn't
[17:30] see but yet he had to say he was
[17:35] healed Hallelujah so what did he do
[17:39] that's what I'm saying it doesn't matter
[17:40] what you felt this morning afternoon it
[17:43] doesn't matter what you feel right now
[17:45] we invited him he will not turn down the
[17:50] invitation Hallelujah so what did John
[17:52] Ryan do he he was passing out or selling
[17:55] papers he'd be out there blind he said
[17:57] extra extra Read All About It praise the
[17:59] Lord I'm healed
[18:01] amen what you don't see or maybe we
[18:04] should see is that was actually a Victor
[18:08] who is in
[18:10] expression by faith he caught the
[18:13] Revelation that he was going to be
[18:15] healed in a circumstance where there was
[18:18] no justification for it that's right
[18:21] Hallelujah yes Hallelujah so days and
[18:25] days go on praise the Lord read all
[18:27] about it I'm healing
[18:30] I can
[18:31] see he had to be willing to act on what
[18:36] he said he believed yes sir yes sir he
[18:39] was willing Hallelujah brother and
[18:42] sister I don't care if you got unsaved
[18:45] family members Hallelujah this message
[18:48] goes into it amen and tells us that what
[18:52] just like Rahab we can believe we can
[18:54] claim them for the Lord I'm coming after
[18:57] them but you can't do that on a carnal
[19:00] level it's got to be faith that sets
[19:03] inside of you and says you know what
[19:07] they're
[19:08] mine hallelujah what is that that is the
[19:11] expression of Faith no they're not
[19:14] coming they're not
[19:16] coming maybe he's right maybe brother
[19:18] Cam's
[19:21] right it shows you never believed it
[19:24] right when you
[19:26] question the what you perceive is the
[19:29] will of God faith is the substance of
[19:32] things hoped
[19:33] for you can't please God without it so
[19:36] you might as well live by
[19:40] it Hallelujah but we see that what John
[19:44] Ryan finally got into the position of
[19:47] persecution where he was in the he was
[19:49] in the barber shop right getting his
[19:52] haircut and they wanted to Snicker and
[19:53] pick on them a little bit they said John
[19:55] Ryan I thought you said you were healed
[19:56] by that that healer
[19:59] like that and what right he said I and
[20:02] when he confessed yes I am healed amen
[20:05] then his eyes opened up and he could
[20:09] finally see
[20:11] amen but when did John Ryan get the
[20:16] victory was it at the end this is one
[20:20] thing I love brother sister because tie
[20:21] in with the
[20:23] scriptures Jesus I'm reading through the
[20:26] The Book of John Jes Jesus had already
[20:30] got to a spot with a crucifixion he's
[20:32] like yeah it's already
[20:36] done he wasn't say oh I wonder
[20:40] if he knew he was going to live out what
[20:45] the word said he was to
[20:48] do so if you tie in John 14:12 The Works
[20:52] that I do shall ye do
[20:56] Hallelujah cuz he goes into the fire
[20:58] father and greater work shall you do
[21:02] amen you are only identifying yourself
[21:05] in the word
[21:09] hallelujah
[21:11] hallelujah now watch faith is our
[21:13] Victory 58 he says was not it Lazarus
[21:18] who was laying dead in the
[21:20] ground and had already corruption set in
[21:23] and Jesus said to Martha where have ye
[21:26] buried him and if you won't doubt you
[21:28] shall see the glory of God did not I
[21:30] tell you not to doubt he said to gyrus
[21:33] that night or that day if you only
[21:36] believe you can see the glory of
[21:40] God God can't change his essence or
[21:45] nature just like our Prophet said God
[21:47] would be much happier he would be he'd
[21:50] be when he starts seeing the
[21:52] Eagles start flapping their wings
[21:54] whether they fly or
[21:57] not CU what by Nature that eagle will
[22:01] fly there's nothing that can stop that
[22:04] eagle from
[22:05] flying there's nothing that is going to
[22:08] be able well what if he don't fly
[22:10] remember the prophet said that what that
[22:13] Mama Eagle will be right there to catch
[22:17] them Hallelujah but what God wants to
[22:20] see that you believe it you can't hide
[22:24] away from it all the time because
[22:26] remember faith is is the
[22:31] victory hallelujah hallelujah watch what
[22:35] he says so he he's talking here he said
[22:37] did not I tell you not to doubt he said
[22:40] to gyus that night or or that day if you
[22:43] only believe you can see the glory of
[22:44] God he said then Faith overcomes
[22:49] death faith is the victory over death
[22:53] faith is the victory over sin faith is
[22:57] the victory over
[22:59] sickness faith is a victory over
[23:02] worry faith is the victory over
[23:06] frustrations faith is the victory over
[23:10] the world
[23:13] Hallelujah so how many are going to make
[23:14] a Rapture here yes sir you believe
[23:19] that remember I Prophet said everything
[23:21] that you need to make a Rapture is
[23:22] already inside of
[23:24] you I just I just I was going to preach
[23:26] a different message and brother in that
[23:27] message brother BR said do you really
[23:29] realize that your glorified body is
[23:30] sitting here right
[23:33] now maybe we can explain
[23:37] that
[23:38] Hallelujah another quote brother Bram
[23:40] said he said he said God will give you
[23:42] power he said in every Dimension that
[23:44] it's meant to be lived out in you every
[23:48] Dimension do you believe
[23:52] that he believed that he watched that
[23:57] right Hal Hallelujah remember the one
[23:59] time the uh the the people's baby
[24:02] died and brother Bram said let me pray
[24:04] about it and when he went back to the
[24:06] people he said leave them there leave
[24:08] your son there I found him
[24:14] there Hallelujah take your hand off it
[24:17] it's the hand of the Lord sir well what
[24:20] was he doing he actually was entering
[24:23] into a different
[24:26] dimension in exercising in ability to
[24:29] overcome in that
[24:32] Dimension so that's why you see even in
[24:34] the realm of demonology you have the
[24:37] ability to overwhelm the devil even in
[24:41] the
[24:43] Unseen Hallelujah you see that's what
[24:46] this message did which is almost power
[24:48] more powerful it's just tremendous but
[24:50] when brother brandom was sitting there
[24:52] catching the spirits he would watch this
[24:54] demon go try to help someone else with
[24:57] the same demon
[24:59] we know how Satan works but we even know
[25:04] with that being
[25:06] exposed that if that individual just
[25:09] stayed there and believed it didn't
[25:11] matter how many demons came
[25:15] over the faith that laid in that
[25:18] predestinated seed was Unstoppable
[25:22] amen why because the faith that he
[25:26] placed inside of you can make take a
[25:30] Rapture hallelujah it's so strong your
[25:33] Prophet said that if if the laws
[25:35] provided it you could create a world and
[25:37] go live on
[25:40] it all right any
[25:44] partakers Hallelujah but the issue we
[25:47] even find it in Hebrews 4 it says that
[25:50] what they did not mix Faith with the
[25:54] word that's
[25:56] right this morning's message ain't going
[25:58] to do you if if if Faith doesn't reveal
[26:00] it to
[26:01] you Hallelujah I want God to let that
[26:05] Revelation sit there that there he is
[26:07] thinking about me there he is he knows
[26:10] my
[26:11] thoughts he's wanting me to entertain
[26:14] him with my love for him he's wanting
[26:17] him he's wanting me to not give
[26:20] up by falling into a temporal State and
[26:25] losing track of who I am yes sir
[26:29] how is he going to produce invincibility
[26:32] in
[26:35] you how's he going to do
[26:39] it well invincibility is proven by
[26:45] battle sir it's proven by battle you
[26:49] look at a lot of these countries the
[26:50] battles they're going through they don't
[26:51] even know if they're going to be living
[26:53] tomorrow don't think you're going to get
[26:55] out of it
[26:56] easy but I'll tell you what that's why
[26:59] this word was
[27:02] sown that's what God is trying to build
[27:05] in
[27:06] you because
[27:09] why if you're the Bride of Jesus Christ
[27:13] brother cam why' you say if
[27:16] exactly there's something I say I am the
[27:18] Bride of Jesus
[27:20] Christ but if I'm I do it
[27:24] again I'm the Bride of Jesus Christ
[27:27] you're for the Bride of Jesus
[27:31] Christ then how if we truly believe that
[27:36] can what can we not exercise the rights
[27:40] that's given to us by election
[27:43] Hallelujah yes sir yes sir he literally
[27:48] redeemed you to bring you to the
[27:50] Revelation that you're
[27:52] saved but it wasn't supposed to stop at
[27:55] saved Hallelujah when you link the
[27:58] scriptures together salvation and
[28:00] healing go hand in hand the god that
[28:03] saved us and the god that healed
[28:06] us hallelujah they work hand in hand but
[28:10] they'll only come by your faith
[28:16] amen that's why I mean if we would be
[28:18] serious in the moment many times we
[28:22] don't see Divine Healing when you know
[28:23] why because we really don't believe
[28:25] we're saved
[28:28] and get quiet on
[28:34] that got real quiet on
[28:36] that ding ding ding ding ding
[28:40] ding you may now move to point
[28:45] B but what is
[28:47] that the revelation of
[28:53] Salvation if you can have faith for
[28:55] salvation that same faith
[28:58] exercises
[29:00] healing just as
[29:05] simple
[29:07] Hallelujah and you see no wonder the
[29:09] Bible is going to tell us to gird up our
[29:11] mind because the devil's constantly
[29:14] coming and trying to tell you that
[29:16] you're something you're
[29:19] not his whole motive is to show that you
[29:24] just came here by
[29:26] chance his whole desire is to show you
[29:31] that you can't live this and you know
[29:34] what he's 100% right you can't live
[29:39] it remember that's why you had to bypass
[29:43] your
[29:46] theophany your word body you had to
[29:49] bypass that in order to stand
[29:54] Temptation well wait a minute so when
[29:57] this Earth is is over when when this
[29:59] bride is raptured you'll get your
[30:00] glorified body you'll get your theophany
[30:03] all of it right our Prophet told us
[30:05] about this who is this MDC right and we
[30:08] found that what the dead will have to
[30:11] get their
[30:12] bodies we'll have to get our
[30:15] theophanies so we all got something in
[30:17] common we're trying to come into
[30:19] completion the way God made it to be in
[30:22] the order of deity
[30:28] big question then how are you going to
[30:31] overcome without a
[30:34] theophany that's how simple this is it
[30:37] really is how simple this
[30:40] is he made it so that his wife could
[30:45] only
[30:47] live in the joining and uniting with
[30:52] himself that's the danger of being a
[30:54] false anointed
[30:55] ones because they want a form of God
[30:59] godliness Hallelujah but they want to
[31:02] express it Matthew 7 according to their
[31:04] own
[31:08] will but this mind that Christ wants to
[31:12] place in
[31:13] you it takes on the form of no
[31:19] reputation Hallelujah that's how brother
[31:22] brandham had the victory yes he
[31:25] literally thought he was nothing
[31:28] yes
[31:30] Hallelujah he said forget any everything
[31:33] about William Brandon when I go that's
[31:35] right yes sir he realized he said
[31:38] there's no sound thing in me at
[31:41] all Hallelujah well why was that not
[31:45] because he was an elected seed but in
[31:47] the flesh level in the spirit realm he
[31:51] was still in a fallen temporal condition
[31:54] he did not want you to lean upon his in
[31:58] abilities right right that's why he
[32:01] could only point you to the
[32:05] word hallelujah so you can only look at
[32:09] the word and what join with the word in
[32:13] order to express the victory of God
[32:17] hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah hope I
[32:20] haven't lost you that's just we're just
[32:22] preaching just having a good time up
[32:24] here preaching yeah I get a little
[32:26] sweaty I can't help it
[32:29] so he says Psalms
[32:32] 98:1 he said a Psalm he said oh sing
[32:35] unto the Lord a new
[32:37] song for Heath done marvelous things his
[32:41] right hand his holy arm ha gotten him
[32:46] the
[32:47] victory he went and got the
[32:50] victory are all things under his
[32:55] feet they are in in the spiritual realm
[32:59] yes but you see the victory God wants to
[33:02] give you is not a high-paying job
[33:06] necessarily it's it's not the it's not
[33:08] the typical American 101 dream and
[33:13] vision married one dog two
[33:16] children nice car nice job great
[33:20] retirement that is not the victory that
[33:23] God is worried about getting you that's
[33:25] right brother now we think on those
[33:27] lines Hallelujah hey brother and sister
[33:29] one of the greatest things I ever did
[33:32] was I reached up the faith and I believe
[33:35] I prayed the right
[33:37] prayer I was just as young as some of
[33:39] these brothers here I I believe I was 19
[33:41] or 20 I was in a deadend job making 8 an
[33:45] hour
[33:49] 1990 99 somewhere in there and
[33:54] literally I was making eight bucks an
[33:55] hour I had a truck payment I was still
[33:57] living at home and I was watching my
[33:59] bank account go down I'm like $8 an hour
[34:01] I just wanted to be a tool and die maker
[34:03] that's all I wanted to
[34:05] be and I just became a
[34:09] Christian and I'm like this ain't
[34:11] working I was still in denomination
[34:13] somebody's a
[34:16] God nothing was working for me and I
[34:21] remember I just had this I went to
[34:23] church that day Assembly of God and this
[34:26] thought comes to me
[34:28] pray about
[34:29] it I'm like all right I remember getting
[34:33] down at my knees on that seat just like
[34:36] this watching the same thing right now
[34:38] pretty
[34:39] blessed and I got down on my knees and I
[34:42] said Lord Jesus I said this financial
[34:47] situation is not working out for me I
[34:49] said
[34:52] Lord this is all I'm asking I'm not
[34:55] asking to be a rich man and I'm not
[34:57] asking to be a poor man I said Lord
[35:00] could you give me a job that will
[35:03] support a family which I did not know
[35:05] was going to be this
[35:08] big and I got up and it just seemed like
[35:11] a just an inspired
[35:13] moment and I went back and I'm like amen
[35:17] all
[35:19] right three months later I have a guy
[35:22] come up to me he said and he just came
[35:23] up to me he said he said hey how you
[35:25] doing I Saidi doing good I graduated
[35:26] with his daughter' and he said he said
[35:28] did you ever think about getting a local
[35:29] 501 first thing's out of his mouth I'm
[35:32] like no he said I'm I'm going to give
[35:35] you all the information so he gives me
[35:36] all the
[35:38] information he says go down there and I
[35:41] went down there and I got the
[35:44] job and right now I'm not a rich man I'm
[35:47] not a poor man but I have enough to
[35:49] support a family and I've had it for all
[35:53] these years
[35:55] now Hallelujah it was just simply asking
[36:00] God with the right State of Mind the
[36:03] right motive the right
[36:05] objective Hallelujah you think that God
[36:08] I'll tell you what how many rich people
[36:10] are going to make it not
[36:13] many I have an needle right came going
[36:16] have an needle right a
[36:18] many if I would have said Lord Make Me a
[36:24] Millionaire you know I wouldn't be here
[36:26] right now don't you I wouldn't have
[36:28] been honestly I would have never done
[36:32] it but God put you in those moments of
[36:35] inspiration to see what you'll do about
[36:40] it Hallelujah sometimes he's just laying
[36:44] on you to see what kind of cry you
[36:49] have and to see if you'll be more
[36:51] aligning with the word than aligning
[36:53] with personal motive hallelujah
[36:56] hallelujah and if you can place faith on
[37:00] that you'll find that God will give you
[37:02] the answer hallelujah hallelujah now
[37:06] think about this so then I get that job
[37:09] brother Simon was was not in a good job
[37:11] either within a year he fills out the
[37:13] application for the same Union I'm in
[37:15] gets
[37:17] in a few laters years later then brother
[37:21] Dustin gets
[37:23] in Hallelujah but it just went from one
[37:26] to the next to the next
[37:29] and it
[37:35] work can you believe
[37:37] that you do believe that don't you
[37:40] that's a
[37:41] victory just think of God cares about
[37:44] your financial needs how much more does
[37:47] he care about your spiritual needs how
[37:49] much more does he care about your family
[37:51] members right a soul is worth 10,000
[37:54] worlds right we hear it we believe it
[37:57] and God gives you the same ability to
[38:00] place faith on the temporal and it works
[38:04] that he wants to do in the spiritual
[38:07] realm
[38:08] amen you realize when you make a claim
[38:11] on your family member if you stay right
[38:14] there and say God I know you gave him to
[38:17] me Faith is a substance of things hoped
[38:21] for you hope for
[38:25] it well I haven't seen it
[38:28] sometimes God will make you put a claim
[38:30] on the most evil person that you
[38:33] know and sometimes that's your family
[38:36] member
[38:38] Hallelujah but what is
[38:40] it he puts that little hope in your
[38:44] heart and then you pounce it
[38:47] amen I believe that you'll give it to me
[38:50] God how you going to get victory over
[38:53] that the only way that you're going to
[38:55] get Victory is to realize realiz that
[38:58] that thought came from God and it's to
[39:00] exercise through
[39:05] God brother sister we've all watched it

[39:44] you is Jesus Christ already purchased
[39:46] your
[39:47] Victory thank you Lord if Christ got the
[39:52] victory then what did he give you when
[39:55] he took your place that's what you have
[39:58] to realize he took your
[40:00] place all he asked you to do is to take
[40:03] up your
[40:05] cross which is what to surrender your
[40:09] life to him hallelujah hallelujah what
[40:13] the other day I just preached on how can
[40:14] I overcome and I was absolutely shocked
[40:17] by looking at it but when brother Bram
[40:19] says how can we overcome you know how
[40:21] you have to surrender to his
[40:24] will that's
[40:26] it yes I have to surrender to his will

[40:56] yield to these dirty Waters of
[40:59] Jordan yes
[41:01] sir how many times did he dip seven
[41:06] times which one made the
[41:10] difference the
[41:12] seventh so when Jesus Christ through our
[41:16] Prophet brought back the revelation of
[41:19] water
[41:21] baptism this was a revelation for those
[41:24] who would be turned back to a young man
[41:29] the scripture said he had flesh as a
[41:30] child right
[41:32] Hallelujah this revelation of water
[41:35] baptism is so powerful but yet we don't
[41:39] even Place faith on
[41:44] it hallelujah what what does it mean to
[41:49] us you see all God's doing is revealing
[41:51] to you who you
[41:54] are I see it it's in the name of Jesus
[41:56] Christ
[41:57] I see it father son holy ghost that is
[41:59] Lord Jesus Christ I see it
[42:03] Hallelujah so what are you actually
[42:04] doing you're getting baptized in the
[42:06] power of that
[42:08] name the power of that name brings
[42:15] results
[42:18] Hallelujah let's
[42:21] continue Isaiah 59
[42:30] 15th verse it says ye truth faileth and
[42:33] he that departeth from Evil maketh
[42:35] himself a prey and the Lord saw it and
[42:39] it displeased him that there was
[42:42] no
[42:45] judgment did you get
[42:47] that Watch What Happens here I want you
[42:49] to see this what happens when truth
[42:53] fails
[42:55] Hallelujah heard a little the the little
[42:57] discourse about politics and so forth
[42:59] out

[43:26] thing you can trust TR
[43:28] now there really is only one now why did
[43:31] God make it that
[43:33] way you can't trust a
[43:36] politician you can't you almost can't
[43:38] trust the abilities of of of a preacher
[43:41] or a pastor your brother
[43:43] sister hey has anybody here failed
[43:46] anyone else here anybody well brother
[43:49] Jesse and sister Christen are the only
[43:50] ones okay oh and Haven you I you got to
[43:54] tell the truth Sith tell the truth
[43:57] oh truth
[44:01] faileth but we fail people all the time
[44:04] I fail people all the time I don't even
[44:06] mean to it's just
[44:08] natural I don't have to try it just
[44:17] happens yay truth faileth and he that
[44:20] departeth from Evil maketh himself a
[44:24] prey people that try to apart from
[44:28] Evil make themselves a
[44:32] prey that is it stand for Christ getting
[44:35] any easier no you're literally watching
[44:37] this what's truth where's truth who's
[44:39] truth is anything I've got taught
[44:44] truth I'm going to try to depart from
[44:46] Evil oh boy here it
[44:50] comes
[44:53] Hallelujah and the Lord
[44:55] sought the Lord sees this type of a
[44:59] condition and it displeased him that
[45:02] there was no
[45:04] judgment he did not like to
[45:08] see this type of situation for his
[45:12] children so what'd he
[45:15] do and he saw that there was no man and
[45:19] wondered that there was no intercessor
[45:22] 16th verse right he wondered there's no
[45:27] intercessor for
[45:30] them so why was an intercessor
[45:34] sent to show you
[45:37] truth and to what to bring the word in
[45:42] such a way that those that are departing
[45:45] from Evil they would not just sit as a
[45:52] prey look at Paul we know Paul came to
[45:55] it but do you realize how many times he
[45:57] avoided death look at his resume if you
[46:00] want to feel ashamed of
[46:01] yourself
[46:03] Hallelujah so he says
[46:06] therefore his arm brought salvation unto
[46:10] him and his
[46:12] righteousness it sustained
[46:14] him he seen the lack so he bridged the
[46:19] Gap amen for he put on righteousness as
[46:22] a breastplate and as a a helmet of
[46:25] salvation upon his head he put on the
[46:26] the garments of Vengeance for clothing
[46:28] and clad was clad with Zeal as a
[46:33] cloak Hallelujah let's jump down 20th
[46:36] verse it says and the Redeemer shall
[46:37] come to Zion which is always the bride
[46:40] our Prophet said and unto them that turn
[46:43] from transgression in Jacob saith the
[46:47] Lord Christ came to bring you Victory
[46:53] amen don't you see the whole purpose of
[46:56] inter
[46:57] is to bring you
[46:59] Victory that's what it is if you have an
[47:02] intercessor you have a Pathway to
[47:07] Victory
[47:08] [Music]
[47:13] Hallelujah I'm GNA try to skip
[47:17] around let's go to Faith is our Victory
[47:19] again 58 he said now Faith paragraph 23
[47:23] faith is a
[47:24] conqueror faith is an overcomer
[47:27] it just isn't a
[47:29] peacemaker it
[47:31] overcomes Faith
[47:33] overcomes it takes the challenges
[47:37] on and it overcomes
[47:40] them all right faith is the victory that
[47:44] overcomes the world what does it
[47:48] do so what is this faith that overcomes
[47:52] the world what does it do what is Faith
[47:55] what is the Conqueror conquer and
[47:58] victory is the same to conquer it means
[48:01] to beat down to
[48:05] override to handcuff to throw into
[48:14] prisons that's what conquer means we've
[48:18] been made more than
[48:22] conquerors throw in
[48:25] jail throw into the prison override beat
[48:29] down when's the last time you beat the
[48:32] devil
[48:35] down see we live
[48:37] underprivileged and a prophet said we
[48:39] live under privileged because we don't
[48:41] know who we
[48:44] are
[48:48] Hallelujah it means that the sin that
[48:51] once ruled you you rule it now yes
[48:55] hallelujah it's one most astonishing
[48:57] things brother brandom says he says do
[48:58] you have to sin he said
[49:03] no how you
[49:06] doing
[49:09] great I'm
[49:14] overcoming Hallelujah he says it means
[49:17] that you have overcome he said you've
[49:19] whipped
[49:20] it you're greater than it is oh I feel
[49:24] religious right now which was first
[49:26] first a sinner or a
[49:32] savior Hallelujah a savior for a savior
[49:37] is more powerful than a sin which was
[49:39] first the Healer or a
[49:46] sickness he said it couldn't be a Healer
[49:48] unless it was over the sickness the
[49:51] Healer right it says it is a Healer it
[49:55] could conquer the winess and faith is
[49:59] the victory that overcomes Every curse
[50:03] of the devil faith is the victory
[50:07] hallelujah hallelujah every single curse
[50:10] of the
[50:11] devil you realize I know this personally
[50:16] said people can place curses on
[50:18] you and all of a sudden if you're not
[50:21] careful if you're not spiritually minded
[50:22] you'll watch yourself doing things
[50:24] you're like why in the world am I doing
[50:25] this
[50:26] because if you are not active to conquer
[50:28] the curse that's placed on
[50:31] you it can get
[50:34] you oh we're quiet not again this second
[50:37] round of
[50:38] quietness that's how it goes your
[50:41] parents could have put curses on you
[50:43] you're your your person at the job can
[50:45] say stuff to
[50:49] you just think about it if the power of
[50:51] the spoken word is how we are to
[50:54] overcome that is that is is the Pinnacle
[50:57] of where we're
[51:00] going do you see how
[51:03] powerful your words are when you speak
[51:07] Evil all you got to do is say one time
[51:10] you're having a bad day you say when it
[51:12] rains it pours and you will be
[51:17] repenting I can't say it no more because
[51:20] I found out if I say that it just gets
[51:21] worse it gets worse it gets worse and
[51:25] then all of a sudden I'm just like
[51:28] that was
[51:30] stupid then you got to repent but I
[51:33] found the best way to deal with it is
[51:35] don't even say it to begin with don't
[51:38] accept you feel something rolling on
[51:40] your body it's
[51:43] nothing I don't have to accept
[51:45] that because the devil can try to curse
[51:50] you Hallelujah don't accept things that
[51:53] you don't have to take
[51:57] you don't have to accept the box of
[52:01] rattlesnakes you see part of the victory
[52:03] is realizing you don't even have to
[52:04] accept it yesall Hallelujah when Satan
[52:07] tried to give me diabetes you know what
[52:09] I did I got down I know it was now I
[52:12] know it was I know it was the voice of
[52:13] the devil that came to me and it said
[52:15] you have diabetes just like your family
[52:20] does and I remember I was so awkward at
[52:22] the moment because I'm so dizzy and I'm
[52:24] like oh this is like some sugar thing or
[52:25] something
[52:27] and it said that to me and all of a
[52:29] sudden something just raised up and I
[52:30] said no no no no no no no I rebuke you
[52:34] in the name of Jesus Christ I don't have
[52:36] diabetes anybody heard me tell
[52:38] this Hallelujah so I went I went and and
[52:42] wiggled my way to bed I laid down in my
[52:44] bed next day I was just
[52:47] fine but when I said that to the Lord
[52:49] after I rebuked it I said Lord if you
[52:51] heal me Lord if you take this away I
[52:54] will testify of it
[52:58] so a month later you know good old smart
[53:01] guy me I forgot all about it it never
[53:04] came to me and then all of a sudden I
[53:06] was up there and I was just I was
[53:08] cranking Away In Living Waters
[53:09] Hallelujah I letting the water
[53:12] roll and the Holy Ghost came to me and
[53:15] said I healed you you said that you
[53:17] would
[53:21] testify so I started
[53:24] testifying that God God delivered me of
[53:27] that diabetes that was trying to take my
[53:30] body guess what happened that
[53:33] night I got home and all of a sudden I'm
[53:39] like it tried coming back on
[53:42] me I'm like okay this is too obvious now
[53:46] I said Satan I rebuke you in the name of
[53:48] Jesus Christ I don't have to accept this
[53:50] it went away after that I went to albian
[53:53] and preach and it came on me to preach
[53:54] again guess what happened after that
[53:57] it that demon of diabetes tried to jump
[53:58] on me again I rebuked it and I went on
[54:02] and here I am what 8 10 years wife know
[54:05] better than me 8 10 years later I've got
[54:08] the
[54:09] victory I don't know if you know it's
[54:11] I'm in perfect health to the glory of
[54:14] God hallelujah not to my vitamins and
[54:17] supplements but to the glory of
[54:22] God but what is it faith is the victim
[54:26] three it's just
[54:28] simple and it's laying remember brother
[54:31] Bram said that faith will lay
[54:34] dormant it'll lay dormant inside of you
[54:37] it that means it won't do anything
[54:40] you've got to activate it that's why
[54:42] brother BR said he said where faith is
[54:44] preached the people
[54:48] live I'm here to activate your faith
[54:51] sister Lena Hallelujah I'm here to what
[54:55] I'm here to preach to you that the god
[54:57] that's with you amen will help you what
[55:00] conquer the
[55:02] enemy conquer beat him
[55:06] down throw him in prison that's brother
[55:09] bram's definition I'm just telling you
[55:10] what he said yes think about it he
[55:13] became so experienced with it that it
[55:15] was just
[55:17] natural like all right let's Devil's
[55:19] gonna
[55:20] go the more he had experience in his
[55:23] communion and his walk with God the more
[55:25] that Victory lived
[55:27] was he immune well no he still had that
[55:29] squirrel every seven years I he had all
[55:31] sorts of stuff he had to deal with but
[55:32] but what was it for that measure of the
[55:34] spirit of God of what it was doing for
[55:36] other
[55:37] people he was able to be in the zone
[55:40] with the Lord living that life of
[55:43] Victory think about it why do people
[55:46] want to glorify brother
[55:49] Brandon he's a sinner saved by grace
[55:51] just like us but because he was able to
[55:56] happened to the holy spirit in such a
[55:58] way that his life was
[56:00] Victorious do you think the devil wants
[56:02] another person like that to deal
[56:05] with uh-uh but I'm sorry to tell him
[56:09] he's got something to deal with
[56:11] nowadays Hallelujah because we're here
[56:13] to exercise
[56:16] thatu Hallelujah we got five people that
[56:19] got cancer whatever you know what God
[56:22] gave us the ability like a Roman
[56:25] Centurion
[56:27] right Lord I know you'll do
[56:29] it
[56:32] Hallelujah we got to get serious about
[56:34] it too got get
[56:37] serious
[56:39] Hallelujah I thought to myself the other
[56:41] day we had 30 straight days at the
[56:43] church we went a whole month every
[56:45] single day at the church praying uh
[56:47] doing something we tried to really up
[56:50] our prayer with it though and we found
[56:51] the Lord really blessed it but but you
[56:53] know what I just came to the idea I'm
[56:55] like man we've tried everything but
[56:57] giving God
[57:00] more you know what happens when you give
[57:02] God
[57:02] more he gives you
[57:05] moreall it's
[57:07] true Hallelujah you you want to see a
[57:09] more Victorious Life pray
[57:12] more you want to see more you want to
[57:15] see more power in your life move by
[57:18] Faith remember John 4 or no excuse me
[57:21] was it James 4 said you have not cuz you
[57:23] ask
[57:25] not when you ask you ask a
[57:28] Miss they're asking to be a millionaire
[57:31] don't ask for that ask like what you
[57:34] want what God wants for
[57:37] you but remember God still he wants to
[57:40] give you what you
[57:41] desire that's right it's one thing I
[57:44] noticed about about John 13 to John 17
[57:47] he said ask for what you will ask for
[57:50] what you desire and you shall have it
[57:53] that that's one of the whole things it
[57:55] says it like five six times in those
[57:57] several chapters he just keeps on
[57:58] reiterating this ask that your Joys
[58:01] might be full ask it I'll give it to you
[58:03] whatever you ask the the the father in
[58:05] my name you'll have
[58:06] it anybody don't want to be there we
[58:10] want to be there
[58:11] amen but he had to tell them
[58:15] ask Hallelujah hey we're just glad we
[58:18] got an an easy day here in that but
[58:20] brother and sister God called us for
[58:22] more than just easy days amen he called
[58:25] us to fight in the realm of the Demonic
[58:29] of the Demonic uh uh fourth dimension
[58:31] and to overcome what the devil's doing
[58:36] amenu
[58:40] hallelujah hallelujah let's read just a
[58:43] little bit more I got to
[58:44] close guess are just easy to preach
[58:47] to
[58:49] Hallelujah he
[58:52] said faith in what he said faith is the
[58:56] Victory faith in what not faith in your
[58:58] church not faith in your Creed not faith
[59:02] in some man but faith in Jesus Christ
[59:06] who made the
[59:08] promise that's the victory what is it it
[59:12] is the
[59:14] victory say my arms still crippled but
[59:17] faith is the victory I still feel sick
[59:22] but faith is the victory oh it over
[59:26] comes the world when you can climb into
[59:29] into God by prayer until you've seen the
[59:32] thing conquered under
[59:36] you remember was it restoration of the
[59:38] Bride tree brother brother Jesse correct
[59:40] me but brother Bram said he said you can
[59:42] pray in such a way that the devil has to
[59:45] give
[59:47] in you can take God's agent the Holy
[59:51] Spirit and enforce a claim on the devil
[59:55] right
[59:59] Hallelujah I might just dance around the
[1:00:01] room I'm feeling pretty good right now
[1:00:04] hallelujah hallelujah hey we invited him
[1:00:07] I'm feeling good Hallelujah so what he
[1:00:10] says there is nothing that can hurt you
[1:00:13] then you've
[1:00:17] overcome so when you climb up in prayer
[1:00:19] and it becomes a revelation it's
[1:00:21] mine right there nothing can hurt you
[1:00:25] then
[1:00:26] watch what he says you got 50 miles of
[1:00:29] Elbow
[1:00:33] Room you're sailing free
[1:00:37] then you who've been a drunkard and a
[1:00:39] slave to Whiskey you'll be a master over
[1:00:41] him then that Old Devil of alcohol that
[1:00:44] made you drink he's your master now but
[1:00:46] when you get Faith I don't mean Make
[1:00:49] Believe real Faith he's your servant
[1:00:54] then hallelujah you who can't lay down
[1:00:57] tobacco you men and women when it comes
[1:00:59] to a place to where you get to that spot
[1:01:01] to where you have overcome it by faith
[1:01:03] you'll Master it then no matter what
[1:01:06] issue it is climb up by
[1:01:11] prayer believing that God will set you
[1:01:15] free amen that God will set your family
[1:01:18] member free he'll set your church member
[1:01:20] free he'll bring the unity in this place
[1:01:23] Hallelujah remember what your Prophet
[1:01:25] said no Unity no power that's what he
[1:01:29] said Hallelujah Living Waters we have
[1:01:32] the same issues same issues I'm sure
[1:01:34] you're dealing with too and it's even
[1:01:36] harder
[1:01:38] now
[1:01:39] why because remember when when Jesus
[1:01:43] went through that last message in John 6
[1:01:46] he had to
[1:01:47] run he had to run the multitudes Away by
[1:01:50] the word of
[1:01:52] God you realize that he said except you
[1:01:54] drink my flesh and or eat my flesh and
[1:01:57] drink my blood you have no part with me
[1:01:58] they're like okay this is a hard saying
[1:02:00] we're out of
[1:02:01] here do you realize he had to get that
[1:02:04] to a place it was in John 13 where he
[1:02:07] dismissed
[1:02:09] Judas so there was nothing but elect
[1:02:12] seed
[1:02:14] left and our Prophet said he had to do
[1:02:17] that because he had to give them strong
[1:02:20] Doctrine oh
[1:02:23] my Hallelujah are you the Alexine
[1:02:26] you can handle that
[1:02:28] word and you can what you can handle uh
[1:02:32] allowing the Holy Spirit to what by
[1:02:36] faith bring the unity that produces
[1:02:38] God's power in this place
[1:02:43] hallelujah oh
[1:02:46] Hallelujah I'm almost done I got to
[1:02:49] stop 1 Corinthians
[1:02:52] 1557 here he goes 55 says oh death where
[1:02:55] is thy sting oh grave where is thy
[1:02:57] Victory the The Sting of death is sin
[1:03:00] and the strength of sin is a law but
[1:03:01] thanks be to God which giveth us us the
[1:03:04] victory through our lord Jesus
[1:03:09] christall death where's your sting grave
[1:03:11] where your Victory what are we worried
[1:03:15] about
[1:03:16] Hallelujah hey we we call potato potata
[1:03:19] out there I don't care if you get a
[1:03:21] Democrat or Republic it's all going the
[1:03:24] same
[1:03:28] why because this is not our kingdom sir
[1:03:31] God's going to change this thing over
[1:03:33] with a son of David I'm looking forward
[1:03:34] to it aren't
[1:03:36] you Hallelujah but he still gives us the
[1:03:40] victory one more quote we'll
[1:03:46] quit Victory Day 63 421 he
[1:03:50] says notice Joshua had a vday at the
[1:03:52] river too Joshua had a vday at Jericho
[1:03:55] he certainly did there where he had
[1:03:59] crossed he had a vday first at the ri
[1:04:02] River V vday Victory Day there he is in
[1:04:06] the month of April probably a mile
[1:04:07] across Jordan was C on up on in top of
[1:04:10] the mountains up there there snows
[1:04:12] mountain and all over the plains the
[1:04:14] river was spread he said no doubt the
[1:04:16] enemy would have said now God is quite a
[1:04:19] general isn't he lead his army right up
[1:04:22] up here to the time of spring when the
[1:04:24] river is the worst which a the worst to
[1:04:26] C time to cross and then lead his army
[1:04:28] up there and lead them to cross
[1:04:31] no God lets disappointments
[1:04:36] happen to
[1:04:38] show
[1:04:41] Victory you ever think that's why God
[1:04:43] lets disappointments come your way good
[1:04:47] if you have faith that's what God showed
[1:04:48] it to us
[1:04:51] forall oh if we could only see that see
[1:04:55] you only see that these things that
[1:04:57] seems to be buring you so buring you and
[1:05:00] upsetting you they are trials they are
[1:05:03] things to stand still Focus your glasses
[1:05:08] on the word of God and speak the word
[1:05:11] and then just walk forward that's all
[1:05:13] there is to it we get to a time we say
[1:05:16] God I don't know what to do I'm up
[1:05:18] against it speak the word Lord I believe
[1:05:22] and just start walking forward God does
[1:05:25] the opening up of the sea you just keep
[1:05:28] walking let's stand let's
[1:05:34] stand
[1:05:44] Hallelujah very simple brother sister I
[1:05:47] hope you're
[1:05:48] blessed but what it really really pushes
[1:05:51] us to do is we have to constantly walk
[1:05:55] before the
[1:05:56] Lord be conscious that we're walking
[1:05:59] before the Lord and be conscious that
[1:06:01] God is in control of all of our
[1:06:05] battles Hallelujah remember when it came
[1:06:07] to the Wilderness God sent his Angel
[1:06:09] before
[1:06:10] them to set everything up for their
[1:06:13] Victory are you the bride of Christ we
[1:06:15] said that yeah I'm the bride of Christ
[1:06:18] then what are these mountains before
[1:06:22] me what are these disappointments
[1:06:25] what are these
[1:06:28] frustrations anybody ever get tired of
[1:06:31] yourself all the time all the time you
[1:06:35] know God lets that disappointment sit
[1:06:37] there why because you got a victory
[1:06:42] coming but it's a
[1:06:44] revelation now I might be crazy in
[1:06:47] saying this but when brother Bram said
[1:06:48] you don't have to
[1:06:49] sin I believe there's coming a time and
[1:06:53] probably I don't know if it' be right
[1:06:54] for the coming Lord or where it's at but
[1:06:56] we are going to become such a Mastery
[1:06:58] over this by the spirit of God is
[1:07:00] pouring
[1:07:01] out that Satan is literally going to be
[1:07:05] like what what can I
[1:07:07] do now think about it he'll prove your
[1:07:10] invincibility he's going to send things
[1:07:12] that look like they can destroy you in
[1:07:14] America
[1:07:15] absolutely just think about what's going
[1:07:17] on in Israel right now you realize for
[1:07:19] the last year Israel's absolutely just
[1:07:22] dealt with blow after blow after blow
[1:07:25] after blow blow after
[1:07:27] blow but what what did God let it come
[1:07:30] to God let it come to the spot enough is
[1:07:33] enough time to going on the
[1:07:36] offensive and they're absolutely tearing
[1:07:39] them
[1:07:40] up that's natural Israel but what about
[1:07:43] spiritual Israel I don't know if your
[1:07:45] battles have been hard the last year or
[1:07:47] too seems like wow he just gets another
[1:07:50] shot here we
[1:07:51] go but God is letting all these things
[1:07:54] come
[1:07:57] Hallelujah showing that they can't take
[1:07:59] you out showing that they can't slow you
[1:08:02] down and even if they are if you feel
[1:08:05] like they're slowing you down you're
[1:08:07] still in the
[1:08:09] race but why is God doing it because the
[1:08:12] season is getting ready for a
[1:08:15] turnaround Hallelujah it could be
[1:08:18] tonight amen but what we're looking and
[1:08:21] saying the Victory Is Ours
[1:08:25] why because he already purchased it see
[1:08:29] God wants us to be more acquainted with
[1:08:30] the
[1:08:31] victory than with the
[1:08:35] defeat remember who's defeated Satan's
[1:08:40] defeated we don't sympathize being with
[1:08:44] the devil in his
[1:08:46] defeat remember every single thing you
[1:08:48] go through it's there to build character
[1:08:50] it's there to prove you
[1:08:53] out I think we're doing all right don't
[1:08:55] you
[1:08:56] depends what you're looking at are you
[1:08:58] looking at the word or are you looking
[1:09:01] at
[1:09:03] yourself because remember this thing is
[1:09:05] such a failure God's going to have to
[1:09:06] change
[1:09:08] it but he gave you the ability to
[1:09:10] conquer this little serpent
[1:09:11] flesh is this Fallen you ain't taking
[1:09:15] this with you your other body might look
[1:09:17] like that but that's this is not the
[1:09:19] real
[1:09:23] you I hate this thing
[1:09:26] it's the greatest battle
[1:09:28] fall but we can overcome it we can be
[1:09:31] victorious we can put it under our feet
[1:09:33] why because Christ paid for it with his
[1:09:36] blood can we be more
[1:09:38] acquainted with the
[1:09:40] blood with
[1:09:44] intercession than this temporal
[1:09:46] world that's the question as we
[1:09:50] close just take a minute and think to
[1:09:53] yourself what if you been affiliating
[1:09:56] with have you been more affiliated with
[1:10:00] defeat depression
[1:10:05] oppression bodily
[1:10:07] issues what or have you been in tune
[1:10:13] with battle and
[1:10:19] victory God wants to Astound you with
[1:10:22] how much of a victory he wants to give
[1:10:24] you
[1:10:26] that's why he brought it brother sister
[1:10:28] I
[1:10:29] appreciate I appreciate your hearts
[1:10:31] being attentive to the word of God how
[1:10:34] many want to live in the
[1:10:37] Overflow Hallelujah that song ain't a
[1:10:39] joke you can live in the Overflow
[1:10:41] remember the scripture he'll pour you
[1:10:43] out a blessing there won't be room to
[1:10:45] receive that's what he wants to
[1:10:48] do I'm just a tail I'm Just a Nobody I'm
[1:10:52] just you're just listening to the wrong
[1:10:54] person
[1:10:57] we are more than Overcomers than Christ
[1:11:02] Jesus
[1:11:05] hallelujah how many want to be more more
[1:11:07] affectioned with this Victorious Christ
[1:11:10] he did this see intercession is Victory
[1:11:12] he's bringing you
[1:11:14] Victory aren't you glad he paid for that
[1:11:17] yes so think about it even now as we get
[1:11:20] ready to
[1:11:21] pray think about an era in your life
[1:11:25] and you you might feel like you're
[1:11:26] getting trampled you might feel like
[1:11:28] you're getting
[1:11:30] defeated it might be something that's
[1:11:32] that's really it's become a real taint
[1:11:34] to your
[1:11:36] faith how many would like to give that
[1:11:38] to the intercessor
[1:11:40] tonight how many like to say you know
[1:11:42] what I'm going to put that in the hands
[1:11:43] of the
[1:11:44] Lord but not just put that in the hands
[1:11:47] of the Lord but say I'm going to put it
[1:11:50] there cuz he's going to bring my
[1:11:52] victory and I am not going to remove one
[1:11:56] iota from that
[1:11:57] Victory remember brother brandom said if
[1:12:00] you want that you have to stay on his
[1:12:01] hands until he gives it to
[1:12:04] you Charles finny talked about in the
[1:12:06] revivals of religion he said he said the
[1:12:08] issue with Christians he says is they're
[1:12:10] praying for too many things at
[1:12:13] once he said and they can never focus on
[1:12:15] one thing they're so sporadic in mind
[1:12:19] that they can't even exercise
[1:12:21] Faith because they're trying to exercise
[1:12:23] it on everything
[1:12:25] and never getting even the answer for
[1:12:27] one
[1:12:27] thing it was quite a profound
[1:12:30] statement because a lot of times that
[1:12:32] what we do oh Lord thank you for healing
[1:12:33] me or and we just move on we never even
[1:12:35] think about
[1:12:36] it there's there's obviously some truth
[1:12:38] to some of these things but when we're
[1:12:40] praying for healing a cancer we got to
[1:12:42] pray for these things are serious we got
[1:12:43] to get
[1:12:45] busy because our God wants to do it do
[1:12:48] you believe he wants to do
[1:12:49] it do you believe he wants to do it in
[1:12:52] you Hallelujah God sees your hearts
[1:12:56] especially towards that statement so
[1:12:58] when the son of man comes shall he find
[1:13:03] Faith what should be your answer right
[1:13:06] now yes he
[1:13:08] will
[1:13:10] me you sister you sister you brother
[1:13:14] he'll find Faith here yes shall he find
[1:13:17] it
[1:13:18] yep amen I'm one of them Hallelujah
[1:13:21] that's right let's bow our heads for a
[1:13:22] word of prayer those things that we just
[1:13:25] talked about maybe there's something
[1:13:26] that's been a great pressure in your
[1:13:28] life but today you want you realize that
[1:13:31] you're maybe like Joshua right at the
[1:13:34] river seems like it's no way to go
[1:13:38] through it especially with such a a mass
[1:13:40] of people or whatever but he decided
[1:13:43] that they would send the ark
[1:13:46] first how many would like to put those
[1:13:49] challenges and just say Lord I'm going
[1:13:50] to put it on the word even now I'm gonna
[1:13:53] believe oh God tonight I'm I'm asking oh
[1:13:55] God that you'd you'd awaken this dormant
[1:13:59] Faith you'd make it active oh God that
[1:14:02] Lord when the word comes I can mix Faith
[1:14:04] with it oh
[1:14:07] God I'm
[1:14:09] believing in some of the frustrations
[1:14:13] disappointments I'm believing that these
[1:14:15] are victories coming and I'm going to
[1:14:17] stand right there with perfect Faith
[1:14:20] that's on your heart today would you
[1:14:23] just pray with me and let's bring before
[1:14:25] the Lord cuz God wants us to have a
[1:14:28] Victorious Life he wants us to
[1:14:31] experience his goodness his power his
[1:14:35] promise the very wealth of his
[1:14:38] existence let us
[1:14:41] pray Lord Jesus as we come to you right
[1:14:44] now Lord just a little simple message
[1:14:46] Lord but Lord
[1:14:48] how if time would allow us we could go
[1:14:52] through even everyone in this room oh
[1:14:54] God and talk about the marvels of what
[1:14:57] you've done for
[1:14:59] us and yet time just continues it can
[1:15:03] wear us down the battles and everything
[1:15:06] uh that the devil brings our
[1:15:08] ways but Lord we want to raise up
[1:15:12] tonight in
[1:15:13] strength we want to raise up tonight and
[1:15:16] defy the enemy of the Living
[1:15:19] [Music]
[1:15:20] God we put a claim on these victories
[1:15:23] even now we're not going to let a
[1:15:27] disappointment become so disappointing
[1:15:29] that we believe we failed we're going to
[1:15:32] put it right there in the intercessor
[1:15:35] who's right there to work out our
[1:15:37] cause we're asking oh God be an active
[1:15:40] God in our lives bring forth the victory
[1:15:44] raise our faith up may we not turn one
[1:15:47] iota from
[1:15:50] believing and may there be great
[1:15:53] testimony to come from the challenges
[1:15:57] that are in our lives may we be
[1:15:59] conscious when we leave this room may we
[1:16:00] be conscious that there's a living God
[1:16:03] going with us helping us overcome
[1:16:05] helping us
[1:16:06] become the
[1:16:08] solution to a Fallen World condition may
[1:16:12] it be so God I pray you just strengthen
[1:16:14] every heart every mind and as the days
[1:16:17] are getting dark May the light be
[1:16:20] getting greater in us we believe you'll
[1:16:22] do it now for the glory in Jesus Christ
[1:16:24] Christ's name we pray amen amen we've
[1:16:27] been made more conquerors invite your
[1:16:28] pastor be happy to pray for anybody oh
