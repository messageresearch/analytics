grace got your bibles let's go to second peter chapter one is don't you knows looking at the mystery of godliness restores man i think it's part 14 you look at charity such a joy to know this message i know what it's like to take summer classes and work at the same time his grace is sufficient in our weakness hoping this message will bring a lot of understanding on love and charity and the holy ghost i really appreciate sister wendy did a great job with that sign over there just so beautiful i really love that stuff let's give her a round of applause that's what christ wants he wants someone like that that he can build up one step at a time until he becomes the living tabernacle of the living god thank the lord he builds his church that way you know this church messenger he wants to know what you and i praise uh god just the scripture let's read verse 7 second peter 1 verse 7 let's begin on three one two brotherly three and to breathing kindness charity let's have one more word of prayer heavenly father we love you we're happy to be in your presence we paid it all you paid all of our sin death so we owe you all the lord it's not by legalism it's by our love yes we'll struggle with the flesh we'll fight with the flesh and the blind sometimes the lord we want to surrender these are times when we can renew our devotion or we can renew our desires and become refreshed and transform in your presence so do that today dear god transform our minds by the renewal of them of god by your holy spirit wash our minds god and let us realign our desires and our focus upon you lord we're so happy to be in your house let your holy spirit have preeminence of god may we give you the preeminence o god may you have your way in jesus christ set my time here i'll try to go 40 minutes i just want to share this quick testimony of this week a church donated uh four thousand dollars to my next book okay so what we talked about the other day so one of the churches donating 4 000 to my next book i got to get it done now i think about all the pressure that puts on me now i just want to share an email we got yesterday on the book a nice woman named rachel she said i just want to drop you an email that you know how thankful i am as a christian wife a mother to read your book i was raised in a baptist church we went through quite a few years of rebellion against god and by faith but because of this i disregarded the issue of women wearing pants and hardly ever wore skirt addressed for years also watching youtube videos on modesty and notice god was starting to convict me about what i wore at this point 98 of my closet is skirts and dresses i hope that two percent changes i got an email for that and i have to come to enjoy shopping for feminine and modest clothing god has put it in my heart where'd that happen where did that come from amen wearing pants and sexy clothes for years but then where'd that conviction come from and i am a daughter of the king of jesus and i should embrace my uh femininity so thank you your book has really opened my heart and my mind that god's leading my life [Music] amen so i said thank you that i said that thrills my heart but i don't even know what i can get gracefully i hope that's encouragement and i just blessed in my heart that somebody would see their life transformed that's why we do it that's why we devote ourselves to the word i know i got a lot of quotes here things like that this is kind of my message for today but it's part 14 of this mystery of godliness so i'm excited i'm excited to see what god is doing and i want to be a part of that i want to do my part praise god i want to labor for the lord there is such a thing as laboratory and doctrine let me know that scripture the bible said give double honor to those who labor doctrine i'm not not asking for your honor but i'm saying that there is an aspect to laboring with doctrine and teaching and god highly values it amen and so i want to be faithful that's what the lord's called me to do which i humbly believe that is i want to be faithful with that and i love seeing testimonies like that so i want to devote this uh service this morning the next uh 36 minutes to uh this idea of we have to understand that the love and the holy spirit are the same thing most people most of us do understand that but i want to just take a sermon and i want to just preach it because i don't know if i ever have but amen have ever do you remember i've dealt with that probably okay now one thing i don't know what i don't think i've ever done is i want to emphasize that this is the one this is uh of course a typed out version of what brother brandon originally drew you can go online and you can see what brother branham originally drew you like with the pencil and a ruler but if you look over there at ours the difference is that brother rams had the holy spirit above broadly kindness but ours doesn't and the reason that is is because the revelation came to brother branham later that the holy spirit is god amen and the holy spirit is love amen and god is love amen so brother am drew this he drew this in october of 1962. and of course you know the seals weren't open until march of that year i'm sorry the next year rather in 63 uh and i mean amen and who are kind of experiencing it but i'll just say in general you know our church gets a little bit of criticism or whatever because of the standard we take with the word right as i told amen and i said that's because we dig deeper in the word a lot of people don't dig down deep in the word and so they would so i would get attacked for taking that out but if you if you keep reading you keep listening to brother branham and then read the church age book you'll find that he unites all those terms he unites all those terms as one term happy birthday brother thank you sir so uh you know you've probably seen it people will attack you if you just say one thing a little different than what brother said in one sermon they'll attack you and they'll they'll say oh he's exalting himself above brother branham no we're not what we're doing is we're gaining more revelation of what he said and then yes the holy spirit then goes back and brings correction to it but that's what the holy spirit was given for amen to guide us into all truth amen okay and so a lot of people have trouble with that that's okay let's pray for them let's be real christians and if anybody differs let's not say we're better let's just say well god bless them amen bless those who persecute you pray for those who despitefully use you or say evil things against you so i want to you know as i was going through this uh chapter that the lord helped me to write i wanted to look at this now so what's that i think um so i want to look at this eighth trait the eighth trait is not i guess it's not a trait it's the ceiling of the holy spirit and uh we know after this comes this this is the ceiling you know uh the holy spirit love is the same thing it's the ceiling it also is the adoption because the bible says the holy spirit you receive the earnest of your inheritance the down payment the holy spirit is the earnest or down payment of your inheritance so with the spirit of adoption the holy spirit is the spirit of adoption and then once you're born again you'll produce fruits praise god and then you become a mature believer with true godliness see the first two stages with faith is the first stage and then these all these attributes are the second stage they can just prepare you for service once you're born again now you can serve amen so church look at your life if you're not serving specifically somebody it's time to check up and say am i born again because the holy ghost gives you power to serve amen because it puts you into service so now you're once you're born again you're actively serving and remember it can be as humble as being a father a mother or a farmer brother man says or a nurse or whatever god's called you to be but you're serving people people by the power of god but i personally believe specifically we should be serving our local churches by the power of the holy spirit amen that's more than coming to church that's part of that that's part of that tithing's part of that but you know finding your gifts i think is a major part of that that's why i'm going to go eventually go back to that purpose series let's go back to the gifts and preach more on the gifts later on because when you're when you're into with the holy spirit these things are just supposed to flow out of you praise god and that they're just now at random times like there may be times you expect it there's other times it may be unexpected uh there may be you know gaps where you don't maybe see a lot but that's okay because that's how a plant is right they don't produce fruit their whole life right there's certain seasons for there's times and seasons but in other words there should be evidence that you are are born again and you're in the service of the lord amen praise god uh so that's what i want to make sure i say that now you and i know the word love in the greek is agape it's the word agape there's four words for love in the greek but this is the only one that's godly love there's three other kinds i forget one's philadelphia that's good brotherly love and then there's the two ones that belong to the flesh it's kind of like there's two for god and two for the world just like there's four kinds of ground right two that are safe two they're lost it's a good it's a good thought and so uh agape is this is what it means it means brotherly love so that's a little bit of carryover it means affection good will love or benevolence so church this has to be a greater love than brotherly kindness because it's the next it's the eighth step it's the ceiling step and it's it's not just temporary because remember this is temporary right this can come and go you can be so in love with your brother but then you can be really upset with your father and i mean in sin i don't mean like you can be angry not sin i mean you you can love them but then be so angry you say evil things against them and hurt their character or gossip right and now that's you lost it you lost it for that moment you got to get it back praise god so see this is temporary but god's love is permanent praise god it's a permanent thing and and one way brother says you know what you've got is you know the holy spirit as love will be quick to convince you that you made a mistake yes and remember terms does that mean and i was thinking about this let me just say this in the name of the lord because the bible says this in the name of the lord the bible said let him that names the name of christ depart from iniquity amen in other words if you are born again you will leave iniquity which is slavery which is purposeful sinning addictions to sin praise god that's why i can say that in the name of the lord if you are truly born again you'll depart from addictions and bad habits you'll this week it's so true it's so true that this is a permanent portion of god's divine love living in you my wife and i were talking yesterday as i was studying martin luther's life oh my you can really see it martin luther's life you can really see how he got tired and at the end of his ministry i was reading and i'll preach on this later but martin luther was such a mighty man of god uh historians say hardly anybody has more books written about them than this man other than christ because church you imagine imagine if every government like your local akron government right ever seen the court everybody seen the courthouse the ohio courthouse he was one man that went and stood up against the spiritual courthouse of that day the pope remember the pope and the state were together so that's why he was such an anointed man he walked up there and he nailed he nailed the 95 thesis on the church door he did it after seeing painful workers walk out and selling indulgences he just couldn't take it anymore he hadn't even got a revelation for about a year about justification by faith he was preaching but after seeing those papal workers all by himself he was all he was all by himself he walked up there and nailed it up there and they put a bounty on his head and then four years later he walked into the diet of worms sitting right in front of the holy roman emperor and he said you need to recant and he said he said my conscience is my god scripture is my authority he said i can't go against any of that and i'm kind of messing up now he said but here i stand so help me god amen amen what a man of god he stood there like a rock of ages amen and the anointing was so heavy on this was the age of killing people but the anointing was so strong the pope and their guys they just they stood there still they couldn't they let him leave and then his friends his own friends kidnapped him keep imagine if i came down they kidnapped me because they knew the pope was going to try to kill later and they kidnapped him and hide him away for 10 months and in that 10 months the first 90 days he translated uh the bible the whole new testament in 90 days ah what a man of god after that he translates the old testament into german he's a mighty man of god but church if you look at the end of his life he hated jews he didn't have a revelation you know why because it wasn't for that day that was for the last day amen the seals weren't revealed daniel said daniel said shut up the book and seal it to the end time amen that fiscal revelation wasn't available in 1520 praise god but it was available in 1963 praise god amen and it remains available today that's why we don't criticize martin luther it wasn't the age of revelation for him for that aspect of the gospel but see you see by the end of his life you know he was very discouraged and tired he wore himself out and he made some bad judgment calls and you can see where he kind of struggled with some of these to put it lightly especially with jews you know i guess i guess you would be that a christian a jew wouldn't be a brother in christ right so i guess he was at the end of his life he really struggled with godliness we know he smoked a pipe and drank alcohol and other things but yet he was so anointed he could stand there and basically given his life for for he was willing to give his life now he did it but he was willing to give his life and for that holy roman emperor to stand for god's word that the just shall live by faith church are you living by faith today not by what you see by what why what heaven declares is truth amen looking at the unseen praise god we're living by the fact that jesus christ sits on the throne of god making intercession for our sins today praise god i don't see that sister whitney and i believe it i do see it with my sixth sense amen amen amen and i'm living by that and that's what martin luther lived by that's what west is about [Music] hallelujah it's such a great mighty revelation but yet he had his faults oh boy he lost some of this too yes he lost some of that yeah a mighty man of god but i love how brother branham addresses it at the end of this this section the church age but i got to read the church's book of life but abraham said martin luther was still used by god he said but god also used the moses a murderer a jonah a willingly disobedient right and he goes through all samson he bought a prostitute look at these men god used it brother madison the ones that were holy were very few and far between compared to the ones that weren't right he said but either way they were all gods they had but he was still god's man of that hour he was still a chosen mess up and he knew what it was to live by faith amen and so church the baptism holy ghost let me get back to that is the permanent portion of god's divine love living in you it's god's own spirit coming to live inside your soul because the bible said god is love now let me yeah show when he's uh yeah i want to show wendy's artwork the comparison so we i took out the love when i saw that because i i knew brother branham thought more revelation later i'm not ashamed of that because it's in the bible praise god i'm gonna prove it to you this morning lord willing okay uh the show quotes holy ghost uh soon i don't think i need to do that okay yeah i want to yeah i want to show this though brother ram says the holy spirit welds the attributes together so the capstone can cap it off so this is brother rams understanding of the previous one okay so brother and describing this in that sermon from october 62 and this is how he says they're different now me reading this i don't see much difference uh and that's because god was going to show later that it was one the same so here's what brother says i'm sorry it's so small he said building this monument i look at the end of the message this statue see it starts off with the foundation so faith virtue knowledge temperance patience scholars brother kindness now what does it do then they're waiting for the head so which is love for god is love the church if you make that if you make god love but then the holy spirit not god boy do you have some troubles you truly have three persons in your godhead now right but see brother i haven't talked when i want you to say why the brother i'm teaching because it just wasn't reviewed yet it wasn't revealed yet see he controls it and he has the strength of every one of those things that's right right here right here you see i got in between all these works in here she's talking about in between brother kaidus and love hear these little waves come what is that the holy ghost coming down through christ see holy spirit the holy spirit is above all this welding this together building a lot a perfect church for the capstone to cap it off okay so whatever says that holy spirit in between was just welding all those other seven pieces together but then the capsule still has to come to cap it off but a few minutes later brother random says the holy ghost is the capstone so see it was just growing he was doing the best he could he was growing so later he said so when you surrender your complete being oh god help us to just do that if we get nothing else out of this god help us to surrender everything today amen surrender our complete me then the holy spirit just pours through you in these virtues then you're a living tabernacle amen now that she believes the word i'm sorry then people will look at you and say that man's full of virtue knowledge he believes the word temperance patience god is brother kindness full of the love of the holy ghost see there he is walking around what is it a statue that unbelievers can look at and say there is a christian there's a man or woman who knows what they're talking about you've never seen a kinder sweeter godlier person you're sealed he's using all these things synonymously or they're all the same thing a seal shows on both sides whether you're going or coming you see the seal just the same there you are when a man or woman possesses this then the capstone comes down and seals them into the kingdom of god which is the holy ghost okay so i just showed you two quotes and one quote he's saying they're different things but a few minutes later he says they're the same thing okay all right so i want to just make sure i bring that up so because we didn't have a minister a couple years ago come and preach how they're different and then a minute amen and i will talk about that got a good question and that's when i preached at one time i know that for sure uh and again we're not saying anything against people that don't agree with us we need to love them praise god they're the ones we should love amen if they disagree with us uh but which have to differ with god's love so there no doubt there's real confusion about the quotes because brother man was constantly learning right so here he says this is uh sorry i changed the color this is a month after he preached the statue of men so he preached it in october statute man then why i'm against organized religion brother graham said i believe martin luther had the holy spirit absolutely maybe not the portion is today because it wasn't given up we've been through this you people the tabernacle here on the blackboard but he did believe to god and he that believeth that everlasting life i never thought there was a person believe that like me but this morning i heard charles filler fuller as i was going down he believes too that the new birth is not the baptism of the holy ghost okay so a lot of people they they take this quote and this is that's all they can see and i said it last week and i said two weeks ago they denominate around that quote yeah church if you grab onto a quote and you can't you can't let go of that when there's further truth revealed to you then you've denominated you'll never grow you'll never stay in love with the word of god because you denominated and you'll see the effects in your life you can't tell me uh uh an episcopalian today as much zeal for christ as we do they can't because they denominated they've limited the holy spirit but if the holy spirit has free course in our lives we should be the happiest people in the world amen amen right i mean it has to happen the holy spirit in our lives has to make a difference there has to be a tangible difference i do it all the time really man when i walk into other churches that don't believe the message i can feel the difference amen and then i come here and i'm so we're so free in the holy in the spirit portion of god's love that's here because we receive more of the word and the holy spirit only backs up the word praise god you see the new birth is being born the holy ghost is the baptist later he mixes it he says this at least six times before the seals i'm not going to go through all them but then he received the revelation after he said now look the church is booked he says in other words to be born of the spirit is to be truly baptized with the holy ghost is one the same okay so this is the church age book uh four years later he or three years later he already he had it corrected at the end of his life what is the baptism holy ghost it's the spirit baptizing the body of christ it is the new birth amen the spirit of god coming in and filling you after you've repented having heard his word that baptized in water as an answer of a good conscious toward god glory now notice this is in uh okay this is a few months after the seals three months after this after five months brother ram uses new birth and baptism interchangeably so but amen i would argue five months after the seals got it already corrected by the grant i would argue that i believe each one of you methodist presbyterian lutheran never had experience the baptism of the holy spirit was in some formal church and did not believe in the genuine new birth and has now received the facts of the holy ghost is a perfect example of a paradox praise god there's more by the token he says when god gives you the true baptism of the holy spirit and the life of jesus christ is within you now that's true in every theologian i have to admit that to be yes sir it's the new birth remember he just said they're not the same right a year two years or year before but now he says they're the same you're born in new the holy spirit because that god has did this and you know you're no good in yourself i thought i heard it i thought i'd hear a little few more amens on that one amen let me read that again you're born into the holy spirit and because you've got to do this you know you're no good in yourself amen and you accept what god did and then he seals you into his kingdom by the holy spirit let me show these scriptures now that they're all synonyms and then our i was hoping uh sister karen would be here because i just want to make a comment about the late perry green he's a he was a tremendous man of god a tremendous man of god now i just differed with him on the church age book i was hoping karen would be here because karen used to sit under him she would here he was her pastor for many years gandhi man i love listening to his testimonials listen to it this morning thanks for sharing the link buddy appreciate that church look at this just look at this for a moment if this doesn't convince us that the holy spirit and love and the is not the same then we've got some real problems right then in other words we're just not reading the bible you know people claim to believe the bible right but if they deny this and i'm gonna show the scriptures that all support us in a moment if they deny this then they're just not reading their bible if they want to believe in the holy ghost baptism different from the new birth that's fine but they are just not reading the bible okay i said i would love i know i'm coming off awful strong today that's because i've been preaching a while i'm really zealous last all week i've been preaching like two weeks happy to be preaching praise god but god is love love is charity god is the holy spirit the holy spirit is the seal the holy spirit is the holy ghost and the holy ghost is the baptism and the holy ghost is god's love amen amen and there's your scriptures if you want them i can email to everybody or text it to you if you want i'm not going to take the time to go through all this maybe i'll do that tonight maybe i'll do this so everybody can have the peace in their heart church god is love love is charity right because love is just another word for agape god is the holy spirit jesus said god is a spirit which one is he he's the holy one praise god the holy spirit is a seal he said you're sealed with the holy spirit of promise the holy spirit is the holy ghost uh that was a good one let's read that though john 7 39 i'm just going to read it out of my bible here and there are numerous examples like one example we're not going to get to is where the bible said and jesus was filled with the holy ghost and the spirit led him into the wilderness was that two persons that he met there or is it the same person same person he was filled with the holy ghost and the bible said the spirit led him into the wilderness it wasn't the devil it was god right god's the one who leads you into temptations right because he loves to see you overcome amen praise god lord john 7 39 look at the scripture but this fake he of the spirit she's talking about the living waters right now look at verse 38 shall flow rivers of living water but this fake key of the spirit verse 39 which they that believe on him should receive for the holy ghost was not yet given because that jesus was not yet glorified so see church the holy spirit is the holy ghost is that two different verses it's the same spirit and jesus said he said i'll baptize you with the holy ghost so the baptism of the holy ghost is the holy ghost and the holy ghost is god's love oh i love this romans 5 5. my this is you i love it they're just it's just complete harmony with the scriptures i just love it god gives all these different ways to look at it romans 5 5 and hope maketh not ashamed because the love of god so there's god's love the love of god is shed abroad in our hearts by who the holy ghost which is given unto us praise god so where'd that love in your soul come from the holy spirit that's what the bible says so the holy ghost is god's love in church once you get here you go right back to the beginning praise god right because god is love never is does that help does that help everybody amen see that's why we have the liberty i'll say like this i have the burden to correct that picture and make it the right way because i'm supposed to labor and doctrine praise god i just don't think it should be done i have a burden to it because the holy ghost is going to teach us all truth amen it's okay people you know okay they don't understand it that's between them and god can they be born again maybe i don't know possibly but church if you are born again you'll be guided into all truths amen there's no doubt about that because that's what jesus christ said where's god now here's the next one who's in you the bible said jesus is jesus christ is in you amen then paul said christ is in you and then jesus said the comforter or the spirit of truth is in you and then paul said the spirit of god is in you then paul said the holy ghost is which one's in your church it's one in the same right amen so here's the scriptures if you want me to send your screenshot i'd be happy to do that i would paul said jesus christ must be in you except you be reprobates see like a foolish person could they backside and become a reprobate right they could be believing for a while like judas and then fall away and become arrested reprobate sorry paul said christ you the hope of glory jesus christ and the comforter will he will be with you and he'll be in you praise god the end of the age paul said the spirit of god is in you you're a temple of the spirit of god today says the holy ghost in the apostle says the holy ghost which is in you now does that help by god's man amen let's meet church the bible solves every problem if there's a doctrinal misunderstanding we just got to study the scriptures and the holy spirit will help us compare scripture with scripture and out of that will come the truth of god's word amen amen that's exactly right so i don't have time maybe i'll do that tonight but there are six great scriptures in the new testament where you can see spirit and ghost of the same thing i gave you that one example jesus was full of the holy ghost and the spirit led them into the wilderness so it's one of the same one the same now here's our precious brother very green which he has helped my walk with the lord very much because i hear his testimonies about brother branham in fact my brother hopefully knows this that book acts of the prophet that's one of the greatest teachings on brother random scriptures i've ever read and he did that back in the 70s so i think he had a tremendous ministry tremendous but one thing i would disagree is that so so brother perry green didn't uh support things in the church some of the things the church and one of them was he says this noah and i'm paraphrasing this because i couldn't find uh i couldn't find the exact quote about that um brother perry basically said no one can get to heaven without the blood so only holy ghost-filled saints are saved you know that sounds all right but now to me i differ on that because i believe the virgin are saved too okay that's what i believe now here's my scripture for because first quotes are good but quotes all have to have scripture praise god so justification is by the blood amen and then faith and then you're justified by faith as well praise god amen the brother says this no yeah here's here's the quote in question we do not need to guess about those who in the second resurrection are given life we're told it's given to them on the grounds they have been kind and good to the brethren those who are raised and cast the lake of fire will be so treated because of their mistreatment of the brethren since this is the word of god we simply accept it there is no argument here just a simple statement of fact so in other words at the day of judgment you have the bride seated with christ behind him right but then you have sheep that are on his right hand that gets saved okay but they're given eternal life they're not in the bride but they're giving eternal life because jesus says they were good to the brethren amen okay and this is the quote they just don't agree with which they don't have to further clarify the words of jesus it does not say that a shepherd is literally separating sheep from goats but as a shepherd dividing sheep from goats these are not sheep in this particular area of time but like judgment the sheep are in his fall they heard his voice the word they found him they already have eternal life and cannot come into judgment but these do not have eternal life and they're in the judgment they're allowed to go into eternal life upon what rounds do they enter life eternal certainly not upon the fact that they already have his life as does the bride but they receive it because they were kind to his brethren they're not his brethren that would make them joint heirs with jesus okay so let me let me say this how many know john chapter 3 says you must be born again so see that's a scripture many will misunderstand but they got to read it carefully he said if they're they got to be born again to be in the kingdom of god so the foolish virgin can be saved but they will not be a part of the ruling kingdom of god they'll have a portion somewhere outside of that kingdom of god but the kingdom and the kingdom means rulership and authority it means those who are ruined unless you're born again you'll not be in the kingdom of god that's right you won't be in the bread you won't be in the ruling body the bride of jesus christ but you still can be saved to me church that's not that's not fanaticism that's god's grace amen amen does that give grace for my my roman catholic grandmother amen who took my whole family in when my dad lost his job and went through bankruptcy amen my widowed grandmother who faithfully cut her hair went to catholic church and went to mass she took in a family of eight to me that leaves grace that the fact that she put a roof over my head when my parents couldn't do it i say god have mercy have grace upon souls like that praise god when was the last time you took somebody in your house not only that but a family of eight and jesus said when you've done it to one of the least i hope i'm one of the least believers when the least of these my brother you've done it unto me praise god so there's a special group of people that get eternal life just because yeah they were good to those brothers i'm trusting in god's amazing grace to me this makes grace more amazing amen hallelujah it makes it more amazing they are not heirs so the bluish birds are not heirs to anything but life they share no throne etc with them their names must have been the book of life and not removed now because of their love of the people of god they are recognized and saved no doubt be served and help the children of god perhaps now that's a key word there perhaps that's the same word i used in my book i don't know we'll get to it but maybe this saturday i think it's in chapter one or i think it's in chapter two in my book i wrote in there i said i believe hindus can be saved muslims can be saved catholics jews you name them i believe god can save anybody that's good to the brethren but it's a perhaps so perhaps perhaps like nicodemus and gamalia camellia never became a christian but yet he stood for the children of god in the time of church my church you tell me you tell me justification signification baptism legos you tell me is someone who's justified do they have the effects of the blood yeah is it the full effects of the blood no but do they do they benefit from the effects of the blood of jesus christ you better believe it because the bible says we're justified by faith we have peace with god through our lord jesus christ much more than being now justified by his blood amen we shall be saved from wrath through him see churches we're saved by grace through faith we we often quote that from ephesians two eight nine and ten right but really paulie then he takes it back further in one of his greatest works he says really when you have faith you're trusting in the blood of jesus christ hallelujah that's what i'm trusting in this morning how many are trusting in the blood of jesus christ that he died for me he died for you and my faith in confidence is in christ amen in other words i heard a brother say it was very great he said now when i get to heaven he said and heaven and the angels brother johnny asked me for my resume i think barry green said he heard a story where he said the resume he's going to give him is jesus's resume amen praise god because i'm not trusting in my marriage i'm trusting in the blood of myself amen how can i get into heaven well i brought my resume uh jesus christ died for me praise god he became my sin that i might become his righteousness it takes all the doubt out of it it takes all the fear out of it because it's not based upon my blood or my effort it's based upon christ that's what martin luther had to restore to the church ages those that were you know trapped in that system there were still believers i can't wait to preach it there was believers all over the it's like the believers were on the outside of the roman kingdom but inside it was a corrupt system and like all the believers were hiding out on little islands in scotland they're out there by the name and they're just having peace and then all those saints were trapped inside just here in latin they're like what are they saying what does he say what are we doing and god had to annoy martin luther right out there he came out of a monk he became a man of god and he started calling them out the script the history says he called he won countless souls for jesus christ glory but god preserved it by having his little saints on the fringes of the european government i'll say it like that oh god is so merciful praise god he hides it from the eyes of the lies and fruit reveals it to vape such as church you tell me it catholic who's saved is he saved by the blood or not yeah yeah number one remember that's why i asked my college coach right before he died did i play you guys i said mr kushner i said are you trusting in the blood of jesus christ for your salvation i didn't say anything about the catholic church on purpose and i knew he only had a few hours or a few days left and i purposely worded it that way so it'd be an easy answer i said are you trusting in the blood of jesus christ for salvation yes yes i believe in jesus that church i believe i'll meet him at that day and praise god there's my 40 minutes so give me five more glory justified by the blood so see denominational people they only accept a portion of the atonement it's just like the the three three three rounds of the tabernacle right outer court blood inner court you have the holiest that's how you have the candlestick and the prayer and the bread right but then you had the life of god in the baptism of the holy ghost and the holy spirit but the outer core was all about blood amen that's what it was all about mercy blood substitutionary sacrifice taking death for us that believers might have life amen the church do you know this i preach on this few weeks blind and jews are saved and given white robes by grace yet they deny they'll deny jesus as the messiah you know they'll just don't deny it till they die yet the bible said god will have mercy on them because he blinded them so if god can have mercy on the blinded uh jews what about the blinded foolish virgin because the god of this world has blinded the minds of them that believe not well let me prove it to you here okay now just so you know i found a quote brother man it's really good brother branham says uh this is okay 10 months before he died he's talking about the church age book with level i'm going to skip to the bottom he said i s he said and my tapes of the seven church agents have sent them to him to grammarize them because my old kentucky get hate and tote and carry and fetch that don't do no good for people who read the books so he was going to grammarize it for me and then after he got through it sent it back a couple of times for more statements so the only reason i'm showing this church is that you know brother branham saw that book more than a couple of times some people will say well brother i never saw you know when it was published nonsense he said i've seen it more than a couple times he knew what was in there he knew it was in there to see people just don't understand maybe they don't study hard enough and they don't pray enough i don't know but i would say like this i've not found one doctor in the church age book that i can't find in his regular sermons praise god and i love this one amen but wait till you get that book you'll understand it if you just got any light in you at all sorry amen if you've got any light of god any knowledge of god amen any anointing of god you'll believe the word of god that's written in that church book catholics are safe i've got plenty for you today i'm going to end with that brother jose you don't believe catholics should be safe oh yeah the graph said they can be saved because the bible says they can be saved praise god the bible says so i believe that a person is saved if he's a methodist baptist catholic or whatever he may be if he's solemnly trusting jesus christ for his grace but if he's catholic and believing the church saves him then he's lost that's why i asked my coach i didn't ask him about the church i started trusting in the blood of jesus christ if he's a pentecost that believes the church saves him he's lost look at that you have tongues you can have shouts and loud noises but if you're trusting in your church you're lost amen but no matter what he is what church he goes to if he is soundly depending on the blood and merits of jesus christ he saved i don't care what church he's in for it's by faith we're saved and that by grace the catholic church a catholic a roman catholic or orthodox or whatever he may be if he's looking to the catholic church for salvation the person's lost if the baptist looked into the baptist church for salvation he's lost if the pentecost is looking for the pentecostal church for salvation he's lost but if the catholic pentecostal baptist presbyterian or whatever if they saw me trusting in jesus christ be saved because it's by faith are you saved and that by grace see catholics can be saved baptists can be saved by the gospels are saved because that we all accept what christ did for us that's right it's our own personal faith and a finished work that christ did for us and therefore i've never drawn a denominational boundary or had a barrier now how many message churches do that only go to heaven if you're part of our message i've tried to reach out and take every one of them in my arms and point them to the cross now i hear you praise god you haven't got no right to heaven do you believe god accepted by the basis of faith upon the shed blood of jesus christ the son of god have no rights for one for no other way no matter you might be a staunch member pentecostal to the core uh methodist baptist or catholic to the core makes no difference what church you belong to if you're solemnly believed on jesus christ and accepted him as your personal savior you're facing him i don't care what church you go to you're saved by faith and without that there's no holy church there's no holy people it's the holy spirit of the people which makes it holy a holy god that lives amongst people what makes the holiness not something that i do something you do or something that we would would have done but it's what god has done for us through christ jesus that's the bible amen now remember you catholic people brother and i'm catholic i don't care a catholic can be saved as anything where are these people getting these ideas from anyway what are they where they get some of these ideas i'm baptist all right well i'm pentecostal a panic also can be saved just anybody else can be but if you haven't got now look at this the token israel this is after the seals hope i'm all about the blood right israel slain lamb was god's requirement jehovah required a slain lamb an innocent substitute as we've been through a week gone by now that god when he makes a decision he never changed it and he made a way his first thing that he did was when man had fallen he had to make a way for him back if he ever wanted to redeem him and made a decision that he saved man by the blood or of an innocent one and he's forever done the same thing he has never changed it no place will god ever meet any worshiper only under the blood that's his only place we try to make it me under theology under our denomination under our educational programs see church that's why he won't meet in a message church just because it's message it's got to believe in the blood of christ amen churches can denominate just as bad if not or more awful amen than other denominational churches right it doesn't matter what the church name is or anything like that it's do the people believe and trust in the blood of jesus amen praise god someone's built towers and someone's built cities battle line tower battle all kinds of different things but it still remains god only makes the true worse for under the blood he never changes it we all can't be we can't all be methodists we cannot be pentecostals cannot be this the other we just disagree but when i came to a man so i come to a man let him be catholic priest the people that are closest to the uh the transubstantiation right the way for the wine or whatever he is when he's under that blood we are care what where he's at as long as let me see what i got here what's that oh let me close this that's that's cool you know people people don't believe in that perhaps quote i believe in it i believe nicodemus will be saved humilia anyone that was good to the brother if the thief on the cross was saved these guys definitely would be saved he was a murderer and then he was mocking jesus when he was first crucified but by the end he had a changed heart the bible said both thieves were mocking him right if jesus saved him without even being baptized then jesus will always be able to save like that now here this is this is not maybe personal for our church it's a very personal subject but just like brother brown said there might be a chance adulterers can go on the rapture people that have been married twice three times how many brothers said that a couple people now this is this is the whole question but brother maryam inserts this whole comment it's a big i'm coming lil graham if a man has been married or divorced he just says how awful that is that's so sad you know he said people weren't taught has been married and divorced and then remarried of a woman who has also been married divorced then married to him these two can be married and god say are they married to god's side how can both or one of them be in the rapture the guy says how i don't know i couldn't tell you the question is can they be in the rapture divorce each one of them divorced each one of them has a living companion then they married again both them married again and now this this woman has a living husband this man has a living wife now they've got children and so forth want to come to god can they go in the rapture that'll be up to the heavenly father i couldn't answer that but he said i'll say or i saw one thing the bible said they should be called that they that become doctor the bible said doctor will not inherit the kingdom of heaven let's see that's a little clue to me church if the kingdom of heaven is the ruler rulership hierarchy i hate to say it like this but so you understand the elite christians you never understand they're just they're just more dedicated christians they just love god more right a doctor will not inherit the kingdom of heaven but man use this scripture it says perhaps they can be saved that's all i can say i know that just kills me to say that but i can't say what the word says he says i can't say but what the word says i must stay with that i hope that's all wrong there's places now look what he does there's places in the bible i'm not advising you but let me just give you a little scripture remember brother branham had a church that was full of people married to him they were full because people weren't taught the right way my brother had said they also didn't pray about it hard enough right so he's trying to be very gentle see sometimes he can be so hard right you know and then sometimes he can be so gentle he said please though if you're living happy with your husband and living happy with your wife please remain that way let's go for it preach american divorce you preach that february 65. because i told you don't leave them little children without a home god is made now look he says god has made restitution and places for people that did things wrong you remember jesus said of dave when he was hungry he entered the temple of god eat the shoe bread which was only lawful for the priest and it was found blameless so david entered into a a a position that wasn't his and ate a food that wasn't his by the word but yet god had mercy on him the priest also blasphemed the sabbath upon the sabbath day are found blameless and the greater than sabbath was here see let's just leave it up to god and go ahead and just live just live for christ now he says you might have made mistakes in the past he said leave that up to god he said but live all you have right now for jesus christ right now let's see their might so see i use the word perhaps perhaps gamalia nicodemus perhaps maybe might the doctors might be in the rapture they might there might be a chance of you hitting it don't make two wrongs never make the right one just go on and live the way you are if you're happy together you might have the wrong companion i'll say this one thing if you got the wrong company of this this wife in this life you'll never have in the other one all wrongs will be made right let's stand on our feet now church i have all those quotes um i preached this in 2016. brother ram over and over and over again says that he said is that people just make a few they misunderstand a few quotes so see church see see how the we have to make sure and i don't know i'm sure prairie green didn't do it but i know there's people because i've talked to i know there's people that say there's no salvation outside the message if you do that you're cutting off you're saying they don't even have access to the blood of jesus christ you just drew a circle around yourself in your church and that's it the brother man always tried to make the circle bigger even for something like adultery which it would seem like they couldn't but he said perhaps just live for god with all your heart musicians if you'll come we'll sing a couple songs you can go ahead and turn off the live stream just so i don't forget where he's gone now george was this was this helpful today my gosh grace i want you
