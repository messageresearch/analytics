to be the leading raise God aren't you looking for that meeting let's give the Lord another round of applause amen praise God thank you Jesus praise God let's take our Bibles here I like to start a little bit earlier tonight by the grace of Lord let's go to Revelation chapter 8 I like to look at the book of Revelation series I'd like to preach chapters 8 & 9 tonight Lord willing by the grace of the Lord well it's good to be back together we sure missed everybody on Sunday we enjoyed that little live service there in the basement that was a real blessing and good to be back with everybody so thankful everybody safe you know we're very thankful twice I almost got and it's right well one time almost fell on my face slipping on the ice today thank God he protected me there and their time almost slipped off the road about three four times and it was just the hand of God so I'm very thankful you know we just said you know I take it for granted and I just want to say thank you to the Lord Jesus he's truly mercy truly has rewrote my life amen I definitely can see that today Revelation chapter 8 verse 1 so let's start verse 1 I just like to read verse 1 and then we'll just pray and then we'll get right to the word I like to get through chapters 8 & 9 Lord willing tonight chapter 10 is pretty familiar to us maybe look at that next week or maybe Sunday we'll see how the Lord leads revelation 8 verse 1 let's read verse 1 together on three one two three and when he had opened the Seventh Seal There was silence in heaven about the space of half an hour amen let's have a word of Prayer let's bow our heads as we go before the Lord here tonight Heavenly Father were grateful for your mercy we grant grateful for your grace thank you Lord that there's going to be a meeting in the air Laura let us have those white wedding garments on which our eternal life the righteousness of the saints by the washed garments by the blood of Jesus Christ amen in other words Lord let us wash away every sin through your blood dear God granite Lord may we be ready for that meeting Lord God whether we Lord have to go to the grave or whether Lord we'll be able to cheat death Lord we'd say defeat death and just be changed the moment wink of an eye let us have clean garments Lord spotless a white washed in the blood of I am Lord God that's what we desire tonight and God just speak to us through thy word Lord God give us grace to present it Lord God and father just add the blessings of the word to our hearts we know the book of Revelation says you're blessed to hear it and keep it oh god help us to eat here tonight and key to Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless should be in Cena praise God so I do have some quotes here I like to show tonight now we're getting into the spot of the book of Revelation where this is the Tribulation Period we're getting very close and we'll look at that here tonight and and brother Branham as you know he talks about a lot in the Feast of Trumpets and also recognizing it's a day in it's message your Danis message from 1964 if you listen to those quotes are those sermons I listened in the last few weeks brother Branham says he was trying to get up meetings set up for the trumpets and the vowels and everything like that and he said he just couldn't figure it out you know everything was falling apart he tried to rent the gymnasium the High School gymnasium it fell through tried to put up a tent that fell through and he said he got real sincere he went into prayer he said well he told his wife I'm going in to pray and he said the Holy Spirit revealed it to him that these things don't pertain to the bride and he'd already supernaturally preached them when he preached the sixth seal so we're getting to the spot now in the book of Revelation from the eighth chapter to basically the nineteenth chapter where a lot of this deals with the Tribulation Period so tonight especially as we look at verse eight and nine I'm sorry chapters 8 & 9 rather a lot of this begins dealing with that and so brother brand didn't preach a whole lot on this but I've tried to pull out everything I could find out about it and place them together so we'll start looking at that by the grace of the Lord so this is part 1 of chapter 8 and maybe just a chapter 8 and 9 and may just be you all one part together because like I said the brother man never preached extensive services on these and so we have more or we have a lot less to go on but by God's grace we still want to preach it my desire churches to preach all the way from revelation 1:1 to Revelation 22:20 1 that's my desire and so then you've heard the whole Council of God a member there's blessings to here and blessings to keep it and we need to hear and we need to keep it tonight as well by God's grace so let's look at this here now revelation 8 1 of course is the seventh and final seal now remember the order of the seals is different the first four are going on are the first three are pass we're under the fourth right now I believe and as soon as the rapture goes the rapture is the seven so it kind of gets out of order as far as chronic chronic chronic Redonda chronologic Ronna logically there we go chronologically forgive me chronologically so you have four then it skips to seven seven the seventh seal is the rapture and then it goes to number five because during the rapture I'm sorry during the great marriage supper before Jesus comes down the soulsand the altar cry out how long Lord brother branham said that that's during the Tribulation Period because the the Lord will tell the Jews wait a little while your brethren have to be martyrs have to give their lives for a little season which that season is a three and a half year Tribulation Period and then so it goes for seven five and then the final one is six we'd say but remember the whole time after the rapture after the rapture goes the seventh seal the whole time from the rapture unto the Millennium is considered the seventh seal because remember brother Branham tells us the seven seals the end of all time he says the end of history he says the end of struggling nature so the seven seals is this little time period from the time of the rapture all the way through the Tribulation Period until the millennium breaks amen so it's quite a it's quite a thought so the first three are gone or I've already passed we're under the fourth seal once the seventh seal breaks is this big long time period and in that you have the fifth and sixth but if this whole time period is the seven seal so that's what brother Branham teaches now if you would like I have I have all these on youtube so if you haven't watched these they don't these revelation ones don't have many views compared to like the high heels that's got almost 4,000 over 4,000 views I think people aren't really looking for revelation anymore you know they're not really searching for the book of Revelation a lot people are searching for more like sanctification issues which is okay you know but I want to have videos out there to teach everybody the revelation God gave brother Branham to us so if you want to see these next these next two chapters they're already on there if you like to watch him and you haven't watched them you go back over in fact I had a brother call me this week and he thanked me for making these videos he said my my children had questions on on the seven seals and and so I took them to the videos and it really helped them and and questions on the Godhead and they really helped them so I said praise the Lord they've been doing they're their family Bible time and they've been looking at some of the video so I thought well thank the Lord it's helping people grow and Grayson and knowledge of the Lord one other family the mother said we watch your videos all the time while we're doing laundry I said that's a good thing to do is here just just always meditate upon the things of God always have the word of God or worship always have God on our hearts and minds now I want to just say this here now I teach that the first verse and some people don't some people don't teach this but I do teach that the first verse is the moment of the rapture because what brother Branham says here he said because the Seventh Seal There was silence and he says no one knew that was the minute or hour that Christ would come as he revealed it to us so program said it was already past tense that God revealed that the seventh seal was the day in the hour the very minute that Jesus Christ would come back for the bride so that's why I believe a revelation 8:1 is the rapture it is the moment where our bodies are changed in a moment and a twinkling of an eye I believe that but of course you know I'm not going to get an argument with people if they want to believe something else this just when I understand about it and now cook because earlier 1960 but Ram said and Jesus comes from heaven with ten thousand times ten thousand of saints and the Bible says the heaven was empty for a space of half hours there's that half hour silence again where's this big fellow God Anna hunt he said he's in Christ so when heavens empty and their silence in heaven in Revelation 8 1 I believe its Jesus's body his corporal body coming down to the skies to meet his wife in the air that's what I believe about Revelation 8 1 like I said I could be wrong but that's my thought on it because those quotes now let's look at verses 2 to 5 2 to 5 is the preparation for the seven trumpets to blow it's the preparation for them look at verse 2 so after the seventh seal opens then I saw the seven angels which stood before God and to them were given seven trumpets and another angel came and stood at the altar having a golden censer which of course we know is that the container that carried the incense right for the prayers or for the incense that would burn when the high priest would take that sensor you had to have that sensor and it had to be smoking before I could go into the Holies of Holies and there was given a name much incense that he should offer upon offer it with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne so there is a golden altar of incense before the throne of God in heaven amen remember there's a there's a rainbow round about that throne and there's four beasts there on that throne and there's four and twenty elders around that throne that's a pretty that's a pretty full throne don't you say hey there's a lot of the things there now seven angels come and stand before that throne and they get their trumpets ready to sound alright verse four and the smoke of the incense which came with the prayers of the Saints ascended up before God out of the Angels hand so now this incense is coming up out of the Angels hand so we know something's moving here something's happening here verse five and the angel took the censer and filled it with fire of the altar and cast it to the earth really strange here so heavenly fire now gets cast to the earth fire is gonna fall upon the earth interesting and this is before even the the trumpets have even blown yet which is pretty striking and I can't explain that I'm not even sure what that fire is right there but fire holy fire from heaven is sent down to earth after the Saints are raptured and there were voices and thunderings and lightnings and an earthquake now brother man told us what those I'll represent lightnings thunderings earthquake he said that represents judgment so this is a time of judgment right verse 6 I'm sorry let me stop it fine yeah let me 7/5 now I put some notes up here after a silence begins all the prayers of the Saints are being made ready to be answered so God is going to all these prayers are going to be poured out in heaven so all the things that people have been praying about all the things people are wondering about all the requests that have made known to God are now gonna be answered amen they're all gonna be answered praise God revelation bourree is the last time and I'm sorry 8:4 forgive me it's 8 for ya it's not for 8 it's 8 for revelation 8 for is the last time the word prayers mentioned the Bible amen hallelujah and that great alright it's the last time this last time prayers mentioned is when all the prayers are going to be poured out before God in other words Jesus has stepped off the mercy seat he's coming got his wife and all those prayers are in heaven are now being poured out there's no more time for prayer right the Gentiles are cut off there's no more more mercy for them the foolish version they got to give their lives during the tribulation right but Jesus has left and now judgment is going to get poured out Jesus is meeting his wife in the air and heavens getting ready for the judgments there's lightnings thundering voices all the prayers are going to be answered think about it all those prayers from Abraham mine the job and and Moses all these prayers of the saints now after six thousand years they're all going to be answered God heard every one of them and he kept all of them and they're now gonna be answered amen what encouragement God here's all of our prayers amen God keeps him in these golden vials in heaven see are your prayers precious Church you bet he's putting them in golden containers but see you got to be what you got to be a saint because it's the prayers of the saints we don't want to be aints we want to be saved is that right but man said that woman that that you know married she'd been married to you four times she married a brother and brother and the brother said brother Branham you know God told me I could marry her brother man said no he said the devil gave you that dream he said that sure sounds sweet but God didn't tell you to marry her she's already married three or four times and programs tried to tell the man he said because the man said oh she's a saint and brother branham said not if she's been married three or four times she's not a saint she's a hain't or she's a ain't she's not a saint because anyone who lives in pleasure while they're alive are dead while they live amen and the only hope they have is that the white throne judgment that Jesus would pull up and say oh you did something good enter into the joys of the Lord because you treated a Christian good oh I'm the one that he's surprised at the day of judgment I want to know what's gonna happen to me praise God I won't let my slate clean I want all my sins forgiven because there's gonna come a time when the Lightning of thundering is gonna be ushering in heaven and all I want to be with Jesus during that time amen I don't want to be left behind I want garments that are white praise God amen oh my oh and as I was saying on Sunday this my wife and I were just talking did you catch it on Sunday I don't know if you got a chance to livestream our service or not but sexual sin and marriage was so important to God that in the Old Testament remember God wouldn't let these bastards into the church for 10 10 10 generations that's how important it is to live pure sexually before God and before you make a decision on marriage as I tell the young people cuz it'll just be a blink of an eye and they'll be getting ready to get married here as sad as that is as hard as that is to believe but keep yourself pure make sure it's the will of God when you get married amen because God is gonna hold us accountable for these decisions and it's so important praise God that we make sure we do what God has called us to do amen but the last time prayers' mentioned is here when the prayers are being poured out did you know we're gonna get to this did you know that heaven is rejoicing while the Vatican's being destroyed did you know that church it makes me want to cry that's it reread that revelation or you can get ahead of me a little bit but the Bible said the Saints and the angels are rejoicing in heaven while the Vatican's being destroyed because of all the idolatry the wickedness did I tell you I found an article two weeks ago remember in Pennsylvania when they had that investigation last year and a thousand people were reported as being abused by the priests in Pennsylvania shortly after that I found another article now people are coming forward that the nuns abused them sexually girls and boys and so what they find is that the deeper they dig the more they get in there the more evils in there and churches so incredibly sad but what does that produce what the the DNA of the church is is is corrupted right they're not believing on the promises of God and because of that any little sin any unbelief like the Trinity or any trend transubstantiation any of those little beliefs in eventually when they accept that lie they accept other lies and the end of sin is death amen that's right the church as time goes on we see more and more and more all these seekers Jesus and every seeker will be shot it from the housetop and it's no wonder that the saints in heaven will be rejoicing when destruction is going on it's hard for us to understand because church we don't really have divine love fully all the time do we like brother and said we have human compassion but we don't have divine compassion all the time I know that's hard it's hard for me to understand I I have trouble with that too so the last time prayers mentioned is right here 8 verse 4 the smoke of the incense which came up with the prayers of the Saints that sent up before God out of the angel and mercy look at revelation 85 and the angel took the censer filled with fire of the altar and cast into the earth and there were voices thunderings and lightnings an earthquake now I want to look up some more verses about voices and thunders so as I said heavenly fire is cast to the earth after the rapture I'm not sure what that is because it's before the trumpets there's fire involved with the trumpets but I'm not sure what this fire is but the Bible said they took the fire from the altar and it was cast to the earth so they're gonna be some type of burning even before the trumpets now we see these same words in Revelation 11 9 this is under the seventh and final trumpet which remember there's even worse things after that with the seven vials the trumpets are before the vials right so under the seventh and final trumpet there's both voices and thunderings just like a revelation eight five and the Temple of God was opened in heaven there was seen this temple the Ark of his Testament and there were lightnings voices and thunderings in the earthquake and great hail remember revelation 11 19 is right after the three I'm sorry the two witnesses are raptured up to heaven we'll get to a little bit more on that so we see all these times where there's lightnings thunderings and voices it's always judgment it's always God pouring out his wrath upon unbelievers we see the same thing in revelation 16 verses 17 and 18 when the seventh angel poured out his vial here's the seventh vial into the air and there came a great voice out of the Temple of Heaven from the throne saying it is done and there were voices and thunderings and lightnings and there was a great earthquake such as not since men were upon the earth so mighty an earthquake and so great that might be the Los Angeles one we're not I'm not sure now under the seventh this has the same with both voices and thunderings as revelation 85 so again we see this on we see under the seventh trumpet and we see it under the seventh vial which is just afterwards one after right after the other and we see it won't our time now look at this this is this applies to us now revelation 19 and the voice came out of the throne saying praise our God all ye servants didn't either fear Him both small and great and I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude and the voice of many waters and the voice of many thunderings saying Alleluia for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth let us be glad and rejoice and give honour to him for the marriage the lamb has come and his wife has made herself ready I so heaven is rejoicing because his wife has made herself ready ha ha Alleluia remember that in Hebrews 11 church that the Saints cannot be perfected or completed until we're completed that's three - you got your Bibles go to Hebrews 11 in other words they're waiting on us of course there have entered into eternity a little bit but still they're waiting upon us they the body of Christ cannot be complete until every member is there even had their way to go on us Alleluia that's right the end of Hebrews 11 here yeah now now let's go to verse 38 1138 of whom the world was not worthy of all these persecuted Saints we looked at persecution last week they wandered in deserts and in mountains and in dens in the caves of the earth and these all having obtained a good report through faith received not the promise God having provided some better thing for us that they which without us should not be made perfect so all these Old Testament heroes they never receive the fullness of the promise so what's he saying the promise of course is the baptism of the Holy Ghost Colossians 1 said that's the promise that's been hidden for ages it's Christ in you the hope of glory amen so we have something so great we're not greater than David but we should have greater power than David amen that we can slay the temptation of adultery or fornication he couldn't slay that but we should have the power to slay it amen who would you rather slay a giant this song Goliath all way up here or would you rather slay the demon of adultery hallelujah or the demon of murder the demon of lust which one would you rather slay I'd rather slay that spiritual enemy hallelujah because my bat is not with flesh and blood it's against spiritual wickedness in high places and God makes us put on the full armor of God that we can be overcomers amen but see they can't be made perfect without us the body of Christ cannot be complete until that we are there as well amen see that they kept me made perfect without us we can't be a complete body until we're all together praise the Lord hallelujah now I looked up lightening an earthquake as well the second woe the Bible says in Revelation 11:14 is past and behold the third woe cometh quickly and the seventh angel sounded this is the seventh trumpet and there are voices in heaven saying the kingdoms of this world to become the kingdom of our Lord and of his Christ and he shall reign forever alright now the next one yeah the next versus okay already read this one right yeah the temple of God was open there was lightnings in the earthquake after the seventh trumpet so the seventh trumpet is connected to the third woe and also to the seventh vial they're all connected because they have these lightnings thunderings earthquakes it's it's in other words its judgment at the throne of God that's right now let's get your let's go back to Revelation 86 here revelation 86 I was in Hebrews 11 let's go back to Revelation 86 oh don't you want to be on Jesus's side Church during this yeah when I we're not read this brothers and sisters it just shakes me when I read this to see this is what God is gonna do to those people who won't they just won't repent the Bible said still while the while they're hiding in caves they still repent of worshiping idols and statues and you name it money and all these things and sex and all these things that they're worshiping they still won't repent how blessed you are if you can just say Jesus forgive me change my life help me to never do that sin again amen how blessed you are because these people will not do it they won't even apologize even the myths of sing all the plagues follow the hail fall the earthquakes the lightning they go hide and run in their in their endtime caves or whatever they have right our last days where they got food stored up in water what good is that gonna do that when the Bible said the face of the Lamb is gonna be staring right at them amen what good is that it won't do any good the thing to do is look in his face right now I say Jesus I love you forgive me hey that's the thing to do is being peace with Christ right now 8 6 and the 7 angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound now from 6 down to 13 is the first four trumpets so let's look at these here for just a moment now I just want to make sure I put this I tried to change the colors a little bit because remember brother Branham when he preached the Feast of the trumpets he said they that he was not preaching the seven trumpets the Feast of Trumpets are not the seven trumpets tonight I'm preaching the seven trumpets tonight okay so he says the Feast of Trumpets are two prophets calling Israel to the feast that's what brother Graham said and this is different than the seven trumpets it's different so here's what I mean this right here is the Feast of Trumpets and on the spiritual timeline this was Pentecost the day of Pentecost here we are we're right here right before this arrow we are right at the coming of the Lord and the Feast of Trumpets begins the three feast the Day of Atonement and the Tabernacles now program said this is the two prophets calling Israel to love Christ the Day of Atonement is where Jesus Christ Himself reveals himself to the 144,000 right and they're forgiven and they get the baptism Holy Ghost and the Feast of Tabernacles that's all of us in the Millennium amen hallelujah Israel gets a build houses I believe we'll be with our husband Christ amen amen so now you know prophetically so the rapture is right here the Feast of Trumpets is the the three-and-a-half year Ministry of the two prophets calling them the Day of Atonement is 144,000 being born again and Tabernacles is the last one that's the millennium amen because buh-bam says now in the homeland waiting for the Feast of Trumpets or the recognizing the atonement and to wait for the for the coming to mourn for their rejection of the first time that they rejected it they're in the homeland for that waiting what are they all everything is positionally placed now look what brother who says now I hope this doesn't confuse you but there's quotes her brother Ram says on both sides in some quotes he says that the feast some of the trumpets have already blown and then quotes like this he says they're still waiting on the Feast of Trumpets so just so you know I'm not saying I've got all the answers I'm not patting myself on the back and say if I've gotten greater revelation and all these preachers out here I'm not saying that what I'm saying is that to us these chapters here are actually minors that's why I thought I'd get through two chapters tonight because they're not the major ones the major ones are the first six chapters of Revelation those are the major ones because if we miss that we're going to miss all the other ones program says you got to know the church ages first then you know the seals then the trumpets and the vials and everything like that thereafter so see this is not our major but we got to preach it so we can be prepared amen so here bear says they're waiting for the Feast of Trumpets that that to me means the first one hasn't even blown yet now here's three reasons while I don't even think the trumpets have not yet sounded and now here's the ears here's the funny thing I have quotes on this side that let's say the trumpets have it sounded well you had you can find quotes that say the trumpets have sounded but I believe personally that they've not sounded okay if you listen to a feast of the trumpets though you're in here brother branham say that some of them have sounded now they may have but I just believe from some of the other quotes he has that they have it sounded okay so there's every understand I'm not saying I'm smarter I know anything about it this is just the only way I can see that it actually meant to me it makes sense okay but I could be wrong but either way Church if you're in the if you're born again the Holy Ghost you're not going to see any of those trumpets amen how do you know yeah that's the main thing the main thing is have the token and then you've got the ticket to know everything's going to be all right amen Gloria now the first reason is program said over and over again the two prophets call Israel to the feast of the trumpets and the two prophets haven't even arrived yet so how can all the other trumpets sound if they haven't even started calling the trumpets yet because they have to call Israel to the feast of the trumpets and here's her brother ham said it I'm not I'm not gonna inject any of my thoughts I'm just showing that there's honestly quotes on both sides and that's why I just I go on this side where I don't think the trumpets have sounded yet as administer the gospel I can't see one thing left but the going of the bride and the bride has to be taken away before they can recognize what's happened they were bound scattered I mean they were scatter blinded and now gathered speaking of the Jews what's left the bride to be taken another way waiting for the going of the brides of their prophets of revelation 11 can call them to the feast of the trumpet to make them recognize what they haven't I'm sure what they have done everybody who says Israel or the bride won't be here during the sixth seal so these two prophets call the trumpets or gather them for the trumpets right and then the bride won't be here during that sixth seal then we have then I don't believe the trumpets have sounded yet because they can't even sound until after the bride's gone and then the two prophets arrive you see these things that were now in that we're studying right now the sixth seal is after the church is gone see these things are the Tribulation Period I think that ought to be selling to every believers heart that this church never takes a tribulation period you cannot put the church in tribulation or the bride now you see we're close to that hour now it could be any time because the church is just about ready to take its flight amen but remember when these things happen the sixth seal the bride won't be here just remember the bride's gone she'll have to go through any of at the time this is a time of tribulation of purification of the church it's put upon her to go through it but not the bride he takes his sweetheart out of the way he's done redeemed her thank of the Lord amen that's the first reason mother man says let me go back there the first reason I want to mix it up the two prophets call them to the trumpets and the two prophets haven't even arrived yet so how can the trumpet sound when they haven't been called to the Feast of the trumpets all right number two every trumpet sounds under the sixth seal my brother Adam says it's over and over again and then in the same sermon he says some of the trumpets have sounded so I'm just doing the best I can and remember that 60 we're all seven trumpet sounds under that sixth seal when we get to that then you'll see every seven trumpet took place in that sixth seal ok says it pretty plainly now let me say right here that every Trumper that blow blowed under the sixth seal we'll get to that in a few minutes where we caught it on the tape all the trumpets sounded under the sixth seal he said but every trumpet sounded under the sixth seal under the persecution of the Jews all right so can everybody see that it looks like all the trumpets are under that sixth seal well the sixth seal doesn't happen until the two prophets come on the scene and interrupts nature so how can the the trumpets have sounded yet when the tribulation hasn't happened yet and he says they all blow or they all sound under that sixth seal so that's my second reason I don't think any of the trumpets have blown yet woes and trumpets take place during the last three and a half years so says it's repeatedly that the woes and trumpets take place in the last half of Daniels 70th week remember a week is seven years Jesus Christ started preaching he preached three and a half years and that was the first half of the 70th week there was 69 weeks and then Jesus Christ started preaching he preached three and a half years that was the first half of the love the last 70th week so this is in 1961 I'm gonna skip down here see he says we must stop and explain why these 70 weeks because if you don't you'll miss those seals you'll miss the trumpets you'll miss the vows those plagues those three unclean spirits like frogs those three woes the casting out of the red dragon the woman the son you'll miss it off you don't call if you don't cause it takes place right here in this 70th week and remember right now we're in the time of the church ages so the 70 weeks of Daniel our pause there on pause God put it hit the pause button praise God God pause that he's pulling out a Gentile bride to himself once he takes her in the air that he's gonna hit unpause now in closing the seven seals the seven trumpets seven by oh three woes woman the sun casting on the devil the red dragon comes between these times during the Great Tribulation Period don't forget it he says so to me the trumpets can't even blow until it's the Tribulation Period that's what I understand but you have quotes and mother RAM says both and in Revelation 11th chapter these two prophets they prophesy 1203 and threescore days 3 and 1/2 years still promised to Israel when the Gentile bride is gone so as long as the bride is here they're still three and a half years left to the the Jew and it's not gonna start until the bride is gone now this is what I believe is a misapplication I believe the trumpet takes place after the sealing of the 144,000 okay so let's read the fifth trumpet you got your Bibles let's go to Revelation nine all right so let's go to Revelation 9 now I want to look at let's look at verse 2 and he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the Sun and the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit and there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth and unto them was given power as Scorpions of the earth have power it was commanded them that they should not hurt the grass to the earth neither any green thing neither any tree but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads and to them it was given that they should not kill them but that they should be tormented 5 months and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when he striketh a man all right so this is the night I'm sorry this is the fifth trumpet and these demons come out like scorpions and they torment people for five months now let's look at this here since the fifth trumpet hasn't sounded yet although many think it has because one quote us where brother Branham said the woes are World War one in World War two all right so there's one quote where brother Branham said the first woe is World War one the second woe is World War two and then he makes a like a statement that the third woe is World War three that's kind of what he makes it sound like now go to Revelation 9 12:1 woe is past and behold there come two woes more Hereafter ok so this is what we're saying here so do you catch it the first woe is after the fifth trumpet is everybody catch that and what do they do they torment everybody who doesn't have the baptism of the Holy Ghost so this is why I don't believe the first woe is World War 1 because if the First World War was World War 1 then that means this would already be in the past the Scorpions already came out for five months and they stung everybody who didn't have the baptism of Holy Ghost at church I just don't I don't I don't see that I can't see any time where you know they had cameras during World War one yeah world war 1 right so I can't think of any history that proves that scorpions came out during World War 1 ok for 5 months I just don't see that but that's just my opinion that's just my thought I could be wrong so see I don't believe the 5th trumpet is sounded yet because I just don't believe it because the prophets haven't come yet and because we there's no record of anybody being stung for five months I just when I believe Church brother branham said the lows were World War one too in 1954 and he never said it after the seals or anything it was just a one time statement but P there's certain people I've heard them preaching the message which that's fine they're allowed to their entire their own interpretation I'm not exalting myself above them but I don't see how it makes sense because the FIR if the first woe was World War 1 then where were the scorpions where where's the history proving that that for five months everybody without the back Holy Ghost was scorpion it was ever I understand that so I don't see how the fish C or fifth trumpet could already blow and if if World War if it took place during World War one and there's no record of scorpions stinking everybody without the Holy Ghost all right so hope that's clear I know we're getting little we're getting down pretty deep aren't we you're pretty deep in these but advanced again you get up to your elbows and honey I've never really got up to my ankles and honey ever before but I got up to my ankles and snow this week but but not honey but when your the things of God is like honey you're after yellows and honey I know we're pretty deep but I'm just trying to rightly divide it to you now see Bob Arum says here's the quote here now look church is 19 and 50 for the RAM says the first one see there's three woes the first one happened in World War one the second one happened in World War two so you see what we're going in now we're at the end time now remember Rome and ER that this after this said it again but people will hang on this quote they'll make everywhere does say the Lord I believe that's wrong Church I've said preach out before I'll be let's make it I do out of brother branham I believe that's fear and I believe that's a sin that if that sin lays in someone's life that that false interpretation it will produce other sins in their life that's what I believe because any unconfessed sin will ultimately lead to death if it's unconfessed that's what I believe I could be wrong but that's what I believe so if you think this quote is true that you're welcome to believe that I'm not trying to discourage your faith but that means because the first woe is revelation 912 then you have to show somehow through history that verses 1 to 11 happen during a five-month period during the world war 1 you have to prove that ok and I just can't I've looked I've tried I've looked into history I can't prove that that God protected only the Holy Ghost filled what year did that end wasn't a 1918 mauka I didn't World War 1 ok so you have like a lot of history you could go when it start in 1915 14 ok so you have of 1914-1918 have four years there and a five-month period from 1914 to 1918 this would have to be fulfilled scorpions had to come out of the earth and sting everybody without the baptism the Holy Ghost okay so I hope everybody just trying to understand I'm just trying to make it as plain as possible tonight this makes sense Church okay all right now recall the first trumpet let alone the fifth cannot sound until after the 144,000 are sealed by the Holy Ghost so this is another proof not only do I see how the fifth seal could not have sounded or the fifth trumpet rather the first trumpet can't even sound until the 144,000 are born again and that's in Revelation 7 we preached this a few weeks ago remember he said hurt not the earth and then they're gonna seal 144,000 with the seal of the Living God hurt not the earth the trees till we have sealed 104 sealed the servants of God in their foreheads the first trumpet can't even blow until the 144,000 are born again so how can the fifth trumpet have already blown when the first one hasn't blown yet because there they go in order and the hundred 44,000 aren't even on the scene yet because the two prophets aren't on the scene yet because the bride's still here amen so see I just I just disagree humbly I just try to be humble and remember a revelation 8:7 it's under the grass trees are hurt during the first trumpet which would be after the 144,000 are sealed the first trumpet can't even blow until the 144,000 are sealed then the earth a third part of the trees are burned up and then all the green grass is burnt up can you imagine that nothing about that church what was the last time you looked at Google Maps did you look at Google Earth lately and see all the green all over the world all the green grass is burnt up under the first trumpet all of it can you imagine that all the green grass so the whole world is going to look like this a hare desert from Google Earth and that's just the first trumpet and some people are saying well the fifth trumpet already sounded you know the locusts are out the world is World War one not all the green grass was burnt up in World War one Church there's pictures to prove it so see it just to me I just I can't make eye I just think brother Branham was just he was just doing his best and then of course he never said later cuz it wasn't I don't leave it was God's revelation revelation 9:1 and the fifth angel sounded I saw a star fall from heaven unto the earth and to him was given the key the bottomless pit and it was commanded then that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree but all only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads that's under the fifth trumpet so it looks like if there's all the grasses burned under the first and then here it says hurtin off the grass of the earth or there must be some green things left because the Bible said don't hurt the grass nor any green thing there still must be some green thing left even on the fifth trumpet but all the grass was burnt under the first trumpet interesting all right now the second implication is the sixth trumpet containing the woes has not sounded yet okay so the sixth trumpet let's go to revelation 9 is a 6th trumpet now here's what I found by reading the Word of God the first woe is under the fifth trumpet the second was under the sixth trumpet and the third woe is under the seventh trumpet that's what I can find in Scripture alright now let's look at the sixth trumpet here now go to verse 13 and the sixth angel sounded I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God saying to the six angels have the choice the four angels which are bound in the great river Euphrates on that ought to make a little bell go off you've heard that before the angels in the river Euphrates right the demons in the river Euphrates right what message was that from Feast of the trumpets now and the four angels were loosed which were prepared for an hour and for a day and for a month and four year for to slay the third part of men so when these demons get loose of third of the men now the population is 7.2 billion right now so what's the third of that right it's over two billion people so when these demons are loosed on the river Euphrates - over two million people die now look at verse 16 and the number of the army the horsemen were two hundred thousand thousand and I heard the number of them now Church I'm not being critical a brother branham please understand me I'm not but I just if you listen to the Feast of Trumpets brother Branham said that these demons have already been loosed and they were loosed upon the Jews now that may be I'm not I'm not saying for sure but remember this is under the sixth trumpet and if we just how v hasn't been opened yet nor the first the first can't even blow into her the 144,000 get the baptism of the Holy Ghost so I'm just saying many think the second woe which was the Second World War and the 200 million demons have been loosed but it just doesn't seem possible to me because the first one hasn't even happened yet the first trumpet can't even blow yet until the bride goes a to trip retreat or trooper two prophets arrived then 144,000 get the Holy Ghost now the first trumpet came blow that's just me I could be wrong so revelation 8 6 to 13 was the first four trumpets now let's read that let's go back and read that let's go to verse revelation eight six okay and the seven angels which had the seven trumpets prepared themselves to sound the first angel sounded and there followed hail and fire mingled with blood and they were cast upon the earth and the third part of the trees was burnt up and all the green grass was burnt up that's the first trumpet all green grass has to be burnt up verse a and the second angel sounded and as it were a great mountain burning with fire was cast in the sea and the third part of the sea became blood so a third part of the oceans right became blood under the second trumpet now some people like I said I already said the fifth sounded and then the six so that this has already happened to them a third a third of the ocean has been blood and it's never been taking a picture of I I just can't I I can't understand that verse verse nine and the third part of the creatures which were in the sea and had life died and the third part of the ships were destroyed some people say this already happened I just don't I can't see it I don't think it has yet because I don't think the hundred forty-four thousand Jews have been sealed by the Holy Ghost yet that's just my opinion alright verse 10 and the third angel sounded and there fell a great star from heaven burning as it were a lamp and it fell upon the third part of the waters and upon the Fountains of waters and the name of the star is called wormwood and the third part of the waters became wormwood and many men died of the waters because they were made bitter that was the third trumpet and the fourth trumpet sound in the third part of the Sun was smitten and the third part of the moon and third part of the stars so as the third part of them was darkened and the day shone not a third part of it and the night likewise that's the fourth trumpet so some people leave this already happened well when was the time where a third of the sunlight was missing I don't know and I beheld and heard an angel flying through the midst of heaven saying with a loud voice woe woe woe to the inhabiters of the earth by reason of the other voices of the trumpet of these three angels which are yet to sound all right now Church what's the order of the Tribulation Period now to me this is just my thought and of course you're free to disagree but from what I've just read you know from these quotes it seems like first is the rapture of the bride of Jesus Christ then after the rapture now one thing I forgot to put on here is the building of the temple I believe they're gonna have to build the temple before the rapture that's just my personal opinion because a temple is gonna take a quite a while to build I believe we will see the building of the temple and I believe that will raise our rapturing faith that's what I believe because as soon as the bride goes then God's back to the Jews and that clock starts ticking he presses unpause and now they've got three and a half years the two prophets rise on the scene so the bride goes up and the anointing two prophets come down amen the Poynting comes down a part well I believe they come from heaven I believe it's Moses Elijah I leave when the bride goes up will be waving and they're going Moses and Elijah coming down I don't know if we'll see him or not but it's going to happen because right now they're in heaven amen is that right they met Jesus on Mount Transfiguration when the bride goes up I imagine will just breeze right past them go right past the Milky Way say see you guys may the Lord bless your ministry I know you will in the head but I believe when the bride goes up they'll sign that seven-year peace treaty but there's only three and a half years left because the Bible said he breaks the covenant in the myths of the week the Bible says that in Daniel 9 so I believe it's going to be a 7-year covenant but it's not going to make it all the way so then the two outfits will minister for three and a half years the Bible said they'll close the heavens and it won't even rain for three and a half years can you imagine that not going to rain for three and a half years and then you have them calling Israel to the feast of the trumpets to get ready for the Day of Atonement amen hallelujah for the forgiveness of sins through Jesus Christ the day there was free and now they have an atonement between them in God amen then I believe that 7-year covenant is broken at the halfway point when they kill the two prophets and then at that point I believe the two prophets rapture three and a half days later three days later rather they go up to heaven the two prophets go up and then Jesus Christ comes back and he reveals himself to the hundred 44,000 they'll mourn the Bible said they'll mourn and cry I go from house to house but then the Bibles to the next day a nation will be born in one day praise God oh they're gonna feel so bad how can we crucify our Messiah but now there is say o Moses and Elijah preach about him there he is it's got to be right the lawgiver is pointing to the the fulfillment of the law Elijah the prophet of the Gentile or the prophets of Israel is providing to Christ that's got to be him and we live and forgive us fill us with your Holy Spirit amen we've kept all your word we've we've got the tempo even making sacrifices we've kept all the word oh we we need to be born again and God fills them with the Holy Ghost they get the seal of God in their foreheads the Bible says then church after that once they get the 144,000 get the Holy Ghost now now how the trumpets can sound because the servants of God have been sealed in their foreheads now I could be wrong on that that's just my thought I cannot understand how the trumpets have already started blowing when Israel hasn't even gathered by the Feast of the trumpets to Christ yet how can the seven trumpets blow when the Feast of Trumpets hasn't even started because the two prophets haven't started calling Israel together yet to hear the preaching on the the Messiah now I could be wrong but that's just my thought all right no revelation 9 will go a little bit further maybe give me about 15 more minutes here we'll finish up by God's grace now Church this is what I was telling you remember a few year or maybe last year remember how I was telling you I had put feast of the trumpets up on a shelf you remember I said that and I told you I was gonna have to go back to it well I went back to it I listened to it over and over and over again I've taken these notes and this tonight is what I've come up with this is what I believe I believe according to author C brothers program s quotes on both sides then it just shows maybe God wasn't dealing with him so I just got to choose the sign I think is right I can't see how all these trumpets have already blown when the 144,000 don't even have profits yet and they're not even warned again yet I just can't see that so that's why I take this this stance at it by God's grace okay revelation 9 now the themes of this chapter are the sounding of the fifth and sixth trumpets and the passing of the first row and we've read a lot of this already the fifth trumpet brings torment only not death and it's on the earth for five months upon any person who does not have the seal of God or the baptism the Holy Ghost in their foreheads which means every one that is not one of the 144,000 Israeli believers will be torment and that includes foolish virgin as far as I understand unless they're already hunted down by this time I'm not sure all right get through here all these okay so we read than the chapter nine I'm sorry we read started we started chapter nine let's just go through a little slowly here verse one and the fifth angel sounded I saw a star fall from heaven upon the earth and to him was given the key of the bottomless pit and he opened the bottomless pit and there arose a smoke out of the pit as the smoke of a great furnace and the Sun the air were darkened by reason of the smoke of the pit and there came out of the smoke locusts upon the earth and unto them was given power as the Scorpions of the earth have power so locusts come out of Hell right in the bottomless pit and the their power verse four and it should be commanded that they should not hurt the grass of the earth neither any green thing neither any tree but only those men which have not the seal of God in their foreheads so see they they ran from God for so long they spit in God's face so long what is God gonna do God is gonna send bounty hunters on these people cuz I just say it like that God is gonna have these locusts hunt them out see because God was trying to push them into his presence and they kept pushing God out so now God's like well well they have judge of the day of mercies past because you pushed me out I'm gonna chase you down do God doesn't play around and children God's not playing around with you God's not playing around with me God is trying to drive us we've got to let God's angels drive us in the presence of God I know yeah something is driving you you're being driven by something today brother Ram said right remember garnet peak polio drove drove him to Christ amen let's let God take the events in our lives and let's let them drive us closer to Christ if not God is going to chase us down and make us pay for it because all those times can you imagine every morning by there God lovingly whispers in there there there there it won't you just go to church today won't you just read your Bible don't you just surrender won't you just accept love in your heart and so you don't hate so at the Holy Spirit is constantly working and it's just like the days of Noah the Bible said every thought of every man's heart was only evil continually and finally got to the point in the tenth generation number 10 10 is the number of worldliness finally got the tenth generation God said fine I'm taking my hands off this I'm not even gonna strive with man anymore I have tried for these ten long generations if they won't receive it then fine I'm sending to the flood and look Church he was even merciful so merciful he had Noah preached for 120 more years after he said that the sons of God saw the daughters of men and God said this agrees in my heart I've tried 400 all these six or 600 years whatever I've done there I'm sorry 2,000 years and God said fine see he has so much mercy doesn't God but but there's a limit to God's mercy there's a limit and if we don't accept it if we don't let God chase us in his presence he's gonna chase down all the disobedient I know about you but I want the Holy Spirit to kind of push me Jesse come on go to church Jesse come on read your Bible I'm tired Jesse come on I say thank you lord later on it might be hard at first I'll say thank you Lord for or give me that little nudge thank you for driving me thank you for allowing these trials and pressures to drive me in your presence because once I get in your presence there's fullness of joy amen it might have been a rough day but once I get in God's presence there's fullness of joy fullness of love fondness of a hope there's everything we all need up in God's presence that's right thank you Lord for driving me in your presence yes praise God hallelujah okay verse 5 and it them it was given that they should not kill them but that they should be tormented five months now look at that five months of torment now I've been reading job I'm in job chapter 19 I'm in reading - every day chapter a day job suffered for months he had suffered months so here's five months I don't know how many job job just said months at the end of these months his three friends came and when they looked at him they fell down and for seven days straight they just cried looked at this man and then they start condemning him I've been reading that too and jobs like don't condemn me I haven't done anything wrong and I surely you're a wick you've got a wicked heart and all these things that job's like I don't have a wicked heart I'm pure before God months months of torment five months and were finishing verse five and their torment was as the torment of a scorpion when he striketh the men I've never been stung by a scorpion I've been bit by a snake though one time it was through a glove and it didn't hurt too bad he can't latched on to the glove and I had a little bleeding under that but I never been stung by is anyone ever been stung by a scorpion how did it feel anybody okay no all right so no witnesses of scorpions here we don't want to be stung by a scorpion we want to be sealed by the Holy Ghost and those days shall men seek death now look at this God will not let suicide be an option there's no there's no suicide available because my RAM said they're gonna be insane they're gonna be so insane they can't even take their own lives for five months I see some people believe this already happened I don't think so I mean people are still committing suicide I don't know in those days shall men seek death and shall not find it and shall desire to die and death shall flee from them because of these locusts these scorpions tormenting them and the the locusts were like unto horses prepared in the battle and on their heads were as it were crowns like gold and their faces were as the faces of men he met picture that a man's face on a horse and a tail sting you like a scorpion now look at verse eight now this is crucial for our sisters and they had hair as the hair of women and their teeth as were the teeth of lions now this is what I even shared this I share my book I'm almost ready it'll be out in about a month I shared this book with a minister the minister said Wow brother Jesse I never saw verse 8 verse 8 defines hair length for women it says hair of a woman well if you go out to the Walmart tonight what's the hair of women most women have hair right here and you know they're older they you know they get their perms what's the hair of women well according the Bible the hair of women is long uncut hair if you read first Corinthians chapter 11 so to torment them for five months God sends the horses that have faces of men and their hair is long like a woman's and brother Bram said that's a torment then because they let their women cut their hair it's they're gonna be tormented for five months you should have obeyed the Bible why don't you men cut your hair why did you let you I'd you let your sons have long hair like a women and for the women why didn't you cut your hair or why don't you let your hair grow long the Bible says God never asked a godly woman to cut her hair and now we think oh it doesn't matter what's your hair yes it does because God is going to allow this fifth trumpet to show all the sinners that long hair was the hair of women amen people say oh it doesn't really make a difference it doesn't make a difference the Bible said it's a shame to your head right it dis honors your head and mother BAM said I just listened to it on the recognizer natives a message whatever have said if you're dishonorable he said then you're filthy right so a woman that'll cut her hair must have some filthy type of spirit order because she the ones that dishonor her husband right and that dishonours Christ and that dishonor is the invisible spirit God so it's a chain events like it's a domino effect you dishonor your husband at dishonours Christ that dishonours invisible spirit God and their teeth Reza's teeth of lions said the lion teeth right nose real sharp teeth hair face like a man and long hair like a woman to torment these unbelievers for five months and they and they had breastplates as it were breastplates of iron and the sound of their wings was as the sound of chariots of many horses running to battle alright so they have wings as well verse 10 and they had tails like unto scorpions and their strings in their tails and their power was to hurt men five months and they had a king over them now who's this King Church brother man tells us and beats the trumpets who is the king out of the bottomless pit Satan which is the Angel of the bottomless pit whose name in the Hebrew tongue is Abaddon when the Greek tongue hath his name apollyon that's bromances that's the devil he's the king of all these demons the angel the bottomless pit and then look at verse 12 one woe is past and behold there come two woes more Hereafter five months of torment the they wouldn't take the baptism of the Holy Ghost my all were such a privilege people praise God amen thank the Lord hallelujah so God gives to all these men that grew their hair long or didn't preach the gospel and um preach this that God gave a natural godly hair covering for our sisters right every long uncut hair represents every every word of God in here all right so girls you understand that when a girl cuts her hair it's like taking this Bible and cutting out the Bible can you imagine doing that that's what it represents when a woman cuts her hair it's like ripping this out you imagine somebody ripping this out yeah that's what it represents when a woman cuts her hair she doesn't need that she doesn't need to obey every word of God she can just cut this Bible and rip it up and throw it around that's God's holy word right the Bible said add not don't take it away or else should be called a liar the Bible says all right praise God let's finish up here now verse 13 that was the fifth trumpet sixth trumpet I read some of this earlier and six angels sound and I heard a voice from the four horns of the golden altar which is before God saying to the sixth angel which had the trumpet loose the four angels which are bound yeah we read this now skip down to verse 16 and the number of the army was the horsemen was two hundred thousand thousand that's two hundred million and you'll hear brother man I mentioned that on the Feast of the trumpets and I heard the number of them and I vest saw the horses in the vision and then that sat on them having breastplates of fire and of Jacob and brimstone in the heads of the horses were as the head of lions and out of their mouths issued fire and smoke and brimstone and these three I'm sorry by these three was the third part of men killed again two billion people two billion people are going to be killed under the sixth well round two million under the sixth trumpet by fire by smoke and out of the brimstone which issued out of their mouth Wow by the fire so they're the the the these two hundred men demon powers gonna breathe fire and burn up two billion people my goodness for their powers in their mouth and in their tails for their tails were like on the serpents and had heads and with them they do hurt verse 20 and the rest of these men which were not killed by the plagues yet repented not so they see this going on and they still won't repent they still won't say god I'm sorry see Church we're getting to a spot I know it's hard don't you want to see more people saved uh I want to see people say I cry repeatedly saying God save people why aren't more people getting saved but the same time we this cup of wrath has to fill up fewer and fewer people are gonna find this and we should just be thankful we should keep throwing out the net but we should just be thankful when we can repent because even the midst of the destruction and persecution and judgment they won't repent thank God that we can repent tonight amen because they won't even repent after seeing demons burn up with fire their friends and their family burn up right from they still won't repent cuz they just hate God like these people today did you see New York pass that law yesterday New York pass a law they can now do abortions in the ninth month the ninth month of pregnancy they can and what kind of demon power is in these legislators some of the most awful wicked demons there and that you should see if they're all shouting and rejoicing and the mayor of New York says we're gonna put this pink billboard out there it's a victory for women it's a victory for Hell's what it is that's right just happen yes today just put on Facebook today I just make makes you what a cry thank God for the few victories that have happened out there I think Indiana got a victory on an abortion and they're limiting it even more and more thank God for the few victories my goodness because it'll be a witness against him on the day of judgment if they're so hard harder they they'll kill little babies like that no wonder they won't repent when they see all this happening they'll see this burning up of two billion people they still only repent because their hearts are so hard they're so far from Christ oh God thank God for a heart that loves Jesus Christ amen thank God for a heart that loves life and the creation of Almighty God it repented not of the works of their hands that they should not worship devils see that's what they do when they worship when they do that abortion they're worshipping the devil's of death the devil's of lust and selfishness well we can't have a baby we don't can't afford a baby they're worshipping the devil and people say that the message how can we have more children have enough money you're worshipping the devil amen they exist because they love the things of the world more than they love the ways of God they should not worship the idols of golden of silver and brass and stone and of would neither which neither can see nor hear nor walk neither repented they of their murders there's the abortion right there nor of their sorceries 61-million i think it was no it was a 41 million babies last year were aborted 41 million won every 24 seconds the article said and no wonder God is just gonna let these beasts run out there and kill a third of all men because almost a third of them are guilty of killing babies murderers and heaven is saying thank God when this is going on heaven saying hallelujah God's holiness and righteousness was right God's ways were right the Great God and judge of the earth he getting vengeance because all these years or other the Saint said I'm not gonna take vengeance I'm not going to go burn down an abortion clinic vengeance is mine saith the Lord and we had to control ourselves right we have to control ourselves and not go crazy see that happen to almost made me angry when I read that today about the New York legislature just makes me want to like grab somebody other air air to just just want to go meet that mayor and but I've got it I've got to crucify that and say vengeance is mine saith the Lord amen and then God will take vengeance upon these people we just got to pray God help some of them to repent and come to God save what you can because this is just like Sodom and Gomorrah if you can save dad in New York I know more than 10 in New York that got it so whatever you can save in New York saving because there's a good Church in New York there's a ruger Church in New York but don't you see Church don't you see this neither repented they of their murders nor their sorceries nor of their fornication nor of their thefts let's say into our feet by God's grace now I know I preach tonight but that's the Bible Church remember what brother may have said he said the church ages are necessary to understand the revelation for other ages come the seals and other seals come the trumpets and now the trumpets come the vows now church this is what it this is what I believe I could be wrong but I believe since God has shown me the right interpretation of the ages and seals now we can understand the trumpets that the trumpets haven't sounded yet because we rightly understood the church ages we've rightly understood the seals and now we can rightly understand the trumpets that they haven't blown yet the first one can't even blow until 144,000 are sealed by the Holy Spirit in their foreheads I believe God has given us that understanding he said like the first burst of a roman candle the church ages come forth with a mighty initial lumination without which there could be no further light thank God for the light amen we'll walk in the light such a beautiful ride amen but the brands of the seven church age is given by divine revelation light upon light follows until the whole the revelation opens wide before wandering eyes and we edified and purified by its fear are made ready for his glorious appearing even our Lord and Savior the one true God Jesus Christ amen thank God for the light hallelujah thank God for the light of the church Ages praise God thank you lord praise God now here's here's why it's important that we understand the trumpets brother Branham said the businessmen which is a bunch of Pentecostal people they say glory to God then preachers go and just sit stir the crowd and say there's coming a great revival the hand Lord is going to be upon the earth and how the people are going to be going forward like that and don't realize that's under the trumpets of Israel so do you see what he's saying here preachers are going around denominations saying there's gonna come a revival you can't tell me it's not I've heard so many say it I hear preachers all the time you know sometimes I'll watch him I like a lot I watched our videos about teaching I'm trying to learn about numbers and they'll say there's coming to revive when the people get so stirred up and brother Graham said it's because they got the revivals mixed up 144,000 Jews they're gonna have revival amen they're gonna get the Holy Ghost amen and then their trumpets are going to sound but see programs and their preaching that there's coming a revival but they're preaching that it gets because they don't understand the trumpets they don't understand that there's got to be the 144,000 that's the revival then the trumpets come so what are they doing they're giving people false hope I've seen services like that where the preacher the Pentecostal preacher will say there's kind of revival everybody says yeah ain't it huh and they go out and they let them keep sinning and see this is why it's so important to understand the trumpets and the seals and the church ages because the preachers are preaching promises that don't pertain to them they actually pertain to Israel that's why the trumpets are so important well brother just why would you preach it so you don't so you and I don't believe the wrong the wrong scriptures we have to believe the scriptures that pertain to us does every understand that's why it's so important that's a brother and says they don't realize that some of the trumpets for Israel why do they do it is because they are Christian professors and don't realize neither did Caiaphas's realize what he's doing and they don't realize that they're rejecting the very message that God sent to them what is the message Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen and everything in the Apostles faith is for going on that's the message but the preachers are preaching that they're you know the the denominational preachers the message preached preachers are thank God but the denominations that are preaching about this revival to come and the signs and wonders and miracles that's for the Jews not for them their revival is with us they should be with us right over there those those Pentecostals should be right here we we are the revival amen and if you listen to this message I just listened to yesterday and today I listened to it while shoveling snow last week for four hours the first time was two hours a second time was two hours I listened that whole message twice brother Branham says it in there that this is art brother man said the bride he said why do they why these preachers say revivals coming fast and pray fast and prayed he says because they haven't recognized the awakening of the bride amen the bride is awake in church remember we breached it we're not sleeping we're awake we're trimming our lamps and we'll get ready to go meet Christ amen the bride is awake but the denomination's can't recognize the message so they're preaching revival services for the trumpet scriptures for the Jews and it's all because they Rebecca rejecting the very message God send them they'll say and I've been getting emails people say well brother Branham he was a prophet but he got off on the the serpents eating all these things like that and brother Branham said what a what a disgrace to a prophet how can you call him an a prophet and then say he got off the Word of God if he was a true prophet and a genuine prophet then he stayed with the word amen he said what a disgrace what a slap in the face oh he calls me a prophet he believes in my healing gift we don't believe in my teaching and he said let anyone hear you brother innocent let anyone and you get your Bible come stand before me and show me where I'm wrong on the serpent seed show me where I'm wrong on the Godhead cistern and we might have seen I've been posting on the Godhead brother Aaron for 26 days in a row and I had a brother two years ago a Pentecostal brother two days ago rather he said well Jesse he said you sure defend your views pretty well he said in 30 years I believe in the Trinitarian stuff I've never heard what you preached and he said I'm no longer calling myself a Trinitarian and I'm just pulling out the things roadman said and I knew I had felt the Lord to start doing that I knew I felt I just you know I just took a little while to he did that call 30 years he never even knew the lies and now he has enough sense to know I'm not a Trinitarian he said I believe in the father's only ghost but I'm not insurance here and I said well thank the Lord for that not banal Rob and said see brother man said Satan will slip that Trinity line there to make you and I dollar because you believe in three gods so thank God just got delivered from idolatry whether he knows or not tape it and let's say the tribulation happens in his life he'll know not to go with those Trinitarians hopefully by God's grace think of that 30 years being a denomination and never knew until some small little idiot humble little preacher puts it on Facebook and shows I'm showing eight reasons why the Trinity is wrong and he got it on the fourth one it only took half of him well I wonder what the rest of what we'll do for him by God's grace if if half him let him out of there maybe the rest will lead him into the message I don't know I doubt it but we'll see who knows it's very few that find it look at that when truth is presented and there's a true child of God the children of God love the truth all right now how you come to the come to the piano now Church the only this is where I thought we would take this service let's offer up some prayers of the saints can we do that tonight again I just thought you know this this this these scriptures don't really deal with us by God's grace we already be at the marriage supper of the lamb while all these trumpets are blowing but it's our job to offer prayers right now prayers for mercy prayers for change lives prayers for deliverance it's our job to offer
