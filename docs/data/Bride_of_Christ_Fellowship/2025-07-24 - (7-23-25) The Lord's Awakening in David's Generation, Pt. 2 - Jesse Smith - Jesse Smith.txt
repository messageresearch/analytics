TRANSCRIPT
========================================
8 verse 65. And I'll try to I'll try to preach kind of short tonight. Um Malachi Rod gets up at 3:50 or 3:45 a.m. So I'm trying to shorten my sermons so we can get home a little sooner by God's grace. &gt;&gt; Yes. Oh, that's right. That's right. Hallelujah. God bless you. and you did it faithfully for decades, brother. So, God bless you richly. Psalm 78 uh 65. Now, here's a beautiful scripture here, and we saw it on Sunday. God wakes up when you wake up. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; God will wake up in your life when you wake up in your life. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Verse 65. Let's read that on three. Ready? One, two, three. Then the Lord awaken as one out of sleep and like a mighty man that shoutth by reason of wine. May the Lord add his blessing to the ring of his word. You may be seated. I'm going to take or I'm going to take my liberty here and try to preach about 45 minutes if that's possible. So hallelujah. Now, we know this is about David because later later on down in verse uh uh 68, he talks about choosing the tribe of Judah. And then in verse uh 70, he chose David from that tribe. Hallelujah. And then he fed the people of God. And I love verse 72. How many enjoyed that preaching on integrity on Sunday? Verse 72. For he fed them according to the integrity of his heart. Integrity means innocence. In other words, obedience. Hallelujah. And God will honor a man or woman who lives in integrity. I just read it again in Job uh 1 and2 this week. And I I'm going to try to get a sermon of all the people where the Bible called them men and women of integrity. Hallelujah. Because God God calls Job a man of integrity. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And here God calls David a man of integrity. There was times when they were they were they were giving all their diligence to live a life of integrity to obey all the word of God. Verse 72. So he fed them according to the integrity of his heart and guided them by the skillfulness of his hands. Hallelujah. Now I'm just going to briefly review because I got a short time. But before David, the Bible told us in Psalm 78, the Israel rebelled in the wilderness. They set up idols as well. And then the Bible says that uh the ark was captured, right? Uh by the Philistines and Saul failed as king. Now, at the end of the service, we're going to look at how Saul treated the ark or the ephod. Now, you might be familiar with that, but it was a good review. It was a good review for me today as I was studying. And so, that what that's what caused God to go to sleep. So, church, if we let idols in our life, if we rebel and disobey the word of God, God will go to sleep in our lives. Now, we know he never slumbers, but it just means he won't move in our lives. He'll hear less of our prayers because we've disobeyed the word of God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And we lose the prince of God. That's why David said, "Restore the joy." Right? That's a joy is an anointing of the Holy Ghost. Restore the joy. Take not your Holy Spirit from me. Praise God. So for us, we don't need a physical ark. We know our heart is the throne of God. Hallelujah. Our mind, our human spirit is the throne of God. This is the throne God wants to sit on. He wants to sit on the throne of your spirit and your soul. That's right. So, what did David do? David uh overcame Satan. Hallelujah. David restored the ark. David established unified worship of all the tribes. Hallelujah. He brought a national revival. He expanded the the territory of Israel. Hallelujah. To what uh it was promised by Joshua that Israel had never accomplished. So David was so obedient that God woke up and started defeating all the enemies. How many remember uh how many remember how many uh victories he won? 14. Four. At least 14 victories record in the Bible. Saul only had five. Now, if we thank God for five, five is better than zero. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But if 14's possible, church, let's believe that God will do what's possible in our lives. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Let's not fall short of God's glory. Let's give everything we can so God can be fully glorified in our lives. Amen. I don't want five victories. I want 14. Hallelujah. Or as many as God can give us. Hallelujah. And then we looked at David's nine examples of having integrity versus his seven examples of having iniquity. And then we looked at and we close with how brother Ram said the bride has been awakened. Well, church, if the bride's been awakened, that means Jesus is awakened in your life. &gt;&gt; And I'm going to show you tonight so you can know how God's awakened in your life. I'm going to show you through many many well I say many many but lots of New Testament verses. Brother Random said that he said uh in back in his day in 1964 people were saying fast and pray something's going to happen. But brother Brandham says why are they doing that? They're good people. He said they haven't recognized the awakening of the bride. &gt;&gt; So the bride was awakened through the ministry of William Brandham. &gt;&gt; That's what all the dictionaries and the encyclopedias say. His his ministry was the spearhead that went into the heart of America and really the world after World War II. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. It was the spearhead that led the charge for supernatural. Amen. For miracles, for signs, wonders, for discernment, and also for thus sayith the Lord. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right. And uh so now get your Bibles handy here by God's grace. We we finished the service on Sunday with 1 Thessalonians 5. We read the whole chapter. But go to 1 Thessalonians 4:3. We read in 1 Thessalonians 5 that we will be awake. We are children of the day. We are not children of the night. We are not going to miss the rapture. We're going to have our eyes wide open for the rapture. Praise God. &gt;&gt; We will see Jesus. Hallelujah. How many believe that? By God's grace. &gt;&gt; How do you know? Because your child of the day. Look at verse three in 1 Thessalonians 4. For this is the will of God, even your sanctification, that you should abstain from fornication. You're going to see this, church. Your sexual purity is one of the biggest indicators that you're awake. Amen. That God is awake in your life. If you can live sexually pure, God will wake up in your life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. It's one of the biggest indicators that God is living in your life and God's not sleeping. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now go down to verse five. Not in the lust of concoctions. Now that word means craving. So see again, if we're if we are constantly giving into lustful cravings, we're probably asleeping on God. And so God's sleeping on us. &gt;&gt; But if you keep your body pure sexually and you overcome your lust, the Bible says that God will awaken your life. You'll be children of the day. Look at verse six. Now, here's where we get how we treat each other. This is good for communion. We just had communion a few weeks ago. Verse six, that no man go beyond and defraud his brother in any manner. That means take advantage. That means I'm not going to take advantage of you to get money from you or close or influence or uh put my put my videos on your channel and and and try to promote me with your social media. A real man of God won't take advantage of a of a of a person. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And neither will you. Praise God. If if you're not a preacher, you won't take advantage of people. You'll try to help people. &gt;&gt; So, a good way you know God's awake in your life is you're not mistreating people. You're treating them the right way. &gt;&gt; You got sexual purity. You keep your cravings under control. You treat each other the right way. You don't defraud one another. Hallelujah. Now, verse seven, for God has not called us under uncleanness. That means luxurious living. Now, church, we can all we can all get upset at these billionaires, right? Oh, look at their luxurious living. But church, when we buy things we don't need, that's luxury. &gt;&gt; Did you hear me? &gt;&gt; If we buy a car we can't afford, that's luxury. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Anything we buy that's too much for us, that's luxury. We're living in uncleanness. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because the borrower is serving to the lender. &gt;&gt; So, I know Malachi's monthly income now, right? So, if he tried to tell me, "Dad, I want to go and buy this brand new truck." I say, "It's out of your price range." And she's like, "I'm going to do it anyway. I'm 18." He would be guilty of uncleanness. &gt;&gt; Okay. Not I'm going to get off him now. I'm I think I was guilty of uncleanness at one time because I had five debts at the same time. So, let me just be honest. And I suffered for it, too. &gt;&gt; I suffered for it. Because God rebukes all children that he loves. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If the Lord loves you, he'll chasen you. Praise God. &gt;&gt; I had to learn don't get debt after debt after debt after debt. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Chris and I had a good talk about finances, right? This is why it's on my mind. But I I told him I was guilty of that. I was getting luxuries. I didn't. And I and I've had to cancel things. I've had to cancel subscriptions these last few months because things are getting tighter. See, uh any things that are luxuries, church, we got to cast them down. Right now, it's okay to have them if they're all right, but I'm just saying we have to be willing to let things go. We can't get too comfortable in Leodysia. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's uncleanness. So luxurious living. Now verse 11, go down to verse 11. Aaca. And that you study to be quiet. So the opposite of that is a loud life. If you're loud, if your life is constantly in other people's business and do your own business. So see, when people start getting other people's affairs, that shows they're sleeping on Jesus. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That means they'll be children of the darkness and not children of the day. &gt;&gt; And do your work with your own hands. That's why I appreciate everybody getting a good job, right? Work your tail off. People that uh what do they call it? They're parasite after other people. Those people are sleeping on Jesus and Jesus will sleep on them. They'll go in the tribulation period. Hallelujah. That's right. So, you take care of your own business. You live a quiet, humble life. Work as hard as you can. Verse 12. That ye may walk honestly. So, there's the last one. Be honest. Don't lie. Don't tell little lies and white lies because it's still a lie no matter what. Hallelujah. Walk honestly. All right. Now, how about how many appreciate that by God's grace? &gt;&gt; So, people that do those things are sleeping on Jesus. Now, go to Romans 13. Romans 13. Verse 10. Romans 13:10. I made it real serious, real fast, didn't I? All those sins. Brother Scott Walker was here and he said, "You know what, brother Jesse? What? You know what I like about you?" He said, "You preach on sin all the time." Well, it's because I battle it all the time and everybody else does, too. &gt;&gt; And I'm trying to keep you clean by the grace of God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And always at the end, we always offer, come up for forgiveness. Come up for victory. Jesus is here. Greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world. Praise God. All it takes is a simple repentance, a true humility, and the evil spirit will leave, and the power of God will come on us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. Love workketh no ill to his neighbor. Therefore, love is the fulfilling of the law. So again, you see this, how we treat others proves if God is waken in our lives. Verse 11, and that knowing the time that now is the high time to awake out of sleep. For now is our salvation nearer than when we believed. The night is far spent, the day is at hand. Let us therefore cast off the works of darkness and let us put on the armor of light. Now here, look, you see it's some repeat here, right? It's saying it's time to wake up. So if you're falling asleep tonight, I'm going to try to wake you up. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; If you're falling asleep physically, I'm going to try to wake you up spiritually and physically. But I want everybody to be awake spiritually tonight. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Let us walk honestly. There it is again. Honesty. Always tell the whole truth. People will appreciate you more if you tell the whole truth &gt;&gt; as in the day, not in rioting. So those are night parties and drunkenness. We know what that is. So see church, anybody getting drunk. Now Austin, we know Rod, we know all these people that go to church, if they get drunk in their houses, then they're sleeping on Jesus, they're not awake. It's proof right there. Hallelujah. It's just so simple. People that mistreat their body, whether sexual sin or drunkenness or mistreating others. All these, this is what the Bible says, not brother Jesse. The Bible says that these people are sleeping spiritually and they need to wake up before it's too late. &gt;&gt; Like these men, these grown men in their 40s dying because of heart attacks. We never know when it's our time. God will help us to be ready though. Praise God. &gt;&gt; That's what services like these are for. Amen. To make us ready to meet Jesus. Hallelujah. No matter what time he comes, none of us are guaranteed tomorrow. Not in chambering or wentness. I can never say that word. Which means unbridledness. Now, chambering chambering means sleeping around like in fornication before you're married. And uh wentness means unbridled lust. In other words, you just whatever lust. So, you see how it goes with the cravings verse? Just whatever you your flesh wants, I give it to it. That means a person's sleeping on Jesus. And strife. Now, that's contention, right? arguments in the church, disagreements in the church, and people won't repent of it. That shows they're sleeping on Jesus. And envying, I want what they have and I got to have it, and I I'm angry with them, and I'm jealous of them. That's sin as well. &gt;&gt; People are sleeping on God. Hallelujah. Now, go to uh 1 Corinthians 15:33. Now, I'm going to get to David and Saul eventually here, mostly Saul. 1 Corinthians 15:33. Be not deceived. Evil communications, that just means any talking, corrupt good manners or morals. So be very careful what words we speak because that will corrupt our words will corrupt our decisions. &gt;&gt; Right? Because it starts as a thought and then a word and then an action. Right. Now look at verse 34. See how Yeah, brother Chris. Yes. Perfect. Yeah. Give them two claps. Yeah. Exactly. Yes. If if people start singing songs about lust or boyfriend or girlfriend, I don't care if it's a slow song. I I tell people, don't listen to any of that. It's going to let an evil spirit on them. They're going to think about it. They're going to sing it and pretty soon they're going to be doing it, but they've already probably done it in their mind already. And Jesus said they're just as guilty, &gt;&gt; right? They don't repent. That's why we constantly repent of our thoughts, our deeds, our words. Every idol word, we repent of it. So on the day of judgment, there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. I love that verse. Hallelujah. I know I use it a lot, but I ought to. Hallelujah. Now, good manners or morals. Now, look at the next verse. 34. Awake to what? Righteousness. So, see, people that speak evil things or have bad moral decisions, they're sleeping on Jesus. And Paul says, "Wake up and obey the word of God &gt;&gt; and sin not for some have not the knowledge of God. I speak this to your shame." All right. Matthew 25:5. If you got your Bibles, Matthew 25:5. Waking up also means to trim your lamp, which basically means sanctification. Because when you trim the lamp, you cut off you cut off the part of the wick that's burned over because it's not going to burn as bright and you got to pull it up, right? So it has room to grow or room to burn down. Okay? So it's it's cleaning off. So sanctification. Verse five. While the bridegroom tried, they all slumbered and slept. And at midnight there was a cry made, behold the bridegroom cometh. Go ye out to meet him. Then all the virgins arose and trim their lamps. So here people when they hear Jesus coming, there's a rapture and they start cleaning up their life. That shows they're awake. I hope you can say amen that you're awake. &gt;&gt; Good. That was a good hearty amen. You ought to say that. Praise God. You ought to say, I've heard brother's message, Jesus coming back. Brother Ram's uh gift was the last sign to the Gentiles. Thus sayith the Lord. Amen. &gt;&gt; It was the last worldwide sign to the Gentiles because it was it was a prophetic gift discerning the thoughts and intents of the heart just like Jesus did to the woman at the well and Philip and Nathaniel. Hallelujah. And even Peter, praise God. &gt;&gt; He discerned the thoughts and intents of their heart. Mark 13, Jesus tells the parable. Mark 13:33. Sorry, I should have told you. Jesus said, "Take heed, watch, and pray for you know not when the time is. So see, if you're not praying, you might get sleepy on God. &gt;&gt; You got to pray, church. You got to pray and watch. Just force yourself. Just start with a five-minute timer. If you can't do one minute or if you can't do 10 minutes, do five minutes. Can't do five, 10, 15, you put it up there and force your body. Bring your body into subjection. Pretty soon you'll start enjoying it. Hallelujah. Because you got to get you got to get out of the spirit of the flesh and you got to get under the Holy Spirit anointing. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Take ye heed, watch and pray, for you know not when the time is. For the Son of Man is as a man taking a far journey who left his house and gave authority to his servants and to every man his work and commanded their porter to watch. Church, what's your work? Everybody has work. What's your work for the kingdom of God? You ought to know. Hallelujah. That's right. He says verse 35, "Watch ye therefore, for you know not when the master of the house cometh at even or at midnight or at the crowing or in the morning, lest he come suddenly and find you." It's a natural story about spiritual slumber. Lest he find you in fornication, lest he find you being dishonest, &gt;&gt; lest he find you with evil communications or mistreating the brethren or being lazy. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." all those sins. The Bible said, "Awake, wake to righteousness and and wake up from your sleep. Start obeying the word of God." Hallelujah. Amen. Thank you, Jesus. Let's Okay. Verse 37. And I say unto you, I say unto all, watch. Watch means to be cautious. Give strict attention to. So really watch over your life and make sure your life shows that you're awake to righteousness. &gt;&gt; Church, if you know better and you're doing sin, then lay at the altar. Find some place to find somebody to confess your sin to. Do whatever you need to do to get victory over sin and wake up spiritually. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Whatever you have to do. Praise God. Now, Ephesians 5 verse three. Ephesians 5:3. We're to go. This is a lot of repeat and it's all is everybody seeing this? All these scriptures are talking about waking up from sleep. God awakened in the days of David because David awakened to obedience. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And Saul, what was Saul? Saul was sleeping on God because of all his sins. &gt;&gt; Right? Verse three, uh, Ephesians 5:3. But fornication and all uncleanness, now there's luxurious living again, buying luxuries you can't afford, or covetousness, that's wanting what other people have. Let it not be once named among you as become as saints. Neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting. So see, watch your jokes. Don't do dirty jokes. There are clean jokes. There's such a thing as clean jokes. We know that. But see, if people are telling dirty jokes or filthiness or foolish talking, they might be sleeping on God. That means not ready for his coming. So instead of that, what should you do? Instead of all those jokes, what you do? Just give God some thanks. &gt;&gt; Just spend your day saying, "God is good. Thank you, Jesus. The Lord be magnified. Hallelujah. Now verse five. For this you know that no horarmonger, that's a man who sleeps around. A man who sleeps around no unclean person, that's a luxurious living again, and covetous man who is like an idoltor, I'm sorry, who is an idoltor, hath any inheritance in the kingdom, sorry, of Christ and of God, pardon me, verse six, let no man deceive you with vain words. For because of these things cometh the wrath of God upon the children of disobedience. Did everybody catch that? God's wrath is coming because of all these late night dirty talk show people telling these filthy jokes. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. About Trump or whoever, whatever it is, doesn't matter who it is, the wrath of God is coming on them. We ought to be found though giving God thanks tonight. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; We shouldn't be drawn to those things. We should be drawn to the truth of God's word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Giving thanks. Hallelujah. Now go down to verse 12. Let's go down to verse 12. For it's a shame even to speak of those things which are done to them in secret. We got to be careful church. We can't escape the news. But we got to be careful not to share news that's about secret sins of evildoers because it might stir something up in our minds. Hallelujah. Right? We got to be very careful. So that's that Bible gives that wisdom. Right? And and when you check the news, you got to be careful of that. I'm just talking from my perspective. I' I've noticed that, too. Certain uh uh websites, you know, whether it's Fox News or Google News or uh Newsmax, whatever it is, they'll have little ads and you know, and you got to got to get the setting on to turn those off. Hallelujah. Right. And then we can't if we see it, we can't mention it because it will pervert our thinking. Hallelujah. That's right. Now, here's what we should do. Verse 13, but all things that are reproved or convicted are made manifest by the light. For whatsoever doth make manifest is light. So our life should be able to discern what's good and evil and call out the evil. &gt;&gt; Now look at verse 14. Wherefore he says, what does he say? Awake. Don't go to sleep. Hallelujah. Wake up. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Thou that sleepest and rise from the dead, and Christ shall give thee light. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; See then that you walk circumspectly, which means diligently or exactly. Know exactly where you're walking. There it is. Circumspectly, not as fools, but as wise church, that's why I like Rod, you know, other other people that like to plan out their day. You know, I like I I found when I plan out my day and I write down what I'm going to do, I have more success overcoming the devil's temptations because you're walking circumspectly. You know exactly what you're going to do today. I had about nine things on my to-do list today. I got like eight of them done. I was like, "Hallelujah. Thank you, Jesus." I had to make sure I read my Bible first, get in the prayer closet, all these things. I always love how God shows up. Hallelujah. When we try to be circumspect, when we try to be diligent, God always shows up. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. But fools kind of wonder, "Well, maybe I'll do this today. Maybe I'll do that today." Let's pray and ask God, "God, show me what I'm supposed to do today." &gt;&gt; Let's not wander into things. Let's do what God called us to do. Hallelujah. Now, the the last one there in this section is verse 18. And be not drunk with wine, but be filled with the spirit. Hallelujah. So again, see how wine puts people to sleep spiritually. Everybody see that? Now, believe it or not, I'm coming down to my close. How many minutes on there? 23. Hallelujah. I'm quite surprised. But this is going to take all the remaining minutes here. Now, I'm closing with this thought. I mentioned this on Sunday. Let's look at Saul and David. Now, tonight we're just look at Saul. How did Saul treat the ark of God? Some of you might have a good guess, but I'm going to show you the exact scriptures. Now, church, what does this mean for us? And brother Rod, I got a real nice Bible here. Look at Rod's name on there. &gt;&gt; Rod gave me his first Scoffield Bible. I forgot my other Bible. home, brother. So, I'll tell you, it came in super handy. But church, what why are we talking about Saul and the ark? Because it's like you and I trying to find the will of God. Saul, his treatment of the ark is your treatment of this Bible and prayer. &gt;&gt; Does everybody understand? &gt;&gt; Now, Saul couldn't go. Let's let's say this this is the ark of the covenant. It kind of looks like one actually, at least the way it's set up, like the the rectangular prism. Saul could not go before the ark. So Saul would have to have the high priest go to the ark and the high priest would go in with the blood worship and he would speak to God. Right now we know it didn't happen but it almost happened which might surprise you. But this would happen with Aaron. Of course. Aaron would go in talk to God. Come out and I've got thus sayith the Lord. &gt;&gt; Right? That's what the ark was. God said remember remember I preached on last week. God will I said, "I'll meet you there." Where's God going to meet you, church? God's going to meet you right now. Yes. Can he meet you in the car? Sure. But you know where he wants to meet you? He said, "I want to I want I want to hear your voice in the morning." David said, "Lord, in the morning thou shalt hear my voice." &gt;&gt; Early. Jesus, the Bible said, "Early will I seek thee." And then remember Proverbs says, "If you seek me, you shall find me." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So this is your and my arc of the covenant. We'd say we read the word and then God tells us what to do. Brother Chris, I've done that for all my Christian life. I've been a Christian since 2000. So 25 years of my life, brother Rod, how many years you been serving God, brother? Hallelujah. 40 years. Let's say praise the Lord. Can we &gt;&gt; think about that? For 40 years, Brother Rod has come before the ark and said, "Lord, I'm going to read today. I'm gonna Hallelujah. I'm going to devote myself to finding the will of God. Hallelujah. Look at a testimony that Brother Rod has. Now, I know it more than you guys. Hallelujah. Because I spent more time with him, but trust me. Hallelujah. It's beautiful testimony. But that that's where the Christian gets the victory. You go here to the word of God in prayer and God will put something on your heart. Now, maybe it won't happen right there, but as you go about your day, you keep meditating on God and God will bring that thought right to your mind. How many times have I had that? I'll get a sermon thought in the shower, Brother Austin. Or maybe uh on the last minute on the drive to church. Hallelujah. Many times I've said, "Honey, I'm driving. Honey, take my phone. Text me these scriptures." And it'll be just what I needed to to to have to put in the sermon. By God's grace, it just I'm just driving and it comes right. God can speak to us at any time. Praise God. Or how many times I've not I've not know what to pray for somebody, but then God prays through me. Praise God. &gt;&gt; And God hears their prayer. God hears our prayer. See, this is your ark of the covenant. Now, church, believe it or not, there's only four times that the ark or the ephod is mentioned in Saul's ministry, in Saul's life. So, get your Bibles ready. Let's start with 1st Samuel 14:18. 1st Samuel 14:18 and 19. But church, this ought to be a great eye openener between the difference between a foolish virgin and a wise virgin. David is the prefigure of the wise virgin. King Saul is the prefigure of the foolish virgin. Barely saved. He didn't deserve to be saved. Well, really, none of us do. &gt;&gt; None of us deserve to be saved. &gt;&gt; I like that. Where's Where's my card? &gt;&gt; None of us deserve to be saved. Amen. &gt;&gt; That That's the word, &gt;&gt; right? And I I know I'm not I'm just joking with everybody. It's just nice to hear an amen. Hallelujah. But but he look at his attitude toward the word. Now, this is the battle of the Philistines, which they won. Now, look what Saul does. And Saul said unto Ahi, "Bring hither the ark of God. For the ark of God was that time with the children of Israel." Now, watch this. And it came to pass while Saul talked to the priest, he's saying, "Go into God. Get the word of the Lord. How how are we going to win this battle? The Philistines, how are we going to defeat him? Watch this. As he's talking, the noise that was in the host of the Philistines went on and increased. And what does Saul say? The battle gets so loud. What does he say? He says, "Oh no, withdraw thine hand." Church, the noise of the battle made him stop seeking the will of God and the noise of your life sometimes. And the church said, cause you say, "Oh, no. I don't have time to read my Bible." &gt;&gt; Amen. I'll say it, too. Sometimes I don't do it either. I don't have time to pray because of the noise going on in my life. &gt;&gt; Church, listen. This is the closest he ever got to getting thus sayith the Lord from the ark. After this, he never even sniffed it. We'd say he never even got close to the ark of God. This was the closest he got. This is chapter 14. In chapter 15, God rejects him from being king. &gt;&gt; The closest he got is like, "Okay, God. I'm going to read and pray today and I'm Oh, there's an alarm. Oh, I'm sorry, God. I'll leave that to I got to go to work. I got to go whatever. I got to go get uh Chipotle or for maybe I got to go get my pizza." This is the closest he's got. He's about ready to go. Oh, and life gets so loud. He says, "That's okay. Don't go in. And notice church, God gave them the victory. If you read the last last verse of the chapter, God gave him the victory. It's verse 33. So the Lord saved Israel that day. It was because of Jonathan. Jonathan is armor bearer actually attacked this army. Put him in all this confusion and it led to the victory. So look, Saul asked for the ark, the ephod, the yurum thumbum when the Pharisees attacked, but interrupted the consultation before receiving an answer from God. This shows uh Saul was impatient and he disregarded thus sayeth the Lord. Now you know why that's important to us because I preached many thus sayith the Lords from William Brandon and church I haven't just told you most of them church I put up here. How many are witnesses to that? &gt;&gt; When Rod's been here, I preached two sermons on thus sayith the Lord's, right? But over the years, church, how many times have I heard thus sayith the Lord? Or how many how many times have I preached it? And Saul would stop short. He says, well, I don't have time for that, church. If we have a thus sayith the Lord, let's obey it. &gt;&gt; I went through many of them, right? Been through over 30. I got I have 31 in my final chapter of that book. Everybody should have a free copy by God's grace. So, can everybody see the parallel here? You better really spend some time with my life is too loud. My life is too busy. I'm not going to No, that's okay. Just withdraw. Don't spend that time with God. Now, look, does God bless him? Yes. God blesses him and he still gets a victory. God might bless you and I, but God wants us to have the ark. God wants us to spend time with the ark. &gt;&gt; In other words, don't withdraw from God's presence. Run to God's presence. &gt;&gt; If you didn't do this morning, you tonight when you go home, spend some time with God. You've got to get in the habit. You've got to addict yourself to the presence of God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. That's what the Bible says. They addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints in the end of uh either Corinthians or Romans. House of Stefanis. Now, here's the next time it's mentioned. 1 Chronicles 13:3. I hope that's the right verse. This is this is David's word after he be this is his words after he becomes king. Let us bring again the ark of God for us for we inquire not at it in the days of Saul. Think about that. Saul got so close but he actually didn't inquire from it. What am I saying? We can get so close. Sometimes we want to know God's will, but we don't spend enough time to know God's perfect will. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God's perfect will for all our major decisions. And I'll say this, all of our minor ones, too. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. David's like, think, think about that. We had thus sayith the Lord and in Saul's generation and we never even went to it. Church, are you going to the tapes to hear brother say, thus sayith the Lord? Are you listening to brother Random? You should be. He gave us thus sayith the Lord. &gt;&gt; If you're not then church, what are you doing? You're not inquiring at the at the hand of the Lord, the word of the Lord. Hallelujah. If you need a sermon to listen to, ask me. I'll tell you. I'll let I'll tell you to listen to one I'm listening. I'm listen to spoken word original seed right now. It's a six and a half hour sermon. I I listen to all of it, but I'm just going back to that last hour of it where the Holy Spirit said, "Pick up your pen and write." And there's there's words from the Lord in there. But look, the closest he got was like, "Okay, I'm going to get so close. Oh, no. I'm I got I got too much going on. I can't get in the presence of God right now. I've got too many battles to fight." Church, if you spend time with God, you'll have less battles. &gt;&gt; How many How many witnesses of that? &gt;&gt; If you spend time with God, you'll have less battles to fight. &gt;&gt; But see, it's the noise of busyness that tries to draw us away. Ah, withdraw your hand. Oh, don't spend that time with God. It's the noise of busyiness. The third one, 1st Samuel 28:6. 1st Samuel 28:6. It's okay. And when Saul inquired of the Lord, the Lord answered him not, neither by dreams, nor by urum, by prophets. This is at the end of his life. So he's he's wasted all these years chasing David, right? Civil wars in the church. falsely accusing David, wanting to kill David's ministry, stop his ministry, falsely accusing for years, wasted. And now, and now at the end, he's like, "Now I'll try to I'll try to get something from God. Now I have time for God." &gt;&gt; God's like, "No, I was here the whole time. &gt;&gt; Now you just want to use me for your own benefit." God shuts the door on. God lets the black cloth drop from heaven. You got no word. And so now he gets what he what he planned at the beginning. Now he he reaps what he sowed. He sowed rebellion which was witchcraft. And now he guts witchcraft &gt;&gt; because of his little disobedience. Now he gets the fullness of it. He has to go to witches. Hallelujah. See that? That's what he planted. So he he reaps what he sws. He planted disobedience so he reaps witchcraft. Hallelujah. My see at the end of his reign he was desperate to spend time with God and get guidance with thus sayith the Lord from the ark but it was too late God wouldn't speak to him through the ark nor the yurum thumbum which was on the ephod withdrew his presence now last one here. Oh yeah this is good. Psalm 22 I'm sorry 1st Samuel 22 18- 19. I'm almost done. How many enjoying the word tonight? &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, I haven't talked much about David as far as specifically. I'll get to more of that, Lord willing, Sunday. But I've wanted you to see what it means to be awake as a Christian. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. I want you to see how one man didn't really seek God. Although, church, if you go read him, he was anointed and prophesied with thus sayith the Lord, Saul. But he still wouldn't spend time with God. and get thus sayith the Lord. See, I don't care how many testimonies people have. What matters is your heart is knit to God's and you want God's perfect will. &gt;&gt; No, don't get me wrong. I love testimonies. I love supernatural. I love all that. But if you don't have the time with God, it doesn't really help you out too much. &gt;&gt; You might get five victories, but with Jesus, you would have got 14. Amen. Hallelujah. With spending time with Jesus, you would have got a lot more victories. Glory. 1st Samuel 22:18-19. What a sermon to come on, brother Rod. What a sermon you chose to come on, brother. Hallelujah. I love this. Amen. Don't you love the word? Amen. This This blew my mind away this morning. Like, wow. He never really ever got thus sayeth the Lord from the ark of God. Now, church, have we really really really made sure we had thus sayith the Lord that we obeyed all the word of God? &gt;&gt; Let's make sure we do it. really make sure you know thus sayith the Lord for your life. &gt;&gt; Don't just guess. That's what Saul Saul just guessed and tried to fight the best he could. Yeah, he got a couple victories, but what a miserable life that he lived. All the torment that he he himself chose to be under that torment of hatred and jealousy, right? Anger, murder. Now look what he does. Look what Saul does to the only people who can get thus sayith the Lord for him. What does he do to them? He kills them. So he himself won't go to the ark. And then he kills all those that could go to the ark. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And the king said to Dog, "Turn thou and fall upon the priest." What priests? They're the ones that can go to the ark and dug the Edomite turned and he fell upon the priests and slew on that day four score and five persons that did wear a linen ephod. The ephod is where the the yer thumb went with the 12 stones of Israel. and brother Chris, they would go before the Lord and they would talk to God and if those lights shine then the priest knew like it'd be like a yes or no answer. Should we go up to battle? Yes or no? And the yes would be the lights, right? Or something along those lines. They knew how God does it. You know, we have to look in the Bible for more. But the lights would shine and then they the priest would come back in and say, "Praise the Lord. We know we've got thus sayith the Lord." God spoke through the Yurman Thumbum. Amen. The light struck the rock. Amen. The light struck the stones. Hallelujah. and it glistened. Hallelujah. They were children of the light, not children of the darkness. Hallelujah. Amen. The light shined on the 12 stones because we're children of the light. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, what is this for us? It's people that will turn down preachers who are preaching thus sayith the Lord. They'll turn down brother Brandham who gave thus sayith the Lord. &gt;&gt; They'll turn down any quote that says thus sayith the Lord. I'll say it like this. It could be as simple as just turning down anything that we preach on tonight. the honesty, the hard work, the sexual purity, &gt;&gt; treating your brother or sister with godliness, not taking advantage of them. &gt;&gt; It's it's silencing any voice that's telling you, "Thus sayaith the Lord." &gt;&gt; Because that's what the ark was. The ark was thus sayeth the Lord. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And now, church, as far as I've studied, those are all the times that Saul is mentioned as going to his Bible. I mean, the Ark of the Covenant. You know what I'm talking about. I mean, that's it. He just went to this Bible like three or four times. Really, it's only three times because one of them is David just saying he never went there. In all his time in the message, he only consulted God just about three times. That's the only time you ever really had a prayer meeting with Jesus. Come on, somebody. &gt;&gt; Church. If we just go to church, that's not enough. You got to spend time with God. &gt;&gt; If you're spend time with God, you'll enjoy church more. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Like I do, like everybody does. &gt;&gt; We enjoy church more when we're spending time with Jesus because you've already probably read some of those same verses. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Or listen to some of the same thoughts, some of the same quotes by the grace of God. So see, we must not cut off thus sayith the Lord. Whether it's through brother Brandham, whether it's through the Bible, through the pastor, through your own prayer time, your own Bible reading, you must not cut off thus sayith the Lord. That's what a foolish virgin did. Now, did God have mercy on him? Yes. Samuel said, "You'll be with me tomorrow." Basically in Abraham's bosom. And then remember, he wept all night. He laid on the ground all night repenting. He was united with Jonathan on the last day of his life. But what a disgrace. What a waste of life. church, let's not be uh let's not be wasters of life. Let's redeem the time because the days are evil. Hallelujah. How many want to redeem the time? &gt;&gt; Let's stand to our feet. Praise God. Musicians can come. How long was that sermon? Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I would if it wasn't for my son. And I love my son just like we did for Austin. I appreciate that, brother Chris. Let's give God a round of applause. Amen. And that's right where I thought I'd get. You know, as I studied this morning and and a couple hours of study and prayer, I thought I'd get right to about there. So, we got there by the grace of God. Church, everybody get your Bible. We're going to close it. Put your Bible on your heart here. You got a Bible. Got yours, brother? Yes, sir. Yes. Hey, don't feel bad, brother. Don't feel bad. Church, this is your ark of the covenant. I want you to hold it on your heart, you know, because that this is this is the ark of your heart, right? Your soul is the ark of God, just like your mind's another throne of God. And remember, brother Ram says, Brother Ram says, I love this, Rod. God can do out, God can do things outside the Bible. God could, but Brother Ram said, I just like to believe what's in the Bible. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Because then I know for sure that I'm right. Oh, I love that. Amen. Yes, God could possibly do something outside the Bible. Like there could be all these uh other worlds, you know, we'll go to in the future home in the God could do that, but I'm just going to stay with what's right in here because then I know I'm safe with God. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Then I know I've got at least I got thus sayith the Lord. My for my own understanding, my own life, I've got thus sayith the Lord. Hallelujah. I love this story. This came alive to me today. I don't want to be Saul. I want to be David. Sister Beatress, tomorrow I want to go in my home. I want to open up this Bible. Now be my daughter Bible looks just like this one. I say, Lord, what do you have for me in the book of Job? Because that's what I'm reading right now. What do you have for me? What is thus sayith the Lord Patrick for my life? Hallelujah. Father, let's put your Bibles there. Let's close with a word of prayer. Father God, we have our Bibles on our hearts because we know the word must be in us. We want the perfect will of God in us. Saul, we'd say, Lord, Saul held his Bible away or he walked away from his Bible. But Lord, we want to be like David as we'll show, Lord willing, on Sunday. We want that ark in our heart, dear God. We want the prince of God in our heart, dear Lord Jesus. We want thus sayith the Lord on the throne of our heart. Grant it Lord Jesus. Lord, this is just a symbol of what we need to do every night, every morning and the day with Bible prayer, worship, singing a song, even as David said, meditating on our beds, thinking about the plan of God, quoting the scripture. Grant it, Lord Jesus. I pray Lord we'll be like David as we'll see and as they'll probably remember I preach it about eight or nine years ago. Every time David inquired he got the victory. And yet now as we see tonight Lord Saul never even got to really seeking God. Oh God help us to seek you Lord God. Help us to get down to business with you Lord God. all of us, including the young people, Lord, that their lives could be blessed and spared from scars, cravings of lust, and all kinds of wickedness as we read tonight. And for us that are older, the same truth, Lord, but we've been serving a little longer. We got more experience. Keep us pure, Lord God. Oh God, help us to overcome the Solomon syndrome of getting older and getting laxidasical and lazy on you, oh God, help us to overcome that, Lord Jesus. Our brother Rod and Beatatric stand here as testimonies that if you do it decade after decade, God's blessing and power remains on your life. Thank you, Jesus, for examples of that, Lord God. Hallelujah. Lord, I'm almost at three decades, Lord. I want that, Lord, more than anything else, Lord. To be a man of integrity, to be one who seeks after the word of God. I want to know the Bible. I want to know thus, sayith the Lord. I want to know the perfect will of God. So Lord, we hold our Bibles by our hearts which represent we want the word on the throne of our hearts. Grant it Lord Jesus. Bless your people Lord God. And may they have a heart to know you Lord God. May they start their day with you. May they go before the ark every day Lord God. They didn't even do it in the days of Saul. But Lord David did it. He said one thing I have desired that I might dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life. Lord God. Hallelujah. Lord, how we love coming to church. Oh, if I could, as my even my cousin Adam told me, I wish I could spend every day in church, Lord God. How true that is, Lord. That's the prayer of David. But we know in the New Testament, we become the temple of God. We become the church, Lord God. Help us to create an atmosphere, Lord, through living circumspectly, Lord God, making our plans for the day to honor you, to love you, to serve you. Help us, Lord Jesus. I pray may we seek constantly for thus sayaith the scripture thus
