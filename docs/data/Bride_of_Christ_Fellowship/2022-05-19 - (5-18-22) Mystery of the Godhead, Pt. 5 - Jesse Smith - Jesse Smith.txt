if we can tonight here let's go i want to go to colossians chapter 2. i'm going to resume a series i paused nine months ago so i felt like last week i felt like you know i felt like i finished the gideon series and i got really good feedback on that last sermon and that lesson from getting his life so i was really happy about that right a couple of emails and texts so we're thankful that the holy spirit is meeting with people praise god drawing them closer to him praise god how they do that's what we want to draw closer to jesus tonight amen praise god so colossians chapter 2 verse 1. i like to go back to the mystery of the godhead this will be part 5. i preach four sermons in july of august of last year i don't remember it's okay i wanted to preach that so the young children had them of course i don't know how many adults i only know two people that have read the whole book which is okay you don't have to read it i only know two people that have read it um uh but if you didn't get a chance if you don't get if you don't feel led to read it i want to preach it to you by god's grace so praise god especially the young ones especially the young ones because us adults we've been around a little while we know the message we know a lot of the uh doctors will be good refresher for us of course yeah as you know you can pull anything you have need of out of god's gift you don't have to be my gift church it can be anybody here you're right you've seen that last few months you can pull any gift any need you have you can pull it out of any gift of god yeah praise the lord when the saints pray when the saints believe praise god very badly to be encouraged praise god let's go to chapter two let's go elections chapter two hallelujah brother said his wife is feeling much better after that coleman says thank the lord for that praise god my god [Applause] yes sir yes sir he and i will text every now and then that's good praise god did you see my work brother i i just no i he does he talks to me just before perfect perfect praise god amen his son malcolm has been a real good friend over the years colossians two verse one i like to look at the mystery of the godhead here i'm sure there'll be a lot of familiar things you know so that's the um spirit here to direct this by his grace i'm just going to review i'll probably this will be a longer review now sometimes i say there's a short review this could be a little bit longer review like maybe 10 minutes okay so uh just bear with me all right back around a little bit so we have an understanding on this here colossians two verse one you know some people uh some people wonder how could a trinitarian be saved you know they look at that they look at us and they say how can we be saved yeah right yes but they're under church dogmas right that were written by men we're under the bible that's written by the holy spirit through holy one of allah got removed of the holy ghost right glory so but we believe that now the reason we believe that is because it's a mystery brother ma'am my wife found a quote that where brother rabbi said even catholics can be uh born again now that's before the seals my brother ram said catholics could be born i remember that my wife shared with me from 1961 a few weeks ago so brother graham was always gracious now he condemned the system he said i've got to strike the serpent that's biting the people right right but if there's a sincere heart in there that really loves god is trusting in jesus christ and they repent of their sins then they're saved praise the lord yeah right so somehow god works it out god's got lorraine said god's got children in every organization right they said that the seventh seal so that's right you know we're just trusting in god's grace and we know at church we know the type there's abraham there's a lot type right there's a david there's a saul right there's a maikai there's a jehoshaphat all the way down there's a wise and foolish all the way down he's gone we know there's types and so uh the types are always looking to point into something right the shadow points to a reality and the reality is there's wise and foolish virgin springs colossians two verse one i'll read verse one and then we'll all read verse two verse one for i would that ye knew what great conflict i have for you and for them at laodicea and for as many as have not seen my face in the flesh let's reverse two together one two three maybe our hearts might be comforted being knit together in love and unto all riches of the full assurance of understanding to the acknowledgement of the mystery of god and of the father and of christ now look at verse three let's read that too we might as well read that one two three and whom are all the treasures of wisdom how many believe that all the treasure all the wisdom everything is in the godhead and what is the god of the holy spirit praise yes it is the fullness of the god of course that holy spirit dwells in his son that glorified body of the lord jesus christ may god has blessed you remember his word you may be saying i just want to briefly review here for a few moments and uh since it's been nine months since i preached on this series and i thought it might benefit you all if i just reviewed for a few moments by the grace of the lord praise god this is a you know a a very familiar subject and uh as i said i was i went back and listened to some of the sermons uh that i was preaching on this just just to kind of get an idea um and i remember that the truth that as more time goes on the trinitarians are coming more hostile against anyone who's outside of the trinitarian right okay and that's because the squeeze is coming on yes right there has to be some type of squeeze the bible speaks of it in revelation 13. the world and the church world i'm talking about the unsaved church world the church world that takes the mark of the beast they have to get to a spot where they will support legislation to kill anyone who descends right and they're getting really close i mean this is the closest we've ever seen yeah uh where people uh you know pro-abortion people are going into churches and i've seen videos they're standing right up there in the priest's face and cussing out the priests right there i mean just never seen this kind of boldness before uh throwing those mocktail uh uh what are they called molotovs i'm sorry yeah i said it wrong i could never say that word anyways there are explosions and they put them in uh uh conservative buildings or churches they're burning up churches like we've just never seen it to this level before and so what it's going to do it's going to keep advancing more and more we got to expect that just like jesus said we've got to expect wars rumors of wars earthquakes pestilences right we have to expect all these things and these are all just birth pains right right coming down towards the end so we're going to see it advance more and more but i've just noticed in the you know the 20 years i've been serving the lord uh that the rhetoric gets more and more aggressive against anyone who's not a trinitarian for example the gentleman that left the message and started the website and when he talks about me believing in the goddess he calls me a heretic he just calls me he said pastor jesse is a heretic because he don't believe in the trinity exactly the opposite is true they're the heretics for adding to the bible amen so that's what you find whatever satan's accusing you of that's what he's guilty of yeah and even if you were guilty of it you confess it it's under the blood you're no longer guilty that's the power of our sacrifice if god won't remember it then we shouldn't remember it either right now unless it's just to keep us humble but not to take the guilt and shame of it again amen right we already had the guilt and shame when we said forgive me jesus we already took the where the guilt and shame there and then the bible says then you take vengeance against that that mistake that you made and next time you overcome by the grace of god remember i showed this stat there's about eight billion people on the earth right now um and seven billion of them are in uh at least seven million if not more probably more are in total worship of either multiple gods or or a false god right almost two billion are muslims and they worship one person but it's the it's the wrong person right it's not jehovah it's not yahweh no it's not the lord jesus christ no so two billion worship one person but it's the wrong person right some demonic power right uh 2.3 billion are trinitarians so they're idolaters right there's 4.3 billion that's over half 1.1 billion are hindus and they worship millions of gods now they have three main ones i showed that to you about nine months ago uh but they have so that right there's uh five point uh 5.4 there and then 1.9 are atheists or gnostics and they still have a god it's the god of this world satan because they love themselves which is pleasures which is actually uh it's self-exaltation it's actually worship of satan right because the bible says they they live according to the prince and power of this sin amen because it's the spirit of disobedience that they're living under so they are worshiping something they're worshiping satan sure so there's a very small group within there that actually believes god is one person and his name is jesus christ aren't you glad to be in that number amen it's a very small number [Applause] amen that's exactly right that's why this is a great mystery remember it started because of matthew 13 33 says a woman took ahead of three measures of meal and 11 and three measures a meal and it grew up until the whole thing was 11. the whole thing was 11 represents sin the whole thing became sinful what woman made her meal or i'm sorry what woman mixed leaven which is sin with meal which is christ the word what woman did that till the whole thing becomes sinful that's the roman catholic church yeah hallelujah oh yeah because jesus christ is the meadow he's the bread hallelujah he's the bread of life amen and in him is no love and praise god so that parable shows that those three measures uh were placed in there early in the church age so it grows up now and now we have a church a catholic church which brother ray and stephanie can tell you some stories about catholic schools and catholic churches because i heard them on sunday night they could really tell you some awful stories about these people but the whole thing is 11 praise god yes to their own shame and but it was prophesied jesus said it's a mystery within the kingdom of heaven as he as he said as he taught us in matthew chapter 13. so the confusion is how many persons is god the revelation is that he's one god who manifests himself in three ways father son and holy ghost praise god now of course god can manifest himself in as many ways as he wants praise god but pertaining to mankind and redeeming man he manifests himself in three ways father son and holy ghost member of church the word triass which is the greek word of trinity trinity was not even invented until 180 a.d amen that's right my goodness uh that's how many years after jesus that's 150 years after jesus left the scene so jesus never spoke about trinity no neither did paul any of these guys they come up with it 158 years later and now we're the heretics they're the heretics yeah hallelujah and then right around that time torturing which he was a godly man from what i understand uh when i was studying church history i was studying certainly with the same books brother branham studied how did it happen by rachel has a time that's a good one and uh that's it yeah it is excellent i love that one yeah uh and also admin uh uh broadband there it is edmond broadband beautiful history books there my just some tremendous history books but both men said through it was a godly man but he introduced the latin form of the word true which is trinitas right about the same time so we see this this false doctrine hatch and even come out come out of good people church if we're not careful bad things can come out of good people right bad things that come out of good people you know we see it just look at martin luther good person church age messenger one of the stars in the hand of jesus christ but what comes out of him anti-semitism yeah right his words and speeches led to people burning down catholic i'm sorry jewish synagogues and people hurting jews yeah see one man church we're not careful like we said we're not careful pride will get in there right show it on sunday if we're not careful as we get older if we don't keep ourselves humble pride is going to overcome that's the truth and we'll be slaves to pride exalting ourselves rather than exalting jesus christ now notice remember the church remember church the early fathers never used the three persons you'll never find in scripture and this verse here colossians 2 2 is so beautiful it never mentions the holy ghost no so what does that mean it just mentions father god and christ where's the holy ghost in here yeah was god four persons now see how there there's no trinitarian consistency because the writers never were trinitarians amen amen they can find two bots through two verses in the whole bible that talk about well sorry three three that talk about father and holy ghost the rest are not like that and they take those three verses and then they write this man-made now church the proof is in the pudding there at church if a trinitarian can be saved that means the fact is if the if the people don't recognize that false doctrine it'll lead to many other false doctrines and look what it see when you allow one false doctrine it's a lot easier to take another yeah right right you break one rule next time it's a lot easier to break the next rule i've seen my kids do it in my classroom they're not my children but the kids in my life if they get away with one thing you better watch them the next time they're gonna try to do it again right happens all the time don't get away with it like like here's what i see all the time you know the the kids will the kids will be like fighting once another and like they'll look over and make faces and then look back at me and they think i didn't see them sometimes they don't catch them right and they're like oh someone's giving me bad faces and i'm like okay i'll watch and you know wait about 20-30 minutes pretty soon i look up and they're making i'll be like hey so-and-so i just got you that's recess minutes they think i'm not watching them but see if they get away with it one time they think they can get away with the second time that's how it is like when you when a lot of people are are serious with god they think oh if i do one sin that lightning is going to come down and strike me right right and then when it does it they're like oh maybe i i mean it's okay to get drunk maybe it is okay to do this maybe and so it gets easier each time but church inside i'll stay like this the lightning was striking on the inside amen that's where god was trying he was trying to strike their convictions amen hallelujah he was trying to strike their conscience how did they get to that i don't know that must have been the lord but the fact is he says it's a mystery of god father and christ and all the treasures are hitting them well what about the holy spirit all the wisdom of god is not in the holy spirit well of course it is but see paul just lists these different titles right he listens now of course christ it means the anointing one right god an object of worship and father of course is the heavenly creator right of all things he doesn't list the holy spirit which to us it doesn't bother us but that may bother a trinitarian why don't they use this one then why don't they use this one if it's such a if trinity's all over the bible why don't they use this one because it doesn't fit their agenda it doesn't fit their false doctrine praise god but look paul called it a mystery how many know it's mysterious it's very mysterious there's things to this day so i don't understand but we can clearly point down and pinpoint that god is not three separate co-equal persons no that's total paganism right now in part two when i preach it we looked at the eight problems with the trinity doctrine i'm just going to read them out of here okay so i don't know if you ever read them out here so i'm going to remind her he says okay i don't expect youtube for the first problem is the trinity adds to the bible and that's the worst problem because if you add to the word right eggs will be added to you in hell right either in hell or on the earth as well as in hell right that's the word that's the most decimating uh charge against trinitarians they add to the bible that's why i told austin every every time always end the debate about trinity with that you're the one adding to the bible i'm the one that believes everything in the bible amen hallelujah right second jesus and his apostles taught and affirmed pure hebrew monotheism rather than trinitarianism right yeah no hebrew author jesus himself never talked about three persons jesus quoted the shema that the hebrew prayer hero israel the lord our god is one lord and his name is one not three his name is not three his name is lord amen as the bible says and then i listened the athanasian creed which was a sixth century trinitarian confessional contains at least six contradictions and i put it right there with bullet points in there six times the creed contradicts the bible and they can't see that right and then i put up this shoe remember the shield of the trinity i showed you there's so many lies in here but the worst lie is that the father is not the holy spirit that's the worst lie right because then jesus has two fathers right all right such a lie how can there be two whole different holy spirits because the god the father is the holy spirit how can there be two different separate holy spirits it makes no sense unless you're unless you're uh deceived and you picture god the father as a white bearded light-haired man and up in heaven and the holy ghost has a dove that just kind of roofs on his shoulder or something like that then it might make sense but it makes no sense if you believe the bible and know that god is the invisible spirit the all-creator of the one who inhabits eternity praise god hallelujah it makes no sense unless you take a a trinitarian picture or something like that artwork yeah also there's major bible contradictions and inconsistencies among trinitarians fifth the early trinitarians you know this they did not even say the trinity i'm sorry the the the holy spirit was a divine person until 381 a.d that's 350 years after jesus left the scene they finally said the holy spirit is a person right right they didn't even think the holy spirit was a divine person well why what was what was living in them anyway what what it wasn't jesus body that was living in them what do they think was living in them it shows that jesus wasn't living in them because they create they add on to the bible praise god true six their images and artwork are deceptive they're false representations of the godhead sure and seventh they use fear tactics in order to keep people in their church they got to use fear now we don't use fear here except fear of god but that's what every church you use we use fear of god in other words you got to go somewhere you have to go here but you got to go somewhere that's fear of god because if you if you forsake god's house god will forsake you that's exactly right the bible says they went out from us because they weren't out of us yes is that right praise god i may lead you somewhere else but you make sure you go to the church amen that's true but their fear tactics are if you don't believe in the trinity you're going to hell and if you're you're a heretic if you don't believe in the trinity right what a lie yeah they got to use fear to keep you in the church we don't use fear we use faith praise god that's what we really use faith revelation amen faith in the word of god is what we use how do we bring the word of god how many have assured us in your heart that god's word is true praise god that's why you keep coming back because you keep hearing truth you see that truth have an impact on your life amen you love the truth because the truth is inside of you the truth died for you the truth is a person the truth sets you free glory amen hallelujah hallelujah and lastly god sent a prophet named william mary branham to tell christians that the trinity was of the devil thus saith the lord amen hallelujah it's exactly right eight reasons of trinity dog was false i put this out in july of 2021 i'm still waiting for somebody to come show me where i'm wrong i'm still waiting it's almost been a year still waiting for somebody now the two people that heard it i'm sorry two people read it one of them got baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ by craig out connecticut brother oh great he yeah he's like he she sent me an email he said brother jesse i think you're gonna be really encouraged somebody read your book and got baptized right i put it at about the end of every chapter that's at the end of every chapter there's like what you should do at the end of the chapter so let me see if i can find it real quick so let's see after the godhead chapter what three i put three things you should do if you're a former trinitarian repent of purposely ignoring or adding to god's known character rejoicing the truth as one divine person second uh be ready to share god's revelation although it's not required for salvation by citing scripture alone third uh be aware to avoid lots of trinitarian songs and references and in weddings and baptists baptismal ceremonies and be careful when associated with trinitarians for the fact that one false doctrine often leads to another and i didn't put that in there about being baptized okay i know i put another other chapters there all right it's a little surprising though amen all right all right praise god oh yeah well the other there's there's one in chapter uh chapter two praise god chapter three yeah there you go hallelujah see just urging people don't just let the word go in one ear not the other but act upon the word right that's the way you'll be blessed if you leave this place and act upon the word of god amen sure that's the only way to be blessed praise god is to obey the word of god then i show the six clear contradictions from the athanasian creed and the shield of the trinity contradiction with the father and the holy ghost okay part three i focus on showing how god the bible used the word manifest when it talks about god it's not pert three persons it's always manifest god manifests himself in flesh that's the key word it's a manifestation right then i showed how we're not modalists although modalism is close to what we believe but we're not right a list because they have some beliefs that are outside the bible right see god don't want any label on you other than you're a holy ghost-filled saint hallelujah amen right now we call ourselves message believers but in reality it's the message of the baptism of the holy ghost and hebrews 13 8 that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen i don't want no denominational labels on us no and we're not oneness either because i showed the different uh things that are wrong with the oneness doctor right and all kind of for them it all kind of goes back to speaking in tongues you know the godhead's kind of important it's not as important as that speaking in tongues right which where's that got them where's it just got them into denomination right and now worldliness like jose's family knows i went to that church with brother william we went back to that uh oneness church they used to be holy a few years ago i went back and now they're just worldly high heels and all kinds of makeup earrings men that don't live a real godly life you know it's just sad now part three though i showed this and this was fresh to me i think it came to me while i was studying we looked at how the last remaining mystery really that i can see of the godhead is the use of plural pronouns like let us and jesus said uh exalt me with the glory that we had before the foundation of the world right we so us and we and just the simple truth came to me that any manifestation of god god's invisible right so any manifestation of god is a thing but it's a thing separate from him because he's invisible now he lives inside that thing but it's still a thing so in other words the pillar of fire god's in that bill of fire but that fire is just a thing it's a it's a it's a covering for him it's a mask praise god so the reason he said let us make is because the invisible and the visible work together praise god and the visible is a person place or thing the visible manifestation is a noun and so whenever you have two nouns together you got to use a plural pronoun praise god amen so what let us is father speaking through the light of the son hallelujah sure jesus's body let us or glorify me with the glory we had before the foundation of the world we this manifestation right that was the logos but the logos just changed the mass and put the fire away and it took on a body called jesus christ amen all right hallelujah and then that invisible spirit came inside of jesus physical body praise god hallelujah that's a great mystery there but that's the last remaining and mystery in part four church i labored on genesis 1 26 matthew 28 19. there's one name to the father and holy ghost not three names and i showed you 14 documents remember that when i showed you 14 documents from history that we found from libraries it was real romantic when i was first married we would spend some of our dates at the library looking in church uh encyclopedias i'm sure my wife really appreciates those romantic times that we stuck there oh you're so romantic taking me to the library oh thank you you're right well you know we had help brother simon and brother scott obermeyer you know they uh they would go to different libraries as well you know and we found 14 documents that all say the same thing the early apostles used the name of jesus christ that was called the apostolic form after that around 100 a.d was the earliest they found when from the dedache i could never say that document it's called dedache did not they that what is it yeah i can never pronounce that it looks like didachi i'm not a scholar no not even close but about a hundred eighty they found the duck and it says they baptized in the titles polished in holy ghost so the earliest record we have of false baptisms is about 180 so seven years after jesus left okay so that's that but everything else point er everything points to the apostles always use the literal name and then i ended by showing how titles are not names that showed how having many titles doesn't produce a name no because in revelation 12 satan's called old dragon old serpent the devil satan he's got four titles is he four persons certainly not no he's one awful person he's one awful person okay and so then god can have righteous branch he can be alpha omega beginning now healthy father first and the last he can be all that but he's one person very amen okay now there's the review is that okay every take a deep breath that wasn't too bad that was too bad i didn't keep you all all night on the review so praise god i usually don't read too long anyway let's go to the next part five here so part five now i want to start on part five with uh uh first i believe it's what i'm saying let me see i keep gotta keep turning here sorry yeah the power in jesus name so uh bible readers so get your bibles here to young people here and any adults if you want to read get your bible ready we'd appreciate it remember program had men and women read the scriptures in the services there so sisters can read us uh scriptures while the sermon is is going on i got i got the tapes praise god i'm just saying with the tapestry right brother joseph right brother billy paul all these brothers i'm just saying what the tapes say i do that in love because i reached out to them and uh i know i got balled out sometimes but it's all in love if you love somebody try to correct it now power in the name of jesus so there's many titles but one name right now i just put here the literal name of jesus christ is power amen it represents power and authority so i gave my testimony at the beginning of this section in chapter one when i first became a a christian before my preaching ministry i felt forgiven when i was baptized in the name of lord jesus i just felt like the i just felt like it was it was settled praise the lord because i've been falsely baptized twice before that the first time i didn't really want to do it i was just trying to get somebody off my back second time i wanted the lord jesus christ but the oneness people said jesus only all right and i was guilt guilt guilt guilt guilt shame shame shame you know foolishness you should have did it well i finally went and got it done and after that i just knew all the all the deaths were cleared the case was settled amen i've been buried in this name and i knew i was forgiven amen amen hallelujah also as soon as i started quoting acts 2 38 memorizing it i stopped cussing instantly because there's power in the name of jesus christ that's even before i was baptized and as i spoken more and more god gave me a victory over tobacco pornography magazines idolatry and even more before the name of jesus christ i was helpless and i'll say like this hopeless yeah i was like man there must be no church that can help me right where's the church that can help me right little i know i was only one hour from at the whole time praise god i was living in liberty center lima was one hour south i mean literally i just had to go down route 109 one hour and i could have found power amen but god knows god has a time and season for everything god ordered my footsteps god ordered your footsteps that's why you're here tonight in the house of god amen praise the lord once i started preaching i saw even more victory in the name of jesus the holy spirit cast out devils heal the sin bring deliverance uh bring forth babies to the barren and even more right hallelujah now i've never seen it maybe you uh i don't know anyone else says i've never seen a miracle done in the titles fathers and only goes i've never seen it no brother man said evil spirits follow fathers and holy ghosts because of the catholic church so they'll always say father son holy ghost well evil spirits follow that right but the real holy spirit follows the name of jesus christ amen that's right now the entire bible shows power in the name so lydia uh john 1 12 malachi acts 4 7. i'm going to pick on them first because they're mine but before we get there when david defeated goliath he didn't come in the titles of god no he came in the name the bible said the name of the lord of hosts amen [Applause] he came in the name of jehovah hallelujah jehovah's name hallelujah and what happened the the giant fell the mountain moved because there's power in the name of jesus amen amen you got to speak the name wonderful lydia john 1 12 redone but as many as received him to them gave he power to become the sons of god power to become through what believing in his church you automatically have more power than the catholic because you believe in the name amen not just i'm not speaking any bad against them but they do not take the name of jesus now some do they might actually there are catholic charismatics i should say that there are some that actually speak the name of jesus and they actually see sometimes miracles i should i should correct that yes let me correct that yeah god bless those catholic charismatics that are using the literal name of jesus christ that they get some results thank god i forgot about that but but jesus said powers in the name that uh melka acts 4 7. and when they had set them in the midst they asked by what power or by what name have you done this praise god that was after peter raised that paralyzed the layman there right and gave him perfect soundness of health and ability to walk and peter said by the name of jesus christ of nazareth whom he crucified whom god raised from the dead even by him does this man stand before you whole on amen see name represents power and authority because even your name your name first and last has power in it as soon as you say austin laramie people oh i got a reputation right as soon as you say jesse smith nope something comes to your mind because there's power in your name you have a reputation that follows your name oh there's an eternal reputation for this guy the champion of love this mighty man this god from heaven amen what a rapid rep for the reputation amen that jesus christ has the champion of love amen proverbs 22 1 says a good name is rather be chosen than great riches right and loving favor rather than silver and gold right see your name and actions have a powerful impact on other people hallelujah you see the names authority on a check right or a receipt you can't buy it unless you sign them i gotta have it signed why you're gonna throw away well i gotta have it just sign your name on the receipt it's gotta be on there now the one that's more powerful is the power of attorney anybody ever been a power attorney here banks and businesses will only honor one name and that's the name that's certified and notarized as being a power of attorney no other names have power so if you're a power attorney you have power over someone's bank account over their their vehicles over their house and their property you have all the power it's called the power of eternity i'm sorry attorney for rather hallelujah in the same way the name of the lord jesus christ is the name above all names amen it's the power of eternity for every blessing from heaven church it will receive it praise god amen hallelujah that's how you access every blessing pray in the name of jesus speak in the name of jesus amen sing in the name of jesus hallelujah right worship in the name of jesus everything you do in word of deed do it all in the name of the lord jesus christ amen hallelujah now you've got power behind your actions amen yeah now you got the power of eternity praise yeah yeah thank god that we have that power right now remember church there's a great prophecy that the name or power would be denied in the last days by the false church imposters of christianity will take a form of godliness but deny true godliness now church which which churches are teaching them uh teaching their their members to cast out devils in the literal name of jesus christ which churches are doing that very few yeah and there's there may be some charismatics that we said here and there but most are not teaching them to cast out devils in the name of jesus christ yeah and if you want to review i'll give you a real quick review before you try to cast it out make sure the person has repented their sins and then say do you want to be set free this is how it's operated in my life at least i've seen in my life as soon as they say they're sorry and they want to be free from it we go to prayer we rebuke that spirit and then pretty soon it leaves and they feel better about god's grace right so where they scream or cry or shout or we weep whatever they do whether they smile afterwards whatever happens praise god and that's the end of the review was that was that was that difficult it's because jesus said you're a house and demons are in control they bound up your house so you got to expose them and get them out of the house amen otherwise you've got to clean out the house amen you've got to repent and expose them and then the name of jesus christ and then jesus comes in that house he opens the door and he says get behind me to have away man go to dry places jesus wants to clean out our houses amen houses of our loved ones houses of our families amen our friends very simple so i just thought you'd like that review first well confess your sins i guess maybe say that first confess your sins first all right brother tried to pray when he lied to our irs and the holy spirit said get your hands off that shot me make that right first before you try to cast out disease and try to pray for healing and deliverance and all these things praise god like i never forget when uh we're gonna go there a few weeks sister uh sister barbara met napoleon beth's sister sister best sister she got glasses i went to their preach when she first come in the message i didn't even know it for some reason i preached on cigarettes i don't even know why i just i think the holy spirit led me off i started blasting cigarettes i didn't know she was addicted to cigarettes i never smelled cigarettes on her she came up for prayer and i rebuked that spirit in the name of jesus christ praise the lord she said she went home she smoked one more cigarette threw it away and she's been delivered for these last 10 years [Music] who what what was that say was cast out i don't know why she had no one more i don't know that's between her and god but she had one more and it was gone amen yeah so just you know the use in the name of jesus christ is a great privilege amen because it is power is authority amen it's the power of eternity over satan amen amen hallelujah amen praise god but in the last days the bible says they'll deny the name they deny the power and where is it it's in revelation 13 5-6 can you put it up there sure the bible says the beast the brother brother man called this triple blasphemy yeah there was given him a mouth this is speaking of the beast the beast out of water which was rome speaking great things and blasphemies and powers given under to continue 42 months now that's the that's the first half of the tribulation right and he opened his mouth and blaspheme against god the blessing what his name so what does the catholic church do they blaspheme the name yeah right they call it they actually have it in their books i i can show it to you if you're not a catholic you're actually cursed i don't care what they say in the newspaper their books haven't changed right they say you're cursed if you're not a catholic yeah if you don't do the father son holy ghost and these things and you don't obey what the pope says you're cursed all right see because they're blaspheming so they're saying anyone outside of us is cursed by safety they're basically calling us the curse by satan they're calling the believers satan satan worshipers that's blasphemy to call the works of jesus be elizabeth is blasphemy this system has blasphemed the name of jesus christ but we've received the name of jesus christ we've got the power of eternity of the name of jesus christ amen hallelujah we've got the keys to the kingdom the name of jesus christ hallelujah amen hallelujah it was prophesied blasphemy church means to slander to speak evil it means to detract when someone blasphemes they slander something good and call it evil sure they detract from the holiness of god that means they take away the value or worth of that holy baptism that we have praise god the water baptism and the spirit baptism amen because there's doctrines of baptisms amen amen there's one there's actually three baptisms there's water baptism lord jesus christ there's the baptism of the human mind right that's what john the baptist said then there's the baptism of the soul which is what they have in the day of pentecost the church said amen that's why the hebrews says in hebrews 6 the doctrine of baptisms the first principles of the doctrines of the faith amen amen hallelujah that's exactly right go to deuteronomy 29 16. deuteronomy 29 16. that blocks a busy body back there maybe you got it all right i pick on my own first rescue i'm gonna get on sunday night just kidding probably 29 16. uh hey man uh do um so this is all about how the catholics bless themselves when they do that they're actually blessing themselves right sir what's it called it's they're taught to bless themselves using the sign of a cross and the titles father so he goes they're blessing themselves like that's what he went in the holy water brother ray was telling me they walk into church and they sprinkle themselves they're blessing themselves they're anointing themselves with holy water yeah like you like we have any power to anoint ourselves like we have power to anoint water right like that yeah now god could if god wanted to but like every time you walk into church okay i'm holding now that's they actually believe that as long as that eucharist is in their body now they're holy but when it goes out then they don't have the holiness anymore they got to go back and get the holiness aren't you glad church that the holy ghost it is sealed lock stock and barrel it's locked in i mean it's tied in there there's no way to get it out it's sealed through the damn redemption amen don't come out when there's not a leak in it there's not it doesn't come out when you're sick it doesn't leak out it's in your name it's a part of you it's a part of your character it's a part of your being you and the father are one amen hallelujah that's why when no gibson did that movie the passion which some parts were good but other parts were all catholic right he went to mass every single day to make sure he was under the anointing isn't that sad you got to go eat a wafer and drink some uh drink some grape juice i don't even know if they use wine brother oh they do okay well that's one good thing that's a good thing there one good step but he had to make sure he was under the anointing the church also you've got to get on anointing and say jesus forgiven my sins i'm going to obey your word amen we don't got to go have a mass and do all these things and bow down open up and swallow it ridiculous nonsense and act like jesus just died right that's what they do they act like jesus just died right there when they do transubstantiation right they call it they call it the present calvary yeah calvary's present jesus is literally dead right there he's dying right there he's dead right there and then they partake of his blood and his his body yeah that's what they that's what they believe literally what they believe yes it's called transubstantiation look it up sometimes it's true they're not ashamed of it no well i'm not ashamed of our truth either praise god amen hallelujah okay haven uh read 16 huh all right next one yes turned away from this day from the lord our god to go and serve the gods of these you're going to see the next verse they're going to bless themselves when does a person bless themselves just walk around and say i'm blessing you jesse i'm going to bless you today hey you're blessed i'm blessing you you ever do that no you don't bless yourself now i like what other people say god bless you brother jesse i sure yeah thank you lord thank you keep me blessed yeah but we don't bless ourselves right right we're told to bless others bless those who persecute you pray for those who despite the using we're told to bless others but not ourselves so who what is the condition of a person who blesses themselves all the time their hearts turned away from god they think they can bless themselves yeah you can't bless yourself mercy only god can bless you and god will only bless you when you obey the word that he's revealed to you praise god hallelujah next verse 19. that's all let's all read this one two three and it come to pass when he heareth the words of this curse that he blessed himself in his heart saying i shall have peace though i walk in the imagination of my heart to add drunkenness to things leave it out there isn't that what they're doing they're walking in the imagination catholicism is actually real yeah like mary's actually taking down those and say jesus do you mind it uh can i bother you do you mind if i bother you can you meet these needs right here like jesus like mary can intercede that's what they believe right brother believe they believe jesus is mad with them right going to the father she goes to the father god yeah for us right because uh jesus gets pain every time we sin and he's mad at us right you showed that we showed that from your schooling and then well if anybody's gonna if anyone's gonna get jesus attention it's gonna be mary that's what they believe yeah insane but if jesus is god he can hear all of our prayers amen they say he's all god but he can't handle all their prayers what a lie what a contradiction my god is not that least my god is greater than that [Applause] see they they spew out these lies but they're constricting their own false doctrine amen full of lies full of contradictions amen see they bless themselves rather than let god bless them how many want to be blessed by god amen i don't want to be under god's curse i want to be under god's blessing amen see so we let we obey god's word and then god will bless us i was praying for a financial blessing to help out some of those saints in uganda because they are going through a famine a literal famine i asked the one brother uh he's a messenger pastor i said brother oh no i'm sorry yeah i talked to him and then one of his members emailed me asking for money i said well doesn't your pat did you ask your pastor for money i was just kind of i was wondering yeah and she's like well yes but they only give us like a couple handfuls of meal every sunday for the whole week the church how many of you could last two handfuls of meal for the whole week and that's what these and they sent me pictures where they're they're still having outdoor services trying to attract people they're up there dancing now you think after all that dancing and clapping and praising god don't you think they get hungry now they they they can still get it somewhere else but because the ti the pastor gets a little bit i mean he just gets a little bit of ties and offers just a little bit right so see it's a very it's a very difficult thing for them anyways i was praying lord sent us a blessing i got i go come in from work yesterday and there's two letters and both of them were checks i started feeling good i'm like well thank the lord hallelujah i didn't ask for these i got two nice checks in the mail praise the lord just donations to our church so i said that's going to you god that's one of those people that don't have anything yeah they already have anything and i was just praying a few days ago lord please send something please send something see god god could feed them through supernatural he could just create bread there but he'd also like to train some of our character to pray for them and feel their burdens and be able to pray more and humble humble ourselves and brother jesse said amen humble myself and stop worrying about my first world problems and start caring about people who they have to make it through a week with a couple handfuls of bread of course they could you know they could try to work elsewhere but they said the economy's so bad because of famine so church how many are blessed today praise god very bad so blessed yes so blessed uh i want to try to bring this down to close here so let me see where i can go here help me jesus i just need the grace of the lord here i think uh yeah let's just close with first john 5 7. if you turn there that's all it's all turned in i think i'll just close with that one because that's the order of the book that i go so in the book towards the end of the chapter i just list all the the main scriptures that trinitarians disagree or the transgenders misinterpret like genesis 1 26 uh matthew 28 19 first john 5 7 some other ones the main ones that they use thank you all right let's read that on for you all of us one two three for there are three that bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost and these three are ones so trinitarians look at this and they say this says three persons does this ever does this does anyone see where it says three persons no no that's it at all but rather it gives support that god is one person because it says these three are one one one these three are one what are what are three there are three manifestations right because god is invisible before there was any space of time there was god but god had to make manifestations he had to appear the word manifest means to appear he had to appear he was invisible amen he had appeared he appeared as the father right he appeared as the word the son and he's appearing today as the holy ghost praise god hallelujah so it doesn't say three persons no it's three manifestations just like matthew 28 19. sure and see church just so the truth there's a catholic watching this son is not a name because it doesn't say the word sun here it says word right so sun is not a name if some was a special word john who knew the sun he laid in the bosom of the sun would he use the word sun if it was a special name it's not a name it's a title right it's a manifestation right so they're interchangeable sun and word are interchangeable because in the beginning was the word the words with god the word was god right and then the bible said in revelation 19 jesus was clothed with a vesture dipped in blood and his name is called the word of god what do you call the son the word of god hallelujah amen now what's not familiar is that most people don't understand these three manifestations will bear record in heaven for every person in other words you lived under one of these three dominions either lived under the father manifestation or the father dominion the son dominion or the holy ghost dominion and each one will witness against or for you amen thank god thank god the holy ghost will witness for us amen amen that we believe the word we repented we got baptized in the name of the lord jesus christ amen we believe what the bible says about everyone healing and and miracles holy and doctrine and all these wonderful blessings and mysteries we believe what it says we believe what the bible says the holy ghost will witness to that in heaven that we believed it amen amen hallelujah like i've said this many times but i'm resting my soul on that yes i've left denominations i've got friends i've left everything for this message i'm resting in my soul that this revelation is thus saith the lord amen amen they're calling me heretics they've all forsaken me they call me uh i've lost my rocker i don't know what they're saying mercy i don't want to know what they say all right that's okay sticks and stones may break my bones but words will never hurt me right they won't ever hurt me but see we're standing on the revelation of god's word you live in the days before the sun let's go to jude uh jude 1 and verses 14 and 15. if enoch preached to you then the father was a witness against you if people if people rejected enoch's preaching that rapture boy their hair wraps your type there amen the seventh from adam whoever received believe enoch of the father witnesses for them but whoever rejected enoch the father would witness against them the bible said he prophesied of these saying enoch the son from adam prophesied he said behold the lord cometh with ten thousand of his saints enoch prophesied of the battle of armageddon to execute judgment upon all to convince other ungodly among them of all their ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed and all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners have spoken against him it sounds like jude wants us to know to be godly amen amen he says there are ungodly speeches there are ungodly lies so church what should our we should have godly prayer means godly services we should dress godly we should talk godly we should live godly we should be godly amen amen hallelujah if not it's judgment executed against the ungodly was the father's warning because the sun had not come right moses said i call heaven and earth to record this day against you that i've set before you life and death blessing and cursing therefore choose life that both thou and thy seed may live i call heaven and earth to witness against you right because there be witnesses on the earth human witnesses on the day of judgment but heaven also witnessed when god sent a prophet heaven would vindicate the prophet you know brother and use the same verse i think it was uh i'll look it up i think it was anointed once at any time i couldn't remember which one it was but he said so say i to you in the name of jesus christ don't you add one thing to the revelation god has given very badly amen i thought heaven and earth now think about the people that have added to brother revelation heaven and earth will witness against them sure that they that they became the eighth messenger or they allowed polygamy or they made every word on the tape thus saith the lord it's gonna witness against them right see i call heaven and earth what what dispensation was that that was the father dispensation these three bear record in heaven the father the word and the holy ghost these three are one now i could go many more remember i read to you a few weeks ago malachi said the father was a witness against the ungodly jewish men who mistreated their wives god will be of the father we a witness against them on the day of judgment because he sent the word he said the word through malachi praise god hallelujah that old testament prophet see god witnessing against heaven god went i'm sorry god witnessing from heaven to earth jesus said the works the same works that i do bear witness to me that the father has sent me sure so his works would witness of him that means if they turn down the works the works will witness against them sure jesus said the word that i've spoken to you the same shall judge him at the last day aren't you glad you're letting the word judge you right now praise god right i'm not going to wait for the last name for i want the only i want to look the hard sayings in the bible and i would look at them now and say god forgive me change my heart give me a new heart give me your spirit give me your give me a new spirit new heart new spirit give me all that so i can fulfill your word right now i can be judged now praise god hallelujah i can be forgiven now bless god because jesus said the words that i've spoken will judgment at the last day sure that includes jesus words but also jesus words through paul because paul said my gospel will judge all of them remember his gospel is the judgment standard hallelujah jesus said remember we went through this a few weeks ago jesus said there's going to be two witnesses rise up on the day of judgment he said the queen of the south men of nineveh they're gonna rise up against that generation and of course jesus will be standing right there on the throne or sitting rather right there on the throne see the father is a witness the eternal spirit the son is the witness and today the holy ghost is a witness i'll put up acts 5 31-32 today the holy ghost gives witness for people when they're born again so if you're not born again keep believing until you're born again praise god amen amen that is heaven's witness that god has accepted your faith amen amen that's what the bible says god him hath god exalted with his right hand to be a prince and a savior for to give repentance to israel forgiveness of sins and we are as witnesses how we are witnesses of these things and so also the holy ghost whom god has given to them that obey him praise god amen hallelujah so the witness today that god is with you is that god lives in you praise god by the baptism of the holy ghost and so see on the day of judgment the father the word and the holy ghost will bear witness because whichever dispensation you lived in the word that was preached the works that were done that either witnesses for you you accepted it or witnesses against you because you've turned it down i'll be glad to be in the house of the lord tonight amen because you're a witness for the truth your witness for the revelation hallelujah and jesus said any word spoken against this will not be forgiven in this world neither in the world to come now we saw it on sunday people can blaspheme ignorantly like paul did and even paul blast him and then he tried to get other people to blaspheme but he didn't realize jesus was god but once he met jesus once he knew jesus was god then he said lord what must i do amen that's why we're here tonight lord what do you want me to do with my life how do you want me to invest my short few days on this earth my little humble insignificant life how do you want me to invest in just tell me what you want me to do and i'll do it praise god amen that's humility praise god that's what paul said when he first got saved lord what do you want me to do what shall i do jesus i got a job for you please preach to the gentiles go to jerusalem so church is in closing let's stand to our feet musicians can come first john 5 7 when it's closely examined it's clear john was not listing three persons that will sit on three thrones in heaven there is no scripture that says there are three thrones in heaven there's only one throne in heaven amen right look it up in uh revelation 4 the bible says one throne one sat on the throne not three thrones right so john is not listing three persons he's rather showing god three manifestations that serve as heavenly witnesses for all the action of humanity true praise god true hallelujah church that's the greatest witness we could have today is that the holy ghost receives us amen hallelujah the holy ghost witnesses our lives are real christian lives justified sanctified filled with the holy ghost constantly on fire for god amen signing crying for the abominations of this world praise god amen that's real christianity how many one part of that real christianity praise god amen amen let's bow our heads here just pray
