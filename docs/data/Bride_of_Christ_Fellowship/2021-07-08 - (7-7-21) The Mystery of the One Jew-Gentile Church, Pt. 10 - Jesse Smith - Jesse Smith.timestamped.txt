[0:00] will need for animal blood right
[0:02] something to fish that
[0:03] and jesus announced it on calvary it is
[0:06] finished amen
[0:07] three words hallelujah fulfilled all
[0:10] these animal sacrifices
[0:12] all these seemingly unending sacrifices
[0:15] the blood of jesus christ finish it once
[0:17] and for all so church you can know for
[0:19] sure
[0:19] your sins are finished as well praise
[0:21] god amen
[0:22] therefore let the devil tell you they're
[0:24] not they are finished you've confessed
[0:26] them they're underneath the blood
[0:27] of the cross of calvary glory
[0:31] now look at verse 18 here we did the
[0:33] loaves in verse 17
[0:34] leviticus 23 18 if you have your bibles
[0:37] you shall offer with the bread
[0:38] seven lambs remember that the bread was
[0:40] an offering you
[0:42] being waived you are waived your life
[0:44] church is an offering to the lord
[0:47] hallelujah that's why whenever god
[0:49] allows you just say praise the lord
[0:51] or you might be baptized you have
[0:53] trouble no i confess all my sins i'm not
[0:55] backside
[0:56] my life is an offering unto the lord
[0:59] hallelujah
[1:00] see seven lambs without blemish in the
[1:02] first year
[1:03] and one young bullock and two rams they
[1:06] shall be for a burnt offering unto the
[1:07] lord
[1:08] with their meat offering and their drink
[1:11] offerings even an offering made by fire
[1:13] of sweet savor unto the lord then shall
[1:16] you sacrifice one kid of the goats for
[1:18] sin offering
[1:18] and two lambs of the first year for a
[1:21] sacrifice of peace offerings
[1:23] and the priest shall wave them with the
[1:25] bread of the firstfruits
[1:27] for a wave offering before the lord with
[1:30] the two lambs
[1:31] and they shall be holy to the lord for
[1:34] the priest
[1:35] praise god so along with these loaves of
[1:39] bread you had
[1:40] numerous animal sacrifices and uh just
[1:43] as
[1:43] i preached back in the winter time in
[1:46] the philippians series i showed the five
[1:48] there's five sacrifices in the old
[1:50] testament right notice
[1:51] all five are present burnt meat
[1:54] drink sin and peace offering all are
[1:57] present on the day of pentecost in other
[1:59] words
[2:00] all offerings were to be already
[2:02] represented
[2:03] see the burnt offering represents total
[2:06] devotion to god because christians give
[2:09] them
[2:10] to god's work praise god remember
[2:13] remember
[2:14] paul told timothy give yourself holy
[2:16] unto your preaching gift
[2:18] not partially god god doesn't want a
[2:21] partial sacrifice
[2:22] god don't want a partial offer give god
[2:24] all you have
[2:26] see offer a burnt offering this is the
[2:28] time to do it it's the feast of weeks
[2:30] praise god
[2:31] this is the time to give all of yourself
[2:33] praise god to the baptism of the holy
[2:36] ghost amen
[2:37] and then meat and drink offerings
[2:39] symbolize bread and wine
[2:41] do they not they symbolize the communion
[2:43] the constant communion that we have
[2:45] praise god in other words
[2:46] we are to keep these sacrifices until
[2:48] the lord comes
[2:50] show his death until he comes it's a
[2:53] sacrifice
[2:54] and i think we'll have communion this
[2:55] sunday because victoria's been asking me
[2:57] right so i want
[2:58] if i announce it then i got to do it and
[3:00] then i can't forget if i announce it
[3:03] let's have the lord's supper this sunday
[3:04] night by the gods grace and i'll try to
[3:06] watch my time
[3:07] just remember somebody remind me on
[3:08] sunday i try to watch my time in the
[3:10] morning so don't wear everybody out
[3:12] but we want to have the the lord's
[3:13] supper you know when someone gets
[3:14] baptized
[3:15] new we want to get them a chance to have
[3:17] the lord supper praise god
[3:21] so see now that's three offerings the
[3:22] fourth the sin offering represents our
[3:24] constant need
[3:25] for jesus's forgiveness of sins through
[3:28] his heavenly role
[3:29] as high priest mediator
[3:32] right according to hebrews hebrews
[3:34] teaches that that jesus
[3:36] is our high priest he ever lives to make
[3:38] intercession
[3:40] unto god for us aren't you glad he's
[3:42] there today
[3:43] for you when you need help he's there
[3:45] praise god
[3:46] he doesn't take a break he doesn't take
[3:48] time off you don't take a two-week
[3:49] vacation
[3:50] he don't take any time off he's always
[3:52] there he lives
[3:53] with eternal life to make intercession
[3:55] to help out you
[3:57] when you need it so that's what the sin
[4:00] offering represents
[4:01] you church you and i always have a sin
[4:03] offering amen
[4:04] we always have a blood that lays at the
[4:06] altar of god for us
[4:07] to forgive our sins to pardon our
[4:09] iniquity he knows how to take away our
[4:12] sin
[4:13] so he always during this feast of weeks
[4:15] he always has a sin offering there
[4:17] praise god
[4:18] remember the sin offering really took
[4:20] place there uh
[4:21] at the passover right but here it's
[4:23] shown again we still have a sin offering
[4:26] there's still an offering god will
[4:28] accept our offerings amen and god has an
[4:30] offering for us as well praise god
[4:33] amen now i noticed this uh i just want
[4:36] to share this thought you know lydia and
[4:37] i
[4:37] i think my wife and i were talking how
[4:39] uh
[4:41] you know there's a there was a teacher
[4:42] that taught you know husbands are
[4:44] prophet priests and kings
[4:46] and uh one of the authors uh said that
[4:49] you know
[4:49] that you know husband's one of those
[4:51] they're they're either a prophet priest
[4:53] or king well that's wrong we're all
[4:54] three
[4:56] we're a pr we're prophets because we
[4:58] prophesy through the holy spirit
[5:01] right we prophesied of your dad's
[5:03] healing you did
[5:05] i did i prophesied of it right i was
[5:08] speaking it before it happened
[5:11] see so we as that's why i want to share
[5:13] that with lydia i don't think a chance
[5:14] to talk about it but just came to my
[5:15] heart
[5:16] the bible already says we are kings and
[5:18] priests unto god
[5:19] if you're born again you already are
[5:21] both a king or queen
[5:23] and a priest praise god you have
[5:25] dominion like we saw last week went into
[5:27] that
[5:27] you have dominion over sin that proves
[5:30] you are a king
[5:31] that proves you're of royalty of heaven
[5:33] praise god
[5:35] because you rule over your former sins
[5:37] former addictions and your former life
[5:39] you rule over that as a king and a queen
[5:42] with authority
[5:43] and your authority is the name of jesus
[5:47] and then you're a priest your prayers
[5:49] make intercession praise god
[5:52] your god uses you to pray for people and
[5:55] god hears their prayers
[5:57] like we pray for johnny god healed him
[6:00] remember naomi and beatrice prayed for
[6:01] my wife with zion
[6:02] and god heard it god answered it the
[6:04] very next day and all was well praise
[6:06] god
[6:07] see because each one of us are
[6:08] interceding unto god your prayers mean
[6:11] so much praise god
[6:12] and we gotta battle discouragement when
[6:14] it seemed like god answered
[6:16] we gotta overcome that and say i'm a
[6:18] priest anyway
[6:19] i know i've offered it unto god and
[6:20] god's going to take care of it praise
[6:22] god
[6:23] because i'm a priest my my sacrifice and
[6:26] my service wasn't in vain
[6:28] there's nothing that's done in vain in
[6:30] the lord praise god
[6:33] and then as a prophet as we said your
[6:34] life prophesies
[6:36] your words prophesy of victories to come
[6:40] hallelujah they prophesy of blessings to
[6:43] come and
[6:44] victories that we're going to see and
[6:46] people that are going to be saved praise
[6:48] god and all these things that we're
[6:49] speaking by by faith
[6:51] or by hope it's prophetic praise god
[6:54] it's prophetic that god is going to do
[6:56] something god is going to do it so
[6:57] church we're
[6:58] all three prophet priests and king just
[7:00] like christ
[7:01] amen he's all three
[7:06] now the last one was peace offering now
[7:08] remember peace offering another word for
[7:10] that is a thank offering
[7:13] so it's not like we think peace but it
[7:14] actually means a thank offering in the
[7:16] hebrew
[7:16] if you actually look at it in other
[7:18] words
[7:20] we have we must give voluntary
[7:21] expressions of thanksgiving
[7:23] and we give it through our praises
[7:26] hebrews 13 15 says
[7:28] by him therefore let us offer the
[7:30] sacrifice of praise to god
[7:32] continually that is the fruit of our
[7:34] lips giving thanks to his name
[7:36] church we already offered some peace
[7:38] offerings tonight praise god
[7:39] thank you jesus for the blood of light
[7:42] amen
[7:43] see we've already see we we sometimes we
[7:45] just forget how often we're giving
[7:47] sacrifices
[7:49] our whole life is a sacrifice praise god
[7:51] every time we read our bible
[7:53] or pray for somebody or try to witness
[7:55] or sing a song
[7:56] or put on the worship it's a sacrifice
[7:58] pleasing unto god amen
[8:01] because that's our life our life is
[8:02] priestly work our life is prophetic work
[8:05] our our life is royal authority work
[8:08] praise god
[8:08] we're doing god's will by his word amen
[8:12] so see all these sacrifices were present
[8:16] at the feast of weeks and so we see them
[8:18] present today
[8:19] praise god in our lives now go to
[8:21] deuteronomy 16 verse 10.
[8:23] here's a little more uh revelation about
[8:26] the feast of weeks god gives it to moses
[8:29] i'm sorry moses rather repeats it right
[8:32] before he goes off the scene in
[8:33] deuteronomy
[8:34] remember deuteronomy means second law
[8:36] and so
[8:37] moses was rehearsing the law a second
[8:39] time before he died
[8:41] that's what deuteronomy is it's a it's a
[8:44] repeat
[8:45] right before he dies and remember he
[8:47] charges joshua all those good words
[8:48] only be strong only be courageous god is
[8:51] with you praise god
[8:52] any any he instructs them to be
[8:55] overcomers
[8:56] now look at verse 10 10 11 12
[9:01] and thou shalt keep the feast of weeks
[9:02] under the lord thy god with a tribute of
[9:04] a
[9:04] free will offering of thine hand which
[9:07] thou shalt give unto the lord thy god
[9:08] according as the lord thy god has
[9:10] blessed him we looked at that
[9:12] see god just in this species of weeks
[9:14] god just wants you to give it from your
[9:15] heart
[9:16] we're not legalists praise god we're not
[9:20] denominational people
[9:22] right we are we are uh christians with
[9:24] hearts
[9:25] that love to worship god it's not a
[9:28] grievous thing
[9:29] it's not a hard thing to praise god
[9:32] right it's an
[9:32] easy thing it's a glorious thing to
[9:35] praise god hallelujah
[9:37] yeah we'll battle minds and we'll battle
[9:38] for a little bit but overall our lives
[9:41] it's an e it's a joy to serve god it's a
[9:44] blessing and we
[9:45] freely choose to do that we surrender or
[9:47] give our free will to god's will
[9:50] see it's a free will so god wants in
[9:52] other words god wants spontaneous
[9:54] worship in this time
[9:55] like i said at your home put on the song
[9:58] in your car
[9:59] god wants spontaneous praising of the
[10:01] lord hallelujah
[10:02] just worshiping he said just give me a
[10:04] free will offering bring me whatever you
[10:06] want based upon how much i blessed you
[10:10] see this is this is all for the gentiles
[10:12] right the jews and gentiles
[10:14] the one church this is a revelation for
[10:16] us
[10:17] bring it from a free will heart a
[10:19] voluntary heart
[10:22] oh my verse 11 and now look here what's
[10:26] the attitude during this feast of weeks
[10:28] and thou shalt rejoice before the lord
[10:31] thy god
[10:33] thou and thy son and thy daughter and
[10:35] thy manservant thy maidservant levi that
[10:37] is within thy gate
[10:38] and the stranger and the fathers and the
[10:39] widow and that are among you in the
[10:40] place
[10:41] which the lord thy god hath chosen to
[10:42] place his name there and thou shalt
[10:44] remember that thou was a bond man
[10:46] in egypt and thou shalt observe and do
[10:49] these statutes
[10:51] now church god jesus said blessed are
[10:53] those who mourn
[10:54] for they shall be comforted but the
[10:56] bible also says there's a time to mourn
[10:59] and then there's a time to rejoice now
[11:02] we look at churches and
[11:03] we want to look at our church too if
[11:05] we're mourning too much
[11:06] something's wrong with us because this
[11:08] is a feast of rejoicing praise god amen
[11:12] see when we pray up when we come to the
[11:14] house of god when we sing from our
[11:15] hearts it ought to change us out of
[11:17] mourning
[11:18] into rejoicing praise god because this
[11:20] is the feast
[11:21] of rejoicing remember god's good man
[11:24] good to your sons
[11:25] god's been good to your daughters god's
[11:27] been good to the stranger he's been good
[11:28] to the mother the father the children
[11:30] god's been so good let's rejoice let's
[11:33] give him
[11:33] a blessing and honor based upon what
[11:36] he's blessed us with praise god
[11:38] this is a harvest time this is a harvest
[11:40] of wheat time praise
[11:42] god this is a time to rejoice look what
[11:44] god has blessed us with
[11:45] it is our joy to give voluntary free
[11:48] will offerings unto the lord
[11:51] hallelujah
[11:55] that's how i was telling mj after
[11:56] service we were talking out there i said
[11:58] brother i've served god long enough i
[11:59] beserve god in the message now

[12:10] it becomes more of a joy it becomes more
[12:13] automatic can i say like that it becomes
[12:15] more routine
[12:17] it just becomes more of a joy because
[12:19] he's you know he's young
[12:20] and he's struggling with praying at home
[12:22] and you know i'm sure he wouldn't mind
[12:23] you know he's he's a real wonderful
[12:24] brother he's real open real open
[12:26] but i said that's my testimony that it's
[12:29] not a hard thing to study the word it's
[12:31] not a hard thing to sing praises unto
[12:33] god it's not a hard thing to come to
[12:34] church
[12:35] it's a joy to worship god it's an honor
[12:38] to praise the lord because i see
[12:39] what god's brought me from he brought me
[12:41] out of egypt and can i say like this
[12:43] he's kept me from going back praise god
[12:46] he's taken me out of egypt he took me

[14:22] forget that
[14:23] we've received christ right now amen
[14:25] hallelujah
[14:28] now look church rejoicing so this is
[14:31] exactly fulfilled
[14:32] on the day of pentecost the bible said
[14:35] they look like they were drunk and full
[14:37] of new wine
[14:39] and then god said rejoice under this
[14:41] worship
[14:42] rejoice in this feast and the bible said
[14:44] they
[14:45] they declared the wonderful works of god
[14:48] look what the lord has done
[14:49] god has done so many wonderful works he
[14:52] brought his son to die for our sins
[14:54] his son raised from the dead he forgave
[14:56] us he justified us and now he's filling
[14:58] us with power
[14:59] look what the lord has done amen they
[15:02] were just so rejoicing
[15:03] in what god has done and we should
[15:05] rejoice in what god has put in our
[15:07] hearts amen
[15:09] hallelujah because the kingdom of god
[15:12] romans 14
[15:13] 17 is not in meat and drink but
[15:16] righteousness peace and joy in the holy
[15:19] ghost
[15:21] that's the kingdom of god the real
[15:23] kingdom of god is righteousness
[15:25] peace and joy in the holy ghost
[15:28] in fact i'm right you know i took a
[15:30] little break but i was writing on my
[15:31] next book was on family
[15:33] i got about one i mean one chapter and i
[15:34] just had to take a stop to finish up
[15:36] this other one
[15:37] but that's how i kind of frame it you
[15:38] know i frame it with that scripture your
[15:40] home you want your home
[15:41] to be like a kingdom where in it dwells
[15:44] righteousness
[15:45] peace and joy if you can establish your
[15:49] home with those three things
[15:51] the kingdom of god is going to be there
[15:53] right
[15:54] if you can make right make sure
[15:56] everything's done righteously
[15:57] right if you can keep peace amongst each
[16:01] other
[16:02] and if you can have joy then you have
[16:05] the kingdom of god in your home
[16:07] that's how i'm forming it there because
[16:08] the kingdom of god must be within you
[16:10] and if it's within you it goes to your
[16:11] home
[16:12] and it's not in the meat and the drink
[16:14] so much it's in the righteousness peace
[16:16] and joy of the holy ghost
[16:19] so if you need like you know people like
[16:20] list right people like checklists so
[16:22] here's a checklist for your house just
[16:23] make sure you got righteousness peace
[16:25] and joy
[16:25] you're good you got you got the holy
[16:27] ghost flown through there praise god
[16:29] right joy the lord and right everybody's
[16:31] living righteously before the lord
[16:32] everybody's honest sincere
[16:33] all the sins repented of taken care of
[16:35] and you've got peace with god and peace
[16:37] with each other
[16:39] now now i want to um
[16:45] i want to just take a moment here my uh
[16:47] my my
[16:48] understanding of the day of pentecost
[16:50] has changed
[16:52] okay i used to think that the 120 were
[16:55] all speaking galilean
[16:57] so i've i've i've changed my thought on
[17:00] that because let's go to acts 2 4. i've
[17:02] changed my thought
[17:03] i still believe they were of course
[17:04] galilean but i actually believe they
[17:06] were now speaking in other languages
[17:08] so there was a coptic language you know
[17:10] there was a greek language there's all
[17:11] these 17 different languages
[17:13] i actually believe now that they
[17:14] actually were speaking in
[17:16] unknown tongues to them you know they're
[17:18] unknown to them
[17:20] but all the hears we're hearing them
[17:23] because of acts 2 4 and so i have to be
[17:25] uh honest and say i was wrong for all
[17:27] those years that
[17:28] because of acts 2 verse 4 because it
[17:31] says other
[17:32] languages now there are quotes on both
[17:34] sides just so you know
[17:35] so i'm not you know i'm not making this
[17:37] a big deal i'm not going to major on a
[17:38] minor to me this is a minor
[17:40] but it does free some people who have
[17:42] act uh
[17:43] who have spoken in unknown tongues when
[17:45] they got the holy ghost
[17:47] right because before i thought well they
[17:48] were just speaking galilean
[17:50] and so maybe they would have heard it
[17:52] and they would have been a little
[17:52] confused
[17:54] so i've i've just changed it because of
[17:55] what acts 2 4 and then isaiah 28 says
[17:59] so acts 2 4 and they were all filled
[18:02] with the holy ghost that began to speak
[18:03] with
[18:04] other languages or other tongues
[18:07] as the spirit gave them utterance and
[18:09] then there were dwelling at jerusalem
[18:10] jews devout men out of every nation
[18:12] under heaven now this was noise abroad
[18:14] the multitude came together and were
[18:15] confounded because
[18:16] that they heard them speak in his own
[18:19] language
[18:20] and they were all amazed and marveled
[18:22] saying one another behold are not all
[18:23] these
[18:24] which speak galileans it's actually for
[18:27] example like peter i believe
[18:28] peter was probably praising god but it
[18:30] was coming out as greek
[18:31] because there were there were greek
[18:32] people there right and before i thought
[18:35] it was
[18:35] he was just saying galilean i just feel
[18:38] like i was wrong
[18:39] okay now let's go to isaiah 28. i feel
[18:41] like i'm learning here
[18:42] you know my wife helped me with that one
[18:44] and another guy on youtube said
[18:45] you know brother jesse i appreciate you
[18:48] but you got to check this out and i was
[18:49] like okay
[18:50] so i had two witnesses on it i went and
[18:51] studied it i'm like yeah you know that
[18:53] that does make more sense than that
[18:57] look at verse 11 28 11
[19:01] for with stammering lips and another
[19:03] tongue
[19:04] will he speak to this people okay so
[19:08] so on the day of pentecost peter was he
[19:10] was filled with the holy ghost and then
[19:11] he started shouting they must have been
[19:12] shouting because it got noised abroad
[19:14] right
[19:15] and people just walking by here's a
[19:17] greek man
[19:18] he walks by and he hears people shouting
[19:20] and screaming in greek jesus christ is
[19:22] risen from the dead the holy ghost is
[19:23] here
[19:24] the power of god's here and he's like
[19:25] what and then he and then he just stands
[19:27] around for a little bit they go share it
[19:28] around
[19:29] i just heard greek up there these guys
[19:30] are hebrews i mean what is that upper
[19:32] room going on up there
[19:33] and then pretty soon they gather around
[19:35] and those guys by the way so they jumped
[19:36] out of windows they ran down the stairs
[19:39] into the streets praising god amen and
[19:41] then they said these are drunk men and
[19:43] peter stands up somehow
[19:45] and this might have been the miracle
[19:47] peter might have been preaching in
[19:48] galilean here this was the galilean
[19:50] peter was preaching in galilean and they
[19:52] all heard it in their languages
[19:54] so that's the best way i could
[19:55] understand it now i'm still willing to
[19:57] grow and understanding if i got it wrong
[19:59] but that's what it seems like because
[20:01] isaiah 28 11 stammering lips
[20:04] and another tongue another language will
[20:06] i speak to this people
[20:10] now look at this to whom he said this is
[20:12] the rest wherewith you may cause the
[20:13] weary to rest
[20:14] this is the refreshing yet they would
[20:16] not hear
[20:18] okay so the refreshing came on the day
[20:20] of pentecost the rest for your soul
[20:23] came on the day of pentecost aren't you
[20:24] glad you can rest you're not warring
[20:27] you're not trying to earn salvation
[20:28] you're not trying to fight to be saved
[20:30] you already are saved your soul is
[20:32] resting that
[20:33] jesus finishes jesus lives inside of you
[20:36] he put his spirit in you so you would
[20:37] rest in your salvation
[20:39] you would rest in your place with god
[20:41] that god has peace with you as well
[20:45] hallelujah and now all the works we do
[20:48] are by appreciation
[20:50] i don't do works to be saved i'm already
[20:52] saved i'm already filled with the holy
[20:53] ghost
[20:54] there's a totally different spirit
[20:55] inside of me than before it was a
[20:57] worldly spirit a sinful
[20:59] lustful selfish spirit inside of me
[21:00] before but now i've got the spirit of
[21:02] christ amen
[21:04] i meant it all i can do is think about
[21:06] him all the time all i can do is
[21:07] meditate about
[21:08] and even when i try to get away for a
[21:10] little bit it always comes right back to
[21:12] jesus
[21:12] i'm a prisoner praise god we're
[21:14] prisoners of christ jesus
[21:17] amen now
[21:21] i'm going to leave that subject i just
[21:22] want to brief you with that one uh
[21:24] because you probably hear me preaching
[21:25] about it more in the future but so now i
[21:27] believe just you know i believe they
[21:28] were speaking in unknown tongues to them
[21:30] but then when peter got up there then he
[21:31] spoke in galilean and then
[21:33] the miracle hearing took place there
[21:36] okay so that's how i understand it now
[21:41] now i just want you to know scripture
[21:42] speaks about three different
[21:44] harvests there's a harvest here for
[21:46] barley
[21:47] a harvest here for wheat and then a
[21:49] harvest here
[21:51] for fruits okay so there's three
[21:54] harvests going on so christ was the
[21:58] first fruits and each man is harvested
[22:01] in their own order praise god
[22:03] so christ was like the barley we are the
[22:06] believers the jew the new testament
[22:08] church is like the wheat
[22:10] and then the 144 thousand are first
[22:12] fruits
[22:13] fruits unto god okay
[22:17] so just so you know it's exodus uh 34
[22:20] 22. i'll just read it it says the first
[22:23] fruits of the wheat harvest
[22:24] and then ruth 2 verse 23 says so she
[22:27] kept fast by the maidens of boaz to
[22:29] glean
[22:30] unto the end of barley harvest and a
[22:32] wheat harvest
[22:33] and dwelt with her mother-in-law so
[22:35] there's a barley harvest here
[22:37] in march there early april and then
[22:39] there's a wheat harvest there in may
[22:41] all the way to august september so just
[22:44] so you know that is scriptural
[22:46] okay now i just want you to notice this
[22:48] too church now let's look at
[22:50] prophetically
[22:52] now if you take 2021 our year
[22:56] minus the year jesus died 30 a.d
[22:59] you have 1991 years
[23:05] we are the gentiles are almost at 2 000
[23:08] years
[23:09] but i want to tell you we've actually
[23:11] had more time god has had
[23:12] more long suffering on us than the jews
[23:15] because moses got the law in 1491
[23:20] and it ended in 30 a.d the old covenant
[23:23] was passing away
[23:24] and god was bringing a new one moses and
[23:27] and his covenant lasted 1521 years
[23:32] so now the gentiles have had almost here
[23:36] 400 extra years in the jews you know why
[23:39] because god is long-suffering god is
[23:41] rich in mercy praise god
[23:44] hallelujah that's why that's why people
[23:47] in the next nine years brother william
[23:49] they'll be guessing the rapture comes in
[23:50] nine years nine years
[23:53] right semi-2030 i've already heard
[23:55] people talk about that
[23:57] i've already heard different people put
[23:58] numbers together and talk about 2023 and
[24:01] 2030 you know
[24:04] no man knows the day of the hour no man
[24:05] knows the dare hour let's just be ready
[24:07] for his coming
[24:08] i want you to show that this is the long
[24:10] this is a longer period right this is
[24:14] 1991 years
[24:16] god has offered salvation the baptism of
[24:18] the holy ghost to the gentiles
[24:22] what a time this is a long this is the
[24:24] longest of the harvest right
[24:25] the longest time now i already preached
[24:29] on the former and latter rain
[24:31] the very first sermon remember of this
[24:33] series this is part 10.
[24:34] so part one i started with the former
[24:37] and latter rain
[24:39] now just let's just review it just
[24:41] briefly
[24:44] every harvest season needed a latter
[24:47] rain to
[24:48] mature the crop so before the first
[24:51] fruit harvest
[24:52] there had to be a latter rain and a
[24:54] former rain
[24:56] so the former rain was at the beginning
[24:57] of the planting season the latter rain
[24:59] came right before the first fruits
[25:02] or the harvest that's when the harvest
[25:03] started right because that was the first
[25:05] ones brought to maturity
[25:08] right so there had to be a latter rain
[25:10] before
[25:11] any harvest there has to be a lot of
[25:12] rain because that brings it to maturity
[25:14] and the mature ones are harvested first
[25:17] so uh so with the feast of weeks
[25:21] there had to be a former rain now these
[25:23] were these were wheat crops they were
[25:24] probably planted after the barley crops
[25:27] so they had become a former reign for
[25:28] the wheat and then a ladder rain
[25:31] but prophetically god kind of breaks
[25:34] this cycle
[25:36] right and god says in the book of james
[25:39] he says be patient under the coming of
[25:41] the lord he said the lord hath long
[25:43] patience until he received the early
[25:46] and latter rain establish your hearts
[25:49] from
[25:50] for the coming of the lord draws nigh so
[25:52] james shows us we're in a spiritual
[25:54] season here
[25:55] where before the coming of the lord we
[25:57] need a former
[25:58] and later rain praise god so see god
[26:02] breaks this last age down and he says
[26:04] you need a former
[26:05] and latter rave be patient because the
[26:08] harvest is coming
[26:09] the lord is patient let us be patient as
[26:12] well
[26:12] but there will come a former and later
[26:15] rain to harvest the crop
[26:17] before the i'm sorry to mature the crop
[26:19] before the harvest
[26:21] okay so what i'm saying is there's a
[26:23] spiritual former latter reign
[26:25] before the rapture that's what i'm
[26:27] saying because the bible
[26:28] talks about it in james it also talks
[26:30] about it church
[26:31] in amos
[26:35] yeah it also talks about the spiritual
[26:37] famine and amos a famine in the last
[26:39] days
[26:40] not a famine for bread or water but the
[26:42] hearing of the words of the lord
[26:45] right people these denominational
[26:47] churches they're not really hearing the
[26:48] word of the lord
[26:49] they're just hearing god loves you god's
[26:51] gonna bless you god's gonna make you
[26:53] rich
[26:53] that's all they're hearing the real word
[26:55] of the lord is repent
[26:58] and be baptized forsake your sins
[27:02] hate your sin and let the kingdom of god
[27:04] come into your soul praise god
[27:06] but they leave all that repetitive stuff
[27:08] out you know they leave most of that out
[27:10] they'll mention it one time in the
[27:11] sermon
[27:13] and see they're not really preaching the
[27:15] full message the full word of god
[27:17] that the bible gives us that we should
[27:19] preach aren't you glad for the full word
[27:20] of god
[27:22] hallelujah see there's a famine in this
[27:26] day
[27:26] people are really people that are
[27:28] spiritual are really hungry for the word
[27:30] of god
[27:31] hallelujah the bible says they'll fly
[27:33] around the world the bible says they'll
[27:35] go from sea to sea
[27:36] seeking the word of the lord and shall
[27:38] not find it oh
[27:40] my look at that they can't find it but
[27:42] you did amen
[27:45] they weren't looking all around the
[27:46] world sisterhood for this word they
[27:48] couldn't find it but you did
[27:49] amen hallelujah we you know
[27:52] uh they're trying so hard they're
[27:54] putting money in millions in the
[27:55] building churches
[27:56] thinking they got the word lord but they
[27:58] don't but we've got it it's thus saith
[28:01] the lord
[28:02] it's just like it was in the days of the
[28:04] apostles we have a prophet with us
[28:06] saith the lord and now we've got to take
[28:08] that thus saith the lord
[28:09] and prophesy again
[28:13] oh it's beautiful church it's beautiful
[28:18] what what a great story remember the
[28:20] word former means teacher
[28:22] so that's why brother man's ministry he
[28:24] tells us in the church age book
[28:25] was a teaching ministry right
[28:29] but later reign of course uh is the
[28:32] final he calls it rapturing faith
[28:35] right so we have to be first taught the
[28:37] word of god uh by an anointing of the
[28:39] holy spirit right a reign of the holy
[28:41] spirit
[28:42] right and then receive another reign for
[28:45] rapturing faith
[28:48] right so in other words we don't have to
[28:50] worry about working up
[28:51] rapturing faith rapturing faith is going
[28:53] to come down on us amen
[28:56] just like the teaching reign fell down
[28:59] on you and taught you to love god
[29:01] taught you to repent taught you be
[29:02] baptized with the holy ghost just like
[29:04] that fell on you
[29:05] the rapturing faith is going to fall on
[29:07] you as well
[29:09] oh my let it rain let the windows of
[29:12] heaven open
[29:13] and let it rain praise god hallelujah
[29:17] now there's a key scripture i'm going to
[29:19] bring out and we must really
[29:21] wait for the holy ghost for this one
[29:23] zechariah 10 1. this is one i forgot you
[29:25] need to put this one in the vision
[29:26] sermon i talked about it
[29:27] you know we got to grow together grow
[29:28] individually right we talked about that
[29:30] grow the world
[29:31] but also church zechariah 10 verse 1
[29:34] says ascii of the lord reign
[29:37] in the time of the latter
[29:40] rain so the lord shall make bright
[29:43] clouds and give them showers of rain
[29:45] to every one grass in the field listen
[29:48] church
[29:49] there's going to come a real spiritual
[29:51] time someday hopefully soon brother
[29:52] william
[29:53] where the preachers are going to start
[29:55] getting in one accord it's time to pray
[29:57] for the latter rain
[29:59] and ain't going to be like let's just
[30:00] pray for it and it's a cold prayer
[30:01] meeting
[30:02] like we're going to pray and the
[30:04] anointing's going to fall down and
[30:05] people are going to get filled with the
[30:06] holy ghost
[30:07] i'm talking about right before the
[30:08] rapture because the bible says pray for
[30:11] it
[30:11] pray when it's the time of the latter so
[30:13] we have to know is this a time of latter
[30:15] rain
[30:16] can we sense the season can we see all
[30:18] the signs that
[30:20] that the lord is going to come soon
[30:22] there's going to be another
[54:02] you
