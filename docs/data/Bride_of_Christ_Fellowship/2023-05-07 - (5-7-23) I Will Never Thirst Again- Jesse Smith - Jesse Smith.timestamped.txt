[0:00] right before service I selected that as
[0:02] my text
[0:03] for this morning so I thought that was a
[0:06] definite indication
[0:07] that we're on the right
[0:09] mind of Christ by God's grace John
[0:11] chapter 4 verse 10.
[0:13] I'd like to preach on I will never
[0:15] thirst again praise God
[0:18] John chapter 4 verse 10.
[0:21] Hallelujah
[0:22] I will never thirst again praise God
[0:25] Hallelujah
[0:37] John 4 10 we'll read 10 down to 14.
[0:42] it looks like Lord willing
[0:46] to do communion this morning would that
[0:48] be okay
[0:49] Don't Preach too late
[0:51] I guess I'm just concerned the kids get
[0:52] too hungry if I preach too long so
[0:56] they get a little famished you know
[0:58] I don't want that to happen
[1:01] try to see by God's grace I remind Eve
[1:03] Malachi when he gets back to do me a
[1:05] little Aaron here but anyways let's read
[1:07] our text and we'll have you be seated
[1:08] and have a word of prayer and trust God
[1:10] to speak to our hearts
[1:12] what a joy to Worship the Lord today
[1:13] amen all the songs and all the specials
[1:16] wonderful songs
[1:18] John's 4 verse 10.
[1:24] I'll start at verse 10 and I'll read 10
[1:26] 11 12 13 and then we'll all read 14
[1:28] together verse 10 says Jesus answered
[1:30] and said unto her if thou knewest the
[1:32] gift of God and who it is that saith to
[1:35] thee give me to drink thou wouldest have
[1:37] asked of him and he would have given the
[1:39] Living Water
[1:41] the woman saith unto him sir thou has
[1:44] nothing to draw with and the well is
[1:46] deep from whence then hast thou that
[1:49] Living Water
[1:50] art thou greater what a question art
[1:52] thou greater than our father Jacob which
[1:55] gave us the well and drank thereof
[1:57] himself
[1:58] and his children and his cattle
[2:00] Jesus answered and said unto her
[2:02] whosoever drinketh of this water shall
[2:05] never thirst again let's read verse 14.
[2:08] ready one two three but whosoever
[2:11] drinketh of the water that I shall give
[2:14] him shall never thirst but the water
[2:17] that I shall give him shall be in him a
[2:21] well of water springing up into
[2:24] everlasting life praise God let's have a
[2:26] word of prayer do you have a need on

[3:32] name and Saint said amen God bless you
[3:34] as you're being seated praise God
[3:37] I'd like to preach on I will never
[3:39] thirst again
[3:40] yeah
[3:41] oh yes yes open the windows I was going
[3:43] to tell somebody to get the fan if you
[3:44] want the fan
[3:46] by God's grace
[3:52] do you think we need a fan darling he's
[3:53] always ask my wife
[3:55] sorry to put you on the spot there
[3:57] you think anyone think we need a fan
[3:58] does anyone anyone want a fan by God's
[4:00] grace
[4:01] I'd be okay okay no preference all right
[4:03] okay hopefully this doesn't help well
[4:05] have somebody get the fan here
[4:08] by God's grace so thank you
[4:14] so by God's grace will preach here on
[4:16] this little thought it's kind of like an
[4:17] Evangelical thought it's not like a
[4:20] teaching or anything like that I just
[4:21] kind of like to preach the scriptures
[4:23] let me set a timer here so I can make
[4:25] sure we have enough time don't go over
[4:27] too late for a communion and uh
[4:30] communion of course is talking with the
[4:32] Lord and that's what we came to do today
[4:34] praise God talk with the Lord
[4:36] we sure enjoy talking with one another
[4:37] but the main thing is to talk with the
[4:39] Lord Jesus today praise God
[4:41] speak to the Holy Spirit and we know the
[4:43] holy spirit will speak back Hallelujah
[4:46] so we open up with our text here that's
[4:47] a very familiar text to us of course
[4:49] Jesus ministering to the uh the woman at
[4:52] the well
[4:53] and I love what brother Ram says about
[4:55] this brother Graham says this woman had
[4:56] a had more of God in her than the
[4:59] priests had
[5:00] this woman had no theological training
[5:03] she didn't go to a seminary
[5:06] but she knew more about God than the
[5:08] priest did that rejected Jesus the
[5:11] Pharisees Sadducees and herodians and
[5:13] all the all the different groups there
[5:16] and this woman had we'd say a
[5:19] predestinated seed inside of her heart
[5:21] and life and and brother Branham of
[5:24] course used this verse often to show
[5:25] this is how Jesus interacted with people
[5:30] and uh this is he said this is how Jesus
[5:33] would contact their spirits
[5:35] another word for that would be discern
[5:37] their spirits
[5:39] and so we see here this example of
[5:42] course this woman is a Samaritan now
[5:44] Samaritans were some of the leftover
[5:46] Jews that were not taken out there were
[5:49] descendants of the leftover Jews who
[5:51] were not taken out when uh when
[5:53] Jerusalem was uh the people were exiled
[5:55] and all the different nations and then
[5:56] those leftover Jews they intermarried
[5:58] with gentiles
[6:00] and so that's why they're called
[6:01] Samaritans because they're not they
[6:03] weren't full Jews they were we'd say
[6:06] half Jew
[6:07] and of course then the when the Jews
[6:09] came back they came back with their
[6:12] man-made Creeds and and uh they actually
[6:14] learned all those they started all those
[6:16] man-made Creeds while they're in
[6:17] captivity and uh they added books unto
[6:19] the Old Testament
[6:22] and they came back with those
[6:23] denominational thinking and then those
[6:25] the dominations you know the uh uh they
[6:28] rejected the Samaritans right they
[6:30] because they weren't in their group
[6:31] right they weren't in their denomination
[6:34] uh but we see here by God's grace that
[6:36] this woman had a a revelation of the
[6:39] Messiah praise God
[6:41] and uh she as she was talking you know
[6:44] we know that Jesus started Discerning
[6:46] your hearts and and started telling more
[6:49] or new things that she never heard
[6:51] before
[6:53] she never heard that uh uh that that a
[6:56] man could give water that would cause a
[6:58] person to never thirst again hallelujah
[7:01] oh thank God thank God we met that man
[7:04] hallelujah amen aren't you glad he came
[7:06] to you Hallelujah
[7:08] I gave you a drink of his living water
[7:10] what a blessing praise God and so she
[7:12] asked you know are you greater
[7:14] than Jacob our father and of course he
[7:17] could have said a lot of things he could
[7:18] have said before Jacob was I am right
[7:21] just like he said before Abraham was I
[7:23] am Hallelujah in other words the spirit
[7:25] that was in Jesus was God hallelujah it
[7:28] was the creator Hallelujah it was it was
[7:31] the invisible God and the visible God
[7:32] created a body to dwell in and that
[7:35] body's called his son Jesus Christ
[7:36] Hallelujah but God was speaking the
[7:39] father was speaking through the son amen
[7:42] and God here speaks through Jesus and
[7:45] and discerns the thoughts and intents of
[7:48] her heart and I just want to bring out
[7:49] you know this uh just a simple thought
[7:51] of of Jesus says if you would know who I
[7:54] am you'd ask me for Living Water
[7:57] and he then he would give it to him now
[7:59] I want to just you know just make this
[8:00] plain and simple Church all God desires
[8:03] is that we ask for Living Water
[8:05] in other words we've got to stop
[8:07] thirsting for the things of the world
[8:08] we've got to stop caring for the things
[8:10] of the world and really trying to live
[8:12] out the things of the world we've got to
[8:14] repent of thirsting for the world and
[8:17] we've got to have a genuine thirst for
[8:18] Jesus Christ amen for God almighty
[8:21] praise God and then if one does that
[8:23] then Jesus says I will give you that
[8:25] water and then he says then you will
[8:27] never thirst ever again hallelujah
[8:30] praise God Amen thank God so you want to
[8:33] just preach a little bit on this and uh
[8:35] and hopefully a few helpful thoughts
[8:37] from the word of God here by God's grace
[8:41] now uh this might be helpful you know
[8:43] for Amish friends here you know in this
[8:45] case in this story Jesus is Discerning
[8:48] the thoughts of a Samaritan
[8:51] now in John chapter 1 he discerned the
[8:53] thoughts of Jews
[8:55] okay so let's go to John chapter one
[8:59] it was Nathanael
[9:01] John chapter one
[9:06] verse 44.
[9:09] and this this is an important part about
[9:10] brother Adam's Ministry brother Irvin so
[9:13] that's why I just thought I'd bring this
[9:14] out wasn't in my notes but I thought I'd
[9:15] just bring it out so you can see it
[9:17] uh now Philip was was of baseda the city
[9:21] of Andrew and Peter Philip findeth
[9:23] Nathanael and say that and we have found
[9:25] him of whom Moses in the law and the
[9:28] prophets did write Jesus of Nazareth the
[9:31] son of Joseph and Nathaniel said in him
[9:33] can there any good thing come out of
[9:35] Nazareth
[9:36] Philip say to him come and see him
[9:38] brother man says that's what you'd
[9:39] always tell people just come to church
[9:41] amen
[9:42] if there's questions about what you
[9:44] believe and how do you know I know
[9:46] that's true just come and see praise God
[9:49] just like the Queen of Sheba just come
[9:50] praise God no matter how far the
[9:52] distance is if you're hungry for God God
[9:54] will satisfy your thirst amen Hallelujah
[9:57] just come and see in other words church
[9:59] that ought to be encouragement if we
[10:01] don't feel like we can explain the
[10:02] message we don't feel like we can
[10:03] explain the Mysteries or explain all
[10:05] these things you don't have to explain
[10:07] nothing you just have to say come and
[10:09] see praise God Amen Hallelujah you might
[10:12] be gifted to explain some things and
[10:13] praise God for that amen so in other
[10:16] words just say whatever the spirit of
[10:17] God wants you to say but at the very
[10:19] least we ought to be able to say come
[10:20] just come and hear the word of God
[10:21] hallelujah
[10:23] amen hallelujah because it's the word of
[10:25] God that has life Hallelujah hey man I
[10:28] feel right at home this morning praise
[10:29] God
[10:30] if you like it last Sunday too I was
[10:32] right at home in the garage
[10:34] because it's the same Spirit like
[10:35] brother Irvin said the same Spirit
[10:37] praise God the Holy Spirit praise God
[10:39] amen
[10:40] now if we go down here to verse 47.
[10:44] now Jesus saw Nathanael coming to him
[10:46] and say them behold in Israel I indeed
[10:49] in whom there's no guile or no pretend
[10:52] Nathaniel wasn't a pretender
[10:55] that's why he was a straight shooter
[10:57] right he's like he's like can anything
[10:59] good come out of Nazareth he wasn't
[11:00] gonna say well maybe I'll go listen he
[11:02] was a straight shooter can anything good
[11:03] come out of there
[11:04] there had been nothing good come out of
[11:06] there
[11:07] and he was just telling it like it was
[11:09] and so the first thing Jesus does he
[11:11] starts Discerning the thoughts and
[11:13] intents of his heart
[11:15] and Jesus tells him something about
[11:17] himself that only Jesus could know
[11:20] Jesus knew he was not a pretender
[11:23] and Jesus calls out he discerns his
[11:25] spirit and said you are a man that's
[11:27] completely transparent amen hallelujah
[11:31] now I don't know about you but I seek to
[11:33] be more like that praise God
[11:35] in other words I don't like conflict all
[11:37] the time I don't like to being upset I
[11:40] don't like to talk about hard things so
[11:42] I need God's help to be a better uh a
[11:44] better Communicator praise God
[11:46] and I'm not perfect and no one is and
[11:48] anyone that claims that is wrong only
[11:50] Jesus is perfect praise God but I just
[11:52] want you to see what kind of man
[11:53] Nathanael was
[11:55] a man with no guile
[11:58] Hallelujah verse 48 Nathanael say to him
[12:01] whence knoweth thou me when did you know
[12:04] me
[12:06] and before that Philip called thee when
[12:09] thou was yeah I'm sorry Jesus answers to
[12:11] them before the filth called thee when
[12:13] thou was under the Fig Tree I saw thee
[12:15] so brother man says look Jesus had a
[12:17] vision of Nathanael
[12:19] and he must have been praying under the
[12:21] tree or really asking God God is there
[12:23] really a messiah is this really the time
[12:25] for the Messiah remember history says
[12:27] numerous people rose up claiming to be
[12:28] Messiahs and they draw people out in the
[12:30] wilderness and they'd get murdered kind
[12:31] of like the Jim Jones thing and all
[12:33] kinds of antichrist Spirits would rise
[12:35] up because Satan has an idea when God's
[12:37] Gonna you can kind of see things
[12:38] changing and kind of knowing God's word
[12:40] is going to be fulfilled
[12:43] but here Jesus tells him I had a vision
[12:45] of you Philip
[12:47] I was listening to brother Brown last
[12:48] night in a communion uh 1957 on the
[12:51] drive home and he's like how many have a
[12:53] how many he said how many are sick in
[12:55] here he said not too many how many have
[12:57] a prayer card he said okay he said but
[12:58] he said God is here
[13:00] uh and he said we don't even need prayer
[13:02] cards
[13:04] he said I see that light now he said I
[13:06] see a circle in the building and he
[13:07] shares I counted he went through seven
[13:09] people
[13:10] called out their name their address what
[13:12] they're going through
[13:13] and with each one his faith has got
[13:15] stronger and stronger and stronger now
[13:18] who do you know that can do that
[13:20] nobody like I can't even remember five
[13:22] things I can't remember one thing about
[13:23] five of you you know so people say well
[13:26] brother man memorize that and they were
[13:27] uh they were just they were faking it
[13:30] that's nonsense
[13:32] he preached a whole hour and a half
[13:33] sermon and then memorized seven things
[13:35] about seven details about people and and
[13:37] all these things impossible it was the
[13:39] Holy Spirit praise God because how do we
[13:42] know because he preached the word of God
[13:43] hallelujah amen thank God
[13:46] and there he discerns and he goes down
[13:48] through and tells him and each each one
[13:50] is the faith is rising until he says
[13:52] finally he said I'm out of strength he
[13:54] said just lay hands on one another and
[13:56] just believe he said speak to the Rock
[13:58] and they'll Walk The Rock will bring
[14:00] forth its water praise God that's what I
[14:02] want to end with today amen so I'm kind
[14:05] of jumping ahead of myself but you know
[14:06] how it is it's hard to hard to hold it
[14:09] back when you're preaching right brother
[14:10] Evan it's hard to hold it back that's
[14:12] where I'm going to get to by God's grace
[14:14] but here he sees a vision he said I saw
[14:16] you when you were under a tree well
[14:18] there would have been something
[14:19] Nathaniel remembered about being under
[14:20] that tree that was important
[14:23] like I said probably praying verse 49.
[14:25] Nathaniel answers her name Rabbi Thou
[14:28] Art the son of God
[14:30] Thou Art the king of Israel amen
[14:33] hallelujah amen so here we can see
[14:35] Nathanael had also a spiritual Gene
[14:37] inside of him anybody that can tell me
[14:39] the secrets and thoughts and Tents in my
[14:41] heart that can only be God hallelujah
[14:46] uh Nathaniel had heard about him oh this
[14:48] Messiah out of Nazareth and all but when
[14:50] he gets discerned and he and Jesus tells
[14:53] him only only something he knows how do
[14:56] you know me Lord how do you know me I
[14:57] saw you in a vision praise God that was
[14:59] the identity right there he's got to be
[15:01] the Messiah he said I will follow you
[15:04] you're the son of the Living God Amen
[15:06] and church when we come to church and
[15:08] God speaks Secrets or God gives brother
[15:10] Irvin John chapter four like I'm going
[15:12] to preach on that lets us know Jesus
[15:15] Christ is here amen
[15:17] Hallelujah
[15:18] amen I didn't even really know what I
[15:21] was going to preach today until the late
[15:22] this morning praise God I didn't even
[15:23] know and God takes me to John chapter 4
[15:25] brother
[15:27] because he's a discerner of the thoughts
[15:31] thoughts your heart
[15:35] and with his heart amen
[15:38] amen
[15:40] verse 49 Rabbi Thou Art the son of the
[15:43] god Thou Art the king of Israel Jesus
[15:45] answers unto them because I said unto
[15:47] thee I think I told this to brother
[15:48] Irvin last week or if not one of the
[15:50] other brothers maybe Daniel
[15:52] because I said unto thee I saw thee
[15:54] under the Fig Tree believe us thou Thou
[15:58] shalt see greater
[15:59] things than these now here we get a
[16:02] principle if you'll believe Jesus in his
[16:05] first Revelations your promise to get
[16:07] more praise God oh like that amen how
[16:10] many what more of Jesus Amen
[16:13] when you come to Jesus he discerns your
[16:15] life he tells you all about uh the the
[16:17] questions in your life he tells you the
[16:20] truth and then he says if you believe
[16:21] that you're going to get a whole lot
[16:23] more praise God Amen in church isn't
[16:25] that how the life of a Christian it goes
[16:27] from Faith to Faith from glory to glory
[16:30] from one Revelation to another praise
[16:33] God
[16:34] amen
[16:35] Hallelujah
[16:37] verse 51 he said in him verily bear I
[16:40] said to you Hereafter ye shall see
[16:41] Heaven open and the angels of God
[16:43] ascending and descending upon the son of
[16:46] man now that was fulfilled later in the
[16:48] ministry by God's grace
[16:51] so I believe if I'm not mistaken
[16:52] Nathaniel saw Jesus in a vision and
[16:55] Angels going up and down if I'm not
[16:57] mistaken praise God now I go to John 7
[17:00] 38 I believe I preach this at Amish
[17:02] Country a few weeks ago it might have
[17:03] been the first time I went but here we
[17:05] just see again another a witness that
[17:07] the Living Water
[17:09] is the holy spirit
[17:11] John 7 38.
[17:16] well actually let me just read 37. in
[17:18] the last day that great day of the feast
[17:20] Jesus stood and cried saying if any man
[17:22] thirsts let him come unto me and drink
[17:25] so the question is are we thirsty
[17:29] because Jesus invites everybody
[17:30] everybody can have a drink Jesus has
[17:33] enough water to feed this entire church
[17:35] amen
[17:36] Hallelujah and your friends and your
[17:38] family praise God he's got enough water
[17:40] praise God the question is are you
[17:42] thirsty for Jesus and all of us would
[17:44] say a hearty what we'd say a hearty amen
[17:46] hallelujah we say Jesus I'm thirsty I
[17:49] need Living Waters praise God I want
[17:51] your spirit to flow through me
[17:52] Hallelujah speak through me Hallelujah
[17:55] satisfy The Thirst in my life Hallelujah
[17:58] amen verse 38 he that believeth on me as
[18:02] the scripture has said out of his belly
[18:04] shall flow rivers of Living Water
[18:08] it might be in a song right I could sing
[18:10] you your love forever praise God
[18:12] Hallelujah any song I'm one of them I'm
[18:15] so glad I can say I'm one of them praise
[18:17] God it might be flown out through a song
[18:19] it might be flown out through a
[18:20] testimony it might be flown out through
[18:22] preaching it might be flown out through
[18:23] something but God's spirit if it's in
[18:25] you it's going to come out praise God
[18:28] the words are going to come out the
[18:31] Praises are going to come out praise God
[18:32] the worship is going to come out why
[18:35] because you've got life inside of you
[18:36] you've got a whale inside of your soul
[18:39] praise God
[18:40] oh thank God for the will Hallelujah
[18:43] thank you Jesus
[18:45] verse 30.
[18:47] eight
[18:48] you need to leaveth on me as a scripture
[18:49] I've said out of his belly shall follow
[18:51] rivers of Living Water so it's not a
[18:53] trickle now church we all get trickles
[18:55] at times right
[18:57] but we all go through hard times where
[18:58] the Praises really aren't ringing out
[19:00] like they used to
[19:01] remember he promised Waters rivers of
[19:05] waters
[19:06] and that's what the Bible says he
[19:08] restores our soul praise God hallelujah
[19:11] that's why David said my cup runs over
[19:13] amen cast me not away from thy presence
[19:15] of God take not your Living Waters for
[19:18] me amen restore the joy of my salvation
[19:21] restore the rivers of water Let the
[19:24] Praises flow out let the word of God
[19:26] flow out let me be a light Let Me Be A
[19:28] Witness let me testify to somebody about
[19:30] the life-giving Waters of Jesus
[19:32] Hallelujah
[19:34] amen
[19:36] Glory verse 39 but this fake heat of
[19:39] that of the spirit which they that
[19:41] believe on him should receive for the
[19:42] Holy Ghost was not yet given because
[19:44] that Jesus was not yet glorified
[19:47] as we went over this is the Holy Ghost
[19:49] and the soul of the believer praise God
[19:51] in the Old Testament the Saints could
[19:53] get the Holy Spirit on their body they
[19:55] could dance like David danced praise God
[19:57] hallelujah they could dance and Samson
[19:58] could lift up Gates and carry him on his
[20:00] back for miles and miles and miles
[20:03] and they had the anointing on the Mind
[20:04] where they could write the word of God
[20:06] they could prophesy they could do
[20:08] amazing things but the Holy Ghost had
[20:09] never come on the soul
[20:11] and so the sins the Bible said were
[20:13] fully abolished their sins weren't
[20:15] really done away with uh and so God
[20:18] couldn't fill their souls with the Holy
[20:20] Ghost but when Jesus came Jesus Paid the
[20:23] price Hallelujah in this case uh the the
[20:25] life of Jesus could come upon the
[20:28] worshiper in the Old Testament you want
[20:30] you wouldn't want the life of a of a
[20:32] goat to come on you
[20:33] you wouldn't want the life of a bullock
[20:35] to come on you you you you wouldn't want
[20:39] that but that was the sacrifices but the
[20:41] Bible said we have better sacrifice now
[20:43] amen we got one sacrifice once and for
[20:46] all and now the spirit of Jesus the
[20:49] spirit of the sacrifice can now come
[20:51] upon the believer praise God
[20:53] amen now he takes away all our sins and
[20:57] now the Holy Spirit falls on the soul of
[20:59] the believer
[21:00] oh thank you Lord
[21:02] now brother Adam says this in the
[21:04] Ephesian Church age
[21:06] I just got a couple of quotes I don't
[21:07] have a whole lot of quotes here
[21:09] he says uh now that tree back there and
[21:11] eat and that tree which was a source of
[21:13] life was Jesus
[21:16] in John chapter six through eight Jesus
[21:18] sets him forth sets forth himself as a
[21:20] source of eternal life he called himself
[21:23] The Bread of Heaven
[21:25] he spoke of giving himself and that if a
[21:28] man ate of him he would never die
[21:32] praise God he said he proclaimed that he
[21:34] knew Abraham and that before Abraham he
[21:37] was
[21:38] he prophesied that he himself would give
[21:40] Living Waters that if any man
[21:43] I'm sorry if any man drink he would
[21:44] never thirst again
[21:46] praise God but he would live eternally
[21:49] so what is this bread and this water
[21:51] it's eternal life
[21:54] oh I just caught it now Jesus said you
[21:56] won't hunger anymore for bread because
[21:58] I'll be your bread Hallelujah ah the
[22:01] bread and the wine amen he said I won't
[22:03] drink anymore he said you won't thirst
[22:05] anymore because I'll give you the the
[22:08] blood of my spirit praise God
[22:10] oh my thank God what a blessing praise
[22:13] God and what is it it's eternal life
[22:17] he said Jesus showed himself as The
[22:18] Great I Am he's the bread of life The
[22:21] Well of Life The Eternal one the tree of
[22:23] life he was back there in Eden in the
[22:25] midst of the garden even as he will be
[22:27] in the midst of the paradise of God oh
[22:30] my God Amen thank God for his Mercy now
[22:33] go to Ephesians 2 verse 3. this is a
[22:36] little lesson that was meant a lot to me
[22:37] a couple years ago Ephesians 2 verse 3.
[22:39] I preach a few sermons on thirst
[22:46] Ephesians 2 verse 3. I just think this
[22:48] would be helpful for all of us just a
[22:50] good refresher I know I need it so I
[22:52] feel like if I need it then I feel like
[22:54] the people might need it too praise God
[22:57] Ephesians 2 verse 3.
[23:00] now Paul's writing course
[23:02] this is a beautiful chapter on salvation
[23:03] and the gift of salvation but he says in
[23:05] verse 3 among whom also we all had our
[23:08] conversation in times past in the lusts
[23:11] of our flesh
[23:13] fulfilling the desires of the Flesh and
[23:15] of the Mind
[23:17] and we're by Nature the children of
[23:19] Wrath even as others
[23:22] now let's stop right there now the Bible
[23:24] says you have desires of your flesh and
[23:27] you've got desires of your mind
[23:30] like brother Daniel you're going to
[23:31] build something weren't you last week we
[23:33] were talking about you were going to
[23:34] build something
[23:35] for your business right so he was he was
[23:38] telling me a little bit about last week
[23:39] they're asking about getting the
[23:40] materials so brother Daniel had a desire
[23:42] in his mind to do something so the mind
[23:44] has desires I need to think about this I
[23:47] need to plan this out I need to buy that
[23:48] it's a good example buddy
[23:50] but the flesh has desires too
[23:53] well I need to eat or I need to drink or
[23:55] I need to do this or I need to exercise
[23:57] or I need to do that
[23:58] so we have desires both in our mind in
[24:01] other words your mind desires something
[24:03] every day and your body desires
[24:05] something every day
[24:06] but then also your soul desires
[24:09] something every day
[24:11] so brother Irvin we have three
[24:14] parts we have to feed and take care of
[24:16] all day every day praise God
[24:19] we got to take care of our bodies their
[24:22] desire things our mind and desire
[24:24] stimulation right of the things of God
[24:27] and our soul desires it as well
[24:29] Hallelujah and Jesus said If any man
[24:32] will thirst If any man will hunger I'll
[24:35] give him bread and I'll give him more
[24:37] honor praise God
[24:38] so all three parts of you all day are
[24:40] crying for something feed me or maybe
[24:43] give me sleep I'm going on four hours of
[24:44] sleep here so I feel like I'm doing
[24:46] pretty good about God's grace but my
[24:47] body's saying put me to bed I just
[24:49] couldn't sleep real good last night
[24:51] maybe all the excitement or something
[24:53] but your body's calling for something
[24:55] your mind is calling for something and
[24:57] your Soul's Calling for something and
[24:58] Jesus said if you can recognize that all
[25:01] those all three are calling for the word
[25:04] of God then you'll never hunger you'll
[25:06] never thirst you'll be satisfied God
[25:09] wants to satisfy all three parts of our
[25:11] being praise God
[25:13] amen
[25:16] so if you got your Bible let's go to the
[25:17] Book of Psalms here
[25:24] I've been on Psalms a lot lately
[25:29] and just bear with me just a second I
[25:31] want to look some up here here we go
[25:32] okay
[25:34] go to Psalm 17 here
[25:39] we're just going to flip through just a
[25:40] few verses I mean there's
[25:42] there's 16 verses in the Book of Psalms
[25:45] where David is talking about God is our
[25:47] satisfaction
[25:50] in other words you know we must satisfy
[25:53] our desires with Christ and Christ Alone
[25:57] now we got family members like we're
[25:58] praying uh for Sarah's brother by God's
[26:01] grace as she put a prayer request in we
[26:02] pray for him on Wednesday night
[26:04] and uh
[26:06] and there's family members that we know
[26:08] and love and they thirst for
[26:09] relationships or they thirst for money
[26:12] or popularity or or status or something
[26:15] we all we all thirst for for all these
[26:18] things but a Christian has to make God
[26:21] their number one and only thirst praise
[26:23] God Amen yes we got to have businesses I
[26:25] got to work we all got to work and make
[26:27] money and Feed the Children and and all
[26:30] the important things we have to do but
[26:31] the main thirst that's satisfied is our
[26:34] thirst after God
[26:36] Hallelujah now
[26:37] I said Psalm 17 15. as for me I will
[26:40] Behold thy face in righteousness I shall
[26:43] be satisfied when I awake with thy
[26:46] likeness
[26:47] how many want to wake up happy in the
[26:49] presence of God
[26:50] that's what the Bible if the Bible
[26:52] promised this you in the Old Testament
[26:53] what about the new amen
[26:56] I'll be satisfied with this presence
[27:00] go to Psalm 22 26.
[27:06] so I'm 22 26 the Bible says the meek
[27:09] shall eat and be satisfied they shall
[27:11] praise the Lord that seek Him your heart
[27:14] shall live forever amen a church what a
[27:17] promise if you spend any time seeking
[27:19] God God promise you'll find him
[27:21] Hallelujah
[27:22] what a promise God will satisfy you
[27:25] spend a little time with God spend a
[27:26] little time seeking God don't worry
[27:28] God's going to come and bless you God's
[27:30] going to come and meet you there praise
[27:31] God
[27:33] remember we preached it a few weeks ago

[27:36] food
[27:37] all the animals on land all the water
[27:39] animals they're all calling God God I
[27:41] need food God I knew food and God can
[27:43] take all those requests and say yes I
[27:44] meet that yes yes yes yes I'll take her
[27:46] he can meet all those requests and if he
[27:48] can meet the Beast request what about
[27:50] the children in his own image praise God
[27:52] what about his sons and daughters amen
[27:55] hallelujah
[27:57] Hallelujah if we have a thirst for God
[27:58] he's here to satisfy it amen
[28:01] thank God
[28:04] I like Psalm 36 8 if you would Psalms 30
[28:07] 8 6 because this deals with coming to
[28:08] church and that's my favorite thing in
[28:10] life is to go to church praise God
[28:11] wherever the people of God are that's
[28:13] where the church is
[28:14] it's not a building it's a group of
[28:16] people praise God
[28:18] Psalm 36 8 they shall be abundantly
[28:20] satisfied with the fatness of thy house
[28:24] oh thank God and thou shalt make them
[28:26] drink of the river of thy pleasures
[28:31] is that is that what the will of God is
[28:33] to you is the will of God pleasure to
[28:36] you
[28:37] even if it's hard
[28:39] we still got to recognize it's God's
[28:41] will it ought to be our pleasure to
[28:43] surrender to God
[28:45] it ought to be our desire to surrender
[28:47] to God and say God your ways are higher
[28:49] than my ways your thoughts are higher
[28:51] than my thoughts I'll trust in you your
[28:53] word will not return void you'll keep

[36:36] you and ordained you a prophet
[36:38] see church God has ordained a Ministry
[36:40] for all of us
[36:42] before you reform before you even came
[36:44] to this earth church if you're wondering
[36:45] what you're supposed to do just know
[36:46] God's going to let you know
[36:48] long for it long for it seek after God
[36:51] long for the things of God because God
[36:54] knew in advance what Jeremiah was going
[36:56] to be and God knows what you're going to
[36:57] be too praise God
[36:59] the thing to do is long for God
[37:01] and God will satisfy you praise God
[37:04] like I was talking with Brother John
[37:05] yesterday and
[37:07] we're talking about being fulfilled in
[37:09] life and he said are you fulfilled
[37:10] brother I said absolutely I mean I still
[37:13] desire more of God but I Feel So
[37:15] Satisfied with what God's done
[37:17] he's taking care of my family he's
[37:19] giving me a loving Church by God's grace
[37:21] and really that's the best thing you can
[37:22] say about a church is that they're
[37:23] loving
[37:24] right because Jesus said that you're
[37:26] known they're known that they're my
[37:27] disciples by their love one for another
[37:29] right
[37:30] I got a good job I can take care of the
[37:32] kids and
[37:33] get enough rest I don't have to work too
[37:35] much I shouldn't say too much but I got
[37:38] a good job praise God
[37:39] a lot of breaks you know to stay
[37:41] refreshed I said I feel fulfilled I feel
[37:44] satisfied you know God has Vindicated
[37:45] that uh that I'm I'm walking in the will
[37:48] of God I believe that by God's grace
[37:50] what a blessing to know that praise God
[37:53] that's what the Bible calls the mystery
[37:55] of God's Will and each person should
[37:57] should seek the mystery of God's will
[38:00] and church if you long for God's
[38:02] revelation he'll give you the Revelation
[38:03] like we're talking on the phone
[38:05] yesterday brother Ervin God wants to
[38:07] give Revelation so much and brother man
[38:09] says pray for Revelation more than
[38:10] anything else praise God
[38:12] pray for the will of God is it God's
[38:14] will to heal this person is it God's
[38:16] will to save that person is it God's
[38:17] will to do this in my life is it God's
[38:19] will to do that is it God's will for all
[38:21] your decisions that's fighting the
[38:23] mystery of God longing after God and God
[38:25] will satisfy you praise God
[38:28] amen sorry if I'm wearing you out here
[38:30] verse 13 here let me try to move on here
[38:32] Jeremiah 2 13.
[38:36] for My People Israel have committed two
[38:39] evils
[38:40] they have forsaken me the Fountain of
[38:43] Living Waters
[38:45] and have hewed them out cisterns broken
[38:48] sisters that can hold no water
[38:51] now one of the commentators said you
[38:54] know the world the Sinners the Gentiles
[38:56] they just done one evil
[38:58] they just got idols
[39:00] but Israel
[39:02] did two evils
[39:05] the the Sinners never knew God God
[39:07] didn't make himself known to them right
[39:10] he didn't call them and call them out of
[39:11] Egypt he called Israel out of Egypt so
[39:14] the the two evils are greater than the
[39:16] one evil
[39:18] and the first evil is that they forsook
[39:20] The Living Water
[39:23] and they hewed out cisterns now some
[39:25] writers say they would they would use
[39:26] mud and they'd uh they'd create like a
[39:28] pool and try to catch water in the
[39:30] cisterns others say that of course they
[39:31] might build a cistern with with wood or
[39:33] some other material brass or something
[39:37] but we see here the idea here is instead
[39:41] of taking the Living Water of God they
[39:43] wanted a stagnated water
[39:46] they thought well I'll just catch the
[39:48] water I'll try to catch and contain all
[39:50] this water
[39:51] I'll just try to contain the holy spirit
[39:53] in my denomination
[39:54] you can't do that praise God Amen it's
[39:57] impossible like brother Adam said God
[39:59] will move and but and the sad thing is
[40:02] people will build up a denomination they
[40:03] never should have done that when you
[40:05] build up the denomination you're
[40:06] building up the cistern
[40:08] and God said don't build a sister
[40:09] because I promise I always pour out
[40:11] fresh waters amen
[40:13] you don't need a sister because I'm
[40:15] going to pour it out from Heaven
[40:16] Hallelujah and there's no end to this
[40:19] rain there's farmer rain there's latter
[40:21] rain Saints God wants to rain Hallelujah
[40:24] oh thank God Amen
[40:27] and he says God rebukes him and said you
[40:29] built a cistern
[40:30] but it's even even that don't hold water
[40:33] your denomination can't hold the spirit
[40:35] of God in
[40:37] it's going to leak out and fail
[40:38] eventually
[40:41] so church we can learn a good lesson
[40:42] there's two evils first you forsake
[40:44] God's water
[40:46] and then people build a denomination
[40:48] well this is all God can do nothing more
[40:52] and brother man tells us always put a
[40:54] comma after everything you believe
[40:55] because God can give you a little more
[40:57] Revelation on the same revelation
[41:00] that's right Hallelujah
[41:04] so I thought you'd like that
[41:06] now the sermon brother random says
[41:09] you know I used to have this old sister
[41:11] and I had to pour water down there and
[41:13] Prime and Prime and Prime with this old
[41:15] sucker pump
[41:16] to get it up out of there you know pour
[41:18] some more water and it just poured a
[41:19] bunch of bugs and things in it to pump
[41:21] out bugs and things that's just about
[41:23] the way some of these systematic
[41:25] revivals is
[41:27] right they're trying to pump up the
[41:29] people to get a Revival but all the
[41:32] water that comes out is stagnated Waters
[41:34] right in other words man-made creeds
[41:37] God's three persons or everybody has to
[41:40] speak in tongues or it doesn't matter if
[41:42] you get tattoos or not or you can marry
[41:44] two or three times that stagnated Waters
[41:48] that's not a Revival no matter how much
[41:49] emotion no matter how much dancing or
[41:52] how much the music those are stagnated
[41:54] Waters God doesn't give those Waters
[41:57] at my grandma's when I was growing up I
[41:59] don't have any siblings in here I
[42:01] thought I thought maybe Betsy would be
[42:02] here or something like that my my
[42:04] grandma Smith had a pump and we had a
[42:06] pump and I had to pump and pump on that
[42:08] thing and finally some of the water from
[42:10] the pond would come out of there
[42:11] but there's always dirty water I
[42:13] wouldn't drink that
[42:14] I knew as a child don't drink that water
[42:16] you're going to get sick
[42:18] and yet the spiritual thing is don't go
[42:20] to denomination and drink their water
[42:22] you're going to get sick
[42:24] hallelujah thank God God doesn't tell us
[42:27] to go to denomination God doesn't tell
[42:29] us to go to the man-made Pub we've
[42:31] already got a living well praise God God
[42:33] doesn't tell us to go to the well God
[42:35] puts the well inside of ourselves amen
[42:37] hallelujah praise God
[42:39] thank God Amen
[42:41] so when you read your Bible in the
[42:43] morning you get some of that well water
[42:44] coming up and you read John chapter four
[42:46] praise God then the preacher preaches on
[42:48] it praise God hallelujah it's God
[42:51] feeding us with the Waters of his word
[42:53] hallelujah
[42:55] oh
[42:56] brother said but thank God there's a
[42:58] fountain filled with blood drawn from
[43:00] Emmanuel veins where Sinners plunge
[43:02] beneath the flood lose all their guilty
[43:04] stains
[43:07] Hallelujah
[43:09] he said just one taste of that water
[43:11] it's convincing to all kinds of courage
[43:14] to clergyman he says
[43:17] he said why should we want any swamp
[43:19] water
[43:20] or stagnated water
[43:24] he says how would you like to swap an
[43:26] Artesian well for swamp water full of
[43:28] bugs and contaminations of all kinds of
[43:30] man-made theories which God that said
[43:32] add one word to his word or take one of
[43:35] his words away his part will be taken
[43:37] out of the Book of Life
[43:39] my goodness
[43:42] Hallelujah let me read this
[43:46] he said what he said that's the matter
[43:48] with so many people's experiences today
[43:49] they're just full of Wiggle Tails
[43:51] wiggling from one to another in other
[43:53] words stagnated water
[43:55] and one to another telling tales that
[43:57] ain't got no true to it at all that's
[43:59] right wiggle out of one into another I
[44:01] was Methodist I joined the Baptist I was
[44:03] Catholic I went to this I went to that
[44:05] it's just wiggle Tales he said forget
[44:08] the whole thing
[44:09] in other words come out of her my people
[44:12] and come to the Fountain amen the
[44:14] Artesian well that ever living presence
[44:17] of Christ I believe them to be the
[44:19] inexhaustible Fountain of Life the more
[44:21] you get from him the fresher it gets
[44:25] the more you get from him the colder it
[44:27] gets the better it gets the sweeter it
[44:30] tastes amen
[44:32] come on somebody amen ain't that the
[44:35] truth praise God if we really thirst and
[44:37] long after God the services get better
[44:40] ah come on somebody amen the worship
[44:43] gets better the song specials get better
[44:45] praise God is that right the song
[44:47] service gets better the more you long
[44:49] after God the better it gets Hallelujah
[44:51] [Music]
[44:53] if it got old then God would be guilty
[44:56] appointing you to a broken cistern
[45:01] so when it gets old is it God's fault or
[45:03] is it our fault well we know the answer
[45:05] that
[45:05] amen but keep all your sins confessed
[45:08] keep calling on God keep longing for
[45:11] Jesus and he'll bring satisfaction
[45:13] oh Hallelujah
[45:17] he said I've been serving him now for 33
[45:20] years and each day grows still sweeter
[45:23] than it was the day before
[45:26] Jesus said you would never thirst if we
[45:29] drank of this water
[45:31] notice how great it is how many believe
[45:33] it's great
[45:34] Hallelujah
[45:38] let me just try to close here I'm
[45:39] already gone over half hour and that's
[45:41] really short for me by God's grace
[45:43] really short
[45:46] well you can see here
[45:47] God has water and he wants us uh to
[45:50] approach it in a certain way
[45:52] he wants us to come to him and daily
[45:54] seek water
[45:57] and not try to catch it in a man-made
[46:00] system
[46:01] well if I just do this like I did
[46:03] yesterday how many times that happened
[46:04] we gotta we got a blessing and a service
[46:06] well how did I play it in that service
[46:07] I'm going to try to repeat that again
[46:09] today now
[46:10] we got to be careful we don't make God
[46:12] like a an Aaron boy for us or God like
[46:15] some machine
[46:17] right well if I punch this and punch
[46:19] that I'll get the same results
[46:20] [Music]
[46:22] right now we always got to be faithful
[46:23] we always got to be obeying the word of
[46:25] God
[46:26] we have to understand God moves the wind
[46:28] blows and nobody knows when it's coming
[46:31] who knew that Revival was coming over
[46:33] there in the point anybody know that was
[46:34] coming I thought it might have come on
[46:36] Thursday night
[46:37] that's the first night everybody's got
[46:39] their most energy
[46:40] or maybe Friday night
[46:42] the last service brother Brooks is going
[46:44] to preach
[46:45] you never know
[46:46] but we know God wants to pour out a
[46:48] spirit we know the wind's going to blow
[46:50] so we gather with expectation we long
[46:53] and say God send your win send your ring
[46:55] send your power send your water and God
[46:57] is faithful when it comes just at the
[46:59] right time Hallelujah
[47:01] it comes as we're longing for God he
[47:04] pours out his Spirit he satisfies the
[47:06] Thirsty Soul amen

[47:10] thank God
[47:12] well let me close with this here because

[47:19] tonight buddy okay yeah so it'd be good
[47:21] to do it tonight here and brother Bang's
[47:23] here so I was hoping brother Vang and
[47:25] brother Austin could take it so we can
[47:26] do it today
[47:27] and our honest friends are welcome to
[47:28] communion with us when was the last time
[47:30] you did commune
[47:33] we haven't done it since I think
[47:34] November or December of last year I
[47:37] don't do it every month I just kind of
[47:39] do it as I'm led to the Holy Spirit by
[47:40] God's grace and that's okay the Bible
[47:43] just said just do it till he comes back
[47:44] he didn't say how often to do it so I
[47:46] felt led to do it today by God's grace
[47:48] and so we're happy to have all of you by
[47:50] the grace of God you're welcome to
[47:52] partake in the Lord's supper with us
[47:54] amen
[47:58] now go to well I'm going to close with
[48:00] this go to uh Exodus 17 6 Exodus 17 6.
[48:10] of course this is familiar if you listen
[48:12] to brother man preach I think he's
[48:13] preached it five times speak to the Rock
[48:17] Hallelujah speak to the Rock
[48:20] Exodus 17 6.
[48:24] yeah it seems like we get the
[48:25] landscapers always on Sunday in the
[48:27] spring and summer and fall that's okay
[48:29] God bless that man maybe someday we can
[48:31] keep witness into him I witnessed him to
[48:33] him before I'll try to do it again by
[48:35] God's grace
[48:36] all's will
[48:38] I was listening to brother Brown last
[48:39] night and he had to deal with jalopy
[48:41] races so jalopies are a certain type of
[48:43] automobiles anybody know what a jalopy
[48:44] is
[48:45] a certain brand of automobile and you
[48:47] can hear the jalopies racing we'll just
[48:49] have to raise our voices
[48:51] he said we'll just have to shop Down the
[48:53] Walls like Jericho you know
[48:55] praise God Amen I like that
[48:58] Exodus 17 6.
[49:03] now of course you know this this is uh
[49:06] the people are thirsty right God brought
[49:10] them out and they danced on the red
[49:12] Seashore praise God
[49:14] but pretty soon they get thirsty
[49:17] and the Bible said they start chiding
[49:19] with Moses
[49:20] give us water give us water
[49:23] and Moses in verse 4
[49:26] I'm sorry in verses verse 4 Moses cries
[49:28] unto God and says what shall I do on
[49:30] this people they be almost ready to
[49:33] Stone me
[49:35] isn't that interesting you know God used
[49:37] the Prophet The Prophet you God used the
[49:39] prophet to deliver them and then the
[49:41] next problem they have they want to
[49:42] destroy the leader right
[49:44] right we should we should have patience
[49:46] with everybody praise God
[49:48] let's be patient with that each and
[49:49] every person by God's grace
[49:52] but look but look how church it just
[49:53] shows it shows how quick we are
[49:56] to forget the testimonies
[49:59] right
[50:01] I mean you would think how could I ever
[50:03] forget walking through a red sea with
[50:05] water walls on the both sides of me
[50:09] that's true how could you but also how
[50:11] could we forever get what God did for a
[50:13] sister who and brother Bang's dad there
[50:15] how can we forget that great testimony
[50:17] or God bringing back Austin and then
[50:19] bringing Lena with him how can we forget
[50:21] that praise God see it's just human
[50:23] nature we're going to forget from time
[50:24] to time but the Bible says the Holy
[50:26] Spirit Will stir up our remembrance
[50:28] praise God
[50:29] and remind us of what he's done
[50:31] hallelujah
[50:33] so we don't judge Israel they didn't
[50:35] have the baptism Holy Ghost we were done
[50:36] the same thing right
[50:38] but verse 5 the Lord said unto Moses go
[50:40] on before the people and take with thee
[50:42] of the Elders of Israel
[50:44] and the thy rod wherein thou smote is
[50:47] the river taken thy hand and go behold I
[50:50] will stand before thee there upon the
[50:51] rock and aurob and thou shalt Smite The
[50:54] Rock
[50:55] and there shall come water out of it
[50:58] that the people may drink
[51:01] and Moses did so in the sight of the
[51:03] Elders of Israel
[51:06] Hallelujah now here we say we see that
[51:09] people are longing for water amen
[51:12] and Moses cries out to God and God said
[51:15] strike the Rock and water will come out
[51:18] of the rock praise God now you know the
[51:19] next time in numbers I think his numbers
[51:21] 20 I'm not going to go there but the
[51:22] next time God told Moses speak to the
[51:25] Rock
[51:27] and Moses disobeyed because he was upset
[51:30] with the people he magnified himself now
[51:32] preachers really got to be careful not
[51:33] to get upset with the people
[51:35] and the people got to be careful not to
[51:36] get upset with the preacher see we've
[51:39] all got to have the love of God
[51:40] hallelujah we all need the love and
[51:42] mercy and patience Marcia glad patience
[51:44] is one of those virtues he gives you
[51:45] praise God aren't you glad that's one of
[51:48] the fruits of the Holy Spirit
[51:49] naturally comes out of a Christian Life
[51:51] Hallelujah and you can be patient with
[51:54] one another
[51:56] but brother Adam uses that text there
[51:57] here Exodus 17 and numbers 20 and he
[52:01] brings it down to close he says tonight
[52:02] if you need a drink if you're thirsty if
[52:06] you're longing for God he said all we've
[52:08] got to do is speak to the Rock praise
[52:11] God
[52:12] and then when the Holy Spirit starts
[52:14] starts falling people are shouting
[52:16] rejoicing you can hear the prayers go up
[52:17] and he says he says now he said now you
[52:20] don't got to speak to him he said now
[52:22] praise the Rock
[52:23] hallelujah hallelujah Now Praise The
[52:26] Rock in other words he's here and he's
[52:28] going to meet your need God Hallelujah
[52:30] by God is here amen God's going to meet
[52:32] the need
[52:34] so now how many believe that can happen
[52:35] today praise God let's end our feet
[52:37] musicians you can come praise God before
[52:39] I take communion let's have a time of
[52:41] prayer let's speak to the Rock
[52:44] for all of our thirsts all of our
[52:46] desires praise God
[52:48] and how many believe God will minister
[52:50] to our needs amen
[52:51] he may not answer right away but he
[52:54] promised I'll answer in some way praise
[52:55] God
[52:56] you may have to wait
[52:58] he might tell you no he might tell you
[53:00] later
[53:01] he might do it right now
[53:03] but in God's wisdom he knows the best
[53:05] way to answer your prayer amen the main
[53:07] thing church is for every man and woman
[53:09] and child to thirst after God's water
[53:13] how many need more of God's spirit today
[53:15] let's bow our heads here for a word of
[53:17] Prayer
[53:18] now church do you pray in your own way
[53:20] I'm going to pray for these needs that
[53:22] we prayed for earlier
[53:27] if you're longing or you're thirsting
[53:29] for God to move or meet a need let's
[53:31] talk to the Rock today
[53:35] let's talk to the Rock who brings forth
[53:37] his Waters the Bible said in First
[53:39] Corinthians 10 that rock was who
[53:41] that rock was crying
[53:43] Christ became a dry Rock Christ became
[53:47] this this massive rock in a dry land and
[53:50] he smote him once and then all they do
[53:52] is speak to him and the waters would
[53:54] have come forth abundantly Church that's
[53:56] all we got to do is speak to the Rock
[53:58] Jesus Christ today
[53:59] let's pray together
[54:02] father God we're so grateful the rock is
[54:07] here amen we feel the rock we feel the
[54:10] presence of Jesus today
