word for we know the word gives life Lord the spirit quickens the word Lord so quicken it to our hearts and lives to take we're so happy Lord and we know you'll minister to every need we pray in Jesus Christ's name sure said amen god bless you let's take our Bibles here as we stand in reverence to the Lord let's go to Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12 praise God it's good to be with each and every one of you and the presence of the Lord praise God good to see the Saints in the house of Lord today praise God so thankful for God's amazing grace Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12 so just so you know bangs not here yet but if he gets in here pretty shortly I'll to stop the preach and real quick and recognize our musicians and our other officer we'll have two officers only two trustees brother Vega myself so we're so thankful and I appreciate everybody doing you know the pastor appreciation in October I appreciate that I always feel appreciated here I thank the Lord for all of you and all your faithful service to the Lord praise God so it's my pleasure to be pastor it's it's a it's a pleasure to try to Shepherd your souls preach you God's Word fellowship with you help you in any way I can it's a real privilege and we're thankful for van and all the musicians and everybody who plays their part to everybody everybody's just important praise God if you don't think that just get a little nick on your fingernail there so you see you feel about the little parts every little part is so precious remember I preached it to you a few months ago God God said him bye Paul God gives more honor to the things the smaller things that are at least least seen right the least esteemed among men men like to lift up preachers you know and things that are public but God honors those that men don't honor praise God that's who God honors so praise the Lord thank God for His mercy and His grace Hebrews chapter 4 verse 12 I like to go back to this little soul series I've only got two parts and this is part three so look like a look at a soul thirst I also caught it understanding the soul just like to look at that thought again this morning you know I got you know Wednesday service on Christmas I got a little feedback online I don't know if you saw it brother Austin said amen to my sermon on on Wednesday night and he said I'll see you on Sunday now he's not here yet but if he walks in you'll know why I'm smiling but even if he doesn't come let's keep praying some through the fire some through the water some through the flood but all through the blood praise God no no Matt no matter what they have to go through you know to get to heaven we just want to get people to heaven praise God Jesus said few will find that narrow road I just want to be one of those that can find it praise God and point everybody I know this is the way the word is the way you be the word is the way today praise God Hebrews 4:12 let's just read that together just verse 12 on three one two three for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even to the dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints and marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart it's that one more word prayer here as we bow our head god bless birthing let's bow our heads here for word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord we love you we've sang your songs Lord how they refresh our souls or I just feel such a emotional feeling right now of my love for you and I believe it's my soul Lord that wants to magnify the Lord so Lord we thank you that we can sing these songs and worship You Lord Jesus and I I'm reflecting I'm a little emotional on reflecting on this year you brought us through another year Lord and I'm grateful for that I'm still here I'm still healthy our families are still intact Lord God we have so much to be thankful for and praise God we give you glory for Jesus so father bless this reading of thy word that the word received let it be received by your people Lord strengthen us to be ever more faithful ever more solid on the things of God the Bible cause it established in the faith Lord God that nothing can shake us Lord but Lord we will stand forever on the eternal truth of your word the revelation of the word and so father were grateful for it anoint us now for thy service anoint me I'm just you're yielded humble servant I'm nothing Lord God none of us are but we just asked for your leadership in this service in Jesus Christ's name the church said amen god bless you being seated praise God so we're happy to be here again we're thankful for another year I don't know if you saw the text but Tuesday we'll have another service for New Year's Eve and we'll do it Lord willing at 6 p.m. I hope that's ok and we'll follow it with Communion and feet washing now if you got to work I'm sorry I wish you didn't have to but if you can even just make it for the communion that's it I would encourage you to do that know a couple or a couple years ago I had a little discussion with someone who used to go to our church and you know they purposely skipped out on feet Washington Communion and I said that's I encouraged them I said you don't want to do that I said that that's coming up to your judgment you know that the Bible said examine yourselves and they were saying all these reasons why they shouldn't and said and I said even if there's something unsettling your life you should go try to settle it before communion and come to communion okay because it's your chance to show everyone that you're on the Lord's side and you're showing the Lord until he comes that you want to be associated with his death that he you believe that he died for you and so this person never really you know obeyed what I had asked them to do and so I don't know where they stand today I all I can say is I tried to help them but we don't want to take that lightly praise God we want to take it seriously and of course you know if you can't make it and I don't know about Wendy's schedule and I don't know about care and those who live far away but if you can make it praise God if not let me know I can reschedule or I can schedule another Lord's Supper soon by God's grace I happy happy to do that maybe in a couple weeks just let me know by the grace of the Lord so I like to recognize our other officers too brother bang can you come up here you can bring James with you can you come up here real quick I just want to give brother Van little token of our appreciation just for all that he's done this year you know I don't know if everybody sees it but he you know he got these new cameras fixed up and he does all the wiring and everything he comes early to Odin the church turn on the heat in the wintertime sometimes he's already shoveled the snow out of the way and he's been here for all the years of our church so we're so thankful and we just want to thank him so let's give him a round plaus thank you sir bill token of our appreciation [Applause] so we appreciate brother van thank you sir god bless you richly we appreciate your testimony glad the Lord touched your back as well we're so thankful for all that God does I would like I like amen and Malachi to come up here as well just because many times you know we practice this this year many times on Saturday nights you know they devoted a lot of time and we've been having more services like Sunday night services and they'll do music almost all day Sunday and in years past I'd recognize Loras you know I'd give him little gift cards and things like that and I always want to thank our musicians and so this just a little token of our appreciation it just says thank you for your faithful service during 2019 so let's give them round paws praise God love you buddy so I'd like to usually do it at the beginning of the month of December but I kept holding off you know we had Simon come and then bend the rod and I was like I just want to wait till just the home folks are here you know I I love our visitors you know Simon's my family but I just want to thank our musicians and bang our officer with just us here by God's grace just to say thank you for everything that they do praise God just make sure I got everything here and as we head into 2019 can you switch over here real quick I was going through this with my family we we finished the book that we are reading at home and and now we're into the Seventh Seal book so I just want to this is mainly for me I just want to remind you just about our reverence in the house of the Lord you know so when we went to brown Tabernacle you'll see the there's two signs and they were there since the 60s you know they haven't changed anything from when brother Branham was there other than the outside parking lot and everything like that they've changed a little bit so just remember I was telling this to my children today or this week of while we were going through over or the the Seventh Seal book says entering the house Lord reverently in prayer meditation mother BAM said just try to come in as quietly as we can and pray and meditate he said so people can hear from God praise the Lord and then on the other right next to it is another one please do not talk be reverent pray study or meditate praise the Lord so just to remind it's mainly for me like you know sometimes I'll start brother amen and Jose usually it's me talking to you guys so I'm doing this for my sake so I got a little loose on this so I want to make sure that after service you know I shake your hand we greet each other but if we want to talk at length I've got to take it out there you know unless it's counseling or something like that if I'm going to counsel with somebody you have a question I want to try to help you we can talk in the sanctuary that's fine but sometimes in the past I've been guilty of just how are you doing brother what's this what's going on with this or that it's not really counseling I'm just talking with people so forgive me you know I want to do better job on that by God's grace and then then it's kind of at the brown Tabernacle you can see it how it says be still and know that I'm God they got that up there at the front and and you know brother Bram said he always wanted that crucifix right there of Jesus he said because on the right hand of Jesus was the saved thief and so that's what that one represents about RAM said I'm happy to be on the right side of the Lord in other words I'm happy that he saved me so brother Ram looked at himself and said I'm the guilty one I'm the one who needs saved and I want to be on the right hand of the Lord praise God so that's just a beautiful picture there and right when you walk in the tabernacle there's this huge this is a massive picture and it looks small here but it's massive it's probably bigger than this TV actually if maybe it is the size of TVs return to this way somebody gave that picture to brother Branham so that was that's been the tabernacle for years and years and years but just thought I'd show some of those things that's me I got Jose I think you took that picture buddy thank you sir I just want to show those real quick we're just thankful for all God has done so to look at this thought here and I'm gonna send timers I don't preach all day I want to be respectful of the time and everything make sure I got everything okay so I want to look here at the the soul and preach on this amazing part of each one of us it's our part that's most like God praise the Lord we know we're in the image of God God made Adam in His image and when God made Adam he made him spirit being right he started off and the Bible's brother Branham says Adam and Eve were one spirit so can you imagine that like one spirit and they both had human spirits and souls so it was like two souls as one one beam no that's I can't explain that he said but that was one spirit and that spirit was leading the animals right but then God put he you know God put flesh on that spirit or soul and then in Adam was both male and female male and female then God saw that Adam was alone he felt alone in his own self and so God put him to sleep and did the first surgery pulled out the eat the rib and made Eve from the rib and then Eve had her own soul Eve had her own body and so Adam had his own soul and his own body praise God and God said he said you're in my image and my likeness praise God and just as God his father son Holy Ghost so are we so body spirit praise God when you look at God you don't see three persons we only see one person praise God and so it is how you and I are in the image of God we are three parts but where one person praise God and so this is what's been revelation to me because I've never understood this before and the Bible says search if we're not growing in knowledge of the word something's wrong if we're not growing in Revelation it's because we're not asking for it because our number one prayer is God reveal yourself to me right give me more revelation and so that should be our main prayer Lord I want to grow in grace and knowledge of you praise God yeah we all want to grow in power I don't think anybody here desires more than me to see miracles every morning with amen I'm on my knees in my closet saying God let's signs wonders and miracles be done by the name of your Holy Child Jesus I don't I don't know if anybody wants them more than I do if you do well then praise God but nobody I just pray for him all the time amen but I realized that I can't make God do anything but I can but what we can do is ask God for more revelation of himself praise God and we can grow and we can learn to love God and and what God does as time passes will thank the Lord for it we'll keep believing but we have to remember that Jesus told Thomas he said blessed is he who hasn't seen yet beliefs so whether I even though I haven't seen somebody physically raised from the dead I believe God does it amen hallelujah even though I've never seen anybody bit by a snake a poisonous venomous snake and then recover I still believe it praise God hallelujah but they got we have laid our hands on the sick and they have recovered amen I've recovered amen from my sicknesses God has healed me supernaturally praise God where should not have happened God did it and so we're thankful for what God has done and I constantly wrestled with that you know wanting to see more of God but I've got to remember that if God's choosing you know taught to do all these things or more of these things and we're waiting on God's timing there is a way to grow and that is through revelation of God's Word and prevent makes it plain says those who have the Holy Ghost will be in the word all the way that's one great sign that we're born again when we hunger for more of the word we want more supernatural we want more we want more the church of course we want the church to grow but above all we want more of the word we want to understand and live and obey more of the word hallelujah because remember the Bible says there will come a time when they will not endure sound doctrine and there were so there'll be a time at the end Jesus said few there be that find it the deceivers are wax worse and worse there is coming the time and the time is near it's happening now amongst our ranks as brother Ben was saying last week that many people are leaving the message and saying brother Branham is not a prophet anymore and they're entitled to that but the Bible said the prophesied of this time there's coming a great falling away first before the Anti Christ can be revealed there's going to be a falling away from people that were the people of God and they're gonna fall away from the sound doctrine or the Word of God praise God and then of course they'll reject God's messengers and not just brother Branham but all of the fivefold ministry the true fivefold ministry because they're rejecting the word or the doctrine or the instruction that the real men of God are preaching okay so it's gonna go like that not only are they gonna reject brother Branham but they're gonna reject the doctrine that he taught and that's what's more important remember that what's most important is the doctrine which is the revelation of God's Word because John the Baptist said I must decrease but he must increase amen and church as time goes on let me just say a few words about this as time goes on people are finding more and more faults or mistakes of brother Branham but I have yet to find any mistakes with thus saith the Lord there are a few arguments that people are going to make and there's things that I will share coming up in the next few weeks Lord willing I'm gonna preach on this I'm gonna call this series prove all things because if we've got the truth we can prove everything by the word we're not scared of any question we're not scared of any person leaving us or any person calling us unbelievers or any person mocking us or making fun of us if we've got the word then the word will prove that itself is true praise God and it's this if the doctrine of it praise God okay so just so you know I'll be sharing it and maybe once the livestream goes off I'll be sharing that there's people close to us that we know that may be falling away from believing brother Graham was a prophet but that doesn't shake me because this whole time my whole if you just go on my YouTube page my whole time the whole time my whole vision was to give people the word and then yes I did make brother Ram videos but the majority is not about brother Ram brother branham because he's not the one that's supposed to increase in this day Jesus Christ the word is to increase amen he's the one that's going to increase praise God and I believe brother Ram was God's prophet and but yet I can recognize where he made mistakes and his doctrine he changes predictions he made his own personal opinions or maybe he compromised in a weak moment but I cannot find where he ever compromised or was wrong with thus saith the Lord and I know there's be there'll be people that will argue with me on that and I'm going to debate some Lord willing soon but that's kind of where we're at right now isn't it look we're at church we got we've got the the Jeffersonville side where they're worshiping brother Branham and now we got a sign of people that they like the word of it but they don't want brother Branham so here we are where are we right in the middle of the road hey hey oh yeah we don't worship gods man we are their gods man because the Bible said we give all honor to all men of God but we also don't reject him because he was human or made mistakes what we do is we go through what's what the questions are and we point everybody back to the Word of God that he taught amen because the falling away is from the doctrine they and that's what the Holy Spirit told brother Branham amen that's what he wrote in the paper and put it in the other corner so in the Browns a vertical there will come a time when they will not endure sound doctrine so the attack is going to be on the doctrine that we hold specifically brother Jose you know it holiness the doctrine of holiness because what we have said though the Word of God is God's filter and program says over and over again in the first message you cannot bring sin through God's filter so the great deception the Antichrist will he will head this up but the great deception of the false church uniting with the government is that they will make a false group and they will still be living in unrighteousness let me say it again unrighteousness not righteousness but unrighteousness in other words it's called lisent Ischia sness licentiousness which is I'm sorry lasciviousness which means a lawlessness they will turn the grace of God into lawlessness they can live and enjoy sit and still think they're a church member or going to heaven but the Word of God says when you've got the seal of God that you depart from all iniquity praise God so it's going to boil down to this church doctrine and are you surprised when Ram said what the only difference between Moses and Balaam was doctrine praise God but Ram said the Antichrist spirit moon will reject the true bride doctrine so that's what it's going to come down to I'm a sardine klaris larkin for those Abbott studying Clarence Clarence Larkin this week he books are free online umbrella ran used a lot of Clarence Larkin Satan's Superman that's from Clarence Larkin the future home that's from Clarence Larkin praise God program use a lot of his teachings but listen when it came down to the revelation of when it was and the seals it was all different brother rhythm his revelations were fresh from God and they were different than Clarence Larkins remember brother Branham was like Elisha the altar was all broken down there at the time when the fire was going to fall Amen hallelujah and there's all these stones and how to worship laying around and they're just all laying there and Elijah had to take one at a time and restock them and put them in rye the right order praise God and that's what brother Branham would do he would take some from Larkin he would take some from your eyes Smith he would take some from the Holy Ghost amen he would take some from the angel of the Lord amen and he would stack them all together and when they all finally got together at the showdown then the fire fell praise God but it says that fire falling time is the latter rain praise God it is the final showdown everybody said the rapture showdown will be between Jesus and denominations Amen so we'll have Jesus doctrine the restored doctrine also 12 stones amen I like that day men all 12 stones all placed back together because remember he was restoring the hearts he was restoring and I just shall come and restore all things jesus said in Matthew 17 11 he's coming to restore all that the Reformers had lost he was putting it back together and he put it back together so the fire could fall that's what we're seeing today praise God but many will not endure the sound doctrine oh I'm so glad I believe the doctrine of this message praise God hallelujah so Church I understand that many are going to be questioning and falling away I'm getting questions you know from friends and coach ones but I'm happy to defend what we believe because what we believe comes right from God's Word I've never been happier to know that I've tried to take by the leader or the leadership of the Holy Spirit to take everything I believe back to the word because the word is what's ultimately going to come down to praise God it's going to come down to the doctrine of the word praise God and God but have said the last vindication of the seven church age messenger will be the bride being raptured off to earth because that will prove she had received Jesus's message thank the Lord amen the last indication is that the bride who kept the doctrine of Christ Christ will rapture her off the earth amen now our text was Hebrews for twelve years like when you're gonna get to your text mother Jesse we get to right now Hebrews 4:12 now I want you to notice here that the Bible said the Word of God is quick that means alive powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing now remember the Bible said they were pierced on the day of Pentecost remember that their hearts were pricked actually said pricked so see Peters preaching the word a church we should feel that every service we should feel a prick like the Holy Spirit saying ah it's cutting me I need to do this I need to follow the Lord's leading in this is that right Church because we all have mind battles we all have you know temptations of the flesh there's always something where sins got a punch on us and we need God to help us overcome that so it's the Word of God is quick powerful sharper than a two-edged sword piercing even is dividing asunder of soul and spirit and of the joints of the marrow and is a discerner or judge of the thoughts and intents of the heart now notice it is the word that divides the soul from the spirit now Moran tells us plainly he said that the soul is the nature of the human spirit and that means your soul is your will the nature is your will or your desire your soul is the the desire of your spirit right your spirit is your consciousness I'm here right now I'm here right now right but something is guiding my thoughts it's my soul my desire guides my thoughts right but the reality is your mind is out your mind is open the battlefield the greatest battlefield and Satan has free access in your mind so he will introduce a thought in your mind and if we're not careful we'll entertain the wrong thought but we've got to take that thought and judge it by the learn by the desire of the soul praise God because that's what the word does it judges it pierces and divides soul and spirit so the word first of all church the word will reveal the location of your battle where's your battle taking place like Amen was sick last week where was his battle in his body the word tells us that right now if were you having a mind battle - yes memory told me don't you have a mind matter when you're sick I God did I do something wrong that's some of my hardest my battles is when I'm sick brother may God have I done wrong if I sinned against the Lord but see the word divides that the word shows you the location where's my battle praise God and then the word if the word first shows the location of your battle is it in the body the mind or the soul and then the word helps you judge that thought or that disease or that sickness the word will judge it praise God Amen the Lord will judge is this the right thing is this the wrong thing do I want this or should I not have this Amen the word then judges that for example if someone says well I'm having a mind battle brother Jesse how many ever been there and there's I hope you understand there's times you have mind battles and it's not a struggle in your soul like your will it's just like a it's like a thoughtless is this the right thought or not you're not concerned about going to hell or anything like that or am i outside the will of God you're just having a mind metal I wonder if this is the right thing to do whatever I should say this to the brother or sister it's just a mind battle right and you can see that that the Bible tells us in cyclins 10-5 passing down imaginations well I'm just imagining that bang was I was imagining both Jessie was this see we're just imagining things right but the Bible said cast sit down and every high thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God amen see why knowledge is so important we got to grow in knowledge because Satan's going to bring knowledge that comes against God's knowledge so we have to know God's knowledge so we can cast down the world's knowledge or Satan's knowledge and bringing in the captivity so there's rests that me that made that need done in our minds we the Holy Spirit to be the police officer in our minds to arrest the evil thoughts and send them to jail praise God amen bring it into captivity don't let it make you a captive make the thought a captive and send it to jail send it back to Satan learning from praise God Amen I'm gonna die or I'm useless or I'm nobody you've got to take that thought don't let that thought make you a slave you make that thought your slave and reject it because your weapons are not wimpy your weapons are mighty through the pulling down of strongholds amen glory the Word of God is the mightiest weapon God could ever give us we just gotta use it all the time amen hallelujah it takes in the captivity it makes that thought asleep and then it sends a slave out to its master the devil praise God amen and every thought to the obedience of Christ what does that the word the word helps you locate oh this is a mind battle I've got to cast this down this is going to cast me down into the the depths of depression and the church said or the depths of fear or the depths of lust brothers right that's often when we battle so much the depths of lust it'll cast us down it'll come and try to come into our house and and lock us up and try to make us a slave to that well I can't do anything unless I get this relief or I can't do anything unless I get this high right like the drug addicts do and all these things like that people those thoughts have to be brought into captivity to Christ I used to think that way I've got to have a tobacco before I can go to bed or I can't sleep I used to have those thoughts or I've got to watch that game or I've got to watch that dirty movie before I do this I said and it used to be so overpowering that I was a slave to that but at one point I don't know how it's like a man who went to sleep and he planted the seed and he woke up and it had already shot up somehow one of those services God calls growth in my life and in my mind I was able now to take the word and make that thought captive and I no longer thought I was a captive or an addict to those things but now I was ruling over that spirit and I can't make that spirit captive and I could own that spirit to go and it left in the name of Jesus praise God I don't know how it happened but as you feed on the Lord God causes this unknown growth amen this unseen growth phrase God so it reveals the location the word tells you where this is at and also then judges what to do about it so church you all know okay that's just some mind battle you all know what it feels like just have a mind battle now here's the deepest one the deepest one you can have is soul searching see brother aim I'm really searching my soul right now that's that's really saying something don't get me wrong you can lose your mind too and someone could lose their mind that's that's serious students program so you can have the seal the Holy Ghost and lose your mind look at some of these Saints like I don't know if I should call names man anyways there's people in the message I've served God for 50 years but they get old they get dementia and their mind leaves but their whole life or the aim and they were faithful they paid their ties they went to church they spoke in tongues they shouted they danced they love they read the Bible but they were sealed but then their mind starts to slip and then they say things you would never ever hear them say does that make their soul is their will desire different now no no no that's why God made a seal and not to the next revival or not they're just 85 years old but it's until you get a new body amen hallelujah that's what they didn't have in the Old Testament didn't have the seal in the soul that's what made the New Testament a testament of better promises amen a Testament where you can have a new heart a new spirit and God's Spirit amen so Satan can attack this flesh here but there's times where battles can reach here and you'll say I'm searching my soul brother Jesse sometimes I do that too don't you sometimes you have a soul shaking moment where are the temptations of this world or allowed to shake you to the your very core brother Ram did remember that when he lost his wife and is a daughter Satan said you're preaching divine healing and God didn't heal your wife you're preaching divine healing God in here here heal Sharon rose but Abraham said I was about ready to quit because the devil said he doesn't love you and he said just right before I quit look at this Seoul mine he was just gonna change his desire but right brother I said right before I just was gonna say I won't then I won't serve anymore he said that anchor held honey there yeah and he said the word came yeah see the word located where the battle was it was at his very core not just a mind battle on hunt you see I went deeper than that down to his the will his desire to serve God and he said but the acres hold and then the word judged that thought and the word said where did you get your children and your wife anyway the Lord gives and the Lord takes away blessed be the name of the Lord amen so the word judge that thought and brought it in the captivity head and chaos and no because why it's lighter than the depressive thoughts Amen it's mightier than quitting thoughts it's mine you're been doubts the Word of God is more powerful it's quick its activist living and it gives you this heart of your heart which is the love and serve God amen glory hallelujah he was searching his soul see and I've preached this before but if you go to first Peter 2:11 don't just leave that up there Keisha the Bible said dearly know yeah first 2:11 if you've got your Bibles dearly beloved I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims abstain from fleshly lusts which war against the soul this is why people can have their names blotted off the book of life because just like a ground a soul can receive the faith seen but if that faith seed doesn't produce fruit it's not born again praise God that's right by the Amen when people that they receive the message but they're not born again they'll get a temptation especially with relationships well my wife left me and they have a choice or my husband left me and of a choice I've got a fleshly lust I want to be married to somebody I don't want to be alone it's such a fleshly battle or maybe some people it's with alcohol my drunkenness and it just it goes deeper than a mind battle this is this is just more than just well sometimes I battle fighting this in my mind it goes all the way down to their soul and for Judas Church can you imagine us he was saved the Bible said the disciples believed in Christ Judas baptized people because he was baptized in John chapter 4 the Bible says that the Bible said Jesus was standing with the twelve and the 70 and he said they'd come back rejoicing and he said don't rejoice that you got power to cast out devils he said rejoice that your names are written in heaven amen praise God and Judas his name was there but M says in the church age book but when he sold out Jesus Christ at that supper the Bible said when he lived it when he left that word it's as if the seed of God died the Word of God died in his heart when he left that word his name was blotted off the book of life it had to been just like Dan and Ephraim Dan and Ephraim were blotted out and listen not in heaven but under heaven I can't explain that but that's what the Bible says why were they brought it up for idolatry they set up idols why was Judas running out idolatry he idolized money and he wanted money in his soul he had a greater desire to go out and get thirty pieces of silver than to go to the cross with Christ greater desire and it was a soul this fleshly lusts of the money got past his mind past all the miracles past all that he's seen all the people he baptized he let it go deeper and deeper until it ward in his soul and that seed that just started to spring up through justification sanctification the Bible said it died because it fell on stony ground and it never produced anything nothing and that's why Peter says you can have fleshly lusts that war against the soul and we see it today people leave the message so they can get married twice or two or three times but the Bible said adulterers and fornicators will not inherit the kingdom of God so they choose fleshly lusts they lost the battle in their soul but I'm so happy to know that you and I are here as testimony as witnesses that the armor of God that he's given us is powerful enough to withstand every battle the soul and that we can be more than conquerors as soldiers fully armored soldiers with the word of the Lord hallelujah thank the Lord Jesus there was a battle one time in acts 13 verse 6 there's a battle for a soul so God led Paul to speak blindness upon a sorcerer how many more that battle thirteen six and when they had gone through the isle of hey folks they found a certain sorcerer a false prophet a Jew whose name was bar Jesus look how close that is the Jesus he's so closely to see the very elective or possible which was with the deputy of the country Sergius Paulus look how close he is to Paul Paulus a prudent man who called for a Barnabas and saw and desired to hear desire amen there's the desire there's the soul Ivan desire to go to church I'm a desire to hear what that man is preaching that's assault a men the soul is thirsty every song thirsty that has a word of God amen and that person either chooses there's a there's a holy thirst here somewhere and the freedom or NCS either hush that say shut up be quiet don't go listen to preaching don't believe the preacher or it says go ahead receive it receive life receive the refreshing waters of life amen receive the bread of God for your soul praise the Lord receive the desires of your heart he said I desire to hear God's Word but II limas the sorcerer for so is his name by interpretation without withstood them seeking to turn away the deputy from the faith the soul see faith in faith or unbelief the soul starts by receiving justification justification is that seed where they get saved now they've got the seed they've just got to keep watering that seat until produces fruit praise God hey man that word is the see the face seed then saw who's also called Paul filled with the Holy Ghost set his eyes on him and said o full of all subtlety and on mischief now child of the devil now enemy of all righteousness wilt thou not cease to pervert the right ways of the Lord and now behold the hand the Lord is upon thee and thou shalt be blind not seeing the Sun for a season and immediately there fell on him a mist and a darkness and he went about seeking some to lead him by the hand then the deputy when he saw what was done believed being astonished at the doctrine of the Lord a hand remember Paul could not have done this unless it was the deputy's desire to serve God in other words you cannot you and I cannot force people to come to church but see pause will got lined up with God's will but also got lined up with the deputies will and so when he spoke blindness upon illness it happened because they all desired it it was everybody's desire is God's desire Paul's desire and the deputy's desire and it all lined up and God did a supernatural work in order to give that soul the desire of its heart see the word discern that the word discerned to Paul well this man desires the word I've got to judge that spirit that's on limas I'm gonna judge it in rebuke it and curse it amen praise the Lord a church you got to have we you and I you and I gotta have this confidence when God wants us to do something like that we'll be so anointed we won't even doubt it those times in my prayer closet when I spoke into the spirits I've spoken to the different ones who couldn't have babies I wasn't even thinking about it I just was so anointed I spoke it and it happened they men and that's how we know but see we got to be so annoyed in the flesh and the spirit and the soul that we're so lined up everything's lined up that God's will can flow right through all of them praise God no the little pipes are clogged up praise God nothing's closed up you're not feeding their lust of the flesh you're not thinking about evil thoughts you're thinking about God's thoughts and your soul is to do the will of God when all that gets lined up God can move amen that's when something gets done real BAM says holiday yeah in that beautiful and Lord willing I'll be preaching oneness in the future but the word divides asunder soul spirit and body so there's times where services will minister to divine healing that will minister to the needs of your body now many times what we need for that is also the Ministry of the mind so we can receive the Word of God in our minds and then there's other services where it's all about mind battles just preaching cast down that thought get that out think this this is the truth this is the right thing this is pure and holy line up your thoughts straight atmosphere praise God amen and there's other services that will go down to the very soul the perfect will of God what is your desire those are soul-searching moments Church we listen we are at a soul-searching moment around this message people are searching their souls and they're either going to go worship brother Branham or they're going to go out of the world or they're gonna stay right in the middle of the road and only worship Jesus Christ that's where I'm gonna go praise the Lord Amen hallelujah that's right now the Bible calls this if you wanna know this this was made real to me this week as I was setting away on the Lord it's like it fell from heaven the Bible calls soul searching this communing with your own heart hallelujah David ASAP and Solomon all said this when I was communing with my brother no when I was commuting with dad no when I was commuting with my sister no when I was communing with myself no sir sometimes you need communion with yourself we so minister to other people we try to help other people we try to give it and that's what you ought to do we email this text the person back try to help everybody well there's times we got to talk to ourselves because our human spirit our consciousness sometimes need to see what's now what the souls gonna say about it the will down in the soul yeah remember Solomon my register you in Proverbs remember whatsoever a man thinketh in his heart so is he and in the context of that that's speaking of an evil man so an evil man the Bible it lets us pull it up there and go to proverbs the evil man and overs an evil person knows their evil when they're trying to deceive you they know it yeah proper 23:8 or six and seven there is going to be no soul that goes on the day of judgment says well I didn't know I was doing evil I don't know I was trying to lie I don't know I was trying to deceive God will say no you did know because here's your desire here's your soul here's your will you knew it because the Bible said as he thinketh in his heart so is he the atmosphere of his thoughts prove what's in his soul God help us to have the atmosphere of the Word of God in our thoughts we meditate on God's Word proving the word is in our soul proverbs 23:7 I'm sorry 23 6 eat thou not the bread of him that hath an evil eye Oh be careful we fellowship with neither desire thou his dainty so many times Satan will trick us through people that have more money than us and you watch these message churches that follow many of them because they got all this money and church they've learned catch this they learn to trust in their ability to make money more than they learn to trust in the word and the same things happening like the rich man with the Barnes he got so exalted off that I better build bigger barns and he said soul he commune with his own heart we'll read that next he said soul take your ease not in other words no longer desire or try to trust in God stop thirsting and hungry after God stop trying to seek after that take your ease because the Barnes is what you can trust in we're not trusting in any Barnes down here we are trusting in a snow house sister Karen but it's not an earthly snow house it's a heavenly storehouse Amen hallelujah God's temple praise God God's bank account amen that's the heavenly one the same one Malachi was talking about bring your tithes and offerings to the storehouse to God he's not necessarily talking about the natural storehouse he's talking about the heavenly storehouse the account where God keeps track of your account in heaven praise God hey man learn to trust money what is the greatest temptation what is the root of all evil the love so you watch these next few weeks and months years you watch who leaves first people to go this money I don't see anybody who's leaving that's poor and destitute it's all these rich smart intellectual people and then for example they'll make statements like this brother Branham plagiarized the seven seals and I've told you program did use some of Larkins ideas but not the revelations of how do you know cuz I've had personal emails with people that tried to tell me that and I went and studied it myself and brother Ram didn't plagiarize the revelation behind it he got that from heaven hey man let me tell you what Larkin said the fall for horse riders were all in the Tribulation Period and brother Ram teaches very differently than that hey how do they yeah totally different but yet he says the white horse rider is Satan's Superman the Antichrist but he places all of them 2,000 years before brother Branham placed him hallelujah praise God see though what is it there it is right there they're just Satan's got 99% truth but he's got 1% oh yeah we will prove all things that Bride of Christ fellowship you better believe it yes we will try every spirit that tries to come against the word cuz this another man's not here to defend himself it's easy to say but I was wrong when he's not here to stand up for himself I'll tell you this Jesus is here and he'll stand up for himself to Jesus here in you and I praise God we've got to stand with Christ amen we're taking sides with Jesus amen the word so a lot of these things believe the sign says a lot of them are true we're not all of them because they always got a lot of truth but not all the truth so who's got who's trying to trick you the one who's got dainty meats oh he'll have this nice fellowship with you and you see a lot of them want to take out for coffee now and they'll buy your coffee dainty coffee well I'll get you coffee don't ever see I'll buy your coffee don't have somebody buy your coffee if they're trying to talk you out of the word come see me I'll give you a gift card to Starbucks here whatever you want look how they do it dainty they try to impress you but he's got the evil eye look what he says for as he thinketh in his heart so is he so the whole time he's thinking if I just buy this guy out he's gonna come follow me look in the next verse I'm sorry yeah I'm sorry there it is verses eat and drink saith he T but his heart is not with thee understand if someone wants a question about the message you can do it on your own but I recommend having me there or somebody you know that loves the word you can stand dude okay bro you can say it but if you got any question whether you should do it or not wait let me be there or let somebody else be there someone that you know will stand with the word you can stand on the own don't get me wrong but if you if you're not sure we it's better that we stand together than stand alone this is what they do they wine you and dine you they'll say brother I love you sister I love you so much let's talk you better be careful who you talk to because they're trying to get you to go off into lawlessness there watch that how does that help every see that we always use that scripture for the believer but it's true it's true true whatever you think that's what you are but in reality it was used by God to validate a deceiver always knows what they're doing they know God puts a witness in their heart they know in their heart what they are and they're just denying it that's why I left message for some brother this week he was trying to talk me out of Bella Branham being a prophet and he plagiarized Larkin and I said listen sir I said the reason I know bro Ram is a prophet because of the doctrine that he preached the word yes their signs wonders miracles all those things I said the reason I know he's a prophet with biskits because he taught holiness unto God the Word of God are there questions about this of that of course we have answers for that yes of course but I had to say that I had to say the reason I'm with the message is because it's the word and before I came to this message I couldn't overcome anything I mean I guess I should say that I overcame music I throw my music away after I got saved but I couldn't overcome a lot of sexual temptation I couldn't overcome movies are gonna overcome sports or tobacco there's so many other things that can overcome but God is my witness as soon as I dedicated myself to this word and this message and receive the revelation God took all of it away because it's the word that judges it's the word that cast doubt it's a mighty weapon and I know this message is right because the waves are made alive to me just like his men made alive to you who praise God I know what it's like to sit in the church and hear people speak in tongues and prophesied and come to pass and yet later the wear short shorts or show show all their cleavage off and paint their faces I know what that's like I know it's like to sit the Church of a college service where you got women and miniskirts and you can hardly look at the screen because they're sitting over there and talking about how much they love Jesus and they play movies and they show cuss words of movies and then preach about it minutes later I know what that's like and they have healings too they have testimonies too but I know it's like when there's holiness and unholiness others we should sense we can sense the Spirit of Truth and the spirit of error because the word is a judge the word is the Sailor are the thoughts and intents of the heart praise God and that man told me I told you when I preach on the Pilgrims that man told me Jesse be come for the message he said you'll become a separate Avista he said you're getting too far away from the world so you can't relate to them anymore I'm like I'm glad I can't relate to them anymore in other words I don't want to mix with the world I would be totally separate from the world and I want to separate myself to fellowship with Christ I've seen that been around both people that have got miracles people that don't have miracles they always intermix they mixed sin and lust into the worship of God when it has no part in it he became our sin that we might become his righteousness praise God how'd I get here okay communing with your own heart your faith will your soul will go under seasons of tests Peter said there's a season where you undergo the fiery test of your faith in 1st Peter 1 6 to 8 despite unspeakable loss suffering disappointment the prophet job he eventually recognized his faith was on trial amen his flesh had sores and all these things his flesh and all of this but he eventually recognized I'm going through a trial because he said this in job 23:10 but he knoweth the way that I take God knows the way I'm going God knows my will God knows the cloth I'm choosing amen he says when he hath tried me I shall come forth as gold amen these tests are trials what really do you desire what's your real true choice what's your really your will of your free more what do you want to do what do you really want in life before you die I want to serve Jesus Christ and I want to live eternally with him praise God that is my one and anything mother vague that stops me from that I will praise God because it's not on him anymore the crucified with Amen Lord Jesus already took a crucifixion it's not him to crucify these things anymore it's a nurse we must die daily and we must crucify the lust of the flesh now it's our turn to crucify our own desires don't crucify the word that's what those sinners are doing crucify the desires I was playing the preaches of Austin came but look take your Bible here Colossians I'm sorry Romans 8:13 it's set in both Romans 8:13 literally Church we have services where I should say literally but it's like a spiritual truth you are trying to crucify the human will you are trying to crucify the sin nature that's in you why you gotta be so hard why is gonna be sir because I'm trying to get you to you and I to kill our desires because if not it's gonna kill us right Romans 8:13 for if you live after the flesh ye shall die but if you through the spirit see we need the spirit the Lord amen it's a discerner it divides asunder so instead it discerns if you through the spirit do mortify the deeds of the body you shall live jesus said you cannot be my disciple unless you take up your cross your crucifixion and die daily let me just name a name god have mercy I don't you're on Geoff Jenkins I hate to do that but I just got to he's left a message all these years no church he's remarried his daughter a second time that's adultery and when she got married he posted the pictures on Facebook she has short shorts on she's sure she has a shirt that's showing off her entire belly and showing off her entire almost their entire top and cut hair short now is that the is that okay with the word or does that go against the word you tell me what is it gonna come down to the doctrine I think that was last year and that was here I wrote that book if you just stay in the message you could have read the book not that I'm anything but just to let you know it doesn't come from a man it did not come from William Graham it didn't originate with William Graham it came from God amen okay from the Lord holding this modesty righteousness the Word of God about hey legs and all these things it comes from God's Word but if you got the Holy Spirit you'll crucify mortify the deeds and the evil sins of the flesh and then brother sister then you really live I'm really living today please God when I crucify the desires of my flesh I'm really alive you are really alive when you obey the Holy Spirit and you don't do what your flesh wants to do then you really feel live and I told you he's the preacher I told you about that likes Taylor Swift and what an evil woman she is now she started off so innocent I thought she was so innocent you know cuz I'm at school and all the girls at school say oh maybe she is pretty nice boy was i I was totally thinking of my flesh that was years and years ago what a devil she's become and won that award ceremonies recently I sir she seen her on the article I didn't watch the video it came out and she was dressed up like the devil literally the devil and they're all singing highway to hell doing the devil symbols and all these things that's what they're doing and that preacher posted he likes that song now if you like it if you desire that kind of music well then tell me what what's the state of your soul then what what condition isn't it desire Taylor Swift beside this desire the how state buckeyes or the Clemson LSU they desire they so desire they can't miss it well what condition is your soul on that and it ought to be a you know them is them said I said it used to be wrong to do those things just be wrong in the message to watch the games just be wrong to do a lot of these things well what happened preacher start preachers start doing it preachers wives some leaders and people a big rich people hello Church how come it was wrong before and now it's okay because right there they've chosen yeah they're choosing instead of crucifying this if you want to live by the Holy Spirit this has to die it's got to be mortified that means to kill we've got to kill our will that God's will might be done and he said you are not a disciple unless you take up your cross daily and follow me alright Ben Briggs - five minutes everybody okay let me go through Psalms four verse for some of your greatest battles will be not fellowshipping with somebody else that's a battle but communing with your own art wrestling with the will psalms 4 verse 4 stand at all and sin not commune with your own heart upon your bed and be still see why your home life is so important to pursue that david is placing the most important conversations you could ever have where are they at in your home because you've got a your your your spewing spirit has to choose if you're gonna receive faith in your soul and do God's desire or reject it and do your own human desire david places it you're on your bed kind of say this you're in the prayer closet can say like this you're at your kitchen table you're on your couch you're in your lazyboy wherever you are you are in your home all by yourself it's nice nighttime it's quiet it's still it's just you community with you how did ya darling it's just you and you and the Holy Spirit has divided this oh this is a soul-searching moment right here remember I said on Wednesday at the Christmas service you and I have to make the most important decisions of our lives those are soul-searching moments and you've got to make them and make sure you're obeying the Holy Spirit in those soul-searching moments like who you marry like your relationships where you live where you go to church who's your pastor those are soul altering decisions they will either direct you because your soul direction but as the Bible says your so you convert a soul from the air of his way so the way you walk depends on the desire of your heart your desire determines the way you got to convert a sinner from the error of his way so this church if it's the right church for you it would point your way to Jesus Christ the word in a relationship you will make their decision until you believe it's God's will for you to do that if it's moving or taking a job like we've seen I've made mistakes with that telling you person to take a job and I should not have done that and I've told you that I'm sorry I got to forgive me but it's got to be based upon if they'll be fully determined upon the word of God's every other sentence your biggest decisions in life these times these soul-searching moments worth just you and you you got to make sure you're hearing the voice of God at that time how do you know it's a still small voice and it'll only be a word voice it will not be another voice mom and dad Papa they might agree with the word but it's first got to be right here in the word right here in the word soul-searching is during these distraction-free quiet times Psalm 77 six I call to remembrance my song in the night times like we're just singing I love you Jesus Oh hallelujah praise be to God he said I commune with my own heart and my spirit made diligent search like my ram said every heart has got doors a door of relationships right a door of this a door of that there's all these doors and your heart has to make diligent searches at these soul-searching moments that's if you know is when you open up and this happens every person when you start doing this whole search it's the Holy Spirit guiding you to do that because the Bible says very plainly 1st chronicles 28:9 the Lord searches all hearts and understands all the imaginations of the thoughts if thou seek him he will be found of thee but if thou forsake him he will cast the off forever so when people start meditating brother amen on their souls and their desires and the will of God it's as if God comes right down next to them and they either accept God or they cast God's off God's leading off and they take their own human will and desires rather than God's desires but they can never say God wasn't with me when I made that decision because God said I am the lord who searches the rains and the depths of the heart praise God amen though never say the Holy Spirit told me it was okay they'll never say that because Jesus says it in revelation 22 verse 23 I am he who is the one who is the Lord that searches the heart Jesus who's the land that's with you as you search your heart Jesus amen Jesus I am he that searches the reigns of the heart Jeremiah 18:10 I the LORD search the heart I try the reins and give to every man according to his ways and according to the fruit of his doings once Jude once Judas made that decision I am gonna sell out the message I am gonna spell out Jesus the messenger God had to give him the fruits of it which turned out to be what humiliation he gave himself over to the devils and the devils what they do they commit suicide and the Bible said he went to his own place the Lord gave you the fruit if you want it go ahead if you want to be led by these demons go ahead but they're gonna take you places you don't want to go but they can't say well the Lord wasn't with me the Lord did the war Lord wasn't trying to talk me out yes he was because he said I searched every heart I searched the reigns and the desires of every heart but Jeremiah 29:13 promises and ye shall seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart hey Lord take all I would I want you to have all my desire take all of my will I'm searching for your will I want everything you have for me in my soul he said you'll find me if you search for me with everything you got if you crucify every desire desire to be rich desire to have these lust desire to have that desire that popularity if you crucify all these then go searching for Christ you shall find him you'll find the word praise the Lord that man in Luke 19 said and I'll say to my soul soul that's found goods I'm sorry that was much Goods laid up for many years take that ease eat drink and be merry he decided to write their soul stop desiring the things of God now we are going to trust in our barns don't trust anymore don't try to trust in God look what you've accomplished take your East soul we're just gonna we're gonna cruise now and our spiritual walk Oh help us Jesus right that's what he's saying let's cruise I just put it on cruise control no longer trust a little like I got this all figured out and Jesus said thou fool your soul is gonna be demanded of you tonight so that means Jesus listening the whole time don't trust in your Barnes don't trust that don't but as he searched his heart he's far as I I desire to have the Barnes is my anchor I'm trusting in my money trusting in my job instead of trusting in God Almighty Jesus said that's foolish don't trust in that how many want to trust in the Lord today we're all this moment Church when we
