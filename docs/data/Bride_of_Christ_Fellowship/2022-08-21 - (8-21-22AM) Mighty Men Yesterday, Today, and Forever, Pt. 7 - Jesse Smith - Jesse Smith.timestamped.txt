[3:13] so we'd like to start here uh with
[3:16] where we left off uh on wednesday night
[3:19] by god's grace
[3:22] i have some uh scriptures here to show
[3:24] it's good to see about daniel as well
[3:25] bye guys let's give her a new
[3:31] keep round back to the house of god amen
[3:33] amen
[3:37] so looking at part seven here uh by
[3:39] god's grace i just changed the text you
[3:41] know i think i'm gonna be focusing uh
[3:42] we're going more on that isaiah 59
[3:44] scripture but we were we were pulling
[3:47] from second timothy 3 where paul said
[3:50] all scripture is profitable for you for
[3:53] doctrine for correction
[3:55] uh the bible said the scripture will
[3:56] make you perfect unto every good work
[3:59] so we know there's power in the word of
[4:01] god if we're going to be mighty today
[4:03] paul said the scripture works within me
[4:05] mightily to warn to teach others uh then
[4:08] we know we can draw strength from
[4:09] everything in this entire bible praise
[4:11] god i was talking with somebody this
[4:13] week and they said brother jesse is the
[4:14] whole word of god thus saith the lord
[4:16] like when abraham lied was that thus
[4:17] saith the lord i said i said well the
[4:20] record of it was thus saith the lord but
[4:23] god didn't tell abraham to lie
[4:25] never understand
[4:27] so all these stories are thus saith the
[4:29] lord they're accurate stories there's
[4:31] records of these are true records of
[4:33] what god has done praise god
[4:35] but we wouldn't say when it recorded
[4:37] someone sinning the sin itself wasn't
[4:39] thus saith the lord
[4:40] but the fact that it happened was and
[4:42] and i love it and each time these cases
[4:44] with believers whenever a believer falls
[4:46] short it's thus saith the lord god's
[4:48] going to redeem them praise god amen
[4:50] every single case hallelujah when you're
[4:52] a real believer god won't let you fall
[4:54] too far but his merciful hand will reach
[4:56] out and he'll grab you and he'll pull
[4:58] you back into the fold praise god
[5:00] because god is faithful hallelujah so i
[5:02] hope your faith has been encouraged that
[5:04] he can work mightily in your life
[5:05] through this little homo series here and
[5:08] uh i know i know it's a reality whether
[5:10] we see it or not like a tree that's
[5:12] planted by rivers of water as we said
[5:14] last week as long as we stay planted by
[5:16] the waters of light the working of the
[5:18] holy spirit our lives will grow and
[5:20] we'll bring forth the fruits and due
[5:22] season praise god we'll stay planted
[5:24] near christ oh god god's given us a
[5:26] fresh water source amen hallelujah we
[5:29] are planted by a fresh water source
[5:31] hallelujah and we're drawing on the
[5:33] waters of life and it's helping us to
[5:35] grow up into him look church here we
[5:37] stand another week later praise god
[5:39] we're standing on the promise of god
[5:40] amen
[5:41] we're planted by the living waters amen
[5:43] and our fruit doesn't wither praise god
[5:45] we still got love we still got patience
[5:47] we still got long suffering amen we
[5:49] still got faith
[5:50] hallelujah and the word of god why
[5:52] because we're planted by a living water
[5:54] amen amen
[5:55] so whether we see it mightily or not god
[5:57] is working in our lives mightily
[5:59] because we're still standing for jesus
[6:01] christ we have not
[6:03] denied the faith praise god we've denied
[6:05] satan hallelujah
[6:06] and we've overcome satan all week amen
[6:09] amen here we stand today letting the
[6:11] holy spirit work mightily in our lives
[6:13] praise god all right now we ended
[6:15] wednesday on how you overcome laziness
[6:17] and we looked at how the way to overcome
[6:19] is to get sincerity back where we have
[6:21] our fear and trembling and we're in a
[6:24] spot of worshiping jesus kiss the son we
[6:27] worship him see we love him
[6:29] uh it was the pharisees that wouldn't
[6:31] worship jesus
[6:32] right and we got to be careful when that
[6:34] pharisee spirit comes around here when
[6:36] that intellectual spirit comes and satan
[6:38] comes to try to tempt us we got to cast
[6:40] that aside and we have to worship jesus
[6:43] like he's our husband praise god
[6:45] we've got to have the liberty of the
[6:47] holy spirit for where the spirit of the
[6:48] lord is there's liberty to worship
[6:50] praise god we can worship and we don't
[6:52] have to be ashamed we don't care what
[6:54] anybody thinks all three cares what
[6:56] jesus thinks praise god amen and we have
[6:59] that freedom to worship praise god uh
[7:02] but we also have this this real godly
[7:04] fear as we said we know god can take our
[7:06] lives at any time we know god could take
[7:09] anything from us our health our jobs our
[7:11] possessions and so we have this
[7:13] reverential fear and yet we rejoice the
[7:16] bible says we rejoice with trembling
[7:19] amen so while we're rejoicing we're also
[7:21] trembling
[7:22] god everything is in god's hands he is
[7:24] in control of everything nothing
[7:26] surprises him he's watching over
[7:28] everything he's looking at every detail
[7:30] he's in every detail
[7:33] this is the love of god that where we
[7:35] cannot get lazy on god i heard a preach
[7:38] i was listening to a good sermon
[7:38] yesterday from a preacher message
[7:40] preacher down in
[7:42] louisiana and it's uh in christ you're
[7:46] you're in when you're a real christian
[7:48] you know you're secure in christ you're
[7:51] secure in your relationship with god but
[7:53] you're always seeking as well i thought
[7:55] that was a good i just want to share
[7:56] that statement you're secure but you're
[7:58] always seeking more of god amen amen
[8:01] hallelujah amen brother graham said when
[8:03] you get the holy ghost he said the token
[8:05] it makes you so relaxed
[8:07] right
[8:08] so that's in your soul and your soul you
[8:10] you have to relax you have relaxation in
[8:12] other words you have security praise god
[8:14] but in your mind you're constantly
[8:16] battling every single day it is the
[8:18] greatest battle ever fall
[8:21] right so you're secure
[8:23] in your soul
[8:24] right but but then he says he says i
[8:26] can't relax he said he said since i've
[8:28] got the token he said i can't relax in
[8:31] his mind in his human mind
[8:33] because he doesn't want to fall short of
[8:35] god's glory he says that the message of
[8:36] desperation
[8:38] he said in token he said i'm so relaxed
[8:40] but then in the evening service
[8:41] desperation he said i can't relax i've
[8:44] been in desperation since god has
[8:46] revealed himself to me because i've got
[8:48] to take care of two other realms praise
[8:50] god right i've got to take care of my
[8:52] mind and my flesh and pulse and i beat
[8:54] under i beat my flesh under subjection
[8:56] so that i will not be a castaway as we
[8:58] said last sunday
[9:00] hallelujah amen
[9:02] i've seen another one last night i can't
[9:04] remember what it was now i just thought
[9:05] it would come to me but that's not
[9:06] coming to me i see another metaphor so
[9:08] now there's at least 14 metaphors
[9:09] brothers we were talking about those
[9:10] last week
[9:12] now we also looked at paul's in the new
[9:15] testament we are to work out our
[9:17] salvation with fear and trembling amen
[9:20] there's uh there should be times in our
[9:22] lives when we come to church and we're
[9:23] trembling under the presence of god
[9:26] we really need god to move or we're
[9:27] something is between life and death
[9:29] praise god
[9:31] because it's god paul says it's god
[9:33] working in you both to will and do his
[9:36] good pleasure in other words there's
[9:38] always going to be two choices the
[9:40] perfect will or the permissive will and
[9:42] paul says here it gives us
[9:44] the illustration the idea that when we
[9:47] need to choose the perfect will of god
[9:49] we may be in a moment of troubling
[9:51] we we may not be sure which way does god
[9:53] want us to go and so it makes us trouble
[9:56] if uh it's god bringing the pressure
[9:58] upon our lives amen
[10:00] god's allowing pressure so we'll really
[10:02] be sincere and in that moment then the
[10:04] bible said god will work with us and
[10:06] define the perfect will of god but look
[10:09] he brings us down to a pressure amen
[10:11] because when the pressure's on you it
[10:12] really shows what you're made of amen
[10:15] hallelujah
[10:17] we said do all things without murmurings
[10:19] and complaining praise god don't
[10:20] complain don't murmur praise god right
[10:22] god's god's gonna take care of it amen
[10:26] now this one i didn't get to again we
[10:28] looked at you know one of these days i'm
[10:29] gonna preach on slavery in the bible one
[10:31] of these days i'm going to get there
[10:32] i'm not this this will not be the day
[10:34] but i haven't studied i've been sending
[10:36] other things like this this subject and
[10:38] uh when the enemy comes in like a flood
[10:40] but paul told the servant these are sirs
[10:42] these are slaves in roman
[10:44] the roman government and roman captivity
[10:47] be obedient to them that are your
[10:49] masters according to the flesh with what
[10:50] fear and trembling
[10:52] so see again we get this idea
[10:55] you know even when you're serving your
[10:56] boss at your word you want to be so
[10:58] reverent to your boss
[11:00] to the owners right of the company you
[11:02] want to be so reverent
[11:04] you don't want to get lazy on them
[11:05] either right
[11:07] you don't want to get too lax or too uh
[11:09] comfortable you want to be humble you
[11:12] want to be quick to learn you want to
[11:13] recognize i may make mistakes and i want
[11:15] to be corrected and uh i'm needing
[11:17] guidance i'm needing more of god amen
[11:21] in singleness of heart as i'm the christ
[11:24] not with eye service i look that up eye
[11:27] service means you only work when people
[11:29] are watching you
[11:31] i looked it up
[11:33] may god help us all churches
[11:35] right
[11:37] in other words he's telling the slaves
[11:38] don't just work when the when the boss
[11:40] is around and you might get a whip on
[11:43] those days they would have got whipped
[11:44] they could have died
[11:45] under capital punishment
[11:48] don't work just when somebody's watching
[11:49] you work like god is always watching you
[11:52] praise god
[11:54] not with eye servants as men don't
[11:56] please men lord so you only work hard uh
[12:00] uh if you're afraid of men if you want
[12:02] to please men and sometimes but you'll
[12:04] work hard all the time if you want to be
[12:06] a god pleaser amen
[12:08] there goes my voice
[12:13] see that's what a servant of christ does
[12:16] they're not lazy they serve god from the
[12:19] depths of their heart praise god amen
[12:22] with good will doing service as is the
[12:24] lord not to men
[12:28] right so each one of us each one of us
[12:29] have a job right and a boss well
[12:32] our attitude should be why thank god for
[12:33] my boss but really my greater boss is
[12:35] jesus
[12:37] but i'm going to serve my earthly boss
[12:38] like i'm serving my heavenly boss
[12:41] and the church said
[12:43] amen that's what the bible says
[12:45] we can't be lazy
[12:46] so see we've got scripture and we can
[12:48] use the scripture lord i'm going into
[12:50] work today with fear and trembling
[12:52] or i'm taking the home school lesson i'm
[12:54] taking the homeschool course today i'm
[12:55] reading this book with fear and
[12:57] trembling because i'm not learning from
[12:58] my parents i'm learning from god praise
[13:00] god
[13:02] like i remember i told you i think i
[13:04] told you this when i wrote the first
[13:05] book about modesty i always wondered why
[13:07] would god have me still go to college
[13:09] but when i was in college i found that
[13:10] book about what americans wore
[13:13] so i just saw how even my college
[13:15] experience god was guiding that what if
[13:17] i would have skipped class that day i
[13:19] could not have wrote that first book if
[13:20] i would have skipped class that day but
[13:21] i never skipped class
[13:23] i never studied class
[13:25] i didn't unless i was maybe i'd take
[13:27] kristin out or something like that but i
[13:28] hardly i'd rarely ever ever skip to
[13:30] class because it was it was i knew it
[13:32] was a special gift i was a christian
[13:34] i knew i was called to be faithful
[13:36] praise god
[13:37] if i had not been faithful that class i
[13:39] would not have that book out there i'm
[13:40] still getting testimonies about that
[13:42] book praise god i got one this week as
[13:43] well
[13:45] see because you have to realize i'm
[13:46] doing this for god
[13:48] my whole life speaks of jesus christ
[13:50] praise god amen
[13:52] in every area of my life i'm supposed to
[13:54] manifest the character of jesus christ
[13:57] so they see in third grade they see
[13:58] jesus christ and you as a third grader
[14:01] as a senior as a sophomore they see
[14:03] jesus christ in your life in every
[14:05] action because you're not serving man
[14:07] you're not a man pleaser you're a god
[14:09] pleaser amen amen
[14:12] and here's what you know
[14:14] whatever good you do on your job or in
[14:17] school
[14:18] god is going to pay you back amen
[14:22] i don't tell you i praise god that's
[14:24] what the bible said whatever good any
[14:26] man look at that any man it's even
[14:27] sinners
[14:28] if god sees anyone doing good that means
[14:31] it's an attribute of god they've learned
[14:33] that from god god placed that in them
[14:36] whether the man is good or the woman is
[14:38] good or bad whatever they do he will
[14:40] receive or she will receive some benefit
[14:43] some dividend some interest some payback
[14:46] from the lord himself
[14:49] god is watching us praise god
[14:51] we should be mighty workers on the job
[14:54] amen no doubt it's hard sometimes that's
[14:56] called seasons of uh trial right that's
[14:59] because
[15:00] that's called the trial of your faith
[15:01] praise god
[15:03] so what do you do you get through the
[15:04] trial get the victory and you renew your
[15:06] strength again praise god
[15:11] see whether he be bond or free so
[15:12] whether you are a slave in the roman
[15:14] system those days
[15:16] where you be a slave to your mortgage
[15:18] lender like me
[15:20] the bible says whatever good you do
[15:23] god will pay you back
[15:25] hallelujah when you when you serve god
[15:28] with singleness of heart your heart's
[15:30] not divided between the world and god no
[15:32] everything i do is with singleness of
[15:34] heart i've got one motive i got one
[15:36] objective to serve jesus christ praise
[15:38] god i know he placed me here i know he
[15:39] gave me this position on this job or in
[15:42] this school i know he's brought me here
[15:43] i know he's blessed me here i'm serving
[15:45] him and he will reward me because i'm
[15:47] doing what he wants me to do praise god
[15:49] you didn't even ask to be more praise
[15:51] god you didn't ask his country you'd be
[15:53] born in god bless you here god did
[15:55] exactly all about it but he'll reward
[15:57] you for doing his will praise god amen
[16:00] hallelujah
[16:01] he doesn't want lazy
[16:03] believers
[16:05] he wants believers to approach it with
[16:06] fear and trembling
[16:12] i love what brother anderson he's
[16:14] talking about jesus preaching out of the
[16:15] boat with the disciples
[16:17] he said i can see jesus moving getting a
[16:19] little closer all the time the crowds
[16:21] got great i could hear him get in the
[16:22] boat thrust a little from the bank he
[16:25] borrowed a ship from sight look he
[16:26] borrowed
[16:27] that wasn't jesus's ship in the natural
[16:30] now it was eternally
[16:32] because the bible said christ created
[16:34] all
[16:34] things hallelujah but as far as earthly
[16:37] in the earthly realm of economics that
[16:39] boat belonged to peter
[16:42] and he got through speaking he said to
[16:44] simon now you launch out into the deep
[16:46] and let down for the draw jesus never
[16:49] borrows nothing from you but what he
[16:51] will pay you back a hundred-fold praise
[16:54] god
[16:55] what do you do he sent him out there
[16:56] remember he said throw the net on the
[16:57] other side what do you get you got a
[16:58] huge huge catch
[17:01] how do you if you give anything if you
[17:03] dedicate anything about this dedicating
[17:05] your children think about dedicating
[17:06] your strength your energy anything you
[17:09] dedicate to jesus christ he'll pay you
[17:11] back a hundred fold
[17:12] amen amen that's exactly right praise
[17:15] god
[17:17] he said let him have your faith tonight
[17:18] how many want him to have your faith
[17:19] today praise god amen hallelujah the
[17:22] little boy come one time with some
[17:23] fishes in his hand there's 5 000 people
[17:25] standing there more now the little boy
[17:27] had five fishes it wasn't very much in
[17:29] his hands church my job my life isn't
[17:32] very much in my hands oh but if i could
[17:34] just place it in jesus's hands
[17:37] my time is not very much it seems
[17:39] limited oh but don't worry if you place
[17:41] it in a greater person's hands they can
[17:43] do more with your life than you can amen
[17:46] that's the very purpose you were created
[17:48] to praise god to give god the
[17:50] opportunity to place your life into the
[17:52] nail scarred hands of jesus christ the
[17:54] eternal hands of jesus christ and watch
[17:56] him bless it and it'll be abundant it'll
[17:58] go above and beyond anything you could
[18:00] ask or think amen
[18:03] hallelujah
[18:06] oh hallelujah wasn't very much it's not
[18:08] very much in my hands my life is not
[18:11] very much to me
[18:12] but oh my when it's put into the masters
[18:14] hands what it could do it fed five
[18:17] thousand the master's hand and what
[18:19] little you have tonight just give it
[18:21] into the hands of the master
[18:23] then launch launch out into the deep and
[18:25] let down
[18:28] i just say jesus take all of me praise
[18:30] god
[18:31] take all of me
[18:33] now let's launch out to the deep praise
[18:34] god amen
[18:36] i love it
[18:38] now i'm not going to go through i'm
[18:39] going to go through these quickly
[18:39] remember the bible said in proverbs keep
[18:42] or guard from danger your heart with all
[18:44] diligence
[18:46] so your
[18:47] your feelings and your affections for
[18:49] jesus protect that with all your
[18:51] strength
[18:52] in other words don't fall in love with
[18:54] anything else in the world
[18:56] guard your heart guard your love amen
[18:58] all right right because love is the
[19:00] motivator behind all works
[19:02] lovers of pleasures more lovers of god
[19:04] right
[19:05] but jesus said we love the light so we
[19:07] come to light so our deeds are manifest
[19:09] in the light praise god amen
[19:12] put away from your forward life
[19:14] i'm sorry forward mouth rather and
[19:16] perverse let's put far from me let thine
[19:18] eyes look right on and let thine islands
[19:20] look straight before they see don't
[19:21] don't get your eyes off the of the lord
[19:23] keep your eyes straight ahead on the
[19:24] lord keep your eyes off the things of
[19:26] the world
[19:27] but i forgot that out of it are the
[19:29] issues of life
[19:31] so whatever you love whatever your love
[19:33] is focused on out of that will come
[19:35] forth life
[19:36] you'll find life to do it if you really
[19:38] love something you're going to find a
[19:39] way to get there
[19:41] right
[19:43] like when chris and i were recording you
[19:45] know
[19:46] i would have every now and then the
[19:47] football season i'd have one day up
[19:50] and we would like work and train and
[19:51] have all these weeks but i get one day
[19:53] off so that morning i get up at 6 a.m i
[19:55] drive three hours to see her and i'd
[19:56] stay real late
[19:58] i stay until like midnight you know and
[19:59] then and then i get home at 3am you know
[20:02] and i go to practice the next day you
[20:04] know see because whatever you love it's
[20:07] easy to do
[20:09] right so whenever we love when we love
[20:11] jesus if we love a natural person that
[20:13] much how much more shall we love jesus
[20:15] praise god
[20:17] i got to share austin austin works
[20:19] sometimes till 2 30 a.m and then come to
[20:21] church at 10 a.m the next that same
[20:22] morning right brother
[20:24] i've seen him do it amen i like that
[20:26] praise god whenever you love you'll make
[20:28] sure you have time for it praise god
[20:31] but you got to guard your love with all
[20:33] diligence
[20:36] peter said the same give all diligence
[20:39] to keep adding to your life that's why
[20:40] we keep coming back to the house of god
[20:42] to add more strength
[20:44] to add more character praise god to add
[20:46] more anointing amen to us to let jesus
[20:49] add to our lives praise god amen
[20:52] give diligence to make your calling
[20:54] election sure
[20:56] for if you do these things you will
[20:57] never fail so you can if you can humble
[20:59] yourself and actually do the word of god
[21:01] not just talk about that's what we
[21:03] always do sometimes you know we always
[21:05] talk about the rapture or we talk about
[21:07] these things or talk about that we don't
[21:09] want to just be talkers we want to be
[21:11] dealers
[21:13] see we'll talk and say well i heard a
[21:15] good word today or i read a good thing
[21:17] today i'm going to do this we better
[21:19] make sure we do it
[21:21] let's not just talk about it let's do it
[21:23] because peter says in doing in obedience
[21:26] is the power
[21:27] the power is in obedience because if you
[21:29] do these things you will prove your
[21:31] calling you'll prove your call to be the
[21:33] gentile bride of jesus christ if you do
[21:36] the word of god amen
[21:38] hallelujah that will prove your calls
[21:40] that will prove you're elected that will
[21:42] prove you're predestinated that will
[21:44] prove your ordained that approve you
[21:46] were chosen in the mind of christ before
[21:48] the foundation of the world
[21:51] and so there will be an entrance for you
[21:53] jesus will let you enter into heaven
[21:55] praise god
[21:58] if you do the word of god
[22:00] an entrance will be open to you
[22:03] what a blessing and how many times will
[22:05] you follow church how many times do you
[22:06] fall
[22:08] never
[22:09] you never fall
[22:10] see you'll go through battles but you'll
[22:11] never fall
[22:13] you'll never be a castaway like a judas
[22:15] right
[22:16] you'll never be shipwrecked like judas
[22:19] praise god
[22:21] you'll never uh
[22:22] you'll never be apostate like dennis
[22:26] and love the things of the world more
[22:28] than the prophet of god's message amen
[22:30] see but you got to give all diligence
[22:33] can't be lazy
[22:34] amen peter says
[22:36] i just defined it there diligence means
[22:38] uh just uh earnestness that means you
[22:41] really earnest means you really want to
[22:42] do it

[22:54] what's the what's that what's something
[22:56] you're eager to do on your day off
[22:58] do that that's we don't have that same
[23:00] attitude towards the things of god i i
[23:02] believe it i'm eager to go to church
[23:04] every sunday i'm sorry nobody's gotta
[23:05] make me i'm eager every wednesday night
[23:08] no one's got a baby praise god
[23:09] hallelujah eager to do it that's what
[23:12] all diligence is give all eagerness
[23:15] to add to let god add his character to
[23:17] your heart and life praise god
[23:21] let's be eager for the things of god and
[23:23] jesus it really says this is the
[23:24] greatest commandment because you must
[23:25] love god with all your strength
[23:28] all your eagerness
[23:30] all your love this is the greatest
[23:31] commandment to love jesus christ with
[23:34] all your heart so let's not be lazy i'm
[23:35] gonna i'm gonna want to be eager for uh
[23:37] for jesus by god's grace
[23:39] let's not be lazy now i just i'm just
[23:41] showing this quote because i preached
[23:42] this a couple years ago and i did the
[23:43] purpose series but i just look at that
[23:45] look at that man look at look at the
[23:47] bags of his eyes no doubt crying and
[23:49] fasting for the civil war
[23:51] six hundred thousand men that died on
[23:52] these grounds here in america
[23:55] look at his hair did he look like he
[23:56] even had a comb
[23:58] you know got time to comb his hair men
[24:00] are dying right there right
[24:01] better die
[24:03] in the battles
[24:04] abraham lincoln i love what brother ever
[24:05] says
[24:07] he says he was deprived of an education
[24:09] think of that he had no education
[24:10] growing up
[24:12] but yet there was something in his heart
[24:13] there was a purpose in his heart this is
[24:15] why i wasn't lazy
[24:17] god placed something in his heart
[24:19] he said i like a man of vision i like
[24:21] people that's got something they're
[24:22] fighting for see mighty men and women
[24:25] what are you fighting for you must be
[24:26] fighting for something here this morning
[24:28] amen
[24:30] not just laying around well whatever
[24:32] comes along that'll be all right
[24:34] so there's something shirts that are not
[24:36] all right
[24:38] this proves it when something's happened
[24:40] to us they are not all right and we've
[24:42] got to overcome them by the grace of god
[24:44] we have to rebuke them right we have to
[24:46] cast them down we might have to pray
[24:48] until we get the victory there's some
[24:50] things that are not all right in our
[24:51] lives
[24:53] it's when the enemy comes in like a
[24:55] flood
[24:58] he said i love these words i got right
[24:59] on my phone oh be up and at it and
[25:01] lincoln never let his education stand in
[25:03] the way he had something to do so even
[25:05] though he could you know when he got to
[25:07] his teenage years or adulthood he could
[25:09] have said well i never had an education
[25:11] i guess i'm not going to go into
[25:12] politics but what he could have said he
[25:14] could have complained he said well
[25:15] everybody's 15 years ahead of me so why
[25:17] why even bother do that
[25:19] do not just give an example like like
[25:20] why are they even going to college now
[25:22] everybody's already got their degree
[25:23] that's my age
[25:25] i don't know what god's leading you to
[25:26] do i'm just saying it's just a simple
[25:27] example well they've already got ahead
[25:29] of me here
[25:30] i'm already way behind
[25:32] but lincoln didn't let that stop him
[25:33] because there was something in his heart
[25:35] to deliver those slaves amen that's what
[25:37] it was
[25:39] there's something in his heart and he
[25:40] just had to make up for his education he
[25:42] just had to keep going amen he didn't
[25:45] believe those voices he went by the
[25:47] leaning of god that god had placed in
[25:49] his heart he was a man of vision praise
[25:51] god
[25:52] he saw those slaves set free how did
[25:56] jesus saw you set free hallelujah
[26:00] where did he see it in his mind before
[26:02] the foundation of the world he knew
[26:03] you'd be free and free indeed in
[26:06] christ's holy
[26:07] name amen
[26:11] [Music]
[26:12] he had something to do i just feel like
[26:14] i got to get into politics he'd say
[26:17] i think every christian not just the
[26:18] preachers
[26:20] every christian ought to be that way
[26:22] find your purpose and go do it
[26:26] he talks about people that attend this
[26:28] chapter
[26:29] of the businessman fellowship
[26:33] he said have a purpose in life something
[26:35] you're going to do
[26:38] he said let's go do something about it
[26:40] praise god
[26:41] all right you like that praise god
[26:42] that's awesome i love that now i
[26:44] preached over this a few weeks ago so
[26:46] i'm not going to spend much time with
[26:47] the bible says if you plant to the holy
[26:49] spirit you shall of the holy spirit reap
[26:52] life everlasting
[26:54] so human effort
[26:56] human effort
[26:57] you know i always look at the human
[26:59] effort of my wife out in our garden she
[27:01] goes there every spring and plants those
[27:03] onions or those garlic or that corn
[27:05] right or the potatoes right it's human
[27:07] effort she she could she could have all
[27:09] the seeds there and say lord bring forth
[27:11] the corn bring forth the corn right
[27:14] she can stand there and praise it i
[27:15] speak to that seed i speak to that chord
[27:17] right she can do all that right
[27:20] but it wouldn't do nothing because you
[27:21] got to follow the laws of god amen
[27:24] god requires human effort for fruit to
[27:27] be brought forth praise god
[27:29] just like god requires effort for you
[27:32] and i if you want to see the fruits of
[27:33] the holy spirit if you want to see
[27:35] fruits to our lives through our
[27:36] ministries it requires us taking what
[27:39] god has given us and us to have a
[27:41] purpose and know what god's taught us to
[27:43] do and then go do it praise god amen
[27:47] have a purpose amen to me i believe in
[27:50] speaking we've spoken to we spoke in the
[27:52] bearing wounds right and they brought
[27:53] forth we spoke into different situations
[27:55] you know cygnicism you speak but i'm
[27:58] saying not every time is going to be
[27:59] just speaking to it sometimes there's
[28:01] human effort into it also like this most
[28:03] of the time there's human effort into it
[28:05] of all the testimonies i think we've
[28:07] ever had i think most of it involves
[28:08] some human effort
[28:11] right pray come up for prayer
[28:13] i'll confess you know seek god pray
[28:16] trust the lord you know listen to more
[28:17] sermons humble yourself repent in most
[28:20] cases human effort is required
[28:24] so your human effort connects to certain
[28:26] rewards spiritually
[28:28] now i think this is the so i'm moving on
[28:30] from lazy's laziness now to death here
[28:34] faith in the holy scriptures make you
[28:36] mighty to overcome death or say like
[28:38] this the fear of death
[28:45] i love this i was just a baptist
[28:47] preacher and i thought my if this
[28:48] baptist preacher could have faith like
[28:49] this what about me
[28:51] look at the bible says i love it so see
[28:53] we're not going in the tribulation
[28:54] because of this right here oh i love
[28:56] this hey i did a friend
[28:59] my second favorite chapter after isaiah
[29:01] 53 i think his first thousand chapter
[29:03] five praise god
[29:04] okay so if i ever have a funeral do
[29:06] isaiah 53 honey and if i think i got a
[29:09] second chapter put this one up there for
[29:10] me praise god for god has not appointed
[29:13] us to wrath
[29:15] but to obtain salvation by our lord
[29:17] jesus christ
[29:20] i'm going to be delivered i'm saved
[29:22] i'm rescued by jesus christ hallelujah
[29:26] who died for us that weather so i love
[29:28] this idea whether whether i live or die
[29:32] i'm not alone the bible says whether i
[29:34] wake i'm awake or i sleep i go to the
[29:36] grave
[29:37] we should or we do live together with
[29:41] him praise god
[29:42] what a promise if i die tonight in my
[29:45] sleep don't cry too long because i'm
[29:47] with jesus i'm together with christ amen
[29:51] each one of us that's a reality praise
[29:53] god whether i wait or whether i sleep
[29:56] i'm with christ christ is with me and
[29:58] he's with if he's with me he'll never
[30:00] leave me he'll never forsake me praise
[30:02] god
[30:04] baptist preachers like 80 86 and he said
[30:07] this is the scripture i've been quoting
[30:09] every night before i go to bed because
[30:10] i'm worried about dying
[30:12] i thought what an honest soul praise god
[30:14] what a beautiful scripture to quote
[30:17] whether i make it through this night or
[30:18] not whether i wake or sleep i'm living
[30:21] together with christ amen in other words
[30:24] christ
[30:25] christ has made an abode in my soul
[30:27] praise god amen
[30:29] i am the tabernacle of god amen no
[30:32] you're not children you are the temple
[30:34] of the holy ghost amen
[30:37] hallelujah
[30:38] he wants to live in you abide in you
[30:40] speak through you he's walking with you
[30:42] praise god whether you live or die you
[30:45] are christ and christ will be with you
[30:49] what a hallelujah amen
[30:51] he said that has taken away the fear of
[30:52] death from his life an 86 year old
[30:54] preacher
[30:56] he's got some good wisdom too and for a
[30:57] baptist he's pretty wise he's got a gift
[30:59] of wisdom
[31:01] now real born again child of god looks
[31:03] to heaven and knows the father holds the
[31:05] reigns of all things you believe that
[31:07] amen god holds the reigns on your job
[31:11] god holds the reigns on your family
[31:14] your brothers and sisters praise god
[31:16] amen
[31:17] your aunts and uncles he holds the
[31:19] reigns he controls all those things
[31:21] he's got it all under control
[31:24] we saw a couple riding horses the other
[31:26] night on our daily reminding me they had
[31:27] the rings they got it all controlled
[31:29] the one the male horse got a little
[31:31] jumpy so the woman slapped him on the
[31:33] side of the neck i don't know if that's
[31:34] right but
[31:35] i said that's interesting she slapped it
[31:37] right there and then by the end they got
[31:38] back on the ride she's all kissed at him
[31:40] oh you did a good ride boy you know all
[31:42] these things like
[31:43] she got him by the
[31:44] reins she had control
[31:47] god has everything under control praise
[31:49] god amen
[31:51] i'm not teaching i'm preaching to you
[31:53] praise god
[31:54] i do a lot of teaching but i want to
[31:56] praise you praise god amen preaching is
[31:58] declaring the good news it's good news
[32:01] god has everything in your life under
[32:03] the reigns of his control praise god
[32:06] you can trust god with your life
[32:10] he does all things well not some things
[32:13] all things well
[32:14] and there's neither death nor sorrow for
[32:16] a christian wait what brother what
[32:19] there's neither death nor sorrow
[32:22] for a christian
[32:24] why brother adam
[32:25] because christians don't die
[32:27] there's not one scripture that says a
[32:28] christian dies it's very vice versa
[32:31] jesus said if you die believe on him you
[32:33] pass from death into life
[32:37] in other words death in that case means
[32:39] separation from god you'll never be
[32:41] separated from god you won't go down to
[32:43] the grave or go down to the pit you'll
[32:45] go up to heaven you go up to the
[32:47] heavenly rails you'll go up where the
[32:49] angels of god are where the heavenly
[32:51] hosts say holy holy holy is the lord god
[32:54] almighty
[32:56] you're going up to the place of holiness
[32:58] praise god
[32:59] not the lower place of hell
[33:03] and that's the greatest thing that put
[33:05] fear over man was death
[33:07] but jesus died for us and death is
[33:09] swallowed up in victory amen so when
[33:12] coming to the end of this road like
[33:13] saint paul he said o death where is i
[33:15] stinging great where is thy victory but
[33:17] said thanks be to god who gives us the
[33:19] victory to our lord jesus christ amen
[33:22] i used to wonder sometimes what's the
[33:24] matter with the christian church they're
[33:25] so scared of things
[33:27] why you got nothing to be scared about
[33:31] well the first word nearly jesus said
[33:34] after the resurrection was fear not
[33:36] the very first thing he says don't be
[33:38] afraid
[33:40] see don't fear don't get scared there
[33:41] ain't nothing going to happen nothing
[33:43] can happen nothing can bother a
[33:44] christian
[33:46] amen
[33:47] not even death itself can touch the
[33:49] christian
[33:50] he that hears my words and believes on
[33:51] him that sent me and has everlasting
[33:52] life and shall not come into
[33:54] condemnation but is passed from death
[33:55] into life amen death itself has no reign
[33:58] over a christian christ died in our
[34:00] stead amen what a marvel what a faith
[34:02] that ought to build up in the people
[34:04] something that will tow the mark you'll
[34:06] never get nothing by being a little
[34:07] jellyfish christian
[34:10] did you ever see a jellyfish you just
[34:11] hit him he spatters all over everything
[34:13] i've never hit a jellyfish but
[34:15] i trust the prophet have you seen him
[34:18] a jellyfish you don't want usually eats
[34:19] them crabs and things on the side of the
[34:21] seashore comes up his pincher and cuts
[34:23] him in two and takes him down since the
[34:25] jellyfish just lays there so jellyfish
[34:27] is floating around i think i've seen a
[34:29] couple videos of them right they just
[34:30] float around
[34:32] and then a crowd will come up with his
[34:34] pictures
[34:35] and just because he's floating he's not
[34:37] really active he has no defense he just
[34:39] sits there and chops him up into little
[34:41] pieces oh let's not let the devil chop
[34:43] us up into little pieces
[34:45] let's if we know the devil's to come
[34:47] let's move out of the way amen or even
[34:49] better let's hit him back praise god
[34:53] remember on wednesday they said he put
[34:54] the devil or scriptures right in the
[34:56] devil's face
[34:58] put it right in his face don't let that
[35:00] guy chop you up don't let him chop your
[35:02] dreams up and your desires and your
[35:04] hopes praise god don't let them chop up
[35:06] all your love and all your devotion to
[35:07] god don't let them chop up all your uh
[35:10] uh your diligence and things like that
[35:12] stand there but fight or move out of the
[35:14] way we read it where paul says paul
[35:17] don't do the flee from youthful lost
[35:19] phrase god right that's right see the
[35:22] jedi just lays there and lets them beat
[35:24] them up and cut them up don't lay their
[35:26] children fleeing from youthful love and
[35:28] father righteousness peace joy and the
[35:31] holy ghost praise god
[35:35] don't just be a jellyfish let's sing cut
[35:37] up all your desires

[35:43] ruin everything in your life
[35:48] he says brother we need some christians
[35:50] not jellyfish but with a backbone
[35:53] i think we're talking about vertebrates
[35:54] and invertebrates if i'm right in
[35:56] science it's been a while since i've
[35:57] studied that but i think that's what
[35:58] we're talking about oh i don't mean fuss
[36:00] with people so see brother man when you
[36:02] when you're strong in the faith you
[36:03] don't fuss with people
[36:05] but you stand for the god-given rights
[36:07] that christ died for amen
[36:10] praise god
[36:11] so you can i've seen brother uh dennis
[36:13] mcbride do this all the time we've sat
[36:14] and talked with him and different people
[36:16] and think people will say things you
[36:17] don't agree with and he'll just i just
[36:19] it's so funny they just
[36:22] look at him like that
[36:24] and they'll say
[36:25] well brother
[36:26] i kind of see it like this
[36:29] [Laughter]
[36:30] that's how he that's how he uh he
[36:33] differs with people
[36:34] he just lets them say whatever they want
[36:37] and just so sweetly the bible said uh if
[36:39] you answer with a soft word you turn
[36:41] away wrath
[36:43] if i ever seen it right there real good
[36:44] it's your brother dennis see man
[36:46] so i kind of see it this way brother
[36:50] that's a great way
[36:51] see he's not fussing with people
[36:54] but he's standing for his beliefs amen i
[36:57] like that praise god

[38:53] he says and the blood of jesus is just
[38:56] as good as it would be shed 10 minutes
[38:59] ago
[39:02] jesus blood was shed 2 000 years ago but
[39:05] it's just as powerful right now in 2022
[39:09] praise god
[39:11] i don't care if they have the shroud of
[39:12] taurus i don't care if they've got nails
[39:15] all the 50 nails they got that
[39:16] supposedly went in jesus i don't care
[39:18] what they got none of that has any
[39:20] virtue the virtue is in the spirit the
[39:23] life of the blood that was shed amen the
[39:25] virtues in the life of jesus christ and
[39:28] it's just his father david it'll never
[39:30] lose his power
[39:32] reaches to the highest mountains of
[39:34] victory but also for us it goes to the
[39:36] very depths the lowest valley we could
[39:39] ever be in god's spirit is there to meet
[39:41] us he stands with us in the valley of
[39:44] the shadow of death amen amen and so
[39:47] i'll fear no evil because he's with me
[39:49] amen
[39:51] hallelujah amen
[39:54] the blood is just as real
[39:56] as if we were just on the cross and just
[39:58] heard him say
[39:59] it is finished
[40:01] we all be weeping and crying
[40:04] just as real praise god
[40:07] he said every believer it's your
[40:08] profession that's what hebrews says do
[40:11] not lose the confidence of your
[40:13] profession of faith
[40:16] he says in church isn't this true
[40:18] sometimes we get scared to use our
[40:19] rights that's awesome
[40:22] right sometimes you get scared but god
[40:24] is merciful
[40:26] remember peter said
[40:28] god's divine power has given us all
[40:31] things everybody say all things again
[40:32] ready oh i wonder what's like last year
[40:34] right
[40:35] oh we have all things that we need to
[40:37] live a life of godliness
[40:39] and holiness that's right
[40:41] how
[40:43] because we've been given precious great
[40:45] impressions not just promises great and
[40:48] precious
[40:51] god can't use any other words oh these
[40:53] promises are more than promises they're
[40:55] great and precious praise god
[40:58] look at the wording god used god even
[41:00] used exceedingly abundantly above all
[41:02] yet exceeding abundance look at that
[41:05] exceeding abundance now for spiritual
[41:07] gifts for spiritual rewards not so much
[41:10] natural but it's spiritual praise god
[41:13] exceeding abundance so here's abundant
[41:15] so exceedingly abundant is way up here
[41:18] he's going to do exceedingly abundant
[41:20] above all we ask our thing according to
[41:22] his will his good pleasure praise him
[41:25] all right that's what that's what i've
[41:26] been preaching on labor on we must first
[41:28] find the will of god
[41:30] and then when we find the will of god
[41:31] then he'll do exceedingly above the
[41:33] abundant that he promised
[41:37] hallelujah
[41:40] because he wants us to partake he wants
[41:42] us to feast or enjoy his divine nature
[41:47] in other words lord i want your i want
[41:48] your faith to flow through me right i
[41:50] want your virtue your knowledge i want
[41:52] your your patience to flow through me
[41:56] and when i see myself patient
[41:58] where i wasn't patient last time when i
[42:00] see that patience there now i can
[42:02] rejoice because i'm i'm enjoying his
[42:04] divine nature amen
[42:06] i can see i've grown and now the nature
[42:08] of the holy spirit is flowing through me
[42:10] it's no longer the human nature of jesse
[42:12] smith getting in the way but it's
[42:13] christ's
[42:14] nature amen
[42:19] so now we appreciate them new we've
[42:21] preached on all these topics the church
[42:23] here's what your inheritance is
[42:26] you have hope instead of depression amen
[42:29] that's your inheritance that's right so
[42:31] satan says well look what's going to
[42:33] happen you're going to be depressed say
[42:34] stop the devil get behind me my
[42:37] inheritance
[42:38] is hope i have a real hope my home is
[42:41] anchored in heaven praise god that's
[42:44] your inheritance
[42:46] depression is not your inheritance
[42:50] hallelujah
[42:52] satan says god doesn't see you
[42:54] no the bible says i am cared for and all
[42:57] he got to do is cast his care on the
[43:00] lord praise god amen
[43:02] he does see me
[43:05] saint says you're not loved
[43:06] i can go thus saying romans 9
[43:09] he that the gentiles that were not of
[43:11] his people are his people i can say thus
[43:14] say the scripture satan i am god's
[43:16] people and i am beloved amen amen i've
[43:19] got thus saying the scripture hallelujah
[43:23] i'm loved
[43:24] so stop it satan get behind me
[43:29] when you doubt what's going to happen
[43:30] say i'm going to trust in the lord with
[43:32] all my heart amen he is trustworthy i
[43:34] don't know he's trustworthy amen
[43:37] satan say oh you need to be stressed out
[43:39] about this oh you better worry about
[43:40] this this may happen i'm going to have
[43:42] the peace of god that's my inheritance
[43:44] instead of anxiety amen
[43:47] as i ended with this one on wednesday
[43:49] god always causes me to triumph in
[43:52] christ hallelujah
[43:54] always he always makes me come out on
[43:57] top hallelujah
[43:58] hey man
[44:03] kind of liking my this is just the
[44:04] natural uh my senior year i never lost a
[44:07] race
[44:08] until the second to last race i got
[44:10] second place but it was a preliminary it
[44:12] wasn't the final race
[44:14] and so
[44:15] i lost that race
[44:17] because i was tired i was sad that our
[44:19] team had dropped the baton in the
[44:21] previous race i was sad i was
[44:22] discouraged the next day cam came up and
[44:24] cam was like don't he was a christian at
[44:26] that time he said he's like stop
[44:27] worrying about that he said just he's
[44:29] like
[44:30] my leg was hurting he's like he's like
[44:31] take that thing off take that thing off
[44:33] your leg and just run just just be
[44:34] yourself jess i remember cam gave me
[44:36] this pep talk and so i went out there
[44:38] and i won the next two things
[44:39] and then i had i got a re-race on that
[44:41] race i lost the day before in the finals
[44:43] so in the finals i got to run it again
[44:46] and that time the lord calls me to
[44:48] triumph and i want that ring straight's
[44:49] got him
[44:50] i lost the preliminary because i was
[44:52] discouraged but cam's word lifted me up
[44:55] praise god and i come back and so i
[44:57] ended the season where i never lost
[44:58] praise god as far as finals i never lost
[45:01] he always caused me this triumph now see
[45:03] satan wants to make us a failure
[45:05] spiritually or naturally but we don't
[45:07] have to accept that because the bible
[45:09] says god always will cause us to triumph
[45:12] in christ jesus amen amen in other words
[45:15] it will do the word of god it will obey
[45:18] the word of god he'll work it out where
[45:20] you in the battle praise god
[45:22] he'll make sure you win amen go make
[45:25] sure you come out with a pure heart
[45:26] praise god amen
[45:31] and we saw it today
[45:33] your inheritance is to be diligent not
[45:34] lazy
[45:36] so you can say satan i'm not i'm not
[45:37] called to be lazy i'm called to be
[45:39] diligent
[45:40] get behind me satan
[45:42] here's what we did last time
[45:46] the bible said there are many many other
[45:48] afflictions of the righteous but the
[45:50] lord delivers me out of all of them my
[45:52] brother jesus i go through so many hard
[45:53] times that's okay the lord's delivery
[45:55] out of every single one
[45:56] i i've never seen a fail yet praise god
[46:01] don't we all the bible said all that
[46:03] live uh godly in christ jesus shall
[46:06] suffer persecution
[46:09] some more public than others
[46:12] but god promised this church
[46:16] even though we have these afflictions
[46:17] that seem unending god will bring us out
[46:20] of everyone
[46:22] now we could take revenge satan could
[46:24] say take revenge on that brother yeah
[46:26] take revenge on that sister but our
[46:28] answer should be safe to get behind me
[46:30] i'm going to be good to my enemies amen
[46:33] venus is mine saith the lord don't
[46:36] forget those last words saith the lord
[46:38] because you might quote the scripture
[46:39] and say vengeance is mine
[46:40] and then stop and then you would try to
[46:42] take vengeance
[46:45] finish those three more important words
[46:47] vengeance is mine
[46:49] the lord
[46:50] not mine but vengeance is god's
[46:53] don't leave out those three important
[46:55] words
[46:57] instead of lusting satan will bring a
[46:59] lust to attract you then come back with
[47:01] purity so i made a covenant with my eyes
[47:04] not to look upon a maid praise god
[47:07] my eyes were made to look straight ahead
[47:09] praise god not to the right not to do
[47:11] that praise god my eyes are trained to
[47:13] look on spiritual truths praise god
[47:17] satan says you should be impatient just
[47:19] go make it happen go make it happen
[47:21] yourself but god says no be patient and
[47:23] have expectation that's your inheritance
[47:26] don't try to make something happen you
[47:28] trust god to make it happen amen
[47:32] we saw this oh oh oh god uh satan says
[47:34] oh see look god don't love you you lack
[47:36] food you like money or you're like this
[47:38] you're like that the bible says i can do
[47:40] all things through christ who
[47:41] strengthens me amen god shall supply all
[47:44] my need ah according to his riches in
[47:46] glory in christ jesus praise god amen
[47:49] amen
[47:51] that's the promise of god
[47:52] well i feel abandoned like israel i'll
[47:54] never get to the place i'm supposed to
[47:56] be
[47:57] no satan you're a liar god said if he's
[47:59] gonna put israel in their position with
[48:02] all of his heart and soul god will do
[48:03] the same thing for you praise god
[48:05] because you're not just a servant you're
[48:07] a wife praise god amen oh he gotta use
[48:10] his whole heart and soul to place his
[48:12] bride right in the middle of his perfect
[48:14] will praise god
[48:16] i know you're getting tired let me try
[48:17] to finish up here by god's grace
[48:21] thank you
[48:23] the spirit of god will always lift up a
[48:25] standard amen
[48:27] now i never quite understood this so i
[48:28] have a little note on that
[48:30] i've always known like a standard is
[48:32] like a banner or a flag
[48:35] but i've always thought you know like
[48:36] flood water so i've always thought god
[48:37] would like you know build up some type
[48:39] of a bridge or you know wall or
[48:40] something like that but it's not that
[48:42] i've always thought it differently like
[48:43] that
[48:45] i've never quite understood this and
[48:47] then yesterday i was in the prayer
[48:48] closet in the morning i was crying i was
[48:50] you know confessing my sins i was asking
[48:52] god to help heal people and everything
[48:55] and all of a sudden this scripture came
[48:56] to my mind and it actually stirred me up
[48:58] in my prayer closet oh i want to preach
[49:01] on that tomorrow
[49:03] i was just saying i was just praying all
[49:05] of a sudden i said when the enemy comes
[49:06] in like a flood the spirit of god will
[49:08] raise up a standard against it amen i'm
[49:10] just
[49:11] confessing my battles to the lord and
[49:13] asking god to be merciful and that
[49:14] scripture it's like the scripture struck
[49:16] me and i i just i started weeping and
[49:17] praising the lord i'm gonna preach that
[49:19] tomorrow so i finished studying i took
[49:21] the kids on our our you know usual daddy
[49:24] day we call it you know the errands and
[49:26] and i was just scrolling you know i was
[49:27] listening to sermon on saturday before
[49:30] and i found a brother and a
[49:32] message in his sermon was this that was
[49:34] the title this uh when the enemy comes
[49:36] in like a flood i'm like oh i just
[49:37] prayed that this morning
[49:40] that don't happen very much i believe
[49:41] that's god
[49:42] so i listened to it and then i went he
[49:44] was referencing some commentary so i
[49:46] went and looked at some commentaries
[49:48] so let's look at some of these thoughts
[49:50] here now the word standard is used 20
[49:52] times in the old testament 22 rather
[49:54] it means like a flagpole or a banner
[49:56] okay so flat yes
[50:00] now three of these verses three out of
[50:02] these 22 speak of a god lifting up a
[50:04] standard against the enemy
[50:07] three of them
[50:10] now in numbers chapter one
[50:13] we're not going to read all this but
[50:15] the bible said israel now this is when
[50:16] they're after they've left egypt right
[50:18] and god's numbering them right before
[50:20] they go in the wilderness
[50:23] the children of israel shall pitch their
[50:24] tents every man by his own camp and
[50:26] every man by his own standard through
[50:28] their hosts
[50:30] so if you're an israelite you are
[50:32] assigned to this flag or you're assigned
[50:34] to that flag
[50:36] but the levite shall pitch around the
[50:38] tabernacle the testimony amen the
[50:40] levites didn't have a flag they just had
[50:41] god
[50:42] amen praise god they had no flag all
[50:46] they had was the pillar of fire over the
[50:48] tabernacle of the holiest place
[50:51] amen
[50:53] thank god amen
[50:55] it's either one you got you got a good
[50:57] place because you either got god's
[50:58] standard or you got god himself as your
[51:00] standard amen
[51:02] [Applause]
[51:04] that there be no wrath upon the
[51:05] congregation of children of israel and
[51:07] levite shall keep the charge of the
[51:08] tabernacle testimony so if you read
[51:11] numbers chapter one and two you'll see
[51:13] all the tribes all 12 tribes are given
[51:15] one of four standards
[51:18] or banners or flagpoles
[51:21] and there's four standards judah dan
[51:23] ephraim and reuben
[51:25] so to the north was dan
[51:28] east judah
[51:29] west
[51:30] ephraim
[51:31] and then south was reuben
[51:34] so god says my army is now going to move
[51:36] out of justification in the
[51:38] sanctification
[51:41] and they got to reach the promised land
[51:43] praise god
[51:44] and if they're going to reach it they
[51:45] need four beasts i mean four of
[51:48] flagpoles i mean four standards praise
[51:50] god amen
[51:52] they're gonna reach the baptism of the
[51:53] holy ghost if they reach the promised
[51:55] land they need four beasts they need
[51:58] four anointings that'll guide my church
[52:00] into its position to receive its
[52:02] inheritance amen oh it's not like the
[52:05] church does that amen
[52:07] god gives us four anointings to bring
[52:08] the church in the right complete uh
[52:10] complete inheritance complete location
[52:14] glory
[52:18] now the standard was the position of the
[52:20] family army
[52:22] and you would always fight by your
[52:24] family side church
[52:27] when so when you go out to battle if
[52:28] you're a man you want to fight by
[52:30] strangers you're fighting by your own
[52:31] family
[52:32] because that's where you hung out you
[52:34] hung out with your your banner
[52:36] your standard you couldn't say well i
[52:38] don't want to go over i'd rather hang
[52:39] out with this person i already don't
[52:41] like my family all right you can do that
[52:45] you have to stay with where god placed
[52:47] you because god knew the best place for
[52:48] you
[52:50] amen it's like that story of uh was it
[52:52] manasseh or ephraim in the promised land
[52:54] remember they come to joshua and said
[52:56] we're too big
[52:57] uh it might have been ibrahim or
[52:59] manasseh we need more land and joshua's
[53:01] like no you got to conquer the land
[53:03] you've already got
[53:04] what a beautiful type
[53:06] preachers are trying to go do things or
[53:08] people try to go help other people when
[53:10] they haven't let god help them
[53:12] you can't move on to help somebody if
[53:13] your life's in a mess
[53:15] you got to possess your land first then
[53:17] you can help somebody else
[53:21] same thing here
[53:22] you pitch by your family's banner
[53:26] you stay with your family and you fight
[53:27] with your family
[53:29] i mean fight the enemy
[53:31] you might fight you know in nice ways
[53:33] you might disagree
[53:35] but you always you're always with your
[53:37] family
[53:38] and you fight next to your brothers and
[53:40] sisters
[53:42] now
[53:43] here's the first verse that says lifting
[53:45] up a standard isaiah 49 22 thus saith
[53:48] the lord god behold i will lift up my
[53:51] hand to the gentiles this is like a hand
[53:52] of invitation i'm going to lift my hand
[53:54] to invite them see gentiles going to
[53:55] come in
[53:57] and set up my standard to the people so
[53:59] he said i'm going to lift my hand of the
[54:01] gentiles and i'm going to set a standard
[54:04] for the gentiles
[54:06] and they shall bring their sons in their
[54:09] arms
[54:10] and their daughters shall be carried
[54:12] upon their shoulders
[54:15] sound familiar
[54:17] about the precious love of god
[54:20] placing us on our on his shoulders
[54:23] praise god
[54:25] here's what albert barnes said
[54:27] a standard or an enzyme was erected in
[54:30] times of war to rally the forces of a
[54:32] nation around it
[54:35] here it is god would erect an ensign
[54:37] high in the sight of all nations and
[54:39] will call them to himself as a military
[54:41] leader musters his forces for battle
[54:46] so god is basically saying i'm the
[54:48] general
[54:49] i'm the leader of this army and i'm
[54:51] going to raise my hand and i'm going to
[54:53] invite the gentiles i've only to this
[54:55] point i've only gathered in the jews oh
[54:58] glory but now i'm raising my hand to the
[55:01] rest of the nations and saying come
[55:03] stand under my inside bring your sons
[55:06] and daughters don't leave your children
[55:08] behind amen bring them along and come
[55:11] stand we're rallying here right he says
[55:15] uh this is a time of battle and the
[55:18] title battle come to my side if you want
[55:20] to be saved come and stand with me
[55:22] praise god
[55:24] oh hallelujah
[55:27] come rally around jesus christ amen
[55:30] church there's a lot of people rallying
[55:32] around other things in christ like
[55:34] tick-tock's the big rallying thing right
[55:35] now
[55:36] they're round around black lives matter
[55:38] which all lives matter yeah
[55:41] you know
[55:42] the rally around
[55:44] the democrats and they rather around the
[55:45] republicans
[55:47] but we're supposed to rally around the
[55:49] one glory the god of heaven jehovah
[55:52] who's lifted up his hand and invited us
[55:54] to come praise god
[55:56] that's who we rally around amen
[55:59] because it's time for battle
[56:03] now next we see the same scripture but
[56:05] we see the tenth the parents
[56:07] tenderly hold their children and let
[56:09] them sit upon their shoulders
[56:12] so this is this is
[56:14] jesus inviting all the gentiles
[56:17] come to me
[56:19] battles approaching come to me and carry
[56:21] your children
[56:23] carry your children or set them on your
[56:24] shoulders
[56:25] he didn't say anything about weapons did
[56:27] he
[56:29] in this case he didn't say anything
[56:30] about the armor of god he said first
[56:32] come to the location where the generals
[56:34] act
[56:36] first be gathered with your people there
[56:37] it is right there amen
[56:40] first be gathered to jesus christ amen
[56:44] it's it's a battle time there's there's
[56:47] there's all kinds of enemies out there
[56:49] but we must flee we must go where the
[56:52] standard has been raised we must go
[56:54] where there's a flag flying with the
[56:56] enzyme that says jesus christ is king
[56:59] amen
[57:01] bring your children to don't leave them
[57:02] behind
[57:03] see a lot of people abandon their
[57:04] children right
[57:06] they let their children sin and get
[57:08] those sinful things and lustful things
[57:10] they abandon their children but we're
[57:11] supposed to bring them along praise god
[57:13] and look at this bring them when they're
[57:14] young too bring them let the little ones
[57:15] come to jesus
[57:18] hallelujah
[57:20] now let's move now to the next one
[57:22] that's the first one
[57:23] he's inviting all the gentiles to this
[57:25] standard and now this was our text
[57:29] when the enemy comes in like a flood
[57:33] the wind of the lord
[57:36] because spirit means ruach here
[57:38] this is the same ruach the hole in the
[57:40] holy spirit hovered over the earth
[57:43] in genesis chapter one the wind of the
[57:45] holy spirit so when you see the enemy
[57:47] coming in it looks like he's around he's
[57:49] coming in like a flood he's all around
[57:50] us he's sweeping in when the enemy comes
[57:53] in god will come down like a wind
[57:57] and raise up a standard a rallying place
[58:00] when the enemy comes in the spirit comes
[58:02] in like a wind and doesn't that remind
[58:04] us when israel crossed the red sea
[58:06] praise god
[58:09] you know uh pharaoh and all his armies
[58:11] and their chariots they're chasing the
[58:13] enemies coming in like a flood amen
[58:16] but what happened god says the holy
[58:18] spirit the bible said moses lifted up
[58:21] his hand and the bible said a strong
[58:23] wind hallelujah the enemy was coming
[58:25] like a flood but the spear lord came in
[58:28] like a wind and raised up a standard a
[58:30] place where god and his people could
[58:33] meet right through the red city praise
[58:35] god amen
[58:37] amen oh hallelujah
[58:39] when the enemy comes in like a flood the
[58:42] spirit of god will blow
[58:44] against the enemy and he'll raise up a
[58:47] place we can rally right here we can
[58:49] rally we're going to walk across not on
[58:51] wet muddy ground we're walking on dry
[58:53] ground our feet will not center baby man
[58:56] [Applause]
[58:58] right where we eat the world we'll stay
[59:00] right where we need to step we'll step
[59:02] into the perfect but of god because the
[59:04] ruroc the wind of the holy spirit the
[59:06] spirit lord will make a way for us amen
[59:09] amen
[59:09] hallelujah amen
[59:11] thank god amen
[59:15] you won't lose yourself church
[59:17] you won't step out of the perfect will
[59:18] of god because the wind is the holy
[59:20] spirit the spirit of god has raised up a
[59:22] stance
[59:24] against the enemy
[59:27] and that's a type of water baptism that
[59:28] ain't even a type of thing look at all
[59:30] the rest of god provides mana water from
[59:32] the rock and uh hunting the rock
[59:36] everything we need is right around us
[59:39] amen amen
[59:40] because you never leave us christ will
[59:42] never forsake us
[59:45] you don't invite the children to come
[59:46] and then abandon them
[59:49] he carries them through
[59:52] he sends us wind
[59:58] now do you know church the enemy comes
[1:00:00] black and blood remember the the beast
[1:00:02] system is called many waters remember
[1:00:03] that
[1:00:05] in revelation 17
[1:00:07] so we can apply this to our day the b
[1:00:09] system if you've ever never seen it now
[1:00:11] the b system is coming in like a flood i
[1:00:14] heard a preacher say this to yesterday i
[1:00:16] was alive and i was 16 years old in 1996
[1:00:19] brother
[1:00:20] when bill clinton the american president
[1:00:22] signed the defense of marriage act
[1:00:25] because all these homosexuals were
[1:00:27] crying out for marriage rights he denied
[1:00:29] them a democrat think about that a
[1:00:30] democrat denied the homosexuals in 1996
[1:00:35] i was 16 years old
[1:00:37] and then in 2015
[1:00:42] barack obama uh influenced the supreme
[1:00:44] court to rule for homosexual marriage
[1:00:48] so just in my lifetime
[1:00:50] i've seen uh
[1:00:52] i've seen both sides you know you can
[1:00:54] think of how fast this flood is coming
[1:00:57] when i was 16 everything seemed to be
[1:00:59] going good and with a matter of 15 19
[1:01:01] years
[1:01:03] it's completely the tide is completely
[1:01:05] turned
[1:01:07] they said they just wanted mayor's
[1:01:08] rights but now know it's trans rights
[1:01:10] now they want to get in our bathrooms
[1:01:12] amen
[1:01:13] because they're such filthy people
[1:01:16] right they didn't stop with marriage and
[1:01:19] now they're trying to get into our
[1:01:20] schools
[1:01:22] thank god we've got good schools around
[1:01:23] here by god's grace we have a pretty
[1:01:24] conservative area even if they told me
[1:01:26] to teach it i'd lie and say no
[1:01:28] i would not do it
[1:01:30] or maybe explain and teach it and show
[1:01:32] how it's wrong
[1:01:33] maybe i'll do that
[1:01:35] but i've never thank god i've never had
[1:01:36] to do that
[1:01:38] but look the bee system is coming in
[1:01:40] like a flood
[1:01:42] upon america and upon the whole world
[1:01:46] look what kovan did how it brought in
[1:01:47] all this fear
[1:01:48] we were at a meeting on the opening day
[1:01:50] of our of our uh school year
[1:01:53] and everybody's talking about how you
[1:01:54] know kids go through trauma and they say
[1:01:57] and they said this we've all gone
[1:01:58] through trauma because of cove
[1:02:02] that's not trauma
[1:02:03] i mean if you were sick
[1:02:05] you know and you almost died that's
[1:02:07] trauma
[1:02:08] but see the condition the beast says be
[1:02:11] afraid be afraid give up your rights uh
[1:02:13] take this shot you know take it uh take
[1:02:15] the vaccine and give up your rights and
[1:02:17] trust the government trust the word they
[1:02:19] don't know nothing they're lying
[1:02:22] and they call that trauma they're
[1:02:24] conditioning the people to give up their
[1:02:25] rights they're conditioning the people
[1:02:27] that they won't buy or sell without
[1:02:28] tomorrow they're moving them into the
[1:02:30] market beast but we're standing against
[1:02:32] the beast system the beast is coming in
[1:02:34] like a flood but god promised to raise
[1:02:36] up a standard race of a banner against
[1:02:38] that so god's people can rally with the
[1:02:41] true military general jesus christ amen
[1:02:45] hallelujah that's the scripture
[1:02:48] the beast system has never come in like
[1:02:50] a flood like it is right now
[1:02:51] that i can find
[1:02:53] because the bible said evil seducers
[1:02:55] will wax worse and worse it gets worse
[1:02:57] and worse in every generation
[1:02:59] did you ever think billy williams
[1:03:00] growing up you'd see things like we see
[1:03:01] today trans and all kinds of things like
[1:03:03] that i never thought we'd see that
[1:03:05] people with blue hair purple hair pink
[1:03:07] hair
[1:03:08] you i just never thought you see such
[1:03:10] things as this
[1:03:12] uh unbelievable
[1:03:13] the b system coming in like a flood
[1:03:16] like i said 19 years of my life from 16
[1:03:18] to whatever age i was in 2015 35
[1:03:22] 16 to 35 they did a complete opposite
[1:03:24] and it's pushing in but thank god
[1:03:26] there's a standard for us
[1:03:30] i'm not on the enemy side i'm not
[1:03:32] joining their flood i've got a standard
[1:03:34] i've got a place to stand by
[1:03:37] hallelujah
[1:03:40] i'm where the ruach is the wind of the
[1:03:42] holy spirit
[1:03:43] that's where i am amen that's where you
[1:03:45] are
[1:03:47] the ruach of the holy spirit
[1:03:50] here's a perfect example and this is
[1:03:52] during the tribulation
[1:03:54] revelation 12 is all about the jews
[1:03:56] remember the woman with the the son and
[1:03:58] the 12 stars it's all about the jews
[1:04:02] the bible says
[1:04:03] satan will cast a flood of some type of
[1:04:06] war
[1:04:07] during the tribulation period and look
[1:04:09] the enemy comes in like a flood to the
[1:04:11] jewish people who are under the blood of
[1:04:12] bulls and goats and what does god do god
[1:04:15] helps the woman
[1:04:18] a flood is coming in you have no way to
[1:04:20] stop the flood who's ever stopped the
[1:04:21] flood it's impossible they can put the
[1:04:23] sandbags brother they can do all that
[1:04:24] but it don't stop and praise god
[1:04:26] so israel has these a fun approach all
[1:04:29] they do is they stand glory all they do
[1:04:31] is stand on the commandments of god and
[1:04:33] the testimony of jesus christ and so god
[1:04:35] in his mercy says you can't stop it but
[1:04:37] i will i'll open up the earth and i'll
[1:04:40] swallow the blood because my spirit will
[1:04:42] raise up a standard against it amen amen
[1:04:46] glory hallelujah amen that's my god
[1:04:48] that's your general that's your savior
[1:04:51] praise god
[1:04:52] when it comes to like a flood the spirit
[1:04:54] of god will raise up a standard again
[1:04:57] amen oh hallelujah amen
[1:05:01] ah it's beautiful church oh my goodness
[1:05:03] how many times have things like it
[1:05:05] looks like in our lives it's gonna crush
[1:05:07] us and all of a sudden
[1:05:08] it's as if the earth opened up and all
[1:05:10] of our trials fall right down it's like
[1:05:11] they never were coming
[1:05:13] where'd they go
[1:05:14] where's all my haters where's that
[1:05:16] where's all my trials where's all my
[1:05:18] bills where's all these things it's all
[1:05:20] swallowed up
[1:05:22] because that's what god how are you
[1:05:24] doing that's what he uh masters it
[1:05:27] that's what he excels in doing the
[1:05:29] impossible
[1:05:32] waymaker
[1:05:34] miracle worker
[1:05:35] promise keeper amen
[1:05:38] wind in the darkness because the wind of
[1:05:39] the spirit in the darkness amen
[1:05:41] hallelujah
[1:05:43] so jesus christ stands for the jews who
[1:05:45] have the commandments of god the old
[1:05:47] testament and the testimony of jesus
[1:05:49] christ just like we got that's right
[1:05:50] amen just like we got
[1:05:53] amen
[1:05:54] i believe that old testament i've got
[1:05:55] the old testament wing i got the new
[1:05:57] testament wing i'm a flying eagle praise
[1:06:00] god
[1:06:01] i can mount up on 59 praise god i can
[1:06:04] mount up on revelation 10 7 amen i can
[1:06:07] nod on all these promises and fly above
[1:06:10] the criticism and god will come down and
[1:06:12] he'll stop the flood and he'll put me on
[1:06:15] a rock by his side hallelujah
[1:06:20] there's the last time there's only three
[1:06:22] times
[1:06:23] the last time the bible said lift up a
[1:06:25] standard
[1:06:27] go through go through the game
[1:06:37] make the past straight doesn't sound
[1:06:39] familiar like john the baptist doesn't
[1:06:41] sound like robert's ministry
[1:06:43] make straight the path the elijah
[1:06:45] ministry
[1:06:47] he said lift up a standard for the
[1:06:49] people
[1:06:50] get the gates ready
[1:06:53] and get the highway ready
[1:06:56] because god is going to gather his
[1:06:57] people
[1:06:58] at his standard
[1:07:02] make it already
[1:07:04] see how god always makes a way for your
[1:07:06] life church
[1:07:08] if god spiritually makes a way for you
[1:07:10] to stand by this standard
[1:07:12] i'm sorry and god naturally makes a way
[1:07:14] for israel how much more is going to
[1:07:16] make way for you spiritually
[1:07:17] to reach your destination
[1:07:21] he said take away the stones make sure
[1:07:23] brother jesse doesn't trip
[1:07:25] on the highway
[1:07:26] make sure the gates are open so i'm not
[1:07:28] locked out and i have trouble i have
[1:07:30] trouble getting into the promises of god
[1:07:31] amen
[1:07:33] make sure the gates of the highways
[1:07:35] everything there's no stone because god
[1:07:37] is gathering his people to stand with
[1:07:39] him god is rallying his people in one
[1:07:42] location in christ jesus praise god amen
[1:07:45] amen
[1:07:46] amen
[1:07:47] church in the hebrew standard means a
[1:07:49] rallying point
[1:07:53] lift up a standard
[1:07:55] this is when an army is about to march
[1:07:57] oh one of these days we're marching
[1:08:00] design
[1:08:02] where's on well these days we're
[1:08:03] marching up to the holy zion praise god
[1:08:05] i'm talking about heaven
[1:08:08] hey one day we're marching up there but
[1:08:10] god's got to gather everybody before the
[1:08:12] march
[1:08:14] that's called raising up a standard
[1:08:16] when you raise up a standard
[1:08:19] the bible said god collects
[1:08:21] all the people from all their different
[1:08:23] location and he restores them into their
[1:08:26] own land in their own place
[1:08:28] in order for this to happen a command
[1:08:30] must be given and then a banner must be
[1:08:33] reared up so we can all rally around the
[1:08:36] banner amen because we're going for a
[1:08:39] trip
[1:08:40] we're setting out on a battle praise god
[1:08:44] hallelujah praise god amen
[1:08:47] what's the next verse say behold the
[1:08:49] lord hath proclaimed unto the end of the
[1:08:51] world say to the daughter of god and
[1:08:53] behold thy salvation cometh
[1:08:56] behold his reward is with him and his
[1:08:58] work is before him
[1:09:02] so he's saying come gather around my
[1:09:03] standard my daughter of zion the bride
[1:09:07] the the woman the woman of jerusalem and
[1:09:10] we are the new jerusalem praise god
[1:09:15] see salvation deliverance comes
