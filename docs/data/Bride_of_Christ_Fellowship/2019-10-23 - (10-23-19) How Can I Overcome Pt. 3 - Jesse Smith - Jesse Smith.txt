God our desire to love you so you made a way that we could Lord God thank you for this amazing love knowing you is the greatest privilege on this earth that we have Lord God Lord it keeps us gives us the anchor Lord in the midst of the storm in the midst of the disappointments and trials of life but yet we know they're more precious than gold as we saw last Wednesday night Lord the trial of your faith more precious and gold dear God Alleluia and your prophet said as we saw last week the test is the best thing that ever happened to us Lord God MA what inspired words Lord God just anchors tonight Lord a little deeper in your word a little deeper in your love Lord God ministered every need Lord through your word bless this word as I attempt to preach it I know I can't do it I need your help here through the saints Lord and let me hear as well Lord let faith come by hearing hearing by the Word of God that your Holy Ghost have preeminence here Lord bless this reading of thy word and bless each and every heart in Jesus Christ name Amen amen let's say I take our Bibles here tonight by God's grace like to go to Hebrews chapter 10 I like to look at part 3 of how can I overcome so let's look at that tonight Hebrews 10 I'd like to go to verse let's start at verse 35 [Music] Hebrews 10:35 my main Scripture was down to verse 39 but I just want to look at this idea of overcoming because the some of the examples we'll look at tonight but the Bram talks about missus lot and lot and lots daughters and in this sermon how can overcome so I like this this passage is really fitting because lot believed all the way till his soul was saved but mrs. Lott didn't believe long enough so let's go to the verse 35 Hebrews 10:35 cast not away therefore your confidence which has great recompense of reward that's the thing I needed a few months ago I need now again by God's grace amen verse 36 for you have need a patience that after you've done the will of God you might receive the promise for yet a little while and he that shall come will come and will not tarry glory now the just shall live by faith in faith is a revelation of the will of God but if any man draw back from that the confidence in God my soul shall have no pleasure in him we are not of them which draw back unto perdition or destruction but of them that believe all the way to the saving of the soul now go to Luke 17 this is a scripture milligram references Luke 17 I started verse 30 because that's a familiar scripture force how can I overcome let's look at again tonight by God's grace 17:30 that's all read that one because that's a very important scripture to us think about it Church most of the world can't see that the Son of Man has already come they can't even see it that a son a man has come to reveal the Son of Man and thank God that the Son of Man is still here praise God the Spirit of Jesus Christ is still here praise the Lord let's read verse 30 together one two three even thus shall it be in the day when the Son of Man is revealed now I'll read verse 31 and 32 in that day he which shall be upon the housetop and his stuff in the house let him not come down to take it away and he that is in the field let him likewise not returned back verse 32 remember Lot's wife so let's have one more word of Prayer here if you ever need on your heart just make it unto God Heavenly Father we love you Lord God again we're grateful for your word your revelation we always want to believe Lord we always want to keep the faith we don't want to cast away our confidence or strengthen our confidence tonight in your word and your ways Lord let us with patience possess our souls Lord God thank you for your loving kindness it's better than life to your God so father bless this reading of our Lord and break the word of God to our hearts may be like bread for our souls Lord to feed our hungry souls and we're so thankful for your message Lord God you're sending your prophet and Lord that the Spirit of Christ the Son of man is still here today thank you lord encourage us strengthen us tonight in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless you be in seated praise God praise God you know I just got thinking of you know brother Samson and his family and I thought my how uncertain life is at times you know I just got it was just a burden for him and and I think of that people that have lived longer than him you know they're still alive that are older than him and I just thought my god just gives each person a certain number of days and we got to redeem the time praise God we got to be grateful for the time that we have we got to redeem all the time and make sure that we're always ready to meet the Lord praise God praise God I'd like to look at how can I overcome we've been looking at this the last few weeks here this is part three here now in our scripture here we see quite an overlap of prophecy because it overlaps our day as and it likens it unto the days of Noah and then as the days of a lot and then the Bible said it must be like this in the time when the Son of Man is revealed and we know the Son of man went to the Jews through Christ and the Samaritans in John chapter four but it never went to the Gentiles until our day and now the Son of Man has been revealed in a day when it's like the days of Noah and the days of son of man praise God now think about that think about how God Terri church Noah might have preached 120 years look how God tarry during that whole time and the age just kept getting worse and worse and worse but from the the days that Noah started ministering and preaching the word it was the days of Noah that whole time was it not and that's how it is today in the days of the voice of the seventh angel praise God in this days of where his message is still sounding it's still like the days of Noah still like the days of Sodom but thank God that the spirit of the son of man is here amen Jesus Christ spirit is still here still calling people to repent it's still calling people trying to get them in the ark of Christ for safety praise God and we're so thankful for that hallelujah hallelujah and it's a great overlap of the anointings of today the great evil anointing and brother I heard brother BAM say it and how can I overcome this morning I was listening to it or this afternoon rather brother BAM said this day is just getting gradually more deceptive and more deceptive each and every day he says getting worse and worse because it's more deceptive as we said on last week the enemy now comes in the name of Christianity right it comes to the name of the church and each day it gradually gets worse and worse it's kind like that illustration you've heard about a bog in boiling water right the Frog will sit there he just turned it up one degree at a time the frog will just sit there and then pretty soon it'll die when it's boiling because it just it's so gradual right the sin is so gradual right it just gets so as 1 degree worse one degree worse and that's what brother Bay I'm liking it unto he said first you know first he you know in the churches let's say in the days of brother Branham the first thing they did this they just started letting cut their hair a little bit right and wear short skirts a little bit and then they start letting them smoke cigarettes a little bit and they could still be church members right and then they could still sing in the choir right and then uh like I said like this so like the grandmas in the grandmas day we say like this and the grandmas day they cut their hair but they still have long dresses on well their daughters are they letting them cut their hair but then the skirts rose up and the next generation you got short skirts short hair next generation they're wearing pants the next generation they start showing off their chests next generation they start wearing even less and looking and now fast forward to today generation look what they wear now but slowly it was just one degree at a time right one one year at a time they just said it was so gradual now they don't even realize that they're spiritually so far back sidin don't even realize the insanity the age at that we're living in right they don't realize it but we see it and we got to make sure our eyes don't get desensitized to the evil but around said the closer you get to the light the more wicked it looks though this world and we got to say God God we got to press into the light of God amen we got to look full in his wonderful face make sure we're looking in the light of God so these things of the world they don't look okay but they look awful they look gradually worse and worse and worse and God's Word looks better and better amen but the message of God looks better and better all the time amen because it's holiness unto the Lord I'm just reading our scripture today let me uh yeah I didn't even plan to say this but let's go to Zechariah the last chapter I'm just reading this thought and is this a beautiful thought see the world's getting more unholy but church you and I got to get more holy don't we I was praying this morning and I was her money and I heard a preacher say one time he said he likes to wake up in the morning and he goes down to prayer and I even prayed us this morning but I like what he said he said Lord you know he confesses his sins and he says Lord I want to join I may have mentioned this before but he said I want to join the Angels because all the whole time I've been sleeping the Angels have been crying holy holy holy and I want to just wait now that I'm awake I'm gonna start joining those angels amen and cry holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty amen that the holiness of Christ remains real to us praise God well look at Zechariah the last chapter look at this now let me find the verse cuz like I said I didn't have this written out yeah now God promises he's going to restore worship now look at verse 16 this must be the the Millennium and it should come to pass that everyone that is left of all the nations which come up against Jerusalem shall even go up year to year to worship the king the Lord of hosts and to keep the Feast of Tabernacles now that makes it me think right there that some of the nations that gather against Israel and when Jesus smites them with the sword out of his mouth it makes me think that some of them are gonna survive that that's what it looks like here verse 17 it should come to pass that who so will not come up of all the families of the earth unto Jerusalem to worship the king the Lord of Hosts even upon them shall be no rain so this this is a striking picture of the Millennium verse 18 and if the family of Egypt go up not up and come not that have no rain there so there shall be the plague wherewith the Lord will smite the heathen that come not up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles this shall be the punishment of Egypt and the punishment of all nations that come down up to keep the Feast of Tabernacles in the in that day share there'll be a pond look the bells of the horses holiness unto the Lord so once this millennium sets in church for most of us know this my oh no we thought about this in the Old Testament only the priests had holiness to the Lord on them amen and it was something just it was just set aside for priests the holiness of God wasn't given to the common man it was just for a select few it was just for the priesthood natural but in the Millennium when Jesus comes back he brings such a such a judgment upon the people that not only did the priest not only to the King and priests have holiness but even the animals have holiness amen holiness has spread out just from God's presence and the believers and now it spread out to the entire earth amen and we will wake up we ought to say holy holy holy is the Lord God Almighty amen we ought to give God his glory let's finish the verse 20 and the pots in the Lord's house shall be like the bowls before the altar yay every pot in Jerusalem and in Judah shall be holiness in the Lord of Hosts my everything will speak of God's holiness and all they that set that sacrifice shall come and take of them and see therein and in that day there should be no more the Canaanite in the house of the Lord of Hosts amen so it speaks of a total cleansing a total holiness that will come upon the earth amen praise God I just thought I'd mention that I just read that this morning and that really struck me as inspired and not only do the priests have holiness but God's holiness will spread out to the entire world during the millennium amen where Jesus enjoys his his honeymoon thousand years of peace praise God now we read our text and now we looked at the examples we looked at Noah a couple of Sundays ago and we looked at last week looking at Daniel Wright and the three Hebrew children now brother branham's next overcomers was lot and his two daughters now by Ram starts by saying in the days of a lot Jesus referred to it there were only three that overcome lot and his two daughters not even his wife didn't overcome she started out as a type wish we had time she'd done all right she left so I want you to catch that there that he said she started out right but then she cuz she left she it was able to leave Sodom now brother man breaks into this thought and he goes directly to those in Jeffersonville that are listening he said many of you have left too many who left these things that take your stand after you searched it through the scripture and find it's right you seen the vindication of Almighty God not by some what somebody said was a vindication what the Bible said would be and here it is doing it you saw it was a truth so you set out to leave Sodom leave denominationally the things that bind you to a Creed and now look here's what he says you're following to follow Christ by the Holy Spirit vindicating himself by the written word amen so you and I are not following a creed we're not following a church tradition we're following the word that God has vindicated as his own word amen and see Church that's the reality the only reason people will turn away is because the word has it they haven't let it become a reality see when it becomes a reality to you and you love that reality more than you love the world then you'll follow Christ you'll follow the revealed Word all the days of your life because even even Judas had to admit that the word was being revealed he had to admit right because Peter said we all know and sure you're the son of God would you just was standing right there he never piped up and said I don't believe but see he loved money more they loved the revealed word amen we gotta love the reveal word more than we love money or fame or popularity or friendships or any relationship we gotta love the Word of God more than anything but Judas saw the word vindicated Balaam saw the word vindicated right they all saw vindicated Cain sought indicated but he didn't love it more than he loved the things of the world we've got to love the things of the world so that's what program says we're not finding Creed's were following Christ and the Holy Spirit as he vindicates his written word so in other words God has proven to you and I that this word is the right revelation of God brother William I've been to too many churches and I know that they don't have the vindicated written word amen because they love sin more than they love the word amen they love Hollywood more they love the Word of God God has vindicated that this word is right amen not only that but he's done healings and saved my soul and save different ones my family members came and and brother Tim Myers as we've been sharing the last few weeks he's vindicated me that this word is right and I got to choose now that I know it's vindicated I gotta choose use of the word or the world I'll take the word every time amen seven out of seven times amen program says in other words you took the Bible now you didn't say me he said you took the Bible instead of the Creed you set out to follow see that but I've never exalted himself and said you gotta follow me and obey all me now of course we do we follows Bible based teaching but we don't worship brother Branham like many do today he said Lot's wife did the same thing you know she set out to go with lot follow her husband her children her loved ones but it wasn't in her heart she still loved the world so it's possible you can make a star and still be and I'm trying still have the world in you she never overcome even though listen she was well on the road to overcoming wasn't she she was well on the road ma she was can we say like this she was a mile away from being from Oh being an overcomer I imagine she maybe walked up maybe a mile outside the city who knows how far it was but man said they had some proof of it but I've I've never studied enough to find it where the pillar of salt was still there I've never really looked to find it uh but who knows how far think about how far she made it out and then how close she was to be the over cover but it wasn't in her heart and that proves that we can take people very far we can take him as far as we can and I'll say like this brother William the Angels took him that far remember the Bible of the Angels dragging them out angels will take people so far in the message but if the love of God is not in their heart they're gonna turn crowd and long for the things of the world huh he said even though she was well on her road it finally over throat her she had to take one big long last look and that's where she got caught brother Ram screams and I said don't even look back he said don't have no desires keep going put your mind on Calvary and keep moving towards Christ I'd say if you ever have a mind battle think about the cross of Jesus Christ I think about that many times when I go through my battles I think of that scene from the passion movie now it's a Catholic movie but there are certain scenes of it that are very good and I think of Jesus and he's all torn up and and all the blood and I think of that I think and when I'm thinking about having my battles the mind battles fade away when I think about the bleeding Christ when I think about that bloody dying that precious Lamb shall never lose its power amen when I think of that the things of the world the temptations fade away because I think of the love of God that he would sacrifice his own son the Bible said he made his soul on a sacrifice and offering for sin for the joy that was set before and that joy was to save our souls amen and how can i how can i how can I accept sinful evil thoughts when I also I can think of as the cross of Calvary amen and think of how far God went to love me and forgive me how can I entertain evil thoughts when that when the thoughts of Christ are so real in our minds he said don't even look back don't have no desires put your mind on Calvary and keep moving towards Christ amen but man they look program goes into what happened here she started out as to overcome her but she never did overcome he said oh she left the denomination she did she walked out of Sodom with a lot but she wanted to go back and have her hair cut you know what I mean so you can in other words he means you can put any sin in there any worldly sin whether it's a man or woman right cuz you just turn around for money right doesn't matter what's in it is cut the hair beauty money whatever it is he says you know what I mean she had to go back she's just couldn't stand the test now look at her test her test with program says was her screaming dying friends and family members that was her test she had to hear that and endure that in other words she had to escape she had to love the the escape of God more than even family she had he said but she had to look back again to see what the rest of them was doing now look my man says what she was thinking you know had some good friends down there after all after all this might be just a little move I don't know whether it could be right or not look at that maybe maybe the fire hadn't fallen yet I never thought about that so see she was convinced well maybe maybe this message isn't exactly right maybe that's just a fanatical move look at this road man says he says I don't know whether it could be right or not I've only got this man's word for it though he's my husband so see her husband loved the Lord but she kind of said I'm just taking his experience for I've seen what God did in my husband's life and I'm just going to lean upon that so she was leaning on somebody else's experience more than her own and each of us each of us need to have a burning bush experience amen where you meet God for yourself praise God and God Commission's you and gives you a purpose in life gives you a ministry and you've got to be faithful with it but her test was to leave those things he says she said I don't know whether it could be right or not I've only got my husband's word for but man said your pastor is your husband spiritually speaking which means I just preached the word to you it doesn't mean i lord over you like some preachers do well you can't go here you can't go there you know I you need to dress like this or you need to brush your teeth like this so yeah you need to tie your shoes like this or you know I'll give you my wisdom on it look horse I'll give you my mom things like somebody sent me a message this week and they said oh I was reading your book oh yeah somebody got my book and read it and they said they loved it but they had two questions what about beards and what about women wearing flip-flops to church I said I said he said why didn't you cover that your book I said well I never thought about it I never really have those problems you like some churches back battle so I said for beers I said there's only two scriptures the Old Testament that really talked about it and it's mostly for the priests I said but you never see Paul riding anything about beers to New Testament Gentiles so I said it's just the area of Liberty I said to me it doesn't bother but I said if I the choice I'm gonna follow brother Graham's example he didn't he shaved his face I'm gonna that's why I always shave my face if you see me have a beard just cuz I'm too tired to shave it you know but I read it really can't even grow beard but I'm not sure sure how I got here anyway my goodness what the the flip-flop thing was I said well it don't really bother me at the if sisters wear flip-flops are you my own children as long as they're not noisy because the women and Isaiah three had tinkling of their feet you know of course they probably had long I don't like a high-heeled thing you know or but in other words like it makes too much noise like it's distracting or something like that but I don't care if they show their toe I don't even look at your toes I don't even know what your toes are I'm not looking at that I'm looking at as your heart hungry for God amen and of course the high heels well we should know better than that you know we I bet videos on that if you want to watch that it ruins your body not only that but it ruins your faith you know it props up their body like a sexual temptation and he said he said so he said I really like your response that's what I thought you'd say I thought well I thought you were trying to test me so he was expecting me to say that but see there's these areas where pastors your husband as far as he's gonna give you the word he's trying to lead you to Christ amen but she said well I don't I don't know whether it could be right or not I don't know maybe his revelation wasn't right I want to bring this thought out where is about friends he says oh I've got some real good friends out there you know when I was talking to Austin on the phone a few weeks ago he was telling me about I also got to do is lose him for a few friends and I said brother Austin let me tell you the friends that I left for this message turned out not even to be friends because you know what most of them most of them had a demon on them none of them are saying hey come smoke cigarettes or come commit adultery or or come do drugs with me or come you know do cocaine nothin we're saying that what they're trying to do is get me to compromise that their churches were just as good as ours but that's not true because our church has the true atonement the blood of Jesus Christ amen and it's not that we're better but what I mean is we have a more powerful work we have a more sure word of prophecy amen we've got in other words we got the revelation the hour and those religious demons are gonna try to get you to compromise and stay in churches like that and you know I've watched their lives too you know one of my friends he's the one that told me this my best friend he said the water baptism was of the double he showed me that and brother at William I went on Facebook a few years ago and for Halloween he dresses up for Halloween claims to be all religious and wore a Halloween of a Native American you know how they barely had any clothes on and exposes his behind because they did that so he's almost basically naked and the one and Susy to me that's like a fruit of that spirit that religious demon that was coming against our revelation I said no I said turn that down and so see that's not a real friend any friend that would take you away from the Word of God it's not a friend amen but missus look back another what for what friends I got oh yeah the same friends that think it's okay to commit homosexuality the same friends and it's okay to smoke and drink and cuss and worship sports and then go to church and and believe in a sprinklin instead of the real water baptism of the Bible those aren't friends Jesus Christ is a friend that sticks closer than a brother amen and he's the Lord hallelujah so I told him brother Austin I said look those people all those that said they were my friends they're not my friends I'm losing a little bit of Court here and I need that extra six inches of cord air there we go so I can get it let me see if I can get out here glory here we go amen thank the Lord so you children or anyone that's wonders about friends only the only true friend there are is a word friend and let me say like this a word family member too rather we're but we're more family than some of my own natural family because we agree on the word right I got a lot of in-laws and I got a lot of cousins and aunts and uncles but actually you and I are more family than we I am with them amen that's right because we're under the same blood we got the same blood flowing through our veins now not natural spiritual but we're bought by the precious blood of Jesus amen that's why I'm here with you guys and sitting with my natural family amen so I've got a no doubt I mean part of me wants to go back to my natural family but see Jesus has called me to be a part of this spiritual family amen to strengthen the Saints to edify them to preach God's Word amen hallelujah feed God's sheep hallelujah so I was telling our brother the Bible said a friend sticks close to the brother when I left those friends and came the message none of them stuck they all they all abandoned me but now I come to message my real friends stick with me even in the hard times right now they care they won't know how you doing brother Jesse how you doing are you need any prayer those are the real kind of friends amen hallelujah so see mrs. lot got all confused her real friends were the ones out here that one to leave that place right her two daughters and and her husband those were real friends but she got caught up when to go back to her old friends that's what brother mam said he said oh I had some good friends down there we had some great times really those were great times the Bible said that lot soul was vexed every day by all the evil things he saw all the all the gang the gang mobs and and then the homosexuality prevalent and the mixed marriages and sorry the homosexual marriages that's why I'm talking about it was vex mind every day and she missed that she missed the torment so that means she didn't she wasn't tormented she enjoyed it because lot it's so tormented him he could he could keep us back from it he knew it was a torment but to her it wasn't much of a torment because she loved the things that were there she most overcame and Jesus said remember that person Amen who almost overcame remember that one because the fact that you're in church tonight you're on your road overcoming thank God for that but remember Lot's wife that we don't miss the world we don't miss some friends we don't miss anything he said have no desires put your mind on Calvary and keep moving towards Christ amen so see she never had her own experience she was just taking her husband or her pastors were brothers just taking her pastor's word for it the RAM said see if you're not perfectly satisfied you're not perfectly know that it's the Word of God then you can't go you gotta be really sold out you've got to know not just say well I see others doing it I see a sign so you got to know for yourself well Ram said missus lot was like Israel that left Egypt for the Promised Land he said they taught started out two million strong and ended up with only two men they saw the works of God they saw the manifestation the Holy Spirit they saw a great and mighty miracles being done in Egypt and everything and started out but it wasn't in their heart they didn't overcome they just came out and jesus said they perish in the wilderness amen every one of them died he said every one of them rotted in the wilderness cuz overcoming wasn't really in their hearts so see Church we got a great a great reminder here that overcoming is keeping the revelation until you die amen it's keeping it through death amen not just up to death but all the way through death amen be thou faithful unto death the Bible says amen not just till you die but unto it to whatever life hold whatever God's will holds for you you're faithful all the way to the end no man said there was only to overcomers Joshua and Caleb Knox we know Miriam was saved and Aaron and Moses was saved he says but there's only two overcomers when it came to the showdown and the obstacles look so great so they look like grasshoppers and Joshua screamed not with Caleb can you imagine there's only two of them they're side-by-side they screamed now he says we're more than able to do it so overcomers will scream out today we're more than able to take a rapture amen we're more than able to overcome Laodicea everybody else how can we do it we can't have more kids because like some people told me we can't have more kids because they won't overcome their to see you and somebody else don't mean I couldn't marry a husband or wife because of Laodicea come on we're more than conquerors I don't care how big the Giant is we've got Jesus Christ on our side amen we're giant Slayers cuz we got the Word of God amen hallelujah tell me they're scared to have marriage isn't scared to have children because of laodicea I don't fear no Goliath because I've got Jesus Christ on my side amen and you shouldn't be scared either do we respect of course yes we respect it we wait upon the Lord we wait for the leadership of the Lord but we do not fear because the spirit of fear wasn't given to us st. might have put our name on it but that package doesn't belong to us amen the promises of God belong to us the sharp short the double-edged sword of the word belongs to us amen hallelujah he said they were the overcomers they were the ones that was privileged out of the whole gray organization of people to take the real elected bride into the promised land Joshua and Caleb in the front lines out there as two generals led them down to the river and cross the river over in the promise and why they believed the word no matter what amen a church how do they believe it numbers 14 tells us number 14 numbers 14 23 if you want to pull it up there acacia how did he do it how did Caleb do it how did Joshua do it the Bible tells us how do they overcome numbers 14 23 surely they shall not see the land which I swear unto their fathers neither shall any of them that provoke me see it numbers 14 24 here it is but my servant Caleb because he hath an over her spirit with him amen and I followed me fully amen see we've got to have a different spirit praise God the only way to overcome is to have the holy spirit praise God because he's the real overcomer praise God we just yield our will to him and then he works his will inside of us amen how can I be an overcomer with these great giants and how can I be overcome or make the promised land have a real spirit of Christ in you amen him will I bring into the land wherewith he went and his seed shall possess it hallelujah praise God now the next example program gives he still the same example of missus lot and then now he says it's the same thing she started out but turn back just like Israel started out but many of them turned back and he says day 'then raised up and so did cora they tried to say this man is trying to make himself above all the rest of us he's more holy than the rest of the remember that days that in coral raised up and said oh we're just as holy as you guys what do you think you're so great remember what did Moses and Aaron do when a boxing match we're to punch him out know the Bible said they went and interceded for them they ran the presence of God they ran in their prayer life amen they ran to their prayer life and say God have mercy on them Moses was saying something like this I don't have the exact quote he was saying do you think I'd call myself to this do you think God volunteered for this it's God that sent me praise God and each one of us had we should be able to say that do you think we volunteered for this as far as that we knew all the battles God called us to this word God called us to the message God called us to living this time and we're overcomers amen we're doing this by the leadership of God not the leadership of man he said after God had thoroughly vindicated the man they said we'll just start a group of people and we'll make this or that or the other we'll make our organizations and they died and perished now since brother I mentioned Korah I'm gonna bring up this quote I read earlier about Korah from the church age book brother Ram said the Korah he said call the men of today the the core men's today said our businessman and I preach this when we looked at the Jefferson Mill Doctrine I don't know if you remember this code or not it's from chapter 4 the smyrnaean church age program said they the businessmen have styled themselves the fishers of men and the founders of a move of God and they say the gifted ministry of Ephesians 4 10 to 13 that God gave the church has failed so they're taken over so Motorama identifies Korah and Dathan for today they're businessmen that are taken over the pulpits and saying that preachers have failed he said they're they called the gain sayings of tokura and they don't even know that they fulfilled it so that's how we recognize who the chorus are today they're the ones saying the fivefold ministries failed and so they need to lead us you know what's interesting I got a text this week and so did some of the brothers so I'm sure some of you know what I'm talking about if you're not sure you can ask me afterwards I got a text this week that said it was it was mocking the fivefold ministry and it was mocking that the fact that we believed that when the rapture happens these bodies will be swallowed up and will go to meet Christ in the air literally how many believe we're gonna literally meet Christ in the air well we are mocked Church were mocked because we believe we're gonna meet in the literal air we are mocked and so someone said the brothers attacks this week mocking us for believing that and so this person said that what that one that if this happens all the other message preachers that believe this will drop their clothes and be naked now the Calico look how perverted this mind is now they don't even realize that when they drop the clothes don't he realized that we get a brand-new body when that happens we get our theophanies amen how do you amen and whoever said God's gonna leave the clothes he might just banish them all up you might descend to grade them all up who said that so this spirit is now mocking the fivefold ministry and saying uh-oh so the message preachers when they get raptured they're gonna have no clothes and so this person said why don't fly up there and buy these suits off Amazon and and go clothe them with that now what a bunch of nonsense is that now what kind of a what kind of a a Backson in mind would even like to imagine that we see their attack in the fivefold ministry that's a chorus pierre --it that's a de 'then spirit that's a businessman spirit that's not the Spirit of Christ because Jesus he after he ascended he said the best thing I can send the church is five gifts of the Holy Spirit to unify the faith of the saints amen so I just thought I'd share that any of that we still get attacked I still get mocked and made fun of like that all because I believe that we're gonna have a meeting in the air amen and I've got quotes on it but I said I read it to you last week might be said our bones will rise and go to meet Christ in the air he said we will rise to meet Christ in the air he said between the heavens and earth we'll meet him in the air hallelujah just like Isaac wasn't in the tent and he wasn't out there he was in the field he was in the between part and that's where we meet Christ in the air in that between part in the air amen that's right but see people can still mock preachers and make fun of them that's fine they can do that if they want but it's a core move the core move says that the fivefold ministries failed and that's what Caleb and Joshua overcame we praise God we'll overcome that corn Dathan movement hallelujah just got to say with the word God will vindicate which group is on his side hallelujah now Brennan says see those men had the word of the Lord came and Joshua and they stayed with it and they went over but man says it's not he that starts it's he that finishes many start the race but there's one finishing it though me many churches start many groups of people there'll be only one group finish that's the overcomers in lots they yes she had that one great long look back oh I'm leaving so-and-so down there then fine times we used to have I never forget it can you imagine me in a blood bought blood wash Holy Ghost filled Saint having the righteousness of Christ and then long for the Irishman I wish I could just go back to those days in the bar I wish I could go just go back and have one more cigarette no not a real Holy Ghost field st. hey amen but that's what mrs. Lott was doing oh I'll never forget what great times we had any time you had that that mocked Christianity any time you had that exalted the the sin of the world or lust of the flesh it wasn't a good time it was a bad time and we thank God for the holy times that we have in Christ Jesus oh I'll never forget it those old fine times we used to have and she was caught she was shut out like in the days of Noah she was shut out without mercy and she perished enough isn't that amazing Church Peter said that lot had a righteous soul so that means mrs. Lott soul was unrighteous she didn't really believe she didn't really believe the Word of God so lot was righteous like yeah that's really evil I'm gonna overcome this age I'm gonna armor I'm gonna do what's right but she her soul wasn't like that she's like well I guess I'll just follow him he's my husband you know God had me to marry him I guess I'll just stay with him but she really have the revelation herself but he was a righteous man in other words he did what was right he didn't leave that lived the same life Abraham did but he'd lived a righteous life see Jesus is referring to missus lot and he says not to come down to take your things away I was looking at some history the houses in those days were so close together that if somebody was on the roof they could just jump from like house to house I guess some of them were so close and they could keep going until they could get you know to the last house where I had a stairs they could go down but Jesus saying you wouldn't want to go down your own into your own house cuz you might be tempted to grab things it would slow you down in other words Jesus saying don't let anything slow you down missus lot let something slower down in other words when we come to Christ we got to give all of our effort to make momentum in our Christian journey amen not to stop and slow down got to keep memorizing the Bible we got to keep believing the Word of God we got to keep praying we got to keep the momentum going forward amen don't know don't give yourself any opportunity see don't go down in your own house because you might want to take this and this and that and they'll slow you down that's what Jesus says don't even come down that take it away he says in other words we ought to be happy just getting our soul saved because church you and I've been to enough funerals those people don't take those fancy suits with them they don't take those rings with them their body stays there their balloons stay there they're flowers stay there they go down the grave the only thing we're taking with us is our godly character our righteous Souls amen praise God don't even worry about that he said and then Jesus says not to return back he gives two illustrations don't come down and take it away and then not return back because she would because perhaps she wanted to go back and get her stuff remember brother man said said she was always buying brand new dresses member Graham said that he said Sarah was all kind of upset you know because she was they had a little drought and they were they were out there in the wilderness but he said mrs. Locke got all the new dresses and she had all her fine stitching and sewing and really gossiping parties that's what she had her gossiping in her Entertainment Weekly and her her Hollywood weekly news parties ma but she loved that she wanted to go back to that more than she wanted to escape judgment because she loved that more ssin than she loved the Word of God I thank the Lord Wow I got five minutes because I set my clock for 45 minutes I think I'll do that too I think I'll do that in the in the sake of of this thought this is where I thought I would finish so let me uh we try to finish here now I want to flip back to Luke 17 real quick to make sure I get those two those two illustrations Jesus gives ya ones on the housetop and then he that's in the field let him not like wise not return back so if you're out if you're caught out in the field you want to return back to your house and get a few things before you escape judgment right that's what Jesus said the temptation would be ones on the housetop you don't want to go down to your house the other ones you're out in the field oh I'm at work I better run home real quick and get my wallet so I don't miss so I might need the money and Jesus saying don't let any temptation slow you down from over coming amen that's the reality of a praise God don't let any worldly thing tempt you that slows down your spiritual progress in other words I'll say like this cuz you've seen it too don't let anything hinder your church attendance don't let anything hinder you're giving up tithes and offerings don't let anything hinder your prayers for the sick whatever God's called you to do don't let anything slow you down keep all the Word of God amen keep your prayer life strong your Bible reading you're witnessing you're testifying today I before I had the dentist's appointment today before I went to the dentist I just closed my eyes and I picked up three about three of my books and I said Lord Jesus you know I want to give these away every day some days I forget please God just open up the door so I can give these out I just wanted a witness to somebody it's been too long since I witness to somebody and so I went to the dentist I'm just sitting there in the chair and the persons cleaning my teeth and all of a sudden she starts saying mine I just wish things were like the 1950s I wish we could go back to the 50s and I like the way this directions go and I said I wrote a book I wrote a book and I went decade by decade talk about the 1950s and but before she said that she said my husband I talk and we wish we could pinpoint where it all went wrong and I said well I just wrote a book that showed what what went wrong each decade a man I said I think anyone she said I'll buy I said I'll give you three free and she's she jumped like I said really I'd be happy to take him amen I think the Lord he answered my little prayer there cuz I just wanted to testify to somebody amen and she said let me give you some money I said no this is my love gift for Jesus Christ all I do want to do is serve Jesus Christ like Abraham I don't want anybody say they made me rich amen praise God I like to give it out and as much as I can't I appreciate the people that support it you know I'm by it but I pray and I said God let me pass at all three and I pass out all three by God's grace amen so you don't take nothing no don't return back to your house don't go down into your house so see so is he mrs. Lapp must have been missing the things from her home and don't get me wrong you want a good home but you don't want sinful things in your home that attract you to the world more they point you to Christ praise God that's why I don't have Netflix in my house that's why I don't have the ESPN paid subscription that's why I don't have the NBA or the NFL paid prescription because that'd be too much of a temptation praise God and I want my house to be a place a sanctuary a sweet sanctuary where the Prince of God can come and dwell amongst us praise God where the children can feel God's presence and Malachi can get on the piano and Lydia can get on the piano and we just start praise to the Lord and worshiping God and we can pray lift our hands and dance and honor the Lord because God's presence is welcome in our home amen glory let me close with this cuz I got one minute and then I got my 45 minute mark I just want to close with this story has been a blessing tonight church praise God we must never look back have no desire to look back to overcome we got to believe unto the saving of our souls oh that's what overcomers do well let me close with this cuz this was uh I think I told you a little bit about this but I'm gonna tell you the whole story tonight so maybe it'll be five more minutes this summer a dear friend of I should say close friend but a dear brother in the message passed away and I went to his funeral I didn't preach or anything but his name was Mike durdle maybe I got a picture here yeah I think I got one you're a Casey can you switch over here let me see help me Lord if I could find it I'd really like that I know it's on here somewhere I just got to be patient well maybe I deleted it I wanted to show this up a little picture I got on my friend like dirt oh okay well maybe I don't have it I'm sorry I thought I would have it here my goodness I really wanted to show that to the saints oh yeah I do have it okay can you switch over so this is a picture from 2004 Lydia was born that's that voice of God recordings that's your pastor there before you had glasses brother Craig is now a pastor and Bertie moved to as a Maine or Connecticut Connecticut for the Jonah brother gift memories me good brother so this brother Mike he's one of passed away this summer so let me tell you just a close of this testimony because it relates to Sodom and lot now when I first come the message I all I knew about brother Mike was that he was from the Mansfield area and he was single and he lived in the house kind of next to the church and he was retired he had a factory job and he'd retired that's about all that I I knew about him but a couple years ago they had meetings in Lima Ohio and some big name preachers were there so my wife and I took the family over there and we stayed for the whole weekend that's where we met brother Kevin and sister Marie and after that they came started coming to our church because they were looking for a home church that's where we met them is that that same weekend well that weekend I was there and and on the Sunday morning service I think brother Mike came up to me he said hey if you have anybody to fellowship with I sure like to talk with you after I'd like to invite you over to my house and come fellowship I said okay brother I'll do that so the service went on and after sir after service in fact it was him yeah brother Greg come up and said hey you want to go out to lunch with me and all the preachers brother William it was kind of a mind battle because there was some of the preachers that I that really our famous in a good way because they love the Lord and I really want to meet these brothers and I had a real mind battle like mmm I go with the preachers I'd like to meet these brothers cuz I've listened to him my whole my whole message life and it was hard it was hard but I said you know what brother Craig I said I can't do that brother Mike asked me to go over to his house and so I went over to his house we just ordered some you know chicken or something like that so he sat down in his living room and he was a you know he was single and right you know we just got talking I said brother Mike tell me your testimony he said well there's not much to tell you know he was so humble but he said brother Jesse I'm gonna tell you he said before the message I was a ranked sinner he said I was a homosexual and that's why this testimony relates to today because remember Lot's wife and the sodomite condition of that day he said well Jesse I'm ashamed and now he's passed on oh that's why I feel I don't I don't think he'd mind if I shared it he said I was a homosexual and church when we went to his uh we went to his funeral this summer all of his family members that they were standing up and saying the things he used to do before he came to the message they were saying oh we had such a good time going to the Ohio State Buckeye games they said oh they're crying no oh I just I miss going to the cedar point with him I miss going to the game here and I miss going to do all these worldly things just worldly things and then all the saints are they're rejoicing like crying because they know that he came out of all those things amen glory and you know what they noticed that's the money was he was a homosexual someone walked up to him I don't know who was and handed him one of those cards that said did you know God sent a prophet it was a really tiny car he said I didn't know that he wrote a physical letter to voice of God and said can I have some sermon books because it says write us if you want some sermon books he started reading the books he had no idea where Adam was and he came to believe that brother Brandon was a prophet of God hey man and so he called voice of God and said where's the nearest church so he drive two hours every Sunday from Mansfield to Lima and through the preaching of the word he left Sodom and Gomorrha Amen can I say like that how do you see he had a vindication that this word was right amen he saw the word said what it did so he left the Sodom by the power of the word of God and he lived the rest of his life without a wife without anything in complete dedication to the Lord Jesus Christ and how many testimonies you know like that I'll tell you like that he was more than a lot because he come out he is kind of like this it's kinda like he came out of Sodom but then he went to join Abraham's camp Amen because he lives the last few decades of his life in complete obedience to the Lord and I got to sit there instead of sitting with the preachers and how did I know by the way him this would be the last time I really got the fellowship with him before he passed I got to sit there and hear his testimony about the card and about how he left all the things of the world and he started to being devoted to the church at his funeral Church I found out that brother Mike was the doorkeeper to the house of God Amen he was the one sister Beatrice that opened and unlocked the door every service and now that every Bible study and he was the one that closed it the pastor's testified and said every time I I want him to just go home he said no it's my posted duty to do it Amen glory and that reminds of the scripture where the David said I'd rather be a doorkeeper in the house of God than to be a sinner in the tents of the wicked hallelujah and that's a real-life example right there of a man that turned he left turned and left Sodom and he never looked back Amen he found his joy in the house of the Lord amen he served God all the days of his life let me say one of the best friends his best friend who they would go out to eat every night because they're both bachelors so they didn't have any you know family you know the guy they're so waiting for God to send him a wife or he testified that they went on numerous vacations in order to see you know weddings or message message conventions he said one time they're just walking through the mall and his friend said oh that looks like a nice suit and he didn't think anything about it and brother Mike's like hey let's go in there to see how much it cost and he asked the guys like oh it's way too much and Mike's like oh just get it sized up and he's like well ok you know Mike's was trying to get him to try to get the right size and the guy's like okay well I tried out I'm gonna go and Mike's like no I just went and paid for it he bought him a suit right there on the spot right like that he was so generous with his time and his money brother Mike sang song specials often he'd always seen the same same songs and he would get real loud and shout in the spirit in fact he got healed that last that's one times I went there I prayed for him and he said God touched him that's try I forgot about that amen he testified it I preached out of Saturday night camp preach on a Sunday morning and he testified on Sunday morning that God healed him when I prayed for thank the Lord amen but he would always sing the song special he said and when he would leave he'd say I love you Saints god bless you see because that was his only family amen that was his real family his other family knew him as a Buckeye Cedar Point homosexual lovin kind of man but he left that he turned that he got a new heart a new spirit and God's Spirit amen and to him the church was his family praise God because he had nobody else he forsook him he moved away from the his natural family from Mansfield and he came to live and church he lived right next door to the church that's how much that man loved the Lord Damon that's how much he hated Sodom that's how much he loved Abraham's camp amen he was a friend of Abraham a son of Abraham he loved his supposed to duty so much so that on a couple of a K shion's his best friend told me that he so you tried to talk him he said it was it was a it was a Sunday yeah he said it was a Sunday and they landed in Columbus Ohio and he's like hey let's stay over til Monday and Tuesday and and let's let's stay here and let's let's just let's just go look at sites around Columbus and brother Mike he had somebody to cover his job for Sunday but he didn't have anybody to cover it for Monday so he said no we're gonna end our vacation now on Sunday because I have to open the church on Monday night for Bible study hey man see his word he kept his word he said I'll come have somebody cover me Sunday but I gotta be back Monday so he turned out even vacation and fun and relaxation in order to be asked post of duty and don't you and I do the same thing amen it's our joy instead of law it's the joy to do the house of God amen it's a joy to be in God's house and as a vindication of his love for the house of God he died in the house of God the night he died it was July Oh says July 3rd this year he passed out and died right there in the church he just opened the church he was the first one there he was in them he was in the the book room there the tape room and one of the sisters came in and found him right there and she said and she said I'm calling 911 he's like no no it's my time to go it's my time to go but she called anyway and he died in the house of the Lord praise God right where he wanted to be praise God now what a soldier the cross praise God let's stand to our feet here I just thought I with that testimony I know I don't think I ever told you the full testimony but there's a man who left Sodom and he come and he saw the revelation of the Son of Man ha ha hey man praise God and he knew this word is right this word was vindicated to him I wonder how many miracles he saw praise God I know God here in him one time when we prayed for him see he had to love the things of God more and he

believe Lord my just humble thought I believe you'll use him against all this Sodom generation as proof that a man can be a part of it and leave that and crucify the lusts of the flesh and the pride of life and the lust of the eyes and be a real overcomer by receiving the overcomer be son a man in his heart the spirit of Jesus Christ thank you lord just like I believe you use mike.mccluskey as a testimony of forgiveness being shot by a cop but able to go on public TV and forgive him through the power of the King James Bible and the revelation of repentance through the message of the hour
