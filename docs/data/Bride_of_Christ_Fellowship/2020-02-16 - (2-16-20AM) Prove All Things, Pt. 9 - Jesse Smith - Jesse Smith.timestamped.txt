[34:39] been looking at 1st Thessalonians 5
[34:45] twenty-one like to look at prove all
[35:07] things part nine and let's just read
[35:10] verse 21 first that's ones 521 on three
[35:14] one two three
[35:16] prove all things hold fast that which is
[35:19] good let's have one more word of Prayer
[35:21] you ever need on your heart just make a
[35:23] note unto the Lord Heavenly Father Lord
[35:25] I raised my hands Lord God because I
[35:27] need you I'm a needy creature and the
[35:29] Lord I know you're a fountain that
[35:31] overflows Lord God and you're a river of
[35:33] life I've been down to that River and
[35:35] now I have this living water so lord I
[35:38] just come Lord to worship you and to
[35:40] obey your word father and Lord draw nigh
[35:43] to you I draw not for this fellowship
[35:44] we're taught Lord we're to feed our
[35:46] souls on the word of God and our soul
[35:49] can only feed on the word of God we
[35:51] never want to hush this holy hunger
[35:53] this holy thirst and so father we obey
[35:56] that that command Lord God to come to
[35:59] the house of God more as we see that day
[36:01] approaching that we might Lord quench
[36:05] this thirst of our souls for fellowship
[36:07] with you as we even read here this
[36:09] morning dear God
[36:10] so father just feed our souls your word
[36:12] Lord God Lord and I just pray God the
[36:15] Holy Spirit would have more preeminence
[36:17] in our lives nor we do our part Lord God
[36:19] to make ourselves ready we know Lord
[36:21] you're directing all things father help
[36:23] us Lord to surrender in every area of
[36:26] our life and you might be glorified that
[36:28] we might live by every word that
[36:30] proceeds out of the mouth of God bless
[36:32] us now in your divine presence in Jesus
[36:34] Christ's name the church said Amen god
[36:37] bless you mean seated praise God by
[36:45] God's grace
[36:45] to look at part 9 of this prove all
[36:48] things and unless something changes this
[36:52] will probably the last sermon I preached
[36:54] on this subject just because I put hours
[36:56] and hours into it and it's it's just
[36:58] just exhausting it's just exhausting and
[37:02] I think now I've covered the main things
[37:04] I'm settled in my heart about these
[37:07] things and I'll share the remainder of
[37:09] this today it is a live one today I
[37:11] didn't close this one off because I
[37:14] shared most of the personal testimonies
[37:16] or personal I should say interactions
[37:20] and names you know the last time we
[37:22] looked at proving all things and so I
[37:24] Lord willing I think I'll just finish
[37:26] off today but if you have any questions
[37:29] and you like me to preach another
[37:30] message forward your question I'll be
[37:32] happy to do that we can have a questions
[37:34] and answers or we can look at it again
[37:36] but I've been settled as I've looked at
[37:37] it this week I've just got more and more
[37:39] settled on it I feel like I know where I
[37:41] stand I feel like I have good answers
[37:43] that make a lot of sense that are
[37:45] scriptural and so you can switch over I
[37:49] do have quotes I want to look at the
[37:50] remainder of the prophecies that were
[37:52] spoken in the name of the Lord and as I
[37:56] showed you a few weeks ago most of the
[37:58] problems believe the sign has with
[38:01] brother Branham most of them are not
[38:03] problems that are thus saith the Lord
[38:05] they're just maybe accusations or that
[38:10] that are just brother branham's opinion
[38:13] and their hope they're open to having
[38:15] their opinion and they're allowed to
[38:17] have their opinion so but I find that as
[38:21] far as with prophecies I feel like I'm
[38:24] settled and I feel like I just want to
[38:27] move on to other subjects by God's grace
[38:30] I want to do the Ephesians series I want
[38:32] to finish that when I left off on that
[38:34] one that one kind of tied in with the
[38:36] jeffersonville things doctrines there I
[38:39] haven't heard back anything from
[38:40] Jeffersonville since the letter so I'm
[38:42] just patiently waiting and if they want
[38:45] to talk about it they got my number
[38:47] they got my email they got my video they
[38:49] got my mouth they got my book that they
[38:51] want to contact me Here I am I'm happy
[38:53] to talk about it anytime they want to
[38:57] so I want to continue on that one and
[38:59] there's other series I can't think of a
[39:02] now but there's other series I want to
[39:03] get to I want to eventually look at the
[39:04] entire life of Jesus Christ because we
[39:07] know our ministry has to match his
[39:09] ministry because he's called the the
[39:11] he's called the capstone we know he's
[39:14] the cornerstone and he's the hast called
[39:16] the headstone in the Bible and so he's
[39:18] gonna come down and rest upon a building
[39:19] the Bible says that we are a building
[39:21] placed together we're to be not just
[39:23] stones were to be living stones
[39:25] praise God were to have life to our
[39:28] testimonies praise God and the Bible
[39:30] says Paul says he's built a temple to
[39:32] dwell in and we are that living temple
[39:34] he's gonna come cap off a living temple
[39:37] a living body that he can dwell in a
[39:40] church that he can dwell in that's my
[39:42] great prayer that God will dwell in this
[39:44] church praise God that will be a church
[39:46] that the Holy Ghost can dwell in amen
[39:48] hallelujah that's a great blessing a
[39:50] promise that we that we can obtain and
[39:53] it's our choice right it's our choice
[39:54] whether to obtain to it or not just like
[39:57] many of God's promises are conditional
[39:58] and then Lord willing oh I'll be looking
[40:01] at more of the rapture series I just
[40:03] started that on Wednesday night now the
[40:05] reason I do that Church is because I'm
[40:07] writing I wrote on that and I hope you
[40:09] understand we have to get to a spot
[40:11] where we can prove everything we believe
[40:13] by the word only I think I think you you
[40:16] and I can see that people get in trouble
[40:18] when they just could say brother Branham
[40:20] brother Branham brother Branham people
[40:21] get into trouble with that as we saw
[40:25] because then you end up either leaning
[40:27] on brother Branham or leaning on the
[40:28] tapes or making too much of the tapes
[40:30] the tapes have a place right
[40:33] but our absolute has to be Jesus Christ
[40:35] it has to be the Word of God because the
[40:37] Word of God is the only thing that will
[40:39] never pass away so that's the reason why
[40:42] I wrote on that that's why I'm writing
[40:43] this book right now I'm in the the
[40:46] chapter to on Israel's blindness I'm
[40:48] going through all the covenants and so
[40:50] I'm learning a lot it's been a lot of
[40:51] research there to learning a lot it
[40:53] looks like there's eight covenants in
[40:54] the Bible and it looks like there's only
[40:56] one dispensation in the Bible and that's
[40:58] the Gentile dispensation so we'll get to
[41:01] that that's a whole nother teaching I
[41:02] want to get to that eventually and I
[41:04] want to give myself wholly to the Word
[41:06] of God I think it'll be a blessing to
[41:08] you and I want to just preach through
[41:09] all those chapters I've written
[41:11] because it'll just prove that we have
[41:12] the Word of God the true revelation
[41:15] Christ must increase praise God and we
[41:18] must decrease amen so that's kind of
[41:21] where I'm feeling led to go now but as I
[41:23] said if you have any questions about
[41:25] believe the sign or Jeffersonville
[41:27] movement please let me know I'll be
[41:29] happy to address them but I feel pretty
[41:32] pretty secure I was like I told you I
[41:35] was nervous for a while I was shaking up
[41:37] especially when friends like the ones I
[41:39] named it with you close to me we're kind
[41:41] of wondering about it and I'd never
[41:43] studied some of them I was really
[41:45] nervous for a few weeks there I was I
[41:46] was going through some tests but like
[41:50] all tests what do you want to test why
[41:52] why do you get shaken so you can find
[41:54] your foundation right you get shaken to
[41:56] see anything that would fall would fall
[41:58] but you're after the shake and you come
[41:59] back to your foundation and it's the
[42:01] Word of God so I didn't have an answer
[42:03] for the brown bear really I didn't have
[42:05] an answer for the 300-thousand I didn't
[42:07] have an answer for some of these other
[42:09] ones but through study and going back
[42:11] and waiting on the Lord and and
[42:13] searching the scriptures and the quotes
[42:14] then I found a place to stand praise God
[42:17] so anyways let's go now now what I do is
[42:23] sometimes you'll hear me I'll be like
[42:26] quoting something but it's not up there
[42:28] yet that's because I got two devices
[42:29] here I got my phone hooked up here but I
[42:31] got my iPad here because it's bigger so
[42:33] I can see it so if I'm ever if it ever
[42:35] seems like I'm not in line with what
[42:36] they're that's why so somebody just like
[42:39] go like this as they tap your tap your
[42:41] phone or something like that I don't
[42:43] mean to do that but I I just I need the
[42:45] bigger I like to see it bigger down here
[42:47] so I'm just gonna wrote real briefly say
[42:51] this just remember two perspectives
[42:53] there are so many correct prophecies
[42:56] from brother Branham that when you start
[42:59] looking at believe the sign you I forgot
[43:01] how many correct there were okay and
[43:04] then I always have to remember that this
[43:06] is basically the fruits that you have to
[43:08] look at the fruits of those who are
[43:10] accusing brother Branham the fruits of
[43:12] their false teachings the fruits of
[43:14] their life many of them are corrupt
[43:16] fruits they're not in holiness right and
[43:19] the Bible says in Titus and let me just
[43:21] go to that quickly there - Titus chapter
[43:23] 2
[43:25] this is one way we know we're walking in
[43:29] the light because the Bible says
[43:31] teaching us that denying ungodliness and
[43:34] worldly lusts we should live soberly
[43:36] righteously and godly in this present
[43:38] world looking for that blessed hope and
[43:41] the glorious appearing of the Great God
[43:42] and our Savior Jesus Christ as I
[43:46] listened and study on both sides of this
[43:49] you know with Jeffersonville and believe
[43:50] aside I see on the side I believe
[43:52] assigned a lot of the testimonies of
[43:54] people but but what I find is that I
[43:56] don't I don't believe their lives are
[43:58] getting more righteous or more holy to
[44:01] me it looks like they're getting more
[44:03] like the world and I shared some obvious
[44:05] examples the last time I looked at this
[44:07] and there's other ones too you know you
[44:08] listen to the gentlemen and they talk
[44:09] more about they talk about how they love
[44:11] sports and how they love movies and
[44:13] entertainments and things like that you
[44:15] know the Bible says Jesus Christ gospel
[44:18] will produce righteousness it will
[44:21] produce a more godly life and so our
[44:24] lives have to be going more righteously
[44:26] to that's one proud to have with message
[44:28] people I love people but I got a problem
[44:31] when their life doesn't look more like
[44:33] Christ I've got a problem with that and
[44:35] so I've got a right to preach that in
[44:37] our church if our lives aren't looking
[44:39] more godly then there's a problem with
[44:41] our lives
[44:41] the gospel of Jesus Christ is produced a
[44:45] life like Christ's righteousness sober
[44:50] godly in this present world amen but we
[44:54] see a lot of message churches and people
[44:56] they let down the bars they let sin
[44:57] enter in they let a corruption and are
[45:01] in and so these are two things I keep in
[45:04] mind though with believe the side I
[45:07] remember there's hundreds of
[45:09] discernments on the tapes there that are
[45:12] absolutely right one of them we know was
[45:13] Florence Hughes and and other one we
[45:17] know was Tom Brown that was after the
[45:19] fact but he's one that we've met where
[45:22] we've talked him about that and had
[45:24] discernment and then there's the three
[45:27] prophecies in process and then believe
[45:29] the sign admits to programs gifted a
[45:31] sermon and healings they know it was a
[45:33] reality and now there we looked at the
[45:38] fall
[45:38] accusations there was 32 lot and then a
[45:42] lot of these only five of them though
[45:44] were of these 32 were in the name of the
[45:46] Lord and so those are really the only
[45:47] five we have to look at and so we looked
[45:52] at the brown bear a little bit I'm just
[45:53] gonna review that one real quick we'll
[45:55] look at this one today
[45:56] this one the prophecies of 1933 Russia
[45:59] Vatican and Florence you carrying with
[46:01] that but that was actually fulfilled
[46:02] that was actually fulfilled so with the
[46:07] the brown bear vision the accusation is
[46:09] that thus saith the Lord failed that
[46:12] that's what that's what they believed
[46:14] because brother Ram said it's on tape
[46:16] here I seen a huge brown bear he said it
[46:19] might be a Kodiak would have worked on
[46:20] there in Canada but whatever be it'll be
[46:22] it will be
[46:23] that's thus saith the Lord it will be
[46:25] now I don't have the quotes up here but
[46:27] there's other there's two other quotes
[46:28] or mother man talks about the vision he
[46:30] never says thus saith the Lord but in
[46:32] the vision he actually says he shot the
[46:34] bear and he could see how big it was in
[46:37] the vision but again we have to remember
[46:40] that part he never says was thus saith
[46:42] the Lord he just tells about the vision
[46:46] but notice what he says he says it will
[46:49] be that's thus saith the Lord it will be
[46:54] and now there's other quotes they're too
[46:59] small there that's all of them there and
[47:02] then he says later he says that the
[47:06] vision passed right through and he was
[47:08] left standing and we talked about that
[47:09] last time that brother man was supposed
[47:12] to go with the there was two groups of
[47:13] brothers he was supposed to go with the
[47:15] brothers but he turned it down three
[47:16] times and he didn't see the brown bear
[47:19] but the other brother bran went the
[47:21] other way
[47:21] they saw the brown bear and the brown
[47:24] bear was it was actually there but he
[47:27] disobeyed the vision so he didn't shoot
[47:30] it alright so there's two possible
[47:33] explanations the it I believe it was
[47:37] fulfilled he said it will be it was the
[47:40] brown bear was actually there it was
[47:42] seen by the group of men it manifested
[47:45] and he never said thus saith the Lord
[47:47] about shooting it the vision showed if
[47:49] he would obeyed it he would have shot it
[47:52] but he never said the stay at the Lord
[47:54] I'm going to shoot it he just said thus
[47:55] saith the Lord it will be and it was it
[47:59] actually manifested and number two this
[48:03] vision was conditional like so many
[48:05] other of God's worth like King saw he
[48:08] lost out on the word of promise
[48:10] Joshua's generation I wouldn't say
[48:12] Joshua I want to be very clear on that
[48:13] Joshua didn't fail the generation failed
[48:17] but see he was but he was part of the
[48:20] generation for the generation to possess
[48:23] all the borders the rest of the
[48:25] generation had to keep out idolatry but
[48:27] we saw last time that they didn't drive
[48:30] out all seven they just drove out one
[48:31] the girgashites so they lost out their
[48:34] generation lost out on God's promise it
[48:37] happened later and then millions Church
[48:40] now this is true millions will lose out
[48:42] on the promises of acts 2:38 now I've
[48:45] met numerous what they're called
[48:47] apostolic Christians women that will
[48:49] grow their hair long they'll wear long
[48:51] skirts but then they'll start trimming
[48:53] their hair or their wear where they'll
[48:55] wear makeup yet they speak in tongues
[48:57] yet they prophesy if they have healings
[49:00] and miracles then they're wear high
[49:01] heels and yet they are all baptized in
[49:05] acts 2:38 every one of them and I've met
[49:09] many of those let's see you got a look
[49:12] at their lives too pretty soon they
[49:13] start compromising and their churches
[49:15] start letting down the the standards of
[49:19] Christianity and so they'll fall short
[49:21] many many will fall short of thus saith
[49:24] the Lord so that's where I stand on that
[49:29] I believe with all my heart that it was
[49:32] the brown bear was there and it was in a
[49:35] place it should not have been because
[49:36] God allowed to be there but it was a
[49:38] conditional promise and brother Graham
[49:40] failed on the part and so the part of
[49:42] the vision that he could have fulfilled
[49:44] did not come to pass the vision was
[49:46] right the vision was God's possibility
[49:49] God's conditional promise but he failed
[49:52] the promise and there is no as I said
[49:55] there is no thus saith the Lord that
[49:57] failed because he never said thus saith
[49:59] the Lord I'll shoot it so we got to be
[50:02] very careful with that
[50:02] now the next one there's a
[50:05] a prophecy of brother Branham saying
[50:09] 300,000 will read it here now the
[50:11] accusation is that this thus saith the
[50:13] Lord failed but I've under under the
[50:16] impression that it came to pass
[50:18] brother Graham just didn't understand it
[50:21] okay so here's the here's the quote
[50:23] there are actually four thus saith the
[50:25] Lord's where he says it about the three
[50:27] hundred thousand and he said oh are they
[50:30] all black people and then he turned my
[50:32] face here in front of me to Durman again
[50:33] and there was beautiful white men and
[50:35] women standing with their hands up in
[50:37] the air raising god then he turned me
[50:39] back again in the great light started
[50:40] going way back over the hills and
[50:42] showing then the angel drew near and I
[50:44] heard him scream with the voice that
[50:46] shook me from the vision said there will
[50:48] be three hundred thousand of them in
[50:50] that meeting thus saith the Lord mark it
[50:53] in your book and I come out of it this
[50:55] is in 1952 this is in July 1952 now he
[51:00] says it again in March of 53 and I'm
[51:03] going to a meeting now where there are
[51:05] three hundred thousand will be set and I
[51:07] say this from my heart did you ever hear
[51:09] me predict anything in the name of the
[51:10] Lord but what was exactly that way ask
[51:16] where ever you want to anywhere in the
[51:17] world look at the hundreds of and
[51:19] hundreds of things that he said surely I
[51:21] know what I'm speaking about not for
[51:22] myself Christ in here the next one he
[51:26] said in this angel above me turned on a
[51:27] great big operating light and begin to
[51:30] show back like that and just as far as I
[51:32] could see was nothing but people and it
[51:34] was up over hills and valleys and they
[51:36] look like Indians so look at the vision
[51:38] look like Indians and then when this
[51:41] angel above me speak to the angel that's
[51:43] always with me at my side this big
[51:46] fellow kind of dark complected hair down
[51:48] to his shoulders folded arms he was
[51:50] standing here by my side I heard him
[51:52] tell this one standing by me and the
[51:54] voice was so strong that it broke me out
[51:56] of the vision and said there's 300
[51:57] thousand of those in that meeting mark
[52:00] that down for us thus saith the Lord his
[52:02] word comes to pass the third one now
[52:06] this is the most direct in
[52:07] jeffersonville in 54
[52:10] maiya 54 he said mark my word write it
[52:13] in the pages of your Bible for it's thus
[52:15] saith the Lord remember when we land in
[52:17] India you're going to hear
[52:18] of tens of thousands times thousands
[52:21] being saved the Holy Spirit said I've
[52:23] wrote it here in my Bible it's wrote in
[52:25] tens of thousands of Bibles right here
[52:27] like the resurrection of the little boy
[52:28] by a vision that he said there's 300
[52:31] thousand of them in there and you see if
[52:33] that isn't right there's how the gospel
[52:36] is going to be preached just overnight
[52:37] she'll just sweep like that from place
[52:40] to place now we're going to show a quote
[52:46] now where brother Ram says the 1954
[52:48] Indian meetings were not the success
[52:50] they should have been because he didn't
[52:52] obey the vision fully so they were
[52:55] supposed to go if I'm not mistaken to
[52:58] Africa first then to India but I think
[53:01] they went to India first and then to
[53:03] Africa and brother ran just and to be
[53:06] fair brother Graham kept looking for the
[53:08] vision of the 300,000 Indians to be
[53:10] fulfilled all the way up to 1965 till
[53:12] the time he died yet here's where ears
[53:15] where I was enlightened yet there are
[53:18] numerous quotes where he said there may
[53:20] have been up to 500 thousands in his
[53:23] meetings in Bombay India there's many
[53:26] many quotes like that so I believe the
[53:29] vision was fulfilled but brother Ram
[53:31] just didn't understand it just like John
[53:33] the Baptist had a vision fulfilled about
[53:36] Jesus you know getting the Holy Ghost
[53:38] but later doubted its fulfillment okay
[53:41] so that is scriptural a prophet can have
[53:43] a vision it comes to pass they believed
[53:45] it for a while but then they doubt it
[53:47] when they get in trials or hardships or
[53:49] something like that they doubt the
[53:51] vision so here is here's the quote he
[53:58] said and I'd been very much a strained
[53:59] constrained to go to India and yet as
[54:01] many of you know the Indian trip wasn't
[54:03] the success that it should have been
[54:04] because I failed to follow the leader
[54:06] leading of the Holy Spirit and never
[54:08] recognized it after he gave me a vision
[54:10] to go up to Africa first and then to
[54:12] India and some of the Brethren said oh
[54:14] we we can't get to Africa so brother
[54:16] Roberts has just been down there so take
[54:18] off to India and under the influence of
[54:20] my brethren well maybe taught but no
[54:23] matter what someone influences you if
[54:24] God has told you something different and
[54:26] now judge it by the word by the word
[54:28] then go so see this is the quote
[54:32] leave the sign we'll use to say see it
[54:34] failed but for some reason uh they never
[54:37] put these quotes on here now here is a
[54:46] quote I'm gonna skip ahead he said I'm
[54:48] going to a tabernacle beginning tomorrow
[54:50] night tomorrow night I'm going to
[54:52] Tabernacle that packed out will hold 64
[54:54] a two nights meeting that's right
[54:56] Sturgis in Michigan when she's packed
[54:58] out it holds 60 people well I'm just as
[55:00] happy going there as I was in Bombay
[55:03] India to 500,000 it just depends on what
[55:08] the Lord would want you to do I like
[55:11] that pray for me so this is three years
[55:14] after the trip to India so he's already
[55:19] preached a 500 thousand so this is just
[55:22] like the tenth vision I'm gonna show
[55:23] those quotes later at the end here so
[55:25] let me skip past that because let me go
[55:28] to another one now this is in 1958 he
[55:30] said and so the little church that was
[55:32] sponsoring us was insufficient and take
[55:34] care of a place where it was estimated
[55:36] that at the time we were there three
[55:38] days that around five hundred thousand
[55:40] was present and oh I just wouldn't know
[55:44] how many tens of thousands of
[55:47] Mohammedans and everything came to
[55:49] Christ with no way at all to take care
[55:52] of it he had by praise God he said the
[55:59] law
[55:59] just crowd ever had the privilege of
[56:01] preaching to us Bombay India about three
[56:04] years ago five hundred thousand I'm
[56:11] gonna skip down the next quote now here
[56:13] we are probably three or four hundred
[56:15] setting in here tonight look here now
[56:18] I've seen four or five hundred thousand
[56:20] in Bombay India see two hundred seventy
[56:23] five thousand in Durban South Africa so
[56:27] program just gives quote after quote
[56:29] after quote where he says I've seen half
[56:31] a million in India now if we look at if
[56:34] we look at other quotes by the RAM said
[56:36] he exaggerated often okay so I think
[56:39] this five hundred thousand was actually
[56:41] the three hundred thousand from the
[56:42] vision he said was you in Africa Africa
[56:45] that time brother was you there no India
[56:47] see well now maybe I'll get a chance to
[56:49] speak of India was you there when I was
[56:52] in India not there that's when I had my
[56:54] greatest gathering at Bombay five
[56:56] hundred thousand at one time so that's
[56:58] where I seen well I can't go into that
[57:01] he said that he's done so much I tell
[57:04] you it's wonderful there's numerous more
[57:06] all you have to do churches type in
[57:07] Bombay three hundred thousand there's
[57:09] many many more there's probably like
[57:10] five or six more now let me just pull
[57:14] this up real quick on some of the other
[57:18] points I want to make here about this
[57:21] this vision so to me most likely the
[57:27] three hundred thousand vision was
[57:28] already fulfilled so I think brother
[57:31] Adam was just exaggerating on the five
[57:33] hundred thousand and it was actually
[57:34] three hundred thousand as we said it's
[57:37] possible for a prophet to believe a
[57:40] visions come to pass but then doubt it
[57:42] we see that in Scripture as well look at
[57:46] brother Branham also doubted the tenth
[57:47] vision but I believe if you look at
[57:50] other quotes that was already fulfilled
[57:51] I have a quote also her brother Branham
[57:55] says that this three hundred thousand he
[57:59] says will be fulfilled somewhere east of
[58:02] Africa
[58:03] so I hear he says it in 1953 he said
[58:06] mark it in your Bible I don't have this
[58:07] one up here but I just have it on my
[58:09] other document that you will hear that I
[58:12] was in India somewhere
[58:13] east of Africa tan Jenica somewhere
[58:15] where Indians are at somewhere in that
[58:17] Eastern country which I believe will be
[58:20] India itself where there will be 300,000
[58:24] people either they will be attending the
[58:26] meeting or they'll be there so but at
[58:30] the point I'm trying to show his mother
[58:31] am said or I see so there was a lot of
[58:34] uncertainty about the exact details of
[58:37] the vision but he does report and other
[58:41] people are reporting that he had
[58:43] meetings that were at least two hundred
[58:45] seventy five thousand three hundred
[58:46] thousand he said maybe four hundred
[58:48] thousand maybe five hundred thousand
[58:51] that's the next point I want to make now
[58:54] the last point about this is when I've
[58:56] gone through before but go to first
[58:58] Kings 19 in your Bible first Kings 19
[59:00] fifteen first Kings 19 fifteen the last
[59:07] point is one actually better let Laura
[59:09] shared with me years ago and he listened
[59:13] to that last sermon I preached on prove
[59:15] all things that's what sister Karen told
[59:17] me and told sister Karen I had some good
[59:20] points there so I was appreciative of
[59:22] that first Kings 19 15 to 17 so it looks
[59:28] like brother branham he had over three
[59:32] thousand people in his Indian meetings
[59:34] within those three-day campaigns so he
[59:37] had to take all the people that attended
[59:39] his meetings in three days and that
[59:40] would have achieved the 300,000 but this
[59:44] scripture speaks of God giving Elijah
[59:47] instructions to anoint three people but
[59:52] he only fulfilled one of them to other
[59:55] people fulfilled the word of the Lord
[59:57] for Elijah after Elijah was raptured so
[1:00:04] first
[1:00:05] 19:15 and the Lord said unto him go
[1:00:08] return on thy way to the wilderness of
[1:00:10] Damascus and when thou cometh anoint has
[1:00:13] yelled to be king over Syria now he did
[1:00:17] not anoint haseo
[1:00:19] because who did it eli should did it one
[1:00:24] will read out a little bit verse 16 and
[1:00:26] jehu the son of nimshi shalt thou anoint
[1:00:29] to be king over israel and he likes you
[1:00:33] the son of shaphat of a bell
[1:00:35] mahalo shalt thou anoint to be prophet
[1:00:37] in thy room so there's a third one so
[1:00:40] he's gonna anoint three people has al
[1:00:44] Jehu and elisha
[1:00:47] look at verse 17 and this should gonna
[1:00:49] pass that him that escaped or the sword
[1:00:51] of Hazael shall Jehu slay and him that
[1:00:53] escaped with a sword of Jehu shall
[1:00:55] Elijah's slay now you know the only one
[1:01:00] that he really anointed and this is even
[1:01:02] interesting too is elijah but it wasn't
[1:01:07] really elijah laying hands on him
[1:01:10] Elijah's just went in the rapture and he
[1:01:13] just said follow me and if you follow me
[1:01:15] if you don't take your eyes off me
[1:01:16] you'll get my anointing he really didn't
[1:01:19] even lay hands on him or anything just
[1:01:21] the garment fell down from the heavens
[1:01:23] praise God so we got to be careful that
[1:01:27] that we try not to interpret these
[1:01:30] things in our way with our mind or our
[1:01:33] understanding what happened was a double
[1:01:37] portion fell upon Elijah from Elijah but
[1:01:41] Elijah himself didn't lay hands on him
[1:01:43] and then the anointing came upon him it
[1:01:45] was God anointing Elijah through the
[1:01:48] falling down of the anointing through
[1:01:50] the mantle but God said you're gonna
[1:01:53] anoint Elisha are you with me Church God
[1:01:57] said you're gonna know Elijah but he
[1:01:59] actually didn't lay the hands on him the
[1:02:02] anointing just left him when he got
[1:02:04] raptured and it fell upon it Elijah so
[1:02:06] you have to be very careful how many
[1:02:08] believe you have to be very careful how
[1:02:09] you interpret God's Word very cool
[1:02:12] that's why the Bible said we got to
[1:02:13] rightly divide the word of truth
[1:02:19] now
[1:02:21] Elijah never anointed haseo
[1:02:24] because Elijah does this go to 2nd Kings
[1:02:27] 813 now second Kings 813 just to prove
[1:02:32] this by the Word of God and remember
[1:02:34] brother Loris told me he heard this from
[1:02:36] a preacher in Arizona when they used to
[1:02:38] go out to brother Perry greens church
[1:02:39] which this was this is a great
[1:02:41] revelation this is a great revelation
[1:02:43] that shows God interprets the word the
[1:02:46] way he wants to God doesn't need anybody
[1:02:49] in to interpret his word for him second
[1:02:54] Kings 8 13 and 15 and has he all said
[1:02:59] but what is thy servant a dog that he
[1:03:01] should do this great thing and Elijah
[1:03:03] answer the Lord has shown me that thou
[1:03:05] shalt be king over Syria so he departed
[1:03:07] from Elijah and came to his master and
[1:03:09] said to him what said Elijah to the and
[1:03:13] he answered he told me that thou should
[1:03:14] it's surely recover and it came to pass
[1:03:17] on the morrow that he took a thick cloth
[1:03:19] and dipped it in water and spread it on
[1:03:21] his face
[1:03:22] so that he died and has the I'll reign
[1:03:25] in the stead and the fifth year of Joe
[1:03:27] Ram the son of Ahab king of Israel
[1:03:29] Jehoshaphat being then king of Judah
[1:03:32] Jaeho Ram the Son of Jehoshaphat king of
[1:03:35] Judah began to reign thirty and two
[1:03:37] years old was he beget when he began to
[1:03:40] reign and he reigned eight years in
[1:03:41] Jerusalem and he walked in the way of
[1:03:44] the kings of Israel as did the house of
[1:03:46] Ahab for the daughter of Ahab was his
[1:03:48] wife and he did evil in the sight of the
[1:03:50] Lord
[1:03:51] now here church leaders have to assume
[1:03:54] that he'll I should did annoy him
[1:03:55] because we're not told Elijah anointed
[1:03:57] him right
[1:03:58] we're not even told Elijah just says the
[1:04:02] Lord has showed me you'll be king over
[1:04:04] Syria but does it ever say that he
[1:04:06] anointed him no it never says that but
[1:04:10] we have to understand that if God told
[1:04:12] Elijah that he was going to do it that
[1:04:14] God meant the anointed ministry that
[1:04:17] followed Elijah was going to do it never
[1:04:19] be with me on that one Elijah
[1:04:24] do it but the anointed ministry or I say
[1:04:29] this the same Holy Spirit that was on
[1:04:31] Elijah
[1:04:31] now is transferred to the next ministry
[1:04:33] and the next ministry fulfilled it
[1:04:35] praise God and that's why I church I
[1:04:39] even believe this I believe people that
[1:04:41] knew brother Branham message preachers
[1:04:43] that priests in India I believe that
[1:04:46] it's possible that even the meetings
[1:04:48] that they have had over all these years
[1:04:49] if you add that up to 300,000 I believe
[1:04:52] that could fulfill the mission - I'm not
[1:04:55] saying it would but I believe that
[1:04:57] matches the scripture does every
[1:04:59] understand it's the same ministry as
[1:05:02] long as the same Holy Spirit is moving
[1:05:06] that was on the original one who has the
[1:05:09] promise was made - as long as the same
[1:05:12] Holy Spirit is on the next ministry God
[1:05:15] can use that ministry to fulfill the
[1:05:17] promise that he told to the Prophet hey
[1:05:19] then glory amen hallelujah in church I
[1:05:22] know Randy sighs told me his dad his dad
[1:05:26] was one of the the first missionaries to
[1:05:28] ever go to India and he said they had
[1:05:30] thousands of converts in India thousands
[1:05:36] Randy sighs told me
[1:05:38] his dad he would just you know his dad
[1:05:40] was the pastor and Randy was just
[1:05:42] preaching brother Randy sighs told me
[1:05:44] that if I got my story right one day his
[1:05:47] dad just come in and said Randy you're
[1:05:49] the pastor I'm going to India and the
[1:05:51] next day he was pastoring how would you
[1:05:53] like that church somebody said oh you're
[1:05:56] to start pastoring tomorrow and they'll
[1:05:57] give you any heads-up that's just the
[1:05:59] kind of man he was
[1:06:00] and now Randy's been passed in there 40
[1:06:02] years 40 years so see you can see gods
[1:06:04] in it by the fruit that it bears and how
[1:06:07] many thousands see I believe God could
[1:06:09] have fulfilled brother and his vision
[1:06:11] through brother Randy sizes dad and also
[1:06:15] through Knoll Johnson they're still
[1:06:16] winning souls in India thousands
[1:06:18] thousands of message churches you add
[1:06:21] him up look at Sampson Shetty he's
[1:06:25] preached horse before seeing Souls many
[1:06:28] souls many churches turning to the
[1:06:31] message of the hour so if Jesus Christ
[1:06:34] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:06:36] then we have to allow that even if
[1:06:38] brother Graham didn't see that 300,000
[1:06:41] that God could do it through message
[1:06:43] preachers in the next generation and we
[1:06:49] believe that because that's a Bible
[1:06:50] teaching hallelujah praise God and the
[1:06:55] Bible don't even say he'll I should
[1:06:56] anointed him so we have to infer it we
[1:06:59] have to just believe it because he's
[1:07:01] there and then he becomes the then haseo
[1:07:03] becomes King later because we know God's
[1:07:06] Word cannot fail how many believe God's
[1:07:08] Word can't fail can't fail God said you
[1:07:13] you anoint has yell but Elijah never did
[1:07:19] he said thou anoint haseo and thou shalt
[1:07:24] anoint Jehu and Elisha never anointed
[1:07:27] Jehu it was a son of a prophet how about
[1:07:31] that one how about that God told Elijah
[1:07:35] you anoint him you anoint J who he never
[1:07:37] did a son of a prophet did let's read
[1:07:42] that second Kings nine when the thirty
[1:07:47] no it's just the next chapter there I'm
[1:07:50] sorry my hands are really dry part of me
[1:07:52] and then I blew into the mic here sorry
[1:07:55] and Elijah the Prophet called one of the
[1:07:58] children of the prophets and sending him
[1:08:00] gird up thy loins and take this box of
[1:08:02] oil in that hand and go to ramoth-gilead
[1:08:05] look one of the just one of the children
[1:08:07] of the prophets so now it's not Elijah
[1:08:10] or Elijah it's just a child so a child
[1:08:15] is fulfilling what God told the prophet
[1:08:18] Elijah hey how do you praise God amen
[1:08:22] and when thou cometh thither look out
[1:08:24] there Jehu the son of Jehoshaphat the
[1:08:26] son of nimshi and going and make him
[1:08:28] arise up from among his brethren and
[1:08:30] carry him to an inner chamber then take
[1:08:32] the box of oil and pour it on his head
[1:08:34] and say thus saith the Lord I have
[1:08:36] anointed thee king over Israel then open
[1:08:39] the door and flee and tarry not and so
[1:08:42] the young man even the young man the
[1:08:43] prophet went to ramoth-gilead hey hey
[1:08:46] man glory praise God Church ton that
[1:08:51] lifts your faith a little bit does that
[1:08:53] lift your faith man that really helps me
[1:08:56] God told heel idea you're gonna need
[1:08:58] three
[1:08:59] he only anointed one of them God used
[1:09:02] Elijah for Hesse oh and then he used a
[1:09:05] young prophet to anoint Jehu
[1:09:09] it wasn't Elijah but it was the same
[1:09:12] spirit that did it you say well where is
[1:09:15] that in the Bible revelation 10 the book
[1:09:18] comes down from heaven and what did any
[1:09:20] and God tells John to eat it and then
[1:09:22] God told John go and preach it to every
[1:09:24] nation - John do that no he didn't
[1:09:26] that's you and I praise God we're the
[1:09:30] ones that are supposed to take the
[1:09:32] revelations of the open book like
[1:09:33] brother Simon and brother Craig right
[1:09:36] missionaries go into every country where
[1:09:39] the ones are supposed to take it and
[1:09:41] prophesy again but as long as it's the
[1:09:44] same spirit then God's Word is fulfilled
[1:09:47] God's prophecies are fulfilled as long
[1:09:49] as it's the same spirit bringing it to
[1:09:51] pass amen
[1:09:52] hallelujah that's good that's wonderful
[1:09:56] thank God the preacher priest said there
[1:09:58] that's that's the reason God said
[1:10:00] brother Loris here I never would have
[1:10:02] found that I never would have found that
[1:10:06] God had to several Dolores here to share
[1:10:09] that revelation with us thank the Lord
[1:10:11] for that now this is extra I'm gonna
[1:10:16] share the tenth vision here briefly
[1:10:19] believe the sign says this vision failed
[1:10:22] I believe it was already fulfilled
[1:10:25] though in March of 1963 now here's the
[1:10:29] tenth mission now I myself I can't
[1:10:31] remember the Jose maybe can help me out
[1:10:33] with this I can't find where brother I
[1:10:35] never spoke the tenth mission and he
[1:10:36] said the words thus saith the Lord I
[1:10:38] can't find it I looked ok ok there could
[1:10:43] be though there could be I just have it
[1:10:44] Jose and I have not found that as we
[1:10:46] looked but he tells it of course
[1:10:48] beginning in 1965 or 56 and continues to
[1:10:52] tell all the way up to the end now
[1:10:55] brother branham repeatedly said it would
[1:10:58] be a physical tent and talked about it
[1:11:01] all the way up to his death like just
[1:11:03] months before he died you can hear him
[1:11:04] saying we're trying to get rent out a
[1:11:06] farm and we're trying to get the tent
[1:11:07] set up so we can see this vision coming
[1:11:10] to pass but he never says thus saith the
[1:11:13] Lord now I believe it was fulfilled when
[1:11:17] he preached the seven seals in March of
[1:11:20] 1963 that's what I believe now here's
[1:11:26] the vision let's read it this is from
[1:11:29] Wow January 1st yeah 56 and then he'd
[1:11:34] taken me from there and I seen a great
[1:11:35] huge tent I never seen such a tent and
[1:11:37] it was packed in lined everywhere with
[1:11:39] people and I looked and I walked out
[1:11:42] looked like I was standing above the
[1:11:43] people looking down where I just made an
[1:11:46] altar call and hundreds of hundreds of
[1:11:47] people were weeping and rejoicing after
[1:11:49] they accepted the Lord Jesus as their
[1:11:51] Savior and I looked and then heard a man
[1:11:55] get up and say call the prayer line now
[1:11:57] I just thought that with Jose brother
[1:11:59] branham in the seven seals he did say
[1:12:01] hundreds of people were baptized that
[1:12:02] week that's right I just forgot about
[1:12:04] God amen I know he said that they had
[1:12:06] hundreds of people being baptized during
[1:12:08] that week of the seven seals that's
[1:12:11] right I forgot about that and I looked
[1:12:13] and then heard a man get up and say call
[1:12:15] the prayer line and then they had a
[1:12:17] healing service that's right that
[1:12:19] a-helix
[1:12:20] the Monday after the Seventh Seal was
[1:12:24] Sunday night he stayed over one more day
[1:12:27] and he recorded that different ending
[1:12:29] the Seventh Seal and then they had a
[1:12:30] prayer a healing line that next night I
[1:12:37] noticed in my left which would have been
[1:12:39] to my right if I was on the platform a
[1:12:41] little wooden building and I seen that
[1:12:43] light that all they have the picture but
[1:12:46] you know that's always in the meetings I
[1:12:48] seen that light leave me and go to that
[1:12:50] building and go in that building and a
[1:12:52] voice said to me I'll meet you in there
[1:12:54] that'll be the third Pole I said why he
[1:13:00] said well I will it won't be a public
[1:13:02] show like the other and I came to so the
[1:13:07] first sign of the hand was the public
[1:13:09] show everybody in the public saw the
[1:13:11] second sign was the sermon that was a
[1:13:12] public show everybody saw it but the
[1:13:15] third pole was gonna nut was not going
[1:13:17] to be a public show and I just want you
[1:13:22] to know program says at the end of the
[1:13:23] preaching the seventh seal he says and
[1:13:25] now we're grateful to God for what he
[1:13:27] has showed us I've been sitting in the
[1:13:29] room up there for eight days and the
[1:13:31] message that I've just got through
[1:13:33] explaining you many of you here will
[1:13:34] understand and I promise that there was
[1:13:36] something going on spiritual all the
[1:13:39] time hallelujah
[1:13:42] that I was sure you were missing it and
[1:13:43] here's what it was it was absolute of
[1:13:46] vindication of this interpretation of
[1:13:47] the Scriptures being sent from God
[1:13:49] because before we even went into it and
[1:13:51] I left to go out west the Lord showed me
[1:13:54] a vision one day about 10 o'clock in the
[1:13:56] morning and I come to and explain it
[1:13:59] here that I'd seen it didn't know what
[1:14:00] it was it was a constellation of seven
[1:14:02] angels we'll remember that you'll get it
[1:14:05] on a tape called what time is it sir
[1:14:06] well now that is exactly what you're
[1:14:09] seeing now praise God
[1:14:11] amen so remember all them all the people
[1:14:13] random Tabernacle had visions of brother
[1:14:15] Branham going out west so he went out
[1:14:17] west he met the constellation of seven
[1:14:20] angels they said go back and preach the
[1:14:22] seven seals and open up the seven seals
[1:14:24] because the lamb opens him up and so he
[1:14:27] did and then he sat eight days in a room
[1:14:29] and studied in this private little room
[1:14:32] and each
[1:14:34] day the Holy Spirit would meet with him
[1:14:35] and the voice said I'll meet you in that
[1:14:38] room amen
[1:14:39] I hear you praise God and it won't be a
[1:14:42] public show but I'll meet you in the put
[1:14:44] in the private room and that was the
[1:14:46] room where he was studying and seeking
[1:14:48] God that's right
[1:14:51] now look what he says anointed ones he
[1:14:53] says notice the very day when this
[1:14:55] messenger not when he starts on but when
[1:14:57] he begins to declare his message the
[1:14:59] first pole healing the second bowl
[1:15:01] prophesy the third pole the opening of
[1:15:03] the word the mysteries revealed no more
[1:15:05] there's no more higher order than to
[1:15:07] reveal the word than prophets but the
[1:15:09] only way the prophet can be vindicated
[1:15:10] is by the word yes and remember the
[1:15:14] third pole was the opening of them seven
[1:15:16] seals to reveal the hidden truth that's
[1:15:19] been sealed in no-hair name how did they
[1:15:22] hear you praise God I believe that Amen
[1:15:24] that's what I like now I preached this
[1:15:27] years ago I'm going to bring it out
[1:15:29] again
[1:15:30] if you listen to the seventh seal
[1:15:32] sermons brother Ram says day after day
[1:15:34] the Holy Spirit would meet him every day
[1:15:36] to reveal the seal he says in something
[1:15:51] he says this has been a tremendous week
[1:15:53] for me I'm tired my mind is tired
[1:15:54] because I have what the best I could do
[1:15:57] in something strange going on every day
[1:16:00] I would be amazed to walk in the room
[1:16:02] and there be for a few minutes and see
[1:16:04] something just turn me completely around
[1:16:07] amen he says that I walked up and down
[1:16:11] the floor while I said well what is it
[1:16:12] Lord
[1:16:13] I kneel down and pray go back pick up
[1:16:14] the Bible and then all of a sudden when
[1:16:16] I got quiet here and unfolded like that
[1:16:18] and I'd grab a pen real quick and go to
[1:16:21] writing it down whatever I was seeing
[1:16:23] and doing watching it like that til I
[1:16:25] got a whole wrote down and then I take
[1:16:27] the rest of the day and go down and
[1:16:29] chase this out and see if it tied all
[1:16:31] the way down through the Scriptures
[1:16:32] prove all things amen
[1:16:34] there's our sermon title amen hallelujah
[1:16:37] thank the Lord
[1:16:40] well Ram said when he preached the first
[1:16:42] seal I would have had a horrible mistake
[1:16:45] on that if it hadn't been about 12
[1:16:47] o'clock today
[1:16:48] the Holy Spirit came in the room and
[1:16:50] corrected me on something I was riding
[1:16:52] down to say praise God he said there
[1:16:54] about twelve o'clock in the day the Holy
[1:16:56] Spirit just swept right down to the room
[1:16:57] the whole thing just opened up to me in
[1:17:00] the second thing he said the first thing
[1:17:02] you know something just happens he says
[1:17:05] and then I grab me a pencil real quick
[1:17:07] and start writing down as fast and I as
[1:17:10] I can while he's there hey man so while
[1:17:15] he's there he shows what his visions
[1:17:17] it wasn't a public show as a private
[1:17:20] show of praise God he met him they said
[1:17:23] I'll meet you in there and I opened the
[1:17:25] seals and I'll reveal him to you in the
[1:17:27] third series said but this morning early
[1:17:29] the Holy Spirit came to where I was just
[1:17:32] as plain as anything and I've seen this
[1:17:35] other seal open up just exactly amen he
[1:17:38] said when it was a real to me early this
[1:17:40] morning before daylight I went quickly
[1:17:42] to the scripture and begin to search it
[1:17:44] up there it is three of them so far has
[1:17:46] been absolutely supernaturally revealed
[1:17:48] the forseeable Ram said he said the four
[1:17:51] seal
[1:17:52] he says when it goes to breaking forth
[1:17:54] like that he said I just pick up my pen
[1:17:56] and start writing
[1:17:57] he said just stay there maybe four hours
[1:18:00] till it gets a finish I know that that's
[1:18:03] God as long as it's comparing Scripture
[1:18:05] with Scripture praise God amen the fifth
[1:18:11] seal Boehner said now I want to give
[1:18:12] thanks to him who's omnipresent that
[1:18:15] today not knowing one thing about that
[1:18:18] fifth seal it came in that same
[1:18:21] mysterious way this morning just about
[1:18:23] an hour before daybreak that when I was
[1:18:26] out in prayer amen hallelujah
[1:18:29] so when did the Holy Ghost come to him
[1:18:32] while he was praying early in the
[1:18:34] morning when does God come to you early
[1:18:38] in the morning yeah that's right praise
[1:18:41] God
[1:18:42] early the morning said about an hour
[1:18:45] before daybreak that's when the Holy
[1:18:47] Spirit would reveal the Word of God
[1:18:49] hallelujah
[1:18:55] the
[1:18:56] remson why isn't there one here on the
[1:18:58] fist Hill to announce it as far as a
[1:19:00] beast
[1:19:01] here it is according to the revelation
[1:19:03] that the Lord Jesus gave me today this
[1:19:06] morning early he said that is the
[1:19:08] mystery of the church ages are already
[1:19:10] finished at the time of the fifth seal
[1:19:13] who gave the revelation the Lord Jesus
[1:19:15] and he met him in that room amen people
[1:19:19] just you know it just it's just got to
[1:19:22] be revealed we just got to wait upon the
[1:19:23] Lord God will review all these things in
[1:19:25] time uh he says them revelations in the
[1:19:29] presence of that ball of fire hang in
[1:19:32] there in the room he says you never get
[1:19:35] used to it you can't it's too sacred Wow
[1:19:40] six see Obama have said something
[1:19:42] happened today when this seal was
[1:19:43] revealed til I had to walk completely
[1:19:45] out in the yard just walk around in the
[1:19:47] yard a little while that's right
[1:19:49] it just simply almost took my breath
[1:19:51] away see so something happened the Holy
[1:19:56] Spirit came in such a way he had to walk
[1:19:58] out of the woods house cuz he was
[1:19:59] staying with the woods the woods family
[1:20:01] and he had to go out in the yard because
[1:20:04] it was so powerful see God was meeting
[1:20:06] with him in a private way and he's gonna
[1:20:08] do the third seal he's gonna I'm sorry
[1:20:10] the third Pole he's gonna open up the
[1:20:12] word to God's people that's right and
[1:20:16] then brother Ram says of all the times
[1:20:18] I've been behind the pulpit at the
[1:20:20] Tabernacle I've never never in any time
[1:20:23] of my ministry ever worked into the
[1:20:26] realms of God and the spiritual realms
[1:20:29] as it's been at this time
[1:20:30] yeah it's beyond anything I ever did in
[1:20:32] any time of my ministry in any meeting
[1:20:35] anywhere anywhere like this
[1:20:37] mostly it's on healing this is on
[1:20:40] revealing of truth by the same spirit
[1:20:41] the same spirit praise God Church he's
[1:20:45] already seen five hundred thousand
[1:20:47] people or three hundred thousand a
[1:20:48] meeting he's seen tens of thousands
[1:20:50] times tens of thousands get saved but
[1:20:53] the meeting of the angel in the Holy
[1:20:55] Spirit with him day after day for all
[1:20:57] those days in a row was greater than any
[1:21:00] meetings ever had because he got the
[1:21:02] meet personally he got to have
[1:21:03] fellowship he got the SUP with Christ he
[1:21:06] opened the door and Christ sup with him
[1:21:08] and he sup with Christ he
[1:21:10] that's right did you know in the seventh
[1:21:15] seal brother branham said this is the
[1:21:16] third pole and there's three great
[1:21:18] things that goes with it and one
[1:21:20] unfolded today the other one unfolded
[1:21:24] today one folded today or yesterday the
[1:21:26] other one unfolded today and there's one
[1:21:29] thing that I cannot interpret it because
[1:21:31] it was an unknown language when I was
[1:21:33] standing right there and looked right
[1:21:34] straight at it and this is the third
[1:21:37] pole coming up grace God amen hallelujah
[1:21:43] now what Randy Cius said helped me out
[1:21:46] so much because Randy size showed me the
[1:21:50] quote where brother Branham said the
[1:21:52] angel of the Lord interpreted the the
[1:21:56] vision and I never knew that and this
[1:21:58] was this is back when we're on Waterloo
[1:22:00] Road when I brother Andy sighs come and
[1:22:02] preach for us this helped me and such
[1:22:03] and I always knew this quote would be so
[1:22:04] important I wrote it down and I've saved
[1:22:06] it and then when it did this one that
[1:22:10] was standing by me behind me the same
[1:22:12] voice the Angels voice he said I'll meet
[1:22:14] you in there and this is the third pole
[1:22:15] but nobody will know nothing about it I
[1:22:18] said well I don't understand why I'm
[1:22:20] there why there he said it will not be a
[1:22:22] public show this time and I said I don't
[1:22:25] understand going into that closet like
[1:22:27] that so brother I'm called the tent a
[1:22:29] closet Wow Amen honey area at church
[1:22:34] look at this boat man was just confused
[1:22:36] he was trying to set up a public tent by
[1:22:38] the hose they see that but that Lord
[1:22:40] said it's not going to be a public show
[1:22:42] amen hey he says it will not be a public
[1:22:47] show he said it isn't is it not written
[1:22:49] by our Lord this is what the angel said
[1:22:51] see I knew where the brother brother
[1:22:53] Andy was so inspired when he preached
[1:22:55] this I was like what the angel
[1:22:58] interpreted the vision for us is it not
[1:23:01] written by our Lord when thou pray us be
[1:23:03] not like the hypocrites who like to be a
[1:23:04] hurdle for men but enter the secret
[1:23:06] closet and pray to the Father who sees
[1:23:08] in secret who sees in secret shall
[1:23:10] reward thee openly
[1:23:11] it's perfect link to the scripture every
[1:23:14] time it is Amen hallelujah
[1:23:18] thank the Lord now that's what I believe
[1:23:22] with all my heart but believe the sign
[1:23:23] will say see the tenth mission failed -
[1:23:25] he never hadn't but yet it had happened
[1:23:28] already he just didn't understand it
[1:23:36] praise God
[1:23:40] that's beautiful
[1:23:43] see it's the work of the Holy Spirit God
[1:23:46] and is the own interpreter of his of his
[1:23:48] own word God is his own interpreter so
[1:23:53] see because I just thought I'd add in
[1:23:55] the tape the tenth vision because it was
[1:23:57] so clear to me this morning I might all
[1:23:58] the people got to see this the tenth
[1:24:00] visions already been fulfilled it can't
[1:24:01] be a published show it can't be out in a
[1:24:03] physical tent that's why God keep
[1:24:05] cutting off the tent every time every
[1:24:07] time the brothers get the read the tent
[1:24:08] every time it got cut off because it had
[1:24:11] to fulfill what the angel said amen on
[1:24:15] it there yeah and then he preached it
[1:24:18] knowing to ones at the end times not
[1:24:19] even knowing what he was saying not even
[1:24:21] probably knowing what he was saying and
[1:24:25] church did you know there was even great
[1:24:27] miracles during the seventh seal sermons
[1:24:29] a boy walked in and this is Rick this is
[1:24:31] this is a vindicated the Collins family
[1:24:34] came to the message because God healed
[1:24:37] their boy he was dying and the Collins
[1:24:40] family it's the family that used to pass
[1:24:42] her Brenham Tabernacle he said I'm sure
[1:24:45] you've noticed that the little Collins
[1:24:47] boy laying there dying the other night
[1:24:49] and that little leukemia girl like that
[1:24:51] week of the seals was so supernatural
[1:24:53] two children got healed they were gonna
[1:24:55] die but God healed them why because it
[1:24:58] was God fulfilling his Lord amen
[1:25:01] the kingdom of God is coming it's been
[1:25:03] becoming more from the negative the
[1:25:05] positive as it has now now that ought to
[1:25:07] choke people from justification
[1:25:08] sanctification to the Baptist only ghost
[1:25:10] then here we're just drawing closer to
[1:25:12] God all the time so that part of the
[1:25:16] vision where people are getting healed
[1:25:17] and prayer lines we got to find that
[1:25:19] quote on the baptisms let me write that
[1:25:21] down who's got a pen who's got a pen
[1:25:26] anybody got a pen real quick can you
[1:25:27] bring up Lydia let me just write this
[1:25:29] down so I don't forget all right I'll
[1:25:31] take that I want to find those quotes
[1:25:32] from
[1:25:32] the seven seals thank you where brother
[1:25:34] have says hundreds of people many people
[1:25:37] might not be hunters but he said many
[1:25:38] people were being baptized that would be
[1:25:41] just a it just be God interpreting his
[1:25:43] own word just God's grace brother God's
[1:25:51] grace you know what's so sad about that
[1:25:54] brother Jose the people will they'll try
[1:25:56] to interpret themselves and then they'll
[1:25:57] leave righteousness and they'll go out
[1:26:00] there and do the evil things that we're
[1:26:01] taught that s'what breaks my heart they
[1:26:03] don't even give it a long enough chance
[1:26:06] if you could see God vindicating in
[1:26:08] through the gift and discernment we'll
[1:26:10] just wait upon the Lord
[1:26:11] maybe that wait upon the Lord renew
[1:26:13] their strength amen hallelujah that's
[1:26:17] the part that breaks my heart they they
[1:26:19] either dfi brother and make every word
[1:26:21] or they're not waiting long enough and
[1:26:24] they don't pray about long enough and
[1:26:27] then they start live an unrighteous ly
[1:26:29] instead of living godly see God has you
[1:26:33] there has to be a prophet for every age
[1:26:36] there's got to be a prophet oh I'm
[1:26:38] talking about is there's gotta be a
[1:26:39] prophet like Paul we got to trust in
[1:26:42] God's prophets amen there's got to be
[1:26:45] some man God's got to send some man as a
[1:26:47] prophet to finish the mysteries of God
[1:26:50] but like I said I just feel like they
[1:26:53] don't want to tally up to obeying all
[1:26:55] the Word of God it's nice I'm being nice
[1:26:58] I'm not being critical I love people
[1:27:00] praise God I love those who accused
[1:27:02] brother Graham I love them but I believe
[1:27:05] that's what's wrong got to wait longer
[1:27:07] on the Lord wait to the Lord reveals
[1:27:09] that praise God amen now Church I don't
[1:27:13] have any slides on this because this
[1:27:15] would have taken even more hours I spent
[1:27:17] multiple hours yesterday on this and
[1:27:18] this morning I just there's not enough
[1:27:20] time now let me just give you my
[1:27:22] thoughts in 1958 I believe I could be
[1:27:27] wrong program starts talking about the
[1:27:29] vision he had in 1933 okay you know the
[1:27:33] seven major visions right well what you
[1:27:39] - if you listen to every time he talks
[1:27:41] about details change okay so like
[1:27:45] sometimes to talk about Franklin Delano
[1:27:47] Roosevelt Roosevelt in World War two and
[1:27:49] then sometimes they'll talk about with
[1:27:51] the bubble cars to talk about different
[1:27:53] things like maybe it's a checkerboard
[1:27:54] this time and maybe it's something else
[1:27:56] the next time but then when you come
[1:27:59] down so there's all these different
[1:28:01] details and that's what believed the
[1:28:03] signs upset about there's all these
[1:28:04] change of details but when you come down
[1:28:06] the church age book it's very short they
[1:28:09] just lift lists the ones about you know
[1:28:10] Mussolini Hitler
[1:28:11] and all those and so what they're saying
[1:28:14] is that the say that the Lord changed
[1:28:17] and I'm saying no they didn't change and
[1:28:22] here's what was happening cuz I don't
[1:28:24] have the coaster brother Rams this is
[1:28:27] over 20 years later he's trying and even
[1:28:30] says it on tape he's trying to find the
[1:28:32] original words of the prophecy but he
[1:28:35] just wrote down all that he can remember
[1:28:36] I don't know where I don't know if he
[1:28:39] had a file cabinet I don't know where he
[1:28:40] kept the prophecies so he's he's going
[1:28:43] off a memory and he's listing all these
[1:28:45] details that sometimes the details
[1:28:47] change but he'll say like this is now
[1:28:49] saith the Lord so programs he's giving a
[1:28:52] general statement that what and
[1:28:54] basically this is what he's saying
[1:28:55] whatever was said if the first prophecy
[1:28:57] was the state the lord but he's trying
[1:29:00] his best to remember all the details but
[1:29:02] it's it's not the same but overall
[1:29:06] whatever he was saying in 1933 was thus
[1:29:09] saith the Lord but see believe the sign
[1:29:14] says we'll see there's changes so but
[1:29:16] what they're doing is they're jumping to
[1:29:17] conclusions they're making every word
[1:29:19] that he ever said about 1933 prophecies
[1:29:22] he they're making it all thus saith the
[1:29:24] Lord but they can't do that brother man
[1:29:27] wasn't saying that like one
[1:29:31] got the Maginot Line and the Siegfried
[1:29:33] line mixed up there's two there were two
[1:29:34] different lines they weren't the same
[1:29:37] line there were different walls that
[1:29:39] were built up they weren't so he gets
[1:29:41] them mixed up a little bit and then he
[1:29:42] gets a year's often not every detail was
[1:29:46] thus saith the Lord but whatever that
[1:29:48] first prophecy was in 1933 that was thus
[1:29:51] saith the Lord now I want to share
[1:29:55] something too
[1:29:57] this is just my thought I think I
[1:29:59] preached this here before but you just
[1:30:02] bear with me if I have I thought I had
[1:30:06] another yeah I think it's down here just
[1:30:11] a moment George give me just a second
[1:30:13] now Church I believe yeah I believe even
[1:30:19] there with this quote you have to take
[1:30:20] it as a general thing he says five of
[1:30:24] these things has been perfectly
[1:30:25] fulfilled exactly how Mussolini would
[1:30:28] rise and go to Ethiopia and follow the
[1:30:29] steps and he would be turned to the
[1:30:31] people in shame with the woman many many
[1:30:33] years before it happened perfectly it to
[1:30:34] the dot and it's never failed and it
[1:30:36] won't fail because it's thus saith the
[1:30:38] Lord it's not contrary to these Bible
[1:30:40] it's got to be now
[1:30:43] as I can tell I hope you can tell to
[1:30:47] brother Graham wasn't saying every
[1:30:48] single word he ever said about the seven
[1:30:50] major visions was thus saith the Lord
[1:30:51] it's just like the church ages and the
[1:30:53] seven seals in marriage and divorce the
[1:30:55] thus saith the Lord statements are
[1:30:57] general like he says that marriage and
[1:31:00] divorce he said it's been thus saith the
[1:31:03] Lord all the way through well he didn't
[1:31:04] mean every word he met the revelations
[1:31:06] that were it contained the sermon right
[1:31:09] cuz he said Jacob had at least twelve
[1:31:10] live let's not in the scripture he only
[1:31:12] had four he promised his father-in-law I
[1:31:14] don't have four four wives he promised
[1:31:16] him so he couldn't have more than twelve
[1:31:18] now here's what the point I want to make
[1:31:21] I believe only four of them have been
[1:31:24] fulfilled that could be wrong but I
[1:31:26] believe only four of them and I don't
[1:31:28] believe brother am saying this thus
[1:31:30] saith the Lord I'm just I'm just saying
[1:31:32] it's his opinion five of them were
[1:31:35] fulfilled I believe that one about
[1:31:37] technology is still waiting to be
[1:31:38] fulfilled they might have the cars but
[1:31:42] we need a better road system
[1:31:45] right and that's exact that's what
[1:31:50] brother Ram said but I said he said I
[1:31:52] seen an American he said such progress
[1:31:54] will take place I seen all of me
[1:31:55] automobiles like the egg going down the
[1:31:57] street there's cars go down the highway
[1:31:59] some kind of control they don't have to
[1:32:01] guide it I see an American family
[1:32:02] playing checker in the back of their car
[1:32:04] they've got the car right now
[1:32:05] if they just had the highways to put it
[1:32:08] on the little Volkswagens a perfect egg
[1:32:10] just exactly and it's all the cars can
[1:32:12] you imagine 1933 what the cars looked
[1:32:14] like to now okay so I believe the fifth
[1:32:18] vision still has to be fulfilled I
[1:32:20] believe that the sixth one was a woman
[1:32:24] rising up in America but man said it
[1:32:27] could be a president or vice president
[1:32:28] he said oh I think it could be the Roman
[1:32:30] Catholic Church and the whole nations
[1:32:32] got a bow to her I really thought it was
[1:32:35] here let her Hillary Clinton but I was
[1:32:36] wrong I remember that but see even
[1:32:40] brother Graham says we still don't have
[1:32:42] the highways but other times he says the
[1:32:45] fifth one's perfectly fulfilled so we've
[1:32:47] got to let him be a man so I believe
[1:32:51] we're still waiting for the fifth one to
[1:32:52] be fulfilled I believe technology still
[1:32:54] needs to advance and I think this 5 G's
[1:32:56] gonna do it that's what I think 5g 5 is
[1:33:00] Grace I think the 5g is gonna do it
[1:33:03] because it speeds up information so fast
[1:33:06] now that now those sensors could have
[1:33:09] even more it's a lot stronger than 4G
[1:33:11] it's 5g and they can get all that data
[1:33:13] and now we can have safe cars but they
[1:33:15] got to build the highways and what will
[1:33:17] I did what did Donald Trump run on
[1:33:19] infrastructure one of his major campaign
[1:33:22] promises was to rebuild the
[1:33:24] infrastructure the breaking down
[1:33:26] highways in America and brother have
[1:33:29] said if we just had the highways to put
[1:33:31] it on so that's just my thought church
[1:33:35] that's my thought but Rams
[1:33:40] I've of them were fulfilled now
[1:33:41] personally i just--that's is a I believe
[1:33:43] that's his opinion I believe we're still
[1:33:45] waiting for the fifth one to be
[1:33:46] fulfilled okay so I hope you understand
[1:33:53] this one now I didn't have the time like
[1:33:55] I said I spent all all the day setting
[1:33:57] yesterday on those other ones just to
[1:33:59] have just to kind of search through the
[1:34:00] Scriptures and and then the quotes and
[1:34:02] find all that so to me this one doesn't
[1:34:06] worry me at all
[1:34:07] because brother Rama he may he may never
[1:34:08] have had those original papers I don't
[1:34:11] know if he ever did like I'm still
[1:34:13] waiting for a voice of God to put out
[1:34:14] that black book brother Jose man
[1:34:17] brother I'm brother I always talk about
[1:34:18] a black book that had all his visions in
[1:34:19] the right
[1:34:20] he wrote him down I'm still waiting for
[1:34:21] them to put that out I want her sister
[1:34:24] me to just all threw it away went you
[1:34:25] know because maybe because all the
[1:34:27] fanaticism around I wonder I don't know
[1:34:29] I just wonder because my man said he had
[1:34:32] a photostatic copy of the king of
[1:34:34] England's thank you to him for coming to
[1:34:36] pray for him when he got healed but
[1:34:38] where's that at oh yeah I've heard you
[1:34:43] I've heard things like that too if it is
[1:34:45] I want to see it I don't know if we'll
[1:34:47] get to but see all these things I don't
[1:34:52] know what happened to it but that's okay
[1:34:54] because this doesn't stumble me it's
[1:34:55] brother man just he's trying to remember
[1:34:58] everything that was said in 1933 now the
[1:35:02] Vatican in Rome I don't have this one
[1:35:03] either but this one's on my video of the
[1:35:06] future prophecies of William Branham
[1:35:09] some reason I believe the sign says that
[1:35:11] this has failed brother BAM said the
[1:35:15] Russia will destroy the Vatican in one
[1:35:18] hour thus saith the Lord and they don't
[1:35:19] even give it time to come to pass I
[1:35:21] don't know why they think it's failed
[1:35:24] but brother I never said when it would
[1:35:26] happen so I don't even know how that
[1:35:28] could even be a an argument we have to
[1:35:30] give it time to be fulfilled and then
[1:35:34] Florence she carrion
[1:35:36] brother branham his own tape saying thus
[1:35:37] saith the lord I had a vision she's
[1:35:39] gonna die now believe the sign says well
[1:35:42] that's not hard to predict because the
[1:35:43] doctors only gave her six months to live
[1:35:46] but the I think I shared this last time
[1:35:48] that the thing was all these
[1:35:50] Pentecostals were saying thus saith the
[1:35:52] Lord she's gonna be healed because she
[1:35:54] was only 39 years old so that's why the
[1:35:57] prophecy was so profound because brother
[1:35:59] ram stood up amongst a bunch of people
[1:36:01] that were saying the Lord saying healing
[1:36:03] the Lord sailing healing but man said no
[1:36:05] the Lord told me she's gonna pass that's
[1:36:07] why it was so profound and it come to
[1:36:09] pass but then brother Renton but then
[1:36:12] they criticized well ran for saying but
[1:36:16] it's possible God could still healer
[1:36:17] well it was because of Hezekiah Hezekiah
[1:36:21] thus saith the Lord set your house in
[1:36:23] order gonna die god never said when but
[1:36:27] then isaiah got another though saith the
[1:36:28] lord time he's got 15 more years now
[1:36:32] neither of us say the lord contradicted
[1:36:33] each other they both fit and so it is
[1:36:36] here it fits as well brother and said
[1:36:39] thus saith the lord she's going to die
[1:36:40] but god could change it if they cry out
[1:36:42] but god never did change it she still
[1:36:45] passed away and of course it's on tape
[1:36:48] when program says it before hand he said
[1:36:50] thus saith the Lord it's on tape and
[1:36:52] then before hand and then it happened
[1:36:54] she dies and that's on tape so that is
[1:36:56] one clear prophecy that did come to pass
[1:37:03] now let me check
[1:37:09] real quick here you know recently I got
[1:37:14] a email from a Missouri message pastor
[1:37:16] well he he's a former message pastor
[1:37:18] from Missouri and he asked me a lot more
[1:37:20] questions and I thought if I had time it
[1:37:22] would be beneficial to go over these
[1:37:24] real quick he had eight questions for me
[1:37:26] and I thought I'd share them with you to
[1:37:28] kind of close out this series I think
[1:37:30] that's about all right oh yeah yeah I
[1:37:32] just got a few more things to say after
[1:37:33] that yeah so let me just close it out
[1:37:35] with these things I feel like God has
[1:37:38] given me all the answers that I need I'm
[1:37:41] not struggling with anymore in fact the
[1:37:43] friends names that I mentioned a few
[1:37:45] weeks ago
[1:37:46] I've shared all my findings with them
[1:37:48] and I haven't heard back from them so
[1:37:50] I'm just praise the Lord you know they
[1:37:52] don't want to talk about anymore that's
[1:37:53] wonderful but I know where I stand now
[1:37:54] praise God
[1:37:55] in church we have scripture to back us
[1:37:58] up we have scripture if God gives if God
[1:38:02] tells a prophet he's gonna do something
[1:38:03] and it doesn't happen his life God will
[1:38:05] use somebody else to do it that is thus
[1:38:07] saith the Word of God praise God God's
[1:38:10] Word will never fall to the ground amen
[1:38:14] that's hard for me at church that's hard
[1:38:16] for me to understand God tells Elijah
[1:38:18] you're gonna do that all three and he
[1:38:19] doesn't only does one of them that's
[1:38:21] hard for me to understand but it's
[1:38:22] showing God interprets his word
[1:38:24] differently than you and I he's talking
[1:38:26] about that spirit that ministry behind
[1:38:28] the man amen he's not so much focusing
[1:38:30] on the man he's talking about the spear
[1:38:32] or the movement behind the man amen now
[1:38:43] so I got an email and this guy he was
[1:38:48] very nice but he called me ludicrous he
[1:38:50] said you're ludicrous to believe that
[1:38:53] and I said well I think I'm pretty good
[1:38:55] you did I sound crazy to anybody anybody
[1:38:59] here think I'm crazy raise your hand
[1:39:00] don't know Richard yeah I in love I
[1:39:07] didn't even address it I just let it go
[1:39:09] it's kinda like water off a duck's back
[1:39:11] people think I'm crazy I tell you people
[1:39:14] think I'm crazy for having eight
[1:39:14] children people think I'm crazy for that
[1:39:16] I two people joke around with me this
[1:39:17] week think I'm crazy about but I
[1:39:19] challenge anybody show me one scripture
[1:39:21] where God ever shortened a family
[1:39:23] show me one and I've never had anybody
[1:39:26] out but I've challenged people I've
[1:39:27] never had one now one person ever come
[1:39:29] to me and said oh here's one where God
[1:39:31] God God was blessing people by giving
[1:39:33] them less children I never saw that in
[1:39:35] the scripture that doesn't make you
[1:39:37] popular the message but I've never been
[1:39:39] popular anyway so I don't plan to be
[1:39:41] very popular in a message but the Word
[1:39:44] of God is our absolute now let's go
[1:39:47] through eight just kind of quickly I'm
[1:39:48] just gonna the first one now this is a
[1:39:51] legitimate church brother random said at
[1:39:53] least 10 times that just like Adams
[1:39:56] bride fell Eve Christ bride fell after
[1:40:00] Pentecost how many I'm gonna raise your
[1:40:02] have you ever heard those quotes before
[1:40:03] there's a bunch and so seeing the man it
[1:40:07] kind of accuses me saying Oh see brother
[1:40:10] have said how can a bride member fall
[1:40:11] and I said brother I said that's not
[1:40:14] what brother Branham means brother
[1:40:16] brother means there was people around
[1:40:18] the true bride claiming to be bride that
[1:40:21] Satan tricked them wolves entered in the
[1:40:24] flock and the people that were not born
[1:40:27] again fell away because brother have
[1:40:29] said when you're born again you're
[1:40:30] forever eternity never to fail you're a
[1:40:33] part of God cuz your godson amen
[1:40:36] praise God so I said brother I said you
[1:40:40] pastor I said you're just
[1:40:41] misunderstanding brother Branham brother
[1:40:44] Branham was doing his best to explain it
[1:40:45] in his words but brother man taught a
[1:40:47] bride member can't fall and so when
[1:40:52] brother man said Christ bride fell he
[1:40:54] just means the people claiming to be the
[1:40:56] bride because a Holy Ghost field person
[1:40:59] if you're sealed you're sealed to the
[1:41:01] day of your Redemption you cannot fail
[1:41:03] praise God God's own life God's own ease
[1:41:06] her life has entered into your soul
[1:41:08] praise guy you'll never fail but I said
[1:41:12] just to help you brother I said Hebrews
[1:41:14] 12:15 says a person can fail the grace
[1:41:16] of God someone who's just justified or
[1:41:18] sanctified can fail the grace of God
[1:41:20] because they turn it down and they do
[1:41:22] despite the spirit of grace hebrews
[1:41:25] 10:29 says a person can be sanctified
[1:41:27] but then do despite the spirit of grace
[1:41:30] and trodden underfoot the blood of
[1:41:33] Christ
[1:41:37] so can a bride member fall no can those
[1:41:42] people that are claiming to be bride
[1:41:43] fall yes and that's what I was talking
[1:41:46] about and the type works perfectly
[1:41:50] tuberose a Eve was not sealed by the
[1:41:52] Holy Ghost so she could fall amen
[1:41:54] she had a holy anointing she was
[1:41:56] innocent but it was just an anointing it
[1:41:58] wasn't the seal of the baptism Holy
[1:42:00] Ghost that's why God had to send the
[1:42:02] last Adam amen ha ha Jesus Christ to get
[1:42:06] the baptism of all egos and they said
[1:42:08] I'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost
[1:42:09] amen
[1:42:10] then my bride won't falling in ha ha
[1:42:13] that's right hallelujah thank the Lord
[1:42:16] the second one he attacked me and said
[1:42:18] well I should say attack he disagree
[1:42:20] with me forgive me the second one he
[1:42:24] said the church ages cannot be taught in
[1:42:26] the scripture I said well Colossians
[1:42:29] 1:26 uses the word ages ages is a Bible
[1:42:36] word the Bible said the Holy Ghost was
[1:42:38] hid from ages and from generations and
[1:42:40] now it's real to you Christ in you the
[1:42:42] hope of glory
[1:42:45] so if the Old Testament have ages how
[1:42:47] can the New Testament not have ages of
[1:42:51] course it has ages and he was saying
[1:42:54] that the church the seven letters
[1:42:55] represent seven different conditions a
[1:42:58] church can be in and church I'll agree
[1:43:00] that does make sense that's that's okay
[1:43:02] for what I mean is you can have a church
[1:43:04] that's in an Ephesian age they got their
[1:43:06] first love but then they start falling
[1:43:08] away I mean if if God's Word is true
[1:43:11] then we've gone through that stage when
[1:43:14] we first started in 2006 no doubt we're
[1:43:17] on fire but then some people may have
[1:43:20] lost their fire well I know numerous
[1:43:21] people some people left our church and
[1:43:23] went out into the world they are
[1:43:24] examples of that they lost they lost
[1:43:26] their fire so yes those seven letters
[1:43:30] can be seven different conditions you
[1:43:32] can be in but they can also be prophetic
[1:43:34] praise God to ages and generations and
[1:43:38] especially the Laodicean because out of
[1:43:41] her is the rich and increased with Goods
[1:43:43] and that has to be a church like the
[1:43:46] United States or the Western churches
[1:43:49] because I
[1:43:50] her is spiritual blindness they're
[1:43:52] lukewarm and out of laodicea comes the
[1:43:55] mark of the beast and the United States
[1:43:57] is the beast out of the land in
[1:43:59] Revelation 13 so I told the brother I
[1:44:06] said brother I preached over 100 sermons
[1:44:08] on the book of Revelation and the church
[1:44:10] ages and the seven seals you can teach
[1:44:11] us through the Bible you can teach you
[1:44:14] through history we showed that and so I
[1:44:17] said I agree the names and dates those
[1:44:19] dates from you know 1906 to now that's
[1:44:22] not in the Bible but I said was Martin
[1:44:24] Luther's name in the Bible was John
[1:44:26] Wesley's name in the Bible is your name
[1:44:28] in the Bible no my name is not in the
[1:44:31] Bible but I'll say that this my
[1:44:33] husband's name is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:44:35] amen and I'm a part of him right and the
[1:44:39] whole family is named the Lord Jesus
[1:44:41] Christ in heaven and earth amen
[1:44:43] so see I search I'm saying this to
[1:44:46] brother Jose out this is okay I hope
[1:44:49] when do this okay I believe even the
[1:44:51] years of the church ages those don't
[1:44:53] even have to be thus saith the Lord I
[1:44:54] believe those could be flexible that's
[1:44:57] what I believe I believe those could be
[1:44:59] flexible his mother had never said these
[1:45:01] dates are thus saith the Lord
[1:45:02] he never said that so I think even those
[1:45:05] dates can be flexible what was thus
[1:45:07] saith the Lord was the revelation behind
[1:45:10] the letters praise God the rewards right
[1:45:13] the denunciations all the attributes
[1:45:16] that are written in Scripture all the
[1:45:17] attributes were thus saith the Lord
[1:45:19] praise God the revelation of the seven
[1:45:22] stars in the hand that is a mystery the
[1:45:25] Bible said that is a revelation amen but
[1:45:28] I go is that far as far as saying that I
[1:45:30] don't even the dates to me don't need
[1:45:32] have to be thus saith the Lord but the
[1:45:33] revelations have to be and that's what
[1:45:36] they are the lukewarm and no longer the
[1:45:40] mouthpiece of God left for your first
[1:45:42] love living a name but you're dead that
[1:45:45] has to be the the Sardis Church age with
[1:45:47] Martin Luther they were dead right as
[1:45:50] far as not being born again with her
[1:45:52] trying to live a name of Christ or
[1:45:54] Lutheran but they're dead spiritually
[1:45:57] now Martin Luther has the Baptist the
[1:46:00] Holy Ghost but the people after him may
[1:46:01] not have had it because they denominated
[1:46:04] now he talked about the bridge prophecy
[1:46:07] the municipal bridge and I agreed I said
[1:46:10] brother I said I'm only siding with
[1:46:13] brother Branham I can't prove 16 people
[1:46:16] died there but I said you can't prove 16
[1:46:18] people didn't die there you can't the
[1:46:22] only way you know is if you sat there
[1:46:24] and we're it never went to sleep and had
[1:46:26] a video camera and recorded every single
[1:46:28] day we could watch every single second
[1:46:29] of every single day of every single hour
[1:46:31] you can't they could not prove it so I'm
[1:46:35] just taking sides brother branham same
[1:46:39] thing about the vision of the 300,000
[1:46:41] not as I went through that I said yeah I
[1:46:43] said oh and jorgen said he wasn't a
[1:46:45] first-hand witness I said but neither
[1:46:47] was anybody else I mean the minister's
[1:46:51] brother I was talking about on tape I
[1:46:52] forget their names now Baxter they would
[1:46:54] have been witnesses my wife said she
[1:46:56] heard a quote where an official from
[1:47:00] Bombay told brother Branham it was
[1:47:02] 500,000 so it wasn't even brother ran
[1:47:06] those people in the city telling him
[1:47:08] there's over there's over three hundred
[1:47:10] thousand people here there was five
[1:47:11] hundred thousand so see they were the
[1:47:15] ones at church they can't prove nobody
[1:47:20] can prove he didn't have three hundred
[1:47:21] thousand those meetings nobody can prove
[1:47:22] that so you just got to take his side
[1:47:24] I'm taking sides with God's prophet
[1:47:26] because of the word that he taught and
[1:47:29] the life that he lived and I seen that
[1:47:31] life same life living in me praise God
[1:47:34] that's what I see and he didn't agree
[1:47:41] with my idea about there some are
[1:47:43] conditional promises of God some are
[1:47:45] unconditional but I listed and then he
[1:47:47] said Hananiah when he said two years was
[1:47:49] like brother branham I said no it wasn't
[1:47:51] this doesn't apply to brother Branham
[1:47:54] the 300,000 was fulfilled he just didn't
[1:47:56] understand it the brown bear was
[1:47:58] fulfilled because he never said he'd
[1:48:00] shoot it thus saith the Lord I said we
[1:48:03] have to be very careful what we make
[1:48:05] thus saith the Lord very careful I'll be
[1:48:14] it's like this some people have read
[1:48:16] first Corinthians 7:2 me where Paul says
[1:48:20] this is not the Lord this is me and Paul
[1:48:23] says you know the Virgin's should
[1:48:25] shouldn't marry and everything and some
[1:48:26] people will make that thus saith the
[1:48:27] Lord
[1:48:28] I've had people email me like that
[1:48:29] making that and Paul says it's not the
[1:48:32] Lord it's me
[1:48:33] and yet they'll try to make that now say
[1:48:35] it the Lord like you shouldn't encourage
[1:48:37] your daughters to get ready to be
[1:48:39] married because Paul is Paul's idea
[1:48:41] that's the state the Lord just people
[1:48:45] don't understand it people want to just
[1:48:49] they want to hang on to their revelation
[1:48:51] soap or their false revelation so bad
[1:48:53] but we have to very be very careful what
[1:48:56] we make thus saith the Lord
[1:49:00] and remember don't forget yours I'm just
[1:49:03] showing the ones that are coming against
[1:49:04] remember there's so many others that
[1:49:06] were fulfilled that were absolutely
[1:49:08] right on right especially all the
[1:49:09] discernments and the sister Humes and
[1:49:11] all the four tellings of healings and
[1:49:12] all that that's there's so many that
[1:49:14] were fulfilled okay some of these I
[1:49:21] don't think I'll get into I better I
[1:49:22] better close here oh yeah here's what I
[1:49:24] want to read brother Graham said the
[1:49:25] word that fell out on Pentecost will not
[1:49:28] work today and the brother kind of got
[1:49:30] upset with that statement brother have
[1:49:32] said that in choosing him a bride to
[1:49:34] think as one of his last sermons in 65
[1:49:37] and I said not brother I said you need
[1:49:40] to balance this statement with other
[1:49:42] statements the point brother branham is
[1:49:44] making is that Joel 2 was fulfilled in
[1:49:47] acts 2 right but we are longing we need
[1:49:53] acts 2 and then but we're doing for
[1:49:56] isaiah 25:8
[1:49:57] 1st Corinthians 15:54 and 1st
[1:50:00] Thessalonians 4:16 and 17 to be
[1:50:03] fulfilled the body change scriptures in
[1:50:06] other words mother I'm saying we need
[1:50:07] more than the matches of the Holy Ghost
[1:50:09] we need rapture Scriptures amen
[1:50:11] we need body change scriptures we've got
[1:50:14] the soul baptism by God's grace but we
[1:50:16] need more than that
[1:50:17] we need to fall into the anointing and
[1:50:19] the prophecy of a body change
[1:50:28] and then the brother said did you
[1:50:30] Ram said he he opened up revelations hid
[1:50:33] from the foundation world I said he did
[1:50:36] Paul never knew about the seven seals
[1:50:38] because they were written after he died
[1:50:40] and the revelation program taught about
[1:50:44] those four horse riders I've never seen
[1:50:46] anybody teach anything the same he was
[1:50:49] the first one to say that the white
[1:50:51] horse rider was Antichrist and that it
[1:50:53] was at the beginning of the church age
[1:50:55] Clare's Larkin said it was at the
[1:50:58] beginning of the tribulation which is a
[1:50:59] two thousand year difference that's not
[1:51:02] the same and yet on their site Church on
[1:51:04] their site they say brother man
[1:51:06] plagiarized all the seven seals come on
[1:51:08] I can show to uni didn't is two as a two
[1:51:12] thousand year difference the same thing
[1:51:13] or not it's not see what are they doing
[1:51:17] they're jumping to conclusions because
[1:51:19] they're so upset I know and I know
[1:51:20] people and the message of made mistakes
[1:51:22] and their churches and it's been very
[1:51:23] hurtful has been some evil things happen
[1:51:26] okay let me close let's send our feet
[1:51:28] let me close of this here what's our
[1:51:31] responsibility Church to finish the
[1:51:33] Great Commission redeem the time get
[1:51:36] under the token prove all things amen I
[1:51:40] use this years ago when I preached that
[1:51:42] sermon called waiting for the vision to
[1:51:44] come to pass nor that sermon I
[1:51:45] appreciate how to Habakkuk I preached it
[1:51:46] two sermons here it was right when we
[1:51:49] had a family coming from brother
[1:51:51] Samuels and they stayed for us for two
[1:51:53] services then they left the message
[1:51:54] completely it was so inspired of the
[1:51:58] Holy Spirit because it gave him their
[1:52:00] last I'd be like a last warning Church
[1:52:03] look at this look at all the scriptures
[1:52:04] out of being fulfilled right now this is
[1:52:06] the lamp trimming time this is Malachi
[1:52:10] four time restoring hearts this is
[1:52:13] uniting time praise God this is the move
[1:52:16] is on the bride time this is walking
[1:52:18] with God time like Enoch amen
[1:52:21] this is laying in the prints of the son
[1:52:23] time like Jesus's parable in Matthew 13
[1:52:26] amen
[1:52:27] hallelujah this is preparing for the
[1:52:30] third pour the latter rain time
[1:52:32] hallelujah program said God's great
[1:52:36] mysteries of how it's a secret he kept
[1:52:39] it a secret nobody know nothing about
[1:52:40] even the Angels didn't understand it he
[1:52:42] didn't reveal that's the reason under
[1:52:43] our seventh mystery
[1:52:44] when the 7c was open there was silence
[1:52:46] Jesus when he was on earth they wanted
[1:52:48] to know when he would come he said it's
[1:52:50] not even the Sun himself don't even know
[1:52:52] when it's going to happen see God has
[1:52:54] this all to himself it's a secret and
[1:52:55] that's the reason there was silence in
[1:52:57] heaven for a space of half an hour and
[1:52:59] seven thunders uttered their voices and
[1:53:01] John was even forbidden aright at sea
[1:53:03] the coming of the Lord that's one thing
[1:53:07] he has a review of how he will come and
[1:53:09] when he will come it's a good thing that
[1:53:12] he does it he is showed or revealed it
[1:53:15] in every type that's in the Bible 9
[1:53:20] therefore the entire Bible is the
[1:53:23] revelation of God's mystery in Christ
[1:53:25] hum that entire Bible was an expression
[1:53:27] of one goal that God had one purpose he
[1:53:29] went achieve in the entire Bible and all
[1:53:31] the acts of the believers in the Bible
[1:53:33] has been in type and expressing that
[1:53:35] what God's great goal is and now in this
[1:53:37] last day has revealed it and shows it
[1:53:39] and God's help well you'll see it right
[1:53:42] here this morning what the Lord has had
[1:53:43] in his mind all along and has expressed
[1:53:45] it therefore you can see the great
[1:53:47] meaning of what it's been to know this
[1:53:49] and to try to bring it to the people see
[1:53:51] and then I haven't had went into details
[1:53:53] to try to explain it as God revealed to
[1:53:55] me musicians if you'll come praise God
[1:53:59] now Church if you have any questions
[1:54:01] please don't hesitate to ask I'll be
[1:54:07] happy to take any other questions now
[1:54:09] that to me is the the best answers I
[1:54:11] have at this time
[1:54:13] all the other ones is either just it's
[1:54:16] Broadband's opinion or just it's a minor
[1:54:18] doctrine nothing major I mean like I
[1:54:21] said they have 500 pages like those we
[1:54:24] just went through like maybe five or six
[1:54:26] they have 500 pages of differences with
[1:54:29] brother Branham and some of them are
[1:54:33] genuine concerns like how did he change
[1:54:35] his doctor from here here but the
[1:54:37] reality of it is if there are minor
[1:54:38] doctrines it's okay for him to change
[1:54:40] his daughter he's growing which one of
[1:54:43] us have every doctrine right which one
[1:54:45] of us make no mistakes and we know
[1:54:48] everything at the beginning of our lives
[1:54:49] and we don't need to ever grow an
[1:54:51] understanding and knowledge of the Lord
[1:54:52] none of us do
