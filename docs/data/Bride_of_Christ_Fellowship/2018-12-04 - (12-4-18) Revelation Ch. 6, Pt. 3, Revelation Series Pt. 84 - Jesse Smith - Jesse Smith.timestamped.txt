[23:57] tonight by God's grace I like to go to
[24:00] Revelation chapter 6 I like to continue
[24:03] the eruption theories this is part 84
[24:05] hard to believe 84 parts on the book of
[24:08] Revelation hour 84 Revelation chapter 6
[24:10] part 3 we'll look at more on the sixth
[24:15] seal tonight by God's grace Revelation
[24:25] chapter 6 I've been listening to a 1961
[24:51] sermon brother Graham called the ten
[24:52] virgins 144,000 kind of preparing for
[24:54] Roe nation chapter 7 and found some good
[24:57] thoughts and good quotes in there and a
[24:59] lot of understanding but today we like
[25:02] to look at the sixth seal in chapter 6
[25:04] by the grace of the Lord looking at
[25:07] verse 12 revelation 6 verse 12
[25:17] verse 12 and I beheld when he had opened
[25:19] the sixth seal and lo there was a great
[25:21] earthquake and the Sun became black as
[25:24] sackcloth of hair and the moon became as
[25:27] blood and the stars of heaven fell unto
[25:30] the earth even as a fig tree casteth her
[25:32] untimely figs when she is shaken of a
[25:35] mighty wind and the heaven departed as a
[25:39] scroll when it is rolled together and
[25:40] every mountain and Island were moved out
[25:43] of their places and the kings of the
[25:45] earth and the great men and the rich men
[25:46] and the chief captains and the mighty
[25:48] men and every bondman and every free man
[25:50] hid themselves in the dens and the rocks
[25:53] of the mountains and said to the
[25:55] mountains and rocks fall on us and hide
[25:57] us from the face of him that sitteth on
[26:01] the throne and from the wrath of the
[26:03] lamb for the great day of his wrath has
[26:07] come and who shall be able to stand not
[26:11] what a what a portion of Scripture
[26:12] how many glad that you don't have to see
[26:14] that praise God
[26:17] a man of our heads for word of Prayer
[26:18] never need on your heart just making
[26:20] known unto God Heavenly Father Lord we
[26:22] were come to this most important time of
[26:24] your word dear God let it be a guide to
[26:27] us or let it be life to us that would be
[26:29] a light unto our path Heavenly Father
[26:31] speak to us here tonight you see the
[26:32] hands that have needs Lord God just used
[26:34] me
[26:35] that your spirit Lord guide me Lord to
[26:38] what I must say and do for thy glory and
[26:40] father Lord that you called preaching
[26:44] Lord God the foolishness Lord but yet it
[26:47] brought more life and salvation and
[26:50] deliverance O God to the world it's
[26:52] foolishness
[26:53] Lord but to you it is life and so father
[26:56] we pray you speak life to us here
[26:58] tonight Lord use each and every heart
[26:59] Lord God meet every need God for your
[27:02] glory we ask all these things in Jesus
[27:04] Christ's name the church said Amen god
[27:07] bless yours being to see the praise God
[27:11] so let's look at this thought here I
[27:13] like to look at part three on the sixth
[27:15] seal I won't look at some of the symbols
[27:19] again tonight by the grace of the Lord
[27:22] now some of these things as we said a
[27:24] few weeks ago all of these things in the
[27:27] sixth seal are after the church ages and
[27:29] the sixth seal has
[27:31] a horse rider it has no beast it doesn't
[27:34] have any of that it's just a
[27:35] pronunciation of destruction upon the
[27:38] earth we know that God created the earth
[27:43] in 6,000 years right each day was a
[27:46] thousand years with the Lord and brother
[27:49] Ram said has God had six thousand years
[27:51] Satan had six thousand years to do
[27:54] damage to the earth but God is going to
[27:57] bring it back after that six thousand
[27:58] years here we are at the very end of it
[28:00] we're at the door praise God hey man
[28:03] hallelujah we're close to the rapture
[28:05] Church we're close to the rapture that
[28:07] we've ever been and you know people see
[28:10] the finish line in a race it makes them
[28:12] run a little faster we see the finish
[28:14] line tonight and all to make us run a
[28:15] little faster or to make us want to
[28:18] finish even better for the kingdom of
[28:20] God amen you know I was never a distance
[28:23] runner but I know as a sprinter if I saw
[28:26] that it was the end of it I was going to
[28:27] push with all I had left last year at
[28:30] school I ran a mile with no practice and
[28:32] the last few stretch I just ran with it
[28:34] whatever I had I paid for it the next
[28:37] day but whatever I had left at the end
[28:40] you had to run it in and give it all
[28:41] that you got and that's what we've got
[28:43] to do we've got to keep pressing no
[28:44] matter how hard it gets how busy we get
[28:47] how much life seems like it's
[28:48] overwhelming we've got to realize we're
[28:50] at the end praise God and we've got to
[28:53] give God all that we have for his glory
[28:55] now I want to bring out a few things
[28:57] here just maybe things that you have
[28:58] read here before and notice in verse
[29:03] here it's in verse 12 as soon as the
[29:07] sixth seal opens there's a great
[29:08] earthquake now this might be of course
[29:11] connected to the seventh seal because
[29:13] when the seventh seal opens there's also
[29:15] an earthquake it may be the same
[29:17] earthquake which I believe at this point
[29:20] I believe it'll be the California
[29:22] earthquake I believe it'll be after the
[29:24] rapture but I could be wrong you know it
[29:25] doesn't really matter we have to be born
[29:27] again anyway doesn't matter it doesn't
[29:29] matter when the temples rebuilt and
[29:31] Jerusalem it doesn't matter what
[29:32] earthquake happens in California none of
[29:35] that really matters to us because that
[29:37] shouldn't even pertain to us
[29:38] what should pertain to us is God's
[29:40] kingdom amen
[29:42] those things you know those does we
[29:45] don't even don't even move us you know I
[29:47] see posts online you know about
[29:49] earthquakes and I appreciate people
[29:51] quote or posting them I appreciate
[29:53] people posting things about Israel but
[29:55] really that shouldn't be our motivation
[29:56] our motivation should be the holy spirit
[29:59] inside of us telling us your husband is
[30:02] ready to come and you must get ready for
[30:05] your husband amen it's not a fear that
[30:08] makes us ready it's a love that makes us
[30:10] ready but there's there's a great
[30:13] earthquake and remember there Thursday
[30:15] there's a great earthquake also after
[30:17] the seven sea opens and program tells us
[30:19] the seventh seal is the day and hour of
[30:21] rapture
[30:23] we know that rapture and is buying off
[30:24] the earth so there's a great connection
[30:26] here to earthquakes and then a Sun and
[30:29] Moon in verse 12 there's a connection
[30:31] the Sun becomes black and the moon
[30:34] becomes as blood and these are only seen
[30:39] in two other scriptures acts 2:20 and
[30:43] Joel 2:31 okay so we see that the
[30:48] scripture that these are connected
[30:50] always to Israel the Blood Moon is
[30:53] always connected to Israel amen so you
[30:57] know a couple years ago in 2015 that man
[30:59] the preacher put out the blood moons and
[31:01] and I got to look for a few for a little
[31:03] while and then I talked to a preacher
[31:04] and and I started setting the scripture
[31:06] and then I I was no more worried about
[31:08] it because always the the blood moons
[31:12] are always connected to Israel and so if
[31:15] the Blood Moon was going to happen you
[31:17] know that really had nothing to do with
[31:18] us that was going to deal with Israel
[31:20] and so all the pressure was let off
[31:23] because when we look back to the word
[31:25] the word of God always is a time piece
[31:28] right the Word of God is always a light
[31:31] unto your feet and a light unto your
[31:33] path and so I didn't have to worry about
[31:35] that because the Sun being darkened and
[31:39] the moon is blood always is for Israel
[31:41] amen and so you and I realize that
[31:47] doesn't pertain to us and so we don't
[31:49] even act and we don't need those things
[31:51] our eyes really are on the natural Sun
[31:53] or the natural moon
[31:55] because we know where the spiritual men
[31:56] who praise God hallelujah in Christ our
[32:00] husband is then that is the spiritual
[32:01] son right where they were the spiritual
[32:04] moon and he's the spiritual son praise
[32:06] God
[32:07] we're not worried about the natural so
[32:09] much as we are the spiritual and we're
[32:11] saying son of God Jesus Christ shine and
[32:14] reflect off of my life amen
[32:16] I'm worried about that kind of a Blood
[32:19] Moon that the blood of Jesus Christ is
[32:21] on the bride of Jesus Christ that's the
[32:23] kind of Blood Moon I'm interested in
[32:24] amen and that's how we got to live our
[32:26] lives they may let the blood of Christ
[32:29] clean out our lives and then let his
[32:31] light reflect off of us
[32:34] praise God know the Stars of course are
[32:39] deal with the endtime as well and where
[32:42] they're mentioned in Revelation 8 as
[32:44] well under the fourth trumpet so again
[32:46] we see the six year which is tribulation
[32:48] connected to the fourth trumpet so again
[32:51] not really dealing with the broad of
[32:53] course now mountains and Islands are
[32:56] actually moved out of their places and
[32:58] that tremendous mountains and Islands
[33:01] moved are there places there are so much
[33:05] things happening here to the sixth seal
[33:07] Kings great and rich men even poor men
[33:10] all hide from the face of the Lamb right
[33:14] and they're all asking to be hid from
[33:18] Christ
[33:18] they're asking hide me from Christ isn't
[33:21] it so opposite Church we ought to come
[33:24] to church and saying Lord
[33:25] don't hide me from your face I want to
[33:27] be in your face I am seeking your face
[33:30] and so our attitude should be totally
[33:33] opposite Lord I want to seek your face I
[33:36] don't want to hide from you I want to
[33:37] run to you amen
[33:40] and this is the great day of God's wrath
[33:43] and notice verse 16 and they say and he
[33:46] said unto the mountains of the rocks
[33:47] fall on us and hide us from the face of
[33:49] him that sitteth on the throne and from
[33:51] the wrath of the Lamb isn't it
[33:53] interesting the acts of nature such as
[33:56] an earthquake Stars falling are going to
[33:59] convince every single man Bhandar free
[34:02] that Jesus is pouring out his wrath on
[34:05] the earth amen that's what it's going to
[34:09] take people who are so backslidden that
[34:11] are so hard into the gospel that don't
[34:13] want to hear about righteousness they
[34:15] don't want to hear about a godly life
[34:16] the only thing that's going to shake
[34:18] them up is for the very world they live
[34:21] in to be shook Amen and shaken up but
[34:24] you and I should be different we should
[34:25] be able to hear we should be able just
[34:27] read the Bible pray hear our gospel
[34:29] being preached and it should shake our
[34:32] hearts amen Alleluia
[34:35] we know what we know if it doesn't
[34:38] something's wrong with our lives but man
[34:40] the Bible says we should assign crime n
[34:43] for the bombuh nation seeing people's
[34:45] conditions should make a sign cry you
[34:49] know even denominations I'm an email in
[34:51] this denomination a woman she was trying
[34:53] to correct me on Daniels 70 weeks and I
[34:55] thought well that's fine
[34:56] you know whatever but then she started
[34:58] to email me and I started mention about
[35:00] women preachers she files a woman
[35:01] preacher many ladies she files a woman
[35:04] preacher and we got to talking and but
[35:07] even she can recognize as the
[35:09] denominational Christian she can
[35:11] recognize that the fires out there in
[35:13] California were God's judgment upon the
[35:15] earth and it's enough to shake up her so
[35:18] so her watching TV watching all the you
[35:21] know she said people who even burned to
[35:23] death in their cars it was such an awful
[35:25] destruction and and we know in 1964
[35:30] William Graham said judgment is striking
[35:32] the west coast it's already been
[35:34] pronounced so Christians who follow
[35:36] Jesus Christ know that the west coast is
[35:39] under judgment but even but even
[35:42] denominational Christians can get shaken
[35:45] by those type of things and they're
[35:47] saying oh we got to get ready oh we got
[35:48] ready but it's okay for me to listen to
[35:50] a woman preacher to see it's a false see
[35:54] they're getting shaken by by by fires
[35:56] they're getting shaken by all those
[35:58] things but it's really not shaking them
[36:00] to their core to really examine is
[36:03] everything I believe the Word of God but
[36:06] see we shouldn't we should have the
[36:09] sense of the Holy Spirit should be
[36:11] shaking us not by the things that we see
[36:13] by but the things that we know are going
[36:16] on in the spiritual realms amen in other
[36:19] words the near approaching of Jesus and
[36:21] the closer he gets
[36:22] then the closer we should get to him
[36:24] amen that's what we're gonna end the
[36:26] service with it's just a reminder about
[36:28] the wise virgin and what and how she
[36:30] lives her life now I want to look here
[36:33] and let's look a little deeper at the
[36:35] sixth seal so Malachi I'm gonna switch
[36:39] over here I got a little adapter I just
[36:43] thought I'd show a few things about the
[36:44] sixth seal tonight just as a reminder
[36:48] here by the grace of the Lord now I just
[36:52] do this to kind of help and just explain
[36:55] what brother Branham was bringing out
[36:56] here and I hope it's a help to you by
[36:58] God's grace some of these things that's
[37:03] just a little bit easier to list them
[37:05] out and put them on visuals so you can
[37:07] understand them a little better all
[37:10] right so let's look at this here now
[37:15] well the random says this he says the
[37:17] sink seals the Tribulation Period that's
[37:19] what takes place the ride has gone
[37:21] there's no living creature nothing there
[37:24] to say it God is not dealing with the
[37:26] church no more it's been gone he's
[37:27] dealing with Israel see this is the
[37:29] other side this is when Israel receives
[37:31] the message of the kingdom by the two
[37:33] prophets of revelation 11
[37:34] remember Israel's a nation God's servant
[37:37] nation and when Israel is brought in
[37:39] it'll be a national fair Israel the
[37:41] kingdom age is where David the son of
[37:43] David sits on the throne amen it just
[37:46] kind of struck me Church do you realize
[37:48] the very fact that you and I are here
[37:50] that Christians are here is what is
[37:52] keeping the islands of mountains in
[37:54] their places amen hallelujah
[37:57] the very fact that you love Jesus Christ
[37:59] and you thank God for the blood of Jesus
[38:01] Christ is keeping all the stars in their
[38:04] places amen God is keeping everything in
[38:07] nature in place because he's got a
[38:09] beautiful bride he loves here and he
[38:11] wants to protect her and he wants to
[38:13] make sure all those bride members get to
[38:14] know him and are born again and then
[38:17] he's going to take him off the earth and
[38:18] then all chaos is going to break loose
[38:20] upon the earth but thank God for His
[38:23] mercy for his life amen hallelujah it's
[38:27] his love it's it's your love for him
[38:30] that's holding this entire universe
[38:32] together amen hallelujah
[38:34] that's the power
[38:35] God's love amen glory but RAM says when
[38:40] messiahs cut off the Jew is blinded so
[38:42] we couldn't see them you couldn't see
[38:43] the Messiah and then come and then when
[38:46] the Messiah was cut off then the gospel
[38:48] and grace age come to the Gentile and
[38:50] they come down and God pulled one from
[38:52] here there here there and put them away
[38:54] under the messengers and here they're
[38:56] here they're put under the messengers
[38:58] they sent forth the first messenger and
[39:02] he preached and the trumpet sounded as
[39:04] we pick it up after a while and then the
[39:06] trumpet was declaring war
[39:07] trumpets always denotes war the
[39:11] messenger the angel come on the earth
[39:13] the messenger the hour like Luther's
[39:14] like any of the messages that we've
[39:16] walked or talked of what does he do he
[39:19] arrives and the seal is open reveals
[39:21] trumpet sounds war is declared and away
[39:25] they go
[39:25] and then the messenger dies he seals
[39:27] away this group they're put in and a
[39:29] plague falls upon those who rejected a
[39:31] seat and then it goes on then they
[39:33] organize get another organization all
[39:36] right now he says then here they come
[39:39] out with another power see another power
[39:41] another age of the church another
[39:43] ministry then when he does that along
[39:45] comes God with his ministry then the
[39:47] antichrist comes with his cyanne ties
[39:49] against and they run side by side amen
[39:52] now I want you to skip down to the blue
[39:53] here just about the time the Holy Ghost
[39:55] is revealing himself here in the last
[39:58] days the Antichrist is showing his
[40:00] colors coming through these politics and
[40:02] things and just about the time the
[40:04] Antichrist moves himself fully on the
[40:06] scene God moves himself fully to redeem
[40:10] his own amen
[40:12] Alleluia we appreciate what God has done
[40:15] for his church but we are looking
[40:17] forward to God fully coming on the scene
[40:20] amen Alleluia we appreciate how he's
[40:23] been on the scene but he's coming more
[40:25] fully on the scene just like Satan's
[40:28] coming more fully in the Roman Catholic
[40:29] Church amen and he talks about twins of
[40:34] course Cain Abel Crowe in the dove Judas
[40:37] and Jesus Jacob and Esau now I said
[40:41] that's exactly what plate takes place
[40:43] then God dealt with a Gentile so he took
[40:45] out a people for his name as soon as the
[40:47] dent Gentile Church is taken out he take
[40:49] it up
[40:49] the church and when he did the sleeping
[40:51] verge in the church itself the bride
[40:53] went up and the church itself was put in
[40:55] outer darkness where there's weeping and
[40:57] wailing and gnashing of teeth and the
[40:58] same time the tribulation falls on that
[41:01] people amen we know that's at hand and
[41:05] while the tribulations falling in there
[41:08] comes these two prophets of Revelation
[41:10] 11:2 preach the gospel to them and they
[41:13] preach a thousand one hundred and
[41:15] threescore daysy well that's exactly
[41:17] thirty days in a month like the real
[41:19] calendar has exactly three and a half
[41:21] one years that's Daniels 70th week the
[41:25] last part of this 70th week now let's
[41:28] just review this here now look at this
[41:31] timeline so here is the first two
[41:37] periods of Daniels 70 weeks Daniels 70
[41:40] weeks is in three periods okay the first
[41:43] period is seven weeks which is 49 years
[41:46] and that's the command to rebuild and
[41:49] finish that the temple and so that took
[41:53] place
[41:53] now the second period was of course a
[41:57] lot longer
[41:57] this was sixty-two weeks okay that's 69
[42:01] weeks right there so seven plus 62 is 69
[42:05] weeks and that was 434 years of and that
[42:09] was most of Daniels 70 weeks now until
[42:13] the Messiah begins his ministry so there
[42:16] were 69 weeks until Messiah began his
[42:20] ministry so every with me so far
[42:22] this was Old Testament and here's the
[42:25] time of Christ now Christ didn't begin
[42:28] his ministry there until about 30 ad all
[42:33] right so that's your seven weeks and
[42:36] sixty-two week period there now before
[42:39] once Jesus Christ started preaching 69
[42:42] out of the 70 weeks had been fulfilled
[42:45] all right now the next one here and now
[42:48] Jesus begins his preaching ministry
[42:51] about 30 ad alright now let me see what
[42:56] else I got on here sorry so slow yeah
[42:58] about 30 ad there you go all right now
[43:01] and then they get Daniels seventieth
[43:04] week was when Jesus started preaching
[43:06] all right so now we kind of zoom in a
[43:08] little bit here's Jesus start of his
[43:10] ministry now the Bible says in Daniel
[43:13] that the Messiah was cut off in the
[43:16] first half of the week after the first
[43:18] half of the week which is three and a
[43:20] half years so let's just put that on
[43:22] there so that was Jesus short little
[43:24] ministry of three-and-a-half-year
[43:26] ministry am i think about how powerful
[43:29] jesus did so much in three and a half
[43:31] years the bite of the world can't even
[43:33] contain the number of books that could
[43:35] be written about what he did I talk
[43:37] about a potent ministry talk about a
[43:40] concentrated substance right there my
[43:42] there's so much in that three and a half
[43:44] years you could even write about it and
[43:46] think about John the Baptist Church he
[43:48] was even more he was not as concentrated
[43:50] but he was really concentrated he only
[43:52] had six months of ministry and the Bible
[43:55] said he was the greatest man born among
[43:56] woman till that point greater than David
[43:59] amen
[44:00] greater than Solomon greater than Enoch
[44:03] greater than all these men his ministry
[44:05] was the greatest of any man born of
[44:07] woman in six month period that ought to
[44:10] make us encouraged because member more
[44:12] of God God is fully gonna reveal himself
[44:15] in this last age so that means we're
[44:17] gonna get more of God so that means no
[44:19] matter how short our ministry is our
[44:21] laterade ministry
[44:22] it'll be great in the eyes of God amen
[44:25] because he's fully gonna be with his
[44:28] bride amen that's right
[44:30] that arraign is the rapturing faith
[44:32] ministry if god can do great things in
[44:36] six months what about we'd say a month
[44:38] or however long the latter rain will
[44:39] take place man
[44:40] think about how great that would be now
[44:43] so now because of this God after the
[44:46] seven weeks was the forty-nine years
[44:48] there's the forty-nine years the next
[44:50] one is the sixty-two weeks of 434 years
[44:53] and then you have that little seventh
[44:56] 70th week the first half now after that
[44:59] God has inserted in this part a Gentile
[45:03] church age so God did sixty nine and a
[45:07] half weeks and then he took a break it's
[45:10] like God put at the brake on because
[45:12] he's gonna blind them so he can pull
[45:15] Gentile bride for his wife so he inserts
[45:20] a Gentile church for 2,000 years is that
[45:24] striking how God does it
[45:25] my 69 and a half years or weeks we'd say
[45:30] and then he stops right there so I'm
[45:32] just gonna take a break for 2 to 2 days
[45:34] I'm gonna take a two day break and get a
[45:35] wife Heather there we go
[45:39] and then after he digs his right up in
[45:41] the rapture he goes back to finish that
[45:45] second half of the 70th week that last
[45:48] half which is the Ministry of the two
[45:50] prophets now I don't know when the
[45:53] rebuilding of the temple is going to
[45:55] take place but here's the end of the
[45:56] church age just want to show it to you
[45:58] again
[45:58] to kind of refresh some of these things
[46:00] the next thing we're expecting church is
[46:04] the rapture of the bride
[46:06] the next major taking place after the
[46:11] rapture will become the second half of
[46:13] the seventh week which is called Jacob's
[46:15] trouble it's got some other names too
[46:16] it's called the Great Tribulation Period
[46:18] it's also called the sixth seal now we
[46:24] don't know when the rebuilding will be
[46:27] now the Ministry of Moses and Elijah we
[46:31] believe starts right after the rapture
[46:32] because when the bride goes up Christ
[46:35] the Holy Spirit I'm sorry the the Satan
[46:39] comes down to fill the Antichrist but
[46:41] also God returns to the Jews and these
[46:45] two prophets have a great powerful
[46:46] ministry Moses and Elijah and this is
[46:50] their time to minister for three and a
[46:51] half years now at the end of their
[46:53] ministry they die and they lay in the
[46:55] the streets for three and a half days
[46:57] and then they're raptured up to heaven
[46:59] at that point Jesus comes back so these
[47:04] three and a half years they've been
[47:05] preaching that Jesus the Messiah and
[47:07] they're doing all these supernatural
[47:08] signs at that point Jesus comes back to
[47:11] the remnant the Jews and then after this
[47:14] the 144,000 are sealed
[47:17] they're martyred you have the Vatican
[47:19] destroyed Armageddon fire Millenium
[47:21] there's all these events that take place
[47:23] right after that and like I said we
[47:25] don't know I'm not sure when the temple
[47:27] is going to be rebuilt it
[47:28] you rebuilt before the rapture it might
[47:31] be rebuilt after I'm not quite sure when
[47:34] it's going to take place but it's it's
[47:36] thus saith the Bible the temple is going
[47:38] to be rebuilt and like our brother said
[47:40] on Sunday it's a good it's a good sign
[47:43] when Trump places the embassy back in
[47:46] Jerusalem that's a good sign hey man the
[47:49] temple is not being revealed yet but
[47:51] it's a good sign
[47:52] see God is moving back towards the Jews
[47:55] amen hallelujah
[47:58] now there's many names for the sixth
[48:02] seal that we read tonight
[48:03] it's called Jacob's trouble but the RAM
[48:05] calls of the judgment seal he calls it
[48:08] the interruption of nature he calls it
[48:10] the great the Bible calls the Great
[48:12] Tribulation and Daniel 12 calls it a
[48:15] time of trouble those are all different
[48:19] names for how many of heard those names
[48:20] before those are all the names now
[48:23] brother man told us the order of
[48:25] Revelation the order of Revelation is
[48:28] very important the book of Revelation
[48:30] now he says it's necessary to in order
[48:34] to study the understand understand the
[48:36] rest of Revelation 4 are the church ages
[48:39] come the seals and out of the seals come
[48:43] the trumpets and how the trumpets come
[48:45] the vials like the first burst of a
[48:48] roman candle the church ages come forth
[48:50] with a mighty initial illumination amen
[48:54] without which there could be no further
[48:56] light but once the brilliance of the
[48:59] seven church ages is given by divine
[49:01] revelation light upon light follows
[49:04] until the whole of Revelation opens wide
[49:06] before our wandering eyes are there yeah
[49:11] so our spiritual eyes should be
[49:14] illuminated by the church ages and then
[49:17] once we understand the church ages then
[49:19] they get illuminated by the Seventh Seal
[49:21] so here's the order so you the more you
[49:25] you serve God
[49:27] the longer you serve God the more
[49:29] illumination the more light you see in
[49:31] the book of Revelation hallelujah in
[49:34] Chapter two and three your eyes are lit
[49:36] up with the church ages and then another
[49:39] explosion my eye the seals is that what
[49:42] you felt like did you feel like the Holy
[49:44] Spirit exploded something in your life
[49:46] when you know when you knew the seals ha
[49:48] ha ha hey man that's what my dad says
[49:50] it's like another roman candle and i've
[49:52] seen where one time he shoot off one and
[49:55] he shoot off another you shoot off
[49:56] another until they run out and that's
[49:58] what he says the Book of Revelations
[49:59] like one shot after another shot and
[50:01] then the trumpets and then the rolls are
[50:04] kind of together and then the plagues
[50:06] and then the vials each one of these are
[50:09] another mighty illumination babe n-now
[50:12] what is light for light is supposed to
[50:15] expose darkness amen light is supposed
[50:18] to give you vision to see in church
[50:22] that's what these are see we're not just
[50:25] you know we're not preaching this just
[50:26] to know about it we're preaching this so
[50:28] the light of the Holy Spirit will light
[50:31] up your spiritual eyes so that you'll
[50:33] choose to follow Jesus Christ knowing
[50:37] the Bible said knowing therefore the
[50:39] terror of the Lord we should serve God
[50:41] more sincerely let me look that up real
[50:44] quick that description just came to my
[50:48] heart knowing the terror of the Lord let
[50:50] me look that up I know it's a New
[50:51] Testament scripture then we know offhand
[50:55] right where it's at
[50:56] okay okay second Corinthians five 11 you
[50:59] got your Bibles snicker in these if I
[51:01] have eleven so when we're preaching on
[51:06] the sixth seal on a night like tonight
[51:07] you know the last three services this is
[51:09] not a time for us to spiritually check
[51:11] out now now it's true it doesn't apply
[51:13] to us but brother Branham said its
[51:15] illumination this these things were
[51:18] preaching on with the sixth seal this
[51:20] should illuminate our eyes - and that
[51:24] should help us to see our lives more
[51:26] clearly and help us examine how we're
[51:28] living our lives because who here wants
[51:32] to be a part of the Great Tribulation
[51:34] who wants to see people who wants to go
[51:36] hiding is there is there any caves in
[51:39] Akron I know there's I know there's
[51:41] parks that have little caves cuz we went
[51:43] in the icebox one time now Lydia was a
[51:45] long time ago as a long time ago but we
[51:48] went to a park and they've got little
[51:49] ice caves can you imagine that the
[51:52] tribulation people are going to try to
[51:53] go hiding in those parks up I think it's
[51:55] Yoga Valley National Park I'm not
[51:58] mistaken they're gonna go hiding in
[52:00] their Bible said they're gonna hide in
[52:01] their say hide us from the wrath of the
[52:03] Lamb
[52:04] see these are illuminations to us it's
[52:08] supposed to light up our lives it's
[52:10] supposed to expose any sinner lives so
[52:12] we get all the sin of our lives out so
[52:14] we seek God's face rather than running
[52:17] from God's face sänger this is 5:11 so
[52:21] spiritually we don't think a break when
[52:24] we hear about you know preaching about
[52:26] the Jews it's supposed to be light to be
[52:28] a light unto our path now look at verse
[52:35] let's go to 10 verse 10 for we must all
[52:39] appear before the judgment seat of
[52:40] Christ now that's not the white throne
[52:43] judgment that's the judgment for rewards
[52:45] that every one may receive the things
[52:48] done in his body according whether it be
[52:51] good or bad like I love that saying I
[52:55] heard it in a worldly movie but whatever
[52:56] you do in life echoes in eternity that
[52:58] is so true I know it was from a filthy
[53:01] movie when I was a sinner but I don't
[53:03] watch anymore but that's true that's
[53:04] actually your whatever you did in your
[53:06] life will echo and eternity whether good
[53:10] or bad oh god help us
[53:12] to do what we're supposed to be doing in
[53:14] this life amen let us do what's right in
[53:17] this life right now like the Bible says
[53:22] let's do good okay it's very simple
[53:25] let's do good things instead of bad
[53:26] things praise God
[53:28] verse 11 so Paul says we're all going to
[53:34] stand before the judgment seat of Christ
[53:36] and in verse 11 knowing therefore the
[53:38] terror of the Lord we persuade men but
[53:44] we are made manifest unto God and I
[53:46] trust also are made manifest in your
[53:50] consciousness see your life the word
[53:52] manifest means to appear or to show your
[53:55] life appears the life that you live
[53:57] appears to sinners it appears to
[54:00] Christians the life that we live is
[54:02] manifested and not only to them Church
[54:05] the life we the real life we live is
[54:07] manifested to God
[54:09] and so because we know the terror of the
[54:11] Lord we should be persuading others to
[54:14] serve God praise the Lord amen persuade
[54:18] him because we know the terror of the
[54:21] Lord as we said it doesn't take a
[54:24] California wildfire to move us it
[54:28] doesn't take an earthquake to move us in
[54:30] Anchorage last week a 7.0 that doesn't
[54:33] move us we should already be moved into
[54:35] serving God amen we should be daily
[54:38] moved into surrendering things in our
[54:39] lives over to Christ amen hallelujah
[54:46] there you go now that's the order and
[54:49] program said each one is another
[54:51] illumination that's supposed to make our
[54:54] eyes illuminated and see what God is
[54:56] going to do remember the Bible said that
[54:59] God will only show what he does to his
[55:02] friends how we know that Jesus said
[55:04] because you're my friends he said I no
[55:06] longer call you servants I call you
[55:09] friends because that's because a master
[55:11] doesn't tell his servants what he does
[55:12] but a master will tell his friends what
[55:15] he does hey this is God telling us what
[55:18] he's going to do and he's telling us
[55:20] because we're his friends amen
[55:23] hallelujah I'm glad to know about these
[55:27] things so I can preach on and persuade
[55:29] people that will listen on YouTube or
[55:31] that will listen try to persuade people
[55:33] to flee sin and run to Christ amen now
[55:38] program says this here now this is in
[55:42] 1961 by the way he's closing he said the
[55:46] seven seals the seven trumpets the seven
[55:48] vials the three woes the woman in red
[55:50] casting out the devil or the red dragon
[55:52] comes between these times during the
[55:55] Great Tribulation Period I want you to
[55:58] see their brother and we'll talk over a
[56:00] course of numerous years that all these
[56:03] things we know the fifth seal the sixth
[56:06] seal the seven trumpets the vows all
[56:09] these events take place during this
[56:11] Tribulation Period now let's get
[56:17] under the Green Man Star Mothers seven
[56:19] vials he said now they don't happen
[56:20] right at the same time following the
[56:23] plagues following the church ages just
[56:25] the same because it is all sealed up
[56:27] into that one book everything and
[56:29] everything happens just in rotation and
[56:31] one goes right into the other and other
[56:33] into the other amen the church they just
[56:37] rotate one into another
[56:39] after the trumpets and the lows and then
[56:42] the plagues and the vows it just flows
[56:44] it's like that the snowballing downhill
[56:48] effect once it starts it's going to be
[56:52] impossible to stop it's just going to go
[56:55] from one into another but thank God for
[56:59] these years of mercy thank God for these
[57:02] years of long-suffering now we should
[57:05] not sin same I wish God would judge
[57:06] these sinners and these homosexuals and
[57:08] these transgenders we shouldn't be like
[57:11] that we should say God have mercy God
[57:13] thank you for long-suffering because
[57:15] once that bull gets rolling then he
[57:18] that's filthiest filthy still may God
[57:21] have mercy may he keep being
[57:23] long-suffering I know it's hard to live
[57:25] here I know it's a Tain's either but
[57:27] we're supposed to be born together the
[57:28] Holy Ghost and when you're born again
[57:30] the Holy Ghost
[57:31] you're not even attracted to these taste
[57:33] of the world amen you don't flirt with
[57:35] the devil you don't program these things
[57:37] in the world we know it's hard we know
[57:38] we're still in flesh but we should pray
[57:40] for mercy we should be thankful that
[57:42] God's long-suffering because once it
[57:44] starts it's not going to stop I touched
[57:48] you know if the opposite is true for us
[57:49] once Jesus started the Holy Ghost in my
[57:51] life it's got rolling and it just
[57:53] rotates and the glory and faith in faith
[57:56] amen hallelujah because remember he
[57:59] leads you into all truth that's what the
[58:02] Holy Ghost was given for amen so the
[58:06] opposite is true for us amen
[58:08] it's just going to get more and more
[58:09] glorious as we see that Day approaching
[58:12] amen hallelujah now I tried to put these
[58:17] order of these events in order Church I
[58:19] don't know the exact time they'll break
[58:23] the Jewish and Roman Covenant I'm not
[58:25] sure program gives us a few little hints
[58:28] there
[58:30] I'm not sure and I'm not sure when the
[58:32] rebuilding of the temple is gonna be and
[58:34] I'm not actually even sure now when
[58:36] Armageddon is going to be because
[58:37] there's different quotes brother BAM
[58:38] says different things but it seems like
[58:41] this it seems the order the first is the
[58:43] rapture and then we have the Ministry of
[58:45] the two witnesses let's go to Revelation
[58:47] 11 let's read some of that here let's
[58:50] remind ourselves what's going to be
[58:51] happening for three and a half years
[58:58] remember this is after he's taken his
[59:00] his lovely wife
[59:01] off the earth these are the things he's
[59:03] going to do revelation 11 3 and I will
[59:06] give power unto my two witnesses and
[59:07] they shall prophesy a thousand two
[59:10] hundred and threescore days clothed in
[59:13] sackcloth that's three and a half years
[59:14] if you divide the 30s by or the the days
[59:17] by 30 verse 4 these are the two olive
[59:22] trees and the two candlesticks standing
[59:24] before the god of the earth that
[59:26] Zechariah chapter 4 and if any man will
[59:29] hurt them look at this fire proceedeth
[59:32] out of their mouth I love this now
[59:35] Church this just proves Satan can't hurt
[59:38] you or do anything to you until it's
[59:41] God's time for you to go amen
[59:44] God said I'm giving these two preachers
[59:46] three and a half years and if anything
[59:49] stands before them fire is going to
[59:51] proceed out of their mouths or whatever
[59:53] says it's not literal fire it's the word
[59:56] yeah so when enemies come against and
[59:59] also get to do and speak the word Church
[1:00:02] that's all you and I got to do amen
[1:00:04] enemy or trial comes against us we've
[1:00:06] just got to speak the word because the
[1:00:08] word is like fire amen exactly right and
[1:00:12] that proves as long as we're here as
[1:00:14] long as God wants us here we should be
[1:00:16] able to speak the word and watch the
[1:00:18] word devour up all of our enemies
[1:00:20] it might take a week it might take a
[1:00:22] month it might take years but the Word
[1:00:25] of God will not fail that fire is going
[1:00:28] to burn amen
[1:00:29] this summer I burnt a bunch of little
[1:00:33] trees that were sprouting up and I
[1:00:35] burned them the very day that I cut them
[1:00:37] which is not a good idea
[1:00:39] and it took a little longer you know
[1:00:41] earlier in us in the summer I burned all
[1:00:43] these dry
[1:00:44] ones and they burnt like that it was so
[1:00:46] fast and I just think I wasn't really
[1:00:49] thinking about I was just trying to get
[1:00:50] rid of and try to cut him down and so I
[1:00:52] wouldn't hit my head on him when I'm
[1:00:53] mowing you know and all these things and
[1:00:56] it took a while but Malachi came out and
[1:00:58] he started helping me out and it was
[1:01:00] then the instant burn but if I let it
[1:01:02] sit there and keep working with it
[1:01:04] pretty soon that fire is going to
[1:01:06] consume it and that's what we have to
[1:01:08] understand about God's Word pretty soon
[1:01:11] this word is going to start moving
[1:01:13] things amen
[1:01:14] pretty soon this fire is going to take
[1:01:17] its effect it might not happen
[1:01:19] instantaneous that's why God gave divine
[1:01:22] healing and miracles as two separate
[1:01:23] gifts America was instant
[1:01:26] but our faith should be just as strong
[1:01:27] in God's Word even if it's not an
[1:01:30] instant miracle we should self
[1:01:31] confidence that fires going to burn it's
[1:01:35] going to burn give it just give it some
[1:01:37] time if we believe the word if the words
[1:01:40] been spoken if their words then preach
[1:01:42] then let the fire burn it Amen give it
[1:01:46] some time
[1:01:47] praise the Lord the givers let's finish
[1:01:52] verse 5 fire proceedeth out of their
[1:01:53] mouth and devoureth their enemies and if
[1:01:55] any man will hurt them he must in this
[1:01:57] manner be killed by the Word of God
[1:02:01] verse 6 these have power to shut heaven
[1:02:04] that it rain not in the days of their
[1:02:06] prophecy can you imagine a three and a
[1:02:08] half year drought in Israel you think
[1:02:12] that's going to get people's attention
[1:02:13] and church that's not even for mercy
[1:02:16] it's for judgment so this is gonna mean
[1:02:19] that they're gonna have three and a half
[1:02:21] years of no rain right cuz he lies is
[1:02:24] gonna call for it just like he did in
[1:02:26] his day praise God and it's a sign of
[1:02:30] judgment that's what's going to happen
[1:02:33] and then it says and have power over
[1:02:36] waters to turn them to blood and to
[1:02:38] smite the earth with all plagues as off
[1:02:41] as they will and that's Moses's ministry
[1:02:45] right
[1:02:45] Moses turned the water to blood and then
[1:02:48] he brought forth as many plagues as he
[1:02:50] will now the best part of this is that
[1:02:52] as as many as he will and any true
[1:02:56] servant of God
[1:02:58] do it on his will he'll only do it on
[1:03:00] God's will and that's what you and I
[1:03:03] should be to we should only speak things
[1:03:05] we should only try to to ask God or
[1:03:09] speak to the mountain if we feel led of
[1:03:12] the Holy Spirit because if not it
[1:03:15] becomes a selfish thing it becomes a
[1:03:17] Santa Clause affair it becomes a errand
[1:03:20] boy God becomes an errand boy God's not
[1:03:23] our errand boy amen
[1:03:24] we are God's errand boys like that where
[1:03:28] the servants say so see they speak as
[1:03:31] often as they will
[1:03:32] but any true man of God any true
[1:03:34] daughter of God will only speak when God
[1:03:36] wills those are the only kind of people
[1:03:40] he can trust with his word anyway they
[1:03:42] won't try to create something or work
[1:03:43] themselves up or try to be a show-off or
[1:03:45] jump off a pinnacle the angels will
[1:03:47] catch me oh that's nonsense
[1:03:49] you must wait till God says it's time
[1:03:52] that's like about their testimony now
[1:03:56] for that verse 7 and when they finish
[1:03:58] their testimony the Beast that ascends
[1:04:00] out of the bottomless pit shall make war
[1:04:01] against them and shall overcome them and
[1:04:03] kill them
[1:04:05] of course that's the that's the devil
[1:04:08] now so I hope you have that you have the
[1:04:12] death and then their rapture of the two
[1:04:13] witnesses after that Jesus returns to
[1:04:17] birth the 144,000 Jews remember the
[1:04:22] whole three and a half years they're
[1:04:23] preaching about Messiah they're
[1:04:25] preaching about son and brother branham
[1:04:26] said that the Jews can't deny it because
[1:04:28] the very one who wrote the law is now
[1:04:30] not pointing them to the law but
[1:04:32] pointing the artless are not exactly to
[1:04:34] the law but pointing to the law being
[1:04:36] fulfilled that the law was fulfilled
[1:04:38] Isaiah 53 was Jesus Christ genesis 3:15
[1:04:43] the very one who wrote at moses and said
[1:04:45] there's the one who bruise the Serpent's
[1:04:47] head a muhammed
[1:04:48] they can't deny it the very one who was
[1:04:51] raptured elisha the very prophet here
[1:04:54] we'd say the very amazing prophet who
[1:04:56] was raptured he's not pointing them to
[1:04:58] the law he's pointing them to Jesus
[1:05:00] Christ praise God and that's the one I
[1:05:04] put on Facebook this morning Jesus
[1:05:06] didn't hear from I'll say Jesus heard
[1:05:09] from two theophanies
[1:05:11] on Mount Transfiguration he heard from
[1:05:14] Moses and Elijah about Transfiguration
[1:05:17] now brother Aaron says you heard from
[1:05:19] your theophany I believe it as far as I
[1:05:22] believe it might be right
[1:05:24] but I don't have a scripture for that
[1:05:25] yet but I do have scripture for people
[1:05:27] hearing from other peoples theophanies
[1:05:28] praise god or gods theophany but i can't
[1:05:33] find where somebody hears from their own
[1:05:34] theophany I can't find that yet in
[1:05:36] Scripture so let me know if you find one
[1:05:37] can I preach it in 2015 and no one's
[1:05:40] brought one to me yet that's okay keep
[1:05:42] searching the scripture so Jesus heard
[1:05:44] from two theophanies and the Bible said
[1:05:47] they talked to him about his decease on
[1:05:49] the cross so what does that tell us God
[1:05:52] has to send sometimes theophanies God
[1:05:54] has to send messengers from heaven to
[1:05:56] prepare us for what's to come amen
[1:06:00] hallelujah now for us many times God now
[1:06:03] I say like this God is going to send
[1:06:05] bromances gonna send us theophanies he
[1:06:08] said we're gonna see our loved ones rise
[1:06:09] before the rapture amen hallelujah
[1:06:13] praise God so just like Jesus before his
[1:06:16] his great victory before jeez got his
[1:06:20] great victory he saw theophanies brother
[1:06:22] says we'll see theophanies as well
[1:06:23] because the dead in Christ will rise
[1:06:25] first Oh hallelujah thank God amen and
[1:06:31] obably that's what's gonna be the main
[1:06:32] theme thing for rapturing faith when we
[1:06:35] see people that are dead amongst us oh
[1:06:38] now all things are possible to them that
[1:06:43] believe well we see James Browning and
[1:06:47] not he's not an old man he's a young man
[1:06:51] now you're gonna have some faith in
[1:06:53] church but that's how God does it God
[1:06:57] sends the faith at the time you need it
[1:07:00] is that right it's always in God's
[1:07:03] timing season you know as much as we
[1:07:05] fast very much as we try to amen and
[1:07:07] much as we try to it's really not gonna
[1:07:09] happen until it's God's time for it to
[1:07:11] happen but he wants to see people that
[1:07:14] will prepare for it amen hallelujah
[1:07:17] you don't want to see lazy Christians he
[1:07:19] wants to see people that are prepared
[1:07:21] and wanted and are making ready for it
[1:07:24] so when it comes it
[1:07:25] happened to them praise God that's right
[1:07:30] just as he sought the offerings before
[1:07:32] his victory we're gonna see him - amen
[1:07:36] and then after the 144,000 get born
[1:07:39] again then first four trumpets sound
[1:07:42] because of Revelation 7 let's read at
[1:07:44] revelation 7 one two and three I want
[1:07:47] you to really catch this here I read
[1:07:48] this the last time back in October when
[1:07:50] I preached on the sixth seal it's been a
[1:07:52] month or almost of the month and a half
[1:07:54] revelation seven one two and three
[1:07:56] I want you remember these scriptures
[1:07:59] here let me try it let me give me give
[1:08:02] me 15 more minutes okay I can finish up
[1:08:03] here
[1:08:03] and after these things I saw four angels
[1:08:06] standing on the four corners of the
[1:08:08] earth holding the four winds of the
[1:08:09] earth that the wind should not blow on
[1:08:11] the earth nor on the sea nor on any tree
[1:08:14] and I saw another angel ascending from
[1:08:17] the east having the seal of the Living
[1:08:18] God and he cried with a loud voice to
[1:08:20] the four angels to whom it was given to
[1:08:22] hurt the earth and the sea saying hurt
[1:08:25] not the earth neither the sea nor the
[1:08:27] trees till we have sealed the servants
[1:08:29] of God in their foreheads so God is not
[1:08:33] going to hurt the earth God is not going
[1:08:36] to punish the earth until his children
[1:08:38] are born again of the Holy Ghost now
[1:08:41] that shows God's mercy does it not God
[1:08:43] is not gonna pour out wrath until he
[1:08:45] pours out his blessing first praise God
[1:08:48] in other words God is gonna make sure
[1:08:51] before he pours out wrath God is gonna
[1:08:53] make sure all those that want the Holy
[1:08:55] Ghost have the Holy Ghost amen
[1:08:58] out of the video like I said there won't
[1:09:00] be one person left behind the rapture
[1:09:02] that really wanted to be in the rapture
[1:09:04] because God will give everybody the
[1:09:07] desire of their heart because it's a
[1:09:10] free will offering he said anyone this
[1:09:12] thirsty let him come and drink of the
[1:09:13] Holy Ghost waters of life freely it's a
[1:09:17] free offering it's a free invitation
[1:09:19] everybody that wants to come can come
[1:09:21] that's exactly right
[1:09:23] now with that in mind see God can't hurt
[1:09:27] the trees of the earth until they're
[1:09:28] sealed with the Holy Ghost now go to
[1:09:31] chapter eight verse seven
[1:09:37] now this is why the trumpets can't sound
[1:09:39] so after the 144,000 get born again and
[1:09:42] 144,000 can get born again until after
[1:09:44] the two witnesses finished their
[1:09:46] testimony now look at verse seven and
[1:09:51] the first angel sounded this to the
[1:09:53] trumpet and there followed hail and fire
[1:09:56] mingled with blood and they were cast
[1:09:57] upon the earth and the third part of the
[1:09:59] trees was burnt up and all the green
[1:10:01] grass was burnt up to see that the angel
[1:10:05] said don't touch the trees until the
[1:10:08] 144,000 are sealed and then God seal
[1:10:10] them and now the first trumpet can blow
[1:10:12] mmm
[1:10:14] and now the trees a third of them are
[1:10:17] destroyed a third of the trees on the
[1:10:20] earth are destroyed by the first trumpet
[1:10:22] but God's not gonna hurt a one of them
[1:10:24] until after the 144,000 are born again
[1:10:27] see that
[1:10:29] so that church to me this has to be the
[1:10:31] order of the events and then after the
[1:10:35] trumpets come the woes and the plagues
[1:10:38] and the valves as we said earlier praise
[1:10:43] God
[1:10:43] does that make sense everybody it makes
[1:10:47] sense okay all right now here's the
[1:10:51] quote where it sounds like like I don't
[1:10:54] know when the arm again is gonna take
[1:10:56] place but man said this very time the
[1:10:58] Antichrist covenant that the Jews were
[1:11:01] made with Rome will be broken Rome and
[1:11:04] her allies will send their troops to
[1:11:06] destroy off the god-fearing we're
[1:11:08] abiding Jews they're gonna make a
[1:11:09] covenant after the rapture I think it's
[1:11:11] gonna be a 7-year covenant but they're
[1:11:13] gonna break in the middle of the week
[1:11:14] again and then Rome is going to come and
[1:11:17] compass itself around Jerusalem now most
[1:11:20] you don't remember when I preached on
[1:11:21] the Book of Daniel we covered that I
[1:11:23] think it was in Daniel chapter 9 or 8 if
[1:11:25] I'm not mistaken the Bible said that the
[1:11:28] Antichrist will gather all those armies
[1:11:30] and the pump right down Jerusalem but
[1:11:32] Jesus is going to protect him the man
[1:11:36] said but as they come against the city
[1:11:38] Jerusalem to destroy it there will
[1:11:40] appear in the heavens the sign of the
[1:11:42] coming of the Son of Man with his mighty
[1:11:44] armies to destroy them who have been
[1:11:48] destroying the earth with the enemy
[1:11:50] repulsed
[1:11:51] Jesus then comes and presents himself to
[1:11:53] the hundred forty-four thousand having
[1:11:56] seen his mighty acts of salvation they
[1:11:59] have come to know his power but also
[1:12:00] seeing is to wounds and not rejected him
[1:12:03] even to that moment causes them to cry
[1:12:06] out in the agony of terror and fear even
[1:12:08] as their brethren of old when they stood
[1:12:10] before Joseph sore being sore afraid
[1:12:13] that they would be killed but as Joseph
[1:12:16] said don't be angry with yourselves it's
[1:12:17] all right
[1:12:18] God was in at all he did it to preserve
[1:12:21] life he blinded you Jews to preserve the
[1:12:26] life of the Bride of Christ even so will
[1:12:30] Jesus speak peace and love to them oh
[1:12:33] how rich is the love of God how deep is
[1:12:36] the love of God amen
[1:12:39] he blinded them to get a wife and then
[1:12:42] he comes back to the ones he blinded and
[1:12:45] he's speaking with peace and love to
[1:12:46] them oh what a what a sweet Savior our
[1:12:49] Lord is oh what loving what a loving
[1:12:53] Savior that we serve tonight Oh glory
[1:12:57] now for times sake um
[1:13:00] I'm not going to get to this one but but
[1:13:03] brother BAM said the six seals are in
[1:13:05] Matthew 24 I preached a little bit back
[1:13:08] in October but let's let's do this let's
[1:13:11] go to somewhere else let's go to Matthew
[1:13:13] 25 real quick let's read that
[1:13:20] the ten virgins again I know we've read
[1:13:22] it many times let's read it again by the
[1:13:25] grace of the Lord because I just want to
[1:13:31] say a last few comments here with the
[1:13:33] message tonight remember we're supposed
[1:13:37] to be illuminated our eyes should be
[1:13:39] should be sensing the light that comes
[1:13:42] out of the seals we should say my that's
[1:13:45] so bright like an explosion of a
[1:13:47] firecracker children remember the
[1:13:49] firecrackers we had this summer I mean
[1:13:51] they were really really not real
[1:13:53] firecrackers they were real child
[1:13:56] friendly frog crackers like the little
[1:13:59] ones that burned down sparklers there
[1:14:02] you go
[1:14:02] I can't even think of the little word
[1:14:03] sparklers but think of how bright
[1:14:06] children think remember how you like to
[1:14:08] wave them and it looks like you see
[1:14:09] lines that kind of stay in the sky
[1:14:11] think about the illumination of the
[1:14:13] fireworks and my man said that's what
[1:14:15] this the sixth seal should be that's
[1:14:17] what all the seals should be a mighty
[1:14:19] illumination Matthew 25 verse 1 then
[1:14:27] shall the Kingdom of Heaven be likened
[1:14:28] unto ten virgins which took their lamps
[1:14:30] and went forth to meet the bridegroom
[1:14:32] and five of them were wise and five were
[1:14:35] foolish they that were foolish took
[1:14:38] their lamps and took no oil with them
[1:14:40] but the wise took oil and their vessels
[1:14:43] and with their lamps I just want them to
[1:14:47] stop and make a point here in this
[1:14:50] parable can everybody see how important
[1:14:52] it is that before you go out to meet the
[1:14:55] bridegroom you've got to take oil with
[1:14:57] you that's something I think with this
[1:15:00] parable we often forget this is all
[1:15:03] about preparation in church you know
[1:15:08] every every Church is going out to see
[1:15:10] the rapp every Church once Jesus to come
[1:15:12] back supposedly they're all going out to
[1:15:15] meet him oh we're making ready oh Jesus
[1:15:18] coming back soon oh it's the end of the
[1:15:19] world but only the lies are actually
[1:15:24] before they go out oh I better go get
[1:15:26] some more oil better get that oil better
[1:15:30] make sure I got it the fools just walk
[1:15:32] on sand oh yeah he'll come any time yeah
[1:15:34] let's go out but the wise they make a
[1:15:36] few extra steps right and if you're a
[1:15:39] wise Packer you'll take a few extra
[1:15:41] minutes to pack your bags a little bit
[1:15:43] more right just don't throw everything
[1:15:45] in there if you're a really wise planner
[1:15:49] you'll make sure oh yes he might delay
[1:15:52] the coming of the husband might be a
[1:15:55] little late longer I think I better take
[1:15:58] some extra oil before I go out there and
[1:16:01] and I would just hate I would just hate
[1:16:04] it if I ran out of oil then I couldn't
[1:16:07] be a part of the procession at church
[1:16:10] that's what we've got to do spiritually
[1:16:12] we've got to make sure there's no way
[1:16:15] I'm going to miss this wedding
[1:16:17] perception I'm gonna I'm gonna pack
[1:16:21] extra or in fact I'm gonna take an extra
[1:16:23] bag put extra oil in that bag amen I got
[1:16:28] the bag of my clothes I maybe got you
[1:16:30] know change your clothes I got my
[1:16:31] toothbrush in there I've got my my comb
[1:16:33] in there to comb my hair I've got an
[1:16:34] extra set of shirt and I got a jack in
[1:16:36] case it gets chilly but I'm gonna take
[1:16:38] an extra bag just to make sure it's
[1:16:41] filled with oil so they have the
[1:16:43] bridegroom tears I'll have extra oil to
[1:16:46] burn I don't have to worry about going
[1:16:48] at the last minute to get oil I'm gonna
[1:16:50] make sure I've got plenty of oil amen so
[1:16:55] the emphasis or the the major the major
[1:17:00] action for the wise is that they took
[1:17:02] more time to prepare and the foolish
[1:17:07] they realized it may be a longer wait
[1:17:10] than I think and I've got to really make
[1:17:12] sure that I've got the goods and church
[1:17:17] of the natural I'm not much of a packer
[1:17:19] Lydia packs our bags when we travel she
[1:17:22] does a great job I think Malachi started
[1:17:23] our acacia they do a good job and very
[1:17:27] rarely do they ever forget clothes but I
[1:17:30] can count about five times on my hand on
[1:17:32] the trips I've made preaching where I
[1:17:33] forgot either my suit my shoes my socks
[1:17:38] now I've got to go to Walmart the night
[1:17:40] before I preach and by the the cheapest
[1:17:42] brown shoes I can find because I'm
[1:17:47] that's the last thing I think about and
[1:17:50] that's my failure just in the natural
[1:17:53] it's like well I'll just you know I'll
[1:17:55] wait to the end but spiritually I'm the
[1:17:59] total opposite
[1:18:02] spiritually I know before I go out I
[1:18:05] know I've got to spend more time
[1:18:07] prepared more time praying more time
[1:18:10] making sure I'm born again I got to
[1:18:12] spend more time than my Bible I guess
[1:18:15] spend more time it says I can spend more
[1:18:18] time searching my heart I got to spend
[1:18:20] more time on that than I spent on
[1:18:22] anything else before I start telling
[1:18:25] people well I'm gonna be in the rapture
[1:18:27] now if anybody's give me the rapture
[1:18:29] it's me gonna be in the rapture before I
[1:18:31] start saying like that I'm gonna make
[1:18:33] sure I've packed up plenty of oil
[1:18:35] beforehand the church you don't know
[1:18:38] what trials are going to come in through
[1:18:39] your life people can say whatever they
[1:18:42] want but actions speak a lot louder than
[1:18:44] words as we know right so we should be
[1:18:51] so spiritually prepared there's no
[1:18:54] question there's no question we're going
[1:18:57] to make it because we brought plenty of
[1:18:59] extra oil right we've all seen people
[1:19:04] you don't try to run out run real quick
[1:19:06] oh I know the rapture is gonna come I'm
[1:19:07] not only gonna buy insurance because I
[1:19:09] know the rapture is gonna come I don't
[1:19:10] even have to go to school cuz I know the
[1:19:11] wraps are gonna come and we see after a
[1:19:13] few years that they don't run so hard
[1:19:15] and they lost their their zeal for the
[1:19:19] Lord right well I can I can run up my
[1:19:22] credit card like sister Karen brother
[1:19:24] Loris told us you know when they were
[1:19:25] serving God in the 70s they thought
[1:19:27] brother Branham said you know that
[1:19:28] Christ was going to come back in 77 so
[1:19:30] they ran up their credit cards and spent
[1:19:32] credit cars so they couldn't even
[1:19:33] overpay and they thought well I'm going
[1:19:35] the rapture anyway so might as well run
[1:19:37] up my credit card and their folly found
[1:19:40] them out see because God would never
[1:19:44] want a Christian do that in fact that'd
[1:19:46] be the last thing you want to do in fact
[1:19:48] brother said if you know the Rogers
[1:19:49] coming he said pay off all your debts
[1:19:51] don't run up your debts paid off be a
[1:19:54] real Christian you notice be sincere do
[1:19:57] a Christ we're doing
[1:20:00] amen yes there's a stop preparing but
[1:20:06] man said we got an unpack in order to go
[1:20:08] up he said people always packing up well
[1:20:11] I better get more I better get more but
[1:20:13] Barnes said if you in the Gulf you got
[1:20:14] to get lighter you got to get rid of all
[1:20:16] the cares of the world you got to get
[1:20:18] rid of that unpack unload unload all the
[1:20:21] burdens I'm not going to worry about
[1:20:23] this worldly thing I'm not going to
[1:20:24] worry about that I'm only going to be
[1:20:26] prepared to meet Christ but that's the
[1:20:32] part most people forget because look
[1:20:35] Church both fought Belt both fell asleep
[1:20:37] am i right the one who packed extra oil
[1:20:40] went to sleep as well see serving God
[1:20:44] you know it go after years everybody
[1:20:47] kind of gets a little tired even brother
[1:20:50] Jesse even you name your pastor your
[1:20:54] previous batch even then everybody gets
[1:20:56] a little tired
[1:20:58] everybody goes a little sleep sometimes
[1:21:00] we get a little tired on God but when
[1:21:02] the shout goes forth and it's time to
[1:21:06] wake up and it's time for the rapture
[1:21:08] then those who actually made the extra
[1:21:11] time to prepare and pack extra oil and
[1:21:14] really make sure they love God with all
[1:21:16] their heart soul mind and strength that
[1:21:18] really kept the first commandment that
[1:21:20] really laid there until something
[1:21:22] happened amen
[1:21:23] that really had a back shocker to
[1:21:25] experience those are the people that are
[1:21:27] gonna actually have the oil amen the
[1:21:31] ones that really made sure my life
[1:21:33] matches Acts chapter 2 I know what it's
[1:21:37] like in Acts chapter 2 because I've been
[1:21:40] in services where my testimony was
[1:21:43] noised abroad
[1:21:44] amen where I acted I I worshiped God I
[1:21:47] said how wonderful are the works of God
[1:21:50] and people saw me worship and I was so
[1:21:53] enjoying worshiping Jesus I didn't care
[1:21:55] who was looking at me because God was
[1:21:57] looking at me amen all I cared about was
[1:22:00] how much I loved God amen
[1:22:03] those are the kind of people that are
[1:22:05] going to be in the rapture they made
[1:22:07] sure they were born again they made sure
[1:22:11] before they went out
[1:22:12] started making making all these claims
[1:22:16] that they're gonna be in the rapture
[1:22:17] they took extra oil with them
[1:22:20] go to Ephesians 4 I'm going to close
[1:22:22] this season's for I've never really
[1:22:32] looked at this as a rapture Scripture
[1:22:34] until recently but it certainly is now
[1:22:40] I'm sorry it's Ephesians 5 farmy the
[1:22:42] asians 5 alright now this whole chapter
[1:22:55] would be good to read but just for times
[1:22:57] sake this chapter Scofield calls that
[1:22:59] the walk of the believer as God's dear
[1:23:01] child he talks about walking in love and
[1:23:03] not walking in sin now look at verse 7
[1:23:07] be not therefore partakers with them
[1:23:10] with sinners for you were sometimes
[1:23:13] darkness but now are ye light in the
[1:23:16] Lord so you're like the moon you're
[1:23:17] lighting up with God's light walk as
[1:23:20] children of light for the fruit of the
[1:23:22] Spirit and all goodness and
[1:23:23] righteousness and truth proving what is
[1:23:25] acceptable unto God so our church people
[1:23:29] in our church should think about is my
[1:23:33] or my actions good or wrong and then we
[1:23:36] should be able to prove that it's right
[1:23:37] for me to do this it's okay for me to do
[1:23:40] this or it's not okay for me do this
[1:23:42] because of the proof I found in God's
[1:23:44] Word
[1:23:44] praise God you should be able to prove
[1:23:48] that what you do is right in the sight
[1:23:50] of God Amen in verse 11 and have no
[1:23:54] fellowship with the unfruitful works of
[1:23:56] darkness but rather reprove them so
[1:23:59] we're supposed to separate from sinful
[1:24:01] people that do stand we're supposed to
[1:24:04] try to correct them as well
[1:24:07] look at verse 12
[1:24:09] it's a shame even to speak of those
[1:24:11] things which are done of them in secret
[1:24:13] so see there are certain sins that
[1:24:15] people do in secret we should even talk
[1:24:17] about let's not repeat certain things
[1:24:21] that are done in secret church and the
[1:24:22] church said we're not supposed to repeat
[1:24:24] them there's some secret sins people do
[1:24:27] don't even repeat them just say lord
[1:24:29] have mercy on them because it doesn't
[1:24:32] edify bursting at 13:00 but all things
[1:24:35] that are reproved are made manifest by
[1:24:38] the light for what silver doesn't make
[1:24:42] manifest is light wherefore he saith
[1:24:47] awake thou that sleepest and arise from
[1:24:49] the dead and Christ shall give thee
[1:24:51] light see then that you walk
[1:24:55] circumspectly not as fool's but as wise
[1:24:59] not alerting us that's verse 15 that's
[1:25:02] your wise and foolish virgin right there
[1:25:03] let me read again see that ye walk
[1:25:06] circumspectly which is specifically okay
[1:25:10] so you should walk specifically you
[1:25:12] should know as specifically what you're
[1:25:14] gonna do tomorrow and the church said
[1:25:17] you should specifically know I'm going
[1:25:20] to follow the leadership of the Holy
[1:25:21] Spirit tomorrow now you might not know
[1:25:23] all the details but you should
[1:25:24] specifically know I'm gonna walk in the
[1:25:27] ways of God tomorrow that's
[1:25:29] circumspectly I know already I'm gonna
[1:25:31] choose to follow God I'm gonna do
[1:25:33] something to get closer to God tomorrow
[1:25:36] I'm gonna walk circumspectly all right
[1:25:41] verse 15 not as fool's but as wise so
[1:25:45] fools and now we're talking about
[1:25:47] foolish Christians foolish virgins they
[1:25:50] will not really care or they will not
[1:25:52] take as much care to make sure they're
[1:25:54] doing exactly what God wants them to do
[1:25:56] every day they kind of flow from one day
[1:25:59] to the next
[1:25:59] they've really got no vision they really
[1:26:01] got no direction they just cutting a hem
[1:26:03] halt and flow and not really sure about
[1:26:05] it but a wise Christian kind of plans
[1:26:09] out their day how they're gonna serve
[1:26:11] God and to make sure that they're
[1:26:13] pleasing God every single day of their
[1:26:15] life praise God
[1:26:19] how many wanted
[1:26:21] why's a fool doesn't walk circumspectly
[1:26:25] a fool like well we'll see what happens
[1:26:27] tomorrow I already don't have any plans
[1:26:29] for the morning nor do I got plans for
[1:26:30] the evening I know I got to go to work I
[1:26:31] know I got to go to school but they
[1:26:33] don't really choose to really walk and
[1:26:36] do what Christ wants them to do look at
[1:26:41] verse 16 redeeming the time because the
[1:26:44] days are evil so Christians are gonna
[1:26:47] redeem the time they're gonna buy back
[1:26:49] the time that's what we deem means to
[1:26:51] buy back and make it your own so that
[1:26:53] means you as a son or daughter of God
[1:26:56] you know what God wants done with this
[1:26:58] word and so you do it ahead out of the
[1:27:02] area you don't waste time you redeem the
[1:27:06] time Christians are the ones who
[1:27:10] actually make the best use of their time
[1:27:14] fools don't fools just kind of well if
[1:27:17] it happens it happens and whatever
[1:27:18] whatever goes it's okay whatever comes
[1:27:20] it goes that's what fools do but
[1:27:23] Christians are wise and they know what
[1:27:25] God wants done with his word so they do
[1:27:27] it and they plan to do it
[1:27:31] look at verse 17 wherefore be not unwise
[1:27:35] but understanding what the will of the
[1:27:39] Lord is amen let's end our free right
[1:27:41] there we'll stop right there by the
[1:27:42] grace of God the wise Virginie what
[1:27:52] god's will was the wise version knew
[1:27:55] we're supposed to go out and we're
[1:27:56] supposed to wait until the bridegroom
[1:27:58] comes and so they they walked
[1:28:01] circumspectly they knew it might be a
[1:28:04] long wait so I better take extra oil
[1:28:07] they knew I might have to wait a long
[1:28:09] time I'm not going to rush into this I'm
[1:28:12] going to make sure everything's right if
[1:28:14] I'm going out there to wait I'm not
[1:28:15] going to just do it haphazardly I'm
[1:28:17] going to make sure I go out there and
[1:28:18] wait until I have to wait until I'm
[1:28:21] willing to stay there as long as they
[1:28:22] need to stay there in other words I'm
[1:28:29] not
[1:28:30] for this to be a short wait I'm in it
[1:28:32] for the long haul how do ya see some
[1:28:36] people get attracted the message oh oh
[1:28:37] just I just want to go home brother
[1:28:39] Jesse I've heard people say I just want
[1:28:40] to go home I just want to go in the
[1:28:42] rapture I just want to go home and
[1:28:43] pretty soon they find their home out in
[1:28:45] the world and it proved they really
[1:28:48] didn't want to go home yes they didn't
[1:28:50] like they didn't like the battles they
[1:28:51] didn't like balun saying but they really
[1:28:54] weren't invested into it
[1:28:55] to really do it for the long haul but
[1:28:58] Christians are in serving God for the
[1:29:01] long haul
[1:29:02] like we're singing I'll go the distance
[1:29:04] which I was a good song malachi to
[1:29:06] choose for the message i'll go the
[1:29:08] distance we didn't have that planned out
[1:29:10] but god had a planned out praise God
[1:29:12] now can you come here now can everybody
[1:29:17] see this we preach on the sixth seal has
[1:29:20] nothing to do with us in fact we're
[1:29:22] actually having a wedding feast with
[1:29:23] Christ at that time during the sixth
[1:29:25] seal but the light of it the tear of the
[1:29:30] Lord should make us persuade should
[1:29:32] impact our lives today and make us
[1:29:35] persuade people please serve God please
[1:29:38] love Jesus Christ please do anything you
[1:29:41] can do to get closer to Jesus Christ
[1:29:43] redeem the time you know eat how many
[1:29:47] times have you heard people say just in
[1:29:48] the last week minor children grow up
[1:29:50] fast I've had so many people tell me
[1:29:51] that
[1:29:52] wow you're shooting a girl fast my goes
[1:29:54] fast I almost every time to talk to you
[1:29:55] says that which is okay it's okay to say
[1:29:58] that but everybody knows how fast time
[1:30:01] goes so which people are making the most
[1:30:04] use of their time because the wise
[1:30:07] Christians will redeem it back they'll
[1:30:10] make it their own they're gonna stop
[1:30:13] saying all these days are slipping
[1:30:16] through my fingers instead they're gonna
[1:30:17] plan out their days and they're gonna
[1:30:19] make sure their body obeys the Word of
[1:30:21] God and bring their body into subjection
[1:30:24] to the Word of God well Graham said I
[1:30:29] like a man who's got goals praise the
[1:30:32] Lord I like a woman that knows what
[1:30:35] she's called to do
[1:30:37] we've got to know what we're up to do
[1:30:47] see then that you walk circumspectly not
[1:30:49] as fool's but as wise i want to how many
[1:30:53] want to walk a wise walk on this earth
[1:30:55] then let me pray for you that God will
[1:30:57] help you redeem the time it's all about
[1:30:59] what you choose to do with your time as
[1:31:03] we pray think about what you need to
[1:31:05] give up what's what's consuming even if
[1:31:07] it's just five minutes that's five
[1:31:09] minutes you could be here in the Word of
[1:31:10] God this is only a ten minute video this
[1:31:18] is only a little webpage you know this
[1:31:23] is only a half an hour I got a there's
[1:31:25] only an hour when it would be invested
[1:31:26] but think about is it the best use of my
[1:31:29] time is it redeeming it back is it
[1:31:33] walking circumspectly or on purpose
