[22:05] maybe senior let's take a few very
[22:07] question by the grace of the Lord
[22:09] trying to keep song service will be
[22:11] shorter here to get full amount of time
[22:12] for the word and if you come praying up
[22:17] then don't take don't take too many
[22:18] songs to get you ready for the word but
[22:21] of course we appreciate all the songs
[22:22] you understand so let's take a few
[22:24] prayer requests brother Jose having
[22:27] trouble with his teeth that's why I
[22:28] hasn't been coming to service so we will
[22:30] need to pray for him at the end of the
[22:31] service if I remember I'll try to come
[22:33] up and stand in prayer for him so that
[22:36] his teeth can be made well and he can
[22:38] come back to church by God's grace
[22:40] Brotherhood he's been a real faithful
[22:41] brother and has a tremendous testimony
[22:43] about the Lord just doing great things
[22:45] for him so we're thankful by God's grace
[22:48] for him let's pray for healing also
[22:51] brother Chandler from North Carolina he
[22:52] sent me a text and said what a great
[22:54] service it was last night he think
[22:56] brother cam and brother Brooks were
[22:57] there and all the Saints for their labor
[22:59] of love and he just said kind of like an
[23:01] unspoken request for his sister-in-law
[23:03] he said could you please pray for that I
[23:05] said yes we'll be happy to pray for that
[23:07] this morning that's all I have I just
[23:11] also I do want to thank all the Saints
[23:14] last night especially the sisters and
[23:16] the brothers for everybody getting in
[23:18] the spirit there was a you know multiple
[23:21] people crying you know that was probably
[23:24] the best atmosphere we've had in our
[23:25] church probably in five years as far as
[23:28] keeping that atmosphere going for I was
[23:30] almost a four-hour service so I want to
[23:32] thank all the sisters I mean I saw
[23:33] sisters praying I saw brothers crying
[23:36] tears streaming down their face raising
[23:38] their hands people were screaming at the
[23:40] Friends of the Lord
[23:40] people praying on their knees it was
[23:42] just a wonderful atmosphere so I want to
[23:44] thank everybody for creating that
[23:46] atmosphere you've got to yield to the
[23:48] Holy Spirit and last night was a
[23:50] wonderful time of yielding to the Holy
[23:52] Spirit so I want to thank everybody for
[23:55] yielding to the Holy Spirit praise God
[23:58] and it was hot in here and everything
[23:59] like that but nothing like the old
[24:00] meetings right the old meetings used to
[24:02] be real hot I was never in those old
[24:04] meetings I don't know we know before
[24:07] air-conditioning
[24:09] but here's a little testimony for my
[24:11] daughter havens if you want to say this
[24:13] about last night she said last night
[24:15] while I was praying I felt three winds
[24:17] hit me two of them are very strong the
[24:21] last one was more gentle than I got the
[24:23] Holy Ghost God was there as soon as I
[24:38] got in the van I said how was the
[24:39] service Haven she said daddy I got the
[24:41] Holy Ghost she said I don't have to pray
[24:44] for it anymore God gave it to me just so
[24:47] bold and excited and when we pray last
[24:50] night something eternal happened last
[24:53] night and if they if they received
[24:56] eternal life they'll have that forever
[24:58] eternally so thank the Lord for all your
[25:02] prayers all the polling all the
[25:04] everybody getting the spirit to let the
[25:06] Holy Spirit remember you notice it was
[25:07] like up and down in waves right brother

[25:10] said get the sing him back up again you
[25:11] see that just you know cuz we get tired
[25:13] but then we need a fresh inspiration and
[25:16] then people would be praying and

[25:20] Holy Spirit comes in waves by God's
[25:22] grace he's he just comes in like a flood
