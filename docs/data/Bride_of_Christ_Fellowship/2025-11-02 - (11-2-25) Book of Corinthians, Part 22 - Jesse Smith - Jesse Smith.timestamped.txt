[0:01] 12, 13, and 14. By God's grace, I took
[0:03] about a fivemon break from this series.
[0:06] So, I studied yesterday and I
[0:10] just felt some good uncction from the
[0:12] Holy Spirit, some good thoughts, and so
[0:13] I trust it'll be a blessing to you
[0:15] today. As we read that quote on
[0:17] Wednesday, Brother Brandham said, "The
[0:19] Holy Ghost can only feed on the word of
[0:21] God." This is the time to feed your soul
[0:23] on the word of God. You've got to say,
[0:25] "Amen." You've got to say, "Thank you,
[0:27] Lord." You got to say, "I receive it."
[0:29] You've got to receive the word of God
[0:30] today. So, let's let's ask God to do
[0:33] that here as we uh read our text by
[0:35] God's grace. This is the scripture I
[0:38] like to read. Now, I'll read uh 12 and
[0:39] 13. Then we can all read uh 14 by God's
[0:42] grace. For as the body is one and hath
[0:44] many members, and all the members of
[0:46] that one body, being many are one body,
[0:48] so also is Christ. For by one spirit are
[0:52] we all baptized into one body, whether
[0:54] we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be
[0:56] bond or free, and have all been made to
[0:59] drink into one spirit. Let's read verse
[1:01] 14. Ready? One, two, three. For the body
[1:04] is not one member, but many. May God add
[1:07] his blessing to the ring of his word.
[1:08] You can be seated.
[1:10] I have some quotes to show, Caseia, so
[1:12] you can switch over there. uh by God's
[1:14] grace.
[1:21] Hallelujah. So, we'll get back to this
[1:22] series. I took about, like I said, five
[1:24] months off. I want to get back to this
[1:25] here and try to finish this up. I
[1:27] listened to u brother Brandon preaching
[1:30] 57 yesterday. The uh uh the book of
[1:32] Corinthians. What a beautiful That was a
[1:34] little Sunday school Bible study there.
[1:36] So, if you got an extra hour and a half,
[1:37] you need to listen to that one. It's a
[1:38] beautiful uh text there. He kept he kept
[1:41] saying the word deep. This is so deep.
[1:42] This is so deep. So, uh maybe next time
[1:45] we'll preach on that. But this is a deep
[1:46] message uh deep in the scripture by
[1:49] God's grace.
[1:51] So, we read our text and I'll just
[1:53] quickly review, you know, working our
[1:54] way through the book. We've uh made it
[1:56] up to chapter 12. So, we're on the
[1:57] seventh section here, spiritual gifts
[1:59] and charity, how they all work together.
[2:02] We've looked at how believers stand in
[2:04] grace. And la last Sunday, we saw how
[2:06] the woman caught in adultery. Where did
[2:07] she stand, church? She stood in grace.
[2:10] Right? And Jesus said, "Neither do I
[2:11] condemn you. Go and sin no more." Yet
[2:14] she was just fresh in the act of it. But
[2:16] yet a repentant heart, God will always
[2:18] receive that. And then God kept that
[2:20] woman there. Even though she was uh just
[2:22] caught in the very act, God let her get
[2:25] into the grace of God. That's where she
[2:26] stood upon the grace of God. And then
[2:28] it's our responsibility to go and sin no
[2:31] more. Hallelujah. So you're fighting the
[2:32] good fight of faith. You're on the
[2:34] battlefield for the Lord. How many
[2:35] fighting sin this week by God's grace?
[2:37] Hallelujah. And you got to fight it
[2:38] today. You have to fight it tomorrow.
[2:40] Amen. Uh but that's what we are. We're
[2:42] soldiers in the army of the Lord.
[2:43] Hallelujah. That's what we're called to
[2:45] do. Then we looked at chapter 1 and
[2:47] through four about the carnal divided
[2:49] condition in the Corinthian church.
[2:51] Brother Ram uses these words. He said,
[2:52] "Brother Jose, they're always in
[2:54] trouble." He said, "This church was
[2:56] always in trouble. I don't want to be
[2:58] that kind of a church that always has
[2:59] trouble. I want to have peace. I want to
[3:01] have supernatural. I want to have
[3:02] testimonies. I want to have love. That's
[3:05] the kind of church I want to have."
[3:06] Hallelujah.
[3:07] &gt;&gt; I don't want constant trouble fussing
[3:08] with that one. and arguing with that
[3:10] one, debating with that one, and
[3:12] struggling with that one, and someone
[3:14] deep in sin there. Let's have a church
[3:15] where the Holy Ghost can keep us all in
[3:17] one accord. Hallelujah. Now, we know
[3:19] every church must go through divisions
[3:21] and go through trials. And we go through
[3:23] those the best we can by the grace of
[3:25] God. Hallelujah. And we ask God for a
[3:27] new season. We ask God for new grace.
[3:30] Hallelujah. To keep going, to press,
[3:32] keep pressing on by the grace of God.
[3:34] And then Paul dealt with their sexual
[3:35] immorality. It was so wicked even
[3:37] heathens didn't do type of these type of
[3:39] things where a man would sleep with his
[3:42] stepmother. Paul said it was so wicked
[3:44] and he said the only way to get the
[3:45] church clean is to get that person out
[3:47] of the church. If they won't repent, get
[3:48] them out of the church so you can have a
[3:50] a new lump. The Bible says an unleavened
[3:53] church. Hallelujah. So sexual sin is of
[3:55] the utmost importance to get out of the
[3:57] church. Hallelujah.
[4:00] And then Paul, you know, dealt with
[4:01] that. If there's sexual sin, he said,
[4:02] "Let's let's let me explain this is how
[4:04] we do it the right way." So he dealt
[4:06] with the sanctity of the body and
[4:08] marriage. And then he dealt with
[4:10] Christian liberties and their warning
[4:11] especially about how much you interact
[4:13] with other people, you know, as you
[4:15] interact out in the world. And in their
[4:17] day, you know, they would have heathens.
[4:18] These heathens would make animal
[4:20] sacrifices in the temples of their gods.
[4:21] And then they would just have a feast
[4:23] like a party. And so the Christians
[4:25] would be in just invited to the party,
[4:26] but the food was at this pagan temple
[4:29] where they had sexual acts before and
[4:31] they had all this wickedness. And it'd
[4:33] be like somebody inviting you, let's go
[4:34] out to the bar, you know, let's go have
[4:36] a meal or let's go out to a sports bar
[4:38] or something like that. And in most
[4:39] cases, it's wise not to go, right? It's
[4:42] mo wise in most cases not to go. I'm not
[4:45] I'm saying not all because if Jesus went
[4:47] into some of those gatherings and Jesus
[4:48] changed hearts and lives.
[4:50] &gt;&gt; But if you don't have that anointing, if
[4:52] you don't have that, for sure it's best
[4:54] to stay away.
[4:55] &gt;&gt; And that's what Paul tells us. Paul
[4:57] said, "I would rather I'd rather not eat
[4:59] meat or drink wine or do anything as
[5:02] long as the world stands that I don't
[5:03] cause one Christian to stumble."
[5:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's how much we should
[5:07] care about one another, what they think
[5:09] about the word and what they think about
[5:10] a real Christian is. And if someone lets
[5:13] us know that we're causing them to
[5:14] struggle, you know, let let's do our
[5:16] best to to avoid those things,
[5:18] especially related to eating and alcohol
[5:21] because that's what the Bible tells us.
[5:22] Hallelujah. And then we looked at the
[5:25] headship of the church, you know, uh,
[5:27] how it relates with hair and so forth.
[5:29] And the hair is a sign. A woman's long
[5:31] uncut hair is a symbol. She's under the
[5:34] full obedience and authority to her
[5:35] husband. That's what the long hair
[5:37] represents. It's not just, it just
[5:39] wasn't for the Corinthian church. It was
[5:41] for the entire body of Christ. Like I
[5:43] challenged a young brother this week. I
[5:44] said, "Show me where any godly woman
[5:46] ever cut her hair in the Bible." You
[5:48] won't find it. Hallelujah. She never did
[5:50] because she was under the full obedience
[5:52] to her husband, which is he's under full
[5:54] obedience to Christ. Hallelujah. That's
[5:57] a beautiful type of Christ in the
[5:59] church. And the the hair is a symbol of
[6:01] the word. So if a woman cuts her hair,
[6:02] she's like, "Well, I don't need
[6:03] Revelation or I don't need Genesis or I
[6:06] don't need uh the Gospels." That's what
[6:07] it represents when a woman cuts her hair
[6:09] because we're all we're all the bride of
[6:11] Christ and we're under all the authority
[6:13] and headship of God's word.
[6:15] &gt;&gt; [snorts]
[6:16] &gt;&gt; We looked at the Lord's supper, how
[6:18] there's a temporary curse if people
[6:20] don't discern each other, right? Even
[6:22] good, good, godly Christians can come
[6:23] under a temporary curse. The Bible said
[6:25] they get weak, sickly, and die among us
[6:28] if people don't rightly discern the body
[6:30] of Christ. And then we last, we looked
[6:32] at the spiritual gifts. We went through
[6:34] the last uh nine gifts of or the the
[6:36] nine gifts of the Holy Spirit by God's
[6:38] grace. And that's where we'll pick up
[6:39] today. Now remember, this church was
[6:41] always in trouble. They always had
[6:42] somebody divided against each other.
[6:43] They had sexual immorality. They were
[6:46] suing each other. They were getting
[6:48] drunk uh at the Lord's supper and they
[6:51] wouldn't let the poor people eat their
[6:53] food while they were waiting for uh
[6:55] communion to partake of the Lord's
[6:56] supper. Sorry, I got a little thing on
[6:58] my glasses. Uh and then they were out of
[7:02] order with spiritual gifts. They might
[7:03] have eight or nine tongues and
[7:04] interpretation. We'd say Paul says,
[7:06] "Bring it down to three." He said,
[7:08] "Let's just focus on three." Three is a
[7:10] lot for three is a lot. Three. Three
[7:12] things is a lot of things to remember
[7:13] for any person, right? Three things. So
[7:16] Paul says, "Let's let it be three
[7:17] interpretations at the most in a church
[7:19] service." And if you don't have
[7:20] interpretation, just uh speak in tongues
[7:22] at home, Paul says. Okay. Now, we'll get
[7:25] to later. They lack generosity. You
[7:27] know, as much, think about this. As much
[7:29] money as they had and uh you know,
[7:30] Corinth was a great port city where they
[7:32] had a lot of trade and it was a wealthy
[7:34] place, huge church. Uh the second book
[7:37] tells us they had lots of guest
[7:38] preachers in a lot of Paul calls them
[7:40] false apostles. They had a lot of guest
[7:42] preachers in. Yet with all that they
[7:44] were the richest but they were the
[7:46] stingiest as well.
[7:48] &gt;&gt; That's a lesson for us not to be stingy,
[7:50] &gt;&gt; right? Because we live in the most
[7:51] prosperous nation there ever was.
[7:54] &gt;&gt; United States of America of course
[7:56] because of Christian principles uh in
[7:58] our constitution and everything.
[8:01] But they we'll see that they were not
[8:03] very generous people. So among us, if
[8:05] you see somebody who doesn't have food
[8:07] or see somebody who needs a new code or
[8:09] see somebody who doesn't have gas money,
[8:10] you should try to reach out and help
[8:11] them out by the grace of God.
[8:13] &gt;&gt; Remember when I first come in the
[8:14] message, I was a college student and I
[8:15] had plenty of money. But these brothers
[8:17] from Sheffield, they would do the $20
[8:19] handshakes to me, okay? You know, I I
[8:22] drove an hour and a half up there and
[8:23] I'd be like, "Hey, brother Bill, Brother
[8:25] Richard, God bless you." I shake them. I
[8:27] shake their hands. Soon as I pull away
[8:29] my hand, I felt something paper in my
[8:30] hand. I'm like, "What is that?" There's
[8:32] a $20 bill. I'm like, "Brother?" He's
[8:34] like, "No, they push me back." So that's
[8:36] one time you can use physical force with
[8:38] somebody. [laughter]
[8:39] I'm just joking. Push him away. No,
[8:41] brother Jesse, you know, you're giving
[8:42] up your time. You're driving an hour and
[8:43] a half. We want to support your gas
[8:45] money. I said, "Well, thank you, sir."
[8:47] And look how God's blessed them. Their
[8:48] church is growing and beautiful church.
[8:50] And uh most importantly, the main
[8:52] spiritual or the main growth we want is
[8:54] spiritual growth.
[8:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But they've been so faithful
[8:56] to the Lord all these years. Some of the
[8:58] finest Christians, Brother Vang, we've
[8:59] ever met, right? Is the Saints in
[9:01] Sheffield, Ohio. such wonderful
[9:03] Christians. My you hardly could be
[9:05] around sweeter Christians. But they were
[9:07] always so generous like that as well.
[9:09] You know, they threw a party for my wife
[9:10] uh when she when we got married. What do
[9:12] they call it? A what do you call it?
[9:14] Kind of a party for a bridal shower.
[9:16] There it is. I knew a bachelor party.
[9:18] That's for the bachelor. Tool party is
[9:20] what the what we should call it, right?
[9:22] For the Holy Spirit. Now, the last time
[9:23] we preached part 21, we looked at the
[9:25] nine gifts of the Holy Spirit. Now,
[9:27] today we're going to look at this
[9:28] thought because that's how this is
[9:29] Paul's thought when he finishes chapter
[9:31] 12. I want to try to finish chapter 12
[9:33] if I can today. [snorts]
[9:35] Which gifts seem to get the most honor
[9:37] among us and other message believers?
[9:40] Well, probably prophecy, tongues, and
[9:41] interpretation because they're just out
[9:43] in front of everybody. And it's so
[9:45] supernatural, right? Which it ought to
[9:47] be. That's the way God ordained it. But
[9:49] Paul gives us a good lesson. Just
[9:51] because we honor those uh doesn't mean
[9:53] they should get the most honor. And Paul
[9:55] says God is going to honor the other
[9:57] ones. Hallelujah.
[10:01] So, we need all the gifts. We appreciate
[10:03] all the gifts. Um, and like I was
[10:05] telling a brother, you know, it's been
[10:07] years since we had tongues
[10:08] interpretation, but uh that's all up to
[10:09] God because I can't you and I can't add
[10:11] one cubit to our stature. We're trying
[10:14] to pray more before service. That should
[10:15] help. In fact, that that was the advice
[10:17] brother gave to people who spoke in
[10:19] tongues. Come an hour, he said, or 45
[10:21] minutes before church and pray. Try to
[10:24] get in the spirit. And then he said, get
[10:26] a message, right? And then hand it to
[10:27] the pastor. If it's a thus sayith the
[10:28] Lord, hand it to the pastor. Now, we've
[10:30] never had that here where it came before
[10:32] the sermon. Right. The one time we did
[10:34] have interpretation was back in 2010
[10:36] over at the Waterlue and that came at
[10:38] the end of the service and I think Vang
[10:40] was there if I'm not mistaken. I wasn't.
[10:42] I was preaching in Columbus, Ohio. But
[10:44] after that went forth, I heard the
[10:45] recording and I went asked and three
[10:46] people said that applied to them. So
[10:48] that seemed to be from the Lord.
[10:51] So we just take what God gives us. But
[10:53] we we ourselves we can do a better job
[10:55] of course and I mean this all of us we
[10:57] can all do a better job of praying for
[10:58] more of the gifts to operate
[11:00] &gt;&gt; because we need constant reminders. The
[11:02] Bible we're going to see it. The Bible
[11:03] says covet them. Covet means to desire
[11:06] to want something of that somebody else
[11:07] has. So we're supposed to covet
[11:09] spiritual things.
[11:10] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So we can pray for that at
[11:12] the end of service as well. And it
[11:14] wasn't just what a year ago. Remember I
[11:15] had all of you come up here on a
[11:16] Wednesday night and this I says does
[11:18] anybody have a word from anybody have a
[11:20] gift operating? remember that? You know,
[11:21] we did that a couple times on a
[11:22] Wednesday night. Does anybody have
[11:23] anything? And one time Beatatric said I
[11:25] had a word or she had a song on her
[11:27] heart and she shared to us and I enjoyed
[11:29] that. So, you know, you just try to u
[11:32] create an atmosphere where God's spirit
[11:34] can move and God's people can be led of
[11:37] the Holy Spirit.
[11:38] &gt;&gt; Now, notice here's where it strikes, you
[11:40] know, for us brothers. We got to
[11:41] recognize sometimes a woman can add a
[11:43] word of wisdom for us and that doesn't
[11:45] mean she's got a Jezebel spirit,
[11:48] &gt;&gt; right?
[11:50] Or a woman could have a word of
[11:51] knowledge. That doesn't mean she's
[11:52] trying to preach at us.
[11:54] Right, brothers?
[11:56] &gt;&gt; If you're married, you understand that.
[11:57] And you say, "Thank God I have a thank
[11:59] God for my correction." Like brother
[12:00] Brandham said, "My wife is my
[12:02] correction." Brother Brandham said, "So
[12:03] is my wife my correction." Right? So my
[12:06] wife often gives these to me. Uh now
[12:09] faith is the assurance. A sister can
[12:11] have that a word of faith. I believe
[12:12] this is going to happen. Healing,
[12:14] healing can come in many different
[12:15] forms. Miracles can come in different
[12:18] forms. Uh then prophecy for us is
[12:20] normally going to come through a dream
[12:22] for us, but it could be something where
[12:23] you you tell me, "Brother Jesse, I know
[12:25] this is going to happen in the future."
[12:27] Well, that could either be faith or
[12:28] prophecy depending on how it's worded
[12:31] and how it comes across.
[12:33] And then discerning of spirits, that's
[12:35] judging. Is this spirit of God or is
[12:37] this spirit of Satan? That's the
[12:38] discernment for that. That's so
[12:40] important. Hallelujah. Especially in
[12:41] this day when deception is the worst
[12:43] it's ever been. This is the most
[12:45] deceptive time it's ever been. But thank
[12:47] God we have the most revelation we've
[12:49] ever had.
[12:49] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's by the Bible. The
[12:51] seals are open. Praise God. So we have
[12:53] the greatest revelation that the church
[12:55] has ever had. That doesn't make us
[12:56] greater. We're not greater. It just
[12:58] makes us more responsible
[13:00] &gt;&gt; and more able to fight the battles that
[13:02] God has allowed today. And then of
[13:05] course, tongues interpretation. So uh so
[13:07] let's hear now. I'm going to try to
[13:08] finish chapter 12. By God's grace, may
[13:10] God help us. Hallelujah. For as the body
[13:13] is one and hath many members, and all
[13:16] the members of that one body being many
[13:18] are one body, so also is Christ. So
[13:21] Christ is one body with many members.
[13:25] And remember, Brother Ram has that that
[13:26] famous quote. Brother Ram said, I don't
[13:28] care if I'm just the skin on the feet of
[13:30] the body of Christ as long as I'm in the
[13:32] body of Christ. And if I'm the skin on
[13:34] the feet, I'm still I still have every
[13:36] demon under my feet. Amen. I like that.
[13:40] Hallelujah. What wisdom? Amen.
[13:42] &gt;&gt; But you know, we all want to be the
[13:43] tongue or the vocal cords, right? We all
[13:46] want to speak for God
[13:48] with thus sayith the Lord and I've GOT
[13:50] THE WORD OF GOD. We all want to do that,
[13:52] but we're not all that.
[13:55] &gt;&gt; God has that. Thank God for that. But
[13:57] God also has the rest of your body. And
[13:59] church, what would you be if you were
[14:00] just a head with no tongue? You'd be
[14:02] dead, right? I'm sorry, just a t just
[14:04] ahead with a tongue, right? If you were
[14:06] just a tongue, if you just spoke for God
[14:07] all the time, whether it was uh prophecy
[14:10] or preaching or whatever it may be, or
[14:11] whatever, uh word of wisdom, word of
[14:13] knowledge, uh tongue interpretation,
[14:15] whatever it be, without the rest of the
[14:16] body, there's no one to receive it.
[14:19] Right? So, we want to remember Christ is
[14:21] a body with many members. And I believe
[14:24] his his body has seven parts to it.
[14:26] Amen. With Ephesus, Samrna, Pergamos,
[14:28] Thyira, hallelujah, Philadelphia,
[14:30] Sardis, and Leodysia. Amen. He He's
[14:33] built up of a of a bride from seven
[14:35] church ages. Hallelujah.
[14:38] Verse 13, for by one spirit we're all
[14:40] baptized into one body. It's hard to
[14:42] overemphasize how important this verse
[14:43] is right here. Verse 13. Brother Ram
[14:46] uses it over and over again,
[14:49] as we'll see, whether we be Jews or
[14:51] Gentiles, whether we be bond or free,
[14:53] and have been all made to drink into one
[14:55] spirit. So, when you're born again, you
[14:57] are baptized or you are immersed into
[15:00] the body of Christ.
[15:02] So think about you know consuming
[15:04] something that's like you when you're
[15:05] when you're baptized in a body you you
[15:07] now become a part of Christ's body right
[15:10] you are part of him and glory he's a
[15:13] part of you hallelujah so in in your
[15:15] body he's a part of you but in the
[15:16] spiritual realm you are a part of him
[15:19] and it's as if you uh you know he he
[15:21] drank you in down into his life
[15:23] hallelujah and you're a part of the body
[15:26] of Christ you're one with Christ in the
[15:28] soul hallelujah for the body is Not one
[15:32] member but many. So as we would tell our
[15:33] tape worshiping friends, brother Ram's
[15:35] not the full body of Christ. There's
[15:37] many members,
[15:38] &gt;&gt; right? To the people who worship the
[15:40] tapes, which we don't. We thank God for
[15:42] the tapes. I listened to the tapes
[15:43] yesterday. Beautiful, wonderful,
[15:45] inspiring. Hallelujah. But the tape is
[15:48] not Jesus. Hallelujah. Jesus is the Holy
[15:50] Ghost. Hallelujah.
[15:52] &gt;&gt; Amen. By one spirit, we're all baptized
[15:55] not to the tape. We're baptized into the
[15:57] Holy Ghost. Hallelujah.
[15:58] &gt;&gt; Amen. great distinction that has to be
[16:00] made.
[16:02] And so this is you know verse 13 is one
[16:04] of the major uh quotes in the token
[16:07] message which brother Ram said outside
[16:09] of my commission the seven seals in the
[16:10] church ages outside of that this is one
[16:13] of the highlight sermons of my entire
[16:15] ministry.
[16:16] See so his commission was the highlight
[16:18] but then outside of that he said the
[16:21] token message which is the baptism of
[16:23] the Holy Ghost. Not just justified, not
[16:26] just sanctified, but baptized with the
[16:28] Holy Ghost.
[16:31] &gt;&gt; He says, "Be sure the token is showing."
[16:33] And the token is the Holy Spirit. So
[16:34] this is his last verse before the
[16:36] prayer. Now I'm sure he used Bible
[16:38] verses in the prayer, but his last verse
[16:40] before he finished and said, "Let's
[16:41] close in prayer." He says, "And the
[16:44] token is the Holy Spirit. For by one
[16:46] spirit we're all baptized into one body,
[16:48] made partakers of his glory on our land,
[16:50] our home. March now to the promised
[16:52] land." So the Holy Ghost is the promised
[16:55] land, right? We leave Egypt, we go
[16:57] through the wilderness, we reach the
[16:58] promised land. The promised land is the
[17:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost. The promised
[17:02] land is the token.
[17:05] Do you love him? Do you believe the
[17:06] token? How many would like to say, "Oh,
[17:08] brother Brand, pray for me that I will
[17:10] come under this token." I'd like to say
[17:11] that. Amen. Oh Jesus, let me come under
[17:14] this token. I believe I am, but if I'm
[17:16] not, let me get there by God's grace.
[17:17] Hallelujah. He says, "My friends, now
[17:20] getting back, this is a beautiful
[17:21] message as well. One of just a
[17:22] phenomenal some phenomenal thought God's
[17:25] chosen place of worship. In the Old
[17:27] Testament, God told Solomon, I'm going
[17:28] to put my name in that house. And so,
[17:31] Brother Ram uses that type. Where is
[17:33] God's house today? And where is the name
[17:35] of God today?
[17:37] Brother Ram said, I don't, he said, I
[17:39] don't want to hurt feelings, but I'm
[17:40] responsible for the message. The message
[17:42] is come out of this mess. And if I ask
[17:44] you to come out, where am I going to
[17:45] take you? Would I take you to Bram
[17:46] Tabernacle? No, is the answer. It's as
[17:49] much fault as any of the rest of them.
[17:52] But there's one place I can take you to
[17:54] where you're safe and protected from
[17:55] death. That's in Jesus Christ. God's
[17:58] place of worship.
[18:00] &gt;&gt; So the Holy Ghost today is God's place
[18:03] of worship. Now look at that church. He
[18:05] promised he'll meet every person that
[18:07] comes in there. Oh my, what a promise.
[18:10] Let's get the Holy Ghost so then Christ
[18:12] can meet with us.
[18:15] &gt;&gt; It's not in the church. It's not
[18:16] physically in this church. It's not in
[18:18] any tabernacle. It's in the Holy Ghost.
[18:21] It's in Jesus Christ.
[18:24] But God in Christ, he is God's
[18:26] tabernacle. He's the place that God came
[18:28] into himself and dwelt in him. This is
[18:30] my beloved son in whom I am well pleased
[18:32] to dwell in. There is where God's
[18:34] tabernacled brought his name and placed
[18:36] it upon Jesus Christ. Therefore, his
[18:38] name was put in a man, his son Jesus
[18:40] Christ, in which he tabernacled himself
[18:43] in that tabernacle. So God came in the
[18:46] body of Jesus Christ. So that's where we
[18:48] all GOT TO COME. WE'VE ALL got to come
[18:50] into Jesus Christ.
[18:53] &gt;&gt; Now we want to find how we get into him.
[18:57] Boy, I'd really like to be in him,
[18:58] brother Jesse. I'd really like to be in
[19:00] God's provided place of worship. How do
[19:02] we get in this place of worship? 1
[19:04] Corinthians 12 settles it. Aren't you
[19:06] glad, church? This chapter settles it.
[19:08] Hallelujah. This verse 12:13 settles how
[19:12] we get into him. How do we get into
[19:14] Christ? Is it through that church or is
[19:16] it through the tapes? Or where is it
[19:17] through? Is it through fasting and
[19:19] praying? What is it through? It's
[19:21] through being born again, baptized with
[19:24] the Holy Ghost
[19:26] &gt;&gt; by one spirit, not by one church, not by
[19:28] one creed, not by one pastor, not by one
[19:30] bishop, not by one priest. See, some
[19:32] people say, "Well, you got to have you
[19:34] got to come to my church to be born
[19:35] again." Nonsense. You got to have this
[19:38] pastor pray for you, that evangelist or
[19:40] that apostle. You got to have them pray
[19:41] for you. Nonsense. It's by one spirit
[19:44] we're all baptized into one body.
[19:47] &gt;&gt; And I'm thank God over the years people
[19:49] have come back and said, "Brother Jesse,
[19:50] thank you for praying for me. I got the
[19:51] Holy Ghost when you prayed for me and
[19:53] I'm still serving God and I'm on fire."
[19:55] That's that brother from Iowa always
[19:56] tells me that God bless that brother.
[19:58] Amen. And I'm thankful for those things.
[20:00] But it wasn't because of me. It was
[20:02] because the Holy Ghost. EVERYBODY GOT
[20:03] ONE ACCORD. And then the Holy Ghost can
[20:05] flow right through the church.
[20:06] Hallelujah.
[20:08] &gt;&gt; If we can just get out of the
[20:09] wilderness. Amen. If we can just get out
[20:11] of the wilderness and get to the Jordan,
[20:13] then we can get the Holy Ghost.
[20:14] Hallelujah. Amen. If people can get out
[20:16] of the wandering in the wilderness and
[20:19] get someplace with God. Amen. I'll say
[20:20] like this. And get to the place where
[20:22] God wants their life to go so they can
[20:24] serve God and they can have a territory
[20:27] and they can have a position and they
[20:28] can have a calling and they can DO
[20:30] SOMETHING FOR GOD. HALLELUJAH.
[20:34] By one Holy Spirit, we're all baptized
[20:36] into one body, which is the body of
[20:38] Jesus Christ and subject to every gift
[20:40] that lays in the body. So that's why I'm
[20:42] thankful, you know, with that list of
[20:43] nine, I can see numerous where people
[20:45] have told me, God's used me in those
[20:48] gifts. But those gifts don't save me.
[20:50] Love saves me.
[20:52] &gt;&gt; The love of God saves us. HALLELUJAH.
[20:54] THE BLOOD OF JESUS CHRIST SAVED US. I'M
[20:56] NOT SAVED by the gifts, but when I get
[20:58] saved, then God uses me with his gifts.
[21:02] No joining, no reciting of creeds, no
[21:04] pumping up. Oh, brother, just let me
[21:06] pump you up so you can get born again.
[21:08] No letting down. Oh, brother, just calm
[21:10] down. You get born again. No
[21:11] handshaking, nothing else. By birth,
[21:14] we're baptized into the body of Christ.
[21:15] Amen. By one spirit, we're all baptized
[21:17] into one body. Is this Is this verse
[21:19] important or not, church?
[21:21] &gt;&gt; It's the token. It's God's provided
[21:23] place of worship. It's how you get into
[21:25] Christ. It's how you get into the
[21:26] rapture. Praise God.
[21:29] I'm going to share this because Simon
[21:30] shared this with me. Uh Simon was
[21:32] witnessing to a guy this week about
[21:33] baptism. He shared my video with him.
[21:35] And this is kind of not related, but
[21:37] it's just fresh to me. And at the
[21:39] beginning of my baptism video, I put
[21:41] there's 10 baptisms recorded in the
[21:43] Bible in the book of Acts. Five of them
[21:45] have the name used of God. And Simon
[21:47] said, "Did you catch that revelation,
[21:49] Brother Jesse?" I'm like, "Yeah, I just
[21:50] did."
[21:51] There's 10 virgins. Amen. Five of THEM
[21:54] HAVE THE OIL. FIVE OF THEM ARE BAPTIZED
[21:57] IN THE LITERAL NAME OF JESUS CHRIST.
[21:59] HALLELUJAH. NOT TITLES. I said, "Thank
[22:01] you, Lord." Amen. I got another video to
[22:03] make now by God's grace. Do you
[22:06] appreciate that revelation?
[22:07] &gt;&gt; It ties in with the revelation God gave
[22:09] to Simon where when Saul turned against
[22:12] David, he's no longer used the name
[22:14] David. Now he calls him son of Jesse. He
[22:15] used titles.
[22:17] &gt;&gt; It tied perfectly with that. Well, see,
[22:20] God's in numbers, too. Amen. And what is
[22:22] that body? In the beginning was the
[22:24] word. The word was with God. The word
[22:25] was God. The word was made flesh and
[22:26] dwelt among us. How can we be in that
[22:28] body and deny one word of it or place it
[22:31] off somewhere else that it's not even in
[22:33] the body like the the the tape worship.
[22:35] They do away with Hebrew Hebrews 10.
[22:37] They don't they haven't gathered in
[22:39] church for five years because they said
[22:40] they're getting training for the
[22:42] rapture. I'm sorry. You'll never find
[22:44] that in the Bible. So, they disagree
[22:47] with Hebrews 10. I don't know why I'm
[22:48] preaching on that so hard today, but
[22:49] maybe it's just freshly on my mind. But
[22:51] they they they take that out. They
[22:53] disagree with Hebrews 10 for this day.
[22:56] God put it in there. God never put it
[22:58] out.
[22:59] &gt;&gt; So, how can you be born again and take
[23:02] out what God has placed in there? You
[23:04] can't be. Hallelujah. [clears throat]
[23:06] That's right.
[23:08] &gt;&gt; How can you place off somewhere it's not
[23:10] even in the body? How can we ever do it?
[23:12] God's got a chosen place.
[23:15] &gt;&gt; Notice when you're truly baptized in
[23:16] him, the true evidence is that you
[23:19] believe him, the word.
[23:22] you believe the word. How can you be a
[23:24] part of him and then deny him? Oh, I
[23:26] love that. Amen. How can I my hand be in
[23:29] my hand?
[23:31] If I do, there's something mentally
[23:32] wrong with me. There's a lot of mentally
[23:34] wrong things wrong with people around
[23:36] the message and denominations, right?
[23:38] How can I? If there's something mentally
[23:40] wrong with me, deny that's my hand. Deny
[23:42] that's my foot. There's something
[23:43] spiritually wrong with a believer that
[23:45] denies any word that God ever said and
[23:48] promised.
[23:50] Hallelujah. There's something
[23:51] spiritually wrong with that so-called
[23:53] believer. You can't deny one letter of
[23:56] him because you become a part of the
[23:57] same. You're part of him because you're
[23:59] baptized in him by the Holy Spirit has
[24:02] brought you into the body of Christ.
[24:04] What a beautiful thing. Oh, it's so
[24:06] beautiful. IF YOU'RE A REAL CHRISTIAN,
[24:08] YOU BELIEVE EVERYTHING IN HERE.
[24:09] HALLELUJAH. AND YOU WON'T LET THE
[24:11] ANTICHRIST SPIRIT DECEIVE YOU AWAY FROM
[24:14] ANY WORD in this Bible.
[24:15] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[24:16] &gt;&gt; You believe all OF IT. IF YOU'VE GOT THE
[24:18] HOLY GHOST, THE HOLY GHOST WILL GUIDE
[24:20] YOU INTO ALL TRUTH. HE'LL SAY, "THIS is
[24:22] the way. This is the wrong way. Go this
[24:24] way. That's the wrong way. STAY RIGHT
[24:25] HERE. THE HOLY GHOST WILL GUIDE YOU
[24:27] EVERY DAY OF YOUR LIFE, EVERY YEAR OF
[24:29] YOUR LIFE." HALLELUJAH.
[24:31] &gt;&gt; If you're really born again,
[24:33] hallelujah. If you're not, you'll be led
[24:35] off astray. And every wind of doctrine
[24:37] will blow you from that side to that
[24:39] side to that church to that revival to
[24:41] that or SOMETHING LIKE THAT. LET'S HAVE
[24:42] THE HOLY GHOST BRIDES REVIVAL. AMEN. THE
[24:45] SAME HOLY Ghost that WAS THERE IN ACTS
[24:47] CHAPTER 2. PRAISE GOD.
[24:52] &gt;&gt; OH, it's beautiful.
[24:54] So, in my studyings, you know, I've been
[24:55] wanting to I want to review the evidence
[24:57] of the Holy Ghost. Brother Dale brought
[24:58] it up, which I was so thankful for a
[25:00] couple weeks ago. I've been wanting to
[25:01] get to this, so I want to bring it up
[25:02] again. Let's look at the evidence of the
[25:04] baptism of the Holy Ghost in 1953. These
[25:07] are exact quotes, so if I'm wrong, you
[25:08] just you tell me. I'll fix it.
[25:15] In 1953, brother Bam said, "The evidence
[25:17] is the Holy Ghost is the love of God."
[25:20] In 1954, he said, "A person that's
[25:23] always so hungering and thirsting for
[25:25] God." So, see, church, that's why if if
[25:26] people, and I say this, you know, to
[25:28] remind us, service after service, if
[25:30] people aren't getting hungry, they don't
[25:31] enjoy the word of God, something's wrong
[25:33] with them. As a Christian, you should
[25:35] hunger for the word of God. I can't wait
[25:37] to hear the word of God. I can't wait to
[25:38] sing a special. I can't wait to go up
[25:40] and pray. You should have a hunger if
[25:42] you're truly born again. IT'S AN
[25:43] EVIDENCE THAT YOU GOT THE HOLY GHOST.
[25:45] HALLELUJAH.
[25:46] &gt;&gt; AMEN. Is that right? Hallelujah. And 57.
[25:49] The evidence of the Holy Ghost is the
[25:51] fruit of the spirit. You have to have
[25:54] love and joy and peace and gentleness
[25:56] and longsuffering. All these attributes
[25:58] of the Holy Ghost. If you have the Holy
[26:00] Ghost, you'll see them in your life.
[26:04] In 1964, brother said the evidence is
[26:06] they sighed and cried day and night for
[26:08] the abominations. If you haven't cried
[26:10] over someone's sin lately, it's time to
[26:12] cry over it.
[26:18] He said in the same year, one day the
[26:20] Lord straightened me out and said it's
[26:21] the evidence is those who could receive
[26:24] the word.
[26:27] And then in 65 he said the evidence is
[26:29] you believe him the word.
[26:32] Then the church age book he says the
[26:34] evidence is you're in the word all the
[26:36] way.
[26:38] So it's very simple church. What is the
[26:40] evidence of the Holy Ghost? It is love.
[26:42] It's hunger and thirsting for God. It's
[26:43] fruits of the spirit. It's sigh and cry
[26:45] for abominations. It's receiving the
[26:46] words. It's believing all the word. It's
[26:48] being in in the word all the way. A
[26:50] Christian lives ALL THE WORD OR
[26:52] EVERYTHING IN THE BIBLE THAT PERTAINS TO
[26:53] THE BRIDE, THE CHRISTIAN does it.
[26:56] &gt;&gt; That's the revelation.
[26:58] Now, but there are people that will go
[27:00] back, preachers that go back and say,
[27:01] "Oh, the love is not the evidence. Uh
[27:03] hungry and thirsting isn't uh the the
[27:05] the fruit of the spirit is not the
[27:06] evidence." But they all are because
[27:08] they're all part of the word of God.
[27:13] &gt;&gt; See, that's why they can be really mean
[27:16] to people, mistreat, name call people,
[27:19] and then still say, "Well, I've got the
[27:20] Holy Ghost." Because they don't think
[27:22] the fruit of the Holy Spirit is the
[27:23] evidence anymore. Right? Or they'll say,
[27:26] "I don't have to pray and fast anymore.
[27:27] I don't have to cry and and sign and cry
[27:29] because that's not the evidence." But
[27:31] see, church, the real believer should
[27:33] want to fulfill all the word of God.
[27:39] Now, in the church age book, Brother Ram
[27:40] lays out these verses.
[27:43] And this is how he lays it out. The word
[27:45] always comes to the truly spiritfilled.
[27:47] I'm picking up right there. That's the
[27:49] evidence of being filled with the Holy
[27:50] Ghost. Like the word came to John,
[27:51] right? The word came to all the
[27:52] prophets.
[27:54] That's the evidence of being filled with
[27:55] the Holy Ghost. That is what Jesus said
[27:57] would be the evidence. He said, "And
[27:58] I'll pray the Father and will send you
[27:59] another comforter that he may abide with
[28:01] you forever, even the Spirit of truth,
[28:03] whom the world cannot receive." Now we
[28:05] know what truth is. Thy word is true. So
[28:08] John 17:17. Next, brother Ram says
[28:11] again, so on the same thought, why do
[28:13] you not understand my speech even
[28:14] because you cannot hear my word? The
[28:18] word. It's receiving all the word of
[28:20] God. Did you notice that Jesus said the
[28:23] world could not receive the Holy Ghost?
[28:24] Well, in the verse I just read, neither
[28:27] could they receive the word because why?
[28:29] The spirit and the word are one. If you
[28:31] have the Holy Spirit as the prophets,
[28:33] the word would come to you. You would
[28:35] receive it. Oh my. Amen. Anyone who has
[28:38] THE HOLY GHOST, CHURCH, you don't got to
[28:40] worry about it. THE WORD WILL COME TO
[28:42] YOU. PRAISE GOD.
[28:44] &gt;&gt; In other words, God will chase his elect
[28:46] children down. GOD WILL LEAVE THE 99 TO
[28:48] GO GET THE ONE WHO he knows wants the
[28:51] word.
[28:51] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[28:53] &gt;&gt; And I love this one. I use this many
[28:55] times. No, that's not the one. the next
[28:58] one. But notice brother M used this many
[29:01] times. The comforter which is the Holy
[29:02] Ghost whom the father will send in my
[29:04] name. He shall teach you all things.
[29:06] This is why teaching receiving teaching
[29:08] from the message in the Bible is so
[29:10] important. If you can't be taught
[29:12] something more in the word of God, you
[29:14] don't have the Holy Ghost.
[29:16] If you just stay on the same thing and
[29:18] you never grow in any understanding like
[29:20] let's say on the statute of perfect man
[29:21] or the baptism of the Holy Ghost or the
[29:23] mystery of godliness or the mystery of
[29:25] uh uh the mother harlot or the mystery
[29:27] of the rapture. If you never grow into
[29:29] any areas, it's it's time to look and
[29:31] see, am I really born again? Am I
[29:33] growing in revelation or not? Because
[29:36] Jesus said the Holy Ghost will teach you
[29:38] all things
[29:40] and it'll bring all things to
[29:42] remembrance. That's right. Oh, thank God
[29:43] I forgot about that verse. That's right.
[29:45] It will bring it to my remembrance
[29:48] whatsoever I've said unto you. Here
[29:50] again, we find the word coming because
[29:52] of the spirit of God. I had an extra
[29:54] word there. I forgot to delete. This is
[29:56] the one I use all the time. I just use
[29:57] it with brother Brendan.
[29:59] How be it when he he the spirit of
[30:01] truth, the word has come. He will guide
[30:03] you into all truth. Thy word is truth.
[30:05] And he shall not speak of himself, but
[30:07] whatsoever he shall hear the word of
[30:09] God, that shall he speak word, and he
[30:11] will show you things to come.
[30:13] spirit bringing the word of prophecy.
[30:16] Hallelujah.
[30:18] So this is what I told our brother, you
[30:20] know, our brother Brennan came to our
[30:21] house and had a wonderful time. This is
[30:22] what I told him at the beginning. I
[30:25] said, "Brother, you know, he was asking
[30:27] me about Cath Catholic doctrine and I
[30:28] shared him, you know, my general belief
[30:30] that the mother harlot is the Roman
[30:31] Catholic Church." This kind of sobered
[30:33] him up a little bit. But I I said,
[30:34] "Brother, I said, but you know, he we we
[30:37] agreed. He agreed with me that Jesus is
[30:39] the son of God. He died on the cross. He
[30:41] resurrected, right? God sent the Holy
[30:44] Ghost. We agreed on all these things.
[30:46] But I said, "Brother, on the things we
[30:48] differ, this is a test. And God wants to
[30:50] see, are you going to go further on with
[30:52] the Lord? Are you going to let God guide
[30:55] you, I'll say, out of this wilderness
[30:58] into the promised land, the baptism of
[31:00] the Holy Ghost?" Now, think about people
[31:02] that stay in denominations or in this
[31:04] message, and fail to go on to the Holy
[31:05] Ghost. They've just stopped there in the
[31:07] wilderness and they're just walking
[31:08] around in circles year after year. They
[31:10] never they never feel like they move on
[31:12] or accomplish anything for the kingdom
[31:14] of God. God, help us to move on and do
[31:16] something. Praise God. Move on and do
[31:20] something for the glory of God. Find
[31:22] what God's commissioned you to do. What
[31:23] has God called you to do? Find that.
[31:26] Stay with it.
[31:28] &gt;&gt; Find what God has given you a a charisma
[31:31] to do. Charisma is grace. What grace has
[31:34] God given you? What are you especially
[31:35] good at under when you're under the Holy
[31:37] Ghost anointing? That's what you should
[31:39] dedicate the majority of your life to.
[31:45] Think about that. Now, first thing we
[31:46] just first thing is everybody's life, we
[31:48] just in everyone's life, you need to get
[31:50] under the Holy Ghost first and then see
[31:52] what God can do with you. You do that by
[31:54] repenting, seeking God, keeping out the
[31:56] things of the world and just con being
[31:58] consecrated to Jesus Christ. So you so
[32:01] you you could say, "I'm under the
[32:02] anointing right now." Like I believe I'm
[32:04] under the anointing right now. I believe
[32:06] that by God's grace.
[32:08] But everybody first has to get under
[32:10] that anointing. When you get under that
[32:12] anointing, then God will start using you
[32:14] in ways you don't really know about. And
[32:16] God will show you the gift in your life.
[32:18] How God wants to use you.
[32:24] Oh, did I read I didn't finish that.
[32:25] Yeah. I Let's Let's finish that. I want
[32:28] you to know very carefully that Jesus
[32:30] did not say that the evidence of being
[32:31] baptized with the Holy Ghost was
[32:32] speaking in tongues, interpreting,
[32:34] prophesying, or shouting or dancing.
[32:36] Those are all good things. I like all
[32:37] those. We like all those. He said the
[32:40] evidence would be that you would be in
[32:42] the truth. You would be in the word of
[32:45] God for your age. Evidence has to do
[32:48] with receiving that word.
[32:54] So that was a brief review on the
[32:55] evidence of the Holy Ghost. How many
[32:56] appreciated that by God's grace is it's
[32:58] not that we throw these quotes out and
[33:00] that quote if it's a scriptural quote we
[33:02] keep it. Now there are quotes you know
[33:03] where brother man made mistakes. He said
[33:05] I make mistakes all the time on the
[33:06] tapes. He said I make mixups. He said
[33:08] but when you got those he said look in
[33:10] the Bible. But all these quotes on the
[33:12] evidence of the Holy Ghost if you put
[33:13] them all together and you go back to the
[33:15] Bible that makes sense. A Holy Ghost fil
[33:17] Christian should do all these things.
[33:20] Hallelujah.
[33:24] Now, here's what I want to get to now
[33:25] for each person here today. If the foot
[33:28] shall say, "Because I'm not the hand,
[33:30] I'm not of the body." Is it therefore
[33:32] not of the body? So, just because
[33:34] somebody says, "Well, I'm not like
[33:36] brother so and so, I don't do I don't
[33:37] act like sister so and so. I'm not part
[33:39] of the body of Christ." Of course, we
[33:42] know what the answer is. No, right?
[33:44] Verse 16. And if the ear shall say,
[33:46] "Because I'm not the eye, I'm not the
[33:47] body." Is it therefore not of the body?
[33:50] Just because somebody's not like
[33:51] somebody else, does that prove that
[33:53] you're not a part of the body of Christ?
[33:55] The answer is no. God is a God of
[33:58] variety. How many times have we heard
[33:59] that quote from other Brandham? Right?
[34:00] God loves variety.
[34:03] If the whole body were an I, which I
[34:06] represents revelation, right? Seers,
[34:08] prophets, understanding. If everybody
[34:11] was a prophet, think about that. If
[34:14] everybody was like brother Ram, saying,
[34:15] "Thus say the Lord, thus say the Lord
[34:16] all the time, there'd be nobody to
[34:18] receive it. Because everybody would just
[34:20] be speaking all the time. Thus sayith
[34:21] the Lord. Thus sayith the Lord. Thus
[34:22] sayith the Lord. Thus sayith the Lord.
[34:24] Who? Everybody's just speaking. Nobody's
[34:26] hearing.
[34:29] If the hole were hearing, where were the
[34:32] smelling?
[34:35] I bet some of you if you ever had a
[34:36] carbon monoxide smell or if you ever had
[34:39] gas leak or something like that, I bet
[34:40] you're really thankful for the smell,
[34:42] the sense of smell, right? So you don't
[34:43] blow blow the apartment up or blow your
[34:45] house up, right? Thank God. And that's
[34:48] how it is in the body of Christ. Thank
[34:49] God for each and every gift. Thank God
[34:52] for everybody being baptized with the
[34:54] Holy Ghost who is baptized with the Holy
[34:56] Ghost. And thank God that they can do
[34:58] what God's called them to do. It's like
[35:00] one time Cam really helped me out when I
[35:02] was writing the Modesty book. I had uh I
[35:04] had something off on earrings. I think
[35:06] it was earrings. Yes. Because I hadn't
[35:09] really looked at the verses in a certain
[35:10] way. I was going to say in the book
[35:12] something like, "Well, maybe you could
[35:13] wear earrings like this or that."
[35:15] Clipons. I was going to say like clipons
[35:17] or something like that. And then Cam
[35:19] wrote me back and said, "Brother," I
[35:20] think it was discernment. He said, "Look
[35:22] at it from this angle. There was like 14
[35:24] verses on earrings." He said, "The
[35:26] majority of them condemn earrings."
[35:29] And that really helped me out. I was
[35:30] like, "Oh yeah, now I can take it to
[35:31] that route, right?" And then and then at
[35:34] less
[35:36] earrings with believers in the Old
[35:38] Testament, we don't even know that they
[35:39] wore them in in some cases, right? We
[35:42] don't even know. but they could have
[35:43] been used just for trade or a gift maybe
[35:45] like a gold or silver and you could melt
[35:47] it down and something like that. So, it
[35:48] gave me such a better balance. I'm
[35:50] thankful that that my brother Cam has a
[35:53] gift of the Holy Spirit because it
[35:55] helped me out. Praise God before I put
[35:58] that book into publish before it went
[36:00] public. Hallelujah. Now, church, if
[36:02] you're honest, I hope somebody has
[36:03] helped you around here with something
[36:05] you might have got wrong. I I just want
[36:07] to be honest enough to admit it by God's
[36:08] grace. Brother man was honest enough to
[36:11] admit his mistakes on tape to the whole
[36:13] world. Like lying to the IRS, right?
[36:16] Like missing the brown bear vision. He
[36:18] said, "God did his part. Uh but brother
[36:20] disobeyed his part." And he he repented.
[36:22] He said, "God forgive me. These people
[36:24] looked at me as a prophet." He said,
[36:25] "God forgive me that I failed the
[36:26] vision." But then if you go go look at
[36:28] all the other prophets, almost every
[36:30] prophet failed some, thus sayith the
[36:32] Lord. Right? God told Abraham, he said,
[36:35] "Separate yourself." Abraham took his
[36:37] dad and Lot.
[36:39] He disobeyed thus sayith the Lord.
[36:42] Church, how many times do we disobey
[36:44] thus sayith the Lord?
[36:47] How many times do we disobey something
[36:48] in the Bible?
[36:54] So verse 15 and 16 show how some
[36:56] Christians isolate and pity themselves.
[36:58] This is the act of Satan.
[37:01] Satan anoints them. Well, I'm not like
[37:04] brother so and so. I'm not like sister
[37:06] so and so. Maybe I'm not a good message
[37:07] believer. Maybe I'm not. Maybe I maybe I
[37:11] I' I've had people email me this. They
[37:13] said, "Brother Jesse, maybe I'm serpent
[37:14] seed." I said, "Rebuke that demon. You
[37:17] wouldn't be emailing me if you were
[37:18] serpent seed trying to get right with
[37:20] God. That's the very proof you are a
[37:22] seed of God.
[37:24] But don't let don't let the devil
[37:26] isolate you." Well, I'm not like sister
[37:28] so and so, so I'm nobody. That's a lion
[37:31] devil. He needs cast down in Jesus name.
[37:35] Cast down anything that exalts itself
[37:38] against the word of God.
[37:40] Hallelujah.
[37:42] Well, I'm not a preacher. I'm not like
[37:44] Malachi. I'm not like Victoria and
[37:46] Lydia. I can't sing like so and so.
[37:50] You're still part of the body of Christ.
[37:53] And you are extremely important.
[37:56] The verse just proved it. If you caught
[37:57] it up here,
[37:59] the verse just proved it. Which of those
[38:02] body parts is the foundation that we
[38:03] forget about all the time? The foot. The
[38:06] foot is the lowliest part. We're all
[38:09] looking up. Look what I can do. Look at
[38:11] my face. Look at my smile. Look at my
[38:13] hair, my long hair. Look at me. I got
[38:14] short hair. We We dress up this all
[38:17] right here. But we we couldn't get this
[38:19] nowhere if it wasn't for the humble feet
[38:21] that we got.
[38:24] Is that right, church? So, we honor we
[38:26] dress up the face. We dress up maybe our
[38:28] hands or whatever more with a ring or
[38:30] necklace or something. We dress up our
[38:32] neck. But all these other parts that we
[38:35] think are less honorable, they're more
[38:37] important
[38:39] or just as important, we could say.
[38:44] So church, just don't just don't take
[38:46] the lie of the devil. Don't take his
[38:47] pity.
[38:49] Don't take his pity. Take take God's
[38:52] purpose for your life.
[38:54] &gt;&gt; Don't accept pity. Accept God's purpose.
[38:57] If you don't know it yet, just keep
[38:58] seeking God. God's got a plan. Amen.
[39:01] Moses had to wait 80 years until he was
[39:03] used by God. Hallelujah. Amen. ABRAHAM
[39:05] HAD TO WAIT 25 YEARS FOR ISAAC. YOU JUST
[39:07] KEEP WAITING ON GOD. HALLELUJAH.
[39:10] &gt;&gt; Don't give up on God.
[39:12] &gt;&gt; And take some lie, some pity nonsense
[39:14] from hell. It come from the demons in
[39:16] hell.
[39:17] You're part of the body of Christ.
[39:19] THAT'S WHY YOU'RE HERE. YOU LOVE THE
[39:20] WORD. NOW, do you do you need to be more
[39:22] in love with the word? Yes, WE ALL DO.
[39:23] SO, LET'S ACT LIKE IT. HALLELUJAH. LET'S
[39:26] DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT TODAY OR TOMORROW
[39:27] WHERE WE CAN BE MORE IN LOVE with God's
[39:29] word.
[39:31] &gt;&gt; Don't be just a hearer, be a doer of
[39:33] God's word.
[39:36] So look, look at this. We see foot,
[39:38] hand,
[39:41] ear, eye, eye, hearing, smelling. Each
[39:46] of these have a spiritual significance.
[39:48] And church, each one is so important.
[39:51] What if I plug your ears, brother, right
[39:54] now? Could he get anything out of
[39:55] service if I plugged his ears right now?
[39:57] He He could see me, though. He could see
[39:59] me.
[40:01] He could see me move my mouth, but he
[40:02] wouldn't know what's being said. How
[40:04] important is the hearing?
[40:07] How important are the feet that you
[40:08] could actually walk to church today?
[40:09] You're not in a wheelchair.
[40:11] You don't have amputated feet. How how
[40:15] blessed you are. Every part is so
[40:17] important. So, that's why I'm so
[40:19] thankful when people keep coming back to
[40:20] the house of God. Hallelujah. because
[40:24] you're playing a part of God. It might
[40:25] not be the obvious part that everybody
[40:27] sees on the on the live stream.
[40:28] Everybody sees just this. They don't see
[40:30] back here.
[40:33] Or we can have this. We can't have this
[40:35] unless we have this.
[40:39] So, I got some emojis for the children
[40:41] because they like emojis, right? Who
[40:43] doesn't like a little technology? What's
[40:45] the natural purpose of the foot? Well,
[40:47] it's lowly to the ground, but it's very
[40:49] strong. It moves and carries everyone
[40:52] else. It's like the foundation
[40:56] and it represents humility, right? Jesus
[40:58] poured water in the basin. He began to
[41:00] wash their feet. So the humility of
[41:03] bowing down to the feet, washing the
[41:05] feet, the dirtiest part, the most humble
[41:07] part, the foundational part that nobody
[41:10] wants to touch.
[41:12] Honestly,
[41:14] who which one of us would want to touch
[41:16] sweaty feet at the end of the day?
[41:19] Take a shower, brother. Then I'll wash
[41:21] your feet. Right. [laughter]
[41:26] Really? It's just slowly. It's the Don't
[41:29] look at my nails. I've had my toenails
[41:31] stepped on so many times. Some when when
[41:33] you wash my feet, I'll just let this
[41:34] out. I've had I'm playing football and
[41:36] I've had so many people step on my toes.
[41:37] My toes are cracked. My my toenails are
[41:40] cracked and it just it's not a good
[41:41] thing to look at. Now you Now you're
[41:43] glad you sisters, right? You don't have
[41:44] to wash my feet. It just it's just it's
[41:47] the lowest. But it's foundational
[41:50] though.
[41:51] And the Bible calls them beautiful.
[41:54] How beautiful are the feet,
[41:57] THE CARRIERS THAT PREACH THE GOSPEL of
[41:59] peace. Hallelujah.
[42:02] They're ugly to us, sweaty, all these
[42:04] things. But God calls them beautiful
[42:06] because they provide foundation. They
[42:08] carry the word WHERE IT NEEDS
[42:10] [screaming] TO GO. HALLELUJAH.
[42:11] &gt;&gt; AMEN.
[42:13] &gt;&gt; But it's not the one that we dress up
[42:15] and well, some of us might buy fancy
[42:17] Jordans. Look at me. I got Jordans. or
[42:19] I've got my LeBron on. Or for the women,
[42:22] it's like, I got my high heels. Well,
[42:23] it's time to repent of those. I'd
[42:24] probably repent. I'd probably repent of
[42:26] those Jordans myself, too. You might as
[42:28] well do that. You just spent $300 on
[42:30] them. Should have got something more
[42:31] important. Hallelujah. So, repent of all
[42:35] that. Amen. Hallelujah. But God calls
[42:38] them beautiful when they're used for the
[42:40] glory of God, for the kingdom of God.
[42:43] What these feet say? Well, I'm not like
[42:46] I'm not like the face. I'm not like the
[42:47] tongue.
[42:49] I guess I'm not I guess I'm nothing. I
[42:50] guess I'm not I'm not important. Like,
[42:52] oh, no, no, no. You are so important.
[42:56] Try to get to work or try to go to the
[42:58] grocery store without your feet.
[43:00] Your knees are going to be in a lot of
[43:01] pain by the time you actually get there.
[43:04] If you get there,
[43:06] hallelujah.
[43:08] But we think, "Oh, this brother, that
[43:10] sister, I can never be as important as
[43:11] them." You got to change your thinking.
[43:14] &gt;&gt; You have to accept the word of God, not
[43:16] lies. And we're all commanded to cast
[43:19] down lies that exalt anything that
[43:22] exalts itself against the word of God,
[43:24] cast it down.
[43:28] The hand,
[43:31] the hand makes direct action like work,
[43:34] like building, serving, strumming, or
[43:37] what do you call this? Playing. Playing
[43:40] striking. Hands would tend to get more
[43:43] glory than the feet, don't they?
[43:45] People got gloves on. People got look
[43:47] look at the work the people painting.
[43:49] Look at this. This whole time someone's
[43:50] painting or building like Malachi's in
[43:52] construction. The whole time they're all
[43:54] they they just see the hands but they
[43:56] don't see the feet down there giving it
[43:57] foundation.
[43:59] Look what I built or look what I wrote.
[44:01] Look at my look look at this. Look at
[44:03] this. The hands get so much glory.
[44:10] But they can't see without the eyes.
[44:12] They can't get the tools and the
[44:13] materials without the feet. They can't
[44:14] hear what to do without the ears.
[44:19] The Bible said, "Whatsoever thy hand
[44:20] findeth iteth to do, do it with all thy
[44:22] might." So hands are like the doing, the
[44:23] action, the publicly seen testimonies.
[44:26] We'd say,
[44:28] "Lay hands on the sick and they shall
[44:30] recover." They're the agents of contact,
[44:34] right? It's the point of contact between
[44:36] uh we'd say uh natural and supernatural,
[44:39] right? Lay hands on the sick and they'll
[44:41] recover. something supernatural is going
[44:43] to happen because that hand was there.
[44:44] But the hand can't be there without the
[44:46] rest of the body.
[44:48] The ear ears receive invisible waves or
[44:52] vibrations, right? Sound waves, and they
[44:54] turn them into a meaningful message.
[44:56] Think about that. With ears, they take
[44:58] something invisible right now and turns
[45:00] into something spiritual. I know what
[45:02] Brother Jesse's talking about
[45:04] through an invisible a visible realm.
[45:07] Amen. Glory. Hallelujah. Praise God. It
[45:11] requires trust. You have to trust your
[45:12] ears because they work in darkness or
[45:15] light. We could all turn off the lights,
[45:16] close our eyes, but we could still get
[45:18] out as long as we can hear the door, the
[45:20] opening, closing of the door, the voice.
[45:22] Oh, follow me, brother Jess. Follow me,
[45:23] Jose. Jose is going to lead you out.
[45:27] As long as we have that, as long as long
[45:29] as we can hear,
[45:32] we can have trust in what we hear. And
[45:34] so ears are not dependent upon visible
[45:37] evidence. Hallelujah. Faith is the
[45:40] substance of things not seen.
[45:43] So hearing is we'd say spiritually
[45:47] people that receive faith,
[45:50] right? So then faith cometh by hearing,
[45:52] hearing by the word of God. Hearing is
[45:55] also receiving. Thine ears shall hear a
[45:57] word behind thee saying, "This is the
[45:59] way. Walk ye in." And aren't you glad
[46:01] you heard that message for message for
[46:03] this hour? Hallelujah. I was walking in
[46:06] the Baptist way. I was walking the
[46:07] Presbyterian way, the Pentecostal way. I
[46:08] was walking all these ways, but then I
[46:10] heard a voice say, "This is the way."
[46:12] The message is THE WAY. WILLIAM BRANDHAM
[46:14] IS THE PROPHET OF GOD. HALLELUJAH.
[46:16] Brother Jose, I've walked in it since
[46:18] 2001. Hallelujah. Amen.
[46:24] The eyes, the last one. No, I'm sorry.
[46:26] There's one more smell. The eyes are
[46:27] depend upon light, but work only when
[46:30] open and focused. See, if your eyes
[46:32] aren't focused, even if they're open,
[46:33] they won't work. If they work, but
[46:35] they're not open, you're not going to
[46:36] get anything out of it. Vision gives
[46:39] confidence because it's based on what is
[46:41] seen and understood. So the eyes
[46:44] represent revelation, light and
[46:46] understanding.
[46:48] The light of the body is the eye. I will
[46:51] guide thee with mine eye. The eyes of
[46:54] your understanding being enlightened.
[46:58] Now verse 17 says, if the whole body
[47:00] were an eye, where were the hearing? If
[47:03] the whole were hearing, where were the
[47:05] smelling?
[47:07] Verse 17 speaks of smelling. Burnt
[47:10] offerings were connected to sweet
[47:11] smelling savors received by God in
[47:13] worship and then represented
[47:15] thanksgiving in total consecration and
[47:18] devotion.
[47:19] The first one is Noah. Noah gave a burnt
[47:22] offering. In other words, he burnt the
[47:23] entire animal. He didn't save anything
[47:25] for him and his family.
[47:28] It was total thanksgiving. Thank you,
[47:30] God, for bringing me through the
[47:31] tribulation period. Oh, but church, we
[47:33] should be thankful. We should offer
[47:34] burnt offerings now. Thank you that I'm
[47:36] not going to go through the tribulation
[47:37] period.
[47:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Thank God that I'm going the
[47:40] rapture. Praise God
[47:42] &gt;&gt; and just give a total thanksgiving
[47:44] offering to God.
[47:47] Leviticus 1 1-9. Chris told me he was
[47:49] reading through this and it was hard to
[47:50] understand. It is you. We need need a
[47:52] lot of types of Christ.
[47:55] The Bible calls the burnt offering a
[47:56] sweet savor. So God smells it in heaven.
[47:59] When it's a burnt offering, the nose.
[48:02] And now there's a part of God's body on
[48:04] earth that's like his nose.
[48:11] The worshipper off offered and a
[48:14] complete animal sacrifice to God. None
[48:18] of it was shared with man. Everything
[48:19] was given to God. Leviticus 6 speaks and
[48:22] then you know the uh the workers in
[48:25] Moses tabernacle all day they had to do
[48:28] burnt offerings every single day.
[48:31] There was no break. There was no get up
[48:33] or there was no letup. It's just like
[48:34] you and I, we got to go to the grocery
[48:35] store what every couple days or we got
[48:37] to keep going back to the fridge every
[48:38] day or the freezer. Every day go back
[48:40] there. That's how God set it up. Every
[48:41] day there's going to be burnt offering.
[48:43] Every day there's going to be
[48:44] thanksgiving given to my name.
[48:50] Paul said Christ gave himself as an
[48:52] offering and sacrifice for a sweet
[48:54] smelling savor to God. So here we see a
[48:56] burnt offering is a total sacrifice.
[49:00] the Philippians gifts for Paul's
[49:02] physical needs. Paul said, "We're a
[49:04] sweet saver to God." See that church,
[49:06] when you try to help somebody out in on
[49:09] this earth and you give them either
[49:11] money or something that they need or
[49:12] clothes or something, God goes like this
[49:15] in heaven, he says, "I receive that.
[49:18] I enjoy that. That's delightful to me."
[49:22] Because it's a sacrifice.
[49:25] You lost something, right? You gave up
[49:26] something so that somebody else could
[49:28] have what they need. And the Bible calls
[49:31] that a sweet savor.
[49:36] And remember church, that's like those
[49:37] 10 lepers. Remember how many came back
[49:39] and actually gave the sweet savor? One.
[49:42] A tenth. One out of 10 actually came
[49:44] back and said, "Thank you, Jesus, for
[49:46] for for healing me from my leprosy."
[49:49] Church, we ought to be we ought to be
[49:50] able to say, "Thank God that you saved
[49:52] me from my sins today. Thank God you
[49:55] brought me out of the worldly condition
[49:56] I was in. Thank God you brought me out
[49:58] of dead denominationalism.
[50:00] Hallelujah. Thank you for opening up my
[50:02] eyes. Thank you for healing my body.
[50:04] Thank you for healing my soul. Praise
[50:05] God. Thank you for healing my mind.
[50:09] Thank you, Lord. I come back to give you
[50:11] thanks for that, church. And I I'll
[50:13] spend the rest of my life coming back to
[50:14] thank God for that. That's the joy of my
[50:16] life, Brother Vang. That's the joy of
[50:18] our lives. I'll spend the rest of my
[50:20] life come back say, "Thank you, Jesus,
[50:21] for saving me from my sins. Thank you
[50:23] for washing IT AWAY WITH YOUR PRECIOUS
[50:25] BLOOD. THANK YOU THAT YOU WON'T CONDEMN
[50:27] me on the day of judgment because of the
[50:29] blood of Jesus Christ.
[50:34] Now this is quite an interesting
[50:35] scripture. Paul said he looked for
[50:37] someone to fellow I think it was Titus
[50:38] but he couldn't find him. But he says he
[50:41] says you need to know that you are a
[50:43] sweet smelling savor to the world and to
[50:45] the church. He said one is unto death.
[50:49] The other is unto life. And because of
[50:52] their sincerity,
[50:54] Paul said, "You are a s sweet smelling
[50:57] savor unto the believers." So see
[51:00] church, the more sincere we are, the
[51:02] more devoted we are, the more we
[51:04] sacrifice for Jesus. That's the nose of
[51:06] the body. You become the nose of the
[51:09] body if you're fully devoted,
[51:11] consecrated.
[51:13] And church, not everybody is like that,
[51:17] right? Just like not everybody's the
[51:19] feet, not everybody's the nose, not
[51:21] everybody's the eyes, not everybody's
[51:23] the ears.
[51:25] So, I hope this will open it up for
[51:26] somebody today by God's grace.
[51:29] So, what's the summary? If you're the
[51:31] feet, you're more gifted in the way of
[51:34] being behind the scenes
[51:38] providing strength, stability,
[51:40] foundation. I'm talking about to the
[51:41] body of Christ.
[51:44] And you're more beautiful. You're
[51:45] beautiful in God's sight. although
[51:48] underappreciated.
[51:50] Is that right? Isn't that what the Bible
[51:52] says? If you're the hand, you're more
[51:55] gifted and you're more visible in public
[51:58] with your works and seen and praised by
[52:00] all. But I'll say like this, you got to
[52:02] be careful not to get lifted up.
[52:04] But God just chose you as the hand to be
[52:06] used by God to do it publicly so people
[52:08] can see it. Remember, this couldn't be
[52:11] done. The hand can't be done without the
[52:13] feet. If you're the eyes, you're more
[52:16] gifted in receiving the revealed truths
[52:18] of God and giving understanding and
[52:21] guidance. Remember, these can be
[52:23] sisters, too, through the word of
[52:25] knowledge and the word of wisdom and
[52:26] prophecy.
[52:28] Some people, so don't be jealous.
[52:30] Somebody gets more revelation, somebody
[52:31] gets more uh they're just more strong
[52:33] and stable or they they everybody sees
[52:36] these testimonies that they do in
[52:37] public. Don't be discouraged. Just find
[52:39] what you are and say what you are
[52:42] &gt;&gt; and pray for the people. Pray for other
[52:45] people. Don't don't envy them. Pray for
[52:47] them. Praise God.
[52:49] And then they'll pray for you. I'm sure
[52:50] if they're a real Christian, they'll
[52:52] pray for the whole body of Christ.
[52:55] If you are the ears, you're more gifted
[52:57] in receiving the unseen truths of God.
[53:00] Right? Those ears receive the invisible
[53:02] things. You just get a word of faith.
[53:04] You just get a word. Something invisible
[53:06] just drops into your heart. Other people
[53:09] don't have that ability to catch it
[53:11] because they're not an eardrum, right?
[53:12] Eard drum can catch those waves. The
[53:15] other body parts can't catch it. That
[53:16] doesn't make you any better. It makes
[53:18] you special for a purpose.
[53:21] And then you will give trust to others
[53:24] and you'll give more assurance of their
[53:26] faith to others. That's the part of that
[53:28] you play in the body of Christ.
[53:32] Now, if you're the smelling, if you're
[53:34] the smelling part of the body, you're
[53:36] more gifted with greater devotion to
[53:39] God,
[53:41] you give more sacrifices than other
[53:43] people. I'm talking about food, shelter,
[53:45] clothing, anything, housing, people,
[53:49] thanksgiving, whatever, maybe praise,
[53:51] worship. You're more consecrated towards
[53:54] God and his children
[53:57] if you are the smelling.
[53:59] Now, what I want to say, too, is don't
[54:02] neglect what God's called you to be.
[54:05] Brother said, "Don't try to be something
[54:06] that you're not." Like Ananas and
[54:08] Safire. What do they try to do? They try
[54:10] to be the nose. Well, I'm so devoted. I
[54:13] gave all this money. PETER SAID, "YOU'VE
[54:15] LIED TO THE HOLY GHOST.
[54:18] You're not the nose." Hallelujah.
[54:22] God took them home. If if they were even
[54:24] saved, I'm not even sure if they were
[54:26] saved. Right? See, don't try to be
[54:29] something that you're not. Be something
[54:31] that God made you to be. As I said, get
[54:34] under the anointing of the Holy Ghost.
[54:35] Spend a whole day fast and praying. And
[54:36] then, like the Bible says in Isaiah 58,
[54:38] then go out and start giving to people
[54:40] and see where God blesses your works.
[54:43] Now, for me, I got to study and shut in
[54:44] and pray, right? And so, I see God bless
[54:46] the sermons that he gave me. It wasn't
[54:49] me. It was him. He gave it to me. And
[54:52] then God uses the word to transform
[54:54] lives and to strengthen people and help
[54:56] them or deliver them or give them hope
[54:58] or raise their faith or something like
[55:00] that. It's just it's it's the calling of
[55:02] God. IT'S THE PART OF THE BODY THAT
[55:03] YOU'RE CALLED TO BE.
[55:10] NOW, that's just I had some thoughts
[55:11] about moms or I'm going to skip past
[55:12] that one. If you want to read it later,
[55:13] let me know. I'll text it to you. It
[55:15] just seemed like moms are so
[55:16] underappreciated. Moms are always behind
[55:17] the scene. Moms are called the
[55:18] cornerstones. So I just saw a connection
[55:20] there with feet and cornerstones and
[55:22] mothers. The Bible said the mother's
[55:24] like a cornerstone. That's thus sayith
[55:26] the scripture. Hallelujah. That's why
[55:29] brother Brandham said she's my backbone.
[55:31] Right. Give all the credit in this
[55:32] family to Sister Me Brandom.
[55:37] Verse 18. But now hath God set the
[55:39] members, every one of them in the body
[55:41] as it has pleased him. And if they were
[55:44] all one member, where were the body?
[55:46] See, if we were all tongues, we'd have
[55:49] no ears to hear what's being said.
[55:52] But now are they many members, yet one
[55:54] body. Now listen, church, God place you
[55:56] with the gifts that please him in order
[55:58] to fit perfectly into the body of
[55:59] Christ.
[56:01] God is trustworthy. So keep hungering
[56:03] and thirsting after God, and you'll see
[56:06] God use your gifts. Now, just another
[56:09] example is this Wednesday. Remember
[56:10] Wednesday at the service, I just start
[56:11] off by talking about Halloween. I was
[56:13] just saying, "Okay, here comes Halloween
[56:15] again." every year this awful dreadful
[56:16] day of the year, which it is.
[56:20] But something just kind of prompted me
[56:22] to to say how I I handle it at school.
[56:25] So at school, girls will run up to me
[56:26] and say, "Look, Mr. Smith, I'm a witch.
[56:28] What do you don't you like my outfit?"
[56:29] I'll say, "Oh, I think you'd be a better
[56:31] angel."
[56:34] But I'll say, "I love you." With teacher
[56:36] love,
[56:39] right?
[56:41] And the Bible says to the pure all
[56:43] things are pure. Anytime like we had a
[56:45] little baby dressed up as a
[56:46] Frankenstein. Now that's not cute to me.
[56:48] We had a little baby dress. But if a
[56:50] baby dressed up like a turkey, that's
[56:52] really cute.
[56:55] Like t take away all the demons and all
[56:57] the the blood. If you just have a child
[56:59] in a turkey outfit, that's cute.
[57:02] I think that's really cute. Right. So
[57:06] like at school, if the kids are just
[57:07] dressed up like harmless things, that's
[57:09] cute.
[57:11] Now, thank God the school outlaw there's
[57:13] no blood anymore. Of course, thank God
[57:14] for that. But they can dress up as demon
[57:16] demon hunters, but yet they're really
[57:18] those are the demons, right? Because
[57:20] they're they're not Christians. They're
[57:22] not angels. So, it's contradictory.
[57:25] But I shared that on Wednesday how I
[57:26] handle that. Oh, yeah. A girl come up to
[57:28] me and say, "Mr. Smith, did she actually
[57:30] did it a couple days ago and she said,
[57:32] "Mr. Smith, do you like my hair got
[57:34] cut?" I said, "Do you like it, honey?" I
[57:38] said, "I'm glad you like it."
[57:41] Right?
[57:42] You like I can't say I like it because I
[57:44] don't like it. I'm glad she likes it,
[57:47] right? I'm glad she didn't get a bad
[57:48] haircut. If you're going to get a
[57:49] haircut, get a good one or get one that
[57:51] looks actually nice, but it's still
[57:53] cutting off your glory.
[57:55] But I can't say, "Oh, I just love how
[57:57] you cut your hair." A girl Yeah. a girl
[58:00] walked up to me on Friday said, "Mr.
[58:01] Smith, I'm wearing makeup." That was
[58:02] another fresh test for me.
[58:05] I said, "Oh," I said, "You're beautiful
[58:07] without makeup." Is what I said.
[58:09] [laughter]
[58:11] I didn't say I like makeup. I said,
[58:13] "You're beautiful without makeup."
[58:18] But somebody texted me this week and
[58:20] said, "Thank you for the wisdom of God
[58:21] to handle that because this person is in
[58:23] the same field as me in education." In
[58:25] other words, you can't avoid Halloween.
[58:27] You can't avoid all these things. You
[58:29] got to have you have to have a word to
[58:30] answer in the due season.
[58:33] So, I just get a text saying, "Thank you
[58:34] for your wisdom." I didn't know it was
[58:36] wisdom. That's just how I'm trying to as
[58:38] a Christian. I'm trying to handle these
[58:39] things. To the pure, all things are
[58:41] pure, right? have a word to say. Lord,
[58:43] give me a word. Let me be in season and
[58:45] out of season. So this person took time
[58:48] to say thank you for the wisdom. I
[58:49] didn't plan to say it. I felt it was the
[58:51] Holy Spirit.
[58:53] The eye cannot say to the hand, well, I
[58:56] have no need of you. These great works
[58:58] that you do, these beautiful paintings
[59:00] that you do, this this beautiful
[59:01] handiwork that you do, nor again the
[59:04] head to the feet, and I have no need.
[59:06] The head's the head can't say, "I don't
[59:07] need your feet." The head can't get
[59:08] anywhere without the feet.
[59:12] Nay, now look what the Bible says. No,
[59:14] no, much more those members of the body
[59:17] which seem to be more feeble are the
[59:20] necessary ones.
[59:23] Wow. Feet are really necessary. Even
[59:25] though they get sweaty, stinky, they get
[59:28] stepped on all the time. They're the
[59:29] ones stepping. But for the type, they're
[59:33] the ones everybody forgets about,
[59:35] doesn't notice. Like, you sure can look
[59:37] clean, but your shoes could be sweaty.
[59:40] Hate to be so graphic, but this is the
[59:42] this is the illustration we're given.
[59:46] My how much more necessary are the feet.
[59:52] I don't think any of you would want to
[59:53] go today without your feet.
[59:56] Verse 23. And those members of the body
[59:59] which we think to be less honorable.
[1:00:01] Well, who's the most honorable?
[1:00:03] Everybody up front. Pulpit and
[1:00:05] musicians. Definitely the most
[1:00:07] honorable. We would think, "Oh, I love
[1:00:10] that message you preached, Brother
[1:00:11] Jesse." Nobody ever says, "Ah, I loved
[1:00:13] how you amen the word of God, brother,
[1:00:15] sister so and so,
[1:00:17] or thank you for coming, sister so and
[1:00:19] so. I really enjoyed how you came to
[1:00:21] service today."
[1:00:23] Whatever I say, well, thank you for
[1:00:24] preaching, but thank you. I really
[1:00:25] enjoyed that song today. So, who's the
[1:00:27] most honorable ones? We think it's those
[1:00:29] who are up in the front.
[1:00:32] But God said we give more honor them.
[1:00:34] But the the Bible says we think these
[1:00:37] that are less honorable.
[1:00:40] The Bible will tell us that God gives
[1:00:42] them more abundant honor
[1:00:44] upon these. We bestow more abundant
[1:00:46] honor. We praise the preachers and the
[1:00:47] song leaders and the deacons and we we
[1:00:50] just give them ALL THIS. THANK GOD.
[1:00:52] THANK GOD. OH, we honor them so much. We
[1:00:55] got to be careful not to do too much
[1:00:56] honoring. Now, I know the Bible says
[1:00:58] double honor to the pastor and everybody
[1:00:59] does. Everybody honors me. No one
[1:01:01] disrespects me. If people disrespect me,
[1:01:03] they're not going to come back to the
[1:01:04] church because they're breaking the word
[1:01:05] of God. I'm going to kick them out of
[1:01:07] the church, right? Just like you. You
[1:01:08] wouldn't let somebody come into your
[1:01:10] house and disrespect your dad.
[1:01:12] No, you say, "That's my dad. He owns
[1:01:16] this place. You're not going to LET HIM
[1:01:17] DISRESPECT. GET OUT of here."
[1:01:20] Right? Same thing.
[1:01:22] How can a man rule the house of God if
[1:01:24] he doesn't rule his own house? Well,
[1:01:27] right?
[1:01:29] And the Bible said our uncommonly parts
[1:01:31] have more abundant calmliness.
[1:01:36] So they're the ones that we think aren't
[1:01:38] as important are very important are very
[1:01:41] beautiful. Praise God. How beautiful are
[1:01:44] the feet.
[1:01:47] Doesn't say how beautiful is that nose.
[1:01:49] And brother Jesse, I know you got a big
[1:01:50] one.
[1:01:53] See, NO BELIEVER WILL SAY I don't need
[1:01:55] you. We should never say that. We need
[1:01:57] everybody. We miss you when YOU DON'T
[1:01:59] COME TO CHURCH.
[1:02:02] &gt;&gt; Because sometimes we have so so few bank
[1:02:04] notes on Wednesday night. We have so few
[1:02:06] people. It's like we're walking in here
[1:02:07] on one foot just to get to church. Boy,
[1:02:10] it's hard to get to church. IT'S HARD TO
[1:02:12] GET THROUGH SERVICE TODAY because we
[1:02:13] only had a few people here. Now, if
[1:02:15] everybody's sick, we understand that. If
[1:02:16] you're working, we understand that, too.
[1:02:18] I'm just saying it affects the body,
[1:02:20] right? So, today we got both feet. Every
[1:02:22] almost everybody's in church today. We
[1:02:24] feel really good walking in the house of
[1:02:25] God today.
[1:02:27] Hallelujah. So thankful you come today,
[1:02:29] saints.
[1:02:31] We can have the body of Christ here.
[1:02:34] Amen. We can fully operate. And I'll say
[1:02:36] like this. All the needs of the church
[1:02:38] can be met if everybody's here.
[1:02:44] So we need each other. The less
[1:02:46] appreciated ones are necessary and will
[1:02:49] get more honor. A couple years ago,
[1:02:50] Malachi and uh Austin and I were racing
[1:02:53] out there. I found out
[1:02:56] I found out as a 41 year old man how
[1:02:59] important my uncommonly parts are. Like
[1:03:01] you don't walk around saying, "Oh, look
[1:03:03] at my hamstrings, man. I really got
[1:03:04] great hamstrings." Like nobody honors
[1:03:06] the hamstrings unless you're a
[1:03:07] bodybuilder. Then you really got demon
[1:03:09] spirits. But like us, you don't walk
[1:03:12] around saying under your dress like,
[1:03:13] "Wow, thank God I got these beautiful
[1:03:15] hamstrings." My goodness, I'm so
[1:03:16] thankful. These are so calmly boy. Look
[1:03:19] how they stretch and look how we don't
[1:03:20] do that. But when I when I went out
[1:03:22] there, I'm like, I'm going to race
[1:03:23] Malachi. I'm going to race awesomeness.
[1:03:25] And all of a sudden, I felt a pop pop.
[1:03:27] Oh man. Then I realized how important my
[1:03:30] hamstrings really were. And I had to
[1:03:33] spend day after day stretching them out,
[1:03:35] icing them. Stretch, ice, stretch, ice
[1:03:38] to get them back to where they were. Now
[1:03:39] I really appreciated my uncommonly
[1:03:41] parts. And I realized that's more
[1:03:43] important than my nose or my hair or my
[1:03:46] Did I Did I trim my goatee? This was way
[1:03:49] more important than this.
[1:03:51] or this. This is super important. And so
[1:03:55] it is with the family of God.
[1:03:58] The ones we don't see all the time that
[1:04:00] get all the clapping. [applause]
[1:04:02] Amen. That's right, BRO. WHAT A
[1:04:04] REVELATION. That that's all the honor.
[1:04:07] The ones that don't get seen, that's the
[1:04:10] one who are super important
[1:04:14] because just let something happen and
[1:04:15] people start falling out of church or
[1:04:16] they get sick or something. Pretty soon
[1:04:18] you don't have nobody here.
[1:04:21] Where where is everybody? Where's the
[1:04:23] body of Christ? Where are those comely
[1:04:25] parts? Or if somebody's hurting uh that
[1:04:28] you lose somebody, oh, you see that
[1:04:29] person and they can't come to church or
[1:04:31] or they're just down, discouraged all
[1:04:32] the time. Think about that. They're
[1:04:33] sitting there in their chair. They're
[1:04:34] still coming to church, but their spirit
[1:04:36] is so wounded. It's like my wounded
[1:04:38] hamstring.
[1:04:39] Saw me limping up to church after that
[1:04:41] one. God bless everybody. Hallelujah.
[1:04:44] But you like feel for me like, "Oh, bro,
[1:04:46] brother, bro, bruh, bro." Whatever say,
[1:04:49] whatever they say. Like, I feel sorry
[1:04:52] for you, brother. And that's how we
[1:04:55] feel, right? I And then I can't go about
[1:04:57] my regular day because I can hardly walk
[1:04:59] and I got to sit a certain way in a
[1:05:00] chair. I got to keep it stretched. And
[1:05:02] that's we'll go through services where
[1:05:04] people ARE HURTING RIGHT HERE. AND IT'S
[1:05:05] JUST NOT THE SAME until it heals.
[1:05:09] So important. Every person here is so
[1:05:11] important that you feel healthy. Amen.
[1:05:13] Amen. Like we read that quote on
[1:05:15] Wednesday. Brother B said, "No Christian
[1:05:17] is as strong or as healthy as by their
[1:05:20] adherence to obeying every word of God.
[1:05:23] We need everybody to obey the word of
[1:05:25] God. Then we'll be a healthy church.
[1:05:30] For our comedy parts have no need."
[1:05:33] Right? I don't got to take too much care
[1:05:34] of this. Ears do a pretty good job.
[1:05:36] Eyes. When was the last time you had to
[1:05:39] uh straighten out your eyes a little
[1:05:40] bit? Get your ears in order. No, they're
[1:05:42] just It's working good, right? Got to
[1:05:45] clean them out. Got to scrub them down a
[1:05:47] little bit. Get them. No, but you got to
[1:05:48] scrub the feet down. I'm a witness of
[1:05:50] that. I know what that's like.
[1:05:53] See, our coming parts have no need. But
[1:05:55] God has tempered the body together,
[1:05:57] having having given listen more abundant
[1:06:00] honor to the part which
[1:06:03] So God honors the body, the whole body,
[1:06:06] not just one part.
[1:06:09] Brother Ram said there's going to be a
[1:06:10] lot of surprises in heaven, church.
[1:06:12] He said, "Women get a greater reward."
[1:06:14] Now, I don't can't explain it. I don't
[1:06:15] have a scripture, but that matches this.
[1:06:19] We're going to be surprised. And
[1:06:21] remember, the Bible said preachers
[1:06:22] offended many things all.
[1:06:25] So, they a lot of preachers will have a
[1:06:27] lot of offenses. But the faithful ones,
[1:06:29] remember the apostles, they'll have a
[1:06:31] hundfold reward because they left
[1:06:33] father, mother, family. So, you have
[1:06:35] that balance. The preachers that are
[1:06:36] faithful, they'll get a huge reward. But
[1:06:38] the Bible also says God honors those
[1:06:41] uncommonly parts with abundant honor.
[1:06:46] And church, if we don't see it on this
[1:06:47] side, where are we going to see it?
[1:06:48] We're going to see it on the next side.
[1:06:52] Praise God. So just be faithful to God.
[1:06:53] Just stay in your position. Just find
[1:06:55] out. Are you the eye? Are you the ear?
[1:06:58] Are you the tongue? Are you the feet?
[1:07:01] Are you the nose?
[1:07:03] Find out what you are. Ask God about it.
[1:07:06] Again, like I said a few months ago,
[1:07:08] when was the last time you asked God,
[1:07:09] "God, what gifts do I did you give me?"
[1:07:14] That that if you know your gifts, it'll
[1:07:16] make church a lot more wonderful,
[1:07:18] right? Then you you know you're being
[1:07:20] faithful. You're preparing to pray for
[1:07:22] the sick. You're preparing to sing.
[1:07:24] You're preparing to give a word of
[1:07:26] wisdom, a word of know. You're preparing
[1:07:27] for that. You're getting ready so God
[1:07:29] can use every part of the body.
[1:07:34] Every part
[1:07:37] every part you're ready because you know
[1:07:39] what God's called you to do. Then
[1:07:41] brother Ram says there's some surprise
[1:07:42] times where he just might use you one
[1:07:44] time for something. Those are extra
[1:07:46] blessings.
[1:07:48] He might use you to speak in tongue or
[1:07:49] give a prophecy or interpretation or a
[1:07:51] dream and then never use you that way
[1:07:53] the rest of your life. But thank God
[1:07:55] you're a part of the body of Christ.
[1:08:00] There should be no schism in the body,
[1:08:02] but that the member should have the same
[1:08:04] care one for another. Hallelujah. That's
[1:08:07] what I try to do as a pastor. If I know
[1:08:09] somebody's got a financial need, I try
[1:08:10] to meet help them the same way. I help
[1:08:12] somebody else. Somebody needs a Bible
[1:08:14] study, let me know. I try to do it
[1:08:15] online or whatever I can do, you know,
[1:08:17] I'll try to do the same way. Just let me
[1:08:19] try to be fair with everybody. Treat
[1:08:20] everybody the same. Love everybody the
[1:08:22] same.
[1:08:24] And whether one member suffer, all the
[1:08:26] members suffer with it. when someone's
[1:08:27] struggling like we all struggle in our
[1:08:28] hearts like right we're missing somebody
[1:08:30] ah we miss them for a couple weeks and
[1:08:31] my I haven't seen them for a month and
[1:08:33] oh my it just it makes all of us suffer
[1:08:37] or if one member is honored now here's
[1:08:39] where some people have a trouble all the
[1:08:41] members rejoice with it
[1:08:44] so we have to remember to be happy for
[1:08:46] other people when they get testimonies
[1:08:47] as well be thankful say thank you Jesus
[1:08:50] you did that for brother Claude how you
[1:08:52] poured out that blessing for brother
[1:08:53] Patrick hallelujah
[1:08:55] amen And
[1:08:57] don't be jealous. Don't feel bad about
[1:08:59] it. Be thankful for it.
[1:09:02] So the emphasis is providing saints the
[1:09:04] same love and care for one another. We
[1:09:06] should feel each other's pain and be
[1:09:08] there to help each other.
[1:09:10] And that's what I've seen in our church.
[1:09:12] You know, we've had it many times, you
[1:09:13] know, where people help other people.
[1:09:15] Maybe they bring meals over or they
[1:09:17] offer to help out or come over and help
[1:09:19] out with the house or something like
[1:09:20] that. So wonderful that people can do
[1:09:22] that by the grace of God.
[1:09:25] Now ye are the body of Christ and you
[1:09:27] are members in particular. So you have a
[1:09:29] a particular function in the body of
[1:09:31] Christ. Might be this nose, hearing,
[1:09:35] eyes,
[1:09:37] feet, the hands. You have something in
[1:09:40] particular God wants you to do.
[1:09:45] And God hath set some in the church
[1:09:47] first apostles. So now Paul of course
[1:09:49] reminds us of the order of the
[1:09:50] responsibility.
[1:09:52] Apostles are first, secondarily
[1:09:54] prophets.
[1:09:56] Thirdly, teachers. After that, miracles,
[1:09:58] then gifts of healing, helps,
[1:10:00] governments, diversities of tongues.
[1:10:02] Now, just so you know, these Greek words
[1:10:04] are only used one time in the whole New
[1:10:06] Testament right there. That's it. So,
[1:10:08] we're that's why we don't make a special
[1:10:09] office of helps or governments. They're
[1:10:11] just used one time. So, we won't even
[1:10:13] have two or three witnesses. Alls we can
[1:10:14] do is kind of base it off off our off
[1:10:17] our best thoughts of other scriptures.
[1:10:19] So to me helps might helps in
[1:10:21] governments might be well some people
[1:10:22] say government because the pastor some
[1:10:24] people say the the pastor is the
[1:10:25] government or the deacons uh helps might
[1:10:28] be uh well in this case I don't know
[1:10:31] what that would be I have to look at my
[1:10:33] notes something after healings
[1:10:36] I can't remember what it was for helps
[1:10:38] what I thought it was but
[1:10:41] [clears throat] notice God sets it the
[1:10:42] most important thing is a missionary
[1:10:44] church
[1:10:45] and so we haven't had missionaries in a
[1:10:47] while because co shut a lot of them
[1:10:49] Now, we've got that we got that strange
[1:10:51] thing happening where lesser and lesser
[1:10:52] people are being saved, right? We're
[1:10:54] coming up to the pyramid. Lesser and
[1:10:55] lesser people are being saved. Then we
[1:10:56] got less and less people going out as
[1:10:58] missionaries, but we still need some
[1:11:00] missionaries,
[1:11:02] right? We still need some. Now, most
[1:11:04] people don't want to go. Well, that's
[1:11:05] okay if you're not called to it. But if
[1:11:06] you're running from it, you better obey
[1:11:08] it.
[1:11:09] And remember, here's what I did. I said,
[1:11:11] "Lord, I asked God, show me if I'm a
[1:11:13] pastor or not." Remember in 2014 I said,
[1:11:15] "Lord, let someone come in this message
[1:11:17] through me and that will tell me to keep
[1:11:19] being a pastor." I put my whole ministry
[1:11:21] on the line. By that time in 2014, I'd
[1:11:24] only been a pastor for eight years
[1:11:25] because we started our church in 2006. I
[1:11:27] put everything on the line, Sister
[1:11:28] Beatatric. I said, "If we don't get a
[1:11:30] new message believer by December of
[1:11:32] 2014, we're closing the church." I told
[1:11:34] Brother John, I don't know if I told
[1:11:35] Brother Vang, but I told Brother John, I
[1:11:37] told my wife.
[1:11:39] And then God brought in Amen and Hua
[1:11:41] before that, right? So I knew I knew I
[1:11:44] put everything on the line. I was ready
[1:11:46] to I was going to I told brother brother
[1:11:47] Samuel had asked me said brother you
[1:11:49] could come up and be my Timothy. I'll be
[1:11:50] the Paul. Paul and Timothy because I had
[1:11:52] such a good friendship with brother
[1:11:53] Samuel. That was sounded pretty good.
[1:11:57] He's a good man of God. Hallelujah. But
[1:12:00] I put it on the line right there. Lord,
[1:12:01] you do it and that will prove to me that
[1:12:04] you want me to be a pastor. And God did.
[1:12:07] And I had no I hadn't met brother Amen
[1:12:09] or sister Hua. I had not met nothing. It
[1:12:11] was all God. And that was in the summer
[1:12:12] of 2014. So within six months or five
[1:12:15] months, God answered that prayer. So
[1:12:17] what am I saying? If you don't know what
[1:12:18] you're called to do, put it on the line.
[1:12:21] &gt;&gt; Get get desperate with God. Get sincere
[1:12:24] with God, right?
[1:12:27] Fast. Pray longer. Do something. Put a a
[1:12:30] a fleece before God. Seek God with all
[1:12:33] your heart. You need to know what God
[1:12:35] called you to be in the body of Christ.
[1:12:38] Church, why should people sit here week
[1:12:40] after week or month after month year
[1:12:41] after year and not know the gifts in
[1:12:42] your life? You should know the gifts in
[1:12:44] your life or should be on the way to
[1:12:46] finding them out.
[1:12:50] Hallelujah.
[1:12:55] Just because you're not the kind that
[1:12:56] gets all the public honor, which I I
[1:12:58] didn't ask for this church. I didn't ask
[1:12:59] to be a pastor. I never grew up saying,
[1:13:00] "Christen, I want to be a pastor when we
[1:13:02] get older." I didn't ask to be a pastor.
[1:13:06] I don't like all that comes with it, but
[1:13:08] I love the joy of knowing the word of
[1:13:09] God.
[1:13:12] You don't ask for it. You just let God
[1:13:14] I'm sorry. You don't ask for certain
[1:13:15] things. You let God take you into what
[1:13:16] you're called to be.
[1:13:18] Hallelujah.
[1:13:21] God loves variety.
[1:13:23] He wants to set you and place you where
[1:13:25] he wants you to be, where it pleases
[1:13:27] him.
[1:13:29] We're not all the same. Find your
[1:13:31] position. Stay there. Be who God made
[1:13:32] you to be. And I love these questions.
[1:13:35] Are all apostles? Do all get to travel
[1:13:36] overseas? No. Are all prophets? No.
[1:13:39] Sometimes we wish we were, don't we? My
[1:13:41] goodness. I wish I was a prophet. I
[1:13:43] could tell brother Vang this happened,
[1:13:44] that happened. I could tell brother
[1:13:45] Patrick, well, this happened because
[1:13:47] this, this, and that, Claude and
[1:13:48] Patrick, I saw it when you were 10 years
[1:13:51] old.
[1:13:53] That'd be pretty awesome.
[1:13:56] But that's not what God wants me to do.
[1:13:58] It'd be wonderful. But I can't try to
[1:14:00] impersonate that either. Are all
[1:14:03] teachers. Now, people have told me I'm a
[1:14:04] teacher. because I can instruct with the
[1:14:06] word of God rightly divide it. I believe
[1:14:08] that. But not everybody's like that.
[1:14:12] Are all workers of miracles? No.
[1:14:16] Right.
[1:14:18] God placed you in a particular place.
[1:14:22] Now, I'm just throwing this in for those
[1:14:23] who love to study the Bible because I'm
[1:14:25] a teacher
[1:14:26] in the natural and the spiritual.
[1:14:30] Paul gives us the order here. But
[1:14:32] remember, we also have order. So I just
[1:14:34] want you to see how it lines up. Now I
[1:14:36] don't for whatever reason Paul didn't
[1:14:37] list evangelists and pastors in here. So
[1:14:40] maybe he met evangelist and pastors down
[1:14:41] there or maybe he was just you know no
[1:14:44] doubt he was following the leadership of
[1:14:46] the Holy Ghost. But I just can't explain
[1:14:47] it. But you can see there is continuity
[1:14:49] in the order. Apostles of the highest
[1:14:53] followed by prophets right followed by
[1:14:56] teachers.
[1:14:59] Now this is why you know we we stand by
[1:15:02] this right evangelists are very
[1:15:03] important travel from church to church
[1:15:05] pastors teachers they're all important
[1:15:08] right but look how high highly Paul puts
[1:15:11] teachers up here so the five-fold
[1:15:12] ministry is super important
[1:15:15] to know the word of God to understand it
[1:15:17] to make new converts to tell future
[1:15:20] events by God's grace now I'm going to
[1:15:22] close I got just a couple more slides
[1:15:24] here so just bear with me I'm almost
[1:15:25] done everybody's been doing pretty good
[1:15:27] today I haven't seen too much sleeping
[1:15:28] today by God's grace No, I'm just
[1:15:29] kidding. I don't see many sleepers too
[1:15:31] often. We ridicule Judas. We say he's a
[1:15:34] filthy bad guy. He's not fit for no
[1:15:36] place or no society. He isn't fit for
[1:15:38] heaven. Why? He sold his Lord after he
[1:15:40] had the opportunity to even be a
[1:15:42] disciple to be an apostle. The highest
[1:15:44] calling in the Bible. Think of that.
[1:15:46] Judas turned down the highest calling in
[1:15:48] the Bible for money.
[1:15:51] He wouldn't go out and preach. He
[1:15:52] wouldn't go to Pentecost because he
[1:15:54] wanted money.
[1:15:56] Same thing happens today. They won't
[1:15:57] come to me church because they want they
[1:15:59] want more money. They want a bigger
[1:16:01] church. They want more popularity. Or
[1:16:03] they won't come to more services in the
[1:16:05] message church because they want more
[1:16:06] money, right? So they miss church.
[1:16:10] He says, "Higher than a prophet." I
[1:16:13] shared this with the tape boys. Guess
[1:16:14] what they said? They change the subject.
[1:16:16] Call me a Judas. They call me a Judas
[1:16:18] because I showed them a quote. Or they
[1:16:20] call me Janice Jambers.
[1:16:22] Really? Janice Jammers quoted the word
[1:16:25] and stayed with the word.
[1:16:27] I didn't know that. [snorts] It's
[1:16:29] because it's not true.
[1:16:32] He had the opportunity to be an apostle
[1:16:34] and sold that right for personal gain.
[1:16:36] That's what I found. When you got an
[1:16:37] evil spirit, it won't answer questions
[1:16:39] honestly. It will deflect and say, "Next
[1:16:41] question. I don't want that question.
[1:16:43] I'm going to name call you. I'm going to
[1:16:44] attack you. I'm going to call you a
[1:16:46] devil." But yet, you're the one pointing
[1:16:48] to the word of God, and I'm pointing
[1:16:49] away from the word of God. They're
[1:16:51] blind. church blind blind leaders of the
[1:16:53] blind.
[1:16:55] Remember, he sold out Jesus for personal
[1:16:57] gain. So, see church, as a as a part of
[1:16:59] the body of Christ, you're not here for
[1:17:00] personal gain. You're here for the gain
[1:17:02] of others. And if others gain, then you
[1:17:05] gain in heaven. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:17:07] If you if others gain on earth through
[1:17:09] you, then you'll gain a great reward in
[1:17:11] heaven.
[1:17:15] Now, brother said, "It makes me proud in
[1:17:16] my heart and grateful to find servants
[1:17:18] of God that'll stand before the people
[1:17:20] and say, "I'm a witness of this gospel,
[1:17:22] too." Aren't you proud of your pastors?
[1:17:24] Say, "Praise the Lord." If you're proud
[1:17:25] of the pastors
[1:17:28] &gt;&gt; Thank you. Thank you, Lord. Thank you.
[1:17:30] Well, just like the Bible says, they get
[1:17:31] more recognition than everybody. Right.
[1:17:33] Right. Pastors, Brother Ram's lining
[1:17:35] them up. They're going to do a double
[1:17:36] line. They're going to do a prayer, a
[1:17:37] prayer tunnel. You've seen the preachers
[1:17:40] will stand there and everybody that
[1:17:41] wants prayer, come through, and pray for
[1:17:42] them. Brother Ram's lining him up. He
[1:17:44] says, and before they pray, he said,
[1:17:45] "Aren't you proud of these pastors? They
[1:17:47] they believe in divine healing."
[1:17:49] But I want you to watch what he says,
[1:17:51] church. It makes me proud of my heart
[1:17:53] and grateful. He says, "We're proud of
[1:17:56] our brethren." Amen. We're proud of
[1:17:57] them. They're your pastor. A pastor
[1:18:00] means a shepherd. Each of these men has
[1:18:02] just as much of the anointing to lay
[1:18:03] hands on the sick as I do. And I'm
[1:18:05] thankful for those who I've laid my
[1:18:06] hands on and they've recovered. I'm
[1:18:07] thankful. It wasn't me. It was God's
[1:18:09] promise.
[1:18:12] Now, I'm not a preacher. What, brother?
[1:18:14] What? That's thus sayith the Lord.
[1:18:16] That's what the tape church says. Well,
[1:18:18] if he's not a preacher, what is he?
[1:18:20] They're preachers. They've got a higher
[1:18:22] office than I have. Wait, what?
[1:18:25] What?
[1:18:27] If this is thus sayith the Lord, then
[1:18:29] these tape worshippers really need to
[1:18:30] repent.
[1:18:32] Brother Ram says, "These pastors in the
[1:18:34] prayer tunnel have a higher office than
[1:18:36] I have." Oh, Brother Jesse, I'm
[1:18:38] squirming in my seat. What are you gonna
[1:18:39] say next?
[1:18:41] going to start some new doctrine. No,
[1:18:42] I'm not. I'm gonna take you back to the
[1:18:44] original like I always do.
[1:18:47] Hallelujah. This is true what he's
[1:18:49] saying. He's talking about the local
[1:18:52] church.
[1:18:53] Now, can everybody take a big sigh of
[1:18:54] relief? I thought Brother Jesse was
[1:18:56] going to vault exalt pastors above the
[1:18:58] prophet. No, I'm not. I'm going to say
[1:19:00] what the tapes say when they say what
[1:19:02] the Bible says.
[1:19:05] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God.
[1:19:08] &gt;&gt; Y'all get nervous. What's he going to
[1:19:09] say next? Uh, I've studied. I know what
[1:19:12] I'm talking about. Hallelujah. But man
[1:19:15] said, THEY'VE GOT A HIGHER OFFICE THAN I
[1:19:17] have. A pastor is higher than a prophet.
[1:19:19] Only in the local church.
[1:19:22] And I'm going to show you that with
[1:19:23] another quote. He said, "Mine's a
[1:19:25] prophetic office, and it's to prophesy."
[1:19:27] Now, they're they wasn't built for that.
[1:19:29] See, we're not We have to recognize what
[1:19:31] am I built for? Consecration,
[1:19:34] dedication, sacrifice, fasting, giving
[1:19:36] uh people things like the nose. What am
[1:19:38] I built for?
[1:19:40] Mali, you look like a nice nose there.
[1:19:42] You look like a nice boy. You're You
[1:19:44] look like a nice ears there. I'm talking
[1:19:46] spiritually. [laughter]
[1:19:50] He's the hands. See the hands? He's the
[1:19:53] hands.
[1:19:57] [snorts] What does the Bible say,
[1:19:58] Brother Brandham? God said, what does he
[1:20:01] he quotes? Ephesians 4:11. And the
[1:20:03] church said,
[1:20:06] he says, "Is that right? Look, I have no
[1:20:08] education. That's the reason I say I'm
[1:20:09] not a preacher. These men, listen, could
[1:20:11] take this word and they wouldn't have to
[1:20:14] use one of these gifts like prophesying.
[1:20:16] They could just lay the word out there
[1:20:18] and they'd so tied the Satan and such
[1:20:19] and not he couldn't get out of that.
[1:20:21] See, but I can't do that. That's not my
[1:20:23] calling.
[1:20:27] They they are called for that. They're
[1:20:29] men of God. Every man that's called of
[1:20:30] God is commissioned to lay hands on the
[1:20:32] sick and they shall recover. How many
[1:20:33] believers or how many believes that?
[1:20:35] Then how you going to fail from getting
[1:20:37] well past through an arc like this? The
[1:20:39] ark of the prayer line,
[1:20:42] right? The prayer tunnel they call it.
[1:20:44] Church, maybe we should have one of that
[1:20:45] when brother uh Brad comes or brother
[1:20:47] Cam.
[1:20:49] Now we have such a small group, we don't
[1:20:50] even have we hardly have any preachers.
[1:20:52] Our tunnel would be Cam and me. That's
[1:20:54] quite an arc, isn't it? I guess it's
[1:20:57] kind of like the two cherubams by the
[1:20:58] Ark of the Covenant.
[1:21:00] [laughter] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:21:03] Now, here's the quote that balances out.
[1:21:05] Brother Brandham, how could pastors be
[1:21:07] higher than you? Only in the local
[1:21:08] church.
[1:21:10] Brother Brandham said, "The full and
[1:21:11] complete authority of the church is the
[1:21:14] read that in the Bible. See if that's
[1:21:15] not the Bible order." That's exactly
[1:21:17] right. There's no one above the elder.
[1:21:20] Right. I have nothing to do with what
[1:21:21] brother Neville does here. That's up to
[1:21:23] you and brother Neville. He could preach
[1:21:24] Jehovah's Witness doctrine. That's up
[1:21:26] between you and him.
[1:21:28] See, because it's the congregation who
[1:21:30] votes on the pastor. Now, does everybody
[1:21:32] understand that? But boy, if you're a
[1:21:34] tape worshipper, you got a lot of
[1:21:36] explaining to do with this one. Wow.
[1:21:38] Pastors from 1961 in Long Beach,
[1:21:40] California, had a higher calling than
[1:21:42] Brother Brandham or higher office. Well,
[1:21:45] you got a lot of explaining to do on
[1:21:46] that one. But what do they say? I just
[1:21:48] believe every word is thus sayith the
[1:21:49] Lord. Like these insane people, they got
[1:21:51] a demonic spirit on them. It's a deity
[1:21:53] spirit. That's exactly right. Worshiping
[1:21:56] those tapes.
[1:21:58] They have a seducing spirit. Doctrines
[1:22:00] of devils. They're filled with devils.
[1:22:02] That's right. Because they take the
[1:22:04] tapes above this church. This is the
[1:22:06] absolute.
[1:22:07] &gt;&gt; This is thus sayith the Lord. Every word
[1:22:09] is thus sayith the Lord. I showed you on
[1:22:10] Wednesday. Every word. Brother said I
[1:22:12] can hang my soul on any word of God in
[1:22:15] here. Hallelujah. I'm almost done.
[1:22:17] You've been very patient with me. Thank
[1:22:19] you.
[1:22:21] But now, now what about this one,
[1:22:22] Brother Jesse?
[1:22:24] No more. There's no more higher order to
[1:22:26] reveal the word than prophets. Did you
[1:22:29] catch that?
[1:22:31] Oh. Oh, THIS IS SOMETHING TOTALLY
[1:22:32] DIFFERENT. NOW WE'RE TALKING ABOUT
[1:22:34] revealing the word, not teach the word
[1:22:37] or preach the word. We're talking about
[1:22:39] revelation. What's the highest gift to
[1:22:41] reveal the word? Oh, the word of God
[1:22:42] comes to the prophet. Thank you. Thank
[1:22:45] you. Yes, that's true. Nobody reveals
[1:22:48] the word like a prophet does. But when
[1:22:52] it comes to who's the what's the
[1:22:53] greatest gift? The greatest gift is the
[1:22:55] apostle. But the highest uh office for
[1:22:57] getting revelation is the prophet. The
[1:22:59] highest gift in the local church is the
[1:23:02] pastor. Oh, so they all fit together
[1:23:04] nicely, don't they? Hallelujah. If we
[1:23:06] actually believe the Bible. And I'm glad
[1:23:08] we have a body that believes the Bible
[1:23:10] here.
[1:23:13] The only way the prophet can be
[1:23:15] vindicated is by this right here. This
[1:23:17] is how I know brother was a prophet
[1:23:19] right here. You don't got to give me
[1:23:21] any. I mean, I believe the tapes, most
[1:23:22] of them, right? Most of the most of most
[1:23:25] everything on the tape is right. But
[1:23:26] he's got human mistakes on there. But
[1:23:28] this is why I believe brother Ram's a
[1:23:29] prophet because he acted just like a
[1:23:31] Bible prophet. He gave us thus sayith
[1:23:33] the Lord, brother Jose, we wandered
[1:23:36] around for years in domination. Jose
[1:23:38] going from this bumping in this being
[1:23:39] being blown over to this blown over to
[1:23:41] that and all of a sudden we heard thus
[1:23:43] sayith the Lord. Now we're walking on
[1:23:44] the straight and narrow. Brother Vang,
[1:23:45] now we know. Now we got our sword drawn.
[1:23:47] Now we know how to fight this battle.
[1:23:50] &gt;&gt; We know where we come from, church. We
[1:23:52] know where we're going.
[1:23:54] &gt;&gt; We're going back to Christ where I come
[1:23:57] from. you come from. Let's finish. Last
[1:23:59] slide. Let's send our feet. Musicians
[1:24:01] can come. Last scripture. Well, praise
[1:24:03] the Lord. I got through the chapter 12.
[1:24:05] Amen. I didn't know if it was possible,
[1:24:07] Brother Patrick, but I got through it.
[1:24:10] Do all have the gifts of healing? Can
[1:24:11] everybody lay hands on their sick and
[1:24:13] recover? Not everybody. No, not
[1:24:15] everybody. It's got to be your calling.
[1:24:18] Do all speak with tongues? Well, I wish
[1:24:20] Pentecostals would read this one. Don't
[1:24:21] you? Goodness gracious.
[1:24:26] Now, for anyone with an honest heart,
[1:24:28] this this solves the whole tongues
[1:24:29] thing. Just this one verse. This solved
[1:24:32] all my questions.
[1:24:34] Paul Paul was given the gospel by Jesus
[1:24:37] Christ. And he said, "Do all speak with
[1:24:39] tongues?" Yet, he said, "I speak with
[1:24:41] tongues more than y'all, but I'd rather
[1:24:43] speak five words with understanding than
[1:24:44] 10,000 in an unknown tongue." This
[1:24:47] solved it for me. So anybody with an
[1:24:49] honest heart who's not deceived will
[1:24:51] recognize not everybody speak with
[1:24:53] tongues just like not everybody has the
[1:24:55] gift of healing.
[1:24:57] Do all interpret? Can everybody can
[1:24:59] everybody hear an unknown tongue and
[1:25:01] tell you thus sayith the Lord. This is
[1:25:02] going to happen tomorrow at 12:00. So be
[1:25:04] cautious, be aware and make provision.
[1:25:06] Thus sayith the Lord. No. No. Not
[1:25:07] everybody can understand that.
[1:25:12] So I hope that's helpful by God's grace.
[1:25:14] But covet earnestly the best gift. So
[1:25:16] see church, we have to covet apostles,
[1:25:20] prophets. We have to pray for more of
[1:25:22] those God to send us more of those
[1:25:25] and send out apostles.
[1:25:27] And the greater gifts of the spirit.
[1:25:28] Brother said the greatest gift is what?
[1:25:30] Wisdom.
[1:25:32] Wisdom is the greatest gift because that
[1:25:35] judges he says all the rest of the
[1:25:37] gifts.
[1:25:40] But what is the greatest gift, church?
[1:25:43] Can you say it out loud? What's the
[1:25:44] greatest gift?
[1:25:46] Love. Love is the greatest gift. You can
[1:25:49] have all these gifts. You can understand
[1:25:50] all mysteries. You can move mountains by
[1:25:52] speaking the word, prophesying,
[1:25:55] word of faith. Move all these mountains.
[1:25:57] But if you don't have love, hasn't
[1:25:59] profited you anything. That's why we got
[1:26:01] to constantly love everybody in the
[1:26:03] church by God's grace. If they're
[1:26:05] struggling, if they need something, help
[1:26:07] them out. Show them you care.
[1:26:10] Hallelujah.
[1:26:14] God's word is true. It's been a joy to
[1:26:17] preach to you this morning. Hallelujah.
[1:26:19] It's been a joy. Thank you for being the
[1:26:21] foundation, church. We couldn't have
[1:26:23] church without you.
[1:26:26] And who does God put more honor on? He
[1:26:28] puts it on you. Amen. Let's bow our
[1:26:30] heads for a word of prayer. Father God,
[1:26:33] we thank you for today, Lord Jesus.
[1:26:36] Lord, men give honor to the most visible
[1:26:38] parts and the preachers and musicians,
[1:26:41] deacons maybe. But Lord, you put more
[1:26:44] honor on the uncommonly parts, Lord.
[1:26:46] Thank you for a church that loves you,
[1:26:47] Lord. They keep coming back to hear the
[1:26:49] word of God.
[1:26:51] I believe they're praying for me. I
[1:26:52] believe they're praying for the church
[1:26:53] here. I believe they're praying for lost
[1:26:55] loved ones. I believe they're praying
[1:26:57] for the sick that they'll recover.
[1:26:59] Bless your people, Lord God. If they
[1:27:02] don't see as many rewards on this side,
[1:27:03] surely they'll see them on the other
[1:27:04] side. You promised it in this chapter,
[1:27:09] you will honor them.
[1:27:12] So bless your people, Lord. I pray
[1:27:13] you'll honor them. They'll see some of
[1:27:15] that honor on this side.
[1:27:20] And I pray for myself and the preachers,
[1:27:22] God. You'd help us not to offend so
[1:27:23] much. God, help us to be careful what we
[1:27:25] say.
[1:27:28] Lord, I did not ask to be a pastor. Lord
[1:27:29] God, you know my heart, Lord Jesus. I
[1:27:32] It's not on my radar,
[1:27:35] but I felt a pull as we sing that song.
[1:27:38] I feel the pull. I felt a pull to the
[1:27:40] the pulpit. You vindicated it. You
[1:27:42] vindicated over and over. I almost gave
[1:27:44] up pastoring.
[1:27:46] But Lord, you placed me here, I believe,
[1:27:49] to feed your sheep. And you told Peter,
[1:27:51] "If you love me, feed my sheep." So
[1:27:53] Lord, I love you. I tried to feed your
[1:27:55] sheep today on the word of God. I trust
[1:27:56] they'll eat
[1:27:58] the word food that was [music] delivered
[1:28:00] to them today. I pray for your people,
[1:28:02] Lord. Help them to find what part they
[1:28:04] are. Whether it's the feet,
[1:28:07] Lord, the hands, the eyes, the nose, the
[1:28:10] ears, Lord God, especially our young
[1:28:13] people, Lord, they haven't been serving
[1:28:14] God very long. Help them, God, to seek
[1:28:16] you and show them their position in the
[1:28:18] body of Christ. [music] May they just
[1:28:19] wait on you until they know for sure
[1:28:22] what you've called them to be.
[1:28:25] I believe you gave me this message last
[1:28:27] night and this morning, Lord. So, I've
[1:28:28] just tried to be obedient to preach your
[1:28:30] word under the anointing of the Holy
[1:28:31] Spirit. Lord God, forgive me if I say
[1:28:33] anything wrong.
[1:28:36] May your people receive the [music]
[1:28:37] word, be edified, strengthened today.
[1:28:41] Let us be a membered body.
[1:28:45] Find our particular members that we're
[1:28:48] to be of the one body of Jesus Christ.
[1:28:51] [music]
[1:28:51] That's all I want, Lord. I just want to
[1:28:53] be in your body, Lord. May every person,
[1:28:55] Lord, here find their way into the body
[1:28:57] of Christ, Lord. I pray, God. Grant it,
[1:28:59] Jesus. Help them, Lord God. Help me,
[1:29:02] Lord God. Each person just to know for
[1:29:05] sure that they're in the body of Christ.
[1:29:08] Grant it, Lord Jesus. We love you, Lord
[1:29:10] God. Guide us into all truth. Teach us
[1:29:14] all things.
[1:29:16] Let us have the fruit of the Holy
[1:29:18] Spirit. Sigh and cry for the
[1:29:19] abominations. hunger and thirst for more
[1:29:21] righteousness, [music]
[1:29:22] have the love of God ruling our hearts,
[1:29:24] which is the greatest gift.
[1:29:28] Bless us now, Lord. If there's needs in
[1:29:29] the church, I pray you minister to them.
[1:29:32] Help each person, [music] including
[1:29:33] myself, to be sensitive to the needs in
[1:29:35] the church. I ask it in Jesus Christ's
[1:29:37] name. The same.
