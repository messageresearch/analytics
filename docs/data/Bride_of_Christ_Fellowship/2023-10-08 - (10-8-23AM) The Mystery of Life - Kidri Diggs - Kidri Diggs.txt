let's turn to um Jeremiah chapter 32 Jeremiah chapter 32 praise the Lord Jeremiah 32 and we're going to read um uh verse 14 Jeremiah 32 and 14 well let's let's back up let's back up amen um let's go to verse 10 Jeremiah 32 and10 the Bible says if you have it say Amen the Bible says and I subscribed the evidence and sealed it and took witness and weighed him the money of weighed the money in the balances so I took the evidence of the purchase both that was sealed according to the law and customs and that which was open and I gave the evidence of the purchase unto bur the son of Neah the son of mayil in the sight of Hanam my uncle son and in the presence of the witness that subscrib the book of the purchase before the Jews that sat in the court of the prison and I charged Birch unto them saying thus sayeth the Lord of hosts the god of Israel take these evidences that this evidence of the purchase both which is sealed and the evidence which is open put them in earn vessels that they may continue many days let's go to First John chapter 4 first John chapter 4 four and four the Bible says ye are of God little children and have overcome them because greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world Amen May a lord at a blessing the reading of his word you can have your seats amen by the grace of God today I want to use for a subject The Mystery of Life The Mystery of Life you know if if I would just take the word mystery mystery it it it it means unknown you know unrevealed you know um not to be understood you know so if we take that slogan The Mystery of Life that life can throw all kind of things at you and you know it seems like a mystery but when it comes to God is always purpose in it you know and for us as Christians the best thing for us to realize is that our lives are in the hand of God so everything that happens to us and for us there's a purpose of God behind it you know but when we think life and you know and the life we live and to to to for us our lives to a lot of people it's mysterious you know we we we we we dress a certain way we talk a certain way we we go certain places that you know the world uhh uh doesn't go and all these things you know we love coming to church on Sundays and and and other days of the week you know we spend time in our Bibles and we study a a message from a prophet who's been gone over 50 years so it it looks at our lives is a mystery but our life is hidden and revealed in the will of God and you know the thing about life you never understand life until it starts to be revealed Hallelujah you know you can and I love talking about a seed you can have a seed in your hand but you don't know what that seed is until Life starts to take place you know there's times when seeds can be planted side by side and they'll look the same until they start to grow Hallelujah you know and as they grow The Mystery of Life it starts to unveil itself and the Mystery of what it is it starts to come out right before the very eye Hallelujah you say brother digs what are you saying I'm saying Church even in the scriptures we've read that there was a purchase a purchase of life and there's an evidence of that life where is it the Bible says God says he put it in Earth and vessels Hallelujah he put the Mystery of Life in earn vessels but what kind of life not the life of this world but the life of eternal life Hallelujah God put the mystery of his will and the Mystery of life eternal life in you Hallelujah and you know Church we're not just regular people but we are the revealing of eternal life Hallelujah we are the revealing of God's attributes we are the revealing of perfect love we are the revealing of Hallelujah Divine faith everything that God's life would project on this Earth he put it in us he put it in you Hallelujah so think church I want you to think about that as you live life you're unveiling the mystery of God Hallelujah W that makes me feel pretty good Hallelujah to know that while I'm living down here and and the key element to our life is what the word because it's the word of God that's going to unlock who you are hallelujah hallelujah oh my praise God I hope you catch what I'm saying today I know there's a hook or something somewhere did I miss it oh okay praise God you know church we think about life you know that there is a baby stage you know I was in Africa about uh a week ago and you know I love going to the lion Park you know and when when you go to the park you know uh when I went last year uh you know uh Co was you know kind of fading out and everything and and and and they said they had most of the Lions close together and and and it was like a p of lions but this time when I came back they had the pride separated why because as the animals start to grow certain things about them begin to come out and as they come out the males we begin to seek for who's dominant Hallelujah and you know uh I like to say the the only the the clearest way to kill a lion is by another lion Hallelujah because their strengths are matched there the the techniques are match and they know how to kill they're born with that so the easiest way to kill a lion is with another lion so the people that run this park they know I have to separate these Lions because there's something in them to dominate life Hallelujah and you know God he puts us in certain places all over the world because your life is needed here in acine Hallelujah my life is needed in South Carolina Hallelujah but when we are all get together is projecting what one life the life of Christ amen and you in acarine is the mystery of Christ revealed and me in Carolina is the mystery of Christ revealed Hallelujah different places different cultures Hallelujah different seasons but all projecting the same thing Hallelujah you say oh my brother digs oh what are you saying see Church you look at the scripture and you look how God called his people he called them maybe at different times but when they met up they all were projecting and saying the same thing so it was all about the mystery of God being revealed in each and every person and you know Church to show that it's the same life when Paul and Peter met up they were saying the same thing why because it was the same mystery Hallelujah that's why the prophet of God could say I preach what Paul preached why because it was the same life [Applause] Hallelujah and church I want you to understand that your life is no different from Paul's life Hallelujah your life is no different from John the Baptist Hallelujah why because John came to project Christ the mystery of Christ revealed and if you miss John you miss Christ oh my I'm going to say something tonight I'm going to say something today if you miss this bread you miss Christ cuz what is she she is the wife of God the revealing of his character because when you see the wife of a man you see his Desir you see hallelujah what gets him excited it's that woman he chose Hallelujah and if you miss the bride of Christ Hallelujah you miss what God likes Hallelujah but you know when we think about life and the attributes of life and the reason why I read the scripture greater is he that is in us than he that is in the world Hallelujah and church when we think about uh uh the greatness of God and what's uh happening in the world right now Church let's understand the only reason why the world is in the condition is in so God can demonstrate his life amen hallelujah oh we thought oh my it's just sin and people are losing their mind and crazy and all these things no the only reason the world is in this condition is so that the attributes of God's life can be on display Hallelujah because what happened because God was all by himself and he was so great and there was so much of God to be revealed and unveiled things had to take place so God could get a spiritual release Hallelujah you know church if I can say it like this it's like if you eat eat eat eat eat and never use the bathroom you'll be sick so there has to become a time where you release all the substance that you've been taking that you've been taking in and no doubt you've been taking in things that your body needs you've been taking in things Hallelujah that'll give you strength and energy and all that but if it's stays in you too long it'll make you sick Hallelujah too much of it will make you sick Hallelujah so there has to be a time where your liver can release where your kidneys can release where your stomach can release Hallelujah where all the things about your body Hallelujah can get a release so what God does God allows things to happen within the world so why he can get a release Hallelujah so the things of who he is Hal huah that are on back Hallelujah back order you know what a back order a back order is that has already been called for it's already been purchased amen it's already been purchased but now hallelujah it's been so much in demand hallelujah it's been so much in demand that the product has run out so the product is now in back order but once they get it back in stock it flows and flows and flows to everybody that's order it Hallelujah and you know the presence and the spirit and everything about God has been on back order for 2,000 years and you are a part of the release you are a part Hallelujah of the order that the world's been looking for you are part of that love that the world's been looking for you are a part of that Faith the world's been looking for you are a part of that Deliverance that the world's been looking for you are God's back order Hallelujah but when we see life and the Mystery of Life Val was saying yesterday talking about the apple orchard and all these things that no doubt you take the seat of an apple and all of them look the same Hallelujah most of them look the same and I know nothing about this I'm just speaking by inspiration but but you know you can take the the seed of an apple and and give me a couple names you you gave me yesterday who Shuka what a strange name Suzuka apples hallelujah or you take Gaya Gaya apples you know and you put the Suzuka seed and the Gaya seed side by side and you can put it out there you can say hey these two are apples Hallelujah but the traits and the features that are in those seeds can't be shown until they're planted there are no good Hallelujah listen to me now there are no good in Malachi's hand Hallelujah there are no good in the in theak Suzuka what is it called in the Suzuka packet they no good in the Gaya packet Hallelujah the the features and the traits of that seed will never come out until they're planted in the right conditions Hallelujah until they planted in the right conditions that's the only way the mystery of the life can come out what are you saying brother DS the mystery of who you are would be no good in Luther's day oh Hallelujah the mystery of who you are will be no good in in Wesley's day the mystery of who you are will be no good under the Pentecostal move but there had to be something that could unveil all the features of your life Hallelujah there had to be a time and a season where everything about you would be revealed not in part but in whole Hallelujah because the day of Luther was a mystery of part W Hallelujah the day of Wesley was was a mystery of Life revealed in part and on and on it was revealed a mystery of life in part but then there came a time when the fullness of God was going to be revealed and we are in that day where the fullness of God has been revealed what caused the fullness of God to be revealed the preaching of the word hallelujah and what's being preached in our day is causing the mystery of who you really are to be unveiled Hallelujah you take uh H uh traits that come from the father Hallelujah and right now I'm going use you cuz you're up front hall and right now Hallelujah traits of your father are in you but it looks like Hallelujah you're excelling Hallelujah the traits of your father Hallelujah you might say well I'm Dad I'm a little bit bigger than you I'm I'm a little bit taller than you but let me remind you of something everything about you came from your father Hallelujah but the special thing about God hallelujah God allows us hallelujah to be unveiled Hallelujah go ahead although I can look at you and see Jesse I have to be able to see Malachi too hallah Hallelujah oh my church that's what we are you have your own identity in Christ Hallelujah yeah I'm identified with Christ and in Christ but I also have my own identity and my identity is to reflect who Christ is in me Hallelujah when you saw Peter when you saw Paul you saw Christ but you still saw Peter and Paul amen Hallelujah although we appreciate God sending a prophet my identity is not in William brandham my identity is in the Revelation The Mystery of the life being revealed the mystery of what's being preached to me will unveil who I [Applause] am and you know Jesse you I me see I call you the wrong name Malachi you can look so much like the father father people will look at you and say you're Jesse's boy but then you'll say no I'm Malachi I got a name hallelujah amen I got a purpose hallelujah amen that I was born Hallelujah into this family because God had a purpose for me and it's the same thing for you and I hallelujah we're not here just to be robots we're here to demonstrate the mystery of God's word Hallelujah and when the life is really being unveiled you will look at it and it's almost like Hallelujah I look at you and I see Jesse but you're really Malachi and just like they looked at John Hallelujah they looked at John and they saw Jesus but it was really John he was so much the life oh my the life was so much like Christ they thought he was Christ and that's where we are and that's where we've always been church when the real life of Christ is being manifested people look at the mystery and they say are you God they did the same thing through the prophets through the days Church you read your Bible one of the prophets that I love reading about you read about Samuel and when Samuel came into town everybody straightened up whatever foolishness they had going on they stopped it whatever kind of dances or parties or whatever they had they stopped it why because Samuel was there and they they knew that there was a power behind Samuel they knew that there was a life there Hallelujah that whatever he said was going to happen amen Hallelujah but who was it really in Samuel Hallelujah yeah they saw Samuel but it was really God and that's the way it should be today they may see you they may see me but they really should be saying that that's God in that life that's Christ in that life hallelujah oh my because what are we we are the mystery of Christ revealed that's why you can make a statement and say greater is he that is in me than he that is in the world but you plant that seed and I love saying this the mystery of that seed can only be revealed revealed is if you put that seed in dirt and we think as Christians we say oh not me I'm holy you know praise God I you know I got the Holy Ghost Hallelujah you would have never gotten it if you didn't have dirt in your life because dirt is the only thing that can convict you to bring you to the presence of God and without some kind of Filth in your life you'd never repent Hallelujah and if you would have never repent you never experience a higher way of living Hallelujah so it took your faults your failures your ups and your Downs all these things to what bring forth the mystery that's why the Bible comes the Bible comes and it gives us a shocking point it gives us something that the world can understand it says hallelujah a righteous man Fallen seven times now you put falling down and righteous together that don't sound right but God's Hallelujah definition of righteous is not the way the man looks at it he said a righteous man fth seven times what makes him righteous the mystery Hallelujah inside of him that won't give [Applause] up Hallelujah you say brother why you keep going to church because there's something inside of me that won't give [Applause] up brother why you keep praying cuz there's something inside of me that won't give up brother why you keep believing cuz there's something inside of me that won't give [Applause] up and as you stay under the word your tree grows and the more you take in Hallelujah the key is to take in in more than what you need and the reason why people don't push outs because they don't take in more than what they need again I said if I eat and eat and eat I have to have a release Hallelujah so when it comes to the fers of God you eat and eat and eat you got to push out eventually hallelujah hallelujah but church when we think about that life and dirt and sunlight and all these things hallelujah what is it is God fulfilling the mystery of his will Hallelujah and nobody knows the difference between Zulu seed and Gaya seed Hallelujah and I did that on purpose because you think about me calling it out of his name if that seed could speak he say no you didn't you didn't pronounce my name right what would that seed be saying I know who I am hallelujah hallelujah that seed will correct you and say I know who I am they say John are you the Christ John say no I'm the voice of one crying in the wilderness he knew who he was he knew the mystery of his life Hallelujah he knew the mystery of his life church and that's our job that's our calling to know how God wants to use [Applause] you I forget her name but the mother of the Wesley boys I think what's her name Susanna had what 12 kids something like 15 16 whatever it was what we would say today a ridiculous number of kids Hallelujah but that was the mystery of God's will being fulfilled in Savannah's life everybody else looking at Savannah said man you having another child but there was something in her Hallelujah that was made her settled with pushing our kids Hallelujah there was something in her that says no I'm not going to fight this I'm just going to release these lives H I'm just going to released this life in the world Hallelujah and as she released Hallelujah as she released Hallelujah she produced two children that would greatly Hallelujah affect the world by the mystery of their lives Charles and John Wesley hallelujah hallelujah those two men hallelujah what were they they were attributes of the life of their [Applause] mother see I I I say this I say this because I like to give her credit that uh yeah we know when we get on the other side we'll be standing with the prophet for our day we'll be standing with our age yeah and you know he says he says although all those Brands know he said these are your converts but I like to say before I get there I'm the convert here to my mother Hallelujah because it was her life Hallelujah that led me to to the mystery of Christ hallelujah what I seen and heard being revealed Hallelujah the meekness Hallelujah the Visions the prophecies and hallu the faith all these things all these attributes on this side about God what did it do it drew me closer to Christ Hallelujah and as I saw the mystery of her life being revealed it pulled me closer into who I was so the purpose of you being here in this church Hallelujah is so that who you are can come out you could be in any church Hallelujah but thus that church reveal you does that church Hallelujah uncover who you are hallelujah or are you just a church member and if you're just a church member Hallelujah you're no good to any of us because there's nothing about you we can apply Hallelujah but when you find your place in Christ Hallelujah and Christ begins to use you Hallelujah and life is being projected then we all can eat from your tree because that's the most important thing about the apple is not to get on the tree and look beautiful no that someone may feed from the tree Hallelujah and if I was to Sayers hallelujah amen y'all go there with the whole purpose of planting why for a harvest what's going on in akine y'all think Jesse just want to be here every Sunday and and come here and preach his Revelation and say man I'm powerful no it's about producing a harvest in a hallelujah it's about producing something a life that will draw more people to our tree to eat Hallelujah and God wants to use you Hallelujah to satisfy somebody's [Applause] hunger or to quench somebody else's thirst God wants to use you [Applause] Hallelujah to unveil that mystery and church I I I love talking about the mystery and the cycle of life you know there's a there's a cycle where everybody in here right now is in a cycle and I want I I'm GNA make it real simple for you Hallelujah you know the Bible speaks of H uh in the time where Joseph went from being in in in bondage well let's just say like this he went from a time of being in a happy home you know his life was good he knew his father loved him he was getting special treatment from there Hallelujah experiencing hatred and jealousy Hallelujah the pattern of life started to change and he didn't know what was going on but what was it it was the mystery of God's will being revealed see God has a strange way of getting us there and sometimes we don't understand it but it's something about you being released into the world and Joseph didn't know Hallelujah that God was going to use hatred and jealousy Hallelujah to bring forth the mystery in his life that he was going to use Hallelujah a lust demon and AAR demon to bring forth the mystery in his life Hallelujah bondage and being forsaken to bring forth the mystery in his life whoa Hallelujah God used all these things all these things that were a pattern of his journey Hallelujah all these things Hallelujah that was in his Pathway to bring forth what the mystery of life that was in him Hallelujah and you know we go through things and the first thing we say this ain't nothing but the the devil be careful cuz it could be God unveiling something in you something that the whole world needs amen let's understand the prophet had to lose his first wife and his baby girl just to get him in position Hallelujah to preach this gospel because there were things that he loved that was in the way Hallelujah of the revealing and if God has to move things out of the way Hallelujah to get you in the proper place he will do it and you think about L we go back to Joseph Hallelujah he didn't understand Hallelujah the mystery of God's will Hallelujah and so are we the same today you say Oh Brother D I'm just so ready to be done with it all Hallelujah that's good that's good because what that should be doing is drawing you closer to [Applause] Christ a real child of God hallelujah adversity and trials and tribulation does it make you want to quit it makes you want to see more of God hallelujah especially if you've ever tasted of his goodness yes sir church we look at Moses a man who was told that he was deliverer but how did that mystery of Deliverance come forth y'all know through hard trials the mystery of Christ being revealed in a situation listen to me the mystery of life being revealed in a situation he had no control over and we beings we love to be in control but sometimes the things that you can't control are the best for you because it causes you to rely on Christ amen hallelujah you know people say they come to church and you know uh we just love the steal Small Voice I just love that Ste right and still Small Voice you can stay in your comfort zone and nobody has to see you nobody has to hide you and that's all right praise God we know God is a still small voice but you know why people are afraid of an earthquake cuz you can't control [Applause] it you have to sit back hold on to something that's stable and stay there till the shaking is over Hallelujah and people don't like an earthquake in church because they can't control it Hallelujah they say that's just emotion no we need a earthquak in [Applause] church Hallelujah we need some worship and praise Hallelujah we need something that can shake us loose from our troubles Shake us loose from our trials Shake us loose from our sadness Hallelujah somebody need to just hold on and let God [Applause] Shake Hallelujah yes a no no God didn't speak to him in the earthquake the Bible says he spoke to him in a still Small Voice H you know why people don't like a fire cuz hard to control Hallelujah and once it gets on you if you're flamable you're flamable that thing gonna get out of control so fast I'm here to let y'all know that most of you are flamable huah and the devil don't want you to understand that you are contagious and if you touch somebody Hallelujah the next thing you know they are on fire if you touch somebody W you're like a blaze we don't want to be controlled Hallelujah I don't want to be controlled I Want to Be [Applause] Free hallelujah praise the Lord amen what makes the fire out of control it's oxygen Hallelujah the Breath of God in the church will make the people lose their [Applause] mind I'm tired of being control of all places this should be a manifestation of fire life amen hallelujah when we come here this should be a place of manifestation fire life because look when you on the job you got to be controlled when you're in school you got to be controlled at the red light you got to be controlled going down 77 got to be controlled when you at the restaurant you got to be controlled everywhere you go there are Governors put on your fire but when you come here I can lose my mind in [Applause] here and care less what somebody thinks Hallelujah think about it why is the enemy fighting this so hard why is the enemy fighting Freedom so hard because you look at the stage of the world the world is trying to bind us the world is trying to put us in a box where as a Christian you can't do this as a Christian you can't do that as a Christian you shouldn't do this as a Christian you shouldn't do that Hallelujah keep us under Governors Hallelujah keep us under the law Hallelujah but when you're really free Hallelujah there's an expression of life that just comes forth HJ I ain't going to be to too much long I'm about to close but church when you think about hallelujah how God uses things to put us hallelujah to unveil the mystery of his will and if I go back to Joseph Hallelujah maybe in the first stages of his life he didn't understand what God was doing but that never stopped him from being unveiled true sign of a Believer while they're going through adversity the m of God's will is still being unveiled in their life while they're going through things that they have no answer for they still have the right attitude cuz you look at Job Hallelujah he had no answers to the death of his children he had no answers for losing his cattle he had no answers for how his wife was treating him but his attitude was blessed be the name of the Lord what was he showing he was showing the attribute of God now I ask you what are you unveiling what are you revealing today are you revealing the attribute of Christ in you Hallelujah you know we talking about the earthqu in the fire and another thing that people don't like is a mighty Russian wind people say give me the Holy Ghost give me the Holy Ghost but I want it without sensation but the Bible says and and brother Jesse I've been accused of exciting the people brother digs all you like to do is come and excite the people get the people all worked up would you rather have a service where everybody's dead and nonresponsive to the word of God I'd rather have a service where we're all responsive to the word of God hallelujah what people do so often is they look at the Shell of the seed Hallelujah your expression right now it doesn't really Define everything about who you are it what happens when you leave here that really tells me who you are Hallelujah can you still give him praise when you all by yourself can you still throw your hands up can you still say Amen can you still say praise the Lord when you're all by yourself so you can do this with me here but can you do this without me Hallelujah huah and that's the true sign of believer I can give God all of me without you oh glory to [Applause] God if we look at the mystery of Christ revealed and people want it the way they want it and people look for a religion that fits their the that that fits their standards of living you know I want a God where I can you know and uh you know go go to the club and still come and say thank the Lord Jesus for my savior you know I want a God that allows me to do all the stuff out in the world and I can still come and say God you're my God I bless your name won't he do it but is that revealing Christ you know that bumper sticker one of the most powerful bumper stickers that's just a bumper sticker what will Christ do right cuz I always ask people I say do you think if Christ was here the god of Glory he would be sitting down with you smoking a blunt not at all you think he'd be at the concert with you with Beyonce talking about who run the world you think he'd be out there with that even though she says I profess Christianity you think Christ would be revealed in that you think Christ will be at The Honky Tonk Bar you know my icky breaky heart and all of stuff you think he would be revealed in that church if if you have a God that's revealed in the same things that's in the world that means you never gave up anything to live right and that also means what's the effect of Calvary in your life because Calvary came to set you free and if there's nothing Hallelujah you got freedom from that means you're still in bondage Hallelujah so I'm glad I do have a desire to drink and smoke and party and all the things that shows that the mystery of Christ is being revealed hallelujah oh my the Bible says he's so holy that the Hallelujah the a angels are unclean in his presence well that's something and you mean to tell me Hallelujah you can smoke four packs of cigaretts a day and say praise God I'm a Christian I'm saved Hallelujah you might have that desire but there's another revealing of life for you Hallelujah there's another step for you Hallelujah because Christ came to set us free Hallelujah he came to Deliver Us from all bondage Hallelujah but the key to life is you got to want to live that's the key to life God can Deliver Us from anything but we got to want it yes amen hallelujah you may you may go into prayer fall back into it again but what's in your heart is your heart saying Lord I need Deliverance Hallelujah Lord I believe you're a deliverer Hallelujah and you go back and do it again but do you come back and say Lord I want to stop this and really mean [Applause] it that desire is keeping you close to the Cross Hallelujah because if you didn't have that desire you just go do it and wouldn't think nothing about it h conviction is a powerful thing Hallelujah cuz me and you can be riding down the road listening to the same music and because it's something you've been delivered from Hallelujah it will begin to convict you right right and if I never had a problem with it it's just some just some music and we just riding and we listening to it and inside you're go oh lord god father please give me strength father God please help me Hallelujah see the thing about life nobody sees what it took to get you there right that's right Hallelujah nobody knows H the strength it takes to push out of dirt Hallelujah from just a little a little a little piece of plant a little piece of plant pushing through Hallelujah inches and feet of dirt Hallelujah why because it's Hallelujah trying to contact something he can [Applause] feel Hallelujah that plant Hallelujah is trying to contact something he can feel or the higher way of living and here we are Church we're trying to contact a whole new way of living Hallelujah and I believe where we are in this time Hallelujah God wants us to live above our trials he wants us to live above our tribulations how do you do it attitude the right attitude Hallelujah will allow you to live above the things that you're going through and that's the greatest mystery that confounds the devil amen when he looks at you and see what you're going through and he knows he's doing the best he can do and you turn around and smile and say praise our God Church the mystery of life is not Grievious when you're seeking God's will Hallelujah and sometimes there are things put in your way that should hurt you but when your attitude is right it won't even affect thank you but what are you saying remember Paul told a gripper and festers he said for this purpose I came I'm I'm born to go to Rome and before he got there it was a a day and night in the Deep the boat tore up they out there floating in the water he said he was whipped the 40 Stripes at least five times he was stoned talked about forsaken forgotten thrown over the wall all kinds of stuff and then he turns around and say if I Glory I'll glory in the things I've suffered right what was happening Calvary was being revealed in Paul but look there were things in his pathway that were there to affect him the devil anointed to affect him but his attitude was so right he couldn't even feel it he standing around the fire and next thing you know a snake jumps out and bites him ah he just scks it off see your attitude can be such a place of being in the will of God Satan has traps and when it happens it doesn't even affect you shake it off somebody need to Shake It Off shake it off and keep moving sh Paul say I'm going to Rome I'm supposed to go to Rome the snake ain't going to stop me the sea ain't going to stop me the persecution of the Jews ain't G Paul got one place he say hey I'm like what are you guys I'm a Jew see the mystery of Christ was being revealed in him hallelujah oh my and you think about that God allowed a man to suffer and do all these things what was he doing reflecting Christ because Christ claim he came how through the way of suffering and we look at the mystery of God being revealed you want to know how it's revealed Hallelujah church we say Oh Our God is a powerful God Amen he's a powerful God hallelujah but it's not his power Hallelujah that reveals us it was his suffering Hallelujah it wasn't the power power of God that saved us it was the suffering of God hallelujah because he could have easily turn this world upside down but no he put on some flesh and he was talked about he was scorned he was laughed at he was whipped he was marred more than any other man what was happening the mystery of Christ was being revealed Hallelujah the mystery of calv was being revealed Hallelujah and God showing Hallelujah the scripture that comes into place if you lay your life down you'll receive it again that's our mystery that's the revealing of the Bride for us to lay our life down and we'll receive it again [Music] Hallelujah church that's Bible every person in here that laid their life down they have a reward of eternal life laid their life down to do God's bidding has the reward of eternal life amenah and so are we amen hallelujah for those of us who lay our life down that Christ may be revealed in us earlier it put us right in the path to receive Zoe God's very own life Hallelujah and as that PL pushes through the dirt Hallelujah and pushes and pushing Hallelujah no longer in seed form but now we're looking at the life hallelujah we're looking at it grow Hallelujah and we don't understand the pace in which it grows all we know is that is growing hallu Hallelujah we don't know Hallelujah the time and date when it will push forth seeds Hallelujah but we believe that when it gets to a certain maturity nothing can stop it so the cycle of Life what does it do the cycle of life makes it stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger stronger and stronger and stronger and stronger to one day it pushes out the very thing that was in the ground Hallelujah cuz where is the seed the seeds in the fruit right so the very thing that was once in the ground is now about Hallelujah where everybody can see it not only that they can see it they can also eat on it Hallelujah you know a brother shared something with me and and and you can maybe try it out but he said I've never seen watermelon seed come out in the drw he said when I eat water and eat the seeds some kind of way the seeds are nourished through my body I never see them come out in the Dr and I was like I start to think about that now I ain't talking about these white water and Seed weed now I'm talking about this real real watermelon huah church when you have real fruit Hallelujah free from pesticides and and aroids and and preservatives and all this stuff it brings forth a nourishment Hallelujah that'll bring forth A Life That's Untouchable it'll bring forth something you say man this tastes different cuz I was in South America Hall I was in gallana h i could eat watermelon every day you say brother you doing that cuz you black no no they was Indian Hallelujah Hallelujah and man we was eating waterm for breakfast for lunch H I said y'all can give it to me for dinner church when it's real even the color is different I'm talking about red watermelon not this pink stuff that ain't quite right there red juicy H not this fuzzy stuff you cut the waterm over it's kind of fuzzy no uhuh over there where all the stuff all these preservatives and all these things are not connected to it it's just dirt sunlight and water H the natural Hallelujah substances of Life the natural substances of life will always produce a perfect crop Hallelujah and you take Hallelujah Spirit truth and the anointing it would always produce the word of God [Applause] you give me Hallelujah quality Spirit quality truth and quality anointing and I'll give you Jesus Christ I'll show you the supernatural I'll show you th had the Lord I'll show you a God who no longer in the rainbow but he's walking behind flesh Hallelujah that's the mystery of God hallelu nothing added to it nothing taken away Hallelujah but just give me the word of God and it will produce the Life of Christ every time hallelu every time but let's remember this in my closing come musicians let's remember this Hol that the miss mystery of Christ is not in heaven it's on Earth hallelujah hallelujah the mystery of Christ is not in heaven it's on Earth Hallelujah because remember Christ came down and was born in a manger hallelujah what was that that was the mystery of Heaven being born on Earth Hallelujah and from that time Hallelujah the revelation of Christ never left the Earth cuz it was passed from Life To Life from Individual to individual Hallelujah you had people hallelujah identifying that this was Christ Hallelujah remember Simeon came up and he said hey I he first he told the devil I can't die until I see the Lord amen oh now that's knowing who you are hallelujah what was he doing Hallelujah Simeon was controlling the mystery of life and death by simply knowing who he is and he spoke he said hey the Lord has revealed to me that I can't die until I see the Lord's Christ now can you imagine Hallelujah and he was an old man why would he be talking about death obviously Hallelujah there was a time span where he should have been dead but then Revelation came and said no you going to control death Hallelujah in church he lived think about it maybe diabetes came he said nope you got to go back I ain't seen God yet H maybe depression and suicide came you say nope you got to go I ain't seen God yet maybe Hallelujah another sickness in the body cancer something came you say nope I ain't seen God yet hall hallelujah and on and on or whatever the sicknesses was in that day Simeon controlled it how by the revelation of life [Applause] and then hallelujah Church nobody else knew who God was and now Christ being born in a manger Simeon comes up holds the baby and says now I can rest I've seen my Lord am Hallelujah church right now we are in here holding the revelation of Jesus Christ in our arms Amen in our spiritual arms nobody else can see his birth nobody else can see his death therefore nobody else can experience the revealing but he's allowed us to tap into the mystery of life and now like Simeon we can have rest Hallelujah we can have rest because he said I've come to give you life and life more abundantly Hallelujah now that's the question ask yourself am I living Abundant Life I'm just here going through the motion it's Sunday let's go to church you know L and that I can tell you some testimonies Hallelujah where where where where where whole families got saved because of one person one person that came to Christ and was serious about I ain't saying walk around with a Bible slapping everybody you Sinners no I I ain't talking about that I'm talking about just living for God in the sweetness and beautiness of Holiness and it just drew in family members Hallelujah till this one got saved that one got saved this one got saved that one got till the whole family got saved what was it they saw Christ amen h hallelujah it's all Christ and church I'm here to let you know Hallelujah that it it takes a a a great man to lead Hallelujah but it takes a great people to follow Hallelujah you say well brother Jesse is our pastor but I want you to understand Hallelujah David was a giant killer but everybody that follow David were giant Killers also amen hallelujah so God will put a life on display so you can see the potential of what you're following and not only the potential of what you're following but the potential of who you are Hallelujah cuz one day David went out to fight by himself and and one of Goliath Brothers say he got a new sword and he want to kill somebody he came out with that new sword to kill David and the Bish I came up behind him and cut his head off and then he told David he said hey don't you ever go out here by yourself again you're the light of Israel Hallelujah so David was surrounded by other giant Killers hallelujah hallelujah if there's more Giants in the land that mean there's more people to kill Giants hallelujah hallelujah and I love about those men David's Mighty Men they were just as strong and as powerful as he is but they surrender their gifts to David why because they saw [Applause] Christ Hallelujah and we choose the pastors we choose not because of dynamic Ministries but because we can see Christ hallelujah we're eating off the branch of life and we're being fed and we're growing Hallelujah and we're pushing out from our tree that's what it's all about H it's not all about oh man I like when my pastor spins around he does this moving oh it just excites me that's all right but who is he when you sick Hallelujah who is he when you a little depressed Hallelujah can he impart life into you that's what we want and as individuals that's what we should be able to do impart life into one another when the brothers get up here and s and worship what should it do it should impart a spirit of Life Hallelujah church you can go all through the Bible Hallelujah and you look at the mystery of life being revealed God allowed a spirit to come on Saul but when David played what happened the spirit left Hallelujah because David was showing that his life was stronger than that Spirit Hallelujah and then sa would say oh my praise God I feel refreshed what you got should bring forth a refreshing hallelujah how many believe it amen let's let's give God some praise let's pray Lord Jesus father we thank you for life Lord and life revealed Lord and to know that we're not just people here Lord quoting and reading
