walk your spirit is a baby my big dream my victory your spirit is a baby so I think my victory [Music] it's gonna be now so lord praise God well that sounds really good thank the Lord I like that what I can hear it myself I'd like to read out of a couple portions description I only look at the same thought as this morning and I had these a few thoughts I never really thought about till this morning like I said around 8 o'clock cuz I was studying and just kind of seemed to start flowing so I guess we'll read I'm gonna read this thought Luke chapter 2 I want to go to Luke chapter 2 this may seem strange but I think you'll catch it once we get going and we look at battling to stay in the spirit we look at the life of the Lord Jesus for a moment or look at the life of daniel just to kind of give some direction you know for our lives and i think some encouragement so Luke chapter 2 like to read at the end of the chapter why don't we read verse 48 down to 52 hope I didn't confuse all the other Saints I told him I told her my text if we had a second service I know I sent the text out but I'll apologize to them maybe they don't think we're having service but maybe the text didn't go through maybe that's the problem but praise the Lord we're happy to be in the house of Lord today just trying to watch and see how everything would you know work out you know with different things I just want to see how well worked out so Luke chapter 248 and when they saw him they were amazed and his mother said in him son why hast thou thus dealt with us behold thy father and I have sought thee sorrowing and he sent them how is it that ye sought me which he not that I must be about my father's business almost sounds like a little rebuke to him doesn't it but then he turns around and rebukes them right and they understood not the saying which he spake unto them think about how hard it must have been for Jesus Church he would say these things his mom didn't understand him his dad didn't understand him and then we got older even the disciples didn't understand him think about how hard that would have been and he knew Judas wasn't gonna catch it the whole time but what'd he do he just stayed humble praise God he just stayed with the word and he was faithful now look at verse 51 and he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these sayings in her heart and Jesus increased in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man how old is Christ at this time well the next time we hear about Christ is 18 years later so there's this absence from 12:30 and the neck time we read about him is Luke chapter 3 verse 21 now when all the people were baptized it came to pass that Jesus also being baptized I like this and praying we like to see he was trying to get in the spirit raised God we want to get the spirit we got to pray separate ourselves and what happened that heaven was open the Holy Ghost he sent it in a bodily shape like a dove upon him praise God and a voice came from heaven which said thou art my beloved son in thee I am well pleased let's just have one more word of Prayer if we can here just smoke yeah I mean on your heart just make it known unto the Lord here how many father we love you we're laying our lives before your Lord we're trying to submit ourselves to you Lord let your Holy Spirit help us now to grow in wisdom and stature and in favor with God and man as we're battling to stay in the spirit in Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen god bless you be in see the praise God so I got all these little thoughts I want to start with the thought I ended with who was with revival we'll look at those different quotes on revival and I just noticed it as we have different preachers and you know even with last weekend we hear the word a revival all the time and so I just want to go over this again just briefly again that there are so many different revivals that we need to recognize which one we need help with right which one we need to be in okay so I read this one here from 1959 November 15th brother Branham says God so arranged it that his program cannot move without you and I how many want to see a move right here it can't move until everybody gets in one accord right and as long as we're not doing what God leads us to do we're paralyzing his program so see that encourages me I've been preaching on finding your purpose right and once everybody gets in there purpose and serving their ministry right and and manifesting their gifts then God's program will be paralyzed right it'll keep moving on right in order the way it should move on he says but when the church moves by the anointing of the Holy Ghost then we're in God's will doing this program Oh as soon as I return from California the Lord willing what the Branham tabernacle needs is a revival amen they need a revival and the filling of the Holy Ghost that's the great need of the tabernacle some of the finest people in the world come here but what they need is the baptism of the Holy Ghost what a compliment I can say the same can't you the finest people we've ever met in this world are in message churches but what we need is every person in the church to get the Holy Ghost then they'll manifest their gifts then their manifest their purpose right so that's the local church revival okay next quote here's what I like because I'm a teacher but look what he says the night before God willing when I come back I'm going out to get a little rest now for a week or two so when I come back God willing I want to hold a revival here at the tabernacle of just a teaching revival how many people want that see most people they want shouting screaming healings which is that's wonderful but listen we won't ever see our lives really change until we can be taught the Word of God now how many quote time you how many times you ever heard that quote preached never everything's all we got a scream we got a shout when he did that raise which that's that's wonderful we need that but here he's has a teacher revival we're just gonna take somewhere in the Bible and just go clomp clomp through our text he says see just teach the Word of God so that we can be founded because teaching he says he said set your roots down he says it sets your foundation it makes you stabilized when you can be taught the Word of God so see what Simonton camera trying to they're trying to teach us to be in under the spirit they're teaching us how to bring a revival David almost had it all right but he just had to consult the word so what does the word say about revival the word says you got to separate yourself first and then pray until you get the revelation of the Spirit and then act on that and then do what it says and then you see the fruits of it later praise God so this is something we got to grow in to praise the Lord but Amanda said in 1959 I'm going in the wilderness I mean to stay there because way down in my soul I feel that I need a closed walk with God where do you feel it it's the hole then what I am I don't just want to walk I try to walk right before him but I want a closer walk with him while the Brandon tap Tabernacle is having a revival I want one myself I just don't want it to happen in the building I want it to happen in me look at that see do you realize that you everybody here could have revival and I could miss out on it or it can be the other way I can have revival and you all can miss out on it so the thing to do is recognize who's having a revival if it's me let me stay in revival if it's somebody else let me be like them praise God so see daily revival Church local revivals remember of that great quote I love it brother Branham says he said see brother BAM he said see brother Neville he said we're gonna stand there he said arms around each other and he's we're gonna stand before Jesus I better have said look he said brother never look we stayed together through the all the hot and cold and look there he is the son of God amen hallelujah see all the ups and all the downs all the hard times like amen and I were saying we've seen so many people come and go to our churches in the last few years that doesn't move me a bit in fact it makes me more sure that I believe the truth because the reasons people leave aren't many times are outside the Word of God like these last ones and it's not even it doesn't even move me at all cuz I know what the word says and I recognize what that spirit is doing behind it because it's an evil spirit trying to take you out of church taking your ties away I see what it is it's greed Amen it's it's it's the Bible said they separated themselves not having the Holy Spirit see yeah and I've told you before one of the first sins people do is miss church and when they start missing church I don't care how much you say you got the Holy Ghost if you're miss Church the Bible said they separate themselves sensual not having the spirit see because there's a spirit but if there's a spirit in you he said the Holy Spirit rying to drive you to church he said if there's a spirit keeping you out it's the wrong spirit because your soul can't feed on the Word of God I'm sorry anything except the Word of God oh I hope you're catching something here look around you I hope you're catching something praise God are you with me it will never point you away from the Word of God the Holy Spirit always points you to the Word of God see he wants a closer walk see we can see revival on other people but we want to see it in our lives I want more of the Holy Spirit in me to reflect Christ in me I want to be like him I want every every true Christian wants to be like him that's my heart's desire to be like Jesus he's the example of what I want to be here's that quote again I read an invisible union that he said but watch when that spiritual bride when she begins to have revival when she begins to come back and light herself up with the Word of God watch them again you see how the scriptures at that time there will be a message sweep out to catch that bride watch the woman the elect that's speaking of the latter rain because he's already he saw the latter rain because his teaching rain is flowing right there now here's what I didn't read this morning you this in 1984 the coming the great coming revival not pouring on the Holy Spirit but BAM said remember it was in the evening time when the bride was chosen see were part of another revival Rebecca was taken in the evening time it was the evening time that she met Isaac he was out in the field it's evening time our Gentile revival Gentile revival is ending pretty soon so brother Adam goes and takes it to another level we're under the Gentile revival event and he said the Jews are going to take the revival as soon as they can see the power of God manifesting and receive the Holy Ghost they'll take the gospel our Gentile days are ending get into the kingdom while you have a chance to get into the kingdom so you have a revival for your age and but then we also have the revival since God left the Jews and come to the Gentiles amen all right we just got revived all over the place where he's gone remember what does revive means to make alive again and the Bible said the Spirit of Christ has quickened us in fact the word revival will use twice the judgment so the word revived for us actual word damaged it was quick and that's the word the Bible said he were quickened together with him so that means the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's the revival the Bible speaking of but Paul said be renewed in the spirit of your mind that's the daily revival all right so there's another revival that's coming praise God or that we're I'm sorry we're already part of it's the Gentile revival amen now let me read this this is where Bubba have said in 1964 recognize you today and its message he said all the papers are saying fast pray fast pray the herald of is coming bass pray why do they do that why do they do that they want a Great Awakening they're crying believing that they were being awakening they're good people what is it what have they done they've not recognized the awakening of the bride so Branham says the 1964 the [Applause] they're away we know we heard the shot okay all right I'll use both again amen just let him hear it praise God amen however it happens that the people here praise the Lord see and then the one quote by Rev says they haven't had the revival yet of course that's speaking of the latter rain so see you gotta take all these quotes and kind of line it up with the word and see where it all mixed together praise God so see they've not recognized the awaken of the bride but by being a Christian they feel the pull of the hour but they haven't recognized what's been done that's what's making them feel that way they know something's supposed to happen but they're looking for way up in the future when it's already happened right by you he says Amen my brand new the bride had woken up she'd heard the shout so see all the other quotes we got to line up together with the word to make sure we're not confused about revival because listen I know I'm revived praise God you should know you're revived - you were dead in sins but now I'm revived Amen I'm living I'm alive I'm obeying the word I'm loving God yes so I fall short daily sure but I also revive daily amen I get back up again every day praise God because I'm a warrior I'm a soldier I'm a fighter I'm fighting the good fight of faith praise God I didn't give up on the faith I'm still fighting and many times I'm on the front grounds praise God or the the front of the battle praise God the frontlines that's the word I'm looking for that's right little man said see she's awakened she's had a revival now the one that that people stumble over is the third seal but we're brother Branham says the bride hasn't had a revival yet there's been no revival there no manifestation of God to serve the bride we're looking for it now it'll take those seven unknown thunders back there to wake her up again yeah he'll send it he promised it so see that's where I told you this morning I believe this quote is speaking of once the seven seals are finished the bride will receive that and be born again and have the revival and I believe that's happened so if you ask me I would say yes I know brother have said this but he also said a year later that she's awakened right here's he says in 63 says she hasn't had a revival yet it'll take the seven thunders but then BAM says in the church age book the thunders were the revelation of the seven seals well the seven seals are revealed and the Brides awaken so I believe the brides have a revival praise God hey man I believe that amen and if not Church then what what are you living off of I'm living on the Word of God I'm not dead to the word I'm living the word praise God every day I live the word what are you living on we're living on the Word of God the Word of God gives us life praise God amen it has to be break Scott one of the revivals are they're praised there's either a foolish version revival or a wise version I'm feeding on the Word of God I'm redeeming the time I'm believing the four Word of God I've got revival glory see he said the church age book he'll do two things so according to Malachi 4 he'll turn the hearts of the children of the fathers number two he'll reveal the mysteries of the seven thunders in Revelation 10 which are the revelations contained the seven seals Amen it will be these divinely revealed mystery truths that literally turned the hearts of the children to the Pentecostal father's Amen what do we design why do we come here on a Sunday night so we because we're believing the book of Acts is going to repeat we see glimpses of it we see we see little glimpses of it we're thankful for that but we know it's going to come in the fullness of its power it's prophecy for thus saith the Lord the fullness of Pentecost will be in the bride I said last week to you and I know that so see now look there's many kinds of revivals can anybody see that there's your daily revival and just because you backslide daily doesn't mean you're not sealed let me read this quote if you never heard it I had a 65 or 70 year old woman come up weeping when I went to Albert sang brother Jesse I've been the message all my life and I still don't even know if I'm saved and if you had asked me I always said certainly save sealed fill with Holy Ghost look how faithful she is look at her beautiful family and children grandchildren you know what I had to do I had to tell her about this quote and she started crying every Jason and listen and listen this is what I found in my life listen buddy man I know you will I see my a lot of myself at a man that's why I'm saying that cuz he's got so much zeal you know the the longer I live the hot the the more I see my zeal kind of go down I'm talking about in my natural flesh brother William do you understand what I'm saying okay like I've told you this 10 years ago I woke up every morning I was just on fire burning for like I guess I had to screen sister Wendy I John got me two screens there 28 7 inch screens and I studied all morning I was like this no I was on fire now nothing's changed with the last 10 years I still got the Holy Ghost having a name any evil sins but I just get more tired easily and nothing nothing about my life has changed in fact if you asked me I would feel like I obey God more but I'm just more tired and my zeal has just gotten lower but like when it comes down to it and I get up here and I get under the anointing yeah I feel returned but then in my my flesh sister Beatrice my flesh you don't have the zeal that's what I was saying this is your lesson because look what brother if anyone would have felt zeal for God it would have been brother Branham who saw angels he saw Jesus twice but look what he says in 1960 no 1957 this is why I shared with her sister from Albion I thought surely this woman's a saint she didn't even didn't even feel saved anymore he said listen brother you're never saved by any sign now you might need a sign to help you believe we know there's quotes on that tin right with the woman sister Bruce you're never saved by any sensation you are saved when you've met God's condition of his word and nothing else are you saved by in other words when you obeyed the word you were saved whether you felt it or not you obeyed the word so if you do your part God has to do his part you are saved he said that's right God's Word made away you're not saved because you feel like you're saved he said I'm not saying because I feel like I'm saved because a lot of times I don't feel that way a 50 year old man who's seen Jesus Christ twice and had the greatest revivals in his generation said sometimes I don't even feel saved a lot of the time see because what happens but imagine you got three lights when you're born he said when you reach a certain age when that lights turn off I think at twenty-five one turns off at fifty another turns off and you got one more sometime after 75 that light goes out are you with me Church in other words you're in other words like this your will to live your motivation to live right like did you see sister Tang passed away do you see that uh they just just want to go home to be with the Lord that's what I'm saying doctors say there's two doctors know this too the person will die when they want to die when they want to go home and be with the Lord right but they gotta want to do it because there's a will right there's Paul said I wanna there's I want to be abs if I'm absent from the body I'm present with the Lord he said but I want to die go be of Jesus he said but you need me right that's same for these chapter five I've got a desire to go be with them but you need me here a lot of times a prophet of God didn't even feel saved if anybody had the Holy Ghost he had the Holy Ghost but I'm saying because God gave the promise I met God's conditions and upon God's holy word I can defeat Satan seven days a week and as many nights because it's God's Word oh thank you Jesus amen glory you and I will lose our zeal and our flesh you know in our excitement about the word in our minds now right because everything gets old right even picking up a message but think about how man I was so excited the first time I read the church age book but now honestly just the flesh right it's kind of hard to crack it open it's easier just to click and listen to a sermon hello right judge right see what what is it is it because I said that you're not safe no you still honor the word it's just harder as you get older you lose your strength you lose your desire right you just the life's the exact kind of say like the life force almost like mother William I used to wake up and I just get a drink of water you know brush my teeth every I was right to the word well now I got to sit there and I got a sometimes I just got a look at my phone and sometimes I just got a I just something about me I'm just tired you know just can't do it like I used to and I think what's wrong with me and I hear this quote and I say thank you Jesus praise God yeah because we're not it's not based upon feeling and they got it's not amen cuz he said a lot of times I don't even feel safe praise God that's the prophet of God he was the star in the hand of Jesus Christ amen the burning to see what was burning not his flesh not his spirit all the time but his soul was on fire praise God but it just goes to show how deep we got to get he said to hear from the soul think about this church how still how still in quiet you have to be to get down to the very depths of your soul about any question in your life see well think about it all day you'll plant it out you'll plan out all day think think they think but really getting down to the soul you got to get quiet before the Lord you got to repent you got to humble yourself you got to go really deep right really deep in prayer and humility to really get down to the soul or else you'll just make a decision like a whim I can make it off a whim brother ma'am knew that he said I've got to go out to my cave so I can have a revival like churches heaven see he knew he couldn't have a revival in his own home isn't that something jerk that's something sometimes we got to leave our own homes to have revival I'm not saying every time but in that case he had to sew now let's read Romans 8 that brother cam read last week's so beautiful it was such a beautiful man all those sermons were so beautiful amen and I were talk about Simon's messages so beautiful showing us the end time my we're right at the end because that the book is open right like Ezekiel chapter 9 or 1 the books open and we got to be sighing and crying for the abominations amen hallelujah alright verse 5 Romans 8:5 yeah now verse 4 is about walking after the spirit not the flesh verse 5 for they that are after the flesh do mind the things of the flesh but they that are after the spirit the things of the Spirit for to be carnally minded is death but to be spiritually minded is life and peace so see walking in the spirit is life and peace and yet brother Branham heart didn't feel saved a lot because the mind battles but the Bible said when you can praying at your mind what is it the Bible say it says it's transformed by the renewing of your mind God offers life and peace but they meant to all of us right I keep using you sorry I'll do you somebody else use myself God offers life and peace but it's got to be and transforming our minds to life in peace in other words we have to remember I'm supposed to be walking in life I'm supposed to be walking in peace and then we can repent of how we were thinking and get in we get the right thoughts because your soul the Bible said the soul doesn't even sin it doesn't even sin when you're born again so it's getting your mind in the right frame to have that life in peace because remember I remember the court I read you brother have said once you say you got the Holy Ghost all the guns are pointed on you and you better believe a battles coming I don't know about you but everyone I met that's never been in war never talked about how peaceful it is in war oh it's Birds it was so pleasant in Afghanistan not the ones I've talked to you they are constantly on their toes they could died any moment the land mimes and then the snipers and the children walking up with self exploding grenades on him friends that I'm friends have lost their legs because of those things grenades I used to go to church with a guy name's Jeremiah blew off his leg so he's he's like that now he's got like a little brace there in Afghanistan war is not a time of life and peace so our minds are constantly gonna feel like war but we've got to make an effort to renew them to feel like we have life and peace praise God in other words you got a battle to keep the right thoughts in your spirit so you can experience the life and peace that God offers us amen I've told you this before I've had some serious conversations recently with people that left the church you know I was something I was sharing about it recently and in years past and I've been so nervous before those phone calls but before I prayed God gave me life in peace so in other words in the midst of the storm I was able to pray and find life in peace okay I didn't feel like life and peace before that I was all nervous hard sleeping at night because of all they're gonna accuse me of this they're gonna accuse me that they don't believe this doctor what am i what do I know about that doctrine what scripture they have on that what quotes have on that it makes me nervous by the way but the prayer the Bible said when you cast your cares on the Lord the Bible said cast him on the Lord he cares for you amen draw nigh to God he'll draw nigh to you that's how we battle we meditate on things that are holy things that are pure things that are right things that are lovely praise God we meditate on things that are true he's our Lord and when we do that it brings us life and peace in our minds in our minds now you remember this oh brother BAM says he said he's talking about a prayer line that he had in 1964 he said I seen women and men holding babies and they were wet because they were standing outside in the rain but in 1964 you remember you passed your brothers weeks from now you will find out a great thing took place there they will recover I say that 90% of them will recover I've never felt such a form of faith it was really wonderful now just act now look we says he tells the people just act go on and act like it was all over no matter if you didn't feel it jesus never did say did you feel it he said do you believe it do you believe it and we believe it and he is here now and we give Him praise and glory for all that he's done I thought well it has to be in Scripture and that's right Jesus told Martha he said in whosoever believeth I'm sure liveth and believeth in me shall never die believe it's now this he didn't say do you feel this he said do you believe this hey man it didn't matter what they felt they already felt sad Lazarus had died but you didn't say look at your feelings he said do you believe it amen do you believe on the resurrection do you believe on the life do you believe you'll see your brother again do you believe it not do you feel it do you believe it praise God amen now by a man die were talking it's true sometimes you'll feel the anointing right I bet man talk about the super anointing he spoke six squirrels in existence right and then the seven time he spoke it so we'd find that that six one because the brother was given a hard time well lord help us to know brother Brown told the truth or not where's they still do it today but he say he said I felt that super anointing come on me and he said that's the same anointing when he spoke those squirrels that same super anointing came on him to tell had he right give her what she asked for so this is George there will be times we feel the super anointing but many times we won't like I read this morning the scripture that's a great revelation to me the Bible said if you don't walk if you walk in the flesh I'm sorry when you walk in the spirit you will not fulfill the desires of the flesh so anytime you turn down sin you're walking in the spirit whether you feel it or not you are going by the leadership of the Holy Spirit amen amen you see your souls already anointed but the reason you might not feel is because maybe your minds are struggling your mind battles maybe you're tired a long day at work and now the kids are doing this again and now I'm doing this again or my husband or my wife is doing this again we got a we got to calm ourselves renew our mind and remember what the Word of God says and it brings us life and peace when we live from the soul praise God hey Matt oh thank you Jesus yeah I haven't got nowhere to her I thought I'd be my thank the Lord okay the BAM says when you really get saved and filled the Holy Ghost something happens with the Word of God begins to manifest okay I think I skipped something here okay he's talking about yeah he says sometimes you will feel emotion I want to say a few more here here let me read another quote this is from the world is falling apart 1963 he said now you people standing here now look don't you rely upon some emotion although it has emotion in it don't you rely upon whether you're going to speak with tongues or not don't think nothing about it God will take care of that see you asked for Jesus Christ to come into your life and you live in and to live himself through you you don't want no more thoughts of your own you want his thoughts praise God see it encourages them if you want the Holy Ghost don't look for a motion but you know it's coming praise God he said now there is some people who just live upon emotion right we've all seen that if people don't feel it they don't believe it some people say well we got a lot of that in our Pentecostal movement and they will go in which is fine they'll Pat their hands and play the music and when it stops whoo a bucket of water went over everything we got in a habit of doing that it should become one of our customs look what he says here let me tell you something this is from thirst 1965 which I've been listening to let me tell you something when you're worshiping God in the spirit and truth when it becomes a custom for you to do it because you think you ought to do it because you think if you don't shout or jump or dance with the music your neighbors gonna think your back slid he said you're drinking from a stagnated stream amen see when you're worshiping and you just trying to get excited just make people think you're not back said he said you you are back slid see we've got to do it because we know it's right and like my bearson act act upon it act what you know the Word of God is and then pretty soon the emotion will come praise God but don't do it and don't act like it just because you want people not to think your back slid not somebody who lives on emotion well Ram said in the foresee us one of my favorite quotes about the Holy Ghost he said sometimes it brings joy beyond measure sometimes like he says sometimes we went through that it brings such a joy that you get over flooded he said I know there's a lot of fanaticism people carrying on I know sometimes they do it when the music is jumping up and down and everything I believe that too and I've seen people in the day as long as the music is play everybody was jumping and screaming but when the music stopped it stopped well that's all right as far as I'm concerned as long as the people lives right I've been to churches like that comprend ago so that as long as the music is on they're rejoicing but as soon as you start the music there's no more rejoicing and we got to be careful and don't happen to us if you're really rejoicing you don't matter if the music is on or off if the church is empty or full if it's revival or not you just want to give God praise now you start bringing the word that's the thing that actually brings life is the word that brings the joy of simulation of new wine and that's what it was on Pentecost when the word was vindicated so see what is that what actually brings life the word the word the word so see here's how it is when you breach the people receive the seed but then you got to water the seed praise God that's when you rejoice but the actual thing is getting the seed the word then you want it with your praises milligrams the 1964 voice to the side now notice when his presence is near it certainly it brings emotion as I spoke this morning anything without emotion is dead and any religion that hasn't got some emotion to it you better bury its dead it brings emotion he quickens us and when we're quick and let us remember what quickened us what did it it's the presence of the Holy Spirit Jesus Christ in arm it's showing himself that he's alive not a corporal body he said when that time when the corporal body returns from heaven time shall be no more like the the person who just left our church was saying time was no more I sure I say I shared this quote and said no times no more when Jesus Christ comes back I said you misunderstood the scripture see they were separate they were trying to say time should be no more the rapture already happened and all these things like that come on this is the Millenium with all this death and killing nah see you got a real little more in the script yeah I read a little more quotes got to read more keep going so see it's a balance we're not supposed to look for emotion we're supposed to obey the word and believed the promise praise God and then sometime after that we will feel emotion but not necessarily right away and then brother man said a lot of times I don't even feel like I'm saved see cause he was getting older dying and your body has less strength right you need more naps see it didn't feel like it here's another one I love this one baptism Holy Ghost 1958 you know it don't take a lot of hollering but I like the holler brother man I do like the holler but it don't take a lot of hollering Church it don't take a lot of screaming that's alright nothing against it it's alright it don't take that here's what it takes oh my it takes a submitted heart setting in heavenly places feasting on the things of the Spirit and what does the spirit feast on emotion he said not all together so see I mean they're still apart when you're really enjoying the things of God you get emotional but it's not just emotion that the Holy Spirit feeds on he says it's the word it brings he said but it brings emotion this is honest this is the happiest place in the world I've ever been right here we start talking about to learn heaven and the promises of God I think about what Jesus Christ blood has done for me I just get so happy praise God I was watching the live stream between services and I'm like going like this and I'm like man I never thought I was so happy in my life there praise God and that's how it is every Sunday man hallelujah see because the Holy Ghost when you obey it it will bring a motion but that's not what we live on although it has part of it praise God we got to make sure the Holy Ghost can flow out of that flue we got to leave that channel open so we can get emotional for God right what people clog it up with sports people clogged up with bitterness and they can't get any emotion anymore they can't show their emotion for God and I remember praying for this years ago I prayed god help me to show more emotion and it wasn't long enough that brother William God dealt with some things in my life I had some complexes getting some preachers I was upset with my dad and God healed all those and now the emotions sometimes runs like a faucet praise God hey man I just asked him a simple request I want to see I knew something in me knew I need to be emotional for God and Jesus said ask and you shall receive alright okay now that I didn't know was gonna take that long that really wasn't the thought I was gonna go on but praise the Lord anyhow thank you Lord here thank the Lord now here's my two thoughts I kind of wind up I got some real now they might seem simple but they're real important things I want to say here no.1 obey the spirit like Jesus Christ his whole life he obeyed the Holy Spirit he never did a miracle till the marriage at the wedding at Cana they're right he was 30 years old so the first 30 years of his life he never did one miracle yet he walked in full obedience to the Holy Spirit praise God amen how does that apply to you well let's go back to Luke chapter 2 this is what our text was so I want to say all this battling to stay in the spirit to say this verse 51 look to 51 I just read a the book I've been reading about prayer and fasting it's a powerful I love it it's better I think man this guy must have new brother branham or something he's he's riding everything brother Ram said he's just not saying bail Rams name and he may have but he brought out this thought how we don't know anything about Jesus Christ life in his early manhood right from 12 years old to 30 we don't know one thing about him other than what the Bible says in Luke 251 the Holy Spirit chose one I'm sorry two scriptures to describe 18 years of his life hallelujah verse 51 and he went down with them and came to Nazareth and was rebellious unto them did I read that right can we just peek can we just dramatize for a moment Jesus Christ twelve year old went down he's in his mother's and father's house that's just that's just kind of peek in the window can we he's 12 years old that's just kind of peeking I wonder how Jesus Christ is living his life let's watch him Mary says Jesus can you clear off the table we'd like to get ready for supper mom come on I want to study the scripture what do you mean we don't see that happening Jesus how can you go brush your teeth and get ready for bed come on I just got started on my game and now you're 12 right perfect for you [Laughter] twelve-year-old Jesus like sure mom I'll drop what I'm doing I was working on some woodwork over here carpenter son hello thought about making a new Ark maybe yeah mom I'll drop that I'd like to set the table for you that's okay Jesus can you go brush your teeth and get your jammies on your river bed sure mom I was in the middle reading some scrolls but I'll stop my Bible reading time so I can obey you mom I'm not Jesus can you go to bed your brothers sisters crying here and can you just go to Becky get your little brother sisters he was the oldest can you get your younger beau sisters ready for bed the baby's sick and crying sure mom I'll put him to bed your brother's throwing up Jesus can you go get it I'm nursing the baby can you go clean it up sure mom I'll be happy to clean up the throw-up thank goodness praise God Jesus you're 15 all the friends AG's going to go out on the town for a few drinks tonight oh no to my the Sabbath I want to study a little bit on the Scriptures real quick I don't feel led to do that ah ha ha what did he do he became subject to mom and dad Jesus can we go out and you'll get on our hot rods no my dad asked me not to do that and the scripture says on your father and mother praise God and you'll have a long life on the earth but he only lived 33 years my so birth amen the only Scriptures we have about the life of Jesus Christ from 12 to 30 are he went to his house and he obeyed everything his parents said and he was a man that obeyed every word of the Holy Spirit and if anybody walked in the Spirit even before his born-again it was Jesus Christ he walked through justification must walk through sanctification so all that time he was walking through sanctification completely obedient to the Holy Spirit and let me just say like this the word came to my mind the silent years this is these are all the silent years we never hear about between all the miracles and the revival a church we've had some silent years around the message write programs not here anymore the prophets not here anymore but what did he do he increased in what wisdom wisdom redeems the time Jesus didn't give his 20s to the lusts of the the world in the cares of life he devoted his teens and his 20s to learning more about his father's business was that a waste absolutely not in fact it was the greatest investment the world's ever known amen because it produce a perfect spotless lamb that God could offer for the sins of all of us amen were those valuable years yes and what was he learning so valuable in those years just to submit to the Word of God and as he did that he gained more wisdom and then he gained more favor with God and with man let me say like this in Jesus battled to stay in the spirit his battle was focusing on living a godly life in his home and submitting to the leaders in his life that was his battle to stay in the Holy Spirit so he could get borned again so let's bring it to our church many times we'll have silent years or there's seven months where we don't see much going on but church is something going on absolutely people are either growing in submission to the Holy Spirit or they're falling away and rebelling against the Holy Spirit are you with me such a beautiful thought the quiet ears of Jesus Christ's life my goodness gracious it's nice to kind of peek into his home life isn't it Jesus will you take off the trash no I just woke up I want to play my game I want to read my oh sure mom I'll take out the trash I'd be happy to do that and this is why Church it's so important to be disciplined to our prayer life to our Bible reading and just submitting to those in authority over us like every day in other words every day's a chance to grow in the spirit's anointing right if not then Jesus was net and he wasn't growing but the Bible said he did they meant he increased in wisdom and favor with God and with man by doing what just giving God first place in his life week after week brother amen year after year decade after decade by almost two decades so the simple of the things we think all not so important just being a church early praying before church reading my Bible obeying my mom and dad submitting to the pastor right submitting to the preaching these things we think are so little but yet they're so magnified in the life of Christ he was so faithful church when he became thirty they let him read the scroll in the temple you had to earn that they didn't let any sinner come in there to a holy temple in a synagogue no you had to live the right life and he done it before but the time that he read it the anointing was even greater on him amen he said this day this scripture he never done that before he's God Amen but he lived such a life and he got so anointed that he uttered something he never uttered before he said this day this scripture is fulfilled that's what we need to do we need to be so faithful and be so disciplined and be so obedient and be so obedient to the Word of God that God can use us like that the spirit of Jesus Christ is spirit of prophecy eighteen years of silence but oh it was speaking loudly can I say like this it was thundering out it was a live life it was thundering out the Word of God Oh church do you see how important it is to seek ye first the kingdom of God if so many people are on the message that are really not seeking the kingdom of God first they're seeking Paychex first they're really not putting God first reading your Bible praying walk in the spirit obedience coming to church they're really not even doing some of those things but jesus said if you seek first if you put them the most emphasis on the kingdom of God and seek it first and in the righteousness of Christ let me see you ever see that that's me taking on his righteousness that's me living a more righteous life we have to seek a more righteous life amen seek ye first the kingdom of God and His righteousness in other words so I'll live the right way and if you do that one a little more righteously seek him first everything else will be added unto you like Tim Pruett I don't know if you heard that testimony they built their church and it was already paid off by the time they built it he said because God told him to build that church that had been like I'm just estimating at least two to three million dollars God told him build a church and he was seeking first the kingdom of God he didn't want to build a church but the Holy Spirit told to build the church and he said every time there came a need like electrician some electrician coming and said we'll do it for free she there's nothing wrong with building a church as long as you're led by the Holy Spirit as long as you're seeking first the kingdom of God everything else you need will be added unto you and they've had numerous people healed from cancer and different things inside that new sanctuary because it was prophetic because they're seeking God first that's what we got to do seek God first and everything else will be added unto us but who wants to seek God and like on this level and just be just obey every word I just want to pay my tithes every time I just want to pray I just want to get in the spirit before every service I just want to love God I just want to pull on the word of God every time I just want to be faithful how many people want to do that oh my so few so few but that's what Jesus Christ modeled for those 18 years just submission the man said the pastor asked you to do something he said you should do it praise God right so the last picture we get or the first picture we get is he's correcting his mom and dad in the temple 18 years later he submits increases next picture we get he's submitting to baptism although he didn't need to be himself but for sin he needed to be for the type of the Lamb or the sacrifice being washed so again where do we always find Christ submitting to the things of God he said I do nothing except the father shows me by vision he obeyed he submitted to every vision and it shook him to the core in the garden Gethsemane that last vision I've got he saw the cross he saw it and it shook him to his core till he bled from his forehead trying to get the to bring his body into subjection but look this is here it is if you obeying all the other things you obeying the last thing amen if you can submit to daily serve him all through the quiet years then when the major decision of your life comes you'll submit to that hey man did you know there's a lot of quiet years in Daniels life let's close with this I'll close to this I hope you can see that by God's grace every silent year was valuable because it's again learning to submit learning to humble myself learning not to rebel but learning to obey how many people like getting on streaks like you get on a roll how many like getting on streaks I've done that I can show you I've been on the I bet on this app I've done this app 700 some days in a row I just take little quizzes to help me like math quizzes to keep me sharp I love getting on streaks but you know what streak I want to get on longer it's praying in my closet reading my Bible every day I'm pretty proud of myself you know when I'm sick I can get on there and do my math problems and stay sharp maybe you call me sharp I don't know if I'd be called sharp or not but see everyday Jesus without fail submitted to the Word of God all those years and would it increase greater obedience greater wisdom greater strength praise God it's the compound power of obedience and submission to God's will for your life praise God Daniel no you have to turn there but Daniel I'll close with this Daniel had many silent years we don't hear much about him I'm taking you sure's dates here Daniel was thrown in the lion's den in BC 537 and God delivered him in 537 it wasn't until 5 55 BC hopes this jumps around here sorry this jumps around here ok wait by 30 ok ok ok I'm Adi got my numbers mixed up but looks like it was 555 BC he was in the lion's den oh yeah these numbers okay so maybe Daniels not in chronological order I was a little mistaken on that but the point I'm trying to make sorry the point I'm trying to make is at the end of Daniel the last words he writes are an ad I'm sorry BC 534 so 21 years later the Bible doesn't record all of his life but you know what he was doing all those years he was praying 3 times a day God delivered him from the lines and he didn't say ok I've arrived I don't have to pray anymore no he kept praying and the Bible picks it up in Daniel chapter 10 for the amen he's fastened for three weeks he's saying God show me what's gonna happen to my people do you see this even though he had victory over lions it didn't give him any self sufficiency in fact his miracle made him more hungry to see miracle in the lives of other Jews amen glory the more God did for him the more he wanted to see God moving his people praise God and that's how it'll be for you the more you see God move in your life the more you want to see God move in everyone else's life so we get silence for 21 years where's Daniel where what's it all about and we pick him up glory the Bible says in the first year of Darius he said even I stood to confirm and strengthen him and then he gets these visions Church he gets visions of the Antichrist a little horn he gets the visions - is so beautiful he gets the visions of the leopard and the bear because he's so hungry God what's gonna happen to my people why are we in Babylon he's so faithfully pranks he was building praise God he's as more as he was he was faithful every day it kept building he got growing wisdom and by the end of his life with amen he was praying interceding for others eternal life had taken over eternal life he was living for the Jews so he sacrificed three weeks of eating fancy foods saying God what's gonna happen your people and God sent the angel down to show him and then he saw Daniel seventy weeks he in Daniel 7 he saw mercy he saw the white throne judgment hey man how do ya God showed him things to come because he faithfully submitted to the Holy Spirit every day I'll pray three times a day I will obey the word I won't eat the Kings meat because he was faithful all that time and in subjection God showed him great things that I'll encourage us to be faithful unto God and if we're faithful unto God God's gonna show us great things do there's a lot of quiet years in his life but they weren't quiet he was busy contact in heaven so much that the angel come down and said Daniel you're greatly beloved in heaven heaven knew him all those years because he'd offer all the faithful prayers of the Saints uh-huh he was so burned first people at the end of his life see what he was doing church he was inquiring of the Lord what did David what he wanted the ark so he could inquire of the Lord and God answered the more you submit to the Holy Spirit the more questions you're gonna have about where you are in God's timeline and you're gonna have more of a burden to know where God's people are so as time goes on brother and sister we should be more concerned about praying are we ready for the rapture let's get all the people in for the Holy Ghost let's get everybody in because if that if it did it to Daniel right if you did that for Daniel and God show the times the Gentiles that was the beginning right if God showed in the beginning what about the end hahahaha hey man that's the end of our feet praise God and that beautiful church is that beautiful what did he want to do he went just like David he wanted to inquire of the Lord when is the rapture Lord when is this bride when is she gonna have that last revival oh my sister I feel like if we keep praying have some more of these fasts everything we keep praying don't you think God's gonna show us and make us ready if God did it for Daniel he's gotta do for us praise God because God is not a respecter of persons now of course he does do things in his time and season but he says if you ask you shall receive if you knock shall be opened praise God let's have our musicians come by the grace of the Lord you enjoy the word tonight battling to stay in the spirit what is the battle every day submitting bringing your body under subjection to the Word of God and it will every day make you stronger stronger more obedient see because habits are spirits either you got Holy Ghost habits or you got devil habits and we all battle right we all battle that habits but we can be free from them in Jesus Christ name we've got the antidote to the snakes bite amen we've got the answer to Satan's question you'll have to live like we live before we can live victorious praise God [Music] let's bow our heads for a moment let's ask God to make us more submissive these are kind of quiet years right people leaving church getting smaller we just met through a season to rest in them other churches might be having seeds of victories and all kinds of things every church has season so that's for sure we go through battles but if we're golden bow stupid sign number please [Music] churches paralyzed come on as we bring this to pose I trust the same [Music] with Reuters lord I believe this right off of us [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music]
