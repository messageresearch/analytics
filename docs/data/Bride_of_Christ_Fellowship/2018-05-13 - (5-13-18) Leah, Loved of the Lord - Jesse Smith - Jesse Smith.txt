never die amen let's take our Bibles this morning by the grace of the Lord I think I do have a Mother's Day message I'd like to preach this morning so if you take your Bibles let's go to Genesis chapter 29 verse 16 I like to preach a little thought called Leah loved of the Lord let's look at the life of Leah this morning by the grace of the Lord it's kind of came to me this morning as I was in prayer I was planning on preaching on the book of Revelation yesterday but as I was in prayer this morning it just kind of seemed to change a little bit let's go to Genesis 29 this morning Genesis 29 verse 16 we read 16 through 18 verse 16 says and Laban had two daughters and the name of the elder was Leah and the name of the younger was Rachel Leo was tender eyed but Rachel was beautiful and well favored and Jacob loved Rachel and said I will serve these seven years for Rachel that younger daughter amen let's have a word of Prayer for you just bow our heads and if you ever need on your heart just make it known unto the Lord this morning heavenly father Lord on this Mother's Day Lord were we're grateful Lord I think about my life and how you've given me such a wonderful mother Lord who's lived what she's known Lord and father and taught me to pray Lord and I can still remember I can still hear her voice in my mind Lord about scriptures she tried to teach me to obey and honor and father I'm grateful for that Lord as your prophet taught us to be grateful Lord for the motherly love that we received O God I think of all the little girls in our church I think of all the sisters Lord and how Lord do you care for them Lord God and how you've just formed each of them Lord according to thy desire and thy will father we just ask that your great holy spirit of love Lord God would speak to us in love this morning father helping us all to love others and father as we look at Leah and Lord may be a blessing to our our souls this morning and father thank you for all your blessings bless your people through your Living Word in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless trees being seen to praise the Lord I just have one visual Malachi so we can switch over buddy when you're ready I'm not going to have many visuals I'm just going to try to use one today by the grace of the Lord I'd like to look at ice in as I said Lea loved of the Lord I don't know if you saw Wednesday but we're trying to do a postcard outreach and I got the first proof back and so yesterday I fill out the form I want to highlight this pillar fire you know more so that's what I said before we go to print I got another correction I want to highlight that pillar of fire I really like that I felt like they caught my inspiration because I wanted the people to see that the pillar fire spoken our generation I'd like a little more brother Branham too but I understand you know about that but I really want that pillar of fire to shine there and then just keep it in prayer you know all of July for our 4 p.m. services we're going to do some teachings there and I like how they have the map I thought they did a really nice job on there and some people have donated that already so thank you for the donations that's very kind to donate to that we're just using tithes and offerings and then anyone else who wants to donate anything separately and just give Akron a chance to hear the word of God I don't know how many times I prayed and cried tears for the abominations done in Akron and asking God to save what you can in this place shake Akron and and we know that God has shaken cities in the Bible and there was just a few believers that got saved so perhaps I know Akron's been shaken OS hope God shakes it again by God's grace that's that's our prayer and so they asked for a quote so I asked for a couple of the Saints to give me quotes and so I shared a couple of quotes with them and they always like to add a quote you know from a church member or something like that like a testimonial so I appreciate those people who share those with me now this morning I like to just look at this thought here we're gonna focus on you know Leah you know but we'll look at this here as I've been studying the the the I'm sorry Revelation chapter 4 in the church ages brother Branham keeps hitting on the four and twenty elders to which of course we know 12 of them were the twelve sons of Jacob and so as I was studying that I came across numerous quotes and so I'll be you know referencing this throughout the sermon Lord winning this morning but this is the order of the birth you know the first four were through Leah and then two came by Leah's I'm sorry then two came by Rachel's handmaid and then Leah had to buy her handmaid and then Leah had two more and then Rachel had the last two so I'm just gonna emphasize or I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm just gonna point to that a little bit by the grace of Lord throughout this sermon let me set my timer so I don't wear myself out I just want to rehearse a few things remember as I preach in years past I was just going through my past Mother's Day messages but the RAM said mother is so great because she's the first one that receives you in this life she's so great I'm glad my mom received me although she had three in diapers already I'm glad she's to receive me she could have said well I don't really want to receive you but she was grace you know God was gracious brother branham said if I could give any credit to Moses's character because of his God sent mother God sent mother the RAM said Moses could not have had a better teacher than his mother and as I told you you know I I can still hear my mother saying Jesse now sometimes she'd joke around and say dude you know cuz that's how we talked back then so she was trying to be a buddy to me and she say dude she'd say to whom much is given much is required all your friends are watching you you she said you can't do things like that you can't go out and party like that and you can't do that she'd say dude you know to try to make me feel like she is one of my friends and I can still hear her say the scripture God has not given us a spirit of fear but of power love and a sound mind I can still hear her faithful words there I'm grateful for that you know I did want to find one more I'm sorry I didn't want to say a few other things I was as I was looking through this the RAM said here that mothers are called to bring life into the world and that's what they're put on earth to do but said a woman when she's raised the family she's done the duty that God told her to do amen thought that was really encouraging by the grace of the Lord and I want to read this too I preached this of years ago and I forgot all about this but the random said a praying woman is the backbone of your home and the nation a praying woman so sisters see how valuable your prayers are I know your bit we know they're busy children some of them work you know we know but when the praying mother can intercede in the sight of God it provides stability for the family and I just remember preaching this a few years ago I think was two years ago she's the backbone then the man would be the head and the central nervous system but he needs the mind of Christ if she's the backbone and he's the head and we know the Bible said about you know Jezebel you know kind of moved a HAP you know and she kind of controlled the relationship but we know that it's important like that so I want to read this too I found this when I was looking up nerves the spine runs from the base of the skull to the pelvis it serves as a pillar to support the body's weight and to protect the spinal cord there's three natural curves in the spine that give it an S shape when viewed from the side these curves help the spine withstand great amounts of stress by providing a more even distribution of body weight and then it says the spine is made up of these bones stacked like blocks on top of each other to help absorb shock and load so think about how a mother protects you not only when you're in but even outward right when you're in the body but when you're out the protection of mothers prayer gives you or even a natural protection we know mothers will go to any lengths to protect their babies don't you appreciate that the love of a mother and then remember the nerves here's this one thing I thought it was striking the spinal cord the column of nerve fibers responsible for sending and receiving messages brain runs through the spinal canal it is through the spinal cord and it's branching nerves that the brain influences the rest of the body controlling movement and organ function I remember this I forgot about this till this morning as the spinal cord runs through the spinal canal it branches off into 31 pairs of nerve roots 31 pairs when then which then branch out into the nerves that travel to the rest of the body so brother Ram calls the woman the backbone here we see the spinal cord and then it's got 31 branches of nerves that pair off to these nerve roots and the Bible calls a faithful woman of proverbs 31 woman in that striking Maya that was just so good I just had to read that again so thank you for bearing with me just how God places these natural teachings right inside of our own bodies and the Bible said no man could deny there's a God because God has showed it to them through their own body amen so I hope that's a blessing there by the grace of Lord I just wanted to start with that to remind you how much God thinks of a godly mother amen so I trust if you have our set my momma text maybe I'll card hope I can call her tonight but if you haven't contacted your mom tell her how much you love her and tell her she's so great you can tell her a prophet said so mom you're so great let's look at Leah this morning I like to preach on Leah by the grace of the Lord and like I said I wasn't planning on that it just kind of come to me now before I get the Lee of course we have to start with Jacob and Jacob is outstanding character in the Bible remember he's his name means supplanter which means one who follows on another's heels he's right there on Esau's heels he's right there as that kind of competitive brother you know right there and he's second born of course of the twins of Isaac and Rebekah and it says his father was 59 and Abraham was 159 when he was born he was a man of quiet gentle disposition he wasn't the hunter he liked the life of a shepherd he was more of a shepherd type of boy Esau was the great mighty hunter the hairy man the man that was more brute and more the outdoorsman that gives me hope you know cuz I never was a hunter so that gives me some hope that God can use me and uh but remember you know before he had his change you know his wrestling with the angel he was a real deceiver as well you know supplanter and as we know and and so he used deception he and his mother use deception to gain the birthright but the birthright had at least four benefits to it first of all it was superior rank in the family like the leader of the family second it was a double portion of paternal inheritance according to Deuteronomy 21 17 you got a double portion when you were the firstborn also it makes you the priest of the family interceding for your family to God and that's in Deuteronomy I'm sorry numbers 8 17 through 19 you became the spiritual leader so not only natural leader take care of natural things but you also were the one that would intercede for your family that's what God expected I have a firstborn and lastly which was the most important one when you were the but when you had the birthright the promise of the seed of Abraham which would bless all nations would come through you so we don't know exactly why Jacob did this remember he was in and we'd say his unconverted her unsanctified state but he was basically saying I want all these benefits I want the blessings of God and we found out that later it was all ordained of God because II thought Esau thought more of natural blessings than he did of spiritual blessings it was more interested in taking care of his flesh and and enjoying a easier life for having the the the needs of life natural needs rather than the spiritual needs and church if we're not careful we'll get caught up in the same thing where our lives or if people watch our lives it only speaks of natural things natural things every every decision is a natural natural need whereas every decision should be a spiritual need taking the Word of God first and then of course that will lead to natural needs being met because we seek the kingdom of God first then everything else is added unto us we wait upon the Lord John and I were talking yesterday and a hasty man tries to just make things happen himself without following the Word of God and nervous and and trying to quickly solve things we're but a patient man or woman they'll take it to God first and go to God in prayer first and it's hard but it's a sacrifice and we're commanded to be living sacrifices we got to make sure we don't take ourselves off the altar of God where we don't crucify our flesh and that's one thing about living sacrifice it can squirm off the altar right but we've got to be a living sacrifice that stays at the altar of God that we'll die every day and we'll crucify the lust of inflexion affectional us every day every service you're saying god help me to slay and crucify the lusts of my flesh now I'll jump off this service I don't have to pay attention this service or I'd have to apply it to me brother Jesse is really only preaching to mothers today though he's preaching to all of us because God preaching to all of us God wants to feed all of his sheep this morning not just well maybe the female sheep can have all the good grafts and all the male sheep don't have to they they can just go you don't have the leftovers you know God wants all of his sheep to be fed this morning that's exactly right so whatever it was no doubt even though Jacob was it in a real we'd say sanctified spot there was something in him that wanted this birthright and that we know it was more than the natural because later he became a very spiritual man and became one of the three patriarchs right Abraham Isaac and Jacob so there was something down inside of him that God saw God looked down and said I love him but I hate Esau I love Jacob because Jacob even in a state like that was willing to have a fellowship or association with me he wanted my blessing he wanted my influence he wanted my name to be connected to his name more than anything else and he was willing to do anything to get it amen now of course everything evil he did he got paid he got paid back for all the mischief he did mischief was done to him as well so we know that that whatever we reap we sow but behind all of that was a heart that loved God so much so as he was leaving you know his family he prayed and and God showed him a ladder right and and he saw angels ascending and descending and he said surely God is in this place and he said because you're with me God surely I'll give you a tenth of everything that I own amen everything that's given to me because I know God is with me in the myths and yet of his trials in the midst of his trials or when we say his own personal sins and shortcomings God was with him now soon after he stole these blessings the two blessings Jacob became conscious of his guilt and he was afraid of the anger of Esau who was going to kill him he'll ever we know he was going to murder his brother mine and then he left to Haran which was four hundred miles away to find a wife how many miles would you run if somebody wanted to kill you he said I'm leaving four hundred miles away and he didn't have a car to do it he couldn't jump on the Greyhound four hundred miles he was driven a church I said like this he was driven by the Holy Spirit because there was a wife out there praise God wives we know in this case which God's not in polygamy now but there's wives out there there was a family God was trying to establish a godly family remember this is not long after the flood and Babel and God wants to establish a people that will be kingdom of priests unto Him amen he's had servants you know Enoch and and different ones and Adam and and and all all the descendants that is descendants of of Seth and all these a sentence he's had faithful servants Noah but he wants to establish a kingdom a kingdom that's in order a kingdom that approaches God a kingdom that knows his word amen and so this is the beginning of God wanting to build this king of this this natural nation we'd say and so God is sending him out there even the midst of his trial God is using his shortcomings and weaknesses to bring about the per will of God amen 400 miles alright and there you know he meets Rachel and Rachel has the same type of character as Rebecca because we remember Rebecca was the one who just watered the camels in here Rachel helps helps him with the Sheep and he helps roll away the stone you know to help Rachel and we see the same type of sacrificial love between these real believers this this helpful this eternal life characteristics where we're able to help those in need we're led of the Spirit of God to offer help we want to be a blessing to others we want our life to count not hurting others about helping others we don't want to take from others we want to give to others we want people after leaving our presidents to say my I was blessed to be around them I wasn't felt like I was I lost my dignity or I lost my my sense of the Holy Spirit but they added something godly to my life amen that's what we want to do church we want to add value to people's lives and so we see the same attribute in Jacob and Rachel and Rebecca willing to help Anne and God answer their prayers praise the Lord now look at this let's go back to our text Genesis 29 most of us know the story pretty well but I just want to bring out some of these thoughts on Leah love to the Lord and we'll try to look at this by the grace of the one I don't think I've ever preached on Leah as far as I know I could be wrong but Genesis 29 our text verse 15 and Laban said unto Jacob because thou art my brother should us now therefore serve me not tell me what shall I wages be and Laban had two daughters the name of the elder was Leah and the name of the younger was Rachel leah was tender eyed but Rachel was beautiful and well favored and Jacob loved Rachel and said I will serve these seven years for Rachel thy younger daughter now we're given you know all these descriptions here we just want to make sure we we note them here some of us of course we're from with this but Jacob you know he he needs some work and God provides him work when a man needs work God will provide work for him let me know that a man he's Jehovah Jireh hallelujah but we see Leah you know she was the oldest of the girls you know and she wasn't as pretty as Rachel she had younger sisters that were pretty you know Rachel was prettier tender I'd you know some I read a few commentaries and maybe her eyes were weak or maybe she had trouble with her eyes or means more delicate maybe she was more sensitive there was something about Leah you know that she just wasn't as pretty wasn't as well favored may seem like maybe she had a physical problem or something with their eyes and something like that but she was the oldest but yet wasn't the prettiest and so everybody knows that because Rachel had all the favor in the family all the siblings would say well Rachel's the golden child Rachel's the the mom and dad's favorite and everybody kind of knew that in town you know they'd say oh there's there's the there's laymen's family oh there's Rachel look how pretty she is well she's so pretty remember God's not interested so much and who's the prettiest or the strongest or most handsome God wants a heart that is hungry for to know the heart of God that's what God is most concerned about you know one of my siblings always gave me a hard time and said well Jesse's the golden child of the family you know and I've never claimed that and I think I hope there was no bitterness in those statements but you know it was just it was just the favor of God on my family and and God giving us grace and different gifts and whatever gifts were given we've just got to give it to Christ and God no matter no matter what the no matter what we're gifted naturally whether we're more favored or not one thing temptation is common to every man no matter how strong or handsome or pretty you are we've all got to go through the same types of temptations and we've all got to overcome by the grace of God and you have to remember you're not the only one who's gone through this you are not alone there's someone like you who's gone through the same situation that you went through you say well I don't know anybody it doesn't matter remember with the Queen of Sheba God can go back a thousand years and pull up somebody from a thousand years ago it said they went through the exact same thing you did and you've got to honor God despite your situation in other words you've got to take courage from those who have done it you've got to remember there's no excuses God offers us the Bible says in 2nd Peter chapter 1 God has given us all things that pertain to life and godliness amen everything we need to live in this world and to be godly and overcome the trials that have been placed before us everything we have need of has already been given to us but we've got to receive it hallelujah we've just got to receive it that's what we have to do and so Lia maybe she had a rough start to life maybe you know what her name means wearied weary so when her mother birthd her she was weary because that's that's the whole pattern of all Rachel's children and lia whatever they were feeling at that moment that's what they named them so maybe it was a long labor I don't know what it was any of the pregnant mothers weary I know my wife's getting there they all get that way at the end right they just can't I remember they owe me just saying I can't wait till the baby comes I can't wait and the baby finally got here and then the Bible said we rejoiced for joy that a child's were brought into the world but from her beginning she was known as the wearied one what a beginning this child has been a burden this child didn't come in with all the celebration this baby is pretty but not as pretty as the other one that we had look how beautiful ray chose you got the baby pictures up on the wall ones real beautiful you know maybe another one's not so pretty something about or tender I just wasn't just wasn't as beautiful as Rachel and church we want to we want to relate to that because I think we can all relate to that well there's more pretty women than me there's more handsome men than me right we could all relate to that there's families that seem that they just got it better off than we do praise the Lord there's churches that they just got it better off than we do churches have bigger buildings than we do where churches that have much better pastors than we do or a pastor you know I'm just gonna keeping it light you know we can all in all ways we can all make excuses have hurt someone's got better than me well I just had a harder than everybody else my life so hard God wasn't interested in letting Leah feel that way but her trials did play a big part in her spiritual life now and as we go through this message just think about this think about who seems more spiritual as we go through these scriptures about Leah and Rachel who seems more spiritual is it the beautiful one and everybody loved and all she's just the queen all the guys would like to court her or is it this Leah this kind of misfit rejected woman who seems more spiritual and we know God is not a respecter of persons so God didn't care if Rachel was more beautiful or Leah was more beautiful God didn't care what God wanted was for them to submit to his word for their lives that's what that's what he always wants and so she was tender eyed Rachel beautiful well favored now if you know the scripture Jacob was fifty years old when he tried to marry Rachel but he got tricked fifty Esau got married at 40 remember he married the pagan women and so the Bible said it grieved the spirit of Isaac and Rebekah Oh our children didn't marry in the message my or my son didn't marry in the message they just grieve them because they knew whatever you surround yourself with that's what you're going to become unless God reaches down there and someone cries out to God they're going to become the the atmosphere that they create themselves and we have no excuse right because we are miniature mini creators we've got to create the atmosphere by the power of the Holy Spirit by casting down imaginations and anything that exalts itself against the Word of God we must create that atmosphere amen fifty years old and you also see a lot of God's grace in here God's grace to Jacob as well because although God loved Jacob Jacob was not always a good man he was pretty pretty disagreeable man sometimes just like us we can all look at our flesh and say oh what a wretched just like Paul said what a wretched man am I how many can say amen to that there's times I feel like a wretched person there's times I don't feel like I'm gonna make the rapture there's times I feel like how can I even be a Christian for the Bramson there were times like that he didn't feel like a Christian right there's times we don't feel necessarily like that because we get in the flesh and Satan tricks us sir we willingly disobey against God but see the thing about a Christian is that they go back to the throne of God and the Bible said their spirits are renewed day by day and the brother was asking me overseas from Africa he said he said can the Holy Ghost to a person sin and I said of course but they will not stay as long as someone who doesn't have the Holy Ghost and they will not go as far as someone who has the Holy Ghost and he said praise God after he wrote me those words he said I went out in the wilderness seeking God he says our weeping cry he said the Holy Ghost fell on me out there after you gave me those words so I thought glory somebody's gonna get the Holy Ghost through this word whether I hope it's here too as well amen but we want it everywhere we want all God's children to be birthed to life amen so we're thankful by the grace of the Lord so he wants he said I'd like to really marry Rachel and Laban tricks him and says of course you can and then on the wedding night you know we know there's the switch and and Laban takes Leah and puts a veil on her and and can you imagine the morning in Genesis 29 25 and it came to pass in that morning behold it was Leah and he said to Laban what is this thou hast done unto me did I not serve thee for Rachel where for then hast thou beguiled me now put yourself in Lea's situation she's kind of forced into this and of course she loved Jacob the Bible said she did love Jacob godly man like that and here they have their wedding night and the very first thing in the morning can you imagine husband or spouse can you imagine this what what a what a honeymoon this might have been nah he storms out and said what what do you mean and then she's just left there all alone in church I said I just for seven years she feels all alone and many years beyond that she felt all alone not only did she feel alone we're gonna look in the scripture she felt hated what's the greatest day of your life sisters today get married right I had our children at school right when does mom look pretty and they all wrote all that in her wedding pictures you know or whatever or when they go to church you know think about you feel the most pretty on your wedding day and then the next day your husband walks out I didn't want to marry her she's not the one I wanted can you imagine that and yet God still look down and Leah and loved her God let her go through this because it was going to produce something later on in her because the footsteps of the righteous are ordered of the Lord God saw something in Leah that maybe Leah didn't even see inside of herself there was a character in here there was such a spiritual godly character remember God will not give you a test that you cannot overcome amen so God knew Leah could go through a test of being alone and hated but she would overcome it by the grace of God amen the church if you feel alone or if you feel hated or rejected there's hope for you if there's hope for Leah there's hope for you and I this morning amen because God is the same God and he she wasn't you know being mistreated by a young man he was fifty years old I hope I got some wisdom by the time I'm 50 you know I believe I do but you know just think about that he's a fifty year old man it's gonna be a patriarch can all these things his grandfather was Abraham yet Abraham's grandson hates me think about the mind battles the devil would bring in there the father of the faith his grandson hates you think of all the lies Satan could whisper and what's happened to keep doing cast it down cast it down she had to been a woman of Prayer by when we see that because of how she names her children later on she had to been a tremendous prayer warrior and now we know how it goes in the scripture the custom was layman said well no the custom is I can't break the customs you know I got all these customs why he said I got to give the oldest first he said work seven more years and so he fulfills Rachel's week as well now think about this Leah had him for seven years we'd say but the whole time he's gotten googly eyes looking over at Rachel the Bible said it just seemed like a few days to Jacob so she's like come on hubby let's go to let's go to bed all right let's go let's go to our home and she's he's out there on the rake you know working out there oh she's beautiful and he comes in and he's off I'll be marrying Rachel pretty soon imaginet see Satan could have used that to drive her to hate Jacob but instead God in His grace allowed her to become a prayer warrior think about that how would it feel to be the unloved wife or what's it like this maybe the unloved child maybe Rachel got more love even from her parents we don't know but she was well favored more beautiful more attention so she knew already as these first seven years before Rachel came you know as part of the family she knew I'm the unloved wife and church that proves sometimes women suffer from feeling unloved and you have to forgive me every year I buy the mother's flowers and I forgot yesterday so forgive me so Connie I'm sorry those you've been here a few years I've given your roses you know so forgive me I just forgot but I didn't have time this morning so ah maybe next week maybe next year we'll see I can get to it by like you know on the holidays like to give the children gifts you know and just let them know we appreciate them mothers we appreciate you but you know women suffer from being unloved and sometimes they're victims of unhappy marriages and it's not even their fault this was not Leah's fault it's not fault she it's not her fault she was tender eyed or if this was a birth defect or whatever this was that's not her fault she was a godly woman and it wasn't her fault but this is a the situation allowed her to have a test or trial that seemed like like like Satan may overcome her but she had a choice do I stay with the Word of God or do I just trust my feelings thank God she didn't trust those feelings amen thank God she didn't trust the wretched woman that was inside of her that sin nature thank God she still feared the Lord amen so sometimes brothers there's things that happened it's not your fault but you're an awful situation maybe marriage family sisters sometimes it's not your fault but you're an awful situation and that's how Leah was she's an example of that we're never given any reason to believe that she was not faithful to God she just wasn't as pretty this wasn't as maybe favored as Rachel and so first the first seven years she just I just want him to love me I just want him to think about me I just want him to I just want to feel loved now let's go to Genesis 29 let's go back there by the grace of Lord to read a few more scriptures here and this proves got to let you go through very long silent seasons so how many think um seven years was easy on Leah do you think that first seven years before you married Rachel I think that was easy on her probably not look at verse 31 says 29 31 and when the Lord saw that leah was hated he opened her womb but Rachel was barren my god there's God and his fatherly love he said Leah that's my daughter down there she's been hated for 7 years can you imagine me and hated and rejected for 7 years by the one who's supposed to love you sometimes life is very difficult or we remember God sometimes lets us go through testings of seasons to produce something godly within us and we've just got to go through that situation we've just got to trust even though I don't feel him I know he's there but like we preached a few weeks ago the tests of life was that last Sunday night the test of life sometimes God like job said I go forward he's not there I step back he's not there I go to my right he's not there job said I go to my left he's not there he said he's hid his face from me but he said the Lord knows my steps amen he might hide his anointing he might hide as his voice or that spiritual intimacy that you desire but church you've got to know he's right there with you hallelujah so God sees his little daughter being hated isn't it striking Jacob have I loved Esau have I hated Jacob was loved but then in his flesh he hated his own wife loved by God hated his own wife for awhile there's no there's no doubt he could not have hated her and then saying because Jesus tells us later what is the spirit of hatred Jesus says if you hate somebody without a cause to murder let me know that that's what Jesus says if you hate somebody with no cause you just murdered them so Jacob at some point would have got delivered from that and so see he developed a hatred for Leah why was I given her I didn't even work for her never wanted her in the first place a man loved by God caught up in hate now a church member that's four before the baptism of the holy ghost if we hate each other here that's that's no excuse we've got more power available than Jacob had and the church said we've got much more power praise God we've got living power we've got life-changing power we've got resurrection power amen hallelujah there's no excuses today remember every promise of life and godliness is given to us it's exactly right that was verse twenty and thirty one God how do you God saw God saw how me know God sees you in the midst of your hard seasons aren't you glad God sees you the Bible says his eyes run to and fro upon the whole face of the earth God is watching over us today God is watching over you today you're never out of his sight Church let's say praise the Lord can we say that praise the Lord he were never out of his sight he's always watching us even seven years of being hated 7 years of being rejected 7 years of being the misfit and what 17 complete she was completely rejected completely hated a whole season of her life 7 years a week rejected so God said I'm gonna open your womb I'm gonna bless you with children but the Bible said Rachel was barren let's go to verse 32 so it would seem like after seven years of praying and being in the valley of decision and being hated and battling Satan and all these things God here's God Caesar God answers verse 32 and Leah conceived embarrassed son and she called his name Reuben Reuben means behold a son for she said surely the Lord have looked upon my affliction now therefore my husband will love me so now we know what she's been battling or at least some time but part of the seven years I've been afflicted how she been afflicted a husband that doesn't love her she's been tormented right that's that's many of the torments we have in America we're not physically tormented people aren't hunting us down we know it may happen later but see Church the things we go through many times are an affliction it's a test it's a trial how people treat us mistreat us it's an affliction and it's affliction we've got to overcome we've got to ask God give me that balm of Gilead so I can be healed amen it's an affliction it's a literal battle that you're going to have to ask God to give you grace to overcome de menthe and Churchill here your humble cry if he heard Leah if he heard Hagar even Hagar crying out for water for a child if he heard a Hagar and Egyptian made and then he hears Leah a rejected Israelite here if he heard them how much more will he hear you and I praise God and word of the blood of Jesus Christ hallelujah mine I also have one in these last seven years if my husband would just love me if if he would just love me now for us it might be if someone would just love me or if my children would just love me or my mother or father my husband or whoever my wife would just love me we just want loved and so God answers and said I've heard your cry I'm giving you a son and she brings forth a sudden she's behold a son everybody behold God has given me a son God has blessed me because remember in those days Society declared that a woman's prestige depended upon her success of bearing sons in other words you are not a real woman unless you had males I'm glad it's not the same way today well you were she would look me look down upon she would be disrespected all there must be a curse against you you can't pretty any sons god let's not love you and the whole time God did love her but God was taking her through the 7 years of fiery affliction to produce a christ-like character can I say like that a christ-like character so we can relate to it I want you to notice in these next few verses they're gonna go through her first four sons we've already gone through Ruben notice that God meets her needs and notice three things about her character I like this God had provided these sons in a response to her affliction and unloved condition so these are ways that God is using to encourage Leah I notice God just didn't stop after one say well one son is enough you should be happy with that look how merciful God is God keeps bringing blessing after blessing after blessing church it's undeserved but God keeps giving us blessing after her blessing we fall back into this depression we fall back into affliction we fall back into not feeling love we fall back into that and God keeps blessing us time after time we ought to praise the Lord Amen hallelujah he just keeps encouraging us we have the same thing over and over again I gotta go through this again go through that feeling again go through that mistreatment again I keep going through that God hear my prayer God is so faithful he cares for you he cares for me amen glory not just one I'll keep quiet that's not how God was just keep quiet I gave you Reuben God's like I'm still listening let me give you another well I still hear you Leah I still hear you I love you I'm letting you go through this it's gonna produce a godly character I'm doing something here Leah you won't see it your lifetime but you'll see an eternity yeah amen you'll see part of it in your lifetime but the half has not been told of what I've been doing for you amen where we saw that the rainbow on Wednesday night we just see half of the rainbow but in heaven there's a full rainbow around the throne and Branson because that's the half has not been told about what Jesus Christ has done for you and I amen glory second we see that throughout all these children she just wants to be loved there's one thing she wants in life it's not money it's not riches it's not Fame she just wants to be loved by her husband god I just want one thing if I could just have this one thing in my life and God keeps letting her struggle with this I just want my husband to love me Lord he's called to love me the you know he could go back to scripture you know Adams supposed to cleave to his wife Lord why doesn't my husband cleave to me he's a man of God say Lord I believe your word I'm trying to believe I'm trying to do everything I can I just want someone to love me hey man I'll they do you look at the second child number 33 Simeon and she conceived again and bare a son and said because the LORD hath heard that I was hated he had therefore given me this son also and she called his name Simeon which means hearing the Lord has heard me so even after one shout i've got baby reuben over here jacob and he's like what you say leah hold on I gotta go talk to Rachel would you want to come huh you want to come watch hold the babies you want to take a family photo we're gonna go down there and take a family portrait you know she's like he's like nah I just yeah thank God I just want to be with Rachel so she cries out to God God I'm not being loved god I've got this baby Reuben Lord I need you to answer my cry and so God sends her another Simeon and she says now the Lord has heard me I've asked God for this child God has given me this child see since she couldn't since she wasn't being loved in the president God was giving her children that would bless her in the future right because that's what the Bible said with when you have a property one woman your children will grow up and call you blessed and they'll praise you Reuben was really zealous for his mother Leah he did some awful things he slept with some his father's concubine because of that just to get back at Jacob her children loved her although Jacob did not so much at the beginning of course there would have had to been some kind of reconciliation at the end we know that there would have had to been in is is that is that something God has heard me I bring forth a child it's another son I know God has heard me her prayers must have been God give me another son as vindication that you hear me in the myths of me being unloved feeling alone feeling rejected being afflicted by these relationship I I constantly have I just can't get out of them give me a son to show me that you heard me and God gives her another son named Simeon hey man oh that's the God we serve amen and the whole time he's like that's nice had another son all right that's okay let me go take a vacation with Rachel or whatever you know what I mean he just gives all he's just hated her look at verse 34 and she conceived again and bare a son and said now this time my husband will be joined unto me I don't know if it happened right here I believe it happened at some point you know why cuz brother BAM said divine love the only thing that's gonna make it over there and although they couldn't received the baptism Holy Ghost they would had to have some type of reconciliation before going over there you say prove it I I'd be happy to Saul and David attend their lives they made everything right didn't they before Saul went off the scene they made everything right so eventually after years of having a murderous evil spirit on him he finally repented said David and there came a day after all those was at 14 or 7 years of chasing David there came a day when he didn't go after David anymore he'd finally buried the hatchet we'd say her offer asked for forgiveness he find that was right before God took him off the scene so this third child named Levi because I borne him three sons therefore was his name called Levi Levi means joined another word is adhesion so she's trusting Lord now that I have had three boys now my husband will cleave to me now it'll happen and we know it might not have happened right away look at verse 35 and she conceived again and bare a son and she said now well I'm sorry now will I praise the Lord therefore she called his name Judah and then left bearing now we know Judah means praise how many know that by God's grace Judah when he got older this was interesting Jude when he got older he interceded in the behalf of Joseph so that his life was spared so look at Judah the praise there he intercedes for Joseph which we know is a perfect I'm sorry almost perfect type of Christ and the Bible said yet he took a lead in the family affairs and prevailed above all his brethren the praise of God did that and that's striking the praise she finally get to the spot where now no doubt she was thankful before but now with this fourth son she just started giving God praise Thank You Jehovah hallelujah Jehovah praise be to Jehovah she just said I'm gonna praise and his name will always be praised every time they said Judah God was being praised amen every time and they said where's Judah where's Judah Oh baby Judah every time they said that God was being praised praise praise praise glory and I'll Judah came David and out of David came Christ hallelujah the Lion of the tribe of Judah glory whom all the earth Christ whom all the earth will worship with praise the very object of all praise comes out of Judah oh my that's beautiful glorious go to verse chapter 30 verse five and six now Rachel enemies lead us so much she felt like she could die because she wanted a child so badly and Jacobs like oh my god that I can give you a child that's how desperate she was the very one that loved he loved her so well we got because of her own God closing her womb and and she accuses him yet you're the one not giving me the child and Jacobs like it's God these things are done in God's time not our time so Rachel gives her made Billa which means troubled and it definitely caused a lot of trouble he gave or she gave her to Jacob and brought forth Dan and Naphtali now look at the way she names the children compared to Leah she names Dan where God has judged me or vindicated me so she want to be vindicated in front of Leah and then Naphtali means prevailed so she felt now I've won over Leah because there was constant arguing between them and bickering now so far based upon the names who seems more spiritual now Leah's praying to God interceding Xand God remember me I'll praise your name you know she wears rachel says I feel vindicated I prevailed over my sister oh my interesting now you know the story Leah took Zilpah to maid in verse 9 and gave her Jacob to life and she brings forth gad a troupe named gad and then in verse 12 and 13 comes forth Ashur so four from Leah and then two from Leah's made we've already got the two from Rachel so we're getting pretty pretty big family now I was like to take care of all those children run around the house I'd like that look at that go down to verse 22 here and God Rachel and God hearkened to her and opened her womb so God lets for children from Leah - from the maid - from another maid so now she's witnessed what 8 and Rachel's like when is it my turn Lord when am I gonna be blessed and God let her go through this all these heartache and all this wandering in trials and God finally Harkins - Rachel opens our womb and she conceived and bare a son and said God hath taken away my reproach and she called his name Joseph hey men and said the Lord should add to me another son see how that Holy Spirit's right there that the Lord is prophetic now she said oh I'm gonna have one more I wonder if she was like a prophetess and Saul visions but somehow she knew I'm gonna have one more I've had Joseph I'm gonna have one more and it was prophetic to her she knew God would give her one more amen aren't you glad God remembers all of us Rachel you know she was more beautiful had all the favored whole life but God let her go through this trial being barren for all these years to produce something in her life of course to be more godlike to be more humble to learn to pray to learn to wait upon the Lord isn't that many times what God is just teaching us to do just the weight upon his timing and it's so hard for us sometimes the weight upon guys we want to make it happen right now but these are good lessons to remind us we must wait upon the Lord God's allowed this season of affliction God has allowed this season of being mistreated God has allowed this season of loneliness or hardship God has allowed it but at the end God is going to prove to you that he's heard your prayers hallelujah absolutely so those are those first eight praise the Lord now let me get to some other ones here so Rachel now feels God has taken my approach away and the Lord will add me another son the Bible doesn't tell us whether this healed right away are not into this heal the rift no one really knows but one thing that's interesting go to Genesis 3114 one thing that's interesting is that we find these two sisters Leah and Rachel we find them in unity when it comes time for Jacob to take his family out of Haran and go back to the promised land so God has this major move lined up for Jacob he's got to move he's got to go back to the homeland it's gonna change everything about his life and you know and you would think when he would go to his two wives they'd be maybe torn right cuz they're torn on everything else they're having a rough time in the home but when he goes back to ask them they're in complete unity about going to the promised land and there was one reason why we'll get to one at least one reason why for sure I know I'll get to that just a moment Genesis 31 verse 14 through 16 and Rachel and answered incentive is there yet any portion or inheritance for us in our father's house are we not counted of him strangers for he has sold us and hath quite devoured also our money for all the riches which God have taken from our Father that is ours and our children's now then what's ever God has said unto thee do in other words God allowed the trials of their life to prepare them I'm ready to move we're ready to leave our Father because our father hasn't treated us well because we've been mistreated now God is going to relocate us to another location and we earned one Accord we're in unity about that we might not be in unity about everything else but we are in unity we need to leave this controlling man right absolutely and so that's what God was doing now think of it again how spiritual they were who you know the story they leave and Laban says by but then he chases them down because someone stole some of his God's his idols who stole the idols was it Leah or Rachel who's got the problem with little sins in her life it's Rachel right the most beautiful one remember if she's at the time of her menstrual period and all these things so she sits on the gods and he can't find him and Jacob gets all mad you chased me down and you didn't trust me and all these things in the whole time he doesn't know that his wife's got a problem with stealing his wife's got a problem with idols in her heart not only under her seat but under her heart right and you know the story Jacob goes back to Bethel and Jacob said take all the idols the necklaces the earrings remember that he said take all this jewelry he said let's bury under that oak and she gem we're going up to the house of God amen Lori he's a homecoming boy he's coming home he's returning to the land of his heritage he's returning to the promised land and he's to be fully gone to the house of God we've got to clean out all the worldly things out of our lives we want to be accepted by God this is a fresh start let's clean out our home amen and that's what Jacob does he cleans out the house we can't have this we've got to be rededicated to God and of course you know it's on this way back he meets he saw and he wrestles with God and God lets him win huh me know that he didn't overpower God some people appreciate like that all he got he beat up God come on you think he's a man could beat up God a man that can't even love his wife can meet up god man that hates his first with your wife come on you think he could its God let him win to encourage him God wanted him to wrestle God want him to know what it was like to wrestle in prayer until he got the victory he didn't want to be a wimp spiritually he wanted to know what it's like to pray through pray until I answer stay strong until you get the victory how do I know you stay faithful to me wrestle with me and I'll show you that I do answer prayer take up one to be blessed and church we want to be blessed as well amen let's hang on to God's hand hallelujah he was willing to rested to learn how to fight spiritually he wasn't much of a fighter before that but God had to make him a fighter amen how many want to be a fighter in prayer hallelujah we've gotta learn to fight these battles and we'll overcome by the grace of the Lord how many know that hallelujah I think that's just a beautiful thought there now I'm gonna bring it down to close here by the grace of the Lord yeah I got five minutes that actually worked out pretty good if you would let's go Genisys 49:29 you're probably familiar with this i didn't get to all of Leah's life there wasn't a whole lot of detail that I didn't cover but I know there's a little more I didn't get quite to that but these are the thoughts that I ended with here as I was preparing this morning Genesis 49 29 and he charged them instead of them I am to be gathered unto my people bury me with my father's in the cave that is in the field of Ephron the Hittite in the cave that is in the field of Machpelah which is before Mamre in the land of Canaan which Abraham bought with the field of Ephron the Hittite for possession of a burying-place there they buried Abraham and Sarah his wife there they buried Isaac and Rebecca his wife and there I buried Leah this is Jacob talking he's dying he said bury me back in that cave where I buried my wives now this is one thing I think quite get to hear but did you catch that church I've dinner if you read your Bible if you remember as soon as Jacob brought his family back member rachaelh on the way back rachel has Benjamin and she dies remember that and Jacobs got to change the name from son of my sorrow to I forget what Benjamin means you know brother Benjamin I'm sorry I used to have it memorized I don't have it memorized yeah that's right son of my right hand well praise the Lord brother amen hallelujah said am i right in so he has to change the name Church can you imagine me in Leah all those years and now Rachel brings forth the child and then now she's died she's off the scene this one that he loved was off the scene I wonder if God did that to humble Jacob a little bit wonder if God did that and now she lives the rest of her days she lives as the one wife of Jacob because other two are just hand mates in that interesting how life makes turn sometimes wonder why this and I'm not saying for sure but is that it the one who was unloved for all these years she out lives the one who was loved and even younger she was more younger more beautiful everything but that more beautiful one passes away and now she is the only wife of Jacob interesting how God orders the steps of the Lord of the righteous praise God aren't you glad he's ordering your steps as well amen I'm so thankful Jesus Christ has my steps in his control I want to keep yielding my steps to his control I don't want to walk one step out of the perfect will of God exactly right now program tells us in demonology he talks about he said Jacob dine died down in the egypt he said don't bury me down here take me up to palestine and bury me bury me with my father's jacob begat joseph we know the perfect type of christ and joseph was dying in egypt said don't bury my bones here take me back now into palestine with my father's and he wondered why because and then the Bible said that job said I know my redeemer lives and the last days he'll stand upon the earth and though my skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh I shall see God whom I shall see for myself my eyes shall behold and not another that God would stand on the earth and he'd see him and Abraham said if job's going to see him I am going to be buried right with him so I can see him too he said I'll bury Sarah there and brother Adam said they buried them all there for they knowed that they would be the firstfruits of the resurrection amen hallelujah and where was Leah buried this forsaken unloved afflicted woman where was she married Jacob himself buried her right there right with Rachel amen right there with Abraham right there was Sarah right there with Isaac and Rebecca right there a job amen she was part of the firstfruits hallelujah amen the Bible said many of the Saints the graves are open in many bodies of the saints which slept arose in other graves after his resurrection went to the holy city and appeared unto many the Bible never exalts Rachel above Leah if you know the Old Testament I've a couple more scriptures here let's go to Ruth chapter 4 we see a really powerful mention of Leah Ruth chapter 4 verse 11 and there's my hours I'm doing pretty good Ruth chapter 4:11 don't you love the Word of God my I could just sit and read it all day that's what's really needed right now a people that love the Word of God that will obey the Word of God hearken to the Word of God Ruth chapter 4 verse 11 before I read that brother Branham said now Boaz he had to make a public Proclamation can you redeem her and he said no then he had to make a public testimony he kicked off a shoe and throw to him and said there you are let all Israel know that I have redeemed Naomi and I also take roof I take Ruth from my bride what was it the Lord of the harvest amen there she is I redeemed Naomi and I get Ruth and Ruth will be my bride and eat brother have said what did they say may they be like Mae Mae Ruth be like Leah and Rachel in them and raise up thousands and she has that's right unto Israel may she be that way and look he made a public testimony look at verse 11 and all the people that were in the gate and the elders and said we are witnesses the Lord make the woman speaking of Ruth that has come into the house like Rachel and like Leah beautiful witch - did what fought and argued for all their married lives no God look past that God forgave them of that God knows we're just flesh remember David said God remember I'm just flesh remember I'm just a man the Lord make thee like Rachel like Leah which too did build the house of Israel and do thou worthily in Ephrata and be famous in Bethlehem so God credits not just Rachel the beautiful one God credits both of them for building the house of Israel and the Bible said how do you build a house the Bible said wisdom hath builded her house and the church said so women God has these two women women that have sisters of all things I got a lot of daughters so I'm praying God not give him these types of sibling rivalries that's why I bring him down to the altar and pray my hands on them every service I possibly can just like our son just like my mom prayed for my brothers and I that we wouldn't have these brotherly Cain and Abel situations and we have it by God's grace but these two God credits this older oldest sibling daughter and her little sister God credits these to through my strength they built the entire house of Israel amen yet leah could look could have looked at her life and said I'm just I'm neglected I'm the one that's always alone I'm one that always is lonely God doesn't even care about me but see all these things moved her to prayer God heard her prayer God gave her answers God gave her vindication after vindication at their vindication that I hear your prayers I am with you amen and God said it just wasn't Rachel it was both Rachel and Leah the Bible said through wisdom is in house builded and by understanding it is established what is real wisdom fearing the Lord hating evil and walking away from evil Leah could have easily grabbed evil and said I'm gonna do evil to Rachel because of all that Jacobs under me or she said Chris said I'm gonna do evil to Jacob because of all the ways he's mistreated me and hated me all these years but she instead chose to fear the Lord and like proverbs says the second thing do good to her husband all the days of her life because she did those two things she became a the mother and raising all these imaginal these little children running around I guess it would just be these maybe in her tent for a while eight children they're running around and she's in charge of she chose wisdom she said I'm gonna raise these children in the fear of God I'm gonna teach the little word remember the law hadn't been given yet Moses hadn't been born yet through Levi so she just had to depend on Jehovah the Spirit of God I want you to notice here this thought came to me and as I was studying this this morning these elders pray for Ruth and they say oh make her like Rachel and Leah and the scripture came to me out of fusions for that God is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that you can ask or think hey they said make her like those two that have had 12 you know 12 sons and God said I'm gonna do more than that I'm gonna give her a I'm gonna give Ruth a old bed and then a Jessie and then a David and then another that's going to come Christ and out of Christ will come for these spiritual children that will multiply as the stars of heaven God did exceedingly abundantly above all they could ask her thing for Ruth and if God did that for her what about you and I praise God amen but the thing to do is pray look at they prayed publicly and God heard that prayer in the midst of the gates we should pray three where we are praying to school pray wherever you are pray on the job get on your knees and pray then God will bless our requests we'll do more than we asked for if we just hold ourselves to his will what a legacy that leah has now she's been dead all these years and now here comes Ruth Moabite us gets brought into the fold who eventually Jesus Christ the one that her husband Jacob wanted to be a part of right she comes in here and through her submission to Naomi and the Word of God through this brings forth the Messiah what a legacy to leave that Lea did because learn to love God even when she wasn't loved amen the stand or feet they said Lord make Ruth like Rachel Adalia that they may build a house through the wisdom of God to pay evil that's what the fear of the Lord is to hate anything evil and God can build something with our lives if we just hate evil and love righteousness Matthew Henry said notice when they prayed for Ruth they pray that she Bheem might be like Rachel and Leah rather than Sarah and Rebecca for Sarah had but one son a Rebecca had one that was in the Covenant the other was Esau who was rejected but Rachel and Leah did build up the house of Israel all their children were in the church because they were heads of tribes and their offspring was numerous may she be as a flourishing fruitful faithful vine by the house side of your house the Bible says in Ezekiel glory Boaz begat obed Obed begat jesse jesse begat david and out of David comes Christ amen how merciful is our God Church God knew she was gonna be rejected God knew she was gonna feel unloved God knew she'd even be hated by her family and the one that would should love her but did God hear her prayers did God answer her request absolutely God is looking upon our hearts this morning and God wants us to know that He loves us and he's watching us no matter what season were in God wants us to know that He loves us how many know the be no hard feelings there'll be no hatred all wrongs will be made right on the other side how many know that Lia never stepped out of her position despite being hated despite being unloved she never tried to step out of her position and do something she wasn't called to do she stayed right in her position as a mother I'm gonna build these children in the wisdom of God you know the dads got to go build stuff the moms build spiritual things which one lasted longer do you think the house is Jacob they're the tents Jacob put up lasted longer or do you think the godly character that Leah put in them lasted longer the godly character always lasts longer Leah kept calling upon God and God kept answering when he was ready to answer let's just bow our heads for word of prayer here now Kai can switch over email okay what's going on back there okay thank you all right as power heads here for a moment by the grace of Lord our Lord seen Cummins being afflicted can you play Oh how He loves you with me that song just kept coming to my heart as I was preparing this morning the merciful loving God how he loved Leah she could have said oh I don't feel like this life very fair how can this be fair look at how pretty rachel is look how much she's loved by everybody in the church ever in the family loves Rachel more than me yet it taught her to be a prayer warrior it's harder to trusting God it taught her to build her life in the fear of the Lord I mean raise your hands say Lord helped me to build my life in the fear of the Lord despite my afflictions god bless those hands let's pray together pray for one another Church pray for me pray for each other Heavenly Father we love you this morning Lord God
