and I'm just going to take a little thought I had a few weeks ago I could preach on I know that I worked I want to look at it good works tonight by God's grace in Revelation chapter 2 relationship from - let me pull this around your finger grace of the Lord for look at I know that I work so leave it's 2:18 revelation 2:18 up preached a little bit on this when we went over this portion here in the thigh area church age well as I was preaching this a few weeks ago something just came to me I just had this thought come in my heart say good works but works I never did a study on good works before to kind of know about I've preached on rewards I never really looked at good work so I won't look at good works tonight by God's grace I think it will help you by the grace of the Lord tell me and let's look at this here our relation to 18 that's just read verse 19 why we just read verse 19 and then we'll read that together revelation 2:19 we get on three one two three I know that works and charity and and service and faith annihilations and thy works and thy last be more than the first let's have one more repair that need on your hearts make another to go Heavenly Father my hands up Lord my heart is up as well Lord God my head is bowed or holy reverently I come before you take this word break it to us Lord give us understanding give us encouragement if we need correction edification or God if you want to prophesy tonight Lord if whatever you have Lord just have your way Lord I was to be unit vessels more Jesus and father we're depending on you tonight over to use me as a vessel use every person here may the Holy Spirit flow through us Lord it would be conduits Lord channels of the Holy Spirit Lord you can minister to every heart and soul or those live streaming here in Ohio or perhaps around the world as we received messages about that just have that own way Lord be with us operate in Jesus Christ name Church set may God bless you can see where is God no guy if you would switch that over okay I just want to show this real quick the last month I didn't I have brought in new videos the last month so I'm working on the book of Revelation will do like a video series on the book of Revelation and so I've typed out 32 pages I'm just going to scroll down this what I've been working on the last time to teach every chapter you know that the highlights of every chapter so there's there's revelation 22 I get the themes of every chapter and then the symbols in every chapter and then the key revelations so like The Tree of Life in chapter 22 the servants at the throne the poor still conditions be that's filthy let me be filthy still the invitation of the spear in the bride just give you an idea of the warning about the contents of the book you know you don't add or take away and then I do the tightening of all the events in each chapter so I'm really excited about that I've been kind of inspired last month to do that so I got 32 pages and I just got to record them and then I got edited over the Pope and get them up my god Grasso let's not let you know that's what I've been doing in my free time I kind of give myself to that and it would be a blessing you know we're the only people Church that really understand the book of Revelation do you understand that no one else really understands and who is virgin really don't understand it the bride is the only one to understand it it's not like we're just guessing brother Brandon has told us chapter 1 2 3 and 6 are all ducks a the Lord we have enough let's say the Lord on that day men and if we could take that and then late lay that as our foundation let's take the Lord and tie everything else together that he's already preached we get the right idea and we understand that book and whoever keeps that book will be blessed Trane's God so I just want to show that with you haven't look working on that quite diligently even this week finish it up I just finish it up this morning actually when God's grace so let's look at this brother rod Malay bow from the Philippines put this new video out this week I thought it was perfect because it's what we had a preaching on Christ remember in Revelation 1 he's standing in the midst of the seven golden candlesticks and he's got his seven stars in his head member I told you always wanted a picture that had it all together he put it out do you understand that there's a deep colatina there's a deeper respond man I just thought that was just this week and I thanked and I said thank you brother that's what I've been looking for so thank the Lord for that so I had this song you know I want to look at good worse and there was 212 hits all the works just in the New Testament so I went through all those in the last week or two which one hit the highlights I we can't possibly read and threw a tooth out to hundred twelve full scriptures tonight and one tie myself too so I don't wear myself out just bear with me and enjoy the services Sunday they were just beautiful we need to be more dedicated lad was a vacation I can be more dedicated by God's grace but you want to be more dedicated because we know one thing God is dedicated to keeping his promise if we'll keep God's promise and do our part God will surely keep his part praise the Lord so this will you know as I was tell you this morning I came across this quote I just want to remind this to the church you know we can actually hear the voice of God tonight you can actually hear it could be a metro voice or it could be through the five hole ministry program said the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God talking about the nominal church the denominational churches it is its own mouthpiece so God is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride and church every denominational pastor person I've ever met with they always lead confound it when I share the truth because it's not my truth it's God's truth and it always confounds them like they just don't get it or they can't see it that's what the bunch of the prophets said they will be confounded through the prophet and who the bride for the voice of God will be in her now that's where a lot of people are today there a lot of people don't believe that they just say the voice of God is in brother Branham on the tapes and that's true the voice of God can speak through that but brother branham's and the voices in her not just the profit but the profit and the bride can we see that by God's grace so that's and then he quotes the scripture the spirit and the bride say come so it's not just the spirit and the Prophet but man said it's the spirit and the bride because the bride is made up of prophet and the rest of the bride so I just want to say that we should expect to hear the voice of God here tonight any time a man anointed the Holy Spirit who's consecrated gets up here to preach God's Word we should expect to hear from God amen so I'm yielding myself Lord let me be a vessel that the voice of God can speak tonight amen I know it's helpful I know it's long but God is always in simplicity a man he's always in the little things so remember we did our text here words under text now we just read 19 and just a few notes we'll look at a little bit love is the twin so charity or love is between works and faith your brother Graham said that's the right place it's the only place you should be love should be at the heart of your works and at the heart of your service to God and the thing that I might was Christ saw their increase of works over time they didn't get less dedicated to God they got more dedicated to God as we heard this as we heard this this weekend by God's grace here's a few points I want to make I'm going to review the thighs here and quote they're just like for quotes remember we're not saved by works when I saved by them but we're created for them and perform them out of love and we ought to be zealous of good works here's what I didn't get for the sisters I want to show some of the tabatha works and then the works of the sisters I have the scriptures ready and then the Titus 2 teachers I want to show that we'll probably get to that maybe next wednesday or maybe something that i want to maybe finish this up this is probably two services I think by God's grace because remember church we're going to be judged by our works and works means your business works means your deeds whatever fills your free time going to be judged by it let me know that either judge for reward or judge for eternal life or the second death or the other so for the bride she's judged and she's just given rewards for her works but the foolish virgin everybody else unbeliever make believer their judge their works are actually going to determine whether they receive eternal life or whether they're cast a lake of fire for the second death so works are very important let's give this ought to be zealous for good works so one thing the church ought to be here tonight gotta be zealous to hear about good works right and that means you're eagerly desired I just want to do something for the Lord so we'll get to that here now I read this quote a few weeks ago the scripture patience to Ted where as workmanship created in Christ Jesus unto good works which God hath ordained that we should walk in it so I put the note on there we were created in Christ unto good works that God ordained for us to walk into there's a work word to walk into there's something for us to do so I believe that God has something just special that you and I are supposed to do nobody else can do it but you praise God nobody else can do God's work for me accept me I've got to do exactly what he wants me to do God ordained it God established it God prepared it Jesse Smith has something to do the regos have something to do the Grahams have something to do the yeas have something to do every true child of God has something to do for God amen and they must do it because remember if they don't do it if we don't do the well god number what happens you become a worker of iniquity if you don't walk in God's ordained works then you're going to walk and work some addicted you're going to neglect the will of God so we'll get to that in just a moment I will just read over these four quotes again just to remind you now works will never take the place of faith in God for our salvation but works will show forth our faith already placed in him good works won't save you but they will come forth out of the same life as a fruit unto the Lord I believe in good works even if a man is not saying I do good works and do the best he can what does horrible the side of God is for men to do evil works and then say they're doing the will of the Lord that is what the bishops and folks in the hierarchy of Rome are doing member in the fourth church age they were killing maiming and doing all men oh he bore the name Lord now this first Jesus is commending his children because they were living change lives their works testify to a new spear within men saw their good works and glorified God yes sir you're a Christian you're going to do what's right your works will show that your heart is right and it won't be something you put on for you will do his will and no one but God sees you and you would do as well even if it costs you your life and then I had this scripture just reminding that God the Father sees what is in secret God sees our integrity God sees our character how much character do we have how much in Tigard do we have how dedicated are we amen the father sees our dedication praise God he sees what's in secret he said you will note that love is placed between works and service that is the right place for it because without love our works are accepted before God and neither is our service Paul speaking to the Corinthians said without love I'm nothing whatever I do is without profit lessons done in love now you can see right here that these believers worked in that nickel aiding class that then works as a means of salvation or to be admired by men they did their works out of the love of God that will shed abroad in their hearts by the Holy Ghost that's what I want to show again tonight church everyone that's not saved you know like to make believer they're only doing works to be seen of men they're not doing works to be seen of God they just want glory from other people but our works must be from the love of God within us that must be God's love motivating us to come to church to sing a special or to give to the poor give our tithes and offerings or to help out our brother and sister who's got a flat tire you know whatever we do it must be because of the love motivating us in our hearts not to be seen by men the rhythms of that love in our hearts was God's love for his own jesus said by this schulman know that you're my disciples when you have love one for another the pagans who saw their lives of early Christians that behold how they love each other and John said everyone that love is born of God they a bed lorry is the last one up for review and truly nothing instead of the increased labor of love and the other ages but in this age and the darkest of all ages they serve him more and more what a lesson that is there is no ceasing of this gracious service of love unto the Lord but rather an increasing of it that is the seeker you don't if you want to know the Christian or the secret of Christian life of course it's secret prayer but it's also increasing your love and service for God that's the secret to a Christian life let the enemy attempt to afford our service to the Lord our reply is increased service when the faith are crying in fear that is a time to shout the victory so our dedication must increase exactly what we heard on Sunday sky that is a secret don't give up don't get discourage keep doing right because of the due season you will reap if you faint enough the body says now there's two scriptures on the labor of love let me know that there's two scriptures our work must be love work must be motivated by love praise the Lord first us alone ends one verse two we give thanks to God always for you all making mention of you in our prayers you ever do that you're just crazy lord I thank you for brother so-and-so I thank you for sister so-and-so you ever done that I'm so thankful Lord that you set sister's brother Ernest on this family that's how we should feel about each other praise God remembering without ceasing your work of faith and labor of love and patience of Hope in our Lord Jesus Christ in the sight of God and our Father knowing their brethren beloved your election of God so you know that you're called of God so Paul says I thank you Lord for these Thessalonians I thank you for their labor thank you for their work and their love and he says knowing that they're called of God see when you know you're called it's easy to keep working because you've been called to do it praise God you know what they've all said you know with it that's what election means to call it I've been called to do this I've been called by God so how could I quit when God has called me to do it amen how could I give up how can I be crease the calling in my life when I know God has called me to amen you see that's what Paul said here it's a labor of love they did it because they didn't love God not because they want to be seen by man here's the second scripture for God is not one righteous to forget your work a labor of love how many feel good about death all the things you've done for God you might not seem like he got a reward yet but don't give up he's not going to forget about you face down he wrote down every prayer he wrote down every all he wrote down every fast he wrote all that down and he'll reward you praise God and the labor of love which you showed toward his name and that you have ministered to the Saints and do minister and we decide every one of you show the same diligence that's effort everybody should give the same effort to the full assurance of hope unto the end that could be not slothful or lazy but followers of them who faith and patience inherit the promises see what laziness shows laziness in a person's life and their lack of effort for God shows that they lost the vision they lost they lost the hope of the gospel they lost sight of the promise that got in our eyes off Christ and they got their eyes on the waves they even had like Peter they got their eyes in the wrong spot they'd forgotten they're calling a love that's supposed to be a labor of love remember Jesus will never forget us I want to bring this scripture because I mentioned it earlier this is the one I want to look at looking for that blessed hope and the glorious appearing of our great God and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity that's why we got to come to all the services that's we got to pray all the days that's not going to be faithful all the time because we got a lot of iniquity to get purged out of us amen if they take it takes a lifetime to purge out all the iniquity doesn't it because you're constantly over trying to battle and wrestle with this sinful nature inside of you so all iniquity not just some all iniquity all the backsliding or all the evil officer all the laziness all this thoughtfulness he wants to bias back from all that and purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works so see once here once he keeps verifying you and you're free from sin you'll be eager to do something forgot I'm you understand that if you're dirty and sin you won't want to do not forgot because you feel guilty right or you feel angry or you feel jealous or something like that but when you're pure before God you got a zeal to do something for God you feel good you feel right just like it's in your bed like in your marriage or with your parenting if you feel good towards your other wife you want to do some form you know you feel good towards your children you want to do something for them you feel good I feel good toward my class I'll do something good for my class you see that's how it is in Christ as long as we're staying pure will always be eager do something for God but if we let a little besetting sin we let the root of bitterness let a little lust or greed or anger or fear get in there then we won't want to really have a real desire to suffer God but when we're pure or we want to work for the Lord Damon that's right now the greek word means zealous it means eagerly desire of some high in other words mine I just wanna do something good for God I want Jesus to use me I want to do some for as a hobby no program said that's the evidence that you probably ought to Holy Ghost here it is 1954 I'll give you my estimation of what I think the closest thing to an evidence that a man is a Christian then anything I know you know what it is it's travail of soul a person that's always so hungry and thirsty for God amen they simply day night they just can't said it they got to do something for God amen what the other two only goes for Jessica see for the word of your day okay that's right now go little deeper once you receive the word of your day get cleaned out you want to do something for God see that and ties them perfectly you're so hungry for more of God your thirsting for more of God you always want more than honor so Stephen people going for the Lord it shows they're excellent because this is the true evidence that you are or to get you just want to do something for Diana you've seen God clean you out you've seen God take away get out of the kingdom of darkness and I are in the kingdom of light what can I do for the kingdom of light it's a brand new kingdom I love you part of this kingdom Lord give me some good works and do for this kingdom amen let me see this kingdom spread to other people praise God call fair perhaps ed they're full of love and they're just a soul travail like Carl right you just your soul travails for that versus like these other brothers on my heart you know tonight I just your soul travails for that just burn like my why don't they come back with these sisters one of these sisters come back my heart just yearns and I pray for them and I cry about them why would they come back that's a good evidence you got got inside of you that cuz he's the great Shepherd that left the 99 to go after the one praising the Bible said he that goes for sewing in tears cease sowing seeds God may these seeds come to fruition may these may be made these tracks the win souls these videos win souls write these sermons win souls whatever it is maybe some song CDs men they bless souls when you go planet I was said doubtless return again and rejoicing so whatever you plant eventually you'll rejoice over bringing him which precious shoes is that right I mean like that quote I can't even I like it it's one of the closest thing to an evidence I know hungry for souls just one do something for God man 1964 he says about the same thing and you and you're filled with the spirit here's one of the best signs I know of you're so in love with Christ and believe every word that he says to be the truth that's the evidence that you have the Holy Spirit and your lives for the joy and all my everything is different than what it used to be that's the Holy Spirit one of these days I'm going to stand that picture my sister Betty took me when I was 16 years old at my house I had all these sports posters on the wall women in bikinis but course I've come for that and that's awful that's sinful you know real wretched wicked I got my chewing tobacco sign hanging up back there that was my old life that's what I was but I tell the devil look at me now by God's grace those are my desires then look at my desires now praise God you won't find it to back up in our hops we'll have fun dirty pictures you'll find a sports letter B to get hanging all over the walls you'll find Christian posters all over the hollow you'll find a picture a brother random or the Lord Jesus Christ on the wall same day that's a Joe fine hallelujah it's exactly right now we're just going to hit a few of these by the racial or I still got about 40 minutes I just thought Lord I just want to see what what are some good scriptures on good works of the New Testament and would it inspire the church and encourage you to keep doing good amen always do good I want to look at this important point though first I remember the four classes of people never remember the first three kinds of believers program said in four classes I remember that okay so I want to focus on this one on the focus on the reprobate for a moment because I studied the scripture of the Bible the last week I really had an interesting there's just I would say like a further revelation on this so we got your Bible go to Titus one got your Bible when you light up here - 1:16 go ahead this was something that really struck me I want to I want to just note it for you because it really gets down to the heart of the good works why do you do that why do you come to church why do you go to service why you good works why do you give to this why do you do that I just want to bring this out because I've never seen it like this before Titus chapter 1 what did i do I know I'm on the wrong page okay there we go okay now I shall was one of our 15 - you're not reading Malcolm angry Liddy hey Malik I can you read 15 I just won 15 I did the pure all things are pure budgeted that are defiled I'll believe it is nothing pure but even their biting conscious is defiled okay so unbelievers nothing is pure to them before God right there they're so defiled in their mind is such an evil thoughts all the time and nothing is pure to them they're constant if I then it can you read verse 16 - every time work there's a lot in that scripture but that scripture just stood out to me as I was preparing my these reprobates number remember the opposite of everybody's like Judas you know Balaam if mrs. Locke different ones I bet the Bible said they profess that they know God remember demons believe in God right and trembled these reprobates profess to know God but in their works they deny him being abominable so they do abominable thing thing about abominations homosexuality right cross-dressing so many others I can't think of it of course lying and dishonest balance you know not treating everybody fairly it's abomination the proud and little pride is an abomination right so in their works their abominable their disobedient to the word and on to every good work reprobate now what's the remember baby unfit so when it comes to doing a good work any good work for God they're unfit to do it why because their mind is the file right they do it for any other purpose they do it for them selfishly they do it for to be seen a men they do it to be whatever you make money so our works should not deny him our works should bless him he's got an artwork should please him we should be doing them for him I just want to get you to see that that's so crucial because this is the group that's going to be deceived on the day of judgment right that's why four judges are going to be surprised you know I thought we did this Lord then we do this or didn't we do that this is the group and why how did you how how could they have known they could know that they were look at their works they never really we're ready or fix you any good work for God so thought you like that there now you know Matthew 7:21 so this is the same group these are people that did works some works for God but ultimately they were workers of iniquity doors they had varicose judas course had miracles we went out with the 70 then went out to buy two did miracles healed the sick raise the dead did all kinds of miracles so sometimes had God's anointing on them when in the lead you get the devil's anointing on them especially sold out the Lord so in other words these are the tears all their tears with this group they claim to know God this group doesn't claim to know God it's like all these your left-wing people on the news and everything they'll even claim to believe in God but this is a group that's so to see they claim to know God but they're unfit to do any good work for God because their hearts and minds of the file I think I just need to emphasize that here they profess to know him but their works deny him and they're unfit to do it any good work for God all right now I put a mark 939 let's read out I just want you to see this here this helped me to mark 1939 I'll go to the next slide here student I'm going to be down here mark 939 go ahead you and read that mark nighty-night sir thank you but you just said for Benny not where there is no man which shall do a miracle in my name that candid lately speak evil of me amen now what Jesus say nobody can lightly speak evil of me and do a miracle remember those in Matthew 7 had miracles remember they said haven't we prophesied and when we cast out devils and Jesus said I never knew you you worker of iniquity right and so what did Jesus say Jesus says you can do a miracle right but you do not lightly speak easily all the word lightly means it means quickly their miracles proved they did not likely or quickly speak evil of Jesus that's how it's hard enough tears my like my gramps said they're hard to decipher sometimes they look just like the wheat so when you start talking to it it's all good good about Jesus everything's good they send a message and they say they love Jesus because they will quickly say something wrong but they're like Balaam who went to hell we know into the prison eventually as time went on he started teaching a false doctrine it's okay to commit fornication it's okay for these men asleep with the women different things like that it's okay for Jews and many nights and Jews whatever more to sleep you know all kinds of nonsense like that he didn't do it quickly at the beginning it took a while for it to show up that's why we thank God for the test of time amen make your collection sure praise God don't just not just a fly-by-night programs that just don't serve God for a week and then try to some for God or a year we want to be faithful for decades and lifetimes ain't ahead other than good center of all the days of our life on the dunya to see someone can do a miracle and still be lost like you to surveil and we know that that's what these people are they profess to know them and right away you know quickly enough to say nice things about Jesus but if you get him down on some doctrine to get them down a little bit further and get down to the real truth of the word pretty soon you'll find itself false about that and then all these other miracles didn't mean nothing because in their heart they still had the desire for sin see that I hope that does that help by God's grace I hope that helps you are the grace of Lord open itself in the live streamers to me may be a very small crowd respect I don't want them I want them to feel like me to have to say Amen I'll say Amen sorry but I hope you understand that that's how they can do it though the workers iniquity in Matthew 7 and Balaam Judas they could do miracles and right away they would say nothing wrong you quickly say something good but give it a little time I'm getting out of doctrine and they'll show their true colors and every tribe struck me on the Sunday I was writing down I'm going to stand up came up for second service every trial will show it's in people's heart right for example get people at marriage trial let's say it's a financial trouble let's just say it's a marrow trouble and let's say let's say a husband offends a white and - the wife runs out and finds another man that trial just showed what was in her heart and she wanted another man same thing for vice versa with a woman right if the woman does wrong to the man like I know I was told by a pastor up in uh well I'm not going to say this ain't good let me just say up north far no if not just you know this part as far north another state he said there was a message Church up there and a man found a quote where brother Ram said a woman cuts your hair a man and abortion that's true he could but he cannot remarry again because the only cause for remarriage is unconfessed fornication and Evelin espouse but this pastor told me that the previous pastor this church and he said they had about 200 people coming to church but once this pastor got an evil spirit on him he he went all he want to marry another woman in the church so younger girl so here's what he did was awful uh he kept abusing his wife verbally so she would cut her hair and then when then when she did and this is a man who tames Tommy pride about it it hurt he's the follow pastor he's trying to bring the church back together and this was happened about twenty years ago he said he did that so she cut her hair and then he presented to the church and said my wife cut her hair I can put her away and I marry another and he did it looks like an 18 year old girl he was already probably 30 to 40 and then the whole church did that all these men in church except for just a few couples did that now when that show the that trial or that thing show what was in the man's heart already if show he had lust laying there the whole time right and because he didn't deal with that lust his works were in vain I hope your how many sermons he preached I don't care how much good he did it was all in vain because he was a worker of iniquity here we see that is with the church and they're down to twenty last I went on their priest for them they're down to 20 I'm going to only preach at one time I haven't been back since but they're down to 20 people made each one I purchased our 9:00 Sunday morning there's about 10 people on Saturday night there might have a 20 on a Sunday my heart but it went from like 200 or 100 or something like that all the way another 20 all because of what it Nick with 10 then people started down to the message and now brother branham endowed this and what was it right at first that pass was a real good pastor but in little time to what he did it showed that the trials show what's in people's heart in praise God just like he would stop coming to church that shows that didn't really have a hunger and love for God to begin with right like we've had like I've had you know interaction with people that have left recently and talking with them and things like that and it shows that never had love for God the first place because when you come here is not to see a man or a woman it's because you love God amen that's why you come you're here support God they made and whoever is on God's side because it's your family right if a trial comes and say let's say a trial comes in and someone stops paying their ties if it's a financial tribe what does that show it show they didn't have a trust for God in the first place because that trial show what was in the person's heart see that so the trial blush the trial showed in the pastor's life lust was still in his heart the trial people skip in charge but absent shows that in order to love and gather heart you said 90% of church will watch we love Suzy ah Donna on Wednesday night rather coming to church of a prayer meeting it shows what's in their heart they love entertainment more than gospel true they met a bi and a financial trial will show that people don't have trust they can't put that 10% or 11% in 12 whatever they do they care if they don't have enough trust in God they don't believe God's promise it shows there's unbelief there the receipt up like a breeze hope you can see that now we can go with any of them anger bitterness fear you know you can put anything in there any trial that a person fails it shows there something that still haven't overcome but how does it even God's grace and mercy that if they confess their sin it's our walk back of the light and God will purge their heart and purge them from all iniquity hey man that's right okay I've got the blessing hope that makes sense by God's grace I think it does as we get to the word now just so you know some works are not to be seen I already saw some scriptures you know there's private prayer there's private almsgiving I don't need to show that I think you government understand oh the people here I don't know how the LOB to the large one does if they go to our church I'm sure they understand but maybe newcomers in other countries listen might not but there are some works that God doesn't want anybody to see you do right but some works are to be seen right God wants to think of all the miracles Jesus did and everybody saw praise God think about st. Paul all the miracles he did think about all the Americans brother Brandon there's some things God does want you to do in front of people so that they will see the glory of God and then give God Bowl and it don't always have to be married you can just be any kindness it can be any act of Christianity remember we have to do it so not so people see us no they're going to see us but to do it because it's the right thing to do and Christ Christ is our motivation for it so some works are to be seen this is Matthew 5:16 remember brother Clemente Aran's preached on that I'm the older gentleman who's going to Philippines he preached let your light so shine before men member that they might see your good works so one case Jesus says don't let people see the words in other cases like let people see your works season you got you have that with good work some of that he wants you to show them that you live the life in front of people the others he said keep this private between you and I remember Church sometimes God wants us to pray in public you know never when Paul went to Lydia Paul went to Lydia and they were praying by River I would pop you know there's public you know they're they're not under roof they're just praying out there and Paul goes and joins them for each of Evan she might sum over to the house and gets a get baptized you know Peter and John were going down to pray the gate of beautiful and they saw the paralyzing Edison such as I have yet ID right they're going to pray publicly there so there is a place for public prayer here to church we got to make sure we're praying in a humble way and we're praying not to have a long prayer you know to make myself look good or DC or make myself look good on YouTube or stuff like that this is just a free honest sincere heart thanks John to contact God amen so I'm gonna teach you a whole sermon about this on September 3rd 1961 called let your light so shine before men and here's the basic thought here's his main thought we are God's advertising billboard brother Graham said now how you feel okay buddy go once you go talk to mommy look it's okay if you don't have to put it let me get some water who see mama he wasn't dealing with you sweetie I don't want to pass enough media now we do have the bracelet no doubt about that if you get some water if you look better so this message whether grabbing luck like it too unto a billboard you see billboards always charge don't in most of you hate something you like but brig Anderson we are God's advertising billboard that's what you and I are you talk about letting your light shine our advertisement events it will only take effect on those who are in need of what we're reflecting and he gives the example he said he was driving somewheres all sides and said hungry with a question mark the bet is that that side is only going to take effect on those who are hungry other people you don't go past after the pesticide they'll pass the restaurant never deal I don't need that I'm gonna have the same said the same thing is true in other words they must be hungry and thirsting after righteousness in order for your side to have effect on a man and row Graham said advertising is very effective and realize that that's what God does with us God it's very effective using us as I've imagined and how did so much so they'll race up these billboards on the Dan judgments and outlet this week oh that this way Justin Krishna this wing will be God's advertise with God's evidence and somebody could that this work amen amen somebody can live it somebody can be a real billboard for Christ am Adam and that's this whole point of the whole sermon I just point out two quotes for you I think you like one of the beginning one at the end he said I believe the Christian is God's billboard I believe each one of us is God's billboard and we don't have to do so much carrying on about I'll look at I did see that's the first we'll get to that moose Pharisee said oh I give my time I give my offerings and I do I fast three times a week enough and they brag about in front of everybody I'm dr. so-and-so and I don't do this my medicines don't carry on about you worse just simply live such a life that will make people hungry the about any man so you don't carry around about what you do if you ask me yeah the honestly I didn't happen I was God's grace I was God's mercy the man is closed by saying you're the son of the earth if the salt has lost its taking over where we shall it be salted that's right hungry thirsty let your light so shine before men that they see your good works see what you do and glorify the father what's in heaven hungry signboards reflecting wonderful yes sir so see we're like a billboard reflected we must reflect Christ put something on our life he writes his word upon our hearts amen he writes it there and then we're supposed to reflect that to other people that they see the good works of God that help by God's grace amen that's what good works are good works many of our good works are to be seen by men is listen church if you don't do a good work around people you'll probably end up cine right or compromising you have to stand there we have to stand there and do the good thing do the right thing here's where we get in trouble people start hating us like I've had people hate me or unfriend me and not talk to me I had co-workers they won't even look at me when they want they used to be so friendly to me they found out when I preached on YouTube they don't even look at me that happened this year amen that's okay because we're supposed to speak about we're supposed to speak against evil work and the Bible said when someone doesn't even work you go and tell them alone and if they hear thee get your brother if I was at Cain slew Abel because it works for evil enables a righteous see our life is such a rebuke to sinners here's what here's where Jesus says it plainly the world cannot hate you but it Meah Edythe because I testify of it that the works there other evil that's what hated Jesus he told them their works were evil any minute so see us when we preach out things and people leave let them leave it shows they hate us right they hate the word because the word will always expose sin then there will be no sin into that holy city Alleluia man nothing nothing that defiles nothing abominable no thieves don't liars no nothing like that it'll be a pure holy city and all the works will be holy man let's see that's why the eighty Jesus he always told what was wrong what was right and Jesus said if he said they'll hate neither I hate you you should be hated of all men for my name's sake hey but he that endureth to the end shall be saved and we could endure being hated and we get a doer being rejected if we can endure you know bearing the reproach of Christ we shall be saved how did it again what are the best againa I'm almost done here like I said I'm not going to get to all these what I'm gonna do is I'm going to flip through these and we'll just hit the highlights the things I think the most beneficial got about twenty minutes okay here's four of them John the Baptist heard the works of Jesus so John the Baptist sitting are you the Messiah or should we look for another jesus said go tell them about the words see your works prove what kind of person you are praise God I served mother never said this vegan respect he said Jesus didn't send John a book on how to behave yourself in prison he said he said he said of a testimony saying the blind see the dead are raised the sicker healed the main wall came head that's what he said it in prison the testimony about the power of God he then glory Jesus said the mighty works of God should have brought people to repentance but it did not so all that was left was judgment jesus said every man will be judged by his works that's because works is faith expressed so we be saved if you have paid you do the right works if you don't have faith what you have you might want to think it's even better unbelief either a faith don't believe in your soul so unbelief will produce flow equal works it is unfit unbelief is unfit for any good work but if you have faith you do the right work change time and then you'll be judged on it and I just pull this up there it was out of order because I have some more but jesus said if you these are good works that will earn people's salvation church none and it was hard it's hard for so instead that but God is so love it he will give salvation to someone who never got saved never believed in Christ maybe but they did these things to believers they visited a Christian in prison they clothed the naked Christian or someone to do to clothes they fed a hungry Christian they gave drink to a thirsty Christian and they housed a Christian who is a stranger God will give somebody eternal life for that man isn't God's grace and they see touches that disposed me way every time I read that my and they'll say when did we do this Scott we didn't see you he says when you did the least these my brother you don't undersell good works matter Church good works matter if we stole Christian is in jail you should go see him if we know Christians in the hospital we should try to go see him up and possibly can if you 23 one to seven oh yeah let's read this one yeah so I'm after 23 this is going 3 through 23 okay here's how you know you're sitting under a false preacher by God's grace I want to be true Beto I don't believe my boss that lead on true by the grace of Lord of it here's how you know verse one okay let's go to verse two the scribes and the Pharisees sit in Moses see all therefore whatsoever they bind you observe that observe and do but do not eat after their works for they say and do not that's when you know it's a false creature they say something and they don't do it right so Jesus I listen to them and take out the Bible for do what they say but don't do as they do because they say it but they don't do it for example if I say oh you should fast and pray but I never fast and pray that's hypocrite if I say oh we should come early to pray but I don't come early to pray that's immigrant right oh you should take communion but I don't take communion that's the hypocrite understand it look at verse 4 for they bind heavy burdens and grievous to be borne and lay them on men's shoulders but they themselves will not move them with one of their fingers so they put burdens on people but then they will even help the people out see that that's a false preacher this is someone who has the evil works we're not done verse 5 but all their works they do for to be seen of men they make broad their phylacteries and large the lords their garments so they won't help other people they'll tell people what to do but they won't help other people right and they love the uppermost rooms at the feast and the chief seats in the synagogues all right so see that's why but that's where the balances they only do works to be seen a minute but jesus said let your works be seen amend to see we have to be able to do things in front of men but not do it for them yeah do it for Christ amen because they want to be seen by men and yeah we want to be Jesus once men to see us but our reason for doing it has to be for Christ amen it's seeing such a see that's a fine line there he said let your light shine do good works in front of people do the right thing but don't do it for them amen you know to make to make them thing higher if you do it for Christ amen Jesus's works more witness that the father said him so see our works prove that we've gotten Jonathan takes what must we what must we do to do the work of the Son of God also the works of God I so I miss Beldon believe on the son because these signs will fall into belief Amen like that they wanted how do we do the works of God he says believe see how important faith is we just have to believe someone sick let's believe they'll get well for his job if someone struggled by edge let's believe a self about if we can amen let's put our money to it right because the Bible says if you don't help out then you don't your faith without works is dead right you really have dead faith that's right now aren't you ready John seven seven the world hates Jesus because he condemns their works I like this one the children Abraham do the works of Abraham praise God remember Abraham he believed and didn't doubt right he staggered out the promise of God Allah we made mistakes God didn't count his mistakes against him because he kept it under the blood that's what we do we confess our sins and we really we we give God glory and said we don't stagger on the promise of God we keep moving toward we keep moving toward by God's grace and John died a man was born blind that the works of God might be manifested in him praise God so see all trials don't happen because the people says I thought God just allows it so he can do good work amen John 10 believe me for the work sakes if you cannot believe my words believe me for because of the works praise God and John 14 said the father the dwell finding good the works the works that I do shall he be off a minute a minute they got for that Khalid idiot the sins of the Pharisees remained because Jesus spoke God's word unto them and did the works that no other man did so because he told them the truth now they're accountable for praise God and then because his works were greater than anybody else they'll also be held responsible for those works let's read acts 9 because I think that'll encourage the sisters acts 936 it always encourages many them to look at the life of Tabitha God thought so much of her that erase her from the dead because she was full of good works in other words she filled her time with doing good things she was doing good things all the time John after X 9 36 now there was that job a certain disciple named Tabitha which five interpretation is called dorkus this woman was full of good works and all his deeds which she did so good works which good business joy did good business and all his deeds of course are given secret giving so this is what her life was full of her life was full of doing good things for people and doing them in secret that's what our lives should be a bad look at this ah verse 39 then Peter arose and went with them when he was called they brought him into the upper chamber and all the widows stood by weeping and showing the coats and garments which Dorcas had made while she was with her so before she died like a sister Dorcas what are you doing today you know it's Monday morning oh I'm so encodes for the kids I'm making garments for the poor Christians you know well it's Tuesday you want to go over here go oh my god I got so some more where'd you find sister darkus in church and you can find her do a good works where sister Dorcas well she didn't say she said she had some secret business to take care of you know she just left and she's probably giving up the coat see that you know the Dharma's maybe she made a nice new skirt for somebody maybe she sewed a nice tie for a pastor hey maybe she did something nice you see for bastard eater you know you see that it looks like she's getting to the poor because the all's right Holmes arms are people that need them that's where her life was full up what are you doing today I'm just trying to help somebody out my god that's guy so I'm gonna do today that's what the corpus is like and then we know she was raging the day God thought so much about it not in acts 26 23 bet and do works meet for pennies so if somebody truly repents their works will show that they did repent that's right and I had three acts of repentance I'm not going to get to that tonight now that's pretty good in seconds 11:15 Paul says the end of people is based upon their works either heaven or hell is thanks upon your works what you did with what God gave you now let me find a place of closure because I got 10 minutes here um let me skip a little further here let me close with this I'm gonna skip all the way see how these there's 212 let's close let's close to here let's go let's go revelation let's close they're my customers now revelation if we want to get back our first original walk with God you got to do the first worse so however much you pray when you when you said you're on fire when I want to fire however much I prayed or studied I got to go back into the same and if I want the same experience I got to do the same work amen right guess it while I want a weary feeling of the Holy Ghost but not pray like when you've got the Holy Ghost and they could happen to that ain't gonna happen you have to do the first works if they get in condition to be refilled and be in condition to have those things come back to you if you've lost them any the first works now this is beautiful revelation 2:26 I just saw this this morning it's kind of familiar Watchers from there I'll read that revelation 2:26 one closer to this thought if we do the works of God he makes us rule over nations think of the nation United States if you do the works of God Christ promised you'll rule over a nation that's how that's how rare it is to find somebody who doesn't with of God that God has to give God if he's on the great reward I'll give you rule over a whole nation revelation 2:26 this is struggling today and he'd overcometh and keepeth my works unto the end to him will I give power over the nation's this is an estrangement right now that works out pretty good by God's grace so if they overcame Satan all devices and did the works of didn't Jesus works and not my works Jesus's words right not your works not by your your idea my idea but his idea praise God what is word says if you do that you and I do that he gives us power over the nation's now let's go to Revelation 21 now let's close of this I wonder this is what I kind of closed my script on for the next videos so I closed it kind of within Revelation 21 verse 24 relation 21 24 if we can tap into the mind of God and we can let the mind of God flow through us in our daily activities what do we fill our free tide with but we fill all of our time with if that could be the will of God he gives us a reward to rule over entire nation that's striking revelation 21 24 they didn't read 24 or 25 nations of them which are saved shall walk in the light of it and the kings of the earth it should not be shot verse 26 re and they shall bring the glory and honor of the nation's into it look at that history heads up so jesus promised this what 2,000 years ago he promised if you overcome your rule over nations in here we finally see where the reward gets given the heavenly city comes down to new jerusalem the bride is of the city and the Bible says that the nations of the saved that walk in the light the kings of those nations write their glory nada will be brought into the city amen all right look at that and that's striking and striking to me the program said about this I want to make sure I read this year hey let's do this thank you 59 and then I can prove that there is degrees in heaven that they'll not all be on the same equal I like here we have president he's highest maybe senators you know keep going maybe Supreme Court justice something you keep going down senator representative of the house he'll keep going down and you got a little little with us see right now we're on the bottom the church if we keep the Word of God it's going to flip Friday because the Bible said he'll turn the world upside down a man exactly right he turns the orders not the order of man now it's the order of God some of my being a bottom dweller down because and they're by God's grace will be at the top not because we did all works but because we did his works amen the works of God hallelujah so look it's not equal to heaven not everybody gets the same reward there's different rewards in heaven they'll not be on the same equal but you'll have equal eternal life is Jackie all because of what your works what you filled with your business what you did in your free time but the Bible said that the kings of the earth bring their honor and glory bring their honor and glory to the city that crews they'll be kings in the new earth kings and rulers jesus told his disciples what will we have after we have left father mother and I all to follow you he said barely said to you you'll set up on twelve Thrones judging the 12 tribes of Israel see it's another it's a big system that's coming up that will be our supreme to anything in that will be no more sin but yet they'll have rulers and so forth in the cities when everything will be carried on in the way of eternal life so see if we can walk in the way of eternal life now we're not going to walk in it over there but if we can rule now in your life will rule over there hit your head that's all of the Bible's that every believer is a king and a priest if we can rule over sit down we'll surely rule over others there and not that that's our motivation our motivation is the police Christ but Christ wants somebody in drop statement Christ wants to give the world blessed are the meek for what they hair of the earth Christ was to give the earth to a deep way you can trust how to do you that can be real kings and reign in righteousness amen look at 60 of ramesses and all the Earth's who come to this city Jerusalem and she'll bring the glory of it in there and the gage will not be shut by night because there's won't be any night see the gates always be open the keys to the earth relation 22 bring their honor and glory in the city but the bride is in there with the lamb oh my you see that in there not the bride isn't going to be out there laboring in the vineyards no no sir she's the bride she's the queen of the King it's the others that labor out there the nation's not the bride in that beautiful church the bride are the kings and priests and rulers they live in the city and they rule over these slavers the Bible said the earth will be full of nations now if church I don't understand that I don't it seems like the Holy Ghost filled sakes live in the city and all the foolish virgin that's Mother's Day all the foolish virgins fill up the entire earth and they're the foolish virgins the ones of the labor out there and I keep it coming out and keep the Garden of Eden right get the labor and you know what's the word here have dominion over ya dressing there to dressing Keith that's it get a dress and keep the garden well the bride will be doing that they're the kings and priests right the foolish version will be labor there and grid the glory and honor of the nation's of that these kings are over bring them into the holy city ah you like that by God's grace the jesus promised if you can overcome you will get the reward you will rule over nations none of us are going to we're not trying to that's not our desire of his eyes just to please the Lord but God wants somebody he can trust with his kingdom amen what somebody can trust with the earth so as I close here I got one min here recall the rewards this I preached us twice already I'll preach it back in 2009 and I appreciate it last year this is really small so I can you know this if you want I looked up the word reward every time that you tested it and these are rewards if you would stand persecution or endure temptation you get a reward if you give a cup of water in the name of Jesus or the name a disciple you get a reward if you receive a prophet or I just said God will reward you I don't know what the reward is other than we want eternal life that's the main reward praying and secret reward giving all of the secret you get rewarded planting and watering the gospel you're rewarded if you leave family members which many of us have right or possessions for the sake of God God rewards you for that amen if you fight the good fight keep the faith you'll be reward for you the crowd wait for you if you make a dinner for those who cannot repay you God reward you for that James wonders the scripture about pure and undefiled religion is visiting the fatherless and widow was an era fliction got a reward you for that if you love your enemies and you led to them all I just want to borrow your lawnmower arch one of borrowed 20 bucks if you lend to them and I hope you get nothing back you get a reward for that hope they don't eat it to be back on the Lord your reward that's what our hearts need to be changed to ready honestly I've got a hard time with that either lend somebody something I like to get that back but see when we're close to Christ in prayer it's different and I've had to know recently I've had to do that I've given people things out of the love of God in my heart and I don't get it back but God give me braces say that's five because when I gave it to them I gave it to them in the name of Jesus I gave it as if I was giving that to Jesus now it gives from Jesus I don't want to back a man that's good out of your love being kind to the unthankful evil get a reward for that serving God willingly get a reward heartily service to Lord anything to reward and if you diligently seek God get a reward let's stand to our feet under you this last quote when it comes down to good works the worst thing anybody can do is not try see we should all try to do we saw bush we shall try to find what works in our day to do what did God put me on this earth but I have to do what am I supposed to do we should seek God for that right now and then when you find it do with all your heart I don't know yeah amen but romance that the worst thing people can do is just not try I'm just I can do anything that's the worst thing you can let man said the Church of Christ creature told me about mr. Branum I'd rather wear out than rust out and there that's a lot of truth I'd rather wear out and not in the harness that's brother Neville said maybe they refuse to have the harness on in other words I happen I'd rather have a huge burden died if if that murder than had no burden at all like Burton to pray for people a burden to make clothes for people right a burden to give to people see kind of a burden preach to people or mr. feeble you know whatever your burden is have a burden you can't do nothing any worse he says that neglect to try so I'm going to try right we're going to try and do something Lord let us do all we can do with what you have to do with and the Holy Spirit our tutor we'll bring it to the Father here's the belt remember brother Ram said the bride has not said the Lord or she stands still we all set the show program quotes about make sure the scripture before you do it and then see if God blesses it for example when I started preaching I never heard a voice I just saw the inside poll and now now you know I get we get we get testimonies all the time about how the preaching helps people today I just hung up twelve testimonies of people that have emailed me on my wall as a reminder to keep making videos these are senators video testimonies I'll never cut my hair again I'll never wear pants again and all these things like that you know oh I want to be one of those mother amen I'm going to be rebaptised the name of Jesus Christ he thank me for that mother gives me John did you see I put him up there to remember that that's my job to do I never heard of supernatural I prayed and asked God for a sign God gave me a sign but that's what I'm saying like we can't we can't take this quote too far because we're not all prophets that see visions right but we have to ask God for a sign and God will give us the sign then we can know as I said yeah and I know your situations definite I think this would help you because that's what I need to I needed to know what God's Will was for my life so first make sure it's scriptural for you to do it and then see if God blesses it right last sighs last time remember the Bible says how will we escape damnation if we neglect this salvation see the worst thing I mentioned you can use neglect it just don't leave it look or just leave it alone oh I don't know I don't know what to do so I'm not you do anything for God know do something for guiding to good works fill your time be full of good works like gorgeous if that's all you can do is bend close and so close that's a lot that's not a little that's a lot if you spent all your time sewing clothes to give the poor people god bless you need man just doing secret then you're a modern-day dork you shave my head or your preacher then you're a modern-day Timothy amen we're not possible that we can be modern-day Timothy's honored a Titus ISM all these things like that just be what God made us to be amen see Halloween escape damnation if we don't preach the Holy Ghost gospel wonder signs miracles gives the Holy Ghost according to his a man remember that last sermon was the worst sermon what'd he do he took the tail and gaagaa he was a burden God gave him and he buried it in the earth he just left it there and the worldly things covered over his talent that's what a lot of people do today they just give their life to worldly things and we never see the towns of God their lives doing our I've should be to show forth the gifts got his place today hey man I told that stuff the Lord's night hey unless you two I appreciate you just saying I'm just God

look down at the Bride of Christ fellowship and you tell each one of us I know it's how you're working from I know your service I know your charity I know you're not for me Lord may we have a testimony like they did that our works will be works that are pleasing to you help us to do the first works of our Christian experience must be full of good works as our sister Tabitha dear God help us Lord God to overcome and do your works Lord God to give our lives for the will of God nor not that we want to rule over nations necessarily but we want your will for our lives you know and we know
