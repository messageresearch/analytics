[41:08] good seeing brother jose i heard about
[41:09] your testimony there earlier this spring
[41:11] and
[41:12] how god uh no that was yeah it was
[41:16] you and brother vang's testimony about
[41:18] how they gave him the
[41:19] healing cloth there
[41:22] i didn't know that i was i think brother
[41:24] just told me that a couple weeks ago and
[41:25] i was like what
[41:27] oh my brother just came and preached at
[41:28] our church yes fantastic testimony
[41:33] that's powerful that's that you know
[41:37] that ain't no joke
[41:39] uh so we're thankful for the lord for
[41:41] using you brother and
[41:42] you keeping the faith and applying the
[41:46] token
[41:48] anyway so that's that was exciting i
[41:51] know i just got stirred because of that
[41:52] but uh
[41:53] i'm like yeah thank you i'm not gonna
[41:55] sing a song especially thank you for the
[41:57] uh wonderful uh
[42:00] singing or music group there by god's
[42:02] grace let's just get into the word of
[42:03] god here i don't want to hold you
[42:04] keep it holding uh
[42:08] read a couple scriptures here and then
[42:09] tell a little story
[42:12] a little story uh of something in my
[42:15] life i've been dealing with here and
[42:18] because it's coming to war this thing is
[42:20] literally you think it's been raging
[42:22] before it's coming it's coming faster
[42:25] it's going to get more intense
[42:27] and you had better get your sword sharp
[42:30] amen amen if you don't have your sword
[42:33] sharp you just have to go by faith
[42:35] well what about this what about that
[42:37] well i still believe it amen
[42:39] a lot of times there might not be an
[42:41] answer for a lot of maybe let's say as
[42:43] the prophets would say thus saith the
[42:44] lord and we don't know this or we don't
[42:46] know that and
[42:48] but the word of god has an answer amen
[42:51] amen so if we could turn to hebrews 4 by
[42:54] god's grace
[42:56] um we'll get into this by god's grace
[42:59] and uh
[43:02] [Music]
[43:04] oh i'm thankful for that
[43:11] hebrews 4. i want to read this right
[43:13] from the word here
[43:20] this book of hebrews is powerful we know
[43:21] that and we know it came by inspiration
[43:23] of the holy ghost uh
[43:26] to the first messenger the prophet
[43:29] and look what he says here it's amazing
[43:31] how uh
[43:32] uh paul actually wrote this letter to
[43:34] this to the hebrews right here
[43:36] this switches to the jews right
[43:39] so notice now remember this is the first
[43:41] church age as
[43:42] the gentile church dispensation is being
[43:45] opened to the gentiles
[43:47] and it's being closed to the jews okay
[43:51] and we'll see a scripture here a little
[43:52] bit afterwards what
[43:54] why uh actually what takes place here
[43:57] um here in verse 12 it says for the word
[44:00] of god is quick and powerful and sharper
[44:02] than any two-edged sword right
[44:05] it means it's it's a weapon a mass of
[44:09] serious uh discernment
[44:12] it is an offensive uh thing we can use
[44:15] against the devil
[44:16] against uh uh maybe false brother and
[44:18] gets denomination against
[44:20] anyone that would uh challenge the word
[44:22] of god
[44:23] amen he said it is a two-wedged sword
[44:27] piercing even
[44:27] and dividing uh to the dividing asunder
[44:30] of the soul and
[44:31] spirit it goes into the spiritual realm
[44:33] into realms we don't even understand yes
[44:36] sir
[44:36] yes sir it can it can open the
[44:39] understanding of a heart or actually can
[44:41] close it if you cut it a certain way we
[44:43] know those things
[44:45] he says and to the joints of marrow and
[44:47] is a discerner
[44:48] of the thoughts and intents of the heart
[44:51] now notice
[44:52] neither is there any creature that has
[44:54] not made manifest
[44:55] in its sight so the word of god discerns
[45:00] all things yes
[45:04] is this the word of god absolutely but
[45:06] we must remember
[45:08] that this came in flesh amen and this
[45:11] deals with this the title of the sermon
[45:12] today here
[45:13] this came in flesh the word of god
[45:16] manifested it said neither is any
[45:18] creature did not manifest
[45:19] in his sight when the word of god the
[45:21] flesh came in
[45:23] nothing was closed to him he knew all
[45:27] things
[45:28] he called them what they were he spoke
[45:30] to them he knew exactly what he was
[45:32] talking about
[45:33] amen he says but all things are naked
[45:37] and open unto it unto
[45:38] unto the eyes of him with whom we have
[45:41] to do
[45:44] when jesus was on the earth he could see
[45:47] through everything
[45:48] he saw them as they were yeah
[45:51] amen now let's jump to hebrews 5. i'll
[45:54] just keep writing the same book there
[45:57] notice he's dealing with these jews
[45:58] these as the book says hebrews right
[46:03] and he's talking about the word of god
[46:05] and then now he jumps right to this
[46:07] scripture here and we'll jump right into
[46:08] verse
[46:09] uh let's jump oh sorry verse 10
[46:15] and he called he's dealing with jesus
[46:17] christ he says called of god a high
[46:19] priest
[46:19] after the order of melchizedek correct
[46:22] of whom we have many things to say and
[46:24] hard to be uttered
[46:26] seeing you are dull of hearing
[46:30] who's he he's talking to the jews he's
[46:31] saying he says your hearing's
[46:33] already getting dull yes yes
[46:36] the dolling out of their ability to hear
[46:40] the word of god and understand it
[46:42] yes mom thinks of god where are we at
[46:44] right now
[46:45] we're the closing of the gentile
[46:48] dispensation
[46:48] yes sir yes which was soon open to the
[46:51] jews
[46:52] and if this took place to the jews the
[46:54] first time
[46:55] as their door was closing would this not
[46:59] happen to the gentiles as the door is
[47:01] closing yes
[47:02] that's good you're you are he says he
[47:05] says they
[47:06] are dull of hearing
[47:10] for when for the time he ought to be
[47:13] teachers in other words
[47:14] all of us here in the house of god the
[47:16] husbands the men should be able to take
[47:18] uh those that are underneath them their
[47:21] wives children and
[47:22] teach them and prove all things
[47:26] he says you have need that one teach you
[47:28] again
[47:29] which be the first principles of the
[47:32] oracles of god
[47:34] he said guys you guys need to be
[47:35] retaught for some reason
[47:38] something's happening to you and you
[47:40] need to be re-taught do you even
[47:41] understand the first place did you
[47:42] understand the first time
[47:44] right or maybe the door is closing it's
[47:47] just getting a little too dark

[48:53] but a lot of times
[48:54] a lot i'll say this a lot of times
[48:56] things take place in my life
[48:58] prepping me for what's coming amen
[49:01] showing me what's coming and i didn't
[49:02] know it until it comes and then it
[49:04] presents itself and i'm like oh that's
[49:06] why the lord was doing this this this
[49:08] okay so here's here's the situation the
[49:10] last two months i've been teaching
[49:12] uh when i have got an opportunity to
[49:13] teach i've taught on the trail of the
[49:15] serpent okay
[49:16] and i went through it i taught a couple
[49:18] times here i taught
[49:19] back home the home church there and uh
[49:23] sure enough last week i was met with
[49:26] some challenges on
[49:27] the original sin serpent seed is it
[49:30] correct is it
[49:31] uh am i interpreting the wrong way am i
[49:34] interpreting
[49:35] literal or should i be interpreting it
[49:37] naturally or is my interpretation
[49:39] uh uh skewed or swayed uh so
[49:42] anyhow right before directly before i
[49:45] was challenged on
[49:46] this topic something took place at work
[49:51] i'm a plumber by trade we uh and i was
[49:54] given prints
[49:55] the layouts brother johnny is a
[49:56] construction man he knows and i'm sure
[49:57] these guys don't understand about prince
[49:59] and you're giving blueprints and work
[50:00] and however
[50:01] and i was looking at my prints laying
[50:02] out the dimensions to run my sanitary
[50:04] we cut the concrete i did my spraying
[50:06] and whatever to mark where i wanted to
[50:08] cut
[50:09] the excavators came in took all the
[50:11] concrete got the excavator started
[50:12] switched uh then to the hoe there and
[50:14] started digging out my trench there
[50:16] and and i was starting to plumb and i
[50:18] had to use my dimensions correct
[50:20] so i got done laying everything out uh
[50:23] um put the test on the inspector came
[50:27] looked at the gauge holding easily
[50:29] obviously 15 minutes no problem
[50:31] uh good to go he says concrete good to
[50:32] go here's your sticker boom done
[50:34] out concrete guys came in concrete the
[50:37] entire thing and i got this feeling
[50:40] something's wrong and i told the
[50:43] superintendent i said get the carpenters
[50:44] out here lay the walls out make sure i'm
[50:46] in the walls
[50:47] 10 minutes later cover is like coming to
[50:49] me i'm on a serious lift he goes
[50:51] and i'm like oh no
[50:55] he walks me over to my okay this
[50:58] uh this weekend i forgot my church shoes
[51:03] and i had three pairs of shoes and i
[51:05] forgot my true shoes
[51:08] but i chose these this pair because
[51:10] that's what i had and i chose this pair
[51:11] because of a reason
[51:13] because these are hiking trails these
[51:15] are hiking boots okay i wore these on
[51:17] mount
[51:17] mount adams uh jefferson washington
[51:20] those sort of things
[51:21] and we're going to go on the trail
[51:22] anyhow today so okay stay with me we're
[51:24] i got my hiking boots on we're going to
[51:26] trail serpent all right
[51:28] so as this carpenter came and said hey
[51:31] sorry you're off on this
[51:33] and i said what let me see your prince i
[51:34] looked at his prints i added him up on
[51:36] my calculator boom
[51:37] boom boom his dimensions sure enough i
[51:40] am one foot three
[51:41] outside the wall i am in the hallway now
[51:43] not in the mechanical room i'm in the
[51:45] hallway my mop sink
[51:46] my vent my floor drain all is walking
[51:48] right into the the
[51:50] woman's bathroom and now i have a major
[51:54] major mistake
[51:56] huge mistake this is a probably a four
[51:59] or five thousand dollar mistake
[52:01] i'm gonna cost my company and for about
[52:03] 10
[52:04] 15 minutes i was just like doing the
[52:05] numbers again doing pulling
[52:07] pulling the the the tape measure 100
[52:10] footer
[52:10] pulling boom man i am off
[52:13] and then the thought came to me you know
[52:15] what what are my prints say let me go
[52:16] back to how did i miss this
[52:18] so i pulled my prints out that were
[52:20] given to me in the beginning
[52:21] and as i pulled these prints out
[52:25] i had found that they had switched to
[52:26] dimension
[52:29] without even telling the superintendent
[52:31] now i'm like oh guys hey what's this
[52:33] i said look at yours look at mine what's
[52:35] up he's like oh
[52:36] oh no i said come here dave he's the
[52:38] superintendent i said dave come here
[52:40] i said let's have a little powwow here
[52:42] we said i said now what's the problem
[52:43] dave's like when did that change i said
[52:44] you tell me you're the superintendent
[52:46] you gave me these prints he's like ah
[52:49] now we have an issue so i was challenged
[52:52] on my layout we'll come to find out i
[52:54] had the right layout the whole time
[52:59] and we uh
[53:03] but since they missed up this one foot
[53:06] three it pulled
[53:07] everything and that's why my stuff is
[53:09] off so obviously we have to cut the
[53:10] concrete and this and this no bill no
[53:12] fault of mine cut the concrete uh the
[53:15] escalator started digging out where i
[53:16] was at
[53:17] and they hit an electrical line a major
[53:19] feed
[53:21] a 20 000 mistake the teeth of the bucket
[53:23] went right into the conduit
[53:25] hit the wire copper is showing ten
[53:28] thousand dollar mistake they had to pull
[53:30] all
[53:30] all the wire out repair the conduit pull
[53:32] the wire back in
[53:34] i went to then plumb back up and then
[53:36] guess what they laid out the walls
[53:38] and where i plumbed up was exactly
[53:41] correct
[53:45] in other words i could have left it
[53:46] there because this time the carpenter
[53:48] pulled all the way from the
[53:49] the long measurement and worked his way
[53:53] back
[53:53] this way and i was in the wall i was
[53:55] perfect
[53:58] but then i added all the small
[53:59] dimensions up and there was two foot
[54:01] missing there's some somewhere they met
[54:02] the
[54:02] the the architects missed two foot
[54:04] somewhere
[54:06] so in other words if we would have never
[54:07] said anything i'd have been fine
[54:11] and then directly after this problem
[54:13] someone comes and challenges me on
[54:14] serpent seed
[54:16] have i been taught wrong did i lay out
[54:18] serpents here wrong
[54:19] did i do this wrong did i is this wrong
[54:22] or this strong so
[54:23] this morning saints of god there is
[54:25] coming challenges
[54:28] and i have battled about three four
[54:30] wonderful brothers
[54:32] maybe five in the mess that were that
[54:34] was like this were in the message okay
[54:37] and they're coming up with some points
[54:40] but i've
[54:41] come up we've come up with a lot of
[54:42] questions here okay so i want to cover
[54:44] these today
[54:45] is that all right are we okay we're
[54:46] going to review this is this salad in
[54:48] your mind do you unders does everyone
[54:49] understand our surprise seed
[54:51] i mean they can understand it you
[54:52] understand exactly
[54:55] exactly what exactly took place there do
[54:57] we understand exactly is this possible
[55:03] so let's go into this the trail of the
[55:06] serpent here we see
[55:08] cain cannot understand why his sacrifice
[55:10] was not accepted by
[55:11] god abel's
[55:15] but first i want to show you this
[55:17] doctrine okay the lord opened up
[55:18] something now this is
[55:20] fantastically tremendous i want to show
[55:22] that i'm very excited to show this
[55:23] because i want to see if you guys can
[55:24] see this okay
[55:26] all right let's get into this now did
[55:28] the serpent have a name in genesis 3
[55:32] now the serpent was more subtle than he
[55:34] beats the field let me tell you
[55:35] something the lord
[55:36] i've got a five scripture doctrine i can
[55:39] show you the serpent's name
[55:41] i can show you his dad's name and i can
[55:43] prove to you the serpent can receive the
[55:45] holy ghost
[55:46] would you believe that if i can show it
[55:47] to you in five scriptures
[55:54] i had an itch on my back
[55:58] what do you believe that amen absolutely
[56:01] so let's get in this
[56:02] let's see if i can break this down let's
[56:04] see what the serpent's name is okay can
[56:06] and i can show you his daddy's name he
[56:09] had a dad i thought it was drake
[56:11] i can bring this through the word of god
[56:18] now the serpent who is the serpent let's
[56:20] let's just jump to the scripture now
[56:22] well we're going to jump from scripture
[56:23] to scripture to scripture to scripture
[56:25] okay
[56:26] i mean i know this might sound a little
[56:28] strange but let's just go there okay
[56:29] let's let's look here and in revelations
[56:31] 20 says and i saw an angel come down
[56:33] from the heaven having a key of the
[56:34] boundless pit and a great chain in his
[56:35] hand
[56:36] and he laid hold on the dragon that old
[56:39] serpent which is the devil and satan
[56:44] so the serpent is satan
[56:48] is that true okay now
[56:52] who is satan and peter took him began to
[56:56] rebuke him and saying
[56:57] far be it from thee lord that this shall
[56:59] have not shall not be unto thee jesus
[57:01] you do not have to die peter said this
[57:03] and he turns into peter get behind me
[57:05] satan
[57:06] so satan is peter
[57:10] genesis 3 the serpent's name is
[57:14] peter not only that but he's a time
[57:16] traveler
[57:17] how did how did peter get in genesis 3
[57:21] and peter get in matthew the gospels and
[57:24] then peter get all the way
[57:25] in revelations 20.
[57:28] but i'm bringing the word saints
[57:32] now who's peter's dad's name the
[57:35] serpent's dad's name
[57:37] jonah peter's dad's name is jonah the
[57:41] serpent's dad's name is jonah
[57:45] is this strange wait a second can the
[57:48] serpent receive the holy ghost
[57:49] and peter was filled with
[57:54] i just brought you a five scripture
[57:56] doctrine
[57:58] and i brought it from genesis to
[58:00] revelation
[58:02] do you believe it
[58:05] no absolutely that was an absolute lie
[58:10] i just created my own doctrine
[58:14] who the serpent was funny huh yeah
[58:17] because it's ridiculous
[58:21] serpents he cannot jesus said this world
[58:24] cannot receive the spirit of god
[58:30] but i just created a five doctrine
[58:33] five scripture doctrine thorough
[58:36] you would think okay so that was nice
[58:40] that was just a little test there i just
[58:41] want to see what would happen now let me
[58:43] tell you something saints now if
[58:45] if service seed is correct
[58:49] you know the bible says that
[58:53] adam said that all living called his
[58:55] name his wife's name's eve because she
[58:57] was the mother of all living right
[58:59] is there any scripture is there any
[59:02] scripture think now run your run your
[59:04] bible minds
[59:05] i i'm not captain memorization but you
[59:08] know how the bible says job said he was
[59:10] you can just taste
[59:11] and discern true word you can taste good
[59:13] meat
[59:15] is there any scripture that says that
[59:18] everyone came from one man
[59:21] sister kristen is shaking her head
[59:24] no what you can do with this one sister
[59:32] not putting her on the spot no no no
[59:34] watch this now watch this
[59:36] from one man he created all nations
[59:39] through the whole earth
[59:41] he decided beforehand that he should
[59:42] rise and fall and determine their
[59:44] boundaries
[59:46] this says right here everything came
[59:48] from
[59:49] one man what you can do with this
[59:52] sister lily was like shy or tricky
[1:00:00] you know what the bible really says
[1:00:04] that is a false translation
[1:00:08] and he the bible says here and has made
[1:00:11] one
[1:00:11] made of one blood not one man the bible
[1:00:15] the real king james version inspired
[1:00:17] authorized 1611
[1:00:19] he says and hath made of one blood all
[1:00:21] nations of men for to dwell on the face
[1:00:23] of the earth it does not say one man but
[1:00:26] one blood
[1:00:29] now if you take let's look at this and
[1:00:31] i'm not i'm not trying to put our sister
[1:00:32] over here
[1:00:33] or i'm just i'm just i'm just showing
[1:00:35] you points are we able to defeat these
[1:00:37] things
[1:00:39] what if they bring this scripture and
[1:00:41] you're like
[1:00:41] [Music]
[1:00:44] luckily god has trained us
[1:00:47] if we take this literal this is the new
[1:00:50] living translation
[1:00:53] if you take this scripture then you must
[1:00:56] take
[1:01:00] this scripture as well though he was a
[1:01:03] god
[1:01:04] he did not think of equality with god as
[1:01:06] something he ought to cling to
[1:01:08] it meant nothing that jesus and the
[1:01:10] father were one
[1:01:12] but my bible in our bible kjv says let
[1:01:15] this mind be in you which was also in
[1:01:17] christ jesus
[1:01:19] who being in the form of god thought it
[1:01:20] not robbery to be equal with god
[1:01:26] we're not to be uh we're not to think of
[1:01:28] robbery that we are equal with god
[1:01:30] if we are co-equal joint heirs with
[1:01:33] jesus
[1:01:34] we are absolutely equal with god
[1:01:38] if he purchased us then we would have to
[1:01:41] be the same value or equal value to what
[1:01:43] he gave to purchase us
[1:01:44] what do you give us he gave us his son
[1:01:47] his blood his righteous blood
[1:01:49] amen see so you're going to come you're
[1:01:51] going to you're going to maybe
[1:01:53] encounter strange things how first of
[1:01:55] all we got i said brother
[1:01:57] do you even know where the nlt version
[1:01:58] comes from it comes from a corrupted
[1:02:00] greek text
[1:02:02] westcott who are humanists even in the
[1:02:04] occult
[1:02:07] in the west kyle horton texts pulls from
[1:02:09] the sinaiticus the vantakinis
[1:02:12] and the uh alexandrian which are
[1:02:14] absolutely
[1:02:16] contrary to pretty much all no one has
[1:02:18] no protestant has ever seen
[1:02:20] the vanicanus texts but the king james
[1:02:23] was pulled from the majority
[1:02:25] text or the texas receptus which was
[1:02:28] over
[1:02:28] five thousand three to five thousand uh
[1:02:31] uh of
[1:02:32] portions of it and none of it
[1:02:33] contradicts each other
[1:02:35] and the sinaiticus the vaticanus in the
[1:02:37] alexandrian there is genesis and
[1:02:39] revelations missing
[1:02:42] but they couldn't sell a bible without
[1:02:43] genesis and revelations
[1:02:46] so where'd they pull that from
[1:02:49] so you see how easy it is to maybe
[1:02:51] deceive someone or get them on a loop or
[1:02:53] to however okay
[1:02:55] so now how do we build scripture
[1:02:59] this is how we build a doctor
[1:03:02] he says and that from a child that has
[1:03:03] known the holy scriptures which are able
[1:03:05] to make the wise unto salvation through
[1:03:07] faith which is in christ jesus he says
[1:03:10] all scripture is given by the
[1:03:11] inspiration
[1:03:12] of god right just some of this half of
[1:03:16] this
[1:03:16] he says all of it
[1:03:21] and is profitable for doctrine every
[1:03:24] scripture we can use
[1:03:26] to prove or disprove a doctrine you must
[1:03:29] run
[1:03:30] not a five that's why when i go to
[1:03:32] thailand i said i am not here i said i
[1:03:33] will prove everything from genesis
[1:03:36] revelations with more than three
[1:03:37] scriptures right he said amen and
[1:03:39] however they say amen an entire
[1:03:41] when he says also it's for reproof
[1:03:44] for correction for instruction in
[1:03:47] righteousness that the man of god may be
[1:03:49] perfect
[1:03:50] thoroughly furnished unto all good works
[1:03:52] this is how we build doctrine right
[1:03:55] now let's see he says what does he do he
[1:03:58] says
[1:03:59] re preach the word be instant in season
[1:04:02] out of season reprove rebuke exhort with
[1:04:05] all longsuffering and doctrine saints of
[1:04:07] god
[1:04:07] teach until you just finally say lord
[1:04:09] this is the last time if you don't do
[1:04:11] something here
[1:04:12] i am done because i'm exhausted yes
[1:04:15] good now why do we do this because
[1:04:18] there for the time will come well they
[1:04:21] will not endure sound doctrine
[1:04:25] but after their own lust with a heap to
[1:04:27] themselves t
[1:04:28] teachers having itching ears and shall
[1:04:30] be turned away their ears
[1:04:33] doll of hearing hebrews dull of hearing
[1:04:36] they need to be taught again he says
[1:04:38] they shall be turned away their ears
[1:04:40] from truth
[1:04:41] and shall be turned unto fables
[1:04:44] amen yes amen how else do we do it
[1:04:48] you know when i built my five scripture
[1:04:52] doctrine
[1:04:54] did i use all the word or just five
[1:04:56] scriptures
[1:04:58] because that was a pretty amazing story
[1:05:00] i told you
[1:05:02] peter was the serpent and he trans time
[1:05:05] traveled and
[1:05:05] i mean it was just crazy and he received
[1:05:08] eternal life
[1:05:12] now look here whom shall we teach
[1:05:15] doctrine verse 9
[1:05:16] and whom shall we make understand
[1:05:18] doctrine
[1:05:21] how are how is your pastor and whoever
[1:05:24] he brings before that's going to teach
[1:05:26] you things
[1:05:28] it must be what for precept
[1:05:31] must be upon precept amen he says
[1:05:34] precept upon priesthood not just two
[1:05:36] precepts he says show me all the
[1:05:37] precepts
[1:05:39] lying upon line lying upon lying look
[1:05:42] here's a little bit over here in genesis
[1:05:43] and look here's a little bit all the way
[1:05:45] over here in proverbs
[1:05:48] all the way through in other words when
[1:05:50] we teach baptism
[1:05:51] we use every scripture dealing with
[1:05:54] baptism
[1:05:54] amen and not only that we can use the
[1:05:57] type in the old testament all the way
[1:05:59] through
[1:06:01] everything that has to do with this
[1:06:02] subject or a doctrine we can pull from
[1:06:04] all scripture
[1:06:06] if we can't do that then there's a
[1:06:08] problem
[1:06:11] but notice what he says in verse 12 he
[1:06:13] says and yet he said they still would
[1:06:15] not
[1:06:16] hear though of hearing
[1:06:20] but notice it was priesthood of them but
[1:06:22] the word lord was unto them
[1:06:24] precept upon precept precept upon
[1:06:27] priesthood line upon line here though
[1:06:28] they're little and they might fall back
[1:06:30] and back
[1:06:30] broken snare to take in other words it
[1:06:32] didn't matter how good a teacher you
[1:06:33] were
[1:06:34] it doesn't matter that's right no matter
[1:06:37] how
[1:06:37] far you can prove it through scripture
[1:06:39] it they're not going to see it
[1:06:42] yes remember we're on trail serpent
[1:06:46] today
[1:06:46] got my hiking boots on
[1:06:50] i'm going to use one quote today and you
[1:06:51] know what that quote is

[1:10:08] brother cam
[1:10:09] i'm always like hurry up brother get
[1:10:12] your point get your point okay
[1:10:13] so we have to run again here um
[1:10:16] let's get this because when we're
[1:10:18] dealing with original sin we have first
[1:10:20] of all
[1:10:20] you they have a major question you have
[1:10:23] to make them
[1:10:24] and make them answer yes we have that we
[1:10:27] have a major issue here okay
[1:10:29] and this is just question number one
[1:10:31] let's look at this we're gonna run this
[1:10:33] real quick
[1:10:33] notice here in revelations 20 verse five
[1:10:36] and six
[1:10:36] it says now notice this is the first
[1:10:38] resurrection this is the rapture right
[1:10:40] and notice and this was showed to me
[1:10:42] five years ago i taught it brother
[1:10:43] jesse's the first place i thought this
[1:10:45] this is a this is a beautiful angle here
[1:10:49] in revelation says blessed and holy is
[1:10:52] he that hath part
[1:10:53] in the first resurrection right when did
[1:10:56] they get that blessing when did they
[1:10:57] become blessed
[1:10:58] we know when they got holy because the
[1:11:00] holy ghost was sent in acts 2.
[1:11:02] that's when they received their holiness
[1:11:04] but when did they receive that blessing
[1:11:06] when were they called blessed yes
[1:11:10] notice jesus says i bless you and make
[1:11:13] you holy he does not say that there he
[1:11:15] says they already were blessed and they
[1:11:17] already are holy
[1:11:20] it is not a present but it was already a
[1:11:22] past it's already
[1:11:23] he's just acknowledging what they are at
[1:11:25] the time of the rapture they are blessed
[1:11:27] and holy amen they've got it somewhere
[1:11:31] else so praise be to god
[1:11:32] now notice so where were these get where
[1:11:34] did they get their blessing from
[1:11:36] now great white judgment throne matthew
[1:11:38] 25
[1:11:40] 31 through 34 41 and 46 now the son of
[1:11:43] man which shall come in his glory
[1:11:44] those holy angels should sit upon the
[1:11:47] throne of his glory and before him shall
[1:11:48] be gathered nations and he shall
[1:11:49] separate them from one another as the
[1:11:50] sheep
[1:11:51] divided his shepherd divided his sheep
[1:11:53] from his goats and he
[1:11:54] shall set the sheep on his right hand
[1:11:56] but the goats on the left and then shall
[1:11:58] the king
[1:11:59] say unto them on come ye blessed
[1:12:03] where did they get this blessing notice
[1:12:05] did jesus bless them
[1:12:08] blessed of my father which is the holy
[1:12:12] ghost
[1:12:13] or the spirit of god
[1:12:17] when did they get this blessing
[1:12:23] when did they get this blessing this
[1:12:26] blessing is what kept them
[1:12:28] yes this blessing
[1:12:31] kept them blessed the entire time amen
[1:12:34] sir he says he shall be saying to them
[1:12:37] on the left hand to bar for me ye cursed
[1:12:39] into ever when did they receive that
[1:12:41] curse
[1:12:44] the only reason they can get on the left
[1:12:45] is because they were not blessed and
[1:12:47] they are already cursed
[1:12:48] yes right where do they get blessed and
[1:12:52] where they get now notice here this is
[1:12:54] simple but i'm telling you this is they
[1:12:56] have to prove
[1:12:57] this and i haven't asked the question
[1:12:59] yet
[1:13:02] notice the fifth day
[1:13:05] this is day five of creation okay
[1:13:09] and god said let there be bring forth
[1:13:10] waters abundantly the moving creatures
[1:13:12] notice
[1:13:12] he's creating water life
[1:13:16] and airlift now i put this one in
[1:13:17] because i had two eagles up there okay i
[1:13:19] chose that one of all them
[1:13:21] because of runner eagle anointing you
[1:13:22] know my brother i taught it brother
[1:13:23] randy science's
[1:13:24] uh two weeks ago or three weeks ago
[1:13:26] whatever and i didn't have a corona mask
[1:13:28] and they're heavy on chronomaster over
[1:13:29] there
[1:13:30] and the only one left in my wife's truck
[1:13:32] her car was
[1:13:34] in a yellow corona mask and i went up
[1:13:37] there and i said
[1:13:37] i know i look like an eagle but i'm here
[1:13:40] to speak
[1:13:40] [Laughter]
[1:13:43] so here we have all these creatures this
[1:13:45] is day five
[1:13:48] now notice what takes place on day five
[1:13:51] and god created great whales everything
[1:13:52] creature that moveth and those things
[1:13:54] whatever
[1:13:54] and god blessed them
[1:13:59] did they ever lose did these ever lose
[1:14:01] their blessing well jesse
[1:14:03] no son that was day five now notice what
[1:14:06] he says
[1:14:08] in day six day six now over to natural
[1:14:12] life
[1:14:13] and god said let the earth bring forth
[1:14:15] living creature after his kind and
[1:14:16] cattle and creeping thing and beast of
[1:14:18] the earth after
[1:14:19] after his kind and it was so and god
[1:14:22] made the beast of the earth after the
[1:14:23] kind the cattle of their kind
[1:14:25] every thing that creepeth upon this
[1:14:27] earth
[1:14:28] and his kind and god saw that notice he
[1:14:30] did not say and god
[1:14:31] said it was good he did not say that
[1:14:33] because it would have had to stay good
[1:14:36] but what he saw that it was good
[1:14:39] but notice no
[1:14:42] blessing
[1:14:46] no blessing
[1:14:49] on the animal life god is a mastermind
[1:14:53] he's setting
[1:14:54] the stage
[1:14:57] no blessing day five
[1:15:00] animal life i'm sorry day six animal
[1:15:02] life nothing
[1:15:04] but it's good pretty good looks good
[1:15:09] notice on day six as well he's
[1:15:12] creating an earth and now he creates
[1:15:16] in heaven and god sent us let us make
[1:15:18] man in our image after
[1:15:20] uh our likeness and let them have
[1:15:21] dominion over the fish of the sea over
[1:15:23] everything right day five and day six
[1:15:24] everything's under us now so god created
[1:15:27] man his own image in the image of god
[1:15:29] created him and male and female created
[1:15:30] them and god
[1:15:33] blessed them
[1:15:37] where did those in revelations 20 get
[1:15:38] their blessing right
[1:15:40] here yeah where did where did those in
[1:15:44] matthew 25 get their blessing
[1:15:47] right here but remember man those in
[1:15:50] revelations 20 got an upgrade they were
[1:15:51] holy too
[1:15:53] they had the holy ghost they were not
[1:15:55] foolish virgins but they were wise
[1:15:57] amen
[1:16:02] these are blessed now let me show you
[1:16:04] how powerful
[1:16:06] a blessing is okay
[1:16:11] this wow my fingers it must be dry
[1:16:16] oh this is a conditional covenant notice
[1:16:21] now the lord said to abram get the out
[1:16:23] of that country from the kingdom and
[1:16:24] from the house
[1:16:24] father's house unto a land i will shoot
[1:16:26] thee and i'll make thee a great nation
[1:16:28] and i will bless you in other words
[1:16:29] if he did not leave his father's house
[1:16:31] if he did not leave that country he
[1:16:32] would not get blessed but if he did
[1:16:34] these things he would be blessed
[1:16:37] so this is a conditional covenant
[1:16:43] now notice when balak wanted
[1:16:47] to curse them this conditional covenant
[1:16:50] passed all the way through his seed line
[1:16:51] right
[1:16:54] and he took a parable and said baylor
[1:16:55] the king of moab and brought me from
[1:16:57] aram into the mountains of the east
[1:16:58] saying
[1:16:59] come curse me jacob who came out jacob
[1:17:03] abraham come curse me come curse he says
[1:17:06] defy israel who came out israel one of
[1:17:08] the same
[1:17:09] not abraham how shall i curse whom god
[1:17:13] hath not cursed or how shall i defy
[1:17:16] whom the lord hath not defied
[1:17:20] and he took up a parable here in verse
[1:17:22] 18 and said rise up balaam can hear
[1:17:24] hearken unto me thou son of zipper god
[1:17:26] is not a man that he should lie did god
[1:17:28] lie in genesis 1
[1:17:30] and he blessed them
[1:17:33] he's not a liar neither the son of man
[1:17:35] that he should repent
[1:17:37] hath he said and shall he not do it if
[1:17:39] god says you are blessed
[1:17:41] no one can take it away you better
[1:17:43] realize that you
[1:17:44] are blessed on earth well brother i've
[1:17:47] got this this
[1:17:47] it doesn't matter because that blessing
[1:17:49] will stand all the way to the end
[1:17:51] amen why because you came
[1:17:56] out of god you are direct lineage from
[1:17:59] god and if god is a blessing and if he
[1:18:02] is blessed then you will be blessed as
[1:18:03] well
[1:18:04] amen he says shall
[1:18:08] hath he said and he shall he not do it
[1:18:11] or hath he spoke and shall he not make
[1:18:13] it good he
[1:18:14] will behold i cannot re
[1:18:17] i i have received commandment to bless
[1:18:20] and he hath
[1:18:20] blessed and i cannot reverse it
[1:18:25] blessing a conditional blessing
[1:18:29] he couldn't even reverse right
[1:18:32] good
[1:18:35] so let's say it like this
[1:18:39] where's my well the devil's fighting
[1:18:43] this one
[1:18:51] see this blessing right here this holds
[1:18:54] this will hold okay amen now let's
[1:18:56] continue on here
[1:18:58] now notice this
[1:19:02] after the fall see how strong this
[1:19:05] blessing is
[1:19:07] adam and eve literally calls every time
[1:19:09] you got sick
[1:19:10] every close brush with death every time
[1:19:13] god healed you every time you needed
[1:19:15] something
[1:19:15] every time you needed jesus christ he
[1:19:17] was there
[1:19:20] but every bad thing that has ever taken
[1:19:22] place on the earth was because of adam
[1:19:23] and eve
[1:19:24] right right let me say like this when
[1:19:27] cain killed abel
[1:19:29] that murder who'd that stem from
[1:19:32] adam and eve that was because sin had
[1:19:34] entered in
[1:19:38] but notice when it comes down to
[1:19:40] judgment time god does not
[1:19:42] curse the woman he cannot
[1:19:46] curse the woman but says you're going to
[1:19:48] have issues because of this
[1:19:50] you're going to have some problems in
[1:19:52] certain parts of your life
[1:19:54] then when it comes to adam who is a
[1:19:56] direct son of god
[1:19:58] he said cursed is the ground for thy
[1:20:00] sake
[1:20:01] he could not curse his direct
[1:20:04] son he could not curse his direct order
[1:20:14] the power of that blessing in genesis 1.
[1:20:18] genesis 3 1 there's another thought that
[1:20:21] goes out
[1:20:22] well this was just a spiritual being the
[1:20:25] serpent
[1:20:26] is a spirit now the serpent was more
[1:20:29] subtle than any
[1:20:30] beast and that word beast means raw
[1:20:33] alive
[1:20:34] and flesh god mercy this is not rocket
[1:20:38] science saints
[1:20:39] right this is not a tough thing this is
[1:20:42] so
[1:20:42] clear in the scripture it was a literal
[1:20:45] brute
[1:20:46] beast there was an animal called the
[1:20:48] serpent that could talk
[1:20:50] he could think he knew scripture
[1:20:53] oh but he was wild but notice
[1:20:57] at the time of the fall before he judges
[1:20:59] uh
[1:21:00] adam and eve wow
[1:21:04] oh yeah the devil's fighting for sure
[1:21:09] wow he does not want this taught
[1:21:13] notice after the fall this i mean we all
[1:21:15] know these things
[1:21:18] why did not he bless animal life on day
[1:21:20] six
[1:21:21] because he knew he was going to curse it
[1:21:24] he was going to curse the serpent which
[1:21:26] was animal right
[1:21:31] with no blessing god can do either way
[1:21:34] he can do bless or curse
[1:21:36] and because he took part in the fall he
[1:21:39] was cursed
[1:21:40] right right right now
[1:21:47] now look at cain
[1:21:52] and the lord said to cain where is abel
[1:21:54] thy brother and he said i know not am i
[1:21:56] my brother's keeper and he said what has
[1:21:57] thou done the voice of thy blood
[1:21:59] brothers blood crieth on me from the
[1:22:00] ground and now art thou
[1:22:03] curse from the earth
[1:22:07] you know they you know where their one
[1:22:09] scripture doctrine they're coming up
[1:22:10] with is genesis 4 1.
[1:22:14] when i first come to this message i
[1:22:16] would sit under bible studies of brother
[1:22:18] craig
[1:22:19] and i'd watch others come in i would sit
[1:22:21] there and redo the bible study again
[1:22:23] because i wanted to
[1:22:24] i wanted to look at this yes and you
[1:22:26] know the majority of the people who left
[1:22:29] was because of serpent seed in genesis 4
[1:22:31] 1.
[1:22:34] i'm just being honest so there's a
[1:22:36] scripture that kind of looks like it
[1:22:38] hinders or put a stumbling block
[1:22:40] before the people
[1:22:44] if cain was a son of god
[1:22:47] could god curse him
[1:22:52] right saints of god this this come this
[1:22:55] answers everything
[1:22:58] amen are you telling me that god can
[1:23:01] bless in one second and curse in the
[1:23:03] other
[1:23:05] wait a second who bro who who came out
[1:23:07] who
[1:23:08] who did kane come out of eve i thought
[1:23:11] she was blessed
[1:23:14] wait a second what took place in the
[1:23:16] garden
[1:23:18] that's right i'm good what took place
[1:23:21] in the garden that adam and eve direct
[1:23:25] direct splinters from god
[1:23:28] on earth blessing came from here that
[1:23:31] blessing that was with them
[1:23:32] came with them down in them
[1:23:36] and now cain and they will come out of
[1:23:38] one of these
[1:23:39] and yet god is able to curse one
[1:23:41] [Music]
[1:23:43] that's a major problem they have to get
[1:23:45] through that first
[1:23:48] if cain was the son of adam he would
[1:23:51] have to be blessed
[1:23:52] there's no way god could curse him
[1:23:56] amen amen that is must answer that
[1:23:59] number one
[1:24:08] now notice atoms directly from god
[1:24:11] easily proven in the scripture easily
[1:24:13] run down now notice is there another
[1:24:15] instance
[1:24:15] absolutely the the geniality of
[1:24:18] genealogy of jesus
[1:24:21] which was of enos which was of seth
[1:24:23] which was the son of adam which was the
[1:24:25] son
[1:24:25] of god amen direct lineage
[1:24:30] who in the world would put god in their
[1:24:32] genealogy
[1:24:35] god
[1:24:35] [Laughter]
[1:24:39] it started with god it is jesus christ
[1:24:44] let me tell you who you are you are the
[1:24:46] elect seed private word of god amen
[1:24:54] and they didn't have his spirit but you
[1:24:57] can receive
[1:24:58] it
[1:25:01] amen
[1:25:04] we are the most blessed richest
[1:25:08] people on the face of the earth to have
[1:25:11] this understanding this revelation
[1:25:16] i stood up for a certain group of people
[1:25:18] for about a year
[1:25:20] but when you turn against the word of
[1:25:22] god now it's on
[1:25:24] that's right you could say whatever you
[1:25:26] want
[1:25:27] i don't know why the prophet said
[1:25:28] certain things i don't know why the
[1:25:29] prophet did certain things i don't know
[1:25:30] i can't answer for him
[1:25:33] i will defend him sure but when you
[1:25:35] attack the word of god
[1:25:36] now the sword is drawn right
[1:25:39] now it's war and i am going to do
[1:25:43] everything i can to prove the word of
[1:25:44] god correct
[1:25:45] and this message correct as far as
[1:25:47] doctrinally holy ghost filled everything
[1:25:49] it is proven all right amen we will
[1:25:52] fight
[1:25:54] through the word now notice what jesus
[1:25:58] said in matthew 7
[1:25:59] he said beware of false prophets he's
[1:26:01] dealing with what
[1:26:03] people flesh and blood which come in
[1:26:06] your sheep's clothing which are inward
[1:26:08] or ravening wolves now that's symbolic
[1:26:09] obviously
[1:26:10] he says ye shall know them by their
[1:26:11] fruits do men gather grapes of thorns or
[1:26:13] things of thistles
[1:26:14] absolutely not these people will not
[1:26:17] have the fruits of the spirit
[1:26:19] even so every good tree
[1:26:22] is there anything that says that a a
[1:26:24] good tree uh
[1:26:25] can become a bad tree or a bad tree can
[1:26:27] become a good fruit good tree no jesus
[1:26:29] says there's either good
[1:26:30] or bad he says
[1:26:34] even so every good tree bringeth forth
[1:26:36] good fruit but a corrupt tree
[1:26:40] something that's been uh diseased
[1:26:46] let me say like this genesis 2 says
[1:26:50] in the beginning god made a garden he
[1:26:51] says and in it ever he said trees that
[1:26:54] were
[1:26:54] good for food so they were
[1:26:58] good trees good for food when did when
[1:27:00] did god ever create a crop tree
[1:27:03] is that recording genesis 2 he never
[1:27:06] created
[1:27:06] a corrupt tree
[1:27:10] so where do these crop trees come from
[1:27:14] my goodness things so plain
[1:27:17] he says even so every good tree bringeth
[1:27:19] forth good fruit but a corrupt tree
[1:27:21] bringeth forth
[1:27:21] evil fruit a good tree cannot bring
[1:27:24] forth
[1:27:24] evil fruit a good tree
[1:27:29] came cannot bring forth evil fruit
[1:27:34] was cane a good tree
[1:27:37] beef i'm talking before he was cursed
[1:27:39] was he a good tree
[1:27:42] no no because he brought forth evil
[1:27:45] fruit saints of god
[1:27:49] you only need the seventh grade
[1:27:50] education to understand this
[1:27:52] or less the bible said he reveals he's
[1:27:55] sung
[1:27:55] unto babes who would learn
[1:28:00] how they learned they'd wean off their
[1:28:01] mama until they can get onto some fresh
[1:28:03] meat
[1:28:04] and they said bring your precept upon
[1:28:05] precept line up online and they're
[1:28:07] here little they're little that's how
[1:28:09] they're taught just sitting there
[1:28:11] bible study preaching of the word of god
[1:28:14] brother jesse get up here by inspiration
[1:28:15] however and then what then the holy
[1:28:17] ghost will come down and vindicate it
[1:28:18] amen amen a good tree cannot bring forth
[1:28:23] even fruit neither can a crab tree bring
[1:28:24] forth
[1:28:25] good fruit every tree that cannot bring
[1:28:27] forth good fruit is hewn down and
[1:28:28] casting fire wherefore
[1:28:30] by their fruits ye shall know them
[1:28:33] yes simple i know but man think about it
[1:28:36] saints
[1:28:37] [Music]
[1:28:39] now let's see
[1:28:43] where am i going with this here
[1:28:48] let's jump to here remember matthew 13 7
[1:28:51] parables
[1:28:52] we've all been through this who knows
[1:28:53] how many times but look what the bible
[1:28:55] said look what jesus said actually here
[1:28:56] i just caught this recently
[1:28:58] he does one parable parable of the sower
[1:29:01] and then his disciples came and said to
[1:29:02] him
[1:29:03] why speakest unto them in parables
[1:29:07] yes yes why
[1:29:12] and the answer to them because it is
[1:29:13] given unto you to know the mysteries of
[1:29:15] the kingdom of god saints of god this
[1:29:17] is not for everyone
[1:29:21] i have to let me tell you something
[1:29:22] about me i i am of the
[1:29:25] i am one of those weaker compassionate
[1:29:27] people
[1:29:29] in fact i go i i really feel like i'm
[1:29:31] out of the will of god majority times i
[1:29:32] do stuff for people
[1:29:33] because i just get pulled if there's a
[1:29:35] poll to help in my
[1:29:36] in because remember there is there's a
[1:29:38] compassion jesus bible said they had
[1:29:40] compassion
[1:29:41] but if he had a spiritual compassion
[1:29:43] there's a natural compassion
[1:29:44] you can actually do too much wear
[1:29:46] yourself out
[1:29:47] that's right because of the human
[1:29:49] compassion that's right brother yes
[1:29:56] he says but to them it is not given
[1:30:00] what the revelation now only understand
[1:30:02] it in parable form they'll never really
[1:30:04] understand it right how can someone
[1:30:06] preach this gospel
[1:30:08] for 20 years and then say no it's wrong
[1:30:11] i told a brother recently you know what
[1:30:13] i studied this out 18 years ago
[1:30:17] brother i what no no i don't think you
[1:30:18] understand before i said this is
[1:30:20] right i said i studied it out 18 years
[1:30:23] ago
[1:30:24] right sitting before my teacher bible
[1:30:26] say after bible study bible study bible
[1:30:28] study
[1:30:28] and i'm like this is absolutely correct
[1:30:33] there's not been a doubt on this for
[1:30:35] over 18 years
[1:30:37] yes 19 maybe now
[1:30:40] it's that clear when i saw it
[1:30:43] it made all the sense of the world
[1:30:46] i told the brother i said i've taught
[1:30:48] this over 100 times
[1:30:50] literally wherever we can go
[1:30:53] yes but notice what he says in verse 12
[1:30:56] whosoever
[1:30:57] hath what does he have whosoever hath
[1:31:00] to him shall be given and he shall have
[1:31:03] more abundance
[1:31:06] but whosoever hath not
[1:31:09] for him shall be taken away even that
[1:31:11] what she had and he's dealing with the
[1:31:13] mysteries
[1:31:14] he's dealing with the understanding he's
[1:31:16] dealing with his
[1:31:17] word i love i just love that guy gil
[1:31:20] look what gill said for whosoever hath
[1:31:23] whosoever hath the true grace of god
[1:31:26] implanted in him in other words a real
[1:31:28] seed
[1:31:30] who has saving knowledge of christ
[1:31:33] someone really saved
[1:31:35] and as a spiritual acquaintance with the
[1:31:37] doctrines of gospel god has given him
[1:31:39] what the keys are given the rock
[1:31:41] the revelation of the word of god amen
[1:31:44] amen
[1:31:46] shall have more grace given him
[1:31:50] how did david get that grace when he
[1:31:52] should have been killed what he was seen
[1:31:54] amen and he loved god he worshiped that
[1:31:57] with all his might amen
[1:31:59] he already half and what he was given
[1:32:02] even more amen
[1:32:04] let me tell you something when david
[1:32:06] gave
[1:32:07] grace to solomon so many
[1:32:10] times the grace was laid on to him amen
[1:32:13] was bathsheba
[1:32:16] think about it how many times and he
[1:32:18] would not say one word against god
[1:32:20] anointed
[1:32:22] then david caught in his own sin and god
[1:32:25] says
[1:32:26] you wouldn't even touch someone who was
[1:32:28] trying to kill you who i
[1:32:30] anointed i give you grace
[1:32:34] think about it so who had
[1:32:37] much war will be given to you
[1:32:41] look at the law the reaping and the
[1:32:43] selling
[1:32:46] amen amen praise god give grace to
[1:32:49] everyone amen
[1:32:51] we're not giving up on one soul praise
[1:32:54] god
[1:32:55] i don't care if they call the prophet
[1:32:56] false i'm not giving up on them
[1:32:59] amen
[1:33:06] he shall grow in the knowledge of christ
[1:33:09] and the spirit of truth shall
[1:33:11] lead him unto all truth hallelujah
[1:33:14] and shall have more abundance more grace
[1:33:17] more light
[1:33:18] more knowledge experience all grace
[1:33:20] shall be abound towards him and he shall
[1:33:22] be filled with the fullness
[1:33:24] of god the stature of a perfect man
[1:33:28] if you receive the holy ghost he said
[1:33:30] jesus said well he says you're going
[1:33:32] all the way i'm not stopping with
[1:33:34] justification and save the case and
[1:33:35] brothers don't know if you're going all
[1:33:36] the way to adoption glorification
[1:33:39] the new body
[1:33:44] amen and his light shall shine this is
[1:33:47] this is man age stuff here
[1:33:50] these guys are geniuses super revelators
[1:33:53] man
[1:33:54] i'm captain gleaner i'll be it i don't
[1:33:55] care
[1:33:58] what do you say about that whosoever
[1:33:59] hath not
[1:34:02] the truth of grace nor spiritu
[1:34:05] spiritual knowledge of christ nor any
[1:34:08] experience of the doctrine of the gospel
[1:34:10] they really never
[1:34:10] understood it right so someone ah
[1:34:14] and and for all those who may know
[1:34:16] brother jesse sister kristen
[1:34:20] sister beth do you guys anyone else know
[1:34:22] of chris hall
[1:34:26] he was a mighty preacher in the message
[1:34:28] back in the
[1:34:29] late 90s early 2000s
[1:34:34] and when i come in the message directly
[1:34:36] right when i come to message
[1:34:37] fall of 2001 right before a month or two
[1:34:40] before that he preached a sermon called
[1:34:41] two seeds
[1:34:42] yes and that it's a two-part sermon
[1:34:46] that sermon was absolutely the greatest
[1:34:50] teaching i've ever heard on serpent seed
[1:34:51] amen
[1:34:52] bar none i've never heard anyone preach
[1:34:55] like this
[1:34:57] right when i heard those i had my little
[1:34:59] dv
[1:35:00] dvd or cd walkman you know when i take
[1:35:02] it to work and i would listen
[1:35:03] while i'm working and i'm just welding
[1:35:04] i'm just like this is phenomenal
[1:35:07] this is unbelievable how did i never see
[1:35:09] this before no one's ever told me to
[1:35:11] stop
[1:35:12] and i i listen those things hundreds of
[1:35:13] times
[1:35:16] and he had the greatest teaching on
[1:35:19] serpent seed
[1:35:20] i've ever heard yes you know where he's
[1:35:22] at now
[1:35:23] he believes trinity eternal hell
[1:35:27] baptized fought from a ghost and he's
[1:35:29] not even living a christian right now
[1:35:31] that's right
[1:35:33] had the greatest teaching of serpent
[1:35:35] seed yes literally oh jess have you
[1:35:37] heard that
[1:35:37] absolutely the most powerful
[1:35:41] revelated scripture description talk
[1:35:44] about
[1:35:44] precept the palm priesthood line up
[1:35:46] online here a little there little
[1:35:48] he had it all he was a machine gun
[1:35:51] preacher
[1:35:52] right and now he doesn't even see it
[1:35:57] right
[1:36:01] i hate to use him as a example but
[1:36:04] that's an example
[1:36:05] yes yes for whosoever hath not
[1:36:08] from him shall be taken away even that
[1:36:10] which he seems to have
[1:36:12] or that which he seemed to have as luke
[1:36:15] expressed it
[1:36:16] for everything besides truth grace is
[1:36:19] mere show
[1:36:20] it has no solidity in it in it as
[1:36:23] natural parts human learning
[1:36:24] and a form of knowledge and of truth in
[1:36:26] the law the national
[1:36:27] let me give an example of let me give
[1:36:29] you an example of learning and
[1:36:30] understanding
[1:36:33] i just laid some sanitary and i ran
[1:36:35] three inch pvc all the way and i had to
[1:36:37] make a 90 bend
[1:36:41] and on the prints it showed 245s about
[1:36:44] five
[1:36:44] four foot apart right 45 piece pipe 45
[1:36:49] and you know what i did when i laid it i
[1:36:52] took two 45s a street 45 and a regular
[1:36:54] 45
[1:36:54] and put them together glued them
[1:36:56] together and i made that that way
[1:36:58] and the guy come in who drew this
[1:37:00] drawing came up to me he's like
[1:37:03] and i said what he goes you don't have
[1:37:05] 245's
[1:37:07] i said yes i do they're put together he
[1:37:10] says but on the drawing it says they're
[1:37:11] 245's this way over this one i says
[1:37:14] by code the only way you can make
[1:37:18] a three inch turn 90 degree turn
[1:37:21] is by 245's it's perfectly legal in fact
[1:37:25] it's less one one less joint to leave
[1:37:26] in fact it's the smoother transition
[1:37:29] so by knowledge he understood this but
[1:37:32] by understanding he had no clue what he
[1:37:34] was even talking about
[1:37:36] he goes well we'll see what the
[1:37:37] inspector says i'm like i've been
[1:37:39] plumbing for 16 years i have five
[1:37:40] plumbing licenses
[1:37:42] this is standard i didn't say that but i
[1:37:44] was just like i'm looking i'm just going
[1:37:47] and to me i'm like he knows it
[1:37:50] but he doesn't know it right he has
[1:37:53] absolutely no experience
[1:37:55] right he wondered if the inspector
[1:37:58] the holy ghost was going to be okay with
[1:38:00] that right
[1:38:02] right and i just stood and looked at him
[1:38:06] like
[1:38:07] unbelievable
[1:38:08] [Laughter]
[1:38:11] say to god lord give me the
[1:38:14] understanding
[1:38:16] let this revelation let the revelation
[1:38:20] of the word of god end on the holy ghost
[1:38:22] following us
[1:38:24] and give us refilling after refilling
[1:38:35] so the inspector shows up that day and i
[1:38:38] was caught up in a lift that was
[1:38:39] actually i was unloading things
[1:38:40] from a truck on the radar
[1:38:44] and the inspector's talking with the
[1:38:45] superintendent and i just watched as i'm
[1:38:48] driving by
[1:38:53] and i get done and i jump off and i'm
[1:38:54] like sorry uh mark i'm late blah blah
[1:38:56] blah he goes oh no problem
[1:38:57] he looks great here's your sticker but
[1:38:58] it's gone just like that and dave the
[1:39:00] superintendent is like sai
[1:39:02] he just said you and jeff are the best
[1:39:03] plumbers some of the best plumbers he's
[1:39:05] ever had blah blah blah
[1:39:07] and i'm just like i told you dave
[1:39:12] i told you i know what i'm talking about
[1:39:14] right right just like brother said he
[1:39:15] said would you rather have someone
[1:39:17] brand new fresh out of school out of to
[1:39:20] do your surgery or do you want someone a
[1:39:22] doctor who's trained
[1:39:24] someone who's done a thousand surgeries
[1:39:27] give me the one that's actually done the
[1:39:29] surgery instead of just
[1:39:31] instead of looking here i want to see
[1:39:33] someone who can understand it amen
[1:39:35] and make it plain and prove all things
[1:39:37] amen
[1:39:38] and bring it from here there all over
[1:39:40] through the scripture make
[1:39:41] a complete complete a for a full
[1:39:43] doctrine
[1:39:45] amen for sure
[1:39:48] praise god hallelujah now let's continue
[1:39:51] on here
[1:39:52] therefore speak i unto them in parables
[1:39:55] because they
[1:39:56] seeing see not and hearing hear not
[1:39:59] neither do they understand
[1:40:02] they just can't understand
[1:40:06] right saints of god if i was
[1:40:11] sister lydia you know how to work that
[1:40:14] computer
[1:40:16] could you turn this off off the internet
[1:40:19] for a second
[1:40:19] just for a second oh okay never mind
[1:40:23] then
[1:40:23] we'll save that anyhow so here because
[1:40:27] they sing not and hearing they hear not
[1:40:29] neither do they understand
[1:40:31] and what jesus said this is a prophecy
[1:40:33] now notice he's dealing with the seven
[1:40:34] parables the mysteries of the kingdom
[1:40:36] correct
[1:40:37] but notice at the end of this he says he
[1:40:39] says but blessed are your
[1:40:41] eyes for they see and your ears for they
[1:40:45] hear amen if you can still see services
[1:40:48] thanks to god you are blessed
[1:40:50] and no no remember this is not a
[1:40:52] salvation doctrine if you can't see
[1:40:53] servicing praise with god you have the
[1:40:54] holy ghost
[1:40:56] maybe god hasn't revealed to you yet
[1:40:57] that's right the main thing is receiving
[1:41:00] the baptism
[1:41:00] of the holy ghost doesn't matter if you
[1:41:05] understand it
[1:41:05] it's just for you to believe it so oh i
[1:41:08] could be right here and say
[1:41:10] man i don't know what took place in
[1:41:11] genesis 3 i have no clue but i'll tell
[1:41:13] you what i believe something took place
[1:41:15] because here's cain's curse that cannot
[1:41:17] be king son what happened there i don't
[1:41:19] know i'm gonna stay away from it that's
[1:41:20] a little too deep for me this and this
[1:41:22] but i'll tell you what if you have the
[1:41:22] holy ghost you're gonna be there in that
[1:41:24] rapture
[1:41:27] hey man
[1:41:31] praise be to god now i'm going to skip
[1:41:34] this here
[1:41:37] wow i've never
[1:41:44] wow this is really battling here i've
[1:41:46] never had this act so slow
[1:41:48] now look at this
[1:41:54] so number one how can god curse his own
[1:41:57] seedline
[1:41:58] he cannot all right i uh show me any
[1:42:01] example that
[1:42:02] all right anyone that's blessed is
[1:42:04] blessed now here's the here's the next
[1:42:06] thing we want to show
[1:42:08] and prove to the scripture here thanks
[1:42:10] again i'll be honest we're at 59 minutes
[1:42:14] now i can continue on there and i'm
[1:42:16] going to show you something that
[1:42:17] absolutely that
[1:42:18] when i taught it back home god
[1:42:19] absolutely showed something i've never
[1:42:21] seen before in the light
[1:42:22] and maybe i'll save that for a second
[1:42:24] service would that be okay yeah
[1:42:26] let's go a little longer here we'll
[1:42:28] we'll we'll we'll close down service
[1:42:30] there
[1:42:31] and then back up but i want to show you
[1:42:32] this nugget because there's
[1:42:34] a powerful powerful nugget i've never
[1:42:36] seen before
[1:42:38] and it really opened up to me now that's
[1:42:40] this is a real one this ain't time
[1:42:41] travel this saint you know
[1:42:42] i'm not talking about peter calling the
[1:42:44] serpent i'm not this is real a real deal
[1:42:47] okay i know i hope i didn't throw
[1:42:49] anybody off really i mean
[1:42:51] all right in acts 750
[1:42:54] hath not my hands made all things now
[1:42:57] notice this is stephen
[1:42:58] he says ye stiff-necked and
[1:43:00] uncircumcised in heart and
[1:43:02] ears he says you always resist the holy
[1:43:06] ghost
[1:43:06] always resist the holy ghost who
[1:43:10] left the presence of god in genesis 4
[1:43:14] who left the very presence of god
[1:43:16] almighty
[1:43:18] king as your
[1:43:22] fathers did
[1:43:26] what's he doing he's tracing the seed
[1:43:28] line
[1:43:29] he's on the trail of the serpent right
[1:43:31] now
[1:43:32] he's he's coming to present tense and
[1:43:35] he's running that line
[1:43:36] all the way back
[1:43:39] because in the scriptures bless you
[1:43:42] bless you again
[1:43:43] you go he says as your fathers did so do
[1:43:47] ye then in first 57 he says then they
[1:43:50] cried out with a loud voice and stopped
[1:43:52] their ears and ran with him with one
[1:43:53] accord amen
[1:43:56] now why could they not hear him
[1:44:00] actually let's turn to let's turn to
[1:44:02] john
[1:44:05] eight yes now these are all familiar
[1:44:09] scriptures okay but we're just trying to
[1:44:10] prove a point here
[1:44:12] yes because these are these things are
[1:44:14] not in here for vein
[1:44:16] or vanity but they're in here to show
[1:44:18] something
[1:44:20] and only god's elect can really
[1:44:22] understand it can really see it that's
[1:44:23] true
[1:44:24] i mean it's simple in john 8
[1:44:28] look at verse 41
[1:44:32] he says ye do the deeds of your father
[1:44:34] then they said unto him we be not born
[1:44:36] of fornication
[1:44:37] why are they dealing if it's notice he
[1:44:39] says ye do the deeds of your father
[1:44:42] and they said to we be not born of
[1:44:43] fornication why do they go to that act
[1:44:47] yes i thought it was well my my dad
[1:44:50] didn't eat nothing
[1:44:52] i thought it was i eating
[1:44:56] i thought it was apples or apricots or
[1:44:59] however you ever noticed in the garden
[1:45:01] of eden they always show
[1:45:03] show the apple tree you know who the
[1:45:06] apple tree is
[1:45:07] jesus song of psalms 2.
[1:45:11] who is the apple tree jesus the tree of
[1:45:14] life
[1:45:16] but carnal minds always put the apple
[1:45:18] tree in there
[1:45:20] and make that the tree of knowledge good
[1:45:22] evil but it's not it is
[1:45:24] the apple tree is jesus christ read song
[1:45:27] of solomon now
[1:45:31] jesus said if god were your father you
[1:45:33] would love me for i proceeded forth and
[1:45:35] came from god just like adam just like
[1:45:38] abel for i proceeded forth and came from
[1:45:41] god neither came i
[1:45:42] myself but he sent me why do you not
[1:45:44] understand
[1:45:45] my speech in other words
[1:45:49] this is the first time they're hearing
[1:45:51] jesus and yet they didn't understand it
[1:45:55] wow it's new it seemed new to them
[1:45:59] but when the disciples heard it they
[1:46:01] said this is it john said there he is
[1:46:03] that's him
[1:46:04] that's right even because you cannot
[1:46:08] hear
[1:46:08] my word
[1:46:12] notice verse 47 john 8 verse 47
[1:46:15] he that is of god heareth god's words
[1:46:20] ye therefore hear them not because ye
[1:46:21] are not of
[1:46:24] god can we bring this back to genesis
[1:46:28] right absolutely genesis 1 verse 27
[1:46:32] so god created he created man in his own
[1:46:35] image
[1:46:35] in the image of god creating him he male
[1:46:37] and female and created he them
[1:46:38] and god blessed them and god said unto
[1:46:42] them
[1:46:44] if we are real literal children of god
[1:46:46] we have already heard his voice
[1:46:50] we have already heard our father's voice
[1:46:55] it will seem familiar to us it will
[1:46:58] speak to us and say
[1:47:02] that's it amen
[1:47:06] notice the difference between god coming
[1:47:08] down on adam and eve
[1:47:09] after the fall and they just conversed
[1:47:11] and said lord it's
[1:47:12] lord it was her it was i mean they
[1:47:14] didn't have any problem with god
[1:47:16] they gave god absolutely no problem
[1:47:18] right
[1:47:19] in fact they was familiar to them
[1:47:21] something about yes this is this is the
[1:47:23] father this is god absolutely but when
[1:47:24] it came to cain
[1:47:26] king was wroth right oh yeah well
[1:47:31] i don't think that's right exactly and
[1:47:32] i'm not going to do that and no no no
[1:47:35] right notice the attitudes look at the
[1:47:36] fruit yes sir just when both come in the
[1:47:39] presence of god
[1:47:41] totally contrary to one another told the
[1:47:43] opposite
[1:47:44] yes sir change of god this is this
[1:47:47] is manifestation we're dealing with
[1:47:50] literal manifestation
[1:47:52] between two seed lines one is blessed
[1:47:56] one is cursed one can hear the words of
[1:47:58] god and the other cannot
[1:48:05] why am i reviewing this after 18 or 19
[1:48:07] years
[1:48:11] it's already settled in my heart right
[1:48:18] but i want to make it clear
[1:48:20] [Music]
[1:48:22] we're honing our swords this morning and
[1:48:24] we're just about done
[1:48:26] saints of god so let's let's uh let me
[1:48:28] look at this here
[1:48:30] this one question will solve everything
[1:48:34] forget blessings and cursings
[1:48:37] forget hearing and not being able to
[1:48:39] hear if we can just
[1:48:41] determine who cain's dad is
[1:48:46] that would solve everything because if
[1:48:49] cain was of adam
[1:48:51] we're all sons of god and daughters of
[1:48:52] god
[1:48:54] but if there's not if there's something
[1:48:57] wrong
[1:48:59] then there is a literal seed so anyhow
[1:49:01] let's stand we're
[1:49:02] an hour and five votes we're going to
[1:49:04] continue on and i'm going to show you
[1:49:06] something i believe to be absolutely
[1:49:07] phenomenal fantastic
[1:49:10] by the grace of god ever feeling okay
[1:49:14] okay we're
