========================================

chapter 4 verse 11 we'll pick up right where we left off on Sunday morning I just thought this might be an encouragement here to the church tonight you know good to see brother Ray how you doing sir good to see you buddy God bless you you look good brother you look better every time I see you by God's grace Hallelujah I really mean that my God that's your strength Hallelujah Romans is part seven we've been looking at the book of Romans just preaching verse by verse and pulling out quotes from Brother Branham and uh all these wonderful thoughts here by God's grace it's such a joy to go scripture by scripture and we're resting on what Paul preached praise God and we're resting on the fact that brother Brandon preached what Paul preached Hallelujah as each Church age has to look at the messenger their Messenger will present them to Christ Hallelujah as a chaste virgin hallelujah amen what a blessing Hallelujah the messenger for each age presents the people to Christ Hallelujah so we're grateful for the message uh of the holy spirit that God gave to brother Branham and we're continuing that on by God's grace Romans 4 verse 11 we left off in verse 11. so I want to read 11 and 12. Romans 4 11 and 12. and I was ready to preach also the souls that were in prison part two but Lord willing I'll just save that for Sunday here by God's grace Romans 4. just thought this might be an encouragement here tonight look we'll look at the life of Abraham a little bit deeper here a little more in depth here tonight as we mentioned on Sunday Romans 4 11 let's read well how about I read 11 and we'll all read 12. how about that I'll read 11 because and he received a sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also let's read verse 12 1 2 3 and the father of circumcision to them who are not of the circumcision only but who also walk in the steps of that Faith of Our Father Abraham which he had being yet uncircumcised let's have one more word of prayer if you ever need on your heart let's make it unto God father God we thank you again for tonight we thank you for the prayers of the Saints we thank you for the songs of worship thank you God that your love is like a hedge is protecting us Lord God even as your Prophet saw that vision of the the blood veil of Jesus protecting the Earth Lord from judgment we thank you God for Mercy such wonderful Mercy in this hour God we confess our sins God hallelujah and we realize our robes are white tonight Lord we thank you for that and Lord let the word of God strengthen your people Lord as the Bible says may we mix the word of God with Faith Lord God let's have faith in the word of God confidence in the scriptures and I pray God your minister now to us Lord anoint me anoint your people God we both need to be Anointed God that your will might be accomplished here tonight in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as being seated praise God hallelujah I really appreciate your prayers you know it does something for me to hear you pray too you know I I feel like you know I feel like I could just pray all the time in front of everybody but I sure like to hear your prayers that really does a lot to me so I appreciate you praying tonight by God's grace well yeah that too but tonight we just had such a small group I just gathered everybody around here and then I I felt led to ask you know can you pray for that can you pray for that because we had a long list of prayer requests and so we were I was feeling kind of small so I said well let's just gather here together you know like like a bunch of eaglets by God's grace you can switch over I do have some slides today so you know sometimes we'll do that brother at the end of service too like you know we've done that numerous times we've all come up here for prayer I said well who would like to pray for this or does anybody have any requests you know it just kind of makes a different experience and I sure like to hear people pray you know just so we want to start here where we left off you know we left off on Sunday you know showing that Abraham already had the righteousness of God before he had the seal and uh my wife let me know I asked that question I asked the question to everybody you know what was uh what was the New Testament anti-type of the Old Testament circumcision and of course I said it wrong so forgive me that's why nobody can come up with the answer I said it wrong and of course we know the anti-type of circumcision is the baptism of the Holy Ghost so forgive me my wife kind of said well you know brother Jesse you said that wrong and I'm like well I'm sorry about that that was my fault so in other words this scripture says that Abraham was already righteous before he had the seal that church this opens up the revelation of course that foolish virgin already righteous even if they're not born again it opens that Revelation up because this is a type right and then we have the anti-type we have you know Matthew 25 verses 1 to 13 of the parable of the wise of foolish version you have later Matthew 25 uh the scene of the great white Throne judgment where Christ is Seated on the throne and then he separates all the Believers are all the people sheep as goats right and he gives eternal life unto the Sheep right but they're surprised how did we when did we ever do anything good for you and of course we know that that means those are the foolish virgins and those that are granted eternal life right and the bot and Jesus said he says that uh he said enter into the joys prepared for you from the foundation of the world so that means Jesus had all the foolish virgin in his mind as well right like brother random talks about a remnant of cloth right you cut out a certain cloth Haven's doing it right now for her dress she's making a dress it she's doing sewing camp this week learning how to sew with a sewing machine well she's got to cut a certain part of the fabric out right and tomorrow you're going to finish the dress so that dress is a type of the wise virgin praise God but everything that's left over we can still salvage some of that praise God and that be the type of the food is Virgin right and it's also a beautiful type of how the Bible says in second Peter chapter 2 that lot was righteous although he was vexed daily because he chose to live closer to Sodom and Gomorrah he chose it on purpose yet he was still a righteous man right without the seal right we don't even know if he ever got the seal but the Bible called him righteous well yeah he would have got the seal right because he would have been with Abraham's Group Well possibly I'm not sure on that one I have to I'll have to research out a little bit further by God's grace but one thing's for sure lot was called righteous by Peter so we have Abraham who had the seal lot who perhaps didn't have it now we know brother M says Abraham was a silver dollar and a lot was a penny right we know brother brother have said that in other words he's showing the wise and foolish virgin types in the Bible right all down through the Bible from Genesis to Revelation right so we can see that plainly but I hope that was a blessing you know uh Mr Brother Ray I just showed how Abraham was called out uh to serve God in Genesis 12 but it wasn't until nine years later that he got the seal but the whole time he was righteous amen praise God right and so did it can be in our lives right as soon as we repent and we're baptized we're forgiven we're righteous Jesus has Justified us praise God now the seal will come later on some longer than others it doesn't really matter though as long as you get the seal that's the main thing praise God make sure you get Born Again In other words press into the kingdom of God hallelujah don't don't hold back just keep pressing on just keep traveling on pretty soon you'll cross over Jordan amen hallelujah just keep believing God's word hallelujah keep applying the word of God to your life keep trusting in God's word keep making Footsteps in your walk with God and pretty soon you'll cross over into Jordan hallelujah amen now for tonight though I want to emphasize this next part just briefly that righteousness might be imputed unto them also Abraham was not necessarily a Jew right he wasn't because the Jews weren't even in existence yet Judah had not even been born yet right Abraham Isaac Jacob and Judah came out of Jacob right so there wasn't even Jew yet right but the Bible said that Abraham was given salvation and then a seal uh he was already righteous that righteousness might be imputed to the Gentiles also so this was a sign he wasn't even a Jew yet or there wasn't an official Jewish Nation or anything God was starting a nation with Israel or I'm sorry with uh with with Abraham but the fact was he was showing that God saved Abraham by Grace remember we saw that it was by faith only by grace through faith and he was already righteous and that was a sign that God can make us righteous as well Hallelujah that's what he says right here to them also not just the circumcision but the uncircumcision not just the Jew but you and I praise God Amen oh my God just church I think you know I think when when we have that Revelation and it's fresh in Our Minds when we have a revelation that's fresh that I am the righteousness of God we live differently right instead of living like I'm a I'm such a failure right instead of living I'm a failure or I'm sorry I struggle all the time instead of living like that we can live that I have the righteousness of Christ Christ has imputed righteousness to me all my sins are gone amen they're underneath the blood amen of the Cross of Calvary as far as darkness is from dawn praise God ah when we live with that understanding we live a different life praise God we don't live a life of defeat anymore praise God we live a life of Victory praise God Hallelujah now that verse of course reminds me of another book you're familiar with this now then what we are ambassadors for Christ the same writer Paul says as though God did beseech You by us we pray you in Christ's dead be you reconciled to God that means to be made uh right relationship again reconciled to have favor again you have favor with God you're in good relationship with God God's not angry for he hath made him to be sin for us who knew no sin that we might be made the righteousness of God in him wow what a what a statement that is Christ was made your sin Christ became my sin now think how ugly our sin was all of us all of us have sin that's ugly and Christ was made to be that sin for us Christ became your lies you're stealing you're cheating whatever it was your uh unfaithfulness lying whatever it was backbiting Christ became all that he took upon your sin that you might become his righteousness now think of his Holiness that's what you've got praise God it's imputed to you in heaven praise God Hallelujah what is scripture I just you know I just feel like wouldn't we just live so much higher and this scripture was constantly in our thoughts here Christ became my sin that means my sins paid for Jesus became my sin all of it not just a little all of it praise God the Bible said Isaiah 53 all of our iniquity was placed on him can you turn on that fan Malachi just pressed the power button three times that puts it on high it's a little warm in here tonight by God's grace maybe all that singing and shouting and praying and preaching maybe it makes us me hot up here so maybe that would cool me off hallelujah thank you Lord Christ was made to be sin for us now brother man says he never sinned and he wasn't a sinner he became sin sin was placed upon him but Jesus never sinned he never was a sinner Hallelujah he never he knew he knew no sin that we may might be made the righteousness of God in him Hallelujah so through Jesus we become righteous Hallelujah oh thank God think about uh you know the person who's writing this blaspheme Jesus if anybody was not worthy of righteousness it was the guy who wrote this amen he persecuted Jesus's people he took him off to prison he consented they should die we don't know that he killed anybody he'd stand there and say they deserve to die kill them blasphemy and this is the guy that says all my sin for that was put on Jesus and now I am the righteousness of God right how can our minds even wrap our we can't even wrap our minds around that praise God the guy who doesn't believe or doesn't shouldn't deserve it right we would think doesn't deserve it he's the one that says he's got it praise God and if he's got it you and I got it praise God amen a church we kind of laugh and say well no I'm the chief of Sinners no you're the chief no I'm the chief of Sinners right we try to Humble ourselves but Paul said he felt like he was the chief of sinners and yet he says I have the righteousness of Christ because Christ took all my sin praise God amen if we have trouble if we have trouble with our sin question well let's go listen to that day on Calvary because brother said Calvary settles the same question and let's read II Corinthians 5 20 and 21 let's read it over and over again amen hallelujah until we can be assured that Jesus Paid the penalty for all of our sins and that Jesus is righteousness is now given freely to you and I ah it's gracious what a promise man what a promise it's just like the Bible said Abraham live by faith he just believed God that's what we're going to get to he just believed he didn't earn salvation by Austin he just believed what God Said and then he did his best he just did his best to obey it Hallelujah he wasn't perfect I'm going to show you like five or six times the Bible says he just plainly failed God oh yeah there's all those seven or eight other times the Bible records he'd obeyed God hallelujah [Applause] in other words he was up and down up and down just like you and just like God forgave him God will forgive you too praise God just like we he didn't just he didn't look like he deserved God's righteousness but he got it so do you get it to praise God because the Bible said you're a child of Abraham he's your father praise God the spiritual father the Bible says and if he gets God's righteousness you get it too praise God if the dad got it the children get it too that's what the Bible says it's his him and all of his seed praise God how many know that God has blessed you and nobody can curse you how many know that that's I cannot deny that I deserved I've done things that deserve cursing yet God has blessed my life Sports you know full ride scholarship a nice job nice family like I don't deserve God's blessing but somehow I'm blessed sister who and I know I'm a child of Abraham praise God now look at your life you can say the same thing I don't deserve it I did this and that I I was ashamed of myself there I surely didn't deserve it there but yet all you can do is look at your life and say Jesus has blessed me Hallelujah Familia praise God like you know you know there's people on YouTube that they try to curse me and they don't like our beliefs and the message and I'm like that doesn't hurt my feelings you can't curse me God has already blessed me praise God you're just wasting your time typing out you're wasting your breath nobody can curse me because God's already blessed me Hallelujah he said it it's thus saith the Lord in uh Genesis 12 and Galatians 3 and 4 praise God you can't curse what God has blessed Hallelujah the verse that means so much to me I don't know if I'm gonna go through this verse tonight I reached one verse Brother Brad says you could spend all months on just one of those seals you know just and that's like one or two verses and the father of circumstance says him to them who are not of the circumcision only are Gentiles but who also walk in the steps of that Faith of Our Father Abraham which he had yet being uncircumcised so Abraham had God's righteousness even though he didn't have the seal yet see even if you're not born again or wherever you are with God even if you are born again think about when you weren't born again you were already given Jesus's righteousness when you got saved praise God but really before the foundation World God already had it for you praise God you just recognize it when you got saved Hallelujah praise God what a blessing I want to emphasize this Abraham is the father is your father because you walk in a similar step as Abraham can everybody see that who also but who also walk in the steps of that Faith of Our Father Abraham so in Abraham's life we see a walk of faith and you see that same walk in your life see and remember Brotherhood said the three works of Grace were typed in Abraham's life praise God Genesis 12 was his justification Abraham come out from among them come into a place that I've separated you unto amen that was justification and then sanctification was he had to separate from lot right he had to get uh more about the Covenant in Genesis 15. and it wasn't until Genesis 17 that he actually got the seal so he was saved in 12 right Justified and then 13 14 15 16 at the beginning of 17 for five chapters he's going through there's five sanctification amen Grace amen hallelujah and then in the Genesis at the end of Genesis 17 he gets the Seal of the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God ah and then in Genesis chapter 21 he gets a body change Hallelujah and he brings forth Christ Hallelujah that's the type of the Rapture amen oh the body change amen hallelujah so we see the three works of grace and the Rapture in Abraham's life that's the steps you're walking into you're walking the same steps of the faith of your spiritual Father Abraham you're walking in justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost body change for a rapture Glory Hallelujah these are a couple these are a couple of charts here I just want to show now when he went from herb child Dees to Heron it was 600 miles he traveled and then 50 miles South about I'm sorry Euros 50 50 miles south of Babylon now when he went to shecham it was 400 more miles and then we went to Bethel it was 20 more miles and that's where he built his first altar when he separated himself now so far look at the miles this man's traveled over a thousand miles that's a type now Austin how many miles was it to Arizona do you remember 2 400. so this guy reminds us of Abraham tonight boy is that it traveled a lot because God was moving him from place to place he had to have faith because God was calling him to travel and then sometimes he made mistakes and he traveled but God would call him back that's a that's a type of you and I making a decision it wasn't the right decision but God in his grace brings us back praise God to her sometimes it could be a long road back and the church said sometimes it can feel like a long way I got to go all the way here to get back with God sometimes you do praise God sometimes God's path you know sometimes to get back on God's path it seems like a long road but if you're a child of Abraham you'll reach that destination Hallelujah and praise God and then remember he went down to Egypt that was outside the will of God that was 225 miles now church he wasn't flying Southwest Airlines he wasn't driving in a Tesla this was walking now look he now think about that he walked 225 miles out of God's will sometimes church let me say like this sometimes we'll go 225 days out of God's will listen I had a friend in the message confessed to me I'm not going to try to give many details because I don't want anybody it's not this church I love my people I don't I just want to encourage you this friend said they've been out of the will of God I think it was for the last five years because they were trying to get worldly riches and I I don't know how much more I should go they were trying to be more I can say like this they're trying to be more comfortable in this world and they said they got out of the perfect will of God and into the permissive will of God and while they were chasing those better conditions better life conditions it their spiritual life suffered with them and their children and I say that with all the love and due respect and everything like that so C Church what I'm saying is that they can still be children of Abraham because sometimes you and I might disobey for months at a time or years at a time right 225 miles let's go Sarah come on let's in other words he said let's get out of the will of God come on let's let's go let's get in the permissible of God come on sir now Church think about if a pastor let think about if I led you out of the perfect will of God by preaching something false how many pastors have done that brother many and for years churches can get out of the will of God until God graciously brings them back we might not go 225 miles we might go 225 days and the church said the Bible said that you also walk in the steps of Father Abraham we all walk in the steps of Father Abraham now back remember he left there he lied to King the Pharaoh he had to come back 225 more miles he had to come back same way same thing you left you had to come right back to it and then he had to go to memory and Hebron which is 35 miles and then he went to hobot which was 160 miles and then from there he went to mammary 100 more miles and then he went to Greer that was uh 40 miles and then from Greer to Bathsheba they don't list the miles there but then he went to Mount Moriah to sacrifice Isaac that was 55 miles and then back to Beersheba 55 more miles and then back to Hebron and his death 30 miles and again church that was walking or riding a camel or you know because remember his servant Elisa had camels to go get Rebecca riding a camel This Ain't Easy Living that's a that's not a lot of fun now some of these were good steps some of these were God ordained travels like awesome testified it was God's ordade ordination he had to get to Arizona to find Lena and he had to realize he had to learn all those lessons out in Arizona right brother it was God's will sometimes the only way to learn lessons is to disobey and we've all done it praise God so it's a great example of your faith you got the faith of Abraham brother you came all the way back to where you left God hallelujah praise God so did I I left god with worldly music so how'd I come back I had to come back through Christian music amen Hallelujah Wherever You Lead God that's where you got to go back and get him now look I put these red dots and I know this is really blurry but this was the best one I could find here he Abraham's called to serve God at 75 but remember he only partially obeyed so I put these red dots when he made some mistakes he only partially obeyed he took lot with him he wasn't supposed to take a lot with him right sometimes church we can get saved and we just make we just make the wrong decisions right after we got saved right my goodness he's given the Covenant there when he gets saved okay then he Journeys through Kane into and then uh then he he leaves once he gets there to Canaan there's a drought he leaves and goes down into Egypt that was a big mistake he lied to the king to the pharaoh remember City cowardly lied didn't protect his wife like he should have he was trying to protect his own life church we all do that sometimes all we think about is ourselves sometimes we'll do anything we'll lie we're cheat we'll steal we'll do anything to protect ourselves for being exposed that's just like Abraham and you walk in the steps I should have heard at least one Amen on that right we all do it amen I'll say Amen if nobody else wants to say I say Amen sometimes we protect me all three protect is number one we just take care of ourselves we all do it no one's perfect no one will brag in heaven say I never cared about myself I always served everybody else I never put myself first nobody will brag and say that we all fall short of God's glory right but then he came back okay he went up to Bethel what's the next things that happened uh he separated from a lot there's that sanctification he's starting I just can't serve god with this foolish version I've got to be with just message Believers I've got to be with just Believers of like Precious Faith praise God amen I've got to separate from the bullish virgin I've got to leave my denominational church I've got to join the message Church praise God I do that now look and then his lot gets captured he had to go fight and win a battle with the five Kings and then he meets Melchizedek on the way back and has communion that's where he started communion amen hallelujah hallelujah praise God now look he met Jesus he met Melchizedek he had communion but he wasn't born again that's a good type we talked about sister that's a good time see some people say you can only have communion when you're officially born again well it doesn't even work in the type it doesn't work he had type he had the Holy Ghost I'm sorry he had communion before he got the Holy Ghost over here got the circumcision here and the church said didn't the uh didn't the disciples have communion with Jesus on the night of his arrest were they born again what'd the church say no they weren't born again they are communion with Jesus before they were born again and see it's because people misunderstand the quote brother says you got to be born again to have communion that's before you had the Revelation that born again and the Holy Ghost baptism are one of the same hallelujah praise God amen and then after he wins the battle he wins his brother back he wins his brother from the world saves him out of the world then God shows him the Covenant remember that that was a beautiful Covenant remember he had to shoot all the birds away he started casting out Devils Brother Ray Hallelujah he speak to the devil you know shoot those evil birds away remember him so that's a type of casting out devils God had to put Abraham asleep and remember the furnace of the fire passed by remember that that represented hell but remember said God was showing Abraham you're worthy of hell but something died for you remember he killed and separated all those clean beasts he was showing him I'm making a covenant with you you had nothing to do with it I'm putting you to sleep well I'm gonna make a promise to you I'm Gonna Save you and all your seed all your Offspring by the blood hallelujah oh my God I'm saving you from the furnace of fire I'm saving you from hell because you're mine I chose you praise God oh that's a covenant praise God hallelujah that's a covenant hallelujah praise God amen but what does he do not right after that he lets his wife talk him into Marin Hagar lust of the flesh churches are he's already met Melchizedek he's met Melchizedek he's met God in flesh but he lets his wife talk him into taking another wife of course a concubine and boy what did that produce wild man still to this day Children of the Bond woman not of the free woman and they persecute they always persecute the true seed of God so right there church there's three big mistakes he's made but look he's got pretty good testimony he's got he's got more good than bad I already got more good than bad in your life amen hallelujah thank God Amen you know it you know you got more good than bad Hallelujah because you're walking in the faith right think about that most of the day we're walking by Grace walking obedience but then maybe once a day we fall shorter two three times we fall short what are you doing you're walking in the same steps that Abraham walked in and then ishmael's born okay and then now we get to Genesis 17. God uh God brings a covenant circumcision and what does Abraham do he goes out and he circumcised Ishmael he says oh let Ishmael live before you and then God visits him and says Abraham I'm going to give you a son from Sarah and Abraham laughs he laughs at God he said oh God that's a good one that's real good that's the Bible we read it Genesis 17 17. he laughed at God I think he fell on his face it was so funny and unbelievable he fell on his face 1717. then Abraham fell yeah let's read 15 and God said in Abraham as for Sarai thy wife Thou shalt not call her name Sarah I but Sarah shall be your name and I'll bless her and give thee a son also of her yea I will bless her and she shall be a mother of Nations Kings of people shall be of her then Abraham fell in his face and laughed and said in his heart shall be born unto him that is 100 years old and shall Sarah that is 90 years old bear he gets thus save the Lord and he laughs about it he's 99 years old and he's still laughing at God's promise God had already told him 25 24 years ago your seed is going to be like the stars of heaven and he thought oh through Ishmael he says God said no I'm doing it through Sarah and Abraham laughed to God I put a red mark for laughing at God's promise because God got the last laugh [Applause] it means laughter God God turned their laughing from mocking to Joy praise God Hallelujah they went from mocking and laughing a disbelief a laugh of unbelief and then God gives him a laugh of Joy hallelujah oh God has made me happy God 's made me glad Church you know sometimes it's hard to believe God's going to Rapture our church out of all the churches in Akron Austin visited some pretty beautiful Church haven't you brother in the last few weeks right pretty beautiful Church stained glass windows I visited some too over the years boy Brother Ray and then come to our place and you think God's going to Rapture this people yes Hallelujah yes amen I praise God why why in our hearts we might laugh or battled unbeliever or something like that but when the word of God comes down to who believes the word who's preaching the true revelation of God's word then we've got the best chance we've got the best possibility we've got thus hate the Lord praise God amen that's what the Bible says the dead in Christ shall rise for us and then we which are alive and remain Shall be Called together to meet them in the air and I heard Brothers say today and take insides with Jesus brother said let's live like the Rapture is going to be today he said but it might be in 100 Years bro right he said it might be 500 years and then he said it might be 10 000 years look it up because I I did a screenshot on my phone to make sure I was telling the truth look it up he said the Rapture might be in 100 years well that would be 2062 we're coming up to that hahaha Hallelujah in other words let's just be ready for the Rapture praise God it's thus saying the Lord the Rapture is going to happen and we've got to believe we're a part of it just like Abraham had to believe I'm in the plan of God I'm in the program of God I'm walking in the steps of Abraham praise God amen so he laughed he left he laughed at God it didn't uh throw God off God wasn't like oh he's laughing at me God's like I knew You're gonna laugh but I'm greater than your unbelief right faith my faith is greater than your unbelief everybody's gone amen like brother Adam said unbelief does not hinder God hallelujah when the unbelief of a Believer doesn't hinder God God's will will be accomplished praise God Amen nobody can stop God even Abraham's laughter could stop God even Ishmael couldn't stop God nothing will stop God and then what's next in Genesis 18 God Appears himself Hallelujah and Abraham said Abraham's waiting for him under the tree in the plains he's just waiting for God I know God's going to show up I know he's going to show up I'm 99 years old God promised me I know he's going to show up and as soon as those three Messengers come the Bible said he runs out to meet them Hallelujah God is here God's spirit is visiting I've got a visitation from God he says Sarah go uh go kill the fatted cow go get some meat ready go make some bread ready God's here let's wash his feet praise God Church don't you know when God's spirit comes in here and you start praying or you start worshiping God you start crying or somebody starts jumping what you're doing is you're you're welcoming God you're entertaining God hallelujah when we start dancing around and praising God that's what we're doing we're entertaining God God is here amen I'm just making him feel welcome we're just watching his feet praise God as we prayed over here tonight with my tears running on my face that's the same as washing his feet it's the same yeah when you raise your hands or you shout hallelujah or you say thank you Jesus you're washing his feet yeah you're kissing the sun lest he be angry let's make Jesus for your welcome Hallelujah every time we come to church it don't matter who's here or who's not here Jesus is here praise God that's what matters Hallelujah amen Hallelujah so Jesus comes and meets him and then that's a time when Sarah laughed Sarah's behind him in the tent and God said I'll visit you next year about this time and Sarah will have a child and the Bible said Sarah laughed I'm 90 years old then God said why'd you laugh she said I didn't laugh God said you did laugh she's like she lied to God laughed to God and she was still a child of God hallelujah Church don't let the devil beat you down with guilt just say Lord I'm sorry forgive me my sins I'm still a child of God just like Abraham and Sarah praise God right I'm just trying to overcome unbelief I'm trying to overcome all these battles I'm trying to believe in miracles praise God I'm a man I believe in God's a miracle worker I may not be able to see it yet but I believe it praise God amen Hallelujah her laughter her disbelief doesn't hinder God neither does ours how about a high five brother I said how about a high five buddy glory amen our unbelief our mind battles our failures does not hinder God God will bring his promise to pass Hallelujah amen thank you Jesus and then the Angels go down to Sodom and what did Abraham do sister who he went to intercessory prayer he said God if there's 50 in the city spirit God said I'll do that Lord there's 40. Abraham must have knew there wasn't many Believers down there God said I'll do it if there's 30. I'll do it God there's 20 I'll do it Lord please forgive me I can ask one more time if there's 10 will you save it now look at his intercession there he didn't stop praying after one prayer church we got to keep praying isn't that just isn't that a perfect example Jesus said the like the the widow woman keep knocking Abraham didn't knock once and say can I have 50. he said with everybody's he keeps going on he keeps knocking we got to keep praying listen Church nobody else in Akron is praying like we're praying we're praying for the last Souls the last seed the last person to get the Holy Ghost for God to pour out his fear so we can go in the Rapture we've got to keep praying praise God amen I believe we've got at least a few years away because all my children got to get the Holy Ghost before I'm going that's just my humble request I don't have thou say the Lord but Abraham but Moses took all everything everything that it was in Egypt Moses took it out in that Exodus so I'm believing by God's grace there won't be one hoof left behind in my family I'm I cannot believe that I'm like I'm like Moses praise God Glory Hallelujah so are you we're the people of God Glory amen I like that praise God I'm going to believe that Hallelujah so he intercedes and then in the very next portions we see him lying to King abimelech the Philistine King he lies and said Sarah's not my wife Sarah's my sister Church he's already had God to visit him how many times chapter 12 chapter 15 17 18. God has given him four visitations and he still lies he still lies he's still afraid of his life he's in that moment he's more afraid of the king than he is God right because he got caught in the flesh he got a spirit of fear on him but what overcomes fear power love and a sound mind in church it's just so amazing one day I hope God gives me the Revelation this at all the end of that lie God has abimelech pray or God God has God says abimelech Abraham has to pray for you to get the curse off your family but it was it was Abraham's fault that caused that curse to come Abraham's Abraham's unbelief caused the curse to come upon abimelech and pharaoh Abraham's mistake caused the trouble but Abraham's got to pray to get the trouble off them now somebody explained that to me I believe it I believe it but it just seems so strange sure and brothers said that's where God is God has predestination that shows God has ordained each one of his servants and giving them favor praise God bye now the next chapter Isaac's born in Genesis 21. Hallelujah the promised son is born they got a body change that's the type of the Rapture praise God it is Hallelujah chapter 22 God said go sacrifice the most precious thing to you now think about that I preached this years ago and didn't know what I was preaching way way long time ago last week was our 17th anniversary of our church brother last last Sunday but I think it was in like the third or fourth year I preached this where Abraham had to sacrifice the thing dearest to him and there was somebody in the church that was moving and the person that was staying that was their best friend moving they lost in other words the person in our church lost their best friend and I preached that right at the time when that person needed that they they in other words in other words they had to let that person go they couldn't sulk they couldn't cry about it they couldn't be discouraged about it God was testing them right sometimes God will test us do you love me more than something and you you put it there what do you love the most what do you cherish the most in your life your family your friends you know what and sometimes God will say I want to see what do you love more me or this other thing this other person and guess what he passed the test amen this person our church passed the test Hallelujah they told me about it as a testimony I didn't even know what I was preaching but see he's already Justified saying divided he's already got the Holy Ghost and God said I'm still going to test you to see what do you love most obedience or some other thing in life and you can put it in there put whatever you want in there what do you love more obeying God's word or His blessings more we ought to obey obedience more than all things that way you're a child of Abraham that way you know okay not long after that I'm sorry then Sarah dies she was 127 he was 137. now church this is amazing and then he goes and seeks a wife for Isaac that's a type of brother Branham right the messenger I'm sorry the servant being sent out to get a bride for Isaac so look we have two types of the Rapture in here brother I've never seen that till tonight you got the Rapture and the body change here when Isaac's born yep yeah there and he got the type of the servant the messenger going out to get a bride for Isaac ah that's beautiful praise God thank you thank God thank God for an Ali easer and thank God for a Rebecca praise God you're the Rebecca praise God you're the Rebecca Hallelujah like I love that song Ellie easer tell me more yeah what's Isaac really look like yeah I love that song I love that song praise God Ellie Easter tell me more brother Brandon tell me more what's Jesus really look like that's what he looks like Hallelujah tell me more about Jesus amen tell me what he is tell me more about his character tell me about his faithfulness tell me how he'll save me praise God he'll Rapture me praise God I will forgive me how do you love me praise God brother man tell me more about Jesus Christ Our Lord amen thank God church and then after Isaac gets married he marries Katura and he has more more Sons I think he got three more Sons six more five more Sons but what's amazing about all that church is that the Bible said even before he had Isaac his inward parts were dead he could he was past the age of having children so the Holy Ghost anointing the body change that he got a lot of that power remained for the rest of his life because Brother Ray he didn't go back to being dead in his loins oh the power of the seed oh my goodness he got a body change and the power of the seed remained can I say like this the power of the seed in your soul will remain after the Rapture praise God thank God Amen the power of the Holy Ghost is permanent hallelujah it's eternal life you'll never separate from eternal life once you're born again you've got God's own life Hallelujah ah the power of the seed the Bible said he was dead in his loins but even after God Isaac the seed power remained body change lasted going Hallelujah Glory thank you Jesus the seed was forever changed I didn't even catch that till now praise God Hallelujah in other words I'm sealed and that life remains until the day of redemption praise God again he preaches with this thing on praise God I've been having so much Freedom tonight I can already keep this thing off raise God oh the life of God in your soul when it's quickened the quickening power remains Hallelujah oh in other words a life in the seed of God in your soul will keep you through your next trial it will keep you all the way to the Rapture praise God and it's going to be with you even when you get a glorified body praise God ah Hallelujah some Holy Ghost anointing in here tonight by God's grace amen Hallelujah he finally dies at 175. um destruct me God called him at 75 he died at 175 that's 100 years that's a hundredfold reward [Laughter] it wasn't 30 years it was in 60 years it was a hundredfold Hallelujah ah thank you Jesus help us to live a life of a hundredfold service to Jesus Christ praise God Hallelujah Hallelujah God help me to so invest in your word that it brings forth the hundredfold increase that everybody can see my look at the increase I see the fruit of God I see the blessings of God all over the sister's life all over our sisters all over our brothers God grant it that will have a hundredfold blessing upon Our Lives amen that our impact will go grow way much more than a 30 or 60. our influence will go to a hundredfold Hallelujah even the world Fallen apart you still live such a life that the testimony people can't deny your testimony praise God amen Abraham a hundredfold how about that how about that praise God and church what do you have to do travel all those miles Hallelujah sometimes Church Life can seem like a lot of miles but I bet Abraham was singing as he's walking those 225 miles just a few more weary days and then fly away oh to a home on God Celestial Shore ah come on Sarah I'll Fly Away they just sing all the time they're walking oh my with every mile the promise got sweeter with every year God's promise gets sweeter to us amen oh God they didn't mind walking the miles because God gave a new body change amen God give them New Life praise God we can make it through our trials because God gives us new life praise God oh my God we could not have made it through our life trials without the Holy Ghost we never would have made it unless God gave us the Covenant praise God to make it the Sea of circumcision to make it praise God hahaha I can hardly get through two scriptures tonight I thought I was going to finish the chapter tonight I'm barely not gonna do that thank God though God's in it praise God that's how you know God's in it my plans I always want my plans to fail praise God for the promise that Abraham should be heir of the world heir of the world was not to Abraham or to the Sea don't the Bible say the meek shall inherit the earth church let those people have the Yachts now let them have the vacation homes now they're only going to enjoy it for a few years but we get it for a thousand years praise God let them have it now let them make make it look like they're living something now they're living under distress they got to get drunk or get high all the time just to avoid uh the the hounds of hell that are chasing after them but we can worship God we can praise God we can know our blessing is in time to come praise God we'll rejoice in the future praise God we inherit the earth we get the Earth they get sent to prison but we inherit the earth We Rule and reign with Christ for a thousand years praise God blessed are the meek we shall inherit the earth Hallelujah the promise that he should be heir of the world hahaha Hallelujah I can't wait to see brother Ray's portion on the Earth hey brother hey can I come over I don't have to get on a cell phone I can just talk to him like right now I got a walkie-talkie but really we'll have a spiritual walkie-talkie I'll be like a channel to Brother Ray but already mind if I come over for a little bit yes sir I'll come right over hey everybody show me around your place man what what what portion how's the ruling going praise God how's the ruling how's the ruling and reigning going are you raining okay are you ruining okay you'll be like Yeah by God's grace I got this Rod of iron right here all the inhabitants of the world right here in my portion they're they're obedient to me by God's grace I'll say that's the same for me brother same for me heir of the world Hallelujah in other words we rule and reign with Christ for a thousand years This Promise was not to Abraham or to his seed through the law through all the works of the law but through the righteousness of faith now think about that promises are just received by what faith or Revelation which is also trust or assurance Abraham knew he'd inherit the world because he trusted God that's all he didn't work his way into it oh this time I'm not going to lie I lied last time to Pharaoh I'm not going to lie to abimelech and then I'll inherit the earth no it was that wasn't the case he failed again the guy still says you're my child amen you're going to inherit the earth you'll overcome that lion Spirit pretty soon by God's grace thank you I made a way you can overcome that I've already made the way for you I'm predestinated you to be an heir of the world praise God you'll overcome Because I Said So amen amen think about that you had to overcome a lying Spirit a coward spear a spirit of fear and maybe lust with Hagar I don't know who knows but he should not have taken her right God never told him to do that he overcame all that through what just through well God I'm going to do a better job today God you remember you're really going to see I do a better job today now church we want to do better we should do better but we can never earn the promise it's just given to us amen like a gift is just given to us I didn't ask for the gift it was just given to me that's what it was given to Abraham Hallelujah I think of that song Blessed assurance Jesus is mine over the foretaste of Glory to rhyme I'm an heir of Salvation purchase of God I'm born of a spirit washing his blood that's my Blessed Assurance amen Jesus is born amen Hallelujah what a blessing what a promise it's just my your Assurance trust in God I believe what God Said I believe what God Said brother Ram said the reason God gave gifts of the Holy Spirit and dreams and Visions is to give us more confidence in God's word brother Adam said God gave us the promise in the Bible brother answered that should be enough brother I said if I was God that'd be enough he said but God is so merciful not only does he give us the promises in the word he'll give us tongues and interpretation he'll give us Gifts of wisdom Gifts of knowledge the nine gifts of the holy spirit praise God and on top of that brother said then God will speak to people like Joseph and Mary in dreams and God does all that to make sure that his elect believe him praise God in other words God is going to make sure you believe his promise praise God he won't let you miss his promise he's going to make sure you receive the promise praise God in other words he's fighting for me brother Ray God's goodness is chasten after you sister who sisters there God's goodness is running after you praise God it's running after you brother Austin I'm telling you man it's chasing you down praise God God is chasing you down I'm going to bless you brother I'm going to bless you Hallelujah that's what the Bible says I'm gonna chase him down the thing is why why am I running from God that's the main thing yeah that's what that's what Deuteronomy says if you obey this the blessings will chase after you come on I want to bless you that's what God's going to do in your life I tell you I really enjoy when the blessings catch up to me praise God I really like to do a little dance and praise the Lord say thank you Jesus thank you Lord amen I like that praise God glory and they will catch up to you praise God now this reminded me of this so see we got to show some diligence Paul desired every one of you show the same diligence to the full Assurance of Hope unto the end be not slothful so see let's not be lazy you're not lazy because you come to church tonight there's a lot of people not in our church but there's a lot of people in other churches that could go to church but they sit at home instead well I'm just going to live stream it ain't the same unless you're totally consecrated and praying and fasting you're going to get caught up in your home life unless you're really devoted to God that's right Hallelujah the church we're not we're not slothful we're not lazy but we're followers of them who through faith and patience inherit the promise church if we need healing just look look at brother Ram's example you can look at any Bible example but look at brother Ram every seven years you get sick and he cry to God for healing and then God right then of his life heals him and Brogan thanks God for it now he doesn't know he's going to pass at that certain time he kind of knew he would there's quotes where it says like he knew he's going to pass soon but he still thank God for the healing so we should take courage from that God might let me go through trials he might let me suffer and things like that but I can trust God he's going to heal me someday praise God let's have faith like people that have had testimonies before us let's learn from their testimonies let's grow in our faith praise God Hallelujah for when God made promise to who the same one we're talking about Abraham because he could swear by no greater he swear by himself thank you Father saying surely I Will Bless thee and multiplying I will multiply thee God said it and so after he had patiently endured Abraham obtained the promise [Music] he was patient my laughter mom sister who come on Sarah come on let's go we got only got 50 more miles to go let's go come on we're gonna inherit the promise let's keep going just 25 more miles Malachi let's keep going don't give up just keep trusting in God just a few more weary miles and then we'll fly away just keep trusting God just patiently wait upon God and you will inherit the promise how many believe that see we have to be patient with God we have to trust God brother Ram said this about John the Baptist he said sometimes God will train a man for 30 years for six months of ministry six months is like that here we are six months in 2023 it's been like that I'm like it's already halfway through the year Lydia already graduated high school what wait wait what she's already graduated what how it happened and for 30 years three decades John the Baptist had to be trained watching the serpents the locusts cutting down trees here to be taught it observed nature to sleep out in nature he had to wear camel skins he had 30 years of training just for six months of ministry and Jesus said there's never been a man born of a wound greater than John the Baptist it's not the quantity again it's the quality amen praise God hallelujah it's the quality of your walk with God that matters the Bible said he didn't do one Miracle Brother Ray so that means he was greater than Moses and Moses did all those miracles Moses was such a great man he said I'm going to raise up a prophet like unto him which was Jesus but Jesus said John the Baptist is greater because of his obedience that must be obedience the word of God where to see John the Baptist murdered anybody where you see John the Baptist failing to circumcise children and like Moses he was going to die for that church he's going to die where does he Moses where do you see John the Baptist glorifying himself Moses said you bunch of rebels I'll fetch you water on this rock I'll do Miracles myself and God said no you're not going the promised land because of that all John did was preach the word repent be nice repent be baptized I baptize you and then he says Behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world follow him praise God that's all I did he said I must decrease Christ must increase amen that's what we need today we need Jesus Christ to increase in our lives amen Hallelujah I want to see where I wanted to get to here let's see it's already 8 30. let me um Hallelujah I know about kill myself I feel I pray so hard I feel like I could just lay in bed all day Thursday I just get caught up in the Holy Spirit you know by God's grace Bible say we have to be a sacrifice present your bodies a Living Sacrifice to Christ verse 13 so we did that let me just go through this part here by God's grace now verse 14 for if they which are of the law be heirs faith is made void so if you can inherit if you can work your way to righteousness then faith we don't need faith like I heard brother Ramsay all right brother say this uh Rhode Ram said I have no power to heal brother said no man has the power to heal he said if you did he said that negates Calvary now think about that brother Ray Jefferson bill says the tapes are the absolute absolute means Unlimited in power brother Ram said so that's what that's what Webster's Dictionary says and brother Adam comes out on the tape that's what I show the contradiction they say every word is absolute every word is powerless I'm sorry powerful unlimited power and then Brothers says by his own words I have no power so how can the taste be the absolute if the one speaking on tape doesn't have any power can't be right my lover brother says I don't have power to heal if I did I'd heal everybody he said no man has any power for to heal if you've got power you took away Calvary well that means Calvary still has the power Amen in other words trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ is the only source for power Hallelujah let's trust in the Lamb of God let's trust in the shed Blood let's trust in the healing powers of the Holy Spirit praise God but he even says quote I'm powerless end quote they're saying he every word he said is unlimited power and brother man says I'm powerless now who are we going to believe Jefferson Bill or brother Bradham I'm gonna be brother Brandon on this one Hallelujah now who's really saying what the tapes say we are we're the ones saying what the tapes say praise God I've heard preachers even say this uh this week it's so sad they say oh all the tapes are even a preacher here in Ohio uh not locally here they're not not in this side of the state but they said every word on tape is uh is the absolute they said this message is the absolute every word on tape and they make the statement that don't even tell me there's a contradiction on on the tapes or there's a mistake on the tapes they said that's garbage to my ears why are you putting garbage in my ears I'm like who does this person even listen to the tapes that's why that's what I wonder do they even listen to the tapes I think they just listen to other preachers and how they get people to shout and they actually don't even listen to the tapes because I can't even go one tape without finding brother and making a human mistake but that's okay God look past his mistakes just like God look past Abraham's mistakes just like God will look past your mistakes and you're still a child of Abraham praise God brother I'm still a prophet amen he never made a mistake with thus say the Lord he just made mistakes with human mistakes like we all do his thus saith the Lord was invaluable but other than that he was a man he was fallible just like all of us just like all the Seed of Abraham praise God you know sister who as time goes on all these seeds are manifesting their fruit we're really finding out what people's fruit is I'm glad because I like to know what I like everybody know what fruit I got praise God because I believe the word of God but I'm not a William Brandon worshiper no Hallelujah brother Austin I'm a right down the middle of the road holy ghost-filled Saint praise God I take as much of the met I take Brothers coach as much as I can I take it from the Bible as much as I can I gotta balance right down the middle praise God but I see all these preachers even I mean the the tape guys are way over here on the extreme every word is not say the Lord but some of the preachers are going that way too just believe every word on the taper who are you to correct it ain't me that's correct in anything it's the holy ghost that finds Corrections Hallelujah hallelujah it's the Holy Ghost in us that finds Corrections when brother makes a human mistake it's the holy ghost that points that off it points it out so we can see it by God's grace Hallelujah thank the Lord Church Hallelujah I know where I stand by God's grace Hallelujah I've got this Brother Ray of over 85 just mistakes brother I made on tape not without say Lord just humor mistakes like he said uh like you said one place he said Enoch served God for 500 years the Bible says 365. brother Ram said women have sperm well we know that's not true they just got eggs I mean just simple things like that and preachers will have the audacity to say you got to believe everything on the tapes or you're it's garbage if there's contradiction on the tapes you must not be listening then that exposes you are not a listener you've exposed that your ears cannot hear right where is your discernment brother answer the two we need for this day is discernment of the Holy Ghost praise God to be able to judge between God's word and human opinions yeah yeah they said brothers did you prophesy that a million black people will die by Martin Luther King Jr but I said no he said I have nothing on it from the Lord that's just my opinion and they can't hear that sister who sisters oh they can't hear it because all they do is worship brother man worship around yet they they claim to believe the message I'm sorry the Holy Ghost will not worship brother Branham the Holy Ghost will only worship Jesus Christ a lot of the churches I don't care how emotional a preacher is the Holy Ghost will only magnify Jesus Christ praise God right the Holy Ghost will honor every Prophet every man or woman of God the Holy Ghost there's no respect to our persons with God right but the Holy Ghost will only worship and magnify Jesus Christ I'm gonna stop right there let's stand musicians can come here I better stop right there I'm just going to keep going here by God's grace Hallelujah let's just take one more all right let's just I just remember the promises of God briefly here Saints let me just say this in closing the righteousness of Jesus Christ comes on all those who walk in the steps of the Faith of Our Father Abraham now just by looking at Abraham's life briefly how many are encouraged that God still loves you how many are encourage that you're walking just like Abraham did Abraham had his UPS Abraham's had his Downs Abraham had his partial obedences and then he had his complete obedences Hallelujah in church God was building his faith look how his faith grew I didn't get to where I wanted to go tonight that's okay got it I guess I got where God wanted me to go but by the end of his life he can be willing to obey God so much to kill his son Isaac and believe God's going to resurrect him right there that's how much his faith grew now that's talk about being strong in the faith so early in his life he was afraid of dying at the hands of Kings like pharaoh at the end of his life he has so much Faith he could believe he could kill his own son and God would raise him up right there probably after three days amen probably after three days just like Christ Hallelujah amen he probably saw a vision of the Cross amen and he saw he saw the Seed of Abraham Jesus Christ then Rising on the third day he said well if he rose Isaac will rise praise God because he's a prophet the Bible said he knew that's a good rise if he died amen hallelujah my goodness thank you Jesus amen he's looking experience of dimensions and he's seeing Revelations and he had such faith God made him so strong at the end of his life and let me say like this church despite our trials God is going to make us so strong he can Rapture us praise God amen it'll be God doing it not us it'll be God doing it praise God we just gotta walk in the steps of Abraham confess our wrongs and keep believing keep believing keep walking in promise with God how many will walk in the promises of God let's bow our heads here for a word of Prayer Hallelujah Lord Jesus I thank you for tonight truly we feel the anointing of the Holy Ghost here tonight Lord God it's a special anointing dear God hallelujah thank you for the revelations of your word Lord God Hallelujah thank you Jesus Lord we want to walk in the steps of Our Father Abraham Lord we look at our lives honestly and we can say Amen sometimes we obey all the ways sometimes we partially obey sometimes we just flat out laugh at God's word flat out disbelief but yet Lord you never gave up on Abraham Hallelujah because you swore by yourself hallelujah amen hallelujah we swear by no greater so you swore by yourself and you couldn't break your promise it was an unconditional promise hey Hallelujah and Lord so have you giving us a promise a testament in the blood of Jesus Christ thank you Jesus Hallelujah Lord work grateful to see how the Holy Spirit helps us to walk like Abraham thank you for justification sanctification the baptisms of the Holy Ghost we're looking for a body change dear God hallelujah we recognize that any easers come Lord God hallelujah thank you Jesus for a hundredfold blessing Lord God we're looking to be stronger in faith giving you glory Lord God Hallelujah Jesus thank you for thy mercy thank you for thy Grace may we walk with you today Lord God help us to patiently walk with you and We'll Inherit the promises all the promises of God in Jesus Christ name Saint said oh let's let's thank God tonight right
