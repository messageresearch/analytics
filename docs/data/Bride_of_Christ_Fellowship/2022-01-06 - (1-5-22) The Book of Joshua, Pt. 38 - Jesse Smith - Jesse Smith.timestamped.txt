[21:04] for coming i'm gonna pay him like he's
[21:06] preaching too you know but i'm only
[21:07] gonna have him preach one
[21:09] okay so you can rest so really pull on
[21:10] that maybe he'll preach two hours like i
[21:12] do sometimes you know so
[21:14] but that is january 16th that's my
[21:16] wife's birthday too her 25th birthday by
[21:18] the way
[21:19] that's her joke so maybe she's listening

[21:25] so she was she's a jokester you know
[21:30] so we certainly uh look forward to
[21:32] brother ben coming and hope it'll be a
[21:34] i'm sure it'll be a wonderful uh
[21:36] wonderful uh time remember he had
[21:38] coveted really bad this last fall but
[21:40] god he was near death and god brought
[21:42] him back so we're very thankful for that
[21:45] and he's been a diabetic for years so he
[21:46] was able god really pulled him through
[21:49] you know pre-existing conditions are the
[21:51] worst
[21:52] but god really pulled him through so i
[21:53] look forward to hearing that testimony
[21:55] how god brought him through
[21:58] so i believe that's it for
[22:01] as far as announcements or updates uh
[22:03] yeah in february we'll start back up the
[22:05] two services and the bible studies
[22:07] and genevieve and eden you're next to
[22:09] choose the song so just be ready i'm
[22:11] giving you plenty advanced notice
[22:13] uh choose the songs for those
[22:15] uh those sunday school or you know yeah
[22:18] it's kind of like sunday school lessons
[22:20] so look forward to that i don't have a
[22:21] preacher for february yet i may take it
[22:23] off you know we may i think we need to
[22:24] save up a little bit so
[22:26] i'll try to pray about that
[22:29] i have brother dennis mcbride coming in
[22:31] april though i'm gonna have brother
[22:32] dennis back he has been just been such a
[22:34] good friend and uh every time he comes
[22:36] it just feels like it preaches right to
[22:38] me so i want to have him back and i'm
[22:40] praying about also uh which brothers to
[22:42] invite for our june anniversary meetings
[22:45] you know it's hard it's hard to believe
[22:46] it goes that that fast you know we'll
[22:48] we'll blink and it'll be you know
[22:50] anniversary time as well 16 years by
[22:53] god's grace
[22:54] so i'm praying about that and just want
[22:56] to get the leading of the lord
[22:58] it's been awesome you know when i heard
[23:00] naomi's testimony on new year's eve
[23:01] night and some of your other testimonies
[23:02] about the different preachers that just
[23:04] it does so much to me to know that god
[23:07] put it on my heart to invite the right
[23:08] preacher at the right time because i'm
[23:10] nothing right but i just love to see how
[23:12] it works out for god's glory
[23:14] you know they could have come at any
[23:15] time but god had a certain time
[23:17] for me to call them and work it out and
[23:20] i just love to see god's hand in it you
[23:22] know because it
[23:23] that just proves god orders our
[23:25] footsteps and if we just pray before
[23:27] everything just pray before we invite
[23:29] somebody or you know that's me but you
[23:31] pray before you do anything
[23:32] and watch god just direct our steps
[23:35] that's the beauty that that's that's
[23:36] inquiring of the lord the bible calls it
[23:39] right and that's what we should
[23:40] constantly do pray before
[23:42] every decision praise god so i'm excited
[23:45] you know and thankful
[23:47] and the more i preach the more i love
[23:49] jesus praise god the more i preach the
[23:50] more i want to study the bible more you
[23:51] know and and preach the word of god and
[23:53] you're the best audience i could ask for
[23:55] praise god you're so patient you love me
[23:57] you love me you're patient with me and
[23:58] you pull on the word and
[24:00] people come in here and feel the love of
[24:02] god and that means more than anything to
[24:04] me that means
[24:06] the world to me that people can feel the
[24:07] love of jesus christ
[24:09] and they experience the presence of god
[24:12] here where they may not experience it
[24:13] other places so god bless you let's stay
[24:16] humble let's be thankful but let's stay
[24:17] humble
[24:18] we need god's grace more and more all
[24:20] the time praise god
[24:22] so let's uh look to the lord here uh
[24:24] joshua 24 31 now
[24:28] i have a few main thoughts i want to get
[24:30] to here with this maybe last sermon or
[24:32] maybe second to last i just want to
[24:34] briefly and i kind of did this a few
[24:36] wednesdays ago but let's remember some
[24:37] of these new testament lessons that we
[24:39] learned
[24:40] i'll go through this quickly
[24:42] your spiritual strength that you choose
[24:45] to have will guarantee your spiritual
[24:48] success
[24:50] right but you have to choose each day
[24:52] i'm going to be strong today
[24:54] and when you do that as paul said
[24:56] finally my brethren be strong in the
[24:58] lord and the power of his might well
[25:01] god's might is his word
[25:03] and if we choose each day to be strong
[25:05] spiritually in other words i'm not going
[25:07] to take a day off i'm going to fight the
[25:09] devil today i'm going to fight off that
[25:12] temptation i'm going gonna fight off
[25:13] that angry spirit i'm gonna fight off
[25:15] that lustful spirit right i'm gonna
[25:17] fight off that covetous spirit
[25:19] if we choose to fight it off each day we
[25:22] will succeed and we'll see the hand of
[25:23] god blessing our lives
[25:26] and notice if crossing over into a
[25:28] promise or in this case the baptism of
[25:30] the holy ghost it's going to take
[25:32] patience and this is one i forgot to
[25:34] bring out a few weeks ago you remember
[25:36] that
[25:36] they had to wait ten days to cross over
[25:38] in the book of acts they had to wait
[25:40] three days in the book of joshua
[25:43] remember that god said you're going to
[25:44] cross over in three days prepare
[25:46] yourself so see in each case god had to
[25:49] give them a little patience you're not
[25:51] going to cross over instantly it's not
[25:52] going to be an instant miracle to cross
[25:54] over you're going to have to be patient
[25:56] and if you're patient and keep the word
[25:58] of god i will take you over
[26:00] undoubtedly i'll take you over for sure
[26:03] without any doubt i'll take you over but
[26:05] you've got to wait on my timing and you
[26:07] must obey my word
[26:10] and it's done by exalting the word
[26:12] remember the priest exalted the ark
[26:14] praise god you've got to exalt the word
[26:16] in your life the word has to be number
[26:18] one reading your bible praying fasting
[26:20] giving alms going to church has to be
[26:23] far above
[26:24] everything else in your life
[26:26] amen and then you got to give the word
[26:28] preeminence you got to that word was a
[26:30] thousand feet ahead of the uh or 200
[26:33] paces i'm rather ahead of the israelites
[26:35] you've got to put the word way out there
[26:37] in front of you it's got to lead every
[26:38] decision you make praise god you have to
[26:41] make sure it's the first thing and then
[26:43] if you have patience and you do that and
[26:45] you exalt the word of god and you put
[26:47] the word you give the word preeminence
[26:48] god's going to fight for you praise god
[26:51] he will it's it's a it's a proven
[26:54] formula for success amen
[26:57] and then purposeful sinning will hinder
[26:59] the whole church
[27:01] right we learned that because the paul
[27:03] said many that take the communion uh
[27:05] they take it without discerning the
[27:07] lord's body and many are weak and sickly
[27:09] among you
[27:11] because they don't do that so isn't it
[27:12] awesome god heals our bodies
[27:15] we haven't had anybody die in the church
[27:16] lately that's a blessing praise god
[27:18] right it's a huge blessing because in
[27:20] the in the corinthian church they did
[27:22] have people die
[27:23] they did and it was because they weren't
[27:25] living the right kind of life amen
[27:29] you know over the last year or two i've
[27:30] heard of different people that have died
[27:32] young people around the message and when
[27:35] i heard about their testimony some of
[27:36] them were running from god
[27:39] and then and then i heard the families
[27:41] testify like a young man who was in the
[27:42] military
[27:44] passed away but i heard the family's
[27:47] prayer was lord if if he won't repent
[27:50] take him home
[27:51] if he won't change his life so that that
[27:53] was the
[27:54] that was the testimony of the family
[27:56] a young man
[27:58] running from the message disobeying the
[28:00] message
[28:01] so remember god is a merciful god church
[28:03] but also god is a all-knowing god as
[28:06] well
[28:07] and he will do he will do what's best
[28:10] just like in this corinthian church he
[28:12] took some of them home because they
[28:13] weren't discerning the lord's body
[28:15] the bible says god will not be mocked
[28:18] amen the bible said what a what a
[28:21] serious thing to fall in the hands of an
[28:23] angry god
[28:24] right it's a fearful thing the bible
[28:26] says in hebrews chapter 12 it's a
[28:28] fearful thing to fall into the hands of
[28:30] an angry god
[28:32] because they've heard it their whole
[28:33] life and this this gentleman in
[28:34] particular was raised in the message he
[28:36] knew the message he met all the message
[28:37] preachers he knew everything about it
[28:39] but he continued to disobey
[28:42] and he had some children outside of a
[28:44] marriage and never got married and had
[28:45] kids outside of wedlock in other words
[28:47] fornication and different things that he
[28:50] chosen to do and just ran from god let's
[28:52] not run from god let's run to god amen
[28:55] and we'll kind of touch on this thought
[28:57] a little later
[28:59] in this message
[29:00] but that but one sin one disobedience
[29:03] can hinder the whole church
[29:06] but i'm glad god's healing our sick
[29:08] praise god
[29:09] i'm glad we're able to humble ourselves
[29:12] recognize the presence of the lord amen
[29:15] hallelujah and remember god fights some
[29:18] of your battles as you faithfully
[29:20] worship and obey like jericho
[29:22] i didn't put up there but
[29:24] but some of the battles god will have
[29:25] you partake in he wants you to
[29:28] experience the battle in other words
[29:30] praying a long time for somebody or
[29:32] facing somebody face to face and you
[29:34] feel like it's going to be a battle and
[29:36] your heart's about pumping through your
[29:37] shirt
[29:38] and you know it's going to be an awful
[29:40] situation but you got to stand there
[29:42] like christ stood there praise god
[29:44] you have to face your accusers and face
[29:46] the difficult situations standing there
[29:49] and you've got to fight praise god and
[29:51] god teaches you how to fight with the
[29:53] sword of the holy spirit praise god
[29:56] and we're taught to pray before every
[29:58] battle like a.i right we must pray
[30:00] before we go up to battle so important
[30:04] and then remember that permanent
[30:06] separation from old habits is essential
[30:08] for victory god wouldn't even let them
[30:10] go to jericho until they were first
[30:12] circumcised
[30:14] in other words you couldn't you you're
[30:16] not going to get certain victories until
[30:18] you're circumcised from the things of
[30:20] the world until you've got real
[30:22] victories in your life god won't even
[30:23] let you approach some of these these
[30:25] these mountains or we can say like
[30:27] there's great obstacles god won't let
[30:28] you approach the giants until you're
[30:30] circumcised from the old egyptian
[30:33] lifestyle
[30:34] there it is amen hallelujah praise god
[30:37] remember the reproach of egypt had to be
[30:38] cut away praise god and once it was cut
[30:41] away now they can fight giants amen in
[30:44] other words god god wants you to be a
[30:46] totally different person from egypt he
[30:48] wants to be you know what he doesn't
[30:49] want you have the slave mentality he
[30:51] wants to have the warrior mentality amen
[30:54] but it takes the circumcision it takes
[30:56] cutting
[30:57] and pain right
[30:59] they had to be healed right then to be
[31:00] cut and then healed
[31:02] and that's what it takes for some of us
[31:03] we got to go through difficult times and
[31:05] we got to lose maybe friendships we got
[31:07] to lose different uh family
[31:09] relationships we got to lose some of
[31:11] those and know the pain of it but let
[31:13] the holy ghost heal us so then god can
[31:15] use us and in a trial we won't run back
[31:17] to the world but we'll know we're a
[31:19] separated soldier to christ
[31:22] hallelujah praise god amen you won't run
[31:24] into mom or you won't we won't run back
[31:26] to the denomination when things get
[31:28] tough amen but you will stay faithful to
[31:30] god you'll stay true to god because
[31:32] you're totally consecrated to god amen
[31:36] amen
[31:41] and we learned and we'll look at this
[31:43] later
[31:44] we must make an effort to remember god's
[31:46] victories and his faithfulness
[31:49] because that's what they did
[31:51] in the in joshua
[31:53] and that's what peter told us with a
[31:55] statue of perfect man i'm going to
[31:56] constantly bring you into remembrance of
[31:59] the virtues of jesus christ the the
[32:02] character qualities i call in the book i
[32:03] call it character qualities of jesus
[32:06] christ because when you say virtues well
[32:07] there is a virtue called virtue and it
[32:10] kind of seems overlapping and confusing
[32:12] right so i just use character qualities
[32:14] those are the qualities of jesus
[32:15] christ's personal character
[32:18] and remember compromise is avoided
[32:20] through prayer and background checks
[32:23] in other words just don't take
[32:24] somebody's first word about a story
[32:26] especially if it's about a minister or
[32:27] it's about somebody outside the church
[32:29] don't take somebody's first story you go
[32:31] check with them yourself
[32:33] right because if not it becomes gossip
[32:36] right don't just believe everything you
[32:38] hear check it out do some research
[32:41] right
[32:43] and number nine
[32:44] uh
[32:45] conquer your responsibilities first
[32:48] before seeking other responsibilities
[32:50] and that's from the scripture a bishop
[32:53] must rule his home first before he rules
[32:55] the house of god
[32:59] so you know before just a little
[33:01] testimony before i was a uh
[33:03] ordained a pastor brother brooks you
[33:05] know he had me preach for him and after
[33:07] i always forget i'll never forget after
[33:08] my first sermon i mean the altar was
[33:10] filled and we prayed there maybe half
[33:11] hour hour i don't know how long we
[33:12] prayed there in lima but after the
[33:14] service you know he was all we're all
[33:15] crying in the office and he's like
[33:17] whatever you're doing brother jesse he
[33:18] said you keep doing it
[33:21] so what i was doing was fasting and
[33:22] praying before i preached so i've always
[33:24] done that
[33:25] right that that's my formula for success
[33:28] and he always told me he said i always
[33:29] loved how you run your home because
[33:31] brother brooks would come over before i
[33:32] was a pastor he'd stay the night at our
[33:33] house and he told you
[33:35] he'd have he had the midlife crisis
[33:37] thing so he would like literally drive
[33:39] three hours to come and stay at our
[33:40] house at like a drop of a hat and so
[33:43] lydia i don't know if literally
[33:44] remembers i don't know if malachi
[33:45] remembers but he would just come and
[33:46] hang out at our house just to get relief
[33:48] from his battles
[33:49] and he always said i wish i would have
[33:51] ran my house like you do
[33:54] and so that told me before i was a
[33:55] pastor that
[33:56] uh i was ruling my house well
[33:59] right
[34:00] and he always told me to he said never
[34:01] leave your children he said always stay
[34:03] with your children and always keep the
[34:05] bible studies going and so i've always
[34:07] done that
[34:08] i've tried to take his
[34:09] his wisdom
[34:11] and apply that to my life praise god and
[34:13] so when i saw the holy spirit was in my
[34:15] home and i knew it was but i just i
[34:17] needed confirmation then i knew god
[34:19] could call me to be a pastor as well
[34:21] praise god
[34:23] and so that's what i've learned here i
[34:25] possess my home and then i can lead the
[34:27] church by the grace of god amen
[34:30] and 10
[34:31] god is very merciful merciful rather to
[34:34] those that fear him we saw that with
[34:35] rahab
[34:36] and we saw that with the gibeonites
[34:38] these these individuals just fear god
[34:41] and god gave them a token amen
[34:43] right and then god god spared them from
[34:46] genocide god was going to destroy the
[34:47] whole gibeonites thousands of people but
[34:50] because they fear god enough to
[34:52] come approach israel and ask for mercy
[34:55] then god spared them from genocide
[34:57] right because they were guilty for over
[34:59] 400 years of idolatry but they were
[35:02] willing in that moment to forsake it all
[35:04] just to survive and so god forgave them
[35:06] and then they became workers for the
[35:08] house of god amen
[35:10] hallelujah and remember believers have
[35:12] unique ministries from one another not
[35:14] every pastor is the same not every
[35:16] evangelist is the same
[35:17] not every preacher is the same not every
[35:19] sister is the same not every brother is
[35:21] the same now we all got to line up with
[35:23] the word but everybody has a slightly
[35:25] different unique type of ministry
[35:29] and never use i'm sorry always use your
[35:31] liberty as a blessing and not as a
[35:34] stumbling block
[35:36] right the main examples in the bible are
[35:37] eating meat and drinking wine be very
[35:40] careful with what you eat right and then
[35:42] uh
[35:43] association visiting other places that
[35:45] are that are not uh christian places in
[35:48] other words be careful the restaurants
[35:49] you go to
[35:51] right
[35:52] for example we don't go to applebee's
[35:53] very much because now we get takeout
[35:56] sometimes
[35:57] but because of that all the drink in
[35:59] there and the the tvs with the sports on
[36:01] it it's just too much worldly things
[36:03] it's just
[36:05] uh i wouldn't want to go to that kind of
[36:07] place all the time because if they see
[36:09] you there then you're kind of associated
[36:10] with that right and especially as a me i
[36:13] i used to like sport so that's a that's
[36:14] a heavy temptation for me i just want to
[36:16] watch the game instead of looking at my
[36:18] family you know that's why we don't go
[36:19] there
[36:20] but you don't want to make anybody
[36:22] stumble
[36:23] right by the the liberties that you
[36:25] experience
[36:27] right
[36:28] and then 13 was the last one remember
[36:30] where you came from like joshua reminded
[36:32] them remember we looked at sunday
[36:33] remember where you come from where the
[36:35] gospels come to you and also the last
[36:37] you know spiritual fathers
[36:38] and then choose to daily surrender to
[36:41] christ's will the real christian victory
[36:44] is what joshua said choose you this day
[36:46] whom you will serve you say brother
[36:48] jesse i chose to serve god 10 years ago
[36:50] i know but i'm asking you to follow him
[36:52] today too i'm asking you to choose to
[36:55] follow him and obey him right now praise
[36:57] god
[36:58] because today's the most powerful choice
[37:00] amen
[37:01] because remember you can undo your other
[37:03] choice in the past today you can undo it
[37:06] today but if i choose today to obey god
[37:09] then i'll be blessed tomorrow amen amen
[37:14] right judas chose for three and a half
[37:16] years right three and a half years to
[37:18] follow jesus but then that one day he
[37:20] chose to leave that passover scene and
[37:23] satan filled his heart and that's where
[37:25] he lost his salvation
[37:27] right
[37:28] so see the the most important choice is
[37:30] today
[37:32] it'll always be the most important
[37:33] choice praise god
[37:35] is daily surrendering to the will the
[37:38] perfect will of jesus christ
[37:41] now you see we saw three great themes in
[37:44] this book
[37:47] that first you conquer through strength
[37:49] you've got to be strong in the lord like
[37:51] austin was he's listening to four
[37:52] sermons from brother brown for the last
[37:53] two days i thought he's gonna be strong
[37:55] now
[37:56] right
[37:57] he's gonna be real strong like me if i
[37:59] get up at five i have two and a half
[38:00] hours to study before work i'm gonna be
[38:02] strong that day if i study for two and a
[38:03] half hours
[38:04] i'm gonna be i'm gonna be burning up you
[38:06] know with the fire of god
[38:08] and you that's how you'll conquer the
[38:10] enemy is through strength not weakness
[38:13] strength praise god
[38:16] and then uh you see the theme of
[38:18] dividing everyone in inheritance and
[38:20] then you see this theme of remembering
[38:23] the ways the victories of god so just
[38:25] briefly uh these won't last very long
[38:27] either
[38:29] conquering through strength is seen
[38:31] through joshua joshua says three times
[38:33] to be strong
[38:35] and very courageous
[38:37] so the constant theme is we can't be
[38:39] weak christians
[38:41] right you don't want a weak preacher
[38:44] right you don't want me to be weak when
[38:46] you come up for when you're sick do you
[38:47] want me to be weak and say like mr devil
[38:49] would would you leave today would that
[38:51] be okay mr devil would that be all right
[38:54] you know you don't want a weak preacher
[38:56] right well i don't know if i should
[38:58] preach this i don't want to offend
[38:59] anybody if it's god's word i don't care
[39:01] who it offends
[39:03] right you want a bold preacher in fact i
[39:05] want god's word to offend you praise god
[39:08] because it'll defend your flesh it'll
[39:09] offend your flesh right and that will
[39:11] get you out of the flesh and hopefully
[39:13] get you to repent and get you back in
[39:14] the holy spirit praise god
[39:17] or sinners jesus had to drive away 70 of
[39:20] his own preachers amen
[39:22] because the foreknowledge of god said
[39:24] they wouldn't accept it anyway they're
[39:25] just here for the miracles so people eat
[39:28] sometimes i don't mind if they leave let
[39:29] them leave because all the
[39:31] predestination will stay
[39:35] so we got to be it's got to be bold
[39:36] praise god we got to be strong in the
[39:38] lord praise god
[39:42] like i don't want a preacher to come in
[39:43] here and not bawl us out if we're
[39:44] sinning we need to be bawled out
[39:48] the bible said god rebukes all that he
[39:50] loves amen and if he doesn't rebuke you
[39:52] you're not a real son of god or daughter
[39:54] of god
[39:55] he's got to rebuke you but we must be
[39:57] strong and very courageous
[40:00] so let's have courage for this year's
[40:02] battles praise god or whatever battle
[40:04] you're in right now be courageous and
[40:06] say god is going to fight my battle for
[40:08] me amen god is with me praise god he's
[40:11] gonna he's with me in the fire and he'll
[40:13] bring me through the fire amen
[40:16] i don't care who the enemy is i don't
[40:17] care what the struggle is god is gonna
[40:19] bring me through i've got courage amen
[40:22] i'm gonna win this amen somehow or
[40:24] another even if it goes into next year
[40:26] i'm going to win this amen
[40:28] that's courage amen
[40:30] we all can have courage for like 24
[40:32] hours right
[40:33] or at least do we wake up well if i feel
[40:35] good in the morning i know i have
[40:36] courage you know if i'm sick tonight or
[40:38] something like that but we gotta have
[40:40] courage like if i gotta fight till i'm
[40:41] 30 or if i get a fight till i'm 40 or if
[40:44] i got to fight till i'm 50 i'm gonna
[40:46] keep fighting because it's a worthy
[40:47] cause it's the best the lord's battle
[40:50] amen
[40:51] i'm fighting with the lord's purpose in
[40:54] mind praise god this is god's battle
[40:56] amen and i'm a warrior in this army
[40:58] praise god and this army cannot be
[41:01] defeated
[41:02] amen
[41:04] that's what we need today strong and
[41:07] courageous saints
[41:08] i believe we got him praise god i
[41:10] believe you got him
[41:11] amen like brother amen and who when i
[41:14] visit them at the hospital they're
[41:15] laying on their backs and who is all
[41:17] exhausted and brother amen
[41:18] he's got that pneumonia and cometh he
[41:20] said just give me a prayer cloth i said
[41:22] that's that's courage right there sister
[41:24] who said can you just bring a prayer
[41:26] cloth please that's right courage give
[41:28] me something to place my faith upon amen
[41:31] how did an area
[41:32] they could have said i'm done with you
[41:34] brother jesse if god don't answer our
[41:35] prayers god don't give a miracle they
[41:37] could have done that right
[41:39] anybody could have done that when we're
[41:40] sick and tired but i like how they were
[41:42] courageous give me something to i can
[41:44] place my faith on give me something to
[41:45] hang on to give me some confirmation
[41:48] that god's my healer amen amen and
[41:50] that's for all your sicknesses all of
[41:51] our sicknesses right
[41:54] make us strong and very courageous
[41:56] praise god
[42:01] now the
[42:02] division of the inheritance is a huge
[42:05] portion of scripture
[42:07] so see it's it's that simple picture i
[42:09] showed you maybe since austin i don't
[42:11] think austin has seen this one let me
[42:12] scroll down i'm on number 15.
[42:15] remember i showed it to you a few
[42:17] weeks ago the spiritual
[42:20] nation you have to conquer
[42:22] that may take me a while so bear with me
[42:24] i think it'll be worth the effort if i
[42:26] can find it remember i had brazil
[42:29] and then i kind of divide it up into
[42:30] spiritual
[42:32] uh
[42:33] locations
[42:35] boy it's been a while since i preached
[42:37] on that
[42:39] where'd you go fella
[42:42] but austin i took a a picture of brazil
[42:44] the an outline of the political map
[42:47] and then i just divided up into five
[42:49] imaginary uh
[42:51] there it is thank you lord 439 just just
[42:55] a few so austin it's like this once you
[42:57] get the baptism of the holy ghost you go
[42:59] into the promised land and you have to
[43:00] possess
[43:01] the relationships for your life
[43:04] right but like in joshua first you had
[43:07] to get circumcised cross over jordan
[43:09] possessing the land was years away
[43:12] now i'm not saying it will be years away
[43:13] for us all the time but i'm just saying
[43:15] some of the more mature victories you're
[43:18] going to get are years away i will say
[43:20] that
[43:21] not everyone but some of your major
[43:23] victories like brother rams complex when
[43:25] did he get the victory right at the end
[43:26] of his life
[43:28] right
[43:29] that was a major very mature victory it
[43:32] came at the very end of his life that
[43:34] stomach pain right at the very end of
[43:36] his life he got victory over that
[43:38] some of our victories are going to be
[43:40] our greatest victory is going to be
[43:42] later on after years and years of
[43:44] battles and rests and battles and rest
[43:47] we have to wait years to get the
[43:48] victories and that's how it was in
[43:49] joshua they had to battle many years and
[43:52] then god started giving them rest and
[43:53] then they could have their own place
[43:55] then they could have their possession
[43:57] and they could know that now i've got
[43:58] peace and and now god's placed me
[44:00] somewhere now i know where i stand with
[44:02] god amen
[44:04] so see you may get the holy ghost and it
[44:06] may be years before you understand all
[44:08] your ministries
[44:10] for like for me i i hope i have a
[44:12] missionary ministry one day
[44:14] i don't know if i will but i hope i do
[44:17] because i love to go to places they've
[44:18] never heard the message and preach the
[44:20] gospel to them
[44:22] right i don't know maybe that's a later
[44:24] one or maybe vocation what's my job what
[44:27] does god call me to do like paul became
[44:29] a tet maker right so he didn't have to
[44:31] take offerings from the churches see
[44:33] that was a victory he had to gain
[44:36] your nine gifts of the holy spirit
[44:38] maybe you've always felt like i was i
[44:39] was i was gonna have a a gift of
[44:41] miracles but it's gonna take years till
[44:43] you're ready for it
[44:45] if you had done miracles at the
[44:46] beginning you might have got a little
[44:47] prideful right
[44:50] or if i would have a prophecy at the
[44:52] beginning i might have got a little
[44:53] prideful so god saves it till later on
[44:55] in your life
[44:57] right so just consider those things
[45:00] once you get the holy ghost you're going
[45:01] to fight a lot a lot of battles but then
[45:03] later on you'll be placed you'll know
[45:06] well god's called me to be a deacon or
[45:07] god's call me to be a housewife with a
[45:09] gift to do this and a gift to do that or
[45:12] god's called me to be a grandpa with a
[45:14] gift of prayer cloth amen
[45:17] glory amen it's like divine healing
[45:19] brother in miracles it's kind of what it
[45:20] is in your life
[45:22] you know people just get those and they
[45:23] get miracles that's the holy spirit
[45:26] praise god
[45:27] because he's not a healer none of us are
[45:29] healers
[45:30] but you grow into these things
[45:32] as you get older you grow
[45:34] and you see where god's giving you a
[45:36] possession well this is where god lord
[45:38] just let me be faithful with this
[45:40] inheritance amen praise god amen let me
[45:43] be faithful with
[45:44] this and location you know well i wonder
[45:48] why i'm here am i going to be here
[45:49] forever lord
[45:50] let me say it like this
[45:52] lord if you want me to be an actor in a
[45:53] small church my whole life i'll say
[45:54] praise the lord amen
[45:56] because i just want to be where god
[45:58] wants me to be big churches big problems
[46:01] little churches little problems i'll
[46:03] take the little church
[46:05] right because think about think of all
[46:07] the major scandals some of these
[46:08] churches have gone through
[46:10] i can name the biggest churches in the
[46:12] u.s and canada and they have some of the
[46:14] biggest scandals there are
[46:16] like murders there's the biggest church
[46:19] in america had a murder a few years ago
[46:21] and both people went to the message but
[46:23] this one
[46:24] this woman was a daughter
[46:26] and she lost her mind she was in her she
[46:28] was a
[46:29] a
[46:29] middle-aged woman in her 50s well she
[46:31] had some mental problem and she shot and
[46:33] killed her dad
[46:34] in a message church
[46:36] i told you the message church in canada
[46:38] one of the biggest ones in the world
[46:39] had that adultery of the pastor's
[46:41] daughter
[46:42] a fornication with a with a with a minor
[46:46] see so some of the biggest churches you
[46:48] might think oh everything's great not
[46:50] all the time
[46:51] we're going to have our troubles but
[46:53] hopefully they're really small troubles
[46:55] by god's grace that's our desire
[46:58] and as long as you possess the land
[46:59] there will be no major scandals
[47:02] by god's grace
[47:05] so see
[47:06] once you get the holy ghost you're going
[47:08] to fight fight fight you're going to
[47:09] learn how to fight and then you're going
[47:11] to enter into your inheritance
[47:14] hallelujah praise god amen
[47:17] you've got to fight and learn how to
[47:18] fight be a warrior be faithful make no
[47:21] compromises amen
[47:23] learn how to obey the word of god learn
[47:25] how to pray before battles and after all
[47:27] these victories god will say now here
[47:29] here's your possession amen hallelujah
[47:32] praise god that's the order conquering
[47:34] through strength and then division of
[47:37] inheritance
[47:38] praise god
[47:40] everyone say jesus you're my inheritance
[47:43] amen
[47:44] he is and he'll give you gifts right
[47:46] he'll give you all these blessings so
[47:47] hopefully also not just a little visual
[47:49] for you
[47:50] and you'll go throughout your life and
[47:51] you'll uh learn how to uh possess all
[47:54] those
[47:56] now here's a beautiful one this this is
[47:58] i heard a preacher preach this i'm like
[48:00] i need to go study this
[48:02] and it was
[48:03] joshua's all about remembering
[48:07] right in joshua 4 they set up 12 stones
[48:10] for crossing jordan as a sign
[48:13] and remember they set them up in the
[48:14] water and then over by was it gilgal
[48:17] yeah gilgal
[48:19] memorials and this is going to play into
[48:21] the end of the sermon so
[48:22] this is important
[48:24] chapter six
[48:25] god puts a sign or joshua puts a sign on
[48:28] jericho whoever builds this city will be
[48:31] cursed their first two sons will be will
[48:33] die right and that happened i think 600
[48:35] years later when the man tried to
[48:36] rebuild it his first two sons died
[48:39] it's a sign
[48:41] the valley of acor they put stones on
[48:44] aiken's body as a sign don't bring
[48:46] babylonian clothes into your house don't
[48:48] dress like a harlot right and brothers
[48:50] don't dress like a homosexual
[48:52] right
[48:53] a homosexual called me uh from another
[48:56] state and i'm in contact with them to
[48:58] try to walk them out of homosexuality
[49:00] right now i was texting him
[49:02] he and i were texting today he left a
[49:04] voicemail my voice a message a few days
[49:06] ago uh i've been talking to him and
[49:08] we're going to set up a time to talk to
[49:10] try to bring this brother out
[49:11] how many believe we got the holy spirit
[49:13] of deliverance amen brother i've done it
[49:15] before i've i've talked to people on the
[49:17] phone and while i'm talking to them that
[49:19] evil spirit leaves them
[49:21] that happened last year amen
[49:23] i didn't hear you
[49:25] i had a two-hour talk with a man i was
[49:27] mentoring and i remember i was walking
[49:28] around the church cleaning in here and
[49:30] he said while i was talking to him just
[49:32] last year the devil left him
[49:34] amen
[49:36] i didn't hear you praise god it's not
[49:38] always foaming lips and screaming and
[49:39] falling on the floor sometimes it's a
[49:41] little different praise god but each
[49:43] time the person's free praise god it's
[49:45] just like when music drives away evil
[49:47] thoughts amen and music will drive away
[49:50] depression amen i'm not going to be
[49:51] depressed i'm going to be encouraged
[49:53] amen that's my favorite song that's my
[49:56] jubilee song i'm going to worship god
[49:58] amen i'm going to overcome this fear
[50:00] amen
[50:01] i'm going to overcome my doubts and
[50:02] discouragement i'm a child of god this
[50:05] song brought me back into deliverance
[50:07] praise god amen amen
[50:12] joshua chapter 8 they put stones upon
[50:14] the king of ai as a sign
[50:18] in joshua 10 they put stones upon the
[50:20] caves after they killed those five kings
[50:22] and put them in the cave they put stones
[50:24] upon the caves as a sign
[50:26] and that's one thought i never brought
[50:28] out church that was such a beautiful
[50:29] thought because joshua was fighting for
[50:32] the gibeonites
[50:35] the greatest victor the greatest miracle
[50:37] joshua ever said son stands still
[50:39] happened when he was fighting for
[50:41] somebody lesser than him
[50:44] amen that's what abraham did praise god
[50:46] abraham was fighting in prayer for a lot
[50:48] amen he said lord respect a lot will you
[50:51] give me 50 how about 40 35 20 10 praise
[50:55] god and god sent angels down there to
[50:58] make sure abraham's prayer was answered
[51:00] amen amen is there any greater miracle
[51:03] than saving souls no sir the greatest
[51:05] miracle there is is a soul that's passed
[51:07] from death unto life amen
[51:10] your body will get sick again you'll get
[51:12] tired you may lose arms and you may get
[51:14] sick but once your soul is sealed it
[51:16] seems to the day of your redemption amen
[51:20] see church some of our greatest
[51:21] victories will be when we serve other
[51:24] people
[51:26] when we're fighting for other people
[51:28] when we're putting our time as a
[51:30] sacrifice for other people praise god
[51:33] that's what joshua found
[51:35] remember he was called into that the
[51:37] gibb and i said come on up here we got
[51:38] these five kings coming against us so
[51:40] they sacrificed they left everything
[51:41] remember they went all they walked all
[51:43] night they walked all through the night
[51:45] to ambush those guys
[51:49] and some of your greatest victories some
[51:51] of my greatest victories will be in
[51:52] serving other people that's why i've
[51:54] seen the greatest miracles when i made
[51:55] the greatest sacrifice down there in
[51:58] guyana and trinidad
[52:00] i saw that mo the most instant
[52:02] instant miracles was there
[52:05] praise god
[52:06] so remember let's always be open to
[52:08] serving other people let's not live for
[52:10] ourselves let's live for others
[52:13] i forgot about that thought i never
[52:14] brought that thought out but i just
[52:15] struck me last week and i forgot to
[52:17] preach it chapter 22 remember uh the
[52:20] east side believers i'll say like east
[52:23] side they set up a large altar as a
[52:25] witness a sign
[52:28] and joshua 24 remember
[52:30] joshua puts a stone under the oak as a
[52:33] witness between joshua and israel
[52:37] so does anybody think memorials are
[52:39] important
[52:40] that's why i love that statue perfect
[52:42] man that's why i love that picture right
[52:43] there that's why i love all those
[52:45] pictures in there i like
[52:47] remembering what god has done
[52:49] praise god
[52:51] and if there's miracles in here that god
[52:52] has done remind me i'll take a picture
[52:54] of that and we'll put it up we'll hang
[52:55] it up somewhere they're probably gonna
[52:57] be in my office you know
[52:58] but uh
[53:01] so i ordered this a few days ago this is
[53:03] gonna arrive in two weeks this is my
[53:04] first memorial
[53:06] that's the screenshot of when april 19
[53:08] 2020 i preached the first ser the first
[53:11] sermon on the philippians series and
[53:14] i've been studying on philippians and
[53:15] they started you know one of the main
[53:16] things they did at the beginning was
[53:18] they got the prayer class right
[53:20] and so as i'm preaching i'm like brother
[53:21] jose do you got that prayer call from
[53:23] brother branham
[53:24] right
[53:25] a week so we prayed uh vang took it a
[53:28] week later he was out
[53:31] he was out he was it was he was out at
[53:33] home i'm sorry week later he was oh he
[53:35] was awake in the hospital two weeks
[53:36] later he was at home already
[53:39] so that's that's a miracle memorial
[53:41] there
[53:42] and that was such a special moment
[53:44] always remember that moment praise god
[53:46] and church i hope the holy spirit helps
[53:48] us never forget that moment amen
[53:51] see because we have so much power in
[53:53] remembering and look at that picture
[53:54] brother bang's got his hand up there
[53:56] he's like i believe
[53:58] i'm i'm gonna go take this to my my dad
[54:00] i'm gonna call this lying vanities
[54:02] this pole in the plug talk that's lying
[54:04] vanities he's gonna live again and look
[54:06] at him today
[54:08] hallelujah god give him another chance
[54:11] god give him another chance
[54:15] god is gracious church god is gracious
[54:17] so let's say i want to start i want to
[54:19] be like joshua i see i thought this
[54:20] summer i could draw a picture of it you
[54:22] know but i was like i don't have time
[54:23] for that so forgive me so i'm just going
[54:25] to order a picture
[54:27] so hopefully i get here in a couple
[54:28] weeks or so trying to find a place to
[54:29] hang that up as a memorial
[54:31] now let me try to finish with this i got
[54:33] about 26 minutes on my hour so
[54:35] uh let's learn here what the book of
[54:38] joshua i'm sorry book of judges rather
[54:40] sorry
[54:41] what does judges
[54:42] reveal about the book of joshua
[54:46] and i think you'll be blessed by some of
[54:48] these thoughts maybe i'll preach some of
[54:49] them before but i think they'll be fresh
[54:52] here for you tonight so if you got your
[54:54] bible let's go to judges chapter one
[54:55] please
[54:57] remember our text our text said that
[54:59] all the generation that knew joshua and
[55:03] saw the works of god and outlive joshua
[55:06] they were faithful to the commands of
[55:08] god
[55:12] so any man that saw what joshua did
[55:14] they heard about the miracles they saw
[55:16] that
[55:17] all the children
[55:19] anyone that saw that
[55:20] they lived faithful to god the rest of
[55:23] their lives
[55:25] see god visited that generation and that
[55:28] generation never forgot god's miracles
[55:31] praise god that's why we'll never forget
[55:32] god's miracles praise god
[55:35] and that's that's a great lesson we
[55:38] learned through this
[55:39] so i want to go through this kind of uh
[55:41] within the next 25 minutes or so
[55:43] now judges chapter 1 verses 1 to 4
[55:48] shows israel starting well by inquiring
[55:51] of the lord for battle and they win the
[55:54] first battle so let's look at judges 1
[55:56] verse 1. now after the death of joshua
[55:58] came to pass that the children of israel
[56:00] asked the lord saying who shall go up
[56:03] for us against the canaanites first
[56:05] to fight against them
[56:08] and the lord said judah shall go up
[56:10] because judah was praised and judah
[56:12] became the tribe that held the scepter
[56:14] right
[56:15] he was going to eventually dave was
[56:16] going to come out of him pretty soon
[56:18] right so dave was going to come out in
[56:20] about 400 years
[56:22] verse 3 and judah said unto simeon his
[56:24] brother come up with me into my lot that
[56:26] we may fight against the canaanites and
[56:28] i likewise will go with thee into thy
[56:30] lot so simeon went with him and judah
[56:32] went up and the lord delivered the
[56:33] canaanites and the
[56:34] and the pair parasites rather into their
[56:37] hand and they slew of them in beasic ten
[56:40] thousand men
[56:42] so it's a pretty good start right
[56:44] joshua's off the scene that's a really
[56:46] good start
[56:48] you go and pray before a battle god
[56:50] gives you 10 000 enemies defeated praise
[56:54] god
[56:56] now verses five through 20 are kind of a
[57:00] review of when caleb
[57:02] challenged his tribe who will go up and
[57:05] defeat
[57:06] uh the mountain remember and off neil
[57:08] goes up so it's it's a little bit of
[57:10] repeat from joshua so go to verse 21.
[57:14] now in verse 21 we start seeing
[57:17] compromise
[57:19] instead of full victories
[57:21] we start seeing incomplete victories
[57:25] okay
[57:26] so verses 21 through 26 show
[57:29] the beginning of benjamin's incomplete
[57:33] victory
[57:35] in other words they didn't drive out
[57:37] all their enemies
[57:40] right
[57:41] they still left some of them there now
[57:42] think about this church just for a
[57:44] moment
[57:45] should a holy ghost-filled person let
[57:47] some of their cuss words remain in their
[57:49] vocabulary
[57:50] or should they get a complete
[57:53] what do you think
[57:56] should a holy ghost christian come
[57:58] continue committing fornication or
[58:01] should he or she get total victory over
[58:03] all fornication
[58:05] total victory
[58:06] total victory
[58:10] i'm talking major sins right because
[58:12] brother brahm one time lied to the irs
[58:14] well we'll have those are minor sins
[58:15] right
[58:17] also now we're talking about that we'll
[58:18] still commit minor sins but all the
[58:21] major sins all the major
[58:24] enemies we should drive out and they
[58:26] should be totally driven out by the
[58:28] grace of god
[58:33] like we'd say like homosexuality right
[58:35] that's one of the listed of these anyone
[58:37] who does these sins will not inherit the
[58:39] kingdom of god heresies right now that's
[58:41] the one that that's that's a sin that
[58:42] gets a lot of people today
[58:44] they teach heresies outside the real
[58:46] word of god they're not committing any
[58:48] you know sexual sin or they're not
[58:50] committing any murders but a heresy is
[58:53] on the same level
[58:54] because it's an antichrist spirit it's
[58:56] that white horse rider
[58:58] there he is amen it's that white horse
[59:00] rider and if not checked it'll become a
[59:02] red horse rider and start murdering
[59:04] people's influence
[59:06] and then it'll set up its own kingdom
[59:08] it'll lead to spiritual death and then
[59:09] you will see a lot of sexual sin or you
[59:11] will see a lot of other sins awesome
[59:14] heresy is a person teaching their own
[59:17] belief or their own doctrine the bible
[59:19] also calls it doctrines of devils
[59:22] okay so in the bible a few of the
[59:24] examples are
[59:27] a few of the examples are you cannot eat
[59:29] meat that was called a doctrine of a
[59:30] devil like catholics do that
[59:35] uh only well yeah it could be like that
[59:37] only if they say like god doesn't want
[59:39] you to eat meat
[59:42] i mean you can be healthy not eat meat
[59:44] right because some of that meat's not so
[59:45] healthy these days
[59:46] another one was you're not allowed to
[59:48] marry and that's also in the catholic
[59:49] church they don't let priests marry
[59:52] so two doctrines of devils specifically
[59:54] called doctrines of devils are right
[59:56] there prominent in the catholic church
[59:59] now there's other ones i believe like
[1:00:01] when you say every word brother branham
[1:00:02] said does that say the lord i believe
[1:00:03] that's an absolute heresy
[1:00:05] i believe that's
[1:00:07] no i don't believe anybody can preach
[1:00:08] that and say they're born again
[1:00:10] impossible
[1:00:11] because that's a lie that's making
[1:00:13] brother branham equal to jesus christ
[1:00:16] and
[1:00:16] no man god said i will not share my
[1:00:19] glory with any man
[1:00:21] because god saved brother branham god
[1:00:23] died for brother branham god rose to
[1:00:25] forgive brother branham we we honor
[1:00:27] god's prophets but we don't worship them
[1:00:29] and we never exalt them to equal to
[1:00:30] christ because no brother bram said i'm
[1:00:32] just one pebble on the beach
[1:00:34] that means we're all pebbles and there's
[1:00:36] a great god who's way up there and
[1:00:38] he's far above all those pebbles amen
[1:00:40] now of course i believe he's a little
[1:00:41] bit a lot bigger pebble than me and you
[1:00:43] right
[1:00:44] we agree we agree on that right i'm a
[1:00:45] sand he's a pebble
[1:00:47] i'm a grain of sand he's a he's a large
[1:00:48] pebble
[1:00:50] but nobody touches jesus amen he's the
[1:00:53] rock of ages amen
[1:00:55] hallelujah
[1:00:57] so heresies are also these sins that
[1:01:00] should never come into holy ghost-filled
[1:01:01] churches
[1:01:03] adultery is another one right
[1:01:06] a man should never sleep with another
[1:01:08] man's wife
[1:01:09] right or vice versa
[1:01:11] those are just obvious ones child
[1:01:14] child abuse
[1:01:16] that's an absolute
[1:01:17] uh sin wicked sin from from hell and
[1:01:20] that person there's no way that person
[1:01:21] is born again to abuse a child who can't
[1:01:23] defend themselves
[1:01:24] absolute sin wicked and wickedness doc
[1:01:27] it's a devil it's a devil that's what
[1:01:28] the catholic church has a lot of that
[1:01:29] too and not just the priests but the
[1:01:31] nuns as well it's been exposed in the
[1:01:32] last few years it's nuns as well doing
[1:01:35] to the little girls
[1:01:36] yep they're just
[1:01:38] it's just uh it's in their dna it's in
[1:01:40] their uh jezebel dna
[1:01:42] it is
[1:01:43] uh
[1:01:45] great question
[1:01:46] but now here these are so should there
[1:01:48] be a little bit of abuse in the church
[1:01:50] absolutely not all those enemies should
[1:01:53] be driven out and this should be a place
[1:01:54] of healing this should be a place of of
[1:01:56] sincerity there should be a place of
[1:01:59] total freedom amen where you can just be
[1:02:01] yourself be who made god be who god made
[1:02:03] you to be be a joyful happy christian
[1:02:06] praise god serve one another you'll know
[1:02:08] they're my disciples because they love
[1:02:09] everybody
[1:02:11] that's how you'll know you're a real
[1:02:12] christian
[1:02:15] oh hallelujah praise god amen
[1:02:18] but
[1:02:18] benjamin look at verse 21 and the
[1:02:20] children of benjamin did not look at
[1:02:22] that not drive out
[1:02:24] the jebusites that inhabited jerusalem
[1:02:27] but the jebusites dwell with the
[1:02:28] children of benjamin and jerusalem unto
[1:02:31] this day
[1:02:34] okay
[1:02:35] go down to verse 27.
[1:02:37] now 27 through 36 the rest of the
[1:02:40] chapter
[1:02:41] shows all these tribes check this out
[1:02:43] manasseh e from zebulun asher naphtali
[1:02:47] five five more tribes with benjamin
[1:02:49] there's six
[1:02:51] half of the tribes get incomplete
[1:02:53] victories and one of them gets
[1:02:55] completely embarrassed that's dan
[1:02:58] so seven
[1:03:00] so right after joshua and all that
[1:03:02] generation that knew about the holy
[1:03:03] ghost knew about son stand still they
[1:03:05] saw these miracles after all that
[1:03:07] generation died the next generation is
[1:03:09] way weaker
[1:03:12] and they start compromising and say well
[1:03:13] we can have a little bit of cussing we
[1:03:16] can have a little bit of heresies we can
[1:03:17] have a little bit of child abuse we can
[1:03:19] have a little bit of adultery but any
[1:03:21] holy ghost field christian knows none of
[1:03:23] those things should not be named one
[1:03:25] time in the church of the living god
[1:03:27] amen
[1:03:28] he that names the name of christ let him
[1:03:30] depart from all those iniquities amen
[1:03:38] in verse
[1:03:39] 27 manasseh
[1:03:42] did not drive out the canaanites but
[1:03:44] then verse 28 they put them under
[1:03:46] tribute well you guys can live but you
[1:03:48] got to pay us taxes
[1:03:50] now look that's a businessman that's a
[1:03:52] businessman that will do evil sins in
[1:03:54] order to make some money
[1:03:57] right that's a businessman let's say
[1:03:58] that won't pay his tithes and offerings
[1:04:00] he's gonna let that sin stay in there so
[1:04:02] i can make a little extra dollar
[1:04:05] no no don't don't don't put up god said
[1:04:08] drive them all out
[1:04:10] god said god never said compromise with
[1:04:13] sin and let let the devil live in your
[1:04:15] church
[1:04:16] he never said that
[1:04:17] he said don't compromise and drive it
[1:04:20] all out
[1:04:22] verse 29 ephraim let the canaanites live
[1:04:25] there
[1:04:26] zebulun in verse 30 let the canaanites
[1:04:29] and made them pay tributaries so they're
[1:04:31] going to make a little money from their
[1:04:32] sin
[1:04:34] see that
[1:04:35] don't do any shady deals church don't do
[1:04:37] any bad deals make sure you get every
[1:04:39] dollar the right way
[1:04:42] because these tribes got money the wrong
[1:04:44] way by disobeying the word of god do not
[1:04:46] skip church to work
[1:04:49] god will not bless you
[1:04:51] right we've seen it numerous times the
[1:04:52] different friends i've known through the
[1:04:53] years don't do it if you have it now
[1:04:55] some of you don't have a choice that's
[1:04:56] different if you have a choice your all
[1:04:59] that is is another manassa move
[1:05:01] right all it is is another zebulon
[1:05:03] tributary
[1:05:05] trying to make money thinking you can
[1:05:07] make money by breaking god's command
[1:05:09] it's impossible praise god no job for
[1:05:12] man is more important than the job god
[1:05:14] wants you to do praise god
[1:05:16] and that stay under the anointing so you
[1:05:18] stay under the anointing your wife and
[1:05:20] your chin understand and anointing your
[1:05:22] family stays under anointing god wants
[1:05:24] you under the anointing with all enemies
[1:05:26] under your feet
[1:05:29] don't worry about money you follow god
[1:05:31] and god will have the money chase you
[1:05:35] praise god amen
[1:05:37] god's god's blessings are running after
[1:05:39] you amen
[1:05:40] they're chasing after you praise god
[1:05:42] just put god first
[1:05:47] asher let
[1:05:50] the inhabits inhabitants of zydon
[1:05:54] and numerous other afic rehab all these
[1:05:57] other
[1:05:58] canaanites or whatever he let them live
[1:06:03] verse
[1:06:05] uh 33 naphtali
[1:06:09] let more canaanites dwell there
[1:06:11] and look at verse 34 this is that we'd
[1:06:13] say this is an embarrassing one
[1:06:16] and the amorites force the children of
[1:06:18] dan into the mountain now church any man
[1:06:21] knows you can't you can't plant good
[1:06:23] crops on the mountain
[1:06:25] that's not fertile soil if you're gonna
[1:06:27] have some good you know vineyards and
[1:06:29] you're gonna have some cattle cattle
[1:06:30] don't like being on the mountain
[1:06:33] you always see cattle on the flatlands
[1:06:35] right
[1:06:37] but dan was pushed out of their their
[1:06:39] fertile farming lands to go live in the
[1:06:42] mountains
[1:06:44] for they would not suffer them to come
[1:06:46] down to the valley where you have the
[1:06:48] waters and you have the the green
[1:06:50] pastures
[1:06:52] but the amorites verse 2 35 would dwell
[1:06:55] in the mount heras in aegian and in
[1:06:58] shelby
[1:07:00] yet the hand of the house of joseph
[1:07:01] prevailed so that they became
[1:07:03] tributaries and the coast of the
[1:07:05] amorites was from going up to akrabim
[1:07:08] for the rock and upward
[1:07:10] imagine that
[1:07:11] the devil
[1:07:13] overcame dan we'd say
[1:07:16] and made him isolated from all the other
[1:07:19] tribes
[1:07:20] he lost his inheritance and was isolated
[1:07:23] all himself up on a mountain
[1:07:25] because he couldn't drive out the enemy
[1:07:28] at church that's what happens with
[1:07:29] people
[1:07:30] satan will drive them off of their
[1:07:32] victories and then they'll be isolated
[1:07:34] away from church
[1:07:36] right i said well you come to church but
[1:07:38] you don't fellowship afterwards
[1:07:40] and you have no contact with oth with
[1:07:42] the rest of the body because satan has
[1:07:44] defeated them and satan look satan's
[1:07:46] pushing you around instead of you
[1:07:48] pushing satan around
[1:07:50] come on church
[1:07:52] we're supposed to push the devils around
[1:07:54] we're supposed to cast them out praise
[1:07:56] god
[1:07:57] we're supposed to live where god wants
[1:07:58] us to live we're supposed to live in
[1:08:00] victory not run from our possession
[1:08:02] we're supposed to possess the land amen
[1:08:04] amen
[1:08:06] so we see seven
[1:08:09] seven tribes compromising and one of
[1:08:11] them was so weak now what happened to
[1:08:13] dan later he set up the idol remember
[1:08:15] and that way his name was removed under
[1:08:16] the book of life under heaven
[1:08:19] under heaven
[1:08:24] so look at these lessons and what when
[1:08:27] does this happen when a generation rises
[1:08:30] that didn't know joshua
[1:08:33] joshua means jesus
[1:08:36] a generation that didn't know joshua
[1:08:42] this is the kind of testimonies people
[1:08:44] have when they didn't know
[1:08:46] joshua
[1:08:51] see where i'm going
[1:08:55] chapter two we'll
[1:08:56] end in chapter two because i got about
[1:08:58] 12 more minutes
[1:08:59] for my hour
[1:09:01] see i love this this was a good thought
[1:09:02] i was like oh my this is a good thought
[1:09:04] and sunday lord willing i'm going to
[1:09:06] preach this thought
[1:09:07] the disciple
[1:09:08] whom jesus loved
[1:09:11] because i want you to know
[1:09:12] jesus loves you
[1:09:15] john always called himself the disciple
[1:09:17] whom jesus loved
[1:09:21] i heard that and i was like oh yeah i
[1:09:23] wrote that down months ago i was going
[1:09:24] to preach that but and then just came to
[1:09:25] me this week i'm just sitting there i'm
[1:09:26] like oh i guess i felt like i got struck
[1:09:29] i got to preach that so i'm going to
[1:09:31] study that out and preach that out on
[1:09:32] sunday lord willing
[1:09:34] disciple whom jesus loved
[1:09:38] in chapter two verses one through nine
[1:09:41] now look at this an angel now here this
[1:09:43] is quite a this is quite a story
[1:09:46] before joshua died we're not told this
[1:09:48] in the book of joshua we're told this in
[1:09:49] the book of judges before joshua died an
[1:09:52] angel visits the generation and says
[1:09:55] some of you are going to transgress the
[1:09:56] word
[1:09:58] look at verse 1 chapter 2 verse 1. and
[1:10:01] the angel lord came up from gilgal to
[1:10:03] botch him and said i made you to go up
[1:10:06] out of egypt and i brought you unto the
[1:10:07] land which i swear unto your fathers and
[1:10:09] i said i will never break my covenant
[1:10:10] with you look at that how many know god
[1:10:12] will never break his covenant with you
[1:10:15] you've got a greater covenant than they
[1:10:16] got praise god you've got the blood of
[1:10:17] jesus christ
[1:10:20] verse 2 and you shall make no league
[1:10:21] with the inhabitants of this land you
[1:10:22] shall throw down their altars but you
[1:10:24] have not obeyed my voice why have you
[1:10:25] done this
[1:10:28] wherefore i said also i will not drive
[1:10:30] them out from before you but they shall
[1:10:32] be as thorns in your sides and your god
[1:10:34] shall be a snare unto you
[1:10:37] and it should come to pass when the
[1:10:38] angel lord spake these words unto all
[1:10:40] the children of israel that the people
[1:10:41] lift up their voice and wept is that a
[1:10:43] good sign that's a really good sign
[1:10:45] verse five and they called
[1:10:47] the name of that place bachim and they
[1:10:49] sacrificed there unto the lord that
[1:10:50] means weepers they called this place
[1:10:51] weepers and when joshua had let the
[1:10:54] people go the children of israel went
[1:10:56] every man unto his heritage to the to
[1:10:57] possess the land now look at verse seven
[1:10:59] so see this was a good thing this was
[1:11:01] god visiting one more time before joshua
[1:11:03] died
[1:11:04] verse seven and the people served the
[1:11:05] lord all the days of joshua doesn't that
[1:11:06] sound familiar that's what we read in
[1:11:08] joshua 24 31
[1:11:10] and all the days of the elders that
[1:11:12] outlived joshua who had seen all the
[1:11:13] great works lord that he did for israel
[1:11:16] and joshua the son of none the servant
[1:11:18] lord died being a hundred and ten years
[1:11:20] old and they buried him in the border of
[1:11:21] inheritance and tim netheres in the
[1:11:23] mount of ephraim on the north side of
[1:11:25] the hill gaash
[1:11:29] isn't this just this is such a beautiful
[1:11:30] story
[1:11:31] god visits them and says
[1:11:33] some of you are going to transgress and
[1:11:35] so the people they're so heartbroken oh
[1:11:37] my that should make us heartbroken right
[1:11:41] if the holy spirit would visit us and
[1:11:42] say
[1:11:43] there's going to come a time in a
[1:11:44] generation when the akron church isn't
[1:11:46] going to serve god it would make us weep
[1:11:48] and cry
[1:11:50] because we think all this labor all that
[1:11:51] we've done
[1:11:52] although we try to draw closer to god
[1:11:54] and sacrifice and worship how can this
[1:11:56] happen
[1:11:57] well that's what happened in joshua's
[1:11:58] day they said how is this going to
[1:12:00] happen so they worship god they
[1:12:02] sacrifice to god and god receive their
[1:12:05] sacrifice but the next generation wasn't
[1:12:08] impacted like the first generation
[1:12:12] see that that breaks a believer's heart
[1:12:15] when they know other people are not
[1:12:16] going to serve god like they did
[1:12:21] and so it break their heart so much it
[1:12:22] was called the place of weepers these
[1:12:24] people were weeping and saying oh god
[1:12:26] help us let the next generation keep
[1:12:27] your covenant let this next generation
[1:12:29] serve you like we're serving you may we
[1:12:31] not let down the bars may we not
[1:12:33] compromise help us be a people that
[1:12:36] really manifest your character praise
[1:12:38] god
[1:12:43] verses 10 to 15.
[1:12:45] look at verse 10 this is one of the
[1:12:47] saddest scriptures
[1:12:48] in the bible
[1:12:50] it reminds me of the lukewarm scripture
[1:12:53] and spewing you out of my mouth and i
[1:12:55] never knew you depart from me that were
[1:12:56] conquered this is one of the saddest
[1:12:58] scriptures
[1:12:59] and also all that the generation were
[1:13:01] gathered in their fathers and there
[1:13:02] arose another generation after them
[1:13:04] which knew not the lord
[1:13:06] nor yet the works which he had done
[1:13:09] for israel
[1:13:11] now church i put up here
[1:13:13] the next generation after joshua's and
[1:13:16] those that outlived him
[1:13:18] they chose to reject the ways of joshua
[1:13:22] now look at this there's a difference
[1:13:24] between knowing about god and knowing
[1:13:27] god
[1:13:28] that's what this problem was these this
[1:13:30] next young generation they saw the
[1:13:32] weeping they saw they saw joshua
[1:13:35] the young generation
[1:13:37] they knew about god now look they could
[1:13:39] see all those ten
[1:13:41] they could see all those ten reminders
[1:13:43] those those altars those signs they
[1:13:45] could see them all day all day long
[1:13:47] they knew about god but they didn't know
[1:13:50] god
[1:13:51] and that's exactly what jesus said
[1:13:54] you've done wonderful works in my name
[1:13:56] but i never knew you because you work
[1:13:57] iniquity what does that show you your
[1:14:00] works show how much you know god amen
[1:14:03] your works declare whether you know god
[1:14:05] or you don't know god in other words
[1:14:07] your daily life shows if you know god or
[1:14:09] not amen
[1:14:11] if you're constantly working
[1:14:13] righteousness or you're constantly
[1:14:14] working iniquity that proves if you know
[1:14:17] god or not
[1:14:19] just a miracle of itself doesn't prove
[1:14:21] that you know god
[1:14:27] and then james 2 verse 19 says you say
[1:14:30] you believe but the demons believe
[1:14:33] and they tremble at god
[1:14:35] at least they tremble
[1:14:36] see that generation before joshua died
[1:14:39] they wept and trembled oh god don't let
[1:14:41] this generation not know you
[1:14:44] but they wept
[1:14:46] because they knew god and they didn't
[1:14:47] want to see how could after all we've
[1:14:49] seen after all we've done after all the
[1:14:51] battles we fought how could the next
[1:14:53] generation forget yet they did
[1:14:56] and we find out in the next few verses
[1:14:58] why they forgot
[1:15:02] a generation rises
[1:15:04] that doesn't know the lord like the
[1:15:06] previous generation knew the lord
[1:15:14] look at verse 11 and the children of
[1:15:15] israel did evil the sigh lord and served
[1:15:17] balaam you know baal worship well it had
[1:15:20] a lot of sexual sins in it
[1:15:24] right
[1:15:25] uh the bail the bale gods were fertility
[1:15:27] gods
[1:15:29] right so they would go and they would
[1:15:31] have like prostitutes and all kinds of
[1:15:33] things and they would sacrifice the
[1:15:35] babies if somebody got pregnant
[1:15:37] a lot of child sacrifice
[1:15:39] so see what entered in what distracted
[1:15:42] this young generation from the ways of
[1:15:43] joshua sexual pleasures
[1:15:49] that's what see if the young generation
[1:15:51] doesn't know god that's what's going to
[1:15:52] get them too
[1:15:54] right sexual sin
[1:15:58] because it's pleasurable
[1:16:00] and
[1:16:00] and the young generation hasn't made god
[1:16:03] their pleasure
[1:16:04] they've not sought after god they've
[1:16:06] never called on god
[1:16:08] they never found their real joy in
[1:16:11] holiness praise god
[1:16:14] they're pleasure seekers of the world
[1:16:16] instead of seeking pleasure from the
[1:16:18] holy spirit
[1:16:20] so the next generation says well we're
[1:16:22] going to have sexual pleasure instead of
[1:16:24] obeying the ways of god oh it gets ever
[1:16:26] it gets every church if the church isn't
[1:16:27] born again or the next generation is
[1:16:29] born again sexual sin will get them
[1:16:31] every time
[1:16:35] now skip down uh verse 12 says they get
[1:16:38] other gods they bow down verse 13 they
[1:16:41] forsook the lord and serve baal sexual
[1:16:43] sin and asteroth she's the queen of
[1:16:45] heaven now what does that remind you of
[1:16:47] mary they call mary the queen of heaven
[1:16:51] what's that remind us of catholicism
[1:16:55] so they went to worshipping women
[1:16:56] worship
[1:16:57] or
[1:16:58] ancestor worship
[1:17:01] right spiritualism
[1:17:04] and sexual pleasures in other words they
[1:17:07] they believed everything that was
[1:17:09] fantasy instead of the reality that
[1:17:11] their parents had tried to teach them
[1:17:14] and that's the responsibility of all my
[1:17:16] children
[1:17:18] and all the children in this church
[1:17:20] you have to know god
[1:17:22] and the way you'll know god is when the
[1:17:24] enemy comes you either cast down the
[1:17:26] enemy or you give in to the enemy
[1:17:28] you either live for pleasure or you live
[1:17:30] for christ amen that's how you know
[1:17:32] praise god
[1:17:33] and don't tell me that that previous
[1:17:35] generation didn't teach them the word of
[1:17:37] god
[1:17:38] joshua said my house will serve the lord
[1:17:42] amen in other words he taught his
[1:17:43] children the word he told him everything
[1:17:45] he knew but pretty soon a generation
[1:17:47] rose up not maybe not joshua's children
[1:17:49] but somebody in their tribe and they
[1:17:51] wanted pleasure more than they wanted to
[1:17:53] remember the ways of god
[1:17:58] so see it comes that each person has the
[1:18:00] individual choice
[1:18:02] god's not going to force you to serve
[1:18:03] him god wants you to choose to serve him
[1:18:05] amen
[1:18:06] i don't know
[1:18:08] god wants you and your free more agency
[1:18:10] to say i'm casting down these pleasures
[1:18:13] i'm casting down these lusts of the
[1:18:15] flesh these pride of life and lust of
[1:18:17] the eyes i'm casting this out and i'm
[1:18:19] choosing because i love god i'm choosing
[1:18:21] god's ways
[1:18:31] verse 14 and the anger lord was hot
[1:18:32] against israel he delivered them in the
[1:18:34] hands of the spoilers that spoiled them
[1:18:35] and he sold them into the hands of their
[1:18:37] enemies round about so they could not
[1:18:38] any longer stand before their enemies it
[1:18:40] got so bad they couldn't resist the
[1:18:42] sexual sin they were just slaves to it
[1:18:44] they couldn't resist the child abuse
[1:18:46] they couldn't resist the
[1:18:48] the heresies
[1:18:50] the doctrines of devils it got so bad
[1:18:53] that now god's angry at them
[1:18:56] because they don't even fight against
[1:18:57] the sin ah god help us amen
[1:19:00] see that's why your addictions have to
[1:19:02] be overcome
[1:19:04] amen
[1:19:05] you have to overcome your addictions or
[1:19:08] you got to keep up the fight amen
[1:19:11] keep up the fight don't give in don't
[1:19:12] become addicted keep up the fight
[1:19:17] like brother like i was talking about
[1:19:18] austin you know we're going to battle
[1:19:19] things it's going to go it's going to be
[1:19:20] gone for a while and it's going to come
[1:19:22] back
[1:19:23] you got to be ready before it comes back
[1:19:24] so you don't become a slave to it
[1:19:26] especially if you battled that thing
[1:19:27] before
[1:19:29] you got to be ready to drive it off you
[1:19:31] got to be ready to fight you can't stop
[1:19:33] fighting you got to be a warrior you
[1:19:35] gotta have the fighter's mentality amen
[1:19:38] praise god
[1:19:43] now look at verse fifteen wherever
[1:19:44] wherever they went out the hand lord was
[1:19:47] against them for evil so instead of god
[1:19:49] sending hornets before them and helping
[1:19:51] them like we saw on sunday instead of
[1:19:53] god
[1:19:54] tearing down walls of jericho god was
[1:19:56] fighting against them and causing
[1:19:58] everything to fall apart
[1:20:01] see we want to see god going before us
[1:20:03] fighting our battles making a way
[1:20:04] opening doors closing doors right
[1:20:06] guiding us into his perfect will
[1:20:09] we don't want to see god fighting
[1:20:11] against us
[1:20:14] and the bible said they were greatly
[1:20:15] distressed so see fear
[1:20:18] right when people are fear fearful
[1:20:21] depressed and living wicked like that or
[1:20:24] living with this sin it shows they've
[1:20:25] lost the battle
[1:20:27] they're not winning the battle if you're
[1:20:29] living in distress all the time and no
[1:20:31] victory oh we should have some we should
[1:20:33] have the shout of the king in the camp
[1:20:34] amen
[1:20:35] i didn't know yeah if you're living
[1:20:37] above sin brother said don't uh uh don't
[1:20:40] jump no higher than you're living but
[1:20:42] church i've said this before if you're
[1:20:43] living over if you're living over lust
[1:20:45] you should be able to jump at least this
[1:20:46] high
[1:20:47] right now if you're living over if
[1:20:49] you're living above fear you ought to be
[1:20:51] able to jump at least that high and
[1:20:52] pretty soon i'm going to hit my head on
[1:20:53] here
[1:20:55] brother man said don't jump no higher
[1:20:57] than what you're living so if you're
[1:20:58] living let's jump like that praise god
[1:21:01] let's jump for jesus amen if you're
[1:21:03] living above those things let's rejoice
[1:21:05] in it let's remember i've got the
[1:21:07] victory praise god
[1:21:09] i'm more than a conqueror in christ
[1:21:10] jesus
[1:21:12] that's why sometimes i jump and shout
[1:21:13] and dance because i am living above
[1:21:15] these things i remember what it was like
[1:21:17] being a slave to the canaanites but i'm
[1:21:18] no longer under them i'm a free man i've
[1:21:21] got my possession i'm resting in the
[1:21:24] holy ghost amen
[1:21:26] hallelujah and i'm fighting when they
[1:21:28] come back austin i'm fighting and
[1:21:30] driving them back out praise god
[1:21:33] i don't let them stay on my land praise
[1:21:35] god they're not allowed in this church
[1:21:36] praise god
[1:21:38] those critical spirits and everything we
[1:21:40] battle
[1:21:41] spirits of depression or whatever more
[1:21:43] false doctrine that'll try to get here
[1:21:45] we don't let them stay we drive them out
[1:21:47] in jesus christ's name
[1:21:49] because we're fighters amen
[1:21:54] hallelujah
[1:21:56] we should be winning victories all the
[1:21:58] time
[1:22:00] and because of that we should be more
[1:22:01] than conquerors in christ jesus
[1:22:04] how many believe that
[1:22:08] now in verses 16 through
[1:22:10] 19 we see the pattern
[1:22:14] that israel fell into without joshua
[1:22:20] despite all their serving sexual
[1:22:22] pleasures and idolatry and queen of
[1:22:25] heaven and all this catholicism
[1:22:28] god raised up judges who would deliver
[1:22:30] them out of the hand of those that
[1:22:32] spoiled them
[1:22:33] and yet they would not hearken unto
[1:22:34] their judges they went a whoring so
[1:22:36] there's a sexual sin like spiritual sin
[1:22:38] right spiritual uh
[1:22:41] spiritual
[1:22:42] transgression is just like sexual sin
[1:22:44] right
[1:22:45] it's like a spiritual betrayal right
[1:22:49] they went whoring after other gods and
[1:22:51] bow themselves unto them they turned
[1:22:53] quickly out of the way which their
[1:22:54] fathers walked in obeying the
[1:22:56] commandments of the lord but they did
[1:22:57] not sow
[1:22:59] and when the lord raised up them judges
[1:23:01] then the lord was with the judge and
[1:23:02] delivered them out of the hand of the
[1:23:03] enemies all the days of the judge for
[1:23:05] repenting the lord because of their
[1:23:06] groanings by reason of them that oppress
[1:23:08] them and vex them
[1:23:10] and it came to pass when the judge was
[1:23:12] dead that they returned and corrected
[1:23:13] themselves corrupted themselves more
[1:23:15] than their fathers
[1:23:17] in following other gods to serve them
[1:23:19] and to bow down unto them they cease not
[1:23:22] from their own doings nor from their
[1:23:23] stubborn way
[1:23:25] so it's this awful cycle
[1:23:27] and i actually got a picture let me go
[1:23:28] to the picture here real quick
[1:23:30] so it's that one right here so here's
[1:23:31] the cycle
[1:23:34] cycle is first
[1:23:36] well i guess the first sin would be
[1:23:38] their sin they bow down they get
[1:23:39] oppressed by nations they repent god
[1:23:42] would send deliverance but during the
[1:23:44] times of peace they would get lazy on
[1:23:46] god and then go back into sin and get
[1:23:49] under oppression and each trial got
[1:23:52] longer and longer and longer each time
[1:23:55] after deliver they were longer in sin
[1:23:57] longer in depression longer and bondage
[1:24:01] to slavery each time so god had to raise
[1:24:04] up a conqueror each time a judge praise
[1:24:07] god
[1:24:09] and this is the pattern without joshua
[1:24:13] is what i'm going back to
[1:24:15] this is the pattern if you don't have
[1:24:17] joshua in your camp
[1:24:19] if you have people that know joshua
[1:24:23] you're going to have some victories but
[1:24:25] then you're going to be worse off for a
[1:24:27] while you're going to need a deliverance
[1:24:28] and for years and years you'll be slave
[1:24:30] to sin and then you'll get a victory but
[1:24:32] then you'll fall back in this pattern
[1:24:34] you won't have consistent victory you
[1:24:37] won't have the enemies driven out but if
[1:24:39] you got joshua praise god you'll drive
[1:24:42] out king after king after king after
[1:24:44] king and you will clear the land praise
[1:24:46] god you'll possess all the promises
[1:24:49] you'll drive on all the inhabitants and
[1:24:51] you'll enjoy the good land that god
[1:24:53] wanted for you praise god
[1:24:56] but judges shows what happens when a
[1:24:58] generation rises and they don't know
[1:25:00] joshua
[1:25:03] their sin gets worse each and every time
[1:25:06] well they repent for a while they're
[1:25:07] good for a while they go back to the
[1:25:08] drugs or they go back to the sexual sin
[1:25:11] or they go back to the denomination it
[1:25:13] gets worse and worse and longer and
[1:25:15] longer and longer it's the cycle of
[1:25:18] death and revival brother man talks
[1:25:20] about the church age book
[1:25:22] but church our cycles are very short
[1:25:24] it's not like this we have a cycle we
[1:25:27] backslide but then we repent and get
[1:25:28] back to god
[1:25:30] it's not like we were backside for three
[1:25:32] weeks or four weeks no no our backsiding
[1:25:34] should last a couple days or maybe less
[1:25:36] than that
[1:25:37] praise god
[1:25:39] we should have such a conviction of the
[1:25:40] holy spirit that we couldn't imagine
[1:25:42] being backslidden for a long time
[1:25:46] could a man i can't imagine being
[1:25:47] backslidden for a year can you imagine
[1:25:49] that
[1:25:50] living and smoking and cussing or or
[1:25:52] drinking or fornicating or adultery for
[1:25:54] a whole year
[1:25:56] no way
[1:25:58] not in the house of the living god amen
[1:26:01] when we backslide it's just a short time
[1:26:04] and god gets us right back in the path
[1:26:05] of repentance right back in the path of
[1:26:07] obedience praise god
[1:26:09] because we know joshua
[1:26:12] hallelujah praise god i met jesus amen i
[1:26:16] know jesus amen he's fought my battles
[1:26:18] praise god i can never forget him amen
[1:26:20] he brought me the land amen amen
[1:26:24] i was there when he circumcised me
[1:26:27] i was there when he knocked down the
[1:26:29] walls of my enemies praise god i was
[1:26:31] there when he drove out
[1:26:33] my my addictions and my bad habits i was
[1:26:36] there i know what i saw praise god
[1:26:39] amen
[1:26:44] in verses 20 to 23
[1:26:49] end of the chapter
[1:26:50] god's anger is against the new
[1:26:52] generation
[1:26:53] for their idolatrous transgressions in
[1:26:56] other words they would live and
[1:26:57] worshipping those gods for years and
[1:26:59] years and years till they finally got
[1:27:02] tired of it they'd cry out to god see
[1:27:04] that's why we need to pray every day
[1:27:07] pray tonight before you go to bed say
[1:27:08] lord jesus forgive me anything can
[1:27:10] forgive me and start fresh tomorrow
[1:27:12] morning
[1:27:14] don't let that any backstage or any sin
[1:27:16] go you mean we should we should all
[1:27:17] leave here forgiven
[1:27:19] right don't get in the habit
[1:27:21] of a cycle of sin
[1:27:24] break the cycle and start a cycle of
[1:27:26] victory praise god
[1:27:29] the lord left some of the enemies to
[1:27:30] prove him or to prove them whether or
[1:27:32] not the next generation would serve him
[1:27:34] or not
[1:27:38] so what is judges i'm closing here
[1:27:40] judges is a picture of trying to live a
[1:27:42] holy ghost-filled life but lacking the
[1:27:44] baptism holy ghost this is what we got
[1:27:46] in a lot of messed churches today
[1:27:48] they've received the word about the land
[1:27:50] in other words
[1:27:51] they know about the land they're raising
[1:27:53] the message but they don't have the same
[1:27:55] experience that the previous generation
[1:27:58] had
[1:28:00] and so idolatry comes into the land
[1:28:02] sexual sin comes in the land heresies
[1:28:05] come in the land
[1:28:06] money hungry people come in the land
[1:28:08] covetousness greed right fear adultery
[1:28:12] all these things they all come in the
[1:28:14] land
[1:28:15] they were born in it
[1:28:17] but they got to have a birth themselves
[1:28:19] amen after they need they need to birth
[1:28:21] themselves praise god
[1:28:23] amen
[1:28:26] judges shows what happens when a
[1:28:28] generation rises up that doesn't know
[1:28:30] joshua
[1:28:32] jesus christ
[1:28:35] it shows humans are their own worst
[1:28:37] enemies now look at this church israel
[1:28:40] now they're back in bondage under the
[1:28:42] judges
[1:28:43] despite being out of egypt
[1:28:46] in egypt they were slaves but now
[1:28:48] they're in the land and they're slaves
[1:28:50] again
[1:28:52] see so it doesn't matter where you live
[1:28:54] amen
[1:28:55] it matters that you get a new heart
[1:28:57] praise god
[1:28:58] amen
[1:29:00] you've got the holy ghost you can live
[1:29:02] clean in the midst of laodicea amen
[1:29:05] hallelujah praise god i'm in satan's
[1:29:07] eating but yet i'm a blood wash i'm a
[1:29:10] blood boy i'm a holy ghost failed saint
[1:29:12] that loves to praise god amen
[1:29:15] i trust in god for everything
[1:29:17] amen
[1:29:21] hallelujah
[1:29:28] see that's why uh holy ghost-filled
[1:29:30] saint he can be in a church where maybe
[1:29:31] some of them aren't born again and he
[1:29:33] can change the atmosphere and pray for
[1:29:35] them and bring the people under his
[1:29:38] anointing or her anointing
[1:29:40] they can still survive
[1:29:43] when you're a holy ghost-filled saint
[1:29:44] you can survive anywhere because you
[1:29:46] know joshua
[1:29:48] you won't forget joshua praise god
[1:29:51] you'll remember all joshua's great deeds
[1:29:54] because something when you saw joshua
[1:29:55] something happened something anchored
[1:29:57] into your soul something was sealed into
[1:29:59] your conscience amen when you saw joshua
[1:30:02] when you knew him when you know when you
[1:30:04] saw what he did you can never escape it
[1:30:07] it was written on the fleshly tables in
[1:30:09] your heart amen
[1:30:10] hallelujah
[1:30:15] see we've got to take the sin out of our
[1:30:17] own minds now that we're in the land
[1:30:20] paul so brother austin paul was one of
[1:30:22] the greatest christians there ever was
[1:30:24] he said he labored more than all the
[1:30:26] apostles paul he didn't even know jesus
[1:30:28] in the flesh he only knew jesus by the
[1:30:30] holy ghost but yet he said he saw a law
[1:30:32] and his members
[1:30:35] that would bring him into bondage to the
[1:30:37] law of sin and his members so paul would
[1:30:39] sometimes become enslaved to sin
[1:30:43] he said o wretched man that i am who
[1:30:45] shall deliver me from the body of this
[1:30:46] death
[1:30:48] so there'll be times in austin where we
[1:30:50] will fall short we'll fall short of the
[1:30:52] glory of god and we'll feel like we
[1:30:53] became enslaved
[1:30:55] and we'll feel wretched but we always
[1:30:57] must remember that jesus christ will
[1:30:58] deliver us from this flesh
[1:31:01] praise god
[1:31:02] he will
[1:31:04] now the book ends in judges 21 25 with
[1:31:07] these words
[1:31:08] in those days there was no king in
[1:31:10] israel every man did that which was
[1:31:12] right in his own eyes
[1:31:14] so i love how the book ends the book
[1:31:16] ends and this is church
[1:31:18] this book of judges is has some of the
[1:31:20] most violent and disturbing stories in
[1:31:22] the entire bible
[1:31:24] remember that last one where the
[1:31:25] concubine is raped and abused and cut up
[1:31:28] and sent all over the land that's the
[1:31:29] last chapter of judges
[1:31:31] some of the most wicked things in the
[1:31:33] bible are in here because they don't
[1:31:35] know joshua
[1:31:37] they forgot about joshua they knew about
[1:31:39] him up here but they didn't know him
[1:31:41] here praise god
[1:31:42] they have the same faith that joshua
[1:31:44] they weren't strong and courageous they
[1:31:46] just had head nows i don't want head
[1:31:48] knowledge of the message i want it in my
[1:31:50] head but i really want to end my soul
[1:31:52] praise god
[1:31:53] that's what i want the knowledge of god
[1:31:55] amen here so my very nature is to do the
[1:31:58] word my very nature is to obey the word
[1:32:00] amen and know that god is watching and
[1:32:02] he'll fight for me praise god
[1:32:04] and i don't have to serve other gods
[1:32:07] but i'll serve only one god
[1:32:09] the god of israel
[1:32:13] see judges
[1:32:18] these stories prove
[1:32:20] of the depths pew warmers or churchgoers
[1:32:22] will go who have no personal experience
[1:32:24] with christ raising the message raising
[1:32:27] the promised land but they don't have an
[1:32:29] experience with jesus christ that shows
[1:32:32] or because of that no experience they'll
[1:32:34] go to the world for pleasure and have
[1:32:36] awful things happen in their life
[1:32:38] because they don't know joshua
[1:32:40] are you glad you know joshua
[1:32:43] let's stand to our feet
[1:32:46] i'll stop right there so that was the
[1:32:47] main thought i don't know if i'll preach
[1:32:48] another sermon on this but have you
[1:32:50] enjoyed this series by god's grace let's
[1:32:52] thank the lord for his grace and mercy
[1:32:53] praise god thank you lord musicians can
[1:32:55] come

[1:33:01] let's sing that onward christian
[1:33:02] soldiers can we just play that
[1:33:05] this is my prayer

[1:33:15] that help me to be a leader for christ
[1:33:17] jesus
