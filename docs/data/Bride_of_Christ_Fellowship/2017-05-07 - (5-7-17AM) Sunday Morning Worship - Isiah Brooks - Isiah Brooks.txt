[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] how many of us believe that soy de Ulua all of gospel this will give praise God thank you sir you love the Lord amen yes as we stand by God's grace we ask that you turn with us to Saint John we're going to read from the twenty upon the fourth chapter to the 23rd 24th verse Psalm 63 they will go to longer stop there 23rd verse of the fourth chapter of st. John but the hour cometh the New Testament the gospel Matthew Mark Luke and John but the hour cometh and now is when the true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and in truth and now listen because Jesus says shall worship the father in spirit and in truth yes for the father seeketh such to worship Him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth David yes Psalm 63 Psalm 63 we go to read the first few verses there please God how many of us love the Lord amen you know there are we look at at what's happening and we we must understand it we should be in any man we should be in a great anticipation of the the coming of the Lord yes however you want to say it but I believe with all my heart that we're living in the last day Psalm 63 and 1 Oh God thou art my god early will I seek thee my soul thirsteth would be yes my freshman lonely buddy in the in a dry and thirsty land with no water in to see that time that I glory so as I have seen thee in the same two air and because thy loving-kindness is better than life my lips shall praise thee a great father God we come before your Lord we thank you for your grace in your worship yes you we thank you Lord for being so good to us yes because father you have been better than me bid to myself raise our energy with lesser service in a special way yes Lord with not coming form of fashion where we come Lord in your name cause we know how we exhaust your Lord high above the heavens you are the God of all creation yes Lord we lift up your name because you're worthy to be a great father we have no glory of IO but not bit depending on you this morning as well we have no power allowed yes no revelation of all yes but father we are depending upon you who you bless your people this morning we ask these things in your lovely name Jesus Christ have thine own way they manly the Amen by the grace of God we just want to share if you would thought this morning and I trust that it would be a blessing to you amen I know as a pastor there in Iowa we have been seeing a lot of things come through of what we call the message and by God's grace I trust that God is telling us victory in our lives today all agency we are worshipping as they had a man we love the Lord a man yes and when we think about him we must understand who he is and who were thinking about who were meditating on yes but anyway we want to go ahead I'm gonna say too much but I was studying the message and I saw a quote that inspired me coming from Jehovah Jireh the Prophet goes on and he says I was noticing in this afternoon while I was studying Joe Jordan he is called ammonium and Joel was ridiculed made fun of what a picture today but John was resting in Elohim promise so after the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh shall I see God whom I should have seen for myself resting in el-medina and I thought to myself that's it [Music] resting in Ella him that's been sucking this word and Lewis Neville him Ella him Amen is the Lord car seat when we call this lady Lord God it is in the word of el Ella Elohim which means the self existing life there was nothing that existed but here there was no air there was no light there was no sauce there was no world there was nothing else it was God a God alone l-o-l here that we sing that song but I wanna do we understand what we worship me so you know when we talk about Elohim we talk about his attributes and we think we say well God in his Conejo his attributes he he wanted to be a father he wanted to be a savior he wanted to be a healer but you see all of them were in what we would call God's nature understand now because we find out in Peter Peter tells us that we can be partakers of God divine nature be who he is what he is and uh we were grateful with thankful for God it meant to to allow us the Sheep who we worship remember amen at thee oh well when Jesus met the woman at the well he he would go up all the things about discernment and telling her who she wanted how many husbands she had but what profound statement Jesus laid with that God the Father was seeking such as those who would worship Him in spirit and in truth now a lot of us we we we we we face because we can feel this unknown thing in them we can feel his presence you know all of that that that we were there and we have arrived but you must understand there is a death or there's arm a deep thing about that because all people can praise you because the Bible says let everything that hath breath praise the Lord but there are only a few that can truly worship Him in spirit and in truth hallelujah Wow I marvel because people say well I'm I'm worshiping in the spirit well I know that when you worship God in spirit you produce a life there is a life that is produced when God's Spirit lives in healing the best way to worship hallelujah if you are how can I say impersonate the thing that you worship me for example if you see somebody that worships God boy seen the heart stop what does that even if you do you put on a cowboy hat he'll put on the cowboy buckle he'll put on a cowboy shoes and he wants to look exactly like the star that he's worshiping right that's the desecrated worship for the worship is to try to live your life according like the star that you worship II is that right the best ways that worship God is to live my god hallelujah see you and hospice understand with Jesus it is up re gonna meet the scripture say John 4:23 2:24 says but I will come into now here when the true listen that word of true worshipers shall worship the father in spirit and truth for the father seeketh such to worship Him God is a spirit and they that worship Him must worship Him in spirit and in truth is that right now you sure what do you mean understand that Jesus himself though he was God in the flesh the Bible says the fullness of the Godhead dwells in him right how did he worship God I'm told my how did the man Christ Jesus worship I one of the things he says I can do nothing except the father show me tonight mister your private brother said Jesus never healed anyone and Esther drill maja because you find out that Jesus never read a scripture for you in just a minute so you can understand what I'm say a lot of times we think fresh when we think of Jesus yes but Paul said I know not even Jesus after the right tip Paul have a greater revelation of who Jesus what a melon dude Noah thought he didn't stop just at the min Jesus cuz of then Jesus had the street right the man Jesus have you eat all right how do you believe Jesus cry yeah yes but there's a greater entity no something greater and the flesh of Gina has another passion Jesus administration oh yes hallelujah but there was a greater thing happening there when Jesus declared and I'm jumping in the scripture when Jesus declared I am my father what yes they wanted to stall him when jesus told his disciples when you see me you see the father right right I want to scho him no doc not that knowledge but but not not his disciple but the people he spoke because all they could see was the housing of God right right and Jesus never talked about his flesh right hallelujah and he was talking about the God that was in him and saying this is in st. John Fox 31 34 I'm going to preach this whether we get headache along excited I'm feeling sorry because I can see Jesus ha hey is that what that's what brother Brown said he said he said those are the Greeks and all they came says shy we would see Jesus yeah oh and what did Jesus do he gave them a parable of a sea yes yes basically was saying you see the but you don't see me cuz I am the seed of God that's right and this evil about alone he does not flinch it it was not crushed hasn't died to a chef yes oh yes but I'm telling you you will not Yahiro says yes but Jesus to me he took the whole Bible he preached it in one barrel yeah I see parable yes yes and John is actually what God was going through do from the beginning to the end amen and he told us there was a good sheet ago Sebastian the good she's afraid for God and the fast sheet of rain for the devil he told us was a good sheet what happened to him and when but what would happen to the bad seat see we should all in just that book they and they were confounded because they couldn't understand what Jesus was talking about but anyway let's move on Jesus justified of who he is in st. John 5 beginning of the 31st verse he said I bear witness if he's a if I bear witness of myself my witness is not truth because he making bread on himself all right if you make an testify of himself but that doesn't mean that your testimony is true right right teeth there is another that bears witness of me and I know that that witness which is he witnesses of me is true you sit unto John and he bear witness unto the truth he said John man witness unto the truth yes is that right right John said the guy the man who I see the Spirit of God this is the fun he that's the one yeah greater than ayat and yeah it's on said he's made up and he says I I am not worried could even lose the shows right right say John's been waiting for my sneezes ah Stephen T he said what I'd receive not testimony from me but these things are saying that she was insane he was a burning and a shining light and you were willing for season to rejoice in his eye yes yes Wow yes sir John and powerful industry he was a burning and shining I have you rejoice T yes he said but I have a greater witness than that of John yes hello somebody for the watch which of all has given to me to finish the same work should I do bear witness of me that the father have me John gasping witnessed but I have a greater witness because the father when a witness a quiet a man I come to you all that he wants me to do in yeah oh come on somebody let me we'd be you know with the fact that Pharisees in all them they said we have Moses we have Abraham but the greasers sure we want to see Jesus it is yes the father himself which have sickening have borne witness of me you have neither heard his voice at any time nor seen his shape now he's actually talking to the unbelievers now right why would you say you ever seen his voice nor seen in shape because he's actually standing before them and they're blind of who it is amen yes I'm in television amen he said Annie I'm not his word upon you for whom he have said he believed not now I will tell you something there's a lot of people even in the message who say they believe the message yet they don't do with the mess you say down man yes sir it was here you can also cost you the profit you know that God will be the prophet but you not a believer - you do what prophecy yes amen right so you have hardest work you have none his work of art in uniform ooh yes you you believe not now it's amazing because they did not know they were unbeliever right right because when God Jesus began to talk to them this is what we have Moses you don't say but he saying you had Moses you don't understand who I am Moses and all the prophets spoke of me and I'm standing here you say you believe Moses yes you don't believe me right hallelujah come on somebody then when you think about it I'm not trying to trick you with this message I'm trying to focus us we all today yes hallelujah there's only one Lord and that's what the Lord said could be I would pass and I try to be a good one and you know sometimes I find myself worrying about the Saints in the church the people in the church yeah and God says you can't save him right salvation is of the Lord I Amen hallelujah he rolled that burden away because I realized no matter how much you preach I will you can scream you can you can do whatever you want but if you fall it electrifies the heart didn't say to us chop you with something amen you see that's an audience with when you we need when they set off he daddy that they get those electrical thing they said he won right God has to do that yeah whoo come on whoo almost certainly and the beat the thoughts he knives he's gotten offers you're living here right yes be alive he was not a situs up I hope that's what we walk hallelujah he told about us I'm gonna say he want to know what God is giving to us it is what he was a see a band a kinky right yeah a man people rival right in it hallelujah hear me now praise God he said as a father himself with her Sydney have formed witness of me liturgical Bangkok he goes on to say and he have not his word abiding you for whom he have sit him he believed now he goes on his head shots the scriptures but in them you think you have eternal life and they are they which testify of me yeah Amen hallelujah that wasn't the flesh of a man speaking that was God speaking through the lesson yes hallelujah is that right you saw a scene brother Brooks remember brother balancer here's Mike it's not you when you go search it up go search it out I think I got a quote about it but he goes on the same no let me move okay that might stop me ah my funniest thing you must understand if you can see and have a revelation of who Jesus Christ really love oh yes you can have a revelation of who you are yeah yeah because he ha I wasn't thinking one even as we are one understand the was this yes sir yes sir hallelujah we don't understand wonders with God like the trinitarian oh those who say God is to God is not he's one man yes now you have to receive revelation on how here's one yeah hey man yes sir hmm it goes on as I listened and he will not come to meeting that he may have life I receive not honour from being Jesus was in it over make is over you so wonderful and in their heart that could be lying to you right right brother right I've had people at all I enjoyed that song and you know they did you understand me people can give you testify view and lie all the time but I'm not interested in what people are saying about me and God is a role I was hard to see good well done my good and faithful sure yes yes oh yeah it goes out if you stand in your life because you're gonna need to hear that just right right hey Dad y'all here my shame yeah the song is true you want the pastor somebody to pat you on your back but that's done counseling that right oh he don't know is it y'all only God knows what's in your heart oh you don't say yes hallelujah girl akashi obviously not on for me but I know you that you have not the love of God in you now how did Jesus Christ not with God but he said I know that in you you don't have the love of God that would very much use that would have been a job right better right wake me up Lord yes I love you wake me up yeah shock me how do you make me see if I don't love you like I'm confessing with my mouth yeah me yeah amen Laurie I want to love him that the scripture says off the loving yeah my mind with all of our soul you know what you know is if you have nothing else out of you I am coming my father's made and you receive me not you know I came out of the oneness and I could never understand that I come in my father's name well he's got a father and he is the father how can that be but jesus said I cover my father's thing remember he taught also what he said listen he said God is seeking such as would worship Him in spirit and in truth all right right I believe in getting the message a male arm I'll skip a line but even read about him describe it you told he goes on to say that Jesus will be setting on the truck and about him will be the purifier right right yes sir it looks like too but it's not it's one right amen but you must always realize hey God the spirit is above all amen yes somebody yes you say okay I'm a multiply for you're not a total one time once I want I want I want to come all the way down still is one right right we said we're added to our family no no no that's a multiplication because a family at one oh yeah God is one yes right the family of God is one don't be a sucker that no man can suffer it's still one all right hallelujah I come to my father's men usually not how can you believe which even she ought listen how can we believe which receive honor one of another right right and seek not the honour that comes from God yeah amen you say exchanges to me here the Bible tells us that John's disciples miss the coming of Elijah right he not because their disciple said well we thought that Elias was supposed to come and Jesus said I tell you he's come all right all right and you didn't know it yeah did he go to st. John Oh call on the neighbor Todd he's a cop doggies and not be one greater venture right since the time of the prophets because now there's a different disposition but he's working with John Kallis he was breathing-- Johnson saw Santa Claus yes and the father who was God and shall witness come down like a dog and said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased to dwell me right come on somebody amen you say well what do you think I'm trying to get there so you can understand who if you diffuse eases ease and what is purpose for coming yes because about said no man has seen him at any time right the only person who seemed in the Sun in the Sun declares him yes Ryan yeah you must understand him in that here was caught and then manifest and shot in the flesh he was hiding himself to the world but I'm their buddy and shock to the belief that's exactly what he's doing right now hey dad it's okay yes sir Oh Nicky do not feel that I woke you bliss and he goes on this is not you you're looking you want on from God you want honor but you're not seeking the one you should be getting I'm a proud blessing it was when you never hurt Oh John the Baptist bragging on himself right but here was Jesus bragging on John right yeah you don't say that's who you want to brag on you yeah you don't gosh have you considered my servant job see that's the kind of bag you is eternal yes oh yeah and see this is what Jesus said you will either put you shaking in the wrong place what you see the other that will come from God oh yes all right it was your father is it always good when people say you know you know you've done well to help are you understood he wanted honor from God yes yes he wanted God a vindication the people say whatever they want say right Osia true let's go gone there's a we look at the string it isn't missing but I know you that you have not told me he says how how can you believe right is it do not think that I will accuse you to the father is it understanding I still stand as a witness against you right I'm going to accuse you to the father see he said there was one that accuses you even Moses the truth yes yeah prophet they say they believe and follow with that and a few step and unbelievers yes yes sir and that's how it's gonna be even in this day we'll find out the same way around we'll stop there and accuse a lot of people in the special yes yes he will ha because they fail to know who was behind the veil with the heart we see a vision of God he wasn't preaching back for him shout he was trying to get the people who see the Holy Ghost the spirit that was behind his manners hey man glorious glory hello yes oh I've heard people say you know that the fluids of the Godhead how do they do out in brother Graham not good yes sir god bless you the foot of God the Godhead bodily depth working Jesus Yeah right amen yes Danny and he couldn't share what he had until he went that to what he was yeah and on the day of Pentecost that fool is broke himself up into 120 pieces all right laughter three thousand hi oh but as long as he remained one single guy so he could not share all right right oh come on somebody the fire had to be split up yes sir yes sir this is like this program he said we are a location off oh god yeah yeah that's like eternal life yes yeah not you Oh Lord I believe the Lord you know I confess it with my mouth yeah it nesic into salvation but it doesn't stop there right holiday you gotta believe and continue to believe it to segregation yeah I need to tell you I can't take the value right and then how do you expect to receive the Holy Ghost yes sir and then come on somebody is sanctified you and it fills you yeah it changes you oh come on all the ways you me and all of a sudden you feel changing atmosphere and you feel the Holy Spirit all you go pray God that is so wonderful he won't stop there he don't want to stop on your flesh yeah getting your spirit how do you yeah he gets in your spirit he goes into all smooth and clean you out yeah yeah we can walk thought I didn't need to do this big when he he's clean all that out and you know he's got interest into the Holies of Holies he goes in there Electrify yeah yeah 500 you know you can change yes amen help me Lord Lord see no man can go into your heart right oh they said brother brother discern don't you understand what that deserving was when brother brother went into that channel he himself couldn't even remember what he said try hey Matt yeah because that was not the man brother friend that was the son of a yeah tell us Jesus Christ Himself yes because he is the word he was using brother branham's live yeah he was using brother brothers my body his mind but that was the whole ego that was God Himself come over here yeah okay can do yes glory going down into your heart come on somebody yo you're gonna say but she that's what you must understand that even if Jesus couldn't do nothing except the father saw him we around couldn't do nothing except the father sold Lord y'all know well preach it like this because in this message people want us to bow down to an image that's right brother right yes amen it's moving folks before knocking you know yes people is to bow down to the image of a prophet but Paul said was I crucified for you say no close we go right wall sit don't worship me yeah Wow sometimes the dumbest is true he's really crafted he'll make you think because you've got an honor brother BAM which we do but I'll follow him with every word but I'll never worship him alright brother right amen yes sir know somebody yes yes and people what they found out they call this lame way to find more than they call on Jesus now tell me who you worship me I run right yes sir I'm just trying to tell you something chief they faith because we we we did the down is a smart fella yeah brother come to my church and that's what inspired me Joe he said well you gotta say like this you gotta say like this you gotta say like this out there and I thought to myself my holy ghost was just getting greed I was just greed it a matter late Lord what I said you got to help me help me help me out me any up ah didn't you say the image yes we would've never known that shut by the running total that's right realistic image was built it was Daniel speaking yeah go ahead and the King may live and all the Jews bow right not the lowest Shadrach he's checking the pinnacle but Daniel would not jung-mi yes no the God that unveiled the mystery of the dreams was not him hey Callie hey yes sir and that was gone with a ball yes even making yes sir ma I know it makes you a little nervous because we've been taught so many things you know I don't want you to ever think that I'm trying to preach against brother Bradley I thank God for my prophet I think I know who he was I know who he is amen and I can hardly wait to see it when I know there was a God who created for your friend right there's a car waiting Yeah right yeah yes all right Oh reached out give me okay hey Maury that was someone greater than him laughs Laura now I'm gonna tell you something nobody can tell me that he wasn't Mellet I hope right right mother right I know better than that you know what I'm saying yes sir but I see people moving into a ramp where you know a friend of mine he received a message from someone and said you know you got to stop preaching and the other stop playing around the tapes on it otherwise you will cost profit ah no sir did not true that the Bible said if you add or take away yes God will add and take away yes sir yes sir gonna move remove the fivefold ministry right brother Brian you can do it and not be taken away from the word got a damaged dad but you see I understand and people don't like this but they said you know that take with it because I listened to a tape and I listened to tapes but there was a time I had a situation going over my life and I needed God coming through the chains you know all kinds of complexes and everything else it I felt like a city without walls and I needed God yeah and I was listening to one of the taste and brother man was preaching was right there their prayer line he said sister he said you're going through your change of life and you just said to yourself Lord am I going to make it I just prayed that Lord to my cooker he said you'll also make it and I said the Lord God is my witness whatever demons I had left me [Applause] the course of man now the loss of top right is well have to Jesus see people are looking at whatever you look for that's what you get yes but you gotta understand there's a voice in a voice that's why I'm running away from them because they produced this message as though it was man-made yes this was not man-made right okay hey I'm so happy that God is in this manner that we're fishing off it's a shame that was the hider fail oh holy the holy risk of this man reason a lot of me a mention actually II of this matter in our own in that was failed yeah it was cop is where you are if you are eating of this manner tell me where you are where are you you are how the church ages yes sir yes sir so you can only feast on the holy of holies man hey mad daddy come out of the Holies of holding to give you nothing you had to be behind your veil to eat it exactly right amen and you up behind of it yeah he's you are in the presence of Allah yeah allow it man make you turn from just a - dick yeah to an almond tree branch yeah ready forth fruit cut off somebody is that the crew yeah oh lord help me the reason why I'm saying because the Bible says God is a jealous God neither is there salvation in any other yes but there is no other name given a among me under heaven given among men that we must be saving that's the name of Jesus Christ area and even to a lot of message to leaders I can preach Jesus I could save Jesus but as soon as I said brother branham said right brother ah right nothing what you worship it yes sir yes sir yeah because the word she spoke is the same word she spoke see and when you can see if you can jump off of Gina then jump up we around with is okay but when you just

sir yes sir see when you call on Jesus there's got to be the response any people say and let me tell you something - what's happening - a lot of the message people this called ago brother felt like he's gone and they right hope this over roll thought okay if I'm riding in the workers young I'm saying and my point is you know I believe with all my heart programs he said like I said and you know people have been parroting barricade you know the parakeet arimathea him since he left they have no revelation of this message yes sir let me ask you something what is the deepest revelation of this message when Jesus said in that day you do I'm in the father the father is in me and I am in he can't get no deeper than that amen amen that step will take going away sir y'all here will say but you can learn all of the quotes and everything else about the future home you can learn managing divorce and all of that you can learn all all see if you can learn it understand all mysteries right and have not charity which is God God is love he said it profit you know right amen bingo you should play in force this is this is rapture time yes oh look at the sixth seal and I'm closing this off I finished this evening if that's okay yes sir you know my my thing is you know look at even the side you say that that this fall ba-baby california out there washington is locked he's got so many depression so much pressure up said in the moment if it's great this is a six-year program ties in the front running away with the rapture and he goes on to say he said because at the resurrection of Jesus there was a mighty earthquake yes so he ties it into the sea because how is the world being so much chaos evil mission they won't even know you're gone oh but this world is real isn't rocking will be sitting in here with a face hallelujah translated now I don't know how long we will help to stay on the earth when it happened but I couldn't know what they we're not far from ooh hallelujah I really don't want to see this world because it's going to get worse I don't want to continue to see what I'm seeing not as hard you don't say listen is this okay presidental said either you say you see so what I'm saying brother battle for purpose because I don't want you to think I'm saying it saying brother branham is wrong but if you don't know what you what what you're repeating of what who's whose inspiration it is you think it's a man's exploration know it's caught am I making myself clear but I want you to know that when I when I go down on my knees I dress geez yes I ain't knowledge the Lord in all my weight when I close my prayer is in the name of the Lord Jesus whenever I go to do something when I wit it that's what I try to tell somebody I said there's something to people in this person who's never gone the cabin everybody cuz nobody preaches it whether that's your heard of Calvary message Easter are you gonna go down how are you gonna tell you people what all they are and they don't even know why what was Jesus how come he was naked like I tell her somebody don't you know uh-uh uh-uh he was the first to hang over the street and cursing with me because she hung on their tree and then because he became she was stripped to became naked and she honed a trim and now Jesus had to hang on the tree and had to be stripped naked because of me Jesus had to be real about that virgin because he even lost her virginity the understanding he had to undo everything he did to bring forth the raw you'll see see and that's what people don't understand he did far more than what people understand all he took away the curse of the serpent and all of us are familiar with the curse of the serpent every time you get a pain the curse of the serpent and something cause that to be in your body see every time somebody got that's what that's all about and then we see the guy comes along it making Jesus Christ and we need to follow in him that's all I'm saying you need to fall in love with Jesus Christ I'll tell us about that I'm trying to go lumpy the reason is adjustable you know it is true it's like what people think well I had a brother tell me this years ago and he's a brother you better be careful what you say you better be careful but I can't tell you I can only take what God showed me and you don't have to believe but I'll tell you what I think he searches the time brother Brown said there was a white rock it was no writing or doing anything and he told those could you see said you stink and standards look on this rock could I come back they didn't stay they walked away and every one of those creatures that call on him and then came back with their own revelation of the message huh huh yes he did it wasn't it wasn't the body will shake of people called people creatures but either off the air is it the preachers call the people too and all they had to do because everyone had the revelation of the thunders the revelation of his breath the revelation was missing that the other and then they fed all that stuff to us yeah and whistling Lord will be all the miracles where all the signs where is where is God and God can only honor the original seat you got to go back to what he said and not somebody else's interpretation or something else I want to say but it's so amazing how God you know God he says I gotta go rebel said a true loud fast declaration experience with Jesus will cause you to only glorify Jesus Christ a man he said there was Moses I got the coded policies he said in bills Moses there was Elijah and there was Jesus and he said a day of the prophets were over and he was to glorify Jesus and told me you get together but somebody said well brother Branham say thirty a day well let me show with you scripture says when John Jesus were getting ready to raise up Lazarus from the dead jesus said Lazarus is sleeping sorry like brother where are you sleeping but the Bible says so they can understand he said Lazarus is dead we know that for the grandest evening but we also know he did go to his grave site you hear him say he's as dead as not as was but he's alive because he is dead that's what I'm trying to say and here's what he ain't dead oops my point is this he is a lot but he's trying to sell someone somebody say I'm dead he'll nobody's saying I'm finished he's not finished you're the fish I love fish when I go to the grave they bury my dead body that's the only thing today hallelujah and then but yes I'm alive the real me King that's what he's saying but people said well you know he's I don't know why they do what they do but it's because they don't read the euro they don't take no about it then I'm closing on this if you got any questions you can ask me I'm not offended in questions my point is I'm just trying to get us to see and to follow us you got to go back to Calgary you got to go back to Jesus you said brother that's great before the scenes can be open Jhansi he saw counseling first he saw a lamb that was slain fun foundation work he can in order for the season for him to see what will be on that he first had to seek out the working of the Holy Spirit the working of God in Jesus Christ he's it is really he heard a lion in the attorneys all that him so hard to sing is in order to make a raptor who who you marrying this is what I want to say you know either he comes and get Rebecca and it takes Rebecca on the camera lady she's got the Holy Ghost cook brother I'm said that that camera represented the Holy Ghost and he says you order the Holy Ghost to take you to LuAnn when I will she's a lot of water in the Holy Ghost whose warning it you know that's too much fanaticism that you don't have that like this you know you carry out what's wrong with you I'm watering a Holy Ghost [Applause] they don't look you shout because they say see they curse the Word of God by calling into the cobbler you better be careful Mexican because if you look at that word in the nasty dirty way you are blasting I didn't Auster brought you to Liberty a man just set you free the day it was your jubilee and there is no way you've got interaction without a filler cost experience he added to the word he didn't take away from it and I just had all this dead and that's what's happening leader they become so arrogant and so high-minded everything else they become a Pharisee in his method and they fail to see that's not the way it was supposed to be William Brennan was the most humbling man I ever seen I've never met him personally but when I hear his testimony when I see his takes on when I see his life he was oh and if we're feeding off the same thing he's feeling awful was feeding off it ought to make us humble right customer if I had a bottle of wine and I was drinking that money and you want to some of it hey guess what that whining oh say what I know the fish'll to win - the way I did by the rules no no that one might do her words it all feels a lot stronger system is or how we keep it might cause me to laugh or might cause me to cry but it might cause her to run and then they say why but it's going to have the back it's going to stimulate you it's gonna do something come on tell me amen oh where we got a full word and they say well I'm glad birth birth I want to tell some of these regions the promise not a thing it's not needle think the word is God the word is a person Oh be in the worry what that's exactly right but what are you talking about the real other the other one the ribbon now the level of the spirit no that's right see you now must understand God is trying to get us the see what's gonna happen when the squeeze come you think you're going to read your Bible brother Brennan said event that these doors the doors are these kind of church is gonna be shot you're not gonna be able to read your Bible where is it going to be I'm coaching this man said to me they have 40 prophesy over me and he said oh I had my Bible cook you know something up when I travel some time I take my Bible with in my hand I go to the referee when I will study especially I got a layover keep my Bible then I get to the restroom with me like don't touch me I want you to know who I am no people scatter the Bible you know they see that book so all you guys do if you don't you want to walk down somewhere it means dangerous take your Bible and put it there Devils are scared of your Bible tells me you're a young you don't know you can sit at a box set up an arrow with my behind and I'm isolated I'm segregated everybody should ever wear without me you don't want to be bothered take your Bible he said to me all you that kind of funny Christian you gotta take your body with you all that said listen my father was in my heart look that's right the bus that he wrote it you my heart I may not even know is written but when it's wrong is it gonna check yes hey somebody see is it not you too kind of person I want to talk to but anyway let's go I'm closing on this host I'm saying it's the promises of ello you Jesus made us promises but that was LEM making a promise the venting system and Jesus and God is the one that's why I said I come in my father's name um you know I wanted you to see them so this is what look like right so when you see me you see the father when you talk to me you talk to the father that's who I am we me and the father I wanna see I couldn't I couldn't Hawk but I doubt the Scala Church they said I said Jesus praying to a good God they said he was praying to himself y'all believe that he was playing to the Father the Spirit the unseen force right oh my god France - the same one Abraham prayed to you understand so he was praying to the the self-existing one the one who spoke the logos right see that's why this thing must be about faith because you can't don't even try to break it down and reason it out it is what it is I the father one and then right and one day we must come to that where we say I am the father of one man with God comes into this ministry listen in the way back he says he was standing here wearing my suit that it gives me he could do no more that's all he could do was vindicate that he's Christ prove that he here you have to believe him I can if you believe see that it right now if you believe it that's all there is to it it looks to me like it ought to eat Electrify see what I'm trying to say the reason why I know people don't have a revelation of who they serving because a preacher can get up and he's preaching the very words of Elohim and they don't get excited but if brother Branham was here the understand then get excited and brother Adam a piece the same things that preacher is preaching see that money goes on he comes up the unveiling God somehow we allow Satan to bring us into a charge setting and we see brother Bruce you are missing it you're losing what God is doing I'm just a veil for him is his word that I'm preaching and repeating to you to gain faith in your soul and if you can come and you can hear God in his heart that that's Scott preaching you can go out here with something great I've got a preacher and um you know he's really slow in my closing he when I say skull I mean he on you say a few words and what you call it wind up your computer stops a knitting through that circle would be called after buffering or something is you can put the low stuff on it right but anyway you know he'll stop and then he'll let the Holy Ghost then he comes again right and it's awesome but so these preachers wouldn't that bad because they're used to a certain flavor a certain taste of something gone brother as they did he said the denominations people didn't like me is it because I had I had no style of preaching and I've noticed that somehow ministers have develop a style in his message mm-hmm that's why you never know how no breach I don't have a style I don't even try it I don't set my note so - I've got the look on every one of them and make sure I'm getting it I got on my nose climax we laugh when they do it and they make sure they get to that point and they know gets going to be explosion because they've already worked with you psychologically coach oh my god don't want your mind he wants your heart a man and that's what I try to work with I try to work with the hearts of the people I want you to understand God in your heart understand you worship God here hallelujah and if you can get him on the throne of your heart he'll rule everything understand we're worshiping the Living God god I'll tell him who feels all in your wallet above all he is all and I'm telling you he never leaving over second he told me that a month ago so I was kind of feeling down enough you know he'll only believe you can hear the voice of God then why do you pray all I know it was back in here and he said to me I'll never leave you nor forsake that's all you need to say that's right and I just with the week to thank you lord praise the Lord okay I feel good just do that God is real folks he's real I'm not trying to tear down anything but you know what the loss yes coming see because you don't realize when when Elijah came back alone oh no he had to restore thing yes yes there's a time of a crowd is that right yes this is Rob remember the little middle of some trauma in Israel let me ask you a question is where did he lie to get all that where didn't I get all that water to feel those barrels three times amen on top of the mountain y'all um say see what people don't understand is that this message supplies his own water amen so watch it roll it runs out is that right listen he's a feel of what you fill up twice he did but the start time he filled up is red all over that's what this ain't genius it's supposed to be the third ball it is supposed to be where God will overthrow the vessels and let's sacrifice for such a common thing that the fire will fall and will be wrapped that way because the very sacrifice was linked up everything was lived up don't know yeah try boom he did it in Paul's day he did it in real around all day and now on the bride and the Son of Man is to come watch you love the Lord and I hope you did bless just trying to focus I want to encourage you but if you can see what I'm saying go back and start listening to those tapes for a different mindset not I'm going to hear your voice talk these tapes you see not not just the voice of a man over here use me to move right I'm going to preacher comes you need to say Lord I don't care if he's cross-eyed but I want you to speak but don't know that you're too bright if I had real good looks coming in here I'm preaching everybody with you in stand it's true our Delta the better-looking people get the best jobs in this world and somehow it is that long but I said that's what happened to the church you start getting all the Ricky right okay right amen right it wasn't good looking folks and they don't understand that's not we got hot all right gone house and simplicity he has a thing that you would think he would be you know you look at this new church compared to these big churches around here and they don't know God is over here I got the same color Church am i saying god it's amazing that both of us have churches in the back of the building I see that's gonna see you I hear you so you know we look at this thing overnight I want you to be focused now about is it that he will appear to those who love a man yeah at you Odia understand we talked about the foul and there were seven dangers that made that friendly the picture frame of the face of Christ that right yes sir several changes made the face of Jesus Christ so we know that brother Brandon was not Jesus because he was one of the angel who formed the face y'all know what I'm sayin it's like a puzzle when you make it a puzzle you put all the pieces together you what you do you know what to do you do all the edges first and you feel in the pieces just made that that portion and who's the fill-in and if you look at that picture you'll see all kinds of faces you know what the Lord told me and I'll be out of here I said at the judgment he said if you don't believe the picture you're not in the picture how would you think about what I said because brother all those angels were in the picture and brother Branham said each angel each messenger would bring his people with amen just think about never take only let God show you what I'm saying there is no doctrine about it you're not going to be lost if you don't see it but if you can see yourself because he said well know him it will see him face because let him talk about the mirror is that little boy looking at him any signs his face and stuff he says no that's all I'm sayin it's more to this message than you know that's a it's a supernatural God doing a supernatural thing with the supernatural people we're not supposed to be natural that won't be natural a Maddie amen I won't be supernatural all right I want to fake it myself as being supernatural yes sir when times get hard I will I want to be able to do supernatural now how I'm going to do supernatural when things get hard I do too like everybody say does it geez up I call it a lunatic now he is my refuge he is my help he is my strength right on him he comes and it fixes the problem yes yes that's what makes me supernatural I know the supernatural God that's you love the Lord yes sir I just want me to say anything that tough because I share things sometimes maybe I shouldn't maybe I should have shared that about the picture but I only say that because when I was a boy and that man came to me I was only maybe it was in six-three six-four six-five during that time and there's a white man came in Monday with y'all and heard me testified and like I said in that time only the milkman and insurance there's a lot in my neighborhood all right if he was white filling the lake right but the point in he came and he had that Life magazine with him I'm justifying it all over now because I know what what God was shared with me and and it was three or four of us there playing football and he said come upon coming boys I want to show you something and he opened that magazine he said the daughter soon to come he said can you see his picture his face in the clouds nobody could see his face in the cloud but you know that's all I can see it that's hard he closed the book and he walked off and I never seen the man again nor had I ever seen that magazine again until I came to the Sun I see so nobody can't tell me about that that it ain't right all right God showed me when I was a ball I'm sorry I didn't understand I do now hey man how are you yeah so I'm going to tell you something people say that was some kind of science you tell what that's a lot because they can do that now they can make some smoked chicken they could never fall in the face of God no oh people people are wake up and smell the coffee work yes fine yes sir you know I thank God for my prophet I thank God for God showing and running him you know but I know I've got so many cultural programs they don't worship me you know I don't need your glory you know he said and he said I can't go Asia I wouldn't go out with Taurus Eva I said glory he said come he won't let a remember Moses glorified himself and he was our God stop the reproach of the promise Lee that's right let me play some all these preachers that's glorifying himself they don't tell me they're not doing it because they didn't impose me I am a seeker than Iowa call us I look like this and you don't know you got people in the message they won't hear a certain preachers because they are up there that's wrong that is so wrong he's near to being glorified for something they didn't even do right brother man you find out he said oh he's are you preacher who's actually getting rich off of this message and he carries all about he said I'm for that did he interested in the souls of the people just like old people out there no denomination all he interested is money in the welfare right move people I'm gonna tell you my god grace you just out if you don't know how stated we said one chance and the boss said no that's not a that's not that's not all right right to say one chance you got one chance at this thing this is not chance it's election so God corrected me this is now the chair watching you got one chance this might be your last chance there's no chance the left will always obey right amen they don't come to God right it might be sooner it might be later but they don't come to God hallelujah don't know the elected even besting the Holy Ghost that's right they can't do it God is already justified them and I got with you but I'm just trying I want you don't you understand on the Lord hey man hey man just call this regularly than you've been doing you know praise God you know you just come but look what the Lord Jesus said from the
