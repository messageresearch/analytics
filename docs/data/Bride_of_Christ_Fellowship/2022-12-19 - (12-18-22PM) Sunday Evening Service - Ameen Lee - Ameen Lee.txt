My Savior praise God oh blessed [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] foreign [Music] great to be here in the house of the Lord you know I came out here because I didn't want to miss singing I didn't want to miss worshiping the Lord and now I was worshiping the Lord I got all my nerves out a lot of the nerves out so I want to thank the Lord for that praise the Lord I just want to come here before you guys I'm just your brother I'm the one special so I just want to share what the Lord has placed on my heart and hopefully they'll hopefully the Lord will speak to your heart as he did to me you know I there's an analogy I always thought of um you know when a Woman Cooks their food they take so long it takes like an hour or two just to cook a meal just to enjoy like five to ten minutes of good food and I feel like that's the same with our pastor he prepares days after days weeks after weeks hours after hours just to prepare an hour an hour and a half serving for us to enjoy the good word of God and I pray that you would enjoy this word too let's take our Bibles today and I would like to turn to Psalms 62 5. for all their semen well the Lord put this on my heart today as I had this um this topic on my mind for about three or four weeks and God's been building upon my understanding of it so let's read the work together one two three my soul wait thou only upon God for my expectation is from him amen you guys all may have a seat so my topic today is expectation so okay you know lately sometimes at church I come to church and sometimes I don't expect much from God I get used to this kind of routine we had going to church enjoying the ministry go home repeat same thing and I'm learning that you know I have been lacking in my expectation from the Lord and we shouldn't let Church become common to us you know it's great we have our pastor but treat Church treat God like a marriage you don't get bored of your spouse do you do you get bored of your wife or your husband you know if you guys get bored of that you guys try to find a new love try to um make things fall in love again you know start all start with that falling in love going on dates you know that's the same thing with God you know we come to church we shouldn't be bored of church you should come to church to expect to commune with the Lord God wants to have fellowship with you God wants you to come expecting him to talk to you for him to meet your need so let's not forget why we come to church in the first place we come to church because we want to see God I want to see God I know you guys want to see the Lord too and sometimes we place Fellowship over God you know we enjoy each other's company that's great but that's not the reason why you come to church we came to church because God is here we want to see the Living God God changed our lives we must not forget that he's done it all it's great we have our pastor he brought us to the Lord helped us fall in love with the God but it was God who drew our hearts to him let's look in the word what did Jesus say about this Matthew 22 37. and Jesus said unto him thou shall love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy mind this is the first and great commandment and the second is like this thou shall love thy neighbor as thyself what is Jesus saying the first thing you should do is love the Lord that's priority number one second priority would be your fellowship of your neighbor the people here at church and I know a lot of times we get confused about what's the lord's will for my life what does God want for my life the one thing you are constantly assure of is God's will is that he wants to have fellowship with you daily communion with you that's his will that's one thing you can always fall back on you don't know what God wants in your life God wants to fellowship with you he wants to commune with you okay so let me ask you so what is our expectation when we come to church what are we expecting when we come here are we expecting the fellowship with God or are we expecting to enjoy the company of other people after service you know did you put nothing into the service you get nothing out of it you know you reap what you sow if you want to see God pull on the word ask the Lord that he would move in this service and he will give it to you he will meet your need if you come to expect him so let's look at an example Mark 25 Mark 5 25. I think everyone knows this story about the woman with the blood issue I'm just going to read right here and a certain woman which had an issue of blood 12 years and has suffered many things of many Physicians and has spent all she had and nothing better but rather grew worse and when she heard of Jesus came in the Pressed behind and touched His Garment for she said if I may touch but his clothes I shall be made whole and I will skip down to 34. and he said unto your daughter thy faith had made thee whole go in peace and be whole of thy plague so I want to um the word expectation I want to compare it to another word that we we often forget and that is confidence when you have expectation you're also confident at the same time and you you can see the example of the woman was confident that if she just touched Jesus she would be healed well what kind of confidence do we have today do we have that same confidence that if we touch the Lord today that he would meet our needs today and let's look at there's a quote from Brother Branham I was listening to I'm not much of a corporation but let's this is from expectation 1950. I'm just going to read it and we'll go from there I'm expecting that to be there I'm expecting God when I'm praying in the room a few moments ago before entering the building seemed like something came over me that said something what's going to happen here tonight a great spontaneous healing I'm expecting that I will eventually say this to you pastors you will find out that at least 60 to 80 percent of every sick person in this building will be healed in the next hour see if that isn't right you can grab me a false prophet I know that when I'm speaking of that's right that is a lot of confidence in the Lord that he that God's gonna answer him and heal him of heal the people of their needs it's also looking confidence first John 5 14. and this is the confidence that we have in him that if we ask anything according to his will he will hear us and also Hebrews 10 35 cast not away therefore your confidence which had great recompense of reward go before the Lord with boldness you know you don't demand things from God I know that but you can be both before him like you go before your spouse you know you know force your spouse to go buy you something you ask your spouse and it'll be up to her if she wants to give it to you or not you know that's the same approach you're confident that your spouse will listen to you and that will take your needs in consideration and once he finds or finds a time to do it she'll do it or he'll do it that's the same approach with the Lord God wants to make sure you have your needs in that today he wants to make sure your needs are met yes so how confident are you that God can move in the service right now I believe all my heart that our Lord can can move in this service today I'm not talking about Wednesday I'm not talking about next week I'm talking about today and it doesn't matter who's preaching I'm I'm not anybody special but it matters that if you want to meet God today you can meet God today so there's there's a thing that sometimes we struggle with and that is doubt let's read on it on James 1 6. but let him ask in faith nothing wavering for he that waver if it's like a wave in the sea driven with the wind and tossed let not a man think that he shall receive anything of the Lord for a double-minded man it's unstable in his ways you know I want to bring this uh this thought of Doubt up you know what the Lord's been showing me that you know you can't control what comes in your mind right it only comes in comes out and it's up to you if you want to entertain that thought if you want to accept that thought of doubt and you know what you have the power the authority to cast that doubt from your mind if you want to believe something and you feel that doubt come up you can say nope I'm returning that back to the sender I'm believing the word of God you can turn that doubt away let me tell you when I got the Holy Ghost I was right here at the end of service everyone was gone and I was looking at this TV right here and I have so many doubts I heard the Devil tell me you'll get the Holy Ghost next week you'll get the Holy Ghost the next service when Pastor Jesse is here and you know what I told the devil no I'm not leaving until I get the Holy Ghost today I am getting it today and I went to Brother Simon's room and we prayed here and I got the Holy Ghost today so you have the you have confident confidence in God that he will answer your prayers and you can cast your doubts away if you have any doubts that come through for you okay another good another good Bible verse uh Genesis 32 26. I always look at this one a lot because this literally happened to me when Pastor Jesse you were testifying about brother dicks about that woman who had their hand up and brother Dix went and grabbed their hand that literally happened to me too the exact same thing so let's read Genesis 32 26. and he said let me go for the day breakth and he said I will not let thee go except thou bless me amen came and preached I stood over here everyone was gone besides me and my wife and I was praying right here on my knees I'm like God I want the exact same thing that happened to me that happened to that woman who had their hands touched that God confirmed that confirmed something of her need I'm like Lord I just wanted for you to touch me right here right now and I'm not leaving until you touch me that's how Bulldog was and a few minutes later my wife comes and turns around and she puts her hand up behind my back and that presence was the exact same presence I felt when I got the Holy Ghost it was like a three a hand that was three times the size of her hand and I felt that I'm like wow the Lord answered my prayer because I told the Lord I was not gonna leave until you blessed me and he let that come to pass [Applause] okay so expectation I want to talk a little bit about faith so do you guys know how Faith actually operates it's not just believing okay so look let's look at Mark 11 24 please therefore I say unto you what things so ever ye desire when I pray When you pray believe that you shall receive them and thou shall have them and Hebrews 11 1. now Faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen so I'm going to do a little analogy so say I have a hundred dollars yeah this is a hundred dollars say this is a hundred dollars and I had my wife come up here and she told me she wanted to buy a book okay so when I this is a hundred dollars when I give my wife a hundred dollars she does not have the book but she has the substance the faith to believe that she already has it she's not rejoice she's not rejoicing that she doesn't have the book but she's rejoicing because he has the money the purchasing power to receive what she wants that is the same thing with faith faith is an assurance of what you will get of what you hope for you don't rejoice in the hundred dollars you get but eventually you I want to see her holding the book that she wanted not the hundred dollars if you hold a hundred dollars there's something wrong with that you gotta put that faith into use use that money that Faith you get been given and use it to buy what you need go before the Lord and ask the Lord of what you need you know God has a spiritual economy up in heaven you know we have a economy here where we exchange everything with money well God's money is this the word of God the truth the promises of God this is God's currency when you need something you go before the Lord you find that Bible verse that you have in need of and you read it you believe it you obey it and God's or God is obligated to fulfill that promise in your life so every time you come to church you hear the truth of God that is like God throwing you free money that's what it is God's giving you money money now you gotta take that money and go do something with it if you want to buy a car you take that money you invest you wait until you get more money or get more faith and then when you're ready to receive that car you go out and purchase it you go out to them that sell it Hallelujah okay so there's for with faith there's three parts to Faith number one is your belief so what you are believing is not in yourself but you are Believing on who God is there's two qualities that God has that we should be we should have faith in first is God's Integrity let's read numbers 23 19. numbers 23 19. God is not a man that he should lie neither the son of man that he should repent he have said and shall not he do it and or he has spoken and shall he not be made good do you believe that God is a good being that God is a god of love of Good Intentions for you that's what that's what it means to believe in God's Integrity that what he says he does is not it's not like you can believe someone said this like say I believe Jesus said if you move them out if you have faithful emergency you can move a mountain I believe Jesus said that but doesn't mean that I believe that he can do it that's two different things so you first you want to believe that God has good intentions for your life that he's a god of Integrity everything in the Bible can you show me did he fail once he never failed once everything always came to pass according to his word according to it as well that's how you can trust God God is not a liar he will fulfill what he promised the second the second quality of God is this integrity and his ability to perform many people have good intentions but they can't perform it let's let's take this an example say I see a homeless guy on the street I have good intentions that I want to help them out but I don't have any money on me my intentions are good but I don't have the ability to perform it but that's not God God has good intentions and he has the power to perform what you need God can do both let's look at Ephesians 3 11. now unto him that is able to do exceedingly abundantly above all that we ask of or think according to the power that worketh in US praise the Lord faith is not just believing but it's also a part of it's part of the process like we're saying so first part is your belief your conviction on who God is God is a loving God second thing about faith is you have to find in scripture God's promise for your life God's promises are conditional it's always if if if do this and then this will happen do this and that will happen and once you find a scripture that pertains to your situation you make sure you obey it and then the third thing is you walk in the channel until you receive it so that's that's a three-step process in faith faith is not just believing faith is believing obeying and staying in the channel until you receive it a good analogy is Peter walking on the water right disciples on the waving sea the first thing Peter saw was Jesus and he said what Lord if that be you come come visit me to walk in the water yes what did Peter do he was convicted that that was Jesus right I know the second thing find the conditional promise what did Jesus say come so Peter all he had to do was obey he didn't have to consult his disciples all he did was just step out on the water and started walking towards Jesus and he the third part is to stay in the channel till you receive it and he got so close to Jesus right which Jesus was able to grab him right so that's the same thing but the the wonderful thing is when Peter went and he fell he was looking at the waves the wind and he started ground drowning the wonderful thing about it is it's not your responsibility it's God's responsibility to save you because you obey you you did what he told you to do you obeyed his conditional promise you walked out you followed the Lord and when you were right at the right spot when you were sinking God saved you God rescued you that is faith amen and God will also reward you if you desire to fellowship with him let's go at Hebrews 11 6. but without faith it is impossible to please him for he that cometh to God must believe that he is and that he is the rewarder of them that diligently seek him you know I'm gonna go back to the top of expectation you know expectation Falls with confidence and also follows with faith do we have the faith to believe that God can commune with us today I believe he can you know I always thought you know when I read listen to brother branham's sermons I'm always kind of get like a little jealousy a little bit about it because I'm like yeah I was I was in those days I wish that could happen right now why why did I miss out on it you know I wasn't born yet you know but you know what Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever he can do what he did in brother branham's day to this day you know I always think about you know sometimes people don't believe that it's possible like what brother bran had it doesn't pertain to our day you know that's the same equivalent of you saying the days of Miracles have passed you know it does not it Jesus does not change you know what he had back then we can have it right now and this is the groundwork to start going into the right direction into the restoration you know we want to go back to the book of Acts and this is the way to do it as come expecting that God can move in this midst in this church service and God did promise he will meet you let's look at Jeremiah 29. uh verse 12 and 13. then Xiao ye call upon me and shall go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and ye sound seek me and find me and ye shall search for me with all your heart the God not promise that he will meet you if you search for him Deuteronomy 4 29. but if from thence thou shall seek the Lord thy God Thou shalt find him if thou seek him with all thy heart and with all thy soul I believe he could come to this service and we can seek the Lord and we will find him here you know and now while we're going this topic you know we want to go back to the book of Acts and you know we have to understand we are not alone in this and if we all desire the same thing we can all pull on God and it gives a greater anointing a greater God's there to hear you because it's not just your faith and alone it's everyone's Faith who wants to believe in the same thing because they were all in one Accord and they were all expecting the Holy Ghost to fall they didn't know what it was how it was going to happen they all just knew it was going to happen if we all come in that one if we all come into that same mindset every service just saying God I just want to see you move Lord I don't know what's going to happen I don't know what's gonna what's gonna happen how it's gonna happen but I just want you to move I just want to see you move I just want to see the Living God I don't want to see a God that's just the history that people know I want to see a God that's moving in our lives in our midst [Applause] now at the discussion we always hear all the time Matthew's 18 20 for where two or three are gathered together in my name there am I in the midst of them how many believe that I know I hear that a lot and yeah I believe it you know but God's saying you know how real how much do you actually believe this because if you really believe this it's going to come to pass you know uh let's think about let's go on a topic of unity like if you think about a football team you got one if imagine if you're the only player on that team you're not gonna win you need everybody and not just everybody you need a good team a good team with one mind one Accord one Spirit under the Lord Jesus Christ and like how Pastor Jesse said earlier today we're on a winning team that cannot lose that's right it comes halftime we're still winning it comes third quarter fourth quarter we are still winning I love that amen sorry I I didn't preach long I'm about to close sorry but I believe God will restore everything he's already restoring it now but now we have to take our part and walk back to it so let's take the first step today by coming with expectations okay I'm gonna close so it was all stand up sorry a short sermon but I pray that it would reach your heart I want to close with this one example you know sometimes we come to church and then we leave out we go home and you know sometimes we like talk to our spouse and whatever and I kind of get caught in this wake where it's like you know God moved mightily today at church do you see that brother he got his prayer answer you know what God's saying what about you did God meet your need think about it when the Rapture happens are you going to be sitting here watching that brother be like praise the Lord You're Going To The Rapture what about you God wants you to be in it God wants you to participate God Wants You on the altar he wants you to come before him God promised that if you seek him you will find him God promised if you want him tonight you want him here you can have it if you want the Holy Ghost you obeyed God will give it to you God will give it to you whether God say yes or no wait he will tell you if you wait on the Lord if you ask the Lord you come in confidence be bold like Jacob Lord I'm not leaving until you answer my prayer Lord I'm not leaving until I get an answer be confident God loves you God wants to meet your need amen so now can I kind of come up here all right um on the piano can you play a song um only believe I love that song as we um pray as we pray I want to give you guys an opportunity to commune with the Lord I think that's the most important thing after the service is communing with the Lord talk with the Lord Make It Personal it says between you and God God I have a need today and I need it to be met Lord whatever you say Lord I just want to receive it that's our prayer take a few minutes right now to stop by your heads however you want to pray you want to pray out loud just talk to the Lord he is here he loves you he wants to meet your need just reach out your hand and touch it just reach out your hand and touch them he will answer you roses [Music] foreign [Music] hear our prayer Lord be our needs today Father foreign [Music] Lord Jesus we believe you are here in our Vista we believe you are here Lord no matter how long that service was gone the most important thing is this fellowship and communion with you after the word raise our faith up even more God to receive your word to receive your promise Lord Jesus here I am God Here I Am Lord pass us now pass us not Lord Jesus may your will be done Lord It's Your will that becoming with you Father Here We Are God commune with us Let It Be Your Will Lord let's meet our needs today let us come expect let us not leave until we get an answer from you Lord they're both confident like Jacob was let us touch your throne we believe God that you are here with us Lord Jesus we ask you Lord that you will pour out your Holy Spirit Upon Us Mr Lord Jesus for all your Holy Spirit oh God move among your people Lord let them desire you God let them year for you Lord let them not treat service just like another church service God but let it be changed today Lord meet indeed today Lord Jesus meet your people today for you are living God so
