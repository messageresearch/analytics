[0:05] second peter 2 18.
[0:10] you know i said earlier i wasn't quite
[0:12] done with that doctrines of devils
[0:13] series so i'd like to kind of go back to
[0:15] that here tonight my god's grace has
[0:17] been
[0:18] studying along those lines and
[0:21] it's a preaching sunday a lot of
[0:22] preaching right no teaching early sunday
[0:24] and last wednesday a lot of preaching no
[0:26] teaching so i'm gonna get back a little
[0:28] teaching here tonight by god's grace
[0:32] we need both like i was telling that
[0:33] brother you know
[0:35] from overseas i said jesus both preached
[0:37] and taught praise god so it's a great
[0:40] reminder to us that we need both by
[0:41] god's grace second peter 2 18 and 19 and
[0:44] i know i'm a little heavy on teaching so
[0:46] i asked god to give me some more
[0:47] preaching inspiration about god's grace
[0:49] but tonight i do feel like i want to get
[0:51] this thought across too second peter 2
[0:53] 18 and 19.
[0:56] i kind of got this thought while brother
[0:58] jim was preaching so
[1:00] he had said a few things and
[1:02] kind of inspired me to get back to this
[1:04] thought here
[1:05] second peter 2 18 and 19.
[1:10] this is the seventh sermon on doctrines
[1:13] of devils it's our fourteenth sermon on
[1:15] just doctrine in general but this is
[1:17] doctrines of devils part seven
[1:19] so verse 18 second peter 2 18.
[1:29] i'll read 18 and then we can read 19
[1:31] together
[1:32] for when they speak great swelling words
[1:34] of vanity now that's what we're seeing
[1:35] in the message that people just speak
[1:36] such great swelling words
[1:39] it's really not scriptural we'll look at
[1:40] that again tonight these swelling words
[1:42] they seem so great and so impressive
[1:45] but it's really a false doctrine that's
[1:47] right
[1:49] they the bible says they allure through
[1:51] the lusts of the flesh so as they make
[1:54] these great promises they actually allow
[1:56] fleshly lust on the side so they'll
[1:58] preach great things in front of you but
[2:00] then they allow they won't preach on
[2:01] certain lust of the flesh they'll allow
[2:03] that
[2:06] through much when timeless i can never
[2:09] say that word when timeless
[2:11] those that were clean
[2:14] escape from them who live in error
[2:18] to see where they lead these great
[2:19] swelling words lead people into heirs
[2:22] and verse 19 let's read that one two
[2:24] three while they promised them liberty
[2:27] they themselves are the servants of
[2:29] corruption for of whom a man is overcome
[2:33] of the same as he brought in
[2:36] which praise god
[2:37] so whenever a false doctrine overcomes a
[2:40] preacher it likely then overcomes the
[2:42] congregation
[2:44] praise god so that's why we want we want
[2:47] a sound doctrine the bible says no one
[2:49] doctors of devils amen let's have one
[2:51] more word of prayer if we can't hear
[2:52] tonight heavenly father i'm your servant
[2:54] lord speak my lord i come lord send me
[2:56] lord you've sent me here lord to akron
[2:58] many years ago lord god i didn't know i

[3:14] take control you deserve all the worship
[3:16] you're worthy of every song whether you

[3:21] about praise god so i trust you lord god

[4:34] mighty man sermon i did part two sunday
[4:36] but i probably have one more
[4:38] uh maybe a couple more we'll kind of see
[4:40] how that goes by the grace of god
[4:44] i'd like to look at part seven here
[4:45] tonight
[4:46] let me do it on time okay thank you
[4:49] okay stephanie sent me a text on this
[4:51] text
[4:54] thank you for your patience and
[4:56] hopefully she's getting that god space
[4:58] i just i wanna let everybody know you
[5:00] know stephanie's been uh
[5:02] coming to church it's been wonderful and
[5:03] uh i offered her a position now this is
[5:06] a
[5:07] position to help me editing my videos so
[5:10] over the years i've said anybody want to
[5:11] edit the videos and it's okay nobody did
[5:13] wanted to it's a it's a very arduous
[5:15] task it's not very fun it is no fun
[5:17] really though
[5:19] but she kind of stepped up and i brought
[5:21] the kids here yesterday and for an hour
[5:23] i kind of
[5:24] tutored her on how to edit videos and so
[5:26] she edited my full video
[5:28] uh the next video is going to be called
[5:30] snakes once had legs
[5:33] because the university of georgia proved
[5:35] it
[5:36] in 2015
[5:38] seven years ago so i just wanted to
[5:40] update the saints on that you know
[5:41] around the world those that listen in
[5:42] and um so she edited that for me so i'm
[5:45] very thankful and it took her two hours
[5:46] too i thought boy that's great
[5:48] i said that saved me two hours of my
[5:49] life so i said thank you stephanie so
[5:51] hopefully in the lord really going
[5:53] forward she can kind of fill that void
[5:54] and
[5:55] um
[5:56] help help me out i really hope and then
[5:57] i can just study more you know i can
[5:59] just study more yeah
[6:00] pray more rather than having to edit
[6:02] those videos i think that'd be
[6:04] so i just want to let you know she's
[6:05] doing a great job there and uh
[6:08] you know she always says great things
[6:09] hopefully she's live streaming now but
[6:10] she always says great things about
[6:11] coming to the house of god amen and
[6:14] ministering and learning
[6:15] uh so much in fact brother was it was it
[6:17] monday night yeah it was july 4th night
[6:19] we were out there talking and brother
[6:20] amen's parking lot who was parking that
[6:23] and she's like yeah all of a sudden when
[6:25] my friend died she said just the holy
[6:26] ghost came upon me she said i was
[6:28] i was weeping but yet weeping tears for
[6:30] joyce and i've got to get to the house
[6:32] and
[6:33] austin's like mom that's the holy ghost
[6:36] yeah that's right that's the holy ghost
[6:38] and
[6:38] so she's starting to feel that anointing
[6:40] praise god so may the lord continue as
[6:43] our prayers praise god
[6:44] it's you and a good fruit praise god
[6:46] you
[6:47] these last few months so
[6:49] very thankful for that by the grace of
[6:50] god
[6:52] so i'd like to uh you know just re
[6:54] rehearse just real briefly i'll try to
[6:56] set a timer here and hopefully i'll
[6:58] rehearse for
[7:00] you know just five minutes or so
[7:02] uh of course we get this idea about
[7:04] doctrines of devils from uh first
[7:06] timothy 4 11 up now the word doctrine
[7:09] scares a lot of message churches but
[7:10] that's because they haven't gone deep
[7:12] enough in the word of god right if you
[7:14] study the word doctrine the bible says
[7:16] christians should have sound doctrine
[7:19] it's it uh having right doctrine is a
[7:21] sign that the church is baptized with
[7:23] the holy ghost
[7:24] it's an absolute sign that's according
[7:26] to saint john it's verses eight nine and
[7:28] ten all right sorry second john rather
[7:30] second john verses 8 9 and 10. the bible
[7:33] says uh if you have the true doctrine
[7:35] then the bible says you have both father
[7:37] and son that's right hallelujah and so
[7:41] but doctrine has become an evil word and
[7:42] that's because we've had false teachers
[7:44] rise up over the years i'm just going to
[7:46] go ahead and name some joseph coleman
[7:48] lee vale
[7:50] we've had
[7:52] jeff jenkins you know we got a different
[7:53] one he's alive still but some of these
[7:55] other ones have gone past away now we've
[7:57] had so many false teachers rise up that
[8:00] uh many message people don't want
[8:01] nothing to do with teaching well they're
[8:02] missing out on a great revelation of the
[8:05] holy spirit
[8:06] because you have to have both and they
[8:07] say what they're saying now doctrine
[8:09] doesn't matter if you met jesus he
[8:11] wouldn't give you doctrine well that's
[8:12] wrong if you met jesus and he told you
[8:14] to do something that's doctrine that's
[8:16] right because doctrine is instruction
[8:19] and so this has become a dirty word but
[8:21] not in the house of god not the not
[8:23] where the saints really love the word of
[8:24] god amen it's still it's still a good
[8:26] word by god's grace
[8:27] but paul predicted this
[8:29] in the latter times some would depart
[8:32] from the faith giving he to seducing
[8:34] spirits so
[8:35] an evil spirit will be sly and crafty
[8:39] and will bring a doctrine but it'll be
[8:42] off the word
[8:44] jesus called it nicolaitans at the
[8:46] beginning that's right the doctrine of
[8:48] the nicolaitans and i went and
[8:49] researched that lord willing if i ever
[8:51] get through with the
[8:53] mystery of the godhead series if i ever
[8:55] get back to that then i still got one
[8:56] more mystery to preach and that's the
[8:58] seven candlesticks and the seven stars
[9:00] that's the only one i haven't preached
[9:02] yet out of that book
[9:04] and uh but i was doing the research and
[9:06] brother will you may know this but when
[9:07] polycarp first went back to the church
[9:10] of rome there was now three churches of
[9:12] rome and the first two churches he had
[9:14] he had miracles they had holy ghost
[9:16] revivals in the second church of rome
[9:18] and the third church of rome the dead
[9:19] were raised but when he went back to the
[9:21] first church of rome he walked in there
[9:23] and the first thing they saw was a
[9:25] statue of peter
[9:27] and then he sat down to watch the
[9:28] service and they had transubstantiation
[9:31] they were praying to peter they were
[9:32] worshiping peter
[9:34] so it was just it was just a few short
[9:36] maybe uh
[9:37] 50 to
[9:38] 50 to 75 years the first church of rome
[9:41] that started out right had already
[9:43] introduced all these nicolaitan
[9:45] doctrines
[9:46] and the laity had already uh become less
[9:49] than the preachers
[9:51] in other words now only the preachers
[9:52] had power only the preachers had give
[9:54] that's how it is in the catholic church
[9:55] today
[9:56] the the the priest is holy father holy
[9:59] father holy father
[10:01] and like he's so holy but he's not holy
[10:03] he's just a man like everybody else
[10:05] that's right
[10:06] but that's what pilocart found
[10:08] and he said the first thing they did was
[10:11] idolatry peter statue transubstantiation
[10:15] and then he said the next thing that
[10:16] they started partaking of the pagan
[10:18] festivals
[10:20] so for the church that'd be like
[10:21] partaking of easter egg hunts
[10:24] right now i'm saying i'll say this
[10:26] carefully worshiping christmas trees
[10:29] but if you put up a christmas tree don't
[10:30] worship it you're you're still saved
[10:33] right because brother branham did right
[10:35] if you condemn that then you've got to
[10:37] condemn brother bradley
[10:38] okay now i know that's offends some
[10:40] people but you got to balance it out
[10:42] that's right now i really don't care who
[10:43] i offend anymore i just want to please
[10:44] jesus he's the only one i don't want to
[10:46] offend amen it's the holy spirit praise
[10:48] god i just learned you have to be
[10:49] rejected so much you don't really care
[10:51] who you offend
[10:52] because the word of god is going to fall
[10:53] on good ground amen
[10:55] but they're also partaking of you know
[10:57] halloween type of ceremonies like that
[10:59] and valentine's day which was really
[11:01] wicked in those days they would put you
[11:02] know keys into baskets keys to their
[11:04] homes and different men and women would
[11:06] take different keys from each of them
[11:07] and they would trade partners for the
[11:08] weekend and it was just really really
[11:10] wicked
[11:11] and those kind of things started slowly
[11:12] coming into the church and now now look
[11:14] where the church of rome is today
[11:16] look look at that but polycarp found it
[11:18] like that worshipping the peter statues
[11:20] of peter now look they got statues i
[11:22] remember when we saw those statues
[11:24] at that catholic church everybody
[11:26] the whole vestibule was full of the
[11:27] statues they met thousand statues and
[11:30] they're encouraging get the statues get
[11:31] the statues but see it comes in really
[11:33] small it turns out you're gonna see
[11:34] where look at two more false doctrines
[11:36] that come in small
[11:38] they're related to the prophet of god
[11:40] but if the whole if the if the people
[11:42] don't search for discernment they'll be
[11:44] carried out they'll be seduced into
[11:46] idolatry that's right
[11:48] they'll be seduced into a sinful
[11:50] habitual lifestyle praise god right
[11:53] and so i got this thought while this is
[11:54] brother jimin and and just i just you
[11:56] know want to say what a great wonderful
[11:58] weekend that was with brother jim wasn't
[11:59] it yeah now church if you notice he and
[12:02] i have been in contact he was preaching
[12:03] a lot about the clothes you wear because
[12:05] that's what he's seeing when he goes to
[12:06] different places he's seeing the younger
[12:08] sisters letting down on the clothing so
[12:10] i just want our sisters to know that
[12:12] he kept hitting on the skirts and you
[12:14] know so i asked him brother you know why
[12:15] are you hitting on that he said that's
[12:16] what he sees he sees sisters now instead
[12:18] of wearing sleeves
[12:20] they'll wear no sleeves
[12:22] remember i told you about that then you
[12:23] can see bra straps well sometimes that's
[12:25] a great temptation for men
[12:27] right
[12:28] and uh he said they're really tight
[12:30] skirts you know with some of the young
[12:31] sisters he said it's even getting to
[12:32] some of the mothers and the skirts he
[12:34] says he sees them coming up
[12:36] so that so that's why he preached on
[12:38] that that was a burden that he had which
[12:39] i appreciate but i appreciate our
[12:41] sisters dress and holy amen but we're so
[12:43] small usually we can kind of you know if
[12:45] it hasn't really happened but if it ever
[12:46] happened we could kind of nip it in the
[12:47] blood you know you know
[12:48] i could preach on it and hopefully they
[12:50] could see it by god's grace
[12:53] but so that's what he's seen now i'm
[12:54] seeing totally different things because
[12:55] i'm not seeing that i'm seeing the stuff
[12:57] online
[12:58] prideful preachers
[13:01] that's what i'm saying so i'm preaching
[13:02] on that praise god
[13:04] to keep us from being prideful
[13:06] because if we have pride there's only
[13:08] going to be trouble in the church
[13:10] [Music]
[13:11] because the bible says through pride
[13:13] only comes contention
[13:15] and we don't want to come to church not
[13:17] not excited to come to church because i
[13:18] got to see brother so and so all right
[13:20] now i got to see such i want everybody
[13:21] to be happy coming to church that you
[13:23] can't wait to get to church
[13:26] pride is only going to cause division in
[13:28] our church my man said he calls it
[13:30] don't never let an arrogant spirit come
[13:32] upon you he said it'll be a poisonous
[13:35] church it'll hurt your pastor it'll hurt
[13:37] everybody in the church praise god so
[13:38] always gotta have divine love for
[13:40] everybody praise god amen hallelujah
[13:43] thank god
[13:45] now i'm gonna go briefly go through
[13:46] these so brother william when i when you
[13:49] were here in the in the winter i was
[13:51] preaching on this i've identified at
[13:52] least eight and i'll get to the ninth
[13:54] one tonight that's right
[13:56] some of these paul himself taught so
[13:58] paul taught when preachers say you must
[14:00] be celibate that's a doctrine of a devil
[14:01] that's of course that's roman catholic
[14:02] church but now it's like it's kind of
[14:04] morphed into well you can marry whoever
[14:06] you want
[14:08] or you can marry two three times so it's
[14:09] kind of morphed into that right anything
[14:11] the catholic church allows we know would
[14:12] be wrong
[14:14] okay uh then that paul also said uh you
[14:17] know they can't eat meat so it's a
[14:18] mandatory vegetarian so it's mandatory
[14:21] well now it's like well you can eat
[14:23] anything you can eat all food but food
[14:25] quickly becomes an idol
[14:27] and gluttony is still sinful gluttony is
[14:30] still sinful
[14:31] to feed the flesh more than you feed the
[14:34] spirit is an awful sin
[14:36] it's awful
[14:39] paul also said they were saying the
[14:41] rapture is passed already and there's
[14:44] some message people not a lot but some
[14:46] say we're in the millennium already
[14:50] this is the money i'm gonna buy
[14:53] i really would uh you know rather live
[14:54] than later to see you
[14:57] because the military is supposed to be
[14:58] peaceful and holy and
[15:01] there's supposed to be a mountain of
[15:02] holiness you know and lion can lay down
[15:04] with the lamb but my cat's still
[15:06] catching mice
[15:07] and the millennium the cat will lay down
[15:09] with the mouse
[15:11] i got some questions if we're in the
[15:12] millennium or not
[15:15] but you know uh it's false doctrine it's
[15:18] a devil saying that
[15:19] it's not jesus it's a devil saying these
[15:21] things
[15:25] and then you know i bet now this is
[15:26] different you don't find this in the
[15:27] bible so much but you do find it where
[15:29] paul says preachers about
[15:32] preachers will preach about jesus but
[15:33] the real god they have is their belly
[15:36] that's what paul said in philippians 3
[15:38] 19.
[15:39] and then i've heard different message
[15:40] preachers say oh you don't need to fast
[15:42] anymore because the lord's already here
[15:44] because jesus said well once the lord
[15:45] leaves then you got to fast well they
[15:46] said the cloud came now you don't have
[15:48] the fast that's a bunch of nonsense
[15:50] the cloud represented that the mighty
[15:52] angel had come down and he was bringing
[15:54] the revelation of the seven seals amen
[15:57] that don't mean jesus corporal bodies
[15:59] here that's what jesus meant my corporal
[16:01] body is gonna leave and when my
[16:03] corporate body leaves then you're gonna
[16:04] fast so we don't see the corporate body
[16:06] here what do we see our corporal bodies
[16:09] praise god we see the holy spirit moving
[16:11] praise god but we don't see jesus
[16:13] corporal body so we must continue to
[16:15] fast praise god we must continue to
[16:17] starve our bodies that our spirits might
[16:19] excel praise god amen remember i had
[16:22] that brother i met this winner he said
[16:24] in six years he said i've been in the
[16:26] message six years brother william he
[16:28] said and i've never met any message
[16:29] believer who's as thin as you that's
[16:30] what he told me
[16:32] i said brother that's a shame
[16:34] i said that's because a lot of message
[16:35] people are addicted to food
[16:38] and i said their god is their belly
[16:40] and i told the brother i said there they
[16:41] don't even have this they don't have
[16:42] enough anointing now
[16:44] most of them if they're not born again
[16:45] it's because they don't even this is
[16:46] control over your body
[16:49] yeah so how far are these message people
[16:51] really getting along the road they're
[16:52] not getting very far right
[16:54] so think about that what kind of church
[16:56] would allow them to get just that far
[16:58] and then stop
[17:00] what kind of sermons would they be
[17:01] hearing
[17:02] see you know so we got to be thankful if
[17:04] god's moved us past that we ought to be
[17:06] thankful god's brought us further out
[17:07] the road praise god amen
[17:09] i believe this i believe the the holy
[17:11] ghost joshua has not only brought us out
[17:13] of egypt and up that road of stature of
[17:16] every man of sanctification but he's
[17:17] placed us in the promised land he's
[17:19] filled us with the holy ghost and now
[17:21] we're driving out the inhabitants of the
[17:23] land now we're possessing the land the
[17:25] inheritance god had for us we're
[17:27] possessing the right relationships
[17:28] praise god but the gifts in our lives
[17:30] praise god all those five things i
[17:32] listen to i can't think of them now but
[17:33] god is helping us fulfill the will of
[17:35] god for our lives
[17:43] jude said they turned grace into
[17:45] lawlessness which is like the once saved
[17:47] always saved lie
[17:50] doctrine of the devil
[17:52] everyone will go to heaven doctrine of
[17:53] the devil
[17:56] now church the thing remember i'm going
[17:57] to just say this real carefully what's
[18:00] really close to this is that is that
[18:02] quote brother ram said where the angel
[18:04] said whoever loved you
[18:06] and whatever you love will be there
[18:10] everybody with me now god requests i
[18:12] think you're with me
[18:14] i said it's close that the what i'm
[18:16] saying is we can't interpret that that
[18:18] quote any way we want
[18:22] and the proof of that is when the bible
[18:25] said jesus looked at the rich young
[18:26] ruler and he loved him
[18:28] loved him
[18:30] and was brother tell us later that rich
[18:32] young ruler is the man who had the big
[18:33] barns and jesus or god said thou fool
[18:36] this night this day your soul is going
[18:38] to be required of you so did he go to
[18:39] heaven or hell he went to hell
[18:42] so if jesus's own love if that that's
[18:45] the right interpretation if jesus own
[18:47] love can't force people to be saved then
[18:48] how can yours force people to be saved
[18:52] and the church said right amen
[18:55] see how some of these false doctrines
[18:57] like to slip in
[18:58] real subtly
[19:01] oh everybody i love is going to be there
[19:03] well if that was the case church i love
[19:05] everybody on the earth i want muslims to
[19:06] be saved
[19:07] i want everybody to be saved hindus
[19:12] i want everybody to be safe as long as i
[19:14] can love them does that mean all over
[19:15] here to be safe when jesus said few that
[19:17] be that find the narrow road
[19:21] see how these subtle doctrines of devil
[19:24] slipping
[19:24] [Music]
[19:28] well hallelujah
[19:30] and then that the false doctrine this
[19:31] slips in the message too it started in
[19:33] the charismatic movement
[19:35] but god always wants you healthy and
[19:37] wealthy that's not true
[19:39] god does not always want you healthy and
[19:41] wealthy that's right
[19:42] in fact very few will be wealthy amen
[19:45] we're the wealthiest as far as america
[19:46] we're the wealthiest country right but
[19:48] most countries don't reach our wealth
[19:50] but can they still have spiritual riches
[19:52] you better believe it
[19:54] i've seen them pray like i wish i could
[19:55] pray
[19:56] praise god
[19:57] i've seen them worship like like i wish
[19:59] i could worship like that
[20:01] yet they don't have as much naturally as
[20:03] we have
[20:05] but it's okay there's different there's
[20:06] different experiences in every nation
[20:08] but it's all the same holy ghost praise
[20:10] god amen
[20:11] amen
[20:15] number seven
[20:16] i'm gonna do more on number seven later
[20:18] but preachers are presuming and exalting
[20:21] brother branham and his followers as the
[20:23] greatest of all time now brother man
[20:24] could be the greatest preacher of all
[20:26] time outside of christ but it's wrong to
[20:28] presume that if the bible doesn't say
[20:30] that
[20:32] then you're just presuming
[20:34] right you're venturing without authority
[20:35] you have no authority yeah acting like
[20:37] you got authority
[20:39] and jesus even jesus didn't say who
[20:41] would sit on the right hand or left so
[20:42] now you're exalting yourself like you
[20:44] know more than jesus that's right
[20:46] or you're so one with jesus that now
[20:48] you're basically speaking not saying the
[20:49] lord well if you're speaking so close to
[20:51] jesus why don't you give me thus saith
[20:52] the lord and so i know
[20:54] because i need to know when god's
[20:55] speaking and when you're speaking
[20:57] so i hear some other lies coming out of
[20:58] your mouth praise god
[21:00] like uh all every word on the tape is
[21:02] thus saying the lord said no that's a
[21:04] lie amen
[21:06] so you need to start saying god says the
[21:07] lord if you're so close to jesus
[21:09] and you know more than he did in the
[21:10] bible
[21:11] which they don't
[21:13] this is the one i ended on the last time
[21:15] this was part six
[21:18] some of them say rapturing faith is
[21:19] literally on the tapes
[21:21] it can't be that rapturing faith is
[21:24] anointing from heaven
[21:27] it's rain
[21:28] and doesn't rain off the tapes it rains
[21:31] from the seventh dimension praise god
[21:34] hallelujah
[21:37] right and it's proved because in the old
[21:39] testament they didn't have tapes but yet
[21:41] enoch still got raptured
[21:44] elijah still got raptured amen amen and
[21:47] that was before the blood of jesus
[21:49] christ amen
[21:51] so it proves the rapture has always and
[21:54] always will be an anointing that god
[21:56] sends down from heaven and that's the
[21:58] anointing we want to receive amen
[22:00] that's why we keep coming back to church
[22:02] that's why we keep praying and reading
[22:04] our bibles and believing because we know
[22:05] one day whether we live to see or not
[22:07] god is going to send that rain and i
[22:09] pray lord let it rain on me praise god
[22:12] if i don't live to see it that i know
[22:13] i'll be the first to receive it because
[22:15] the dead in christ will rise first amen
[22:17] amen i am praise god amen amen amen
[22:23] can you imagine that church and we're up
[22:24] in heaven let's say we die we don't get
[22:26] to live to see the rapture
[22:28] at some point jesus will come down to
[22:30] that sixth dimension and he'll say
[22:33] my children
[22:34] my sons and daughters
[22:36] it is time to go get
[22:38] your corporal bodies
[22:40] and we'll have we'll be on our
[22:42] theophanies and we'll say glory to god
[22:44] it's been a while i feel like eating
[22:45] it's been a while since i've been wow
[22:47] right because i haven't i'm in the
[22:48] avenue i'm going to spiritual body i
[22:50] have an eating
[22:51] and the lord come out and say or maybe
[22:53] an angel will come up maybe gabriel will
[22:54] come out maybe
[22:56] maybe michael will come out and say
[22:57] saints beloved beloved of the lord
[23:00] bride members it's time to go down the
[23:03] earth and get your corporal body oh my
[23:07] and then the bible said the dead in
[23:08] christ will rise first amen right so as
[23:11] we as we descend i don't know how it's
[23:13] going to happen but somehow the body is
[23:14] either going to come up to us or we'll
[23:16] go down to the body glory we'll cross
[23:18] dimensions we'll quote like brother said
[23:20] we'll cross the milky white wave praise
[23:23] god we'll cross that universe so fast
[23:25] and we'll go pick up that body and then
[23:27] we'll have all three bodies because
[23:29] we'll be the dead in christ rising first
[23:31] we're the first ones to experience this
[23:33] wonderful translation and then we'll see
[23:35] the living and they'll be translated
[23:37] we'll meet all jesus in the air praise
[23:39] god
[23:43] rapturing faith is not on a tape the
[23:45] tapes point to rapturing faith
[23:48] glory
[23:49] but rapturing faith is in the bosom of
[23:51] the father amen
[23:53] his anointing is his heart praise god he
[23:56] wants to pour it out to us and he will
[23:57] praise god amen
[24:00] either live to see it
[24:02] here or lift his seat over there amen
[24:05] either way i can't die praise god god is
[24:07] not the god of the dead god is the god
[24:09] of living amen this body may die but the
[24:11] soul will never die
[24:16] now i just briefly preached on these
[24:17] these are the battles we face
[24:20] right god knew the battle we faced the
[24:22] doctrines of devils at these times and
[24:24] season if you lived in jesus birthday
[24:27] when he was born you would have had to
[24:28] deal with herod slaughter of children
[24:31] if you lived in john wesley's day you've
[24:32] been kicked out of churches you'd have
[24:34] to have services outside in the field
[24:36] now this time of year we'd all like to
[24:38] have church outside
[24:41] i see some of you coming in the
[24:42] wintertime in the snow some of us leave
[24:43] when there's
[24:44] snow which i don't blame you buddy
[24:47] i wish we could i wish i could take my
[24:48] family with you
[24:50] i wish i could do remote teaching over
[24:51] there now
[24:52] they'll teach my class over here
[24:55] there you go we see you that's the
[24:57] battle they had to deal with in those
[24:59] days right
[25:01] in 1963 imagine you knew the seals were
[25:04] open and now the prophets got a greater
[25:06] revelational word and you'd want to go
[25:08] see him and you couldn't drive around
[25:10] the country because you had a job
[25:12] imagine the pressure you couldn't afford
[25:14] a phone hookup that was really expensive
[25:15] in those days yeah extremely expensive
[25:18] imagine the pressure i don't want to
[25:19] miss it i don't want to miss the rapture
[25:22] brother random said the other that we
[25:23] just two out of jeffersonville two out
[25:24] of new york you know remember that quote
[25:26] two out of uh pittsburgh or whatever you
[25:28] know two out of florida
[25:32] it's just a different battle
[25:33] imagine living in 1976 and battling
[25:36] those uh that deified the prediction of
[25:38] 1977. right well i got one year i got
[25:41] eight months i got seven months ago six
[25:43] months ago
[25:44] i gotta get everything right
[25:46] then the 1980s the seven thunders and
[25:48] all these false doctrines the two souls
[25:51] movement perugia movement of the 90s i'm
[25:53] just going to skip and then when we come
[25:54] in here i stand
[25:56] became an issue that divided people we
[25:58] had to live through that believe the
[26:00] sign in 2012 and now we're living in
[26:03] this time
[26:05] we're living through the tape church
[26:06] movement and it impacts the five-fold
[26:08] movement
[26:10] right because the preachers are now
[26:12] saying the rapture is hours away
[26:14] and they're saying brother branham
[26:15] cannot be corrected
[26:17] preachers are saying that
[26:19] where are they getting that they're
[26:20] getting that from jeffersonville
[26:23] right we just have to live through this
[26:26] we just have to
[26:27] persevere through this
[26:30] let me say like this we should uh we
[26:32] should excel through this praise god
[26:35] in other words let's not get weaker
[26:37] let's get stronger praise god
[26:40] how do you get stronger feed on the word
[26:43] eat some meat praise god the church said
[26:46] amen
[26:46] eat some meat
[26:48] get with the meaty things of god the
[26:50] discernment of the holy spirit
[26:51] discerning good and evil praise god
[26:53] that's right
[26:55] now
[26:56] uh the the issue here now i think i'm
[26:58] gonna skip past that yeah i'm gonna go
[27:00] to the ninth one now here's the ninth
[27:02] one i wanna add so this will all be
[27:03] fresh hopefully to you
[27:06] many people are making a tradition out
[27:08] of brother branham's life
[27:10] it's another false doctrine in other
[27:12] words if brother branham did it i can do
[27:14] it right
[27:16] right
[27:18] now the the trouble with this is
[27:20] uh because there's a seducing spirit
[27:23] behind it
[27:24] the people will actually misinterpret
[27:26] what the prophet did
[27:29] okay
[27:30] and they'll twist what the prophet did
[27:32] in order they could enjoy the lust of
[27:33] the flesh
[27:35] and in this case
[27:37] the example that i've been which brother
[27:39] jim was kind of preaching on that kind
[27:41] of led me this thought
[27:43] was well brother random watched movies
[27:45] now i can only find at least two that he
[27:47] watched
[27:50] and so that means we can watch movies
[27:51] too
[27:52] now there are there are good movies you
[27:54] can still watch today
[27:56] but there's cussing you better not watch
[27:57] it that's right
[27:59] right you better be fair i should say
[28:01] like that you better be very careful
[28:02] what you watch
[28:04] because it will take a stronghold in the
[28:06] kids lives or your lives
[28:08] and you'll find yourself more pulled to
[28:10] movies than the reality of the word of
[28:11] god
[28:13] praise god
[28:14] now like i was telling austin now for me
[28:17] i wasted probably half of my life before
[28:20] i come to the message watching movies
[28:22] and sports what a waste
[28:24] so most time when the kids watch a jesus
[28:25] movie i'll just excuse myself like i
[28:27] just can't i'd rather go study i just
[28:29] but it's okay they're watching jesus
[28:31] movies you know it's good
[28:33] it's good but for me
[28:35] i just can't do it i wasted so much time
[28:37] sitting on a couch or you know sitting
[28:38] in a movie theater i just can't
[28:40] i just want to study i just want to be
[28:41] in the word i just want to accomplish
[28:43] something for the kingdom of god
[28:45] watching jesus movies not that bad right
[28:48] now let me describe this so uh someone
[28:50] on youtube
[28:52] sent me this
[28:54] this doctrine of man this doctrine of a
[28:56] devil
[28:57] so this it's a woman and her dad was a
[28:59] message preacher
[29:02] okay so her dad was listening to brother
[29:05] brandon my brother said he watched a
[29:06] marilyn monroe monroe movie i'm gonna
[29:08] show you the quote he did
[29:11] and so the the preacher said well
[29:12] brother branham can watch marilyn monroe
[29:14] movies why can't i watch movies
[29:18] so then he did
[29:20] he started watching movies and they
[29:21] started watching tv shows i remember
[29:23] gilligan's island do you ever
[29:25] allen brother did they put that in ghana
[29:27] thank god
[29:29] you're blessed man
[29:31] well gilligan's island it's a silly
[29:33] comedy but they have sexy dress women on
[29:35] there
[29:37] and so this message preacher
[29:40] would watch that and his daughter you
[29:42] know growing up would be like
[29:44] that
[29:44] white if she's
[29:46] and she the woman would always show her
[29:47] belly there and you'll kind of wear like
[29:49] a bikini top or something like that and
[29:51] he'd watch it and he
[29:52] was like dad we shouldn't be watching
[29:54] that
[29:54] and uh he's like well brother brandon
[29:56] watch
[29:57] this marilyn monroe movie i can watch it
[29:59] it doesn't it doesn't affect me
[30:01] and the daughter said yes it did affect
[30:03] him
[30:04] he had less prayer he had less the
[30:06] preaching became condemnation on all the
[30:09] women
[30:10] that's what hurt that's what his
[30:11] daughter said now she might be biased
[30:12] but
[30:14] and it caused her to leave the message
[30:15] because her dad when he would preach
[30:17] would put all the blame on women it's
[30:18] all he's fall it's all but church you
[30:20] and i know if anyone's if anyone if any
[30:22] of us would have been there we all would
[30:23] know the same thing
[30:25] right and really eve can type the church
[30:27] right which would be all of us amen
[30:30] right we would all fall short of the
[30:32] glory of god
[30:34] but he became heavy-handed on that
[30:36] and then less time preaching pray
[30:39] more time watching gilligan's island and
[30:41] dirty you know movies
[30:45] so what he do he made a tradition out of
[30:48] a quote but it's a misinterpreted quote
[30:51] he interpreted the quote to give him the
[30:53] lust that he desired there it is right
[30:54] from the scripture peter said
[30:57] give them the lust that they want great
[30:59] swelling words
[31:01] right oh we're in the messenger we've
[31:02] got the greatest revelation all these
[31:03] things we got the greatest prophet yeah
[31:05] i can still enjoy my lusts on the side
[31:08] there's something wrong with that that's
[31:09] right and the holy spirit will pick that
[31:11] up praise god
[31:13] point it out is wrong
[31:15] okay so this is number nine now now the
[31:18] verses here are pretty plain i love this
[31:20] jesus said do you think that i accused
[31:22] you to the father he told the pharisees
[31:24] there's one that accuses you even moses
[31:26] whom you trust
[31:28] for how do you believe moses you would
[31:30] have believed me
[31:31] or he wrote to me
[31:32] but if you believe not his writings how
[31:34] should you believe my words
[31:36] so the point is jesus was saying you you
[31:38] won't receive the present word and you
[31:40] say you're following the prophet but
[31:42] that you're actually misinterpreting the
[31:43] prophet's word they added their own
[31:45] interpretation to moses's law called the
[31:48] mishnah they had their own books to
[31:50] understand god's book that was a sin
[31:52] that's right
[31:54] and jesus said
[31:56] i'm not going to condemn you your
[31:58] prophet that you're trusting is going to
[32:00] condemn you amen amen the very prophet
[32:02] they say they believe and follow brother
[32:05] moses he's going to accuse them well the
[32:06] same would be today right to
[32:08] misinterpret and add to brother message
[32:11] would be to have brother branham condemn
[32:14] because jesus christ is the same
[32:15] yesterday
[32:17] didn't jesus go down to hell and preach
[32:19] the noah's generation
[32:21] you should have listened to noah you
[32:22] should have listened to enoch you missed
[32:24] them they were preaching to me praise
[32:26] god i was that arcade man
[32:29] you missed it praise god
[32:32] missed it
[32:33] and no one will condemn them enoch will
[32:36] condemn them
[32:37] because it was christ in enoch christ
[32:40] and noah and the church said amen
[32:43] that's right and ultimately what we're
[32:46] going to look at these no matter what
[32:47] brother man watch we don't know all the
[32:48] details we can't assume things
[32:51] but ultimately the bible says i will set
[32:54] no wicked thing before mine eyes that's
[32:55] right that's right
[32:57] and the first thessalonians 5 i believe
[32:59] it is uh the bible said avoid all
[33:01] appearance of evil
[33:04] amen
[33:08] okay so here's the quote
[33:10] i'm sorry this is the quote about making
[33:12] a uh
[33:13] a tradition out of a prophet's life
[33:15] exactly what jesus said would come to
[33:16] the earth he said god sent them prophets
[33:18] down through the age every time their
[33:19] world system would fall apart their
[33:21] religious system said what you do with
[33:23] him god sent the prophet and you put him
[33:25] in a tomb exactly and then about another
[33:27] generation you wake up and realize that
[33:28] was the prophet and what would he do you
[33:30] garnish it to what you do make a
[33:32] tradition of his life
[33:36] that's exactly what israel had done had
[33:38] taken the prophet moses and made a
[33:40] tradition out of his life now church
[33:41] what they do
[33:42] they made a tradition
[33:44] out of the brass serpent
[33:46] church
[33:48] for a while they could look and live and
[33:51] they would actually get healed then
[33:54] but fast forward a few generations
[33:55] listen became a tradition well we'll
[33:57] just come to church and
[33:58] just hope god heals us
[34:00] and pretty soon they lost their faith
[34:02] and now it's just hope
[34:03] and now the wrath servant just becomes a
[34:05] thing they bow down in worship
[34:08] they worship the creation rather than
[34:11] the creator praise god
[34:14] they made a tradition out of moses's
[34:16] life that's why we can never let church
[34:18] become a tradition praise god there's
[34:20] got to be something real or speak to me
[34:22] tonight
[34:23] lord move tonight
[34:24] i need something from you tonight make
[34:26] this special tonight make every time we
[34:28] gather and hear the word and then we
[34:30] feel your presence through something
[34:31] special in our midst may we feel your
[34:33] holiness praise god
[34:37] let us not make a tradition out of
[34:39] brother adam's life
[34:40] i've done all i can do to try to stay
[34:42] from that praise god
[34:44] yeah i want to yeah i read his
[34:45] testimonies i got a book about his
[34:47] testimonies i highlight that i really
[34:49] love that
[34:50] beautiful
[34:51] but i can't make a tradition out of his
[34:53] life that's right
[34:56] now run around watch at least two movies
[34:59] the first was called a river runs
[35:01] through it that's a maryland maryland
[35:02] rogue movie and second was the ten
[35:04] commandments
[35:06] what's about moses
[35:08] now both movies are some immorally
[35:10] dressed women
[35:11] i remember when i first watched 10
[35:13] commandments i was like oh
[35:15] i think it was a pharaoh's wife or
[35:16] something like that
[35:18] his daughter pharaoh's daughter okay
[35:21] yeah
[35:22] elizabeth something
[35:24] yeah i forget that movie stars
[35:26] what's that you change it in the movie
[35:28] they made her cleopatra oh that's right
[35:30] clearly that's right
[35:31] that's right
[35:33] i mean i was fresh in the message right
[35:34] the brothers at the church up there and
[35:35] uh said oh yeah you can watch movies and
[35:38] i was like i'm gonna watch movies
[35:41] i just left the movies you want me to
[35:42] watch movies like okay i'll sit down and
[35:45] watch tech commanders with you i was
[35:46] like
[35:48] i was like ashamed of myself like what's
[35:49] going on here
[35:53] i haven't watched it since
[35:56] everybody's got different battles you
[35:57] know and so you just
[35:58] don't want to put yourself in a bad spot
[36:00] praise god
[36:02] and let me say this i will not be
[36:04] watching river runs through it
[36:06] this thing knows brother brandon all
[36:08] right i love brother brown he's got
[36:09] servant he's got jesus star but he's a
[36:11] man
[36:14] because i'm going to show you why
[36:16] now here's the quote program said i was
[36:18] in canada the other day my kids kept
[36:19] telling me over now look at look who
[36:21] calls and watch a movie
[36:23] these kids were not born again
[36:27] there was a lady had led us to the house
[36:29] had a television
[36:33] and they said there's going to be a play
[36:34] called the river no return this was in
[36:36] 1963. the movie came out in 1954. so
[36:40] nine years after the movie came out now
[36:41] they're showing it on a tv special
[36:43] they're gonna have a tv special with
[36:44] marilyn monroe she'd already died at
[36:46] this point
[36:50] and they said dad there's gonna be a
[36:51] play called the river of no return
[36:52] that's the river i fish on all the time
[36:54] so the man was familiar with that movie
[36:56] and don smith a friend of mine takes
[36:58] that tour and they said they made a
[36:59] movie up and said daddy maybe that mr
[37:01] smith is on the program would you like
[37:03] to look at that well i said when i come
[37:05] back from canada if i make it in time
[37:08] i'll look at it
[37:10] well when the play did come i went over
[37:12] to see it
[37:13] went to see it
[37:16] and when i did who was playing it but
[37:18] marilyn monroe
[37:20] now there she was after being dead a
[37:22] year or more there she was all
[37:24] so did brother graham see her sexy
[37:26] dressed yes mother graham saw enough on
[37:28] the movie
[37:30] or maybe heard about it that she was
[37:31] sexy dressed
[37:34] there was her voice upon still playing
[37:36] and will be for years and years upon the
[37:38] magnetic tape if that magnetic tape
[37:39] holds her action when if she could look
[37:42] from where she is tonight i trust she
[37:44] say but i don't know that's to god but
[37:46] if she can look back she cannot deny
[37:47] that she cannot deny this because we've
[37:49] got it how much more has god got every
[37:51] move every action upon his great supreme
[37:53] tape we cannot get out of it it's right
[37:56] there
[37:57] now let me uh
[37:59] show you what the movie's
[38:01] uh
[38:02] posters look like
[38:04] here's the american version
[38:06] now that's marilyn rose she's got a real
[38:08] short shirt on side to cover it here she
[38:10] has basically like a
[38:12] bikini i'm not sure what you call it
[38:17] that's the american version now
[38:19] brace yourself for this one i covered it
[38:21] up but just price yourself you're going
[38:22] to use your imagination
[38:23] here's the japanese version when this
[38:25] movie went to japan
[38:28] and she's basically got a bikini on it
[38:31] and she wore that in the movies i don't
[38:33] we don't know what brother man saw
[38:35] but he said he knew she was sexy dressed
[38:37] in the movie
[38:39] okay
[38:42] now before i get to this one
[38:47] see that's a sin of making his life your
[38:49] tradition
[38:51] well brother branham watch it i can too
[38:55] you gotta ask we gotta ask ourselves a
[38:56] lot of questions how much in the movie
[38:58] did brother brandon watch
[39:01] did the holy ghost have him turn his
[39:02] head and show him the vision of the sexy
[39:04] dress before he saw it
[39:08] how many times did brother van watch
[39:10] that
[39:10] did he watch a river run through it
[39:12] every single day like that preacher was
[39:14] watching gilligan's island every day
[39:18] no
[39:20] no okay all right start to see here
[39:23] starting to see how a doctrine of a
[39:24] devil can form up based upon the
[39:27] seducing spirits of devils
[39:31] praise god
[39:32] so you come to my house you're not going
[39:33] to see me
[39:35] watching gilligan's island
[39:38] i say like this we got to be careful
[39:39] what we do watch on our phones
[39:42] it don't mean anything it doesn't mean
[39:44] anything anymore to say well i don't
[39:45] have a tv that doesn't mean nothing
[39:47] that's right because we all got cell
[39:48] phones
[39:50] it doesn't make any more it doesn't
[39:51] surprise anybody anymore
[39:52] it used to
[39:54] but doesn't anymore praise god
[39:58] so we have to say is i don't do movies i
[40:00] don't do disney i don't do hbo i don't
[40:02] do any of that i just watch jesus films
[40:05] or amen or something like that or the
[40:07] news when i get a chance you know
[40:09] or good stuff on youtube or good stuff
[40:11] on some of you might be on facebook you
[40:13] can do facebook as long as you're holy
[40:14] with it you know
[40:15] it's whatever you make of it
[40:18] right
[40:19] but to make that
[40:21] that quote to make that a tradition and
[40:23] invite seducing spirits into your home
[40:26] which that hurts the church that's a
[40:28] doctrine from hell praise god
[40:31] ever see that by god's grace
[40:33] so be careful just because you think you
[40:35] understand what brother graham did
[40:37] let's pray and actually actually seek
[40:39] god so we clearly understand what he did
[40:43] we don't know if he went back and
[40:44] repented of the holy spirit we don't
[40:45] know
[40:46] because remember he went back and
[40:47] repented after he disobeyed the brown
[40:48] bear vision
[40:49] he told us about that but we don't know
[40:51] every time he went back to repent for
[40:53] every sin that he did he said i commit
[40:54] thousands of sins a year
[40:56] that's at least five or six sins a day
[40:59] all right
[41:00] so we don't know we don't know if he
[41:01] went back repentance say oh god or
[41:03] children we don't understand children
[41:04] cover your eyes oh man guys
[41:06] we don't know
[41:08] but see how satan will take this quote
[41:12] and then oh i've always i've kind of
[41:14] held back on movies but i think i will
[41:16] watch the
[41:18] movies while the world is going to hell
[41:21] you're going to watch another movie
[41:24] no way no way hmm not a worldly one
[41:28] you see my brother jim was preaching on
[41:29] different things i thought i gotta read
[41:31] you one more sermon on
[41:32] doctrine the devil so that's number
[41:33] seven so it work it would work out if
[41:35] this is the last one descendants
[41:37] completion i usually don't end on the
[41:38] good side
[41:39] uh
[41:40] can everybody understand that by god's
[41:41] grace
[41:43] simple example
[41:45] but a real example where it ruined the
[41:47] church it ruined the family and allowed
[41:49] a sister to leave the message
[41:51] because of this doctrine of the devil
[41:55] and then she was bashing me she said how
[41:57] come you don't have any uh videos out
[41:59] there about
[42:00] pornography and bashing that i said well
[42:02] i preach on almost every service all you
[42:04] gotta do is listen to my service
[42:06] she never did
[42:08] and i said well fine then i'll make one
[42:11] so i made one last month
[42:14] praise god amen i've been wanting to do
[42:16] it for years
[42:18] but i just gotta wait for god's
[42:19] leadership of the holy spirit
[42:21] but i've had numerous people say this
[42:23] was such a blessing just when i was
[42:24] struggling with the timing was perfect
[42:26] you know
[42:28] so you thank god i said you just gotta
[42:30] listen to one of my sermons i always
[42:32] preach right you some of you can
[42:33] probably repeat after me right i'll
[42:35] preach against pride i'll preach against
[42:36] lust i'll preach against money right you
[42:39] you you know the things i'm going to
[42:40] preach all right because i'm a pastor
[42:43] yeah i've got to hit on all of those
[42:44] things
[42:45] depression disease you know
[42:47] all these temptations anger bitterness
[42:50] depression
[42:52] every cyrus i'm going to ball that out
[42:54] praise god
[42:55] because i know we battle those all the
[42:57] time
[42:59] praise god
[43:01] so let's not make a tradition out of
[43:03] brother iran's life let's make an exam
[43:05] let's use his life as examples that
[43:07] point us back to the bible amen because
[43:09] sister alina there's quotes but awesome
[43:11] there's quotes brother brandon said
[43:12] don't you ever let that television come
[43:15] into your church i'm sorry come in come
[43:17] in your church
[43:18] come into your house
[43:20] he said if it was in my house he said
[43:21] i'd blow it up with a shotgun
[43:24] you see what do you do here in this case
[43:26] he's like well i always fish at that i
[43:28] love that river it's beautiful i forget
[43:30] what state it's in probably wyoming or
[43:32] something i don't know
[43:35] so he kind of got
[43:36] pulled into that because of his his love
[43:38] for nature and then what so you can see
[43:40] how the devil works you you have a good
[43:42] oh i want to watch this it's probably a
[43:44] good thing and then say go slip in a
[43:45] sexy dress with man or woman on there
[43:49] just like the demo
[43:51] just like that one
[43:53] we don't know
[43:55] all the details about the situation
[43:57] so we cannot make it's what to me it's a
[43:59] good learning lesson be careful what you
[44:01] watch coming out of hollywood right
[44:04] praise god i don't care i think you ever
[44:06] talk to my brother be careful
[44:09] because that's just what satan wants
[44:11] right it's just like rat poison right
[44:13] it's going to have some good in it it's
[44:15] got to have some poison in it praise god
[44:17] recognize where it's coming from if it's
[44:19] coming from marilyn monroe praise god it
[44:21] was coming from beyonce or some of these
[44:23] modern sex queens i don't even know
[44:24] they're shakibra i don't know their
[44:25] names anymore you know jennifer lopez
[44:27] was one that was popular when i was out
[44:29] there
[44:30] britney spears
[44:31] those ones are popular if it has
[44:33] anything to do with that it's probably
[44:34] rat poison amen
[44:37] stay away from it praise god
[44:42] so does everybody agree that's a
[44:44] doctrine of a devil
[44:47] well brother branham did this so i know
[44:50] it's off the word but i can do it i can
[44:52] i can handle it too
[44:54] anytime somebody says they can handle a
[44:55] sin is probably a sin
[44:58] it's probably a tell if they're in a sin
[45:00] you can't handle sin
[45:02] the bible says you must have unleavened
[45:04] bread all right the bible says you must
[45:06] serve god in sincerity unleavened bread
[45:08] of sincerity and truth praise god
[45:11] you can't handle sin sin is going to
[45:13] overtake your life
[45:15] praise god you can't pet and baby a city
[45:18] you've got to get it out of your life
[45:20] right how do you believe that
[45:22] amen
[45:24] all right i did a 45 minute timer so i
[45:25] got six minutes left here so
[45:28] all right honey now you just waved that
[45:29] big white flag back there when i get to
[45:31] my 45 minutes okay so
[45:33] you know i have a reminder on my phone
[45:35] it says preach 35 to 45 minutes with
[45:38] someone to help you
[45:40] how many times do i do that
[45:43] i have a good desire lydia but the
[45:45] strength to do that desire i just can't
[45:47] find it
[45:48] sound like paul
[45:51] now let's do a little bit more on this
[45:53] because sometimes the holy spirit's here
[45:54] right you know like last week beautiful
[45:56] that was so awesome
[45:58] last week remember at the end this we
[45:59] were singing and such a beautiful
[46:01] anointing fell
[46:02] and then my daughters didn't battle that
[46:04] spirit all week oh yeah i'll tell you an
[46:05] update on that and then the girl got to
[46:07] come back
[46:08] and instead of talking about horror
[46:09] shows haven got to play her the song
[46:12] that the lord gave her and about the
[46:15] rapture the groom is coming
[46:18] he's coming to catch him
[46:22] it was so beautiful i'm like
[46:23] yeah working the last word amen
[46:26] i didn't hear you praise god this meant
[46:28] so much to me praise god amen
[46:32] no more talk about
[46:33] horror
[46:35] talk about the rapture amen amen
[46:38] so there's a great sin in presuming and
[46:41] exalting brother branham and this age
[46:43] above all christians
[46:47] what would it take somebody to say i'm
[46:48] the greatest christian there ever was
[46:50] what would it take somebody to say that
[46:53] let alone let alone this i'm the
[46:54] greatest mother there ever was what
[46:56] would it well the moment it takes
[46:58] somebody to say and today
[46:59] i'm you're the greatest grandfather
[47:01] there ever was what would it take for
[47:03] you to say that it would take a lot of
[47:05] pride
[47:07] even for me i'm the greatest father
[47:09] there ever was
[47:12] that's why i love you right there
[47:14] i'm the greatest preacher sister who
[47:15] there ever was
[47:18] yeah good one brother
[47:21] that's exactly right that's how we
[47:22] should act right but preachers are
[47:25] literally saying this
[47:29] what would have to come over somebody
[47:31] would that be the holy spirit
[47:40] they're still saying it i got video from
[47:42] last or two months ago by the way from
[47:44] the end of may i might show it to you
[47:46] guys tonight if i
[47:48] have time
[47:50] because really that's not me preaching
[47:51] so it doesn't count as my fourth house
[47:59] but think about that what would it take
[48:03] to come over you to say i'm the greatest
[48:07] speaker in tongues there ever was
[48:12] i'm the greatest miracle worker there
[48:14] ever was
[48:15] that's basically what they're saying
[48:19] and do they have any bible authority the
[48:21] answer is no
[48:24] because jesus christ said there it is
[48:26] not mine to give who sits on the right
[48:28] hand the left the greatest ones brother
[48:30] william would be the ones who are on the
[48:31] right hand and left is that
[48:33] you're right next to jesus now we don't
[48:36] like to be there but let's be honest
[48:37] we're not going to be there
[48:39] jesus already gave us a clue in the
[48:40] bible who's going to be there the 24
[48:42] elders
[48:42] [Music]
[48:43] and then we know there's also a certain
[48:45] order too where the 12 apostles are
[48:47] going to rule over the 12 tribes of
[48:49] israel so now we know now there's even a
[48:50] better hierarchy he's probably got six
[48:52] apostles on this side six on that side
[48:54] and he's got the
[48:56] six israel on that side and six sons of
[48:57] israel on that side
[49:02] because they are going to judge the
[49:03] apostles are going to judge
[49:05] the tribes of israel
[49:07] judge
[49:08] this is right this is wrong that's right
[49:10] do this don't do that
[49:13] well how many people like to be told
[49:14] what to do how many people like that
[49:18] not many people have to be told to do
[49:19] right
[49:24] now i don't remember what secretary's 10
[49:26] 12 says so let me look it up here thank
[49:28] you
[49:28] thanks just be patient with me here
[49:31] 10 corinthians 10 12.
[49:33] i got that one memorized
[49:37] oh
[49:38] wherefore let him think of he standeth
[49:40] take he lest he fall
[49:42] okay so these these preachers are
[49:44] uh they're exalting themselves so high
[49:47] but the bible says you better watch
[49:49] yourself or else you're gonna fall
[49:55] now here where did this idea come from
[49:57] i'm going to give you my best guess i
[49:59] don't know i'm presuming on this but let
[50:00] me give you my best guess i believe it
[50:02] comes from revelation 10 1-7
[50:04] because we have thus saith the lord
[50:07] revelations on the seven seals that were
[50:09] not revealed in any other age think
[50:11] about that do you think about that by
[50:12] the way paul never knew there was even
[50:13] seven seals
[50:15] because it was revealed to john about
[50:17] 100 a.d paul died in 64 80 if i'm not
[50:19] mistaken
[50:21] 40 you know i'm sorry 30 36 years
[50:25] earlier he never knew there were seven
[50:26] seals
[50:31] so preachers will say well we have more
[50:33] revelation so we must be greater
[50:37] because revelation is power
[50:39] revelation is faith we must have more
[50:41] faith
[50:43] okay well then like i said go walk on
[50:45] water first
[50:46] if you're gonna do greater works in
[50:48] jesus walk on water first then spit in
[50:50] mud put in somebody's eyes and then come
[50:52] show me their eyes
[50:53] and then tell them what color eyes are
[50:54] going to have before you put the mud
[50:58] okay
[50:59] start with that
[51:01] then i'll start believing how great you
[51:02] are
[51:03] right
[51:04] but i know there's nobody in these great
[51:05] jesus so i don't have to read them at
[51:06] all no question for me
[51:08] so see church now our revelation i will
[51:11] admit this our revelation is greater in
[51:13] the quantity
[51:14] but not the quality
[51:17] for the holy ghost revelation given to
[51:19] paul caused him to labor more than all
[51:22] the other apostles praise god
[51:24] his missionary work in miracles they've
[51:26] been rarely matched by anyone
[51:29] his dedication his sacrifice his
[51:31] devotion to jesus has rarely yet ever
[51:34] ever been matched
[51:38] i know message preachers have been put
[51:39] in jail but i know very few message
[51:41] preachers that were shipwrecked three
[51:44] times or beaten three times with 39
[51:47] whips
[51:48] i don't know any message preacher that's
[51:50] done that
[51:51] there could be
[51:52] and if that's the case then they'd be
[51:53] highly exhausted amen but that's up to
[51:55] jesus
[51:57] but certainly not these ones that their
[51:59] heart of struggle in life
[52:02] is i don't know what struggle they have
[52:04] in life actually
[52:06] if they're millionaires
[52:07] i'm not sure what struggle they actually
[52:08] have in life
[52:10] where's my 45 minutes
[52:17] and remember paul's gospel is the
[52:19] judgment standard of all men including
[52:22] brother branagh
[52:24] and even brother branham
[52:26] can't
[52:27] even the angel that business brother
[52:29] can't add one word or take one word away
[52:31] from paul's gospel amen
[52:33] [Applause]
[52:38] so to me i feel like it was a small jump
[52:40] for those preachers to say well since we
[52:42] have the greatest amount of revelation
[52:44] we live higher than other ages because
[52:46] the gates of hell can't prevail against
[52:47] revelation so we must be greater than
[52:49] all the other ages
[52:52] sorry your reasoning is quite far
[52:55] you've jumped too many uh
[52:57] jumped too many rocks
[53:00] we can't find this in the bible it's
[53:02] certainly not all the tapes
[53:05] now
[53:06] they're making five declarations
[53:08] that are prideful now i'm gonna lord
[53:10] willingly record this video tomorrow or
[53:12] friday if i can
[53:13] get here to study by god's grace
[53:17] i'm making five prideful
[53:19] uh declarations here
[53:23] just bear with me
[53:28] i don't have to leave this screen but i
[53:29] might have to here
[53:31] okay the first one is of course they're
[53:33] the greatest preachers of all time
[53:35] i like to read the exact quote so you
[53:37] can see it here
[53:42] okay this is not updated so i have to go
[53:46] out of here
[53:48] when you need tech sometimes it fails
[53:52] okay here's the five uh
[53:54] yeah don't try to read that it might
[53:56] hurt you
[53:58] um
[54:01] yeah let me just thumbs up for a few
[54:02] minutes
[54:03] okay so the first thing is uh their
[54:06] profit this is their first prideful
[54:07] statement their profit brother branham
[54:10] preachers young people and mothers are
[54:12] all the greatest of all time
[54:14] i have i have the video but i showed it
[54:16] to the church i'll probably show it
[54:17] again maybe sunday i might preach one
[54:19] more on this
[54:20] uh joseph branham said that he said
[54:22] brother brahm is the greatest prophet of
[54:23] all time and he never said except for
[54:25] jesus he never said that
[54:28] so now brother branham is greater than
[54:31] jesus because he never said except for
[54:32] jesus
[54:34] and then he says we have the greatest
[54:36] prophet preaching to the greatest people
[54:38] of all time i got the i got the
[54:39] screenshots
[54:42] and then a message preacher and then
[54:44] well don't forget brother said don't you
[54:45] never do that there's no great ones
[54:47] among us there's only one great one and
[54:49] that's god
[54:52] a preacher from north carolina said i'm
[54:53] not ashamed to say this this message has
[54:55] produced the greatest preacher that's
[54:57] ever seen the pulpit and preached the
[54:58] word he didn't say outside of jesus
[55:00] either
[55:01] he said it's produced the greatest
[55:03] mothers come on church this message is
[55:04] jesus christ well now he's just made
[55:07] message preachers and moms equal to
[55:08] jesus christ we are not equal to jesus
[55:10] christ
[55:12] we are not equal
[55:14] no no we are not equal
[55:18] he never sinned we sin every day
[55:21] anyone with half a
[55:23] conscience would not say that
[55:25] we can't be equal to christ
[55:29] we are sinners saved by grace but i said
[55:31] remember i'm not jesus christ i'm your
[55:32] brother sinner saved by grace i like you
[55:34] all right
[55:36] hallelujah
[55:37] now let me say this if the mothers are
[55:39] greater
[55:40] than ever then they're greater than
[55:42] susannah wesley who brother ben really
[55:44] propped up high
[55:47] he said she prayed what two or three
[55:49] hours a day with all those kids and she
[55:51] may have but she did have a nurse she
[55:53] did have
[55:54] a midwife no
[55:56] she had a servant i looked it up one
[55:57] time
[55:58] she had cooks and housekeepers oh yeah
[56:00] that's what i mean i'm sorry yeah that's
[56:01] fine she had helpers at the house
[56:06] so which message mom prays more than
[56:08] three hours a day
[56:09] and has more children than susanna
[56:11] wesley
[56:12] somebody showed me
[56:16] then i'll leave you
[56:18] remember church in first corinthians 3
[56:20] the bible says
[56:23] i am planted apollos water but god gave
[56:25] the increase
[56:26] so that neither is he that planteth
[56:28] anything
[56:30] so us preachers are nothing
[56:33] that's right neither he that water
[56:35] but god that giveth the increase now he
[56:38] that planteth and he that water are one
[56:40] right
[56:41] and every man shall receive his own
[56:43] reward we are laborers together with god
[56:46] we are god's husbandry we are god's
[56:48] building praise god amen
[56:51] so all preachers are one but all
[56:52] preachers cannot give an increase we
[56:55] cannot give you the holy spirit we
[56:57] cannot give you anything only jesus
[56:59] makes you groan praise god
[57:01] i can water you i can plant you i can do
[57:03] all those things but jesus is the life
[57:05] praise god jesus is the life jesus will
[57:08] make you grow jesus will bring forth
[57:10] great fruits in your life
[57:15] a preacher from virginia was talking
[57:17] about another preacher he said uh god
[57:20] you raised this boy up to be one of the
[57:21] greatest men to ever preach in the whole
[57:23] world
[57:24] american preacher
[57:26] now how can they correct brother branham
[57:28] because in the church age book brother
[57:29] william chapter 8 you know this one
[57:31] brother brown said the preaching of the
[57:33] word was never greater
[57:35] in the philadelphia church age
[57:38] oh okay so
[57:40] i thought we're supposed to say what the
[57:41] tape say
[57:43] i i thought you can't correct brother
[57:45] brandon
[57:46] preachers today are correcting the
[57:48] church age book that's what i'm saying
[57:52] brother branham said god raised up
[57:54] mighty wars of faith the greatest works
[57:56] of christian literature and teaching and
[57:58] preaching came from this era
[58:00] never has its preachers and teachers
[58:02] been matched and never will they be and
[58:05] the church
[58:07] that's said
[58:07] quote from brother branham and yet
[58:09] preachers they are correcting brother
[58:11] branham and they say they just say what
[58:13] the tapes say
[58:15] insanity praise god insane great
[58:17] swelling words ability oh we're the
[58:19] greatest greatest moms greatest young
[58:21] people i can't believe they said the
[58:22] greatest young people either i just
[58:23] can't believe that
[58:25] can't believe that
[58:29] how can they correct brother brandon
[58:31] they're the very ones i have videos of
[58:33] the same people by the way saying you
[58:34] can't correct the prophet and yet
[58:36] they're correcting the prophet
[58:39] now that's why i sometimes go crazy am i
[58:41] crazy or are they crazy who's crazy here
[58:45] because they're the ones god
[58:46] we get 18 views on a sunday morning
[58:49] service
[58:50] they get six hundred or a thousand
[58:52] sometimes two thousand
[58:54] so if you just look at the natural
[58:56] brother william
[58:57] they
[58:58] they are
[58:59] a hundred times greater than we are
[59:02] and so i think well am i insane
[59:04] because everybody agrees with them and
[59:06] they watch them and nobody watches ours
[59:08] nobody likes our sermons very few
[59:11] but you know what i got to do i got to
[59:12] talk to jesus
[59:14] and then i got to talk to the holy
[59:15] spirit which is the one the same and
[59:17] what does the holy spirit do but that
[59:18] says the holy ghost will always point
[59:20] you back to the word
[59:21] so let them call it let me let them call
[59:23] me crazy
[59:24] i'm happier this way praise god i'm
[59:26] happier not saying i'm greater than
[59:28] brother than any brother paul
[59:30] i'm happy saying i'm not greater than
[59:32] brother peter i'm nothing i just plant
[59:34] in water i'm nothing it's god he's the
[59:36] great one he's the one that gives your
[59:38] life increase
[59:40] hey man you see how you does everybody
[59:42] see how i could go crazy
[59:45] these are the preachers these ones
[59:46] everybody looks to great meetings great
[59:48] they have amazing miracles
[59:51] but they're saying we are the greatest
[59:53] christians of all time
[59:55] joseph branham had a person die in his
[59:57] congregation during the service and they
[59:59] prayed for him and he came back to life
[1:00:01] and he's the one saying
[1:00:03] brother graham is the greatest preacher
[1:00:05] prophet of all time
[1:00:08] everyone hear me
[1:00:10] does the bible say
[1:00:12] will have signs wonders in america don't
[1:00:13] the bible say that all right
[1:00:16] and i love that quote i just found that
[1:00:17] quote again i found it the first
[1:00:18] brotherhood said don't you never judge
[1:00:19] your life by how many signs and wonders
[1:00:21] and miracles
[1:00:22] he said judge your life presently by the
[1:00:24] fruit that you're producing
[1:00:28] said thank you jesus i sure needed that
[1:00:29] one
[1:00:30] sometimes i almost go crazy listen to my
[1:00:32] favorite preachers on there
[1:00:34] not so much my favorite anymore but
[1:00:40] another preacher from tennessee said
[1:00:42] the devils are coming against the
[1:00:43] greatest generation of young people the
[1:00:45] world has ever seen on the face of the
[1:00:46] earth
[1:00:47] and he said our credential is is we met
[1:00:49] the lord jesus ourself now look what he
[1:00:51] says
[1:00:52] young people message are greater than
[1:00:54] anyone because we've met jesus ourself
[1:00:56] well didn't
[1:00:57] james and john meet jesus face to face
[1:01:00] themselves
[1:01:01] church they were teenagers when they
[1:01:03] dropped their father's nets and they
[1:01:05] left their father's nets for jesus
[1:01:09] oh but we're greater than them
[1:01:12] i'm going to show you a visual in a
[1:01:13] moment here
[1:01:15] i'll have to get to a little bit
[1:01:17] didn't they see jesus face to face yeah
[1:01:19] they did
[1:01:21] see how there's no there's no scripture
[1:01:22] for this
[1:01:24] oh we've seen jesus we've met jesus face
[1:01:26] to face so we're the greatest young
[1:01:27] people of all time
[1:01:29] you haven't met him face to face
[1:01:31] praise god if you've got the baptism of
[1:01:32] the holy ghost but how can you be
[1:01:34] greater than the ones that he chose
[1:01:37] the 12.
[1:01:38] of course judas being replaced by
[1:01:40] matthias
[1:01:41] ultimately probably paul
[1:01:47] now some of these
[1:01:49] i'm going to just get past
[1:01:51] okay
[1:01:54] they and they also call each other
[1:01:56] generals brother william they say we're
[1:01:58] generals
[1:01:59] and they call their wives queens of the
[1:02:01] entire state like the queen of arkansas
[1:02:03] the queen of
[1:02:04] louisiana
[1:02:07] now that's taking a pastor's wife and
[1:02:08] just putting her up on a pedestal now
[1:02:10] how do they know she's greater than all
[1:02:11] these other sisters how do they know
[1:02:14] oh it's because it's my wife that's why
[1:02:15] she's great
[1:02:18] i got the videos brother
[1:02:27] okay so i'm gonna try to move on because
[1:02:29] some of this is this review for most of
[1:02:31] us here
[1:02:32] and then i'll read this one more so two
[1:02:34] months ago the brother said tomorrow
[1:02:35] morning you're gonna have one of the
[1:02:36] greatest preachers that ever lived in
[1:02:37] history preached to you now think about
[1:02:39] that
[1:02:41] you've got john wesley jonathan edwards
[1:02:44] martin luther polycarp iranian you you
[1:02:47] have the church age messengers
[1:02:49] yeah now remember this guy said that one
[1:02:51] of the grace in history but at his
[1:02:52] church he's the one that left that north
[1:02:54] carolina preacher say we have the
[1:02:55] greatest preachers ever
[1:02:57] and he stood there i got the video he
[1:02:58] stood there and said amen hallelujah
[1:03:01] they're greater they think they're
[1:03:02] greater than even the church age
[1:03:03] messengers
[1:03:05] that's what they say
[1:03:07] they said that
[1:03:08] ever the greatest ever to stand behind
[1:03:10] the pulpit ever
[1:03:12] history of the world
[1:03:15] you're not even in one of the seven
[1:03:16] you're not you're not in the 12 you're
[1:03:18] not the 24 you're not in the seven how
[1:03:20] can you be greater than 24 7 amen you
[1:03:23] can't be
[1:03:24] but that's what they allow and church
[1:03:26] the people clap
[1:03:27] and they get anointings they get
[1:03:28] miracles see the rain falls and the just
[1:03:31] and the angels but let the rain of
[1:03:33] humility fall on us too praise god
[1:03:35] i'm grateful when god does miracles i'm
[1:03:37] grateful for that but i'd rather have
[1:03:38] the spirit of truth praise god amen
[1:03:41] than compromise on god's word right
[1:03:46] if you actually listen to what they say
[1:03:47] so fast move on machine gun preachers
[1:03:50] but if you actually slow it down listen
[1:03:51] to it they're actually saying they're
[1:03:52] the greatest preachers ever
[1:03:56] and their wives are the queens
[1:03:58] i've heard two message preachers say i
[1:04:01] say right right right one's over the
[1:04:02] internet one one was right in the
[1:04:03] service the preacher from new york said
[1:04:05] we have the greatest musicians in the
[1:04:07] entire message
[1:04:10] and that's because he had four daughters
[1:04:12] in the in the band
[1:04:14] now it's easy to say that when you have
[1:04:16] four daughters in the band
[1:04:19] hey we got the greatest musicians in the
[1:04:20] message right
[1:04:21] here got me on the back
[1:04:24] great job dad
[1:04:25] yeah we're the greatest ever
[1:04:28] and two months ago at that same meeting
[1:04:29] where they were exalting themselves the
[1:04:31] preacher the pastor of the canada church
[1:04:33] said we have the greatest musicians in
[1:04:35] the message what is it about why does
[1:04:37] everybody got to feel like they're the
[1:04:38] greatest right
[1:04:41] why can't anybody ever say we're the
[1:04:42] humblest
[1:04:43] [Music]
[1:04:45] you ever hear them say that
[1:04:48] you know why because it's the spirit of
[1:04:49] satan he wants to be exalted as the
[1:04:51] greatest
[1:04:54] you believe this christians who are they
[1:04:56] are bought by the blood of jesus christ
[1:04:58] arguing a goat debate about who's the
[1:05:00] greatest who's the greatest of all time
[1:05:02] who's to go among us
[1:05:05] there's no great ones among us i just
[1:05:07] will you just read the scripture
[1:05:09] don't you never do that
[1:05:14] okay hook me back up here i'm going to
[1:05:16] try to bring this down to close here
[1:05:18] let's see i tried to do 45 minutes
[1:05:20] impossible i couldn't do it i couldn't
[1:05:22] do it tonight
[1:05:25] that's okay i don't gotta work tomorrow
[1:05:26] so he's gone
[1:05:27] i don't want to be sensitive to those
[1:05:29] that you have to work tonight
[1:05:31] i'm just happy i don't have one summer
[1:05:32] break okay
[1:05:33] i'm not making myself great
[1:05:36] i'm just bad i don't have to work
[1:05:37] tomorrow
[1:05:38] now brother william this thought came to
[1:05:39] me like it felt like it dropped down
[1:05:41] from heaven today
[1:05:42] brother ram said jesus never commended
[1:05:45] our church age did you know that get
[1:05:46] your bible out revelation chapter two
[1:05:48] get your bible let's see it i'm gonna
[1:05:49] prove it to you
[1:05:51] roman said it here's the quote why are
[1:05:52] you turning revelation 2
[1:05:54] program is preaching the laosean church
[1:05:56] age now the next verse would be that
[1:05:57] other churches commending but he didn't
[1:06:00] commend this lamacian church jesus did
[1:06:02] not compliment this church oh my
[1:06:04] goodness
[1:06:05] and that's all they want to do is
[1:06:06] compliment each other
[1:06:09] he had a complaint against it not a
[1:06:12] command
[1:06:13] he didn't commend this for nothing this
[1:06:14] later seeing age with all the light
[1:06:16] there is right there by the way there is
[1:06:18] all the light that they have we have
[1:06:20] more light
[1:06:21] we have more revelation the little folks
[1:06:23] been open all seven seals have been
[1:06:25] loose praise god with all the light they
[1:06:27] had they went back on it they didn't
[1:06:29] need any commending
[1:06:31] aha they needed a
[1:06:33] rebuke
[1:06:36] and they got it he had a complaint for
[1:06:39] his church
[1:06:41] not a command
[1:06:44] remember jesus talking to both the true
[1:06:46] vine and the false mind
[1:06:49] when he's talking to church ages he's
[1:06:51] trying to get the false fine to repent
[1:06:52] but if there's good when there's good in
[1:06:54] the church age he'll say it
[1:06:55] but the reason you don't say to our age
[1:06:57] is because there's so
[1:06:58] few remember evil seducers waxed worse
[1:07:01] and worse false teaching is going to get
[1:07:04] worse and worse
[1:07:05] you got a migraine brother
[1:07:07] okay
[1:07:08] yes after church let's get some food
[1:07:11] unless you feel some powerful anointing
[1:07:12] okay
[1:07:14] god sees your sacrifice brother i
[1:07:16] appreciate your sacrifice
[1:07:23] he's talking to both fans
[1:07:26] but there's so few believers in this day
[1:07:28] that are actually hot and on fire
[1:07:30] that jesus doesn't even take time to to
[1:07:32] commend them because it's so small
[1:07:34] it's so small
[1:07:37] which is true because if the biggest
[1:07:39] preachers are exalting themselves with
[1:07:40] pride
[1:07:42] they're the ones who influence the most
[1:07:44] of the message of believers
[1:07:46] and everybody's going along with that
[1:07:47] we're the greatest and you're the no
[1:07:48] you're the good no you're the no no you
[1:07:50] are the great your wife's the greatest
[1:07:53] you're two are the greatest of all time
[1:07:57] all the time in history they said
[1:08:00] ever
[1:08:06] so jesus says there's so few saved
[1:08:10] they need to rebuke
[1:08:11] not commend they don't need a compliment
[1:08:14] like oh lydia i like your dress today
[1:08:16] okay that's a sharp looking match i like
[1:08:17] your color matching there no no
[1:08:19] compliments from jesus to this age
[1:08:22] none
[1:08:24] okay so yeah let's go revelation 2.
[1:08:28] how many do i got here i really want to
[1:08:29] finish this i thought i would really
[1:08:31] finish this tonight
[1:08:32] okay i got about 10 more slots okay
[1:08:36] well we don't have to do it we don't do
[1:08:37] this maybe i'll preach this on sunday
[1:08:38] but just so you know here's the verses
[1:08:40] jesus compliments ephesus smyrna
[1:08:42] pergamos dietrich sardis the the
[1:08:45] greatest compliments he gives is to
[1:08:47] philadelphia
[1:08:48] i mean he's just like boom and that
[1:08:50] makes sense that's why brother and said
[1:08:52] the greatest preachers came out of
[1:08:53] philadelphia
[1:08:54] it makes sense right yeah
[1:08:57] he's just like totally confident
[1:08:59] like yeah you come out of reformation
[1:09:00] and i got the open door uh you kept the
[1:09:03] faith and you have you have my name and
[1:09:05] my patience i mean he's just over and
[1:09:07] over complimenting the man age
[1:09:11] that's the west of the age
[1:09:14] and today's preachers say wesleyan age
[1:09:16] wasn't a good age
[1:09:18] because they only had sanctification no
[1:09:20] they had them back to the northern
[1:09:21] ghosts
[1:09:22] they were in type a type of segregation
[1:09:24] but they had the baptism holy ghost
[1:09:28] so if jesus did not compliment this age
[1:09:30] why are preachers complimenting
[1:09:31] themselves in this
[1:09:32] age is that a fair question
[1:09:39] all right let me i'm just going to close
[1:09:40] i'm going to skip ahead
[1:09:42] again the 12 apostles seem to be the
[1:09:43] greatest christians
[1:09:45] church here's how the greatest
[1:09:46] christians we know right now this is how
[1:09:48] they ended their lives
[1:09:50] now let's compare with some of the
[1:09:51] message preachers today
[1:09:56] saint andrew was crucified
[1:09:58] remember these are the ones jesus said
[1:10:00] you will sit right next he said you're
[1:10:01] gonna well the bible says in revelation
[1:10:03] four verse four they sit on twelve
[1:10:05] or twenty four thrones
[1:10:07] these are the ones jesus puts around the
[1:10:09] throne
[1:10:12] crucified andrew
[1:10:13] they beat bartholomew then they
[1:10:15] crucified him
[1:10:17] james son of alphaeus they stoned him to
[1:10:20] death
[1:10:21] like stephen
[1:10:22] james and son of zebedee they beheaded
[1:10:24] that's john's brother john's brother
[1:10:28] the one who left his father's nets the
[1:10:30] the sons of thunder they cut off his
[1:10:32] head
[1:10:34] john was the only one
[1:10:37] who was not brutally killed
[1:10:39] he just died of old age
[1:10:43] judas is scared was stoned to death the
[1:10:45] good judas was stoned to death matthew
[1:10:47] was speared to death remember i showed
[1:10:49] you the spears on sunday remember last
[1:10:50] wednesday the spirit they speared them
[1:10:52] to death
[1:10:53] peter crucified upside down he said i'm
[1:10:55] not worthy to be crucified like my lord
[1:10:57] not who's the great ones among us
[1:11:00] philip crucified simon crucified thomas
[1:11:03] speared to death
[1:11:05] now look matthias
[1:11:07] he was a great man of god
[1:11:10] i think he took the gospel to india if
[1:11:11] i'm not no that was uh thomas that was
[1:11:13] thomas i forgot what matthias did but
[1:11:15] fox the book of martyrs said matthias
[1:11:17] was stoned to death
[1:11:21] now along with saint paul these are the
[1:11:23] greatest christians
[1:11:24] according to the bible
[1:11:26] because jesus said you will judge all
[1:11:28] israel
[1:11:31] he said and you will sit next to me on
[1:11:33] the thrones in heaven
[1:11:36] now compare message preachers day some
[1:11:38] of them one the two the two i've heard
[1:11:40] of one made 250 000 a year
[1:11:43] in ties
[1:11:44] a quarter million a year
[1:11:46] and then the church would pay for all of
[1:11:48] his trips overseas i mean so he pocketed
[1:11:50] all that quarter million all those years
[1:11:52] i mean 40 50 years
[1:11:57] brand new clothes all the time new suits
[1:12:00] flying in planes brother
[1:12:03] i mean you have a couple times they put
[1:12:04] their lives on the line but is that the
[1:12:06] same type of sacrifice and dedication as
[1:12:08] these
[1:12:10] i don't think so
[1:12:13] and we have a bible to back it up that
[1:12:14] the bible
[1:12:16] says they have the thrones next to jesus
[1:12:23] think about that
[1:12:26] think about that who's the great ones
[1:12:28] among us
[1:12:34] now how did these the greatest
[1:12:35] christians ever how did they act when
[1:12:37] they received the holy ghost
[1:12:41] they bought more possessions and goods
[1:12:43] and kept it all to themselves
[1:12:46] no when they got the holy ghost they
[1:12:47] sold what they had
[1:12:49] to make sure everybody had what they
[1:12:51] needed
[1:12:52] hallelujah
[1:12:55] what else did they do
[1:12:57] when any of them lacked
[1:12:59] they sold houses lands and brought
[1:13:01] prices of things that were sold they
[1:13:03] laid them at the apostles feet and the
[1:13:04] apostles didn't keep them they
[1:13:06] distributed to the people that had amen
[1:13:10] that's how the real holy ghost acts
[1:13:13] and we've got thus state the bible for
[1:13:14] that
[1:13:15] when paul met james cephas and john yeah
[1:13:18] the ones who are going to be crucified
[1:13:19] upside down what's the last thing they
[1:13:21] said they said the only thing they would
[1:13:23] remember is that we would remember the
[1:13:25] poor
[1:13:26] poor
[1:13:28] so the greatest men the last words they
[1:13:30] would say before they would leave they
[1:13:31] said god bless you brother paul don't
[1:13:33] forget the poor
[1:13:37] that was that was the main thing on
[1:13:38] their mind who can we help how can we
[1:13:40] help the poor
[1:13:41] that's what the holy ghost does amen
[1:13:44] that's how the holy ghost makes you act
[1:13:46] then he's the same yesterday it'll make
[1:13:48] you act the same today it'll make you
[1:13:49] act the same forever praise god
[1:13:52] that's why that's why we pour our help
[1:13:53] to our saints that need it we pour out
[1:13:54] help to it
[1:13:55] i'm glad people poured out a lot of help
[1:13:57] to me too
[1:13:59] since i was a child they bought a church
[1:14:00] that poured out help helped to me and my
[1:14:02] family by god's kids
[1:14:05] and peter said silver and gold have i
[1:14:07] lots no
[1:14:08] silver and gold have i met
[1:14:15] he was talking about these he said
[1:14:17] billionaire preachers i said how
[1:14:19] different are you you're always bragging
[1:14:21] about what you got and how much you
[1:14:22] accumulated in this much time i said how
[1:14:24] different is from those original
[1:14:25] pentecost they sold everything they had
[1:14:28] to give to the poor i said you're
[1:14:30] opposite of that you're vice versa
[1:14:35] there's my notes let's stand our feet
[1:14:36] musicians can come
