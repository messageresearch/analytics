[36:09] and goats what will you do under the
[36:10] blood of jesus christ
[36:12] oh god so we thank you lord for your
[36:13] amazing grace lord god
[36:15] lord imagine you won't send a chariot
[36:17] you'll just come yourself lord god and
[36:19] you'll meet us in the air
[36:20] as the scripture says hallelujah it
[36:23] won't be a messenger it will be
[36:25] the one that the messenger is pointing
[36:27] to
[36:28] the god of heaven jesus christ
[36:30] hallelujah lord we're preparing
[36:32] we're making ready tonight lord god for
[36:34] that moment
[36:35] we're making ourselves ready the bride
[36:37] does that
[36:38] and father we come here to be washed by
[36:40] your word we come here lord
[36:41] to make you our head our ruler our
[36:44] decision maker so father we yield to you
[36:47] tonight
[36:47] bless us now in jesus christ's name and
[36:50] the church said
[36:51] amen god bless you being seated praise
[36:53] god
[36:56] lord willing i made a little a reminder
[36:58] on my phone
[36:59] um for some this sunday night we'll have
[37:02] a little bible study with the kids
[37:04] and i'll have the girls we'll have to
[37:07] adjust that camera so it doesn't get the
[37:09] kids
[37:10] on sunday night so just i'm just letting
[37:12] you know to remind me and remind you so
[37:14] um and so both johnny and i were talking
[37:17] he was saying well brother jesse i like
[37:18] i want my children to know
[37:20] answers to questions like why do women
[37:22] have long hair
[37:23] why don't brothers wear shorts uh why
[37:26] don't women preach you know just
[37:27] questions like that uh and we so i
[37:30] thought that's a good idea
[37:31] we can train up the little kids you know
[37:33] and they can hear it and
[37:35] have a good bible-based answer so i
[37:37] thought that was good
[37:38] but johnny said he's been to churches
[37:39] where you know they asked the he asked
[37:41] the teenagers you know
[37:42] uh why do why do why do we believe this
[37:45] why do we believe in brother branham and
[37:46] they don't know all they know is brother
[37:47] brown quotes
[37:48] they don't know the word and uh so
[37:51] hopefully
[37:52] our children uh have a good
[37:54] understanding of both by god's grace
[37:57] and if not that's what we want to do we
[37:58] want to build that up we're going to
[37:59] build them up with scriptural answers
[38:01] then also be able to say well brother
[38:02] branham taught this too
[38:04] we want him to know both so lord willing
[38:06] on sunday night we'll start that we'll
[38:07] see how long it will we'll do it maybe
[38:08] we'll do it for a month or whatever
[38:10] we'll see
[38:11] uh did you remember in sunday school
[38:13] years ago i did that
[38:15] i caught it catechism because the word
[38:18] catechism
[38:18] means uh answers to questions do you
[38:20] remember that it was at the other
[38:22] waterloo church maokai do you remember
[38:24] i used to i used my uh powerpoint
[38:26] remember that
[38:29] that's okay i thought maybe you might
[38:32] remember but
[38:33] it's been years and years and years so
[38:36] uh
[38:36] lord willing that's our plan uh you know
[38:39] feeling led we want the parents you know
[38:40] we want everybody to
[38:42] uh have their needs met you know if
[38:44] that's a burden on people's heart then
[38:45] we certainly want to
[38:47] uh do that i think that's a great desire
[38:51] i was just looking for that uh i
[38:52] couldn't find i was looking real quick
[38:54] on my
[38:58] no not on there stop to look and find it
[39:00] i know if i dig a little bit i'll be
[39:02] able to find it must be on another
[39:04] document okay well i set my timer let's
[39:07] do 30 minutes by god's grace
[39:09] part three now let's go to start in
[39:11] galatians one so lydia malachi well we
[39:14] i'll have you two break up these verses
[39:16] uh acacia first corinthians 7 14 for you
[39:20] amen all right haven't you going to join
[39:22] us today all right glory
[39:25] haven you'll do acts 20 verse
[39:28] 27 haven
[39:34] praise god all right so
[39:37] we ended last time by looking at how
[39:40] uh there's the apostolic blueprint for
[39:42] becoming a bride member it's hearing the
[39:44] preaching
[39:45] in church when you and i receive the
[39:47] preaching of jesus christ we repent and
[39:49] get baptized
[39:50] we have uh engagement to jesus christ
[39:53] the bible said he's espoused us to
[39:56] one husband even jesus christ praise god
[39:59] i wonder how many people really knew
[40:01] that when they got baptized in the name
[40:02] of the lord jesus christ
[40:03] that you were getting engaged to
[40:05] heaven's bridegroom praise god
[40:07] it was an engagement service praise god
[40:11] but that's what paul says you're
[40:12] espoused to one husband christ
[40:14] now this section tonight i want to look
[40:17] at this called
[40:18] uh the unchanging gospel blueprint
[40:21] so this blueprint cannot be changed so
[40:24] lydia why don't you read
[40:25] galatians 1 6 let's see 6 7 8 9 10 11
[40:28] 12.
[40:29] so read 6 uh read verses 6 7 8 3 6 7
[40:33] 8. thank you
[40:50] is
[40:53] thank you malakai read 9-12 please do i
[41:06] now persuade men for god
[41:08] or do i speak to these men for if i let
[41:11] these men i should not be the jew
[41:12] of christ but i certify you brethren
[41:15] that the gospel
[41:18] is
[41:24] amen there is a whole
[41:28] couple sermons just in this text here
[41:29] i'm just going to hit the highlights
[41:30] here
[41:31] by god's grace paul indicts anyone
[41:34] who would add one word or take one word
[41:37] away from his teachings
[41:39] this is an indictment he's shocked he's
[41:41] marveled how could this church that we
[41:43] started
[41:44] be so soon removed we just planted it a
[41:46] few years ago and we'll
[41:47] go back and see the years on that but
[41:50] how could they
[41:50] so soon be removed what were they doing
[41:52] they were adding circumcision back into
[41:54] it remember in chapter
[41:55] uh three it talks about that they were
[41:57] saying oh if you if you're going to be
[41:59] saved you've got to be circumcised
[42:01] and then he has to remind them in
[42:02] chapter three how did you get the holy
[42:04] spirit by the works of the law or the
[42:05] hearing of faith
[42:07] amen so he's shocked they're removed and
[42:10] he said
[42:11] anyone's curse whether we or an angel
[42:14] change the bible epistles that paul gave
[42:17] us
[42:18] they're cursed now we know today we
[42:21] looked at it recently there's
[42:22] permanent curses people curse to hell
[42:24] like cain
[42:25] balaam and but there's temporary curses
[42:27] upon people who are saved like uzziah
[42:30] right like king saul godly men for a
[42:33] while
[42:33] solomon they served god for a while but
[42:35] because of
[42:36] consistent iniquity they had curses upon
[42:40] their lives
[42:41] many times it was enemies they had to
[42:42] battle in fact i was just reading today
[42:44] who was that
[42:45] josiah at the end of his life he was a
[42:47] mighty king but then of his life
[42:49] he got a little lifted up he thought i
[42:50] can go back and i can fight
[42:52] and god said thus saith the lord don't
[42:54] fight he went to fight anyway he
[42:55] disguised himself remember that
[42:56] but he got hit by an arrow and he died
[42:59] yet they still honored him
[43:01] but you know see he died prematurely
[43:03] because he didn't honor god's word
[43:05] right uzziah died prematurely because he
[43:08] didn't honor god's word so
[43:10] this is what we say today are you
[43:12] brother jesse are you saying every
[43:13] church that doesn't believe the message
[43:14] is cursed
[43:15] to some degree i believe that to some
[43:18] degree
[43:19] because the bible says if you change it
[43:21] there's some
[43:22] curse that's going to come upon the
[43:23] people now church many times
[43:26] it's the slumber-ness right many times
[43:28] it's the lukewarm condition
[43:29] right they're rich and increased with
[43:31] goods have need of nothing
[43:32] and they don't realize that their lives
[43:35] are lukewarm before god
[43:37] think about that jesus said this age is
[43:40] going to have either hot
[43:41] lukewarm or cold god help us to be hot
[43:44] amen i was feeling hot during swing low
[43:45] sweet chariot
[43:46] amen i was feeling hot this morning when
[43:48] i prayed and read my bible and
[43:50] i was recording the next chapter i was
[43:52] feeling hot for jesus amen
[43:54] but we're sometimes up and we're
[43:56] sometimes down in our minds praise god
[43:58] but not our souls amen
[44:01] we never backslid we don't go throughout
[44:02] day backsliding into awful sins
[44:05] in our minds though we're sometimes up
[44:07] sometimes down
[44:09] but yes i believe it i believe people's
[44:11] eyes are
[44:12] are blind spiritually i believe their
[44:14] ears are dull of hearing
[44:17] and it's a temporary curse it's a
[44:18] temporary punishment
[44:20] upon them for changing the gospel
[44:23] i believe that's on the churches that
[44:25] reject brother branham and i believe
[44:26] that's on the churches that exalt
[44:28] brother branham
[44:28] there's some type of curse upon them
[44:31] because they're doing that
[44:32] and many times it's a prideful thing
[44:34] right many times it's a prideful thing i
[44:35] think many of the churches are like that
[44:37] they get cursed with a prideful spirit
[44:39] and god will bring down
[44:40] all those who are exalted with pride now
[44:43] look church are we pleasing men tonight
[44:45] or are we pleasing christ
[44:47] christ we don't worry what people say
[44:49] you know whether people like the gospel
[44:51] or not let them leave right if they
[44:52] don't want to stay
[44:53] let them leave but if they love jesus
[44:55] christ then they'll want to stay
[44:56] because we're preaching christ's gospel
[44:58] and we're not changing
[45:00] a part of it at all we're not trying to
[45:02] persuade uh
[45:04] men with a man's doctrine but with the
[45:07] word of god
[45:08] praise god and he says any servant of
[45:10] christ will not try to please the people
[45:13] he'll just preach the gospel amen
[45:16] and he's he certifies them he gives them
[45:18] a certification of proof
[45:20] i am not preaching this from myself
[45:23] jesus christ gave this to me by
[45:25] revelation
[45:27] hallelujah amen the revelation of jesus
[45:29] christ
[45:30] came to paul now
[45:33] i want you to see it where paul taught
[45:35] the same thing in every church so
[45:37] acacia first corinthians 4 17.
[45:51] yeah timotheus
[46:05] hey man what a beautiful every time i
[46:07] bring this up to the
[46:08] people that hate long hair on women they
[46:10] have nothing to say
[46:12] this has happened numerous times this
[46:13] past year i bring it up well no that was
[46:16] just for the corinthian church i said
[46:17] paul
[46:18] paul told timothy tell every person in
[46:21] every church
[46:22] i preach the same thing in christ
[46:23] everywhere praise god
[46:26] i love it the bible just leaves all
[46:27] these nuggets in there if we're willing
[46:29] to dig down and search it out
[46:30] thank you acacia beautiful remember in
[46:33] acts 20 verse 27 haven
[46:35] what did paul tell the ephesians acts 20
[46:38] verse 27 you got that sweetie
[46:45] amen remember stay there three years so
[46:47] within three years we know
[46:49] you can preach the whole council of god
[46:51] within three years i've been preaching
[46:53] we'll hear what 14 almost 15 years i
[46:55] believe we've heard the full counsel of
[46:57] god amen
[46:58] i believe that there's only
[47:01] one faith paul says in ephesians 4 5.
[47:04] can you just put that up there
[47:05] occasionally just so we can see it
[47:06] i just want to remind us all there's
[47:08] only one faith
[47:10] and we're not being prideful by saying
[47:12] we believe it we're just being humble
[47:13] we're saying thank god he gave it to us
[47:15] amen right not that we're better than
[47:17] anybody but we do have a higher calling
[47:19] and we do obey the scriptures better
[47:21] because the bible says there's one lord
[47:23] one faith there's only one baptism
[47:27] there's not many different faiths
[47:29] there's only one faith
[47:30] now jude one verse three libby can you
[47:33] pull it up there
[47:34] on the i'm sorry on the computer hun you
[47:36] pulled up there
[47:37] on the computer sorry thanks for being
[47:39] so flexible there
[47:40] i just want everybody to see him by
[47:42] god's grace jude 1
[47:44] 3. so paul says there's one faith
[47:48] and jude says we must earnestly fight
[47:51] for it
[47:52] right it must earnestly be contended for
[47:55] that's why
[47:55] i went to the brothers in jeffersonville
[47:57] that's why i did the debate because i'm
[47:58] trying to earnestly contend for the
[48:00] faith
[48:00] that was once delivered to the saints i
[48:03] try to do it in love
[48:05] beloved when i gave all diligence to
[48:07] write unto you of the common salvation
[48:09] it was needful for me
[48:10] to write unto you and exhort you that ye
[48:12] should earnestly
[48:13] contend for the faith which was once
[48:16] delivered
[48:17] unto the saints praise god amen
[48:21] thank the lord now paul received a
[48:25] direct
[48:25] command from paul i'm sorry no timothy
[48:27] received a direct command from paul
[48:30] to keep every word of god in first
[48:32] timothy 6
[48:33] 13 and 14. hold up there lydia first
[48:36] timothy 6 13 and 14. many don't know
[48:38] about this one this kind of flies under
[48:39] the radar a little bit
[48:41] beautiful scripture i charge thee look
[48:43] at that a charge a command in the sight
[48:45] of god
[48:46] who quickens all things and before
[48:48] christ jesus
[48:49] who before pontius pilate witness a good
[48:51] confession
[48:52] that thou keep this commandment without
[48:54] spot unrebukable until the appearing of
[48:57] our lord jesus christ
[48:59] amen and the church said hallelujah
[49:02] timothy
[49:03] had to keep it until christ came do you
[49:05] think it changes for us or do you think
[49:06] we still got to keep it
[49:08] amen we're still keeping it because he
[49:10] said keep it until you see jesus amen
[49:13] hallelujah wasn't a pick and choose well
[49:15] this was just for that church or that
[49:17] church
[49:17] it was for all the churches amen now
[49:20] there were certain problems in certain
[49:21] churches like
[49:22] you know uh fornication at corinth uh
[49:25] circumcision problems you know
[49:27] a galatia every church had their
[49:29] different problem
[49:30] remember that he those hebrew christians
[49:31] brother cam brought brother simon
[49:33] brought out they were babes in christ
[49:34] that was their problem
[49:36] instead of being teachers they backslid
[49:38] so far that they needed to be taught
[49:39] water baptism and salvation all over
[49:41] again
[49:42] that's how far they backslid
[49:46] paul cried
[49:49] writing the philippians a letter in
[49:50] philippians 3
[49:52] 17 19 which hopefully we'll finish
[49:54] sunday we'll see maybe i can finish that
[49:55] chapter on sunday
[49:56] philippians 3 17 18-19 paul says he
[50:00] cried
[50:01] because of the enemies of the cross of
[50:03] christ
[50:08] for many walk of whom i have told you
[50:10] often and now tell you even weeping now
[50:11] think about that
[50:12] he received these letters from jesus
[50:14] christ he gave him out and then when he
[50:16] sees people break them he starts crying
[50:18] you know why because it meant a lot to
[50:19] him because he met christ out there in
[50:21] the desert
[50:22] he left everything he knew he left the
[50:24] pharisees right he left all the
[50:26] apostles once he got saved he left all
[50:28] that met christ out there
[50:29] had a beautiful experience with christ
[50:32] and took his time
[50:33] wrote the letters and then to see those
[50:34] people change what he sent to them
[50:37] made him cry praise god ah because he
[50:39] cared so much about them
[50:41] that they are enemies of the cross of
[50:43] christ can you imagine being an enemy
[50:45] how could you be an enemy
[50:47] to the cross of christ
[50:50] because jesus says take up your cross
[50:52] now and follow me
[50:54] so see they're enemies of self-denial
[50:57] they're enemies of holiness
[50:59] right they're enemies of obedience
[51:03] right they're they're lovers of the
[51:05] lusts of the world all that jesus died
[51:08] to forgive people of they're lovers of
[51:10] that so now they're enemies of the cross
[51:15] and they heard paul and they read paul's
[51:17] direct letters fresh letters right
[51:19] just written on ink and parchment they
[51:21] read those fresh
[51:23] letters and they became enemies of the
[51:25] cross of christ
[51:26] i don't want to fight against the cross
[51:28] i want to take up the cross
[51:31] hallelujah but it's not going to be easy
[51:33] it's never easy
[51:35] verse 19.
[51:38] now look whose end is their destruction
[51:40] so these people are going to hell right
[51:42] those that are enemies of the cross
[51:44] enemies of righteousness and holiness
[51:46] whose god look at this their god is
[51:48] their belly that's who they worship
[51:50] oh if i can just get more for me and
[51:53] whose glory
[51:54] is in their shame remember the bible
[51:55] says the shame of your nakedness appear
[51:58] these are people that they glory in
[52:00] those you know sexy dress and all kinds
[52:02] of things
[52:03] they glory in that but the bible said
[52:05] it's their shame
[52:07] who mind earthly things they care too
[52:09] much
[52:10] about earthly things may god help us to
[52:12] set our affection on things above amen
[52:15] especially this time in a difficult time
[52:17] of the nation's going through here right
[52:19] here
[52:21] so paul wept when he saw people that
[52:23] they worshiped their bellies they
[52:25] worshiped themselves
[52:26] after getting the revelation of jesus
[52:28] christ he called them enemies of the
[52:29] cross
[52:30] they were more after earthly things than
[52:32] they were heavenly things
[52:35] what a rebuke
[52:39] now go to second timothy 2 16 through
[52:41] 18. i'm almost done with this section
[52:42] here then we'll get to this
[52:44] this five attributes of a submissive
[52:46] woman and a
[52:47] submissive church to christ
[53:00] second timothy 2 16-18 here paul rebukes
[53:03] the false teachers
[53:04] by saying their false doctrines are
[53:07] gangrene a flesh-eating
[53:08] disease and it literally destroys the
[53:13] faith of bride members or i'm sorry
[53:16] potential bride members potential
[53:18] right so they could be they could be uh
[53:21] potentially
[53:22] engaged to christ but when satan uh
[53:26] preaches his false doctrine and they
[53:27] accept the false instead of the true
[53:30] paul says their faith can be destroyed
[53:33] and church that should remind us of
[53:34] jesus's parable there's four kinds of
[53:36] grounds
[53:37] two of them are saved two are lost what
[53:39] happened to the two lost one of them
[53:40] satan just come and snatched it right
[53:42] away
[53:43] overthrew their faith the other one he
[53:46] burned it down with the heat of
[53:48] persecution and offense
[53:49] to withered away they slowly became less
[53:52] and less excited about god
[53:53] less and less interest in the message
[53:55] withered away and their faith was
[53:57] destroyed
[53:59] that's what paul says false doctrine
[54:02] destroys it overthrows
[54:04] the faith of some now what were they
[54:06] saying the rapture's already happened
[54:07] think about all the people that say
[54:08] brother
[54:09] you know the rapture already took place
[54:10] in 1963. i preached at a church like
[54:12] that in arkansas sad situation
[54:16] the resurrection has passed already and
[54:19] overthrow the faith of some thank god
[54:22] not all amen hallelujah praise god not
[54:25] all are going to be deceived the elect
[54:26] will not be deceived
[54:28] praise god those who love the world
[54:31] those who
[54:32] whose god is their belly they'll be
[54:33] deceived but not the elected
[54:36] amen
[54:41] now jesus solomon and john
[54:44] all say we must obey all the word of god
[54:47] jesus said heaven earth shall pass away
[54:49] my word shall not pass away not one of
[54:51] those commands
[54:52] will pass away solomon says god will
[54:55] call men and women liars
[54:56] who add or delete from his commands in
[54:59] proverbs 30 verses 5 and 6.
[55:02] every word of god is pure he's a shield
[55:04] unto them that put their trust in him
[55:06] add thou not unto his words lest he
[55:08] reprove thee
[55:09] and now be found a liar think about all
[55:11] those preachers that jesus
[55:13] is going to call liars at the white
[55:15] throne judgment
[55:16] they knew the baptism was wrong they
[55:18] knew the trinity was wrong
[55:21] they knew all these things were wrong
[55:22] but they told the people anyway oh it's
[55:24] true
[55:25] it's true and god's going to jesus is
[55:27] going to call him
[55:28] liar you lied to the people you deceive
[55:31] the people
[55:35] and john of course in revelation 22 says
[55:37] if you add to the word
[55:39] plagues are added to you if you take
[55:42] away
[55:43] god's part god will take your part out
[55:46] of the book of life
[55:50] and i love romans 3 verse 4. pull it up
[55:52] there acacia romans 3 verse 4
[55:55] this scripture proves god's word is our
[55:57] absolute
[55:58] it's your final word it's your unlimited
[56:00] source of strength it's your anchor
[56:02] praise god
[56:03] amen it's your umpire it's your
[56:05] stoplight it's your stop sign praise god
[56:07] it's your judge it's your supreme court
[56:09] praise god it's your north star the word
[56:12] of god is everything
[56:14] god forbid yeah let god be true but
[56:16] every man a liar as it's written
[56:19] that thou mightest be justified in thy
[56:20] sayings and might has overcome
[56:23] with our judge how are we going to
[56:24] overcome church by the word of god
[56:27] now let's get to this last section here
[56:29] i got uh 12 minutes on there but i'll
[56:31] probably go
[56:31] over a little bit than that okay go to
[56:35] ephesians 5
[56:36] 22 ephesians 5 22 in your bibles if you
[56:38] got them
[56:46] now before uh any brother wants to jump
[56:48] on a sister and say sister there's five
[56:50] things you got to do for me
[56:51] let me remind the brothers that jesus
[56:53] said the husbands have to love first
[56:56] praise god you know brother some
[56:59] brothers get in the wrong spirit
[57:01] and they just demand they just demand
[57:04] that the woman follow through but
[57:05] first they got to be leading with love
[57:08] because jesus didn't
[57:09] demand at first jesus led by love
[57:13] the leader is the servant praise god the
[57:15] one who has real love is the servant
[57:20] but we're looking at of course the we're
[57:23] looking at the spiritual application of
[57:25] these commands
[57:26] to the the wives right
[57:29] now paul uses husband and wife
[57:31] relationships here
[57:33] to express five attributes christ
[57:35] desires in his bride
[57:38] a woman always represents a church
[57:40] ezekiel 16
[57:41] 7 says god calls israel a woman
[57:44] and acts 7 verse 38 says moses was a
[57:47] part of the church in the wilderness
[57:50] okay so god calls israel a woman
[57:54] first but then she's unfaithful and then
[57:56] mo or i'm sorry
[57:57] stephen calls israel a church in the
[58:00] wilderness a bride in the wilderness so
[58:02] church and bride
[58:03] are always the same so the first
[58:07] aspect is found in verse
[58:10] 22. i'm sorry 23 go to 20 verse 23 i'm
[58:12] sorry hon
[58:13] ephesians 5 20. for the husband is the
[58:16] head of the wife
[58:17] even as christ is the head of the church
[58:19] he is the savior of the body now
[58:21] brothers
[58:23] before we could jump on our high horse
[58:24] we got to be willing to save our wives
[58:27] help them in every way we can jesus
[58:29] didn't lay aside some of his time
[58:31] he laid down everything for his family
[58:34] praise god
[58:35] right he laid him his whole self behind
[58:39] so a brother that's got the wrong
[58:40] attitude and wants to demand things
[58:42] he doesn't have the spirit of christ yet
[58:44] because the spirit of christ makes you a
[58:46] servant
[58:46] the spirit of christ makes you love
[58:48] first and then
[58:50] hope for love later right now jesus
[58:52] didn't have to hope he knew who'd
[58:53] love him but as brothers we have to hope
[58:55] amen
[58:56] we have to trust that our wives and our
[58:59] children will follow our example
[59:01] if we really lead with love in our
[59:02] hearts amen
[59:06] so the first attribute is the church of
[59:08] jesus christ has only one head
[59:11] the real church not the denomination the
[59:13] real bride of christ
[59:17] and who is christ christ is the word
[59:20] john 1 1 in the beginning was the word
[59:22] the word was with god the word was god
[59:26] so the word is the only headship
[59:29] now most churches you know are married
[59:32] they're headed by man-made creeds right
[59:34] bylaws traditions and they always
[59:36] contradict what paul wrote
[59:39] on many many things so let me ask you
[59:42] does the world
[59:43] rule those kind of churches is the word
[59:46] the head of those kind of churches no
[59:50] it's just like the pharisees they had
[59:52] made their man-made interpretations
[59:54] greater than the law of moses
[59:58] and jesus rebuked them in matthew 15 he
[1:00:00] said why do you transgress the
[1:00:02] commandment of god
[1:00:03] by your tradition that's the same thing
[1:00:05] we can walk into any denominational
[1:00:06] church tonight
[1:00:07] and say why do you transgress the
[1:00:09] commandments of god
[1:00:11] by your creeds right we could say that
[1:00:13] same thing
[1:00:14] why do you transgress the word of god
[1:00:17] and allow homosexuals to be married
[1:00:19] right why do you transgress the word of
[1:00:21] god and you make uh
[1:00:23] the wine and bread the literal body and
[1:00:25] blood of jesus christ
[1:00:27] right why do you let women cross-dress
[1:00:29] and men cross-dress
[1:00:30] why do you transgress the commands of
[1:00:32] god by your tradition
[1:00:34] now think about that church every church
[1:00:36] in this area would be guilty of that
[1:00:39] right so it's not that we're angry or
[1:00:42] upset i know i'm
[1:00:42] speaking a little stern tonight but it's
[1:00:44] just because paul said it in such a
[1:00:46] a such a simple plain manner to change
[1:00:50] one word
[1:00:50] brings a curse
[1:00:54] and so we ought to be thankful church we
[1:00:55] see the blessings of god on our lives
[1:00:57] right i see it all the time with friends
[1:00:59] that i s that i work with not so much
[1:01:00] anymore because of covid
[1:01:01] but when i was around the brothers that
[1:01:03] were in denominations you can see the
[1:01:04] the troubles they have in their lives
[1:01:07] like money trouble marriage trouble all
[1:01:09] kinds of troubles
[1:01:10] and they're little curses on their lives
[1:01:12] they're addicted to movies you know
[1:01:13] there are all kinds of
[1:01:14] secrets that they hide you know they
[1:01:17] have all these troubles on the side
[1:01:19] maybe adultery you know maybe all kinds
[1:01:21] of fornication all kinds of
[1:01:23] problems they're cursed because they
[1:01:25] change the word of god
[1:01:26] they don't believe the full word of god
[1:01:29] jesus said they on they draw an eye with
[1:01:32] their mouth
[1:01:32] they honor me with their lips but their
[1:01:34] heart is far from me praise god
[1:01:36] church it doesn't really matter what we
[1:01:38] say or what how we act it's what we do
[1:01:40] at home praise god
[1:01:42] it's what we do when we're out in the
[1:01:44] public it's what we do with our families
[1:01:46] doesn't matter what we say it's what we
[1:01:48] do praise god
[1:01:50] because the pharisees honor god they
[1:01:51] sang beautiful songs they dress
[1:01:53] nice and they dress holy which is good
[1:01:56] but they didn't
[1:01:57] keep the commands of god the word wasn't
[1:02:00] their headship
[1:02:02] he said in vain do they worship me
[1:02:05] teaching for doctrines the commandments
[1:02:07] of men so a lot of those people we know
[1:02:09] it we see it
[1:02:09] a lot of them are worshiping in vain
[1:02:12] their worship doesn't
[1:02:13] change them right how many people how
[1:02:16] many people are still laying out of
[1:02:17] church and they
[1:02:19] because of covet and they can tell it's
[1:02:21] really not a pandemic
[1:02:23] they're just laying out because it's
[1:02:24] easy right they're just laying out
[1:02:26] because
[1:02:27] uh their their worship is made anyway
[1:02:32] man they reject the headship of the word
[1:02:35] and i'll just have to close
[1:02:37] in a few minutes here so just bear with
[1:02:38] me now in this book church i list
[1:02:42] 10 of the most sinful teachings
[1:02:45] churches promote
[1:02:48] that say they're the church of jesus but
[1:02:50] these prove they're not
[1:02:53] let me just i'm going to list them off
[1:02:54] quickly homosexuality
[1:02:56] adultery they marry them two three times
[1:02:58] four
[1:02:59] fornication they support that they don't
[1:03:02] preach against that
[1:03:03] abortion murdering babies women
[1:03:06] preachers
[1:03:07] substance abuse viewing sinful movies
[1:03:11] and television shows
[1:03:13] shameful hair lengths false conversions
[1:03:15] they say they're born again
[1:03:17] when they're not even sanctified and in
[1:03:20] modest clothing
[1:03:22] there's 10 right there 10. how many more
[1:03:24] can we do
[1:03:25] if we put the catholic uh bread and wine
[1:03:28] in there
[1:03:29] i mean you start listing off all the
[1:03:30] things you can put in there
[1:03:33] really adds up quick doesn't it now
[1:03:36] remember paul said don't take one thing
[1:03:37] away
[1:03:38] look at that paul preach all these
[1:03:40] church we if we had the time
[1:03:42] we could go through all these here's one
[1:03:45] you don't hear often on homosexuality so
[1:03:47] in case you pulled up
[1:03:48] first timothy 1 10 and 11. here's one
[1:03:50] most people don't catch
[1:03:52] there's a few of these i thought i might
[1:03:53] bring out they might be a help to you
[1:03:59] now remember paul calls it a reprobate
[1:04:04] mind
[1:04:04] in romans 1 but we read that often i'm
[1:04:06] not going to read that one
[1:04:07] in first corinthians 6 he says uh
[1:04:11] homosexuals will not inherit the kingdom
[1:04:12] of god and first timothy 1 verses 10 and
[1:04:15] 11.
[1:04:16] first timothy 1 verses 10 11. for
[1:04:19] whoremongers for them that defile
[1:04:20] themselves with mankind
[1:04:23] for men stealers for liars for and
[1:04:25] persons
[1:04:26] if there be another thing that's
[1:04:27] contrary to sound doctrine
[1:04:29] according to the glorious gospel of the
[1:04:31] blessed god which was committed
[1:04:33] to my trust so whoremongers is that same
[1:04:36] word
[1:04:36] for lying with mankind let me look it up
[1:04:40] real quick
[1:04:51] yeah that one does yeah it can mean that
[1:04:54] sodomites
[1:04:57] defile themselves okay yep homo sodomi
[1:04:59] homosexual yes theirs
[1:05:00] so that defile themselves with mankind
[1:05:02] that's one that is kind of left off the
[1:05:04] radar sometimes
[1:05:07] this one on women preachers we haven't
[1:05:09] read lately so let's read that first
[1:05:10] corinthians 14
[1:05:12] acacia 36-34 first timothy i'm sorry
[1:05:15] first corinthians 14
[1:05:20] 34.
[1:05:25] we always we normally read the one in
[1:05:27] timothy but let me just show you how
[1:05:29] paul is so paul's so bold with this he
[1:05:32] says let your women keep silence in the
[1:05:34] churches that doesn't mean no
[1:05:36] praising it just means no preaching
[1:05:37] because he's talking about in this
[1:05:38] context
[1:05:39] who the word of god comes to right
[1:05:42] that's not in verse 36 we'll get there
[1:05:44] he said for is not permitted to them
[1:05:46] unto even to speak
[1:05:47] but they're commanded to be under
[1:05:48] obedience as also saith the law
[1:05:50] so paul's saying the old testament law
[1:05:52] still has weight in the new testament
[1:05:54] right
[1:05:55] god still has that same pattern women
[1:05:57] were never priests right
[1:06:00] that remains here the spiritual
[1:06:01] priesthood now remains
[1:06:03] women are silent in regards to the word
[1:06:05] the spiritual leadership
[1:06:07] and if they will learn anything let them
[1:06:09] ask their husbands at home there must
[1:06:10] have been women debating in the
[1:06:11] corinthian church
[1:06:13] they must have debated right after
[1:06:14] church right
[1:06:16] because he says wait till you get home
[1:06:17] and talk about now our sisters don't do
[1:06:19] that
[1:06:19] now i've had a couple of that have left
[1:06:20] though i've had a couple debate me right
[1:06:22] out in the hallway and brother brooks
[1:06:24] brother brooks that i talked about last
[1:06:25] time
[1:06:26] there should be a woman here that used
[1:06:27] to debate right after and and say oh yes
[1:06:29] was wrong and you said this wrong
[1:06:30] brother brooks still remembered that my
[1:06:34] goodness
[1:06:34] now see they're not under the headship
[1:06:36] of the holy spirit
[1:06:40] and if they will learn it okay it's for
[1:06:42] it's even a shame for women to speak in
[1:06:43] the church when it regards to the word
[1:06:46] verse 36 what he says came the word of
[1:06:49] god
[1:06:49] out from you or came unto you only
[1:06:53] so do you get the word and are you the
[1:06:55] only one who gets the word he's saying
[1:06:56] i'm the only one who got the word
[1:06:59] praise god these corinthians didn't
[1:07:01] write the bible paul wrote the bible
[1:07:03] jesus chose him to write the bible
[1:07:07] if any man think of himself to be a
[1:07:08] prophet or spiritual let me acknowledge
[1:07:11] the things that i write unto you
[1:07:12] are the commandments of the lord oh it's
[1:07:14] just a small thing brother just is it a
[1:07:15] small thing
[1:07:16] [Music]
[1:07:18] it's an awful thing for a woman to try
[1:07:20] to lead
[1:07:21] the men because that's out of god's
[1:07:26] order all right now i thought that would
[1:07:29] be helpful maybe you haven't seen that
[1:07:30] one for a while
[1:07:37] now uh the substance abuse especially
[1:07:39] for our children
[1:07:41] children anyone that would smoke try to
[1:07:43] get you to smoke or drink
[1:07:45] or do any evil substance abuse any drug
[1:07:48] you've got to turn them down because you
[1:07:49] know
[1:07:50] it's a it's a demon-possessed person
[1:07:52] trying to do that to you
[1:07:56] and even in the areas of liberty right
[1:07:58] we talked about wine a few
[1:08:00] last year we talked about wine wine is
[1:08:01] an area of liberty
[1:08:03] people could drink that in their house
[1:08:04] if they wanted we choose not to
[1:08:06] so i know some people that do in the
[1:08:08] message i know some people that do
[1:08:10] that's fine but paul said if that would
[1:08:13] cause somebody to stumble
[1:08:14] i wouldn't drink wine in my house as
[1:08:17] long as the world's standing praise god
[1:08:18] that's a long time
[1:08:20] right because this world is going to
[1:08:21] remain standing right for a long time
[1:08:23] so let's read that just so everybody
[1:08:25] sees that romans 14
[1:08:26] 21 there are liberties in christ right
[1:08:29] there are liberties food
[1:08:31] right meats and uh you can vegetarian
[1:08:35] i believe christmas goes in there
[1:08:36] celebrating holidays some of the things
[1:08:38] people do i think that falls in there
[1:08:40] holy days yeah that's right holy days
[1:08:43] it's all coming back to my memory a
[1:08:44] little bit go to romans 14
[1:08:46] 21. you got that occasion all right
[1:08:48] let's read that him that is weak in the
[1:08:50] faith receive but not
[1:08:52] to doubtful disputations that's verse
[1:08:55] one can you go to
[1:08:56] verse 21 sorry about that
[1:08:59] 21 it is good neither to eat flesh nor
[1:09:02] to drink wine nor
[1:09:03] anything whereby thy brother stumbleth
[1:09:05] or is offended
[1:09:07] or is made weak so anything we would eat
[1:09:10] or drink there's my timer so
[1:09:11] let me set five minutes that's only 35
[1:09:14] minutes can you believe that
[1:09:16] he says uh if it causes somebody to
[1:09:19] stumble
[1:09:21] then we shouldn't do it right we should
[1:09:23] stay away from that
[1:09:25] uh for time's sake acacia first
[1:09:28] corinthians 8
[1:09:29] 13. first corinthians 8
[1:09:32] 13. so anyone offers you cigarettes or
[1:09:36] drunkenness or
[1:09:37] oh i'm at my friend's house in the
[1:09:38] message oh they're let's let's get some
[1:09:40] of their wine we can have a drink of
[1:09:41] wine i don't
[1:09:43] i wouldn't do that i'd stay away from
[1:09:45] that thankfully no one's ever offered me
[1:09:47] that
[1:09:48] yeah here it is wherefore if meat make
[1:09:50] my brother to offend
[1:09:51] i will eat no flesh while the world
[1:09:54] standeth
[1:09:55] lest i make my brother to offend and all
[1:09:58] the children said
[1:10:00] that's beautiful hallelujah if anything
[1:10:04] would cause somebody to stumble then we
[1:10:06] should just not do it
[1:10:08] and the way you know is if they saw you
[1:10:09] do it
[1:10:11] like especially something that you'd
[1:10:12] watch or something you'd eat something
[1:10:14] you'd do
[1:10:15] and then they do it and they stumble
[1:10:17] right
[1:10:18] or they fall away from the gospel
[1:10:21] now hopefully by god's grace god would
[1:10:23] show us if we did something like that
[1:10:26] that would cause us to stumble
[1:10:30] okay so i just showed you 10 church can
[1:10:33] you imagine that
[1:10:34] just 10 simple doctrines that most
[1:10:38] churches
[1:10:39] deny can you imagine that church it's
[1:10:42] like they're preachers
[1:10:44] picture that it's like they're preachers
[1:10:46] when they get ready to preach
[1:10:48] they got scissors and they cut out those
[1:10:50] scriptures can you imagine a preacher
[1:10:51] doing that
[1:10:52] if he would come to the church and he
[1:10:54] would cut out first corinthians 11 about
[1:10:56] hair length can you imagine that's what
[1:10:58] they do
[1:11:00] they literally i said they literally
[1:11:02] they spiritually do that
[1:11:03] they cut out the parts about marriages
[1:11:06] and how to live holy
[1:11:07] they cut it out and they're bringing a
[1:11:08] bible that's got holes all in it
[1:11:12] and paul said to do that you're cursed
[1:11:14] should we cut up the bible or should we
[1:11:15] keep it the way it is
[1:11:17] keep it the way it is yeah we don't want
[1:11:19] to cut out one thing
[1:11:21] we want all of it amen praise god like
[1:11:23] my man said lock stock and barrel we
[1:11:25] want all of it praise god
[1:11:27] hallelujah let me close with this last
[1:11:28] thought here
[1:11:30] so everybody can see right everybody can
[1:11:32] see christ
[1:11:33] is not the head of most churches now
[1:11:36] church
[1:11:37] it's so easy now you just got to go on
[1:11:39] youtube and type in
[1:11:41] men's hair length right men men in
[1:11:43] shorts like answers are
[1:11:45] easier to find than ever in other words
[1:11:48] people
[1:11:49] have less digging less effort
[1:11:52] and so that's why god in this last age
[1:11:55] gets such awful judgments in the
[1:11:56] tribulation
[1:11:57] because all the knowledge was increased
[1:11:59] right
[1:12:00] knowledge has increased it daniel said
[1:12:03] and yet they still
[1:12:04] chose to turn down god's knowledge and
[1:12:06] that's just 10 of them that's just 10.
[1:12:09] like i said we can add communion we can
[1:12:11] out leadership pastors we can
[1:12:13] add all these kind of things in there
[1:12:15] that they break the word of god in those
[1:12:17] areas
[1:12:19] and someday i like to do that brother
[1:12:20] branham said there's hundreds and
[1:12:21] marriage and divorce
[1:12:22] he said there's hundreds of these things
[1:12:24] he said i can name but here's just one
[1:12:25] of a marriage and divorce
[1:12:27] so in closing you and i know
[1:12:31] most churches do not make jesus the head
[1:12:33] of the church
[1:12:34] he's really not ruling right even
[1:12:37] there's a rock and roll i could add a
[1:12:38] rock and roll right
[1:12:39] i could add that one of them
[1:12:43] and on all these ten scriptures there's
[1:12:46] no scriptures on the other side where
[1:12:48] it's okay for homosexual relationships
[1:12:51] to exist
[1:12:52] where it's okay for adultery to exist
[1:12:54] right can anybody think of one
[1:12:56] okay that's why i asked the people i
[1:12:58] believe a sign can you show me one time
[1:12:59] god ever asked a godly woman to cut her
[1:13:01] hair
[1:13:02] they didn't have no answer they got one
[1:13:04] of these emojis right now they didn't
[1:13:06] send it but that's what they should have
[1:13:07] sent me
[1:13:08] i don't have nothing or maybe it was
[1:13:10] that head-blown emoji
[1:13:13] right because that's what it was to me
[1:13:14] when i realized wow god never asked a
[1:13:15] godly woman to cut her hair
[1:13:17] the only people he asked to cut their
[1:13:19] hair was israel when they were sinning
[1:13:20] and they're going to be judged and
[1:13:21] kicked out of the land
[1:13:22] as a shame and then the slaves the
[1:13:25] slaves from
[1:13:26] heathen countries the women that they
[1:13:28] brought into their marriages right or
[1:13:30] slaves or concubines
[1:13:31] they made them shave their head for 30
[1:13:33] days right for 30 days they had to wait
[1:13:35] before they become a part of the family
[1:13:37] that's the only time god ever asked a
[1:13:38] woman to cut her hair never a real godly
[1:13:40] woman
[1:13:42] you never find home you know you never
[1:13:44] find a woman preaching
[1:13:46] in paul's meetings or cutting their hair
[1:13:50] see the holy spirit will uh the holy
[1:13:53] spirit will do this
[1:13:54] first attribute it will lead the real
[1:13:56] bride churches to make christ
[1:13:58] head over everything how many want
[1:14:00] christ to be the head of your life
[1:14:03] praise god let's stand we want christ to
[1:14:05] be the head of this
[1:14:07] church who do you know which churches do
[1:14:11] you know that keep all 10 of those
[1:14:13] simple commands
[1:14:17] there's 35 minutes can you imagine that
[1:14:20] musicians if you'll come
[1:14:21] which church do you know and like i said
[1:14:23] in the next week or two i'll get to
[1:14:25] the list there's a list by size uh the
[1:14:28] pew research center
[1:14:29] lists all the denominations in church we
[1:14:32] can go with each one and we can go to
[1:14:33] their web page
[1:14:35] and show you where they deny paul's
[1:14:37] teachings
[1:14:38] how can the bride how can the bride
[1:14:41] make their creed the headship rather
[1:14:43] than christ
[1:14:45] they can't it shows they're the false
[1:14:47] bride
[1:14:48] we're talking about who is the real
[1:14:50] bride of jesus christ
[1:14:53] who's the one that's really married to
[1:14:54] him that really loves him amen
[1:14:57] we'll keep every word and we'll make him
[1:15:00] the head
[1:15:01] let me just preview for next week so you
[1:15:03] see the second attribute she's
[1:15:04] submissive to everything
[1:15:07] so she obeys all the way third thing
[1:15:10] she submits to christ washing her with
[1:15:12] the water of the word
[1:15:16] the fourth thing is she's glued to
[1:15:18] christ she's joined to christ
[1:15:22] and the fifth thing she's an attitude of
[1:15:25] reverence and that's the one i think
[1:15:29] american churches need the most help
[1:15:31] with
[1:15:32] just an attitude of reverence to christ
[1:15:34] right
[1:15:35] that word means to be in awe like whoa
[1:15:40] to be in all of oh my i'm going to be
[1:15:42] real careful
[1:15:47] you know i say like this i really felt
[1:15:49] it when cam was here preaching
[1:15:50] remember i came up here after that
[1:15:51] morning service and i was like we heard
[1:15:53] from heaven you remember that
[1:15:54] i was like we are that's i that's when
[1:15:56] the last times i could no i really
[1:15:57] enjoyed sunday that was beautiful that
[1:15:59] was
[1:15:59] glorious but the last time i really felt
[1:16:02] like
[1:16:03] everybody was in awe was at that service
[1:16:06] and we want to keep that i'm thankful
[1:16:08] that we can we can return to that
[1:16:10] atmosphere right
[1:16:11] we can return there but this is an
[1:16:14] attitude that we want to have
[1:16:15] all the time amen because the bride
[1:16:18] reverences her husband
[1:16:21] in everything amen praise god so may god
[1:16:24] help us
[1:16:24] have an attitude of reverence for christ
[1:16:27] that's what i want to get to maybe next
[1:16:29] week we'll look at those other four
[1:16:32] but i'm glad jesus is my head amen
[1:16:35] i'm glad jesus is the head of this
[1:16:36] church praise god he tells us what to do
[1:16:39] we got some learning to do absolutely i
[1:16:42] want to learn praise god i want to grow
[1:16:43] i want to be
[1:16:44] more like christ and we are
[1:16:48] so let's bow our heads here
[1:16:51] in in prayer let's just pray let's pray
[1:16:53] two things let's pray that
[1:16:55] uh we can always keep christ as our head
[1:16:59] in everything and then let's pray for
[1:17:02] our friends and loved ones
[1:17:04] in churches where christ isn't the head
[1:17:07] that god will show them that
[1:17:08] [Music]
[1:17:12] like when i talked to my mom a few years
[1:17:13] ago she knows her denomination christ is
[1:17:15] not the head there
[1:17:19] and i pleaded i begged with her to come
[1:17:20] out
[1:17:24] i remember with brother bang's little
[1:17:25] brother one of his little brothers
[1:17:27] i was pleading with him i said when are
[1:17:28] you going to come out of your
[1:17:29] denomination when
[1:17:31] christ is not the head but graham said
[1:17:33] thus saith the lord all denominations
[1:17:35] will take the mark of the beast
[1:17:37] [Music]
[1:17:39] something that has to be decided
[1:17:44] as a bride as a woman as a church the
[1:17:46] church has to make a decision
[1:17:47] is christ going to be my head is going
[1:17:49] to be
[1:17:50] his commands going to be my absolute or
[1:17:53] something else going to be my absolute
