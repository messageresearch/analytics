========================================

pray over the word brother i forgot about you praying for the prayer prayer request sir sir yes sir for your gracious brother sure love you buddy but yeah if you would if you could pray for the word i'd appreciate that i think we did that on wednesday too right it's a repeat of wednesday all right so joshua 17 verses 13 through 18. i'd like to preach on this i feel ready to preach this morning praise god i was really enjoying my studies and just into the word of god had a good prayer this morning and just thankful for god's amazing grace i'm just checking a few things here before we get started joshua 17 i'll read 13 to 18. we'll read our memory verse from brother stephen praise god and then we'll have brother william say a word of prayer for the word of god how many looking forward to the word today amen praise god i hope you come ready to pull and enjoy the word and maybe sit through a two and a half hour sermon or something like that we'll see you know we'll see how it goes no i'm just joking uh just kind of funny because you all pull so well that it's easier to preach that long when you pull so well so thank you for pulling on the word of god and just creating such a beautiful atmosphere here we're going to read i did not get to this portion on wednesday i thought i would but the holy spirit seemed to direct me to the other thoughts that we were building upon with possessing all your land if you didn't listen to wednesday i'd encourage you to get a chance uh listen to that uh it just was to me it was just was a wonderful message there as we looked at all the land that you have to conquer praise god and i think i'll review a little bit here today but joshua 17 since we read it wednesday i think i'll just go down to verse 16. why don't we just read 17 verse 16. i'll just read that just as a brief summary and then we'll read our memory verse if you remember the story from wednesday i'll just brief it uh manasseh says they they're great people they grew by over 12 000 people within a matter of 30 some years and they said we need more land and joshua tells them well go go clear the land we gave you they were asking for another lot right but joshua says go clear and then they start making excuses look at verse 16 16 shows their excuses but then after that joshua encourages them you can do it praise god see when we when we make excuses god's going to say you can do it just forget your excuses just remember the power of god so that's why that's why this is such a great lesson praise god verse 16. uh and the children of joseph said the hill is not enough for us and all the canaanites that dwell in the land of the valley have chariots of iron well they who are bethleh i'm sorry are beth sheehan and her towns and they who are of the valley of jezreel all right let's go to philippians 2 verses 2 and 3. this is our memory verse thank you both stephen appreciate that brother just a beautiful portion of scripture here how we can love one another and that's what we're known for right we're known for the love we have one for another praise god philippians 2 verses 2 and 3. let's read verses two and three ready one two three fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love being of one accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vain glory but in loneliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves amen let's buy our heads brother william if you would just pray for the word brother and ask the holy spirit to have his way today but i would thank you for this beautiful morning yes jesus thank you god come to your house to stand with me yes lord hallelujah hallelujah father we are looking at you amen amen praise god thank you brother you god bless you all you may be seated by god's grace all right so i have some slides here we'll look at uh lord willing we'll try to get through chapter 17 and 18 and of course i'm not reading every verse because as you've seen with some of these chapters they go through the details of the borders and i don't i don't feel be a a good use of time to go through all the details you know from this stone to that stone into that river and that hill and i feel be better to give the spiritual application of some of these things uh so we've been working on that by the grace of the lord and i trust that's been a blessing to you uh so let's look at chapter 17 and 18 today now we read our text here our text is joshua 17 verses 13 to 18. so i'm going to turn back there and you're familiar as i mentioned on wednesday lord willing listening to the service got a chance to listen to that i'll just go ahead and read it you know i might as well read it now since we're starting here verse 13 and chapter 17. yet it came to pass when the children of israel were waxing strong that they put the canaanites to tribute but did not utterly drive them out now look at that they're strong but they just had a little compromise they couldn't drive them out now there could have been different reasons right maybe they were lukewarm maybe they were in their minds right right maybe they were just tired of war but they were strong they were waxing strong and they chose not to drive certain enemies out but i believe they did it as a type there was of course other natural reasons but as a spiritual type it shows us we won't drive out all the sin nature until we get a new body praise god and we saw that on wednesday when malachi read that out of romans 8 23 let's read it anyway romans 8 23 since we're just starting out here uh church when you are born again you have the spirit of adoption amen you can say i'm in adoption because i've got the spirit and it cries out not old pastor o pastor doesn't cry oh mama oh mama it cries out father father abba father amen don't cry oh brother brandon oh brother branham they don't cry oh martin luther oh martin luther you see the ridiculousness of this when you got the holy ghost it looks to one person jesus christ amen amen because it cries out abba father amen it's a prayer to your heavenly father amen it's a connection to papa god when you're born again amen you are adopted into his family with a position and a purpose praise god but romans 8 23 is malachi read it to us uh i'm sorry i'm in yeah i'm in chapter seven so 8 23 and not only they but ourselves also which have the first fruits of the spirit see when you're born again you have a first measure but there's more holy ghosts to come especially when you get those two new bodies amen theophany and glorified amen even we ourselves grow within ourselves waiting for the adoption to with the redemption of our body so now verse 15 says we've received the spirit of adoption so you have the spirit of it it's a first fruit it's a down payment on the rest that's going to come praise god you have the spirit you are adopted the family of god the rest is coming your adoption finishes when you get a new body to it means that is right so it means that is the redemption of our body adoption finishes when you get a new body and there's no more sin nature and you praise god there's no more falling in sin amen there's no more falling in disgrace or discouragement there's no more guilt there's no more uh a failure feeling you are completely whole you are just like christ amen the bible said when you see him you'll be like him amen hallelujah praise god but church we're adopted now praise god that's why you mothers if you're doctor with the holy ghost you can pray for those children command those demons to leave and they must obey amen amen unless it's god's will to prolong it right unless it's god's will right because we can't do anything of our own selves it's got to be god's will some of you brothers and you husbands you can pray the prayer of faith and you know god's going to answer because you're adopted in the kingdom of god amen hallelujah you have the spirit of adoption praise god hallelujah so we thank the lord for that now this is part of the adoption process we have the spirit of adoption now verse 14 and the children of joseph spain yeah joseph speaking to joshua saying why hast thou given me but one lot and one portion to inherit seeing i'm a great people for as much as the lord hath blessed me hitherto why you give me one lot when i'm so big and so great does that sound like a good question i'm so big and great why would you uh why would you give me this small portion now i'm going to skip ahead because i i i outlined all this here i'm going to skip ahead he said i'm so great why would you give me such a small portion of land in other words i need more joshua you haven't maybe done it the right way now look at this attitude towards the prophet of god i need another one now look at verse we read there 14. now notice his question seems legitimate because in one way they'd increased by 12 200. so if you you know we don't have time now but if i read this morning if you read your bible numbers 133 when they come out of the exodus and then at the end of numbers right before moses dies they had 52 700. so this was a pretty good increase for 38 years 12 500 this people was a blessed people they were a great people and so now he makes they're making the case we need more land and it also seems now by by what we see later it seems they were seeking favor from joshua who was kind of like their brother their real close brother from their their mother right because the jacob had four uh was it four wives if i'm not mistaken four wives yeah he had four wives leah rachel billa and i can't remember that last one was it zilpah yeah good yeah it's good i'm impressed four four four wives and so it seems like manasseh uh you know they're ephraim's brother from rachel it seems like they're trying to get a little bit of extra help because you know he's from our brother he's from our line he's from rachel he's not from leo or the bond women or anything like that uh but notice joshua like a real man of god doesn't show partiality and which we all we all aim to do right right we all aim to do that we don't and of course we're gonna have friends that are closer than others right like brother ram says we're gonna have some people that are easier to love than others but we don't want to be partial when it comes down to judgment right like well you know you need a home church but you don't need one well you can cut your hair sister but you shouldn't sister you don't give him partial judgments on the word of god and joshua stands strong amen whether it's a friend asking him for help or a brother from his own mother or no matter who it is he stayed true with the word of god now verse 15 joshua picks it up and he retorts or corrects their argument look what he says in verse 15. and joshua answered and said if thou be a great people then get up to the wood country if you're so great manasseh go take the land see he's using his words against him i'm a great people i need more land well joshua said if you're so great then just possess what you got you're so great right aren't you so great aren't you you're so elected right brad you're so elected shouldn't you possess the promises or you mean you can't overcome covet you can't overcome a few fears and uh you you need more of something else no we've got exactly what we need christ has given us every spiritual blessing in christ jesus amen see they're complaining oh we're so great we're so holy yeah but we need more he says first possess what you got if you're so great amen this is one of those beautiful thoughts i was telling you about uh we're finally getting to this one see he uses their own description as a reason they need to cut down the trees themselves right and he mentions the giant see oh yeah this is the land of the giants too with all these trees so it's hard work giants and all these things great people should be able to do great people can cut down trees can't they this is before we had the machines we got today right chainsaws but a great people should be able to handle some you know some trees and some giants right so joshua corrects them by the holy spirit he picks up their deceptiveness in here now verse 16 and the children of joseph said the hill is not enough for us oh see again they go back to oh it's not enough and all the canaanites oh now we get now here we get to the real reason it wasn't the fact that there's trees there anybody can cut down a tree and all the canaanites that dwell on the land of the valley have chariots of iron oh okay okay now i see now i get the picture it's not really about the trees it's about the fact that you're afraid of the enemy if anybody had a a right to be unafraid amen it was joshua's people amen right if anybody had any reason to have great faith it should have been joshua's armies amen but somehow over the course of five or seven years this part this portion of the bride can say like this this portion of the church lost their real strong faith in god's word and now the obstacles look greater than the word of god looks greater to them the chariots of iron look greater uh uh than the promise of god that church how quickly we can forget about the walls of jericho that fell down before us amen like romans said how quickly we can forget that the blood of the lamb brought us out of egypt when we get to the red sea praise god how quickly that's human thinking that's why jesus said abide in me and my words abide in you and then ask what you will and it'll be done for you praise god see we must be careful to keep the word abiding in us and the testimonies abiding on our lips because then we know another battle is coming and it makes us ready for the battle amen rather than making excuses well i'll never possess this uh i i need to go somewhere else i need to go to some other church right that's kind of like that that's kind of like the thing here i need i need to listen to somebody else other than brother branham you know we need somebody else other than brother branham we need another prophet we need an eighth messenger oh this is nonsense praise god see how they make excuses they don't possess what god's already given to them for fear of fights and for fear of obstacles church where there's no fear in the army of god there's only perfect love amen hallelujah and that drives out all fear amen oh thank god amen so in the second complaint we get the real reason right they're afraid of chariots of iron and if you study the history i read the commentary this morning john gill a preacher from the 1800s he said the i the church really weren't made of iron they're made of wood and they just had like iron coverings on the wheels it wasn't even a total iron chariot so so they they created in their minds they created this well this obstacle is bigger than what we actually think it is in church isn't that what we do we make a problem bigger than what it actually is we imagine well if i say something then this is that's going to happen that's all this we create these major huge iron chariots when they're just wood and they'll burn amen and they're easily defeated when god's behind us amen and when the great almighty god is on our side nothing shall stand before him praise god and god already said every place where you put your feet it's yours amen they just had to go there and step on the ground say this is mine in jesus name glory that's what you must do too this is mine in jesus christ's name just approach it just go there just face the issue and deal with it and jesus will deliver you amen hallelujah and it also though proves the great ones among us sometimes lose a little bit of our faith because the anointing in our minds right think of all the testimonies we gave last remember last year everybody gave their testimonies now think about the trials you had this year when you felt a little afraid what about all those other great testimonies we had see we're all subject to it and we all need restoration the bible says the bible said we all need a daily reminding we all need a transformed mind that's why your time with god is so critical because that's the time where you'll get transformed and you'll be ready for the next battle see all of us can lose a little bit of faith and give into a little bit of fear i go back and forth on it right i i'm battling fear this year too with all these vaccine mandates and everything like that right losing my job sometimes i'll drive home thinking well if i lose my job i'll go to that place and look for a job and then i'm gonna yeah or maybe i'll just i'll say uh maybe uh can i have the vaccine next week and then i'll empty out my bank accounts and run run to texas with my family or something like that you know it's just you start thinking of things i'm laughing too as a man how do i gotta provide i gotta and see and i and as a man i think i've got control no sir jesus christ has control amen he's the one that opens the door that no man can shout amen he's the man that shuts every door that no man can open amen and i've got to put my faith in him i need a refresher of faith in him i need to get my mind realigned with the word of god amen praise god because fear has no place in the body of christ like this week i heard a sermon uh from a preacher he was a guest preacher and i was listening and i the more i listened the more i got grieved in my spirit and i'm like this is wrong i don't want that church affected by these false doctrines so i sat down and studied and i i in the first hour of the sermon i found seven false doctrines and i said i'm not afraid i'm going to reach out i just shared it right with the pastor because i'm not afraid i am not going to live in fear if i see something wrong then i should call it out praise god because the bible says if you rebuke a wise man he'll love you amen proverbs says that amen you correct the wise person they're going to care about you more amen and if not they are either backslidden they're never born again or they're the seed of the devil but see god corrects all the children amen hallelujah in years past i might have been a little afraid to send that but i was just like send i recorded a 10 minute video or audio and i just sent it out praise god because what have i got to be afraid of and let's say i'm wrong on one of those well and i still corrected the person on six wrongs they had and maybe i had one misunderstanding see that's the holy spirit church the holy spirit is the spirit of truth amen the holy spirit is a spirit of holiness praise god and so i'm learning that these last few years you know debating believe the sign and emailing joseph and billy paul i'm learning this i will not fear any man the man i fear the most is jesus christ that's the only one i'm going to fear praise god and we have to be able to say it like this if everyone leaves us we'll still serve jesus christ so for example if i left the church you still stand for jesus christ if you left the church i'd still stand for jesus christ amen because we're not submitting to man we're submitting to the holy spirit amen hallelujah see how we get in these spirits of fear we've got to be very careful we're all going to experience it right we're all going to feel that come on us but we've got to go to prayer yeah i said god give me the give me the wisdom to approach this situation that's the timing when to do it and how to do it we know the answer is here in the word we know the knowledge is in here right but we need the wisdom of when to do it and how to do it so i waited a week and i got some good good responses and hopefully they'll pray about it and things like that see even great even great giant or sometimes gets more giants hello giant killers these guys are ridiculous but yeah they are afraid of the giants a few years afterwards may god help us to restore our strength when we get discouraged right it doesn't mean we're not longer we're no longer born again it doesn't even mean we're not living in the land praise god we're still baptized with the holy ghost we're still living in a limb but sometimes we get a little afraid of that next giant we haven't seen them before we don't know how they live we don't know all about them and we just if we're not careful we get some carnal thinking and we've got to get that carnal thinking now we've got to wash those thoughts away we've got to let the light of god shine into there shine into the darkness and that will reveal the way to go don't forget church we're only only to be strong and courageous they must have forgotten the simple path to strong to strength right remember this what's the steps of strength corinthians says the way to be strong is to humble yourself and repent you have to start with humility and repentance and realize i don't have the strength and the reason i'm not strong is because i've sinned or i've got this distraction which would be a sin or i've got fearful forgive me my fear lord and now i'm going to remember that you promise you'll be faithful to me you never leave me you never forsake me and no man will stand before me all the days of my life amen and then after that then you just keep all the commands you constantly praise god you meditate upon them just like abraham we have a prayer life for men stood before joshua when aiken failed right those men of ai stood before joshua they got the victory the first time 36 men died now joshua wasn't there but the other men were there but see that's what we must remember yes no man will stand before us as long as we do these things amen does that help by god's grace manasseh had forgotten the simple directions repent remember and then keep praise god repent remember keep the word of god and no one will defeat you all the days of your life i just told you how to be undefeated i should have i should have heard some shouts out there amen hallelujah repent remember that god's with you and keep the word you can't be stopped amen hallelujah there's no devil that can stop you you're strong and courageous amen hallelujah never fail for joshua it ain't going to fail for you can anybody show me where it failed for joshua where this ever failed no as long as he kept this it always succeeded as long as you keep this church the victory's coming to you amen hallelujah oh i love the word of god don't you i'm laughing because i'm happy that's why i'm laughing because i've seen myself get victory all these year after year after year amen that's how i got it praise god verse 16. and all the children of josephus said the hill is not enough for us okay i already yeah i already did that one okay so church what is the lesson now here's the beautiful thought i want to share for the new testament the lesson is you must conquer your land first before seeking other land right stay in your position manasseh was basically saying i want a different position this this position is too hard for me i don't want to deal with some of these things so i need a different position right and a pastor is an excellent example of this right i must conquer the land of my home life before i can even be a pastor here which i already did but i've got to keep those enemies under subjection too right any any spirit that would come up in my house this is what we have we have preachers that go out and preach and then their houses are already in shambles to begin with they should not even be out preaching until they first win the battle at their home they've lost the battle and their own land but they're saying i'm no discontent i'd like to go somewhere else i want to run from the problem so i can go try to help somebody you can't help anybody the bible said you can't lead anybody you can't help anybody and first the holy ghost lives in your home amen you create an atmosphere in your home and now that you're led by the holy ghost there now you can be led by the holy ghost other places amen we got too many preachers that think they're helping people and they're not because they haven't let the holy ghost help them amen disobedient wives disobedient children sin uh child molestation adultery greed millionaires all these things they're all entrenched in sin they haven't even conquered the land god gave them amen and they're begging for more land shame on them hallelujah it's nothing but a manasseh move can i say like that oh glory amen it's nothing but a manasseh move oh give me more i don't like the church where i'm at give me a bigger church i'm very content at a small church power just shows what's in you right like they gave joe biden power it shows the characters in him he's a total liar a demon-possessed liar like kamala harris they're all demon-possessed liars they're murderers the spirit of murder is on them power just manifested what spirits in them glory and church when you get power and you get authority it manifests that the holy ghost the almighty god lives in you praise god amen land and possessions and materials just magnify what's in you like i probably told this before we had someone that used to come to church and i won't let her come back to church so she repents of something i did that with brother brooks so brother brooks was a witness and she had a lie oh and she always surely said well if i had a million dollars you know that was her excuse to use the lottery or play the lottery she said if i had two million dollars i'd give so much to church i said that's nonsense i said you would give whatever percentage you're giving right now which is very little right right you know well one if i had more money i'd be more faithful i'd do more for the kingdom of god no you would do exactly what you're doing now right it just disgusts me about jesus said be faithful little they don't make you amen conquer the land of your life your home your personal relationship with god conquer that land first and then we'll talk about some other things amen but first be faithful with the land that i give you she was trying to tell me this woman was trying to tell me she was in a delusion she was trying to tell me that the nurses around her were her daughters and she never even been married a black woman a white woman and these others racist they're all her daughters i'm like you're insane i said you're crazy and you're not going to bring that lie back to the churches and she said well you prophesied one time and said a baptist preacher is going to come to the church i said i never prophesied i said i was praying for him to come into the church and brother brooks is sitting right there he's my witness i never prophesied that i've never prophesied anything purposely it's just by accident or not my accent but it's by by leading of the lord i've only prophesied or my dreams amen hallelujah but see people want to argue and fuss like that that's fine let them be manasseh you be joshua you be joshua possess your land first amen be faithful with what god gave you first amen amen the bible said i gotta have my children in obedience if they don't obey me i can't be a pastor with all respect dignity and honor if my children don't honor me if they don't respect me i can't be a pastor i got to conquer their hearts first right and when they're born again then that it's all easy after that right but leading up to that you got to get them born again right for if a man doesn't know how to rule the land of his own house how shall he take care of the land of the church of god i didn't hear you yes it's impossible to say oh i deserve god i deserve more when you haven't been faithful with what god gave you first hallelujah how many issues we got with messed up homes right money like we said money women power all those things mixed up in there and they're trying to search for more land when they haven't even got victory over their land first there's two more examples take your land first take your time first if you can conquer your time then god will give you more seek ye first the kingdom of god and then all these things will be added to you so in other words you got to conquer the mourning first i preached on this all the time but it's true jesus prayed first david prayed first all these things if you don't give god the first there's going to be a little bit of hindrance all throughout the day you miss one day you might get a bad habit miss the second day you've got to redeem the time you've got to put christ first he said put me first amen and then everything else all the other land will be added but first conquer the land of communing with me first amen be faithful with your time focus in your life right and then god will add everything else another example jesus said well done good and faithful servant thou hast been faithful over a few things i'll make the ruler over many things so this person died because this is this represents jesus at the judgment throne right when we're all given rewards the judgment seat of christ some sometime around the marriage supper the lamb so this jesus only let this servant have a lit a few things on the earth oh so god didn't increase him and if he was faithful god would always make his church bigger and bigger and bigger not according to jesus that's that's a denominational thought oh if you're a good preacher your church is going to grow show me that in brother brahms ministry show me that in paul's ministry it's not there paul said they have all of asia's rejecting me i only got one coat left amen right at the end of jesus life the 70 had left him right yeah the 70 preachers that left him you only had 11 or 12 left well one of them was the devil right you just show you show me these things in the word of god it's very hard but that's the denominational spirit that's come upon the people but that's okay i don't want to be organized by man i want to be organized by the holy ghost amen jesus said if you're faithful with little i'll make you ruler over much see so it's possess your land first in other words brother amen be faithful that music gift and i'll reward you later now maybe in this life but maybe not maybe just in the next life right and i can name each of your gifts i see your prayer of faith and your songs singing and everything like that i go to each and every person witnessing uh boldness for witnessing all these things you can show with each and every person be faithful with the little things first and conquer that land first and then your feet will take more steps amen hallelujah if god wants you to take more he'll give you more so there's two examples be conquer your land first then go get other people's land don't make excuses well it's too hard to talk to my husband well it's too hard to talk to my wife it's too hard to train my children it's too hard to turn off the phone the first thing in the morning just get up just get an old-fashioned alarm clock just leave your phone off just try to conquer that one morning right and then the next morning it's easier right you it's your land right you've got to conquer it god's not looking for anybody else to do it god wants you to do it that's why i gave it to you hallelujah number 17-18 joshua reminds manasseh of their greatness and power hallelujah they say i'm so great i need more land joshua says you are great that that was there's some truth to that but you can't brag with that he says thou art a great people and you have great power he said thou shalt not have one lie only but look what he says but the mountain shall be dying so the lot they always wanted brother william was theirs the whole time hallelujah in other words the victories you wanted all this time they're already laying right there in your lap [Music] what you were longing for all these things they're not out there they're right here praise god he says yes i'm going to give you another lot it's a lot that you've been unfaithful with amen hallelujah church amen see when god gives you a new life if god gives you new strength or new power it's to possess what already belongs to you amen be faithful with your land you have now and then see if god wants to give you more but look at joshua he says you you're great you have power you'll have more than one lot but it's your mountain lot you got to get for it is wood and thou shalt cut it down and the outgoings of it shall be thine for thou shalt look he's prophesied you will drive out the canaanites though they have iron chairs and though they be strong these things you worried about they won't hinder you amen can i say it church this morning your fears and worries will not stop you amen i don't know you will conquer you will overcome those obstacles that look so great they will fall in jesus name it's the same result as the laws of jericho just a different obstacle praise god they both fall they're both destroyed and you're the conqueror amen hallelujah thank you jesus that was joshua then joshua says amen that's the end of the chapter no more conversation about that he's like you couldn't trick me you little you the devil not them but the spiritual wickedness in high places i imagine with amen he had the priest right there with the urine thumb and right there on his chest what did you say that again mr manasseh said say that again what you you can't defeat the chairs let me see if that flash is on the word of god okay let's ask the priest priests they can't they can't defeat the chariots of wood i'm sure the chariots of iron or wood it doesn't flash oh well let me ask the priests again priests can they defeat any man that stands before them even giants and all the lights start flashing it's like a it's like an array of light just shining all over and joshua said see the word says it the prophet says it the word the prophet or one you will overcome amen because the word said so the european says so this doesn't lie this flashes with the word of god amen the light of god flashes from the pages of the bible that we're more than conquerors amen you just aren't going to conquer you're more than a conqueror you're not just going to defeat the chairs then you're going to cut down the wood praise god amen that's how we are at church we're not going to get a couple victories we're going to get the full victory the full inheritance amen hallelujah i told you i was ready to preach this morning i was like man i've been waiting to preach this about three months i started this in february some of these thoughts i heard way back then i'm like wow i can't wait to preach that well here's my i can't wait to preach a moment right here i i'm walking in that dream oh here i am right now now i preach this on wednesday church this is brazil so i'm not making any political boundaries i'm not gerrymandering this okay i don't even remember what that means but i know it deals with the boundaries but see i put in my book it's in chapter 11 in my book you have to have the perfect will of god for these five areas if not you'll feel like your life hasn't attained what it's supposed to attain everybody has relationships now paul like i should go with paul pogba maybe just got a quick victory like like jericho or something like that but then vocation he had to be a tet maker he had any other any other temptations maybe to go sell purple like lydia or you know i'm just making that up you know there's any temptation he had to kind of cast down i just got to make tense i just got to be content making tense and then location where should i live where do i need to go well thank god the holy spirit led him to all his missionary trips and kept saying but you're you're destined for rome no matter where he traveled the holy ghost said i'm you're going to rome but praise god i'm going to rome the holy ghost said again oh you're going to rome hallelujah thank god i know i'm on the right track praise god everywhere i'm going i know i'm going to live at least so i get to rome hallelujah he had to be patient he had to believe the word of god and they had ministries right he had all these ministries that he was doing bible writing praise god his bible riding it was all the needs of the saints came upon him daily he said right and then gifts he had all the five preaching gifts i proved that last sunday through all this remember that wednesday night proved it and he i imagine he had all nine gifts of the holy ghost too we can probably prove eight of those by the bible but i never saw him interpret an unknown tongue that'll be the only one i haven't seen paul do but church now let's wipe away paul here now let's put you in here you've got to by the holy ghost conquer your relationships that's just like this text right a pastor has to conquer his home first before it can move on to the church it's interesting i put in that order that was all god because i wasn't thinking about that when i did this you've got to conquer your home life first that's your jericho amen hallelujah that's your jericho conquer yourself first amen if you can't conquer yourself you ain't going to help anybody else you've got to conquer your sin nature then you can care about other people amen and then you can help them praise god conquer your own home and yourself first take that land and then every footstep where you go that's your possession amen then you can walk into church and say praise the lord god's gonna show me my ministries for my life i've conquered my home i got the victory at the house hallelujah i'm living living in the word of god with confidence amen lord show me where i'm supposed to live show location show me my home church right right you can say that too your location show my vocation what job should i have lord where do you want me to work i'll be happy to work there i want to be a real light for you jesus help me to get the victory on that one and then relationships oh yeah i put that one at the bottom and yeah gifts lord show me the gifts in my life remember we never put gifts above the giver we got to make sure we got the holy ghost first but then there's a time in your life where you have to focus on the gifts but you're following charity into there amen so see when you take this land you're only following the pillar of fires leading you in there amen follow charity and desire gifts amen so in other words the pillar of fire the love of god will lead you to know your nine gifts of the holy ghost hallelujah that's nothing but the truth because that's the word of god i challenge anybody amen to show me any different the word of god it says follow charity and desire the gifts of the holy ghost so if you're born again you will desire those gifts so i'll see if i get any takers for my challenge i'm not saying here i'm saying maybe up there on the live stream the archives like i got a man this week from africa he said he said i watched your video on joseph brandon he said you're being so carnal talking about 28 squirrels i said roll back i just was i just got done praying to read my bible i felt i was under the holy spirit i said let me correct you you're wrong you're the one being carnal i said i was showing in the video how carnal the tape people are they say every word is thus saith the lord and brother brahm said may joseph have double times double what's what's 2 times 2 4. he said may he have double times double everything that i have everything i've done well that means he's got what's seven times four if he spoke seven squirrels then he have to do 28. if he went around the world seven times he's got to do double times double everything that's the word brother and said everything and i said you're the one being carnal and in his comment he said he said well he said may god help us to know the truth somehow i said dirty amen thus ephesians chapter 4 these things fire me up so i'm sorry sometimes i got the whistle a little bit whoo fire me up god don't need to tell us nothing he already talks in the word of god amen regarding the subject you don't need to tell us anything else because god he gave it to us in the word now god can tell his prophecy you understand what i'm saying but relating to that topic god don't need to say he's already said it amen and thank god the prophet the broad and the priesthood will all be saying the same thing and it's already wrote in the bible amen ah hallelujah thank god amen hallelujah and he wrote me back the next day and said you're right i am being carnal i said hallelujah i knew i was under the anointing that day i usually don't call people cardinal i'm usually not a name caller but that time i it must have been the holy spirit discerning it chapter 18. see church this is the time of season we're under we're under the time of season where the message is getting attacked from inside before it was outside right and that's why they had to say brother is the prophet brother but now we got to say brother is not god right i mean you got to say brother not every word he says infallible now a prophet is only infallible with thus saith the lord we got to get on that praise god that's what we're battling now and that's what i've been battling so i'm just showing you some of my battles as i uh possess my land here my ministries i'm just sharing with you some of the battles i've had over the week in my ministry and over there you should have saw it came up against these giants out of here through the internet now sometimes it's face to face right sometimes it's face to face sometimes over the phone sometimes it's over a zoom call but that's still a battle are you going to stand or are you going to cower to the devil we're going to stand because no man will stand before me brother william all the days of my life are they as long as i keep those three steps humble myself remember and keep word of god it was worked for these 15 years so that means it's going to work for the next 15 if the lord tarries chapter 18. here's the outline oh i didn't do the outline okay you don't have to worry about that the outline is verse one is the tabernacle set up in shiloh and then verses two through the end is joshua saying he's he's rebuking them why haven't you possessed the land yet and then he sends out men to investigate come back in and then he gives a lot to benjamin that's that's chapter 18. hopefully i can finish that here pretty soon i'm not going to tell you the time there i'm just going to see how it goes usually i say the time and then i go too long you know uh chapter 18 verse one and the whole congregation of the children of israel assembled together at shiloh and set up the tabernacle of the congregation there and the land was subdued before them yeah we already know right we already know some of the canines were still there but they were under tribute right they weren't there there's no more battles they were just under taxes or slavery was another one they did slavery right remember the give me nights they were slaves cut the wood cut the wood get the water for the house of god they're slaves but see they still have so they have to understand that statement the land is subdued well they're not fighting against them so so much they're under control so here in verse 1 they set up shiloh in 1444 bc in the very center of the land shiloh means place of rest uh hallelujah amen where's god's art gonna rest church in your soul in shiloh amen your soul is the shadow that god wants to rest in amen hallelujah praise god jesus said i've come to you to give you rest to your souls amen oh hallelujah i come to give you my spirit in your shiloh i've come to fill your empty place with my spirit now this is interesting shiloh is part of ephraim's inheritance which was joshua's tribe right shiloh was close to the ark's future home jerusalem which david established about 402 years later and now notice here's the lesson you get church the now notice where joshua places it it's in the land of the prophet right in the very center of the land and that means the word of god from the prophet must be always placed at the center of our lives hallelujah so there's the arrow pointing to shiloh and i'm going to zoom in so don't strain your eyes i'll zoom in so there's shiloh and there's jerusalem with the two black arrows can i see that so the holy spirit said i'm placing it in shiloh until i get a man after my own heart then when i get a man after my own heart i'm going to set up the ark where it really needs to go jerusalem the home of melchizedek the high priest heaven's priest amen hallelujah i'm just going to do it i'm just going to leave it there until i get that man after my own heart he's going to just be a pre-figure to my son jesus amen oh and then when the word comes in he's going to dance with all his might he's going to shout and scream and praise the lord he's going to give god all the glory with all of his heart because the word is in his home amen amen [Applause] hallelujah that's what god wants god wants somebody appreciating when the ark comes into your house amen hallelujah amen how hallelujah and davidson if you don't like that wait till you see tomorrow if you didn't like me dance when brother diggs is here wait till next time he comes back hallelujah thank god amen jesus loves freedom amen he loves people that have a heart for the word and i've been to churches where you can't even clap so i want to enjoy my freedom here praise god i just oh thank you lord i just want to obey my freedom here because the spirit of the lord is here amen we know it's not there praise god hallelujah verses three to six joshua lays out another review look at this guy he's rebuking people all the time he just got done rebuking the manasseh now he's rebuking the seven other tribes that's just like the prophet right he's always rebuking everybody rebuking billy graham rebuking oral roberts david dupless duplicitous marilyn monroe jackie kennedy hallelujah we could keep going on and on all the people that rebuke that's what the holy spirit does to bring correction and if you're a child of god you'll say i love that guy that's why i don't care if people leave if i if i if i rebuke them it was the holy spirit i don't care if they leave i just prove they're not a child of god yeah it hurts to see people go but it hurts more if i disobey the holy spirit and tell a lie and compromise on god's word i'd rather i'd rather make sure i treat jesus the right way i want to kiss his feet praise god kiss the son lest he be angry i don't want to cater to church members right we don't want to cater to church members and kiss their feet and keep coming back and keep coming back that's fine we want you to come back if you're feeding on the word of god if you're obeying the holy spirit but we want you to obey the holy spirit praise god we're here to please christ paul said if i'm a servant of man i can't be the servant of christ amen i'm not really a servant of man i'm a servant of christ hallelujah amen thank the lord so he says you know i'll send three from each of the seven tribes 21 21 21 was how many days it took for daniel to get that revelation 21. the answer came after 21. the answer for them came after 21 spies came back just a little bit of throw that in there he said go through the land describe it for me write it in a book so i can i can understand these these uh the land for the seven churches i mean seven tribes sorry did you catch that lord church write it in a book so i can understand how we can place these seven tribes there's seven tribes that don't have a place yet write in a book and tell me describe these seven different lands that way i can give to each each tribe their possession i can give them their inheritance well that sounds familiar writing a description of seven different locations in a book hmm maybe ephesus smyrna pergamos thyrotira sardis philadelphia and maybe laodicea maybe it fits sure take that if the shoe fits where praise god amen this was a type before the prophet dies he has to finish placing the seven final tribes in a book before he goes off the scene he dies at chapter 24 which we're almost there before he dies god has to have him place the seven last remaining tribes into their perfect conditions and it's got to be written in a book remember brother simon freesis years ago verse 3 and joshua said the children of israel how long [Music] you look another rebuke how long you relax you seven tribes how long are you going to be idle how long are you going to be disheartened to go to possess the land which the lord your god of the fathers hath given you it's already been seven years how long is how many more how many how many more years do you need right how many more years you need to get rid of uh those cigarettes right how many more years you need to get rid of that that alcohol or that lying spirit or how about that root of bitterness how many more years do you really get rid of that how long is it going to take for you to possess your home praise god how long is it going to take for you to really understand what god's called you do in your life amen and we're not told the reason why right we're not told why but he rebukes them for their relaxed attitude that ought to bring a little remembrance to your minds in the church age book brother branham says ephesus means aimed at and relaxed isn't that interesting now if you look in the hebrew it actually means the the word actually means permitted ephesus means permitted which is the same as aimed at right it's permitted it's aimed at and then larkin adds the synonymous phrase to relax see they permitted it or they're relaxing on it and this matches jesus's main concern for the first church age right this age started in great zeal but decades later they left their first love ah that's what we got right here right that's what he had to rebuke manasseh on how come you've left your first love and you can't have enough faith to defeat the chairs of iron we've been defeating giants and kings and nations and people all these years and where has your first love gone our church where is our first love gone for the word of god if we're there we might we might not be there you might have your first love right now i feel like i got it right now praise god but you know everybody's different you know y'all go through times and seasons other times it might not feel like that but see joshua catches that at a time where they left their first love of really believing the promises of god now it's partly my job to preach that to you it's also the evangelist jobs which thank god for brother diggs and all the evangelists that we have come in here they're supposed to stir us up and they stir me up they stir all of us up but all of us have a duty to get back to our first love if we've lost the love of praying and fellowshipping with god and hearing the word of god and reading the word if we've lost the love of that we've got to repent and go back and get it go back and get the land that you lost praise god go back and get it somebody's squatting on your land and the church said go back and get it that's what they had to do they had to go back and get their first love because they lost that zeal they lost that i want to fight i want to overcome i want to overcome in church we all go through it let's let's not kid ourselves here everybody needs this message this morning because all of you have been in the message for a while now none of that none of you are really you know uh just first time holy ghost and every every sermon you want to stand up and shout and praise god like you did at the beginning praise god we've all got to get back to that we've all got to get back to our first love and be ready to conquer we in other words we can't be weary in well-doing we've got to get our first love back and say if i drove them out before by god's help i'll drive them out again amen thank god amen and i wrote about this in my book on pages 42 i'm sorry 492 493 and yes i used brother simon's name because it came fresh from him william branham's god-ordained church ages book was foretold in joshua number joshua chapters 18 19. note the sermons were preached though in december january 1661 and the book version came out december 1965 i'm thankful the lord revealed the foretelling of the exposition book in joshua 18 1890 to my brother simon a faithful bible teacher a missionary so joshua 18 1-10 finds the promised land subdued before israel and joshua still needs seven tribes to possess their land inheritance he sends out men to the land to explore it and bring it back its descriptions to joshua so he can divide it the men come back with the book describing the lands cities and cities and divide them up into seven parts lots before the lord and assigns the seven lot plots to the seven tribes this assignment had to take place before the prophet joshua's death two applications are apparent first jesus joshua he placed his foreign overcomers in the church ages of his own choosing see josh had to choose where to place him so did jesus have to place them in the right land oh look where he placed you brother amen and laodicea amen he didn't place you in fire tear where there's no bible he didn't place you there now they had overcomers then but he placed you church and i in the spot where all the mysteries of god are finished amen amen i don't know where you could be hot you don't have to be lukewarm or cold you can burn with the boiling fervor of god almighty amen that's where he placed your brother he didn't put you in in smyrna where they started dying they made the three gods in smyrna ephesus submerged second church age did you catch that only the first and last ages had the one god paul and us amen paul and brother we're the only ones that know god as one person amen thank god amen and that's where he wanted to place you brother bank jesus says joshua place bang in the laocian church age he could have placed him in luther's age and bang you might have sat there you might you might have been luther's servant like you're my friend and my helper bang might have knocked on the door and said uh pastor uh luther would you like another beer when he said he asked me but jesse is there anything i do to help at the church right i mean he could have been placed there but jesus would have brother value in this age amen he wanted me in this age where i we focus on the wine of the holy ghost amen give me another drink of that spiritual wine amen yes give me another drink of the new one the baptism of the holy ghost hallelujah aren't you glad i'm glad brother bang god didn't place me in that age martin luther said i got the quote in the book i put in there i said martin luther said i'd be happy if 10 of my converts stayed right 10 percent they had people flocking in their services but then church after a few years they all flocked out proves they weren't doves because doves are homing birds amen when you get the holy ghost you find your home and even if you leave you know how to get back amen back to this place the house of god where the word of god is being preached hallelujah they must have been crows that flew in like the pastor last week his last name was crow you remember that brother not nothing on his name but he he didn't want nothing about it he want nothing about the message i texted myself and her back left in my car and everything like that isn't that interesting but we're homing pigeons brother we know where our home is despite all the trials and all the storms of life may knock you off course somehow god directs you back home and you find it you fly in the church and you get fed and you get healed and you can fly out saying holy holy holy it's the lord oh my god amen oh hallelujah thank the lord church you're doves not crows glory see the seven part book symbolizes g listen jesus's seven letters in revelation so there's two types here you can either use revelation two and three this can be the type or if maokai would go get me the church age book the church age book could be the type could you get it thank you so this is the time jesus as joshua placing all of us in that last revelation chapter 3 14 to 22. i think i'll place sister naomi there i think i'll put sister beatrice there in that that last church age joshua looked at it and he said i'm going to place them right there in that last age where they can be hot on fire for the holy ghost thank you sir love you buddy so that's one application how many want to be hot and execute hot fervent works for the lord you have to zealously repent remember simon read that quote if denominations have to zealously repent what about us and so if you want to re if you want a revival in your in your mind you've got to repent the same way that you did the beginning praise god yes we have to so the second application is brother branham as joshua the seven part book represents his seven sermons on the church ages having received the revelation of the seven cities the seven church ages brother ram could place the believers of church history in their matching respective ages and write his exposition their historical placement had to come while the prophet was yet alive as his book was published just a few weeks before he went home to be with the lord and joshua finishes his book a few chapters before he goes home to me with the lord and the church said hallelujah so brother and got back uh got back the word and he was in a place oh see yeah luther was in the sardis age because they had a name but they were dead hallelujah he said i'll place luther uh and i'm sorry i placed wesley in the open door because it was the greatest age of missionary open door work in the history of the world amen he could place it because he heard the descriptions and you know just remember remember he said how he figured out the names of the or who the messengers were he said i looked at all the descriptions of their life and which one matched paul the most hey amen like like joshua oh which of these lands matches dan the most which of these lands hallelujah matches zebulun the most and i'll place them right where they need to go amen and brother into the same way i see elijah in that seven church age because he's restoring all things just like jesus said i'm placing him there and that's last in seven city praise god that's where i'm placing him and then he said it's thus saith the lord amen hallelujah praise god i'm about as free as a dove today praise god thank the lord i didn't mean to throw that forgive me let me try it again okay thank you you know how sometimes i get a little bit of to zealous forgive me lord i should throw down my phone like that's something i should turn out forgive me verses 7-10 joshua 18 ten i i don't think we have time to read it so again joshua says levi gets no portion because god is their portion i like that song you were singing brother keep working on that one buddy he was singing this song called my portion it's one of my favorite songs right now and then joshua says so levi doesn't get any the two and half tribes though they're gonna get their land on the east of jordan so that's stuff we already knew but then in verses 10 to 7 to 10 the men rise up they go write the book they bring it back to joshua and he cast lots before the lord he's got the urem there and lord lord jesus lord god where do you want uh uh where where do you where do you want martin to go saint mark where do you want martin to go and the lord jesus chose him i want martin in the pergamone church agent lord jesus where do you want i iranius iranis he's the second church he's messenger place them right there how many places all the church age messages right exactly where they need to go and joshua divides the seven parts out to the people now look at this church at the end of the chapter benjamin receives the first inheritance of the last seven now some of you that really love the bible might want to see this this is benjamin's area very small benjamin was the least of the tribes right but paul was a benjamite so was saul so see sometimes great things can come out of little people that i'll encourage you in a small church right i had a couple brothers this week just text me and tell me you have this you have the sweetest people that we know in the message yeah so be encouraged praise god i'm sorry i just had one this week but i've had people in the past tell me that you've got some of the sweetest people in the church you just got gems in there that's true thank god see because that's because the gems cutting you right you're just a part of that same gen the gem rather right because that's what it takes it takes a diamond to cut a diamond is that right right so see the diamond christ is cutting you he's cutting you into diamonds so you shine and show the glory of god right here in the church he's cutting you a little bit service after service keeps cutting you i can make this a little bit sharper i can cut off some of these rough edges amen so they can shine out there with their family and friends and co-workers that can shine the real reflection of christ amen benjamin's got this real small lot and it's really interesting it takes what was it it takes like 17 verses to describe this area right here can you imagine that like 17 verses this guy this little area but joshua does it because joshua knew exactly what god wanted i know exactly where these churches i know where they're going to start and i know when they're going to end i hear you praise god i know where these borders start and i know where they end praise god amen [Music] hallelujah so this sermon is about three years in the making since simon preached that message here this sermon today is about three years the making and probably next sunday too now let's look at this just briefly i'll just get started on this and i'll try to i've already been preaching over an hour so let me try to usually give me an hour and a half and everybody's everybody's pretty good with hour and a half you know by god's grace and i'm pretty good with hour and a half too so so let's look at the fulfillment of jacob and moses's prophecies of the 12 tribes now what now just a note here before we start brother branham if you listen to him he talks about these fulfilled prophecies at least six times twice in 1960 twice in 1961 once in 63 164. now let's read them and show how we must look in the bible to best understand this bible said joshua and caleb they were going on to the promise they moved over the land they took the land settled down the land as a possession we never stop at justification same vacation let's go on to the baptism of the holy ghost let's not stop at believing on the lord jesus being baptized let's not stop because he cleaned us up from a life of sin but now we press on into the position to a promise of the baptism of the holy ghost and then he quotes acts 2 38 39. so brother man switching back from natural to spiritual right natural to spiritual so ephesus here sets us like joshua positionally you notice joshua after crossing the land taking land he divided up the land from here manasseh here dad here benjamin here he divided the land and notice oh this burns in our hearts each one of those hebrew mothers giving birth to those children she spoke the very place in her labor pains where they would be positioned in the promised land oh it's a great study if we could only go into details which would take hours after hours someday when we get our church fixed i just like to come and take a solid month or two and i've been preaching on this for february march april may june july august september i've been preaching on joshua for eight months and i'm still just scratching the surface i'm sure there's so many things going over my head aren't you glad what we have received from god amen someday we get okay watch when they each one of those mothers when she called out ephraim when she was in labor but positionally placed them where his feet were setting in the oil just exactly every one of them where they were at and joshua not knowing this but by inspiration led to the holy spirit after being in the promised land give each man his promise exactly what the holy spirit promised through the birth back there how that god is set in the church through labor pains oh they get tremendous now he goes back to spiritual the women natural birth pains now he goes to spiritual birth pains oh they get tremendous sometimes when a church is groaning under the persecution of the outside world so see all these vaccine mandates bang they're all bringing out more prayers in us they're birth pains hallelujah the threat of them canceling us and shutting our doors and no more free speech and no more freedom uh gun rights and all these things all these things are persecutions that are driving us closer to god all the time believing on the lord jesus the promise of the holy ghost is just as real to us as it was at pentecost how they groan and cry under the labor pains but when they're born and positionally born in the kingdom of god the holy ghost has set in the church some apostles prophets teachers pastors evangelists then he's give into their speaking with tongues interpretation tongues knowledge he quotes the the five gifts and the nine gifts where the church is now this is my purpose of doing this the church is always trying to take somebody else's corner now isn't that just like manasseh manasseh said give me somebody else's corner josh says i'm going to give you a corner your corner but brother adam said this is the lesson we can get from joshua don't try to be other people something somebody else's be what god made you praise god hallelujah don't do that you can never raise corn in ephraim's corner if you're manasseh you've got to take your place in christ positionally take it oh it gets deep and rich when we get in here it's been pretty deep and rich these last eight months or so praise god how god puts one in the church to speak with tongues another now we've been taught many times we often speak in tongues that's wrong we all got to do it no we don't they didn't all do one thing each one was the land was provided and divvied up by inspiration i could take the scriptures and show it to you exactly that he put them in the place where they were supposed to be positionally how that the two half tribes was to stay across the river how that their mothers cried that in their birth and how that each place was supposed to be and now after you are in that don't mean you're out free from war like i heard a preacher say last week it was wrong he said you don't have to fight for anything god just gives it to you and i thought what about this quote but you don't you don't have to fight when you're out there so much right like just like justification or saying vacation right the the the bread just falls from heaven to you you're babied you just gotta go outside your tent you just gotta squeeze outside your tent and grab something and come back in that's what a baby has to do right but a real man's got to go plant and dig and pray for rain and weed and water and plant some more praise god and keep trusting god and then the blessing comes amen after many months of labor praise god after many hard seasons then all the blessings and the real mature food comes amen that's what god wants you to be a real mature christian not a baby we got to baby them to come to church well if you come to church for six months or if you come to church for one year if you come to church for three years i'll do this for you that's a baby right you still have to fight for every inch of ground you stand on so see canaan did not represent the great heaven because it's war and troubles and killings and fightings but it did represent this it must be a perfect vlog in other words we must remain under the blood lord jesus forgive me for my sins today and you better say the same thing tomorrow lord jesus on monday forgive me my failures on monday then it's a perfect walk yes because i'm walking in the light as he is in the light and the blood of jesus cleanses me and you and i from all unrighteousness don't let that become tired to you if you love god you'll love that word amen that's my walk that's my perfect walk is john 1 verses 8 and 9 praise god that i confess my sins and i stay in the light as christ is in the light now i want to say this and church i'm always open to correction after searching scripture numerous times for over 15 years of my pastoring i cannot find the hebrew mothers prophesied of their son's positions in the land i only find jacob and moses doing the prophesyings so before we get real deep and rich in this next week i just want to start with this thought and then i'm going to close i'm going to start with a thought and then close starting close so remember when brother ram preached on uh the feast of the trumpets he made a mistake he said like the other day i got something mixed up i happened to hear it's it's caught right in here it's on the tape i'll probably hear from it when i was talking about the seven trumpets i said it was the seven trumpets okay so brother i was saying the feast of weeks uh uh brother i was saying this the feast of weeks pentecost was seven weeks after uh seven weeks out after the first fruits okay no i'm not now i'm getting mixed up i'm sorry uh there's a mix up there there's a mix-up oh no oh yeah brother ram said the seven trumpets the the trump the feast of trumpets was in the seventh month and brother adam said that type the seven church ages well that does it right because the feast of weeks types the seven church ages okay that's where it is that's where i got it mixed up and brother he corrects it you can listen to it he cracks it on the tape but at the end of this he said if you happen to catch it on your tape remember look in the bike so when you press play jeffersonville and all these churches when you press play you better have your bible handy there to make sure if you hear something and you don't remember it you better look in the bible right that's what they need to remember push play and open the bible and and push play and open the bible way right can i make a rhyme out of that push play and always obey and open up your bible something like that he said if ever you're not sure about something look in the bible praise god how do you believe that he makes a mistake about the seventh the seventh feast and says the type seven church ages it doesn't it doesn't it types god returning to israel and the prophets coming out and preaching to israel it doesn't type the seven church ages the feast of weeks types of seven church ages which brother ram says in the sermon he actually says it in the sermon too now let me explain let me give you two examples that i'm going to close genesis 40 ephraim genesis 41 verse 52 is the only recording of the birth of ephraim's birth from azinath because ephraim is joseph's son ephram and manasseh were joseph's two sons right ephraim was older manasseh was younger but then remember he the eat master got the blessing right through the cross that's that's a beautiful sermon right and now notice as an ass the bible never mentions that as an f mentions oil and the hebrew lexicon has no meaning for ephraim but it's likely related to her fruitfulness despite her afflictions because every name given by the mother was related to the circumstances they were going in at the time and i'm going to prove it to you okay now here's what brother said watch when they what this is brother adam's quote now i'm just showing you how this quote we need to look in the bible to make sure this quote is exactly right because i'm trying to i as i study this for 15 years i have church these are notes i've had since i started pastoring in 2006. i've had a question about this subject i've warned about this for 15 years but it's taken me 15 years to learn i've got to rightly divide every word of brother branham too and i don't care if people call me a hypocrite or anything like that i don't care what they call me you have to do it or else you're going to be an idolater you're going to worship brother branham i don't care what they say i don't care what anybody says all i care is what jesus says right amen i know that's rough but that's true so brother man said when ephraim's mom had him she cried out he's going to be placed in oil well that's not what happened in the bible as far as i know now it might have happened and it's not recorded in the bible but that's not in the bible here's the bible and joseph under joseph were born two sons before the years of famine which azanath the daughter of uh potiphara priests of on bear unto him and joseph called the name of the firstborn manasseh for god said he hath made me forget all my toil and all my father's house oh i'm sorry in this case azanath didn't even name the children joseph named him so that's a mistake i've got to fix see so brother ram said ephraim's mom asanath called out he's going to live in oil when he was born but that bible don't record that for god hath caused me to be fruitful in the land of my affliction so if manasseh if manasseh means here let me get to manasseh means causing to forget that's with the hebrew lexicon so joseph was saying look manasseh means he's made me forget all my father's house does that make sense joseph gave the meaning of manasseh based upon what he was going through at that time so when ephraim was born it must mean something like this fruitful in my affliction it must mean something like that because that's what the bible says here's a second example reuben brother ram said that reuben now brother let's let's read this brother man says i don't have it all wrote down here but let's say or let's pretend or let's presume reuben met sheep herder now some people brother william will die the death reuben means sheep herder brother graham said it the prophet said it it's absolutely true you're a heretic if you don't believe it you're a heretic if you don't take every word back to the word of god because you're an idolater you're the heretic like joshua said you you're so big and strong right put it back on him you're the heretic oh yeah look at this said e ferment cornraiser i just showed you ephraim don't don't even have a definition right now look he says reuben does not mean sheep herder although later he's connected to sheep we're going to preach this lord willing next week i'm going to show you all the 12 sons and all that jose all that jacob prophesied about them and moses and show them how some of them placed them in the land some of them didn't some of them just cursed their sons like reuben he was cursed some of them did get positionally placed in the land and got lots of blessings in the land like zebulun the holy ghost told zebulun right where he's going to live so see everything from brother bam we we respect it but we got to take it through the filter of god's word which is exactly what he taught us amen a thinking man's filter is the word of god amen and it produces a holy ghost filled man's taste amen just look in your bible right if there's any questions just look in your bible it's so simple remember i said if there's a mistake on the tape look in the bible but i've heard that i've heard brother and son say you don't even have to look in the bible you can just say amen to every word on tape that's a lie i challenge that by the word of god by the holy spirit that's a lie impossible every word must be taken back to the word of god amen amen and i stand here i'm still waiting these two years later brother amen i'm still waiting for the answers who's the real joseph billy paul are you i'm still waiting for the answers you know i guess i imagine i'll be keep waiting for a long time prior to the rapture i don't know i'm not sure if i get my answer there either but i already know the answer praise god the answer is joseph is the the promised joseph not billy paul is brother ram's opinion but they can't say that or else they're going to blast him somehow nonsense nonsense what dad doesn't want his children all to preach like i talk about malachi all the time preaching they might not be preachers no pressure son you got a real battle to overcome he's gonna possess the land praise god you know you just gotta live under things you know you gotta live i had to live under my dad he wasn't there much so he's gotta live under he's gotta overcome he can do it by the holy ghost but see brother ram says reuben means sheep herder it doesn't it means behold a son and there's the proof leah conceived now this is one where the mother did cry out but she didn't position replace him she just gave him a name she said she she called his name reuben for she said surely the lord had looked upon my affliction and now therefore my husband will love me and nothing to do with where reuben what he's going to he's going to have sheep or oil or corn it had nothing to do with that is it leo was saying remember the sermon uh leah loved the lord yeah you remember that one buddy that's a good one holy ghost gave us a good time that day it it wasn't leah it wasn't about where he's going it's about her it's about her i want to be loved by my husband right god saw me god saw me hurting through my pregnancy where my husband didn't love me and god gave me a son now my husband is going to love me did he not but not as far as we know he didn't he didn't it wasn't about sheep hurting it was about i wish my husband would love me so which one's right oh you blasphemer you better not say the tape was wrong but the bram said the tapes were wrong lebron said there's lots of things wrong on the tape he said i do that all the time now he said i'm such a dummy but he wasn't he was a smart man but he's just a tired man he makes mistakes he forgets he's a man like you he's a woman like you and the church said he was no dummy he was being humble but he said i make those kind of mistakes all the time he said seven hundred or seven thousand but there's gonna be seven hundred in the rapture of seven thousand which one is it is it the bible or your tape everybody said it's the bible praise god look in the bible amen let's all say look in the bible ready look in the bible let's say it again look in the bible let's say it three times ready look in the bible amen look in the bible don't be afraid you're supposed to listen to the tapes you're supposed to read the books i love reading the church book i love reading all these books i love listening to them but when it comes down to it you gotta look in the word amen those these false prophets are gonna deceive you because the word is the absolute not a man the word is the absolute jesus christ is the absolute amen amen hallelujah and i've been raised up to preach that by the way for such a time as this amen i hate it some of you you've been raised up to stand with it amen despite the reproach and the making fun and all the nonsense you've been raised to stand up for it praise god what does reuben mean does it mean sheep razor no but he was just remembering he said let's say he was just you just making just making a hypothetical situation it doesn't mean that it means behold a son now i hope you appreciate me for taking things back to the word of god if you leave because i preached that well bye see you later but if you but if you if you really love the word you should say amen i appreciate a preacher that will take it back to the word i appreciate a preacher that will actually study the bible because that's what paul said he said study yourself approved unto god give yourself to reading right and exhortation to save you and them that hear you that's right i'm trying to save your souls church praise god i'm trying to keep you away from this denominational beast system that they're all going to unite with i'm trying to save you and me from that and together we'll make it by the grace of god in closing this shows fear and idolatry among preachers and it's disguised like manasseh it's just disguised as respect and honor well i'm so great and powerful and i i just need more see just like that's a disguise they have this this this disguise that that can't even say something's wrong on the tapes you'd be surprised i've heard preachers preach this you're trying to correct god's prophet now that sounds good but that's a lie that's a lie right they i've heard maneuvers say that over the years like they're standing up for brother branham no they're just they're they're they're just admitting they haven't studied it praise god they're just admitting they haven't obeyed paul's commission to you go study you labor you're a workman laboring the doctrine of the word of god they're just admitting well i didn't study that one out so i'm just going to say what the tapes say well it's your job to study it out that's what you get paid the tithes for right that's what you get paid the offerings for evangelists right and teachers that's what you get paid for to go labor and study and get the truth and bring it to the people don't hide behind the lie conquer the land amen be a workman cut down those trees amen cut down the lies coming out of jeffersonville hallelujah cut down the lies coming out of these false fivefold sermons these return ministry people cut down those lies and possess the land amen work for it praise god give yourself holy to starting and preaching the word of god amen they exalt themselves oh who are you the correct brother or who are you to correct god's prophet but the fact is they're too scared and lazy to study the bible that's the fact brother william he's laughing because he knows it he's seen it preachers come and preach the same thing they already preached well how come you can't give us something new because they're not studying like they need to just press and play looking for a paycheck that's nothing but the truth jose knows what i'm talking about he's seen it too not thank god some of you haven't seen it but some of us have seen it church every single person outside of jesus christ needs corrected uh let's look in your bible can we can you look in your bible i'm just saying that you know like brother brahm said hebrews 12. does everybody need correction or or do prophets not need correction the only thing that doesn't need correction is thus saith the lord everything else we've got to be really careful with yes and i showed it to you a few months ago even the words right after thus saith the lord you've got to be careful with because brother brahm said if a woman cuts her hair she's dead that's thus saith the lord and then he says first corinthians 14. that's the wrong chapter hair is not in the 14th chapter of corinthians hair is in the 11th chapter and the church said amen i know you're getting quiet yeah i know you're getting tired too i'm trying to finish here but this is so good i just gotta just let me enjoy this moment i've been i've been dreaming about this moment for months by the way that's one preacher so hard oh my thank god hebrews 12. verse six i'm sorry verse five and you've you've forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as in the children my son despise not the chastening of the lord now that's actually whipping and spanking it's whipping nor faint when thou art rebuked of him see a real man don't a real man a woman of god they don't mind being rebuked as long as they're getting corrected the right way verse six for whom the lord loveth he chasteneth and scourgeth every son except prophets whom he receiveth wait did i did i read that right no i added the words and prophets he let me read it again and he scourges every son whom he receiveth everybody needs correction and if you endure chasing in verse 7 god dealt with you as sons for what son is he whom the father chasteneth not if not you're a bastard child let's stand to our feet as the musicians come let me read this church they say who are you god's prophet brother branham said his wife was his correction too so you're saying a preacher can't correct by the brahman only his wife can well that means sister media ought to take a text and preach if she can correct the prophet of god huh you see how ridiculous these people are they are so self-satisfying brother william they're so scared to study and they're scared to pray they're scared to look in the bible that'll be the best thing we do every day amen is look in the bible praise god instead of hiding behind what who are you to protect god's prophet i'm so holy i don't i don't got to read my bible i just got to press play what a liar that's your job you're neglecting your job you're supposed to read the bible hallelujah whom the lord loves he rebukes and chastens he chastens every son hallelujah every son he corrects them all because we all need to possess the land amen we all need to get back up after a ai defeat hallelujah and clear out any gold wedges in our lives right any silver coins in our lives and the church said any babylonian garment right i read that this morning that was my scripture reading this morning anything that we've kept in our house is not pure god's got to clean it out and then we're marching on the victory the only thing you don't need correction on is thus saith the lord and even on those brother bang people wonder the brown bear was thus saith the lord even then they can't understand those things but thank god for the holy ghost brother thank god now my wife she's my correction you know brethren what i'm talking about you know you brother bank you know about that but jose do you know about that but william do you know about that [Laughter] i know about it but johnny you know about that is your wife your correction me too i say the same yeah brother i was talking about with the brothers he's saying how their wife always corrects them when they make you know not always but you know there's times where brother man you know about that yeah i knew he'd say man yeah oh yeah we all make mistakes right as men like look at me i get zealous i get overzealous and i need my wife to be that whispering here jesse or darling can you can we talk about this so see see how absurd it is brother man's wife can correct him but nobody else well what is she the mother of god then was she like mary right you see how they you see the tape church is just another catholic church joseph is the pope this makes me to marry see don't need the fivefold don't need preachers just need to po po po nonsense you can stop the livestream have you stopped it already you can stop it now yeah brother do we do a correction i want to make a correction yes my wife corrects me amen i thank the lord for that praise god amen hallelujah sister amen
