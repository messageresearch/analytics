[0:09] everybody all right everyone's first
[0:10] service all right by god's grace i just
[0:12] wanted to
[0:13] bring a thought here and we're going to
[0:15] continue on that uh
[0:16] idea i guess
[0:19] this is through casey i have this i have
[0:21] a powerpoint setup i don't know if this
[0:23] is
[0:24] technically technical to
[0:26] certify the
[0:28] powerpoints
[0:32] so
[0:33] uh now i i did a follow-up point here
[0:35] because there's a lot of reading but i
[0:36] want to show you um
[0:42] let's just pinpoint where the problem is
[0:44] is what i like to just go right to the
[0:45] root of the problem you know
[0:47] some people are saying this and some
[0:49] people say that and
[0:51] all these sort of things i like just to
[0:52] hit it right
[0:54] you know okay i see this little plant on
[0:56] the yard there and okay it's got a
[0:58] flower here it's got this kind of but
[1:00] what does it look like in the room
[1:01] where's that where did that thing start
[1:02] at don't throw us i'm gonna
[1:04] uh examine that by god's grace tonight
[1:06] and i know
[1:08] from what i hear the
[1:10] young ones are ready for david to
[1:13] be played on the
[1:15] little big screen there and uh
[1:16] [Laughter]
[1:19] quite the quite the video and uh
[1:22] you guys just went and saw that right
[1:23] correct what yes i said there and
[1:28] i then took my wife for anniversary over
[1:30] there to see that that was really a
[1:31] phenomenal phenomenal show and uh
[1:35] man
[1:36] those things just make you want to be a
[1:37] christian i mean if you can't watch that
[1:47] you know i watched a video
[1:50] of this non-christian man and this
[1:53] non-christian man was making a video of
[1:55] him he wouldn't do like a response video
[1:57] or a reaction video to
[1:59] uh christian music
[2:01] about the modern christian music and he
[2:02] was
[2:04] played some certain song
[2:06] and he was really getting into it you
[2:08] know and he's like man this is a really
[2:09] good song he's like the ups and the
[2:10] downs and the this person holds this and
[2:13] that person holds that and uh but it
[2:15] moved him you know didn't bring the
[2:17] salvation
[2:18] no but it really it moved him and that's
[2:20] uh something that's uh aggro by the
[2:22] grace of god that the christian song
[2:24] could even
[2:25] uh
[2:26] do that maybe to heath and why would
[2:28] they want to listen to that you know
[2:29] that's not their nature that's not their
[2:31] uh desire so
[2:33] anyhow uh i guess we'll get in the word
[2:35] of god here um
[2:39] let's open our scriptures here to
[2:42] uh
[2:43] first corinthians 11. we're going to
[2:45] continue on the same thoughts here
[2:48] and uh
[2:50] we'll stand here for the reading that
[2:51] we're
[2:53] um
[2:56] i'm gonna get into some interesting
[2:57] things maybe i to me some of the things
[2:59] we're gonna hit tonight and
[3:01] uh i've listened to this there's a
[3:03] there's a
[3:05] book i've audio listened to and it's uh
[3:08] thoroughly amazing i mean i'm sure you
[3:10] guys all listen to it but we're going to
[3:11] touch about that tonight we're going to
[3:12] talk about this little book this little
[3:14] no-name book
[3:16] not a print on the front but inside
[3:19] there's some things here so
[3:21] first corinthians 11 verse 24
[3:25] and when he had given thanks he break
[3:27] and said take e this is my body which is
[3:30] broken for you with this duty in
[3:31] remembrance of me
[3:33] after the same manner also he took the
[3:34] cup when he had stopped saying that this
[3:37] cup in the is the new testament in my
[3:39] blood
[3:41] this do you do eat as often as you drink
[3:43] it in remembrance of me
[3:46] so this is some of the new testament
[3:47] things you know that we're
[3:48] required to do is that god said do this
[3:52] in remembrance of me
[3:55] amen
[3:57] he says for as often as you eat this
[3:59] bread
[4:00] and drink this cup yet you shoe the
[4:03] lord's death till he come
[4:07] wherefore
[4:09] whosoever shall eat this bread and drink
[4:11] this cup of the lord unworthily
[4:16] shall be guilty of the body and the
[4:18] blood of the lord
[4:20] but let a man examine himself and so let
[4:23] him eat of that bread and drink of that
[4:25] cup for he that eateth and drinketh
[4:27] unworthily
[4:30] eateth and drinketh damnation to himself
[4:33] not discerning
[4:34] the lord's body now what takes place if
[4:36] they take this
[4:40] unworthily for this cause many are sick
[4:44] are sorry are weak and sickly among you
[4:46] and many sleep
[4:48] for we would judge ourselves we should
[4:51] not be judged right that's right
[4:54] so now let's jump over here now to
[4:56] matthew 16
[4:57] and one through three
[4:59] and then we'll say a creator
[5:15] matthew 16 1
[5:17] the pharisees also with the sadducees
[5:19] came tempting and tempting desired him
[5:22] that he would shoot them a sign from
[5:23] heaven and he answered and said to him
[5:26] when is it evening you say it will be
[5:28] fair weather for the sky is red and in
[5:31] the morning will be foul weather today
[5:33] for the sky is red and lowering
[5:35] he says oh ye hypocrites you can discern
[5:38] the face of the sky
[5:40] but you cannot discern the sign
[5:43] of the time so say word prayer
[5:46] yes by god's grace
[5:48] heavenly father lord jesus so we love
[5:50] you lord we come humbly before you ask
[5:52] jesus and oh god may your perfect lord
[5:54] god will be done tonight rosberg uh
[5:57] stepping behind here over this little
[5:59] desk here god
[6:01] one day brother dave i believe built
[6:04] years and years ago yes sir and lord is
[6:08] still in service lord hallelujah that
[6:10] original move there god and
[6:13] oh we're so grateful lord for the
[6:14] standing god yes lord you know god we
[6:17] ask of mighty blessing upon us assembly

[6:29] want you to have we pray lord they find
[6:32] favor in your sight god lord yes you
[6:34] know i mean you show them continue with
[6:36] that escaped path god may never get dark
[6:38] and grow but you always be lit up
[6:39] already ready for that escape god
[6:42] we love you and bless this service god
[6:44] in the name jesus christ amen sir
[6:50] once again just
[6:51] uh honored to be here and
[6:54] um take every serious uh our service
[6:57] very serious i do um
[6:59] i just listened to the prophet of god
[7:01] said
[7:02] i don't know why i made this waste but
[7:04] when i go hunting i gotta hit that score
[7:05] right in the eyes he said all the other
[7:07] brothers they can just shoot
[7:09] on the side or take a leg off wounded
[7:12] you know or in the ear or something you
[7:14] know and it'd be they're good to go but
[7:16] the prophet god said it's got to hit
[7:18] exactly and he said that's his makeup
[7:20] now me
[7:24] i don't know anything much about guns
[7:25] i've shot quite a bit you know well not
[7:27] a lot but i've shot
[7:29] uh
[7:33] the one thing i'm very serious about in
[7:35] my occupation is the plumbing the can
[7:38] test
[7:39] if you're plumbing to hold you're in
[7:40] trouble
[7:41] if your system does not hold you or a
[7:43] major major trouble i try to stress that
[7:45] with the guys who try to plumb and i
[7:47] said you got to make sure everyone
[7:48] everyone every glue joint has to you've
[7:50] got to be perfect
[7:51] and lately in my business that i'm in
[7:54] they've been using me as the link
[7:55] detection guy i go there and find all
[7:56] the leaks
[7:58] yeah
[8:01] i don't understand that either
[8:04] anyhow so i do take we got to make sure
[8:07] the word of god holds
[8:10] it's got to run it's gotta
[8:12] it's gotta do yeah good
[8:15] hit every time you gotta prove all
[8:17] things that's a very serious thing
[8:18] you've got to prove all things i can go
[8:19] up here and just say whatever i think i
[8:21] say but is it doctrine and the doctrine
[8:23] takes what proof doctor takes uh
[8:25] evidence to prove a doctrine
[8:28] and doctrine takes what not my thoughts
[8:30] or words coming out of my mouth what i
[8:32] think but it takes the word of god to
[8:33] prove doctrine hallelujah so we want to
[8:36] always stick with that as our
[8:38] our
[8:39] our aim
[8:40] with our aim and with our uh we want to
[8:42] strike that every time is to prove all
[8:44] things so hallelujah uh so tonight i
[8:47] want to teach on
[8:48] discerning the sign of the times and the
[8:51] saints of god we and you all know this
[8:53] i'm sure every minister behind the
[8:55] public gets gets up here before
[8:57] they get into their topic and just talk
[8:59] about world things and we're right there
[9:02] this thing is just
[9:05] uh
[9:07] we're very very close
[9:08] we know
[9:09] everything is rattling it seems like as
[9:12] far as my trade that things are slowing
[9:14] down a little bit one company has laid
[9:15] off a very large number of
[9:18] uh people uh so it looks like things may
[9:20] be slowing down
[9:22] i you know in my little tiny life here
[9:26] the 80s were rough 81 82 there was a
[9:28] nice recession
[9:30] that's when our father got laid off from
[9:32] gm okay i
[9:34] believe of course uh i come into trades
[9:37] around 2001 2002 things were recession
[9:40] there as well
[9:41] laid off a year and a half for the first
[9:43] three years of my apprenticeship that
[9:44] was kind of rough
[9:46] and then 2008 a little recession and now
[9:48] um
[9:50] we know
[9:52] they come and go and they're all
[9:53] designed everything's for purpose god
[9:56] has allowed everything for you he said
[9:58] everything would take place before it
[10:00] did and it's coming to pass
[10:02] brother bible study other dice and
[10:03] brother i do bible study on prophecy
[10:05] it's a prophecy just read revelation 17.
[10:09] everything that jesus said in revelation
[10:11] 17 has come to pass everything in in the
[10:14] church ages chapter 1 2 has come to pass
[10:17] i mean it's all the whole thing's
[10:18] prophetic there i mean you can just look
[10:20] at the histories look at uh the natural
[10:22] things look at geography look at the the
[10:24] the statistics i mean everything is
[10:26] coming to pass
[10:29] to me that's a
[10:31] a witness that the lord has left us now
[10:33] amen um as far as discerning the sign of
[10:36] the times
[10:38] uh if there is an age
[10:41] literally an age of insanity where is
[10:43] but the bible said what they'd be
[10:46] wretched poor blind naked and miserable
[10:48] and won't even know it
[10:51] and the prophet god said well how in the
[10:52] world can you be poor blind naked and
[10:54] miserable and not know it you'd have to
[10:57] be
[10:57] completely out of your mind okay that's
[11:00] right completely and we know the profit
[11:02] of god one intention just showed how a
[11:05] lot of that has to do with the food
[11:07] the food you you you bring these hybrid
[11:09] seeds you start planting this hybrid
[11:11] fruit seeds that produces hybrid fruits
[11:14] and hybrid vegetables which have what
[11:16] little or no
[11:18] vitamin content
[11:21] any of those things that are essential
[11:23] for life for growing up strong and tall
[11:25] and big and all those sort of things
[11:26] which i i missed the big part into all
[11:28] the parts but uh
[11:30] for what little body i mean he we did
[11:32] okay by god's grace uh as far as healthy
[11:35] i found some i had some issues here uh
[11:37] recently but we're getting past those
[11:39] and looking and uh i've always kind of
[11:41] one of those things and here we found
[11:42] out that it was yes so
[11:44] uh now in second peter i want to get
[11:46] into this here by god's grace
[11:48] i don't hold you too late but i want to
[11:50] go now we have a lot of reading here
[11:51] coming up because
[11:53] i want you to see what was written
[11:56] amen everything you're seeing and
[11:59] hearing about
[12:01] comes from somewhere
[12:04] everything you're seeing
[12:06] and you're just like
[12:08] how in the world
[12:12] can they believe that
[12:13] [Music]
[12:15] right brother i mean i mean
[12:16] in america it's kind of like a we have
[12:18] that that spirit of joking right flat
[12:21] frolic
[12:22] and and and just cutting up and those
[12:23] sort of things and now america's i'm
[12:25] sure the world is too the world they
[12:27] make fun of their leaders and
[12:28] politicians
[12:30] and uh
[12:32] they'll have videos where a certain
[12:34] politician from new york is saying some
[12:36] things are just
[12:38] the illegals have rights
[12:41] and there's the guy who actually deals
[12:42] with the borders that
[12:44] if they're illegal they have no rights
[12:46] and yet the lady continues on and on and
[12:48] on and the guy's just going
[12:52] can't believe what he's hearing right
[12:54] right complete
[12:56] and utter insanity that's right
[13:00] now whether it's complete acting
[13:02] or just the ability to even think
[13:05] clearly is gone
[13:08] absolutely no ability to put to discern
[13:11] right from wrong
[13:14] whether through training or
[13:16] education
[13:19] however
[13:21] these people are going on to a level of
[13:24] insanity and they're saying bless you
[13:27] bless you and they're going to such a a
[13:30] way of insanity
[13:33] that you literally are left speechless
[13:35] the majority time in your sight
[13:39] you know you know how i explain a lot of
[13:41] things at work i just said hey so
[13:45] and people complain about the government
[13:46] they'll complain about this and that
[13:48] decision and this law and this i said
[13:49] let me tell you something you and me are
[13:51] on this job right and i go yeah and i go
[13:53] we're going to work together right he
[13:54] goes yeah he goes why because we want to
[13:55] finish the job we want to do a good job
[13:58] and i said look around there's like 100
[13:59] people on this job site
[14:01] and we all have a common goal and we are
[14:03] going to accomplish this goal and i said
[14:06] now we as men can do this because that's
[14:09] what we do this is what we're paid to do
[14:11] we can do it because we have the ability
[14:12] to do this and we'll work together and
[14:14] it'll get done and yet now our
[14:16] government cannot figure out how to do
[14:18] that between two parties
[14:20] right democratic republic right
[14:22] now on a job site you have roofers you
[14:25] got framers you got concrete guys you
[14:27] got sparkies electricians and you got
[14:29] tight fighters and plumbers
[14:31] uh you got uh ground guys you've got
[14:34] site guys you got you got over probably
[14:36] 40 different kind of trades and yet
[14:39] they're able to work together
[14:41] right make a common good half that's
[14:43] right brother right
[14:46] it just doesn't make sense
[14:48] right
[14:49] now let's continue on here now in second
[14:51] peter 2 and 18 he says for when they
[14:54] speak great swelling words of vanity
[14:55] they allure through the lusts of the
[14:57] flesh through much wontonness those who
[15:00] are clean escaped from them
[15:02] who clean escape from them who live in
[15:05] air while they promise them liberty they
[15:08] themselves are the servants of
[15:09] corruption
[15:11] for of whom a man is overcome the same
[15:13] as he brought into bondage that's very
[15:15] very important
[15:16] if someone overcomes you then now you
[15:18] are under them and they control you
[15:21] that's right sure absolutely
[15:24] for if after they
[15:26] have escaped the pollutions of the world
[15:28] through the knowledge of the lord and
[15:30] savior jesus christ they are again
[15:32] entangled therein and overcome the
[15:34] latter and is worse with them than the
[15:36] beginning okay now notice this is
[15:38] dealing with people watching who these
[15:40] are people who are like showing trying
[15:42] to show something greater that this is
[15:44] the way to freedom this is the way to
[15:46] life everlasting this is the way to
[15:48] eternal life the tree of life and those
[15:50] sort of things and
[15:51] the bible says they promise you
[15:53] something great when actually they're
[15:54] putting you under bondage and they think
[15:56] they're doing fine but what they have
[15:58] put you under their thumb and now they
[16:00] are fully controlling you and they're
[16:02] i'll say it like this there's a brother
[16:04] to come preach for us
[16:06] like a bigger name and he went back to
[16:08] the old pastor's office and brother can
[16:11] just kind of talk and this and this and
[16:12] the brother all of a sudden he says
[16:15] brother cam they'll never control me
[16:18] i'm not going to be controlled by them
[16:19] this and this and my cam's like what are
[16:20] we talking about here and it's almost
[16:22] like he just let the inner battles of
[16:24] his mind out of his heart
[16:26] just come out of his mouth and confess
[16:28] that something and he never made it
[16:30] clear he never made sure he never said
[16:32] anything about who was or anything like
[16:34] that but he said he said that they won't
[16:35] be they're not going to control me
[16:38] remember they can of course let me know
[16:40] about it like
[16:41] and uh yeah so there's there's
[16:44] controlling going around in this message
[16:46] of the owl
[16:47] now so let's continue on here now and we
[16:50] hit this earlier this uh this morning
[16:52] here by god's grace he says through this
[16:54] volume and he's talking about uh the the
[16:56] church ages he says through this volume
[16:58] would concern
[16:59] itself with various marriage doctrines
[17:01] such as goddamn water baptism etc found
[17:03] in revelation chapter 1 to 3 its main
[17:05] theme is a setting forth of a detailed
[17:07] study of the church ages
[17:10] the seven church ages this is necessary
[17:13] in order to study the understanding the
[17:14] rest of revelation for out of the ages
[17:17] comes the seals and how the seals come
[17:19] the trumpets and out of the trumpets
[17:20] come the viles right so notice it's a
[17:22] continual growth from one thing to the
[17:24] next to the next to the next to the next
[17:26] and then i'll say like this if we came
[17:27] from heaven and we have to go back there
[17:30] god has to and he knows and he plans and
[17:32] allowed us to be what lost
[17:35] if he sent us down to be lost and we're
[17:37] lost way in the beginning he's got to
[17:39] find a way where he brings forth away to
[17:41] what gets us back to heaven absolutely
[17:44] and if you look at the scripture read
[17:45] the scripture and you look at it he took
[17:47] 6 000 years to do it
[17:50] he's taking on purpose this long going
[17:53] from revelation to revelation to
[17:55] revelation to understanding here a
[17:58] little their little precept upon precept
[18:00] line upon nine chapter paul chapter book
[18:03] after prophet prophet after prophet and
[18:05] he took that much time to what builds to
[18:07] the place where there will be a people
[18:09] who is ready for a body changed
[18:16] but god did it in such a slow slow way
[18:20] that he only revealed so much light for
[18:23] a certain age to only get him up to so
[18:26] far
[18:27] because if they would go so far would
[18:29] get out of his plan he would not be able
[18:31] to accomplish the way he wanted to
[18:32] accomplish it that's right right he says
[18:34] like i'll just say like this
[18:36] brother jesse is his oldest man child
[18:38] right here or the maokai and brother
[18:40] maokai would probably should only know
[18:42] certain things at certain times of his
[18:44] life as grown up absolutely now brother
[18:46] jesse uh i know he was in the home
[18:48] invasion there for a little bit maybe he
[18:49] got a gun i can't remember if he did or
[18:51] not however and then uh you know you
[18:53] know malachi grove at four years old you
[18:55] know and he's like dad let me see that
[18:56] gun josh is like no you're not gonna see
[18:57] that gun it's not time for you to handle
[18:59] the gun now right now uh uh does brother
[19:01] mack i need enough gun no he's got these
[19:04] two things right here he's a weapon
[19:05] machine himself right but now would also
[19:07] be a good time for him maybe to learn uh
[19:10] if his dad would choose or him and his
[19:12] however to get into maybe shooting or
[19:14] however this that it would be a good
[19:15] time but not
[19:16] over zion's age that's not a good time
[19:18] for boys or children to handle guns
[19:20] right
[19:24] pretty simple but yeah you get my point
[19:26] yeah
[19:28] and the same way with the heavenly
[19:29] father absolutely he's not going to give
[19:31] you that spoken word thus saith the lord
[19:33] or just speak it when you're just a
[19:34] little child as far as giving i'll say
[19:37] like this now if you look at satan's
[19:39] children
[19:40] god or
[19:42] satan will give his children all kinds
[19:44] of power with no character
[19:46] that's right right they're in the astral
[19:48] production projection they're into all
[19:50] kinds of sorcery all kinds of spiritual
[19:52] stuff
[19:54] but what the prophecy is power without
[19:56] character is satanic that's right amen
[20:00] right and now us
[20:02] who are we believe we're the bride of
[20:03] christ we've heard the word of god it's
[20:05] open to us receive the baptism of the
[20:06] holy ghost
[20:08] and how many have actually seen a vision
[20:13] but just maybe he said it's kind of
[20:15] kind of debate debate about it however
[20:18] i don't think i've ever seen a vision
[20:20] and yet i've served the lord we tried to
[20:22] serve the lord for 20 years now
[20:24] but the power we're going to receive is
[20:26] going to take a character upgrade
[20:30] we're going to be the most humble like
[20:32] moses said was the most meekest man on
[20:35] the face of the earth right
[20:37] right yes
[20:39] because what always believed christ is
[20:41] the abcs but the spiritual things
[20:44] the spiritual gifts
[20:46] really deal with the supernatural but we
[20:49] must have the character for it now amen
[20:52] here we go this is where we
[20:54] he says like the first verse of the
[20:55] roman candle the church ages come forth
[20:57] with a mighty initial illumination
[20:59] without which there could be no further
[21:01] lie but once the bridge of the church
[21:04] ages of seven churches is followed by
[21:06] divine revelation light upon light
[21:09] follows now here's now see what the now
[21:11] this it tells you exactly god is
[21:14] progressive and he moved by a
[21:15] progressive nature and he has to he
[21:17] starts with one thing then he moves to
[21:19] the next and then he's removed and he's
[21:20] trying to teach us something but you've
[21:22] got to follow him amen amen
[21:25] those very first disciples that followed
[21:27] john the baptist oh this is the great
[21:29] mighty prophet john the baptist in there
[21:31] and the wilderness baptized and baptized
[21:33] and baptized and all of a sudden their
[21:34] prophet their man of god says what
[21:36] behold the lamb of god right there his
[21:39] disciples would watch someone that as
[21:42] this ministry could continue here and he
[21:44] says look behold the lamb of god cometh
[21:46] and these disciples are watching john
[21:48] the baptist and this man called jesus
[21:50] and john the baptist holds himself to
[21:52] the man and the guys are like well this
[21:54] is the prophet i thought this was the
[21:55] prophet and then here now
[21:57] the prophet has to take the lamb of god
[21:59] into the water and baptize him and they
[22:02] saw absolutely nothing but then later
[22:04] they said john says he goes guys he goes
[22:06] i saw the heaven i saw this thing the
[22:08] form of dove come down and rest right
[22:14] wow
[22:16] and then jesus would go by john's camp
[22:18] and say come follow me and a couple left
[22:21] but all the rest of john that disciple
[22:23] stop they just stay right here and say
[22:24] with john baptist
[22:26] and they stayed what in darkness up
[22:28] until acts 19. that's right brother
[22:31] right they had no idea that the light
[22:33] had moved off
[22:35] absolutely
[22:36] so we've got to always be in two now
[22:38] notice both john and james and peter
[22:42] then they were john the baptist they
[22:43] were in that kind of group whatever
[22:45] but they were able to discern something
[22:47] that that prophet said about following
[22:49] jesus and not staying with a prophet
[22:51] sure
[22:52] even at after prophet went off the scene
[22:54] what they were still
[22:55] john the baptist john the baptist john
[22:57] the baptist john the baptist and totally
[22:59] missed christ himself
[23:01] that's right but because of divine
[23:03] intervention because of election what
[23:06] god brings what is his next major
[23:09] prophet i'm saying saint paul was the
[23:10] first church church messenger said hey
[23:12] go meet my boys right there and show
[23:14] them catch them up with the light amen
[23:18] amen absolutely
[23:21] right now notice
[23:23] from light
[23:25] to light to light now what does the
[23:27] scripture say is there does this run in
[23:29] the scripture like this look look here
[23:31] blessed is the man whose strength is in
[23:34] thee amen and his heart are the ways of
[23:37] them who passing to the valley of bacca
[23:39] make it uh
[23:41] make it a well the rain also for the
[23:43] past they go from strength to strength
[23:46] every one of them in zion appears before
[23:50] god so what are we supposed to go to
[23:51] from strength
[23:53] to strength to strength
[23:56] to strength absolutely hallelujah right
[23:58] now right now there's no way anyone
[24:00] could even
[24:01] touch me on as far as in my mind even a
[24:03] baptism even if they pulled the
[24:04] scripture i'd never seen it it kind of
[24:06] went against baptism
[24:07] i know it's right
[24:09] baptism is right even got it there's no
[24:11] doubt about it in my mind baptism
[24:13] godhead the oneness is absolutely right
[24:16] because what we went from strength to
[24:18] prove this to prove that amen it's
[24:20] continued on now if you go from strength
[24:22] to strength you get stronger and
[24:23] stronger and stronger amen
[24:27] sure now notice uh uh in job 17 nine he
[24:30] says the righteous also shall hold on
[24:33] his way and he that have clean hands
[24:35] shall be stronger
[24:37] and stronger
[24:39] see it's always an increase
[24:42] that's right you should there and i'll
[24:44] take this what's the limit
[24:47] what's our where do we max out at
[24:50] come up hither
[24:55] all right you here come up here it'll
[24:57] prove that he went from strength to
[25:00] strength to height to height to
[25:02] revelation to revelation when you come
[25:04] up when you hear that club hither you
[25:05] have arrived amen amen but that's the
[25:08] point of all this is to leading and
[25:10] building and building building what for
[25:12] the great body change
[25:15] amen exactly right now
[25:17] glory he says uh verse uh proverbs 4 and
[25:20] 17 he says for they eat the bread of
[25:22] wickedness and drink the wine of
[25:24] violence but the path of the just is a
[25:26] shining light that shines us more and
[25:29] more unto the perfect day are we heading
[25:32] into the perfect day yes
[25:34] in the word absolutely to the jesus
[25:36] christ absolutely we are in that day and
[25:39] that day will what it will shine more
[25:41] and more and more it's going to get
[25:44] brighter and clearer and if you look at
[25:46] the bible it talks about how he says
[25:47] when the son of man comes he says it'll
[25:49] come like a thief in the night there's
[25:50] like three scriptures that say that but
[25:51] then saint paul says he says but to you
[25:54] who are of the day we will know that
[25:56] time absolutely
[25:59] amen
[26:00] amen hallelujah absolutely if you caught
[26:02] the revelation this message
[26:04] you i was like this if you caught the
[26:05] revelation of this message you will not
[26:08] be in darkness hallelujah sure amen
[26:12] in john 15 1 says i am the true vine and
[26:14] my father is the husband man every
[26:16] branch in me that bears that fruit he
[26:19] taketh away
[26:20] and every branch should bear a fruit how
[26:22] many's got fruit on how he's got that
[26:24] real love and
[26:26] care and concern all the fruits of the
[26:28] spirit right he says if you even have a
[26:30] little bit of fruit he says he purchased
[26:32] it oh why are these trowels coming
[26:34] [Music]
[26:35] why are these trials coming
[26:38] these tough times brother i'm going
[26:40] through it it's probably got some fruit
[26:42] on top
[26:43] that's right
[26:45] and what does he do
[26:46] that he purges it he gives you some
[26:49] tough times he rips down the more of the
[26:51] simon the old simon takes the old
[26:53] brother simon out just continually
[26:55] scrubs me clean
[26:57] and you clean
[26:58] that it may bring forth more fruit amen
[27:02] amen god you want to talk about
[27:04] prosperity gospel
[27:05] [Laughter]
[27:07] more and more stronger stronger and
[27:09] greater and greater and lighter
[27:10] absolutely that's right that is the
[27:12] bride of christ not natural but
[27:14] spiritual
[27:17] by the end of this you'll be the most
[27:18] spiritual richest people that have ever
[27:21] lived
[27:24] and you'll be so humble about it
[27:27] and you'll be so giving you'll say
[27:29] silver and gold have i none
[27:34] let me show you what he can do
[27:37] absolutely if we want to get back to the
[27:39] point where we hear the voice of god we
[27:41] are completely led of the spirit and
[27:43] don't go here go right here because the
[27:44] door's going to open up and say this
[27:46] when they come and the angel visits you
[27:48] on a rooftop or however and things start
[27:50] moving just like in the book of acts
[27:52] absolutely amen
[27:54] amen now
[27:56] second corinthians 3 16 nevertheless is
[27:58] when it shall turn to the lord the veil
[28:00] shall be taken away
[28:02] now the lord is that spirit when the
[28:04] spirit of the lord is there is liberty
[28:05] but we are with open face beholding as a
[28:08] glass he says the glory of the lord are
[28:11] changed in the same image from glory
[28:14] to glory even as by the spirit of the
[28:18] lord so only this so by the spirit of
[28:20] the lord you will be changed from this
[28:22] to this because the what's in paul
[28:24] saying there's a glory of the the
[28:26] terrestrial and there's a glory of the
[28:27] celestial that's right glory of this
[28:29] body is the glory of that body this what
[28:31] is moving from one to the next to the
[28:34] next to the next what is the mind of god
[28:37] how far will he take us in the
[28:38] millennium how far will he take us into
[28:40] eternity
[28:41] yes we can't even imagine
[28:44] what eternity will have as a divorce
[28:47] right
[28:49] all i know is that when he's there
[28:52] that means his presence is gonna be
[28:54] there
[28:55] and in his presence with these perfect
[28:57] bodies that we're going to have
[29:00] where are smiles
[29:02] you'll have the strongest smiling cheeks
[29:05] ever built by god ever
[29:08] because they're going to be no tears
[29:10] there's going to be no crying it's just
[29:11] gonna be joy forevermore hey amen sure
[29:15] now
[29:17] it's a little intro here so
[29:20] i've already got 26 minutes in okay so
[29:22] we're going to run this now
[29:25] and all these things
[29:29] notice here in second peter 3
[29:33] and 17 you therefore beloved seeing ye
[29:36] know all these things before bewareless
[29:38] ye also being led away with the air of
[29:41] the wicked
[29:42] fall fall from your own steadfastness
[29:45] he says so be careful careful these
[29:47] things but grow in grace
[29:51] and
[29:52] in the knowledge of our lord and savior
[29:55] jesus christ to him be glory both now
[29:57] and forever so what we're supposed to
[29:58] grow in grace
[30:00] yes

[30:17] hey man my cloak in my
[30:20] shirt
[30:24] he says but grow in grace and knowledge
[30:26] of ours now notice jesus if you're going
[30:28] to grow in knowledge then there has to
[30:30] be someone to desire that knowledge
[30:32] that's right amen now each one every
[30:34] human is born for knowledge you look at
[30:35] it i mean i don't i mean i have i've had
[30:37] puppies but i've never had a human
[30:40] baby i guess like that right my wife
[30:42] you know
[30:43] but that puppy
[30:45] i know it's kind of
[30:46] just as like you have no idea
[30:53] right that puppy
[30:55] is very curious
[30:57] and wants to learn how to catch and
[30:59] fetch and fight and bite scratch all
[31:01] those things now
[31:02] you get a young uh
[31:04] acacia a young
[31:06] haven or charis or howard
[31:09] they're interested in what mom's doing
[31:11] they're interested in what dad's doing
[31:13] they want to learn
[31:14] they say what children are sponges
[31:18] yes mom and dad be riding the car that
[31:19] child will say blah blah blah
[31:22] who's holding that
[31:24] where'd they learn that
[31:26] they just absorb things they have they
[31:28] just want to know everything i've seen
[31:30] children say i can't wait to learn how
[31:32] to read
[31:34] because then they can gain more and more
[31:36] knowledge because they know there's
[31:37] something about this written language we
[31:40] have that we can learn read and
[31:42] catch those things
[31:44] amen i notice here
[31:47] now therefore my son be strong in the
[31:49] grace that is in christ jesus we're
[31:51] gonna hit something
[31:53] and the things that thou has heard of me
[31:56] among many witnesses the same
[31:58] commit thou to faithful men
[32:01] who are able to teach others also now
[32:04] this is the word of god coming from the
[32:06] holy ghost blasting out of saint paul
[32:09] warning what his son in the faith uh
[32:11] taught timothy
[32:14] and the devil's right here listening
[32:17] okay
[32:19] all right i'll set my little shop up too
[32:21] here
[32:22] now therefore endure hardness as a good
[32:25] soldier of christ jesus christ
[32:27] no man that war entangled himself with
[32:30] the affairs of this world this life that
[32:31] he may please him who hath chosen him to
[32:34] be a soldier
[32:37] but he says the same commit thou to
[32:39] faithful men who shall be able to teach
[32:41] others
[32:42] now i want to go into a little book here
[32:44] okay you got a lot of reading
[32:46] everybody okay everybody yes eye's okay
[32:49] i know we're wearing you probably just
[32:50] had some pizza or some chipotle or some
[32:52] kind of
[32:54] i got my wife thai food last night
[32:57] that's really good makes you sleepy
[33:01] i want to show you something
[33:03] look at this
[33:06] this was taken from a uh
[33:08] history history book
[33:13] and it's about a cartoon i'm gonna show
[33:15] you the cartoon here
[33:17] in sixth in
[33:18] 1868 the new york legislature
[33:23] ruled that public funds public money tax
[33:26] money however kind of wherever they get
[33:27] this public money is of the people
[33:30] could be made available to private
[33:32] schools
[33:34] where'd that influence come from
[33:36] most of the schools that benefited from
[33:38] this law were parochial schools of the
[33:40] roman catholic church
[33:43] i wonder where that paper came how'd
[33:44] they get that run through there
[33:48] shortly thereafter roman catholics
[33:50] complained about the compulsory
[33:52] use of the king james virgin bible in
[33:54] the public schools
[33:56] hmm already complaining okay we got this
[33:59] money and the money came with a little
[34:01] uh ear tag that you got to use the king
[34:02] james version bible
[34:05] another complaint about it because they
[34:07] got the money now they have to obey
[34:10] and now notice this this right here
[34:13] influenced this situation here in 1868
[34:15] influenced this cartoon
[34:20] this is a little political propaganda
[34:22] here which is absolutely the true
[34:23] propaganda this should be this should be
[34:25] drawn
[34:26] notice here you have the americans here
[34:28] notice the u.s public school system over
[34:31] here
[34:31] notice
[34:32] where did we flee from
[34:34] we fled from england to get away from
[34:38] tyranny
[34:40] was it english government
[34:41] it was the catholic church
[34:44] it was the catholic church
[34:46] and notice how the uh the artist depicts
[34:49] the catholics as alligators
[34:53] coming over what to eat what what are
[34:55] they what is this man this man is not
[34:57] scared he's like back off man you ain't
[34:58] touching my
[35:00] children
[35:02] public school and he's back there's a
[35:05] lot in here i don't know what all means
[35:06] i was not from this era but notice
[35:08] they're coming after the
[35:10] children some lady over here is going to
[35:12] get hung i don't know what that's all
[35:13] about
[35:15] but they're coming to protect the
[35:17] children they're coming the catholic
[35:19] church is coming after the children 16
[35:21] 1868
[35:23] okay
[35:27] now
[35:28] in our possession
[35:30] as americans as christians
[35:34] our number one book
[35:36] is the bible
[35:38] the authorized king james version by
[35:41] 1611. right
[35:43] and then probably the second book i
[35:44] would recommend after that is the seven
[35:46] church ages the exposition of the seven
[35:48] church changes amen the book after that
[35:53] would be 50 years in the church of rome
[35:55] by charleston
[36:01] that book
[36:04] is powerful
[36:06] now we're going to read some of what
[36:07] charles sir charles brother charles
[36:09] wrote
[36:11] on this is right around the time of his
[36:13] ordination into the priesthood
[36:16] he says the word education is a
[36:18] beautiful word it comes from latin
[36:20] educator or however you can say that
[36:23] which means to raise up to take from the
[36:26] lowest degree to the highest sphere of
[36:28] knowledge
[36:29] education
[36:31] now we're supposed to what
[36:36] to grow in the grace and the knowledge
[36:39] of our lord and savior jesus christ yes
[36:42] now as we have heard of the insanity
[36:45] of the political scene and
[36:48] the carnal scene
[36:50] what about the scene i was like what
[36:52] about the
[36:53] religious scene in this message
[36:56] there are people baptizing in wayne
[36:59] branham
[37:00] right there are people baptizing tithing
[37:02] in joseph graham
[37:04] and to us of this sort of mind where we
[37:07] are right now that is complete
[37:09] insanity yes yes sir you have to be
[37:13] insane
[37:15] something else has become your absolute
[37:18] something else has become your absolute
[37:24] but it's all from
[37:28] knowledge
[37:29] education
[37:31] trained men
[37:32] taught
[37:34] taught to re-teach
[37:36] right
[37:39] he says the object of education is to
[37:41] feed expand raise
[37:43] enlighten strengthen the intelligence we
[37:46] hear the roman catholic priests make use
[37:48] of the beautiful word education is often
[37:51] in if not often than the protestant but
[37:53] the word education has a very different
[37:56] meaning among the followers of the pope
[37:57] than among the disciples of the gospel
[37:59] and that difference with the protestants
[38:01] ignore is the cause of the strange
[38:03] blunders they make every time they try
[38:05] to legislate on that question here as
[38:07] well as in england or in canada the
[38:09] meaning of the word education among
[38:11] protestants is as far from the meaning
[38:13] of the same word among the roman
[38:15] catholics as the north pole is from the
[38:17] south
[38:20] what
[38:21] wait a religious difference and it
[38:23] changes the word education
[38:26] absolutely when a protestant speaks of
[38:28] education that word is used and
[38:30] understood in its true
[38:32] sense
[38:33] when he sends his little boy to a
[38:35] protestant school i'll say it like this
[38:37] and i'm not trying to sow any seeds here
[38:40] but jesse is the pastor of this church
[38:43] right
[38:45] and he's the one that's supposed to be
[38:46] grabbing the revelation from the holy
[38:48] ghost and then therefore bringing the
[38:50] forth to the people
[38:51] now let's say young malachi here
[38:54] is playing the piano one day and
[38:56] just playing like this playing like this
[38:58] playing like this right
[39:00] and something comes to and says man i
[39:02] feel a pull to preach papa
[39:05] but justin's like you better pray on him
[39:10] so you want to be alone
[39:18] now the proper way for brother jesse to
[39:19] do this is to say brother man okay let's
[39:21] do some bible studies let's pray we're
[39:22] gonna ground and do some bible studies
[39:24] and then if you still feel led we'll
[39:27] we'll test the gift right
[39:29] but brother jesse would ever say
[39:33] you better not teach anything contrary
[39:35] to my revelation
[39:36] that i've teached over this pulpit
[39:38] but what if god gives for the malachi a
[39:41] different revelation or a greatness a
[39:44] higher revelation because we're supposed
[39:45] to go from strength to strength right
[39:47] from glory to glory to revelation to
[39:50] revelation
[39:53] now what are some of the minds of the
[39:54] message
[39:55] don't say anything that bill graham did
[39:56] not teach on the tapes
[39:58] or just ever teach anything to brother
[39:59] brandon teach
[40:00] in type and shadow sure absolutely me
[40:03] too did you ever use any scriptures that
[40:05] are on the tapes sure sure
[40:07] me too absolutely
[40:08] but there's a lot of people don't
[40:10] believe that all right just stick with
[40:12] what the tapes say where'd that teaching
[40:14] come from
[40:16] right
[40:17] if we're supposed to go now we're 70
[40:20] years past the most
[40:22] he says now notice he's the protestant
[40:24] when a protestant seeks education that
[40:26] word is used understood in true sense
[40:27] when he sends his little boy to a
[40:29] prodigal school he honestly desires that
[40:31] he should be reared up in the spheres of
[40:33] knowledge as much as his intelligence
[40:35] will allow
[40:38] and that's every father every mother
[40:39] wants that for their babies right right
[40:41] he says when you practice and send your
[40:43] children to school you put no feathers
[40:45] all to their intelligence
[40:47] you raise with fluttering wings day
[40:50] after day though their flight at first
[40:52] is slow and timid how happy they feel as
[40:54] every new aspect of their intellectual
[40:57] horizons
[40:58] i'm sure
[40:59] sister lydia and malachi have watched
[41:02] their children their brothers and
[41:03] sisters
[41:04] grow up and say wow they're really
[41:05] learning they're they're pretty sharp
[41:07] they're well they knows almost as much
[41:09] as i do little havens really catching it
[41:10] wow
[41:12] absolutely
[41:13] and they get to watch the same process
[41:15] that they took that their parents took
[41:17] as well with their little right
[41:19] and they're always pushed and say
[41:21] even i want you to read this word again
[41:23] just say it pronounce it just how it's
[41:24] supposed to be it's pronounced and well
[41:26] it's 18 syllables well so what just get
[41:28] it done
[41:30] sure sure he says now notice he says uh
[41:33] though their flight at first is slow and
[41:35] timid how happy they feel when they go
[41:37] to the new intellectual horizons how
[41:39] their heart beats with unspeakable joy
[41:41] when they begin to hear voices of
[41:43] applause and encouragement from every
[41:44] side saying higher higher learn more
[41:46] higher push into the heavenlies
[41:48] absolutely with your what intelligence
[41:50] learn as much as you can because someday
[41:52] you're going to be a young man and
[41:53] someday you're going to be a young woman
[41:55] and you're going to have to what carry
[41:57] on you're going to provide for yourself
[41:58] and get a job right right that's right
[42:00] that's part of life
[42:04] when they shake their young wings and
[42:06] take a little still higher flight who
[42:08] can express their joy when they
[42:11] distinctly begin to hear the voices of a
[42:12] beloved mother or their father or
[42:14] venerable pastor cheering them and
[42:16] saying well done higher yet my child
[42:18] higher raising themselves with more
[42:20] confidence on their wings and they still
[42:22] hot they soar still higher in the midst
[42:24] of the uh
[42:25] unanimously concert the voice of the
[42:27] whole country encouraging to fly the
[42:29] highest
[42:31] it is then the young man feels his
[42:33] intellectual strength tenfold multiply
[42:36] one thing once they solve one
[42:37] mathematical problem they go to the next
[42:39] and like man i can do math
[42:42] once they learn english and shows
[42:44] adjectives and verbs and all those other
[42:46] things i forget all about 20 years ago
[42:49] wow i got the english language i got
[42:51] this and now they're pushing the higher
[42:53] highs and learn another language learn
[42:54] to go into geometry go into algebra and
[42:57] calculus and all those sort of things
[42:58] higher math
[43:00] right because you want to see how far
[43:02] they can go
[43:03] right because the more you know the more
[43:05] you'll earn a lot of times right in the
[43:07] natural right absolutely right
[43:10] he says uh
[43:11] he he lifts himself up on his eagle
[43:14] wings with a renewed confidence and
[43:16] power and source still up higher and
[43:18] higher with his heart beating with a
[43:19] noble enjoy uh a holy joy from south to
[43:23] north to east to west to echoes rings is

[43:26] they're always pushing their children to
[43:28] the best they can be right amen
[43:31] absolutely
[43:32] for he had also heard the voice of god
[43:35] speaking through his son jesus christ
[43:36] saying come unto me fear not come come
[43:38] unto me i am the light the way come to
[43:40] this region
[43:42] a higher region where the father and the
[43:44] son of the spirit reign in endless life
[43:46] amen amen absolutely so notice the
[43:48] spiritual the natural one in the same
[43:51] what we see taking in the natural should
[43:52] be the spiritual what we see in the
[43:54] spiritual should be the natural as well
[43:55] if we hear the voice of god calling us
[43:57] into the rapture then we should hear
[43:59] what in the natural we should be the
[44:01] best man
[44:02] hallelujah
[44:04] praise god
[44:05] let's continue on here i don't want to
[44:07] be too long jesus i'm going to start
[44:08] down here right in the protestant
[44:10] schools no feathers are put on the young
[44:12] eagles wings there's nothing to stop in
[44:14] his progress or paralyze his movements
[44:17] and upward flights right
[44:19] the thus it is that the only true great
[44:22] nations in the world are protestants
[44:26] yes
[44:27] literally
[44:30] why the american revolution they call it
[44:32] the american revolution
[44:35] late 1800s early 1900s why they called
[44:38] the american industrial revolution
[44:41] because industry just boom
[44:44] they were notice
[44:45] once they got from underneath the
[44:47] catholic
[44:48] control right and they're free naturally
[44:51] to think on their own
[44:54] and experiment on their own
[44:57] and not told that you have to pay
[44:59] this
[45:00] for indulgences and this and this and
[45:02] and you can't do this you can't do this
[45:04] the pope says this book once they're
[45:06] freed from all of that amen
[45:09] glory and there's no one telling them
[45:11] what they could do
[45:12] a lot of these christians at the time or
[45:14] however yeah they want to be free from
[45:17] that work
[45:18] they were able to free their minds and
[45:20] what they do they just sat
[45:22] they worked and waited for revelations
[45:25] to come on how to build this and how to
[45:27] build this and how can we make this
[45:29] better and make this work better more
[45:31] efficient at this and this and hey
[45:33] you ever take a take a tour of one of
[45:34] those early 1900s steam ships
[45:36] phenomenal the technology had back then
[45:39] you blown away i mean why
[45:41] couple
[45:42] right to legal
[45:46] thus it is that the only true great
[45:48] nations in the world are protestants why
[45:50] does the usa have one of the worst uh
[45:53] health care systems right now
[45:55] for being
[45:56] number one supposedly we're way way way
[45:59] low
[46:03] let me ask you a question why does
[46:04] israel
[46:05] one of the most powerful nations in the
[46:08] world right now
