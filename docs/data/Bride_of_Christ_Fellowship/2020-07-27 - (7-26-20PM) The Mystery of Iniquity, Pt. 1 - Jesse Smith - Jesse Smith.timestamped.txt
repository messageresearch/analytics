[28:17] let's take our bibles here let's go to
[28:18] second thessalonians chapter two
[28:30] if you would let's stand for the reading
[28:32] of god's word
[28:34] let's start at verse one i like to look
[28:36] at the other mystery
[28:37] another mystery rather i like to look at
[28:39] the mystery of iniquity tonight by god's
[28:40] grace i want to start these two
[28:42] mysteries the will of god and
[28:44] iniquity you know the scripture says the
[28:47] seventh angel is the finish
[28:48] the mystery of god so all these
[28:50] mysteries that are cause reason i will
[28:52] not be finished
[28:54] at the end time and thank god they are
[28:58] praise god ii thessalonians chapter 2.
[29:22] i want to read one uh one to eight
[29:30] let me read one to six and then we'll
[29:32] read seven and eight together by god's
[29:34] grace i'll read one
[29:35] to six now we beseech you brethren by
[29:38] the coming of our lord jesus christ
[29:40] and by our gathering together unto him
[29:43] that ye be not soon shaken in mind
[29:47] or be troubled neither by spirit nor by
[29:50] word nor by letter as from us
[29:54] as that the day of christ is at hand if
[29:56] it was at hand 2000 years ago where are
[29:58] we at today
[30:00] he said don't let anybody shake you up
[30:02] in your mind right
[30:04] because we know the day of christ is at
[30:06] hand verse three
[30:07] let no man deceive you by any means
[30:10] that's why we gotta be
[30:11] really careful what other preachers say
[30:12] right preachers friends
[30:14] family members we gotta be very careful
[30:16] don't do not let any man deceive you
[30:19] by any means for that day speaking of
[30:21] the day of christ
[30:23] shall not come except there come a
[30:25] falling away first
[30:26] and that man of sin be revealed the son
[30:29] of perdition
[30:31] who opposes and exalts himself above all
[30:34] that's called god
[30:35] or that is worship so that he as god
[30:37] sitteth in the temple of god
[30:39] showing himself that he is god remember
[30:42] ye not that when i was
[30:43] yet with you i told you these things and
[30:46] now ye know what withholdeth that he
[30:48] might be revealed
[30:50] in his time see he has his time but
[30:53] church it's our time now
[30:55] praise god it's our time now it's the
[30:57] bride's time now
[30:59] to be united with christ now let's read
[31:02] seven and eight together
[31:03] one two three for the mystery of
[31:06] iniquity
[31:06] doth already work only he who now
[31:10] letteth will let
[31:11] until he be taken out of the way and
[31:14] then
[31:15] shall that wicked be revealed whom the
[31:18] lord shall consume with the spirit of
[31:20] his mouth
[31:21] and shall destroy with the brightness of
[31:23] his coming
[31:24] let's have a word of prayer if you have
[31:25] a need on your heart let's just make it
[31:27] known unto god by raising our hand or
[31:29] raising our heart to heaven heavenly
[31:30] father we bow our heads in honor of you
[31:32] lord god
[31:33] you're our true headship dear god we
[31:35] look to you we bow our heads physically
[31:38] but we're looking to you spiritually god
[31:39] be our head
[31:40] be our headship guide us lead us lord
[31:42] direct us
[31:44] father strengthen us tonight as we look
[31:45] to your word lord anoint me to preach
[31:47] your word
[31:48] to receive it myself and also the people
[31:50] of god feed their hungry souls lord god
[31:52] and lord may you be exalted lord prepare
[31:54] us for thy coming as your
[31:56] mystery is finished and lord let us take
[31:58] the mystery and eat it lord god
[32:00] and let us become one with it lord as we
[32:02] digest it lord god and
[32:04] learn to live by every word that
[32:06] proceeds out of the mouth of god
[32:08] and father we'll be giving you giving
[32:10] you all the glory in jesus christ's name
[32:12] and the church said amen god bless you
[32:14] being seated praise god
[32:18] the mystery of iniquity
[32:22] lord willing will look at this here
[32:23] forgive me about 40 minutes here
[32:26] and then we'll go switch over to the
[32:28] testimony
[32:29] by god's grace
[32:31] [Music]
[32:33] this is the opposite of the statue
[32:36] perfect man
[32:39] so the statutory for man is the mystery
[32:40] of godliness how we become and grow
[32:42] more like god so iniquity
[32:46] is the exact opposite how many people
[32:48] will grow to be more like satan
[32:52] because satan is the father of iniquity
[32:56] and so i thought it'd be important after
[32:58] we started or after we finished rather
[33:00] the status perfect man
[33:01] to show this mystery so this is a
[33:04] mystery which is something that's hidden
[33:07] that most people don't understand
[33:11] and in the book you know chapter 9 is
[33:13] the mystery of babylon chapter 10 is the
[33:14] mystery of iniquity so
[33:16] once we identify mystery babylon the
[33:18] mother harlot
[33:19] and the daughters and how
[33:23] rome is mother protestants daughters
[33:27] it once it makes you investigate how
[33:30] does this
[33:31] mother-daughter team attract its members
[33:34] because right now by numbers they have
[33:36] over 2 billion members
[33:38] catholics have 1.2 billion and then
[33:41] protestants
[33:42] are about 800 000 i'm sorry 800 million
[33:45] rather
[33:46] that's by the 2010 numbers
[33:49] uh how do they attract that many people
[33:52] two billion people in catholicism and
[33:54] protestantism
[33:56] they do it through the deceitfulness of
[33:58] iniquity
[34:00] because that's what the scripture says
[34:02] it's a deceitfulness
[34:04] now i want to read verse 10 in chapter 2
[34:07] second thessalonians 2
[34:08] 10 and with all
[34:11] deceivableness of unrighteousness
[34:16] the scripture says in them that perish
[34:19] because they
[34:20] receive not the love of the truth that
[34:22] they might be saved
[34:26] verse 11 for this cause god shall send
[34:28] them a strong delusion that they shall
[34:30] believe a lie
[34:32] that they all might be damned who
[34:33] believe not the truth
[34:35] but had pleasure in unrighteousness
[34:39] now remember this morning i remember
[34:41] this morning god writes his laws
[34:43] in every human conscience the law of god
[34:47] is written in their conscience and then
[34:49] god manifests himself
[34:50] to every human being but the mystery of
[34:53] this
[34:54] is how how could god send people to hell
[34:58] he would do it because they they silence
[35:01] the voice of god
[35:03] in them right they silence the holy
[35:04] thirst of god within them
[35:06] and they purposely choose the pleasure
[35:09] of unrighteousness
[35:12] so see their lives they have to start
[35:14] out somehow having a holy thirst or some
[35:16] point they have to have
[35:17] a desire to know god and they know
[35:20] better
[35:20] they know better but they choose to hush
[35:23] that holy thirst
[35:24] and they choose to satisfy it with the
[35:26] unholy thing
[35:29] and so it's deceivableness so they're
[35:31] purposely deceived
[35:33] and church we all know what that's like
[35:35] right we've all purposely chosen the
[35:37] wrong thing sometime right
[35:40] if we're honest with ourselves when
[35:42] we've sinned it's because
[35:43] well we knew better most the time most
[35:46] the time we knew better
[35:47] so see we were deceived
[35:51] so the same thing applies here to those
[35:53] who are the workers of iniquity
[35:55] they know the truth but yet because they
[35:58] accept a lie
[36:01] they're deceived by it they accept that
[36:03] they're deceived
[36:04] and then if they don't escape that then
[36:07] the bible says
[36:09] they grow in iniquity they become more
[36:11] and more
[36:12] sinful and church the worst state the
[36:14] absolute worst state someone could be in
[36:16] is a state of strong delusion
[36:18] it's the reprobate mind in other words
[36:20] god has wiped his hands
[36:22] and he of that person and he no longer
[36:24] will deal with them we know that that's
[36:26] the absolute worst condition people
[36:28] could ever be in
[36:29] is they'd have a reprobate mind that god
[36:32] has disapproved of and he's
[36:33] wiped their hands of it and yet the
[36:37] bible says
[36:38] here that uh they loved it the bible
[36:40] said they had pleasure in
[36:42] unrighteousness god god hastened the day
[36:45] that everyone in our church
[36:47] cannot live happily in sin
[36:50] praise god in other words let me say
[36:51] this may the holy spirit convict us with
[36:53] such strong
[36:54] conviction that we can't enjoy sin for
[36:56] very long at all
[36:58] amen but the bible said they have
[37:00] pleasure in it
[37:02] they enjoy the iniquity
[37:06] so this is the opposite of where we
[37:09] should be growing in the stature of a
[37:10] perfect man
[37:12] so the roman catholic church and
[37:14] protestants as our sister karen and i
[37:16] were talking
[37:17] about methodists some methodist churches
[37:19] not all of them but some of them
[37:20] they're the ones who are propagating the
[37:22] iniquity by saying it's okay
[37:24] to enjoy this sin and so we accept this
[37:27] kind of sin the church
[37:29] so see they're propagating it they're
[37:30] spreading it to every nation
[37:34] and so that's how the mother daughter
[37:36] works the mother's the mother harlot you
[37:38] know she
[37:39] uh she started it but then it repeats in
[37:41] her daughters
[37:43] and it's absolutely the truth iniquity
[37:45] church means contempt
[37:47] which means you despise it to contempt
[37:50] and violation of the law
[37:52] wickedness so iniquity means you have a
[37:55] contempt
[37:56] for the truth of god's word so let's
[37:57] always be careful of our attitudes
[38:00] right because the even when david when
[38:02] david committed adultery the bible said
[38:04] he
[38:05] he had contempt for the word of god so
[38:07] david must have looked he must have knew
[38:09] the scripture
[38:10] not to take another man's wife but in
[38:11] that moment of passion
[38:13] he had contempt for that scripture and
[38:14] he said i don't care what it says
[38:16] i'm going to take bathsheba the bible
[38:19] said that nathan said he had contempt
[38:21] for the word of god
[38:22] in second samuel 12
[38:25] mercy
[38:28] so iniquity is lawlessness it's
[38:31] purposely sinning despite knowing god's
[38:33] will because remember god writes
[38:35] his will his laws in our consciences
[38:39] church it's mentioned over 300 times in
[38:41] scripture if you look up the word
[38:42] iniquity
[38:43] over 300 times in the scripture it is a
[38:46] well covered topic in the scripture
[38:49] iniquity is listed again and again and
[38:52] again
[38:52] and paul says this mystery was already
[38:55] working
[38:56] around 50 a.d that was less than 20 that
[38:59] was less than uh
[39:00] 20 years after christ's resurrection it
[39:03] was already
[39:04] working now let me uh
[39:07] go to my definition of this mystery just
[39:10] so i can have it
[39:11] uh so you can hear it the revelation of
[39:13] the mystery of iniquity
[39:14] is the antichrist spirit fills
[39:17] and deceives the hellbound majority
[39:21] into blaspheming god's truth under the
[39:24] guise or mask
[39:26] of a sin-loving religious experience
[39:30] that's a lot of words there that's a lot
[39:31] in there but that's the revelation of it
[39:35] because there's only two spirits how
[39:36] many how many with me there's a holy
[39:38] spirit
[39:39] and then there's the unholy spirits now
[39:41] they take different names right they
[39:42] have different jobs
[39:43] you know the spirit of fear uh spirit of
[39:46] infirmity right all these different
[39:47] spirits
[39:48] but they're all the same nature right
[39:52] and so the antichrist spirit we would
[39:53] just say is just that wrong spirit
[39:56] the unholy spirit and that fills
[39:59] and deceives the majority of people and
[40:03] they blaspheme
[40:04] god's word and yet it allows them to
[40:08] have
[40:09] a sin loving experience while sitting in
[40:12] church
[40:12] and my prayer is this as you know it too
[40:14] god i don't care how small our church
[40:16] needs to be
[40:17] keep all the iniquity out of our church
[40:19] i don't care how small i don't care
[40:21] i don't care how small the church how
[40:23] big it gets what we want is we want all
[40:26] the sin out of our church
[40:28] and i'll be happy i can i can sleep at
[40:30] night praise god
[40:31] you can sleep at night we can have peace
[40:33] with god when we know our lives are
[40:35] clean
[40:36] and when we know the church is clean
[40:38] because church if our lives are not
[40:40] clean
[40:40] if the church is not clean then the
[40:42] bible says we're a lump of leaven
[40:44] leavened bread right that means we
[40:47] people won't get healed people won't get
[40:48] saved
[40:49] people won't be helped if there is
[40:51] unconfessed in the church the bible said
[40:53] it
[40:54] it uh it spreads like leaven
[40:58] remember paul said cut the leaven out
[41:00] kick it out of the church right purge
[41:01] the church
[41:02] i was pre i was reading about john
[41:04] wesley yesterday and he was known for
[41:06] purging people out of their churches he
[41:08] was known for that
[41:10] if someone wasn't living a sanctified
[41:11] life he took him out of the fellowship
[41:13] he said don't come back
[41:14] to get your life cleaned up that ought
[41:17] to help us examine ourselves
[41:21] so see this iniquity spirit this
[41:23] antichrist spirit was
[41:25] already working i forgot to set my watch
[41:31] now church here here we are two 000
[41:33] years later
[41:34] but the spirit of iniquity mr of
[41:36] iniquity is going to head up in the
[41:38] antichrist person we know it's going to
[41:40] be
[41:41] a future pope if not this pope
[41:44] now for me i hope god carries a little
[41:45] bit so all my children can grow up and
[41:47] get the holy ghost and
[41:49] but if their names are on the book and
[41:51] the rapture comes they'll go
[41:52] praise god we just have to believe that
[41:55] because we don't have any other answers
[41:56] that's what brother that's brother
[41:57] adam's answer
[42:00] so see iniquity is a lifestyle then
[42:04] it's a habitual lifestyle of sin
[42:08] it's loving sin yet having a religious
[42:11] kind of testimony so church this honor
[42:14] we
[42:14] this ought to really help us examine
[42:16] ourselves praise god because all of us i
[42:18] can look out
[42:18] here everybody comes to church everybody
[42:21] is religious
[42:23] so we're getting into your habits right
[42:25] we have to get into our habits
[42:27] because that's what iniquity is bad
[42:28] habits it's
[42:30] purposely having contempt for god's word
[42:33] and not obeying it yet having a church
[42:35] experience
[42:36] remember the bible said lukewarm is way
[42:38] worse than cold
[42:40] right it's jesus says it's better to be
[42:44] cold than to be lukewarm
[42:46] right so we must remain on fire for god
[42:50] amen now i want to look at a few
[42:52] scriptures so occasionally if you could
[42:53] pull up a few
[42:54] uh genesis 15 16 please if you can pull
[42:58] that up there
[42:59] this shows the joshua led israeli army
[43:03] drove out the amorites once their cup of
[43:06] iniquity was full in god's eyes
[43:10] when the fourth generation they shall
[43:11] come hither again for the iniquity of
[43:13] the amorites is not yet
[43:15] full praise god
[43:20] and now could you pull up joshua 10 12.
[43:23] see what is god basing this on he's
[43:26] basing upon how much iniquity people
[43:27] have committed
[43:29] god's judgment is based he's measuring
[43:32] their judge
[43:33] their sins and when it gets to a certain
[43:35] amount where it's too much
[43:36] then he pours out the judgment joshua 10
[43:40] 12.
[43:41] then speak joshua to the lord in the day
[43:44] when the lord delivered up the amorites
[43:45] before the children of israel he sent
[43:46] the sight of
[43:47] israel's son stand thou still upon the
[43:49] gibeon
[43:51] and thou moon in the valley of agilent
[43:53] church this is when the amorites finally
[43:54] got defeated
[43:56] it was when joshua spoke something and
[43:59] the bible said god has never hearkened
[44:00] to a man
[44:01] before or after like joshua's voice amen
[44:06] god was using joshua to pour out the cup
[44:09] of iniquity god was saying i'm done
[44:13] they've had their chance and he's
[44:16] pouring out judgment
[44:18] see god is measuring iniquity look at
[44:20] church we're either going to be
[44:21] we're going to be filling up something
[44:22] right we're going to be filled with
[44:23] something either the holy spirit or are
[44:25] you full of iniquity
[44:27] that's the only way god can judge and
[44:29] that's that's how everyone's
[44:31] life is seen you're either filled with
[44:33] the fruits of god
[44:34] filled with the love of god the
[44:35] blessings of god or filling up with
[44:37] iniquity
[44:40] that's one example lot and his two
[44:43] daughters narrowly escaped god's fire
[44:45] and brimstone
[44:46] upon sodom and it was poured out due to
[44:49] the
[44:50] iniquity of the city that was in uh
[44:53] genesis 19 15. can you pull that up
[44:55] there
[44:55] i just kind of want to lay a little
[44:57] foundation here
[44:59] iniquity so amorites
[45:02] and now sodom and gomorrah iniquity
[45:08] genesis 19 15. and when the morning
[45:11] arose then the angels hastened saying
[45:12] arise
[45:13] take thy wife and thy two daughters
[45:15] which are here lest thou be consumed in
[45:17] the iniquity
[45:18] of the city so homosexuality
[45:22] iniquity unconfessed
[45:25] and god judges it now the set now the
[45:27] strange part is or the maybe surprising
[45:29] part is
[45:29] jesus said it will be more tolerable for
[45:31] sodom and gomorrah
[45:34] with the iniquity of homosexuality than
[45:36] for the generation of pharisees and
[45:38] sadducees
[45:39] that rejected christ that's striking
[45:43] it'd be more tolerable for just violent
[45:46] homosexuals
[45:46] than it would be for the the religious
[45:49] people that turned down
[45:50] the mighty miracles of jesus christ
[45:52] aren't you glad you've accepted him
[45:54] praise god
[45:54] amen i'm so glad i'm on his side amen
[45:59] praise god that we shun iniquity we show
[46:02] the things of the world
[46:05] like i was telling sister karen i read
[46:06] the church age book yesterday brother
[46:08] brahm said
[46:09] shun the denominations like you shunned
[46:11] the plague and i thought coronavirus
[46:13] so i said it's okay to shun the
[46:14] chronovirus it's okay to quarantine
[46:17] right
[46:18] it's okay it's okay to wear a mask if
[46:19] you have to it's okay to
[46:21] uh get a test it's okay to keep your six
[46:24] feet if you were
[46:25] if you're shunning the plague he said
[46:27] you do that
[46:29] but we ought to shun that antichrist
[46:31] even more praise god
[46:32] even more praise god
[46:36] remember mystery babylon is destroyed in
[46:39] revelation 18
[46:40] because her iniquities are remembered in
[46:42] heaven oh i'm so glad
[46:44] that the blood of jesus christ wipes out
[46:46] my sins in heaven praise god
[46:48] that there's no remembrance of them
[46:49] praise god
[46:53] see see church that should be our prayer
[46:54] god help me not to get the spot where i
[46:56] love to commit sin
[46:59] help me lord to not have pleasure
[47:03] in unrighteousness because they go from
[47:07] they go from iniquity to inequity right
[47:10] the bible says it plainly they go from
[47:12] deception to deception they go
[47:14] just further and further and it starts
[47:17] in the churches remember that parable
[47:18] jesus told that woman
[47:19] the woman slipped in three measures of
[47:22] leaven at the beginning
[47:23] but you didn't see it right the
[47:24] beginning you don't see the leaven of
[47:26] that woman that mother harlot
[47:27] you don't see the results of it till
[47:29] later
[47:32] and historically you know just by the
[47:34] history she slipped in the eucharist
[47:36] she slipped in the idol worship right at
[47:38] the beginning she then the trinity came
[47:40] a little late around 300 a.d that wasn't
[47:42] the first thing that was
[47:43] it started way before that but that
[47:47] eventually now look what they got and
[47:49] now look with every trinitarian church
[47:51] that loves the catholic the catholic
[47:52] system
[47:54] look look what it's produced now such
[47:57] iniquity
[47:58] but see the holy spirit produces
[48:00] righteousness amen
[48:02] amen it produces holiness amen it helps
[48:04] us to do the will of god
[48:06] amen amen
[48:10] now church we will commit sin a single
[48:13] acts of iniquity despite knowing better
[48:17] but we would we should always come to
[48:19] repentance
[48:20] and change our future behaviors
[48:24] can i give you an example here's a good
[48:26] example this is a good one
[48:28] joseph's brothers did they know better
[48:30] when they sold them out did they know
[48:31] they should not have sold their brother
[48:32] yeah they were grown men
[48:37] yet after they repented
[48:42] they never sold joseph again right they
[48:44] couldn't
[48:46] but then what the bible's saying
[48:48] revelation the bible said
[48:50] that all those 12 sons all had crowns in
[48:53] heaven
[48:54] you have 24 elders amen 12 of the
[48:57] apostles
[48:58] and though 12 sons of jacob praise god
[49:02] see they they committed iniquity they
[49:04] sold out their brother
[49:05] they wanted some of them wanted him to
[49:06] die but god was merciful
[49:09] they repented and jesus gives them
[49:11] crowns in heaven amen glory
[49:17] david committed iniquity by taking
[49:20] bathsheba
[49:21] he numbered israel but repented and he
[49:24] never repeated those sins
[49:29] paul said he committed evil sinful acts
[49:33] he hated that's what i like right there
[49:35] he hated he said that which i do i hate
[49:39] praise god
[49:42] and he says this assures believers jesus
[49:46] blood
[49:46] forgives all their trespasses so the
[49:49] same man that said
[49:50] when i want to do good evil's right
[49:52] there and i do things that i hate
[49:54] the same man who admitted to doing
[49:56] hateful things and sins the same man
[49:58] said
[49:59] but there's forgiveness to pardon us
[50:01] from all our transgressions
[50:04] thank god john assures the same
[50:09] and says confession of sins allows the
[50:12] faithful
[50:13] and just christ to forgive us of our
[50:15] sins
[50:16] and cleanse us from all unrighteousness
[50:21] praise god pull up isaiah 53
[50:25] please isaiah 53 5 read 5 6 and 11.
[50:30] god looks down from heaven brother
[50:32] sister
[50:33] he looks down from heaven and all he
[50:35] sees is mostly iniquity
[50:37] he says what solution can i give for
[50:39] this world it's just covered in iniquity
[50:42] what solution can i give and he said i'm
[50:45] going to send my dear
[50:46] innocent sinless son to take all the
[50:49] punishment of
[50:50] all this iniquity all this hatred for
[50:53] the law of god
[50:54] i'm going to put all of it on him and
[50:56] then i'll make a
[50:57] substitution that all those who accept
[50:59] him
[51:00] will become righteous praise god oh my
[51:03] what
[51:03] a no wonder it's called the gospel amen
[51:06] no wonder it's called good news
[51:08] hallelujah but he was wounded for our
[51:10] transgressions he was bruised for our
[51:12] iniquities
[51:13] the times that we knew better and we
[51:16] still
[51:17] had contempt for the word of god the
[51:19] chastisement of our peace was upon him
[51:21] with his stripes we are healed how many
[51:23] been healed by the stripes of christ
[51:25] amen oh we like sheep have gone astray
[51:27] we've turned everyone to his own way
[51:29] and the lord hath laid on him the
[51:31] iniquity
[51:32] of us all oh thank you jesus praise god
[51:36] all my iniquity all your iniquity was
[51:39] laid on jesus christ on the cross
[51:41] before you even knew it that's the best
[51:43] part before he even knew you needed it
[51:45] praise god
[51:46] it was already paid for hallelujah it
[51:49] makes it a free gift he doesn't have to
[51:50] go back to the cross again thank god
[51:52] he already took all that iniquity upon
[51:55] himself praise god
[51:57] that was god's answer christ on the
[51:59] cross was god's answer to our iniquity
[52:02] right
[52:04] our addiction to iniquity uh the
[52:06] depravity of our sin the depths of our
[52:08] our our wickedness christ is the answer
[52:11] praise god amen
[52:15] i hope the cross the old thing to us i
[52:17] hope it's a fresh
[52:18] real thing to us hallelujah
[52:22] the bible said he'd justify many by
[52:25] bearing
[52:26] their iniquities pull up acts 3 26.
[52:33] see anyone who's been delivered from an
[52:35] addiction which that was my first sermon
[52:37] i ever preached was about
[52:38] uh uh overcoming addictions over and
[52:41] over and over at the
[52:42] college there anyone who's ever been
[52:45] freed from addiction
[52:47] knows that it's an amazing experience
[52:50] it's like going from a slave
[52:52] to a free man it's like going from caged
[52:55] up
[52:55] to being totally free praise god that's
[52:58] what the bible said
[52:59] to the jews first god having raised up
[53:01] his son jesus
[53:02] sent him to bless you in turning away
[53:06] every one of you from his own iniquities
[53:09] amen god sent christ to bless us
[53:12] and the blessing is the fact that we can
[53:15] leave our iniquities
[53:16] and walk in holiness glory
[53:20] that's why he was sent to deliver us
[53:23] forgive us of our iniquities and then
[53:25] help us to come out of our iniquities
[53:30] so to believe in jesus means we stop
[53:33] committing iniquities
[53:35] that's what believing in christ means we
[53:37] leave our iniquities behind
[53:39] the bible said he that believeth and is
[53:41] baptized shall be saved he that
[53:42] believeth not
[53:43] shall be damned
[53:47] but remember all nations the bible says
[53:50] are going to be guilty of
[53:51] living in iniquity let's look at
[53:55] go to revelation 14 18 acacia
[53:58] i just want to remind us of this
[54:03] i believe in praying for america as i
[54:05] told you i prayed for america more than
[54:06] i ever had before
[54:09] but eventually america is going to be
[54:11] fully given over to iniquity
[54:13] most of it is already revelation 14
[54:17] 8 let's look at these these
[54:20] say all nations
[54:26] and there fouled another angel saying
[54:27] babylon has fallen his fallen that great
[54:29] city because
[54:30] she made all nations drink of the wine
[54:33] of the wrath
[54:34] of her fornication remember the bible
[54:36] said she was judged because
[54:38] her iniquities are remembered in heaven
[54:41] so through the roman catholic church
[54:42] through her religious uh
[54:44] teachings and through her daughters she
[54:47] spreads her fornication her idolatry her
[54:50] uh all of her evil works that she does
[54:54] she spreads it to all nations and
[54:56] they're all deceived oh we're religious
[54:58] we have churches and yet it's deception
[55:03] 18 3. can you pull it up honey
[55:04] revelation 18 3 and then revelation
[55:07] 18 23
[55:11] revelation 18 3
[55:16] for all nations have drunk of the wine
[55:18] of the wrath of her fornication
[55:21] and the kings of the earth have
[55:22] committed fornication with her
[55:24] and the merchants of the earth are wax
[55:26] rich through the abundance
[55:28] of her delicious delicacies now i don't
[55:30] have that all figured out how does the
[55:32] roman catholic church
[55:33] uh work with the economy i don't have
[55:36] that figured out brother branham i just
[55:38] heard him say this week he says it's
[55:39] because catholics own all the businesses
[55:41] now that may be true
[55:42] that's the best answer i could come up
[55:43] with
[55:45] but i don't have that all figured out
[55:46] but verse 23 18 23
[55:51] this leaven goes as leaven does it
[55:53] spreads through the entire world
[55:55] and the light of the candle shall shine
[55:57] no more at all in thee
[55:58] and the voice of the bridegroom christ
[56:01] and of the bride
[56:02] shall be heard no more at all in thee
[56:04] why because he christ takes her out of
[56:06] the world praise god
[56:07] christ raptures his bride right the
[56:10] bridegroom
[56:10] raptures the bride out so the voice of
[56:12] god is not heard anymore
[56:16] for thy merchants were thy great men of
[56:18] the earth for by thy sorceries were
[56:20] all nations deceived
[56:24] so i don't know if you caught that
[56:25] church but denominations
[56:27] they're sorcerers right they put a
[56:30] sorcery
[56:31] of sin on them that they to love sin
[56:38] like i saw my mom and dad i'll just get
[56:39] back back to my testimony i saw my mom
[56:41] and dad argue back and forth
[56:44] about sin and my dad would bring up
[56:46] things how the the church we were raised
[56:47] in was getting off the word now there
[56:49] was good people in there
[56:50] but they got off the word and pretty
[56:53] soon
[56:53] uh pretty soon they started letting
[56:55] people watch the wrong movies
[56:58] and by the time cam left and then they
[57:01] they got rid of their sunday night
[57:03] services and they just made fellowships
[57:05] where they watch football on sunday
[57:07] nights
[57:09] i mean just just licensing immorality
[57:12] right
[57:12] just trying to keep the people together
[57:16] and you can see how it spreads and it's
[57:18] it's a it's a type of witchcraft ma
[57:21] it's a type of somehow the evil spirits
[57:24] are spreading and
[57:25] and and putting a spell over people
[57:29] nigh through the witchcraft
[57:34] now that's something else i gotta like
[57:35] to study more on that by god's grace
[57:38] but the bible says uses sorceries
[57:41] evil spirits spells upon people
[57:45] through the churches so somehow as those
[57:48] ministers are preaching
[57:50] somehow they're laying down like a
[57:51] lukewarmness sorcery
[57:55] some type of lukewarmness and some type
[57:57] of sin loving message
[57:58] where they love to hear that message the
[58:00] bible says they'll have itching ears
[58:02] give us preachers that let us enjoy sin
[58:05] ah give us men of god with swords praise
[58:08] god
[58:09] amen not with the not with feathers to
[58:12] tickle ears
[58:13] that's not the kind of men we want we
[58:14] want men with swords amen
[58:16] amen to cut away this
[58:19] uncircumcised hearts praise god amen
[58:23] to cut away the worldly habits right the
[58:26] iniquity habits to cut those away
[58:30] and set us free praise god so the
[58:36] question comes which
[58:37] the confusion about iniquity is which
[58:39] actions lead
[58:42] to habitual iniquity
[58:46] and which actions lead to jesus
[58:49] officially calling somebody you are a
[58:52] worker of iniquity can you imagine that
[58:54] listen we're all we all we all have
[58:56] works right you all have a work you're
[58:58] working somewhere right
[59:00] some people different businesses but all
[59:02] of us work with works in our home and
[59:04] our friends in our church
[59:06] but jesus he gets so fed up with the
[59:08] lukewarm
[59:09] and these other ones that he says you're
[59:11] a worker of iniquity
[59:13] he assigns them a title they're so
[59:15] faithful to their iniquity
[59:17] he says that's all you work for oh my
[59:20] god help us to work for the kingdom of
[59:22] god
[59:24] so the question is the confusion is
[59:26] which actions actually lead
[59:29] to habitual iniquity
[59:32] that allows jesus to call people workers
[59:35] of iniquity
[59:36] do you know the scripture uses that 30
[59:38] times 30 times it's mostly in the old
[59:40] testament
[59:41] where god calls israel workers of
[59:43] iniquity what they do
[59:44] set up idols they just brought the idols
[59:47] in
[59:47] they stopped doing the sacrifices to god
[59:49] oh let's let us enjoy the sacrifices of
[59:52] god church you get to come here and
[59:53] sacrifice to god
[59:55] to lift your voice and clap your hands
[59:57] and praise god and worship god
[59:59] let us be content with the sacrifice of
[1:00:01] god amen
[1:00:04] but the old testament those sacrifices
[1:00:06] they replaced sacrifices to god
[1:00:09] and they would worship idols
[1:00:15] so 30 times over 30 times the scripture
[1:00:18] says
[1:00:19] worker of iniquity how do you become a
[1:00:21] worker of iniquity that's what we'll get
[1:00:22] to the next few weeks lord willing
[1:00:25] well first they're led by false
[1:00:27] preachers so the preachers are
[1:00:29] first the leaders of iniquity
[1:00:33] uh go to second corinthians 11 13-14
[1:00:37] acacia ii is 11
[1:00:38] 13-14 satan has to start somewhere
[1:00:42] and so most of the time he starts with
[1:00:44] the preachers
[1:00:50] and satan comes and he hides behind the
[1:00:53] pulpit
[1:00:54] and he looks so holy he looks so bright
[1:00:57] it looks so
[1:00:58] so pure
[1:01:04] how do you know it by their fruits you
[1:01:05] know them
[1:01:07] the fruits of the preachers lives
[1:01:10] that's why church many times i don't
[1:01:12] mind i'll bash
[1:01:13] certain doctrines preachers are
[1:01:15] preaching because i know
[1:01:17] it's not the preacher really it's satan
[1:01:21] where does satan want to get he wants to
[1:01:22] get where he can influence the people
[1:01:24] the most how does he do that
[1:01:25] through the local pastors that's why i
[1:01:28] believe that jeffersonville movement is
[1:01:29] a
[1:01:29] telling preacher pastors to sit down
[1:01:31] because pastor is the gift that affects
[1:01:33] most people
[1:01:35] if they can get that pastor to sit down
[1:01:40] play the taste what they do after they
[1:01:41] play the tapes they come up and inject
[1:01:42] their own ideas
[1:01:43] every word is thus saith the lord
[1:01:45] joseph's your pastor instead of
[1:01:47] your regular pastor now you're taking
[1:01:50] headship from someone who's not your
[1:01:51] pastor
[1:01:53] and that's the start of it remember it
[1:01:54] always starts small it always starts
[1:01:56] really simple
[1:01:57] small but then that that leaven grows
[1:02:01] and produces over years and decades it
[1:02:03] grows into something
[1:02:06] for such are false apostles deceitful
[1:02:09] workers seek workers
[1:02:10] watch people's works transforming
[1:02:13] themselves
[1:02:14] into the apostles of christ this
[1:02:16] happened all down through the church
[1:02:17] ages if you've read
[1:02:18] if you ever read the church ages lately
[1:02:20] they were saying we're apostles and
[1:02:22] and jesus said they're not they're liars
[1:02:25] they're not apostles
[1:02:28] and make no marvel for satan himself is
[1:02:30] transformed
[1:02:31] into an angel of life church who is
[1:02:34] preaching behind the pulpits when they
[1:02:36] say it's okay for homosexuals to preach
[1:02:38] that's satan that is satan
[1:02:42] he's doing anything he can do to get
[1:02:45] behind the pulp
[1:02:46] and take control and try to influence
[1:02:48] the people but that's what they want to
[1:02:49] hear
[1:02:50] because if they didn't they'd walk out
[1:02:55] see but they love that they love the the
[1:02:57] world they love the big crowds and they
[1:02:59] love the
[1:03:00] uh the pleasures of unrighteousness
[1:03:05] so where does satan go he goes to the
[1:03:08] preachers
[1:03:10] gives them false doctrine satan
[1:03:13] transforms himself
[1:03:14] into a preacher behind the pulpit god
[1:03:16] help us
[1:03:20] they know the truth but they preach lies
[1:03:24] and they fight against the truth the
[1:03:26] scripture says they're more willing to
[1:03:28] believe lies rather than the bible truth
[1:03:30] praise god
[1:03:33] now i'm going to as this chapter goes on
[1:03:35] i might identify specific
[1:03:37] uh acts of iniquity because the bible
[1:03:40] defines them as you read the scripture
[1:03:42] the bible defines specific acts of
[1:03:44] iniquity
[1:03:45] and then in the book i say i say this
[1:03:48] you can
[1:03:49] you can choose which group to be a part
[1:03:52] of
[1:03:53] and in the book i go through different
[1:03:54] denominations and list their iniquities
[1:03:57] oh my and see so god's wisdom
[1:04:01] will help us to leave iniquity
[1:04:04] and the bible says in second timothy 2
[1:04:07] 22
[1:04:08] that we will follow righteousness faith
[1:04:11] charity peace
[1:04:12] within that call on god out of a pure
[1:04:15] heart
[1:04:16] have you listened to some of these
[1:04:17] preachers you can hear them preach and
[1:04:19] talk and there's no purity in them
[1:04:21] there's no purity they're just reciting
[1:04:24] things you can can't you feel sometimes
[1:04:27] i'm talking about denominations you know
[1:04:29] you listen if you haven't listened to
[1:04:30] catholic priests listen to one soon you
[1:04:32] know
[1:04:32] most of them you don't hear the purity
[1:04:35] of a pure heart
[1:04:38] you hear like a political talk like
[1:04:40] brother man says
[1:04:41] you hear something else like for money
[1:04:44] right or prosperity
[1:04:46] you don't really it seems fake it
[1:04:49] doesn't even feel like is that
[1:04:50] real but church i want to have such
[1:04:53] sincerity
[1:04:54] that i can be honest before you i can be
[1:04:56] honest before god
[1:04:58] and that if there's something in our
[1:05:00] lives the holy spirit can deal with it
[1:05:02] and cut it off and get get rid of it so
[1:05:04] that we can walk before god
[1:05:06] in all pleasing manner
[1:05:09] the purity follow them that call on god
[1:05:12] out of a pure heart
[1:05:15] that really come to church and say in
[1:05:17] all purity lord i want to be closer to
[1:05:19] you
[1:05:19] not just say that but they really want
[1:05:22] to be closer to god
[1:05:24] pure that means they're going to go home
[1:05:26] tonight and do something about it
[1:05:28] amen praise god tomorrow morning they'll
[1:05:31] do something about it because it's a
[1:05:32] pure heart
[1:05:34] it's not defiled
[1:05:38] the bible says call follow them that
[1:05:41] call on god
[1:05:42] out of a pure heart
[1:05:46] praise god and so in the book now i
[1:05:50] begin with
[1:05:50] satan the father of iniquity to show
[1:05:52] where iniquity started
[1:05:55] jesus we saw he's the very epitome of
[1:05:58] godliness he is what
[1:06:00] it's his holiness right it's his faith
[1:06:01] his virtue he's the epitome of godliness
[1:06:04] but satan is the opposite the epitome
[1:06:07] of iniquity
[1:06:10] and he's leading billions into it
[1:06:12] imagine that church billions
[1:06:14] into it
[1:06:18] so here i got about uh five minutes here
[1:06:20] so let me just go through a few things
[1:06:21] about the the enemy here
[1:06:24] now this is the perfect chapter where i
[1:06:25] put serpent seed in here so i'm not
[1:06:27] gonna preach that most of ever
[1:06:28] all of us understand that uh but let's
[1:06:30] look at a few of satan's attributes here
[1:06:32] real quick
[1:06:33] now the word lucifer means lightbearer
[1:06:36] so he's one that bears light he
[1:06:38] possesses light
[1:06:41] so lucifer's name means light bear he
[1:06:44] holds the light look at that all god's
[1:06:45] angels
[1:06:46] are just reflecting his light god's
[1:06:48] light
[1:06:50] remember satan transforms himself into
[1:06:53] an angel of light
[1:06:56] but his lies enslave the souls in
[1:06:59] darkness
[1:07:02] ezekiel 29 says he began as the most
[1:07:04] bright beautiful angel
[1:07:06] he was equipped for music ministry in
[1:07:08] heaven
[1:07:10] he was the anointed cherub set by god to
[1:07:12] be covering around the throne
[1:07:14] uh michael and the other uh michael was
[1:07:17] probably the other cherub around god's
[1:07:18] throne
[1:07:20] because as moses had two cherubims there
[1:07:23] by the throne of god
[1:07:25] the bible said he was satan was perfect
[1:07:27] in every way
[1:07:28] until iniquity was found in him
[1:07:32] his heart was lifted up because of his
[1:07:36] brightness
[1:07:37] and his beauty
[1:07:42] so the whole beginning of iniquity
[1:07:44] starts where it starts in the heart of
[1:07:46] satan
[1:07:49] where does this mystery of iniquity
[1:07:50] start the very heart of the father of
[1:07:52] iniquity
[1:07:53] starts in his heart
[1:07:57] aren't you glad church you got a new
[1:07:58] heart ezekiel said you'll get a
[1:08:00] new heart new spirit and then my spirit
[1:08:04] praise god amen
[1:08:06] we need a new heart because our own
[1:08:07] heart was full of inequity
[1:08:15] but he looked at himself and said my i
[1:08:18] sure am bright
[1:08:19] i am beautiful look at this
[1:08:22] i'm really something is that how you
[1:08:25] look in the mirror in the morning
[1:08:27] that's not how i look in here but he
[1:08:30] said ma i am
[1:08:31] look how bright i am i imagine he just
[1:08:34] had a little more brightness than
[1:08:35] michael
[1:08:37] he was the perfect of all the angels the
[1:08:40] most beautiful of all the angels
[1:08:45] so his iniquity corrupted his wisdom
[1:08:50] he was very wise he was perfect in every
[1:08:52] way
[1:08:54] but his his iniquity corrupts
[1:08:57] wisdom now let's read isaiah 14
[1:09:02] 13 and 14. this reveals his wicked
[1:09:05] thoughts to exalt himself
[1:09:07] to be like god
[1:09:11] remember church i'm gonna go back to
[1:09:12] this that was the very lie of the
[1:09:13] serpent in the garden
[1:09:15] that was his lie to eve you're the
[1:09:17] absolute eve
[1:09:19] you're the absolute you can be like god
[1:09:21] you can know
[1:09:22] good and evil so see this battle about
[1:09:25] the absolute
[1:09:26] is brother brown the absolute is the
[1:09:27] message the absolute is god who's the
[1:09:29] absolute
[1:09:29] this battle is the same battle we've
[1:09:31] been fighting all along
[1:09:33] jesus christ is the absolute amount
[1:09:35] brother branham pointed us to the
[1:09:37] absolute praise god
[1:09:38] right the bible points us to the
[1:09:40] absolute bible is the absolute right but
[1:09:42] we know the absolute really is the
[1:09:43] spirit praise god
[1:09:45] and this is the word of the holy spirit
[1:09:47] on paper yes it's our absolute on paper
[1:09:50] no doubt about that
[1:09:51] but it's pointing to one person the the
[1:09:53] person who is the absolute jesus christ
[1:09:57] so isaiah 14 13 here's his wicked
[1:10:01] thoughts for thou has said in thine
[1:10:02] heart
[1:10:03] i will ascend into heaven i will exalt
[1:10:06] my throne above the stars of god
[1:10:08] i will sit upon the mount of the
[1:10:09] congregation in the sides of the north
[1:10:11] i will ascend above the heights of the
[1:10:12] clouds i will be like the most high
[1:10:16] may god grant all of us contentment
[1:10:19] you know americans want to aim high
[1:10:21] right americans want promotions
[1:10:22] americans want more more
[1:10:24] higher higher higher but we got to be
[1:10:26] very careful with those
[1:10:28] because satan's very the very thought of
[1:10:30] his iniquity was
[1:10:31] i need to go higher this position isn't
[1:10:34] good enough for me
[1:10:35] i look at i'm deserving of more i'm
[1:10:38] deserving to be like god
[1:10:41] this is the very thought of iniquity i
[1:10:44] need a place that's not mine
[1:10:45] i need a bigger i need better
[1:10:51] and his place was to be i want to be
[1:10:53] just like god
[1:10:57] the member church he said i will six
[1:10:59] times
[1:11:01] six six times
[1:11:04] in iniquity he said i will i will i will
[1:11:08] and this is completely opposite to
[1:11:10] christ who said thy will
[1:11:12] it's not the i will it's the thy will
[1:11:16] that god loves that's so that's the
[1:11:17] prayer church let's examine your prayers
[1:11:20] real
[1:11:20] for a moment if you're praying i want i
[1:11:23] want i want
[1:11:24] right let's change that to what what do
[1:11:26] you want lord what do you want
[1:11:28] give me what you want five more minutes
[1:11:31] here
[1:11:34] that's the prayer that's how the prayers
[1:11:35] have to change not what i want but what
[1:11:38] god wants
[1:11:40] because i will leads to iniquity thy
[1:11:43] will
[1:11:44] leads to godliness praise god amen
[1:11:48] jesus directly rebukes satan for
[1:11:50] regarding only his will
[1:11:52] rather than god's will in matthew 16 23
[1:11:56] he said get thee behind me satan for
[1:11:58] thou art an offense unto me
[1:12:00] for thou savers not the things that be
[1:12:02] of god
[1:12:03] but for those that be of men
[1:12:07] satan loved the things of man satan
[1:12:09] loved the things of the world
[1:12:11] rather than the things of god and jesus
[1:12:12] rebuked him for it oh
[1:12:14] my my god help us to set our affections
[1:12:16] on things above
[1:12:18] praise god but satan loves the things of
[1:12:21] the earth
[1:12:23] i will i will i want i see more i see
[1:12:27] higher
[1:12:27] i got to go higher that's nothing wrong
[1:12:29] with desiring to do more for god
[1:12:31] i hope everybody understands that
[1:12:32] there's nothing wrong with when you see
[1:12:33] your talents increase nothing wrong with
[1:12:35] that but when it's selfish and when it's
[1:12:37] outside the will of god that's iniquity
[1:12:40] satan proves it there because his his
[1:12:42] heart was where iniquity first formed
[1:12:45] the first sin the first sin of the whole
[1:12:48] history right
[1:12:48] the first sin of all the universe was i
[1:12:51] will be like the most god i will exalt
[1:12:53] myself
[1:12:53] higher than where god has wanted me to
[1:12:55] go
[1:12:57] godliness with contentment is what
[1:12:59] church what is it godliness contentment
[1:13:01] is
[1:13:02] greek being content with where god has
[1:13:06] placed you
[1:13:10] revelation 12 shows satan's rebellion he
[1:13:13] led the first
[1:13:14] church split so how we treat one another
[1:13:17] is so important
[1:13:20] also he's given titles of a great red
[1:13:22] dragon
[1:13:24] old serpent devil satan accuser of the
[1:13:26] brethren on this text
[1:13:29] jesus said he's a liar and the father of
[1:13:32] lies
[1:13:34] he convinced a third of the angels to
[1:13:37] join his war against michael
[1:13:39] and the holy angels thank god
[1:13:43] michael's army prevailed praise god
[1:13:45] church let me say like this
[1:13:46] the truth will prevail don't get
[1:13:48] discouraged sometimes in my mind i
[1:13:50] wonder
[1:13:50] what is what's going to happen what's
[1:13:51] going to happen but church we know
[1:13:53] truth always wins amen you might have to
[1:13:56] wait a little bit longer but truth
[1:13:58] will prevail hallelujah
[1:14:05] and after losing the battle in heaven to
[1:14:07] michael
[1:14:08] the very next thing we do is seeing him
[1:14:11] deceive and beguile a virgin
[1:14:15] trying to pervert a virgin's life
[1:14:19] now church i just real quick just went
[1:14:21] through satan's characteristics
[1:14:23] these are some of his main
