[28:46] thank you brother Malachi lovely sister
[28:48] Lily Lydia god bless your heart I've got
[28:55] to look kind of a
[28:56] a preparation study this morning I
[29:01] believe the bride is slowly but surely
[29:06] awakening to this hour I want to hit
[29:11] just prepare for something by God's
[29:14] grace many promises in this day saints
[29:20] of God this world is falling apart this
[29:23] thing is getting so close
[29:25] I just heard rumor through a YouTube
[29:29] video a brother had sent me the North
[29:32] Star supposedly has moved three to five
[29:35] degrees the North Star as our prophesied
[29:40] easy that was the absolute he said that
[29:41] was a type of Christ he's that was a
[29:43] type of the Holy Ghost because it
[29:44] remains constant in the heavens a sailor
[29:47] a traveler in the old days they would
[29:48] look to that North Star and find out and
[29:50] be able to calculate they were leon now
[29:52] they're saying it's mood and if you look
[29:55] at the sunset it's actually setting a
[29:56] different location now a little bit more
[29:58] northern didn't Jesus say that the end
[30:03] he said he says our shaken not only the
[30:05] heavens but I'll shake the earth also
[30:07] everything that can be shaken everything
[30:10] that can be fallen down every broken
[30:12] branch or weak branch weak tree dead
[30:14] tree will be able to will be falling in
[30:16] this time we must make sure that our
[30:19] house is founded on the solid rock of
[30:24] Revelation amen
[30:27] let's get into this by God's grace I
[30:29] want to keep you holding held enter in
[30:36] here hold you a little thought the
[30:41] Lord's dealt with me he's given me a
[30:43] couple ideas here a couple months back I
[30:45] believe some revelations we want to
[30:48] touch on the shadow today by God's grace
[30:53] hope it's a blessing sorry I've got to
[31:02] old laptop here is she people keeps on
[31:04] rolling she's old it takes a little bit
[31:11] to load there's my precious family by
[31:13] God's grace they're all coming somebody
[31:21] at church was saying something after
[31:22] service about how Rahab had her scarlet
[31:25] thread and how she hung it out her
[31:27] window and she got all her family into
[31:29] that house and as the brother said it
[31:33] I had bought I had gotten my
[31:34] sister-in-law a scarf from Thailand and
[31:36] they had a little red threads and they
[31:38] were started they weren't fully stitched
[31:40] in it was cheap and they started falling
[31:42] everywhere and as soon as the brother
[31:44] said that we looked down and there was
[31:45] three of them little red and threads and
[31:47] I grabbed my real quick eye stuff to
[31:50] write my Bible I said that was let's say
[31:52] the Lord I'm claiming my family everyone
[31:54] we're going in this rapture every one of
[31:58] them by the grace of God you just have
[32:01] to believe all things are possible to
[32:05] those that believe if you could turn to
[32:08] proverbs 18:10 hope this is all right
[32:16] I'm just this is a little prep prep
[32:19] sermon for something maybe look great
[32:22] coming in the future we want to be ready
[32:25] but I want to plant these seeds in our
[32:26] hearts because anything's possible
[32:30] the mind of God is so deep it's so full
[32:34] that's so wise it's so untouchable
[32:38] unsearchable are his ways the Bible said
[32:40] we want to prep everything if God has a
[32:43] promise in the scripture coming we want
[32:45] it for us but if we're not looking for
[32:48] it just like his coming his rapture
[32:51] we're like looking for his coming we'll
[32:52] miss it
[32:53] he said watch and pray we must get into
[32:56] the spirit of the word in of our day
[32:59] Noah's message ain't gonna save us this
[33:02] time Moses message will not save us this
[33:04] time John the Baptist message will not
[33:07] save us this time we have to come to the
[33:10] message of our hour says here proverbs
[33:14] 18:10 you can have receipts after
[33:16] the name of the Lord is a strong tower
[33:18] the righteous run thin to it and is safe
[33:22] let's actually bow our heads real quick
[33:25] dearly father Lord Jesus Lord Lord you
[33:28] know how you gave me this little Sunday
[33:29] School Lord here a little study I know
[33:32] we want to run this Lord and show the
[33:34] people Lord you've got your something
[33:36] great in store for us we just love you
[33:38] be with each heart Lord call me
[33:40] everything God heal every infirmity God
[33:42] we rebuke any spirit Lourdes contra to
[33:44] your word Lord may leave right now it's
[33:47] not welcome here but Lord we welcome the
[33:49] Holy Ghost your spirit your person or
[33:52] who you are Lord we want you to be here
[33:54] present we that we love your Lord just
[33:56] take full control this little vessel
[33:57] here god bless the people Lord hears the
[34:00] word blessed God granite in the name
[34:02] Jesus Christ Eman you may have your
[34:04] seats it says the name of the Lord is a
[34:08] strong tower the righteous run off into
[34:12] it and is safe why are they running into
[34:16] it because it looks like they need
[34:18] safety looks like a danger has arisen
[34:23] looks like a trial a tribulation maybe
[34:26] has arisen it and they need to find a
[34:28] place of refuge and the Bible says the
[34:31] name of the Lord is a strong tower
[34:33] absolutely doesn't say a weak one or one
[34:36] that's kind of good but it says it's
[34:38] strong tower man and it's just it's not
[34:40] a natural tower but it's actually the
[34:43] very name the power of the name we run
[34:46] into that name right so this morning I'd
[34:51] like to teach on by the grace of God let
[34:54] me see if I can get this little mouse to
[34:56] work here I'd like to teach on a strong
[34:58] tower a strong tower I'll read these
[35:05] other scriptures and proverbs 30 verse 4
[35:07] he says who asked ascended up into
[35:09] heaven or descent it is this not the
[35:12] disciples asked about Jesus who John the
[35:15] Baptist and who he was and this that
[35:17] Jesus as the Son of Man that which has
[35:18] come down from everything has also a
[35:20] sent it up into heaven when the Son of
[35:22] God appeared on earth he did he spoke
[35:25] from this scripture says who has
[35:26] gathered the wind in his fist
[35:28] who has bound
[35:29] waters in the Garmon who established all
[35:31] the ends of the earth
[35:32] what isn't his name and what is his
[35:36] son's name if thou canst tell
[35:41] interesting scripture here the name of
[35:45] God the name of Jesus Christ we know as
[35:50] the sons name but it's also the father's
[35:52] name as well correct and a Bible says
[35:55] every word is if God is pure he is the
[35:57] shield unto them that put their trust in
[35:59] him amen
[36:00] but to put their trust in him you must
[36:02] know their name if you need a plumber a
[36:04] little plumber to get in your crawlspace
[36:05] if you say hey brother and I I don't
[36:08] recognize that name brother but if you
[36:11] call me by name I'm like yes sir you can
[36:14] say me say sigh get in this cross base
[36:16] now fix this pipe payment but if you
[36:19] have to call me my name so I can get
[36:21] into your plumbing fix this leak or fix
[36:24] that sanitary line of this water line is
[36:26] heating line absolutely he says and now
[36:29] and not unto his words lest he reprove
[36:32] thee and thou found to be a what a liar
[36:37] sure it says a good name is rather to be
[36:43] chosen than great riches and loving
[36:46] favor rather than silver and gold saints
[36:49] of God
[36:50] check our names this morning we've had a
[36:53] name change as well as what missus Jesus
[36:56] Christ a man it's not absolutely we're
[36:59] no longer just an espoused one but now
[37:02] he said what call them bride absolutely
[37:04] and the bride takes on the name of the
[37:06] husband Ecclesiastes 7 1 he's a good
[37:09] name is better than precious ointment
[37:11] and the day of death than 1 days of one
[37:14] birth absolutely so good name is good
[37:16] for you absolutely as mean a brother
[37:20] were sitting around his name is you've
[37:22] been here before he gave his testimony
[37:23] but your pastor had actually put his
[37:25] testimony online brother mike.mccluskey
[37:28] young convert about a year and a half
[37:31] ago the Lord led him right to his my
[37:32] right led me right to his house put me
[37:34] right on his doorstep one a right to the
[37:36] Lord and I said brother Mike what does
[37:38] your name mean and the name McCroskey
[37:40] means
[37:41] out and strong and if you ever might
[37:45] wear the mike.mccluskey he's loud and
[37:47] he's strong he's got a powerful voice
[37:49] but originated from he says the bearer
[37:52] of that name originally was a man who is
[37:54] fierce in battle and able to make
[37:57] himself when he's heard in the throng of
[37:59] battle so that name was originated from
[38:02] a man that while he's out slaying the
[38:04] enemy this man he was loud and he just
[38:06] let her know but he was strong and loud
[38:08] absolutely and that's the origination
[38:10] the origin of his name a good name is
[38:14] more precious than diamond a good name
[38:17] is to be favored absolutely look at
[38:21] Genesis 1:1 in the beginning God before
[38:27] creation before Genesis 1 warning he did
[38:30] not identify there was no one to
[38:32] identify himself with he dwelt alone all
[38:36] by himself the self existing one correct
[38:40] God in the beginning god but as soon as
[38:43] time broke forth as soon as he claimed
[38:45] the angels of heaven
[38:46] absolutely he's created all his
[38:48] cherubims and seraphim's the zooms and
[38:50] all the all these all these creatures
[38:52] that we hardly haven't seen except on
[38:55] probably we've seen more demon ones on
[38:56] television and movies than anything else
[38:59] but he then at Atlas creation he comes
[39:02] and reveals himself as God and that's
[39:07] the first name he gives himself to his
[39:11] creation is God that were God is from
[39:14] Elohim it means God or angels great
[39:19] judge he's a mighty but then that stems
[39:22] from Aloha which is the deity God we
[39:26] know deity means God absolutely so he
[39:29] reveals himself to his angels as God the
[39:32] deity the great one the mighty one and
[39:35] that's how he chose to identify himself
[39:38] first as I am your Creator is what he's
[39:43] saying the name just the word God means
[39:46] what object of worship so not only is he
[39:51] Lord of all and India t but he doesn't
[39:53] mean demands our worship
[39:56] it's song to Solomon he says identifies
[39:59] himself what as he says The Rose of
[40:01] Sharon and the lily the valleys
[40:03] absolutely
[40:04] he picks something naturally he had
[40:06] created he says I'm just like this and
[40:07] I'm just like that absolutely is the
[40:10] Rose of Sharon Lillian valleys in first
[40:12] Timothy 613 he says I give thee charge
[40:14] in the sight of God who quickens all
[40:16] things before Christ Jesus who before
[40:18] Pontius Pilate witnessed a good
[40:21] confession he brings pathes Pilate in
[40:23] towards that he was the great one but
[40:25] that now in verse 15 he says which is
[40:28] times past times which in his times he
[40:30] shall shew who is the blessed and only
[40:33] potentate the king of kings and Lord of
[40:36] lords so now Paul identifies himself
[40:38] Pontius Pilate was not that important 8
[40:41] the port state means an officer or ruler
[40:43] of one having great Authority and mighty
[40:45] but in Jesus Christ was the true
[40:47] potentate a man yes sir
[40:50] he's the king of kings in the Lord amen
[40:52] yes sir a man sure
[40:55] now in Revelations 1 he starts out
[40:57] bringing these things to John Christ has
[41:01] now come down redeemed the people he's
[41:04] done everything he's paid the price on
[41:06] Calvary shed his blood for us he sent us
[41:09] the life that was in the blood back onto
[41:11] the people but now here over almost 100
[41:14] years 70 years from that time now he's
[41:17] bringing the beginning to work with John
[41:19] and he says he tells John that he's the
[41:21] Alpha and the Omega the beginning and
[41:24] the end which was Jesus sayeth the Lord
[41:27] which was and is and which is to come
[41:28] the Almighty he's revealing himself more
[41:32] and more now to the what the Gentiles
[41:35] verse 11 says even pizzas Alpha the
[41:39] Omega the first and the last in
[41:42] Revelations 2:18 is the first to the
[41:45] last and that was his dead is now alive
[41:46] he's picking all these titles and names
[41:49] to reveal himself to his people in verse
[41:51] 12 he says he says not only does he have
[41:53] these names he said but he comes with a
[41:55] sharp sword which has two inches amen
[41:58] so he's not a powerless God but he's one
[42:00] full of strength and power and weapon
[42:02] jure everything he has can be also
[42:05] yielded to you as well if you pour on
[42:06] the Word of God absolutely
[42:09] if you pull on God himself notice here
[42:12] in the thigh tyrion Church H under
[42:15] Columba in Revelations 2 and verse 22 he
[42:18] says and I will give him the morning
[42:20] star who is that morning star it's Jesus
[42:24] Christ and you study the histories this
[42:28] was the thigh tyrant church age and the
[42:31] very next shirt age was what Luther's
[42:34] church age which one that lie that
[42:38] Brydon morning started now started
[42:40] shining his light pulling the people out
[42:42] of Catholicism absolutely because that's
[42:45] when the first that's when the
[42:46] Reformation started was when Luther's
[42:48] age and and what Christ started to rise
[42:51] up and shed his light on his word and
[42:53] revealed the just shall live by faith
[42:55] they man praise be to God what it was
[42:58] promised if you were come what I'll send
[43:00] that Morningstar back absolutely but
[43:02] where was the morning star was at the
[43:04] body of Christ was at the flesh now is
[43:07] Christ back to low gas form a man back
[43:10] to light former shows what that low
[43:12] ghost was rising up once again amen and
[43:15] it lit its way in Luther's day in
[43:17] Wesley's day Azusa Street there was a
[43:20] fire seen above that big building they
[43:22] were under and worshiping but then
[43:24] remember in this day in 19 and 51 that
[43:26] pillar of fire was seen finally a man
[43:29] there morning started risen now and it
[43:32] displayed itself above the Prophet Amen
[43:34] praise be to God showing whether it
[43:36] started right there
[43:37] a man in Revelations three seven in the
[43:41] age of the church and Lela filled up he
[43:42] said write these things saith he that is
[43:44] holy and is true so reveals himself as
[43:47] the holy God the sinless Scott the one
[43:50] that is perfect he's holy and he's true
[43:52] there's no lie in him there's no
[43:54] deception in him Amen praise be to God
[43:56] then now looking revelations 3:14 he
[43:59] says and to the angel the church age of
[44:01] lair of scenes write these things saith
[44:03] what he says da man
[44:05] Amen the faithful and true witness the
[44:09] beginning of the creation of God so
[44:11] slowly is revealing himself more and
[44:14] more he's giving more names more
[44:16] descriptions details about himself he's
[44:19] unfill folding to the bride
[44:21] in this day in Revelations 19:11 and I
[44:28] saw heavens open and behold a white
[44:29] horse and hidden upon a horse said upon
[44:32] him was called faithful and true once
[44:35] again and in righteous he does make
[44:37] judge and make war and then in verse 13
[44:40] says in he was clothed with a vesture
[44:42] dipped in blood and his name is called
[44:44] the Word of God amen he brings it all
[44:46] the way back to what the John 1:1 and
[44:49] the revelations 19 verse 16 is and he
[44:51] that has this vessels on his thigh a
[44:53] name written king of kings and Lord of

[44:59] letting him know never forget who the
[45:02] king and Lord of lords is the king of
[45:04] kings and Lord of lords the Alpha he's
[45:06] repeating all these things for our sakes

[45:18] the beginning the end the first and the
[45:21] last they met he what he starts that way

[47:03] man here's all these things he's
[47:07] identified well all Scripture is given
[47:08] by the inspiration of the Holy Ghost

[47:16] mind saying I'm coming like this I'm
[47:18] being like this this is how you know me
[47:20] this identify myself Hebrews 3:1
[47:28] wherefore holy brethren partakers of the

[47:35] profession Jesus Christ he calls him the
[47:38] Apostle Paul's the apostle of apostles
[47:41] but he said Jesus Christ started the
[47:42] church and no man could stop Jesus
[47:46] Christ grabbed 12 men what it was a
[47:48] devil but he used those eleven and
[47:50] bought Paul in is what he started a
[47:52] church right there and look it's
[47:53] continued here we are two thousand years
[47:55] later he's the great apostle he's the
[47:57] one he's the soul winner
[47:59] he grabbed the leaven that formed
[48:00] millions upon millions and millions and
[48:02] billions of Christian stemmed out of
[48:05] that original Church the Apostle Jesus
[48:08] Christ
[48:08] a man in John 136 the Prophet John says
[48:13] in looking upon Jesus as he watches
[48:14] behold the lamb of God amen the one that
[48:19] takes away in the sins of the world I
[48:21] mean the Giants all salvation coming yes
[48:28] Lord you ever see that mystery you ever
[48:34] see the mystery of Israel where was this
[48:36] prophesied of men
[48:40] in Ephesians 4 it said Paul is breaking
[48:48] down the bride in Christ he said this is
[48:50] a great mystery
[48:50] he says fresh and flashier bone of my
[48:52] bone he's dealing with the Gentile
[48:54] church and he goes all the way back to
[48:55] Genesis were Eve comes Eve is pulled out
[48:58] of Adam and Adam identifies Eva said
[49:02] this is bone and my bowling my flesh my
[49:03] flesh that was a type of the Gentile
[49:05] Church correct the Lamb of God that
[49:10] takes away the sin the world who is he
[49:12] who is he dealing with first who was
[49:13] that Lamb of God sent to Israel first
[49:16] where was the first prophecy that took
[49:18] place here I must go through listen for
[49:22] bonus Genesis go to Genesis let's just
[49:26] go on this little trail here I want to
[49:28] show you some how powerful the Word of
[49:29] God
[49:29] this just opened up a wheat a month and
[49:32] a half ago a month ago Genesis 3 notice
[49:46] at the fall at the fall Genesis 3 verse
[49:53] 6 and when the woman saw the tree was
[49:56] good for food and that it was pleasant
[49:58] to the eyes and a tree to be desired to
[50:00] make one wise she took of the fruit
[50:01] thereof and did eat and gave also unto
[50:04] her husband with her and he did eat and
[50:06] the eyes are both them were open and
[50:08] they knew that they were naked and they
[50:10] sewed fig leaves together who is the fig
[50:16] tree notice they didn't take fruit
[50:19] because there was no fruit all there was
[50:23] left on that tree was leaves and they
[50:25] wrapped himself showing what is showing
[50:28] that the Jewish religion would never do
[50:30] never do it would never fully cover his
[50:33] bride amen
[50:36] Jesus said salvation is of the Jews how
[50:39] come these fig leaves didn't cover
[50:41] because it was a set of the bloodless
[50:43] religion a man so what God takes it
[50:46] takes the Jewish religion off and what
[50:49] it leaves the leaves there
[50:51] and then what takes a landlady and
[50:53] covers it with the skin of the lamb
[50:56] showing that the Gentile or sorry the
[50:59] Jedi were not the the Jewish religion
[51:03] the law would never fit his bride he was
[51:07] going to put her and something else
[51:08] hey man look prophesied all the way back
[51:11] here amen praise be to God now let's
[51:15] continue on Genesis 12 verse 1 so one
[51:18] throw that in there because it was
[51:19] showed it was prophesied they would go
[51:22] to the Jewish religion first but then it
[51:24] would have to come and change and go
[51:26] right into what the blood the life
[51:27] behind the sacrifice Genesis 12 verse 1
[51:33] Abraham's first Abraham's first
[51:35] encounter with God look how identifies
[51:37] him and now the Lord said unto Abraham
[51:41] Abram get thee out of thy country
[51:43] how does he identify himself to Abram
[51:47] Jehovah Jehovah that word Jehovah means
[51:51] self existing eternal God now the Lord
[51:57] said unto Abram now he's Jehovah right
[51:59] in the beginning of Genesis 1:1 he was
[52:02] God Elohim but now here he's reveals
[52:05] himself as Jehovah correct and he starts
[52:10] deal with Abraham Abraham was the father
[52:11] of the faith he was a Gentile correct
[52:13] now look next year waiting I have this
[52:18] out of order first encounter I don't
[52:23] have the scripture here I must have
[52:24] messed up but the very next time right
[52:26] at the name God gives Abraham a name
[52:30] change from Abram to Abraham but notice
[52:34] if you look in the scripture I don't
[52:36] think I have it written down here it's I
[52:37] think I missed it no I missed I didn't
[52:43] put it down but he reveals himself as a
[52:46] shell shanty I at the time of the name
[52:49] change and that l word el shaddai means
[52:52] the breasted one so to pull from God as
[52:56] our prophet Jesus and notice I am
[52:58] al-sharia he's your the weak little baby
[53:01] but lean upon my bosom my promise and
[53:03] nurse from me first
[53:04] Frankie was ninety and nine or ninety
[53:06] years old right around that time when he
[53:08] changed his name
[53:09] he says draw for me your strength I'm
[53:11] the creator that hung the heavens the
[53:12] earth put the Stars out yonder is
[53:14] anything too great for God I am El
[53:16] Shaddai I Jesus and you are my child
[53:18] though you are weak and I'm letting you
[53:20] go that way just to see what you'll do
[53:22] about it I'm going to make example he
[53:24] says for my people Hereafter that man
[53:26] will believe my word I'll stand by it no
[53:28] matter what it takes how long I'll do it
[53:30] I'll stand by it I'll shout it draw your
[53:33] strength from me so reveals himself
[53:36] first as Jehovah then he reveals himself
[53:38] as El Shaddai but then now as he as the
[53:41] promised son now comes he had to have a
[53:43] name change before the Sun came the Sun
[53:46] now comes and now God has revealed
[53:48] something else to him in his name this
[53:51] is what we're gonna go into is the seven
[53:53] compound redemptive names of God in
[53:57] Genesis 22 verse 1 it comes to what
[54:01] Abrahamic God comes he says and it came
[54:03] to pass everything that God did tempt
[54:05] Abraham and said unto Him Abraham he
[54:07] said Behold Here I am and he said now
[54:09] take take now thy son thine only son
[54:11] Isaac whom thou has lovest and get thee
[54:13] to land of Moriah and offer him there
[54:15] for a burnt offering unto the mountains
[54:17] which I tell thee so God chose him by
[54:20] vision what mountain what to do but then
[54:23] as we see in verse 5 Abraham said unto
[54:25] these young men abide ye here with the
[54:27] ass and I in the lad will go yonder and
[54:30] worship and come again to you so somehow
[54:32] through this vision he saw that he would
[54:34] come back with his son but God said go
[54:37] and slay your son on the altar right and
[54:40] he's raviga is now dealing with him
[54:42] November this is Holy Ghost field led or
[54:44] Holy Ghost leadership upon his children
[54:47] and he leads him up into all these
[54:49] things but now he's here to reveal
[54:50] himself Abraham takes the son brings him
[54:54] up to the altar he said he put what the
[54:56] word on the back of the son the son
[54:58] takes the Isaac takes it up then he
[55:00] takes the word sets in an order lays
[55:02] down and submissive son and as and as
[55:05] Abraham now pulls out his sharp knife
[55:07] he's ready to lay to slain his only son
[55:10] he saw the vision he says I'll be coming
[55:13] back I'll be coming back me and the lad
[55:15] will come back to you we're coming back
[55:17] and he's
[55:17] the running through his mind and now he
[55:19] says Lord I don't know how you're gonna
[55:21] do this he's got a sharpest knife
[55:22] because this is his sacrifice thus saith
[55:25] the Lord Kingdom says slay him and he's
[55:27] going up the bog skin now is on his head
[55:30] he's reflecting his sweat is down his
[55:32] then his face is beard and now he does
[55:35] not know what's gonna take place he's
[55:37] raising a knife and the voice says stop
[55:41] do not slay the son but he had fallen
[55:46] said that he would do this
[55:49] trusting in God that he would raise him
[55:51] up give him another one somehow stop the
[55:54] blade do something I need to put his
[55:56] fall trust
[55:57] and after that he pulls his son hugs him
[56:02] up and what the Bible says that God
[56:04] created a ram it was its horns were
[56:06] caught in a thicket just be honored that
[56:09] was creative power Saints creative power
[56:12] the horns represented with the power
[56:14] caught in the wood or the thurzo or the
[56:17] bus which is humanity 4 or 6 he was
[56:20] caught in there and then he laid him
[56:21] down and slay that lamb and from that
[56:24] time Abraham said I know I'm not just
[56:26] Jehovah not just as a Sharia because I
[56:29] remember he gave me the name Jehovah
[56:30] first show you what he was the only was
[56:33] the all-powerful one self-existing but
[56:35] not he showed what Girona
[56:37] then El Shaddai I then you can actually
[56:40] pull from this God for something and at
[56:43] this time Abraham deep in his heart a
[56:45] deep cold from the deep he was pulling
[56:47] for something to take place here he did
[56:49] not know it was gonna take place and God
[56:52] he was able to pull a sacrifice from God
[56:55] and he knew him as Jehovah Jireh right
[57:00] there why would God do such thing he has
[57:07] to reveal who he is what good is a God
[57:12] if he can't do anything for us or
[57:15] doesn't care about us
[57:17] but these Old Testament Saints had to
[57:19] live their lives out just wondering what
[57:22] God can do here's the God what could he
[57:25] do and from that time he was known as
[57:28] Jehovah Jireh now
[57:31] just the self existing one but the God
[57:33] that can provide anything can provide a
[57:35] sacrifice confided he's a provider he's
[57:38] a real husband amen

[1:01:24] Jehovah Nissi x2 the seventeen verse 8
[1:01:27] through 15
[1:01:28] this is typed out eases the enemy was
[1:01:31] Amalek a type of the flesh in the
[1:01:34] conflict that stands today for the
[1:01:36] conflict of Galatians 5 some the war of
[1:01:39] spirit versus fresh what represents
[1:01:41] victory was holy do victory was holy due
[1:01:45] to divine help brother sigh I see so
[1:01:50] much wickedness who's your greatest
[1:01:53] enemy Satan know our own selves
[1:01:58] Satan can only come and put an idea in
[1:02:00] her mind safety can only allow a spirit
[1:02:02] to jump on you get sicker to that but if
[1:02:05] you speak negative if you go into that
[1:02:08] negativity if you embrace that the
[1:02:13] doctor said I had this the doctor said
[1:02:15] his brother look so he said did God tell
[1:02:17] you that did Jesus tell you I had cancer
[1:02:21] did Jesus tell you oh no whatever speak
[1:02:28] whatever you will and God can make these
[1:02:31] things better he's already a provider he
[1:02:33] can provide your healing amen and he's
[1:02:36] our banner here they're going up against
[1:02:39] uh Amalek here and notice what takes
[1:02:43] place notice how he defeats him against
[1:02:46] November this is a type against the
[1:02:48] flesh and it came to pass when Moses
[1:02:51] held up as a hand that is reprieve ailed
[1:02:53] and we let down his hand Amalek
[1:02:56] prevailed for a long time I always
[1:02:59] imagined this Moses who stand like this
[1:03:02] but I remember I wonder if it was more
[1:03:04] like this and Joshua
[1:03:14] Moses had said him and taught and fought
[1:03:17] with emilich and Moses and Aaron her
[1:03:19] went up on top of the hill it did not
[1:03:22] Jesus Christ go on to kogasa that hill
[1:03:25] Calvary and held his hands up and while
[1:03:29] he kept those hands up God made sure
[1:03:31] those hands wouldn't go down he nailed
[1:03:33] to the cross and the one is doing those
[1:03:36] hands held he could cry out with his
[1:03:38] last breath in his finish the battle
[1:03:41] over the flesh is done it is over amen
[1:03:45] praise be to God we just have to walk in
[1:03:48] the spirit as he's in the spirit as he's
[1:03:50] in the light and will not be partakers
[1:03:52] of the sins of the flesh hey man and as
[1:03:55] he kept his arms up he says and the Lord
[1:03:59] said the most write this for a memorial
[1:04:00] to the book and rehearse in the ears of
[1:04:02] Joshua for surely put out remembers of
[1:04:04] Alamut Amalek from under heaven and one
[1:04:07] day Saints this body will be changed
[1:04:10] absolutely when I got to be sad again so
[1:04:13] again we'll never get sick whenever
[1:04:14] you're tired whatever had to be affected
[1:04:17] by this kind of environment again death
[1:04:19] the sin of death will be fully out of us
[1:04:22] the disease of sin will be out of us a
[1:04:24] man praise be to God then we know
[1:04:26] remember son of heaven praise be to God
[1:04:29] for this he said because the Lord
[1:04:31] Jehovah has sworn that the Lord will
[1:04:34] have war with Amalek from generation to
[1:04:36] generation they called the name of
[1:04:38] Jehovah Nissi he's our banner amen and
[1:04:41] when he healed in that claw a cross and
[1:04:44] that cross is still the banner this
[1:04:46] morning a man churches around the world
[1:04:48] have that and when Joshua entered the
[1:04:51] land of Canaan he said don't you let one
[1:04:53] of them live if it's a cute little baby
[1:04:56] a little Amalek any little thought
[1:04:58] you've seen your flesh they even in your
[1:05:00] spiritual rally says kill it
[1:05:03] he says he'll pollute the camp and when
[1:05:06] those little things come back like that
[1:05:08] disagreeing with the Word of God get rid
[1:05:10] of that thing I don't care what
[1:05:11] denomination it belongs to you say well
[1:05:14] they're good I don't care how good of
[1:05:15] people they are if they're contrary to
[1:05:17] the Word of God he says get the thing
[1:05:20] out of you it's growing a little Amalek
[1:05:23] looks cute looks innocent that's why we
[1:05:26] have to watch each other and be
[1:05:28] brother's keeper real sisters keeper
[1:05:30] absolutely keep one another clean it
[1:05:33] looks like it's alright but you don't
[1:05:35] have anything to do with that you stay
[1:05:36] right away from it well brother branham
[1:05:40] I'll go down here because well I don't
[1:05:41] you remember Emmy any amal Amalekites
[1:05:44] anything that denies the word stay away
[1:05:46] from it have nothing to do with it at
[1:05:48] all
[1:05:49] how many believers that's the truth see
[1:05:51] sure it is in the last couple months
[1:05:54] I've been in the mode where when someone
[1:05:56] says something off the word I correct it
[1:05:58] right away I correct it right away
[1:05:59] correct it right away when I see myself
[1:06:01] you do this or that I correct it right
[1:06:03] away I said try and get back on the
[1:06:05] track stay right in a narrow narrow line
[1:06:07] right back on that narrow gate
[1:06:08] absolutely sure sure
[1:06:11] right there Galatians 5:16 through 26
[1:06:14] you don't we won't hit that real quick
[1:06:16] we'll just read verse 16 17 this I say
[1:06:19] walk in the spirit and ye shall not
[1:06:21] fulfill the lusts of the flesh
[1:06:23] for the flesh lusts against the spirit
[1:06:26] and the spirit against the flesh and
[1:06:27] these are contrary one to another this
[1:06:30] is a battle with us every day
[1:06:32] costly right now he says so that you
[1:06:35] cannot do the thing that you would but
[1:06:37] if you be led by the spirit you're not
[1:06:39] under the law praise be to God and you
[1:06:42] can go in the works and those things
[1:06:44] later cuz I got a little ways to go here
[1:06:46] now next one is jehova sholom the Lord
[1:06:50] our peace the Lord are the Lord our
[1:06:52] peace the Lord will send peace this
[1:06:54] actually if you think about actually
[1:06:56] deals with the backslider because look
[1:06:59] how it starts look how he slowly reveals
[1:07:01] this thing and the children's will do
[1:07:02] evil in the sight of the Lord they back
[1:07:05] slid from God they weren't contrary
[1:07:08] started worshipping false listen false
[1:07:10] that did not have God as their first
[1:07:12] love and the hand of Midian and they
[1:07:16] sent him in the hand of Midian seven
[1:07:18] years I wonder why it's seven we know
[1:07:19] that was seven always represents the
[1:07:21] seven church ages and the hand of many
[1:07:27] prevailed against Israel look it's
[1:07:29] prophesied because in this day we break
[1:07:32] free because the mini i'ts and the
[1:07:34] children visitor had made them dens
[1:07:36] which are in the mountains in the caves
[1:07:37] and strongholds they ran from them and
[1:07:39] Israel was greatly impoverished because
[1:07:42] the mini Knights and the children of the
[1:07:43] Lord of Israel cried unto the Lord are
[1:07:46] we not living a million miles below what
[1:07:48] we should be we should be in spoken word
[1:07:51] already as far as Lord I need this
[1:07:54] waiting for the mind of God and we speak
[1:07:56] it in the moment happens every prayer
[1:07:59] should be answered absolutely we should
[1:08:01] be living like Eagles flying capturing
[1:08:03] what we need when we need absolutely we
[1:08:05] should be full of joy and go hey man but
[1:08:11] look what he says he rebukes him and I
[1:08:13] said you I am the Lord your God fear not
[1:08:15] the gods of the Amorite and whose land
[1:08:17] you dwell but ye have not obeyed my
[1:08:20] voice the second of Eve fell right from
[1:08:24] the book of Acts that was the second Eve
[1:08:26] and she fell as well but that's the Lord
[1:08:32] verse 16 and the Lord said to him surely
[1:08:34] I will be with thee and thou shalt smite
[1:08:35] the many eyes as one man so God says
[1:08:38] there's gonna be one more war he says
[1:08:39] and I will be with you this is before
[1:08:43] the war and what it gave Gideon such
[1:08:46] comfort such peace that here in verse 23
[1:08:51] and the Lord seven peace be unto thee
[1:08:53] fear thou not thou shall not die a man
[1:08:57] so God now is giving him comfort and
[1:08:59] what that's where the name I believe
[1:09:02] it's here yeah the Lord says peacefully
[1:09:04] the Lord is sorry Shalom
[1:09:10] that's what it is jovis sholom jehova
[1:09:11] sholom is right here even before the
[1:09:13] battle god was giving Gideon peace to go
[1:09:18] into this battle for the final round so
[1:09:20] we can take peace in that amen by God's
[1:09:23] grace now now look what it ties in here
[1:09:26] with the with the message of this hour
[1:09:28] he says one more thing we permitted to
[1:09:30] be said day before yesterday morning you
[1:09:32] notice on the board he said there was a
[1:09:33] vision he said I had a vision it was

[1:10:43] preacher gets a sermon he thinks God
[1:10:45] shows us some of this so and he wants to
[1:10:46] convey it to the people and he had two
[1:10:49] major points he wanted to hit he says I
[1:10:51] wanted to meet in my sermon and the Lord
[1:10:53] gave it to me and any preachers know
[1:10:55] when you really know it's God give it to

[1:11:07] discerns if I thought what is it easy
[1:11:09] the word going on he's just going on
[1:11:10] like that trying to hit these points oh
[1:11:13] I wish I could remember when I was

[1:11:41] already taken place they started to walk
[1:11:44] away some of them and he goes hmm they

[1:12:38] we can take comfort for our loved ones
[1:12:40] if they weren't up in the world a man
[1:12:43] now moving on the next one if you look
[1:12:46] at Psalms 22 Jehovah makes peace by the
[1:12:48] blood of the cross and Psalms 21
[1:12:51] what is this this has spoken this God
[1:12:53] actually spoken this in tongues my God
[1:12:55] my God why has thou forsaken me why
[1:12:57] aren't there so far from helping me and
[1:12:59] my words from my roaring lion he was a
[1:13:03] lion up there dying chapter 22 is Christ
[1:13:09] on the cross
[1:13:11] look at verse 7 all that you see that
[1:13:15] see me laughed me to scorn they shoot at
[1:13:19] the lip they shoot the head saying he
[1:13:20] trusts in the Lord that he would deliver
[1:13:22] him all these things are all Christ on
[1:13:25] the cross chapter 22 is Christ on the
[1:13:28] cross the Lamb of God right dogs have
[1:13:34] come past me assembly the wicked because
[1:13:36] they have pierced my hands and feet I
[1:13:37] may tell all my bones they look and
[1:13:40] stare upon me chapter 22 is Christ on
[1:13:44] the cross but the very
[1:13:50] compound reductive redemptive name of
[1:13:52] Jehovah is revealed in the next chapter
[1:13:57] Jehovah Rapha the Lord is my shepherd if
[1:14:02] God is a shepherd he would have to lead
[1:14:06] the Sheep and if he is leading the sheep
[1:14:09] he led them to Calvary and did his part
[1:14:12] on Calvary amen so where are we supposed
[1:14:15] to lead him as he led us amen what he
[1:14:18] did the shepherded the Sheep must follow
[1:14:20] a man crazy be to God and there David
[1:14:23] reveals to us to what he is the shepherd
[1:14:25] a man but within that act of dying in
[1:14:31] Psalms 22 he dies but now he's revealed
[1:14:35] as all of these all seven compound
[1:14:38] redemptive names are found in Psalms 23
[1:14:41] he says the Lord is my shepherd Jehovah
[1:14:44] Rapha
[1:14:45] he's I Sharon I want Jehovah Jireh why
[1:14:47] because he's provided everything I'm

[1:18:33] verse 6 hittin the Jewish religion even
[1:18:37] talks about this if you understand the
[1:18:39] type a wall unto the world be to the
[1:18:41] pastor's destroy and scatter the sheep
[1:18:43] of my flock saith the Lord
[1:18:47] bad pastors therefore saith the Lord God
[1:18:51] of Israel gets the pastor's that feed my
[1:18:53] people er you have scattered my flock
[1:18:56] driven them away they have not and have
[1:18:59] not visited them behold I will visit you
[1:19:01] with the evil of your doings saith the
[1:19:02] Lord our God the remnant of my flock out
[1:19:04] of all countries will that I've driven
[1:19:05] them and will gather them together to
[1:19:07] the together to their folds that they
[1:19:10] shall be fruitful and increase and I
[1:19:12] will set up Shepherds over them that
[1:19:14] shall feed them so these Shepherds are
[1:19:18] wicked and took them away from what's
[1:19:20] what has revealed to the righteousness
[1:19:22] of God God became sin that we become the
[1:19:27] riot of the very righteousness of God
[1:19:30] and in his days verse 6 in his days
[1:19:34] Judah shall be saved and there shall be
[1:19:36] safely and this is the name where he
[1:19:38] shall be called Jehovah he says the Lord
[1:19:40] our righteousness this is yet to come
[1:19:42] this is future tense the Jews are still
[1:19:45] in their fig leaves their fig leaf
[1:19:47] religion right now the Israeli religion
[1:19:49] but salvation of the Jews they just
[1:19:51] haven't called back up to yet absolutely
[1:19:54] the next one and the last one notice how
[1:19:57] God reveals us last in Scripture jehova
[1:20:00] shamma God is our provider he's a healer
[1:20:05] he's our banner he's our peace he's all
[1:20:08] these things but what good is it if you
[1:20:12] can only pull from it at a certain time
[1:20:15] but what's revealed here is jehova
[1:20:18] shamma the Lord is present right now
[1:20:23] anytime you need healing anytime he's
[1:20:25] something provided and it's a unique
[1:20:27] piece he's opposing God in a time of
[1:20:30] trouble any man the Prophet picks up on
[1:20:35] this we'll just paraphrase he's
[1:20:37] preaching on the seventh compound name
[1:20:38] is Jehovah and he hits jehova shamma and
[1:20:41] he goes in the story I'll him and his
[1:20:42] wife had just got married he was too
[1:20:44] poor for a honeymoon and too poor to
[1:20:45] have a hunting trip separate so he
[1:20:47] combines him so he take he takes over in
[1:20:51] this high mountain where there's no heat
[1:20:52] and he's being big shot bill and big
[1:20:55] shot bill and he goes out hot and he
[1:20:58] says he's his baby I'll be back he's

[1:21:01] maybe we have a I'll get em you got me
[1:21:03] ELISA dear I'll get some backs tracks
[1:21:04] want some fresh meat for the four
[1:21:06] tonight he goes up to the mountain he's
[1:21:08] he's tracking deer gets on this bear
[1:21:10] track finds this bear can't find it then
[1:21:13] he finds a deer he shoots the deer or
[1:21:15] boom he's got it cuts up the meat and
[1:21:16] he's like wow I better head back to my
[1:21:18] wife and child and what we know what
[1:21:21] takes place next he gets lost he said in
[1:21:26] the Indian Indian tradition they called
[1:21:27] the dead man's walk
[1:21:30] he says I'll find my way back had gotten
[1:21:33] foggy the mountains he couldn't find his
[1:21:35] way the fall get settled in he started
[1:21:38] walking and holding the meeting's gun
[1:21:41] fires sure enough he comes right he
[1:21:43] finds himself right back at that near
[1:21:44] he'd killed he'd gone half an hour and
[1:21:46] he went right back he goes out again I
[1:21:50] bill gyro you're a wilderness man you've
[1:21:52] been trained here you're you know all
[1:21:53] about he comes right back that year
[1:21:55] again and he tells you the inner battles
[1:21:59] he has Lord I'm this I can't be lost I
[1:22:03] can't be lost and then finally he gets
[1:22:04] to the point where says I am lost and my
[1:22:07] new wife was a city girl it's gonna die
[1:22:10] tonight because it's getting cold she
[1:22:13] don't know how to start a fire she know
[1:22:15] how to cook on a fire what's that
[1:22:17] where's the stove where's the oven table
[1:22:18] top nice table see with a flattop
[1:22:21] they're clean they're real easy and he
[1:22:27] starts out and he says and then the
[1:22:29] voice said what let's just look at that
[1:22:30] look at the voice said so I
[1:22:34] here's something whispering in my ear
[1:22:36] the Lord is my refuge our refuge and
[1:22:39] strength a very present help in the time
[1:22:42] of trouble I thought now I'm getting for
[1:22:45] nefra Nanak started to walk around it
[1:22:47] said something the lord is our refuge
[1:22:49] and help a very present time and help of
[1:22:51] time of trouble I just kept walking on
[1:22:54] got louder the Lord as our refuge and
[1:22:56] strength a very present help in a time
[1:22:57] of trouble I kept moving on and dragging
[1:22:59] my gun along I was so tired and then and
[1:23:01] then you know the Lord that was jehova
[1:23:04] shamma but talking to me he was present
[1:23:08] right there God watching over him and
[1:23:13] looking through the pines and winds of
[1:23:15] tearing whistling them through there I
[1:23:18] believe beyond yonder that somewhere
[1:23:19] there was an angel of God follow me
[1:23:21] through this force and there was he was
[1:23:23] with me yeah he never manifested itself
[1:23:25] that's years ago about 15 years ago and
[1:23:27] I wasn't going through walking like this
[1:23:28] and what happened is he finally got down
[1:23:31] and said lord please help me he said
[1:23:34] Lord I'm going this direction I believe
[1:23:37] it's this way but if I'm wrong you
[1:23:39] correct me he says and I was going along
[1:23:43] the way that walk like this and I felt
[1:23:45] somebody go on my shoulder and I turned
[1:23:49] to look who it was and the fall cleared
[1:23:52] away just that moment and revealed the
[1:23:54] very mountain he needed to see to find
[1:23:56] his way back gay men but what we have to
[1:24:00] understand God is right there right now
[1:24:03] any time all the time whatever you need
[1:24:06] and he's right there ambulance at four
[1:24:08] o'clock door at four o'clock in the
[1:24:09] morning this morning God woke me up you
[1:24:11] know how he did it I was laying in bed
[1:24:14] and it never happened before
[1:24:16] you know in the mornings on Saturdays
[1:24:19] because when I actually get to sleep in
[1:24:21] Saturday's you're laying in bed and the
[1:24:24] sunlight starts manifesting shooting
[1:24:27] it's rays through the window and it
[1:24:30] starts your does that thing on your
[1:24:32] eyelid you say anybody got magically you
[1:24:36] know by the presence of the S UN right
[1:24:38] well last night I rolled over and the
[1:24:42] same thing started happening I look
[1:24:46] we'll wake up wide awake God had use
[1:24:49] moonlight to wake me up last night the
[1:24:53] moon was so bright and it was shining
[1:24:56] all over my arm like this and it woke me
[1:24:59] up God can do anything he was trying to
[1:25:06] make contact with me there did he say he
[1:25:09] said he's make the Sun he's make the
[1:25:11] moon as bright as the Sun but you have
[1:25:13] to raise the Sun up seven times brighter
[1:25:16] amen God's attitude toward his people
[1:25:21] since the Garden of Eden has been
[1:25:22] wrapped up in the seven compound
[1:25:24] redemptive names the fall itself unlike
[1:25:28] the ads used to or bottle up in our God
[1:25:31] if the fall would have never taken place
[1:25:33] we'd never known this about him we
[1:25:36] needed to fall in the sin God allowed he
[1:25:39] set the stage he planned this thing
[1:25:42] perfectly thank God for the fall and now
[1:25:49] we know our Savior but look what it says
[1:25:53] here first - and the Gentiles shall see
[1:25:56] thy righteous and all kings like glory
[1:25:58] and thou shall be called by a new name
[1:26:01] which the mouth of the Lord Jehovah
[1:26:04] shall name alright
[1:26:08] what does that name the name of Jesus
[1:26:11] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:26:14] Jehovah Mitch which means what Jehovah
[1:26:17] Savior now look how the Prophet breaks
[1:26:21] us down
[1:26:22] he says when Matthew said no Matthew
[1:26:24] 28:19 he says go he is there for all
[1:26:27] teach all nations baptizing them in the
[1:26:28] name of the Father Son and Holy Ghost
[1:26:31] this was written this was spoken out of
[1:26:37] Christ's mouth look how how it's been
[1:26:41] misinterpreted today and say in the name
[1:26:43] of the Father Son and Holy Ghost in the
[1:26:45] name he said the name it's not even
[1:26:47] written he left it a mystery on that
[1:26:52] mountain high up with their eleven
[1:26:55] disciples he says baptize in the name of
[1:26:57] the Father Son and Holy Ghost he never
[1:26:59] gives the name
[1:27:00] he leaves it a mystery it was a complete
[1:27:05] mystery he said it wasn't even written
[1:27:08] at that time it's it's in the name
[1:27:11] singular of the Father is not a name son
[1:27:14] is not name Holy Ghost is not name it's
[1:27:16] a title ten days later Peter Peter stood
[1:27:20] up and said repair everyone baptized in
[1:27:21] the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:27:23] see so the new name was then revealed he
[1:27:27] says well I'll give the Gentiles a new
[1:27:29] name now look how he breaks it down
[1:27:33] further
[1:27:33] he's a salvation along goes in the name
[1:27:36] of Jesus why would you get baptized
[1:27:38] father son Holy Ghost when there's no
[1:27:40] salvation in those titles he says
[1:27:43] whatever you're doing word or deed do
[1:27:45] all in the name of Jesus Christ there is
[1:27:47] not another name no church no hierarchy
[1:27:50] no titles nothing else yet here's the
[1:27:52] Rose of Sharon the loser Bellary the
[1:27:54] morning stars Alpha Omega beginning the
[1:27:55] end
[1:27:56] Joubert IRA Roth aye Manasseh all these
[1:27:59] things he is all these things yet but
[1:28:00] there is no salvation in any of those
[1:28:02] titles Jehovah no salvation
[1:28:05] a man runs us and yet he is no salvation
[1:28:10] far so he goes he says no shows up in
[1:28:13] salvation only the name of Jesus Christ
[1:28:16] praise be to God which means Jehovah
[1:28:19] Savior hallelujah amen now we're gonna
