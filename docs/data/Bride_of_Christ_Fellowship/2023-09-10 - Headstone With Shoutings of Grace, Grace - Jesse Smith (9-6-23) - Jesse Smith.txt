TRANSCRIPT
========================================
Zechariah Chapter 4 verses 1 to 7. I'll read uh one through five then we can read six and seven together again tonight I'd like to preach on The Headstone with shoutings of Grace Grace and the angel that talked with me came again and waked me as a man that has wakened out of his sleep and he said unto me what see is thou and I said I have looked and behold a Candlestick of all gold with a bowl upon the top of it and his seven lamps thereon and seven pipes to the seven lamps which are upon the top thereof the two olive trees buy it one upon the right side of the bowl and the other up on the left side thereof so I answered and spanked to the angel that talked with me saying what are these my Lord and the angel that talked with me answered and said to me nois thou not what these be and I said no my Lord all right let's read six and seven ready one two three and he answered and spake unto me saying this is the word of the Lord unto zerubbable saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts who art thou o great Mountain before zerubbabel Thou shalt become a plane and he shall bring forth The Headstone thereof with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it amen hallelujah let's have one more word of prayer yeah we need on your heart let's make an order to God what a beautiful portion of scripture very prophetic uh portion here father God we just come in the mighty name of Jesus Lord anoint this word anoint me anoint the hearers Lord God speak to us Lord God thank you for the prophetic element to this portion of scripture as it applies to us we can clearly see it Lord through the scriptures so God anoint us here and guide us and direct us in Jesus Christ's name whatever I said amen God bless you Japan all right so like I said it's been a while since I've preached on this but I heard a minister and uh mention this and I thought oh I'd like to go back through my notes and preach on this so I can switch over and I got a few uh slides to show by the grace of the Lord I want to try to maybe keep it a little shorter tonight I'm still getting over my sickness I got to make sure I get some good rest here tonight by the grace of the Lord so we're looking at The Headstone with shoutings of Grace Grace you read our text uh here's a little background on this Aruba Bowl now if you're not familiar with it you know numerous of these books kind of go together uh Ezra you have Zechariah haggai go together there's a little a little bit of overlap with those three books if you ever study those out I appreciate it back in 2013 so it's been 10 years since I pretty soon this I don't expect everybody to remember but there is a lot of overlap and you get so many good nuggets as you read through those three books Ezra and then Zechariah and hagini okay so here's a little background on zerubo uh he came out of Babylon he was also a descendant of the royal line of David he's according to the uh he's a grandson or nephew of Salah Thiel he's also known by his Persian name Bazaar in the first year of Cyrus the King of Persia he led the first band of Jews which was about 42 000 Jews exclusive a large number of servants who returned from captivity to the close of the 70 years so I'll just pause right there he was one of the Jews when he was the one of the first ones that fulfilled Jeremiah 29 right remember Jeremiah 29 we all like it we all we all like to quote that verse for our lives that I have a plan for you right I know my thoughts to you they're good thoughts but he said you'll seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart right well when was that scripture fulfilled it was fulfilled and drewable is the Fulfillment of that so he had to cross I believe the deserts if we're not mistaken from Babylon to Jerusalem Hallelujah and that was that was the sign that he was seeking God with all of his heart soul mind and strength and then also he started rebuilding the temple of God hallelujah because Solomon's Temple had been destroyed years earlier I think it was 70 years earlier and so they had to rebuild it and he was one of them that led the charge to return and also rebuild so in the second year after the return He erected an altar so first he built the altar and then he laid the foundation of the temple on the ruins of that which had been destroyed by Nebuchadnezzar okay and then eventually he finished the house right right Hallelujah he finished the house and then remember after it finished then God said as we're there to teach the people the word of God and lastly God sent Nehemiah to build a wall of protection around the city so it's a beautiful type of how what's the first thing that's restored the blood what's that justification Hallelujah and then you get the house of God here uh sanctification and I would type the baptism only goes to the wall because the wall seals you in so it's a beautiful type there it's a beautiful type justification sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost uh it's a nice type of God restoring the city of God hallelujah this is a city of David hallelujah amen the city of Zion Hallelujah it's a beautiful type here and you'll see as I get to the end you'll see what this is a type of if you don't remember so I'll save it as a little treat if you don't remember remember you maybe never heard that sermon it's a nice treat there uh but remember Church you know after they laid the foundation remember what happened all the inhabitants got upset and what they do they went to uh the the leaders and they had it shut down right right and it shut down the building for 16 years so they had the foundation but it was unfinished it laid there for 16 years they were so the the people lived in fear for 16 years the church don't feel too discouraged you know if you battle fear for a little bit or you you know you went through some tough times they bowed it for 16 years but God was merciful that's why I love this verse Grace Grace amen God gives us Grace right God gave him Grace to come back and actually build the altar and the uh the foundation but that wasn't enough they needed more grace so God gave them more grace to build the house and then build the wall Hallelujah remember they built the wall in trouble as times the Bible said right remember they worked with one hand with a tool and one hand with the sword amen hallelujah that's the book of Nehemiah beautiful book Hallelujah type I believe of the baptism of the Holy Ghost but think about that 16 years uh they would be discouraged it's just like if our church went and tried to buy some land and maybe we maybe we bought the land and cleared it but then we stopped working for 16 years and then finally after 16 years finished it and you know that whole time we'd be fighting my battles well did God call us here did God call us here or not you know what it was it God's will for us to do this or not you know and the whole time it was God's will but God was waiting on them right right and you remember Church how did God stir them up do you remember he sent them two Prophets haggai and Zechariah and the Bible said that Israel prospered through those two prophets and that's how it always is church we Prosper through the prophetic Ministry of brother random and of course no doubt Saint Paul Saint Peter you know James and John of course John he wrote the Book of Revelation but God's people will always uh Prosper through a genuine prophet and that's what I know in my life and most of you are in the nomination you know that too you didn't have the level of spiritual Prosperity that you have now now that you're in the message now that you follow God's Prophet now that you have a prophetic revelation of the Bible Hallelujah that's exactly right Hallelujah my life is a testimony of that my life is prospered spiritually because of the ministry God sent through brother Branham amen so again that's the first interpretation we see of Grace Grace God had to give a second measure of Grace because they got fearful and they quit building and it lasted 16 years my that's almost that's almost half a generation right Generations 40 years that's almost half a generation and uh some say it might have been wasted well some people might have looked at it like that or you could look at it as a learning experience Hallelujah I don't like to look at my life as waste I don't think you know when I fail I don't call it a waste I call it alert experience Hallelujah because you know why because God said he never leaves me or forsakes me and if he never left me or forsake me it wasn't wasted praise God it just took my hard-headed skull right uh my my uh my hard-headedness a little extra time to receive the word of God but I believe in time I will receive all the promises of God for my life amen now uh if you got your Bible remember haggai chapter 2 verse 3. hey guys right before Zechariah and remember he was one of the prophets he and Zechariah did I remember Church you might remember this uh some of the saints that were alive when zerubel finally finished the temple they were alive and they saw Solomon's Temple remember that now from what I read on the on on the history Zero's Temple was able was about the same size as Solomon's Temple but it wasn't as Grand in decoration you remember Solomon's Temple had 12 it had 12 Lions on the six steps six on each side going up into the place of worship and they were covered in gold well this one didn't have that this was just the house right and and Solomon's house was overlaid with gold Outside Inside all the cords because it was a type of the Millennium praise God hallelujah Divinity where we'll live in Divine perfect bodies how the glorified bodies for a thousand years Hallelujah with the son of David Jesus Christ hallelujah amen with some of the same some of the old-timers they look up and they uh zerubel he lays The Headstone it's all finished and verse two says um speaking out is roomable the son of shaytl governor of Judah and to Joshua the son of josedek the high priest and to the rest of the people saying who is left among you that saw this house in her first glory and how do you see it now is it not in your eyes in comparison of as it were nothing and let's just pause there so remember the other verse is in uh Ezra I'm not going to read the other one but the other ones actually records when it was dedicated right and all the young people that never saw Solomon's Temple they were shouting and rejoicing we got a church we got a place of worship God's house is restored they were just excited to have something right but all the old people were discouraged they're like oh we don't have all the jewels and the gold and the lions and all the praise and altars and all these things and they were crying right and it depends on which side you were on if you're the new generation you loved it if your old generation you didn't like it praise God Hallelujah but see what what was the point the point was God was fulfilling his word the old-timers should have been thankful right right they should have been thankful that they had something back that they had a house of God God was moving amen hallelujah and God had brought them across the desert praise God 42 000 completely healthy right completely safe they weren't ambushed they weren't killed God had brought 42 gen or 42 000 back they built a brand new Temple they oughta been excited they ought to have been rejoicing so we would say it's a shame on them they should have appreciated what God was doing that's right I'll do verse four yet now be strong with Super Bowl saith the Lord and strong oh Joshua son of josedek the high priest and be strong all you people the land saith the Lord and work for I Am with You saith the Lord of hosts all right now I want to go down here if you go down to uh verse seven and I will shake All Nations and the desire of all Nations shall come and I fill this house with Glory saith the Lord of hosts actually now read verse six I believe this is prophetic here of the Millennium verse six for thus saith the Lord of hosts yet once it is a little while that I will shake the heavens and the earth and the Sea and the dry land okay and then the desired Nations should come who knows who is the desire of all Nations Jesus Jesus is the desire of All Nation so God is going to shake all Heaven and Earth I believe that's during the tribulation period he's going to shake everything and then the desired Nations will come he comes to Armageddon right but then after the battle he burns over the Earth with uh either atomic fire or heavily fervent heat the Bible says and then we walk upon the ashes of the wicked Hallelujah look at verse 8 9 beautiful portion of scripture the silver is mine the Gold is mine saith the Lord of hosts they've got nothing to worry about right God's gonna put gold back on this house Hallelujah God's Gonna Make this House beautiful again it's all his anyway Hallelujah verse 9 and here's a great prophecy the glory of this latter house speaking of when he comes the desire of all Nations the millennium shall be greater than of the former saith the Lord of hosts and in this place will I give peace saith the Lord of hosts Hallelujah this has to be the Millennium because the Millennium is a thousand years apiece right this can't be the Rapture this can't be anything else this can't be the 144 000 because they don't have peace right the nations are coming after Israel during that time the Antichrist breaks his Covenant with Israel and leaves all of his armies down there against uh Israel this has to be the Millennium and so the holy spirit says through haggai the holy spirit says oh he said you owe men you owe generation don't be upset the glory of the latter house praise God the glory the Millennium will be way greater than Solomon's Glory oh just as Jesus greater than Solomon so will the millennial Temple be greater than Solomon's Temple oh there's so much grander church can I say like this the half has not been told amen how great Jesus's Temple the Jewish Israel Temple of Jesus during the Millennium shall be the Bible describes it in uh Ezekiel 38 and 39 if I'm not mistaken no 48 49 maybe sometime we'll preach on that by God's grace won't be tonight but maybe we'll preach on that later and so it's a grand description Hallelujah the glory and beauty of the millennial Temple okay so now here's a picture I want to show you too look up here uh here's like an American football field most of us kind of know what that been a football stadium Solomon's Temple was about a little over half about 60 of a football field with all the outer Court included so that would be like Solomon's Temple now when Herod rebuilt it I forgot how many years it took him I think it was they told us in the scriptures was it 40 and six years remember when Jesus said you build this Temple I'll raise it up in three days I think it was 40 in six years so Herod built way more because he involved a women's court because remember he wanted to gain the favor of the Jews so he spent way more years Simon built his in seven years right I believe he built the temple in seven years if we're not mistaken and so Hera took 40 40 some years to build it even larger okay but this wasn't his Grand because remember this was covered in Gold this had those those lines that were covered in gold it had all the the brakes and altars and the labors of brass it was so many of them right it's been a while since I looked at it but you understand they're all all those great things that this was uh this was maybe bigger but not as splendid okay so you would picture his Rule's house was about that size but not as beautiful okay and so it made the older generation weep but God said I'm with you in church if God's with you with a church that's not as pretty as another one God's still with you God just say that don't be discouraged God's with you I'll say it like this whether you're in a big church or a small Church you don't have to be discouraged as long as God is with you praise God that's what counts Hallelujah like I would like when I was in the message I gone to a little bit a couple bigger churches than this of course I had different a couple different Pat or yeah one different Pastor brother Brooks there's maybe 100 150 in that church but it doesn't matter as long as God's with us we learn of the grace of God we grow in the grace of God the holy spirit's here as long as we draw an eye to God God will draw an eye to us hallelujah amen now let's read the rest of this chapter here go to back to Zechariah 4. because it's highly prophetic and I forgot to set a timer here but that's all right let's finish the chapter there's only about six or seven more verses here and I don't think I'll spend much time on this because I do want to get down to the uh the meaning of Grace Grace verse eight moreover the word of the Lord came unto me say the hands of zerubel had laid the foundation of this house his hands shall also finish it remember what was this house or type of it was a forerunner a witch house the millennial house so who deservable type Christ right Christ is the first and the last amen hallelujah laid the first Cornerstone and drewable will lay the final Stone The Headstone that's a type of first and last Alpha Omega Jesus Christ if he started it he'll finish it Jesus started a walk with in your life with you he'll finish it Hallelujah I love that that's good and thou shalt know that the Lord of hosts has set me unto you that's how you'll know they have small things now look at that God rebukes them he rebukes that older generation why do you despise the day of small things and church isn't that what we have we have a day of the most deception we have a day of less people being saved right right the age of the open door was the Philadelphian Church age but should we despise the fact that God called us to serve God in this age no we should Rejoice because God's with us hallelujah even if we only save a few Souls praise God God will honor us praise God as long as we say it all we could say God will honor us hallelujah and the Holy Spirit rebukes the older generation why do you despise small things for they shall rejoice and see the plummet in the hand observable with those seven for they are the eyes of the Lord which run to and fro through the whole world of course he's speaking of the prophets right those seven candlesticks right speaking of the two prophets those two candlesticks we'll see represent haggai and Zechariah and then the Holy Spirit they were preaching with went through the whole earth right that anointing goes through all the Earth looking for someone that wants to serve God and what do those prophets do they give they give grace to the believer but they give judgment to the unbeliever right right they they uh the Holy Spirit rebukes evil leaders of Nations but the holy spirit gives grace to the Jewish leaders right the Believers who want to repent and get right with God amen amen oh it's beautiful verse 11. that answered I and said unto him what are these two olive trees upon the right side of the Candlestick and upon them left side thereof and answered him again and said unto him what be these two Olive branches which through the two golden pipes empty the golden oil out of themselves and he answered me and said no it's thou not what these be and I said no my Lord then he said these are the two anointed ones that stand by the lord of the whole earth Hallelujah all right now I couldn't find my picture I tried looking for it beforehand but anyways you have the menorah in the Middle with seven branches and you have two olive trees on both yeah one Olive Tree on both sides and the oils flowing from the trees into uh the menorah to so the menorah can give light Hallelujah and these two olive trees represent the two prophets because the anointing has to flow out of the prophets they got to be anointed just like Isaiah Isaiah said I didn't have anointing he said but then God set a coal on my lips amen and then he said now you go I'm sending you because the Holy Ghost has purified your mouth that's what we need preachers with pure mouths hallelujah hallelujah we need sisters with pure mouths Brothers with pure mouths children with pure mouths Hallelujah the Holy Ghost says touch their mouth and they'll say only what the Bible says hallelujah oh that's right beautiful okay now for time's sake I'm not gonna go through this there's a large portion in the church age book you're going to read it it's page 50 51 52. I'm just going to go to get go to this okay brother Ann said these olive trees represent in the Old Testament and New Testament we know they also represent haggai and Zachariah Corona Ezra 5 1. brother Adam said uh the brother man said the Candlestick represents the seven Church ages right but we also know there's a foreshadow in the in the Kings because we're Kings and three sons of God and I love how the Old Testament ends with Elijah Hallelujah just like John the Baptist just like the New Testament amen oh it's perfect right Solomon was a wise master builder wrote Bible books so did Paul Paul Paul himself said I was a wise master builder Hallelujah and he wrote much of the New Testament and then also these two olive trees now back to the olive trees they represent Moses and Elijah coming in Revelation 11 verse 1 through 6. and there's actually probably a few verses after that but mainly in verse six because it mentioned how they had the ministry of Moses and Elijah they can bring blood they can turn water to blood and they can also make it not rain for three and a half years same Ministry Moses same Ministry Elijah so it's either Mosin Elijah themselves or it's the anointing on two men brother Ram didn't know he didn't tell us right to the end so not every answer is on the tape but you know that Hallelujah I don't have to pre-chart on that so I made this image a few years ago so there's at least two symbols okay these two prophets are kind of like two golden candlesticks but remember in the vision there's only one golden Candlestick right and then there's two olive trees so this picture would actually be this picture actually needs to be changed it needs to be two two trees feeding into one candlestick I think there is a tree yeah I think there are trees there but they actually have two candlesticks I can see the branches over here there's branches but that picture was the best picture I could find because it showed two profits okay so it represents uh two olive trees okay now let's get to our text so back to Zechariah 4 here now I just want to kind of bring this down here now this is a beautiful scripture uh Zechariah 4 verse 6 then he answered and spoken to me saying this is the word of the Lord unto Rubble saying not by might nor by power but by my spirit saith the Lord of hosts so we'll stop right there God had to tell zruval you will not finish this house by your own might buy your own power by your own Spirit yeah you can't finish this building unless the Holy Spirit does it amen thank God Hallelujah what an encouragement church if anything gets done in our lives it's going to be the holy spirit that does it Hallelujah it won't because if we do it on our effort then we get the glory right but God will not share his glory with anybody praise God that's why I don't need to discourage sister Zuri and over the years you know I want to see more people say but you know I haven't gotten discouraged because if anybody saved God has to do it right right if God calls them they'll stay hallelujah or they'll go to a good church you know though if they leave our church that's fine but they'll serve God if God really calls him and they really love God and God's in that the god that started the work will finish the work praise God because I I pleaded with people I've done Bible studies with people I've driven to people's houses for Bible studies and I've labored hard but I can't make them believe they've got to believe Hallelujah God has to finish the work Hallelujah now we should plead with him the Bible says we should sigh and cry for the Abominations right we should plead we should beg God to save Souls we should we should beg God to forgive people their sins like Abraham beg God to spare lot right in his family we should do that but ultimately it's up to God hallelujah and so God has to tell us rule you will not finish this by yourself it will not be you it will be me Hallelujah the holy spirit will move Hallelujah it'll not be your might your power or your spirit it has to be the Holy Spirit praise God now shouties now verse seven who art thou o great Mountain so this this fear that had this fear that had gripped them was like a mountain they were facing like it doesn't seem like that like our government lives like a mountain right it doesn't seem like you know the coveted restrictions was like a mountain you know all that there and now all their recession isn't it and they're uh some people say it's a silent depression right now that's what some people say because everything's so expensive right they say it's like a silent now it's not that way where lots of people are losing drugs jobs I'd say it's a silent recession everything is so much more expensive but doesn't it seem like a mountain how am I ever going to get ahead how am I going to say how am I going to invest in and those are just natural things we have to we have to be concerned about as long as we're living here right we've got to plant our potatoes but we're able to live like uh the rapture's gonna be in 10 years he said but spiritually uh you know I'm sorry work like it's going to be in 10 years but spiritually be ready this hour okay but here you know we see it it was a great Mountain so the government the fear the government was a great Mountain and the Holy Spirit says who are you Mountain I like that God challenges the enemy amen who are you right and we can say the same who are you sickness right who are you depression right right who are you White House amen who are you the Bible says o great Mountain the holy spirit says before before God's man before his removable Thou shalt become a plane amen Hallelujah the holy spirit will take this mountain and totally crush it and clear off the playing field so there's no more obstacle it's clear sailing hallelujah it's easy traveling Hallelujah the obstacles out of the way and the Holy Spirit the Holy Spirit challenges that enemy that obstacle and says I will move you it won't be as removable that can move a mountain we can't move a mountain but God's word moves a mountain Hallelujah and Jesus Echoes this in the gospels right and he said speak to the mountain if you don't doubt he said that mountain will have to move hallelujah amen thank God what a blessing I love this because now we can see the same spirit that spoke to Zechariah was the Same Spirit of Jesus Hallelujah because both of them speak to Mountains and the mountains have to move praise God now what we need today is seek God until we get our next speaking of the mountain right right we spoke to the mountain for zern who is Dad right we spoke to the mountain in some other situations in people's lives my friend uh Seth Atkinson's dad Tom we spoke to the mountain in that one uh Jose's relatives that couldn't have a child we spoke to the mountain in that one and so see we wait for God on the next time we speak to the mountain Hallelujah that's right but it's the same Jesus who spoke to Zechariah same Jesus said we can speak to the mountain but we gotta wait till he says to do it right Hallelujah he shall bring forth The Headstone so zerubul is going to bring forth his headstone he's gonna he's gonna guide The Headstone with all their machines their primitive machines right he's going to guide his headstone into place and set it down and it's gonna be it's gonna be set down with shoutings crying Grace Grace unto it amen so let's look versus shouting this shout this shoutings in Zechariah reminds me of the shout in first Thessalonians 4 16. why would he use the word Shout in other words the laying on this headstone is a type of the rapture and I'm gonna show you a few more verses on that to prove that I've always believed the Rapture is a three-step process the shout voice Trump now it could be something else you know Cam and Simon have shown me so many more quotes I've never seen before so the shout could be something else but I've always believed this I believe the shout was brother Ram's Ministry and then also now it's us we're shouting it out to the world I tell you it does shout through internet thank God for that yeah Hallelujah but the voice of the Archangel I believe with the voice of Michael that resurrects the dead in Christ because Satan disputed about the resurrected body of Moses with the archangel there's a connection between archangels and resurrected bodies that's all I have that's my best guess because the dead in Christ have to rise first but we know what the Trump is the Bible says the Trump of God is when the death is swallowed up in Victory and our bodies are changed and we meet the Saints in the air praise God we know that that's clear happens in a twinkling of an eye somebody asked about that a few days ago was it Victoria somebody in our house asked about the twinkling of an eye it means just an instant the incident of a bat of an eye that's how fast that's how fast we'll be out of this past house amen into Glory that's how fast we'll see Jesus hallelujah oh my God what a moment what a moment to live for Hallelujah amen so I need to search some of those quotes but that's the best understanding and the reason I preached shout voice and Trump like that because that's what brother Ann taught in the sermon the Rapture 1965 but again he never said thus said the Lord it was the best it was the best teaching that I've seen this far okay but it was never thus saith the Lord so see the word shout struck me I'm like oh wow that's right shoutings of Grace and the Bible said the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with his shout and notice zerubov was there and there was a shout and threwable time too Christ right so the Lord descends with a shout here's removable ascends he ascends to the top of the the temple and he lays the stone with shoutings so we see a shout hallelujah oh also the other shout was when Rahab was saved out of Jericho there was a shout and there was a trumpet and she represents the Gentile bride being saved before the world is destroyed amen right there it's right there there's two types you have rehab being saved there's shouts there they shouted and then they blew the trumpet and now you have zerubel laying the I'm sorry The Headstone and their shoutings and then brother random says this is a type of the rapture okay again we don't save the Lord but it sure is a really good type it's a beautiful type okay so it looks like shoutings with Grace speaks of the shout of the rapture now how about Grace Grace and I got a few different thoughts on that remember for zero Grace Grace meant you you had Grace to get here but you needed extra Grace to finish the job amen amen 16 years you you struggle with with fear and battles and everything but God gave you extra Grace to send you two prophets two olive trees amen with oil that gave you light it gave you the light of the church ages hallelujah amen there's something good in there in there I gotta study that out more so it could mean this Grace Grace So this this headphone is in place with Grace Grace so the Grace Grace could mean former rain later rain it could mean that right right because you get two measures of Grace to finish the job right just like the two uh Banquets Esther put on remember that it wasn't one banquet it wasn't three Banquets it was two former ladder here we have Grace Grace not just one Grace two Graces yeah yeah and we know church we know there's there's no Bible doctrine that says God gives a double portion of Grace like there's there's no more there's no Bible doctrine of that like God just gives us Grace but it shows that God has to pour out his grace again or his his Spirit again and help the people finish the work hallelujah amen oh it's beautiful and I love this verse I thought this verse while I was coming to church remember this it's been a while since I preached this this is a beautiful verse because people say I'm under grace I don't have to live holy I'm saved by grace well what about this verse for the grace of God that brings salvation has appeared to all men teaching us that what does grace teach that we should deny ungodliness we should deny cigarettes deny alcohol deny drugs deny dirty shows denying worldly lust we should live soberly righteously Godly in this present world so Grace teaches live a holy life amen and that that lines up with Romans six I'm going to get them back back to that eventually Romans 6 says should we continue in sin that Grace May abound God forbid right don't continue sitting on purpose just because you know you're saved by grace stop sinning the best you can amen show your appreciation for Grace amen live soberly righteously Godly in this present world show people what a real Christian looks like Hallelujah amen Grace teaches you should look for that blessed hope the Glorious appearing of the great God and our Savior Jesus Christ who gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all iniquity and purify unto himself of peculiar people zealous of good works I'll tell you we're looking the more I see this Administration this White House body Administration the more I see them arrest Christians the more I know Jesus is coming soon because when you start touching the bride of Christ when you start doing persecutions like this Jesus is coming back yeah right and think and remember before he before uh uh the Beast can touch the whole the whole nation and group of Christians Jesus come back and rescue us hallelujah that's what he promised I'll keep you from that hour of Temptation that'll come upon the whole world now why should we look for his coming because he gave himself for us that he might redeem us from all of our iniquity see we can still get victory over our sins right or bad habits our our addictions we can still get victory over that why because he come to buy us out of that Hallelujah and he came to purify unto himself a peculiar people zealous of good works God wants people that are ready to fast ready to pray ready to give alms ready to go to church ready to worship Hallelujah amen he wants people that are zealous and ready to do it okay so it could mean that it could mean this Grace Grace could mean former Knight of Rage it could be a Grace that brings us to this uh this condition where we're ready for the coming of the Lord it could mean a third thing it could mean God is more gracious at the end time it could mean that because the Bible says in James 4 5 do you think that the scripture saith in vain the spirit that dwelleth in US lust is to Envy but he giveth more grace this is speaking God gives more grace to people that rebel against him right think about how many chances did Saul get King Saul got so many chances of Grace David got so many chances of Grace did he not Moses got so many chances of Grace yes and so the Bible says the same is true in the New Testament God gives more Grace I'm actually glad you get more grace wherefore he says God resists the proud but he giveth grace to the humble so we just got to say Jesus I'm sorry forgive me I fell short of your glory I know you'll give me more grace submit yourselves therefore to God resist the devil and he'll flee from you so you just got to say Satan get behind me I'm not going to say those words I'm not going to think those thoughts I'm not going to go there again I'm not going to buy that again I'm not going to do that again I'm going to live holy praise God draw an eye to God that restaurant come to church read your Bible pray Hallelujah go to special meetings and He will draw an eye to you cleanse your hands ye Sinners purify your hearts you double-minded hallelujah amen oh I love this verse aren't you glad he gives you more grace hallelujah amen that's what I need church that's what I need more grace it could mean because you're Abraham's seed he gives you more grace like Abraham got a lot of Grace remember those six red dots on that chart I showed six red dots right all his mistakes no doubt he's sitting every day too so he can put all he could put a dot through every chapter in there but the Bible says the law Works wrath where the law is there's no trans I'm sorry no law is there's no transgression therefore the promises of God are by faith that it might be by grace to the end the promise might be sure to all the seed not to that only which is of the law but to us also which is of the faith of Abraham who is the father of us all right if your father struggled but yet overcame the same is true for you amen now for my children it's spiritually and naturally spiritual Abraham and not me your natural father but I'm talking everybody else here if Abraham struggled yet God was with him God will be with you despite your struggles Hallelujah that's what the Bible says the promise has to be by faith not by law but by Grace Hallelujah because no man or woman can keep it on their own hallelujah oh my whatever no wonder every time brother Ram got discouraged he went read Romans chapter four he said every time a little blue I'll go read Romans chapter 4. Abraham was strong in faith giving God glory Abraham staggered not the promise of God I can say the same tonight a sister who a stagger is not the promise of god sister sir doesn't stagger at the promise of God right Lydia does not stagger at the promise of God now God doesn't stagger but he's strong in faith given God Glory Hallelujah amen that's what the Bible says because he forgives all your trespasses oh it's so true it's so true it's the Bible no let me read and I'm closing with this like this maybe take five minutes we'll see maybe 10. here's all the quotes the brother Randolph said Grace Grace so here's the quotes of brother Hammer he he Likens Grace unto the rapture so it's Ruble think about that Drupal grabbing that last stone with the ropes tied to it and placing it down and no doubt he's getting it right in place right so the the stone has no overlap it's not you know it's not sticking out the stone isn't sticking out on the corner but it's perfectly lined up that stone coming back oh it's like that stone out of the mountain in Daniel chapter Two amen hallelujah who is that someone that came back and smote the image that was Christ Hallelujah amen and here we have another Stone taking its place who's that stone Jesus Christ Hallelujah oh my oh it's beautiful I've never seen that tell that the two stones the stone in Daniel 2 and the stone here and Zechariah Chapter Four beautiful and church remember who's the Cornerstone Christ we're gonna see that a little bit who's The Headstone Christ the first and last but who's in between those two stones you and I and the Seven Church ages Saint Paul's in there right Paul iranius right Mark Martin Columbo Martin Luther John Wesley brother Brown and you all of us we're all those stones but Jesus is the first stone Jesus is the last Stone hallelujah oh that's what we're waiting for we're waiting for Christ to return amen so program reads what we read Zechariah 4 then he says he says uh yeah Grace Grace unto it okay now look what he says next right after this now this is the message of Grace if you haven't listened to that that's a beautiful message he just shows Grace in everybody's life they start with Adam and Eve and and Moses and Noah everybody had Grace everybody Made It by Grace they didn't make it by their goodness they made it by the grace of God and brother I said no wonder I've always been a man of Grace no wonder I've always been a preacher of Grace Hallelujah you too a believer of Grace because we all need it right mother says we're all acquainted with this scripture that reads the Bible we know that this was during the time of the preparation of the restoration of the temple and zeruba was a great Prince among the people who had laid the foundation of the building now you I want you to put on your spiritual thinking he said put on your anointing jacket this morning as we think and this great Prince had determined to rebuild the house of the Lord and then when he did he had laid the foundation stone and we read on further we find out that God said three of us laid the foundation with his hands he'll also bring forth The Headstone I want you to notice he never said bring forth the Cornerstone he said bring forth the headstone so his Roomba will lay the Cornerstone and now he also he's going to bring forth the headstone and we know that the scripture says Jesus Christ is the Chief Cornerstone right he's also the headstone now if we think for a few minutes that the seven Church age messenger now look here it is so as soon as he says head Sony goes right to the seven Church age messenger that's brother Brandon he was to restore the faith of the children back to the fathers in other words rebuild the church again under the power of the spirit amen so what is removable rebuilding the temple it shows God had to rebuild the church the New Testament Church right they lost the revelation of the godhead they lost the revelation of serpent seed they lost all these Revelations so God had to restore it just like cerebral had to rebuild it Hallelujah God hadn't used brother random of course you know Martin Luther and John Wesleyan and uh William Seymour at the gifts of the Spirit God had to use all them but Brethren was included and restore it all back together he had to rebuild the church Hallelujah amen that's a great thought just like the temple had to be rebuilt so does the church need to be rebuilt where upon the word of God right there's always been Church buildings God's not trying to be rebuild a church building God's trying to build the spiritual understanding of the church back together Hallelujah he said not by power not by might not by my he said but by my spirit say the Lord not an organization right I was Assemblies of God we have um Christian Missionary Alliance right we have all these uh denominations represented here Jose was in I think a Catholic he's a that was a domination Brother Ray was a Catholic he's not here tonight but just he said God doesn't build it by denomination but by the Holy Spirit God will bring forth the church in the last days amen that's right zero the prince with Joshua was the one that was to bring forth this headstone he has laid the foundation he took the people back to the foundation in time which we all know that these candlesticks and so forth represent both Jewish and church they were Olive branches the Bible said here the Olive Branch Where the wild branch that was grafted in the root of the tame Olive Tree Gentiles and out of these two branches come sensor pipes going into the seven golden candlesticks to give light to the seven churches now I just caught that now I missed that so brother half says one of the olive trees was a wild Olive Tree and one of them was just a plain Olive Tree the wild one is the Gentiles I don't know if I can prove that I don't know if that was in there up to look that up it just says two olive trees yes I don't know for sure it just says two hours I'll have to look up if there's the word wild in there but it could be I guess it could be Gentile and June right because there's two could be all right but now according to prophecy there will come The Headstone and I want you to notice that when The Headstone comes the prince is going to cry out the message will cry out Grace Grace Force by grace are we saved not of works as any man should boast and the message of Grace has been tramped under the feet of men until it's become a disgrace some of them runs out into internal security so eternal security is is like this if you said a prayer and you you you're saved you can't lose your salvation no matter how filthy you live now that's a lie that's too far right right there has to be some fruit of your salvation like the thief on the cross he was a thief but what'd he do he repented at the end right right so a man like Elvis Presley it doesn't look like he repented he died on a toilet you know what died with drug overdose and satanic Magic books doesn't look like he repented he said some runs out onto oh everything but the true message of Grace Remains the Same there's where Satan tries to knock it out from the church but it's by grace that we're all saved by we got theologians saying doctor is a divinity great smart men educated all over the world that's smart intelligent educated but it takes the Simplicity of believing God to make his word speak out to show that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever I love this it takes a humble Heart Church dedicated to God to bring Jesus and into present tense amen right I've said this before you've heard me say it amongst my friends that are not in the message that are Christians I've never heard greater testimonies than the testimonies amongst our church and our believers in other words I've seen more Supernatural amongst message people than denominational people right and that makes sense because we should be the real humble ones because we believe all the Bible I heard good testimonies but I've never heard his powerful testimony says what we have amongst us that's just my that's my own personal testimony right and I include that all the message churches where they've had they've had women who had no hair grow back an entire head of hair they've had cancer is he a leukemia is healed right you know I put all of them in there because we're brothers some of those preachers are preaching our church brother Joe Adams is one of them he told the testimony actually when he was here last time years ago we're gonna have Lord willing have him back if it's taken theology that that what would the Presbyterian Methodist Baptist Catholic and so forth they wouldn't have it he wouldn't have a chance of us poor unlearned people but it doesn't take knowledge not by might not by power but by my spirit God said I'll unfold this mystery so now he connects grace to the mysteries of God first he connected to Malachi four five and six I'll turn your hearts back to the fathers and now he connects it to Revelation 10 7 finishing the mysteries of God his ministry he will cry to it Grace Grace with shoutings and crying that's what it is today God's Amazing Grace to his people how he takes the illiterate unlearned and shows them Jesus is the same amen amen glory now a new sermon he said God has taken the elect out of the Pentecostal Church pulling it out finishing up the word it's got to be so closer to the word itself will blend with this word then the headstones come crying Grace Grace Amazing Grace the headstone here you are like this see how it way down here it keeps getting closer closer to the ministry after a while here comes Luther justification Justified here come Leslie Sanctified bunch here come Pentecost the restoration of the gifts now God is taking from there honing out a bunch to make a Ministry just exactly like that word there because it's got to fit with the word there's the bride take her up hallelujah amen so we have to have a Ministry that matches the ministry of Jesus Christ Luther had a powerful testimony Wesley had a powerful testimony I read you uh William Seymour had a powerful testimony but they were lacking some of the Bible now what we've got we've got the Bible now we need some of those powerful testimonies right we talked about that we need more power and I believe God will send it we've got to be patient we can't make God do anything we can ask we can seek we got to wait on God Hallelujah we got to keep trusting God it's not by our might it's by God's spirit the Lutheran justification he's like it represents like feet Wesley sanctification Pentecostals under the arms he said uh now we come to the Head Capstone Grace Grace the Capstone cried so brother man kind of Likens uh uh you know the the last three Church ages to like God building a body right Luther's defeat and then we're the head so Wesley must be somewhere in here Hallelujah The Headstone crying what Grace Grace passed from death and Creed into a Living Word of the Living God Hallelujah that's what I told uh I'll just say his name I just write to our brother cool a number of years ago I said I said uh I appreciate your church brother I said it to my mom too I said I appreciate the church mom but you're living off bylaws and your bylaws don't have all the Bible in them so you're living off a Creed you've got to come out of Creeds and bylaws and you've got to come into the word of God I say that with love I said it was love Hallelujah a Living Word of the Living God God's only provided plan for his age his sons in the word age quickened by the spirit like a spark that's lit off something to make it alive how many got a sparked for God tonight eight in the head Hallelujah we got to have a spark of Life something that sets us apart something that puts us on fire Hallelujah amen he said we're seated now in Heavenly places present tense already alive and subject to every promise in the word and what does it do you being a part of God's Gene a part of the word other men a part of God's word seated together manifest the entire body of Christ because there's no leaven among you no love and among you just the word only seen in Heavenly places is the door where he puts his name Christ Jesus see so the closer we get to the Rapture the more we're gonna have God's grace to get rid of our sinfulness right we're going to get closer to God Hallelujah and then right before he comes we're going to have a fresh anointing that's going to make us even more holy we'll still sin but I don't know how long we'll go without sitting maybe we'll go days without sinning wouldn't that be awesome we'll have the anointing a rapturing faith Hallelujah because this last the last Stone has to match the headstone so the words Christ The Rapture is The Headstone but we're that last Stone where that last Stone and it's got to fit perfectly and it will because of the anointing praise God the holy in other words the holy spirit will bring our lives to where they need to be just like the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost brought the lives of those those 120 they had to be praying for 10 days well what is God going to do for us if we're going to go in the rapture they just went from law to Grace what is God going to do for us if we're going to go from this world to the meeting in the air praise God yeah what is God going to do for us I'm excited I don't know but I'm excited Hallelujah it's got to be something great because that stone Jesus Christ has to match the final Stone right all right and I'm posing with that let me just read this here now here's what I want to close it I just put that Abraham video out uh yesterday it's just an encouragement to you God proved his body change promises to Abram M Sarah even though Abraham and Sarah both laughed when God said I'm going to give you a child through you Abraham and Sarah they both laughed even though they both laughed at the body change promised God still brought it to pass God made them believe it amen and I apply that to our body change the Rapture God is going to make us believe it right when we see dead ones come back to life probably when we see Paul or brother random or Martin we're going to believe Hallelujah how do we know because we're already believing what they preached Hallelujah Paul preached the Lord Jesus Christ baptism the godheads one person Hallelujah the promises of God the Miracles the gifts of the Spirit that we all believe in praise God Paul preached all those things and so we're preaching his message so God I'm trusting God will do the same for us he will prove that the body change is for us because we're Abraham seed we have faith in Jesus Christ and the real Jesus Christ not a denominational Jesus Christ but the Jesus Christ of the Bible Hallelujah who's here tonight praise God let's say to our feet God I thought I'd preach a little shorter there by the grace of God back to school courson I was sick I didn't have no I feel like I got energy now but I know that's a little uh adrenaline there but maybe the Holy Spirit and I believe God Can Heal Me thoroughly tonight but I don't want to take any chances here that's a good enough message tell me enjoy that tonight so it's been over 10 years since I preached that verse so I thought I would preach it again what encouragement I may preach again on this on Sunday to kind of bring it out to the whole church but it's such a blessing I was so blessed I heard the preacher say I'm like oh yeah that's right I forgot about that type and then it ties in with Rahab with a shout there it ties it with Abraham's body change it's a beautiful type there and so we are we're convinced I'm convinced by the Bible I'm sure you are too as brother Brandon was trying to convince us that Grace Grace represents the Rapture God giving us Grace for the Rapture for Christ that final headstone now while you're uh while you're standing let's read those verses on Christ the The Headstone here okay it's a Luke 20 verse 17. yeah do you want to put that out there because I unplugged this time thank you in Luke 2017 and he beheld him and said what is this then that is written the stone which the builders rejected the same has become the head of the corner Israel rejected Christ think about that they didn't want to build their Church on Jesus Christ they rejected him but we are built on Christ amen hallelujah hallelujah thank God my life your life our church is built on Jesus Christ amen we have not rejected him we've received him do we want to receive more yes there's more for us hallelujah amen but we have received them acts 4 11 honey we just got we'll just quickly go through these x411 this is the stone which was set at not of you Builders which has become the head of the corner Hallelujah and don't forget I preached this a few years ago on Mother's Day for our sisters the Bible Likens a Godly woman to a Cornerstone that's quite a compliment for a woman God bless you a woman is compared to Jesus Christ as a Cornerstone sisters said don't you feel like that like all the stresses of your husband is on you don't you feel like you carry that load that's what the Bible says our sisters are like cornerstones sister Lena's like a Cornerstone now she got all the way to her husband right get all the way to your husband Lord willingness God blesses you with children you have all the way the children on you like when I was sick on Monday night who was all the weight on who was bringing me uh all those Herbal Remedies my wife right is all on her she started to get some supper ready she's got to do a lot I'm laying there in bed I can't even couldn't sleep for like 20 some hours in a row awful well probably that's probably the only migraine I've ever had in my life it was totally awful but who is the Cornerstone in my house my wife but who's the ultimate Cornerstone Jesus Christ right right remember Eve was a part of Adam the church is a part of Christ Ephesians 2 19. now therefore are ye No More Strangers and foreigners but you are fellow citizens with the Saints of the household of God here's what I was mentioned earlier and our bill upon the foundation of the Apostles and Prophets Jesus Christ being or himself being the Chief Cornerstone remember Jesus is the Cornerstone and Paul's like the foundation Stones next to the Cornerstone and you are standing on top of that amen hallelujah I'm not standing on his denomination I'm standing on Christ Hallelujah I'm standing on the apostles I'm standing on Peter I'm standing on James and John I'm standing on them thank God they live their lives because now I can stand on their lives right and if there's another generation my children can stand on my life my testimony if God Terry's another generation go to verse 21 in whom all the building fitly frame together growth unto a holy Temple of the Lord and whom ye also are built together for habitation of God through the spirit Hallelujah so Jesus is the Cornerstone that first stone and then Paul Peter James Young all the seven Church ages and now you are this part of this final Seven Stone the Bible said you're not a deadstone you're a Lively Stone you're just not a dead formal church member but no God's spirit is living in you amen like these these walls they don't sing out right they're part of the building they don't sing out they're not alive but you and I do we're like stones we're like stones that are living we're like uh we're like we We join the worship we're not separate from the worship we're a part of the worship God lives through US amen we're the building of God imagine if these walls could sing would that be awesome right that's what that's what the body of Christ is like it's like a temple where even the stones can sing even the stones can say praise God hallelujah amen thank God Jesus said if they don't cry out even these stones will cry Hallelujah so we're the spiritual stones that are crying out giving glory to God Almighty amen amen so again Jesus is the Cornerstone all the Believers are the stones in the in the temple and then Jesus Christ is The Headstone he comes down in the Rapture and they're shouting all around crying Grace Grace how many thankful for Grace tonight it doesn't shout legalism legalism doesn't shout self-righteousness self-righteousness it shouts Grace Grace amen think about any good time you've had in the Lord how did it happen by God's grace right yeah you might have been a little more dedicated that week but you weren't perfect that week how'd it come by God's grace Grace God's grace let's bow our heads why don't you just play that again Grace Grace God's grace oh that's a lovely scripture I trust you were blessed tonight by that mind The Headstone was shoutings unto it Grace Grace Hallelujah God's going to give us the Bible said he gives us more grace Heavenly Father we're thankful for the word of God we've heard tonight Lord many many scriptures used here tonight Lord to show it's removable as a type of Jesus Christ the first and the last Hallelujah the Cornerstone also is The Headstone the same Stone same quality of stone Jesus Christ and Lord we realize we're the seven Church age we're that last Stone Lord we realize our ministry has to match the stone that's coming down the ministry of Jesus Christ Lord I'm always reminded of this Lord Jesus you said The Father loves me because I always do those things that please the father so Lord that's the attitude our church has to have bride of Christ Fellowship chaos Church brother Jim's Church brother Samuel's Church brother Randy size's Church we all have to have that same attitude we only do what the
