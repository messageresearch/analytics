promise very long sermon children have been pretty surprised how short I've been preaching on Sunday night yeah he only preached 32 minutes no I had an in each other one day we finally having us the Word of God and my voice does feel a lot better so I don't know if you can tell I know I know my voice out for these last two years he's like a Scottie wisdom to get it back it'll be like it's coming back it's no injuries I'm thankful for that Creason so Daniel chapter 12 were just rehearsing one again like we said on Wednesday we did chapter 11 on Wednesday when we came up after the service and said that wasn't this was an amazing message village St I was shocked so thankful you know I mean OTT I always enjoy the word but people are really blessed that God would open his word you know and really speak even then we're just teaching on Daniel but they got to able to minister to individual needs there so we're just laying off grace the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart thankful God spirit [Music] Daniel chapter 12 verse 1 I'm actually commonly got 18 slides on this others there's a very short message you need something to pull it out this time shall Michael stand up the Great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people and there should be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be problem let's our heads worth bear ask God to administer one more time come with ourselves Heavenly Father Lord we humble ourselves Lord and exalt you Lord God you know your promise if we humble ourselves you exalt us a new season all we want Lord is exalted with more of your love more of a beating heart Lord in obedience your knowledge Jesus just to be or not with you more faithful to you nor some humble ourselves we put ourselves and our plans and our ideas and I are thought secret we wait for though yours have the preeminence dear God hey we just pull on the word I'm pulling myself tonight Lord Jesus we're just grateful Lord for what you've done here Lord today thank you for the fellowship that's the papal States nor all the states that came out this morning and tonight we're grateful to be in the house the Lord you know there's no greater place to be your profits that you've never regretted coming to church one time nor wheel or gods are so grateful to be here or we were happy when they said let us go to the house of the Lord so speak my lord let us be quick to answer the Lord we look to hear we're here tonight in Jesus Christ Church said Amen me to see their praise God they got to start with the review you know of all the chapters so far so note that when you're anybody again switch over to put like I said from this morning I got one question and answer back so if I get a couple more questions and answers we'll have this question answer service on anything that's been preached what they've got anything but I'll save that one just maybe week or two if we get any other questions let's look at chapter 12 it's only 13 short verses so we'll do a quick summary here and again if anybody needs any notes or close I can just you know share this I think I've email this to one person so far Daniel chapter one was Daniel his friends they'll kind of place positionally you know find them in Babylon and programs that's a perfect title to hit on one Babylon midst of Babylon yet we're in the bride age at the same time because the bride age is a spiritual condition and it's a spiritual condition is the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen we are in label to see it but that label to see them just living in it but ramps fixed exact questions and answers the souk seaport tells them they go to see a church age has not ended it ends at the rapture but we're living in the word age we know that the bride age you don't we know that that's the baptismal holy ghost chapter two is very prophetic it is very prophetic brother Graham gave it with rough state the Lord so it's extremely important about Nebuchadnezzar's dream because it's the times of the Gentiles and we went so awesome we went over some of those quotes on Wednesday night from chapter 11 if you think a chance listen to that we want some well or more of those quotes Rome and America the churches in America have to gain strength politically in order to start getting rich spot where they could possibly persecute the true bride but then Christ comes raptures her before the plot of the Antichrist could be carried out so that's what we're seeing now you know wishing evangelicals rally around Trump partly and every time I'm on Facebook that's easy you got a Jellico's you know like I said the Billy Graham Sun different ones all packing on the back like I said like you saw Wednesday he might be anointed of God just like Cyrus was nobody nicer but it's not anointing in the soul if you can continue you know doing and sanding some of the things that they do so that's just no we just gotta stay safe state it straight you don't got me straight but with love not against the people were just against the system behind them chapter three of course was prophetic as well brother Graham liking that one to the end time with a three-wheeler children the Prophet wasn't there brother grant upset and so they made an image to the Prophet and bowing down to the Prophet and of course we see that around different ranks people almost worshiping brother Graham saying every word he said was infallible and things like that that some of some have said some awful things like that making it babbles off for the awfulest doctors she said now everything you said was gonna save the Lord that's infallible right that's a metal but not every single word so chapter 4 of course Nebuchadnezzar getting the heart of the beast and then not humbling in through there was a great message on humility stay humble before God because God's put you in whatever position here and we saw that this morning from victory hitting whatever position you're in well the Graham said don't despise that he said serve God in it any bed chapter five was a handwriting on the wall the follow-up about shazar so went from the gold head right my bad line down to the chest and arms of silver the Medes and Persians so we saw that chapter 5 chapter 6 Daniel the lion's den very familiar story to us there chapter 7 very prophetic chapter the vision of the form we see those same four beasts all rolled up into one beast in Revelation 13 so go grab so there's all those demon spirits and Babylon needs the furnaces in ancient Greece and ancient Rome all rolled in to the Roman Catholic Church and Holy Roman Empire then we saw the white throne judgment and that's of course very prophetic and then the fourth beast we see another picture of the Antichrist in fact that's not even first picture the Antichrist in Daniel chapter 7 remember that the chapter 8 we see the RAM and the he-goat Moran was mean to Persia the he-goat was the Grecian Empire we see how exactly the great in there a lot of great prophetic things in chapter 8 and then we show you the little horn at the end a little horn on the fourth beast that's the Antichrist we see as we preach on that a lot of it it showed all the quotes I could find for brother Branham on that little and on the Antichrist and it just lines up exactly what the church age book says it's going after the government going after politics aren't you glad to be a part of our sorrow away from that not only might be a part not a part of a part I'm far from that one word apart far from that I'm not in we're not involved with that we don't we don't feel like Oh as a church used to try to influence the government our greatest influence is in influencing the government of happening and prayers and petitions to God that's our greatest weapon that we have not to rally around politics and politicians because program said every man he knew that when the politics got corrupted every single one he says I'm as close as President Jefferson felt I think I preached other last year if I'm not mistaken he said everyone when I was a crunch and that's why we stayed a million miles away from politics chapter 9 was Daniel 7 weeks very prophetic chapter no mother man gave us that 1961 6 full purpose of Gabriel's visit calling there we appreciate in chapter 10 to visit the age of the great interpretations remember that was the valley said I do make 21 days and it just reminded us of God's faithfulness and prayer amen that the into the answer will come Daniel right the answer will come when you pray when you set your face to see God God will answer it we met so we were very encouraged by that we just keep waiting on the promises of God and Wednesday we looked at the fall of the Persian and Greek empires that's what that was all about at the beginning of the chapter the king of the north was ancient Greece and the King of the South was Egypt but then later on we know the keel nor turns into Russia so there's a transition I believe it's around verse 35 I'm not mistaken and then the king of the north and not becomes prophetic of Russia Boban told us the North is Russia because once it's the once it starts with a bow purse I think that's verse 21 you start transitioning into the type of Antiochus the form as the Antichrist and then the chapter ends as we saw one tonight on the invasion of Israel the Antichrist literally invades Israel he stands the temple of God saying that he's God something himself above all that is called God and he stops the daily sacrifice we saw that as well there's a little more on that tonight that's a little bit over Daniel chapter 12 as well for three and a half years the Jews don't have their temple rebuilt and they'll have at the end be sacrificed or the Ministry of the three net are the two prophets of three half years but then in the midst of that covenant I believe it's going to be a 7-year covenant but in the midst of that covenant the last half of Daniels 70 week gets fulfilled right and then he breaks the Covenant and then he stops the daily sacrifice but then the Jews receive Christ amen 144,000 program said receive the same Pentecostal message that the two Hebrew that the two prophets are preaching or hate men he said that in numerous places the profits of that and then chapter 12 tonight very simple it's just too few topics it deals with the tribulation and the Jewish remnant and then there's time there's over two months of time after that three and a half years ends after the free have your tribulation ends there's still two months and 15 days after that where all these other things happen probably probably before the millennium if I'm not mistaken I could be wrong about me that's the next step after the tribulation comes the millennium alright so there's the review is that a good review we reviewed a little bit I do go back and check I forgot some of the chapters what they were aren't you dying the books over to you a memo BAM said it would be open to the last days so let me go up here I will just preach all the way right through this book it will probably be very brief here make it to buy about me surprised so they're very thankful by God's grace art 12 and you know part of that is futures because there's very few quotes you know on these things I tried looking up these quotes that are looking up this the phrases and they're just not a lot in there remember program was tying the loose ends together anytime the loose ends the message together hit the highlights and then the things that he gave us thus saith the Lord on we just tie everything together and it helps us interpret the whole book there's not a whole lot that's too mysterious okay so this is Daniel chapter 12 the background is that this jogger takes place in the same year at the same time as chapters 10 and 11 because it's all the same visit from the angel that broke through after 21 days he hasn't left yet he's still there stating telling Daniel what's going to happen so it's by a 36 BC and he's 84 years olds here's an older man and he's still putting his face setting his face to see God's face verse 1 a very important verse program let me just read the quote first so you got this I don't remember when I preached it some of it I went through all the times with random reference Daniel in the church age book I believe there were six if I'm not mistaken okay so he connects he says revelation 7 part 8 is the same scene as Daniel 12:1 he said now that with this that with see Daniel 12:1 which refers to these 144,000 being sealed during the sixth seal and the time of the great tribulation or Jacob's trouble so we know prophetically exactly where Daniel 12 verse 1 is that's the Tribulation Period and the sealing of 144,000 so as we go back there verse 1 at that time shall Michael stand up now at that time her first it's carrying on the word and of course it always has this is a conjunction time he senses together so he's referring to the time of the Antichrist there in Israel at that time the time with Antichrist in history Michael the Great Prince who stands for the turn of Israel he said stand in for turn of thy people and there she entitled trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time at that time thy people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book so Michaels the Great Prince right he's the Archangel Bible causing the Archangel and Jude one night and there's something special about Michael he's always connected to body changes right he always connected the body change and the Holy Ghost because when Moses his body was lost Satan came to Michael Michael member beyou give me my mom I'm sorry Michael did bring an accusation against it he just rebuked him it's at the heart of Law Review thing so somehow Michael had a connection to the body change and of course we know after 144,000 um are sealed we know shortly after that they have to get a body change because the Lydians gonna set it they gotta have a brand new body at some point so Michael has some great connection as a heart angel time of trouble bro man just told us was the Great Tribulation Period the ievo course is 144,000 and they're delivered because their names are on the Lamb's Book of Life so this is the ceiling so I really this is a spiritual deliverance although I do have quotes it I don't have money here by you to have a quote about program says 144,000 won't die but then there's other quotes where he says they will die so I don't know it's like that I know I can tell you my opinion but I don't know for sure as far as what he said so will they perish you know in the number of the fifth seal he said they would perish remember that's that's a 1963 series of the seven seals he said because they're the martyrs that the soul some of the officer crying out and they said we'll just wait your brethren have to give their lives as well program said that was the 144,000 but then later he says they don't so you know we just got a different thought so just for me the word deliverance there at least means the baptism of Holy Ghost they're delivered for you all I brought into the grave see so that's first one now that's all if you said Provenza that's all tribulation we know we know where this is by people it's Israel Daniels people now verse two Daniel's informed of the white throne judgment which is really striking what a jump that is you know it goes from right there to the tribulation right to the white throne judgment upon each other and many of them that sleep so it may seem they're skipping a thousand years so between verse 1 and 2 the Angels gifts a thousand years and many of them had sleep in the dust of the earth shall awake some to everlasting life and some to shame and everlasting contempt that has to be the white throne judgment it has to be because Jesus said in John 5:28 all those in the grave will hear his voice right and they all come forth because that's the bottom said if they're sleeping in the dust I was sleeping in the dust so this is speaking of the white throne judgment and then Jesus call this in that b25 Jesus call this the resurrection unto life or the resurrection of the condemnation or contempt so that's that's what the word is it's content there so quite a jump right for Marcelin diversity have a jump over thousand years but in God's idea one day with the Lord as a thousand years with made notices it's no great time in God's eyes because he's had a type now verse 3 I mentioned this a little bit when we preach a few weeks ago on the Stars the reward of the Morningstar verse 3 says and they that be wise shall shine as the brightness of the Harmony and they that turn many to righteousness as the stars for ever and ever amen so the Bible said this is what the wise doing speaking of Daniels people so the wives of Daniels people with those who receive the prophets they receive the Pentecostal prophets and they get sealed with the baptism of the Holy Ghost oh there we go they mourn for a whole day right they go from house to house door to door oh how could we crucify our Messiah but that the Bible said the nation will be born in one day and I seen a 66 they met that nation will be born in one day and they're called the wise to see how their wives virgin Rexie that they're going to be wise because they're born again so we need to be amen wise with the Holy Spirit hallelujah and then he says and also they that turn many to righteousness we'll shine the stars forever amen so kind of gives us the illustration of romance in with you in the soul your name is wrapped around that crowd forever right it kind of gives the illustration of a shiny crowd some type of life you know the eternal life of a brand-new body you know if it out fyodor find body so soul wedding is so crucial even for the Jews right but also for us God honors it he said I give you the Morningstar even in other words the light the light of God Himself you have the light of God you become the light of God you're a shining star amen all right first forward but the how Daniel shut up the words and seal the book even to the time of the end many shall run to and fro and knowledge shall be increased now you said seal it up which Daniel didn't know but it's gonna be over 2,500 years sealed up Daniel you almost got three thousand years so this is a people are you to understand this can you imagine why this has been the juice that lighted this book for almost 3,000 years but we understand it amen why because that branch was cut off but we were grafted in the root be holy so the branch ain't so because we have the holy spirit and God sent His Prophet now we understand the holy book thank God first mercy and he said is that the time when many shall run to and fro so see that's got to be the modern transportation people running across the oceans you know fly it across the ocean of the six hundred miles per hour in the air all kinds of speed and of course knowledge shall be increased the digital age where we have everything right at our head I love Malachi that when we go back and forth it's just a simple example but we go before we have our conversation that wasn't then I said oh no let me ask Google you know then I got all the knowledge right there he's hearing with this meter what what does that mean we just got that all the knowledge of our hand we don't take that for granted we don't want to look Syria ham all knowledge we want to grow in the knowledge of God ourselves amen but the knowledge you've got to be written up on our hearts because that's the most important knowledge the Word of God that's why I don't feel that I don't know everything about anything else that's fine but I want to know about the Word of God I want to know the master chain then I would know guys I don't know the book good day never know the whole Bible amen yes that's the true ecology now verse 5 then I Daniel looked and behold there stood other two so he's already got one danger there but now there's two more and the one on this side of the bank of the river and the other on the side of the bank of the river verse 6 and one said to the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the ribs look he's hovering over the water what a picture there I'm gonna fix you the angel hovered one block how long shall it be to the end of these wonders see these are all wonders right the tribulation and the sealing of 144,000 lynnium all these things white throne judgment the wise shining the stars these are all wonders he said what is the end of these wonders and verse 6 verse 7 I heard the man clothed in linen which was upon the waters of the river when he held up his right hand and his left hand unto heaven and swear by him that liveth forever that should be four time times and a half and we and when he shall have accomplished to scatter the power of the holy people all these things shall be finished that's there's a lot of us right there so let's just go through that a little slowly slowly by God's grace and that's that angel stuff a lot like Revelation 2:10 he raised his hand and swear by him to live forever and ever night this sounds a lot like that how the angel with the angel brings the Word of God and gives you the oath this is thus saith the Lord you know it he's standing there brother have said this was this angel is the same thing in John chapter 10 milligram said that wasn't Christ he said this was just the Ange of the Lord because this angel couldn't defeat the Prince of Persia remember that and tell me what could you wanted to believe Christ hood and defeat of Prince of Persia but Nieman this can't be Christ but he does very similar things so they need to a revelation 10 he needed help from Michael right I'm sorry game was a game room game room I think his game he doesn't gain roughly to overcome now verse 7 the first thing I thought of there is the time times and a half soon right now something struck me yes I've read that before and the Holy Spirit programs that will always point you back to the word so that means the time times and a half means the Tribulation Period because the immediately hell that in the book of Revelation is revelation 12:14 and the woman and to the woman were given two wings of a great Eagle that she might fly into the wilderness into her place where she is nourished for a time times and a half a time from the face of the surface almost the exact same words right America Revelation 12 he said this is exact quote Revelation chapter 12 does not pertain to the bride this is Israel and this is after the manchild is grown up and he's been exhausted to the throne right goes right ahead him father and then the the woman has to flee for a time times and a half time that's the Tribulation Period so in other words that Ange would ask well how long to the east and he says I swear it'll be a time times and half the times you see all these things Daniels preaching about the Jews they don't happen to the Tribulation Period because they're cut off right but God is not going to forsake Israel they'll say I was did all the call call the name of Lord shall be saying hey man God's not gonna forsake his people how they live here either really forsake us amen glory let me go back there so the angel tells it it has to be for the Tribulation Period for us that's how we understand these things will happen then so all these things will be finished when he know then he gets into that next part here this is important to all they seem to be finished when he's the Antichrist shall have accomplished to scatter the power the holy people so in other words got the weights out of the three half years then the Antichrist breaks the Covenant and he has to scatter the powers of the holy people and program said that was to take away the daily sacrifice I'm showing you right here you see there's a lot in here in their light it's pretty vo3 deep in here so let me know here's there's two quotes we have both are from the 1961 series on Daniel he appreciates two weekends in a row programs reading this scripture he's actually reading Daniel 12 seven in 1961 he says and when he personal pronoun now the Antichrist shall accomplish to scatter the part of the people that's when he breaks his covenant in the the week so somehow they have power right until the Covenant is broken he scatters their power and all these things shall be fulfilled amen he says that the next Sunday so the next time he says this beast this prince that shall scatter the power of the holy people what will he do he will break his covenant with them amen three and half years so Houston after a between a year so awesome now people think that's economy doesn't fear of God as he said if you think that the Spirit of God hasn't dealt with you yet look at that all right he said the Holy Spirit is not working you haven't dealt with yet if you still think the Antichrist is communism it's wrong the Bible says be so close though the seeds of bear legend if we're possible jesus said it so we're in the last day alright now think that's everything in there the time time to have tribulation and scatter the power people is where he breaks to cover it at the end of the trip at the end of the 390 years I'm starting it at the last half of Daniels 70th week everybody get this by God's grace is this okay all right amen I don't want you my love to understand the Bible you might have an answer somebody asked what Disney we like to know what it exactly says amen verse 8 now 8 9 and 10 are kind of straightforward you're not allowed we're almost done here magazine I might have three more slides alright verse 8 you believe it how many minutes I got me okay so far I'm here you got six three hundred thirty minutes today mercy but it does help my voice let those out and plus we learn the words of God verse eight and I heard but understood not not Church understand this right this is only God's grace no wonder Danny that understand God had to reveal it to him it and the mysteries hadn't finished yet right so we would have been the same situation so humbly you don't think it doesn't understand I said oh my lord what shall be the end of these things they see he was thunders dead isn't that like every Christian you want to understand the word of that you and I would understand although there's prophecies I don't understand all the messages I want to understand but he asks and God has to turn it down verse 9 and he said go he's asking I was some more time with the angel tell me about these thing he said go you're waiting for the words are closed up and sealed to the time of the end but you know one thing is that wonderful about God he can't give it to you it's wonderful when he tells you I can't understand why it's not for right now in church even if he doesn't tell us why certain things have in our life we know they'll tell us better will understand it better by and by we know perhaps that that's part of the reward of believer he'll be letting us know all of our questions and answers for all eternity if he's an eternal being it takes an eternity to know again but we love how God saw at your mercy it's not time to reveal it it's not gonna reveal it it'll tell us just not for right now he said these are closed and sealed up so see how I have to be the breaking of the seven seals and Lucido the seals need to be broken in that morgue amen other than until the time of the end which he told us was running to and fro and knowledge increased you know that end time verse 10 a good person many shall be purified to the end time they shall be purified and made white and tried but the wicked shall do wickedly and none of the wicked shall understand but the wise shall understand in that blessing you and I can understand God's Word why his we're spiritually wise by his Spirit right the simplicity of God mask on the view yourself dose and your simplicity and God always knives himself in simplicity it's the honor and glory of kings to search out a man or praise God that's the glory of Kings to fight it amen because we're kings of reefs spiritual kings and future kings physically we know in the future home Lord willing by God's grace we'd be privileged to be a part of that she's one of the rewards was rule over nations remember that being a king ruling over nation that's one of the were the amazing rewards to the believer so again we see how important your works are whenever we're talking to preach on that lately well I know that works the wicked will do wickedly the righteous do righteously the lies will be wise with God's Word amen now we're so thankful to understand the words of Daniels book by the opening of the Seventh Seal so you can only come that way by God's grace verse 11 is the last well the last verse talks about the daily sacrifice so let's look at verse and I am I put all the quotes on the daily sacrifice in Wednesday's sermons so if you don't watch that there's I think there's three or four quotes on that that I read how the Antichrist breaks the Covenant and takes away the daily sacrifice so I didn't put them on here but they were on their own Wednesday we went over that Outlands day so wherever you go she could read those one was from the first seal I don't know it's for the Daniel series another question answer 64k alright verse 11 and from that time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away and the abomination that maketh desolate set up program said that's Rome over spreading and taking over the temple but man said it's the overspreading of the Roman abomination so he breaks the covenant takes away their sacrifice and then he fills the temple and he sits in the temple and says that he is God program so that's the role in overspreading of abominations they meant Rome taking over the house of God high striking he says from the time from that time the other sacrifice to the foundation making desolation set up there shall be a thousand two hundred and ninety days now this would be a thousand PMS three half years plus 30 days so 1290 is three and half years plus another month okay my math is right 30 days in a month so this tells us that after for three and a half years there's still a month gonna happen with Rome with the Antichrist there's still a month in that space you haven't finished the last half of the 70th week then there's a month where the overspreading of abominations perhaps the war you know with Israel Rome there and Russia a lot of things going on there's another month for that time there's a lot to happen in a month you know that now verse 12 blessed is he that waiteth and cometh to the thousand three hundred and five and thirty days so beyond this we're given 1335 days so even so beyond the three half years into two months which one of the months is mentioned right here 1290 days so beyond so once the once God finishes a 70th week there's still two months and 15 days for things to happen plenty of time right to claim time for things that happen this wouldn't be a reveal or this would involve things with the Antichrist Rome Russia the destruction of Babylon in Revelation 18 there's a lot of things that happen so there's you know 45 days there I'm sorry 60 75 days there for lots of things to happen after the prophets are raptured up right is after their ministries over 3 up here's they die the raptured up and then there's still 75 days for things to happen after the two prophets go off the scene Israel's got to be born and as a as a nation you'll got to receive the Holy Ghost so the Bible Lots that extra time that's for 75 days after the three and a half years of series last verse but go that way until the end be for thou shalt rest and stand in thy lot at the end of the days so Daniels told he said go their way it's sealed up not guilty now he said go your way you're gonna rest you're gonna have to go to the grave right and then you're gonna stand in your lives he's gonna stand at the white throne judgment right as a believer he'll stand there in his portion and just like you and I are going to stand in our portion right we'll stand the Laodicea gonna have said every messenger will stand with his age and God will judge the church age first by the messenger right because Paul said I'm gonna present you as a chaste virgin to Christ how many glad that will standing right there my brother branham you glad about that did he preach the wall breaks they're arresting on that they even had we're resting on that whilst in an r-la are later see a lot and there's brother Brennan as the messenger the seven star car age and he'll say I preach exactly what Paul preached day many and will stand there and answer the beer awards given out of course you know then the marriage supper and then the millennial reign and then the white throne judgment and then the future home how many bring folks with a lot God has given you photograph said it's God would ask me anytime to preach what you would have preached he said I would appreciate this time this lot because this is the fulfillment and the conclusion of all of the prophets spoke of that they really been right now what amazing time to live it right a glorious time for the believer it's the most awful time for the sinner what's the most glorious time for the believer let's in our feet praise God so how do you feel on the Book of Daniel ready feel good about it by God's grace I hope you do about God's grace how many questions let me know Alexis I've only got one question with any other questions be happy to take those to me it's just it's just a fantastic thing you go through an entire book of the Bible Ryan II went through a Nehemiah Esther and different books of the Bible in Galatians went through the entire book and be able to call him right through the scripture and church we got to do what brother branham wish he had time to do did I go three said I wish you if you just comb through and just take a month and just go through the entire book of Joe the different ones like that so glad we get to do it aren't you glad we get to do it even as we said we weren't to fall in love with this kind of knowledge the knowledge of God's Word that's just our heads ears have a word prayer and I'll just worship their closing song how many father I just want to say we're grateful for the lot that we stand in today none of us asked Lord when we would come upon the earth Laura none of us had any part of that but as your Provost said if you would have asked him he would want to be at the very culmination who'd been at the climax of all human history the second coming of Jesus Christ Lord we're not just one man like II neither Elijah would have a body change but a many members Universal bride would escape the tribulation through body change through the power of life swallowing up death what a lot we have to one of the lot that we're standing in in this we can see Lord how our life relates is the type of Daniel we must stand if we're all alone we must stand a bits of Babylon it was Keith the Word of God be prayer warriors they be faithful never bow down that anything that even looks close if it's off the word by one word and the Lord like Daniel we want to know where we have wanted to know about this book so Lord you open the seals and we say thank you Lord God that we understand the bumpier god of us to be wise in this our redeem the time give our time to the things of God we're grateful for this lot

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] tonight you have time for a quick test okay nice rhetoric that's when I got an email the other day on one of the videos we put there on Facebook or on YouTube and just so you know also I've got the serpent see part one done and I've already got a little bit good feedback on that this week I should get parts two and three done already got a hundred views that's pretty encouraging and but the testimony we do pretty good almost have a hundred fifty thousand views on all those message videos don't you like that I'm just really so here's the testimony a woman named Amy said she watched our modest clothing in the Bible videos and she was completely convicted I want to change her entire wardrobe she said she'd have any money I said we'll have you tried Goodwill and here's her testimony she sent this morning at 1 a.m. out of the baby she lives 3 hours of the other but God's amazing she forgot she had a 25 dollar income tax check come in and then she unexpectedly got 500 and her deposit so she went to Goodwill and found seven skirts and seven shirts and she sent me a picture her old wardrobes changed and now she's dressed like a saint this want to share that with you you know I hope we never asked for testimonies but it sure is good when God backs up his wording that you see lives change remember go read the Bible Jesus said programs the same thing a woman the dress immodestly and presents herself like that should be guilty of adultery on the day of judgment so Church of this thankful they're good to see God changing lives I couldn't go preach to her but God use the Internet just like God used to use tape services brother branham or I'm sorry both hookups yeah then tape services right tape but I just want to share that with you said God is so so amazing and all the clothes are a new condition I mean it's just the hand of God are so glad God's a provider that's good Laura that's as much as virus for a word prayers we closed Heavenly Father we thank you oh how we love Jesus Lord and these testimonies they mean so much to me but Lord you said we overcome by the blood of the Lamb and the word of our testimony thank you for giving us a testimony or we're just passing on the truth that you give it to us we're just passing on and more like Daniel said he of course was talking about Jews but I believe it's true for the Gentiles we want to make many white and we want them to be purified by the Word of God thank you for giving us this look Leslie this week lordy God truly your Jehovah Jireh truly when money's tonight you know how to meet every need you know how they have closed a good way Oh Lord you know how to heal the sick you
