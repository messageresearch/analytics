journey Lord we give you praise in all things and we give you thanks in Jesus name I pray amen amen well you may be seated for a moment amen thank you I'm not a singer so I won't linger up here and sing um just uh I wanted to greet you first before I I get into the message and thank brother Jesse for inviting us out and having confidence in in us to to bring a message to his congregation so thank you very much I appreciate that um and my wife said that I should tell you a little bit about myself before preach um uh my parents um were in the message I was so I was born uh coming to church um you know so I was born and raised in the church um and I believe brother Paul and sister Tris were also uh in the church at that time as well um so eser and I actually grew up together in in in the church we have pictures you know of us this this small together at parties and such um I didn't notice her in that way until I was 19 but um you know I I grew up in the church um but uh God doesn't have grandchildren right amen um so when I was in high school and try to figure out things for myself and U had backslid um trying to do my own way my own things um but at the age of 19 was a freshman in in college um God had uh revealed his grace to me um and and save saved my soul that was in 1992 in December um and I had my own plans but he had other plans for me and you know it's a true conversion when you know after you're saved you can't get enough of the work am I know for that whole next year or year and a half or so um just drink drink drink um you know diving into the messages from Malachi 4 and just you know I think I we listening to one of your messages last night you said it's like fireworks you hear this message is fireworks for the first time it's you know Dawning on you and the Revelation is just so strong um and that was the foundation that God gave me to take me through life's journey over the next 30 30 years amen um so uh this evening um is is going to be a an exort exhortation um a little testifying um and some teaching um so we just stand for the reading of the word I'm going to read from Psalms 107 starting at verse 1-9 and my title this evening is oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness amen so Psalms 107 says oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever amen let the redeemed of the Lord say so so whom he hath redeemed from the hand of the enemy and gathered them out of the lands from the East and from the west from the north and from the south they wandered in the wilderness in a solitary way they found no City to dwell in hungry and thirsty their souls fainted in them then they Cried unto the Lord in their trouble and he delivered them out of their distresses and he led them forth by the right way that they may go to a city of habitation oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the children of men for he satisfieth the longing soul and filth the hungry soul with goodness amen I want to also read from Isaiah 26 verse 3 and 4 AM amen Isaiah 26 verse three and four I'm gon to make myself comfortable here do that I take it in he takes his Co quite often amen Isaiah 26 verse three thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee trust ye in the Lord forever for the Lord Jehovah is Everlasting strength amen you may be seated so again my title is oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and in this Psalm Psalms 107 um there's multiple sections to it uh verses 1 through three is thanking the Lord let the redeemed of the Lord say so verses 4-9 is the Lord giving help to those that are finding a new city uh verses 10 through 16 the lord gave help to those that are in prison uh verses 17 to 22 the lord gave help to those who were sick uh verse 23-32 the lord gave help to those on the sea and then verse 3 3 to 43 it's the Lord talking about the wonderful things that he does and so in in reference to testimony um you know brother Paul and I often say that I don't really like to call myself a preacher per se I just love the word and as I'm in the word and he shows me stuff or teaches me stuff in my life I like to share I like to share with others to help them along the journey um so in my devotions and it was a year ago on May 31st uh last year this was uh my daily devotion for the day I was reading Psalms 107 and then when the Lord really presses something on your on your heart you you pay attention right um and he had really put on my heart um the verses uh 23-32 and I'll just I'll read those in particular um because God likes to deal with us each individual differently depending on kind of what sets you off right like what so easily beset you well he's going to work on that to teach you his ways so Psalm uh 107:23 says they that go down to the Sea and ships that do business in Great Waters these see the works of the Lord and his wonders in the Deep for he commandeth and raiseth the stormy wind which lifted up the waves thereof they mount it up to heaven they go down again to the depths their soul is melted because of trouble they reel to and fro and stagger like drunk men and are at their wits end then they cry unto the Lord in their trouble and he bringeth them out of their distresses he maketh the storm a calm so that the waves thereof are still then they are glad because they be quiet so that he bringeth them unto their desired haven oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the Children of Men Let Them exalt him also in the congregation of the people and praise him in the Assembly of Elders I actually pre this this this stuck on my heart so much I actually preached a message last year on it um and just as a little background me and my wife own a business um it's a it's a remodeling construction business um and I have like 13 employees or 12 or 13 employees um and probably about six to nine months before this the economy changed and you know so it was a bit tough um you know and we're kind of just managing um you know kind of month to month month or so and it was getting to where I was managing cash flow on a on on a on a monthly basis you know are you going to make payroll and kind of things like that but like I said the Lord works on you for what kind of sets you off right and my wife will tell you that finances is kind of one of the things in my area is that like I need to get on my knees sometimes uh and you just remember who's who's in control so he had put this scripture on my heart um and really had me uh study it um and there's several things I want to bring out that that hopefully the Lord will would um bless you with um because the end of the psalm on Psalm 43 it says whoever is wise will observe these things even they shall un they shall understand the loving kindness of the Lord amen um so the thing the the three things in this scripture in this uh chapter that the Lord was really bringing out to me and and asking me to pay attention to was the beginning where he says oh give thanks unto the Lord for he is good for his mercy endureth forever let the redeemed of the Lord say so amen right so am I redeemed do I know that I am redeemed amen so then I need to say so amen and then you know it talks about the men that do business and go on uh to do uh business on the waters and how the waves are tumultous and they fear within themselves right but it says oh that I wish that men would praise the Lord so the Lord was really telling me praise me no matter what happens what you go through you need to praise me amen and that's that line oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the children men has an explanation point on and it's repeated four times in the chapter amen so that's something that you should pay attention to amen amen so I started testifying right away um I I had uh I have a a business advisor that was helping me through these times and just kind of managing things and um I'm thankful to the Lord that he a Christian so I had told him about this scripture and I said the lord gave me the scripture now the Lord doesn't tell you how long right he he'll reveal something to you that's going to happen and take place but he doesn't sometimes doesn't tell you how long and I had been kind of going through this time for about six to nine months already so I'm thinking the Lord's giving me the scripture because we're at an end soon but not so but anyway I I took heed to the scripture to praise the Lord so I started testifying I told my business advisor the lord gave me this scripture so we're going to press on we're going to press forward and I'm going to give thanks unto the Lord and he's going to see me through I don't know how it doesn't tell me how and but it says that he will calm the storm and then he will lead me to the desired Port so I'm going to start telling everybody about it amen so what the Lord was really trying to show me and again I'm going to testify personal experiences so may help you on your journey right um is not to look at the glass half empty right we all know Romans 7 and Romans 8 right Romans 7 says I find a law then a law that when I would do good evil is always present we know the devil's always trying to fight us for I Delight in the law of God after the inward man but when I see another law of my members Waring against the law of my mind and bringing me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members oh Wretched Man am I what am I doing I'm looking at myself right Romans 8 though is everything that God does for us right and those are the things that we should be looking at so he wants us to look at Romans 8 amen amen right that's a glass half full and and that's also someone that can fill it to overflowing amen so like moving from the outer Court being governed by the heavens and the the the weather outside going into the hes of holies right Romans 81 there's therefore no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus who walk not after the flesh but after the spirit for as many as are led by the spirit of God they are the sons of God for we have not received the spirit of ab bondage again to fear right like don't be afraid that's Jesus always said that whenever he met anybody he said don't be afraid right so God's telling me don't be like the men in this Psalm where they feared for the waves that were going to drown them but do not be afraid be led by the spirit of God amen amen uh but we have received the spirit of adoption where we cry ABA father why what does it what does it say in verse 18 for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us right so we all know that we have to go through trials and temptations and struggles right but not to look at that because the sufferings won't compare to what's going to be revealed in us right amen right because it says on that last verse in Psalms 107 I'm sorry I'm jumping around so much on you um whosoever is wise and will observe these things even they shall understand the loving kindness of the Lord right because he's going to bring me out of the distress he's going to bring us out of the storms amen so he's asking for me to surrender my path to him right as a business owner is someone that's used to being in control right but as a Christian I'm I'm not the one in control right I need to surrender my ways to him and be led by him right that's no matter what the path may be or how long the path may be right like we're always in a hurry to solve it to get it resolved to get it fixed but sometimes there's a lesson in the journey itself amen and in the message all the days of our lives he says when we receive Christ it isn't just for a few hours or or just for the time of the Revival but it's to last all the days of our life he says am I ready to surrender all my life to him that's the only way that he will accept you is when you give all your life a man is prone to have his own way man wants to do things um he wants to do it his own way he showed that the first few hours after the fall in the Garden of Eden he wanted to do his own way right he's talking about when when Adam went and found fig leaves to create his own religion yes amen he wanted to do it own way because man is always uh satisfied as long as he's doing it his own way and then he gives an analogy where he says did you ever notice when you're driving with somebody else there's just all kinds of mistakes that they make come on pre you push the floorboard out of the other other side almost trying to stop the car yourself and and in your mind you say well why did he do it that way I mean why why did he turn this way why did he do it own to see that's just the nature of man he wants it his own way right and God did not make man to desire his own way he made man to depend on him Amen to forsake his ways to crucify his way he likened us unto Sheep amen when we become Christians we totally surrender every bit of our mental powers to God and follow after his leading and as long as we try to go after our own feeling then we are using the Fallen state of the being amen and if a man will just come uh that close to God when when you're lost um don't try to find your way back right that's usually what we we trying to figure it out don't try to find your way back just surrender to him and he will lead you back don't try to figure it out that's the mental Powers amen and that's so many M that's so many times we as Christians make the mistake of trying to use our natural senses whether it be our five senses or our our human Spirit five senses to to interpret the word like I've used the analogy before it's like this is the word and then I'm I'm trying to look at my five senses so let's if I'm sick right I'm I'm looking at my symptoms to see if this is true or I'm using my imagination and my reasoning power to try and figure out when the trial is going to be over by what he said right and then so many people get frustrated and walk away from the word because they're trying to look at it this way but we're supposed to look at it this way right amen right so right it says Adam staggered not through unbelief but giving praise to God not the promise because he wasn't looking this way at the word he was looking this way at the word waiting for this to come into subjection to the Bible amen praise God Amen thank you Lord amen so um in the Garden of Eden uh God and the devil chose their part of the man the devil took his head and God took his heart amen faith is the substance of things hoped for the evidence of Things Not Seen he just believes it because God said it he don't have to see nothing or no sense of his body has to declare it he just believes it in his soul where God lives God wants to lead him to the path of worship that really struck struck me there right says oh that I wish that men would praise the Lord for his goodness right he wants us to worship Him amen and depend fully on him if God depended holy and uh holy and complete surrender to be led by his Spirit at the beginning then that's the way it it will have to be forever amen Cain wanted to be religious uh he brought it before God with something like this here's the best that I've got this is all I can do about it now take it or leave it right good now that's the best that I can do um I believe that a Christian Life is continual sacrifice yes he that will come after me let him deny himself daily every day not 46 days but every day how the Christian loves to do it he doesn't do it with a grudge he does it uh with a feeling that he loves God it's a joy to serve the Lord It's a joy to sacrifice it's a joy to Worship the Lord amen hallelujah praise God good amen so in Psalms 107 says let the redeemed of the Lord say so right we all know what redeemed means by back right that I've been bought with a price right that my price has been paid and I've never did it in the first place amen so it says let the redeemed say so so if I know that I've been bought back and now it's not I'm not looking at my righteousness I'm looking at the righteousness of Christ right he died that I may take on his righteousness amen praise God right it says whosoever is wise and will observe these things so wise uh in in the Hebrew is HEM um it means to be wise or skilled um where like when when and that's where old philosophy is different from new pH philosophy right like when the Greeks talk about wisdom it's usually intellectual theoretical abstract right right where wisdom when it's uh coming from the Hebrew uh was a skill in practical iCal matters amen that's subject to Divine causes so therefore hebrewism so when saying so whoever is wise um was um not theoretical and speculative but it was practical based on revealed principles uh of right or wrong to be lived out in daily life amen amen amen and then uh loving kind right so this is again from that same uh verse whoever is wise and will observe these things even they shall understand the loving kindness of the Lord so loving kindness I when I dove into that it really blessed me so I just wanted to share that with you the the Hebrew word used there in the Old Testament for loving kindness is H said it said it's not merely an emotion or feeling but involves action on behalf of someone who is in need amen the core idea of this term communic Ates loyalty or faithfulness within a relationship so thank you for your special when I heard you practicing was like oh this is going to be right here in the message God's faithfulness uh within a relationship it is the inclination of the heart to show Amazing Grace to the one who is loved when it comes to life and actions God's has said manifested in forgiveness makes a relationship with him possible amen so we understand so he's saying whoever is WI and will observe these things is going to understand the amazing grace of God so how like I I read it in the Bible right and it's real but he wants to make it even more real to us right so he's going to allow things in our lives and things to us to go through so that he can demonstrate to us personally his loving kindness His Amazing Grace To Us amen praise God right so what the Lord was telling me through the the psalm was I need to know that I'm redeemed right by his Amazing Grace there's no condemnation to them that are in Christ Jesus right so I'm not getting confused or concerned by the trial that I'm going through right because I have no cond condemnation because I'm walking after the spirit amen and I know that the suffering of this world is not worthy to be compared to his glory right so it doesn't matter what I'm going to go through if he told me he's going to be with me that's all I need amen um and I'm not looking at the trial half full I'm looking I mean half empty I'm looking at it full half full on you know where God can resolve it for me so it's not my way I need to surrender my way and I need to praise Him amen and it's not whistling through the graveyard kind of Praise right it's true praise with faith right faith is is the heart of the matter faith is not abstract right it's a substance right he says faith is the substance of things hoped for right and as I was saying like Hebrew is an action-based language so the word many times used in the Old Testament for faith is imuna um and it's based upon uh the the word that it's based upon is amen um it is something that can be affirmed in reality and not arbitrary and baseless so we don't believe blindly right there's a there's a basis for the faith that we have amen so it's imuna is defined as stable done in a trustworthy Manner and then there's other words that are derived from it as well imim which is loyal one who is trustworthy Omen which is experience Amana which is agreement or loyalty so all these words represent the concept of something that can be trusted duee to the fact that someone has done Deeds that prove that they are trustworthy and will be loyal to their actions and promises that sounds like he's the same yesterday today and forever amen praise God so faith is trust due to proven actions which affirm the trust the truth of the trust right so here like I don't look at this as fairy tale as brother Paul was saying this morning to me this is this is fact right right everything in here is true even more real than me right so when I look at this as being fact I can trust what what it says I can see uh what happened in the past and how he behaved how God delivered his people saved his people right so my faith starts there right it says faith cometh by hearing right but then he also wants to do this personally in your own life right right so to build upon it so then now that you it's you're not saying it because it's written here you're not saying it because you were raised that way or that your parents said or you heard somebody else say sure it starts there but then he wants to make it personal to you amen praise God right when um well Paul had mentioned this earlier right the Israelites after the Red Sea three days later they started complaining right right and it's it's not that they didn't believe God they they did believe God their problem was they didn't trust him right so like it say because it says the devil beles right so it's not belief only it's also faith and and Trust uh in in God Amen imuna also translates as faithfulness right it reveals a life full of Reliance upon Him amen uh so faith that results in faithfulness implying action right so that's James uh where he talks about faith is work Works Express right so right because because I have faith Faith then I'm going to do things I'm going to put it into action amen praise God um amen so he says realizing something very profound here it's like when we say Amen at the end of a prayer it's not just a closing statement or a ritual word it is an agreement to act upon what was prayed right so after we pray something and we say Amen you know brother Brandon said it many times so be it right so we're we're we're in agreement that what we say is going to happen amen and God is inviting us into partnership that's what faith is is he's inviting us into a personal relationship into partnership with him amen praise God praise God so the times when he knows and allows us to walk into circumstances that turn out to be challenging or even wretched this is God allowing us to participate in faith amen to make it personal to us amen right in his Sovereign wisdom God gives us these storms for our advantage and sanctification so that our faith might be perfected amen amen it's in terms of building layers of trust to the foundation of faith that I have in Christ right it's like David right he God gave him the experience like so I'm sure David was taught from a youth about God right from his parents and his fathers they told the stories they heard it from the rabbis right and then he put it into action when he was a a Shepherd right God gave him the experience with the bear and with the lion so that when he came to Goliath he already had personal experiences that was going to build layers of trust in God Amen praise God hallelujah so God wants to see our faith in action amen so this is what God was saying to me was he was asking me to cry unto him to even though I'm going to go through great storm great trial and I need to know that he's going to bring me to a desired Haven and I need to praise Him amen not whistling through the graveyard praise him but true worship and true Thanksgiving knowing that he's the one that's going to resolve it right amen we know many times brother Brandon says and he says here in Works Faith Works is Faith Express faith is a revelation from God now Faith is a revelation he's revealed it to you by his grace it's nothing you did you didn't work yourself up into Faith you ever have faith it's given to you by the grace of God God reveals it to you therefore faith is a revelation right so when when when I got saved he revealed to me his grace and Redemption right so when now I wanted to have my life transformed and follow after him amen so that was a gift that he gave me to see his great plan and know that I was a filthy wretch amen so it's a gift from God and if you ever really want to know if you have a revelation it's something that is completely obvious to you but it's not necessarily obvious to everybody else like when I read when I read the word of God and then I re read the revealed word of God from Malachi 4 it is so obvious to me right that it's revealing this right and it's revealing the word of God like there's no way you could even possibly me out of it it's not even an option because they line up so perfectly well that's a gift that was given to me by God to see his word amen praise God Amen he says now I can't make you believe neither can you make yourself believe God has got to give it to you it's a gift of God to believe not your faith God's faith your intellectual Faith might believe is fine but unless the faith of God is down in your heart see you your intellectual faith can accept it um but you just keep believing until God reveals it to you that's when it's anchored beyond anything nothing will move you from it that's when you know it's been revealed from Christ himself amen hallelujah and it's a gift from God Amen what is faith faith is something that's revealed to you that is not yet but you believe it will be faith is a revelation of the will of God I love that uh statement from brother Brandon that was from anointed ones at the end times says faith is a revelation of the will of God right so God was giving me Grace when I when he pressed upon my heart Psalms 107 right he's telling me his wills for me to go through trial right so he's saying don't don't get condemned by it you didn't do anything wrong I'm the one that's going to bring you through it praise me and cry out to me through it amen prise God so he was increasing my faith by showing me his will amen now I love this too this from thy house now Faith is a law of God all this power of God that we're talking about is accessible To Us by faith all things are possible say to this mountain be moved and don't doubt in your heart believe what you you said come to pass you can have it accessible you've got the law there it is the law is faith that controls all things amen amen perfect faith is a master of all circumstances no matter what it is it Masters it when you believe anything do anything and you've got faith in what you're doing no matter what the circumstances just don't ask any questions I didn't say that amen this is from perfect Faith just don't ask any questions meaning don't question God like if he revealed something to you and that's going to take place right so then then I can have perfect faith I can have perfect trust in God that he's going to work it out no matter what I'm going to go through right amen cuz that's where the the Mind wants to go right the Mind wants to go it's just it's natural I'm a planner so just it's what my mind does I'm always looking at six steps ahead of me right it's just the way my mind wants to go so obviously God wants to train me on his will right so he's going to work on me on those things so that I'm not always trying to think six steps ahead amen praise God Amen uh just don't ask any questions it's already over so the trial was already over when he revealed to me last year and I'm going to get into testifying what's happened throughout this past year but um so it was already over then amen so it's already over just keep going it Masters all circumstan Faith believes that God will work it out right so that's why I went to testifying right away I I told my business advisor I told my bookkeeper and I told Paul I I was telling anybody that anything that came up with that type of situation well how's it going I'm like well that's testify of Psalms 107 it's rough but God's going to get me through it amen praise God faith believes that God will work it out I don't know how he's going to do it and that was one of the phrases I used I don't know how he's going to do it but he's going going to do it amen he'll do it anyhow see it Masters all circumstances amen then we we have the privilege to enforce upon Satan the claims that God gives us for God has a law and his law and his word is a law amen we have a right to force these claims upon Satan and say give it back and he has to do it because we can take God's agent the holy spirit and go right down on our knees and say it's thus sayith the Lord he's got to give it up that's all cu the holy spirit is there to make him do it amen amen the church has given the rightful legal rights by the Bible to take the Holy Spirit and force this upon Him amen now he is now beginning to feel religious now we have a law the law uh uh the law of life in us we don't only thing we have to do you are made and born and placed here in the body Body of Christ as Sons and Daughters of God you don't have to knock down to the devil the only thing you know you have to do is know how to let go and let God Amen and he's just asking us to surrender amen that's what he was asking me to surrender the situation to him if I reveal to you that I'm going to bring something to pass then you can just rest assured right he's going to keep those in perfect peace amen praise God amen just let go and let God that's all and the same way it is with us it isn't what we fight and Pull and hurry that's one of the biggest things that we always do is we try to hurry it up amen oh I don't uh it says if I don't get this if I don't get that that's not it is to know that the law of life is in you and you just let go and let God Amen then he takes you to your healing he takes you to the baptism of the spirit or anything that he's promised by letting go and letting God amen glory praise God so just in summary I just pulling things out of what brother brandom said there on faith so faith is the complete trust and confidence in God right as simple it is like I if I have complete trust and confidence in him I completely turn it over to him and that's nothing that I'm thinking up in myself it's given to me by Revelation right it's a gift from God making making known to me his Divine will right it's nothing that I can work up or work hard for right it's a gift it's given by the grace of God showing me his Divine will not just in word right but given me by experience so that it grows within my heart amen giving me evidence that is not imagined but tangible in substance which gives me the authority by Jehovah to claim it amen not depending on my knowledge to figure out how it will come to pass but it gives me full Assurance in God Amen which gives me rest peace and a calm heart on the finished work of God Amen so that's what God showed me last May that I needed to do in this situation so I started testifying like I said to my business advisor to my bookkeeper um as and again I thought I was going to be coming out of this trial and that it was already like in the midst of the storm little did I know that it was going to get much waver the waves were going to get a lot higher um but again like I used the opportunity to praise God and then um I had told my mom too my mom's a Believer um I had told my mom the previous may as well and she's the one who started the company so we we we share a lot um so I had told my mom about Psalms 107 she goes oh I've been meaning to give you something so so my grandmother uh who who has passed away when she first moved to PA I had bought her a picture for her house and I had completely forgotten about it she and she said Nana I wanted you to have it back um after she passed away and I have it in in in my house and I want to give this she told me to give it to you and says you telling me about your experience with God in Psalms 107 and how he's going to um uh bring you through so um the picture that I had given her was of a sunset on on the ocean and the script there was a scripture on the on the um the painting itself and the scripture was from Psalms 107 um and it said that he maketh the storm a calm so that the waves thereof are still so it's exactly from the scripture a right so it's a witness from God like he he does little things to show you his will and his way so so he's confirming his word to be like Yep this is what's going to happen and don't fret amen praise God amen amen let me get back to where I was um so I had told my mother and she had given me that picture I have that picture hanging up in my house now in my study um so I was telling anytime I come up against a tough time in relation to the business I would I would tell people about the scripture and how God was going to get us through and again we were kind of managing you know you know through uh cash flow and you know just kind of week to week like are you going to be able to pay the payroll this week and and so forth but you know God was coming through and then uh September the very beginning of September um I got a call from my mom um telling me that so I I have three sisters uh my older sister is a year older than I am and she's handicapped she has William syndrome um and she was having stomach trouble they took her to the doctor um and then she called me from the hospital saying that they transfering her to Hershey Medical uh they found a mass in her stomach it's like a 8 inch Mass uh and it turned out to be um ovarian cancer um and they had to do an operation that week um to try try and uh take it out of her uh so they gave her a full hysterctomy and and did the surgery so talk to Mom again about Psalms 107 says he tells us to praise him and that he's going to bring us through the storm so we prayed and I I went in and I prayed for my sister and I told prayed that the Lord would be with the surgery and guide the doctors and and that um know God would heal her of the cancer and that God would heal her of William syndrome because neither one of them is is insurmountable to him amen um so he had brought her through that surgery um and um the the doctors wanted her to go for a severe chemo treatment shortly after that um and she had just and my like I said my sister's handicapped so she has probably like a sixth grade level um Ed education so uh so she could be a bit emotional um she had just seen my aunt go through cancer and and pass away from it um and seen her go through chemo she's like I don't want anything to do do with that and we kind of agreed that oh that would be really really tough for her and it' just be a horrible quality of life so she she made the decision my older sister and she has great faith she's my my sister's a wonderful Christian um and she's nope God's going to heal me um so she made the decision not to go through through chemo so they kind of just help helped her through that surgery so that was like in in September and of course on on going and I'll get to more about that testimony then in on um November the beginning so that was September beginning of October the waves got higher my my dad um he's battled with hepatitis C for a long time and it killed his liver um so he was on the list for liver transplant so we got a phone call um the beginning of of October oh somebody died in a car accident uh come in get a liver transplant so we I took him to the hospital that night he had a li liver transplant two days later and then now we're on that recovery so now my mom's dealing with my sister's recovery and my dad's recovery um so that was that was September that was October and then in November um we just had Thanksgiving dinner um and that uh that weekend uh my SI my I have a my middle sister she's nine years younger than me she's married um not currently Believers um they were on vacation and her husband started having issues with his stomach so they took him to the hospital they said oh you got to we got to get you back so they were in Florida and they had to get him back up to uh Baltimore and they said like you you need to go to the hospital right away just get off the plane and go to the emergency room um so I I I drove down to meet them in Baltimore um and he got diagnosed with um leukemia uh leukemia and they said if we don't start a treatment you're going to be dead in two weeks um and we were estranged from them um at the time uh there was just some family family issues so this um I I said well my my sister's my family I love her um you know regardless of of how he feels or how they feel I'm going to go down there and show them the love of God um and you're just trying to follow the leading with the spirit right you're really trying to see like okay what does he want me to say what does he want me to do how do we bridge this Gap right um and so I went down there and just showed them Christlike love we didn't talk about Christ there was no opening to to do that um at that time um but I I showed them love family love and just the love of God um and then I had come home and they had to go through immediately like severe chemo treatment um you know to where he was going to get blasted with chemo for like seven straight days at 30 times the dose the only way he was going to be able to survive um and then so he was going through that in the middle of that um him and my my wife um you know he he doesn't mind talking to my wife because she's an outsider for the the riddle family um and and she she goes through her own battles from from a from a health standpoint you know my my wife has Ms and we're believing for her healing and we just know it's just a matter of uh when not if right because it's it's a promise of God um so he had reached out to her and she's like how do you how do you deal with impending how do you deal with going through this um but uh that opened up the door for her to testify of how she goes through it it's through the grace of God it's through Christ so she was able to lead him to the Lord you know so all God works all things for his glory amen praise God Amen so that was my family kind of going through bun and and I'm I know all I praise God just call out to him and and make sure I worship and and keep quoting Psalms 107 that he's going to get us through amen and in the meantime through September through December I can't even focus on work right I'm just relying on my people to to to get us through and I can't focus on trying to write the ship so I'm just okay God's got at the helm right I'm he told me he would take care of it so I'm I'm I'm G to because right now I'm like sometimes he'll put stuff in your life that you have to make a choice on what gets sacrificed right like you can't do all things right and you have to turn over and rely stuff on him and do what you need to do um so I was just relying on God to get us to get us through that um and things got kind of dicey at the end of the year obviously in construction stuff slows down at Thanksgiving Christmas nobody wants their house worked on during the holidays so it's even getting even uh a little bit um the waves getting a little bit higher right um but I kept testifying and and like I said testifying to my bookkeeper and one of the comment she made to me was like I don't know how I'm going to pay the bills this week and then all of a sudden you get a check God's always on time my dad my dad told me that he's never early he's never late though he's always on time so by God's grace uh we were able to still maintain and stay afloat through that through that storm um and again like the waves were were super high and um I was thinking well maybe this is it um and God always does stuff that's out of the ordinary so we were working with a customer um usually we are doing full models um they started as a design only um because of a relationship with my sister who's a designer so like sure we'll do design only there's no there's no funds in design only so like but I felt the leading to do it so we were doing it um and then that turns out to be the largest cabinet deal that we've ever made in in our lives the largest cabinet deal for the C for the uh cabinet company that we work with um and I'm thinking well is this it is we we're going to go through the desired port at this point all it did was bring us current right it didn't it didn't even get me I'm like okay I guess the storm's not over this again and this was in January um and again just keep praying and keep every day testifying like I said we're I'm in a a business men's group and it's a it's christian-based um so we meet once a month and you always give an update of how you're doing so keep testifying Psalms 107 um that God's going to bring us through um and then stuff start started to to look a little bit better and a little bit better um and I was like okay is is this it so uh we we had signed a bunch of deals to kind of get us back up to a good level and I was it's review time at work right you got to do peer reviews and such um and planning for the next year and I hadn't been I wasn't able to do bonuses or uh raises for the past two years just because of how crazy it was and um so we were just deing to do it this year and it was just starting to look good and I I put together um a presentation um and God always like I said he'll show you when it's time like you know like when things start and he'll show you when it's going to end so you know I'm praying is is this is this the it Lord or you know we you have you brought me through and I like I said I prepared the presentation for the employees and it was the day of the presentation and I'm just praying in the morning um about it and I'm going through uh reading the Bible in a year um and I'm doing it on on a app that that does it chronologically I've never done it that way right so it's not in order of how you see here it's going to do it based upon when things are happening chronologically so I have no idea what scripture is going to be next um and then that morning Psalms when was happening amen so I praise God um he that he has taken us through amen so Isaiah 26 says Thou will keep him in perfect peace whose mind is stayed on thee because he trusteth in thee trust ye in the Lord forever for the Lord Jehovah is Everlasting strength and I dove into the scripture a little bit deeper um and to where I can really uh look at the con context because it says Jehovah will keep us in perfect peace it's not nothing that I'm doing it's something that he's going to do for us amen and the word for keep in the scripture is toore uh which is uh in its semetic root is the idea of guarding over or watching over so it's not so much that he's giving you he's not giving us perfect peace because he is perfect peace he's keeping us in perfect peace amen so he's watching over us in perfect peace amen right and it's like um this is the way it is with God is we Face a frightening situation or crisis we are fearful worried and we go to God and he says hey I'm in control it's okay and then you know what it's suddenly okay right so it's like Psalms 107 God giving me that you're going to go through this but I'm going to take you through well then then you can rest in perfect peace amen he says I will keep uh he will keep us in perfect peace and there's no word in Hebrew for perfect um and we all know the word for peace is Shalom so it's shalom twice so it's shalom shalom right like so whenever something said twice in the Bible it means pay attention right so it is simply the word Shalom repeated two times right so he's going to keep us in shalom shalom amen um he says but the it's the best peace God himself is at perfect peace or he is he is peace now the word Shalom has wide range in meetings it's not doesn't only mean rest it also means healing it means safety it means security amen he says but we must keep in mind that he is perfect peace the way we gain access to this piece is by having our minds stayed on him amen amen now the word mind in Hebrew uh that is used here is yees R yes sir um this is a sort um a play on the word keep um but it's it's spelled well just jump past that um it's a represents a humble submission to the Holy Spirit the word yeser comes from the semetic root used for imagination amen so uh hence God will guard over our imaginations with perfect peace amen because where does much of our Stress and Anxiety come from right it's our own imaginations and thinking right like fear comes from what we think will happen right amen but if he's going to guard over our imaginations with perfect peace so God will keep in perfect peace our imaginations are stayed on him now the word stayed is Sak which is like a mattress covering it is an overlay so when our imaginations cover god um his peace will become our peace his imaginations will become our imaginations right Philippians 2:5 says let the mind be in you which also was in Christ amen praise God says yet this verse is not saying that God will give us perfect peace it is saying that he will keep guard or watch over us in perfect peace it is saying that his that he is perfect peace and he will guard or watch over this perfect peace that we receive when we take our imaginations and overlay them with his we get this perfect peace when we let our imaginations become one with God's imaginations what scripture does that sound like sounds like Philippians 4 right so Paul was referring to Isaiah 26 when he talked about Philippians 4 so let's read Philippians 4 four says rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice let your moderation be known unto all men the Lord is at hand be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with Thanksgiving right oh that I wish that men would praise the Lord with Thanksgiving let your requests be known unto God and and the peace of God Amen which pass all understanding shall keep your hearts and mind Minds through Christ Jesus why finally Brethren whatsoever things are true so this now we're talking about our imaginations right whichever things are true whichever things are honest whichever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are a good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things whose mind is stayed on thee right those things which have you both learned and received and heard and see in me do and the God of Peace shall be with you amen so that does tales with Isaiah 26 amen says but I rejoice in the Lord greatly that now at the last you your care of me hath flourished again wherein ye were also careful but ye lacked opportunity here this is what I wanted to get to not that I speak in respect of want right so what happens when we're in perfect peace with God when we let go and let God um I know I speak in respect of want for I have learned and whatsoever State I am um therefore to be content right because I've surrendered it to God so even though I'm going to go through this great storm or if you're in prison or if you're bound in in in sickness right if God has revealed to you that he's all you have to do is cry out to him and worship him and he's going to deliver deliver you then I know that I have learned in whatsoever State I am therefore to be content I know no I I know both how to be abased and I know how to abound everywhere and in all things I am instructed both to be full and to be hungry both to abound and to suffer need I can do all things through Christ Jesus which strengths strengthens me amen praise God thank you Jesus thank you Lord all right praise God I'm going to I'm going to wind it down here I didn't want to be long tonight um I'm going to go to um this is from unfailing realities of the Living God God wants you to surrender God wants a complete surrender when you surrender everything then you will find out what I'm talking about is the truth I've often thought what why how we've deprived ourselves how we've robbed God of his plan by not surrendering Our Lives completely to him everything that we have to him how that we have um disallowed his program we've lingered and have made him to wait and wait and wait trying to find somebody that he could work through trying to find a man somewhere that he could put confidence in some man that would surrender everything amen so this is saying if we do what Psalms 107 says Where We Praise Him and we cry out to him whatever situation that we're in and then we surrender it we trust it to him this is what will happen says like we should come in a sane sensible way to God saying Father Here I Am I don't care I'm going to follow the scripture the blueprint I don't care what anybody else says I stay with it I really mean it I don't care what it costs me Lord I'm nothing to begin with but I want you to lead me and let the holy spirit that wrote this Bible and made these promises confirm it back through my life I feel that you're leading me that way he says stay on the highway stay on the road map go the way the disciples went go the word uh go the word they preached live it amen testify it I know it to be the truth God has to find somebody that he can trust somebody that he can uh have confidence in and can have confidence in God that can believe him you believe that don't you sure God has to find somebody who can put his confidence in and then when he finds such a man he can put his confidence and his power in a man that will follow the road that will stay right on the map see go right on until he comes to the place of power faith will lead him to that because he's got faith in the word it will lead him to the promise and then the promise will lead him to power amen that's the way God wants us to know his word we know it we've traveled it and we've tested it we've tried it and you know where it leads now his road map is the Bible the Bible is the road that leads to the power of God faith leads you to the power power produces the promise and he says we need the power but the holy spirit will bring you back to Pentecost every time amen glory it'll bring you to that reality it will bring you back to a baptism of the power of the spirit that will lead you and will never take one word off the Bible amen it'll stay right in the Bible where it says this it'll follow right through it the holy spirit will it brings a reality amen so he's asking us to surrender his will so you can come on M musicians can come on up I'm going to close out with this he says let us surrender our will says oh that uh this is sorry this is for me let us surrender our will this ISS oh that men would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his wonderful Works to the children of men amen says we will observe we will observe these things and we will see and understand the loving kindness the amazing grace of God right if we keep our mind on him we'll understand the amazing grace of God because he's going to take us through that trial so that we can have a personal experience of his Amazing Grace amen and so in our lives we will have perfect peace shalom shalom right so you can weather any storm any trial any sickness any prison all we have to do is cry out to him he wants to bring us through and build our faith through a partnership and give uh give to us his perfect peace shalom shalom so I pray that this was a blessing to you that it could help you in your work walk with Christ um because he wants each to give each one of us a personal relationship with him right it's not just myself up here where the Paul know preaching just the word sure you Faith cometh by hearing hearing the word of God but he wants to have a personal relationship with you right every day he wants to take you things so that you can understand His Amazing Grace and you can have that P perfect peace in your life so may the Lord richly bless you this evening amen thank you Jesus Hallelujah praise God wonderful praise God [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Music] hallelujah hallelujah praise God for the word of God tonight amen how many were blessed by the word of God tonight anyone desires prayer
