[38:07] and the church said Amen god bless you
[38:09] being seated praise the Lord by God's
[38:17] grace will kind of pick up where we left
[38:20] off on Wednesday so I have quotes there
[38:31] children if you'd like to switch over
[38:32] here how was the good doctor doing
[38:35] sister Kristen he doing good back on
[38:37] three oh do you have surgery or
[38:39] something okay good well thank the Lord
[38:42] Frey's good gladiators not as not sick
[38:45] with surgery praise Allah we appreciate
[38:49] your sacrifice sister Kristen bring your
[38:50] family and it's always a blessing to see
[38:52] your family and they're always such an
[38:55] encouragement to everybody so praise the
[38:56] Lord so let's look at this thought here
[38:59] today proven all things by the grace of
[39:02] the Lord you know uh you know a lot of
[39:09] these sermons have been really good you
[39:11] know for me to preach too I guess I've
[39:13] always wanted to look at some of these
[39:15] quotes but not really know how to bring
[39:17] it out but I think the Holy Spirit
[39:19] brought the right time and then the
[39:21] right approach to it by the grace of the
[39:23] Lord what I mean is I always want people
[39:26] to to understand that that we believe
[39:29] brother Branham was a prophet but yet we
[39:32] don't worship Him and we we don't exalt
[39:34] him and and we have to treat him like
[39:36] any other prophet take everything they
[39:38] say back to the Word of God you know no
[39:41] prophet is above questioning you know
[39:43] you have to you have to prove all things
[39:46] the Bible says try every spirit and so
[39:49] you know I've waited long and you know
[39:51] just in the back of my mind for a time
[39:53] to preach on these things so works out
[39:55] great and I also appreciate that
[39:58] Natalia's here so that works out good
[40:00] too because she's just new to everything
[40:01] and
[40:02] things were preaching and so I think it
[40:04] works really great that the Holy
[40:06] Spirit's led her to hear these things so
[40:08] I thank the Lord for that and hope it's
[40:10] been a blessing to you
[40:12] so yesterday I recorded the video for
[40:14] brother Billy Paul and Joseph I was
[40:16] editing it this morning it's probably
[40:18] taking you all week to edit it and then
[40:20] Lord willing next weekend upload it and
[40:22] share with them and after that Lord
[40:26] willing I'm just gonna make a video just
[40:27] of the seven doctrines I see that are
[40:30] false
[40:30] coming out of Jeffersonville so I guess
[40:34] I'll share for natália sake you know we
[40:36] believe William Branham was a prophet
[40:38] but we believe his sons have kind of
[40:40] gotten off the word a little bit they
[40:41] say every word their dad said was thus
[40:44] saith the Lord but we don't agree with
[40:45] that we believe every prophet is human
[40:48] every prophet makes a human mistake but
[40:53] to be a real prophet every time they
[40:55] said thus saith the Lord it had to come
[40:58] to pass and that's why we believe
[41:00] William Branham is a genuine prophet now
[41:04] there's a lot of questions about some
[41:06] things he said so we'll be looking more
[41:07] into that in the future
[41:08] Lord willing and and then also you know
[41:12] the there's a gentleman who's trying to
[41:14] get me to debate the guy from believe
[41:16] the sign the gentleman knew so I'm still
[41:19] looking to do that but probably a March
[41:21] or something like that I want to I want
[41:22] to study more on these topics and then
[41:24] feel I could I could be able to go
[41:26] through a debate and just I just want to
[41:29] stand up for the message praise God you
[41:31] know I I just want to stand with you
[41:32] know my brother Graham says you know we
[41:34] live in a day where you know it's not
[41:35] very violent you know our in at least in
[41:37] America and he said we we might not have
[41:39] have to give our lives you know as far
[41:42] as like as a martyr in America we might
[41:44] not have to do that but we want our
[41:46] voice to be recorded in heaven that we
[41:49] spoke the truth and gave people a chance
[41:52] to hear the truth praise God so we want
[41:54] to give our lives in a different way you
[41:57] know
[41:57] perhaps one day we will have to give our
[41:59] lives as martyrs god forbid but we'd
[42:01] have to be willing to do that but until
[42:03] then we should be giving our voices
[42:05] standing up for the truth of the Bible
[42:08] unashamed of the gospel because Jesus
[42:11] said if you're ashamed of me and my word
[42:12] he said I'll be ashamed of you in the
[42:15] of the Holy Angels so we don't want to
[42:17] be ashamed of the Word of God
[42:18] praise the Lord and so we will begin
[42:21] there and then you know looking at these
[42:23] scriptures here I think I've kind of
[42:28] thoroughly gone through that you know
[42:30] over the last you know thirteen years of
[42:32] our church I've showed many biblical
[42:35] proofs so why William Branham is a
[42:37] prophet but I just want to review him
[42:38] real quick
[42:39] brother Branham is the only person I
[42:41] know the only person I know other than
[42:44] maybe some he's I should say he's only
[42:46] solid person I know that's ever spoken
[42:49] with thus saith the Lord I know Benny
[42:51] Hinn has done it I know a Kim Clemente
[42:53] has done it but very few others do I
[42:56] know that ever spoke with thus saith the
[42:57] Lord now Benny Hinn said in the name of
[43:00] Lord he said God was going to destroy
[43:01] all the homosexuals in the 1990s well we
[43:04] know that didn't happen so we know of
[43:06] course his lifestyle - the prosperity
[43:08] gospel and the way they live their lives
[43:10] we know he's not a genuine prophet now
[43:12] the Kim Clemente I haven't even studied
[43:14] anything he said but the man's got real
[43:18] long hair and we know a man's supposed
[43:19] to cut his hair so you know Lord willing
[43:23] if you want me to I'll study some of his
[43:25] things out but he kind of does like rock
[43:27] and roll music until he feels like he's
[43:29] real emotional then they'll start
[43:30] prophesying and we know God's not in
[43:31] rock and roll so I just haven't devoted
[43:33] any time to studying his words but I you
[43:37] know I may but the only one I know you
[43:40] know and we can throw names now like
[43:41] Benny Hinn I'm sorry Billy Graham TD
[43:45] jakes you know Jack Co you can throw in
[43:48] any name you want of any famous preacher
[43:50] Joel Osteen you can throw off none of
[43:52] them I know
[43:53] ever spoke with the authority of thus
[43:55] saith the Lord except brother Branham
[43:57] and so we take what he said and then we
[44:01] have to take it to the word as we said
[44:04] we prove all things and even such a
[44:07] small thing as this if I can just share
[44:09] this real quick last year I did about
[44:12] 134 days I think on Facebook just
[44:15] proving how the Trinity was wrong and
[44:17] everything and and showing how we should
[44:20] be modestly dressed and I took a break
[44:22] because I just was tired of it and I
[44:24] wanted to devote my time you know to
[44:25] writing the next book
[44:26] but brother branham said thus saith the
[44:28] lord trinitarianism is of the devil now
[44:30] the Trinity doctrine says that there's
[44:33] three persons in God and they're all
[44:35] equal but just to share you know I just
[44:38] have this scripture on my heart you know
[44:39] Isaiah 40 25 says to whom then will you
[44:42] liken me or shall I be equal sayeth the
[44:46] Holy One like there plainly plainly the
[44:50] god of the Old Testament is saying I
[44:51] don't have any holy equal ones you know
[44:55] and then the word Trinity and God the
[44:57] definition God in three persons it's not
[44:59] even in the scripture so you know when
[45:02] brother I would make a statement like
[45:04] that we've got to take it back to the
[45:05] Word of God and we see it's right God
[45:08] never says I'm two persons ah he's never
[45:11] says I'm three persons so even in a
[45:13] statement like that we've got to take it
[45:15] back to the word now even with baptism
[45:19] brother BAM said the Father Son Holy
[45:20] Ghost
[45:21] tidal baptism is is wrong and he said
[45:25] that's thus saith the Lord now we got to
[45:28] understand that 10 days after Jesus said
[45:30] that Peter said repent and be baptized
[45:34] in the name of Jesus Christ for the
[45:37] remission of sins so we know Jesus in
[45:40] Matthew 28:19 was speaking in a parable
[45:43] form or we could say he was speaking in
[45:45] mystery because the Bible said that the
[45:47] Messiah would come and utter mysteries
[45:50] the Bible actually says that in the Old
[45:52] Testament and so 10 days after Jesus has
[45:56] baptized in the name of the Father Son
[45:57] Holy Ghost
[45:58] Peter full of the Holy Ghost with the
[46:00] keys of the kingdom opens the kingdom to
[46:03] the Jews through the baptism in the name
[46:05] of the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[46:07] not long after that Peter opens the door
[46:09] to the Samaritans in acts 8 I'm sorry
[46:15] corny OSes house rather in acts 8 and he
[46:18] baptizes them they get baptized in the
[46:20] name of the Lord I'm sorry it is acts 8
[46:24] yeah I'm sorry I think he gets X 8 16
[46:26] yeah for as yet he was fallen upon none
[46:29] of them only they were baptized in the
[46:31] name of the Lord Jesus and then in acts
[46:34] 10 I believe it's 48 Peter tells them to
[46:38] be baptized and the Bible just records
[46:39] it as
[46:40] be baptized in the name of the Lord and
[46:42] so Jesus Christ Lord Jesus Lord and then
[46:47] there's one more in the book of Acts 19
[46:50] verse 5 this just kind of came to my
[46:52] heart just to show to two simple
[46:54] examples
[46:56] Paul baptized when he saw the the
[46:59] believers in in Ephesus he baptized them
[47:03] in the name of the Lord Jesus praise God
[47:06] so when brother man would make a
[47:08] statement like that we've got to go back
[47:09] to the word and we find that it's right
[47:12] we find no one was ever baptized saying
[47:14] titles father son or Holy Ghost and so
[47:18] we can see that that scripture is right
[47:20] and here this is important too because
[47:22] Paul says he baptized in the name of the
[47:25] Lord Jesus and then if you know a
[47:28] Galatians chapter 1 Jesus Christ was the
[47:32] one who taught Paul his gospel because
[47:35] he said the gospel which a preach know
[47:37] of me is not after man he said neither I
[47:40] received it he said of man neither was I
[47:45] taught it but by the revelation of Jesus
[47:47] Christ amen hallelujah praise the Lord
[47:53] and I think he tells us yeah where he
[48:02] tells us that that he went up to Arabia
[48:04] and that's where Jesus met him to give
[48:07] him the revelation he said neither when
[48:09] I upped I Jerusalem to them which were
[48:10] apostles before me but I went into
[48:12] Arabia and returned again unto Damascus
[48:16] and so that's where the Lord Jesus met
[48:18] him praise God
[48:20] all right now that I think those are
[48:24] those are review for most of us I just
[48:26] want to say that when brother Brad makes
[48:27] a statement like that we've got to take
[48:30] it back to the word and church every
[48:31] time I've done that I found it to be
[48:33] right praise God now he also revealed
[48:36] many mysteries there's 12 New Testament
[48:38] mysteries I've mentioned those a lot
[48:40] lately in the last few years and each
[48:43] one God has revealed to us through the
[48:46] ministry of brother Branham such as the
[48:48] rapture such as Mystery Babylon such as
[48:51] the mystery of the New Testament church
[48:52] as the bride
[48:54] there's all mystery of godliness the
[48:56] mystery of iniquity all these mysteries
[48:59] have been revealed to us through Bell
[49:01] Rams ministry which other men didn't
[49:03] preach
[49:03] Clarence Larkin didn't preach it your
[49:05] eyes Smith didn't preach it Joseph Smith
[49:07] didn't preach these things these were
[49:09] all revealed in our day praise God
[49:11] and then there was other truths that
[49:13] were not called mysteries that were just
[49:15] restored like marriage and divorce
[49:17] marriage and divorce was not called a
[49:18] mystery in the Bible what was what
[49:20] happened though is that the revelation
[49:22] got lost
[49:23] praise God but then it had to be
[49:25] restored and remember Jesus said all
[49:28] things will be restored in acts 3 verse
[49:30] 21 maybe this will help all of us here
[49:35] acts 3:21 the Bible says actually acts
[49:42] verse 3 RX 3 verse 20 rather and he
[49:45] shall send Jesus Christ which before was
[49:47] preached unto you whom the heaven must
[49:49] receive until the times of restitution
[49:53] of all things which God has spoken by
[49:57] the mouth of all his holy prophets since
[50:00] the world began
[50:01] so in acts 3 21 the Bible says Jesus
[50:04] Christ will remain in heaven until
[50:07] everything is restored on earth that's
[50:09] what we were thinking about earlier the
[50:11] miracles amen until Jesus is going to
[50:14] remain there until the miracles are
[50:15] restored the doctrines restored the life
[50:18] is restored the the teachings restored
[50:21] all that the early church had is going
[50:23] to be restored and then Jesus Christ
[50:25] will come back for his church amen
[50:28] that's exactly what the Bible says right
[50:30] there that's exactly what it says now go
[50:32] to Matthew 7 tear yeah Matthew 17 yeah
[50:36] Matthew 17 verse 11 yeah because I read
[50:40] acts 17:11 and now it's Matthew 17 11 so
[50:43] I got my 17 11s going on here and Jesus
[50:49] Christ says it himself that Elijah is
[50:52] gonna come and restore all things and
[50:55] one of those things to be restored was
[50:57] the mystery of marriage and divorce the
[51:00] mystery of original sin there's all
[51:02] kinds of truths that were lost the
[51:05] mystery of predestination right the
[51:08] mystery
[51:08] of God's sovereignty eternal security
[51:10] the mystery of the book of life all the
[51:13] all these truths that people that the
[51:15] Saints knew were lost and they've got to
[51:18] be restored so Matthew I'm sorry yeah
[51:21] Matthew 17 11 and jesus answered and
[51:24] said he lies truly shall first come and
[51:26] restore all things so see everything in
[51:30] the Bible all the all the truths that
[51:32] were lost have to be restored and I'm
[51:35] happy to be living in the day when
[51:37] they've been restored amen hallelujah
[51:40] how do you know they've been restored
[51:42] because of Revelation 10 7 let's go
[51:44] there now how do you know they've been
[51:46] restored because the Bible says the
[51:48] mysteries of God must be finished first
[51:52] and then they're brought down to earth
[51:54] and then they're scattered around the
[51:56] world the the Great Commission must be
[51:59] fulfilled praise God so revelation 10 7
[52:04] but in the days of the voice of the
[52:06] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[52:07] sound the mystery of God should be
[52:09] finished as he has declared to his
[52:11] servants the prophets so there's going
[52:14] to come a time when the mysteries of God
[52:16] are going to be finished and then in
[52:18] verse 8 and the voice which I had heard
[52:20] from heaven spake unto me again and said
[52:22] go and take the little book which is
[52:24] open now what did it contain the
[52:25] mysteries because that's what it says in
[52:27] verse 7 and then it says take that book
[52:31] and which is in which is open in the
[52:34] hand of the angel which standeth upon
[52:35] the sea and upon the earth and I went to
[52:37] the angel and said unto him give me the
[52:39] little book and he said unto me take it
[52:41] and eat it up and it shall make thy
[52:43] belly bitter and it shall be in thy
[52:45] mouth sweet as honey isn't it great to
[52:48] talk about the message but it's a lot
[52:49] harder to live the message right Church
[52:53] it's great to talk about but it's
[52:55] another thing to live it praise God
[52:57] that's where we see so many fall away
[52:59] verse 11 and he said to me thou must
[53:03] prophesy again before many peoples and
[53:06] nations and tongues and kings so the
[53:09] idea is the book gets open in heaven
[53:12] the seals get loose that's we sang about
[53:14] earlier it gets brought down to heaven
[53:16] it's given to a seventh angel on the
[53:19] earth but then John is a symbol of the
[53:20] church he
[53:21] the book eats it and the voice said go
[53:23] prophesied to every kindred nation and
[53:26] tongue well we know by history John
[53:27] didn't do that John didn't travel around
[53:29] the world right he went to that island
[53:31] of Patmos in his late 90s there and then
[53:34] came back to his his home of origin and
[53:37] died we know he didn't travel around the
[53:39] world so this is prophetic this is
[53:41] prophetic that the bride the believer
[53:44] like John would take the book when it's
[53:46] revealed when the mysteries are finished
[53:48] and then prophesied again all around the
[53:50] world and then then Jesus can come back
[53:53] he said when the gospel has been
[53:55] preached to every nation praise God amen
[53:57] oh that's the gospel truth if I know it
[54:00] praise God Ethan and then brother Graham
[54:03] had many fruits to his ministry I think
[54:04] Natalia was here when we saw I think you
[54:06] saw the picture of sister Florence Humes
[54:09] yeah you were here I think you here at
[54:10] part one that's right I've met I met her
[54:13] before she passed she was in brother
[54:15] Graham's prayer line it's recorded on
[54:17] tape brother man prophesied to her and
[54:19] told her she was gonna be healed of
[54:20] tuberculosis and she was praise God
[54:22] there's many fruit to the ministry like
[54:25] even still ministers today that knew
[54:26] brother Branham that were faithful to
[54:28] the message that he preached there's
[54:30] many hundreds and thousands of people
[54:32] that are receiving Christ and being
[54:34] saved in the message I'm one of them
[54:36] praise God amen I am a fruit to the
[54:39] ministry of the message praise God that
[54:42] brother Branham preached hallelujah and
[54:44] then last Wednesday or Wednesday we saw
[54:47] the angel visitation the angels told
[54:50] Balaram he would pray for kings and
[54:52] potentates and and rulers and brother
[54:56] Branham did we showed you the pictures
[54:58] there we showed you we showed you that
[55:00] on Wednesday night so if you want to see
[55:02] that again let me know I can email that
[55:03] to you as a PDF it's a very small file
[55:06] so the very the very thing that angel
[55:09] foretold him in 1946 came to pass praise
[55:13] God and he prayed for great men and and
[55:16] women and God healed them praise the
[55:19] Lord hallelujah so so that's just a
[55:22] short little summary again of why I
[55:24] believe William Branham was a prophet a
[55:26] genuine prophet of God amen
[55:29] and of course there's more to be said I
[55:31] just tried to summarize it like that all
[55:33] right
[55:35] Paul we then we saw how Paul needed
[55:38] proven you know those Marines just
[55:41] didn't you know accept everything he
[55:43] said they took everything he said back
[55:45] to the word and the Bible called them
[55:47] Noble which were of great kingly we'd
[55:51] say kingly ability or or kingly descent
[55:54] in other words they were very
[55:55] spiritually mature people praise God and
[55:57] we must always be ready to give answers
[56:00] and many times a day we see people that
[56:02] don't want to do this because if you
[56:04] want to find the answer you got a dig
[56:06] deeper you gotta wait upon the Lord
[56:08] you've got to invest your time you got
[56:10] to invest your energy and to study
[56:12] things out and and you got to put
[56:13] yourself kind of in the middle and you
[56:15] don't feel as stable you got to put
[56:17] yourself in a a little difficult
[56:19] position so you see people that they
[56:21] just they want to get rid of all the
[56:23] questions they don't want to address any
[56:24] questions about brother Branham or
[56:26] anything he taught they just want to
[56:27] make everything that he said true but
[56:30] you can we've got to do what the Bible
[56:31] says we got to have an answer for the
[56:34] reason of the hope that we have within
[56:36] us amen but yet there come a great
[56:39] falling away from the truth which we of
[56:41] course are seeing today now there are
[56:44] seven statements from the the tape
[56:46] church movement which as we said was the
[56:48] the jeffersonville movement and the one
[56:51] where we were focusing on now hopefully
[56:53] we'll finish today is every word brother
[56:56] Adam said was us at the Lord that's a
[56:58] false statement that's not true there
[57:01] are things of course that he said that
[57:03] are true with thus saith the Lord but
[57:05] they were but this group wants to make
[57:06] every word he said thus saith the Lord
[57:09] has this helped yourself our church okay
[57:11] I hope so
[57:13] now I moved it up to nineteen I had
[57:16] nothing at eighteen on there on
[57:17] Wednesday
[57:18] I have nineteen statements that I
[57:20] believe brother Branham even agrees with
[57:22] he was wrong on and actually found
[57:25] another today I was listening to try and
[57:26] do God a service from November of 65 and
[57:29] brother Ram told his wife and it's on
[57:31] tape he told his wife before he went out
[57:34] west I'm going to die because he had the
[57:36] vision of the seven angels coming and
[57:38] the blast remember brother man said it I
[57:40] heard it on Dave this morning he said
[57:41] honey I'm gonna die he told his wife I'm
[57:43] going to die I'm going out west to die
[57:45] but the the vision end up being it
[57:48] he interpreted the vision wrong it
[57:51] wasn't that he was the dye is that it
[57:53] was to shake the earth and he meet the
[57:55] seven angels who would tell him go back
[57:57] east and open up the seven seals he says
[58:01] it didn't mean my death
[58:02] it meant a furthering of my work Amen
[58:04] there's another thing on tape
[58:07] that's not thus saith the Lord so I
[58:09] could add this I could make it twenty
[58:10] but I just heard this morning I didn't
[58:12] have time to write down all the quotes
[58:14] so we went through you know his when
[58:17] he's talking about he how he sinned
[58:19] twice we know those weren't thus saith
[58:21] the Lord because God doesn't teach us to
[58:24] sin the four predictions 1977 death by
[58:28] gunshot Billy Paul was as Joseph and the
[58:31] Martin Luther King prediction those were
[58:32] not thus saith the Lord as far as we can
[58:34] see brother Ram admits he said I don't
[58:36] say this I don't say the Lord tell me
[58:38] this he said I'm just saying my opinion
[58:39] and then there was five doctrines that
[58:43] we finished on Wednesday we saw how
[58:46] brother man said Jesus was not on the
[58:48] throne any more but then later he says
[58:49] he is but madam said the white horse
[58:52] rider was the Holy Spirit but then he
[58:54] changes it to the Antichrist with thus
[58:56] sayeth the Lord then he says the Holy
[58:58] Ghost is the third person he says Jesus
[59:00] is the third person and then he said
[59:02] there's not three persons then he said
[59:05] there's seven weeks from Pentecost
[59:06] atonement and then he fixed that and
[59:08] said that was wrong then he said the new
[59:11] birth was not the baptism of the Holy
[59:13] Spirit but then he said it was when in
[59:15] the same praise the Lord and now there's
[59:18] a statements we'll go through some of
[59:20] them here today by God's grace I'm sorry
[59:25] yeah some of these we went over on
[59:26] Wednesday night Butler Adams said your
[59:28] three persons but then he fixed it he
[59:31] said you're in a cycle of three but one
[59:34] person remember that on Wednesday
[59:36] brother Branham had a slip of the tongue
[59:38] and said Rebecca went to go meet her
[59:41] bride which would be a sin for a woman
[59:46] to go meet a bride so we know program
[59:49] left out the word groom does that
[59:52] stumble anybody doesn't some of me
[59:53] because you didn't say they'll say it
[59:55] the Lord but see we that proves though
[59:57] again you can't make every word
[59:58] infallible well Ram said first that
[1:00:01] Mary's egg
[1:00:02] United with God's germ to make the body
[1:00:04] of Jesus but then he changed it later
[1:00:07] and said no God did both egg and germ
[1:00:10] okay and then there's a quote that's
[1:00:14] kind of hard to understand some people
[1:00:17] believe brother I'm saying it's okay to
[1:00:19] wear a little makeup but he could be
[1:00:21] talking about hair color as well it's
[1:00:23] kind of hard to tell but that's why some
[1:00:25] message people wear a little bit of
[1:00:27] makeup because well graham said if
[1:00:29] you're colourless he said a little bit
[1:00:31] of color would be all right I imagine
[1:00:33] but it's hard to know if he's talking
[1:00:35] about hair color or eye color I just
[1:00:38] leave it although if the Bible condemns
[1:00:41] makeup three times
[1:00:42] we'll just leave it although brother Ram
[1:00:45] said if you get the Holy Ghost it'll
[1:00:46] make it take all the makeup makeup off
[1:00:48] your face so I just try to bet you have
[1:00:52] to balance these quotes out and some of
[1:00:53] them are very hard to understand but see
[1:00:57] our anchor see that's our anchors not in
[1:00:59] a man our anchors in the word and the
[1:01:02] Holy Spirit will always direct us to the
[1:01:04] word praise God now I got four more
[1:01:09] statements actually five but let me go
[1:01:12] back to this one because I ended this
[1:01:13] one on Wednesday night how it seemed
[1:01:17] like brother Ram was saying time would
[1:01:19] be no more does anybody remember me
[1:01:21] saying that on Wednesday night okay I
[1:01:23] don't know if I got to go all the way
[1:01:26] through that okay yeah so this is a bit
[1:01:33] misunderstood if you listen to God
[1:01:38] hiding himself at simplicity if you
[1:01:40] listen to the breach between the church
[1:01:42] ages and the seals and the first seal on
[1:01:45] numerous times in their Road Ram says
[1:01:47] when the lamb takes the book and he
[1:01:50] comes out of the throne and he opens the
[1:01:52] book
[1:01:53] there's no more Redemption he says
[1:01:54] because mediation is over
[1:01:56] in other words Jesus's body's no longer
[1:01:58] sitting down on a throne of God making
[1:02:01] intercession it's now standing and the
[1:02:03] book is open well brother Graham he
[1:02:07] seems to think that but by the end of
[1:02:10] the the next year in 64 he's already
[1:02:13] saying no they're still mercy don't ever
[1:02:16] think there
[1:02:16] no more mediation so we can see that he
[1:02:19] struggled with it himself now who
[1:02:22] wouldn't church which one of us wouldn't
[1:02:23] struggle with that which one of us have
[1:02:25] a perfect understanding of the Bible now
[1:02:28] red Ram was memory is preaching this at
[1:02:29] a time where you're singing visit
[1:02:30] visions daily right we're for the seals
[1:02:32] he's he's at a time was a very spiritual
[1:02:35] time and he and he was very spiritual
[1:02:38] and he wanted to be on his toes and and
[1:02:39] he wanted the people to be ready for the
[1:02:41] coming of Lord aren't you glad he wasn't
[1:02:43] ever ready to be ready for the coming of
[1:02:44] Lord don't you want to be ready for the
[1:02:46] coming of the Lord
[1:02:46] and so there's no sin in this because he
[1:02:50] never says thus saith the Lord but we
[1:02:52] you can see as you read the quotes there
[1:02:54] was uncertainty he didn't know how much
[1:02:57] time was left he didn't know there's
[1:02:59] there's even a statement he makes in the
[1:03:01] seals he said you just wait he said if
[1:03:03] if there was that Holy Ghost come in the
[1:03:05] church at the end of the church ages and
[1:03:07] made a light in January 61 on the back
[1:03:10] wall he says wait till you see what
[1:03:12] happens on Sunday night when that seven
[1:03:14] seals open up as far as we know nothing
[1:03:16] happened but he was under such
[1:03:18] expectation he easily said Maya if I had
[1:03:22] such a if God moved under such a message
[1:03:24] is that what about these seals when I've
[1:03:27] had all these visions all these days he
[1:03:29] was just presuming he was just thinking
[1:03:32] that there was going to be a great move
[1:03:34] now let's look at these quotes here
[1:03:36] Church know and these are the ones my
[1:03:39] family and I've been listening to though
[1:03:40] we've been listening to God hiding
[1:03:43] himself and right now we're at right at
[1:03:44] the end of this sermon the breach we're
[1:03:46] right at the end of this listen it's
[1:03:47] just ten minutes a night together now
[1:03:49] watch when he comes to seven horns now
[1:03:51] when he saw this land John looking at it
[1:03:54] he it looked like had been slain or
[1:03:56] bloody so if you got your Bible
[1:03:57] revelation five six and I beheld and lo
[1:04:01] in the midst of the throne and of the
[1:04:03] four beasts in the midst of the elders
[1:04:04] stood a lamb as have been slain having
[1:04:07] seven horns and seven seven eyes which
[1:04:11] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[1:04:13] into all the earth now so see brother
[1:04:18] Branham is saying you know John sees
[1:04:20] Jesus bloody like a lamb and he's come
[1:04:23] from eternity now look and he cease to
[1:04:26] be
[1:04:27] mediator so the people are thinking well
[1:04:31] if God's going to open the seals through
[1:04:33] you then mediations over on Sunday night
[1:04:36] after the seven seals preached right can
[1:04:38] you see how people could understand that
[1:04:40] could anybody see that I can clearly see
[1:04:43] it I'm not sure that's what he's saying
[1:04:45] but he said these words okay then pray
[1:04:48] to Mary as much as you want to there's
[1:04:50] no man in heaven or person nowhere
[1:04:52] nowhere else he could take it John even
[1:04:54] wept about it he said Oh Catholic friend
[1:04:57] don't pray to some dead person the Lambs
[1:04:58] only meat here see he was when it comes
[1:05:00] forth so see it just it sounds like
[1:05:03] program saying after the seals are open
[1:05:06] when Jesus comes and takes the book and
[1:05:08] loose the seals there's no more
[1:05:10] mediation can everybody see that that's
[1:05:12] what it looks like
[1:05:13] I'm not saying he meant that you know
[1:05:16] we'll see later what he says now look at
[1:05:21] this quote now this is the one somebody
[1:05:24] that left our church recently shared
[1:05:26] with me and tried to say there's no more
[1:05:28] salvation for denominations anymore only
[1:05:31] in the message and ice' agree with that
[1:05:32] I heartily disagree with that but this
[1:05:35] is the quote they use now the mystery of
[1:05:38] the book are revealed when the seals are
[1:05:41] broken and when the seals completely are
[1:05:43] broken the time of redemption is over
[1:05:46] because the lamb left the intercession
[1:05:48] booth to walk out to take his claims he
[1:05:51] was a mediator between that but when the
[1:05:53] real revelation happens on the seals
[1:05:55] they begin to break the lamb is coming
[1:05:56] forth from the sanctuary it's according
[1:05:58] to the word now here's what I wrote does
[1:06:00] he mean at the end of this sermon series
[1:06:02] in March of 63 or does he mean when
[1:06:06] they're when they're completely broken
[1:06:08] at the opening of the Seventh Seal or
[1:06:10] the rapture
[1:06:11] I believe the rapture right once the
[1:06:15] rapture goes the Bible says once the
[1:06:17] rapture goes Jesus snatches that's what
[1:06:19] the word catching up means Jesus
[1:06:21] snatches away his bride after that Satan
[1:06:23] and judgment fall right then there's no
[1:06:26] more mercy for the G for the Gentiles
[1:06:29] because the wrath of God is poured out
[1:06:31] of them but instead Jesus the Bible said
[1:06:34] in Romans 11 God blinded the Jews
[1:06:37] so the Gentiles can be saved after all
[1:06:39] the Gentiles are saved
[1:06:41] takes the blinders off of Israel and
[1:06:42] then they see Jesus and 144,000 are born
[1:06:46] again praise God that's what this is
[1:06:50] speaking of but I can see how people
[1:06:53] might stumble over it
[1:06:54] I wondered for a while Church maybe you
[1:06:57] did it but I wondered because if you
[1:06:59] study the quotes he says it a lot and
[1:07:01] you want to take what a prophet says
[1:07:02] wouldn't take it to heart right but the
[1:07:07] main answer is keep waiting on God
[1:07:09] that's usually the main answer right
[1:07:10] just wait upon the Lord he'll renew your
[1:07:13] strength now here's another one that's
[1:07:16] difficult to understand too he said as
[1:07:18] soon as the final name had been splashed
[1:07:20] in that Clorox of bleach then his
[1:07:22] intercessory days was over that him
[1:07:24] that's filthy be filthy still that's
[1:07:25] according revelation 22 11 at him that's
[1:07:29] filthy be filthy still him that's holy
[1:07:31] he's holy still see and he leaves the
[1:07:34] sanctuary and then it becomes a judgment
[1:07:35] seat woe unto those outside of Christ
[1:07:38] then but notice it's to be revealed when
[1:07:40] the lamb leaves his intercessory place
[1:07:43] from the father
[1:07:44] now that's revelation five and look what
[1:07:47] he just said
[1:07:48] well Ram said he leaves intercession in
[1:07:51] Revelation five but that can't actually
[1:07:55] be the truth right because we after the
[1:07:59] seals are open people still have to be
[1:08:00] saved used to how many only believe
[1:08:03] you're saying Amen yes you have to be
[1:08:07] able to be saved so see how brother man
[1:08:10] the way he brings out maybe just didn't
[1:08:11] bring it out the right way but see now
[1:08:14] he takes the book of the seals this the
[1:08:16] book of seals or a book seal with seals
[1:08:18] breaks them and shows them see at the
[1:08:20] end of the age now after the intercessor
[1:08:23] ease over the church ages has finished
[1:08:24] up now there he might be referring to
[1:08:26] after the rapture but church even this
[1:08:30] one is difficult because he said that's
[1:08:32] revelation 5 but the seals are open to
[1:08:34] revelation 6 right so see Church let's
[1:08:39] be kind with people because things can
[1:08:42] be confusing because he was growing in
[1:08:45] Revelation now this is what I told you
[1:08:51] about on Wednesday
[1:08:52] in November of 63 brother Brandon
[1:08:55] preached souls that were in prison now
[1:08:56] and showed how Jesus when he was
[1:08:59] crucified his body stay in the tomb his
[1:09:01] spirit went to hell and preach to those
[1:09:04] who rejected Noah right so he was
[1:09:07] preaching to people that were already
[1:09:10] lost and there's no way they could be
[1:09:11] saved and brother Graham believed that
[1:09:14] that would repeat here at Jesus's second
[1:09:17] coming mr. program teaches his message
[1:09:20] and says you know men perhaps the bride
[1:09:22] will have a ministry to the eternal Lost
[1:09:24] and makes it sound like it could be
[1:09:28] happening at that moment see he said I
[1:09:32] don't know what the this is true but
[1:09:35] it's got to be that way sometime he's
[1:09:37] talking about preaching these are no
[1:09:38] lost see it's got to come to that and it
[1:09:40] could be now in every way the world will
[1:09:42] carry right on people will still come to
[1:09:44] the altar still they're still crying out
[1:09:46] but it won't do them no good see they'll
[1:09:48] be gone see it'll be over there won't be
[1:09:49] no more mercy remember that and the
[1:09:51] Saints sure I become smokey he that's
[1:09:53] filthy filthy still he that's righteous
[1:09:55] righteous still he this whole he's holy
[1:09:57] still there's no more mercy when the
[1:09:59] lamb takes the book that's it see that's
[1:10:01] all of it and it looks a whole like it
[1:10:03] could be now so see could be he's trying
[1:10:08] his best to place the people so they're
[1:10:11] ready for the coming of the Lord amen
[1:10:13] and this is I listen to it again this
[1:10:16] week this is where brother and you can
[1:10:18] hear the women crying as brother Rams
[1:10:20] praying God don't let my children be
[1:10:22] loss save a Rebecca and Sarah and Joseph
[1:10:26] you can listen to it listen listen the
[1:10:29] end of the sermon the women are crying
[1:10:30] and crying out brother I was praying for
[1:10:32] his children Oh God may they not be lost
[1:10:34] may they be saved because he thinks time
[1:10:37] might be over
[1:10:38] he thinks the lamb might be off the
[1:10:40] intercessory or an accessory seat he
[1:10:44] says maybe we have another day maybe
[1:10:47] today's that day maybe tonight is the
[1:10:50] last night when that would shake us up
[1:10:52] if I came here and said this is the last
[1:10:55] day to get saved that would shake us up
[1:10:56] well let's get let's get them all saved
[1:10:59] maybe this is the last year I don't know
[1:11:02] friends I'm telling you I don't know
[1:11:03] it'll never be told me and then he said
[1:11:06] that I'll never be told because no man
[1:11:08] knows the day or the hour now a year
[1:11:15] later or yes less than a year later they
[1:11:18] said brother Ram have you made
[1:11:19] statements recently concerning the
[1:11:20] church age has ended
[1:11:21] Laodicea no I never said it's ended if I
[1:11:25] did you misunderstood or I said it wrong
[1:11:29] see this is the last church age it's the
[1:11:32] end of the church ages the Laodicea it
[1:11:34] hasn't ended when it ends the church is
[1:11:36] gone so as long as the church is here it
[1:11:39] hasn't ended praise God
[1:11:42] alright now let me go back now is that
[1:11:45] helped by God's grace that's why some
[1:11:47] people that we know friends love loved
[1:11:49] ones that we don't know have left
[1:11:51] because of those quotes and they think
[1:11:53] I'm not preaching the truth which that's
[1:11:55] fine they don't have to believe
[1:11:56] everything I say but just so you know
[1:11:59] that we've got to find the truth and all
[1:12:01] that I hate to see people Levi but worse
[1:12:06] I hate to see him going to sin I don't
[1:12:08] mind if they go to another Church but we
[1:12:10] want everybody in church but see that
[1:12:13] just so people understand like these are
[1:12:14] the some of the things that that we get
[1:12:16] that we get challenged on or we we've
[1:12:18] got to find an answer for and and we
[1:12:20] want we want the honest to goodness
[1:12:21] truth we want the truth straight from
[1:12:23] the Word of God amen
[1:12:26] praise God now here's four more
[1:12:30] statements here that it seems like
[1:12:33] brother Branham never said thus saith
[1:12:36] the Lord on but yet people that say he
[1:12:38] said the state the Lord on they have to
[1:12:40] be wrong but RAM said there's 700 Jews
[1:12:43] that didn't bow their knee to bail in
[1:12:45] the days of Elijah and then he said your
[1:12:48] bodies made of 80 percent water and
[1:12:50] petroleum and he said Judas never had
[1:12:54] faith but before he said he did and then
[1:12:57] Trinitarians are lost and then he said
[1:13:00] but other times he said they're saved
[1:13:02] okay I hope everybody's
[1:13:07] okay there's every okay today is this
[1:13:10] really making you think yeah it makes me
[1:13:13] think praise God now so that's uh I just
[1:13:19] I got some more things more quotes here
[1:13:20] I just don't want to miss some of these
[1:13:25] okay now in the fourth seal this is very
[1:13:27] plain brother branham tells us this here
[1:13:31] he says I'm gonna skip down to the boat
[1:13:35] trying to find my spot here thank you
[1:13:43] for your patience here enemy get caught
[1:13:46] up okay thank you
[1:13:54] so our preaching here in March brother
[1:13:58] branham accidentally said 700 Jews had
[1:14:00] not bowed their knees to bail
[1:14:02] so he says Elijah never knew even one of
[1:14:07] them was that way he thought he was the
[1:14:08] only one saved until God opened one of
[1:14:10] the seals and showed in the midst of the
[1:14:11] book and that had 700 that had never
[1:14:15] bowed down to them creeds that they had
[1:14:18] he said God opened the book to Elijah
[1:14:20] said now wait a minute I got 700 that's
[1:14:22] tucked around out there got their names
[1:14:24] in the book since the foundational world
[1:14:26] he said they're mine and program them
[1:14:28] brings it to the Jeffersonville people
[1:14:29] and he said don't you know God's got
[1:14:31] perhaps he's got 700 here in the
[1:14:33] tabernacle they're not bowed their knee
[1:14:35] to Mayo to see ya he says I'm gonna open
[1:14:41] up one of the seals and show you
[1:14:42] something you know I got 700 back there
[1:14:44] that ain't bout a knee or join any of
[1:14:45] them Creed's there's 700 of them ready
[1:14:48] for the rapture so people get all shook
[1:14:50] up Oh only 700 are gonna go in the
[1:14:52] rapture see cuz they're they're growing
[1:14:56] trying to understand how do you
[1:14:58] understand the Prophet and they had to
[1:15:01] learn not everything he said was thus
[1:15:03] saith the Lord but they shook him up
[1:15:06] should come up a lot
[1:15:08] cuz the Bible says yea I have left me
[1:15:11] seven thousand brother have said seven
[1:15:13] hundred the people get all shook it up
[1:15:15] Oh every word you know they wonder about
[1:15:17] every word but the Bible says seven
[1:15:20] thousand
[1:15:21] and then they asked him a few days later
[1:15:23] did you mean to say 7000 who not bowed
[1:15:26] their knee or 700 he said 7000 I meant
[1:15:29] to say forgive me for that it's just a
[1:15:31] manner of speech he goes on to say yeah
[1:15:35] forgive me please brethren you on the
[1:15:37] tape listen I didn't mean to say I'm a
[1:15:38] minister of the gospel many times I've
[1:15:40] preached that I know there was 7000 I
[1:15:42] just happened to say 700
[1:15:43] I didn't mean just 700 I just didn't
[1:15:47] read it out of the scripture see just
[1:15:51] come to my mind while I was talking I
[1:15:52] just said 700 a 7000 I make them
[1:15:55] mistakes all the time all right so what
[1:16:00] does he do he humbles himself he says
[1:16:02] forgive me if I make a mistake now did
[1:16:05] he ever say they'll say thil or on any
[1:16:06] of these no so that's why it doesn't
[1:16:09] stumble me because we have so much such
[1:16:11] truth I already showed you the stay at
[1:16:13] the Lord's the mysteries the restored
[1:16:15] truce I mean we have so much truth but
[1:16:18] these are the things people stumble over
[1:16:20] and we've got to prove all things and
[1:16:22] rightly divide the word of God now
[1:16:25] here's a statement you know as I've been
[1:16:28] studying the message thirst 65 program
[1:16:31] said were 80% water and petroleum now
[1:16:37] program often taught were made up of the
[1:16:39] following elements he said petroleum
[1:16:41] when out Petroleum's a liquid mixture of
[1:16:44] hydrocarbons or it's a hydrogen and
[1:16:47] carbon compound found in rocks
[1:16:50] he said we're petroleum cosmic light
[1:16:53] which are cosmic rays they're almost as
[1:16:55] fast as light rays but they enter
[1:16:57] Earth's atmosphere from outer space he
[1:17:00] said calcium and potash potash is
[1:17:04] potassium compound from wood ashes okay
[1:17:07] so my dad says that's what we're made of
[1:17:09] he says it over and over again and some
[1:17:11] of those things may be true i but it
[1:17:13] doesn't seem like we're made of
[1:17:14] petroleum okay because look what he says
[1:17:17] here and if so you better go drink you
[1:17:19] some petroleum because he says and
[1:17:21] you've got to take those sources in to
[1:17:23] keep you so next time you get gas take a
[1:17:26] little sip yourself take some in
[1:17:30] yourself
[1:17:31] now see you wouldn't do that and we
[1:17:33] laugh right it's just a slip of the
[1:17:35] stuff of his memory right now science
[1:17:41] websites say we're made of oxygen atomic
[1:17:44] number eight hydrogen atomic number one
[1:17:47] carbon which but which remember it's
[1:17:50] kind of in some of those atomic number
[1:17:52] six nitrogen number seven and calcium he
[1:17:55] does have calcium that was number 20 and
[1:17:58] then phosphorus is atomic number fifteen
[1:18:03] okay so this is honestly just an honest
[1:18:05] mistake right
[1:18:07] it cannot be thus saith the Lord to keep
[1:18:10] taking in petroleum so you can survive
[1:18:13] because you've never taken in petroleum
[1:18:15] and yet you're surviving but yeah the
[1:18:19] people stand there and say every word is
[1:18:22] thus saith the lord not that cannot be
[1:18:23] thus saith the lord he just got his
[1:18:25] scientific terms mixed up and the church
[1:18:28] said okay see see we just catch you know
[1:18:33] you catch these things and just want to
[1:18:35] lay them out now in 65 brother branham
[1:18:41] said Judas never had any faith he said
[1:18:43] if Judas was to see the enemy
[1:18:45] discrepancy and also become flesh and
[1:18:47] dwelt among us and the person of Judas
[1:18:48] he never had no real faith real faith he
[1:18:52] had what he thought was a faith there's
[1:18:53] such a thing as having faith and a
[1:18:55] make-believe faith now for this for many
[1:18:57] years I believe this quote but then as I
[1:18:59] study the scripture I kind of changed I
[1:19:03] kind of went back to brother branham's
[1:19:04] previous teaching where he taught Judas
[1:19:06] did have real faith because here it is
[1:19:09] right here
[1:19:09] well I'm sorry now watch Judas Iscariot
[1:19:12] was justified by faith and believed on
[1:19:16] the Lord Jesus and was baptized and the
[1:19:20] Bible says the disciples believed John
[1:19:24] 2:11 now I could be wrong on this I
[1:19:27] could have the wrong doctrine so I just
[1:19:29] want to be humble and say I could be
[1:19:30] wrong but the side I'm taking now is
[1:19:32] that I believe Judas had real faith
[1:19:34] because the Bible said he believed the
[1:19:37] disciples believed he was judged by man
[1:19:39] he was justified remembered
[1:19:43] Jesus didn't baptize anybody other than
[1:19:45] the disciples but his disciples right
[1:19:48] and then disciples did all the other
[1:19:50] baptizing now here by RAM says plainly
[1:19:54] Judas believed the word okay but then
[1:19:59] another said one quote where he says he
[1:20:01] never had any faith to begin with so
[1:20:05] which one do you take well you can take
[1:20:07] whatever one you want does it pertain to
[1:20:09] salvation if you believe one of the
[1:20:11] other gonna be lost or saved no because
[1:20:14] your face not in question here Judas
[1:20:16] says faith is in question here and your
[1:20:18] faith is determined by what you believe
[1:20:20] and what you confess and what you live
[1:20:23] so this has nothing to do with salvation
[1:20:24] right but I believed you just did have
[1:20:28] genuine faith like these quotes say I
[1:20:30] just think maybe he changed his mind at
[1:20:33] the end well Graham said they said was
[1:20:37] Judas Iscariot's name blot off the lands
[1:20:39] book of life or wasn't even on it yes it
[1:20:41] was on it and blotted out okay next this
[1:20:52] one here all right now here's the one
[1:20:57] believe the sign really Labor's on they
[1:21:00] tried to say that brother Graham taught
[1:21:03] all Trinitarians are lost now I think if
[1:21:06] you I think if you think about this
[1:21:08] scripture this quote I think it makes
[1:21:10] sense because he's talking about
[1:21:13] revelation okay but let's read it here
[1:21:15] he said Jesus he said jesus said except
[1:21:18] you believe that I am he you will die in
[1:21:19] your sin he is the revelation of God the
[1:21:22] spirit of God revealed in human form you
[1:21:24] can't believe that you're lost you put
[1:21:28] them a third person or a second or any
[1:21:29] of the person besides God you're lost
[1:21:34] now see I think it
[1:21:39] how you interpret this because remember
[1:21:43] Jesus asked Peter who do men say that I
[1:21:46] am
[1:21:46] and he said flesh and blood has not
[1:21:48] revealed this so Peters faith in Christ
[1:21:51] was based upon revelation right it was
[1:21:56] based upon revelation and Peter had
[1:21:58] revelation of he believed in Jesus
[1:22:01] Christ he did miracles but he still
[1:22:03] wasn't born again right so I can see
[1:22:07] some truth in this whereas if you turn
[1:22:10] down the revelation of believing in
[1:22:13] Jesus Christ you're lost but I don't
[1:22:16] believe that every Trinitarian is lost
[1:22:19] and again Church I'll just be humble I
[1:22:21] could be wrong on this but I believe God
[1:22:23] can save Trinitarians it's because
[1:22:26] there's more quotes and scripture on the
[1:22:29] other side than for this side and that's
[1:22:32] and I'm not going to taking sides
[1:22:33] against brother Branham you understand
[1:22:34] I'm taking sides against the way people
[1:22:36] interpret this quote from brother
[1:22:38] Branham because look what he says here
[1:22:42] remember he is is where he says
[1:22:44] Trinitarian is trinitarianism the belief
[1:22:46] is wrong it's of the devil thus saith
[1:22:49] the Lord but he says do you believe all
[1:22:51] these Trinitarians are of hell no sir
[1:22:53] I believe they're Christians they asked
[1:23:03] brother Branham you said the rapture
[1:23:05] just be a small number he said what
[1:23:08] about the people that believe in the
[1:23:09] Lord but don't believe the way you
[1:23:11] preach they don't have to believe this
[1:23:14] they don't have to believe the way I
[1:23:16] preach it see don't have to believe that
[1:23:18] for the last day message will they be
[1:23:20] saved yes if they believe the Lord Amen
[1:23:24] so bro man says you don't have to follow
[1:23:26] me to be saved see any man would say
[1:23:28] that praise God
[1:23:29] any man his right mind would say that
[1:23:32] it's not knowing any man that makes you
[1:23:34] say this knowing the man Jesus Christ
[1:23:36] that makes you saved and I like what he
[1:23:40] adds in here though because I believe
[1:23:41] this is true if you won the baptism of
[1:23:43] Holy Ghost you have to hear this message
[1:23:46] because in acts 19 Apollo's church in
[1:23:50] Ephesus could not receive the Holy Ghost
[1:23:52] until they heard pop reach the Holy
[1:23:55] Ghost they had to receive the prophet of
[1:23:59] that hour Amen Alleluia that's what I
[1:24:05] believe to go in the rapture you have to
[1:24:07] receive the revelation of God you don't
[1:24:11] know how to know brother Branham but I
[1:24:13] think if you get the Holy Ghost you'll
[1:24:15] pretty soon find out about him because
[1:24:17] you want to know where those revelations
[1:24:19] came from right but it's not knowing
[1:24:23] brother Branham his life knowing Jesus
[1:24:25] Christ his life amen but then you but
[1:24:29] you can't escape the fact that God
[1:24:31] always sent a man to teach the latest
[1:24:34] revelation of his word
[1:24:36] he always did Noah Moses and and Jesus
[1:24:39] and Joshua you know you you named him
[1:24:42] Paul you Martin Luther John Wesley name
[1:24:44] of all God I said a man and you had to
[1:24:47] receive the word that he was preaching
[1:24:51] now like we says next if they disagree I
[1:24:54] don't believe he's a word I don't
[1:24:55] believe this is right I don't believe in
[1:24:56] the bat until he goes that shows where
[1:24:58] they're headed for the tribulation but
[1:25:01] those who can accept the word in his
[1:25:02] fullness not me preaching it because
[1:25:05] it's the Bible says so there it is right
[1:25:07] there look he says it's not about me so
[1:25:10] much it's about what the Bible says
[1:25:13] those who accept that is free because
[1:25:16] the words already been judged
[1:25:18] amen Alleluia he said but if Catholic
[1:25:25] Pentecostal Baptist Presbyterian
[1:25:26] whatever if he's solidly trusting in
[1:25:29] Jesus Christ he saved because it's by
[1:25:33] faith are you saved and that by Gracie
[1:25:37] Catholics can be saved Baptists can be
[1:25:39] saved Pentecostals are saved because
[1:25:41] that we all accept what Christ did for
[1:25:43] us that's right it's our own personal
[1:25:46] faith in a finished work that Christ did
[1:25:48] for us so see to take that one quote
[1:25:51] from anointed ones at the end time for
[1:25:54] the Amen you got to throw a lot of
[1:25:55] others to take that one and then you got
[1:25:59] to throw up the word where Jesus saves
[1:26:01] people at the white throne judgment and
[1:26:03] they're surprised like when did I ever
[1:26:04] do anything good for a Christian Jesus
[1:26:07] when did I ever do anything good for you
[1:26:08] so they never even knew what where
[1:26:10] Christ was they didn't know Christ was
[1:26:13] living in his people praise God but they
[1:26:16] were good to his people you say brother
[1:26:24] Ram I'm a Catholic I don't care a
[1:26:25] Catholic can be saved as anything is
[1:26:29] that pretty clear Church
[1:26:30] I'm Baptists all right well I'm
[1:26:32] Pentecostal
[1:26:33] a Pentecostal can be saved just like
[1:26:35] anybody else could be a man raised God
[1:26:39] hallelujah glory now you know I missed
[1:26:43] something for Judas
[1:26:45] go back to Luke eight if you got your
[1:26:47] scripture there Luke eight I think it's
[1:26:54] Luke eight 13 or eleven if I could
[1:26:56] remember from my notes yeah it's Luke
[1:27:01] eight thirteen yeah I forgot to say this
[1:27:03] can people believe and then be lost yes
[1:27:07] the Bible said they can believe for a
[1:27:09] while and then reject it and the Bible
[1:27:12] calls it stomping underfoot like like
[1:27:15] publicly stomping on something you used
[1:27:17] to believe that's what the Bible calls
[1:27:19] it so can I lose my salvation
[1:27:22] no if you're a real believer you can't
[1:27:25] lose your salvation head out of there so
[1:27:28] it depends which lens you're looking
[1:27:30] through if we're
[1:27:31] looking through a humble era a
[1:27:33] backslider like judas yeah they can lose
[1:27:36] it but if you're looking at you or a
[1:27:38] believer no it's impossible for you to
[1:27:40] lose your salvation amen
[1:27:43] it depends which side your own it's
[1:27:46] impossible for me to be lost if I'm a
[1:27:48] real genuine believer and if you say
[1:27:53] that once saved always saved you got a
[1:27:55] big problem because Jesus says I are
[1:27:58] Jesus told Moses God told Moses I'm
[1:28:00] gonna blot out all those who sinned
[1:28:03] against me who built that uh that golden
[1:28:06] calf member Moses had blocked me out and
[1:28:09] he said no Moses I appreciate that as a
[1:28:11] mediator he said but I will blot out all
[1:28:13] those who sinned against me he said he
[1:28:16] was going to blot him out their names
[1:28:18] were on some record of life but he said
[1:28:20] I'm gonna blot them out for their
[1:28:21] idolatry and then you can see how
[1:28:23] Ephraim was still the one Ephraim and
[1:28:27] Dan their names get blotted off of the
[1:28:30] tribe list right you can see it plainly
[1:28:32] from Deuteronomy to revelation 7 there's
[1:28:35] worse than and Ephraim they're blotted
[1:28:37] out because of idolatry but the merciful
[1:28:40] God brings those two brothers back
[1:28:42] because God saved those two brothers
[1:28:44] amen their tribes might have been
[1:28:46] brought out but those two brothers came
[1:28:48] back with all their followers they'd
[1:28:50] come back for the Millennium praise God
[1:28:51] hey man see God didn't forget the real
[1:28:55] believer yeah Luke 813 Church they on
[1:29:00] the rock are they which when they hear
[1:29:02] receive the word with joy this is like
[1:29:06] Judas he got so excited when he first
[1:29:08] saw Jesus Messiah and these have no root
[1:29:11] which for a while believe he believed
[1:29:14] for three years three or more and the
[1:29:16] time of temptation fall away he got
[1:29:19] tempted by money and he got tempted and
[1:29:22] he sold out the Bible said he was
[1:29:24] seeking an opportunity to betray Jesus
[1:29:27] and you know what that's the same word
[1:29:29] where Jesus said seek ye first the
[1:29:31] kingdom of God so it shows Judas broke
[1:29:34] the command he should have been seeking
[1:29:37] God's welfare instead of his own welfare
[1:29:39] and that shows where does your seeking
[1:29:42] come from your soul
[1:29:45] you know what Sikh means brother amen it
[1:29:47] means to aim at and strive for
[1:29:49] so he said aim at the kingdom of God
[1:29:52] first everyday strive strive for the
[1:29:57] kingdom of God first Judas did it for a
[1:29:59] number of days right but at some point
[1:30:02] he stopped striving for the kingdom of
[1:30:05] God he started he stopped aiming at the
[1:30:07] kingdom of God and he started aiming at
[1:30:09] money and yet he kept going to the
[1:30:11] revival services and kept going to
[1:30:13] healing services but his aim had changed
[1:30:16] he was aiming for money and taking care
[1:30:19] of himself rather than aiming for
[1:30:21] Christ's welfare so there scripture
[1:30:25] church there's plain scripture Luke 8
[1:30:27] you can believe for what and these are
[1:30:29] Jesus's words read letter words and yet
[1:30:34] this scripture agrees with what Jesus
[1:30:36] said that no man shall be able to pluck
[1:30:38] my children out of the father's hand
[1:30:40] amen because if you're a real believer
[1:30:43] you'll never lose your salvation praise
[1:30:45] God nobody can pluck you out because God
[1:30:48] knows you'll keep his faith to the end
[1:30:49] and also God's holding you as well
[1:30:52] praise God thank the Lord
[1:30:59] yes sir Matthew 25 shows anybody can be
[1:31:03] saved I've said it before Muslim Hindu I
[1:31:07] believe that they can be saved if they
[1:31:10] do something good for a Christian Jesus
[1:31:13] will say when you did it to the
[1:31:15] Christian you did it to me I believed
[1:31:18] that I could be wrong but I believe
[1:31:19] that's very scriptural all right now a
[1:31:24] few more let me go a little bit longer
[1:31:25] here by God's grace
[1:31:26] now you we've heard this before I'd
[1:31:28] rather have the right spirit with the
[1:31:31] wrong doctrine and that's true but we
[1:31:34] should aim for both praise God let me
[1:31:41] read this from
[1:31:41] 61 to answer your question now I do not
[1:31:45] take either sides with you brother and I
[1:31:47] know as long as you fuss you're both
[1:31:48] wrong so see it's okay to differ with
[1:31:51] people you just can't fuss and argue
[1:31:52] about it that's why I'm glad I've you
[1:31:55] know I've had meetings with people that
[1:31:56] have left and I never did by God's grace
[1:31:58] I never did fuss with him one time we
[1:32:01] just chose to agree to disagree and
[1:32:03] that's what I want I want to be a real
[1:32:05] Christian praise God whether it's on the
[1:32:08] phone or face-to-face I don't want to
[1:32:10] fuss I don't want to argue with people I
[1:32:12] want to stand on God's truth praise God
[1:32:16] he says long as you fuss you're both
[1:32:18] wrong because I'd rather be wrong in my
[1:32:20] doctrine and right in my heart than to
[1:32:23] be right in my doctrine and wrong in my
[1:32:25] heart see I said after all it's your
[1:32:29] heart's condition and I made that a
[1:32:33] practice to know this that if a man no
[1:32:35] matter what he does and how much he
[1:32:37] difference difference and what he says
[1:32:39] about me if in my heart not from a duty
[1:32:42] but from my heart I can't love that man
[1:32:44] as well as I love anyone else that I
[1:32:47] know there's something wrong in here
[1:32:49] because it's all about love now remember
[1:32:54] church here the Bible said if any man
[1:32:55] jesus said this is Jesus is worth If any
[1:32:58] man does God's will he shall know of the
[1:33:01] doctrine whether it be of God or whether
[1:33:03] I speak of myself see the people that do
[1:33:07] the message that obey the message will
[1:33:10] be able to recognize true message
[1:33:11] doctrine because it'll be Bible based
[1:33:14] dr. C because as you receive the
[1:33:16] doctrine it's like the word is washing
[1:33:19] you when you receive the word it's like
[1:33:21] water washing you it's brainwashing you
[1:33:24] praise God it's washing out all the
[1:33:26] false doctrine and then with all the
[1:33:28] dirt out and you see you see plainly the
[1:33:31] word of God what it says and if you do
[1:33:33] God's will and obey it you'll know the
[1:33:36] true doctrine say second John 1:9
[1:33:40] whosoever transgresseth and abideth not
[1:33:42] the doctrine of Christ hath not God so
[1:33:46] see only the people that keep the
[1:33:48] doctrine that have the right doctor have
[1:33:50] the right spirit amen
[1:33:52] that's bruising right there but there's
[1:33:54] other
[1:33:55] scriptures approve it glory if you abide
[1:33:59] in Christ you have the right doctrine he
[1:34:04] that abideth and doctrine of Christ he
[1:34:06] hath both the father and the son so
[1:34:08] church we can have both and we should
[1:34:10] strive for both we should strive for the
[1:34:13] right doctrine and the right spirit
[1:34:15] because the Bible says abide in the
[1:34:17] doctrine and now look it'll say abiding
[1:34:19] the love of God - look if you keep my
[1:34:22] Commandments you shall abide in my love
[1:34:24] so see the Bible says both you can't say
[1:34:27] it doesn't you have to abide in the
[1:34:28] right doctrine you have to teach the
[1:34:30] right thing and you also have to abide
[1:34:31] in the love of God and you can't love
[1:34:34] God without loving his people even as I
[1:34:38] have kept my father's Commandments and
[1:34:40] abide in his love he that loveth his
[1:34:43] brother abideth in a light and there's
[1:34:46] none occasion of stumbling in him amen
[1:34:49] see that means he sees all the devil's
[1:34:51] tricks Amen ha ha ha he sees all the
[1:34:54] traps Satan sets worn by the bank and
[1:34:57] he's able to maneuver with skill praise
[1:35:00] God which it which is wisdom amen he's
[1:35:03] able to maneuver around the devil's
[1:35:05] traps and be an overcomer and be a
[1:35:07] conqueror amen hallelujah he doesn't
[1:35:11] stumble in the sins this is someone the
[1:35:13] false doctrine because he's got the love
[1:35:16] of God oh thank you Lord first John 3:14
[1:35:20] we know we passed from death unto life
[1:35:23] because we love the Brethren he that
[1:35:26] loveth not his brother abideth in death
[1:35:29] okay so we C F to have both you have to
[1:35:32] buy to the doctrine here the Bible says
[1:35:33] abiding the doctor and you have to buy
[1:35:36] it in love now right brother bands right
[1:35:39] you'd rather have them I'd rather have
[1:35:41] the right spirit I'd rather have love if
[1:35:43] my doctrine is wrong but the reality is
[1:35:45] we can have both and every Christian
[1:35:48] should have both you know Paul yeah yeah
[1:35:50] you know Peter had both later let's go
[1:35:52] get another one yeah here's the
[1:35:53] scripture where he says a new
[1:35:55] commandment Jesus says I give unto you
[1:35:56] that ye love one another as I have loved
[1:35:58] you that ye also love one another by
[1:36:01] this shall all men know that ye are my
[1:36:02] disciples if you have love one to
[1:36:05] another now
[1:36:08] Peter had the right doctrine because
[1:36:09] look the Bible says after Peter baptized
[1:36:12] some of them they continued in the
[1:36:14] Apostles doctrine their teaching from
[1:36:18] the Word of God and here the after he
[1:36:22] was arrested these Jews are charging him
[1:36:24] and said did we not command you not to
[1:36:26] teach in his name and behold you filled
[1:36:29] Jerusalem with your doctrine and intend
[1:36:31] to bring this man's blood upon us see
[1:36:34] you can't set you can't separate
[1:36:35] doctrine and love a real Christian who's
[1:36:38] got the real love of God abides in love
[1:36:40] and then abides in the true doctrine of
[1:36:43] Christ alright let me go a few more
[1:36:52] minutes here by God's grace now Lord
[1:36:59] willing I'll be going a little bit more
[1:37:01] deeper on these but I just want to read
[1:37:02] these two so you're aware secondly the
[1:37:06] tape church movement promotes blind
[1:37:08] faith in every word of brother Branham
[1:37:10] and these are exact quotes I have the
[1:37:12] recordings and the dates on most of
[1:37:15] these sermons that were preached their
[1:37:17] church says we don't care what it says
[1:37:19] on them tapes we believe it I don't have
[1:37:22] to explain it I don't have to understand
[1:37:23] it I just have to believe it we don't
[1:37:25] know what the truth is unless you listen
[1:37:28] to the tapes that's so different from
[1:37:30] the Bible because the Bible Jesus said
[1:37:31] the Bible is truth right they say we
[1:37:35] don't care that's what they're they're
[1:37:38] pastors and leaders say we don't care
[1:37:40] what's on the tapes we believe it all
[1:37:42] well then you believe you need some
[1:37:44] petroleum to drink for lunch today now
[1:37:47] hey I mean I hate to say that but Church
[1:37:48] that's what that's what they're saying
[1:37:51] we don't care what it says no I do care
[1:37:54] because I got to try every spirit praise
[1:37:56] God right now we know program has the
[1:37:59] right spirit but we know he's not
[1:38:01] infallible
[1:38:02] who else would leave you know his for
[1:38:05] three children
[1:38:05] he's got three little children he leave
[1:38:07] him he leave his wife and children for
[1:38:08] months at a time to go preach around the
[1:38:09] world fast and and get so weak till you
[1:38:12] lose weight in a 120-pound man and
[1:38:15] prayed pray all night sometimes for
[1:38:17] people just all night these three
[1:38:19] Hollywood preachers today don't do that
[1:38:21] they don't have the honesty and the
[1:38:23] sincerity like the prophet of Godhead
[1:38:27] see so we're not questioning about an
[1:38:29] sincerity we know he's sincere but we
[1:38:31] know not every word he says is thus
[1:38:34] saith the Lord and we don't want to miss
[1:38:38] understand what he says right like how
[1:38:42] easy would it be for us in a small
[1:38:44] church like us how easy would it be for
[1:38:46] us to say anyone that says God is two or
[1:38:48] three persons are there lost and going
[1:38:50] to hell that would be really easy for in
[1:38:51] a church like ours our size and we could
[1:38:54] put that attitude and that'd be the
[1:38:55] wrong attitude now we we what a
[1:38:58] misunderstood the quote I believe
[1:39:01] because I believe he's saying the same
[1:39:03] thing Peter had Peter had the revelation
[1:39:05] of it Jesus was the Christ and so he
[1:39:07] that he was saved but see we do care
[1:39:11] what's said on the tape we do but they
[1:39:16] don't care what's on the tape and I
[1:39:19] could play that for like I said I've
[1:39:20] saved them and I saved them on my hard
[1:39:22] drive and on the cloud in case my hard
[1:39:23] drive goes out and I got a external hard
[1:39:25] drive to back it up so I got three
[1:39:26] copies now I read this earlier but see
[1:39:31] buh-bam says those who can accept the
[1:39:33] word in its fullness not me because not
[1:39:36] me preaching it but because the Bible
[1:39:38] says so see program's totally opposite
[1:39:41] of what they're saying they're saying I
[1:39:42] don't care what it says believe
[1:39:43] everything on the tape but I saying no
[1:39:45] don't believe me just because I said it
[1:39:47] believe it because it's in the word
[1:39:50] number three this church their church
[1:39:53] says the token is both the tapes and
[1:39:55] being a tape Church so they made the
[1:39:58] token two different things when it's
[1:39:59] neither of those these are exact quote
[1:40:02] they the preachers got to catch the
[1:40:04] vision you got to play the tapes you got
[1:40:06] to there the token the tapes of the
[1:40:10] token so the token is actually right now
[1:40:13] on my phone then if that's the case the
[1:40:14] holy ghost bat is only ghost my phone's
[1:40:16] baptized with the Holy Ghost I just
[1:40:17] caught it right there that's what they
[1:40:19] said the tapes are the token they're the
[1:40:23] token for the bank how come my phone had
[1:40:26] the Holy Ghost and not my children yeah
[1:40:27] how's that possible see how foolish that
[1:40:32] is they say
[1:40:34] Rahab had to show her token she said I'm
[1:40:36] a tape Church that's the token
[1:40:40] I'd say it's real important to say that
[1:40:42] we're a taped Church so they take a few
[1:40:45] quotes from the token message and in
[1:40:47] September of 63 and they make it sound
[1:40:50] like when when Rahab threw out the red
[1:40:52] scarlet Corps that that was the taste
[1:40:54] but that wasn't that was the blood of
[1:40:57] Christ amen
[1:40:58] which we know the blood of Christ today
[1:41:01] the life in the blood is the Holy Spirit
[1:41:04] see that's what they get that's that's
[1:41:07] see there perhaps or leadership they
[1:41:09] listen to tapes and that's what they get
[1:41:11] but we listen to tape and we get the
[1:41:13] right doctrine amen so what do we need
[1:41:15] the right spirit and that's why I made
[1:41:17] the video i'ma let you guys watch it to
[1:41:19] when I get that video done for the the
[1:41:20] sons of brother RAM I'll let you watch
[1:41:22] it I try to say brothers I try to say it
[1:41:24] Jose I said precious brothers I hope you
[1:41:28] understand I tried to humble myself I
[1:41:30] said I could be wrong
[1:41:31] I said correct me if I'm wrong I try to
[1:41:34] be real gentle I recorded it yesterday
[1:41:37] I'm not trying to exalt myself we got to
[1:41:40] have the right the only way they'll know
[1:41:42] we're Christians is if we love each
[1:41:43] other praise God it's the only way we'll
[1:41:45] know they'll know rather we'll know
[1:41:49] because we got the right doctrine and
[1:41:50] the love but they don't know the world
[1:41:53] will know because we love each other so
[1:41:55] much like I chaired with a little
[1:42:04] example with my family last week last
[1:42:05] week we went to Panera one day and so
[1:42:07] amen and who I'm gonna just give you
[1:42:08] guys little rose for a minute here we
[1:42:10] went to Panera enough the two old women
[1:42:12] sat across from us and we started
[1:42:14] talking to me in front of the children
[1:42:16] kind of making fun of our family size
[1:42:18] and I just tried to smile and say I just
[1:42:24] try to smile on what I say said oh
[1:42:25] they're all blessings that it's all good
[1:42:27] by God's grace children might remember
[1:42:29] it and we were all you know my wife and
[1:42:31] I I was a little down you know why these
[1:42:33] demons got a why they got a torment us
[1:42:37] for having probe a in the Bible where
[1:42:40] does the Bible ever say limit your
[1:42:42] children
[1:42:42] it doesn't now doesn't say race either
[1:42:45] we're not trying to race but
[1:42:48] whereas the Bible say it's okay to have
[1:42:49] a surgery when you when you get enough
[1:42:52] kids and you you don't want anymore
[1:42:53] it's not about how many you want it's
[1:42:55] how many God wants to send ya all these
[1:43:00] people to say oh yeah God told me I'm
[1:43:01] done it - God told me - I'm done it
[1:43:02] three God told me I'd done it four and
[1:43:05] yet you ask him about doctrine so
[1:43:06] apparently they can hear the word of God
[1:43:07] about their number children but they
[1:43:09] can't hear the doctrine about how they
[1:43:10] should dress and how they should do
[1:43:12] their hair strange isn't it and the
[1:43:15] Bible says exactly what they should do
[1:43:16] with their hair and what their doctor
[1:43:18] huh oh so you can hear God's voice so
[1:43:20] clearly there but you can't hear with
[1:43:21] your other it's a hypocritical thing
[1:43:24] Church many times and I'm not trying to
[1:43:26] you know exalt myself or Pat myself on
[1:43:28] the back I'm just trying to be honest
[1:43:29] what is the word of God say anyways two
[1:43:33] days later
[1:43:34] Amen and hooah we went out to eat and
[1:43:36] and they told us what a nice family we
[1:43:38] were and all the peace and we treat us
[1:43:40] so nicely last Sunday remember that you
[1:43:41] guys remember that I just hope my wife
[1:43:43] afterwards I was so happy you know the
[1:43:44] children were so happy fellowship with
[1:43:46] Wendy and Amen and hula and I wish we
[1:43:48] could fellowship more often with
[1:43:49] everybody you know I thought my two days
[1:43:51] after just being made fun of we get
[1:43:53] treated so good see cuz Christians will
[1:43:55] know each other by their love I thought
[1:43:58] what a good example
[1:43:59] we're mocked one day a couple of days
[1:44:02] later we're blessed I took the children
[1:44:05] yesterday to get the van fixed and one
[1:44:07] of the black real nice black guy come
[1:44:09] out he said I just want to tell you
[1:44:11] don't know if the Turner silence he said
[1:44:12] but your children are the best children
[1:44:13] I've ever seen behaved since I've been
[1:44:15] here so I didn't tell the children that
[1:44:18] but you know I said well I said give all
[1:44:22] the credit to two people I said God and
[1:44:23] my wife he's like that's a good thing to
[1:44:28] say you sir
[1:44:29] real nice guy but see it's love it's
[1:44:34] love so I just thought I'd share
[1:44:38] cuz you know we get attacked we get you
[1:44:40] know a little made fun of little little
[1:44:41] little things but God has a way for his
[1:44:44] love to shine out through us like when I
[1:44:47] remember when Naomi sent me the birthday
[1:44:49] song for was it Harris's birthday and
[1:44:51] all the girls they just saw they'd have
[1:44:53] it that's love they felt the love right
[1:44:56] when the walkers come and visit we feel
[1:44:58] the love right Christians love one
[1:45:01] another praise God
[1:45:03] so see we got the right doctrine and the
[1:45:07] right spirit and I kind of went to sit
[1:45:09] went through a lot of different things
[1:45:11] to get to that point but I hope you
[1:45:12] understand him so see now this is what
[1:45:15] they say the being of a sermon one time
[1:45:16] I like to welcome everybody to the lines
[1:45:18] then they're calling their church the
[1:45:19] lines in now I would never want to say
[1:45:21] that that shows you what shows you like
[1:45:24] how deceived they are like these are
[1:45:26] just going over their heads the pastor
[1:45:28] said welcome to the lion's den where we
[1:45:30] say it's the word which is the tapes or
[1:45:32] nothing so they put the tapes of William
[1:45:36] Randall on the same level as the Bible
[1:45:37] which we don't do that no we put the
[1:45:41] Bible above everything and then when we
[1:45:42] hear about Graham say something on tape
[1:45:44] we go back to the Word of God right like
[1:45:49] it if we had all the words of st. Paul
[1:45:51] we would never put all of st. Paul's
[1:45:52] words on equal footing we put all of st.
[1:45:54] Paul's words under now he had the
[1:45:56] privilege of writing the Bible so some
[1:45:58] of his words are the Bible okay some of
[1:46:01] it but all his common words just talking
[1:46:03] and you know sharing testimonies
[1:46:04] speaking of his common words we would
[1:46:09] never exalt them to equal we would say
[1:46:11] the Word of God is above every every
[1:46:14] thought of every person of every prophet
[1:46:16] right now to give them
[1:46:21] there they were mentioning Amos 3:7
[1:46:23] where the Bible said the Prophet this
[1:46:27] God does nothing but he reveals a secret
[1:46:28] to the servants the prophets because a
[1:46:30] lions roaring but still why would you
[1:46:33] ever place yourself calling yourself the
[1:46:35] Lions Den who's the Lions then either
[1:46:40] that means either the church is full of
[1:46:42] prophets right or brother Branham was
[1:46:45] the was the true Daniel and everybody
[1:46:46] else in the church is lions you see what
[1:46:50] you see what you do there it just
[1:46:51] doesn't fit the types right just like
[1:46:54] the type of Joseph brother have son
[1:46:57] being the Joseph of the Old Testament
[1:46:59] where they say Joseph was feeding
[1:47:02] everybody who was starving like they
[1:47:05] said the bride is starving that's what
[1:47:07] they're saying the the bride's starving
[1:47:08] but Joseph's wife was never starving
[1:47:11] Joseph's wife was with him in the palace
[1:47:13] praise God it doesn't fit the type it's
[1:47:17] just misinterpreted right
[1:47:19] it's a misinterpretation so that to me
[1:47:23] is a misinterpretation I'm almost done
[1:47:25] here this is one I mentioned on
[1:47:27] Wednesday they make a Joseph Branham a
[1:47:29] prophet without proof now here's a quote
[1:47:32] you should understand when I dedicated
[1:47:34] him his youngest son Joseph to the Lord
[1:47:36] the morning there was many little baby
[1:47:38] standing up and had mothers with them
[1:47:39] along the altar when I picked up Joseph
[1:47:41] in my arms not thinking what I was
[1:47:43] saying I said Joseph my son thou art a
[1:47:45] prophet that's my prayer anyhow
[1:47:48] does that sound like his thus saith the
[1:47:49] Lord no that's my prayer anyhow if
[1:47:53] you've got a thus saith the Lord it's
[1:47:55] not anyhow and I believe it'll be
[1:47:59] someday God will take everything he ever
[1:48:01] gave me and double it times double and
[1:48:05] put on that boy and then leave and sorry
[1:48:09] when then when I leave he'll take my
[1:48:11] place now Joseph is 65 years old he
[1:48:15] better get goin fast if he's gonna
[1:48:16] double times double everything by the
[1:48:18] ran did he bet it now it's possible it's
[1:48:20] possible but he better go like I told
[1:48:23] that brother I said you let me know when
[1:48:24] he starts doing prayer lines double the
[1:48:26] brother and because I want to become and
[1:48:27] be part of it and he said oh no you got
[1:48:31] the wrong understanding I said I'm just
[1:48:33] saying what the tapes say hey
[1:48:35] now look what he says now he says this
[1:48:37] was earlier he said Rebecca might take
[1:48:39] his place someday which we know she did
[1:48:41] it she never preached he never had
[1:48:42] prayer lines you know George Smith was
[1:48:44] her husband Hina they never had prayer
[1:48:47] lines you know like where she was
[1:48:49] discerning people taking brother Ana's
[1:48:51] place that never happened but brother
[1:48:53] man hoped it would he said maybe he said
[1:48:57] all night long I couldn't get that
[1:48:58] possum off my mind the next morning I
[1:49:00] went out as I started out little Rebekah
[1:49:02] who I believe is maybe or going to maybe
[1:49:04] take my place someday did she know she
[1:49:08] didn't take mother's place praying for
[1:49:11] the sick and prayer lines and
[1:49:13] discernment she's seen her first vision
[1:49:15] recent just recently and she's very
[1:49:19] tender hard little thing when I went out
[1:49:21] to that porch about seven o'clock the
[1:49:22] Sun was rising to see if there's anybody
[1:49:24] out there there was not and the first
[1:49:25] thing you know about my side was little
[1:49:27] Rebekah she said daddy what about the
[1:49:28] old possum I just dreamed of her all
[1:49:30] night now she might have had a dream it
[1:49:32] looks like she had a dream about the
[1:49:33] opossum but did she ever do prayer lines
[1:49:35] and started discerning like brother
[1:49:37] Branham did with the visions no it never
[1:49:40] happened you can ask her husband widower
[1:49:43] he's alive today you can ask him he said
[1:49:47] maybe see he maybe was hoping Joseph
[1:49:51] would take his place to continue their
[1:49:52] ministry he was hoping maybe maybe
[1:49:55] Rebecca will take my place someday I
[1:49:57] hope so now look he tells again about
[1:50:02] dedicating Joseph and dedication that
[1:50:04] little boy at the altar I said I was
[1:50:05] inspired to say Joseph thou art God's
[1:50:08] prophet and maybe look again maybe when
[1:50:12] I leave I pray that a double portion of
[1:50:16] the Spirit will come upon Joseph for the
[1:50:17] age to come if there is one maybe see he
[1:50:24] thinks it's the Holy Spirit right he
[1:50:28] thinks it's the Holy Spirit like I've
[1:50:32] thought I thought the Holy Spirit maybe
[1:50:33] heard some of our prayers sometimes I
[1:50:35] thought for sure we were gonna see a
[1:50:36] instant miracle and maybe I didn't I
[1:50:39] mean I can't recall specific one but I
[1:50:41] know there's times I felt like my God
[1:50:43] heard our prayers and even though I just
[1:50:47] because I felt it was the Holy
[1:50:48] fear doesn't mean that it was see just
[1:50:52] cuz program felt maybe he was inspired
[1:50:54] memory said I was inspired to say 77 to
[1:50:56] remember that he said with divine
[1:50:58] inspiration I believe the world systems
[1:51:00] will end by 1977 see he's just trying to
[1:51:04] be he's just trying to find the will of
[1:51:05] God he just tried to understand God's
[1:51:08] will for his life and his son's life
[1:51:12] last one I think yeah that's the last
[1:51:14] one I think oh my yeah here's what they
[1:51:21] say they make a tape Church mandate they
[1:51:25] say every Church in this message if you
[1:51:27] claim to believe this message one or not
[1:51:29] one it or not you're a tape Church if
[1:51:32] you believe this message you're a tape
[1:51:34] Church it's just the way it is there's
[1:51:39] men of God that have true callings of
[1:51:40] God on their lives they preach this
[1:51:42] message with all their heart but they
[1:51:43] got to catch the vision you got to play
[1:51:46] the tapes
[1:51:46] you got to Amen they're the token okay
[1:51:51] now remember I don't have the caught up
[1:51:53] here but their pastor called anyone who
[1:51:56] was wondering about should I preach or
[1:51:57] play tapes
[1:51:58] he called him a make believer so that
[1:52:01] classifies us if we've ever wondered now
[1:52:04] I don't wonder about it but if we ever
[1:52:05] did wonder well should we play tapes or
[1:52:08] let the pastor preach he said if you're
[1:52:10] wondering you're a make believer you're
[1:52:12] not a true believer now let's just show
[1:52:16] our love here okay that's a sure love
[1:52:19] but someone calls you a name how quickly
[1:52:21] do you want to call them a name back
[1:52:22] well love should stop us from doing that
[1:52:25] so they're gonna call us make believers
[1:52:28] well that's it s why sure hope they're
[1:52:30] real believers by God's grace can you
[1:52:32] say that with love in your heart I can
[1:52:34] I sure hope and I say that's why I send
[1:52:36] the video I sure hope you guys can
[1:52:37] repent and see the truth then not every
[1:52:40] word your dad said was the state the
[1:52:42] Lord try to do it with love now there's
[1:52:47] only two quotes on tape churches right
[1:52:50] there's this big emphasis we need to
[1:52:52] everyone needs to be taped churches did
[1:52:54] you know there's only two quotes on it
[1:52:55] and brother Graham gives he gives it
[1:52:58] okay under two conditions
[1:53:00] there's no preacher
[1:53:02] and there's no church where you live
[1:53:04] those are the only conditions of having
[1:53:06] to take Church brother branham we have
[1:53:09] no preacher where we live but we have
[1:53:11] tape service on Sunday night only should
[1:53:13] we take our children to another church
[1:53:14] for Sunday school or the tape service is
[1:53:17] sufficient well let that be according
[1:53:18] the way your children are going now if
[1:53:19] you get your children they're young and
[1:53:21] you get them out in some kind of a group
[1:53:23] out there they'll just pound that stuff
[1:53:24] into them they shouldn't no I wouldn't
[1:53:26] do it if they seem to learn enough for
[1:53:28] the tapes and things and you say you put
[1:53:30] them over in the Catholic Church take
[1:53:31] them over to Catholic Church take them
[1:53:33] to something like that I wouldn't advise
[1:53:35] that but now if you got a nice little
[1:53:37] Church over there that maybe disagree
[1:53:39] two or three things with you and your
[1:53:41] children wants to go to Sunday school
[1:53:42] there full gospel people or something
[1:53:44] well that's perfectly all right but see
[1:53:46] when you got I'm sorry when you come to
[1:53:48] a place depends on how your children
[1:53:50] take it see watch what your children
[1:53:52] does how they react to it now here's the
[1:53:57] quota this is the one I was listening
[1:53:58] this morning Bob Arum said I am so
[1:54:01] misunderstood I don't know why people
[1:54:02] think I don't even believe the people
[1:54:04] going to church that's a million miles
[1:54:06] from the truth we must assemble
[1:54:07] ourselves together that much more as we
[1:54:09] see the Day approaching if I lived in a
[1:54:13] city and there nothing there but well
[1:54:15] some church I don't want to call a name
[1:54:16] with just any church if they only
[1:54:18] believe one thing that Jesus was divine
[1:54:21] all the rest of it was wrong I'd go to
[1:54:24] that church did you catch that if the
[1:54:29] church is ninety-nine percent wrong but
[1:54:31] they got one thing right I'd still go to
[1:54:33] that church see his example wasn't to
[1:54:37] sit at home and play tapes of his own
[1:54:38] tapes he said if I can't get a hold off
[1:54:42] I'll take a slice hey yeah see I'll go
[1:54:46] listen well I didn't say I'll go take my
[1:54:49] tapes to be played
[1:54:51] I'll go listen worship the Lord and show
[1:54:55] them that I'm doing my part to glad
[1:54:57] church you are showing God you're doing
[1:54:59] your part this morning you're gathering
[1:55:01] together more as you see that day
[1:55:03] approach you're not sitting at home or
[1:55:05] sitting at the bar waiting for the big
[1:55:06] football games today or the basketball
[1:55:08] games you're not there you're doing your
[1:55:10] part you're supporting the kingdom of
[1:55:12] God you're seeking first the kingdom of
[1:55:14] God in His righteousness
[1:55:16] I want him to know I'm alive huh so your
[1:55:21] attitude towards church shows God that
[1:55:23] you're alive I want everybody to know
[1:55:26] what side I'm on
[1:55:27] I assemble with the Christians and then
[1:55:28] worship and serve the Lord I'm a host
[1:55:32] then you've been a good audience bear
[1:55:34] with me oh this is just it's a harder
[1:55:36] kind of a message I know I know but I
[1:55:40] know it's helpful Church it's helpful to
[1:55:41] me yeah I know it's helpful to you too
[1:55:44] now brother have said see it's so it's
[1:55:47] used to bother me so bad I found out
[1:55:49] even our Lord was misunderstood in so
[1:55:51] many things I guess it just has to be
[1:55:54] that way like this but those who are
[1:55:56] wise will understand it the Bible said
[1:55:59] so they'll catch it man
[1:56:03] the lies where you will hear the word
[1:56:05] and believe it praise God they'll make
[1:56:07] their selves ready for the rapture see
[1:56:10] people that like I said on Wednesday
[1:56:12] anyone who desires truth anyone that's
[1:56:14] thirsty whosoever will let him come
[1:56:16] there's nothing God will not let
[1:56:18] anything stop them from hearing the
[1:56:19] truth if they really want to go in the
[1:56:21] rapture they're gonna go in the rapture
[1:56:22] I don't care what country they're in I
[1:56:24] don't care where they're from if they've
[1:56:26] got a deep call there's got to be a deep
[1:56:28] to respond amen
[1:56:29] remember the wrap dress that be of every
[1:56:31] nation all nations there's to be some
[1:56:35] believer that has to make that rapture
[1:56:38] how do you know because a revelation 7
[1:56:40] says there's a Gentile multitude the Bob
[1:56:42] said of all nations kid drugs tons and
[1:56:44] people waving the palms and falling down
[1:56:46] and worshiping Jesus and they wash their
[1:56:48] robes right in the blood of Christ amen
[1:56:53] oh don't worry about the wise the wise
[1:56:55] will catch it in anybody who wants
[1:56:57] somebody be there they'll be there now
[1:57:01] here's the other one where he says it's
[1:57:03] okay to play tapes let's see if you
[1:57:06] don't have a church to go to should you
[1:57:09] just listen to the tapes
[1:57:10] yes that's that'd be fine that's all he
[1:57:12] says so there's two conditions that do
[1:57:15] take churches no preachers and no church
[1:57:18] well we've got both here so well I don't
[1:57:20] have to play the tapes
[1:57:21] praise God we don't have to we meet all
[1:57:27] the conditions praise God
[1:57:29] so see there's only two and see though
[1:57:31] they take these and they take take them
[1:57:33] way too far
[1:57:34] can everybody see how they're going off
[1:57:36] to these huge extremes it's got a couple
[1:57:43] more here here's what they say many
[1:57:46] critics without revelation say brother
[1:57:48] Brown never said play tapes in the
[1:57:50] church and here's where they were
[1:57:50] misinterpreting another scripture that's
[1:57:53] called ears but can't hear so now
[1:57:55] they're name-calling us again
[1:57:56] now we rise a ax 6 where it says they
[1:57:58] have eyes but can't see and ears that
[1:58:01] can't hear did you catch that in other
[1:58:04] words they're saying we're spiritually
[1:58:05] blind we're spiritually brought blind
[1:58:08] because we say oh brother I've never
[1:58:10] said play the tapes in the church others
[1:58:12] say we just believe the Bible and don't
[1:58:14] say in the Bible either well I've got
[1:58:15] news for both of you it does say in the
[1:58:18] Bible Jesus himself said play tapes in
[1:58:20] your local churches now go to revelation
[1:58:22] 22:16 this is what their pastor preaches
[1:58:25] in church they are adding to the word
[1:58:28] and that's why I pray for them to repent
[1:58:31] with the right spirit they said Jesus
[1:58:36] and you should hear the people clap they
[1:58:37] haven't even heard the scripture the
[1:58:39] pastor's gonna use and they already
[1:58:40] started screaming in clap but he's gotta
[1:58:42] say okay take a seat okay because they
[1:58:43] give him a standing ovation every time
[1:58:44] you said something about tapes how tapes
[1:58:47] and not preachers tapes enough and they
[1:58:49] just all stand in clapping they say okay
[1:58:50] so that's an answer because it's a
[1:58:52] spirit rotation 22:16 I Jesus have sent
[1:58:57] mine angel to testify unto you these
[1:58:59] things in the churches I am the root and
[1:59:02] offspring of David and the bright and
[1:59:04] Morning Star did you see anything in
[1:59:06] there about playing tapes in the
[1:59:07] churches that's what they teach they say
[1:59:10] that scripture says preachers need to
[1:59:12] stop preaching and only play the tapes
[1:59:15] he says there it is right there in the
[1:59:17] word see what those churches are says
[1:59:20] local churches now he's using a Scofield
[1:59:23] Bible there because the word churches if
[1:59:26] you look in your Scofield Bible it says
[1:59:27] local yeah but that's just Scofield
[1:59:30] opinion that's not what the Greek says
[1:59:33] he sent his angel to preach and the
[1:59:36] churches and the only way can do that is
[1:59:38] by pressing play playing this message
[1:59:41] this is the will the Lord look.we says
[1:59:43] it's the perfect will the Lord stay with
[1:59:46] this word now that's quite a statement
[1:59:48] and he's and that pastor says twice I've
[1:59:52] got it on tape he said thus saith the
[1:59:54] Holy Spirit he said thus saith the Lord
[1:59:56] he said playing tapes is the perfect
[1:59:58] will of God now that's quite a statement
[2:00:00] right there that means we are if he's
[2:00:04] right we're in the permissive will of
[2:00:05] God by having preachers come and by
[2:00:06] having a pastor preach do you think
[2:00:09] you're in the permissive will of God no
[2:00:10] I think I'm in the perfect will of God
[2:00:13] how do you know because my life
[2:00:15] matches Paul's gospel amen their life
[2:00:19] does not because brother man because
[2:00:22] brother am his own father taught they
[2:00:26] said if you are not saying what Paul
[2:00:28] said therefore you are false
[2:00:30] anyone who changes what Paul said is
[2:00:32] false and as a liar and that's hard
[2:00:35] we've got to say in love let's say into
[2:00:38] our feet he said you will know the
[2:00:41] prophet of the last days yes you will
[2:00:43] for he is of God and he will be in that
[2:00:45] word exactly as God gave it to Paul he
[2:00:50] won't deviate it deviate from it that
[2:00:53] word for a moment not by one iota he
[2:00:57] said the last day prophet will be saying
[2:00:59] get back to the word or you are lost
[2:01:02] is that scriptural absolutely
[2:01:05] Paul said preach the word in all seasons
[2:01:09] feeling happy preach the word feeling
[2:01:13] discouraged preach the word feel like
[2:01:16] the other revival preach the word
[2:01:18] feeling a million miles from the revival
[2:01:21] preach the word anyway amen
[2:01:24] Paul said preached the Lord in season
[2:01:27] out of season and it will accomplish all
[2:01:29] this determined to do can you say Amen
[2:01:32] to that church musicians if you'll come
[2:01:35] to change one word is to be a false
[2:01:39] teacher of God's Word
[2:01:45] now I have a little bit more to go I've
[2:01:48] got two more false doctrines I want to
[2:01:49] show from that camp maybe a few more and
[2:01:52] then I want to go over to the other side
[2:01:55] so this is the camp that goes into
[2:01:57] idolatry of brother Branham the other
[2:01:59] camp rejects all programs teachings and
[2:02:01] there are going to the side of lust
[2:02:04] because you can see it in their lives
[2:02:06] after they leave the message they open
[2:02:07] up the door to immoral close in more
[2:02:09] lifestyle drinking smoking movies and
[2:02:11] all kinds of evil so where are we Church
[2:02:15] we're standing right in the middle
[2:02:16] holding God's standard waving God's
[2:02:19] standard praise God that this is a real
[2:02:21] this is the undefiled life praise God
[2:02:24] this is how a believer lives not out
[2:02:26] there in idolatry that out their lust
[2:02:28] but they live their life and
[2:02:30] righteousness aren't you glad for that
[2:02:33] please God thank the Lord

[2:03:54] be between between Jesus and the
[2:03:55] denomination and Jesus is the word your
[2:04:01] prophet also taught that in the last
[2:04:03] days like the days of the three Hebrew
[2:04:05] children a man will be exalted as an
[2:04:08] idol tempting the people of God to bow
[2:04:11] down in worship that man Lord we're not
