[0:24] praise God worse can do it Bible study
[0:27] tonight brother Jose it's nice to see
[0:28] you sir it's the start of the school
[0:31] year how some boats gotta get a lot of
[0:32] stress at the start of the school year
[0:34] and so if we do a whole service that
[0:38] means extra singing on my voice and so I
[0:40] lose my voice really quick I'm preaching
[0:44] really loud and overly emotional you
[0:45] lose my voice not fast and it's really
[0:48] hard for me to teach the next day you
[0:50] know my day at school
[0:51] thankfully we got tomorrow off so we
[0:52] have actually day to recover but most
[0:55] Monday's we don't have I'd like to just
[0:58] do some Iowa Studies with the children
[1:00] you know and even adults that they have
[1:02] any question that it's like do some
[1:04] Bible studies to take them through the
[1:06] scriptures my wife and I were talking
[1:08] about when we first came the message
[1:10] brother Craig was there and he just made
[1:12] himself fully available to sit down and
[1:15] take us through any topic in the
[1:17] scripture that was some of the most
[1:18] important times because we got our
[1:20] founding right in the scripture for
[1:25] example you know we're just to say like
[1:27] we our foundation was in the word first
[1:29] not some people do clothes first which
[1:32] is it's different however however you
[1:34] come to God is wonderful however you
[1:35] come but we were taught the word first
[1:38] and then once we did the word then we
[1:40] would list another brand of it see what
[1:42] he said so we felt that was a great
[1:45] foundation for us we're very thankful
[1:46] for that so to save a little bit of
[1:50] energy
[1:50] and to do some teaching with the
[1:53] children we wanted to do some Bible
[1:55] studies brother Branham said you know
[1:57] we're gonna be put a church but we need
[1:58] to get down to the Holy Ghost so the
[2:00] most important thing is to teach in
[2:01] justification significations baptism
[2:03] holding those programs that that was my
[2:06] message he sent my message of
[2:07] justification sanctification
[2:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost so I want to
[2:11] do a little Bible study on safe
[2:13] vacation today and I just hit a few
[2:15] scriptures and I got some visuals just
[2:18] to show the children here will I like to
[2:24] just start with the word of Prayer so
[2:57] let's look at sanctification I want to
[2:59] look at it at the angle that the prophet
[3:01] taught it with growing up into the
[3:04] virtues of God or look at at that angle
[3:07] so pretty gonna be familiar with that
[3:08] and anytime you have a question girls
[3:10] you can raise your hand any time even
[3:13] adults if you have any questions let's
[3:15] talk thanks that brother BAE so the man
[3:17] if you were your wife have any questions
[3:19] about sanctification anytime you know
[3:20] just wanna you know raise your hand
[3:23] we'll try to answer the best we camp on
[3:24] the scripture we can even search quotes
[3:27] to I think I could even yeah I can
[3:29] switch easily over to quotes and look up
[3:31] quotes we just find the key words let's
[3:39] start off with what is sanctification so
[3:41] I want to start with that and then we'll
[3:43] look at some scriptures about
[3:45] sanctification so you can see in the
[3:48] italicized words back there such an AV
[3:51] off right authorized version the word
[3:54] sanctification is also used holiness
[3:55] five times and sanctification five times
[3:58] of the King James Version and so those
[4:01] are the two means their consecration
[4:06] purification and sanctification of heart
[4:10] and life so the purifying of your life
[4:13] okay by God's standard we think it's
[4:17] really important to have a purified life
[4:19] yeah Esther says yes yes yeah it's very
[4:23] important to have a purified life that
[4:25] means pure
[4:26] all sin pure from all evil habits I
[4:30] remember a few months ago I was
[4:32] preaching on the Holy Ghost series and
[4:35] your mommy sister Kristin 78 or send me
[4:39] an email afterwards and I preached a
[4:42] message on laboring for the Holy Ghost
[4:43] and sister Kristin 70 nice to email
[4:45] saying that was a wonderful industry for
[4:48] our service because brother branham said
[4:51] sanctification is like labor it's hard
[4:53] work everybody know what hard work is
[4:56] where you feel like you're tired
[4:58] everything being tired sometimes
[5:02] sanctification is tiring because you're
[5:05] trying to overcome you trying to work
[5:06] really hard to let God flow through your
[5:08] life so can we take a deep breath in
[5:13] sometimes in sanctification you got to
[5:15] reflect yourself and keep fighting keep
[5:20] battling in order to have the right kind
[5:22] of behaviors like obedience to the Holy
[5:24] Spirit so I wanted to say this to
[5:26] sanctification is the will of God before
[5:29] you receive the Holy Ghost and after so
[5:33] we know it actually never edits but
[5:36] there's a certain level of
[5:37] sanctification ee before God will fill
[5:39] you with the Holy Spirit and his Spirit
[5:42] will guide you into that so let's read
[5:44] these scriptures so I have Lydia Malachi
[5:46] know they can read right away acacia
[5:47] Liddy why don't you get 17 17 Malachi
[5:53] first ISIL needs fourth I'll help you
[5:55] verses 1 through 8 in acacia you have
[5:58] verse nestlings 523 I can help you with
[6:00] that
[6:01] solonius actually like that this morning
[6:14] a little bit when we preached on that so
[6:19] as we said it's the will of God before
[6:21] so the first one is that Jesus is
[6:23] praying for the disciples and this is
[6:26] before he died so he was still like that
[6:28] before he was crucified and one of his
[6:30] last prayers for them is that God would
[6:32] sanctify them they'd already been with
[6:34] him three half years they saw miracle
[6:37] after miracle after miracle but still
[6:39] haven't received the Holy Ghost so it's
[6:42] important that no matter how many
[6:43] miracles we see no matter how much
[6:46] ministry we do we want to make sure we
[6:48] have the power in life that the Holy
[6:50] Spirit gives us which Paul said is
[6:53] Christ in you reject want to see Christ
[6:55] living in u.s. see Christ amen
[6:58] I don't see Christ living through me
[6:59] Jesse Smith but I don't think Jesus
[7:02] Christ lived through me so let it read
[7:05] John 17:17 thank you just a minute here
[7:12] I know mothers can't hear I used this
[7:17] I'm Lydia can you read that again like
[7:21] the mothers here thank you
[7:27] so Jesus learned his last prayers he's
[7:30] praying for his disciples his father
[7:31] will you sanctify them will you purify
[7:35] them even more through your truth
[7:37] through the word so here's how we get
[7:40] purified right here through the Word of
[7:41] God
[7:42] okay so Malachi 1st Thessalonians 4 1
[7:47] through 8 I should have been coldness
[7:48] the whole time because I don't think I
[7:50] don't think they can hear in there
[7:50] unless I really hold this so make sure
[7:53] you gotta hold this the whole time so
[7:54] let me turn there 1st Thessalonians 4
[7:56] verse 1 verse 4 okay summary verses 1
[8:11] into an Amalekite you can read verse 3
[8:14] yeah furthermore then we beseech you
[8:17] brethren and exhort you by the Lord
[8:19] Jesus that as you have received of us
[8:21] how you ought to walk and to please God
[8:23] so you would abound more and more to see
[8:28] how we want to please God more and more
[8:29] no bag and I have been together for many
[8:32] years now since 2002 and our lives
[8:35] that's what 15 years so our life should
[8:37] have more and more pleasing God you
[8:40] shouldn't always please God less and get
[8:42] back into sin we should please him more
[8:44] and more verse 2 for ye know what
[8:48] Commandments we gave you by the Lord
[8:50] Jesus so you're not
[8:52] and you recurse hope they'll stretch
[9:01] even your sanctification you should
[9:04] abstain from fornication all right thank
[9:06] you so you never say we'll have gotten
[9:09] ready we don't love God
[9:11] it is God's perfect will we've got to be
[9:13] sanctified we've got to be cured by pure
[9:17] from evil pure from sin we got to be
[9:20] that way it's God's will God wants that
[9:23] for Esther Acacia Haman God wants it for
[9:27] all of us to be pure from sin okay I'll
[9:29] reverse for that every one of you should
[9:31] know how to possess his vessel in
[9:33] sanctification and honor not in the lust
[9:38] of concoctions even as the Gentiles
[9:42] which know not God that no man go beyond
[9:45] and defraud his brother in any manner
[9:48] because that the Lord is the Avenger of
[9:50] all such and we also have forewarned you
[9:53] and testified for God has not called us
[9:56] unto uncleanness but unto holiness God
[10:00] has called you so God's kind of like
[10:03] appeared in heaven calling you say
[10:05] Malachi Lydia can she come up here
[10:07] higher come up here to holiness holiness
[10:10] is a state of life right it's a state of
[10:13] your spiritual walk he's calling us he's
[10:16] saying to come up higher come up here
[10:18] like in our knee right further up and
[10:19] further in he's saying come up come up
[10:22] higher I'm calling you up here you don't
[10:24] you don't want to live way down there
[10:26] you know life that has sin and
[10:28] defilement you want to live in a life
[10:30] that's pure come up here he's inviting
[10:33] us up higher verse 8 he therefore that
[10:37] despiseth despiseth not man but God who
[10:40] hath also given unto us His Holy Spirit
[10:45] indication how do you feel about that
[10:47] person reprocessing five point three and
[10:49] I'll give you the mic Thank You Darla
[11:16] wonderful so Paul woods pray that God
[11:19] would sanctify us all the way in all
[11:22] three parts our bodies swords here all
[11:25] three hearts were pure the floor God
[11:27] isn't that beautiful
[11:28] so even after even before you receive
[11:32] the Holy Ghost you need sanctify and
[11:33] then after we continually need
[11:35] sanctified more purified to God's
[11:38] purpose
[11:39] welcome nature if you look up there on
[11:44] the screen brother branham talk we can
[11:46] know where we are at in God at any time
[11:49] how'd he do that
[11:50] brother I've said that he said God is
[11:53] there he's the guy who Amen he never
[11:55] changes what he does never changes he
[11:59] says it and it stands fast he does it
[12:01] and is done forever none can take away
[12:03] from what he says or add to it so let it
[12:05] be amen
[12:06] he said so let it be aren't you glad
[12:09] that you served that kind of God you
[12:11] could know exactly where you are with
[12:13] him at any time and all the time isn't
[12:18] that beautiful at any time and all the
[12:20] time you can know my pleasing to God am
[12:23] i walking with God am i being more
[12:25] sanctified you could know where you are
[12:27] with God at any time
[12:29] he is the Amen and he won't change I
[12:33] give you a few examples of this I preach
[12:36] this a few weeks ago as I was with Moses
[12:38] remember this brother Graham says he's
[12:40] ending the sermon he says that I've
[12:42] accomplished more this morning by the
[12:43] message that I've had and the things
[12:45] that I've known of I've followed the
[12:47] Commission more than I've accomplished
[12:49] in the last five years because I found
[12:51] the center of God's will this is a
[12:55] wonderful location
[12:58] brother ran in 1960 said I found the
[13:01] center of God's will because he was
[13:03] putting too much emphasis on the gifts
[13:05] and says it said of his commission of
[13:08] praying for the sick he was challenging
[13:10] people to bring up you know the hardest
[13:12] cases who's putting too much emphasis on
[13:14] the sides instead of the Commission but
[13:17] now he says I found the center of God's
[13:19] will
[13:20] now if the extremes of God's will well
[13:23] further this way or further that way but
[13:26] the center of God's will can you know
[13:27] what can you know where you are with God
[13:29] at any time sure for the bread of knew
[13:32] he said I'm right where I need to be at
[13:34] the center of God's will
[13:36] here's another one the RAM said people
[13:39] didn't love me at all nobody had any use
[13:41] for me but now by the help of God I
[13:43] believe I'm directing the bride of Jesus
[13:45] Christ he wasn't in the background with
[13:49] other people he was directing he was the
[13:52] one telling the bride members all about
[13:55] the Word of God he used a director you
[13:58] children you been to a symphony right
[14:00] and you know you can recognize the
[14:01] director right away right you should all
[14:03] one the standing up right how else can
[14:05] you tell standing up and what else does
[14:07] the director do then the pinch I've
[14:14] noticed you the director at the band
[14:16] concerts you know when I'm at school
[14:17] he'll point to certain people and it's
[14:20] their time to come in and he'll point to
[14:22] them and so from the band he knew he's
[14:24] at the center of God's will he knew was
[14:26] he was the director of God's bride of
[14:28] the whole people of God here's another
[14:31] one one time in 1965 brother Graham said
[14:34] he said Lord show me my ministry in the
[14:36] Bible and he said I closed my eyes and
[14:39] just let the Bible follow but you want
[14:41] to know where he was with God at that
[14:42] moment and guess what he found Genesis
[14:45] 24 verse 7 which was Eliezer God's I'm
[14:51] sorry Abraham's faithful servant the
[14:53] model servant of the Bible being sent to
[14:56] hunt the bride for Isaac
[14:59] he said chills run all over me
[15:02] sure that's right that's right with the
[15:05] rest of my message pulling of the bride
[15:08] so can everybody see how brother Branham
[15:10] knew where he was with God
[15:12] you think you can know where you are
[15:13] with God of course yes wonderful
[15:17] all right now remember there are three
[15:22] stages to perfection right God's got to
[15:25] take us through three stages
[15:26] remember the judgment of this slide for
[15:28] let me preach some book as it can the
[15:29] three three bodies okay man has three
[15:34] stages justification sanctification
[15:37] that's where I'm talking about today
[15:40] everything has three stages to
[15:43] perfection who knows the three bodies in
[15:46] another three bodies video okay's yeah
[15:52] closed this is speaking of the three
[15:54] bodies like terrestrial you know the
[15:57] next one
[15:58] celeste yield and glorify remember those
[16:03] three bodies everything's in threes
[16:05] right the earth goes through three
[16:08] stages until it's perfect your it goes
[16:10] through water what's next
[16:13] clubs blood and then entire that's to
[16:18] come
[16:19] the fire baptism what the birth with our
[16:22] eyes already had water blood the next is
[16:25] fire the baby when a baby's born under
[16:30] usual circumstances burst the water
[16:33] breaks then there's a bloody show and
[16:36] then at the spirit of the bait that uses
[16:39] the baby comes out in Christ you see the
[16:41] baby like the bride the Prophet talked
[16:45] went through Luther then went through
[16:48] Wesley and then the third mint messenger
[16:52] to restore the bride or bring perfection
[16:54] of the bride was the grams Mitch thought
[16:57] save the Lord prophetic ministry okay
[17:00] here's another one the gifts there's
[17:02] three gifts the Prophet said eight hope
[17:06] what's the last one
[17:09] hope and charity these three the body
[17:12] the Godhead has three stages to
[17:15] perfection who knows those father three
[17:22] stages God is always perfected
[17:25] and then the plant goes in three stages
[17:28] stalk tassel and then the green okay
[17:32] there's a lot of threes there God always
[17:35] works in threes today we're going to
[17:37] focus on the sanctification we've
[17:39] already started is it God's will for you
[17:41] to be sanctified does he want you to be
[17:43] sanctified
[17:43] yeah what's being purified so you're
[17:46] fully pure when you're fully purified
[17:48] then he can pour in his holy spirit and
[17:50] it gives you power for service right
[17:54] power for service I heard a preacher say
[17:55] this week was a really good statement he
[17:59] said the Holy Ghost gives us power for
[18:00] service they said a lot of people they
[18:02] just struggle with coming to service but
[18:06] the Holy Ghost puts you in power for our
[18:08] service other cutting priest that was
[18:10] really good wow that's wonderful
[18:13] in other words you're the one serving
[18:15] but you empowered for service let's go
[18:19] back here to our mixture on the stature
[18:22] perfect man for the random said this is
[18:26] how you go from justification
[18:28] justification is faith will show that a
[18:30] little bit and you work your way up to
[18:33] love or the Holy Ghost here's another
[18:36] picture which you have the church age is
[18:38] on the side or your next few years I
[18:40] want to go through this kind of slowly
[18:43] well make sure this live I just want to
[18:45] review up again it's more about twenty
[18:50] minutes into the study so we're doing
[18:51] pretty good on top okay so let's turn to
[18:55] second Peter chapter one it's in the
[18:57] back of the New Testament and at the end
[19:00] of it any questions yet so far anybody
[19:02] have any questions them huh
[19:03] any questions we sure appreciate your
[19:06] questions 2nd Peter chapter 1 let's read
[19:10] that 2nd Peter chapter 1 did you know
[19:23] brother Branham said when that love
[19:25] comes down so that they can try and go
[19:27] the capstone he said that makes you a
[19:29] spiritual powerhouse so you have a power
[19:32] against Satan when you're born again of
[19:34] the love of God in other words you have
[19:37] power to fight the
[19:39] really beat them down because you got on
[19:42] the full armor of God now back to the
[19:44] Holy Ghost gives you access to the full
[19:46] armor of God we'll talk about that at
[19:48] the end as well okay let's have some
[19:51] readers here I think it's good for the
[19:52] live stream as well
[19:54] Lydia can you read verse five and they
[19:56] wept case you read verse six here one
[20:02] [Music]
[20:22] [Music]
[20:25] thank you thanks readers appreciate that
[20:28] verse 8 for if these things be in you
[20:31] and abound we got to make them increase
[20:33] more faith more virtue more knowledge
[20:36] more temperance they make you that ye
[20:40] shall neither be barren nor unfruitful
[20:42] in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus
[20:45] Christ but he that lack of these things
[20:47] is blind you want to be blind you're
[20:50] going to have spiritual sight children
[20:52] you want us but you don't to be blindly
[20:54] walking around this world I wonder what
[20:56] we should do for God I wonder is there a
[20:58] god you know you want to have your
[21:00] spiritual sight so he lack these things
[21:04] were blind cannot see afar off and I've
[21:06] forgotten that he was purged from his
[21:08] old sin wherefore the rather brethren
[21:11] give diligence to make your calling a
[21:13] little sure or if you do these things
[21:16] you should I'll never fail how do you
[21:19] want to be every one of your visitors
[21:21] and overcomers and never fail God's plan
[21:23] for life amen my hands up to if you
[21:26] could do these things fail the Bible
[21:29] says that means I'll always win through
[21:32] the power of God nature I love to win
[21:34] don't you love to win you like to win
[21:36] games does it feel good to win when
[21:39] you're with Christ and you let this holy
[21:41] spirit go through you you win you
[21:43] you cast down and engage the counsels of
[21:47] okay so here's this picture we look up
[21:50] there I used the Greek definitions to
[21:54] kind of show this so we get faith faith
[21:58] is the substance needed to choose the
[22:00] right way because that's choosing to be
[22:02] baptized faith is choosing to follow
[22:04] Jesus Christ we haven't been baptized
[22:06] here okay well if you've come to God
[22:11] correctly then you've got faith you've
[22:13] got a choice you made the choice to
[22:15] follow the Lord with all your heart
[22:17] right you made that choice you've got
[22:20] that you've got faith to choose the
[22:22] right way alright next is virtue virtue
[22:25] means strength the Prophet said the
[22:27] Bible says that - and that's the
[22:29] strength that daily walk the way it also
[22:31] means in public because a Ruth had
[22:35] virtue the Bible said she was a virtuous
[22:37] woman she pleased got in front of the
[22:40] harvesters in front of Boaz all the city
[22:43] knew Ruth was a virtuous woman okay so
[22:47] you go from oh I want to be baptized
[22:49] want to be a Christian now you go I want
[22:51] a little half strength so I can live it
[22:53] in front of my friends
[22:54] I want to live it when we go to the zoo
[22:56] Oh people to know I'm a Christian at the
[22:58] zoo I want to have virtue when I play
[23:01] with my buddies they play basketball or
[23:03] do Taekwondo I have to have a virtue the
[23:06] strength to be a Christian even in the
[23:07] public at Taekwondo right virtue Allah
[23:11] Graham said when you have the virtue
[23:12] people come and they like to be around
[23:14] you because that's straight Wow strong
[23:16] person knowledge is the understanding
[23:20] you need to know why you walk this way
[23:23] why do we winter long skirts as sisters
[23:25] why do brothers always cut my hair why I
[23:29] need to understand why don't we do other
[23:31] things why do we not go to movie
[23:33] theaters all the times see buddy know
[23:34] why we don't we can tell why don't are
[23:38] we not gonna movie theatres yeah they
[23:41] show evil things and the eyes are the
[23:44] gateway to the soul so if you see evil
[23:46] many times you want evil you start
[23:49] lusting after evil right with the lust
[23:51] of the eyes about self-control
[23:55] temperance is the self-control
[23:57] you need to remain on the way it also
[24:01] means fleshly cravings right when your
[24:05] body craves something as your body ever
[24:08] crave too many sweets yeah so
[24:13] self-control is being able to say no I'm
[24:15] not going to give my body what it once
[24:16] it really wants this for me it was
[24:18] smoking that was something and dr.
[24:20] pepper I drink way too much dr. pepper
[24:22] where it may be unhealthy or made me
[24:25] sick or chewing tobacco it makes you
[24:27] really dependent upon something so when
[24:30] you get temperance and how you're strong
[24:31] enough to control your body you just
[24:35] don't do what you'd be like doing all
[24:37] your your cravings under control alright
[24:41] next and who can read that p-word what's
[24:43] that p-word okay haitians so this is
[24:48] steadfastness to be content on the way
[24:52] because patience is steadfast waiting
[24:55] for God to do his work it's your patient
[24:57] I can wait we all say on our hands like
[25:00] this and say I can wait ready Heidi when
[25:02] I don't have to have it right now give
[25:05] me what I want right now no it's the
[25:07] opposite I can wait
[25:09] I have steadfast babies I can wait huh
[25:14] all right the next one is that G word
[25:17] Lydia godliness
[25:19] nextstep you have patience then God
[25:21] wants you to have godliness which is
[25:24] reverence needed to be just like God and
[25:26] Jesus kind of told us how we do that we
[25:29] must love our enemies okay
[25:31] has somebody ever been in TV before
[25:35] have you been able to love them even
[25:38] though they're mean to you okay
[25:39] well it means God's working you working
[25:42] on you with godliness to be like him
[25:44] because jesus said even the sinners can
[25:46] be nice to think about are nice to them
[25:47] right but we need such godliness where
[25:51] we can love even our enemies and the
[25:54] last thing we need before God puts us
[25:56] into his family is the kindness and that
[26:00] makes sure that we're going to treat
[26:01] God's family the right way and that
[26:04] selflessness
[26:05] needs to live for others especially the
[26:08] family of God on this way you can live
[26:10] for
[26:10] Jose and lift versus their NLP you can
[26:13] live for me you're living to treat God's
[26:16] family the right away there's one to be
[26:18] kind to them okay and that love is the
[26:21] presence of God needed to completely
[26:23] manifest the living Christ Christ living
[26:26] in you every day of your life okay let's
[26:30] read some scriptures here let's go to
[26:31] mark 933 got your Bibles 933 I'm going
[26:35] to show you some examples this is the
[26:38] next time I'm gonna leave this up here
[26:39] so you can see it mark 1933 you know one
[26:43] time before the disciples received the
[26:45] Holy Ghost they were arguing about who
[26:47] was who was cooler who was better who
[26:50] was smarter who was stronger led to
[26:52] better preaching they were arguing
[26:54] better than you are and they'd say no
[26:56] I'm better that you are you ever had an
[26:59] argument alone with anybody it's gonna
[27:01] be my way no you're gonna play the game
[27:03] I want to play you ever argued mark 933
[27:08] the disciples were called dead and
[27:10] they're arguing I'm better
[27:12] no I'm better no I'm better and so they
[27:15] clearly didn't have which one these were
[27:17] they lacking if they're arguing I hadn't
[27:19] greater than you and you need to follow
[27:20] me what were they lacking that's one
[27:23] thing they were lacking for sure brother
[27:26] kind is that's what I thought yeah maybe
[27:28] ten prince2 they could have control
[27:31] their desires so I want to be better
[27:32] than I don't have a better preaching
[27:33] ministry than this person I'm better I'm
[27:36] stronger people should like me more yeah
[27:39] so Lydia can you read let's go to mark
[27:42] 933 let me turn here just just want to
[27:47] show a few examples for this this proves
[27:50] they weren't born again Lydia can agree
[27:54] on 33 and 34
[27:59] [Music]
[28:12] by John said I'm greater than you like
[28:29] for us it might be well I want to be
[28:31] daddy's favorite do I want to be mommy's
[28:33] favorite I want daddy loved me more than
[28:36] my brother systems you want to be
[28:39] greater than somebody else should we
[28:41] feel like that should we want to be
[28:42] greater than other people we should want
[28:45] to serve other people right because
[28:48] jesus said the greatest is that as the
[28:50] person who does what serve the greatest
[28:53] among you will be the servant all right
[28:56] let's do another let's go to Luke 22
[28:58] verse 31 22:31 sanctification cleaning
[29:10] these disciples out even arguing who's
[29:16] the greatest Milka volunteer my older
[29:19] children a lot to read so thank you
[29:21] children Luke 22:31 now can you read 31
[29:27] and 32 there there's a few things
[29:45] actually don't this is the recorded yes
[29:46] some people might watch that from start
[29:48] I think the few things to note there
[29:50] Peter wasn't yet converted yet he spent
[29:52] three years preaching and children he
[29:55] even walked on water and he's doing that
[29:57] the Holy Ghost can you believe that his
[30:00] soul wasn't yet filled with the Holy
[30:01] Ghost because it couldn't come yet
[30:03] because Jesus wasn't glorified yet and
[30:06] it wasn't the day of Pentecost that
[30:08] shows you people can do a lot of amazing
[30:10] things with God's up and
[30:12] still not be born again so it's really
[30:15] important that we be brought down
[30:16] tonight we wanted before together so
[30:18] Jesus says you're not even converted and
[30:20] he said I prayed for you if you make
[30:22] your hands pray so I'm ready for you
[30:24] that your faith doesn't fail so see he
[30:27] was Jesus praying that you'll keep your
[30:29] foundation of faith because guess what
[30:32] in a few hours he's an alert he's gonna
[30:34] lose his virtue he's gonna lose his
[30:37] strength that he's gonna run away from a
[30:39] little girl who says you're one of those
[30:41] gathered aren't you and he swears and
[30:44] said I don't even know the man right he
[30:47] doesn't have enough virtue just Jesus
[30:54] crazy and said please don't let Peter
[30:56] lose his faith is that you read the next
[31:01] two verses 33 and 34 jesus said I'm
[31:05] gonna pray that you don't lose your
[31:06] faith Jesus Peter no Jesus Peter stood
[31:31] up like this imagine yet his arms on the
[31:33] shoulders are ready to die for you I'm
[31:36] ready to go burned in the cross I'm
[31:38] ready to do it he was claiming to have
[31:40] what a lot of strength wasn't I'm ready
[31:44] to do this and just in a few hours the
[31:47] Bible said he ran away from Jesus
[31:48] because he was scared he was scared so
[31:53] we really need the virtue of God don't
[31:54] we in our lives because sometimes we
[31:56] could even think we're higher we can
[31:58] think we're higher in God that we
[31:59] actually are we can make statements that
[32:02] really aren't true but we want to say
[32:05] true statements we want to know where we
[32:07] stand with God at all times Peter didn't
[32:09] know where he stood with God did he he
[32:11] thought I'm gonna stand up but I'll die
[32:12] for you Jesus who when it come to the
[32:15] time a little make your own acacia stand
[32:16] up what you point your finger at me say
[32:20] you're one of those gallons you know
[32:24] Jesus
[32:25] oh and just a few hours later soon no
[32:29] I'm not I promise I swear I don't even
[32:31] know the man and just a few hours
[32:33] earlier he said I'm gonna die with you
[32:35] Jesus I'm ready to go die for you let's
[32:38] give her to class grade hey Johnny T
[32:40] good job that's what it looked like one
[32:42] minute he's like I'm gonna die I don't
[32:46] even know who he is don't kill me don't
[32:48] arrest me I want to go to jail
[32:50] so is it but thankfully right thankfully
[32:57] your brave cookies great for Peter Haven
[33:00] Jesus how many how many are glad Jesus
[33:02] praying for you jesus prayed for you in
[33:04] John 17 he says I pray for them that
[33:07] will hear about me through my disciples
[33:09] and you are some of those that are
[33:12] hearing about Jesus down through all the
[33:14] disciples the last 2,000 years now you
[33:17] get to hear about it
[33:18] Jesus prayed for you yes let me pray for
[33:21] me too
[33:22] he prays for your parents that will have
[33:24] the virtue we should have the strength
[33:25] genetic to be a real witness for Christ
[33:29] let me this is another example I use it
[33:31] like it's easy example I've seen with
[33:37] some sisters sometimes they get baptized
[33:39] and they start wearing skirts but when
[33:41] they go to work they don't have enough
[33:44] strength to wear the skirts at work
[33:45] because people at work making fun of
[33:47] them and so they cross dressed right and
[33:50] they dress like that so that proves if
[33:53] they got baptized it proves they have
[33:54] faith right but they're scared of what
[33:57] people are going to say they don't have
[33:58] the strength to kind of wear the right
[33:59] clothes or a man might not have strength
[34:01] to cut his hair yet I was here what his
[34:03] friends will think about he's scared to
[34:05] cut it very scared to stop smoking
[34:07] cigarettes my friends might make fun of
[34:09] me and that also shows are lacking
[34:11] knowledge because they don't understand
[34:13] like her sister who would wear pants to
[34:15] work she doesn't understand that that's
[34:18] is actually something that God hates
[34:21] right it's an abomination let's say
[34:22] abomination right combination so this
[34:25] person it might be freshly baptized they
[34:28] have faith that Jesus is the way but
[34:30] then they don't have the virtue to wear
[34:32] the right clothes publicly right if I
[34:35] still wear makeup or cut there so they
[34:38] don't
[34:39] to overcome that temptation well I want
[34:40] to be pretty where I want to be like the
[34:42] world or I don't want to be made fun of
[34:44] they don't even have the virtue to stand
[34:47] up but guess what I can add it to the
[34:49] aren't you glad God can and God could
[34:51] have more strength and then God you give
[34:54] the understanding okay I don't want to
[34:56] dominate over men so I'm not gonna paint
[34:59] my face and I'm not gonna wear men's
[35:01] clothes I'm not gonna try to get into a
[35:04] man's position I'm not gonna try to
[35:05] preach like a man does that help does
[35:08] that help everybody understand okay
[35:10] good I want to make sure I show that was
[35:12] one example I wrote down on my on my
[35:13] list here alright look at temperance up
[35:17] there temperance self-control
[35:19] did you know brother Branham would had
[35:22] such a hot temper before he was Holy
[35:24] Ghost filled did you know his teacher
[35:26] would tell him to grab ahold of things
[35:29] and I think it was a string and wrap he
[35:31] said she said wrap that string around
[35:32] your finger until you're you're not mad
[35:34] anymore
[35:34] and brother Graham said he would wrap
[35:36] the string and then it would rip but
[35:37] he'd still be angry it didn't work for
[35:39] him and he said one way I know I'm born
[35:42] again is that I lost my ID my temper
[35:45] anyone God gave you the building control
[35:47] my temper
[35:48] so temperance his self-control right he
[35:52] was able to control himself
[35:53] you guys show me what a temper face look
[35:55] like you show me a Tesla station hey
[36:03] that's a good one so brother Graham was
[36:05] like that but where was his Christian
[36:10] one time you took a shotgun right who's
[36:13] gonna hurt me because they beat him up
[36:16] walking home from school that's how bad
[36:17] his temper was right but he said one way
[36:20] I knew I was born again it was because I
[36:23] didn't do you ever get mad sometimes at
[36:27] your sisters or your brother recently
[36:29] and you feel like it's a really bad
[36:32] temper geography like that you shouldn't
[36:35] be that upset but you are you ever feel
[36:37] like that well that's one example I
[36:39] wanted to give you said that's what I do
[36:42] I was born again because God gave me
[36:43] strength to overcome
[36:49] all right now let's go to Matthew
[36:51] chapter 6 I read this this morning in my
[36:53] Bible reading and I just want to read it
[36:56] again and I want to say this mean to ask
[36:59] for God to ask ask for God to add
[37:03] because Peter said add to your faith
[37:05] virtue add to your virtue knowledge ask
[37:09] and add you have to raise your hand but
[37:16] think about could you would you be happy
[37:19] of God and had it a little more
[37:20] self-control to your life so you did get
[37:22] upset
[37:23] would you like God to add that's a great
[37:27] thing or how about a little more little
[37:30] more patience with instead of getting
[37:35] hot and getting that right away we can
[37:39] be a little more patient if you don't
[37:40] get our way right away
[37:41] God said there's me asked anything
[37:43] they'll give it to us I want to say that
[37:46] we need to ask for God to add to our
[37:49] lives God add more faith to my life
[37:52] ahead more virtue to my life let's look
[37:55] at Matthew chapter 6 I believe this
[38:13] chapter game buddy find that scripture
[38:15] the number seven sin okay thank you I'm
[38:19] sorry wrong chapter thank you brother
[38:20] seven seven thank you sir yes wonderful
[38:26] let's read X actually seven seven and
[38:29] eight
[38:34] okay instead ask and it shall be given
[38:36] unto you cleany
[38:38] seek and ye shall find knock and it
[38:41] shall be opened unto you
[38:42] okay so let's look up here Breanna and
[38:45] pretend you're gonna ask somebody a
[38:46] question in your unit okay good now
[38:49] pretend you're seeking something if
[38:51] you're in the woods and your seat and
[38:52] you're trying to find push pushes aside
[38:54] okay and then knock on something
[38:59] that's what God wants you to do he wants
[39:01] you to ask you want you to seek and he
[39:04] wants you to knock and say hey I have
[39:06] please have some more they may please
[39:10] have some more virtue may I please have
[39:12] some more patience I'm really not that
[39:14] patient sometimes I get mad at my
[39:16] enemies cannot may you would you please
[39:18] give me some more godliness okay you
[39:21] know Jesus said that that's seeking that
[39:23] you can have all those for good birthday
[39:26] for every one that asketh receiveth he
[39:29] said everyone say everyone ready and let
[39:31] me wait for somebody next you say
[39:33] everyone ready everyone
[39:35] everyone that asks receive every one hey
[39:39] but you will see right everyone we just
[39:49] have to ask and say God add this to my
[39:51] life
[39:52] give me more please I have something but
[39:55] I'd like more faith this is
[39:57] sanctification right it's just purifying
[39:59] your life more and more to be like
[40:02] Christ
[40:02] look at verse 9 or what man is there of
[40:05] you whom if his son ask bread will he
[40:07] give my stones now I stand up then my me
[40:10] and say okay today a giant eagle did
[40:12] pretend you're gonna ask me for food so
[40:15] it's asking for something to China to
[40:18] know what the parking lot needs some of
[40:21] those stones out there is that what I
[40:23] said today
[40:24] no he asked me first sound and what did
[40:28] he's getting well today yeah she got a
[40:30] sub right he asked me for a sub so say
[40:34] daddy yeah you and Lydia can split us up
[40:37] is that okay
[40:38] all right give him two glasses great
[40:40] time that's what Jesus is saying if he
[40:43] asked for a set of stuff I'm not going
[40:45] to give him sold out in the driveway all
[40:48] right in the parking lot I'm not gonna
[40:50] say you know what go dig in the trash
[40:51] and find some old banana peels and Jesus
[40:57] said that's what my father's like my
[40:59] father did bless my father
[41:02] he's gonna give me something because he
[41:11] loves you look at the next verse or if
[41:19] you ask a fish will he give him a
[41:20] serpent of course enough if you then
[41:25] being evil God gives unto your children
[41:27] how much more shall come the kind of
[41:42] cycle of the people at church how much
[41:44] more really good I'll tell you more
[41:47] you'll give him the baptism of the Holy
[41:48] Ghost then it'll give him a fruit of the
[41:50] Spirit and that'll give them the armor
[41:51] of God that's how much more I'll give
[41:54] you you gotta ask so think about that
[41:57] don't raise your hand but great many
[41:59] prayers I want you to pray I know your
[42:10] parents do - I want I know they want you
[42:13] to start praying for these specific
[42:15] issues of God she could be more safe
[42:18] goodbye children so the branch said you
[42:28] have to remember said you have to add
[42:30] all these and then God will cap you off
[42:32] with love those and you'll see all those
[42:37] virtues in Geo cap you off and see all
[42:39] those wonderful things in you so there's
[42:43] the examples we went all over almost
[42:44] we're about ready to finish up I've been
[42:46] going about 40 minutes we're almost done
[42:48] so take it take a deep breath in ready
[42:51] resets our mind so we can focus again re
[42:54] okay so here's a big picture I just made
[42:56] this one so I know there's a lot in this
[42:58] one but I'm gonna point to it so you can
[43:00] see okay everybody look up here we've
[43:03] already been showing this so here's what

[43:19] give you hurt you then he wants to give
[43:22] you how there's anyone to give you

[44:58] right all right Lydia now come to class
[45:07] ready thanks you're really boys and
[45:09] girls I appreciate that and so I just
[45:12] want to show you here's my title after
[45:14] all this after sanctified here God wants
[45:16] to take you up higher and he's going to
[45:19] give you the fruits of the spirit and
[45:21] the armor of God and then you're gonna
[45:22] place you in your position you might be
[45:25] placed as a
[45:26] your mom mr. or did he like your mom
[45:31] my wife might be placed in a position
[45:33] where God gives you authority guess what
[45:35] that kid and the mothers are falling
[45:37] over their children that's a lot of
[45:38] authority I think about jakka Ben think
[45:41] about Moses mob document what did she do
[45:43] that most mothers wouldn't do she built
[45:46] what for baby Moses didn't you remember
[45:48] what she build for baby Moses Esther's
[45:51] you member you heard to Gladys grace now
[45:56] and then Esther what did she do with
[45:58] that basket there's no way she could
[46:01] have done this unless she was full of
[46:02] faith why did she do in that nasty yeah
[46:08] a wonderful let's say oxen job Esther a
[46:12] awesome job
[46:13] after them would would any mom would
[46:16] would most moms do that absolutely think
[46:18] no my wife didn't do that and my own
[46:21] mother didn't do that I'm glad they
[46:23] didn't because it had to be directed by
[46:25] the Holy Spirit right so that shows she
[46:28] was a mature believer she was adopted
[46:31] into her position she could believe the
[46:34] Word of God and then raise your children
[46:36] and she could push out that Ark and not
[46:39] be a play those big fat crocodiles make
[46:41] her arms were like a crocodile
[46:42] she wasn't a scared she wasn't scared
[46:45] crack in the house because she had faith
[46:47] she was a real mature believer and she
[46:50] could push out there know if God if God
[46:54] is with me of God showed me these things
[46:56] God will take care of Moses ducati Moses
[47:00] yeah he took repeatedly led Moses all
[47:03] the way the Pharaoh's daughter and then
[47:05] we know what happened after that Mary
[47:08] went and found Moses is mine Moses might
[47:11] have to spend more time with Moses
[47:12] that's true let's go through a few more
[47:15] things as we close so even even mom's
[47:18] want to find their a position in Christ
[47:20] what what can they do what's their
[47:23] position in Christ and even dads don't
[47:25] dads want to find their position in
[47:27] Christ as a father and a soul-winner
[47:30] and raising their children as a leader
[47:32] of the home they want to be in their
[47:34] positions they don't want to be out of
[47:35] position they want to be in their
[47:38] position and so that's why
[47:40] right so we can get in our position who
[47:44] knows what happened with Judas Judas is
[47:47] position was to be an apostle or a
[47:49] missionary what happened to him in his
[47:51] position he's never take his position as
[47:58] a real missionary with the Holy Ghost no
[48:01] he didn't why didn't he give to his
[48:03] position what did he what he loved more
[48:05] than Jesus money havens who about trade
[48:10] memory he never reached his position he
[48:14] never went his way the statue of her man
[48:16] he never got sanctified all the way he
[48:19] never got bored again he did go to
[48:20] Pentecost to get born again so he never
[48:24] reached his full position in God and the
[48:27] Bible said he was lost and that's so sad
[48:29] how many want to reach their position
[48:32] god I want to be in my position that's
[48:37] what I'm trying to help you do find your
[48:38] positions through the Word of God all
[48:41] right let's close with these last few
[48:43] scriptures well let me stop right there
[48:46] is there any questions about this so far
[48:57] I would think so firstly thinks yeah cuz
[49:05] you think about Stephen he was still the
[49:07] Holy Ghost
[49:07] however they were stoning him he said
[49:09] Father forgive them they don't know they
[49:12] don't know what they do
[49:13] so it's forgiving everybody and Jesus
[49:15] said if you can't forget
[49:25] that's the right question yeah we have
[49:27] to forgive every man their trespasses
[49:29] everyone wonderful question yeah we if
[49:33] we leave somebody Unforgiven and the
[49:35] Bible Center father won't give us any
[49:41] other questions he said somebody hates
[50:07] you are supposed to hate them back or
[50:09] hate them forward well we don't want to
[50:11] hate them back right and you want to
[50:13] forgive them and that's where godliness
[50:15] like now kind of goes with Malachi's
[50:16] question godliness is loving like God
[50:19] does God sends his rein on sinners
[50:22] doesn't he he gives sinners good suppers
[50:24] doesn't but yet do they love God back no
[50:29] so godliness is being able to love
[50:30] anyone who doesn't love you back so yes
[50:33] you have to he you have to not hate them
[50:36] forgive them and move forward with God
[50:38] up into the the other virtues of God
[50:41] that makes sense you can't hate them
[50:44] back we can't hate we can't any friends
[50:46] or people who mistreat our friends and
[50:48] we can't hate anybody and all even
[50:52] that's mean to us
[50:53] I know it's hard right it's hard but who
[50:56] can we ask for help - help us forgive
[50:59] people that hate us who we think we
[51:01] could ask Jesus he said ask sirisha hit
[51:05] ask
[51:06] seek see pretend you're seeking for
[51:09] truth and then knock so I'll just do say
[51:14] knock and say Lord I'm here at your door
[51:17] you say Lord I'm here and the Lord would
[51:21] say what do you want a haven how can I
[51:23] help you you're my daughter
[51:24] what can I hear me
[51:26] we say can you help me forgive someone
[51:30] that hates you think the father will
[51:33] give that to her or do you think he'll
[51:35] give you a circuit or stove what do you
[51:36] say Ava - GLaDOS great job yeah that's
[51:43] right
[51:44] he's gonna give it to you so that's good
[51:46] questions any other questions those are
[51:48] really great questions about being
[51:49] sanctified yes that's a good question
[52:30] the question is you can have some of
[52:33] these virtues for a long time but then
[52:36] there might be a season where you kind
[52:38] of fall short and so I always take that
[52:40] back to brother Branham when he lied to
[52:43] the IRS program said my head felt like
[52:45] it was spinning
[52:46] he lost self-control you know he was
[52:48] born again so we know order to get
[52:50] people to have a measure of these but
[52:52] then God will give us trials which is
[52:54] like pruney you know so when you prune a
[52:58] tree you want to grow back stronger we
[52:59] know about that your lands people you
[53:01] know about that's it but there's a
[53:03] certain season for it right so that's
[53:06] the way we look at it and Jesus said I'm
[53:07] gonna groom you or let you go through a
[53:09] trial allow you to be cut so that you
[53:12] could produce more fruit that's what I
[53:14] would believe if somebody could be born
[53:15] again and you can fall short in one of
[53:17] these areas but it just is just not
[53:20] allowing you to be proved so you can
[53:21] produce more fruit up here so you can
[53:23] have even more temperance so then the
[53:26] next time this person comes you're even
[53:28] stronger to be able to stand up if
[53:31] they're badgering you I program said
[53:32] Jesus had to withstand all the badgering
[53:34] of the Pharisees you mentioned three
[53:36] didn't have years of theirs badgering
[53:37] with questions
[53:39] they set traps for him all the time you
[53:41] ever set traps for anybody here when you
[53:43] play games Jesus would they was
[53:46] constantly a trap here there's a trap
[53:48] here
[53:49] yeah they constantly watch his step so
[53:51] he wasn't trapped by the Pharisee so I
[53:54] hope there's that help brother a little
[53:56] bit by God's grace if that's okay
[53:58] because God always wants to add more to
[54:01] us and those are my last few scriptures
[54:05] time finish up let's go to Romans 12:3
[54:22] now I do have a quote to go along with
[54:25] this scripture I don't have a quote in
[54:26] front of me but for the brand send a
[54:28] gift of faith like if you have one of
[54:30] the nine gifts of the Spirit and one of
[54:31] them was bait he says that's just more
[54:33] of the right of regular faith she said
[54:35] that's just a greater portion of that
[54:37] faith foundation that everybody has just
[54:40] a greater measure so you just have more
[54:41] faith and that's what your 9 gives the
[54:43] Holy Spirit so Romans 12:3 now could you
[54:49] read this for me buddy
[54:49] thank you guys are such good readers so
[54:51] helpful thank you
[55:09] everybody has a measure or portion of
[55:12] faith right everybody has that so but we
[55:17] can add more to that because I got some
[55:19] more scriptures let's go to Luke 17:5
[55:23] Luke 17:5 and education have you read
[55:26] this one Luke 17:5
[55:28] thanks for reading occasion appreciate
[55:30] it Esther how do you feel about reading

[55:38] mom and dad told me how much you like to
[55:40] he will let us to read this one if she's
[55:45] right because it's a kind of a shorter
[55:46] bursts it's her first time on the mic in
[55:48] love her this 17:5
[55:53] there's a couple of big words in there
[55:54] like apostles and increase when I'm
[55:59] trying to read that maybe the whole
[56:00] denied for great you were to class great
[56:08] job Esther a great greeting so see the
[56:11] Apostles already had faith but they said
[56:13] give me more do the knocking again Lord
[56:18] can I have more faith increase my faith
[56:22] I need more
[56:25] did they keep it a secret from Jesus or
[56:27] did they ask Jesus let's not keep our
[56:30] desires secret from God no God knows our
[56:32] desires but he loves the ears pray I
[56:35] love when my children come up to me and
[56:38] ask for good things not for candy bars
[56:42] but I love when they ask me for good
[56:45] things I love when they tell me Oh daddy
[56:47] I'd love to get this for Christmas or my
[56:49] birthday because I want to give it to
[56:51] them I want to make them happy I wanted
[56:53] to give them something they love and how
[56:55] much more does God love to give us what
[56:58] we need alright couple more so everybody
[57:02] has a measure a portion but we can add
[57:04] to it to increase our faith so increase
[57:06] our hope sorry
[57:08] increase I've heard you to knowledge
[57:09] temperance he can increase these things
[57:11] okay that's what a second Corinthians
[57:13] 3:18 and they'll have one more for that
[57:15] second corinthians 3:18 we'll have
[57:17] occasion to read this one and i can help
[57:20] you find it if you want on occasion
[57:21] second corinthians 3:18 2nd corinthians
[57:33] 3:18 verse 23 18 chapter 3 verse 18 i
[57:51] will let occasionally this one second
[57:53] Corinthians three eight three universe
[58:05] [Music]
[58:14] [Music]
[58:28] let's get a Shinto classification
[58:30] wonderful do you know who this was
[58:32] talking about Moses remember when he
[58:35] went up on the mountain and the Bible
[58:37] studies he stood with God for forty days
[58:39] and what was his face like when he came
[58:42] down the mountain who remembers now God
[58:45] his face was shining you make your face
[58:47] shine he just stayed with God so much
[58:52] children he was just praying there in
[58:54] God's presence that he started to shine
[58:57] he went from shine here to shine here to
[59:00] shine here to shine here so when he come
[59:02] down here to put a veil over his faces
[59:04] who is so shiny and that's what the
[59:06] Bible says we should do when we read the
[59:09] Word of God or hear the word of God you
[59:11] never look at the Word of God as you
[59:13] look at it this word should shine upon
[59:16] you more and more and more now look up
[59:17] at me and put a big smile you should be
[59:20] shining with the joy of God from glory
[59:22] to glory right we don't have to have a
[59:26] vision or we don't to go up on a
[59:28] mountain we can just hear the word of
[59:29] God pray and see God and then we get
[59:32] more and more of God's glory in our life
[59:34] more and more virtues in our life okay
[59:37] that makes sense
[59:38] the more time you spend staring right
[59:41] here and the word of God the more time
[59:44] or the more you'll be like Jesus right
[59:46] more glory okay last one let's go to
[59:49] Romans 1:17 and right there just out of
[59:51] hours of praises Oh
[59:54] Romans 1:17 hope this has been a good
[1:00:02] Bible study for the children like I said
[1:00:04] we're going to pray after this I'm gonna
[1:00:06] have you look at that and a little bit
[1:00:08] pyramid against and then we're gonna
[1:00:10] pray say lord please add this virtue of
[1:00:13] blame to me or please add this
[1:00:17] this patience to me please add to this
[1:00:19] rather kindness to Romans 1:17 alright
[1:00:37] Romans 1:17 maybe we can read together
[1:00:40] now to their case you either that is
[1:00:42] getting there we can all read it out
[1:00:44] loud here let me hold it and then we'll
[1:00:46] hear your voice okay on three one two
[1:00:49] three or therein is the righteousness of
[1:00:54] God revealed from faith to faith as it
[1:00:59] is written the just shall live by hey
[1:01:03] all right
[1:01:03] great job I'm gonna give you children
[1:01:06] around the five things we need today how
[1:01:08] about a dog so I'm gonna give them
[1:01:09] around for interacting with us now let's
[1:01:15] close our Bibles because we're going to
[1:01:16] close with a word of Prayer and now look
[1:01:19] up here if you can which one of these
[1:01:24] characteristics do you want God to add
[1:01:26] to our life yours is probably going to
[1:01:29] be different from somebody else's right
[1:01:32] think about which one you have faith to
[1:01:35] choose to be baptized and follow Christ
[1:01:37] you have the virtue or the strength to
[1:01:40] live it in front of your friends and in
[1:01:42] front your family and out in public or
[1:01:44] do we say bad words of public or do we
[1:01:47] do we follow friends when they do evil
[1:01:49] when we play games with that do we
[1:01:53] understand what God's word really means
[1:01:56] why we shouldn't do things enough can we
[1:01:59] control our bodily cravings can we
[1:02:01] control our cravings and things that we
[1:02:03] want can we be patient and not get angry
[1:02:08] we don't get our way we eat fast and
[1:02:10] keep waiting
[1:02:11] is it hard to wait for things or do we
[1:02:14] get upset are we godly did we love those
[1:02:18] who don't like us and are we kind to
[1:02:23] everyone the church even when they're
[1:02:26] not kind of us kind others in the church

[1:02:40] we being kind to our brothers and

[1:02:51] give me a thumbs up what you've decided
[1:02:52] which one you want to pray for

[1:03:08] repeat after me but you put the virtue
[1:03:10] in there you don't just say it out loud
[1:03:11] but repeat after me

[1:03:14] Heavenly Father you are good we ask for
[1:03:23] something you will give it to us and

[1:04:34] does that help us understand where God
[1:04:36] wants to take you you could be in the
[1:04:38] center of God's will
