you know one of my daughters I think it was Haven or Karis ask me why they call it Good Friday Daddy and they were so sad that Jesus died and I said it was sad for him but good for us praise God thank God very sad for him great suffering but yet the Bible said he had joy for the joy that was set before him he was suffering totally completely as a man but yet inside of his soul there was some joy present hard to explain it's a paradox as brother Branham said all God's promises and his purposes are paradoxes but thank God for His mercy let's go to let's start with our memory verse rather Philippians four seven and eight and then we'll get to our text out of Acts chapter one so Philippians four seven and eight like to greet everybody here by God's grace good to see the Saints in the house the Lord tonight praise God and greet all the saints live streaming I trust everybody is thankful for God's protection upon their family I was texting brother Jim schumake from Pennsylvania and a couple other brothers and they said no one in their churches has had the virus so we're very thankful for that the only one I know of would be BCF or the Chad lambs Church it was reported to have a couple cases but we're thankful for God's mercy and his protection and we'll just keep trusting in the Lord to keep us healthy oh yeah sir brother Brooks did send his greetings he sent me a text today the brook sends his greetings or willingness if they open up the states by then we'll have him at the end of the month in May we'll see we had to cancel to preachers so far brother Matthew McLeod and brother Gino from New York he said he's actually he's in New York he said he's actually seen a couple people died he didn't say if there were church members or not but he lives right there in the heart of New York he says they've had he's had to go or they've had to hear about some funerals of some people they know so it's it's you know of course it's in certain places more than others so let's just remember as we pray later let's remember them continue remember them in prayers we did earlier Philippians four seven and eight let's read these scriptures together ask the Lord to write these upon our hearts Philippians 4:7 let's read it on three one two three and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on these things praise God let's go to Acts chapter one verse three I just want to read one scripture out of here did I skip a line on that memory verse okay forgive me I thought I was trying to close my eyes and try to remember the next coming words so forgive me acts 1:3 I'd like to speak on a very simple topic the passion of Jesus Christ so we want to look at this one scripture of course that's where the movie gets its title from Acts chapter one verse three what a strange English word for us passion passion but the word means suffering Acts chapter one verse three let's read that together one two three to whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs being seen of them forty days and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God let's have one more word of Prayer if you ever need on your heart let's make it known unto God let's pray again for the Saints there in New York and those impacted Heavenly Father we love you Lord God we appreciate these scriptures we're in a meditate on things that are pure good holy of good report honest and true we're meditating on those things Lord and as we think about our friends in New York we just pray God Lord that you'll protect them bring healing to those that are sick and afflicted Lord God we know you're a healer we know Lord you'd love to do the supernatural prayer you'd manifest yourself in that way be with brother Gino Lord associate pastor there and brother the lead pastor there brother Avon Lord God just help them Lord there in the midst of a great trial so Lord I pray you raise up a standard by the blood of Jesus Christ father bless us here tonight as we look to you for communion Lord we know communion means to talk with Lord and so we're gonna talk with you Lord here at the mercy seat here at the presence of God and or just bless us here in your divine presence meet every need I pray in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said Amen god bless she's been asleep praise God I don't know if you notice it but we got a new container and wine there it's our last once after that we have to start buying them brother Kim gave me a good link he has to buy his now cuz the brother that used to make them he's no longer in the message he left the message brother I don't wanna name his name yeah I got to be more careful anyways the homemade wine that we bought that's from 2010 so that's 20 yup so that's 10 years old rather we bought those you know ten years ago so after that but the cam gave me a good Jewish company that makes wine and I think it's made according to the Jewish laws so after that we'll get that and also tonight we'll be having separate cups for everybody just so no one's concerned about germs and everything we want to use wisdom and we want to do what's right praise God so I want to look at this thought here tonight the of the christ' a passion of Jesus Christ rather and we're using a couple of references I found the article here from a doctor just to kind of go through the medical aspects of the crucifixion I watched fear for videos on it this week and kind of just just sobering to see what all Christ went through but I want to start by first looking at the word passion and the Greek it means it means suffering vexation afflicted it can mean bad plight so the scripture says to him also he showed himself alive after his passion and so Jesus Christ suffered a great passion a great vexation and a great suffering it's interesting they you know chose the word the the interpreters of the Hebrew and Greek rather the Greek when they wrote this in the King James Version I think it kind of is a appropriate word because we know Jesus had the joy that was set before him and it was his passion now this is a different word different definition of passion like we would say in a passion enthusiasm we know Jesus did have that yet enthusiasm to do the will of God praise the Lord no matter what the father asked him he was willing to do it I remember as we'll get to tonight we looked at Scripture later he said he taught his disciples at the Last Supper he said with desire have I desired to have this food with you so Jesus had a great love and a great passion to be with his disciples one last time before his going away but we know he came back in a great way praise God by the Holy Spirit and so we see that this is mentioning Christ's passion and then he gave many infallible proofs well I wanted to run that word passion down through the New Testament and I just pulled out a few scriptures Matthew 16 Jesus is telling Peter he's got the keys of the kingdom he's gonna build the church upon the revelation of who he is as we said on Wednesday night that revelation is the absolute praise God the revelation is the spirits revealing of God's truth to you and I brother man said upon this absolute I'll build my church and the gates of Hell shall not prevail against it amen I'll tell you it's been prevailing these last 21 years in my life praise God since 1999 amen this this revelation of Jesus Christ has been preserving me and helping me overcome the gates of Hell praise God amen so we thank the Lord for that he said but from that time in Matthew 16:21 forth Jesus began to shew unto his disciples how that he must go unto Jerusalem and suffer many things of the elders and chief priests and scribes and be killed and be raised again the third day and that's when Peter took him and shook him and said he rebuked him and said be it far from thee Lord this shall not be unto thee and of course Jesus said get behind me Satan because he knew it was his purpose in life to take the cross to take the shame he knew he was the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world praise God just as John the Baptist knew it and announced it he said that's the Lamb of God he takes away the sin of the world so he showed how he must suffer notice many things had to suffer many many beatings as we'll see in a moment many slaps and many whippings and spinnings and he suffered many things and he had to do it in order to take the full brunt of sins punishment in matthew 17 12 Jesus tells Peter and John he said but I say anew that he lies has come already and they knew him not speaking of John the Baptist but have done unto him whatsoever they listed likewise shall also the Son of man suffer of them interesting Jesus is again saying look how John the Baptist was killed he said I must suffer as well I must have a passion as well a vexation suffering of them and notice it was the same spirit that killed him right the same Roman spirit right with Herod and his Herodias that same spirit on Pontius Pilate then upon the Jews the same spirit and church say like this it's the same spirit we're battling today praise God that religious spirit right that loves to exalt man's ways and and man's greed above the things of God and wants to have a self righteousness to try to make it to heaven and and and declare themselves righteous but there's only one righteousness and that's through the will of God that's through repentance that's through water baptism that's through the the gospel of Jesus Christ I'm thankful to be a gospel preacher amen we're preaching good news tonight praise God that Christ died for the sinners the righteous for the unrighteous I'm glad to be a gospel Holy Ghost field preacher amen the good news of God is being preached tonight praise God hallelujah it's a great gospel Jesus uses us again he's talking to his disciples now in Luke 17 24 he said for as though this is the second coming this is the rapture for as lightning that lighteth out of the one part under heaven shine ahthe under the other part under heaven so also shall the Son of Man be in his day did you guys all have a bad storm in Akron on was it Monday night or was it Tuesday night we had an awful storm we drove just one mile up the road there was proud there was probably 10 or 12 trees just ripped right out of the ground and they were without power for two days it was just it was just awful storm out I don't know how was it bad for you guys up here it was awful but that was a lightning storm I think the girl said there was a lightning storm and there was hail and everything and Jesus likens his coming to the swiftness of lightning the second time it's gonna be like lightning like the Bible said in a moment of twinkling of an eye but Jesus says in verse 25 but he says first must he suffer many things and be rejected of this generation praise God so there was a suffering first before the lightning coming there was a slow oh my imagine imagine jesus's flesh wish wished his death could have been lightning but instead it was a slow drawn-out process not like lightning not like lightning but slow and draw it out and he said I must suffer many things but he said the second coveting is like lightning praise God amen oh thank God hallelujah that what will be changed will be ready we must be ready at all times amen and we'll be ready cuz it'll come like lightning thank the Lord Luke 22 15 jesus said he's sending them with desire have I desired to eat this Passover with you before I suffer for I say unto you I will not anymore eat thereof until it be fulfilled in the kingdom of God so again Jesus keeps mentioning the suffering the suffering and we know he's called the suffering servant praise God Jesus Christ the suffering servant so he said I want to have one last communion with you praise God I know one last meal with you before I suffer and he did after he died and rose again he he's reminding the disciples in knew 24 he said o fools and slow of heart to believe all that the prophets have spoken ought not Christ to have suffered these things and to enter into his glory praise God hallelujah so what came first first came suffering then comes glory same for you and I praise God we want to see the rapture but I imagine there first must be suffering and then glory praise God Amen hallelujah we notice for Israel suffering right the suffering of the the martyrs during the Holocaust and all down through the ages they're blinded they must suffer but then comes the glory praise God the Bible said I read it this week Zechariah 13 they must suffer first all nations will come against them the Pope's going to break the covenant they must suffer first but then comes the glory a fountain is going to break forth a fountain will open in the house of David praise God amen it's the desert spiritually now for the Jew it's a desert but in that day after the two prophets are raptured Jesus reveals himself and a fountain opens and then they can weep and cry from house a house just like you and I we cry for Jesus today Bray's God amen why could the fountains open for us amen we sang about earlier the fountain is open in the house of God today amen but one day that fountain will open for them praise God suffering first and then the glory later praise God that's the reason people don't get born again in churches whether it's Methodist Baptist message Presbyterian they don't die enough to self praise God they don't die out through prayer they don't want to be born in a born-again enough they still want to hold on to the things of the world right they have foolish desire still but a Christian in a real Holy Ghost filled believer before that time of being filled is able to die out and sell out right like sell out in order to have the pearl of great price amen oh thank you lord amen it's a it's a level of suffering praise God it's a level of dying no it's a level of a pain and sanctification praise God as far as dying out to your own will thank the Lord so he says art Christ to have suffered these things and enter into his glory not Church the look at that during his whole ministry he's telling them I'm going to suffer they just don't catch it they don't get it right none of us would have got it either but he kept reminding them I have to suffer I'm gonna suffer great things but afterwards I'll be glorified they didn't catch it till afterwards so much so that Jesus is right there resurrected trying to tell them he's trying to remind them of what he said praise God my look how merciful Church I say like this look how merciful God was in his first coming and I'll say like this if he's merciful the first coming he'll be merciful the second coming praise God in other words will cuts the revelation for the rapture at the right time praise God and if we die beforehand will surely catch it on the other side for the dead in Christ will rise first amen the voice of the resurrection the same voice that called Lazarus Lazarus come forth will call all the dead in Christ bride call them forth and they'll be raised first hallelujah thank the Lord now there's a beautiful scripture I want to well we're almost there but in Luke 24 45 then he opened their understanding that they might understand the scripture I can relate to that I remember reading my Bible for 18 years my mom dragging me to church and I didn't understand any of it I had no understanding but when I finally repented at the athletes and action conference it seemed like it just started to all make sense Ray's God it's like he just opened my understanding that when the message come it was like a total explosion praise God an explosion of Revelation through the Holy Spirit so Christ opens our understanding that we might understand the scriptures verse 46 and he said thus it is written and thus it behaved or was necessary for Christ to suffer it believed him it was necessary for him to suffer and to rise from the dead the third day and that repentance and remission of sins should be preached in his name praise God among all nations beginning at Jerusalem hallelujah now if you have your Bibles let's go to acts 3:18 I just want to read this and I want to I just want to give like a a real fast list of all these prophecies that Jesus fulfilled because there's a list of them here brother and I think does that and the message what is it traction on the mountain he lists all these scriptures that were fulfilled and I found another list I want to read those as well so acts 3:18 thank you good kitchen but those things which God before had showed by the mouth listen of all his prophets that Christ should suffer he hath so fulfilled the member church this even includes God the prophet because God was the first one who prophesied of Jesus's death right he said the serpent will bruise his heel but Jesus will bruises had amen so the very first one who talked about the suffering Messiah was God himself amen God prophesied that as the god prophet the capital P right prophet God prophet prophesied to Adam and Eve but the Bible said all these prophets prophesied that Christ should suffer praise God now let's go through a quick list here I want to just go through a quick list and you can see all the all the prophecies David and Psalms 41 said that Jesus Christ would be betrayed by a close friend we know that was Judas and then zechariah 11 said that a price will be paid to Judas for betraying Jesus look so here we have David and Zechariah in 1113 said the amount would be money thirty pieces of silver zechariah then said he'd be forsaken by his disciples right as a sheep scattered from the shepherd David then said there be false witnesses against Christ in Psalms 27 12 and Psalms 30:5 11 then Isaiah so now we got three right got Isaiah Zechariah and David Isaiah said he would not open his mouth to defend himself against the false accusations that's what acts 3 says there it says all the holy prophets spoke of his suffering Church we get betrayed by one friend and we feel like the end of the world is gonna end great Jesus will not only betrayed by Judas but all disciples forsook him his very closest ones forsook him the Bible said all we like sheep have been scattering then none of us would have let another women none of the women Rowe went through all that now they were there at the cross when he was crucified but where were they all the other times so all we like sheep would have abandoned him I and yet he knew it but yet he did it for the glory and the joy that was set before him praise God amen he was going to prove that there was nothing good in man there was nothing in man to save himself he needed help he needed help from the Savior praise God he needed help from God spirit because man's spirit was insufficient and so godly and every man and woman fall short of God's glory in order to forgive him and give him an internal power an inner man power that came on the day of Pentecost amen dori and there Peter would say don't crucify me like my Lord make me crucified upside down he was so in love with Jesus and so one to be like him and knew how little he was compared to Jesus I was looking at that today you remember there was two messengers to the the New Testament Peter was the messenger to the circumcision the Jews Paul was the messenger to the Gentiles the Gentile dispensation - of some of the biggest failures we'd say but listen we would have failed - but Peter said I'll die with you I'll never forsake you and with enough matter a few hours he's cursing and denying that even knows Christ yet God said I'm gonna choose him he's gonna he's gonna take the gospel to the Jews amen see God had to choose somebody that would fail but then someone that would accept pardon amen someone that it would accept forgiveness and someone that would accept the Holy Spirit because he knew his spirit wasn't strong enough he tried but he wasn't able to do it so he knew he needed the Holy Spirit and God sent him the Holy Spirit amen and then Paul was on the other spectrum he hated Jesus he would drag him off he would drag him to jail and try to get him blasting blasting blaspheme he would do such that you would say such awful things he would hold coat so Christians could die and yet God said I'm gonna choose him a man he's kicking against the pricks he's just hurting himself but I know deep down in that heart he wants truth amen he wants righteousness he really wants to live right he's got zeal but zeal for the law wait till you get the zeal for the gospel praise God he'll go on three missionary trips the greatest missionaries there ever was a men survived all those shipwrecks and took the beatings met numerous beatings thirty-nine forty stripes save one five times I believe endured all that for the gospel sakes and he said I bear my body the marks of a Christian a man a man said the only thing I can do is bear the marks in my vocal cords that's about medicine he said I'm happy to do that praise God if we can't do anything else let us give whatever we can energies our bodies let's bear our bodies the marks of Jesus Christ whatever God calls us to give so look at these these are the ones that God chose mine what a choosing but now let's get back to more of the prophecies memory God's prophesied in genesis 3:15 isaiah said he'd be scourge in isaiah 50 verse 6 david said his body would be brutalized and so did isaiah in psalms 22 in Isaiah 52 Isaiah 53 of course we'll get to that just a moment the beautiful chapter on Jesus's crucifixion that's why I told camera one time I made camera I kind of did a will and I sent the cam a couple of years ago I said if I die and have a funeral make sure you play make sure you read Isaiah 53 praise God that's the greatest scripture amen because we were woo he was wounded for our transgressions but with His stripes we are healed amen it paints all of us as little sheep that run away but God's mercy draws them all back together and heals them praise God our own sins curse us our own sins separate us from God but God in His love he said but his Messiah will see his seed praise God he will see his sheep return amen he'll give them life he'll give them fountains of waters I'm one of those praise God I ran from the shepherd but I came back by his grace I heard his call and he gave me the Living Waters amen that's right Psalm 69 said there would be shame reproach and dishonor and his adversaries would howl on him like dogs I saw him 22 and Zechariah says his hands and feet would be pierced Isaiah 53 he'd be numbered with the transgressors Psalm 22 and 109 said the observers would shake their heads at him Psalm 22 seven and eight he'd be reviled and mocked by the crowd and intercession for sinners and those killing him yes we see that Psalm 22 they'd part his garments and cast lots for his clothes the Bible said this that his bones stared at him on the cross Oh picture that on the cross he can barely lift his head his bones beneath are staring at him now none of them were broken right because the word couldn't be broken hey Laurie the word couldn't be broken but his bones were so exposed as he stood there now they I'm gonna read a little bout the description there but he must have been looking down and see his ribs exposed and perhaps maybe even his femur there his bones were just exposed and he says my bone stare at me Psalm 38 said his family and friends would observe his crucifixion Psalm 22 said he was forsaken by God Psalm 22 said his side would be pierced Psalm 69 said they give him vinegar to drink some 31 said he would commit my spirit under the father into thy hands I commit my spirit Exodus 12 43 in Psalms 34 said none of his bones would be broken praise God he'd be buried in the tomb of a rich man Isaiah 53 he'd be resurrected a man in Psalm 16 hallelujah praise God and his ascension to the Father's right hand Psalms 68 18 praise God thank the Lord now I just want to go through this I'm not sure if I ever went through this with you but I just want to go quickly through this did you ever think about the night he was arrested about what hours that he experienced all this trouble I went back and I saw I was listening to some of these teachings and I thought nah I never even thought about that so according to history in the Hebrew history this one reference says that Jesus started the Passover at 6:00 p.m. on the Thursday night and it lasted till about 10:00 p.m. so of course that would include you know he's washed all their feet he started given the communion as well he said with desire of desire to do this and at some point Judas he said go do what you have to do and he gave him the SUP and he left and the Bible said after about ten o'clock they started making their way to the garden of gethsemane and the Bible said they sang hymns and that's where Jesus on their way there is just a few short meters maybe 50 meters away they were singing it Jesus at some point stopped singing and he starts preaching about John 14 16 and 17 he start preaching about the Holy Ghost he's God amen and then John 17 he said he said I'll be one you'll be one you'll be in me I ain't you and I in the father praise God he talks about the oneness of God amen through the Holy Spirit some in his last words of sermons were about the Holy Spirit it wasn't to the crowd it was to the elected a man here's to the elect apostles praise God given that less just word fulfillment and promise about the Holy Spirit praise God and now we read it today and we see in that very text where Jesus gives us the evidence of the Holy Ghost because the Holy Spirit will make you speak in tongues no the Holy Spirit will make you shout no the Holy Spirit will guide you into all truth of God's Word amen you ought to have some emotion when you get born again something has to happen praise God but after that the Holy Spirit as proof will guide you deeper into the things of God into the Word of God amen ah so he gets there according this he about 10:00 p.m. he makes his way over there to the garden and he tells the three here I'm gonna go pray you stay right here watch with me and he goes prays three times and this is where his suffering starts it's the great drops of blood as he prays now this condition is called FEMA to hydrosis and maybe one of you can correct me on if I pronounced it it's where the capillary blood vessels feed the sweat glands they rupture causing them to express blood it's seen many times in soldiers or people suffering that are on the brink of death and they they have so much pressure that they start sweating blood and so Christ was doing this why because he was bleeding three times his father if it's possible let this cup pass from me I'm Church we just said it he had joy he knew the victory that was going to come he got it showed him you know the son of David ministry and sitting on the right hand of God he had joy for that but it was hard for his flesh to want to go through that you and I it's it's hard to miss a meal too fast right it's hard to to suffer but Jesus was so as flesh was so upset with this that he starts sweating blood it's from extreme physical or emotional stress the Bible said he was looking that we must look to Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross he sprang to East Franken somebody else take this and the father of course would say no brother man says like the Dove came down and had a conference he called the Garden of Gethsemane conference amen and the dog came down to meet with the lamb one more time and said you've got to do this and he received strength he said why I have enough strength to endure it he said because the Bible said I've got to endure the cross I just got to get through it I've got to endure it for their sake amen praise God so that's where the agony starts about 10:00 p.m. and memory keeps going back and he finds him sleeping he says you couldn't watch with me one hour you couldn't pray one hour he says go ahead and sleep the rest is coming Judas is coming now he's arrested about midnight according to this timeline now I I don't like staying up late you know I don't especially after fellowshipping and so Jesus he's had a very small meal there for communion and now it's midnight and he gets arrested and church where he goes next he goes to the house of Anna's now anise was the father-in-law to Caiaphas the high priest so anise was the previous high priest now what they did church the Jews broke all the laws all their laws said they're not supposed to have trials at nighttime because bad things usually happen at night right so in new in in in crus and rejecting their Messiah they broke their own laws right and church we should see the same we should see the same in our lives if we're doing things we know are wrong god help us to see that we're doing wrong praise God every every warning was there they broke this they broke that they broke that meeting after meeting after meeting they kept breaking all these rules and traditions that they had she's arrested in his first trial probably takes place about 1 a.m. and then he goes to Caiaphas now when he was at Caiaphas house that's where Peter was out in the court and my mom's been there my mom sent me pictures there and talked to me about that she just went to Israel a couple months ago as I told you and she said they have a there was a hole in Caiaphas's room where they would throw prisoners because that's why they could have trials there and so this is where I remember that Caiaphas rips his robe and he one gets him to say that he's the Messiah and Caiaphas says it's blasphemy well they start slapping and beating Jesus write to me let me just read a little bit about that so a Caiaphas house the Bible says in mark 1416 they begin to spit on him and to blindfold him and beat him and to say to him prophesy and the officer struck him with the palms of their hands now this this is interesting this doctor who wrote this article said when you're blindfolded it's even worse to get hit on the head and it's worse trauma because you can't roll with the punches you can't kind of see where they're coming from so you have no way to kind of brace yourself at all so the trauma is way worse when you're blindfolded and so Jesus gets beaten and smacked and his beard hairs ripped out by the Jews his own people his own children we'd say mine and so he's beaten and thrown in the the hole and Caiaphas's house until about 6 a.m. because Pontius Pilate would start have trials like at 6:30 or 7:00 a.m. so on Friday at 7:00 a.m. he comes before Pontius Pilate and says oh this is he's done nothing wrong he sends him off to Herod and Herod mocks him I remember we showed us a couple years ago Herod actually had more respect for John the Baptist than Christ that's what a lot of people have today they reverence brother Branham more than a reverence Jesus Christ we should honor all men and the Bible said give double honor to those who labor in the Word of God like brother random we do but we don't give worship and we give our greatest love and devotion to Jesus Christ because he's the absolute praise God amen but Herod respected the messenger more than the message praise God in church I found the quote this week where brother Bram said he said that you've got to pay attention the message he said if you focus on the messenger God will take the messenger off the scene so I wonder if that's why God took brother Brandon off the way he did was to get the people to see it's not about a man thank God for the man every man has a purpose he prevailed his purpose we thank God for that but the idea is not to get focus on a man the idea is to let Christ increase amen let the Word of God increase and we don't struggle with that here but you know some people do it's a great temptation these days so about 7:00 a.m. he comes before Pontius Pilate sent him off the hare at about 7:30 that's what I was looking at my watch a smart like mine it's seven o'clock this morning this is when Jesus would have been before Pontius Pilate I was just trying to relate to that what would that feel like sleeping in a hole in Caiaphas's if he could have slept right being beaten and the bruising the facial trauma if he even could have slept through that in a hole for at least five hours maybe more after being beaten and have a trial there right in Caiaphas's house and of course he remember he saw he saw Peter run before that trial member he looked out the crew three times he ran away and Jesus knew he was getting alone so Herod then says I can't do anything he sends them off to Pilate again about 8 a.m. and this is where Pilate for the next hour or so he tries to talk to Jesus and Jesus stops talking and then Pilate he makes he says I'm gonna wash my hands of this he keeps hearing the Jews crucify him crucify him crucify him he says who do you what we have this tradition you up gravis and they they say we want were BRABUS Jesus's own people crying out for his blood one of the saddest pictures the Biden brother Graham brings it out from the Bible there they crucified him the holiest place the holiest people the worst death and the most sweetest wonderful perfect human being praise God what a paradox my but God had to do it and so from 8 to 9 he's on triad night around 9 o'clock is where he says take him and scourge him and crucify him now let's go through this the scourging here now Jesus was beaten so bad isaiah 52:13 and 14 he said his visit was so marred more than any man from his form more than the sons of men now church here's what I believe happened Jesus said in Luke 22 Jesus said fine he said arrest me that's fine he said this is your hour and the power of darkness so what I believe church no man could ever been beaten like Christ so jesus knew this is the hour of darkness so I imagine all those demons just started filling those Roman soldiers with demonic power and beating him more and even those Jews that were beating him they beat him so much where no man had ever looked like this that's what the Bible says he was beaten and you couldn't even see the visit of a man if I was a demon remember that said he looked like a worm he said I consider myself a worm hardly a man because he hardly looked like a man jesus said this is your pop this is your hour and the power of Darkness and yet he stood why did she stood there he stood there for you and I Church let me say this he stood there for his bride he also stood there for catholics nothings Presbyterians Pentecostals brace God he stood there for the bank's of blind and Jews as well praise God Amen he stood there and he took it for all those that would repent of their sins and be honest and sincere before God he stood there to take it all praise God that he might inherit all praise God he would inherit all power and every throne in every nation and rule them with a rod of iron he stood there to do that for our sakes praise God thank the Lord so then he's flogged by the Roman guards it was that they had whips which had leather thongs on them were 18 to 24 inches long these whips and they were they had bits of metal and bone in glass embedded in the leather whips and a prisoner was usually frogged 39 times 39 times and then they said we'll be merciful we won't give you a 40 will give you 39 that was their form of mercy imagining it and whipped 39 times with bones glass and metal that's what our Lord went through how many love the Lord today praise God how many thankful he took that for us 39 times and I watched that I just watched a little bit of the passion just those in that section and those men and you can see you could picture how they would just enjoy that because the power of darkness was upon them Satan was there too poor brother and said is Satan or as brother Mannis said as Jesus carrying the cross Satan was right there watching him like a bee ready to sting him with the sting of death so no doubt Satan was there too they captured on the movie where Satan's right there watch him get beat up 39 times getting whipped over and over with rods and then with this cat of nine tails with the the glass and the metal and the whips this was the power of darkness coming up upon the Lord history says they might have even used an iron rod to beat the prisoner because there so cruel member Turks Romans didn't invent the crucifixion they didn't invent it they just perfected it the spirit of Rome would watch and they would one of the videos I watched last night said they had this this mile long stretch where they put all the crucified people so can you imagine they said I think was 800 Malakai I think we're listening to it last night anyways they had you know maybe 400 on this side 400 on that side unless one stretcher Road of course Jesus was at Gao Gotha the skull but roll was known for crucifixion they perfected it and you know just a couple hundred years after that Constantine outlawed it in honor of Christ he out loud out lava the crucifixion but it reached its height during Jesus's life in order to fulfill the scripture and so from 9:00 to 12:00 he gets crucified there at 12:00 the Bible said darkness goes over the land it was midnight in the middle the day I love that song brother Donnie Reagan church sings at midnight in the middle of the day but the band said God and everyone or God was forsaking his son and the whole earth was having a nervous prostration all the earth had to recognize that a day just when an innocent one was being slain unjustly a completely innocent person now I'm skipping ahead a little bit here but through the urging the victims back was usually shredded and exposed the underlining muscles and the skeletal structures remember they're tied up there and they're just beaten mercilessly there's a group of five men five soldiers one one was like the leader watched over the other four just took turns slicing and crushing our Lord like a rose right like we seen that song like a rose he was crushed for us severe blood loss and dehydration were happening to the Lord his bones were staring at him after the scourging the Bible said the soldiers beat him again a second time with their hands and with a read as if it wasn't enough and then they put on him the crown of thorns of course Christ had not eaten anything since the night before now it's around 9:00 9:00 to 12:00 here this three-hour process of scourging and then having him carries on cross to Gaul Gotha so now he's getting this severe dehydration and cardio respiratory failure this was all to fulfill Isaiah fifty verse six I gave my back to the spiders and my cheeks to them that plucked off the hair I hidden out my face from the shame and the spitting oh if he put up with this we can put up with our little trials can't wait that's what I love I love this time every year we get to be reminded look at what he suffered I can go through my little my light afflictions as Paul says these are just such light afflictions such light burdens he gave his back his cheeks his face he gave it for you and I praise God and the crucifixion the Persian started it around 300 BC perfected by the Romans as we said the cross Eddy was probably 75 to 125 pounds as he carried it down the way of suffering I forget the actual word for it the I can't remember it there's a certain pathway where they walk where the Crucified would walk yeah that's right and the victims of crucifixion were typically stripped naked and their clothes divided by the Roman guards that was done to fulfill Psalms 20 to 18 they divided my garments among them and for my clothing they cast lots totally naked and crucified they offered Jesus a mixture right on the cross but he turned it down why because he had to bear all of our suffering praise God he could take no wait out there in other words there was no shortcut let me say like this search our lives there'll be no shortcuts of suffering in order to have christ-like character praise God we all want to skip him right we all want to skip the the hard times and we don't want it we just want everything to happen now but that's not the way God works many times God takes us through long years of suffering in order to produce real godly character praise God amen he didn't take any of that vinegar and gall there said I must bear it all he didn't take any relief for our sins the Bible said in first Peter 2:24 who his own self bore our sins in his own body on the tree that we being dead to sins should live unto righteousness by whose stripes you were healed a man beautiful praise God because he suffered we should live so holy because of his suffering that he experienced we should be dead to sins because he died for us praise God and after that the victim was placed on his back with his arm stretched out and nailed to the cross bar these nails were about seven to nine inches long and they're placed between the bones of the forearm they're the radius and the ulna and the small bones of the hand this would keep the person on the cross and it would also sever the largest nerve called the median nerve and this severing this nerve is a medical catastrophe it brought burning pain destroyed the nerve and permanent paralysis of the hands so after the nails went through there he never moved his hands ever again until he got raised from the dead / he's God and then he showed you they showed Thomas these are my hands praise God hallelujah thank the Lord all the scripture were fulfilled and it was perfectly placed up the nails were perfectly placed so no bone was broken then his feet were nailed to the cross now this is an interesting thought but his feet were at a 45 degree angle kinda that's the 90s that's 45 it's usually that's usually not that way on the movies usually it's just feet her straight down but his feet were proud or legs were probably at a 45 degree angle and as you know he'd have to bear all of his weight with his thighs and then any of us let's you know who may be after church at your own house who would like to try to sit like this who likes to sit like this for like even one minute we had to do that in track when we were younger that's paint that's awful oh yeah Christ had a worse angle than that because at least we had a 90-degree angle he's at a 45 and the Roman way to do it was to put a little a small wooden seat by their feet so they could have something to sit on and this would excuse them a little bit of relief and allow them to live up to nine days so if they put that little piece of wood is like a little triangle piece of wood that their feet could rest on if they could put that feet under there they or that piece of there they live up to nine days but of course Jesus wasn't gonna last that long because he took the most awful beating that they'd ever could give yeah history said people live for five six seven eight nine days crucified hanging on the cross animals would get him it was just awful way to die in church you know once the once he was hanging up there his shoulders would come out of socket and the doctors say that the arms would then be six to nine inches longer than normal the wingspan would go out they can't feel his hands anymore and then out of the sockets that's why they had to have not just nails but they had ropes around him as well too because the arms get longer all right goodness pretty soon and as you know it's constant up and down constant up and down the heart is beating faster because it needs more oxygen and so the body's working harder but can never get enough oxygen pretty soon the heart begins to fail the lungs collapse and they fill up with fluid which is course why Jesus said I thirst this combination of all these things caused the death of the victim they suffocate to death oh it's also called severe cardiac stress and in this crucifixion a victims heart can even burst the muscles wood and tissues were just burst that's why it's called a cardiac rupture that's why many people say Jesus died of a broken heart it's very possible of course we know that Jesus gave up the ghost right he had to release his own spirit he knew the time and he to the right moment when to do it but it's very possible that his heart just burst now when the Romans wanted to speed it up you know they would break the legs of the victim right but in this case they come to Jesus and he's already dead at 3 o'clock because before they came he said it is finished he gave up the ghost the other victims there they had had their legs broken in order to die for the Passover so all this from 6 p.m. now to 3 p.m. the next day the most awful hours anyone could experience and he did it search for you and I for the joy that was set before him praise God this is the passion this is the suffering of the Lord Jesus Christ now I know you're probably familiar with that but I just want to go through that I thought that was just a beautiful detailed list of what our Lord went through what we're willing tomorrow we'll look at all the tomorrow I want to go through all the offerings that he fulfilled the waters of separation the five offerings the feasts Jesus fulfilled all those in one act and on those short minutes there they'll show ours he fulfilled all the scriptures by himself praise God go to Isaiah 53 let's uh let's look at Isaiah 53 then we'll get ready to finish up now I want to go over these it's been a couple it's been a year or two since I went over the numerology but I want to go back over the biblical numerology of Isaiah 53 just briefly so I'm just kind of brought that back to my memory Isaiah 53 such a beautiful chapter there are four metaphors in Isaiah 53 he has a tender plant in verse two he's as a root out of dry ground verse seven he's a lamb as a lamb to the slaughter this metaphor this is what he was like also verse seven he was as a sheep before her Shearer's is dumb so he openeth not his mouth so forth of course an Earthling number these are all earthly symbols that he represented there as he died there's six things that we did to Christ and verse two we saw him with no beauty that we would desire him that's what I remember six is the number of man second we hid our faces from him third we esteemed him not when he was despised no one stood up for him fourth we steam him stricken smitten of God and afflicted 5th all we like sheep have gone astray in verse 6 and also in verse 6 we have turned everyone to his own way six things we did there's 19 descriptions of Jesus verse 2 he had no form verse 2 he had no comeliness no Majesty or honor verse 2 no beauty verse 3 he was despised which means worthless verse 3 he was rejected of men verse 3 he's a man of sorrows verse 3 he's acquainted with grief verse 7 he was oppressed verse 7 he was afflicted verse 7 he was silent verse 8 he was taken from prison and from judgment verse 8 he was cut off from the land of the living praise God verse 9 he made his grave with the wicked and with the rich in his death verse 9 he did no violence neither was any deceit in his mouth verse 11 he experienced travail of soul verse 12 he poured out his soul unto death verse 12 he was numbered with the transgressors he bear the sin of many and he made intercession for the transgressors amen Father forgive them they don't know what they do but I believe he was called out for all of us amen because we all want to win a strait we all would have the forsook him as she praised God but he made in her session instead of selfishly asking for himself he made intercession for others hallelujah thank you lord there was five substitutes he took for you and I he's carried our grease he's carried our sickness away he carried our sorrows away oh let's not be discouraged and I praise God all of our sorrows have been carried away I praise God mental pain physical pain he took all of our wounded all of our wounds that we should have got he took all of those he took all of our stripes our bruises our wounds our blows and we're healed because of him he took all of our bruises are crushing zaur shattering brokenness he took all of our Knick wa teased our perversity our guilt and our depravity you know just yesterday the devil was battling with me he was reminding me things I did in high school that I totally forgotten about and I was so ashamed of and all I could do church was sing these songs about the wonderful cross praise God because I know I'm guilty brother bang I know I did awful things I was guilty it's a perversity I don't even like to remember but Satan tries to remember but that's where Jesus's blood brings the pardon praise God it promises forgiveness for all of our sins all of our iniquities praise God that's why we can still support Peter praise God we can still rejoice in Paul's testimony umbrella Rams testimony praise God because we would have done the same thing we were guilty we were covered in iniquities and guilt and shame but Jesus took our shame praise God he took our iniquity he took our guilt and it was all laid upon him for us praise God for things God did to his son God laid on him the iniquity of us all in verse 6 God it pleased the Lord to bruise him God bruised him God put him to grief in verse 10 and God made us saw an offering for sin for things God did to his son and lastly here there's six rewards from the father to the son number one he shall see his seed that's you and I praise God that's all the believers down through the ages he shall prolong his days amen he has the kingdom that has no end of days amen God will pleasure prosper in his in his hand praise God God's pleasure will prosper in Jesus's hand number four by his knowledge shall my righteous servant justify many he shall bear their iniquities amen he makes many righteous through his death in his suffering number five I'll divide him a portion with the great the name above all names breeze God and he shall divide the spoil with the strong that's you and I as well praise God that's right that's what the song says right let the weak say I'm strong if you feel weak tonight just say I'm strong in Christ Jesus I'm strong in his victory I'm strong in his spirit praise God he divides the spoils with the strong hallelujah oh my let me close here praise God let's go to Philippians 2 let's make this our closing scripture here before we get to communion Philippians chapter 2 how did he endure we talked about the joy but here's another simple thing how did he do it how did he go through the passion how did he go through the suffering Philippians 2 verse 5 this is the same thing job experienced in his trial Abraham Peter all trials are to bring about this attribute flip ian's 2:5 let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus who being in the form of God thought it not robbery to be equal with God I like this verse 7 but made himself of no reputation and took upon him the form of a servant and was made in likeness of men here it is verse 8 and being found in fashion as a man he humbled himself and became obedient unto death even the death of the cross how did he endure such suffering the nails the slaps the beating how do you endure through humility humility in the Greek is assigning a lower rank to be ranked below others who are honored and rewarded to humble yourself by humble living to depress yourself to have a modest opinion of oneself how is he able to endure all the physical pain and suffering the beatings whippings a casting in the in the pit he was able to her by humbling himself putting us above him I wondered tonight can we put others above ourselves heading into this Easter weekend who can we put above ourselves you know who Jesus wants us do at most our families and friends in our church remember the Bible said when you have an opportunity to do good do good especially to those of the household of faith let's stand to our feet praise God how did he do it the attribute of humbling himself how can we become more like Christ humbling ourselves placing other people above ourselves the holy one the high holy one became lower than you and I in order to save us in order to redeem us praise the Lord thank you Jesus now as we prepare for communion here let's take our Bibles here tonight let's go to first Corinthians 11 doesn't that just make grateful for all that Christ has done such a reminder that was his passion that was his suffering he kept telling them about it the prophets wrote about it for 4000 years they wrote about all these things and he endured all of it for you and I by humility he humbled himself may we see like jobs he said I repent when job got to the NDS and I repent in dust and ashes I abhor myself every example of a believer going through a trial is to keep us humble is to help us to try to find can we look to somebody else can we serve somebody else can we help somebody else instead of ourselves 1st Corinthians 11 why don't we just have her buddy come up here well I guess we got that six-feet thing right but we could all come up again there's enough room over here can we all come up here will spread out by God's grace I'm al Qaeda can you come to the piano Malik I hear [Music] you just

saying I'm gonna be broken for you this night I'm sorry the next day it was 25 after the same manner also he took the cup when he had supped saying this cup is the New Testament in my blood this to you as often as you drink it and remember to me for as often as you eat this bread and drink this cup ye do shew the Lord's death till he come wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body of the Lord without a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that Cup [Music] for he that eateth and drinketh unworthily eateth and drinketh damnation to himself not discerning the Lord's body this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep for if we would judge ourselves we should not be judged

that he come not together under condemnation and with the rest will I send order when I come praise God Church let's just bow our heads here or look to heaven and let's examine ourselves and ask Lord make us worthy that means we repent any wrongdoing if we broken the fellowship we've broken our communion with the Lord we make it right here tonight if we broken any communion with our fellow man it's not a reason for it that we decide here tonight we'll make it right nor let sin linger on won't let addictions linger on all that problems linger on we'll take care of it by the blood of Christ he can endure such pain for us we should be able to endure any shame or any humility we must go through in order to be right with God any embarrassment we should be able to overcome that because his
