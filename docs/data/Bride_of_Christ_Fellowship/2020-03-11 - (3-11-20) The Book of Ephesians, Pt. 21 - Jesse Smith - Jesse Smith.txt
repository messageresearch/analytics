God praise the Lord let's go to Ephesians chapter 5 tonight like to the continued the book of Ephesians here and just one update I forgot to let you know I did get a letter back from Joseph Branham this week so about four pages and he's you know he's standing his ground on his beliefs but he did it in real real kind of way so I will ride him back so I'm excited I'm happy about that all the great things happen this week you know with my cousin talking to him and just hearing back really encouraged me and they can sense God's love so he can he can sense it as well so that's one of the wonderful most wonderful thing when even those that you seem to be seem to be at odds with they can still sense the love of God praise the Lord so thank the Lord for that hallelujah let's go to Ephesians 5 like to look at verse 18 I kind of want to build up to next Wednesday Lord willing we'll be looking at the marriage you know because chapter 5 deals with husbands and wives I kind of want to just build up to that tonight by God's grace and perhaps maybe the my brother Simon preached on some marriage things and family things so we'll see just gonna be interesting to see how the Holy Spirit works it out praise God so Ephesians 5:18 a couple scriptures we looked at and then I like to read down to oh yeah we have a memory verse 2 yeah I'm glad I put that on there fusions 518 well for times sake let's um let's just read 20 and 21 let's see we can all read together 20 and 21 so can you skip ahead to dare acacia thank you sweetie Ephesians 5:20 and 21 and after that we'll read our memory verse there Romans 12 okay let's read that on three one two three giving thanks always for all things unto God and the Father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God let's go to Romans 12 then verse 1 and 2 12:1 and 2 Romans 12:1 and 2 let's recite that and ask the Lord to write that upon our hearts here Romans 12:1 and 2 let's begin on three one two three I beseech you therefore brethren by the mercies of God that you present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptable unto God which is your reasonable service and be not conformed to this world but be transformed by the renewing of your mind that you may prove what is that good and acceptable and perfect will of God amen let's have a word of Prayer if you have a need on your heart just make it known unto God here have any father Lord we so as we said Laura so many encouraging things this week Lord were happy to see the love of God moving in people's lives even those we disagree with Laura can recognize us as Christians and love and we thank your father thank you for the great life changing you're doing in my cousin's life Lord and continue to mold and shape our lives Lord God may we go from glory to glory then we go from faith to faith from revelation to revelation from victory to victory from footstep to footstep Lord God help us here tonight Lord God we're gathered in your holy name Jesus and we ask you to anoint us for your glory teach us Lord strengthen us help us to understand Lord most of all let us be changed Lord to be more like you father God for your prophet Paul said Lord the thing that avails is a new creature in Christ Jesus something that will prevail is Lord a person that's new a person who is refresh in the presence of God quick to obey and becomes a new creature so help us Lord tonight we love you Lord bless those that are physically gathered here thank you for their sacrifice to come out to the house of God and bless those livestreaming that are hungry and thirsting for your word in Jesus Christ's name that's her said amen god bless you me and see the praise god all right so lord we like to look at a few verses here and I want like I said I want to spend a lot of my time building up to marriage yeah you get switch over there thank you hon remember on Sunday morning we're looking at four of these things I thought were really inspired Paul says don't be drunk on wine but be filled with the spirit and the four things he mentioned are really easy things to do right as far as it's not a very hard list now it's more challenging to our flesh right but these things should be pretty easy we should be singing together in our homes right and in our churches we should be singing alone amen we should be making a joy the Bible said making a joyful noise a melody in your heart to the Lord and then we'll look out here just a moment verse 20 give thanks again it's interesting that he says it again and then Lord willing tonight we'll look at this elevating others that's a hard thing to do for a lot of people it's humility so we'll look at that Lord willing there's a lot to be said about that in scripture the Bible acts use the word submission so submit submission and submission is like you humbling yourself and it elevates others there's 40 scriptures in the New Testament but talk about submitting ourselves to other people so we won't look at a few of those tonight by the grace of God now who knows what a brother am say what is the way up how do you go up higher in God does anybody know go down right the way up is down right so if we want to get how many want to be closer to God so the way up is to go down and humble yourself when you exalt others as far as not worship them but when you when you place their needs above yours and when you encourage others say good things about others and humble yourself or find a way to serve other people that actually gets you closer to God's heart amen and so we will look at that tonight by God's grace just briefly there's a numerous scriptures when look at but let's if you got your Bibles let's go to Ephesians 5 verse 20 hopefully this week you've enjoyed that singing and felt the anointing in your life and your home you know and your work I have to you know singing together singing alone worshiping the Lord together just walking around the house or doing chores singing to the Lord and your heart it's a great victory Paul says that's a sign of walking in the spirit now of course we know church that's the anointing in the human spirit and that's the anointing we need all the time amen if you're born again you have that anointing drilling in your soul your nature it's changed you have life you have a living nature it's a little sating from your soul your will your desire is to do the will of God but we need the anointing to refresh our minds and that's how we do it we sing together we sing by ourselves and now in verse 20 he says giving thanks always for all things unto God and the father in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ now I think it's beautiful there where the Bible says giving thanks and everything did you notice earlier in the chapter and verse 4 we preached on this last week I believe last Wednesday it says neither filthiness nor foolish talking nor jesting which are not convenient but rather giving of thanks so twice in the same chapter within the same the same sort of thoughts Paul saying give thanks he says don't joke around don't say filthy things it's never convenience never good to say things like that he says give thanks and then he goes through how you need to be wise redeem the time we're walking the light redeemed the time they says give thanks he said what singing the spirit be thankful or not yes seeing spirit they says be thankful and everything amen what a way to just emphasize be thankful have you had any hard times this week so far if you have we can say thank you Lord for the hard times right he said give thanks and everything have you had any difficult interactions with friends or difficult text message have you seen anything that's kind of discouraged you maybe about the coronavirus the news about that if we've seen anything about that we should give thanks and say somehow God is going to be glorified in this remember there's a list I read you on Sunday after so every two year three years or some virus that goes through Ebola Zika you name it slime flu every couple of years we there's there's another virus but thank God every every year there's the blood of Jesus Christ amen there's healing praise God there's a mercy you know and and I just saw a Facebook post today just I was on a few seconds but it said in the time you can read a Facebook post you know maybe one coronavirus person has died but in that same time how many abortions took place how many people died from the flu how many people were killed in car accidents so we got a red take these things in the perspective and pray for mercy for all people praise God pray for mercy ask God to give us grace and wisdom and protection protect our loved ones and protect our nation protect our our people protect our families you know we should be constantly praying but in everything give thanks for this is the will of God in Christ Jesus so twice our mouths are made to give thanks praise God remember we read that quote on Sunday where brother BAM said he told the person battling with nervousness and anxiety put a smile on your face he said don't let a frown come upon your face give thanks and the Holy Spirit will give you a victory over that spirit amen uh-huh what a blessing amen and this week I've been careful to smile more Irishmen smiling at the kids more at school I've been smiling more at adults you know I'm just trying to put on a smile even when I don't feel like it I just kind of felt it I've got to keep that frown off I got to keep the anger and the worry and the fear we've got to just keep that off and choose to be thankful because that's what pleases the Lord amen he said is the will of God so we want to walk in the spirit we got to sing we got to be with the Saints we got to sing with the Saints and we got to give thanks and this is a sign of the anointing in the human spirit praise God now the word thanks means expressing gratitude and always this is why you know I'm not on Facebook very much because a lot of times on Facebook it's a good and bad you know you get good to get bad but I try at least on my page and my wife I know we always try to just be happy about things so just talk about good things I've never yet done one political post to make anybody look bad I don't plan starting anytime soon because the Bible says we should give thanks in all things you notice a lot of my facebook posts start with thankful to Lord for this I'm thankful for the Lord to that I don't want to say anything negative if I have something negative I need to go talk to that person or talk to the Lord about it praise God now there's times course we got to preach on sin but here the Bible tells us give thanks and everything give thanks not some things but in all things and then give the thanks unto God and the father in the name of the Lord Jesus that's all that's what I taught the kids at school I said if you do an Instagram post or if you do a Facebook post can you poke can you post that in the name of Jesus Christ can you post that to the Father in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so I want to make sure that my text messages and my phone calls I can say all of them in the name of Jesus Christ thanking the father it's a great it's a great lesson to keep in mind if we want to walk in the spirit we've got to praise God we got a worship dog I love God from our hearts and we have to be thankful and make sure everything we say is expressing our gratitude to God amen and even if even if we get criticized when you say thank the Lord if they're right well then thank you Lord for correcting me if they're wrong say praise the Lord that God so thought God thought so much of my walk that you let the enemy persecute me I hate him head brace God thank the Lord because well Graham said God loves to test his children I remember that quote he loves to do it because he loves the scene he knows how they're gonna respond they're gonna respond with the right spirit praise God we respond in victory they responded by overcoming by the blood of the Lamb and the word of their testimony he loves the testa's children hey man how do you yeah and I'll tell you about more about today behind quiet an attack today I had such an attack today that my felt I thought my heart was gonna get pump out of my shirt because I was criticized a little bit today but I'll tell you about it more Lord willing in the future but as things go about their their course I'll stay like that so in everything we can give thanks because God wants to see us recognize that God is the head over every situation God's not surprised by our difficult situations God knew all about it God allowed it and God's gonna bring us through it praise God amen so he wants to see that we have that same faith at the same God that was with us in their last trial is the same God who's gonna be with us in this trial so we should still sing we should still give thanks we should still act like a Christian act like a son or daughter of God and not a sinner right we should act like a real child of God and this is how real children of God act they give thanks they worship and they praise the Lord because they know God is in control praise God and God will not be mocked whatever a man reaps that will he so praise God and if we're if for I'm sorry we're sewing I'm sorry that was he so is that will he reap if we're sewing worship hallelujah if we're sewing singing if we're sowing seeds of Thanksgiving we're gonna reap great fruit of the Spirit praise God that's right amen thank the Lord now this is I got two more major points I wanted to spend the rest of my time on I know I said that kind of early but that's true I do want to spend my most of my time with the next verse I want to spend the rest of the time on here before we get to 22 now in 21 the Bible says submitting yourselves one to another in the fear of God so if we want to walk in the spirit we got to sing we got to give thanks we got to sing it from our hearts with people we got to give thanks and then we have to elevate others or humble ourselves now here's per me little dry throat here's the Greek definition of submission it means to be subordinate to obey to be under obedience to put under subdue to be subject to to submit yourself rather simple definitions right Paul says submit yourselves one to another okay so what does that mean George it doesn't mean that we owe that only you only submit to the pastor no no we submit one to another right it goes from Pastor to the congregation and then from husband to wife and sometimes children to parents right you submit like if you're wrong you should submit and say you're wrong praise God but if you're right be humble about it but be right right because we're all gonna make mistakes we're all gonna fall short of the glory of God program says you know you'll never go to a perfect Church right you'll never you'll never be a perfect human being we want to be we strive to be well you'll never be perfect in that of yourself so the Bible says we submit ourselves unto others and why do we do it we do it in the fear of God now that word fear means alarm or fright or terror so we obey others when when it's right we we put ourselves under obedience to others because we fear God so we have a healthy fear of God we are frightened at the power of Jesus Christ are we not we are we send in great terror of his power because we know our lives and all lives are held in his hand how many realize you're not guaranteed tomorrow the Lord could take me home tomorrow he could take you home tomorrow he could take anyone and think of the ones you love the most your family he could take any of those home tomorrow and he would be right in doing it if it was his time right you know went to a few Monday for sister Marion she was 74 yet people were weeping and crying because they thought it was too early but Church God knows the right time and don't get me wrong when our loved ones passed we all should mourn right and not mourning because we don't know where they are but mourning because we lost their fellowship right we but but the Bible said precious in the sight Lord is the death of the saints you should have heard some of the testimonies while we were there one of them was all the people that got married like my wife and I this sister drove three hours across the state and she only knew us for maybe a year and come to our wedding reception we were my wife and I were poor I'm not gonna say dirt poor but we were pretty poor but she brought three or three or four huge containers maybe 20 pounds of rice to our wedding reception and basically paid for most of our wedding reception this woman that passed away she was such a saint there was a couple brothers there that visited a couple weeks a couple of shows a couple of months probably a year ago brother visited his name was Isaac and he and his friends would go get drunk and have sand parties and they'd be covered in beaten in beach sand and everything like that and the house they would go to coming home would be that sister's house her and her husband because they were so loving they were rank sinners now these men were rank sinners then their drunken and smoking weed and every all the smells all over them and they would walk in her house and she would care for them she would feed them soup she'd help them to change give him a clean set of clothes to change into he said she would even tuck them into bed and pray for them and they're still coming down from there hi and this just was at one time it was time and time and time again you want to talk about a saint you want to talk about someone who's who who has patience and has the fruit of the Holy Spirit and he's and he started crying his name is Isaac he started crying right there we're outside just all the kid running around he's crying he said and she never removed me one time she and her husband Bill pray for me they just prayed for me now what was she doing she was elevating others above herself praise God and she and he said because of the love of her and the love of Jesus Christ all their prayers he eventually gave his heart to Lord because of the way he was treated by these people he knew and he knew he was wrong what he was doing he heard the word even his wife you know he was one that this guy was married in fact during some of the times he was getting drunk like this with children and even that he knew he was wrong he saw the love of Jesus Christ through this sister and the kindness of God led him to repentance amen what a saint and people think they can't do anything for God your whenever you elevate others whenever you serve others you're doing something for God remember the greatest among you is not the the smartest the greatest among you is the servant those who concern I told that brother I said there's gonna be a lot of surprise on Judgment Day the people we thought were great and the people who God sees are great it's those who serve it's those who humble themselves now she never said it was okay to smoke to get drunk she never said what she did she just served them and showed them love and another thing was the one of the Deacons there told me every service she put a prayer request and said Saints please pray for my children to be saved and won I won they're not all say but one by one they got saved over the years there's just a couple more left to be saved amen and the the Deacon even admitted he said sometimes mother Jesse I struggle with that like why would you put it in every week and why but he said I realize it was her faith she was overcoming any doubt and unbelief and just trusting in the Living God and making her requests made known unto God and look what God did praise God they can look back at it now decades later ten years so we mean to be encouraged let's keep praying that's not telling a case you know all her prayers for adamant and all these children all of our prayers for Adam now we can see the fruit of it praise God we haven't seen it yet but I believe we will see it praise God eight months without getting drunk eight months without going back to drugs and listen about Brannen and praying and going to church and and reading his Bible and and to see all these prayers that we thought were they ever heard of course they were heard amen hallelujah and so we need to take these testimonies and be encouraged right and give thanks amen and find ways that we can serve others now with most of us it's with our families if we can serve just our families that will teach us the humility we need praise God on a daily basis just to serve just to keep investing just to keep humbling ourselves and just to lift up others and help out others praise God amen glory see we do it in the fear of God because we respect God we know God can take away your life at any moment we can know God can pull our car any moment we know God doesn't play around right we know God can he can strike us he can strike someone with a sickness he could strike someone with a car accident as a test he can allow it right he can allow it as a test so we understand the fear of the Lord and that's how that's the only way we can elevate others is when we remember how great God is in the fear of the Lord submit yourselves to others in the fear of the Lord because you know how great God is remember if John said if you can't love the people if you can't submit and serve the people that you can see you can't serve the god that you can't see right if you can't love and humble yourself and serve the people you see you'll never serve God because you can't see him right so we have to be able to serve those that we can see and then that proves we truly serve God now I want to look at there's at least 1 2 3 4 5 6 examples about serving others so let's look at this real quick if you got your Bibles let's go to Roman's of 13 might want to just that's right now Romans 13 I was gonna might want to keep your place but you know we probably will go back to Ephesians Romans 13:1 now as we read us remember Paul's writing this to Christians in the Roman government or I'm starting the Roman society Roman society look at verse 1 then every soul be subject unto the higher powers for there's no power but of God the powers that be are deigned of God so let's just stop for a moment the powers in America ordained of God and most the time we're thankful for it God ordained the government that we have in America thank God because people prayed for it they fasted for it when we went through that in history the first few presidents called prayer and fasting days Abraham Lincoln called prayer and fasting days thank God for our government praise God he said let every soul not just some every soul obey the higher powers who sever therefore resisteth the power resisteth the ordinance of God and they that resist shall receive to themselves damnation now what does even Paul says if you can't obey the natural laws damnation is going to come upon you verse 3 for rulers are not a terror to good works but to the evil will thou then not to be afraid of the power do that which is good and thou shalt have praise of the same you know you got to be careful with people that speak bad about police officers right I know there's some corrupt ones there's a lot of Krupp preachers there's a lot of corrupt moms there's a lot of Krupp dads right but if someone is keep attacking the government they don't understand what they're saying as far as the the godly laws they've got the wrong idea they're in a bad spiritual condition someone's like like I said there's bad cops there's bad teachers I know there's bad teachers in our school system no doubt about it but if you do do good you don't fear the powers because you're under the law of Liberty memory looked at that last week you're under the law of Liberty and so apologist says if you can't obey man's law you're gonna be damned by God's law that's right look at verse four four he's the minister of God to thee for good speaking of leaders on the earth but if thou do that which I'm sorry yeah nobody thought do that which is evil be afraid for he beareth not the sword in vain for he is the minister of God a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doeth evil so obviously sometimes God pours out his judgments through the laws of the land a lot of those people in jail deserve to be in jail right some of the sentences they get they deserve it because of the evil of the law of man they wouldn't obey the law of man but the law of man was based on the law of God right with drugs and violence and and and abuse and all these things that's based upon God's law and if they won't obey man's law God's God's law is gonna catch him eventually so did you see him let every soul be subject so we got to humble ourselves humble ourselves to law I've seen it with this too a lot of people will speak evil the speed limit laws you ever seen a message person do that they'll speak evil about the and think they can speed and break the laws that's wrong that's the wrong attitude they shouldn't they shouldn't go against the laws of the land like I said I go five miles per hour over all right we say five is Grace but if people speak evil of that like if they speak evil of our leaders and evil the laws it shows they're in a wrong spiritual condition speak evil cops enforcers of the law Paul says they're damned if they do this they don't obey God's laws on earth or man's laws rather he said they'll be damned verse five wherefore he must needs be subject not only for wrath but also for conscience sake so see people will walk around in message churches and they'll have an evil conscience on their conscience because they know they're not obeying the law of the land like they don't report all the money they made on taxes that's the evil conscience right they don't drive the right speed limit that's an evil conscience and you watch it and I just want let me read this quote here by God's grace I found a good quote today it's in from the sermon enticing spirits 1955 he said amongst a lot of people we find where emotions and so forth there comes paddling's and backbiting ever seen that the church backbiting to the church and all kind of ungodly things brother that soul fork acid in the church it's demon power so when people are gossiping about others and backbiting and making them look bad to other people in the church he said that's demon power spirit of men and women who get among one another and try to push off and say this one's not right and that one's not right and that one's not right so brother I'm saying if somebody's in the church saying that person is wrong that and they're making everybody else look bad to try to make themselves look good program said that's a demon power and it goes on to say if you'll chain times out of 10 it's the very person making the stir that's not right with God he said amen God hates this cord among brethren so church let's watch watch our church watch other churches see who's making stirs about other people publicly right and see who's trying to make peace with everybody because he said 9 times out of 10 the person who's backbiting and speaking evil about people in the church they're the ones who are not right with God all right that's true be Reverend be holy love God stand by him as long as your life is giving up with the Bible with purity of heart purity of thought love towards your brother trying your best to up build the kingdom of God and doing those things dressing right living right talking right going the right places then you can have all the motions you want to and everyone will believe it he said Jesus said you're the salt of the earth amen thank that are mine he said if you be salty the world will be thirsty you get salty they'll be thirsty oh my so see church look and see who's condemning others and look and see who's building others up saying nice things about people that's what the scrip says conscience see people's conscience they it weighs on them those demons if they're in people's lives they're not if they're not confess and cast out those demons will start attacking other people so always watch who is the one accusing someone else who started the accusation nine times out of ten is the person who's got the wrong spirit and then watch who is watch who is communicating with love because when you really love somebody you want to correct them you're gonna come across in a kind way then the Bible say that we're tender-hearted and weary preach on that last week don't speak wrath things the Bible said but be tender-hearted forgiving people from your hearts watch how someone tries to bring correction oh thank you Jesus why because we fear God if I got the wrong attitude God's not gonna let me get away with that he's gonna correct me right same thing for all of us if we plant the wrong seeds we're gonna reap the whirlwind right so why do we live why do we humble ourselves because we fear God we know God is watching us what a great lesson so now you look and see the legal part of your life you have to humble yourself to the law let me tell lose it again here maybe another way god help us if if we know we're breaking the law then god help us to make it right praise God if we know we're breaking the law may the conviction of the Holy Spirit come so strongly on any of us if we're breaking the law that will go back and and do what's right or else then what good is what good is trying to serve God if we can't obey these natural laws however use of the spiritual law of working in the holy spirit and signs miracles and wonders how we can ever get there we're not only going to get there if we keep the little things right and if you can trust us with the little things then you can trust us with the more responsible things praise God this is also in first Peter 2:13 so I'm going to turn there first Peter 2:13 first Peter 2:13 now it says this submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the lord's sake whether it be to the king as supreme or unto governors as unto them that are sent by him by the punishment of evildoers and for the praise of them that do well for so for so is the will of God that with well doing you may put to silence the ignorance of foolish men right so Paul Peter says by obeying the laws of the land the sinners don't have a chance to bring reproach upon Christ they'll say wow that brother obeys the law that sister honors man that's just that brother obeys man he humbles himself the man amen Peter said humble yourself to the laws of man for God's sake amen what you have thought about Jesus have become breaking all the laws people would not a thought he was very good right we would not thought he wasn't very holy but he came and kept all the laws praise God he broke all the Pharisees man-made traditions but he kept the law of God and he kept the law of man amen hallelujah of course we should break man-made denominational laws hallelujah thank the Lord so Peter says submit to the government for God's sake now let's go to another one here first Corinthians 16 16 I want you to see in the scripture I think it's more powerful don't you when you see it yourself and we get to just look at it I think it's more powerful phrase God now it's kind of difficult to understand the verse 16 let's go up to 15 I beseech you brethren you know the house of stephanas that it is the firstfruits of achaia and that they have addicted themselves to the ministry of the saints so it seems like this house of stephanas is busy serving the people of god that's hard to know how exactly they're ministering there but let's go to verse 16 that you submit yourselves unto such unto everyone that help with with us and laborious they go to 17 I'm glad of the coming of stephanas and fortunatus and aquellas for that which was lacking on your part they have supplied for they have refreshed my spirit and yours therefore acknowledge me them that are such okay so somehow they're meeting the needs of Paul and the other believers now perhaps they were meeting the physical needs right perhaps they were feeding the poor perhaps they were feeding the poor Christians maybe they were paying their rent or helping him out with their bills right maybe here the Bible said just refreshing them fellowship with them giving their time maybe doing Bible studies Paul said he said submit yourselves to the house of stephanas maybe they're having Church in his house right because there was other people that had churches in their house like Aquila and Priscilla they had a church in their house so Paul says submit yourself to the house of stephanas maybe he was the pastor maybe he wasn't but he said Oh in other words obey them if they ask you to do something obey submit yourself so now we can see two areas you submit in the area of government and you submit you're at yourself to your brothers and sisters praise God in Christ submit yourself they're trying to serve other people they're trying to help people submit yourself and serve others now the way that you and I might see it is if we're talking after church on a Sunday right because that's when we see most of the saints you talk to somebody and you find out they need help so the way to minister to them is to say can I call you up and talk about this how can I help you out with some food or can help you out somehow find a way we can minister and serve others and meet the needs of others it's a great way to do it or you find out someone from another church needs help or they're their mother and father that don't even go to our church is it a isn't it a godly thing if we can help out somebody who doesn't go to our church yes submit the body say submit yourselves to that house submit yourself to the leadership of these believers who are serving the city the Corinthians submit yourselves what I've seen it like when we first come in the message you know the church he went to his Lima Bible believers but there was a little gathering there and every Saturday night at one of the brothers houses we would go and have church service there now here's just a little example when you go to somebody's house you want to be a good guest right we would have Church Church in their house they clean out their their living room so we could have service they put a pulpit in their chairs now what kind of guest would we have been if they said can you take your shoes off at the door said no I'm keeping my shoes on I don't wear holy we don't take our shoes off in church well if you're in somebody else's house submit yourself right or how'd you feel of you wet in their bathroom and then just the you know just left some toilet paper on the floor left your tissue on the for you or just you made it all dirty you should humble yourself right serve that person clean up their bathroom form right he's saying submit yourself to the house of stephanas because they're ministering to the city so whatever that's a good example when I went there if they asked me could you could you move your car and park somewhere else we don't get upset humble yourself right and think of any way you can humble yourself and honor other people of course in those days they'd have cars but can you move your chariot or something you know just find a way to humble yourself to other Christians obey the government and try to humble yourself to other Christians a real question Christian who walks in the spirit submits themselves to other Christians when that when they can now let's go to another one Philippians 2:3 this is why we do it flip Ian's to three Philippians 2:3 relations Ephesians Philippians Colossians so Philippians 2:3 now here's a believer or here's Paul writing about having the mind of Christ how many want the mind of Christ tonight you want to think just like Jesus that's what he's talking about verse to fulfill you my joy that you be like-minded having the same love being of one Accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vainglory so don't do anything on purpose to kind of rattle the other guy's nerves right don't do anything for your glory okay so don't try to just ruffle somebody's feathers you ever see that I've seen it people try to ruffle their feathers on purpose to kind of get under their skin Paul says don't do that he said don't do things for vain glory to lift yourself up take the mind of Christ verse two having the same love being of one Accord of one mind let nothing be done through I'm sorry verse 4 look not every man on his own things but every man also on the things of others I've seen people that in our church that have had moving expenses to move from one place to another and I've seen Christians go up and give them money to help them out here at our church that's a good thing to do submit yourselves right help them out you know somebody's struggling find a way to help them out if you can just help somebody move right just help somebody move from their old house to new house you don't do it for money but just do something nice that can I help you out you need any help with that look to everyone else's needs and see how you can help them out now that's a real Christian life let this mind be in you which was also in Christ Jesus submit yourselves one to another he says in the fear of God so this is why you do it you esteem others better than yourselves and that doesn't mean like oh there are better Christian in me no you just esteem their needs better they need this meant more than I need my needs met they're not a better person or I'm not the worst person but I feel like I need to help them out more than I need to help myself out so does it mean we think oh they're a better person mean it doesn't mean you give yourself a pity party right and beat yourself up because remember about have said it's true you and I are only as strong as our confession if you say I'm a miserable Christian if I say I'm a weak Christian I'm gonna act like one so there's a part of that where we have to confess I'm strong in the Lord I'm gonna put on the full armor of God I don't maybe I maybe didn't have the great best start today but I'm gonna take the shoot of faith I'm gonna take the sort of spirit and I'm gonna praise in the heart I'm going to change the atmosphere I'll be strong today praise God it's not like oh they're wise virgin I'm a foolish that's that's not what we're talking about here we're not we're not to do that but mother says you're all set you're supposed to have the kind of faith that if anybody's going the rapture in this city it's gonna be me and that's not that's not in Pride but that's in that's in confidence right that's an expectation Lord I'm I look at my life and I'm so sincere if one person is gonna make it let it be me praise God in other words you are so pressing on toward the mark of the high calling in Christ that you know you're selling out you've surrendered everything and you're not trying to be better than other people but if one person is gonna make it I'm gonna press toward the mark I'm gonna lay aside every weight and I'm gonna be the one who achieves the prize amen but not that I'm better than that person a church like you and I understand we go to work and I mingle with the people I'm no better than them but I can obey God better than them but I'm not no better than them right because my life is a vapor - I get weak I get tired I get headaches I get cranky I fall short of God's glory - I'm not better than them far as the value of there's there so um no better but I do want to serve the moment to humble themselves I can please God and I can be a better Christian than I was yesterday praise God but we don't do anything through strife or I'm gonna get back at them or vainglory to make myself look good we don't do that that's not the Spirit of Christ that's already about 40 minutes already set my timer here so let me just give me ten more here I'll try to preach 50 minutes by God's grace now let's read another scripture real briefly here where was it yeah that girthy and 7-1 this is for real familiar Saint Corinthians 7:1 now this is about the fear of God number we talked about that submit yourselves to each other in the fear of God sinker these seven one says having therefore these promises dearly beloved let us cleanse ourselves from all filthiness of the flesh and spirit perfecting holiness in the fear of God so see we've got two daily cleanse ourselves in the fear of God and then we submit to our submit to others in the fear of God as well so in both of these things we see how great God is we see how powerful God is and because of how great is because we fear him we're gonna serve others and we're gonna try to live a more Clinton or clean life every day now tell you my video on the morning routine has not been very popular and I was a little surprised but then afterwards I wasn't kind of like well not many people want to really seek God in the morning so most people aren't gonna click on that they're gonna click on something that's not they'll click on something that shows where someone else is wrong but not themselves that's true that's true people are quick to click on all what's wrong with them what's wrong with them now how about you and Italian up to God's Word oh my I see fearing God is a requirement to go up the stature of a perfect man because you're perfecting holiness in the fear of God we must fear God the people that really fear God are gonna live a more holy life because they perfect holiness in the fear of God because they know God's power and his laws they fear God so they obey God so they clean out their lives more and more and more because they want to please God and because of that and the fear of God they submit themselves they humble themselves and sometimes they'll always they'll hum of themselves to the government when it's when it's with the word go home of themselves to church members and they'll humming themselves to church leaders here's what we see next Hebrews 13:17 I've read this a couple times over the last few years Hebrews 13:17 17 the Bible says obey them that have the rule over you and submit yourselves for they watch for your souls as they that must give account that they may do it with joy and not with grief for that is unprofitable for you okay so now we've seen three levels you submit yourself to the government you submit yourselves to other Christians and the third ones you submit yourself to the pastor right submit yourselves to the Deacons now we don't have deacons here I'm the only Deacon here but you submit yourselves to Christians to the church leaders and you submit yourself to the government praise God and then now you submit yourself set older believers now this is just not just believers but the older believers who've been around longest serving the Lord that's in 1st Peter 5:5 1st Peter 5:5 verse 5 likewise he younger younger younger submit yourselves unto the elder yay all of you be subject one to another and be clothed with humility for God resists the proud God is working against the prideful but he giveth grace to the humble hey hey Alleluia thank the Lord God is resisting he's fighting against the proud but he gives grace he gives more favor to the humble so see now there's I think there was four levels there submit to the government submit to other Christians who have ministries submit to the leaders in the church and then submit to the oldest believers who have been serving God the longest in the church all these areas especially the younger ones right young children submit yourselves to the older Christians now only if it's in the will of God I had somebody come up a couple years ago and I was preaching about and they missed totally misunderstood it and I tried to correct them I don't know if they ever received or not they come up and questioned me afterwards in this room you know and but they were saying how I was saying I read a quote where brother Adam says if someone does you wrong go ahead let him do you wrong a humble yourself and take it and they tried to make it sound like I was saying that children should be allowed themselves to get hit by adults never never never we never submit to sin we only submit to obedience and children if anybody hurts you let me know right away I'll go talk to them right do not let anyone hurt you now if they're correcting you by the word that's different right but nobody should touch the children except their parents and the parents that have to do it with godliness as well they have to bring the rod but they shouldn't it doesn't go over to oh it doesn't go overboard right so many times shirts were misunderstood when we say submit yourself home of yourself we're not saying it's okay to be abused never abuse is never right never we're saying let don't always be selfish right never be selfish go along with the leadership of older Christians go along with the leadership of the pastor the Deacons go along with the leadership of the government as long as it lines up with God's Word but children no one should ever hurt you do you children understand no one should ever hurt you your parents have to discipline you but that shouldn't go into hurting you by abuse or anything that's right so please don't misunderstand that when we say submit doesn't mean get abused and get hurt that's not what it means it means humble yourself too I say like this humble yourself to die out to your will and do someone else's will as long as it lines up with God's will praise God see submission to others is a sign of wisdom because the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom right and you submit yourselves in the fear of the Lord so only the wise will do these things only the wise will sing together with the spirit only the wise will sing from their hearts only the wise will give thanks and everything and only the wise will submit themselves to other Christians because it's a sign of wisdom as we read earlier in the chapter now let's read the next first let's go ahead and stand and musician you can come here let's read the last verse patience 5:22 visions 5:22 Lord willing next Wednesday we'll begin looking at this if the Lord would help us seasons 5 22 wives submit yourselves unto your own husband's as unto the Lord let's read verse 25 husbands love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it now it's hard to tell church it's hard to tell how powerful these words are but if you live in Ephesus when Paul wrote this this and you would and you were a sinner beforehand this would have been like red lights shocking you right I'll say like this if you were a sinner if you were a sinner read this it would've been like what cuz we'll see it next week the culture was so different than today women and children were treated like dogs in this society men had all the unquestionable power men could have their children done away with I'll just say it like that just if they wanted to have their whites done away with men had all the power because they were sinners they were in the and some of the grossest sins and I won't go into details next week but we'll look at just a few details but to try to understand this this command Paul saying if you got the Spirit of Christ women will submit to the husbands and then husbands will love their wives and then the children will submit to the parents this was a culture shaking teaching it was hard to understand but how could they submit themselves they could submit themselves to others because they submit themselves to Christ and because they saw Christ submit himself unto God praise God let's just play that humble thyself in the side of the Lord let's play there then we'll choose a but that song we sing that when I want you as weas we choose the fear of the Lord now as we close tonight let's think about that let's meditate on that submission elevating others my prayer for tonight is that the Lord would open my eyes to see who I can serve more and I'll stop putting my eyes on myself and put my eyes on other people and just find simple ways that I can go serving other people how can I help them how can I obey the government better right how can i how can I honor the elders in our church how can I help someone's ministry in our church let's pray and meditate on that and ask the Lord to show us how can we submit to one another here praise God let's bow our heads here Heavenly Father we love you tonight we thank you for

you receive her in the lord has become a Saints and that you assist her and whatsoever business she hath need of you for he she hath been a sucker of many and of myself also this was unheard of in the city of Rome for all the men to see how I can help out a sister named Phoebe this is unheard of any sinner would have walked in there and said oh I'm not going to submit myself to Phoebe she's a woman she don't even can't even go to the courthouse she's just nothing better than a slave she's a dog but Paul say you men even you men humble yourself receive our sister humble yourself lift her up she's helped out many people even me and you try to find a way to help her in her business of serving other people I know what the gospel does the gospel takes the low and brings them up to the same level as everybody else see the gospel of Jesus Christ will raise you up praise God oh if you can humble yourself to Christ he'll lift you up praise God amen I love the gospel of Jesus Christ praise God he said the greatest among you be the servants as we close this bar heads and ask God to help us to assist people to help people just to be a blessing to be a servant any little way we can Heavenly Father we love you thank you for this eternal love letter this Bible your God it was written in heaven before I was written on earth because you for knew the events and you made a plan this great plan

dear god help us to submit ourselves and assist others dear God show us how we can help somebody Lord God just in humble simple ways to your Lord that our faith can grow and we could become more of a

person who hears about the moving expenses and helps him out with a little check the person had that lunch money but they help not for lunch God help us to be servants one for another help us have the mind of Christ submitting one to another in the fear of God help us to realize how powerful this is more godly the Christian the Christian faith empower us I pray with humility in Jesus Christ's name
