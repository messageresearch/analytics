[0:00] second samuel chapter 23 please ii
[0:03] samuel chapter 23
[0:04] i'd like to continue this thought on
[0:08] god's mighty men yesterday today forever
[0:19] second samuel 23 by the grace of god
[0:22] verse 15
[0:23] second example 23 15.
[0:36] oh
[0:46] 23 15.
[0:53] quite a beautiful story of course this
[0:55] is before david was king you know he was
[0:56] in the process of
[0:58] running for his life as a fugitive
[1:00] hunted down by his own father-in-law his
[1:02] own father-in-law hunting him down
[1:05] so some of us can relate to that maybe
[1:06] our in-laws or our
[1:08] parents don't like us so much
[1:10] but we're still standing on the word of
[1:12] god hallelujah
[1:14] second samuel 23 15 through 17.
[1:22] i'll read 15 16 then we can all read
[1:25] 17
[1:26] together and david longed and said oh
[1:29] that one would give me drink of the
[1:31] water of the well
[1:33] of bethlehem
[1:35] which is by the gate
[1:38] and the three mighty men break through
[1:40] the hosts of the philistines
[1:43] and drew water out of the well of
[1:45] bethlehem
[1:47] that was by the gate
[1:49] and took it and brought it to david
[1:52] nevertheless he would not drink thereof
[1:55] but poured it out unto the lord
[1:58] let's read verse 17 one two three
[2:01] and he said be it far from me o lord
[2:05] that i should do this is not this the
[2:09] blood of the men that went in jeopardy
[2:12] of their lives
[2:13] therefore he would not drink it
[2:16] these things did these three mighty men
[2:19] amen let's have a word of prayer again
[2:21] let's ask the holy spirit to minister to
[2:22] us this morning
[2:24] father god in heaven we're just grateful
[2:25] to be in your house today lord there's
[2:27] no other place we'd rather be lord than
[2:28] worshiping you with saints of light
[2:31] precious faith lord we're already caught
[2:32] up into the heavenly places the bible
[2:34] says we're seated in christ in heavenly
[2:37] places so father thank you god for
[2:39] raising our minds away from the things
[2:41] of the world and our minds are elevated
[2:43] on heavenly things as we're just saying
[2:45] our hearts are full of praise our hands
[2:47] up our hearts are full of praise
[2:49] hallelujah to the lamb of god we worship
[2:51] you we love you today we know you're
[2:52] alive in our hearts oh god we know your
[2:55] physical body sits on the throne in
[2:56] heaven so we lord we rejoice in that
[2:59] father god we're thankful for all you've
[3:01] done and we ask that the holy spirit
[3:02] would speak through the word of god just
[3:04] use my lips oh god lord just take my
[3:06] thoughts i just lay them aside lord and
[3:08] just let your thoughts flow god that
[3:10] your people can receive your word
[3:12] receive your truth be strengthened
[3:14] thereby make us lord mighty in relying
[3:17] upon you lord god make us
[3:20] men and women that are mighty in the
[3:21] word of god help us lord god today and
[3:24] we will give you thanks and praise o god
[3:26] minister to each and every need we pray
[3:27] in jesus christ's name and saint said
[3:30] amen god bless you being seated praise
[3:32] god
[3:37] i want to start with this question and
[3:39] then hopefully by the end
[3:42] we can answer it by god's
[3:44] grace most of us are christians here
[3:47] most of us
[3:48] believe in the word of god
[3:51] and uh
[3:54] i just want to start with this question
[3:56] is it possible
[3:58] for god to use you
[4:00] to make
[4:01] someone else
[4:03] more mighty
[4:05] than god has already made that person
[4:08] is that possible because what joy when
[4:10] you what honey
[4:12] i just want to start with that question
[4:13] we'll answer by the end
[4:15] because we're going to look at a mighty
[4:16] sister at the end of this sermon today
[4:18] by god's grace most of the time when you
[4:20] hear mighty men you don't think of
[4:22] mighty women right
[4:24] and we know we're using old testament
[4:26] types we're using the old testament
[4:27] types of mighty warriors
[4:29] to help us to understand what kind of a
[4:31] mighty person is a christian supposed to
[4:34] be today
[4:35] it can be more than a man it can be a
[4:37] woman right it can be a teenager it can
[4:38] be a child
[4:39] any person who's following the leading
[4:41] of the holy ghost can be a mighty person
[4:43] today praise god
[4:45] and it doesn't have to do with physical
[4:47] strength it has to do with spiritual
[4:49] strength amen and so that's the question
[4:51] i want to start with this question is it
[4:53] possible i put a little hint down there
[4:55] jesus said with god nothing shall be
[4:58] impossible amen
[5:00] there's a little hit for you by god's
[5:01] grace and i know it's a little smaller
[5:03] and here today we're missing you know
[5:05] quite a few people today but uh we're
[5:07] thankful for god's grace and let's just
[5:08] zero in with god's
[5:10] word let's be encouraged today praise
[5:12] god this remember this series you know
[5:13] the purpose of this short those series
[5:16] is to increase our faith in god so he
[5:18] can work mightily in our lives praise
[5:20] god
[5:21] and yes we want to see mighty miracles
[5:23] but we also want to see the mighty power
[5:25] of god in our daily lives amen and
[5:28] that's kind of what we're going to focus
[5:29] on today uh by god's grace because
[5:31] church we know this if we focus on the
[5:33] little things that we can be mighty in
[5:35] trusting in god every day then these
[5:37] other mighty things will happen
[5:38] automatically yes
[5:40] right like i was thinking about a few
[5:42] years ago i think it was 2018 when i
[5:43] took 2019 when i took lydia to that
[5:47] that banquet there in pennsylvania and i
[5:49] saw brother brian hawkins
[5:51] and he was almost crying and saying you
[5:53] know god or no the doctors told him he's
[5:56] got to have both hips replaced he was 45
[5:58] years old
[5:59] and something just came over me i just i
[6:00] still just some like boldness came over
[6:02] me i just felt like the holy spirit came
[6:04] on me
[6:05] and i said brother you shouldn't have to
[6:07] have your hips replaced
[6:10] and uh i said have you confessed all
[6:12] your sin he said yes i said let's pray
[6:14] for
[6:15] your hips that they'll be made well now
[6:17] his hips were degenerating there was
[6:20] hips do not heal themselves
[6:22] now certain parts of your body can heal
[6:23] themselves right but hips do not heal
[6:25] themselves
[6:26] but something just came over me and i
[6:28] said brother let's speak life i said get
[6:29] your pastor let's go get brother jim he
[6:31] was here last week
[6:32] i said let's pray for those hips and i
[6:34] just spoke life to them right i spoke a
[6:36] life through those hips three days later
[6:38] i was i was working outside you know
[6:40] weeding the garden or whatever and i got
[6:42] a text from him saying you know the
[6:44] doctor got a new mri and he said we
[6:47] don't know how it happened but your hips
[6:48] heal themselves praise god
[6:50] that's just an example of you know
[6:52] just serving god every day loving god
[6:54] every day just trusting in god
[6:57] just winning everyday battles amen
[6:59] amen win the battle being a christian
[7:01] every day and then god will do mighty
[7:03] things in our lives amen amen just as
[7:05] we're just going about our regular
[7:07] christian life you know there'll be
[7:08] certain moments
[7:10] there's god god's going to make you
[7:11] known for something right god's going to
[7:13] give you a reputation right like david
[7:15] is known for slaying goliath and the
[7:17] queen of the south was known for
[7:18] crossing uh the desert in order to
[7:20] support solomon god's going to give you
[7:22] a testimony and there's going to be
[7:24] special events in your life and you're
[7:25] going to be known for being that kind of
[7:27] a person praise god
[7:29] but you want to be faithful and you want
[7:31] to be mighty in god's power every day so
[7:33] that when those great moments come then
[7:36] you'll be ready for that and that will
[7:37] seal your testimony praise god amen amen
[7:40] hallelujah amen so may god increase our
[7:43] faith so he can work mightily in our
[7:44] lives now i want to look at a few more
[7:46] of david's uh mighty men
[7:49] actually let me just review i don't know
[7:50] if everybody heard the wednesday night
[7:52] but let me just review those uh three
[7:54] that we looked at i'll just just hit a
[7:55] few of those slides okay not not all of
[7:58] them
[7:59] i'll just hit the one here
[8:02] they were mighty here yes yeah here we
[8:05] go they were mighty because god wrought
[8:07] the victory
[8:09] so the only way god would call someone
[8:11] mighty is if they let god move in their
[8:13] life
[8:14] because we have no power of our own
[8:16] what makes us mighty is when we say god
[8:18] i don't want my thoughts i want your
[8:20] thoughts
[8:22] i'm gonna obey the word of god i'm gonna
[8:24] choose to crucify my desires and cast
[8:27] out my my personal lusts or desires and
[8:30] i'm going to obey the word of god and
[8:32] when you do that god can do something
[8:33] mighty in your life amen amen see it's
[8:36] god whenever god does something great in
[8:38] your life it's god doing the work
[8:40] it's not you doing it praise god
[8:42] and so uh
[8:45] the three mightiest men were a dino the
[8:47] azite or as knight rather eliezer and
[8:50] shama
[8:51] and a dino was the greatest of all the
[8:54] mighty men because he killed 800 men all
[8:57] by himself at one time 800 men that's a
[9:00] lot to kill
[9:02] but he was anointed of the holy spirit
[9:04] to do so
[9:05] with one spear one spear he killed 800
[9:08] men and he was the mightiest of all so
[9:10] we see the we see the lesson that uh
[9:14] the greater number of battles or enemies
[9:17] you defeat that makes you greater
[9:19] right in god's kingdom praise god
[9:22] uh the more you overcome the more
[9:24] enemies you defeat the more trials you
[9:27] overcome the greater you are in god's
[9:30] sight now we don't ever pop pump
[9:31] ourselves up or brag on ourselves we
[9:34] only brag on jesus but we still have
[9:36] battles that we must face personally and
[9:38] god is the one keeping track amen amen
[9:41] and god is the one who will determine
[9:43] who are those that serve god the most
[9:46] faithful praise god
[9:48] and then you had uh you know joshua had
[9:50] prophesied this samson experience one
[9:53] thousand that's probably what is that a
[9:55] dino spear looked like this long spirit
[9:58] with with this one spear 800 men he
[10:01] defeated praise god slew 800 men
[10:04] so be like this longer one this little
[10:06] cartoon picture there but
[10:08] so the lesson is a believer can defeat
[10:10] any size army amen
[10:13] and so today a believer can overcome any
[10:16] odds
[10:17] no matter the odds that are like george
[10:19] washington he was going out to battle
[10:21] and the odds were he was going to lose
[10:22] his life they shot at him he just kept
[10:25] fighting right he just kept being in
[10:26] general he got home after the battle
[10:28] took off his jacket there's holes all
[10:30] over the jacket but there's no bullets
[10:32] in his body amen amen any obstacle
[10:35] praise god a believer can overcome any
[10:37] obstacle as long as god is with them
[10:39] praise god amen amen they called him
[10:41] bulletproof washington
[10:44] a new testament believer praise god
[10:46] amen
[10:48] so it doesn't really matter uh it
[10:50] doesn't matter how big the obstacle or
[10:52] how how uh how strong the enemy is as
[10:55] long as god is with you as long as
[10:57] you're walking in god's plan you can be
[10:59] a mighty man or woman praise god amen
[11:01] and then eliezer
[11:04] he was the second greatest or we'd say
[11:06] because
[11:07] he smote
[11:08] the philistines until they could not
[11:11] remove his hand from the sword he must
[11:13] have a muscle spasm right
[11:15] some type of cramp or something where
[11:17] he had such power in his hand they could
[11:19] not remove the spear or the sword from
[11:21] his hand
[11:23] and this made him one of the greatest of
[11:25] all the mighty men he became one with
[11:28] the word of god and that's what we are
[11:30] becoming we're becoming one with the
[11:31] word hallelujah where we think the word
[11:34] we meditate on the word we speak the
[11:35] word we obey the word praise god our
[11:38] whole lives are centered around one
[11:39] thing the word of god glory
[11:43] so the lesson is we can be victorious by
[11:46] constantly clinging to the word of god
[11:49] so see we're taking these old testament
[11:50] warriors and we're learning new
[11:52] testament values amen new testament
[11:54] lessons by the grace of god how many
[11:56] will cling to god's word today
[11:58] you'll be you'll be you'll be mighty
[12:00] you'll be victorious if you cling to
[12:01] god's word amen
[12:02] and then shama all he did was stand all
[12:06] alone all the all the workers in the
[12:08] lentil field left him he was just
[12:10] standing in a field of beings
[12:12] and he said i'm not going to forfeit
[12:14] this field of beings i'm not going to
[12:16] give over my possession that god has
[12:19] given to me i'm not giving up what god
[12:21] has blessed me with
[12:22] amen hallelujah and because he stood
[12:25] alone he won
[12:27] and that made because he didn't run from
[12:29] the enemy because he didn't complain
[12:31] praise god because he was able to stand
[12:34] when other people would run away from
[12:35] the enemy god made him one of the
[12:37] greatest in the army praise god amen so
[12:39] we see these great lessons church
[12:42] you're victorious when you defend what
[12:44] god has given you praise god
[12:47] that's why we must defend and fight for
[12:50] everything god has given us right how
[12:52] many know that the peace of god in your
[12:54] heart is a very wonderful possession
[12:57] how many believe it's worth fighting for
[12:59] how about your good health you believe
[13:01] that's worth fighting for
[13:03] hallelujah amen
[13:04] every good thing you know the
[13:07] a humble spirit is that worth fighting
[13:09] for
[13:10] sincerity when you come to god's house
[13:12] and you you want to get your sincerity
[13:14] back is that worth fighting for yeah
[13:17] absolutely because those are those are
[13:18] attributes you don't find in other
[13:20] churches
[13:21] those are attributes centers know
[13:23] nothing about but it's god's possession
[13:26] it's god's inheritance for you and i and
[13:28] we must fight for it hallelujah hey
[13:31] that's just a quick review there so let
[13:33] me go back up here now now let's look at
[13:35] some of these mighty men by god's grace
[13:38] we see some more of these mighty men so
[13:40] we uh see a dino
[13:43] uh we see shama and eliezer
[13:45] now here's abba shah he's the brother of
[13:48] joab joe was a good man uh for the most
[13:50] part
[13:52] you know they all they all had the old
[13:53] testament just lays it out you know good
[13:55] and bad you know
[13:57] uh but he was chief among three more so
[13:59] there was three higher ones that are
[14:01] above all then there was three more
[14:02] higher ones
[14:04] so avishai was the leader of the second
[14:07] the second group of three not the top
[14:09] group
[14:10] right that was uh a dino
[14:13] so abishai was
[14:15] the highest of the second level
[14:17] so it's kind of like the
[14:19] maokai isn't it then they have like the
[14:20] they got the navy they got the navy then
[14:22] they got the navy seals right
[14:24] and something like that in other words
[14:26] they have special forces
[14:27] they have the best of the best i need to
[14:29] study my military for those things
[14:32] that's what i need to do praise god
[14:33] but you have elite forces praise god
[14:36] you have just regular soldiers but then
[14:38] you have elite soldiers amen
[14:41] i said this you got christians and then
[14:43] you've got wise virgins amen
[14:45] hallelujah
[14:47] you got foolish virgins praise god but
[14:49] then you got wise virgins and then in
[14:51] that then you've got peter james and
[14:52] john praise god right
[14:54] with brother man said they weren't any
[14:56] better they just had special gifts
[14:59] amen
[15:00] then we just have special gifts in the
[15:02] body of christ hallelujah amen
[15:04] where god can only use certain people
[15:06] that have certain gifts and church it's
[15:08] for every generation that's right
[15:10] the bible said david served the will of
[15:12] god for his generation we're gonna get
[15:14] that in a little bit of praise god think
[15:16] about it every generation on mighty men
[15:19] joshua and caleb were the mighty men of
[15:21] their generation amen
[15:23] david and his mighty men were the mighty
[15:25] men of their generation praise god
[15:27] jerubal haggai and zechariah were mighty
[15:30] men of their generation you and i can be
[15:33] mighty men for jesus christ today
[15:35] amen amen
[15:37] whatever should i do he took that
[15:39] another same weapon the spear and he
[15:42] killed 300
[15:45] and so the top guy you know a dino at
[15:48] 800 this guy had 300
[15:50] still tremendous victory
[15:52] amazing victory
[15:54] this separated him from many of the
[15:56] others praise god
[15:59] did the bible say wasn't he most
[16:02] honorable of the three he was their
[16:04] captain
[16:05] but he didn't attain to the top three
[16:08] there was just certain and we can see it
[16:10] today in the church like brother brandon
[16:12] we can see his gift of divine healing
[16:13] was far above everybody else right
[16:15] discernment nobody can discern like that
[16:18] it's just a gift that's high and above
[16:20] so and that makes sense he's one of the
[16:22] seven stars in the hand of jesus jesus
[16:24] has seven stars in his hand
[16:26] so we can see they're gonna you know
[16:27] martin luther had this all nine gifts of
[16:29] the holy spirit plus preaching and
[16:31] pastoring gift and all these gifts they
[16:33] were just very gifted people praise god
[16:36] so you have some that are just
[16:38] higher but then others can attain high
[16:41] as well
[16:42] not as high but they still have weapons
[16:45] amen they still can have a testimony
[16:47] church let me say this you can still do
[16:49] something for the kingdom of god amen
[16:52] you might not be able to read hearts and
[16:54] minds right you might not be able to
[16:55] discern the thoughts and intents of
[16:57] people's heart but there's something you
[16:59] can do that's why i get a song i can
[17:01] pray praise god
[17:02] i can pray until the laws fall down all
[17:04] of us can do that amen that's where
[17:06] you'll find your gift in your prayer
[17:08] life
[17:09] amen
[17:11] that's where you find it praise god
[17:15] so
[17:17] he defeats 300 abashad he is the second
[17:20] highest he's the second highest captain
[17:22] after adina
[17:24] and they they don't name too many so
[17:26] this here now we get to benign that's
[17:27] cam's son's name cam told me kept that
[17:30] name a secret because cam has been
[17:31] reading the book of us
[17:33] and he
[17:34] he knew he was going to have a son but
[17:35] he didn't tell anybody the name because
[17:36] he thought somebody would take the name
[17:38] it's a powerful name banaya right
[17:40] he was the son of a valiant man
[17:46] so i like that that's what i want to be
[17:48] a male a valiant man for christ i want
[17:50] to pass it down to my sons and daughters
[17:51] don't you
[17:53] in other words you want to see your
[17:55] testimony you live you want to see a
[17:56] pass to the next generation
[17:58] lord amen
[18:01] now banaya did many acts
[18:04] he's through two lion-like men of mohab
[18:07] now we can only uh imagine but remember
[18:10] when nebuchadnezzar was given that
[18:12] spirit of the beast
[18:14] and he grew claws like a bear you know
[18:17] and he grew feathers like an eagle
[18:20] and
[18:21] he literally grew those things and
[18:23] scales and and he was out for seven
[18:25] years eating with the animals right
[18:29] so he had been transformed the bible
[18:31] said his natural mind left him and the
[18:33] spirit of a beast came upon him
[18:36] right to humble him
[18:38] to show that
[18:40] the blessings in his life wasn't because
[18:42] of him it was because god sent him there
[18:44] praise god
[18:47] now we see something similar here i
[18:48] don't know exactly how to explain this
[18:50] but we have two men maybe they were into
[18:52] uh
[18:54] some type of martial art where it taught
[18:55] them to fight like animals so uh
[18:58] kung fu
[18:59] maybe this is like kung fu two lion like
[19:02] men now can you imagine their hair
[19:04] church i couldn't i can imagine their
[19:05] hair we've seen some pretty big beards
[19:07] here in the last few years haven't we
[19:09] you get your beard growing bless your
[19:10] top gone you can look a lot like a lion
[19:13] but two line-like men no doubt they had
[19:15] a beastly spirit you know they probably
[19:18] look like a lion with the lion's mane
[19:20] all kinds of hair on their faces
[19:22] but banaya took on two of them amen not
[19:25] one but two
[19:28] hallelujah
[19:30] and he defeated both of them
[19:32] and this made him mighty
[19:35] he wasn't afraid of the obstacle he
[19:38] wasn't afraid of
[19:41] of these line-like men
[19:43] he wasn't afraid of the enemy because he
[19:45] knew although they're lying i serve the
[19:48] line of the tribe of judah praise god
[19:50] hallelujah is that right
[19:53] and this reminds us of satan's like a
[19:55] roaring lion
[19:57] seeking whom he may devour then for some
[20:00] some strange reason he gets inside of a
[20:03] pit
[20:05] in the in the snow time in the winter
[20:08] no doubt they needed meat you know they
[20:09] had to go out hunting
[20:11] in the winter as well
[20:13] he finds himself he goes down into a pit
[20:18] so he just says i know i'm the anointing
[20:20] of god on me it's winter time i'm going
[20:22] to go down the pit and i'm going to
[20:24] defeat this lion
[20:26] because my mighty man ruler david david
[20:29] already did it amen and if david did it
[20:31] i can do it praise god if jesus said lay
[20:34] hands on the sick and they shall recover
[20:35] so can you praise god amen if he said
[20:38] that if he did that we can do those
[20:40] things as well
[20:42] praise god and notice i love that church
[20:44] see when i taught us you must be in
[20:46] season and out of season
[20:50] right
[20:52] the time to fight was actually spring
[20:54] time was the time to fight
[20:56] that's when
[20:57] the warriors would go out for battle in
[20:59] the spring that's when david uh
[21:02] failed to go out that's when he fell
[21:04] with bathsheba it was springtime that's
[21:06] the time the warriors went out to fight
[21:08] but here banaya teaches us whether you
[21:10] send two line-like men at me or whether
[21:13] it's winter time out of season you know
[21:16] i haven't fought for a few months and
[21:18] maybe my skills aren't sharp as they
[21:19] should be maybe my accuracy is off a
[21:21] little bit right maybe my fundamentals
[21:23] are off a little bit
[21:25] no matter where you place me god is
[21:27] still with me no matter the season god
[21:30] is for me no matter where i'm at my life
[21:32] god is with me and god will fight for me
[21:34] amen
[21:36] hallelujah
[21:38] i love this one dude
[21:40] he's through an egyptian god goodly man
[21:44] and the egyptian had a spear
[21:46] and all he had was a staff
[21:50] so he just had a wooden staff and i just
[21:52] had a wooden staff and this egyptian man
[21:54] has a spear so it's got a metal a metal
[21:57] point on it right
[21:59] and he's able with the uh
[22:01] with the staff to pluck out
[22:04] his uh the enemy spear and then he kills
[22:07] the enemy with his own weapon
[22:10] that's exactly what david did
[22:12] david used to sling kill goliath and
[22:15] then he cuts off goliath's head with his
[22:17] own sword amen
[22:20] that's the same thing jesus did
[22:22] jesus defeated death by dying amen
[22:27] he defeated death by taking his own
[22:30] weapon and defeating him praise god
[22:34] praise god
[22:36] let me get these lessons church
[22:39] these lessons
[22:41] that there's no weapon glory formed
[22:44] against you that shall prosper again
[22:47] and what am i doing i'm trying to raise
[22:48] your faith church
[22:50] hallelujah that god will do something
[22:51] mighty
[22:52] in your life praise god just believe the
[22:54] word of god just be mighty in the word
[22:56] of god yourself amen
[22:59] and no matter the enemy look it can be
[23:00] two it can you can be outnumbered two to
[23:02] one or it can be a wild animal
[23:05] or it can be a
[23:06] a goodly warrior
[23:09] and you're able by the grace of god to
[23:11] get the victory in every situation
[23:13] praise god and we don't wrestle against
[23:16] uh natural things we rest against
[23:18] spiritual principalities and powers in
[23:21] high places we found out this week
[23:23] didn't we haven't cares we found out
[23:25] this week that we wrestle against
[23:26] spiritual spiritual principalities in
[23:29] high places
[23:30] is that right
[23:31] amen
[23:32] and god is here to give us the victory
[23:34] of it and i love that you know haven was
[23:37] uh
[23:38] he had a good testimony coming out of
[23:39] that
[23:40] uh in that moment when the the little
[23:42] girl was you know talking about all this
[23:44] horror stuff haven just said well i'm a
[23:46] holy ghost christian and the devil can't
[23:48] touch me is that is that kind of what
[23:50] you said
[23:51] amen i thought that was beautiful praise
[23:53] god amen
[23:54] see she's learning how to fight amen
[23:58] she's learning how to be how to battle
[24:00] how to overcome and let the lord be
[24:02] mighty hallelujah mighty in word indeed
[24:05] praise god
[24:06] and the beautiful part was then we got
[24:08] to see the person again last night
[24:10] and they just stayed for a short time
[24:12] and haven got to play
[24:14] uh her song that she she sang for us and
[24:17] i just thought oh it's so perfect
[24:19] so perfect
[24:20] uh this this young person comes to
[24:22] spread all this fear but then before she
[24:25] leaves she's got to hear jesus a song
[24:27] about jesus a song about the rapture
[24:30] i like that amen i like that praise god
[24:33] amen
[24:34] because we have a choice be either given
[24:36] to the devil and take a loss take a
[24:38] defeat or we can choose to fight and
[24:40] stand up against the enemy and get the
[24:42] victory and overcome hallelujah
[24:46] glory
[24:48] a lot of great lessons there praise god
[24:50] satan's like a roaring lion
[24:52] but just be ready to fight how many be
[24:53] ready to fight by god's grace
[24:55] just be ready to fight
[24:57] god will deliver you
[24:59] a little more on banaya he was more
[25:01] honorable than the 30 but he attained
[25:03] not to the first three
[25:05] and david set him over his guard
[25:08] okay so banaya was like uh
[25:10] the lead guard of david's guards praise
[25:14] god
[25:15] and now from from verse 24 down to 39 it
[25:18] only lists names it does it gives no
[25:21] more specific acts but how many of these
[25:23] were some mighty acts
[25:25] by some mighty men
[25:26] and of course you see there's uriah uh a
[25:29] mighty man and then 30 and seven and all
[25:31] so there was
[25:32] the bible called in the 30 but then
[25:34] there were some that of course you had
[25:35] some that were well
[25:37] huh
[25:37] well i just thought of this maybe there
[25:39] was 30 and then there was the three
[25:41] three that's 36 plus david 37
[25:44] might be i just thought of that i could
[25:45] be wrong the strange thought there
[25:48] okay so just some more thoughts there
[25:50] now if you look at the parallel passage
[25:52] in first chronicles 11 the bible says
[25:55] david waxed greater and greater for the
[25:57] lord of hosts was with him amen
[26:01] now and then he lists the chief of the
[26:03] mighty men
[26:04] now notice they strengthen themselves
[26:06] with him in his kingdom glory i like
[26:10] that so as they as they saw david get
[26:12] stronger they got stronger
[26:15] that's what i want to see as amen get
[26:16] stronger i want to get stronger amen as
[26:19] jose gets stronger i want to get
[26:21] stronger amen
[26:23] we should look at each other and say my
[26:24] i see the faith of the young people i
[26:26] see the faith of the brothers and the
[26:27] sisters i see them getting stronger
[26:29] let's all get strong together praise god
[26:32] amen why would i be weak why should i
[26:34] why should i get weaker why should i
[26:35] decrease when god wants me to increase
[26:39] oh my hallelujah
[26:42] and really jesus is the only real david
[26:43] here praise god
[26:45] hallelujah because as jesus as his word
[26:48] gets more and more declared and more and
[26:50] more preach we get stronger because we
[26:52] believe his word
[26:55] amen
[26:58] now see they were going to make him king
[26:59] so they got they noticed they was
[27:01] getting stronger and stronger and
[27:03] stronger and then these mighty men got
[27:05] stronger and stronger and stronger
[27:08] see because david was serving his own
[27:11] generation
[27:13] by the will of god
[27:15] so church if we just do the will of god
[27:17] we will be mighty men and women and
[27:20] children for god's glory
[27:22] amen
[27:23] we just have to do god's will
[27:27] like just a simple example with the
[27:29] riots we're talking about and then the
[27:30] protest right we drove by the middle of
[27:32] wadsworth yesterday wadsworth ohio
[27:34] and they had like five people out there
[27:36] protesting roe v wade being overturned
[27:39] now like you know this is
[27:41] and they they they were pro-abortion
[27:43] right
[27:44] and so you know we have people that are
[27:46] just it's so sad you know that's half
[27:48] the country's that way you know we're
[27:50] actually in the root it's like a 50 50
[27:51] split in the country right now
[27:54] but that's you know that's what they're
[27:55] fighting for you know what what would be
[27:57] a better use of time out there on the
[27:59] street or how about on your knees in
[28:01] prayer praise god
[28:03] which one would have more impact on the
[28:05] community amen
[28:07] which one would really make you how
[28:09] which one would you wax greater and
[28:11] greater what is the will of god
[28:14] now there's a time and season you know
[28:15] our founding fathers had to protest and
[28:17] fight uh the revolutionary war there's a
[28:19] time and season for those things but
[28:21] that's not the time of season we're
[28:23] right now we're not in that type of a
[28:25] violent kind of thing we're in a type
[28:27] where it's we need spiritual powers we
[28:30] need to do the will of god we need the
[28:31] wisdom to know what does god want me to
[28:33] do now do that and god will make you
[28:35] mightier praise god
[28:38] glory
[28:40] now remember these mighty men so mania
[28:44] right shama
[28:46] a dino i always forget that second one
[28:48] eliezer
[28:50] they they were natural men living in the
[28:53] promised land but they're a type of us
[28:57] because our promised land is the baptism
[28:59] of the holy ghost
[29:00] amen yes
[29:02] now church i just want to read this this
[29:04] thought came to me
[29:05] they were mighty because they rarely
[29:07] lost
[29:10] right that's what made them mighty
[29:12] they kept winning glory
[29:14] how did they
[29:16] they didn't lose all the time they won
[29:18] all the time
[29:20] now think about your life church
[29:22] think about my life are we constantly
[29:25] losing are we constantly winning
[29:28] i believe we can say we're constantly
[29:31] waiting hallelujah
[29:34] if not church we would be losing to
[29:36] pride which would bring contentions and
[29:39] strife in the church right
[29:41] or wrath which would bring arguments and
[29:45] anger towards one another
[29:48] gossip
[29:50] people would be sleeping around
[29:52] lying stealing if we were losing these
[29:55] battles you would see all these negative
[29:57] effects praise god
[29:59] that's right but let's let's just kind
[30:01] of
[30:02] shake ourselves a little bit and
[30:03] understand we're not losing these
[30:05] battles we're winning these battles amen
[30:08] amen
[30:09] that's so that's what makes you mighty
[30:11] what makes you mighty is that you
[30:13] faithfully overcome these little battles
[30:16] and then someday god's gonna have one
[30:17] great battle where god is gonna empower
[30:20] you and you are gonna overcome in that
[30:22] battle and you'll be known for that
[30:24] praise god
[30:25] that's what god called you to do that
[30:27] was your purpose on earth amen
[30:30] like samson his purpose was to defeat
[30:32] the philistines amen
[30:35] davis was to defeat the giants become
[30:37] king establish israel praise god as a
[30:41] king after god's own heart amen yeah
[30:43] that's right amen
[30:45] so so do you you have a purpose you have
[30:48] a testimony god is trying to establish
[30:51] in your life
[30:52] paul was a prophet
[30:54] missionary church age messenger that was
[30:57] his calling in life
[30:59] if my calling is just simply a pastor
[31:02] teacher
[31:03] you know whatever whatever you do
[31:05] whatever it is then i want to do the
[31:06] very best i can i want to please god i
[31:10] want to be a mighty man amen amen
[31:15] and so how do i know that i'll be a
[31:16] mighty man as i daily get victories
[31:19] overcoming all of my battles
[31:22] hallelujah
[31:24] it's a type
[31:26] so we're to possess all the promises of
[31:28] god
[31:30] we're to see ourselves oh i'm getting
[31:32] more momentum i like that barley like
[31:34] that barley bread
[31:38] that's what they were getting they're
[31:39] getting more momentum all the time more
[31:42] victories stronger in the faith glory
[31:44] that's when i see church i'm more
[31:45] convinced that the bible is right that
[31:47] we have thus saith the lord that nothing
[31:49] can stop us we're god's people we're
[31:52] standing on the truth god is for us not
[31:54] against us amen amen
[31:56] hallelujah never look at the numbers
[31:58] praise god look at the quality of god's
[32:00] word
[32:01] that's what we look at praise god that's
[32:03] what makes a people mighty hallelujah
[32:06] is their quality
[32:08] of their love for jesus christ their
[32:10] obedience to the word of god
[32:13] hallelujah
[32:14] now that's just a infographic
[32:16] i'm not going to spend any time with
[32:18] that it's just too small
[32:20] some of that i've already preached
[32:22] now i want to show this again more on
[32:23] how david became a mighty man
[32:29] and this is part of that song never back
[32:31] okay so that song really inspired me
[32:35] david was making this song and he said
[32:37] blessed be the lord my strength
[32:41] which teaches my hands to war
[32:45] and my fingers to fight
[32:48] my goodness and my fortress my high
[32:51] tower my deliverer my shield in him
[32:54] i'm sorry and he in whom i trust who
[32:57] subdueth my people under me
[33:02] so think about banaya how did he take
[33:04] that bow
[33:06] and knock that egyptians guys spear out
[33:09] how did he do it he had to use his hands
[33:12] so in his training david had taught
[33:14] banaya how to use the bow
[33:18] was it or was it abhishek
[33:21] oh staff there you go yeah staff yeah
[33:24] yeah
[33:26] but his hands had to be taught praise
[33:28] god
[33:30] in other words he knew god you know
[33:32] david had shown me this so god showed
[33:34] david now david showed me i know the
[33:37] right uh strategy right i know the right
[33:39] move i know the fundamentals with the
[33:41] staff
[33:43] and i can use this in other words when i
[33:46] use this as it's as if god is using this
[33:48] amen
[33:49] god taught me how to use this step
[33:52] god taught me how to war god taught me
[33:55] how to be a warrior
[33:56] god taught me how to pray god taught me
[33:59] how to be a real man of god god told me
[34:01] to speak the word god taught me to fight
[34:04] god taught me to be positive amen god
[34:06] told me to be faithful praise god god
[34:08] told me to be diligent god has taught me
[34:10] how to war
[34:12] amen
[34:13] amen
[34:14] i can try my best
[34:16] right i can try my best to help
[34:18] everybody but you've got to let god
[34:19] teach you how to war
[34:22] i do that you got to spend time with god
[34:25] hallelujah
[34:28] and then even his fingers right with the
[34:30] bow and arrow even his fingers
[34:32] the right way to hold an arrow
[34:34] god was so interested lord god was so
[34:37] interested in the details
[34:39] every detail of his life whether he's
[34:40] got a whether he's got a staff whether
[34:42] he's got a sword whether he's got a bow
[34:44] and arrow god had trained him in every
[34:47] part of this physical body to be a
[34:50] mighty warrior in other words god had
[34:52] taken control over his full body praise
[34:54] god amen that's why i say jesus take
[34:57] control over my entire body amen amen
[35:00] my mind my words my thoughts praise god
[35:03] my actions let the power of god flow
[35:05] through my entire being
[35:08] oh god
[35:10] this is good amen i love this amen
[35:12] beautiful
[35:14] trying to raise your faith church amen
[35:16] amen hallelujah
[35:18] so god may god teach our hands to give
[35:20] to the poor
[35:23] to give when someone asks you you might
[35:25] not be able to give everything but give
[35:26] something
[35:28] how about teach our hands how to pray
[35:30] how about teach our hands how to open
[35:32] the bible more and flip through the
[35:34] pages of the bible
[35:36] teach our hands how to serve at church
[35:38] and clean up after each other
[35:40] right
[35:42] help each other right minister each
[35:44] other teach us how teach our hands to be
[35:46] servants praise god
[35:50] some of us were pretty good i'm getting
[35:51] good at this one teaching our hands how
[35:53] to reply on the keyboard
[35:56] to show grace i'm a man from canada text
[35:58] me this weekend said brother i've
[35:59] watched you for years

[36:03] what he said
[36:04] he said i don't know how you do all this
[36:07] he said you can respond with such grace
[36:08] even though people are so petty and they
[36:10] criticize you i got them i can show you
[36:12] the message if you want to see it
[36:14] so even in that like as david's fingers
[36:17] were taught by god church our fingers
[36:19] can be taught by god
[36:21] to text the right things praise god
[36:23] right you know just
[36:25] every part of our being
[36:27] fingers and toes and and eyes and lips
[36:30] and ears and everything our whole bodies
[36:32] can be trained to obey the word of god
[36:34] amen amen
[36:37] god has taught me out of war all right
[36:40] god has taught me how to be a christian
[36:42] amen amen
[36:43] god has taught me how to overcome the
[36:46] power of darkness
[36:47] and god has made me a soldier in the
[36:49] power of god the kingdom of light amen
[36:53] glory i love this one too
[36:56] god has enlarged my steps
[36:58] under me
[37:01] that my feet did not slip

[37:06] fall you know in a rock or something
[37:08] like that
[37:10] you know god god was oh glory god was
[37:13] ordaining every one of the steps brother

[39:54] life to my hair gets gray

[40:05] of god for your life
[40:08] praise god
[40:13] i think of that you know one example i
[40:15] just think i'll just share this one here
[40:16] real quick
[40:21] uh you probably i told this story before
[40:23] but i'm sure again up in sheffield there
[40:24] was a brother named brother herb
[40:26] old man old man he was just a backwoods
[40:29] kentucky country boy that's all he was
[40:32] he had a little accent like kentucky and
[40:34] he heard the message
[40:37] and he was married to a woman they both
[40:38] received the message and god delivered
[40:40] her from smoking i mean they were
[40:42] totally in the world right so they would
[40:44] party they were married but party all
[40:45] the time god brought them out of
[40:47] uh sin into the message
[40:50] sister josephine was her name i could
[40:52] still see her today she had those girls
[40:54] those great girls in mary you're a baby
[41:00] but they served god for all those years
[41:02] in the message
[41:03] a year before herb died
[41:06] his daughter who wasn't a believer she
[41:08] was in her 50s she come down with cancer
[41:12] and at that moment she was a sinner she
[41:14] repented of her sins she came in the
[41:16] message she started growing her hair out
[41:17] long like the bible says she started
[41:19] wearing modest clothes and dresses like
[41:22] the bible says
[41:23] and god healed her of that cancer
[41:27] and then her dad died the next year
[41:30] think about that for all those years
[41:32] her mom and dad didn't slip
[41:35] their daughter had spoke against them
[41:37] all the message isn't right you guys are
[41:39] fanatics you guys are holy rollers they
[41:41] just said we love you we're going to
[41:43] church
[41:45] for all those years
[41:47] they didn't slip they just stayed
[41:49] faithful they just kept walking amen
[41:51] and then the year before he dies he sees
[41:53] the mighty miracle not just healing of
[41:55] cancer that's mighty but a mighty
[41:57] miracle is a soul that's passed from
[41:59] death unto life amen
[42:03] that's the power of not letting our feet
[42:05] slip
[42:07] and walking in god's will for our lives
[42:11] praise god
[42:13] hallelujah
[42:16] thank you lord amen
[42:18] glory i love this amen i love this
[42:24] oh glory now church in the natural david
[42:27] eventually got over he wasn't mighty
[42:29] anymore
[42:30] but that doesn't have to be us
[42:33] here he goes out for his last battle he
[42:34] didn't know it was his last battle he
[42:36] goes out for his last battle against the
[42:38] philistines and he comes up against one
[42:40] of goliath's sons
[42:43] do you know this
[42:44] he was fighting one of the goliath sons
[42:47] i imagine that guy was pretty upset you
[42:48] killed my dad you cut my dad's head off
[42:52] now i'm going to kill you
[42:54] now david had fallen before but he's
[42:55] getting kind of weaker the bible said he
[42:57] got faint he got tired of the battle can
[43:00] you imagine he's like
[43:03] he just gets tired
[43:05] and the bible said he would have died
[43:08] ish
[43:09] by
[43:11] me being
[43:11] goliath's son
[43:14] he would have died but abhishek he was
[43:16] remembered he was the leader of that
[43:17] second group of three
[43:19] he sees his king he sees the original
[43:21] mighty man getting weaker so he comes
[43:23] along and he joins the fight and he
[43:25] slays goliath's son
[43:28] and they they say glory to god but he
[43:30] said now david you're getting too old
[43:31] now you're not going out to battle
[43:32] anymore
[43:34] you've lost your might
[43:36] right
[43:37] yeah there's a couple lessons we can get
[43:39] in your church right as we get older we
[43:41] might not have the natural strength but
[43:43] we can still have the spiritual strength
[43:47] and we get another good lesson brother
[43:48] amen right when brother jessie gets weak
[43:50] and tired and sick
[43:51] another mighty man can come along and
[43:53] pray for the weak ones amen
[43:56] lord
[43:58] if you see your mighty brother and
[43:59] sister discouraged or down or faint or
[44:02] tired or sick it's your job to come over
[44:05] and defeat the son of the giant
[44:07] hallelujah
[44:09] georgia
[44:11] then the bible say
[44:13] bear one another burdens and so fulfill
[44:15] the law of jesus christ oh my amen
[44:20] obeying the law of jesus christ
[44:23] when you see someone who's weak and they
[44:25] used to be strong in the faith but
[44:26] they're weak you've got to come
[44:28] alongside and help them win the battle
[44:30] pray with them encourage them
[44:33] lift them up out of their
[44:34] discouragement hallelujah lay hands on
[44:37] the sick they shall recover
[44:41] oh thank you jesus
[44:44] avishai secured david
[44:48] and they said no more battles for you
[44:49] mighty guy
[44:51] you re you passed your you you passed
[44:53] your generation of being mighty right
[44:55] you your days passed
[44:57] we can all see it now
[45:00] you pass
[45:02] but we don't have to
[45:04] brother random said numerous times he
[45:06] said if i had a choice of living 25
[45:08] years whether 0 to 25 25 to 50 25 to 75
[45:12] 75 to 100 he said i'd rather live this
[45:14] 75 to 100 because i'd be more wise about
[45:17] it
[45:18] see in other words he'd be more he'd
[45:20] understand the fight better he said i
[45:22] wouldn't go into a meeting like i'm just
[45:24] killing a bunch of snakes
[45:26] that's what he said
[45:28] he would have wisdom to wait on the lord
[45:30] amen
[45:32] you have wisdom to trust god amen
[45:36] instead of zeal that's not like exactly
[45:38] lined up to god's will just human zeal
[45:41] instead of having that
[45:42] he would have wisdom to wait for the
[45:44] word of god and then know what to do
[45:47] praise god
[45:50] thank you jesus
[45:52] how many grateful for abhishet
[45:54] you can be an avid shy yeah
[45:56] you can be an avid shy
[45:59] come along when someone's discouraged
[46:00] come along and strengthen them
[46:02] come along and help them out
[46:04] you become an avid shy
[46:06] you help them defeat the giants of their
[46:08] lives
[46:10] praise god
[46:12] anybody feel mighty yet amen
[46:15] 30 minutes in anybody feel mighty
[46:18] hallelujah
[46:19] dave was constantly teaching these men
[46:22] to be mighty
[46:24] and there's two simple examples
[46:27] of how he taught them
[46:29] he didn't say oh you need to be more
[46:30] mighty he actually modeled it before
[46:32] them right
[46:34] right
[46:36] the the first one is such a beautiful
[46:38] example
[46:39] in first samuel 24 you know the story
[46:43] david and his mighty men are in a cave
[46:45] and saul was chasing them he didn't know
[46:47] they were in the cave he goes in there
[46:49] and lays down
[46:51] to take a nap
[46:53] and the mighty men are like david
[46:55] god has delivered them in your hand go
[46:58] kill him
[47:00] what david said
[47:02] he said god forbid i do such a thing
[47:04] how could i
[47:06] put my hand on the lord's anointed so he
[47:09] just cut off the skirt of saul's
[47:11] garment
[47:12] then when they woke up you know the
[47:13] story he said i could have killed you
[47:15] and saul said i know now for sure you're
[47:17] going to be the king of israel
[47:19] because you could have taken my life but
[47:20] you didn't take my life
[47:23] but all the mighty members amen were
[47:24] saying come on
[47:26] kill him kill him
[47:27] you can do it take this guy out
[47:31] kill this guy
[47:33] don't show mercy show justice show the
[47:35] wrath of god
[47:38] but the bible says avenge his mind say
[47:40] the lord
[47:43] see how the mighty men would learn oh
[47:45] he was kind to his enemies
[47:48] i need to be kind
[47:50] yeah
[47:54] in other words we kill a lot of people
[47:55] but there's times where you show mercy
[47:57] right they defeat a lot of enemies but
[47:59] this is your own people this is this is
[48:00] your own christians these are your own
[48:02] message believers right
[48:07] so he was teaching them not just with
[48:09] words and with weapons well here's how
[48:10] you use the spiritual selena you take it
[48:12] like this and you pull it back and then
[48:14] you bring it down that's hot
[48:16] it was more than that
[48:18] it was in his daily life watch how i
[48:20] forgive
[48:21] watch how i understand does god want me
[48:23] to kill this man does god want me to do
[48:25] this does god want me to do that i must
[48:27] see god's will for each situation
[48:29] in church he didn't do it just one time
[48:33] he could have took in the king
[48:36] he could have took in the crown that he
[48:38] knew was his
[48:39] but he was patient to wait on the crowd
[48:42] how many will be patient on the crowd
[48:44] how many will we patient until god
[48:46] crowns your life with that certain
[48:47] testimony yes
[48:51] glory amen
[48:53] god is going to crown your life with
[48:54] some testimony feed the philistines
[48:57] you know win this many souls to jesus
[49:00] operate this gift mightily this miracle
[49:02] this deliverance god's going to crown
[49:04] your life with something but you've got
[49:06] to wait on god to do it
[49:09] hallelujah
[49:10] think about that there's millions
[49:12] billions of christians down though
[49:13] through the last 2000 years billions and
[49:16] each one we're going to stand side by
[49:17] side
[49:18] and we're the bible that we're going to
[49:19] talk about through the ages how did you
[49:21] overcome how is the kindness of jesus
[49:24] expressed to you in your life
[49:26] and church think about it when it comes
[49:28] to your opportunity you're gonna have
[49:29] something to say praise god
[49:31] you're gonna be able to testify jesus
[49:33] was mighty in me praise god amen amen
[49:37] jesus taught my hands to war
[49:39] jesus kept my feet from slipping amen i
[49:42] was able to overcome i became a mighty
[49:44] believer because the mighty one never
[49:46] forsook me amen oh
[49:49] hallelujah
[49:51] the mighty one taught me to forgive amen
[49:54] hallelujah
[49:57] and i like this one
[49:58] the my the mighty one taught me to pour
[50:01] out my life as a drink offering you
[50:03] might not know the quotes on this but
[50:04] brother ryan made it so beautiful
[50:06] he typed david and the three mighty men
[50:08] to jesus and us
[50:11] and he said oh david just said oh i wish
[50:13] i could have some of that cool water
[50:14] from the ice i grew up in bethlehem
[50:16] that's my hometown i wish i just had a
[50:18] drink of that fresh water
[50:21] it's kind of like today well i wish i
[50:22] could just eat at that one restaurant
[50:23] you know oh when i was growing up for me
[50:26] it's like piece of nose pizza hopefully
[50:28] my wife's laughing it down if i could
[50:29] just have a little slice of that
[50:30] pizzanella's pizza
[50:34] and the three mighty men heard it and
[50:36] brother ram said this is so beautiful he
[50:38] said because that's how we should be
[50:39] like the mighty man the very least
[50:42] desire
[50:43] should be our command hallelujah
[50:46] any desire that jesus has for us to do
[50:49] it should be our delight to do it praise
[50:51] god
[50:52] we should sacrifice anything to do it
[50:55] and that's what the story is all about
[50:58] they they basically put their lives on
[51:00] the line just to go get a drink of water
[51:01] for their king
[51:04] and david when he got the cup he said
[51:06] how can i drink this this is the price
[51:08] of blood
[51:09] this you basically gave your sacrifice
[51:11] yourself for a cup of water i'm not
[51:14] worthy this kind of sacrifice only jesus
[51:17] amen only the mighty the mighty one only
[51:20] elohim only if jehovah
[51:22] is worthy of this kind of sacrifice so
[51:24] i'm pouring this out at the drink
[51:26] offering amen because you put your lives
[51:28] on the line only god is worthy amen
[51:32] that's what david said no he taught them
[51:34] look he taught them
[51:37] that you give the greatest honor you
[51:39] give the greatest sacrifice to god
[51:43] that's what that's what david taught
[51:45] these three mighty men
[51:47] do you think they thought less of him
[51:48] because he didn't drink that cup of
[51:49] water
[51:50] i think they thought more of him
[51:55] they put their lives glory they put
[51:57] their lives on the line for david
[52:00] just to make david happy just to give
[52:01] them something what can i do just to
[52:03] make your life a blessing david what can
[52:04] i do yeah i fight through i think
[52:06] brothers i was 15 miles there wasn't
[52:08] soldiers 15 miles thick all the way
[52:10] through but they had they would they
[52:12] call them uh outposts what they call
[52:14] them garrisons garrisons they had
[52:16] garrisons right like little outposts
[52:18] where you know okay and so they had to
[52:19] fight through all these 15 miles just to
[52:22] get a cup of water
[52:25] just for david because they loved him so
[52:27] much and then he pours it out and said
[52:28] jesus deserves this sacrifice
[52:32] we're giving this offering to god
[52:33] because this is the price of blood
[52:35] these men i'm not worthy to drink this
[52:37] only god is worthy to drink that praise
[52:39] god amen
[52:42] but it was wasn't so christ-like
[52:44] david was so christ-like pouring himself
[52:46] pouring out what was his as a drink
[52:48] offering unto god jesus poured out his
[52:50] life for us praise god
[52:52] hallelujah
[52:56] now i wanna
[52:59] i'm just gonna let daniel know sometimes
[53:00] i preach an hour and a half brother okay
[53:02] so
[53:03] i just can't stop
[53:05] and it's partly there
[53:07] they're doing too because they're
[53:08] they're listening
[53:09] if they all fell asleep i'd stop right
[53:10] away
[53:13] but i just i got i got a lot to preach
[53:15] today it's uh a lot to preach maybe i'll
[53:17] save someone wednesday night we'll see i
[53:18] do want to answer that question at the
[53:20] end
[53:20] let's see let's see how many i got here
[53:23] okay how long have i been preaching what
[53:24] does this say on there 53 minutes oh
[53:27] okay now we're all ready all right
[53:29] okay
[53:30] um
[53:34] okay so yeah let me um
[53:35] let's see how far i can get on here
[53:38] and then i'll probably let me set a 15
[53:40] minute time right that gives me an hour
[53:41] and a half i'm sorry hour 15.
[53:43] then it takes me 15 minutes to close
[53:45] all right now let's understand now now
[53:47] we're getting to us in the new testament
[53:49] we've seen all these old tests i tried
[53:50] to give you you know types of the old
[53:52] testament for the new testament but
[53:53] let's look at some more mighty things in
[53:56] the new testament
[53:57] so mighty christians are full of the
[53:59] power of god they've escaped the power
[54:02] of satan
[54:04] amen praise god
[54:06] that's what paul said paul was sent by
[54:08] jesus to open people's eyes by preaching
[54:12] to turn them from darkness satan to
[54:15] light from the power of satan unto god
[54:19] that they'll receive forgiveness of sins
[54:22] and and heavenly inheritance amen
[54:25] through faith that is in jesus name
[54:28] the church each one of us today
[54:31] has to recognize are we under the power
[54:33] of darkness or light
[54:37] now here's i'm going to go through this
[54:38] quickly the bible tells us what power of
[54:40] darkness is it's adultery so sleeping
[54:42] with someone else's wife
[54:43] fornication sex before marriage is the
[54:45] power of satan
[54:47] right
[54:49] uncleanness luxurious living buying
[54:50] fancy cars fancy jewelry that you
[54:52] shouldn't you shouldn't spend money on
[54:54] that
[54:56] lecheviousness lawlessness you don't
[54:57] care what the bible says you do whatever
[54:59] you want that's that's from that's from
[55:00] hell
[55:02] idolatry making anything your god
[55:04] trusting in anything but god witchcraft
[55:06] pregnant devils
[55:08] hatred we know that variance means
[55:09] arguments that's from hell
[55:12] emulations when you pursue jealousy i'm
[55:14] so jealous i'm gonna do this because of
[55:16] someone
[55:17] strike i'm sorry wrath is passionate
[55:19] anger i'm so angry i'm going to act on
[55:22] it
[55:23] strife is positioning well i can do get
[55:25] here i can get this position and i can
[55:27] do that i can make myself greater
[55:29] seditions are divisions well i'll divide
[55:30] this family against that family here's
[55:33] these well this is my own teaching not
[55:34] in the bible i'm going to teach it
[55:35] anyway
[55:37] envy that's kind of like jealousy murder
[55:39] we don't know what murder is drunkenness
[55:40] we all know that revelings are late
[55:42] night parties
[55:45] paul says
[55:46] they that do these things will not
[55:48] inherit the kingdom of god
[55:50] praise god
[55:52] this is the power of satan now daniel
[55:55] how many how many people do you know
[55:56] that do these things
[55:59] brother jose can you translate that from
[56:01] ask him how many people do you know that
[56:03] under the power of darkness
[56:09] lots
[56:10] too many
[56:12] we know a lot of sinners right we some
[56:14] of our family members even some of our
[56:16] friends
[56:17] they're under the power of darkness but
[56:19] god has sent us as mighty men
[56:22] and women
[56:23] to help rescue people out of darkness
[56:26] and bring them to light
[56:29] and what is light
[56:30] light is love
[56:33] joy
[56:34] peace
[56:35] long suffering gentleness goodness faith
[56:38] meekness temperance against such there
[56:41] is no law
[56:43] so jesus and if we're mighty then we
[56:45] will exercise these attributes and not
[56:48] the other one
[56:50] now what's going to get message
[56:51] believers well a lot of us it might be
[56:54] uh we sometimes yeah we sometimes we
[56:55] make idols in our life sometimes we buy
[56:58] things we shouldn't buy we can't afford
[57:00] but we get them anyway for luxurious
[57:01] living
[57:03] wrath
[57:04] stripes editions heresies i know people
[57:06] that have built houses they should not
[57:07] have built it couldn't afford it
[57:09] and then lost them
[57:11] in the message
[57:14] so see you you just have to pray before
[57:16] everything
[57:18] it's a battle you're in a war praise god
[57:20] satan's trying to distract with those
[57:22] works of the flesh but you got to live
[57:24] according to the power of light
[57:27] the kingdom of light praise god
[57:30] now here now church i wrote down here
[57:32] the last thing i desire for preaching
[57:34] these is for us to become prideful
[57:37] thinking that we're the most mighty
[57:38] christians of all time that's not why
[57:40] i'm preaching that i just got done
[57:41] preaching against that
[57:44] but what i'm trying to say is that our
[57:46] weapons are mighty
[57:49] and when we use the weapons with god's
[57:51] leading that makes us mighty but we know
[57:53] it's not our power it's not our weapon
[57:56] someone gave us that weapon praise god
[58:00] the bible says when we walk in the
[58:01] spirit and obey all those things we
[58:03] showed
[58:04] our weapons are mighty through pulling
[58:08] down of complexes
[58:10] and that's where we're saying it's going
[58:11] to battle us too right complexes
[58:13] right
[58:15] so what do we need if we have a
[58:16] if we build up a complex in our mind a
[58:19] fortress in our mind we need something
[58:21] mighty to tear down that complex stone
[58:22] by stone
[58:24] praise god
[58:25] what um
[58:27] a wood piece by wood piece or window by
[58:29] window door by door praise god
[58:32] we need the power of god
[58:34] the weapons of god to cast down piece by
[58:37] piece
[58:38] and anything that exalts itself against
[58:40] the knowledge of god cast it down and
[58:43] bring every thought into the obedience
[58:45] of christ
[58:47] hallelujah
[58:49] i just want to make sure i emphasize
[58:50] that
[58:51] church you and i are mighty because our
[58:53] weapons are mighty
[58:55] talking about the holy ghost that's
[58:57] mighty
[58:58] telling somebody that's in the
[58:59] witchcraft that i'm the holy ghost to a
[59:01] believer that's mighty
[59:03] i'm trying to do some press examples
[59:07] just talk about it you know just talk
[59:08] about i love jesus
[59:10] i am a holy ghost filled saint i am a
[59:13] believer
[59:15] hallelujah
[59:16] starting that mighty word on your lips
[59:18] and start to see what happens
[59:19] you're gonna see good things happen
[59:22] hallelujah
[59:24] glory
[59:27] notice god and his angel called gideon
[59:30] mighty gideon was not calling himself
[59:32] mighty and so the same is true for us we
[59:34] won't call ourselves mighty
[59:35] we won't call ourselves the greatest
[59:37] that we won't call ourselves the goat
[59:39] right
[59:41] god's the one that called it mighty
[59:44] god's spirit sees something mighty in
[59:46] you and i praise god
[59:47] hallelujah
[59:49] we're not privately exalting ourselves
[59:51] we're only mighty because he's with us
[59:54] his weapon is in our hands
[59:56] praise god
[59:59] actually the bible says we have one
[1:00:00] weapon right the sword so we have one so
[1:00:02] yeah
[1:00:02] hallelujah
[1:00:06] now i hold the same scripture up there
[1:00:08] so the mighty word of god pulls down
[1:00:10] complexes now think of this billions of
[1:00:12] people are bound today in complexes
[1:00:16] right i've seen more recently in my
[1:00:17] family you know someone in my family has
[1:00:19] got a complex against my mom
[1:00:21] i can see it
[1:00:23] and then i can see my mom might have the
[1:00:25] same complex back
[1:00:26] it's just it's sad
[1:00:30] but see we don't have to have those in
[1:00:32] our lives now we all have complexes at
[1:00:33] times right we all do i do we all we all
[1:00:36] do
[1:00:37] but the idea is god gave us a weapon to
[1:00:40] overcome the complex and the idea is we
[1:00:42] don't become a slave to our complex now
[1:00:45] think about that if you have a complex
[1:00:47] you're letting the enemy have a part of
[1:00:48] your mind and then that's gonna that
[1:00:50] complex that castle is a fortress the
[1:00:52] enemy has a place on your land
[1:00:55] and he's attacking others through your
[1:00:57] mind
[1:00:59] right you're actually uh you're actually
[1:01:01] using yourself over to hurt other people
[1:01:03] that's why we need a mighty weapon to
[1:01:05] pull that down praise god instead of
[1:01:07] hurting others we need to bless others
[1:01:09] amen amen hallelujah we got a mighty
[1:01:13] weapon that can do that amen it's the
[1:01:15] word of god hallelujah
[1:01:18] it's not imagining the wrong thing about
[1:01:20] someone or something that happened in
[1:01:22] your life but it's imagining the word of
[1:01:24] god fixing the situation
[1:01:27] praise god
[1:01:30] all right
[1:01:32] you are not bound church you're free
[1:01:34] because of the weapons of the word of
[1:01:36] god
[1:01:37] aren't you glad to be free amen
[1:01:39] hallelujah aren't you glad you got a
[1:01:40] great weapon praise god you don't have
[1:01:42] to be a slave
[1:01:44] the devil can try to tell you all he
[1:01:46] wants
[1:01:47] he can come around like a lion
[1:01:49] he can come around like two like men
[1:01:51] praise god
[1:01:52] but you've still got the weapon of god's
[1:01:54] word to drive him away
[1:01:57] i can win this battle i don't have to
[1:01:59] lose this i have to have this bad habit
[1:02:02] i don't have to have this uh the sin of
[1:02:04] my life i can live above this i can be
[1:02:07] mighty because god's made me mighty
[1:02:09] praise god amen glory
[1:02:13] and again my grant said we've got
[1:02:15] authority by jesus christ
[1:02:17] that's the reason devils scream
[1:02:20] it's been a number number of years but
[1:02:22] i've seen the devil scream numerous
[1:02:23] times
[1:02:24] coming out of people
[1:02:26] i've seen that numerous times
[1:02:29] even our church i've seen that before
[1:02:31] numerous times that's good they're
[1:02:32] getting the victory and praise god
[1:02:34] that's what we want praise god
[1:02:36] listen you either scream for the devil
[1:02:37] or scream for jesus i'm going to scream
[1:02:38] for jesus praise god
[1:02:40] hallelujah
[1:02:41] amen
[1:02:43] the holy spirit is here god's authority
[1:02:45] the works that i do shall you do also
[1:02:47] jesus christ the same yesterday today
[1:02:49] and forever i believe him
[1:02:52] so again we're not mighty we don't have
[1:02:54] the power but god gives us the authority
[1:02:57] god gives us the might or the power of
[1:03:00] his
[1:03:00] authority over anything that's all
[1:03:03] exalts itself against the word of god
[1:03:05] praise god
[1:03:10] now i think i'm going to read this yeah
[1:03:12] he says now we're sitting in heavenly
[1:03:13] places and the friends of christ lifted
[1:03:16] above the cares of the world
[1:03:18] into a realm of faith
[1:03:21] the church if you want to be mighty we
[1:03:22] got to leave this realm aren't you glad
[1:03:24] you get to leave this around praise god
[1:03:26] that's what i feel like every time i
[1:03:27] feel like every time we have service
[1:03:28] it's like god uh
[1:03:31] god kind of like transports me from the
[1:03:32] earth
[1:03:34] up to some heavenly place praise god
[1:03:36] and i'm just up here in heavenly now i'm
[1:03:38] a little higher here but that's not what
[1:03:39] i mean praise god
[1:03:40] i just feel like i'm elevating to a
[1:03:42] spiritual mindset
[1:03:44] where i feel so free i i feel uh full of
[1:03:47] god's power i feel full of god's word
[1:03:50] i'm so assured that god is true that his
[1:03:52] word is faithful he's lifted us up in
[1:03:55] heavenly places when we can get the
[1:03:57] the mind of christ the word of god in
[1:03:59] our minds
[1:04:00] we're in a realm of faith
[1:04:04] that's why the holy ghost fell so
[1:04:05] sweetly on wednesday night i don't know
[1:04:07] if you heard that singing at the end
[1:04:08] that was some of the sweetest singing
[1:04:09] i've heard in a long time

[1:04:12] while the girls were weeping and crying
[1:04:14] we were asking for protection over their
[1:04:16] lives against those
[1:04:18] horror movie spirits and everything like

[1:05:39] what time i'm at an hour now
[1:05:41] hour and five hour five okay
[1:05:43] talk about hour 15. let me close this
[1:05:46] is it possible
[1:05:49] for god to use you and i'm gonna
[1:05:50] especially put one of our sisters here
[1:05:53] that's why i only got two well three
[1:05:55] adults right three dogs
[1:05:57] almost one teenager
[1:05:59] unfortunately
[1:06:03] i love it
[1:06:04] all god's time
[1:06:06] is it possible for god to use you
[1:06:07] especially you sisters
[1:06:09] is it possible for god to use you
[1:06:11] sisters to make someone more mighty
[1:06:15] than they already are
[1:06:17] is that possible
[1:06:21] think about that for a moment
[1:06:23] david was a man
[1:06:25] david took these men that were
[1:06:27] full of distress
[1:06:30] full of debts
[1:06:35] they were stressed out
[1:06:37] they were bitter and they had all these
[1:06:38] debts financial debts to pay off
[1:06:41] david took these deading stressed out
[1:06:44] bitter people and slowly by the hand of
[1:06:47] god he changed him into mighty men and
[1:06:51] they the bible says i love it they wax
[1:06:53] greater and greater
[1:06:55] so tell me this when you first got saved
[1:06:57] you were mighty
[1:07:00] now don't go around bragging about it
[1:07:01] but you were
[1:07:02] you had faith
[1:07:04] and then god made you mightier
[1:07:07] and
[1:07:08] he gave you virtue then he gave you
[1:07:10] knowledge and temperance and patience
[1:07:12] and godliness brother kindness god is
[1:07:14] constantly making you more mighty just
[1:07:16] like the mighty men
[1:07:21] and that's what god did with david
[1:07:23] david knew like christ he's the type of
[1:07:25] christ david was already mighty he knew
[1:07:27] how to teach them this is how your hands
[1:07:29] wore this is how your feet go this is
[1:07:30] how your fingers go
[1:07:32] this is how you read your bible
[1:07:34] this is how you pray
[1:07:36] this is how you come to church this is
[1:07:37] how you give your ties and offerings
[1:07:39] this is how you fast
[1:07:41] hallelujah this is the things you allow
[1:07:43] in your house right we teach you how to
[1:07:45] war ahead
[1:07:46] and you become mightier and mightier all
[1:07:49] the time amen
[1:07:51] but is it possible for a woman
[1:07:54] to come along and make let me see this
[1:07:56] make a man
[1:07:58] more mighty than he already is
[1:08:01] yeah in the new testament
[1:08:05] got some good looks out there
[1:08:08] the answer is yes
[1:08:11] so sisters god can use you in a great
[1:08:13] way
[1:08:15] even your little ones think about
[1:08:16] acacia's impact on my cousin adam
[1:08:18] dembele
[1:08:19] okay she got the victory he said he said
[1:08:21] three years he's been clean
[1:08:22] from dope and cocaine and pornography
[1:08:25] three years
[1:08:27] he's the same age as me
[1:08:30] she's 38.
[1:08:34] she's almost 13. god used a 9 and ten
[1:08:37] year old
[1:08:39] glory
[1:08:41] i didn't plan to say this either that's
[1:08:42] this just come to me
[1:08:44] god used a nine eight and nine year old
[1:08:48] to make this man
[1:08:50] more mighty in the word of god
[1:08:52] and honey just so you know he told me he
[1:08:53] said he still listens to brother branham
[1:08:55] every single day
[1:08:59] and the church said amen sometimes
[1:09:01] sometimes i think you know sometimes
[1:09:04] we get so distracted we miss the great
[1:09:06] things god has done among us
[1:09:08] yeah and we always want more we always
[1:09:09] want to do more but sometimes
[1:09:12] i think we forget some of the mighty
[1:09:13] things guys do
[1:09:19] i just wanted to show that an
[1:09:20] eight-year-old can impact a 35
[1:09:23] 6 7. in other words it doesn't matter
[1:09:25] your age as long as you express the love
[1:09:28] of jesus christ it can move mountains
[1:09:33] praise god
[1:09:34] and that's what he told me he told me it
[1:09:35] was her letters her love
[1:09:38] that moved him
[1:09:43] hallelujah
[1:09:48] get your bibles go to acts 18 24.
[1:09:52] is it possible
[1:09:54] for a sister
[1:09:56] to come along and make
[1:09:59] a mighty man
[1:10:01] more mighty
[1:10:04] oh hallelujah
[1:10:05] thank you jesus
[1:10:09] i'd love to make a video about this one
[1:10:10] this is powerful
[1:10:12] to me it is it's just one of those
[1:10:13] it's one of those gems in the scripture
[1:10:15] right you talk preach about mighty men
[1:10:17] you think of you think of big muscle
[1:10:18] don't you and swords and spears and
[1:10:20] killing people
[1:10:22] and in the body you go to the new
[1:10:23] testament and here's a mighty man
[1:10:26] but he's got different kind of
[1:10:27] mightiness
[1:10:28] and a holy ghost-filled woman comes
[1:10:30] around
[1:10:32] and makes her makes him more mighty than
[1:10:34] he already was
[1:10:38] hallelujah amen
[1:10:42] verse 24 and a certain jew named apollos
[1:10:45] born in alexandria an eloquent man and
[1:10:48] mighty
[1:10:51] let's say it again and he was what
[1:10:53] mighty
[1:10:54] in the scriptures
[1:10:57] came to ephesus this man is already
[1:10:59] mighty
[1:11:00] in terms of that amen
[1:11:02] he's one of jesus's mighty men
[1:11:05] amen david's going out but the son of
[1:11:08] david is here hallelujah
[1:11:11] he was like i need a mighty man to teach
[1:11:13] the word of god he said i'm raising up
[1:11:14] apollos
[1:11:16] the bible said he was already mighty
[1:11:18] yeah in the scriptures
[1:11:21] right
[1:11:21] see church that's why brother you you're
[1:11:23] mighty music buddy that's just my
[1:11:25] opinion okay
[1:11:26] i believe it's god though
[1:11:28] see in other words you can be mighty in
[1:11:30] certain gifts in your life
[1:11:32] right
[1:11:33] it doesn't say one thing about his
[1:11:35] miracles does it
[1:11:37] it just says he was mighty in the word
[1:11:42] hallelujah amen that's encouraging to me
[1:11:46] see you you just have to be mighty in
[1:11:47] the gift god has given to you
[1:11:51] you have to be mighty like somebody else
[1:11:54] think of all those mighty men they
[1:11:55] didn't all have to be like a dino
[1:11:59] they could still be mighty
[1:12:01] praise god you can still be mighty amen
[1:12:04] amen you have to have discernment and
[1:12:06] you have to see dreams or prophesy that
[1:12:08] might be god's call that might be what
[1:12:09] god's called you to be mighty in but you
[1:12:11] just got to find what does god want me
[1:12:12] to be mighty in and help me to fight it
[1:12:14] and help me to do it praise god amen
[1:12:16] amen
[1:12:21] that's why i love the bible i just love
[1:12:22] this that's why i love the message
[1:12:24] it's just the bible revealed in a brand
[1:12:26] new way we never saw it before
[1:12:28] so picture apollo he's a mighty man
[1:12:32] you know why he's mighty
[1:12:35] verse 25 this man was instructed in the
[1:12:38] way of the lord
[1:12:40] and being fervent in the spirit he spake
[1:12:41] and taught diligently the things of the
[1:12:44] lord knowing only the baptism of john
[1:12:46] so he'd get up there with malachi he
[1:12:48] take the word of god he start preaching
[1:12:50] there's a voice of one crying in the
[1:12:52] wilderness prepare you the way the lord
[1:12:54] that's thus saith the lord and god sent
[1:12:56] that messenger in this hour amen god
[1:12:58] sent the spirit of elijah in this hour
[1:13:00] hallelujah
[1:13:02] hallelujah
[1:13:04] and he said repent
[1:13:07] he was just pointing to the scriptures
[1:13:08] that john fulfilled preaching john's
[1:13:11] word glory
[1:13:12] preaching the prophets revelation
[1:13:14] hallelujah amen
[1:13:17] pretty easy to say what elijah already
[1:13:20] said praise god that's what we're doing
[1:13:21] amen amen
[1:13:23] we're just saying what elijah's already
[1:13:25] said brother branham what he already
[1:13:27] said in the word of god amen hallelujah
[1:13:30] all i'm encouraged today praise god
[1:13:33] i believe i'm a mighty man of god not by
[1:13:35] self-promotion but by the scriptures
[1:13:37] that god has shown to us
[1:13:39] well i'm either going to choose to be
[1:13:40] weak or mighty which one you wanted me
[1:13:41] to choose praise god
[1:13:43] i'm weak in my flesh but i'm biting the
[1:13:45] soul that's what i'm well that's all i
[1:13:46] want to say my god's grace
[1:13:48] hallelujah
[1:13:53] now go down to verse 28 so you can see
[1:13:58] for he mightily convinced so now we know
[1:14:01] why this man's mighty
[1:14:04] he could take the scriptures of john the
[1:14:06] baptist isaiah 40 verse 3 and malachi
[1:14:09] verse 3 different verses and just lay
[1:14:11] them out and show here here here and he
[1:14:14] would prove john's baptism was the right
[1:14:16] that you must repent
[1:14:19] and he convinced them that means he
[1:14:21] could persuade people to get baptized
[1:14:24] now george think about this how many
[1:14:25] people are simon convinced to be
[1:14:26] baptized
[1:14:28] that's why i don't care what anybody
[1:14:29] says about his height that guy's a
[1:14:30] mighty man in my eyes
[1:14:33] i don't care people make fun of him all
[1:14:34] the time i just stand right up far i
[1:14:35] said but he's got the heart of a lion
[1:14:38] my cousin just did that at that
[1:14:39] graduation party made fun of him i said
[1:14:42] i said matt i said he's got the heart
[1:14:44] he's the i said he's got the biggest
[1:14:45] heart i know he's got the heart of a
[1:14:46] lion
[1:14:48] i stood up for him
[1:14:49] because he's a mighty man of mine he
[1:14:51] brought me the word
[1:14:52] amen he stood up to my flesh he stood up
[1:14:55] to my pride amen he stood up to my
[1:14:57] denomination and brought me the word he
[1:14:59] convinced me by the scriptures of the
[1:15:01] spirit of elijah amen amen oh hallelujah
[1:15:04] i've seen it now i didn't see that
[1:15:05] before amen now i see it praise god
[1:15:09] why was he mighty because he could
[1:15:10] convince someone john's baptism was
[1:15:13] right
[1:15:14] yeah
[1:15:16] and that publicly he could publicly get
[1:15:18] up in front of people
[1:15:20] and
[1:15:21] show by the scriptures that jesus was
[1:15:23] the christ
[1:15:25] oh my
[1:15:27] why was he mighty what made him mighty
[1:15:30] he knew the bible
[1:15:32] he could preach in public
[1:15:34] he could convince people to be baptized
[1:15:36] to john's baptism and believe jesus
[1:15:39] christ was the messiah
[1:15:41] that's what made him mighty
[1:15:43] did he kill 800 at one time
[1:15:46] okay did he kill any lions
[1:15:49] how about spiders
[1:15:52] how about uh snakes
[1:15:55] boa constrictors
[1:15:57] no what made him mighty was that he
[1:15:59] loved the word of god and he wanted to
[1:16:01] see people baptized
[1:16:03] he wanted to see people repent and
[1:16:05] believe in jesus christ and so he gave
[1:16:07] himself to the word study the word of
[1:16:09] god and he spoke the word with fervency
[1:16:12] with zeal praise god and god called it
[1:16:14] mighty praise god
[1:16:18] amen one time this mighty man
[1:16:21] come in contact with some mightier
[1:16:23] people
[1:16:26] ah
[1:16:27] he come in contact with the husband and
[1:16:29] wife team the bible say anything about
[1:16:31] their children
[1:16:32] bob just says aquila priscilla
[1:16:35] the bible said this mighty man
[1:16:37] came in contact with a husband and wife
[1:16:40] ministry team can i say it like that
[1:16:44] i love the word of god i love the word
[1:16:47] of god they saw this they there's no
[1:16:49] doubt church no doubt they sat in the
[1:16:50] congregation they said
[1:16:52] ah that's a mighty different
[1:16:55] oh look at these people repenting oh you
[1:16:57] just took them out and baptized them
[1:16:58] it's a mighty gift of god
[1:17:01] he can really preach
[1:17:04] but there's things that we know
[1:17:06] that are deeper than this
[1:17:08] we can take him deeper in the message
[1:17:12] he's got good revelation but god's got a
[1:17:14] little more of it
[1:17:16] if we can just sit down and we can just
[1:17:18] sit down with him and have a little
[1:17:19] bible study with him
[1:17:21] glory amen
[1:17:23] we're gonna make him more mighty
[1:17:26] because the bible already said he was
[1:17:27] mighty right
[1:17:29] in other words he was only justified
[1:17:32] and sanctified
[1:17:34] he did not have the baptism of the holy
[1:17:35] ghost but here come a husband and wife
[1:17:38] team who had the baptism of the holy
[1:17:40] ghost
[1:17:41] they saw a mighty person but they said
[1:17:44] we can make him mightier
[1:17:47] by the grace of god
[1:17:52] hallelujah
[1:17:55] and what happened to verse 26 church
[1:17:59] and he began to speak boldly in the
[1:18:01] synagogue whom when aquila and priscilla
[1:18:04] had heard they took him unto them
[1:18:06] and expounded unto him the way of god
[1:18:09] more
[1:18:10] perfectly in other words he had a good
[1:18:13] understanding
[1:18:14] but when these two holy ghost-filled
[1:18:16] saints come come by now who did who
[1:18:18] knows who did aquila and priscilla hear
[1:18:21] the gospel from
[1:18:23] paul
[1:18:24] let's give her two
[1:18:27] it's sunday morning
[1:18:30] oh
[1:18:31] in other words
[1:18:32] aquila priscilla saw paul the church age
[1:18:35] messenger amen
[1:18:38] and the bible said they started a church
[1:18:39] in their own house amen yeah
[1:18:42] but then they got kicked out of rome
[1:18:43] because there was this uh racism against
[1:18:45] jews so they left
[1:18:47] and so see church god is in all of your
[1:18:49] struggles
[1:18:50] yes they lost their home
[1:18:52] they lost their home
[1:18:54] and god was in every one of them
[1:18:56] struggles praise god because he was
[1:18:57] sending them to go out and win other
[1:18:59] souls amen
[1:19:01] they had they lived in that city for a
[1:19:03] time and season they lived in that house
[1:19:05] for a particular time in season but then
[1:19:07] god had to move them praise god and god
[1:19:09] was going to use them to witness the
[1:19:11] word of god and make somebody else more
[1:19:13] mighty praise god
[1:19:21] god's the one moving us
[1:19:24] because god wants you to recognize
[1:19:26] someone
[1:19:27] their current position as mighty and god
[1:19:29] wants you not paul
[1:19:32] god don't want the prophet to do it god
[1:19:33] wants you to do it
[1:19:39] god wants you to find somebody who's
[1:19:41] mighty
[1:19:43] just brothers no no no no aquila and
[1:19:47] priscilla yeah
[1:19:51] and use those two to raise to share the
[1:19:53] message witness the message and raise
[1:19:56] them up to be greater than what they
[1:19:57] were in other words be baptized with the
[1:19:59] holy ghost
[1:20:02] a church we know there's no such thing
[1:20:03] as women preachers but women can give
[1:20:06] words of wisdom
[1:20:08] they can give words of knowledge they
[1:20:10] can give words of prophecy words of
[1:20:12] interpretation
[1:20:13] they can have discerning of spirit which
[1:20:15] means that they'll use their words to
[1:20:16] say this was the right spirit this was
[1:20:18] the wrong spirit thus saith the lord
[1:20:21] think about how much a woman can speak
[1:20:24] right
[1:20:26] and she can testify all those things and
[1:20:28] she can testify
[1:20:31] so it wasn't just aquila the bible said
[1:20:33] they ever say day
[1:20:35] so see sisters you got something you can
[1:20:36] do
[1:20:38] i know it's good to be humble to miss it
[1:20:40] we love you for that but there's gonna
[1:20:41] be a time glory there's gonna be a time
[1:20:43] when god wants to use you a mighty
[1:20:45] sister
[1:20:46] full of faith glory
[1:20:48] for the holy ghost to share your
[1:20:50] testimony glory
[1:20:54] to have a burden to share the message
[1:20:56] with somebody else in order to raise
[1:20:58] them up so they can become all that god
[1:21:00] has called them to be
[1:21:03] because you've heard the prophet of the
[1:21:05] day
[1:21:06] because you've been taught the message
[1:21:07] of the hour by the prophet of god
[1:21:11] oh hallelujah let's stand our feet
[1:21:13] praise god
[1:21:14] oh thank you jesus
[1:21:17] resistance can come
[1:21:20] we learned some great lessons here
[1:21:21] church
[1:21:23] could you play gratitude better than i'd
[1:21:24] be i'd like to hear that song that's
[1:21:26] okay unless you got something do you
[1:21:27] have a song before you okay have you had
[1:21:29] one i'd like you to keep yourself
[1:21:32] church what do we learn here
[1:21:35] a believer can be mighty exercising his
[1:21:38] or her gift before the baptism of the
[1:21:40] holy ghost right
[1:21:42] apollos was instructed fervent
[1:21:44] convincing eloquent and diligent
[1:21:48] and the bible called him mighty
[1:21:50] now how many of us want to be all those
[1:21:52] things
[1:21:53] i want to be eloquent diligent fervent
[1:21:55] amen
[1:21:59] and you can be mighty before you get the
[1:22:00] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:22:03] that's why i want everybody to even the
[1:22:05] children
[1:22:06] you can be mighty before you have the
[1:22:08] baptism of the holy ghost
[1:22:10] but you got to be these things you got
[1:22:12] to be fervent you got to be diligent got
[1:22:13] to be dedicated you got to know the word
[1:22:16] you got to love the word praise god
[1:22:18] if you want to be mighty you got to have
[1:22:19] the mighty sword you have the mighty
[1:22:21] weapons
[1:22:23] and then one holy ghost-filled believer
[1:22:25] can help a sanctified believer become
[1:22:27] even more mighty in the operation of
[1:22:30] their gifts
[1:22:35] so what's the answer to the question
[1:22:36] it's yes
[1:22:38] aquila and priscilla helped depos become
[1:22:41] even more mighty
[1:22:43] in operating his teaching gift now the
