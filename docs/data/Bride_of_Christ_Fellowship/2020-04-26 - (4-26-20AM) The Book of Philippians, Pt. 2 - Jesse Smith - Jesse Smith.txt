okay here okay thank you acts 1612 praise the Lord x16 12 I will just read verse 12 and then we'll go to Philippians 4 acts 16 12 says and from thence to Philip I which is the chief city of that part of Macedonia and a colony and we were in that city abiding certain days all right let's go to Philippians four seven and eight this is a really good scripture to meta to use for meditation during this you know strange time of this coronavirus what a very fitting scripture we always need to meditate on the things that are true holy honest just a good report there's any praise those are the things we should be meditating on at this time amen thank God first word clip Ian's four seven and eight let's read that together verse seven on three one two three and the peace of God which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through Christ Jesus finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure

bless yous being seated praise God praise the Lord we're thankful for God's word today and trust that we'll be able to speak something that the Lord will take and bless to our hearts and I believe he will so let's start let's go back to x16 I like to start there before we get into Philippians chapter 1 I like the Lord willing get to flipping chapter 1 today and begin looking at some of these scriptures here Paul is writing last Sunday we looked at the great work that God started there in Philippi and we've kind of looked at the background of it and also saw a little bit how brother Branham continued the apostolic pattern that Paul started there was no greater missionary than Paul outside of Christ and the way Paul started he would go into a city of course he had to be led by the Holy Spirit he had to be led to a place he tried to go to Asia the Holy Spirit forbade him so he went somewhere else and then wherever he went then God would there be Souls ready to hear him because God will never send anybody someplace unless he's got a purpose for it praise God and like the Bible says if God gives you a gift he's gonna open up a room for you to use that gift praise God Amen thank the Lord for that and so God had a soul he had souls there in Philippi and so Paul went there he let felt led by the holy spirit and he just said well it's time to pray I'm just gonna go down to the river to pray and he found a little woman there named Lydia and the Bible said the Lord opened her heart praise God and then threw her Lydia's life and her home opening up this church sprang up and then Paul we know other things happen we'll read those today but then he leaves and then 11 years later he writes this letter here to minister to the Philippians but now let's go back here to acts 16 we started at verse 12 and let's see again how this church starts it's such a beautiful encouraging portion of scripture to see how God started it now we read verse 12 and then verse 13 14 and 15 is what the Lord does in the life of Lydia the first European convert I just love that idea of the Lord opened her heart who opened your heart the Lord opened your heart praise God the Bible said that God starts the work praise God and just like God you know that when the earth was with dark without form and void what what started it God started it by sending his Holy Spirit to hover over the darkness praise God and out of that darkness came forth life praise God and that's what we see what God does God God finds us he leaves the 99 right he searches out the one and so God searches out Lydia and her house and God starts a work God opens it up you know the Bible said the goodness of God leads us to repentance praise God and so God starts it that way he does something good praise God he he he starts he he gets our attention and he starts trying to get our hearts to see His grace and His mercy and through His grace and His goodness we opened the hearts praise God we open our hearts to God and we receive God as we saw Wednesday every decision we make is based upon love it's either our love for God or the love for the things of the world right it's all based upon love jesus said the condemnation came to them because they love darkness more than they love light but then God says the greatest commandment is to love the Lord thy God with all thine heart and with all I so Eva how do I hear today by your love for God Amon that's why I'm here because of my love for God because God has showed his love to us amen through the cross of Jesus Christ now here he sits down and for this Sabbath day prayer meeting and Lydia hears the word and then she opens her heart and then when her hearts open her house opens I love that praise God when your heart really opens your whole life is open to God Lord ma you can use my house you can use my voice you can use everything use my car you use all of me Lord you use everything of me because you've opened my heart now my whole life is open for you praise God Lord used me whatever you'd have my life to accomplish use me praise God we don't want to close our lives up you know that's the temptation of where Satan wants to get people today through depression and you know they are other discouragements you know there will be discouragements in our lives and we have a choice and some people choose to close themselves up and and get discouraged and and isolate themselves that's just what Satan once he wants people to be closed up but we have to open our hearts praise God we have to open our minds to the things of God and not shut it down and try to keep the thing of God out we've got to open up the doors right if you want your house clean you know of natural open up the windows praise God it let the fresh air come in praise God open it up and we got to open up our will is what needs to be opened up praise God Lord I'm willing to do your your I'm willing to hear your word I'm willing to give it another chance praise God I'm willing to to change my life I know something needs to change and I'm willing to open up to you and let your word bring life to my life amen praise God and so she had an open heart which produced an open house praise God Amen now we go look to the next scripture here mercy sixteen now see paw doesn't change his his routine his routine is pray on the Sabbath pray preach let God open people's hearts praise God one at a time amen one at a time that's all we are today every church is like that you keep preaching you keep being faithful to God he'll open up one heart at a time praise the Lord and that's over sixteen and it came to pass as we went to prayer see he does the same thing he knows I've gotten to be devoted to prayer I've got to just keep doing what God's calling us to do God calls us to assemble let's just keep assembling praise God let's keep praying hallelujah and then the Bible sent a certain damsel possessed with the spirit of divination Metis which brought her master's much gain by sue saying the same followed Paul and us and cried saying these men are the servants of the Most High God which show unto us the way of salvation then that striking a demon-possessed woman will follow the man of God the Bible said she followed us this should remind us of the maniac of gaturro right he was full of demons but yet he kept being came he came running to Jesus and brother man tells us why because there was a part of him that wouldn't be free from those demons so see Church there's times and if demon-possessed people or people having trouble around us there's a reason they're around us it's because something in their hearts desires to be saved amen and so that's why just like the maniac he wanted to be free and so Jesus could set him free now touch you know we know this that program says and we know in the scripture a person can't be delivered from demons unless they want to be delivered right they have to want to do it because that demon has possessed their house they've given over their house and the spoils they've given it over to the enemy and so this woman is demon-possessed but there's something a part of her that wants to be free amen so she follows the man God and so the demon-possessed people are she's following the true man of God saying he's a true man of God amen I like that you know when you know we know there's just church members and they don't believe in the things of God but I like how they can look at us they can look at you and say well I'm not sure you know there's a lot of people out there but I know one person that's a Christian that's brother Jose praise God amen they could recognize that you're a true you're a true Christian praise God I don't know many like there's a sister that lives out in Columbus and she put on Facebook a few years ago she said she said I know she said there's one person that's gonna make it it's brother Jesse and she talked about the rapture and that made me feel good because she's left a message she was raising the message left the message but she put that little comment on there she's like if one person's gonna make it it's gonna be brother Jesse and his family of course that we know we don't know that but I believe that I'm gonna be one amongst the many that make it praise God or he say the few but I'm for us as many but I like that when people can look at our lives and they can say if someone's gonna make it it's gonna be them because they love the Lord and so that's what and of course yeah this woman cuts her hair now she wears pants and she was makeup she was raised the message but left it but they can still see the love of God I like that and she wanted to be free and she said they're the servants of the Most High God I don't think I ever told this testimony but my wife would told me years ago even when she was a sinner growing up as a teenager one of her friend's mother's saw a halo or light not maybe not a halo off to ask my wife after servers but there's a light there was an anointing or aura that rested over my wife that's pretty awesome praise God even as a teenager and she cut her hair and wore makeup and didn't know the message never even heard of the message that whole time this this mother of one of her friends said did you know you have a spirit over you and my wife was I got in understand it till now Ray's got just like brother Brad before he was a Christian ever on the bus with that demon-possessed she said you're born under a sign and he said no no we're we talking about that Rodan was like he was like lines and the woman Loran was lying to the woman on the bus no no no no I'm gonna oh there's nothing special about me see God in other words God knows them better his praise God you're what you're a child of God amen and you always were a child of God hallelujah and you keep serving God you the longer you serve God the more you'll be convinced that you're a child of God no matter if other people want to fall away or what they want to do you know there's something different about you you love God and you're gonna serve God and there's an anointing on you that's just going to be greater than other people because of God's grace amen because you love God amen and you you want to obey God and you want to serve God and you want to be a part of the rapture praise God you want to go to heaven you were to walk those pearly gates and you want to be in the presence of Jesus Christ and cast your crown at his feet praise God you were there something about you right just like with my wife there was something about her you know it's funny about what my mother made all these jokes when my wife and I started dating in high school my I guess my wife or my mother told Kristen before we were date you know before your marriage she's like Jesse changed girlfriends like t-shirts weather and you know we just did little boy girlfriend stuff nothing you know nothing real serious anything like that I just you know what I don't like you anymore I like you I don't like you anymore but there's something when I met Kristen I just couldn't I could never do that I could never I just was like tied to her you know it's because the Bible says that the woman is a part of the man praise God Eve was part of Adam praise God and like brother says if you didn't get the right one over here you'll get the right one over there understand that but there has to be a truth because Eve came out of Adam praise God and so there's there something about you you know and even in the newspaper even the newspaper when I was a senior I wasn't even Christian I finished I graduated high school and the man the newspaper writer said there was only one this word to describe Jesse Smith special he said and I can look back now and I can see why did why was that because God had something all my life praise God there was a call just like Paul before he became Paul he had such a zeal but it's for the zeal for the wrong thing but everybody can see he's he's really gifted here he's good he's really zealous but he just had the wrong zeal but once he met that light praise God amen he was able to walk in obedience to the true Word of God and now have zeal for Christ amen see people there's something about your life that God has upon your life praise God and so this woman can see he's a man of God now Church thing about that all those millions of people they're walking around Phillipi and there's one and everybody else is just going about their business and doing their Roman business and everything like that but there's one demon-possessed woman said he's a real servant of God he's and he he's just got a real small church he's just got a real small message Church nothing big has happened yet all she did was going preach at a prayer meeting and Lydia opened up her house that's all he's got is one house right now a very small message church and yet all this time you know this woman is after him and we know the story how it goes on and the Bible said she did this many days and Paul being grieved turned and said to the spirit I command thee in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her and he came out the same hour praise God what a beautiful story this fortune-telling devil was anointing this woman and she was being used like a slave right she was being used like a slave and she was able to contact evil spirits and and guess fortunes and make them lots of money it was a and this was obviously a big hub of sorcery and witchcraft and yet she didn't want to be a slave because Paul could not have cast like we can't force people to be saved right we can't force demons to move we have no power but we do have a thority praise God but even with this Authority it's got to be in the timing of God and it has to be that person's will to be free from the demons praise God I love this here Paul he's greed many days and brother man uses his Scripture and the prisoner sermon he said a prisoner of Christ Paul couldn't cast it out when he wanted to he had to wait for the tiny of God and church that's where we get discouraged we read the Bible and see all these miracles and we just want to do a miracle now don't know about you but that's how I feel many times I just want to see a miracle now but God is going to teach us it's not in our time it's in his time it's not by our work or our power but it's by his leadership and his anointing praise God as that's the same thing pause he's already learned that he said I can't do anything he said but he waited to the Holy Spirit anointed him and he commanded in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost come out of her no you know didn't do that in the name of the son come out of her no sir he said in the name of Jesus Christ amen and that's the name praise God that's the name that causes Devils to tremble praise God I remember when I first cast out those demons on those women I first asked him I said do you want to be free and they said yes and as soon as I grabbed her hand and I said Satan I come against you by the blood of Jesus Christ as soon as I said the blood of Jesus Christ she started shaking like that and I said oh my so I just kept praying praying and said to the name of Jesus Christ come out and after a little bit of fighting and testing and polling she let out a big scream and fell down as one dead but I noticed when I started when I started claiming the blood of Jesus Christ amen that spirit knew it was going to go praise God because the blood purchased this person's soul praise God amen the blood paid the price for this person's deliverance amen that blood paid the price and her forgiveness and that means she doesn't have to be a slave sinner shall no longer have dominion over you praise God amen I know yeah they were by they were in bondage to sin before brother of Jesus Christ many times but Jesus Christ blood cream to separate us from our sins amen thank the Lord and he came out that same hour praise God oh I love it the power of the Holy Spirit and like I told you here at our church like I said a few years ago I went back to word there were low seats and I said in the name of Jesus Christ I commend that spirit to leave 11 days later that spirit left the church what do we have to do we have to wait till we're led of the Lord to speak God's Word amen we got to be patient enough we got to be godly enough we got to be in tune with God through prayer enough so that we at the time we say it is the right time to say it praise God that's it that's the reason you know things maybe don't happen when when they should is because we're kind of late on it all right or maybe we're not in touch with the Holy Spirit but we got to be in touch with the Holy Spirit praise God we have to do that by the grace of the Lord that's why I'm encouraged with who is dad getting better because he wasn't talking at first and I just I had that spirit that a scripture come to me there's power of life in the tongue praise God and we just got to keep speaking God's Word amen look for the regrets that you gotta look for the spirit how its leading you at that time he men you see God's not just out there God's with us right now praise God he wants to be with us right now he wants to be amongst us he wants to be caught on the scene praise God he's doing something for us praise the Lord see God doesn't need devils to witness for him but sometimes that he he uses it sometimes he uses it ah the member James said even the demons believe and they tremble at the name of Jesus Church you and I we just got to speak that name of Jesus in our homes speak it on the job in the name of Jesus in the name of Jesus before you call somebody gotta talk do you speak the name of Jesus it will cause those demons to move amen that's the power in the name demon have to tremble at the name of Jesus Christ praise God now let's just speak it and let's go forward why cry speak right God told Moses don't stop don't stop he said just speak the word he had to wait to get the word of the Lord once he got the word Lord the word of Lord said speak and go forward amen and many times that's what will do it which is a good thing we should stop and get the word of the Lord speak the word Lord and then move on in faith with with God's Word hallelujah now look at he says here now verse 19 and when her master saw that the hope of the gains was gone they caught Paul and Silas and drew them in the market under the rulers and brought them to the magistrate saying these men being Jews do exceedingly trouble our city and teach customs which are not lawful for us to receive neither to observe being Romans now why they're doing this because they lost their money why do people many times attack Christians because they lose their benefits right it's all selfishly motivated if someone's attacking you it's because they got the wrong motivation praise God their motivation is we lost our money so I'm gonna take it out on these guys Church many times people attack you because they like something that you got that's right they don't know how to get it so they attack the real man or woman of God that's right look at them attack him now verse 22 and the multitude rose up together against them and the magistrates rent off their clothes and commanded to beat them and when they laid many stripes upon them they cast them into prison charging the jailer to keep them safely who having received such a charge thrust them in the inner prison and made their feet fast in the stocks I see people might have been discouraged right they might have been discouraged oh we just saved a few souls and we just cast out a demon but now we're in prison and church they had every right they could have acted at every right to be discouraged or down and defeated but God was gonna do a great shaking in this prison house praise God God was going to do a great thing and God was going to show this city that he was God amen this is a city that's given over to demons and God was going to shake this place and give them a chance my I think about a church as I said you can go there today and you can see the ruins of this city of that part of the city rather now the modern part moved but you can go back and God was going to give that generation a chance to hear the word of God amen and God is giving this city a chance to hear his word amen everywhere he goes any time God does something great any time God's Spirit is moving he's trying to shake the city praise God he's trying to give that generation a chance to hear God's Word I'm glad I heard it praise God amen that's what I believe with you know that the city the the the town I was raised in they will have no excuses on the day of judgment because God healed my momma cancer in that city they'll have no excuses and then can my brother camps are that Church there's just a 5-10 minutes away there they have no excuses on the day of judgment cuz that and then my mother for the last 25 years she has fed the poor every Christmas Thanksgiving and Easter she's fed the poor sometimes two hundred meals on each of those days that's six hundred meals in a year now I'm no excuse on that day that there wasn't a living God and God doesn't heal we never heard the word now no excuses praise God and so it's our duty now to live such a godly life at this town and our families have to witness that there is a Living God amen we don't know how God's going to do that God might heal someone of us of cancer God might do so you might raise somebody from the dead we don't know but we got to faithfully serve God until God gives the witness and gives this generation an opportunity to receive his word because the Bible said he's never left himself without a witness amen praise God now that we got to say like this there might be a five talent witness among us there might be a two talent witness among us there might just be a one Talent witness among us but whenever tale he's given to us let's invest in it with all of our hearts and bring for double let's bring forth fruit unto the Lord praise God right because not every town had a Paul right now he would he was a special man he was one of the seven stars in the hand of Christ Paul are all the gifts of the Spirit all the preaching gifts he had all of them and he did these great mighty miracles and not everybody of course would be on his level but God leaves a witness in every generation and we must be those witnesses and look what they did they cast him into the prison I like this my verse 25 and that midnight Paul and Silas prayed and sang praises unto God and the prisoners heard them there's only one time I was up all night with sickness in that and I tried I prayed it off and on that night all night I had what was it strep throat that's the that's the day I passed out at the other church remember that Lydia I passed out and John had to preach it uh I tried to curse that strep throat all night I didn't know what it was till later and I tried to God send me a vision I want to see angels and I didn't feel nothing all night but I tried I pressed through with all and I tried singing I tried everything and I I felt a little better than the mornings that's where I got dressing so I was gonna go preach it I'm gonna try to just trust God but see I didn't have enough saith the Lord but that's one time when I tried to pray through the night as I woke up and in and out of fever and trying to sing and I asked God for a vision I asked God to heal me it didn't come that way but it didn't discourage me I mean I was so disappointed I didn't get healed I tried I really cried out to God but that wasn't God's call for that time and then I've had other times I told you before I felt like I was going to throw up you know on a Sunday night it's happened to numerous times and I got I thought oh I got to work tomorrow I've gone down to my knees on my bed and I said Lord I'm in the post of duty and I laid my hand on my stomach I said in the name of Jesus Christ I don't have time for this through the sickness and within five minutes God knows I was well praise God because of his mercy and grace so sometimes he does it sometime sometimes he must suffer but the thing to do is have faith praise God confess God's Word be a faithful witness praise God trust God believe God and know that whatever he allows in your life it's for his glory so they pray and sing at midnight and the prisoners heard them I wonder what they thought of this midnight song this midnight melody I wonder what they thought of that and I wonder you know the Bible doesn't tell us that wonderful India was up praying that night for because member it happened to Peter - Peter was in prison and God brought him out of prison because they were in that group prayer I wonder if that's what Lydia was doing with the family so he's praying in and they're they're praying and they're singing now church that won't encourage us in our darkest hour may God may we be humble enough to just thank God and pray and sing his praises and raise our hands and worship remember his feet are chained up he can't walk he he can't go anywhere but he can't raise his hands amen right Scott he can't move his feet he can't physically go anywhere but he can lift he can lift his hands to heaven and sing and pray he can lift his voice and God honored their worship suddenly there was a great earthquake set the foundations the prison were shaken and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's bands were loosed so godness doesn't loose pawns Silas all of them all of them even though they didn't deserve it praise God and the keeper of the prison awakened out of his sleep and seeing the prison doors open he drew out his sword and would have killed himself supposing that the prisoners had been fled but Paul cried with a loud voice saying do thyself no harm for we are all here he's remember in those days are in the Roman days even I was when the crucifixion of Christ took place those there was a Romans during group if that person they crucified didn't die then the Roman had to die the soldier the soldiers that were there at Jesus tomb if Jesus body got out they had to die so wonder what happened that was Roman law if that's why they were so good at their jobs that's why those soldiers you know it's stuck in with the spears to make sure they are dead because if they don't die they're gonna die so Paul says he says sir don't kill yourself we're still all here all the prisoners are here they're just loose stay men right look at the power of God the church if God can loose our natural of their natural bands what about our spiritual bands praise God if God can can loose your those natural physical chains what about our diction's praise God what about our bad habits God can send all of us free praise God amen if he can do these natural things how much more could he do spiritual things by the blood of his son amen hallelujah what a beautiful story he says do thyself no harm verse 29 then he called for a light and sprang in and came trembling and fell down before Paul and Silas to see all these things are working together God knew there was a little woman there that wanted to be delivered from those demon powers so God sent a man of God to do it God knew there was a no prison guard who wanted to be saved amen and not just him but his whole house amen hallelujah are you happy with just you being saved or do you want to see everyone in your house saved amen I want to see all the house saying praise God so God knew there was a prison guard though the way to get his attention would be to shake his life I think that's what God is doing right now don't you think for the Jose now they shaking this earth with the coronavirus amen he shake his saying anybody who wants to be saying you better get saved praise God amen and the Bible said and then he said unto them and verse 30 sirs what must I do to be saved and they said believe on the Lord Jesus and thou shalt be saved and thy house oh what a promise praise God what a promise he said believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and they shall be saved and thy house so you want to see your family save just keep believing you want to see somebody saved you want to see your family their life change just believe just trust God just love God just worship God we cannot doubt God we've got to believe God we got to trust him we've got to know that he hears our prayers we got to know that he cares and that he loves the sinner praise God and he has a great plan and his ways as we said last week his ways are higher than our ways his ways are past finding out praise God and if God saved a wretch like you and I God can save them as well praise the Lord amen they speak unto Him the word of the Lord and to all that were in his house and he took them the same hour of the night now I don't know how they did this legally whether he because they were prisoners now and washed their stripes and was baptized he and of his house straightway so remember they just got beaten up Paul's back was probably like hamburger right they beat him up and put him in jail with the Bible said that night they washed all their stripes cleaned off their wounds and then Paul with his stripes baptized this the guy that probably we whipped and maybe or maybe one of his buddies whipped him the very guy the very group he finds mercy he sweet you got to be a Holy Ghost filled st. to do something like that somebody can beat you up and speak awful and just tear you down and leave you for dead in a jail but you had that very same night that someone treated like that you can turn around and baptize them and welcomed him into the family of God uh-huh you've got to have a new nature you got a have eternal life living in you praise God amen that's why brother cams testimony so powerful because for a year he fought us he fought simontann he's like you you're wrong and he tried talk me out of it and I don't want to talk to him anymore you know but all of a sudden the revelation struck him and he said the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost is Jesus Christ where can I be baptized call up that preacher brother Brooks let me be baptized amen and now God has used brother Ken to baptize many a soul many a soul have been baptized there it's that change it's that transformation power of God's Spirit amen thank the Lord all of us look he in his house so the very thing he desired he had to been he had been desiring this he had have known this cities filled with sorcery miss cities through with idolatry he hadn't been hungry for God because God made a way that he could be saved and they took he in his house and baptized all them straightway praise God when I almost got all my house baptized straightway we get I see that's what happened God just got shook it and everybody got baptized God had an earthquake and it caused everybody to get baptized we'll see we'll see how many people get baptized because it's coronavirus praise God I don't know how many but it's just a time of shaking a member church were in the gleaning time remember the feast of weeks I mentioned on Easter we're at the very end of that and God said when you harvest leave some there for the Gleaners where were just the Gleaners there's not going to be a whole lot but when there's one or two we ought to rejoice amen because that's prophetic before the trumpets can sound before the two witnesses can sound there's got to be Gleaners there's got to be people that will glean for those last few Souls that's prophetically what you are not are to be doing to try to find souls that we can believe just a few here just a few there and bring them into God's kingdom glory verse 34 when he had brought them into his house he set meat before them and rejoiced believing in God with all of his house just a few hours ago he was sleeping all these noisy prisoners and they're just in a few moments he gives he washes the guy's back he gets baptized vibe he sets meat before him praise God his house is open to the messenger of the hour praise God now look here verses thirty five to forty finish this this particular portion of Philippi and this is all the Bible says about the beginning of Philip I praise the Lord unless redone and when it was day the magistrate sent the sergeant saying let these men let those men go and the keeper of the prison told the saying nopal the magistrates have sent to let you go now therefore depart and go in peace now look at this leaders were so shocked can you imagine there's a prison over there an Akron down the road he imagine if that whole place was shaked in that it was just totally ever every prisoner was loosed it just shook these leaders see they knew the power Satan right because they had sorcery they Devils and all kinds of things but then they saw the real power of God and so they say fine get these guys out of here just like the maniac of got it right they said we'd rather have pigs and we'd rather have demon-possessed men than have this Jesus amongst us the same thing happened to Paul they said get this man out of here depart and go in peace verse 37 but Paul said unto them they have beaten us openly can uncondensed and if cast us into prison and now do they thrust us out privately nay verily but let them come themselves and fetch us out so Paul saying I'm a Roman if they want to get me out they're going to come get me because I'm a Roman they have to do it by the law now he knows right he knows that what's gonna easy you know he's got to go to give his life in Rome verse 38 and the sergeant's told these words and the magistrates and they feared when I heard that they were Romans see cuz you can't just you can't do it a Rome in a certain way you got to treat the Romans according to the law verse 39 and they came and besought them see they knew this should not have beat him because they were Romans and they came and besought them and brought them out and desire them to depart out of the country and they went out of the prison and entered in the house of Lydia and when they had seen the brother and they comforted them and departed look at this in one case leave this church in one case Paul obeyed the law right another case he didn't obey the law there's a time there's a time to obey it there's a time not see that that's exactly right look at that see he goes to the house of Lydia and so he says fine he says if they want me to go I'll go and there's other times they would preach and and just go against them right and preach God's Word when there's times you obey the law of God or the law of man as well I imagine what that last meeting was like you know so Lydia was there met the boss of certain days right certain days I imagine you know she she'd pray for this all of her life God send a man of God to our parts o Lord send a man of God it really will preach your word and show us your power your glory and then he comes in but don't say very long now look at that God he starts a little church they stay there for a certain number of days and then the man of God moves on do you think they were discouraged probably a little bit but don't you know if God started to church there he would raise somebody up to lead the church praise God he's obligated right God's obligated and so just because the man of God just because the Prophet leaves doesn't mean God's gonna leave the church is that right just cuz programs off the scene don't mean the same God isn't here praise God God is still here it's all parts our turn now to seek the Lord while he may be found call upon him while he's not praise God it's our opportunity to preach the Word of God in the message and to live this word before everybody it's our opportunity and that's it that should be an exciting thing praise God and his last words are comfort don't be discouraged sister Lydia I know we didn't get all the time here I would like to stay longer to teach you God's Word but there's faithful men you know fo fresh and there's different ones I'll send Timothy and different ones like that don't be discourage God started the church here he's gonna be with the church here praise God I won't be here the whole time I've got other place I got to go crazy but you don't be discouraged you just trust in the Living God I mean it be comforted don't be discouraged be encouraged praise God but when our leaders not here the great man of God's not here but you're here I don't know but God still has a witness here praise God see Church every one of you is so important to God you all fit into God's plan praise the Lord God starts a church and then he moves the Prophet he moves the angel of the Lord the star of the Lord he moves his fiery burning star out and the people are just left with that experience that they had and now it's their turn to get to know the Lord it's their turn to learn to serve the Lord praise God it's their turn like Paul Paul it was Paul's turn on Damascus Lord he said what's your name he said my name is Jesus and then Paul said Lord what would you have me to do praise God that's what God was doing with Lydia and all those Saints they were moving on but it was their chance to say Lord what do you want me to do for you praise God that's a great question if you have the aspect question lately it's your time to ask that question Lord what do you want me to do let's go read now let's read Acts 9 real quick since we're there what would you have me to do Lord that's one of the most beautiful questions you can ask Church not low how much money am I gonna make or or Lord how many businesses will I start that's not the question to ask the question is Lord what do you want me to do that's right right chapter yes verse six and he trembling and astonished and said Lord what would that have me to do and the Lord said him arise and go in the city and it should be told thee what thou must do so Jesus didn't tell him everything at the beginning he had to keep serving Jesus and then Jesus would show him what he was called to do later hallelujah look at verse 15 but the Lord said unto him go thy way he's talking to Ananias for he is a chosen vessel unto me to bear my name before the Gentiles and kings and the children of Israel for I will show him how great things he must suffer for my name's sake being a Christian wasn't going to be a picnic right it was going to be a life of suffering yes there's you know you have the moments of the power is resurrection sometimes I wanted that by the Amen why God don't let me cast out more demons I don't know but there's not many demon-possessed people that come here which is good I don't want people to be demon-possessed in our church but see there's part of it were and I believe God showed me those things to show me the power of his resurrection but then God showed me you also have to partake of his sufferings it's not all power so no just supernatural all the time part of it is learning to die to self learning to take up your cross daily and follow the Lord Jesus like last time was that brother cam Church remember I was praying for that little boy I'd like to hear how he's doing now but his mom is the one that was heal to cancer she had the cancer on her neither and I know she had I trouble I was just praying for the boy and when I got done with the boy she said she opened her eyes and she was her eyesight was instantly healed she said she just had like he was looking through two lenses everything else was blurry she said but when she opened her eyes her eyes were perfectly well now why are those things happen I don't know but it's it's God showing us that we live in resurrection power I love that song praise God and now I live see it's a power I live in a man we live in that resurrection power but we must also learn to suffer for his name's sake see Paul had to go stand there before all those Romans right here to stand before all these men just to bear and they all killed him are they all want him to die they all blaspheme is God but he had to stand there as a witness for Jesus Christ to condemn all those sinners on that day part of his life was much suffering yeah there was great glory right he tossed off that serpent in the fire and they also this is a God he said no I serve God a man I'm not God I serve the Living God great times of great resurrection power but a lot of times it was suffering Church I wonder sometimes do we get discouraged sometimes and suffering yeah we do but God gives us hope that's what I see church even in the midst this coronavirus you know there's many discouraging moments there's moments of fear when the midst of it God gives us hope God gives us hope we know there's times and seasons for everything we should have hope that will come out of this if if they came out of the swine-flu but it was 11 years ago 12 years ago if they came out of that will come out of this we got to have hope that God is using it for our good everything works together for our good and not to sound carnal but I got that check from you know the trumpet that really helped out my family that I can see how that works out for good that was a lot of money it wasn't as much as Obama when Obama I remember when the market crash in 2008 we got a bigger check for for Obama we really needed that money too it's just one little simple thing that God is interested in every detail of our lives and all things will work together for our good when we love the Lord hallelujah and so the man of God moves on he says let me just have one more opportunity to speak with sister Lydia and her household I just want to encourage them and comfort them before I go and so the man of God comforts remember Paul comfort of the Thessalonians which is actually the next city he goes to in Acts chapter 18 Thessalonica when the church starts there remember what he say he said comfort one another with these words that the dead in Christ will rise first the rapture was comforting words to those people because they see many Christians die time was moving on Jesus hadn't come back he said but let me encourage you the dead in Christ rise first amen I wonder if Paul said the same thing to Lydia let me encourage you you're gonna suffer you're gonna go through difficult trials a member Church not only was Paul going to be persecuted but all the Christians living in Philippi afterward we're going to be persecuted whenever God whenever God moved it and and and let's say delivered somebody like that woman with the divination the sinners would pounce on them and beat them up and kinda like the Muslim countries today right they beat up Christians they can cast them into prison something similar to that so this was going to be a group of Christians that would go through much suffering and that's where Paul writes them the letter from his prison in Philippians chapter 1 so now let's transition over there to Philippians chapter 1 and we'll close here and I'm a little bit by God's grace Philippians chapter 1 this has been called the the book of joy did you know that I listen to different preachers preach on this book it's called the book of joy but it's a paradox how can a man riding from prison arrested knowing that he's gonna die soon how can he have joy it's a paradox it's the peace of God that comes when you know you've done his will praise God it's that like it's like we sing it's that blessed assurance Jesus is mine see Paul had that blessed assurance yeah assurance in his heart I know I've done what Jesus is brought me to do and so I could have joined my heart despite my situation despite my circumstances I'll choose joy there's a little song that goes like that I choose joy that's not it they don't say the name of Jesus in that song but they got some good ideas in there Paul had to choose am I gonna be discouraged in jail or am I gonna choose joy and Paul chose joy in jail Philippians chapter 1 remember 11 years after Paul started a church through a prayer meeting he starts a church through a prayer meeting somebody hears him pray and opens her heart it just gets a few little converts there and then God does a mighty miracle he or a cast out a demon and then he does a little miracle they're gonna they get a whole household baptized so it's Lydia maybe her house and then this jail keepers house they got two houses here and then the the Prophet goes on said you two families you hold it down let me comfort you be encouraged God's done a great work here I've got to go preach elsewhere you you hold down the fort praise God praise God a man aren't you encouraged Church God if God starts something he's gonna finish it praise God so let's be encouraged of what God does let's be let's be enthused to be part of what God has been doing praise God hallelujah oh I'm so thankful for the Lord amen thank you Jesus hallelujah in the midst of trial we should choose joy cuz you know church remember we just got off Easter the reason we're not alone is because Christ was alone so he became all alone so that we can say for the Jose I'm never alone with Amen Christ has never left our church alone but that's that's the Word of God he was alone he took all of our sin so that we didn't have to be alone praise God hey man now let's go a little bit more minutes here flipping chapter 1 what a beautiful letter written from prison because he talks about it later in this chapter my bonds he talks about my bonds he's writing from prison now verse 1 Paul and Timothy associ they must have known timotheus the servants of Jesus Christ to all the saints in Christ Jesus nuts who's born again right in Christ Jesus which are at Philippi with the bishops and deacons samaya lots happened 11 years they start off they just got to families 11 years later Paul realizes he hears back from first and different ones they've got bishops they've got deacons they got a real church going there praise the hook so god bless it raise up some of those young men to be bishops pastors now of course as you know a bishop is a pastor so there was more than one Church there because he said bishops right so there was a church maybe on this side of the city maybe right where that Jail was and there's a church over there by Lydia's house probably right maybe there's a church at the jail keepers house there was bishops there's more than one pastor and there was deacons men of faith they'll be able to handle the the natural needs of the church now thank God we don't have many natural needs as far as I know here so we haven't needed that much but you know when there's sick people or when there's people that are hungry deacons are the ones that go to take care of that many times so then the preachers can just focus on the word right that's what God set it up in the book of Acts when there's a big group of people right but thankfully God is giving me a church where hardly anybody gets sick I just thank the Lord for that - God has been merciful but he says I'm writing to the bishops the pastors and the Deacons grace be unto you and peace from God our Father and from the Lord Jesus Christ see invisible and visible you you we can never separate that right because Jesus is the image of the invisible person right so Paul he always knows there's only one person but there's a father there's invisible and there's visible praise God he never he never gets rid of that there's always invisible visible verse three I thank my god I look at this upon every remembrance of you there was time to the Amen he think back he'd be discouraged Aaron his bonds but he remember back my the god the god that's with me now is the same God that brought me out of that jail at church look at look at this Paul's in a prison and he's not discouraged that he's in prison because he knows God brought me out of the prison in other words if God wants me to come out of this trial he'll bring me out but if he doesn't I still serve God amen see well he could have had a pity party system you know he said well God you you brought me out of that prison why don't you bring me on this one but he was wiser than that praise God he wasn't a foolish virgin amen oh yeah he knew he was if God God's in control of my life amen the foot sets of the righteous are order the Lord praise God if God wants me out of the present he'll bring me out because he did it before he can do it again praise God amen that's why I'm not discouraged and people don't get healed right away when I pray for them I don't get discouraged because I know I didn't heal the ones that got healed in the first place it's not up to me it's up to God amen I just heard I listened to take inside with Jesus yesterday brother Rams talking to preachers I was mowing the grass I got this in the whole sermon I've been talking to preachers and he says brothers he said God may not heal one person through your prayers he said but when you to heaven God will still reward you he said just be faithful Abraham said I've always said if I pray for five hundred people and they died that night he said I'd go back preaching divine healing the next morning God Amen because I know I'm not the author of anyone's healing Jesus is the author and finisher of our faith praise God hallelujah here's a man riding from prison and he's not discouraged all she can say is thank God that he started this church in Phillip I thank God every time I remember what God's doing done in Akron praise God thank you Jesus praise the Lord think about that church that means any little church anything that God starts off a real man of God and look back and say praise the Lord I'm so thankful for what God's done now remember we'll go later in chapter four he chopped there's two and three he balls out all the false doctrine that that Christian Judaizers were preaching but then the end of the book there's two women that got them a big struggle that's messing up to one of the churches there and so paul has to correct those women they're arguing in there we couldn't getting one Accord now remember this like I said last week this is the same church that they knew that God shook the prison he physically shook the prison they knew the power of God but yet two women went to sit in the church and argue and fuss and Paul said can't you figure this out seen in your church no matter what supernatural things there are we're still gonna have to battle this deep this devil this test house that we got inside of us right I said they devil it's this this is in nature we're still gonna have to battle that like for example any church where you know the preacher knew brother Branham they go through troubles too they have they have awful hardships in the church and you would think my their pastor knew brother Branham why do we got to go through this because God allows these trials to perfect our faith the trial of your faith is more precious than gold praise God so the same churches that saw people walk out of prison and demons cast out now they're arguing they can't the church can't get one Accord and Paul's pleading with them please get in one Accord getting one mind try to all want the same thing for God's will to be done and for Jesus Christ to be glorified why should people argue in the church he tells them later at the end of the book so that now doesn't this book make more sense now doesn't it when you can see how a church started look what it started with the prayer meeting and and it started with supernatural miracles and then now you can appreciate how Paul Howard a prophet a man that saw the power of God that casts out demons what would he write to that little church so it's so encouraging for us it's encouraging to me remember Paul left this little message church just after a certain few days said now you're all gonna be alright let me comfort you Jesus is with you the one who took the prison he's with you today praise God he's still with you verse three I thank my god upon every remembrance of you hallelujah verse four always in every prayer of mine for all for you all making requests with joy my church picture that he's in jail and he thinks about all I remember that revival in acts 16 I remember going on that second missionary trip oh thank you lord I just think of those people I'm so joyful that there's a church in Philippi I praise God think about this think about how how significant you are think about how significant this church is in God's eyes I think a good example of that let's just try to be encouraged today with our small church just be encouraged because remember the church up in Sheffield they're their bigger Church now right but I've talked to their uh their former pastor the one who started they started out with YMCA meetings for years they rented out a YMCA and they and they were there was such a hard thing to do to meet and and the church was very small for many years and then as I started growing after the years one of the brothers when they got so big they didn't want to run out anymore one of the brothers cashed in his retirement policy I don't know how much it must have been like fifty thousand or a hundred thousand he cashed that in took the money so he could put a down payment on their church building and he wasn't even the pre key wasn't even the pastor now look at that now I don't care if we have a building or not but I'm just saying look at the devotion that believers should have when God does something great and starts to the church look how devoted we should be to the cause of Christ willing to cash in your retirement and give it for Jesus's Church my goodness that's why Paul says these people the world's not worthy of them praise God of whom the world is not worthy to be around these type of people they love God they love God's people so much they give up everything for God's church of whom the world is not worthy Paul said in Hebrews 12 11 sorry Hebrews 11 so Paul sat there and he said I'm in prison yet I've gotten joy whenever I think of that church those churches that started alls I have his joy in my heart every time I remember the churches verse 5 he said for your fellowship in the gospel from the first day until now I think about that church can you remember the first day you got into fellowship as a Christian Paul could Paul remembers the day Lydia got saved oh thank god amen he said I remember that day we had prayer meeting and God opened Lydia's heart that's how much the church meant to Paul I remember the day when Amen got saved sorry I knew yeah I remember baptizing lydia malachi years ago praise God he said I remember the very dead I remember baptize and sister who by God's grace that's a beautiful day after that was a beautiful day sunshiny a hot that was a glorious day I think we baptized five or six that day Paul said I remember the very day and every time I think of that time my heart just feels with joy because now you're serving Jesus Christ you're not with the demon-possessed sorcerers where Satan's to steal and lie and destroy your life he said I just give God joy you are a Christian because you're in Christ Jesus hallelujah he said I give thanks every prayer mine I thank the Lord for your fellowship from the first day until now I'm so glad I get to shake all your hands you sisters and then you brothers I'm so glad I get to hug you I really do the core to that praise God cuz we don't you don't have that fellowship anywhere else there's no one else we can fellowship with like this then right here where we have a safe place it's like a safe haven praise God it's like a hospital you know it's the place we can come and we can feel refreshed we can feel healed we can feel loved here praise God though the world rejects us and makes fun of us and gives us a hard time I know one place where I'm gonna be loved that's in God's house amen that's what Paul saying every time I think about this fellowship I just saw thank the Lord Oh God has done great things in my in our life in our church praise God verse 6 this is a beautiful one of the most beautiful verses 4x God in the scripture I believe now of course he everyone's got their own little you know their own preferences as far as their favorite verses but this is one of the most beautiful verses the pians 1:6 let me pull up a little another scripture here and I think well we'll close with this let me close of this scripture right here being confident of this very thing that he which hath begun a good work in you will perform it until the day of Christ praise God he was only with them for a few certain days he didn't get all that he didn't get three years he got three years with Ephesus he wasn't with the Philippians that long he only had a few special very special days supernatural americo's ball so prayer meetings teaching the word baptizing those saints in the name of the Lord Jesus and he says you he said you need to become he said I'm confident of this very this very thing now what's the word confident mean it means assured believe persuaded trusting so Paul said I'm trusting of this very thing that God which began a good work in you will perform it unto the day of Christ Jesus the church go back to that go back to that day where God began to work can you remember that day now maybe it's like you maybe that may be yours like mine God worked on me for many years I just kept refused to refuse infusing but I remember the day I finally gave over praise God Paul saying that God he's I'm confident that God when he started that work in you he will perform it until the day of Jesus Christ that's either the rapture or the white throne judgment if you're wise or foolish version right God has started a work now Church you and I know we didn't go looking for God the Bible said God came looking for us when God started it he came looking for you he came knocking at your heart and said will you open up will you fellowship with me I love you I want to fellowship with you I want to take all your burdens away praise God amen he said I'm confident I'm trusting I'm assured that God is gonna finish and complete what he started in you it was a good work when God got ahold your life it was a good thing can you think of anything better in your life that started there's nothing better that ever start in your life than the day you surrendered to Jesus Christ and if God started that if God showed you his love if God showed you his mercy and you let him do that and let him bring you the gift of faith through love and all these things we know the scripture says then if God started it if he was in control on that day he'll be in control every day all the way to the last day praise God amen we know the last days come and quickly praise God amen if he was there on the first day he's there every day because God the Bible said he will perform it what's the word performing it means executed accomplish it finish it Oh glory if God started your salvation God will execute the rest of it amen in other words if God part of those red seas to bring you out of Egypt then God will take you in the promised land as well praise God now the nominations look at this scripture and they make it a license to sin but you've got to balance this this of course means God will finish it if you let him because God didn't force that generation that said Noah Kadish God didn't force them in fact God kept them out of the promised land right so this has to be balanced with all the other scriptures if God brought me out of Egypt he'll bring me in as long as I surrender to Him praise God as long as I love him and obey Him so see Church all these scriptures must because any denomination they will rejoice in the scripture just like you and I and thank God they do but they've got to let God continue the work they got to keep obeying the Word of God then God will complete it that's right now let me close with this if you would verse that I took a screenshot of these scriptures uh go to the go to the book of Deuteronomy I like to go there real quick here Deuteronomy if you would here go to chapter 6 Deuteronomy 6 now this is a beautiful book my I forgot how glorious this is so deuteronomy's right at the end of Israel's journey right before they go up possessed Canaan and Deuteronomy pne's a second law so it's like a second time Moses repeats everything to Israel before the new generation goes takes the promised land island idiot praise God he repeats everything all the way from the beginning goes all the way back to Egypt axis and brings them all the way through and prepares them and prepares Joshua to take the promised land that's what Deuteronomy is all about obvi that's what God's doing today right God is bringing back all the original teachings from the Apostle Paul from the Apostle John all the apostolic teaching God's referencing that back to us before we take a rapture praise God amen he promised to do it praise God I'll restore everything that the locusts and Palmer McCain Corrigan kind of pillar I mean I'll restore saith the Lord praise God hey man it's Scripture praise God God has to do it he has to restore his word back to his people hey man Deuteronomy 6 verse 22 now verse 23 yeah I'm sorry verse 22 and the Lord shooting signs and wonders great and sore upon Egypt upon Pharaoh and upon all his household before our eyes and he brought us out from thence that he might bring us in oh I love it hey that's it brother and said brother and said Redemption is not just bringing you out he's got to take you into something praise God amen in other words the Holy Ghost he has to bring us out of the world to take us into the Holy Ghost hallelujah and all this place between out and in is the night sanctification and that's where most churches fall short of God's glory but see redemption is taking you out and into Christ oh thank the Lord I love it to give us the land which he sware unto our fathers verse 24 and the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes now look at this here it is why did God command all these things don't cut your hair don't cuss and drink and get drunk you men and don't commit adultery why Lord commanded us to do all these statutes to fear the Lord our God for our good always that he might preserve us alive as it is at this day why does God give us these commands it's always for your good Church God always has your best interests in mind always God always wants the best for you and when you're not sure which way to go and which one's going to be good it's the one that obeys the word praise God the one that obeys God word is the way the good way it's the way that God wants you to go it will always benefit you coronavirus has benefited me praise God all these different harsh trials they will benefit us if we can see that God is trying to do something that God wants us to say here's word and obey his word in the midst of the trial like I was telling brother bang on the text I said brother God hit me he has allowed your had to go through this for our good and no doubt for his good too that's why I was praying I said God let him be able to talk again and speak again so if I get a chance I can talk to him about Jesus or maybe one of his family members see Church all these things we don't know why they happened but it's for good like how about mike.mccluskey the guy that got shot he's in a wheelchair now he knows he had dreams before he got shot that he was going to be in a wheelchair he had a dream of it and he said God had to do that to Humble me because I was running from God so getting shot in the back and mean a wheelchair and paralyzed all worked out for his good so that he could go on TV and millions of people could see him holding up his King James Bible and forgiving the police officer that shot him all things work to your good always always God - the reason I gave these Commandments because everything is going to work out to your good doesn't that three with Romans eight where it says all things work together for good see God says the same thing in the old as in the new I'm gonna give you all these Commandments and it will always benefit you keep my commands verse 25 and it shall be our righteousness if we observe to do all these Commandments look if every commandment to F before the Lord our God as CF commanded us a church God did it all this because of his love go to chapter 7 verse 17 I'm trying to close my 7 7 to 8 why does God allow things it's all based upon his love for your good the Lord did not set his love upon you nor choose you because you were more in number than any other people for you were the fewest of people the good verse 8 acacia but because the Lord loved you and because he would keep the oath which he'd sworn to your father's God loved Israel even though they were stiff necked people that complained all the time God still loved them praise God you still love them and said if you just keep my commands it will always be for your good how much more us today I don't know this I gotta look this one up last one let's stand to our feet here and I'll closer it's still Deuteronomy there it is yeah Deuteronomy 10:13 yeah sorry this one I didn't get a chance to look it up sounds Reena this morning can you pull it up sweetheart Deuteronomy 10:13 now go up to verse 12 though to start there and now Israel what does the Lord require of you what does God want from me today what does God require of you but to fear the Lord your God to walk in all his ways to love him to serve the LORD thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul member Wednesday sermon how much does God want of your effort all of it you know why because he's worthy of all of it right he's worthy he he is worth all of your sacrifices because he loved you so much nobody could love me like Jesus praise God he says what does what does God require but just to walk in his ways to love him and to serve the Lord with all your heart with all your soul verse 13 to keep the commandments of the Lord and his statutes which I command thee this day for whose good your God does not give you a commandment that will not work out for your good why does God keep asking me to do this why does the word say this it's for your good it's to change our selfish attitudes and the church said I'm selfish - amen why don't why do you and I why do we wrestle sometimes it's for our good because it's bad it's it's teaching us to crucify that selfish nature to crucify the lust of the flesh the lust of the eyes and the pride of life so I want to close with that do you love the Lord today it's always for your good musicians if you'll come here but hey man let me know if you got a song children let me know if you got a song everything works together for your good if God began when God began the work of salvation he'll finish it that's just about heads for a moment let's remember when God began it I was talking about that this morning I remember at that athletes and action conference I saw that big six foot six red head football player from Iowa State raised his hand I said Jesse shame on you he's six foot tall six six and he can't and he can raise his hands and you can't I said Lord you've been so good to me you heal my momma cancer forgive me and I raised my hands right there and gave my heart to Christ praise God God began a good work praise God and he's faithful he will perform it until the day of Christ Jesus let's go back to that day Heavenly Father nor with our heads
