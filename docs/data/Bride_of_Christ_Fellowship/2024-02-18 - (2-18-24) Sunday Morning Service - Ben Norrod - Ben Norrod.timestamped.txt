[13:24] out there Amen Let Jesus know give you
[13:27] my best amen amen so we we love the Lord
[13:30] now if you have your Bible this morning
[13:33] we're going to turn to just a just a
[13:35] maybe one or two places amen just for
[13:38] the reading this morning of the
[13:40] scripture and um how many loves your
[13:43] Bible say amen I just love the word of
[13:46] God there's strength in it friends
[13:47] whether or not we realize it there is
[13:49] strength in the word of the Lord and um
[13:53] I want to talk if the God if if if the
[13:55] Lord will help us this morning if God
[13:57] will help us this morning I want to try
[13:59] to speak to you upon the benefits of
[14:03] like worship and Thanksgiving and praise
[14:05] and these kind of things and um you know
[14:09] and I'm going to say this while you're
[14:10] getting ready to turn with me I'm just
[14:11] I'm just lining up a few things here
[14:13] because I got a lot of hay on this Fork
[14:15] today let me tell you that right now but
[14:18] um we we you know we we understand that
[14:22] churches today I'm talking about message
[14:24] churches have really lost I think in so
[14:27] many ways the real meaning and the
[14:29] benefits of what it means to be
[14:31] worshippers and uh in my personal and
[14:35] humble opinion I think what we need more
[14:38] now than we've ever needed is we need
[14:40] the worship of the Lord in our
[14:42] midst and friends I'm just going to be
[14:44] real real honest with you and just say
[14:46] it like this there's a lot of people
[14:48] that just simply don't understand what
[14:50] it means to be worshippers they just
[14:52] don't understand it nor do I think they
[14:55] have a real good understanding of what
[14:56] it means for us as Christians to be
[14:58] worshippers I think a lot of folks feel
[15:01] like worship is just what you do here
[15:03] like this and Hallelujah and praise the
[15:05] Lord and you know or some kind of a
[15:06] thing but we'll find out today worship
[15:09] is a whole lot more than that there's a
[15:10] deeper meaning to all of it and uh once
[15:13] again we're so happy to be in the house
[15:15] of the Lord now uh Philippians chapter 4
[15:18] let's start there in verse four four
[15:20] five and six we're going to read those
[15:22] three verses together and then we'll um
[15:25] we'll we'll we'll hop over to Colossians
[15:27] chapter 2 vers seven for just a moment
[15:30] and um what a privilege it is to be back
[15:33] in God's house we're so grateful to the
[15:37] Lord for the things that you know that
[15:39] God does for us and and appreciate my
[15:42] girls and somebody asked me did my
[15:44] oldest one sing I said she does but
[15:46] right now she just grins amen and so
[15:48] we're we're working on her amen and uh
[15:52] and uh but she's a good singer I'd like
[15:53] to see her get up and do some more
[15:55] singing she's a real good singer got a
[15:57] pretty voice you pray that the Lord just
[15:59] give her that you know and she can get
[16:01] up here and do it with us you know and
[16:03] and uh we we uh we like to see her in
[16:05] the service of the Lord and uh I thought
[16:07] anise done a great job didn't you think
[16:09] she did a good job she's a good singer
[16:12] she's a good little singer and I this
[16:14] one I here sings herself to sleep still
[16:16] you know here she is almost 15 years old
[16:18] and she'll I hear in the room singing
[16:20] you know and going to sleep and so amen
[16:22] it comes from an honest side of the
[16:24] things you I mean we had all kinds of
[16:26] singers in our family every which way
[16:28] and uh even on her mama's side you know
[16:30] the I always said it jokingly I said
[16:33] Grandma was a singer and that's on both
[16:35] our sides and then you know of course um
[16:38] mom's a singer on both sides of it and I
[16:40] said then they had a sewing machine at
[16:42] home and it was a singer amen it's about
[16:45] right ain't it all right Philippians
[16:47] chapter 4:4 rejoice in the lord always
[16:51] and again I say rejoice notice he said
[16:54] it twice and again I say rejoice let
[16:57] your moderation be known unto all men
[17:00] the Lord is at hand be careful for
[17:03] nothing but in everything by prayer and
[17:09] supplication with Thanksgiving let your
[17:12] requests be made known unto God did he
[17:15] say
[17:17] everything look at your Bible again did
[17:19] he say everything in everything bad good
[17:23] positive negative up down left right in
[17:26] out everything by prayer
[17:29] supplication with
[17:31] Thanksgiving when we learn this lesson
[17:33] right here even when things are going
[17:35] bad we'll learn how to Worship the Lord
[17:36] in the right way because go worship
[17:39] doesn't come just when you feel good to
[17:40] worship right worship is something that
[17:43] comes even deeper than that all right
[17:45] now let's hop over to Colossians chapter
[17:46] 2 verse 7 that's I guess an evangelist
[17:49] term hop over
[17:51] amen pastors would have you walk over
[17:54] sturdily stain sanely you know steadily
[17:57] evangels are going to have you hop
[17:59] amen hallelujah all right and then
[18:03] looking at Colossians 2:7 now here
[18:05] here's where I'm talking about worship
[18:07] is not just the emotional output of it
[18:10] Paul says it like this rooted and build
[18:12] up in him and established in the
[18:15] faith as you have been taught notice
[18:19] that as you have been taught so these
[18:21] things have to be modeled somebody has
[18:24] to model right worship before you now
[18:26] there's an element of your Holy Ghost
[18:27] and your birth that's going to put it in
[18:29] you but it also has to be modeled in you
[18:31] especially when you start coming toward
[18:33] maturity because worship also includes
[18:35] the gifts and include Supernatural
[18:37] things dreams visitations all those
[18:39] things and those are the categories of
[18:42] Supernatural that have to be instructed
[18:44] you need instruction on how to handle if
[18:46] the Lord was to appear to you by the way
[18:48] of an angel you have to be instructed by
[18:51] Godly men understanding uh the the
[18:53] revelation of the day and things like
[18:55] that not just any old Fly by Night on
[18:57] YouTube but you have to understand or
[18:59] some other social media or website for
[19:01] that matter but you got to understand by
[19:03] Godly men that are inspired by the truth
[19:06] of the hour and understand the emphasis
[19:07] of the hour how to place those things
[19:09] and we don't want to be guilty in any
[19:11] way whatsoever of just accepting all
[19:15] kinds of worship and Supernatural things
[19:18] without being established established
[19:21] and being taught correctly by Faithful
[19:23] Men and then watch as you have been
[19:25] taught which what he says abounding
[19:28] therein abounding see that
[19:30] word now how why is it so many people
[19:33] come to church less barely hardly able
[19:35] to get to hands up if we've been taught
[19:38] correctly we should be abounding therein
[19:40] with
[19:42] Thanksgiving amen yeah three amens two
[19:45] ey blinks
[19:46] and all right I guess we going to start
[19:50] sticky huh well that's okay that's all
[19:52] right I uh I I know I already you're
[19:55] probably under a little bit of
[19:56] conviction so here's what you do you
[19:58] just say Lord forgive me help me
[20:00] straighten me out get me right don't sit
[20:03] there and beat yourself up all service
[20:04] now all right let's pray together over
[20:06] the word father thank you for this
[20:08] opportunity to open thy Bible to be able
[20:10] to Bow our heads over the truth of Thy
[20:12] word We Want to Thank You Lord For All
[20:14] Things We Appreciate You Lord Jesus for
[20:17] what you've done in the service thus far
[20:19] speak to us now in the remainder God may
[20:21] you anoint me Lord as your son your
[20:23] servant Lord to be able to get myself
[20:25] out of the way anoint them that they
[20:27] might be able to receive that which you
[20:29] want to speak to us and strengthen us
[20:31] Lord for the purpose of God today
[20:33] whatever you'd want us to do we want to
[20:35] follow that pathway whatever you want to
[20:37] lead me to say Lord I'm here to respond
[20:40] to whatever you want Lord and that's
[20:42] what's in our hearts today for your
[20:43] people whatever you would want to say
[20:46] now Lord we pray that the Holy Ghost
[20:48] will not only anoint us but set us free
[20:50] from every wrong Idol thing from this
[20:54] world forgive us and wash us of any
[20:56] little thing Lord that might set us back
[20:58] or beset us today just keep us clean
[21:01] Lord our hands and our feet and our
[21:03] minds clean that we can serve you to the
[21:05] best of our abilities and for the
[21:06] abundance of it we give you Thanksgiving
[21:09] in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints
[21:11] said amen amen well that was a pretty
[21:13] good amen for how we started there all
[21:16] right you may be seated may the Lord
[21:18] bless
[21:19] you I um I I I like to see the worship
[21:23] of the Lord now now this may sound like
[21:26] one of these sermons where my goal is to
[21:28] get yall hyped up and running and
[21:30] shouting before the end of the service
[21:32] now listen number one as message people
[21:35] we have moved Beyond modern day
[21:37] Pentecost I believe in true worship of
[21:40] God I believe in being emotional it's
[21:42] all right I believe in being loud but
[21:44] also believe in being quiet and I also
[21:46] believe in being medium and I believe in
[21:48] being low gear high gear third gear
[21:50] second gear and all the other years AG
[21:52] go with it the only difference between
[21:55] what I would probably say Amen to your
[21:57] opinion on something like that is if
[21:59] you'd say well I'm just a quiet person
[22:02] and God in heaven knowing the only
[22:04] reason you're saying that is because
[22:05] you're make an excuse not to be a loud
[22:07] one that's probably the only place we'd
[22:10] ever butt heads on that Doctrine right
[22:11] there so if you're not giving your best
[22:13] to the Lord all right then we got a
[22:14] problem now I'm going to have to preach
[22:16] on you and get on you a little bit by
[22:18] the word or brother Jesse or some
[22:19] Minister you know but if it's just that
[22:22] maybe that you are in the worship of the
[22:25] Lord and deeply in sincerity in the
[22:27] service of God and you're following the
[22:29] Lord and I mean when we come to church
[22:31] we want to be as reverent to that
[22:33] anointing as we know how that's the
[22:35] reason why brother Bram told us when we
[22:37] come in the house of God like this we
[22:38] don't pass notes between one another and
[22:40] talk to one another and you know and uh
[22:43] sit around chewing gum and looking at
[22:45] the ceiling and thumbing through Psalm
[22:47] books we used to have Psalm books where
[22:48] they used to do that in my day I'm Tell
[22:50] it on myself a little bit and uh you
[22:52] know running in and out through the back
[22:54] and things like that and just barely
[22:56] paying attention but that's the reason
[22:58] why brother BM said especially young
[23:00] people sitting here my own girls
[23:01] included brother B said if you want to
[23:03] be the kind of person in the service of
[23:06] God in the future when you get older he
[23:08] said behave it like this right here now
[23:10] he said and train yourself in other
[23:12] words to know how to act and behave and
[23:14] how to be sensitive to the spirit that's
[23:17] the reason why we don't come to church
[23:18] and sleep and we don't come to church
[23:20] and just kind of zone out do your best
[23:22] to pay attention and focus on the things
[23:25] that need to be said why because we
[23:27] don't come here for just no generalized
[23:30] purpose at all we're here to learn how
[23:33] as Paul said here to be established to
[23:36] be placed and positioned and for the
[23:38] word of the Lord to show us how God's
[23:41] purpose can work in our lives ever what
[23:44] that purpose may be might be to a
[23:46] housewife might be to a farmer factory
[23:48] worker might be a preacher who knows
[23:50] amen or a musician or whatever God may
[23:53] call that's why we want to be so
[23:56] reverent to those things because every
[23:58] time we come to church if we're looking
[24:00] for it and our cup is empty and open we
[24:02] know the Holy Spirit somehow will fill
[24:05] it up with Revelation and understanding
[24:07] especially if you're hungry they that
[24:09] are hungry and thirst amen he said they
[24:11] shall be filled ain't that right now I
[24:13] believe with all of my heart that if we
[24:15] are the kind of people that we need to
[24:16] be now this is my feeling I feel like as
[24:19] a message kid raised on the Pew just
[24:21] like y'all are amen I feel like that I
[24:24] had to be broken free and set free from
[24:27] a lot of message tradition that followed
[24:29] the traditions of elders and people that
[24:32] had established churches now I was never
[24:34] a part of Pentecost per se I was never a
[24:36] part of apostolic now Mom and Dad them
[24:39] came from the apostolic move when the
[24:41] message came back in the 60s and it hit
[24:43] Southern Ohio down there amen and uh a
[24:46] lot of the movements of course around
[24:48] this state that was birthed from those
[24:50] tent revivals down there that's what put
[24:53] a lot of these churches on the map
[24:54] outside of brother Brown and them over
[24:56] in Lima and brother da and them that
[24:58] followed brother brandom most of them
[25:00] churches were kind of burgeoned and uh
[25:02] grown from uh the meetings that we had
[25:04] in Southern Ohio down there in Dayton
[25:06] amen when a Fell's gone now by the name
[25:08] of Billy Andrews came set up a tent in
[25:10] the middle of Dayton farmers market and
[25:12] started preaching amen serpent seed and
[25:15] different things like that the coming of
[25:17] Elijah amen many folks left out of those
[25:20] movements and Then followed over into
[25:22] the message churches but here's the
[25:24] problem just like in our church our area
[25:27] and our state
[25:28] amen like all these other places around
[25:30] the message they may have came out of
[25:32] apostolic and they may came out of
[25:33] Baptist and out of Pentecost and these
[25:35] other things like that but Pentecost
[25:37] Methodist Baptist and all the rest
[25:39] didn't come out of them and they just
[25:41] carried that brother Jesse right on into
[25:43] the message of the hour and listen
[25:45] friends even us messaged kids that have
[25:48] been tailored to believe in certain
[25:50] manners listen and I say this
[25:52] respectfully of course because I'm up
[25:53] here preaching just like brother Jesse
[25:55] would but whether it be your father or
[25:57] your pastor or it be brother Ben or
[25:59] somebody like that no matter if you've
[26:01] heard it all your life you are Duty
[26:04] Bound by God be it my young girl sitting
[26:06] here like this or your family or your
[26:09] your brother your sister we are Duty
[26:11] bound to go back in this old Bible right
[26:13] here and search out our own salvation
[26:17] with fear and trembling amen do you
[26:18] believe that we got to know for
[26:20] ourselves because this is not a mama had
[26:22] it Daddy had it therefore I got it this
[26:25] is I've got to get it by the same faith
[26:27] that Mom and Dad had and if they believe
[26:29] the Lord like that I got to believe the
[26:31] Lord just the same way and to be
[26:33] established in the word we have to be
[26:36] exposed to right Godly Ministries
[26:39] friends I can't understand and this is
[26:41] something that I just cannot get my mind
[26:42] wrapped around how in the world people
[26:45] expect to be ready for the Rapture and
[26:47] the and the resurrection and the coming
[26:49] of the Lord Jesus where these bodies are
[26:51] going to be changed and when we pulled
[26:52] out of here amen they never go to church
[26:55] they hate preachers they're not
[26:56] interested in reading the Bible they got
[26:58] their mind on football and everything
[27:00] else in the world rather than on what
[27:02] they can do to become the kind of people
[27:05] before the Lord that they need to become
[27:07] amen and let me tell you if you're not
[27:09] concerned you'll never be
[27:12] convinced amen if you don't have a heart
[27:15] to want to know God will never reveal it
[27:17] to you cuz if you don't care God can't
[27:19] care you tie up the hands of deity
[27:22] himself he cannot show you concern and
[27:25] care and Revelation if in your heart you
[27:27] could care less what's going on today or
[27:29] tomorrow or whenever amen but if we will
[27:32] open our heart and say Lord Jesus
[27:35] establish me Lord set my feet Where I
[27:38] Belong help me know what is right is it
[27:41] going to be a battle brother Ben you
[27:43] better believe it's going to be a battle
[27:45] amen but if the Lord before us God
[27:47] before us tell me who can be against us
[27:51] amen with the Lord on our side we are
[27:54] sure to
[27:55] overcome oh I love that can can you say
[27:58] Amen to that I love that amen abiding in
[28:01] the faith notice again Paul said it
[28:04] rooted and built up in him in other
[28:06] words established not just upon a rocky
[28:10] Foundation or a rocky understanding or
[28:12] some little uh fellas stand in the pull
[28:15] pit and take the message like it's a
[28:16] ditch amen you know some people treat
[28:18] brother Brandon and the message like
[28:20] it's power
[28:21] windows amen you go to buy a car they
[28:23] ask you what options do you want power
[28:25] windows you want Bluetooth what do you
[28:27] want want and they treat brother bam in
[28:28] a message of the hour like his power
[28:30] wind is like it's optional amen but if
[28:32] you want to be bride if you want to go
[28:34] out of here in a Rapture brother bam was
[28:36] not sent to this generation amen for you
[28:39] to lean to the Baptist the Methodist the
[28:41] Presbyterian and still make the Rapture
[28:43] he was sent to procall and prepare a
[28:45] bride to get out of here to seow the
[28:47] root so the bride could have a word
[28:50] foundation amen not only to se her back
[28:53] into the Bible but to open up the
[28:55] Mysteries and the secrets of that Bible
[28:57] so we would know the things that need to
[28:59] be known now just like the critics many
[29:01] times will say now well brother brandham
[29:04] he just kind of preached along with Lin
[29:06] and some of those things and friends
[29:08] what they don't understand and can
[29:10] understand God won't permit it unless he
[29:11] opens their eyes amen all they reading
[29:14] is what was on the outside of the book
[29:16] remember when the scroll was sealed up
[29:18] brother Jesse Amen on the backside it
[29:20] said white horse rider and all those
[29:22] other things was wrote on the back side
[29:24] of the book amen anybody could read Lin
[29:26] or these other guys and understand and
[29:28] parallel what's on the back side of the
[29:30] book but the rear Revelation is
[29:32] contained not on the backside but on the
[29:34] inside of the book amen that's what
[29:36] tells me my purpose and where I belong
[29:39] in all of this and what my role is
[29:41] before the Holy Ghost amen those are the
[29:44] things that people will fail to
[29:46] understand they hear Brother bam preach
[29:47] and they think well he's just copying
[29:49] brother Bosworth or he just said what
[29:50] somebody else said but that's not the
[29:52] real revelation of it that's only the
[29:54] outside of the book amen when I preach
[29:57] preach to you I'm copycatting what Paul
[29:59] said amen I'm going to copycat what
[30:01] Peter said I don't come with my own
[30:03] message amen I'm going to preaching in a
[30:05] generalized way but the root and the
[30:08] instruction is when it's a revelation
[30:11] how do I fit into all of this
[30:13] preaching amen because there's been a
[30:15] lot of preaching done for 2,000 years
[30:18] amen this same Bible has been in the
[30:20] hands and the possession of humankind
[30:22] for the last 2,000 years amen but if you
[30:24] don't see your part in this Revelation
[30:26] this right here don't mean nothing to
[30:28] you Calvary is no benefit the message is
[30:31] no benefit a prophet is no benefit a
[30:33] pastor is worthless to you unless you
[30:35] can see the Revelation amen but when God
[30:38] opens up your eyes then you can see
[30:40] what's on the inside of it amen he
[30:43] talked about breeding between the lines
[30:45] that's what I'm talking about this
[30:46] morning being able to go right in
[30:48] between the lines amen right into the
[30:50] scripture to be able to see my part and
[30:52] my place in the kingdom of God rooted up
[30:56] build up in him established in the faith
[31:00] not just a faith not just any old Faith
[31:02] but the faith the faith that was once
[31:04] delivered to the apostles remember
[31:06] that's Elijah's Mission Amen to restore
[31:09] their hearts back to the original faith
[31:11] of the fathers and he said that cannot
[31:13] literally turn your heart amen he took
[31:16] those seven unknown Thunders to sound
[31:19] out Amen to literally turn our hearts
[31:22] back to the true Apostolic Faith amen
[31:25] and what was the seven Thunders amen it
[31:27] was nothing more than the voices of God
[31:29] coming to brother brandham and revealing
[31:32] to him all of those secret things that
[31:34] had been hid down through those ages
[31:36] Amen in other words Martin Luther said
[31:38] the just shall live by faith he only had
[31:41] a portion of it amen real justification
[31:44] isn't just being forgiven of your sins
[31:46] isn't just believing in Christ but real
[31:49] justification is to have your slate
[31:51] white as though there never was a slate
[31:54] in the
[31:55] beginning that's that's what that word
[31:58] opened up to us brother it's more than
[32:00] just a Greek word or something used out
[32:03] of the Bible but it is the complete
[32:06] revelation of Jesus Christ to
[32:09] you amen and when you can see it in that
[32:12] capacity you can understand who you are
[32:16] that's what's contained on the inside of
[32:18] the Scrolls Hallelujah that on the
[32:20] outside any dummy could put that
[32:22] together to some extent amen many of
[32:25] these things smart guys could prob about
[32:27] it and some of the most ignorant people
[32:29] in the world could understand serpent
[32:31] seed you don't need a degree to be able
[32:34] to understand that anybody with common
[32:37] understanding can read Matthew 28:19 and
[32:39] see it says name and not
[32:41] titles don't even take a revelation for
[32:43] some of these things that brother is
[32:45] just the outside of the book amen but
[32:48] the inside the root the thing you don't
[32:51] see that's the revelation of who it
[32:54] is and that's what brother Brenham came
[32:56] to to bring to us an understanding that
[32:59] would root us Amen in the spoken word
[33:02] rual c said that Billy Graham and or
[33:04] Roberts swed
[33:06] seeds you know what happens after seeds
[33:08] are swn they sprout
[33:10] Roots he said but the word has also been
[33:13] sown the eom unical has been sown that
[33:17] or Roberts group out there that
[33:18] charismatic group or somebody in Texas
[33:21] has got back trouble there all kinds of
[33:23] people in Texas got back
[33:25] trouble amen that that that real
[33:27] scholarly Man Billy Graham group where
[33:30] they just every word and salvation and
[33:32] Altra calls and that kind of thing all
[33:34] of that has been sown and it's brought
[33:36] forth fruits but he said the word has
[33:39] also been
[33:40] sown amen the Revelation has also been
[33:43] sown and that Revelation brings us to
[33:46] the roots of who we
[33:48] are CU remember Malachi 4 restoring our
[33:52] hearts back was part of Joel 2 I'm
[33:55] preparing a message right now I'm not
[33:57] through it just yet but I've been
[33:59] looking at some things about God's
[34:01] Heritage you know go back to 1962 we
[34:05] restoration of the brid tree brother man
[34:07] pulls it in through Joel 2 how that all
[34:09] that the pommer worm the cankerworm the
[34:11] Locust and the caterpillar had ate off
[34:13] he said it ate it all the way down to
[34:15] the ground amen and he said but yet it
[34:18] was God's Heritage God's inheritance was
[34:21] laying in the ground you know them four
[34:24] bugs it's just one big bug and all these
[34:26] different stages this one devil all the
[34:28] way through it amen and that one devil
[34:31] ate them all the way down to the ground
[34:32] took their Fellowship took their power
[34:35] took their anointing took everything but
[34:36] there's one thing he couldn't touch the
[34:41] root hallelujah amen it reminds me it
[34:44] puts me in mind of Samson amen when
[34:46] Delila wooed him into her lap amen and
[34:49] she tied him up amen and he picked the
[34:51] gates up on his shoulders and on and on
[34:54] and on until he revealed his secret to
[34:56] her you see he revealed The Secret of
[34:59] what the power was and the power was if
[35:02] he cut his hair he would become as a
[35:04] normal man but you see God predestines
[35:08] in a way that no matter what you reveal
[35:10] or what you let out accidentally or on
[35:13] purpose or what mistake you might make
[35:16] yes she could touch his hair the
[35:18] Philistines could take his hair they
[35:20] could put his eyes out but they couldn't
[35:22] touch the root underneath that
[35:25] skin amen and how hallelujah amen cuz
[35:28] after a while grinding at the Mill amen
[35:30] out there blind as a bat amen going
[35:33] round and round and round the prophet of
[35:35] God said he reached up and felt that
[35:37] hair growing back
[35:39] out brother that tells me no matter what
[35:42] kind of thing you fall into amen Satan
[35:45] May trap you into all kinds of messes
[35:47] and nonsense amen I like what a brother
[35:49] said last week amen down in South Ohio I
[35:51] was preaching down there and when I
[35:53] finished he made a statement that I just
[35:55] absolutely love and he he said remember
[35:57] Saints your mistakes are not Eternal
[36:01] hallelujah amen no matter what the devil
[36:04] might trap you into he can touch
[36:07] everything but he can't touch the
[36:11] root hallelujah hallelujah he can take
[36:14] your pride and take all of these things
[36:17] and lower you right down on your face
[36:20] until you ain't proud of nothing in your
[36:22] life but it can't touch that
[36:24] root that true seed that's been sown in
[36:27] there amen was swn by
[36:30] God I didn't put it in there I didn't
[36:33] ask for it it wasn't my choice amen all
[36:37] I do is I stay faithful to stay out of
[36:39] the lap of
[36:40] dilas Amen I try to stay faithful and do
[36:42] the god job that God called me to do but
[36:44] if they was to get my hair my glory if
[36:47] they was to take my prayer life that
[36:49] Root's still
[36:51] there Hallelujah established in the
[36:54] faith now moving on a little bit he said
[36:56] as you have been
[36:58] taught you see Paul was a man that
[37:01] believed in the five-fold
[37:03] ministry not only did he believe in
[37:05] pastors Bishops overseers and things but
[37:08] he also
[37:09] believed that those that were over the
[37:12] flock of God will also have assistance
[37:15] in that Ministry that local Ministry by
[37:18] Apostles evangelists teachers and
[37:20] Prophets now I know because a lot of
[37:23] people have this new testament idea
[37:24] about what a prophet is they don't think
[37:27] there's any prophets Among Us in the
[37:28] last day they're around they're
[37:31] preachers they stay with the message and
[37:33] with the Bible they don't necessarily
[37:35] have to be born off the Brandon
[37:37] branch and they don't have to be born
[37:39] off the Smith Branch or the NORAD Branch
[37:42] God calls as severly as he will God's
[37:44] got men that are prophets of the Lord
[37:46] that are Visionaries that are judgment
[37:48] speakers that can come to a church and
[37:51] tell them watch out for this certain
[37:52] thing that's coming down the road these
[37:54] prophets they understand they see the
[37:56] cup full before it gets there I don't
[37:58] know about you but I've sat under the
[38:00] ministry of men that may not call
[38:02] themselves prophets but their Ministry
[38:03] certainly is foretelling they let us
[38:05] know about things coming down the road
[38:07] they tell us about the troubles around
[38:09] us and what the bride should prepare for
[38:12] amen and how we should prepare ourself
[38:14] amen and what we should look for and I
[38:16] believe these Ministries not only
[38:18] establish the faith of the saints of God
[38:22] but give us the understanding of what
[38:25] we're going through whether it's bad
[38:27] good or anything else so that no matter
[38:30] what's going on we can be like job the
[38:33] lord giveth the lord taketh away but
[38:36] blessed be the name of the
[38:38] Lord these are the men of God that's
[38:40] going to help us understand what it
[38:42] means to be a true worshipper of him by
[38:46] the way that's my title I forgot to call
[38:48] it true worship is what I'm talking
[38:49] about this morning now Jesus said
[38:52] himself and I just happened to think of
[38:54] this trying to quote this scripture he
[38:55] said they that worship me the time is
[38:57] coming well they won't worship around
[38:59] here no more but the hour is coming and
[39:01] now is they that worship Him shall
[39:04] worship Him in spirit and in truth and
[39:08] the Baptist had him in the truth and the
[39:10] Pentecostals had him in the spirit amen
[39:12] one had the checkbook but no money in
[39:14] the bank the other had the money in the
[39:15] bank no checkbook brother BR said if you
[39:18] could ever get the two put together he
[39:20] said then you would have something by
[39:22] that would be amen a a a reflection of
[39:25] the book of Acts and the true church
[39:27] that God wanted and gave at Pentecost
[39:29] amen that's what brother Ram's mission
[39:31] was was to teach us how to get to money
[39:33] and to bank and put it all together so
[39:35] we could write the check and become the
[39:37] kind of people we need to
[39:39] become amen then once that account has
[39:43] been established and has been
[39:44] established in the hearts of the Bride
[39:46] then we can know how to worship God than
[39:51] friends when worship was first
[39:53] established in the very beginning with
[39:55] the New Testament Church
[39:57] you know all they had was the Old
[39:59] Testament side of things I mean think
[40:01] about it here these people you'd see for
[40:04] Shadows all down through the Old
[40:05] Testament Miriam grab that tambourine
[40:08] and Shout on the
[40:09] bank you'd see semi and them just
[40:12] without any bidding raise our hands up
[40:14] and thank God like that Jesus himself
[40:16] was a little bit Pentecostal he used to
[40:18] raise his hands up and thank the Lord
[40:20] too amen and yet at the very same time
[40:23] amen all they had was a reflection of
[40:25] what were worship was from the Old
[40:27] Testament think about that when they
[40:30] would go into the temple they had to be
[40:31] dressed a certain way they had to have a
[40:34] certain order of things everything had
[40:37] to be placed in its proper order and as
[40:39] they went back into the veil and they
[40:41] pulled back them flaps there was four
[40:43] flaps Matthew Mark Luke and John and as
[40:47] they pulled them flaps back and stepped
[40:48] back in behind that Veil they begin to
[40:51] Worship the Lord it wasn't just a
[40:54] Hallelujah and praise the Lord and glory
[40:55] to God like we have today but it was a
[40:58] reverential fear knowing that they were
[41:01] there for a purpose that everything God
[41:04] required of them was in its proper place
[41:06] now I want you to listen to me close
[41:08] this is the reason why that we preach
[41:10] that women dress a certain way and
[41:12] mandress a certain way this is the
[41:14] reason we preach Church order this is
[41:16] the reason we preach an order of gifts
[41:19] this is the reason we preach in order of
[41:21] worship this is a reason we preach an
[41:23] order of the ministry and how they're
[41:25] supposed to operate amen an evangelist
[41:27] ain't supposed to tell a prophet what to
[41:28] do and a prophet ain't supposed to tell
[41:30] a pastor what to do and vice versa and
[41:32] on each one has got their ministries of
[41:34] how they operate and they operate
[41:36] severly as they will but under one
[41:39] anointing of the holy spirit let all
[41:41] things Paul said all things all a l l
[41:45] all things be done decently and in order
[41:49] you know and we see it a lot amongst the
[41:52] people of this truth they got a lot of
[41:54] decency about them but not a lot of
[41:55] order
[41:57] and then a lot of order sometimes and
[41:58] not a lot of
[41:59] decency and just kind of willy-nilly and
[42:02] go about it and do whatever they want to
[42:03] do but God required the people to have
[42:06] an order now bridging from the Old
[42:09] Testament to the New Testament I've
[42:11] often said this that if you want to know
[42:13] what to bring up out of the Old
[42:15] Testament and what to place in the New
[42:17] Testament is not hard God provided a
[42:20] filter by the name of Paul that's right
[42:23] and the Apostle Paul was God's filter of
[42:26] what what we keep in the Old Testament
[42:27] and what we
[42:29] don't this is the reason why if you want
[42:31] to know what God wanted us to do from
[42:33] the Old Testament you go talk to Paul
[42:35] about it he was the man given the
[42:37] commission to place those things into
[42:39] the New Testament Church somebody said
[42:42] well who did he think he is well he must
[42:44] have thought God was behind him because
[42:46] he said though we are an angel preach
[42:48] anything contrary let him be a
[42:51] curse it's pretty powerful words pretty
[42:53] strong Revelation amen and him he said
[42:56] if a man think himself spiritual or a
[42:58] prophet let him acknowledge what I write
[43:01] are the Commandments of the
[43:03] Lord that's pretty strong and did you
[43:06] also notice there he said let him
[43:08] acknowledge because Paul didn't believe
[43:09] in women preachers that's he didn't say
[43:12] let him or her he said let him and he
[43:14] wasn't using someone's pronouns either
[43:16] they and them and H and all that amen
[43:19] because amen if you want to know where
[43:21] that stuff come from amen I I I'll just
[43:23] preach another sermon on on on hell and
[43:26] the devil and Satan and those things
[43:27] amen that's where a lot of that mess
[43:29] come from in the first place amen
[43:31] nothing but a bunch of perversion anyhow
[43:33] because you know you look at it don't
[43:35] call me a he or a she or call me an it
[43:37] or a that don't don't you see what's
[43:39] happening amen people don't have an
[43:42] identity they don't know what to do
[43:44] they're so confused about life and they
[43:46] just go into the neutral zones amen God
[43:49] don't want us living our life in a
[43:50] neutral zone he wants to identify who
[43:53] are we and who God made us
[43:58] amen I was preaching a Wednesday night
[44:00] back at the home Church our pastor's
[44:03] been into a family series and he invited
[44:05] me to come and speak and uh bring a
[44:07] portion of this family series and um I
[44:11] was sitting with my middle daughter
[44:12] anaise who was a little uh sing and this
[44:15] guy had done a talk that morning and he
[44:17] started in Daniel brother Jesse I
[44:20] noticed right away when he started
[44:21] reading how they changed the names of
[44:24] the children of Israel and Daniel and
[44:26] them amen it just it just grabbed me all
[44:28] of a sudden I thought you know that's
[44:29] what social media that's what all these
[44:32] other things are doing they're changing
[44:34] the identity of real saints of God Amen
[44:37] and giving them some false profile some
[44:39] fake life out there amen that they can
[44:42] hide behind that computer screen amen
[44:44] and change their identity to some
[44:46] Babylonian thing and never have to
[44:49] actually own up to who they really
[44:51] are amen listen let me just put it this
[44:54] way my family is is full of anxieties
[44:57] and fears that stuff just travels right
[45:00] down through our genetics and things
[45:02] amen and every single one of us amen my
[45:05] daughters me my wife my mom my dad when
[45:09] he was here and all my loved ones and
[45:11] when they are here amen are gone either
[45:14] way the life that they lived here amen
[45:17] nervous and all these other kind of
[45:19] things followed right down through that
[45:21] family line Satan would like to isolate
[45:24] our minds and make us think the only
[45:26] ones that experienced that amen but then
[45:28] you hear the prophet of God say now how
[45:31] many in here has nervous troubles he say
[45:33] 80% would raise up their
[45:35] hands amen but that's what Satan wants
[45:38] to do is isolate us away from the body
[45:42] amen from corporate worship amen because
[45:45] in here is where we can give strength
[45:47] one to another hallelujah amen the
[45:50] prophet said that we even have the
[45:52] ability if we're in the body to pass
[45:54] eternal life one to
[45:57] another and if I've got virtue and you
[45:59] need it amen in a corporate worship
[46:01] setting like this amen that wor that
[46:04] corporate worship will bring out that
[46:06] virtue and put it over in somebody else
[46:08] Hallelujah they may not even know where
[46:10] it's coming from amen but just someone
[46:13] exuding presence of God and powers of
[46:16] God and worship of the Lord and
[46:18] atmosphere like that oh you say it don't
[46:21] happen that way you should have said as
[46:22] far as you know I beg your pardon it
[46:25] does happen that that way amen when our
[46:27] Brethren get up here on this music and
[46:28] start playing you may not realize it or
[46:31] not but as gifted men amen all them
[46:33] little Devils you carried in from the
[46:35] world into this church with you amen
[46:37] them Divine healers are sending them
[46:39] Spirits off of you amen why in corporate
[46:42] worship that's where the anointing flows
[46:45] through the body of Christ and brother
[46:47] said these gifts of God Mill through
[46:49] this body while we're sitting
[46:51] here amen this is one reason why I
[46:54] believe that we got to be careful not to
[46:56] just alter call Pump It Up yes sir we
[46:59] need to understand that the power of God
[47:02] doesn't just operate just when someone
[47:04] calls an autter call or when someone
[47:06] comes up for prayer the mentality is
[47:09] okay now now I'm coming to the man of
[47:12] God for prayer now we're going to get
[47:14] under the
[47:15] anointing amen but you're under the
[47:17] anointing from the time you walk through
[47:19] the back door and walk through that door
[47:20] and sit down amen by the time the pastor
[47:23] walks out or the minister walks out the
[47:25] music is playing the worship is going
[47:27] and God is Milling through the body
[47:29] right then and people that understand
[47:32] that can absolutely fulfill Peter's
[47:34] words or Peter's example when he said
[47:36] while he yet spake these words the Holy
[47:39] Ghost fell on them that's what happens
[47:42] when we're taught amen that is what
[47:44] happen when we're established when you
[47:46] realize the root of Christ that is in
[47:48] you was not placed there by a pastor or
[47:50] nobody else wasn't placed there by your
[47:52] mama or brother Ram or some church
[47:54] member or some family member or just
[47:56] because you were taught to do it or told
[47:58] to do it that root was placed in there
[48:00] by Christ himself you may doubt it being
[48:02] that way but God put it in there
[48:05] anyways in spite of what you might think
[48:07] about it give it time you'll find out
[48:09] who's the boss in the long run amen
[48:12] that's right cuz I know what God does to
[48:14] hard heads I used to be one of them amen
[48:17] he'll send you through the ringer until
[48:19] you wake up when wise up a bit and
[48:22] understand God is the one in control of
[48:24] your destiny
[48:26] and he'll shake you every which away
[48:28] amen turn you we say down in the South
[48:30] turn you every Way but
[48:31] Loose amen until he gets you in the
[48:34] right position but established abounding
[48:37] therein with Thanksgiving so a person
[48:40] that has been established rooted built
[48:42] up and taught right they can abound with
[48:46] Thanksgiving I've noticed this brother
[48:48] Jesse as I travel and I i' I've noticed
[48:51] this many many
[48:53] times brother Smith when I'm going place
[48:55] to place to place to place you can tell
[48:58] the churches that aren't really taught
[49:01] how to worship
[49:02] correctly and sometimes these places of
[49:05] worship are
[49:07] loud
[49:09] emotional and all it takes me is about
[49:11] 20 minutes of good dig right into the
[49:13] soul preaching to find out they ain't
[49:15] got a clue what I'm talking about they
[49:17] can be emotional they be loud they jump
[49:20] and hop and scream all over the place
[49:22] but that does not mean they understand
[49:24] their part on the inside of this Booker
[49:26] I'm preaching about yes sir yes sir cuz
[49:29] you could have all of those emotions
[49:31] like that and still never produce
[49:32] nothing talk to some of these people
[49:34] that come out of Pentecost and Apostolic
[49:37] my mom and and some of these things amen
[49:39] talk to some of these people that came
[49:40] out amen my mother used to Tar at the
[49:43] altars all night long amen and T and
[49:45] pray with them until they spoke in
[49:47] tongues and many of them would speak in
[49:49] tongues and walk right out there amen
[49:51] and commit adultery with somebody's wife
[49:53] smoking cigarettes cussing out out of
[49:55] both sides of their mouth on and on and
[49:58] on and on not enough power of God to
[50:01] blow the fuzz off a peach right brother
[50:04] and yet they were emotional yet that
[50:06] proves that there was no real root
[50:09] placed in the heart now many of you have
[50:12] heard my testimony you know the early
[50:14] days I come up mostly around the return
[50:16] Ministry movement when I was a boy back
[50:18] to only the church we had down there
[50:20] that made any sense and so we went there
[50:22] as the best slice of bread or loaf of
[50:24] bread or whatever we could get at the
[50:25] time and so you know of course my old
[50:28] Pastor he was a wonderful Bible teacher
[50:30] it just somehow or another we always
[50:31] wound up both feet right in the middle
[50:33] of return somewhere amen but I learned
[50:35] how to love and be patient a lot of
[50:37] things from some of them teachings so
[50:39] I'm not disparaging of it I thank God
[50:41] for the time I had but because of the
[50:43] emphasis on them things there wasn't
[50:45] much worship we'd sing a song it'd be As
[50:48] Dead As midnight and sing the next song
[50:50] it was dead than the first one if you
[50:52] can imagine and somebody would get up
[50:54] and they'd take prayer requests for 30
[50:55] 35 minutes and then they would spend 25
[50:57] of that talking about that profit you
[51:01] got to Stomp the ground when you say it
[51:02] to get it right amen or the message you
[51:05] know you got to get your foot on there
[51:06] Amen to get it right amen or you got a
[51:09] gesture with your finger you wasn't
[51:10] getting the right holy ghost anointing
[51:11] if you didn't say it right amen and then
[51:13] all of that amen would come to the Apex
[51:17] of well Hallelujah God bless you Church
[51:20] take the name of Jesus with you amen we
[51:22] go through an entire service and not one
[51:24] time was there any really genuine
[51:27] corporate worship amongst that group why
[51:30] the failure to teach the people how to
[51:34] possess the word for themselves kills
[51:37] the body of
[51:40] Christ hang on a minute I just said a
[51:42] strong thing to you if you've only been
[51:45] taught believe the message because
[51:47] you've been taught believe the message
[51:48] you are never going to be able to
[51:50] worship God
[51:51] righty if you've been taught believe the
[51:54] Bible because you've been taught to
[51:55] believe believe the Bible you're never
[51:56] going to worship God right if you've
[51:59] been taught dress and live a certain way
[52:00] cuz you've been taught to dress and live
[52:02] a certain way and you don't possess that
[52:04] for yourself you will never worship God
[52:06] right it is hard to be thankful for
[52:09] something that's never penetrated your
[52:13] heart amen that's why our families
[52:15] brother they need more and sister they
[52:17] need more than just our teaching they
[52:19] need a real touch from the shikina
[52:22] himself amen that's what I pray for all
[52:24] three of my babies and I pray it for me
[52:26] too God keep their hearts sensitive that
[52:28] you can deal with them that you can move
[52:30] on them amen that you can all of the
[52:32] good things I could teach them that's
[52:34] wonderful but God keep them sensitive
[52:36] they can
[52:38] receive amen I pray it for me I pray it
[52:40] for my wife I pray for all of my loved
[52:42] ones amen I've got my three girls that
[52:45] I'm raising by God's grace and I try to
[52:47] raise them right their their daddy being
[52:50] a preacher I have tried my best Through
[52:52] The Years not to hammer him over the
[52:53] head with everything in the world yes
[52:55] sir cuz I didn't want him growing up
[52:56] hating church I've seen that too much
[52:59] where people pull them and press them
[53:01] and twist them and squeeze on them every
[53:03] which way and a second they get old
[53:05] enough to get out the door and get a
[53:06] little money in their pocket amen they
[53:08] run to the world as hard as they can go
[53:10] amen but what I've always tried to do as
[53:12] a father is instruct this is my
[53:15] Revelation this is what I believe this
[53:18] may not be what you believe and until
[53:20] God reveals it to you this is not my
[53:22] this is not your Revelation it's mine
[53:25] this is what God done for me this is
[53:27] what God put in my heart this is what
[53:29] the Lord shown me amen but what we've
[53:32] done as many times in our homes we've
[53:34] tried to raise little
[53:36] Messiahs when they were born Sinners
[53:38] just like you and I was I mean you Holy
[53:40] Ghost filled people and each one has to
[53:43] have their own revelation of Jesus
[53:47] Christ I should be getting a lot more
[53:48] amens of what I'm getting right now let
[53:51] me tell you that right now let me say it
[53:52] one more time each one everyone no
[53:54] matter of their age category who they
[53:56] are where they come from or background
[53:58] all of us have to have our own
[54:01] revelation of Jesus
[54:03] Christ because if I can Force One into
[54:05] it somebody will force him out of it if
[54:08] I can pull one in somebody will pull
[54:10] them out it just depends on how strong
[54:13] their influence is that's why it takes
[54:15] God to establish that
[54:17] seed Hallelujah it takes the Holy Ghost
[54:20] to plant that in their
[54:22] hearts and if it ain't there I can't put
[54:24] it there
[54:26] that's what I've said many times
[54:27] preaching like this I'd say you know
[54:29] somebody say to me uh uh for example
[54:31] brother Ben I need that Revelation I
[54:33] said but I can't give it to you h no man
[54:36] not one man can give another one a
[54:39] revelation it comes sovereignly by God
[54:42] Amen to who he will reveal it he'll
[54:44] reveal it but we have to be a ground
[54:47] amen that is good
[54:49] ground you got to get all the rock out
[54:51] of there you got to make sure them birds
[54:54] and all them are scared away out of
[54:56] there got to make sure it's good ground
[54:58] and even that brother said was
[54:59] predestinated before the foundation of
[55:01] the world yet there are certain things
[55:04] that if God wanted to do it amen he
[55:06] could shake anybody in and Shake anybody
[55:10] out if God wanted to fill this room up
[55:12] full of fleas are thick we couldn't bat
[55:13] our eyes he do whatever he wants to he's
[55:15] God but even God himself follows a
[55:18] program and an ordination he does
[55:21] everything decently and God does it in
[55:23] order amen so he don't call unless
[55:25] there's something to call and it don't
[55:27] reject unless there's something to
[55:29] reject and it lays upon us the
[55:31] responsibility my brother sister please
[55:33] listen to every word I'm saying every
[55:35] word right now listen to this don't let
[55:37] this leave your heart it is not God's
[55:39] responsibility to find out am I a part
[55:42] of this program or not that is for you
[55:44] and I to pray get in this Bible and
[55:46] start studying and reading listen to the
[55:48] message amen start with your Bible and
[55:51] move into the things of
[55:52] godj that burden lays upon on us to find
[55:56] out what is my purpose here in life it's
[56:00] easy for some people to say well
[56:01] Hallelujah Hallelujah I'm a part of the
[56:03] message I'm a believer I'm a believer
[56:04] I'm a Believer many of them are saying
[56:05] that just because they're robots and
[56:07] been taught that they're not saying that
[56:09] because it's Revelation to them they
[56:10] just been taught that amen and they're
[56:13] saying it that ain't no different in
[56:14] this and that modern day and somebody
[56:15] say well what are you I'm Pentecostal
[56:17] Pentecostal Pentecostal Pentecostal
[56:18] Baptist Baptist Baptist Baptist and our
[56:21] people message message message message
[56:24] they don't know anything else to say
[56:26] that's why they don't know how to
[56:27] Worship in the capacity of a
[56:30] Believer amen because the only way to
[56:33] Worship in God's chosen place oh I love
[56:36] to say this Hallelujah is to be in God's
[56:39] chosen place of
[56:41] worship amen and by one Spirit
[56:44] Hallelujah not by one church not by one
[56:48] preacher not by one Movement by one St
[56:52] we are all baptized into to the body of
[56:56] Christ hallelujah
[56:59] hallelujah if I am in that body I can
[57:04] worship I can praise the Lord I can
[57:08] worship Hall amen glory cuz I'm coming
[57:13] from a place from a
[57:15] source of real worship where it can
[57:17] really come from hallelujah thank you
[57:22] Jesus now Colossians chapter 4 verse
[57:26] two let's go through some scriptures for
[57:28] a little bit can we I figure I got about
[57:31] 20 minutes I guess we're at about 20
[57:33] till all that singing I think maybe if I
[57:35] take you to 12 it' be all right you
[57:37] reckon all right pH excuse me Colossians
[57:40] I mean chapter 4 verse
[57:43] two now watch what he says here continue
[57:48] in prayer that's a good thing isin't
[57:50] it but now watch the next part and watch
[57:53] in the same
[58:01] huh with
[58:03] Thanksgiving it's amazing how we pray
[58:06] but we forget the Thanksgiving
[58:09] part girls are pray I need a husband I
[58:11] need a husband I need a husband but you
[58:12] ain't thinking the Lord he going to come
[58:15] good brother good example amen both boys
[58:18] are praying send me a good girl send me
[58:19] a right woman and praying but we're not
[58:21] thanking the lord she's on the
[58:23] way uh talk to me now we've got to
[58:27] remember what we ask God for if he
[58:30] doesn't tell us no then there's a
[58:32] possibility it might be a
[58:36] yes and we should be thankful are you
[58:39] with me are you listening are you with
[58:42] me we should be thankful to God and say
[58:45] Lord thank you for sending me whatever
[58:48] it is I'm praying
[58:51] for you ever stop to think one reason
[58:53] God just don't put it in our la because
[58:55] he knows we ain't nothing but an
[58:56] ungrateful bunch of SPO
[58:58] brats we're asking asking asking asking
[59:01] almost demanding many times and never
[59:04] stop to say Lord thank you for being
[59:05] gracious to me to be able to let me
[59:07] first even ask
[59:09] you I wonder if we practice a little bit
[59:12] more of this right here if we wouldn't
[59:13] see more prayers go
[59:15] woooooo woo preach brother Ben I think I
[59:19] will wonder if we would start thanking
[59:21] the lord a little bit more wonder if
[59:23] we'd start giving him some Glory Glory
[59:25] about what we asked him about I wonder
[59:28] if we would see more coming our
[59:32] way but if we're spoiled and ungrateful
[59:35] how's he ever going to give us
[59:38] anything say well I would be
[59:40] appreciative of great things and good
[59:42] things in the Lord and all that but you
[59:44] know God never answers my
[59:47] prayer right wonder why now Revelation
[59:53] 7:12 now notice
[59:55] this now this is uh not exactly right
[59:59] attached to the Seven Seals but the same
[1:00:02] thing occurs at the very time of the
[1:00:05] opening of the word now there's 30
[1:00:09] minutes of
[1:00:10] silence when the lion roars out liken
[1:00:14] that to the lion in The Jungle he said
[1:00:15] when he cries out everything goes quiet
[1:00:18] he said the king is about to speak and
[1:00:19] so everything goes silent now the space
[1:00:23] of a half an hour
[1:00:25] is already
[1:00:26] done
[1:00:27] okay but I'm convinced that some message
[1:00:30] people
[1:00:31] believe we still in the
[1:00:36] silence they forgot how to say Amen 30
[1:00:38] years
[1:00:39] ago they don't worship they don't praise
[1:00:43] they don't have any kind of anything
[1:00:44] about them and you preach a message like
[1:00:46] I'm preaching this morning they think
[1:00:47] you're Pentecostal and you
[1:00:49] backslid well we're in the word now we
[1:00:52] should be in the Revelation well if the
[1:00:54] revelation is the Revelation I think
[1:00:55] this is a part of the Revelation is
[1:01:00] it
[1:01:01] amen yet at the very same time how many
[1:01:04] do you know you could go visit a camp or
[1:01:07] whatever and they get in these camps and
[1:01:08] these special revivals and they are
[1:01:10] tearing the walls out of the place go
[1:01:13] home with some of them go home with some
[1:01:16] of them I do cuz I'm usually their
[1:01:18] church is four and five and six and 8
[1:01:20] and 12 months afterwards and I know how
[1:01:23] they behave
[1:01:26] some of them will shout and roll in the
[1:01:28] saw dust and speak in tongues and
[1:01:29] slobber and everything else and get home
[1:01:32] and set out like a bump on a log amen
[1:01:35] yes sir now that's not worship that's
[1:01:39] excitement come on Amen it's getting
[1:01:42] under the anointing of some preacher or
[1:01:43] some Minister under the anointing of the
[1:01:45] conre and granted it's corporate worship
[1:01:47] thank God they've got an atmosphere that
[1:01:49] maybe they can get born in but that
[1:01:51] atmosphere atmosphere rather should
[1:01:53] follow you home and in
[1:01:56] your Amen in the school and everywhere
[1:01:59] [Applause]
[1:02:01] else now watch this now in Revelation
[1:02:04] 7:12 he said
[1:02:06] amen
[1:02:08] blessing
[1:02:10] Glory you ain't quit on me yet have you
[1:02:14] wisdom
[1:02:15] Thanksgiving honor power might be under
[1:02:19] our God forever and ever and John got so
[1:02:22] excited he said amen twice
[1:02:24] [Music]
[1:02:26] Hallelujah Heaven helped some of these
[1:02:27] people in the message they don't even
[1:02:28] know how to say Amen once much less
[1:02:32] twice as they come to church and they
[1:02:34] think being in church is the purpose is
[1:02:36] to be educated to learn something new
[1:02:39] what new thing can you teach me man of
[1:02:41] God I got news for you folks this church
[1:02:43] is not a TED Talk that's right that's
[1:02:46] right this is not an instructional
[1:02:47] YouTube video or or some Instagram video
[1:02:50] or some Facebook thing where you're
[1:02:52] learning how to bake a pie or sew some
[1:02:54] certain certain thing or fix a
[1:02:56] car this is not some intellectual talk
[1:02:58] this is the house of God that is a house
[1:03:01] of prayer and
[1:03:04] worship glory to
[1:03:07] God the TED Talks had the anointing and
[1:03:10] let him saying blessing and honor and
[1:03:11] glory and wisdom and
[1:03:13] Hallelujah but you ain't going to catch
[1:03:15] him doing that there CU that ain't the
[1:03:16] atmosphere for it so we shouldn't bring
[1:03:18] that into
[1:03:20] here oh I know how some people well you
[1:03:23] know brother Jesse's a teacher and maybe
[1:03:25] he doesn't get super excited and run
[1:03:27] around and you know but that ain't got
[1:03:30] nothing to do with your
[1:03:34] anointing let me tell you something
[1:03:35] brother I would almost rather hear a
[1:03:37] teacher in this day and age than I would
[1:03:39] somebody run around say where the bride
[1:03:40] where in the bride where're in the
[1:03:41] message where in the message I knew that
[1:03:43] 30 years ago now I need to know how to
[1:03:45] live
[1:03:47] right hello
[1:03:50] somebody I knew that 30 years ago when I
[1:03:52] first give my heart to the Lord now I
[1:03:54] need to have overcome everything around
[1:03:58] me I need someone to teach me something
[1:04:02] instruct me tell me
[1:04:04] [Applause]
[1:04:07] how how to be a good father how to be a
[1:04:10] good husband how to be a good son of
[1:04:13] God somebody teach me
[1:04:16] how to do the things God wants me to
[1:04:20] do yes heyen listen to this in the time
[1:04:23] of decision brother B says the church
[1:04:25] that's praising and blessing and
[1:04:28] watering with Thanksgiving to the Holy
[1:04:30] Ghost who has brought the word to
[1:04:34] you he types it with Isaac and
[1:04:37] Rebecca when elzer went out there and
[1:04:39] found him the right
[1:04:41] woman brother B said that she jumped up
[1:04:44] on that
[1:04:45] Camel you see a beast in the Bible
[1:04:48] represents a power right the power
[1:04:52] represents the Holy Ghost
[1:04:55] and the holy ghost that she
[1:04:57] watered was the Holy Ghost that carried
[1:05:00] her to meet her bridegroom that's right
[1:05:02] her new birth experience the power that
[1:05:05] laid in her you know a camel's a funny
[1:05:07] buil animal anyways you know reason they
[1:05:10] don't need a lot of water and all that
[1:05:11] kind of stuff their veins and things are
[1:05:13] really really wide open and thick like
[1:05:15] this where the blood just continually
[1:05:17] flow not like little skinny tiny veins
[1:05:19] like us humans got that's why we have to
[1:05:21] keep drinking water to keep from getting
[1:05:23] dehydrated but a camel got these big old
[1:05:25] veins like this and the blood just keeps
[1:05:27] circulating you see because that's what
[1:05:29] keeps the camel moving it has a lot of
[1:05:31] blood moving through
[1:05:33] it Hallelujah kind of like my Holy Ghost
[1:05:38] the blood of Christ is always moving
[1:05:40] through it I don't ever have to worry
[1:05:42] about being dehydrated during this
[1:05:44] spiritual drought
[1:05:46] season while I'm in the spiritual
[1:05:48] denominational organizational lady
[1:05:50] seeing
[1:05:51] desert Hallelujah I don't have to worry
[1:05:54] about it the blood is always
[1:05:59] flowing glory to God
[1:06:02] hallelujah hallelujah GL amen no matter
[1:06:07] how dry I my
[1:06:10] get the blood is still flowing through
[1:06:12] the
[1:06:16] body than you Jesus amen it's also one
[1:06:19] reason why I don't have to keep coming
[1:06:21] to church and keep looking for some huge
[1:06:23] Pentecostal out pouring every time I
[1:06:25] come it's okay to come to churches
[1:06:27] sometimes it be
[1:06:28] dry don't worry little camel you'll be
[1:06:30] all
[1:06:32] right yes sir oh you know the churches
[1:06:35] that go through dry spells pastors go
[1:06:38] through dry spells congregations go
[1:06:40] through dry
[1:06:42] spells but if you're riding the Holy
[1:06:44] Ghost camel don't worry your camel won't
[1:06:45] dry up and
[1:06:47] die he's
[1:06:48] Bel he's
[1:06:51] ballah to withstand the pressure
[1:06:57] am he's constructed God
[1:07:00] ordained to withstand the pressure of
[1:07:03] the
[1:07:05] desert Hallelujah that's why some people
[1:07:07] say well I go to that church out there
[1:07:08] but it's just so dry well you every
[1:07:11] you're not a
[1:07:13] camel that's why they run to every
[1:07:15] meeting they can and every outpouring
[1:07:17] they can because you know if you're not
[1:07:18] a camel you need lots of
[1:07:21] water some of these people got these
[1:07:23] thin little lady will see in veins they
[1:07:25] can just can't just barely make it
[1:07:27] somebody pray for me I can get back to
[1:07:28] prayer meeting in the middle of the
[1:07:30] church I can't hardly get through you
[1:07:32] ain't no
[1:07:33] camel if God ordained you with a holy
[1:07:36] ghost camel brother amen you can go
[1:07:38] through days and days and days of a dry
[1:07:41] spell I feel like
[1:07:43] shouting hallelujah
[1:07:46] hallelujah it can go mon sometimes a
[1:07:49] prophet of God said one time the Lord
[1:07:51] Jesus put him in a trial amen and
[1:07:53] stopped talking to him for six long
[1:07:55] months but did Brother Bram die up and
[1:07:57] die spiritually no he was on a
[1:08:03] cam glory to God hallelujah and that cam
[1:08:08] is built to EST stand the pressure of
[1:08:12] the
[1:08:13] Desert Glory
[1:08:19] [Applause]
[1:08:21] Hallelujah Hallelujah
[1:08:27] amen amen glory to
[1:08:31] [Applause]
[1:08:32] God so don't worry Rebecca if things get
[1:08:36] a little dry around you just remember
[1:08:38] that cam was
[1:08:40] built wo he is built to take all that
[1:08:45] heat and all that pressure that's right
[1:08:48] and if she watered him he took her
[1:08:49] straight to Isaac and that's the way it
[1:08:52] is oh thank you Lord there'll come some
[1:08:54] times and that Holy Ghost says I need a
[1:08:57] prayer
[1:08:58] meeting you need to spend some time with
[1:09:00] your
[1:09:01] Bible I need to get back in
[1:09:04] church oh hallelujah
[1:09:09] hallelujah oh thank you Jesus now 2
[1:09:12] Corinthians chapter 4 verse1
[1:09:15] 15 watch this now Paul says for all
[1:09:19] things are for your
[1:09:21] sakes watch this that the abundant
[1:09:28] grace the abundant grace might through
[1:09:32] the Thanksgiving of
[1:09:34] many redown to the glory of God
[1:09:37] corporate worship yes so not just one
[1:09:41] giving praise but as the whole
[1:09:43] congregation as the whole group enters
[1:09:45] in it just rebounds or redounds back to
[1:09:48] the glory of God this is why the Bible
[1:09:51] said when one rejoices we should all
[1:09:53] rejoice
[1:09:54] one cries we should all cry in other
[1:09:57] words not walk around feeling sorry for
[1:09:58] our but when one's going through a hard
[1:10:00] trial to enter into that burden of
[1:10:03] Affliction God help my brother help my
[1:10:05] sister help that family help that school
[1:10:08] boy help that school girl they're going
[1:10:09] through hell on this Earth and they need
[1:10:11] some help God I put forth my faith and
[1:10:14] my Thanksgiving to you that you can
[1:10:16] bring them out the same as you can bring
[1:10:18] me and all the
[1:10:21] rest glory to God
[1:10:25] hallelujah that you can bring all of us
[1:10:28] out of this
[1:10:30] [Applause]
[1:10:32] Thing 2 Corinthians chapter 9: 11 Paul
[1:10:36] says being
[1:10:38] enriched in
[1:10:40] everything to all
[1:10:45] bountifulness which causeth through US
[1:10:48] Thanksgiving to
[1:10:50] God this word enrich means to be rich of
[1:10:54] spiritual Rich riches to be richly
[1:10:58] furnished so Paul says we are furnished
[1:11:02] richly in everything to
[1:11:05] bountifulness so where in the name of
[1:11:08] God friends respectfully and honestly
[1:11:11] where in the world do people get this
[1:11:14] idea living here I've just got barely
[1:11:17] enough to make
[1:11:19] it you hear so-called Christians
[1:11:21] sometimes I just don't know if I I can
[1:11:24] make it through I just can barely
[1:11:27] somebody the Old Devil told me the other
[1:11:29] day praise His holy name that I probably
[1:11:31] wasn't saved and probably wasn't going
[1:11:33] to make it in the
[1:11:35] Rapture right brother and I imagine if
[1:11:39] these people are truly born again the
[1:11:40] Holy Ghost what they're doing is on the
[1:11:42] front porch with the door shut huddled
[1:11:45] in a corner in the fetal position nearly
[1:11:48] acting like they ain't got nothing when
[1:11:49] all you got to do is kick the front door
[1:11:51] in and start looking around that's good
[1:11:54] brother
[1:11:55] good that's why we don't need to be
[1:11:57] sitting around feeling sorry for oursel
[1:11:59] all the time sitting around worry all
[1:12:01] about this and obsessing about every
[1:12:03] little thing am I this am I that am I
[1:12:05] the other just stop looking at yourself
[1:12:08] and start looking at the Abundant
[1:12:12] riches is anybody hear me this morning
[1:12:15] stop looking at yourself as long as you
[1:12:19] focus on you you will never see success
[1:12:23] if you'll keep your eyes on that
[1:12:26] word you will always be successful you
[1:12:30] will always see the riches and the
[1:12:34] glory and the power and the wisdom and
[1:12:38] the
[1:12:38] might be unto our God
[1:12:42] forever
[1:12:43] [Applause]
[1:12:49] amen but as long as you keep your eyes
[1:12:52] on here
[1:12:54] long as you're always looking at this
[1:12:57] well I'm not this I'm not that what will
[1:12:59] people think what won't they think what
[1:13:00] this what that what that you will never
[1:13:02] ever see this right
[1:13:05] here but get your eyes off
[1:13:07] that praise the
[1:13:09] Lord I love this in Jehovah Miracles
[1:13:12] brother said you know every day every
[1:13:16] hour is a Thanksgiving
[1:13:22] Day now most Americans and Canadians
[1:13:26] Alli will celebrate Thanksgiving one day
[1:13:28] of the year but to the elect every day
[1:13:30] is a
[1:13:32] [Music]
[1:13:34] Thanksgiving he said I once was blind
[1:13:36] but now I see again brother B is
[1:13:39] preaching along and he says oh praise be
[1:13:42] to God well I guess it's appropriate for
[1:13:45] a minister to worship God from the pull
[1:13:47] pit he
[1:13:48] says but you know what's amazing how
[1:13:51] many preachers you see today that preach
[1:13:54] and preach and preach and preach but
[1:13:55] never get
[1:13:58] blessed now here's our example brother
[1:14:01] Bram is Malachi 4 this is Elijah Elijah
[1:14:04] the prophet of that anointing of the
[1:14:05] ministry of Elijah gets something good
[1:14:07] from the Lord he goes oh praise be to
[1:14:09] God but you don't see that anymore you
[1:14:12] see these guys he just talk and talk and
[1:14:14] turn pages and scroll and next slide and
[1:14:18] next slide and are you with me folks and
[1:14:22] but you never see them just step back
[1:14:24] and go my goodness
[1:14:28] Hallelujah so not only is it appropriate
[1:14:31] for you to be blessed but it's appr and
[1:14:33] to worship for that matter but it's also
[1:14:35] appropriate for me to
[1:14:38] worship because you see this is the
[1:14:40] misconception about preaching folks have
[1:14:43] their minds set up that when a preacher
[1:14:45] preaches we've got everything fixed
[1:14:46] we've solved everything overcome
[1:14:48] everything we preach I got news for you
[1:14:51] there are many things that we preach
[1:14:53] that we have not overcome ourselves
[1:14:55] right and we're not required by God to
[1:14:57] have it all licked whipped and under our
[1:14:59] feet before we preach it to the people
[1:15:02] we are setting an image up before all of
[1:15:04] us not just you but before me as well
[1:15:07] this is the goal this is the mark of the
[1:15:09] prize of the high calling and this is
[1:15:11] what we're all striving
[1:15:13] for oh you say that's not right hold on
[1:15:16] now before brother Brandon preaches
[1:15:18] marriage and divorce he had been looking
[1:15:21] at it and working at it for the my since
[1:15:23] the 50s early 50s Holy Spirit told him
[1:15:26] to tape it he tells I'm going to break
[1:15:28] every Church up in the nation if I
[1:15:30] preach it brother bam T toiled and
[1:15:32] carried and waited on God Plum up to
[1:15:35] February of 65 before he preaches it
[1:15:38] right right before he preaches it he's
[1:15:40] at the Tabernacle and he preaches a
[1:15:42] message called a man running from the
[1:15:45] presence of the Lord you know why he
[1:15:48] preached a man running from the presence
[1:15:50] of the Lord cuz he was that man running
[1:15:52] from the the presence of the
[1:15:55] Lord he knew what people were going to
[1:15:58] do with his message when it was over
[1:16:00] with that's look at what some of these
[1:16:02] guys have done over the polygamy things
[1:16:04] and over marriage and divorce in general
[1:16:06] look what they've done with all that
[1:16:07] foolishness that they've done yes sir
[1:16:09] taking a pure Godly thus sayith the Lord
[1:16:12] and they've Twisted it in a a trillion
[1:16:14] different ways
[1:16:16] right and here he is well I just thought
[1:16:20] I would Preach Today on Jonah a and
[1:16:23] running from the presence of the Lord
[1:16:25] why he was setting that image up before
[1:16:27] himself he was saying to you and the
[1:16:30] people and to himself William brandham
[1:16:32] this is what you need to be mindful
[1:16:36] ofallah if you go running away from this
[1:16:38] God will stick you in the belly of a
[1:16:39] whale
[1:16:40] boy right brother praise the Lord man
[1:16:44] I've told young preachers at different
[1:16:46] times and they think about being called
[1:16:47] and they act like they're wanting to run
[1:16:49] I said Just remember when you get down
[1:16:50] that whales belly just look up around
[1:16:52] the right side about halfway down and
[1:16:54] you're going to see brother Ben was
[1:16:57] here I said if you look above that
[1:16:59] you're going to see brother Brandon was
[1:17:00] here Wesley was here Luther was here
[1:17:02] Paul was here Peter was
[1:17:04] here all of us have that time that we
[1:17:07] just don't want to respond and take the
[1:17:08] responsibility of things sir but God
[1:17:12] holds our feet to the
[1:17:14] fire that we've got to do the thing that
[1:17:17] we have been called of God to do so the
[1:17:20] preacher is not just up there preaching
[1:17:22] it for you he's preaching it for himself
[1:17:23] too right and I hear him in
[1:17:26] 1962 January I think it was of 62 he's
[1:17:29] in Arizona preaching and up to this time
[1:17:32] if you study the progression of it
[1:17:33] brother renam has always said that Eve
[1:17:35] provided the egg for the Holy Spirit to
[1:17:37] mate with to produce the body of Christ
[1:17:39] that's right brother Jesse while he's in
[1:17:41] the
[1:17:42] platform while he's preaching the spirit
[1:17:46] of God reveals to him look and this is
[1:17:49] the statement we get later Look What
[1:17:51] You've Got God doing if you do that that
[1:17:54] takes a sensation to produce an egg and
[1:17:57] only a sensation or a sexual feeling
[1:18:00] would bring the egg down and that sexual
[1:18:02] feeling would have had to come from God
[1:18:03] and then brother bam says oh my oh my
[1:18:06] this is coming fresh never saw this
[1:18:08] before praise be to
[1:18:10] God he said she couldn't have produced
[1:18:13] that God couldn't have moved on her in
[1:18:15] that way it would have been sin and sex
[1:18:17] all over
[1:18:19] again so God created the sperm God
[1:18:21] created the egg and God brought them
[1:18:23] together in conception and the blood
[1:18:25] cell was created perfectly by God Joseph
[1:18:28] was not the father Mary was not the
[1:18:31] mother there was no sensations of sex
[1:18:34] anywhere it was perfect virgin
[1:18:38] amen creation praise be to God creation
[1:18:42] of
[1:18:43] God that's why he's our Messiah and his
[1:18:48] blood sets us free from
[1:18:51] everything
[1:18:53] amen amen and while brother bam is
[1:18:56] preaching this he says Oh Praise the
[1:18:58] Lord
[1:19:00] hallelujah now for these people to than
[1:19:02] every word brother B said was thus
[1:19:03] sayith the Lord to me they're going to
[1:19:04] struggle when they come
[1:19:06] there because he wasn't perfect he
[1:19:09] wasn't infallible he was learning just
[1:19:12] like you and I
[1:19:16] do praise the Lord right here at 12:00
[1:19:20] I'm going to have to hurry if I'm going
[1:19:21] to get to 12 INE now watch this in a key
[1:19:24] to the door brother says now communion
[1:19:27] means
[1:19:29] Thanksgiving to the Protestant
[1:19:31] communion is Thanksgiving for what God
[1:19:35] has already done in communion with
[1:19:38] communion with God communion with him
[1:19:40] it's already done the Catholic takes
[1:19:42] Mass hoping God's going to forgive
[1:19:46] something but we take communion
[1:19:49] communion with Christ knowing our
[1:19:51] Thanksgiving that God has already done
[1:19:56] it but how many people do you see
[1:19:59] approach a communion table like they're
[1:20:01] coming to a
[1:20:02] mass they come to the communion table
[1:20:05] and they're oh God please don't strike
[1:20:06] me dead oh God please don't let me die
[1:20:09] oh God please don't let me be guilty of
[1:20:10] taking the body and the blood unworthily
[1:20:12] oh God if you are born again of the Holy
[1:20:16] Ghost that's
[1:20:17] impossible
[1:20:18] that's that's right we should be
[1:20:21] approaching a communion table with
[1:20:24] joy as I told my mother some time ago
[1:20:26] there's healing in that communion it's
[1:20:29] not that bread and not that wine that a
[1:20:31] person would take it's what it
[1:20:32] symbolizes the same thing as if you're
[1:20:35] sick and I put my hands on you like this
[1:20:37] it's what it symbolizes it's not my hand
[1:20:40] but I'm representing Christ on
[1:20:42] Earth glory be to God hallelujah I'm
[1:20:46] representing the body and the blood and
[1:20:48] if I take that in faith am there's
[1:20:52] healing and it I approach the communion
[1:20:54] table I don't go there saying oh God oh
[1:20:56] God please please it's why some people
[1:20:58] come to church oh God please I
[1:21:01] ple but if I'm set settled established
[1:21:04] in the faith rooted and built up I
[1:21:07] should be able to walk to that communion
[1:21:08] table Lord thank you for your blood
[1:21:12] thank you for your body God it was
[1:21:14] broken for me by your stripes I am
[1:21:18] healed and by your blood I am
[1:21:21] regenerated
[1:21:28] to some people it's a problem to me it
[1:21:30] ain't no big deal it ain't no bigger
[1:21:33] deal to me than was getting baptized I
[1:21:35] didn't go down to the river going oh God
[1:21:37] I hope I'm saved oh Lord I hope I'll get
[1:21:39] the Holy Ghost I was like man where are
[1:21:41] we getting baptized at get me down there
[1:21:44] I can't
[1:21:47] [Applause]
[1:21:50] wait woo glory to God some of y'all

[1:22:29] the altar was some dry eyed
[1:22:35] confession now as he's saying the

[1:23:47] i' be teaching these kids and you can
[1:23:49] hear in the background boom boom bo bo
[1:23:51] boom bo bo boom boom boom fireworks
[1:23:54] everywhere couldn't even hardly teach
[1:23:55] these youngans because there were so
[1:23:57] many fireworks it was like boom bo bo bo
[1:23:59] bo bo bo boom these kids would laugh
[1:24:03] Chinese New Year Chinese New Year and I
[1:24:05] would listen to them I'd ask them
[1:24:06] questions I'd say well what does that
[1:24:08] holiday mean to you you know what
[1:24:10] answers I got out of 12 year olds and 10
[1:24:13] year olds ah we go to my grandfather's
[1:24:16] we go to grandmothers and we have a
[1:24:17] little supper and that's
[1:24:19] it now to the Chinese it is the
[1:24:22] celebration of spring coming to them not
[1:24:26] being like Christian type people there's
[1:24:28] no protestantism over there as as as we
[1:24:30] would know it here to them it's just a
[1:24:33] traditional thing that they honor
[1:24:35] because that's just what they do in
[1:24:37] China and I sat and thought to
[1:24:40] myself how many Revival Services have we
[1:24:43] had people boom boom bo boom boom boom
[1:24:45] boom in the church people are worshiping
[1:24:48] everywhere or people the message the
[1:24:50] message boom boom boom boom boom boom
[1:24:51] the prophet the the prophet boom boom
[1:24:53] boom boom boom boom boom but when you
[1:24:54] really get to asking them what it all
[1:24:56] means it's nothing but a traditional
[1:24:59] Gathering you know what God Said to
[1:25:01] Israel he said your Feast your new moons
[1:25:03] your washing of pots and bands all of it
[1:25:06] has become a stink in my
[1:25:08] nostril think of it the very God that
[1:25:11] established the very worship they were
[1:25:13] performing the very thing they were
[1:25:15] demonstrating brother Smith was the very
[1:25:17] thing God told him to do and he tells
[1:25:19] them very same people about the very
[1:25:21] thing he told them to do it's become a
[1:25:23] stink in my nostril why it wasn't the
[1:25:25] action they were performing it was their
[1:25:28] attitude toward what was being
[1:25:34] performed I'll leave you with this we
[1:25:36] we'll we we'll break and come back the
[1:25:38] afternoon the Lord
[1:25:39] will Paul Raider remember that name in
[1:25:43] the message brother Bram had a
[1:25:45] friend Paul Raiders the one that wrote
[1:25:47] only
[1:25:48] believe he said he's a cut up had a
[1:25:50] sense of humor but he's also kind of a
[1:25:52] hot high high tempered type fell
[1:25:55] hotheaded and uh hotheaded I'm trying to
[1:25:58] say and him and his wife got in a fuss
[1:26:02] he said they had a little tradition so
[1:26:03] when they come to the door when he's
[1:26:05] going to work he'd kiss her she'd kiss
[1:26:06] him wave goodbye from the car and to go
[1:26:08] out and they got in a fuss that morning
[1:26:11] and uh do you some of you Yankees
[1:26:13] Northern people up here you know what
[1:26:15] fussing means you ever heard anybody
[1:26:17] fuss ever get in a fuss with your
[1:26:19] brother or sister some of you after
[1:26:22] Saints you know what fussing is do you
[1:26:24] do that in Africa somewhere or
[1:26:26] another they had a little spat little
[1:26:30] fuss he grabbed her and kissed her she
[1:26:32] kissed him he got to the car he waved
[1:26:33] she waved he went around the corner and
[1:26:35] a little bit he got down the road and he
[1:26:36] got under conviction something struck
[1:26:38] his heart what if she died before I got
[1:26:40] home what if I got killed on this road
[1:26:42] out here and I didn't get to see her
[1:26:44] ever again he spun that car around he
[1:26:46] drove and he said she was hiding behind
[1:26:47] the door holding her face like this with
[1:26:50] tears coming down her eyes he said he
[1:26:52] said he reached over and got her and he
[1:26:53] repented and said I'm sorry he kissed
[1:26:56] her and she kissed him he got in the
[1:26:57] driveway he waved and she waved and
[1:26:59] around the corner he went he said it was
[1:27:01] all different why he said the second
[1:27:03] time had real feeling in it the first
[1:27:06] time was just because it was a
[1:27:10] tradition come on
[1:27:12] somebody that's the way God wants us to
[1:27:14] come to church with
[1:27:16] passion with
[1:27:21] excitement
[1:27:23] Hallelujah that's how he wants us to
[1:27:25] sing and play that's how he wants us to
[1:27:27] play the piano that's how he wants us to
[1:27:28] worship that's how he wants us to
[1:27:30] pastors how he wants us to Mother how he
[1:27:31] wants us to be kids teenagers all of it
[1:27:35] with passion for the
[1:27:39] Lord I heard it some time back just a
[1:27:43] little bit a fellow was talking and he
[1:27:46] said he said the Journey To Success is
[1:27:49] Not an airplane flight it's not a direct
[1:27:51] flight he said
[1:27:53] he said ' it's a road trip and he said
[1:27:56] based on what kind of fuel you put in
[1:27:58] your car is going to be how your road
[1:28:00] trip
[1:28:01] goes and he said one of the things that
[1:28:04] a Christian has to fuel
[1:28:06] themsel they have to fuel themself with
[1:28:09] passion if you're not passionate about
[1:28:11] it if you don't care about it if it
[1:28:13] doesn't excite you enthuse you coming to
[1:28:17] church will'll be a kiss and a kiss a
[1:28:19] wave and a wave and around the corner
[1:28:20] you'll go that's good it'll become a
[1:28:23] tradition and the same God that said
[1:28:25] then it was a stink is the same God
[1:28:27] that'll feel the same way

[1:28:31] stink in his
