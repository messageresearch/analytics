TRANSCRIPT
========================================
the live stream okay praise God I want to apologize about the the heat the the inspectors came today or not the inspectors but the workers and they found out uh the Heat's been turned off so there was some miscommunication there's been a some type of miscommunication with dominion and then uh I didn't take it as far as I should have so it's I think it's partly on the technology end and it's partly on my end so I'm sorry about that so we have to open a brand new account and it's going to be open on Monday so we have to get through it one more weekend of cold but we'll probably have service at my house on Sunday my God's great because it's warmer there so um so I apologize that's my fault I call this summer to try to fix it and they didn't have an answer I was I contacted the landlord she didn't have an answer so I just let it go I should not have let it go so forgive me that's my fault that was six months ago but I just got shut off last week so I'm sorry that's my fault and hopefully we'll get it all fixed on Monday by God's grace so thank you for your patience and I trust you had a great time with brother Nathaniel there by God's grace and I don't know if you heard but he's going to be the new pastor at his home Church his dad has been the pastor of 47 years um and so he is his dad is kind of retiring and going into the missionary field which is wonderful now brother Nathaniel is likely going to be voted in on January 1st so I probably won't invite him back too much you know because now he's got to Pastor a big church or they're a little I mean they're quite a bigger Church in our church you know perhaps in the future you know um so again you know that's that's a answer to prayer too you know so uh but Josh had a wonderful time in the Lord uh this weekend so let's take our Bibles here let's go to Psalm chapter 149 verse 3. I'd like to preach again on praise Jesus's name in the dance praise God Psalm 149 verse 3. and just so you're aware you know we're running two space heaters and um you know any time you know it could uh it could pop one of those where they call it when yeah it pops a fuse or yeah breaker yeah trips the breaker whatever they call it um so if that would happen you know we'd I probably sent Austin back there was amen back there you know and um Turned the breaker on again and then we probably have to turn it on low but so far it's been running good we've had it running for about an hour here try to get some heat in here um so you know just just so that may happen so we'll kind of see how that goes Psalm 149 verse 3. again it's nice to have Anthony here let's give him round flaws nice to meet you sir how old are you Anthony you're both 22. all right Prime of life oh you're 23. okay sorry brother that's right it was your birthday I thought you turned 22 on your birthday so God bless you and God bless you Anthony nice to have you and great to have sisters there let's give her round balls God bless you sir [Applause] good to see you Hallelujah you made my day today by coming by God you guys just want to tell you that we're long time friends and it's great to have sisters that are here by the grace of the Lord I baptize their name of the Lord and so grateful for her hallelujah thank you for coming God bless you praise Jesus's name in the dance Hallelujah let's look let's read verse three together if we can here on three one two three let them praise His name in The Dance Let Them sing praises unto him with the timbrel and harp amen may God as blessing zarima's word you may be seated praise God we'll try to preach hopefully about an hour here and if and if you get too cold you'll feel free to move right over there you know then I just want to give the young children the first choice to sit closest to the space heaters because they have a hard time you know maybe handling being cold but most of us you know we had to work outside from Ohio where it used to being cold you know in the winter time and if you're just cold you know rub your hands together and just feel free to love the Lord here tonight we'll switch over I have a few quotes I'd like to share I'd like to preach again on Dancing you know we had a wonderful service last Wednesday night that was just a wonderful service I went back and listened to it again and of course I normally do that to kind of prepare oh and you know catch what the spirit was saying you know try to remember what the spirit was speaking to us and so I'd like to go a little bit further here with uh the scripture and I'm going to show a couple videos Lord winning if we get there I'm going to show a couple of videos uh from the internet so I'll be pulling you know from my data not the church data here uh and we'll just see how that goes by the grace of the Lord because I want to show you some real solid examples you know of what I think could be good dancing and what I think is maybe fleshly or sinful dancing of course we know most sinful dances right but but there's like a gray area in there and so I'm not saying I have all the answers but I just want to show you some examples what I think well this looks holy um and then maybe a couple moves that I think well I personally wouldn't do that move you know unless the Holy Spirit you know anointed me for that you know so God is good you know and we just want to have Liberty the Holy Spirit praise God because if Jesus has Set Me Free I am free indeed amen hallelujah I will not like I said last time last Wednesday I will not let Satan chain me up and make me a fearful sorrowful depressed Christian I'm going to overcome Hallelujah by the grace of God if at all possible I am not going to be a sorrowful sad complaining sour Christian Hallelujah I want to walk by faith I don't want to walk by sight and all of us if we're a Christian Church all of us have a reason to praise the Lord because that means we have faith in Jesus Christ and he has finished the work of Calvary Hallelujah it is not a partial finish work it is a finished work Hallelujah every sin's been paid for amen hallelujah every one of our deaths have been paid Hallelujah and Jesus as far as the Bible says doesn't hold any sin against us anymore praise God that's how I want to live praise God I want to live like the Old Testament where there was always a remembrance of sin always remembers because sin could not be fully confess or I'm sorry sin could not be fully paid for but in this one the Bible says sin is remitted it's sent away it's in the sea of forgetfulness praise God it is no more Hallelujah so we want to rejoice in that Hallelujah if anybody has a a reason to dance it's the Christian praise God hallelujah because we have eternal life and I just want to say God bless to jakora let's give him round flowers God bless you Jakari Hallelujah sir did your dad drop you off okay did he leave yeah okay yeah he's a busy man he's a pastor so he sure love you brother it's good to see you by God's grace hopefully we meet up next week before school and have another meeting there by the grace of the Lord so just you know a real Brief Review you know this was the the Hebrew definition of Dance that's that word kahul I'm not sure how to say it you know I'm not I'm not a Hebrew I don't know how to say it but I took the definition from here A Primitive root so this is a root word uh properly to twist or Twirl in a circular or spiral manner that is to dance of course then it gets into to writhe and pain you know that's not what a dance is a dance isn't painful but you know a Hebrew word can have many different definitions too just like the board right board room or Board of wood or a board of directors there's all I'm bored I'm tired I don't feel like paying attention hopefully that's not how you feel tonight praise God if it is I'm going to try to shake you up a little bit and wake you up here hopefully the music did that too but you know as I was saying last week you know when people dance you know if they spin and whirl or if they're dancing in a circle you know together like we did last week girls do you like that dance girls I appreciate that that was a great dance that's actually what the word means to go in a circular motion you know to dance and praise the Lord that's what it actually means and so that can be done as we saw that can be done uh by Believers uh it could also be done by Sinners right as we saw you know so last week we looked at lots of the scriptures so if you didn't see last Wednesday night's message I went through the majority of New Testament scriptures on Dance not all of them but the majority at the highlights now there was one I didn't get to which was a great one when the prodigal came home uh the Elder son coming from the field he's like I hear music and dancing so that's a good example of when you get saved you should give a dance to Jesus amen thank God Amen you know the dance praise God and when a brother comes home or sister comes home it's a cause for a dance Hallelujah so I'm gonna say this if Chris gets baptized on Saturday we're gonna have a dance time pretty soon praise God hallelujah because a son has come home Hallelujah he ordered he wandered so long far away from his father Hallelujah but he's coming home to Papa amen father God hallelujah amen thank God it's a reality church it's a reality Hallelujah when a sinner is Forgiven the Bible said he's from the he goes from the power of Darkness the power of Satan unto the power of God hallelujah he's changed kingdoms amen hallelujah he's no longer under the Dominion of Satan he's not bound addicted to Satan Satan's lusts and and Satan's sins but now he's free from Satan's power and now he's under the power of the Holy Spirit praise God to live a holy life amen thank God Hallelujah oh what a blessing praise God remember God's Prophet brother Branham he defined dancing as just as having Victory right Victory and then he we talked about two of his experiences one was dancing around a tree out in the wilderness in Canada another one was dancing at a New Year's Eve service praise God where he he just started tapping his foot and pretty soon before somehow he was out on I was he was out on the floor dancing with a little girl you know out there so um he just had to realize well you know wow they've got more Victory than I do praise God I need more victory in my life praise God so it's a beautiful stories there and great testimonies and I'll tell you that gave me a lot of Courage when I found out brother random dance I thought oh I can dance then because what are they going to say the Broadband was wrong when he danced he was right praise God because the Bible's right Hallelujah now see we found out though as we finish it's sin that takes away the dance right that was in the Lamentations you dance when you're happy you're dancing rejoicing but why aren't you why aren't you happy and rejoicing because you let sin in somewhere right Satan can't make you sin God would never make make you sin God doesn't even tempt us to sin we are drawn away by our own lust the Bible says and so our we let we let Satan in and that takes away our joy takes away our Victory and so it takes away our dance takes away our our shout like like the Bible says there should be a shout of the king in the camp there shall be a shout for Jesus in the church amen ah I didn't hear you praise God if not the power of God's gone in your life praise God so we we constantly need to examine ourselves when we lose the victory when we use lose the joy when we lose the rejoicing something's taken it away we've allowed the enemy to take it away so I'm going to focus a little more on that tonight by God's grace now God does allow us to go through seasons of mourning where it's okay if you don't feel joyful it's okay because you're being tested if we're going to have rewards in heaven we got to overcome something right we've got to be tested praise God if we want to have a testimony we got to go through a test first we got to pass a test Hallelujah but ever if God ever lets us go through a seasonal mourning he's letting us go through a season of sadness or Mourning or loss in other words to bring us out of it praise God so we'll know what it feels like praise God and we'll have a restored Life we'll have a restored mind we'll have a new vision praise God A New Perspective praise God we'll be more mature praise God well understand more about God we'll love God more praise God Hallelujah when God brings us out of difficult times and God brings us through and God brings us through the test and and God sees that uh that we're able to overcome he he rewards us praise God the Bible said God rewards them who diligently seek after him the reason people don't have more testimonies or more experiences with God they're too busy seeking worldly things if they sought God more that God would show up in their lives amen hallelujah it's so true for 19 years I was a ranked Sinner and I gave my life to Christ at 19 and since then I've seen nothing but blessings amen a pastor called me up and was asking about you know how I give to the poor overseas and everything I went and told him about all these Financial blessings we got he's like oh my goodness he said but I still can't he said I still can't give like you now that's fine but I said I was raised poor so that's why I give so much I was kind of hoping he'd do what I do but I can't expect everybody to be like me and you know not that there's anything wrong in what he said but I just you know God backs up his word that's one thing God said prove me now that's the only time I could see her right related that's the only time I could see God ever said prove me with finances that's the only thing he ever said prove me with your money he said and I'll pour open the windows of Heaven that's right amen test me with your money and don't watch if I don't open the windows of heaven and pour out blessings praise God now you're going to go through seasons of less of course you're going to be tested with money but hang on hold to God's unchanging hand if there's any hand you should hold on to it's the hand of Christ Hallelujah trust him amen trust him don't be a baby Christian like we said grow up and be a real son or daughter of God hallelujah they're those Faith muscles praise God Hallelujah take God at his word believe the promises right take those take those weights of tests and trials and say God is good God is faithful God said prove me I believe God either God is faithful praise God all things work together for good to them that love the Lord keep working those face muscles yeah it's going to hurt but tomorrow you're going to be stronger amen hallelujah amen make sure you eat a Godly diet too praise God amen it's exactly right remember we closed them by saying when we praise God with the dance We join all creation because right now the Earth is spinning in a dance Hallelujah right now all those little baby calves or all those baby uh those baby goats are out there dancing praising the Lord out there right we get we get chicks in we get chicks in our school every year and they name the chickens like you know Kentucky Fried Chicken or whatever they name them you know silly names but once they get their strength you ought to see them dance around they dance around too praise God puppies dancing around all creation dances and so because they're they're glorifying their creator and that's why we dance because we're glorifying Our Father hallelujah our heavenly father the creator of everything Hallelujah life amen it's exactly right everything he created that's what the Bible says all creation proves that God is the Creator and there'll be no excuses on the day of judgment because all he's got to do is look out there look at look at that plant in the backer look at your hands everything screams Creator Creator undeniable you can't make this we can't make that somebody made it it was God almighty praise God it was my dad amen it was your dad hallelujah amen thank God we ought to join our father in his creation Hallelujah thank the Lord now I want to just bring this quote I read this quote last week it took me about two minutes to fight it remember everybody was waiting for me thank you for waiting for me but I want to read the quote in the in the whole context of it the word itself is spirit so this is this is not spirit this is paper this is the word in paper form but this but the words on here are from the spirit that wrote it it's the spirit in word form and then you see when it's quickened or brought to life so in one of these verses it brought to life the spirit of God goes to work and acts right whether it's healing or salvation or the baptism of the Holy Ghost or Joy or patience Whatever Whenever one of these becomes real and it becomes alive God is now taking this and it's jumping off the pages and God is making this a reality praise God hallelujah he said now look here a thought has to be a thought before it become a word see from thought to word and then when it's a thought that's presented it's a word now this is God's thought that he has placed in the word and then when we receive it from him it becomes a word god revealed to Moses what to do Moses spoke it it happened that it stimulates it gives Joy because it's God's word I think I skipped the line sorry yeah when it really comes from God he said it stimulates it gives Joy because it's God's word and new wine the new wine simulates when it reveals the word then brings Joy beyond measure sometimes that it brings such a joy till you get over flooded God overflow my life Hallelujah that's what I need I don't need an overflow of depression I need an overflow of Joy Hallelujah thank God Hallelujah that we can have it Hallelujah any day of the week Hallelujah when God's joy comes on you sometimes when it becomes so real you get over flooded with it church that's why sometimes a dental service you'll see me cry like a baby I'm snotting out because I think how real this Bible is I think about how many times has God answered my prayer and I'm So Unworthy but yet he's so faithful praise God I just can't contain myself I get so overflooded sometimes hallelujah amen thank God like let me since we're in Psalms go to Psalms 1 18. I don't know if I share this with brother Chris yet but since he's going to be a new believer so brother Chris when I was in second grade I was eight years old my mom was dying of liver cancer it's still uncurable right she's in the hospital she has six kids and she's dying she's gonna live six she's gonna leave six kids Behind her friend woke up in the morning prayed opened her Bible and a voice said and it wasn't the radio it wasn't a phone call it was the voice of the Holy Spirit the holy spirit said go read Psalm 118 verse 17 and go tell Ruby now Ruby's my mom but Chris you want to read that verse 17. my mom's dying she has six months to live that woman was weeping crying praise God Ruby's going to be made well the kids aren't going to be without a a mother she drove to the hospital walked in and told my mom my mom's sitting in the in the she got she got bruises all over her body because of the cancer purple bruises everywhere it looks like it's impossible Glory Hallelujah we know that in the story amen glory and she said Ruby the Holy Spirit told me Psalm 118 verse 17 is your verse and she said I believe it I don't know how long it went but they were doctors said let's have some surgery we'll try to take some of the liver out the night before my dad while she was sleeping my dad went right to that spot on her liver I don't remember where it is and prayed for that and said I rebuked that liver in the I'm sorry rebuke that cancer in the name of Jesus Christ and he said he felt a hot sensation the next day they had cancer they opened my mom or outside the surgery they opened my mom up they couldn't find any cancer and she's never had remission now you tell me does that make that verse pop out to you or not amen my mama spent the rest of her life she's 72 now feeding the poor visiting the sick and God all that she lost in divorce God has paid it back a hundredfold amen hallelujah praise God I was thinking about that last week I had to pay her back from all that you know that I stole from her I thought God paid her back even more like I told you that testimony oh my God you can never outgive God Amen Hallelujah because God keeps receipts amen hallelujah and he's going to give interest as you wait on the Lord he'll renew your strength amen so see that's a sometimes you get so over flooded right you just rejoice and praise God the Bible becomes real so nobody can tell me the Bible doesn't work because it works praise God it might not work all the time because that's because God has different plans for every person every person's not the same everybody's got different battles they got to overcome my mom had to overcome cancer right she's got to overcome divorce praise God but different ones must have other battles to overcome who's got to overcome greed who's got to overcome murder so we're getting some serious ones there who's got to overcome and kidnapping or who's got to overcome all these things somebody's got to overcome it because God has to prove to the devil that God's children will love him no matter what because they know the love of Jesus Christ is a real and alive Hallelujah somebody's got to overcome it praise God needs a witness now I know there's a lot of fanaticism in people carrying on I know sometimes they do it when the music's jumping up and down and everything and I know that goes and I believe that too so everybody recognize that brother Rand believed in jumping around When the Music's going loud and the church said I've seen people in the day when as long as the music's playing everybody was jumping and screaming when the music stopped they stopped see I believe that well that's still all right as far as I'm concerned as long as people lives right but now you start bringing the word which is what I'm bringing right now right that's the thing that actually brings life is the word that brings the joy of simulation of new wine praise God in other words you and I should be the happiest as the word of God is being preached when it becomes a reality to us like when brother Nathaniel's preaching it's just it's right down your alley it's just what you need to hear or I'm preaching it's just what you wanted to hear just what you need to hear that ought to make us overflow that'll give us simulation it ought to give us courage for the next battle Hallelujah amen Hallelujah and that's what it was on Pentecost when the word was Vindicated God always backs up his word amen he's faithful now this is one of the main thoughts I had last week that I thought was inspired by the Holy Spirit what channel is clogged up in our lives if the preaching of the word is not giving us life if we can zone out of preaching or if we can just get tired of preaching something's been clogged up in our minds because the word is what brings life glory in Acts chapter 10 Peter preached a short sermon to Cornelius and the Bible said while Peter preached the word the Holy Ghost fell on them that hurt and praise God oh my that's what really brings life is when people hear the word of God and they receive it and they say Amen praise God that's a reality to me that's stimulating oh thank God Amen Hallelujah so see one of these channels is clogged up because in your soul is a holy thirst it's your decree more agency your thirst for God every soul thirst for God some people just hush it with drugs or hush it with pornography or hush it with sports see they want to see excitement and the Really the soul desires to see God doing something exciting but they hush it with an exciting sports event or something like that they say quiet now no don't thirst for god let's thirst for Steph Curry well let's thirst for uh Michael Jordan's old highlights or something like that which they're fine I mean they might be nice people but it's not eternal life they might give them millions of dollars to charity but that don't get you to heaven we'll get you to heaven is repenting of your sins praise God and changing your life and letting Christ be the ruler and king of your life Hallelujah that's what gets somebody to heaven but see which one of these now in your mind though this is your soul the deepest part of you in your mind though you've got a conscience right wrong memory we have all these memories reasonings reasons why you do things affections are your emotions and Imagination you have these five elements of your mind church and if if we're not careful these get clogged up we get castles or fortresses or strongholds like we gotta we got a memory against somebody that I just can't forgive them because of this memory and that will clog up the worship remember church we got people we got people I'm watching watching our services and they love our gusto the fact that we can just freely praise God you can just shoot your hands up her you can stand up and say amen and we can shout and praise the Lord people are inspired Hallelujah when your channels are open I'll say like this and help it opens up other channels for other people praise God ah in other words God uses you to bless other people so confess all your sin get all your sin out talk to God about it be an open Channel and somebody else's channels will be opened up praise God oh that really helped me when I got that email last week praise God he said I haven't seen a man worship like you I said well that's because the channels are cleaned out I can confess my sins right pray when I got when somebody has something against me I don't usually go talk to them I go talk to God about them first right I don't like confrontation yeah I don't like confrontation so much if someone if I know somebody's got something against me I'll go talk to somebody about it God that's what I'm going to talk to about it and God will often bring that scripture if you can't forgive them I can't forgive you Jesus said if you can't forgive somebody else I'm not going to forgive you well guess what I feel about this big then then I can praise God and then I can forgive them Hallelujah then I can live with what they've done for me and like that quote I showed brother Amen brother said if you can't take the knocks and all the discouragements he said you better go back to the cross and reaffirm your commission Hallelujah I praise God you need a fresh visit to Calvary Amen to see look at this one who died he did it innocently he did nothing wrong yet he still forgives we do wrong all the time so we should forgive Hallelujah because we do things wrong all the time Christ was bruised and punished and beaten and bloodied and he didn't deserve it we deserve it he took our place so God help us to have the righteousness of Christ help us to extend forgiveness like we want to be forgiven Hallelujah I say like this we need some open channels praise God let's open our imagination praise God let's open our emotions let's open up our reasoning let's open up our memory our conscious to the holy spirit so can we overflooded with it so he can be over flooded with it praise God and we can experience the joy of the Lord because there's one thing that brings Joy that's the word of God Hallelujah now think about this church when you were a sinner how could we be so freely given over to the devil to dance for him and now we're claiming to be serving the lord and not dance for the god of the universe the Lord Jesus Christ I told you I'm embarrassed I used to I didn't know about uh the message when I was in high school I went to the proms I went to homecomings I went to every dance and I wasn't comfortable but I went out there anyway to dance look like a fool serving Satan but when I came to Jesus that I was scared to lift my hand see how Satan Satan is just such a such a accuser of the Brethren he said oh you're going to be a fanatic if you raise your hand so I just start raising my hands like this and only when somebody else would raise their hands I wouldn't do it by myself right Hallelujah right but then the message comes and the Revelation oh my and I go to churches where it's actually welcome and people actually do that praise God and then the freedom slowly comes Hallelujah the chains are being broken amen hallelujah the chains are being broke up all the inhibitions are being let go of because I realize I'm not living for other people I don't care what other people think necessarily I care what God thinks about me and I know what God thinks about me he loves me amen glory amen he died for me he and my mama cancer he's healed my wife he's healed us he's faithful he's worthy of all praise amen Gloria so we should be completely yielded to Christ in all righteousness not just dancing Scream and Shout but also live a holy life tomorrow Hallelujah now I'm sorry the verses are kind of small but know ye not to whom don't you know that whom you yield yourself servants to obey his servants that ye are to whom you obey so when I would Chew Tobacco or smoke a cigarette or drink alcohol I was choosing to obey Satan whether sin unto death or of obedience unto unrighteousness but see when I choose to shun those things now become a servant to Christ Hallelujah it depends who I yield to it depends who I obey God help us to hear the voice of the Holy Spirit and Obey it tonight but God be thanked see we ought to thank God Amen that you were the Servants of sin but you have obeyed see this is all tied back to obedience amen it's all tied back to Hallelujah hearing the word of God and acting upon the word of God we cannot be hearers only we've got to be doers of the word of God Glory if you're hearing only and the word doesn't affect you something's wrong I went listen to the it is rising of the Sun that brother Adam preached I listened to it it was a blessing now what if I said I'm gonna listen to that and I didn't go listen to it then the word has no effect on me and the church said keep those amens coming okay keep saying Sikkim seek that devil Hallelujah see if I say well well that was a good sermon and I don't do nothing about it something's wrong with me that's the whole purpose of the sermon is to stir up action Hallelujah that's why I love it you know that's when I'll come up here you'll see me come up for a prayer usually when a guest preachers here you know I didn't Sunday because I've been on a victory where Lately by God's grace I've been had a lot of Victory lately Hallelujah I just thought about that but I'll come up here and say oh I haven't gone up early or I'm getting up too late and or I'm going to bed early enough I'm just mindlessly scrolling you know on my phone God forgive me yo but if I come up for prayer I've got to act on that tomorrow I've got to make sure that word isn't ineffective I don't want to hear it in vain I don't want to power this religion I want a religion that changes me praise God Glory after 23 years of serving Christ Church it gets sweeter as the days go by amen oh Hallelujah it does thank you Jesus I learned to trust him more he's more I realize he's even more trustworthy ah he's even more faithful amen he's even more holy amen he's even more good than our thoughts Hallelujah and church somebody says he'll be telling us that through all eternity we'll see how much more glorious how much more holy how much a lot more loving God was all throughout eternity it'll never end because there's no end to our God Amen thank God see you obeyed from the heart what that form of what is that a bad word no that's a good word because you obeyed the doctrine the instruction the teaching that was given that was delivered to you that's how you become a servant to God you obey the word of God that's preached Hallelujah that's how you become more unit to God you have to obey what you hear now that doesn't mean you have to obey everything on day one you have to obey everything on day 365 either praise God but you must be in that channel of Lord I want more of you I'm going to seek more of you I'm going to hear more of the word I want to be stimulated I want to overflow with this I want Victory I'm yielding myself to you praise God Hallelujah being then made free from sin you became the Servants of righteousness see cause I'm free I'm not bound by those dirty magazines anymore I'm not bound by those Sports anymore I'm not bound by drugs anymore I'm not bound by that I'm free from that now I'm a servant to holiness I speak after the man or men because of the infirmity of your flesh see how weak your our bodies are and the church said our bodies are just weak right you have you and your members servants to uncleanness and to iniquity uniniquity see we used to go from worse to worse I thought I'd get a louder one than that we went from worst to worse praise God we went from iniquity to more iniquity oh from something filthy to even more filthy I know I did even so now you'd remember servants unto righteousness unto Holiness become more holy more like Christ more loving the word more devoted to God more in love with Jesus Hallelujah oh Hallelujah that's right like I said last week God give me a reason to dance praise God that's what I'm saying I know I got lots of it but give me some fresh reason that's what I mean give me some fresh reasons to dance I want to see Miracles I want to see Soul save praise God I want to see the spirit of God move and change people's lives Hallelujah thank you Jesus I want to see The Prodigal come home amen Hallelujah I want to see a saint filled with the Holy Ghost praise God where they've got power to be a witness Hallelujah I'm just going to read this again like last week Miriam picked up the tambourine and down the bank she went dancing Hallelujah yes sir she had the victory did you ever get that much did you ever cut that much Church [Laughter] that's a real question right there in other words can you picture yourself right there with Miriam and Moses I can Hallelujah you gotta picture yourself my have I ever had that freedom where I can dance and I can rejoice and I realize that God has taken away all my task Masters I can realize that I my future is secure oh thank God Amen I can realize uh that my past is behind me I'm not going back to my past I've got a future my future's in Christ praise God my future's Freedom amen Glory that's what we need Hallelujah I'm falling all over the place there amen that's my question did you ever get that much praise God Hallelujah hang around you'll get it by God's grace you got to trust the Lord you got to seek God Amen ask seek and knock do those three praise God and you'll have this Hallelujah ask God for it seek God for it spend time seeking it in the word of God and then keep knocking for Lord I'm here I'm waiting Lord I hear send your spirit overflow me praise God over flood me praise God Amen Glory and yield yourself brother Adam says our spirit is clean it's fresh it's real it's sober and serious but not nonetheless it's full of the joy Lord so you can be sober and serious yet joyful serious and joyful at the same time yes the Christian ought to be just as exuberant and full of his pleasure in the Lord as the world is when it Savers and delights in its pleasures Glory I'd be happy to compare my rejoicing last Wednesday to any football game anybody went to last fall because I danced right around this place praise God he had the children come up and dance I was so happy last week praise God I'm so happy this week well in other words I'm just saying I'm a just as exuberant about Jesus Christ as they are about Satan Hallelujah and I ought to be praise God and if not I'm either going through a season of mourning or I let sin in and God help us not to be the one where we let sin into our lives Hallelujah so that's what we I Savor uh times in the presence of the Lord I Delight in the presence of the Lord don't you love those Services where the power of God's moving and you don't feel like leaving the church don't you love those services God's dealing with somebody strengthening we're a rebuke and correcting help and answering prayer don't you love those type of things that should be our pleasure we should Delight in those Services more than anything else praise God Hallelujah both Christians in the world are human both have emotions the difference is Christians hearts and emotions are purely on The Lord Of Glory and his love while the world satisfies the flesh let me share this church sometimes I need a good laugh like some of these guys that do silly videos like we talk about something we show some of the silly videos but there there's got to be an end to that at some point right because I you know I can't give all my Laughing to silly YouTube videos I've got a laugh for Jesus Hallelujah you got to be careful we can't let our emotions go just to the world or things like you know just silliness we got to make sure we make sure stop that at some point and then yield all of our emotions to God right or get back on track yeah we have a little you know comic relief like there's these one guys that do these crazy like they just act like everything with slow motion or everything was fast forward you know cleaning the house fast forward it's funny it's hilarious but I gotta watch how much I get into that I can't get too much into that because then I'll take my mind off the Lord and then I'll train my emotions well you can only have a good time when you're going like you can only laugh when you're going like this see you become you become tied down to this where this is your Source this is not your source Jesus is your source he's my source praise God Hallelujah we got to make sure we got to put more of our emotions on the Lord we've got to put our emotions on the glory of God and his love but the world will always satisfy the flesh the world will always satisfy the flesh that's why you have to starve the flesh that's why you got to fast and that's why you got to give alms because your flesh wants to hold on to everything right your flesh wants to keep everything for you well make sure I got to take care of me no no God's gonna take care of you Hallelujah you're not responsible for yourself God's responsible for you that doesn't mean you give everything away like the Rich Young Ruler we went through that a couple months ago but it's all what God's calling you to do you have to find God's calling for your life praise God and then give your emotions to God give everything to God and have just as much joy in God as the world has in their things oh I'm so glad I can just rejoice in God I can be free in God we can love God we can just have such a sense of security praise God such a sense of Joy I live such a sense that God is with us he'll never leave us he'll never forsake us God Is With Us amen Hallelujah so help us may the Lord help us to make our hearts and emotions solely on the Lord that's what we got to get to of course while you're serving your family yes that counts as the Lord right because the lord gave you the family right lord gave your husband your wife your children father mother God gave you them now if they're not saved it makes it difficult but the Bible says give everything yield everything to God let give God your conscience give God your memories amen give God your reasoning and your affection your imagination give all that to God and watch God pour out blessings upon you it's exactly right that's where you turn yourself that's what you're made for let's not fight against the maker let's not fight against the system right if you put water in your your car it ain't car ain't going to go you're fighting against the system praise God like we heard on Sunday with a mechanics and Dynamics let's put gasoline in the car let's get the mechanics together and let's get the spark going amen let's go with the purpose the purpose of God the Bible says the kingdom of God is not in meat and drink but in peace and joy and loving the Holy Ghost amen that's what the kingdom of God is joy in the Holy Ghost praise God let me read that I think that's Romans 5 if I'm not mistaken I better look it up while I'm turning there the kingdom is not in meat and drink but joy Just Gotta Type in meat drink and joy ah it's Romans 14. it's a good thing I looked it up something's kind of said maybe it's not Romans 14s Romans 14 17. of course this is the chapter on Christian Liberties right like we looked at with Christmas and things like that any celebration you know her brother Ram say uh that Christmas is a cell I mean Easter is a celebration so people say oh you shouldn't celebrate Christmas you shouldn't celebrate Easter brother Brown said he was celebrating Easter right in other words he's worshiping at Easter time some people are just way too critical may God help us see church then that gives us compassion they've got a critical spirit so God help us to have a humble spirit if we get salty what are they going to get thirsty if they're sincere if they're thirsty I'm sorry yeah if we're we're salty they'll get thirsty if they're sincere if they really want to know God they'll get they'll get thirsty for sure Hallelujah I've seen the church I've won people over they've they've fought against me they haven't liked my side but pretty soon they come to the light that the word is Right praise God Amen thank God you're standing in the word of God so what is the kingdom of God brother Jesse verse 17. well let's read verse 16. let not your good be evil spoken of if you're doing good don't let evil be spoken of stand up for the truth I have this Liberty I have this right I'm a Christian don't be ashamed if you're doing right Hallelujah that's why I made that video four reasons I don't put up a Christmas tree but I'm not ashamed that I give gifts to my kids I'm not ashamed of that I'm not ashamed of seeing uh hymns about Jesus birth I'm not ashamed of that without the birth there could be no death right and the angels Glory even the angels come down from heaven at the birthday even the angels saying hallelujah even they got over flooded even angels worship glory to God in the highest amen peace on Earth Good Will towards man amen if angels Rejoice why can't I Hallelujah angels to having sin Church the real ones the only ones haven't sinned that's free for you that was in my notes there verse 17 for the kingdom of God is Not meat and drink it's not these carnal things it's spiritual but the kingdom of God is righteousness peace and joy in the Holy Ghost Kingdom means Dominion everybody say Dominion right that means rule the Holy Ghost is the Holy Ghost ruling you through those things righteousness joy and peace how many peace in their life how many joy in their life that's the stimulation Revelation right there hallelujah how many how many peace in their lives and how many joy in their lives I haven't said all three I'm trying to say all three that is what the kingdom is that's the Dominion the Holy Ghost is trying to rule your life the Holy Ghost is trying to rule my life not with meat and drink so much but with righteousness peace and joy of the Lord did you hear on when we were closing on Sunday night we sang joy in the house of the Lord and brother Nathaniel's going whoa whoa whoa did you hear that I was like I'm about ready because I was dancing up here praise God but I was really tired so I didn't answer out I was kind of tired I knew I'd probably do it tonight Hallelujah there's something about that church you start talking about George I'm about God talking about how good he's been to you something inside he has to respond and say yes that's right I will praise the Lord amen he's been so good to me let's not satisfy the flesh let's satisfy the spirit of God now this is I it's been a while since I read this we're not going to read all of it but Hezekiah said this prayer after he got healed remember Isaiah said thus saith the Lord set your house in order you shall die he walked out the Lord said no well she says no he said thus saith the Lord go tell him he's got 15 more years so he said be outside of verse 17 behold for peace I had great bitterness so see when he heard that when he heard that uh word of Lord he's going to die he was bitter but thou Hast in love to my soul delivered it from the pit of corruption for thou has cast all my sins behind thy back that means God's not God's not staring at your sins well Jesse did that amen did that Austin did that bang did that Malachi use all the brothers Chris did that you know it's not right in front of him oh I know he's I'm so upset with him but God is gracious and God put all those behind his back Hallelujah amen that means God don't look at my he's not looking at my sins he's looking at my seed he's looking at my soul he's looking at my very inner depths of me he's looking at my genetic makeup my spiritual Gene the seed word of God Amen for the grave cannot praise you look what he's here now we know why he's crying out to God he says if I die I can't praise you sound like this man like to praise Hallelujah death cannot celebrate thee they either go down the pit cannot hope for thy truth now of course that was in the Old Testament now the New Testament there's victory over there praise God Hallelujah the living the living He Shall praise thee as I do this day the father to the children shall make known thy truth in other words I'm going to make sure before I die I teach my children the truth Hallelujah and I'm going to praise God while I got a life here well I got breath here it's my time to praise God hallelujah amen thank God the Lord was ready to save me Church he's ready to save you too from sins from addictions whatever it is the Lord is ready praise God in his time and season praise God he's ready to save now like the Bible said that song says he's mighty to save praise God the mighty conqueror the Mighty God the Everlasting father therefore because he's ready to save me look at this we'll sing my songs to the string instruments all the days of our life in the house of the Lord I wonder how look he's going he's got the same heart as Hannah said if you give me this son I'll give him back to you that meant over in other words the rest of my life I'll live without him because you gave me one look at that he says the same thing if you heal me I'll praise you the rest of my life amen ah in other words you got 15 years of song and joy and praising the Lord you got 15 years of Celebration and worship coming Lord if you touch me I'll get about that I'll give that to you let me Praise You In the land of the living praise God Hallelujah look at that vowel so just like Hannah now we see Hezekiah made a vow to God too if you do this I will praise you I'll celebrate you all the days of my life and church even without a vow we ought to do that for God praise God because like I said he's worthy of it if we could just you know program said that other people have said it if we if we even got a glimpse of the reality of hell it would scare us so much we would we would just you know be even even more sincere even more sincere if we had a vision of it or experience it or something like that now the church the Reason God don't have to do that to us because he knows we're already going to fear Him we've got the fear of the Lord there it is amen thank God the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom Hallelujah the people that don't fear the lord sometimes they need dreams of hell right they need dreams about dying going to hell I had somebody tell me that this week they had a dream about going to hell I forget who I forget who it was somebody told me that I dream about that I said you know what to do that oh yes a brother emailed me from overseas you had a dream he went to hell I said brother I said you better first confess your sins right go make everything right anyone you know wrong make it right I said don't wait till tomorrow do it today because God could be warning you do it now don't put it off I said because I don't know I'm not God but why would God give such a powerful dream like that such a warning because there's probably something late in his life but seizures that's God's mercy too look how merciful god is before a judgment or before something God always sends Mercy always sends Mercy Hallelujah thank God for his Mercy so Church remember if you want to answer to prayer if you want something be sure to give God praise if you get it Hallelujah like those 10 lepers make sure you're the one that comes back amen thank God Amen Lord I'm not going to be silent I'm not going to forget to give you praise I will worship your name I will sing the praise of Jesus I will tell others about Jesus I'll magnify Christ all the days of my life praise God Amen now I'm gonna read a quote here now when they got down to Jordan time to cross over he made the way speaking of uh this is Elijah and Elisha the stage of the Holy Ghost Church said now I want to ask you something so what do you want that's what Elijah said and Elijah said a double portion of your spirit come upon me that's the way to ask for it don't be scared ask for the whole lot Jesus said you have not because you ask not ask not because you believe not ask abundantly that your Joys might be full ask a whole lot God just don't make me a little bit better make me all the way well Hallelujah amen don't just let me have enough religion to make myself miserable like I was saying earlier God didn't save us for us to be miserable God didn't save me to walk me in here every day say sing me to happiness brother amen preach me to happiness brother Jesse God should already made you happy if you were to talk to him today amen you got to talk to him every day praise God hallelujah I had my prayer time I got up at 4 30 this morning about time I said Lord Jesus this is your my time together this is our time I prayed for Jose I prayed for different ones in our church that were sick Beverly this is our time this is your my time if you want to tell me I'm your son you're my father tell me now I'm in prayer praise God Hallelujah don't let me have enough religion just to be a miserable message believer don't make me like that Glory I like this next statement kill me out to sin is that even a sentence search does that even make sense like is that right grammar no kill me out to sin that I can live in Christ but we all know what he's saying hallelujah thank God Hallelujah I got bad grammar oh God bad grammar none of us are grammatarians maybe lady might be but hallelujah praise God bless her for that too but it doesn't matter we understand what the spirit's saying help me to die out to all my sins so Christ can live in me praise God take all my desires for sin out so I can be a real Christian praise God and then I'll be happy as a Christian praise the Lord I don't want to just be a miserable Church attendance right I don't want to be a miserable Pew warmer I don't want to be a miserable preacher in the pulpit I want to be a happy preacher in the pulpit only a joyful Christian praise God don't make me so I can step back to maybe bow my head once a while so I'll step back from the church don't make me like that don't make me a sour person he said make me so I can Shout hallelujah hallelujah church we don't have to go to Revival services to have Revival we can have Revival tonight you just gotta let God throw through folks through your channels raise God Hallelujah they don't have to be that way Lord I don't want to be miserable I don't want to be this well every now and then once once a sermon I can lift my hand say hallelujah I don't want to be that praise God ought to be somebody that loves God Amen give my whole life to Jesus Hallelujah you're my all my emotions praise God I want all my emotions Worship in Christ Jesus our lord amen that includes my feet too hallelujah amen thank God make me so I can open my mouth and sing and Screen the Praises of God Hallelujah give me the whole thing amen give me all the Holy Ghost I can get praise God don't give me a little portion give me all of it praise God if I'm not ashamed I'm not miserable I'm not bringing people down when I talk to them I'm lifting them up when I'm not talking about let me not be somebody that drags you down oh you want to feel sorry for me too and uh let me be some of that race God is faithful let me raise you up here just keep trust in the Lord amen thank God Amen let me have the baptism here it is kill me to the things of the world where peoples around me when I go to church let me worship you that's right no matter what anybody else thinks just kill me out that's what we need tonight is a Jordan experience is that right many of us was like the school of prophets stand over on the other side of the Hill looking off Let's cross the river tonight oh Hallelujah that's easy to preach that's easy to say Amen to now how many of us really want that though that's the way it really meets the that's where the rubber meets the road like the brother said what word are we going to take and let it Quicken us and Inspire us like we heard and put a spark to the mechanics and Dynamics something something has to move us praise God Hallelujah it takes an action so this is a different sermon this is one of the most beautiful sermons remember I preached on the soul this has I got so many Revelations out of this sermon this was an unbelievable sermon it totally changed my whole outlook on the soul but man they're singing at the end brother man says when they crown him Lord of all oh when they crown him Lord of all oh Lord I want to be in that number when the sun refused to shine but remember says do you love that now I wonder if you got your feet converted you don't dance anymore out there for the world see let's Pat our feet to the Lord to the Lord brother says when you're a sinner you dance for the devil but when you become a Christian you start using your feet for Jesus hallelujah oh thank you Jesus ah now we don't have a lot of room in here to dance so we can just go back and forth hallelujah thank you Lord thank you Jesus glory amen did your feet get saved or not praise God now your feet really didn't but your soul says feet I command my feet to praise the Lord amen thank God Amen yes as your hands can burn you don't steal any more that's what I was guilty of I stole so many things from Walmart you name it all kinds of places but see when I got converted I don't steal anymore now I clap my hands now I take these hands everyone's dirty now they're clean now I give to the people now I give to others when I used to steal from others he changed my life he wants to change yours too your lips are converted you don't lie anymore just don't get religion in your head Saints get it all over you that's it it takes the whole man that's right now let's Pat our feet and they sing a different song they sing that again Steve church this is a reality if you get saved if something starts happening here it's got to work its way out to the outside it's got to work its way out because something has changed on the inside Hallelujah and the only way it doesn't is if something gets clogged up up here well I'm imagining they're going to say that and I can't the reason I can't do that is because of that and I remember when the brothers of that or sister said that so I can't praise God like I want to let clean it out Church let's clean it out praise God bend it out God's if Jesus died like that he's worthy of all of our praise Hallelujah I didn't I'm not really getting far like I thought I'd get tonight praise God anyhow now this is the entry from the Bible dictionary I thought you'd like it uh now here's all the verses on dancing and it says the translation of whole in the Hebrew which points to the word whirling motion of Oriental sacred dances it's the rendering of a word which means to skip or leap for joy so skip right skip is this skipping or Galloping is that oh no that's right this is Skipper I'm trying to go back to my Elementary uh PE classes okay now this is skipping and this is gallop foreign so you can skip all over the church and praise the Lord Hallelujah or you can leave for joy the Bible commands us to do it amen let them praise His name in the dance amen hallelujah thank God that talks about New Testament uh also means like a circular motion that's when the The Prodigal came home they were leaping and dancing uh it's symbolic of rejoicing we know that they had sacred dances of joint Thanksgiving and the performers were usually female so usually the dancers were females because the Bible never said Moses dance Miriam led the sisters out and danced so I'm one of those rare types like David I guess that's fine Hallelujah I want to be a man after God's Own heart anyway Hallelujah now every all the most men like to dance too if they're really Christian they love the Lord the ancient dance was very different from the common Western Nations isn't that the truth I actually got a couple amens on that one here the western dance American dance which is hell hell dance right dances from the pits of Hell demon dances it was usually the part of the women only and then talks about David again and we went through that last week now here's the thing I like this is like what brother William told me uh the male and female among the Jews always dance separately and that's good so that men aren't tempted right because that's what men have to battle that all right now there's three kinds of Hebrew dancing the horror I'm not probably not saying these right courses from Wikipedia but they have references I know most Wikipedia you can't trust it you can't trust hardly most anything right the Britannica says Constantine was a good guy he was a rascal right I mean who are you going to trust I mean you're gonna trust MSNBC you're gonna trust Fox News come on yeah you're gonna just see it yeah right exactly right that's why we're all laughing they just lie to us oh covet oh mascara and protect you three months later Mass don't help you it's just ridiculous it's all propaganda to get you to give up your rights right because they want to lay down the mark of the beast worldwide that's what they want to do but there's first a circle dance that's kind of what we did last week girls Circle dance the second one is just hopping in place so praise the Lord that little hops that they do hallelujah praise the Lord that but then there's a spontaneous that's my definition I just call it spontaneous because we don't know what David was doing but whatever he did church he did it with all of his might Hallelujah and he wasn't doing it to glorify himself like oh let's have a dance let's have a dance off let's have a dance competition that wasn't what David was doing the Bible said he was before the Lord thank you that the prince of God is returning to its rightful place oh church when the god when we get another Revival in here praise God the prince of God coming back to this place we should be dancing all around praise God Hallelujah because the prince of God is coming back to the people it's right back in his position he's going to say like this this is where the prince of God should be amen hallelujah amen so Dave when he saw it coming back oh hallelujah we're in Melchizedek City amen this is where Melchizedek came this is where God visited and now the prince of God is back we're back to the days where God would speak to man we're going to hear from God and so long you're hearing deadness or science but we get to hear the voice of God that'll make a man dance Hallelujah when he hears the voice of God it makes a man or woman dance Hallelujah thank you Jesus it's already been an hour so bear with me let me see how much I got left I might have to hold this off here in the next week I still got to work tomorrow oh boy I gotta hold on here one two three four five six seven eight okay bye-bye 18 here let me uh I'll close with this little section here just just a simple section we'll close with this and then I'll pick up again Lord buddy oh that's right I want to show you those videos too okay I forgot about that all right uh yeah I'll go through this section and I'll show the videos okay by God's grace we'll turn that off on the YouTube because they're probably gonna strike me for using somebody else's videos and then we'll be off YouTube for 90 days or something like that ridiculous I'm not trying to make money off of these people are ridiculous dancing's Place among the Holy Ghost Field Saints praise God now remember uh let's remember the the evidence of the Holy Ghost is not dancing I've seen lots of people dance like I said last week I've seen a brother he ran around a message Church like a cheetah a couple years later he don't even believe the message anymore he was actually raised Amish he come he came out of the Amish community that's really something they were so locked up but he found so much freedom in The Messengers he would run around the church I could just see him right now he's running around here hallelujah he'd have his hands up praise the Lord I'm trying not to trip over these he's running around I mean he'd go around and around and around I thought this guy's really on fire praise God hallelujah but then he married a nominational woman now there's nothing wrong with that if God's leading it but the woman Drew him away from the message that's how you know you married the wrong person right if they lead you away from the word of God but if God leads you in that you're trying to save somebody now that's different praise God hallelujah thank God so dancing is not the evidence Norris tongues Norris Miracles nor is my mom being healed of cancer be in here to cancer is not the evidence of the Holy Ghost the evidence of the Holy Ghost is what Jesus said it's power to be a witness amen and he said when you receive that it'll guide you into all truth amen Hallelujah it will remind you of Everything Jesus said and it will show you things that are to come amen Hallelujah I just want to show that balance on that how many times did Paul write about dancing I can't find one I can't find one if I'm not mistaken yet he was a holy ghost film man right so we got to be careful I don't want to over emphasize dancing but also I don't want you to have channels that are clogged up Hallelujah like those Miserable quotes that's why I brought those out God did not save you for you to be miserable God save you to be light Hallelujah God didn't save you to be Darkness God save you to be light God didn't save you to be lacking salt God made you to be real salt to have Savor God didn't make you to be plain and Bland God made you to have saver so the people can see something different about you Hallelujah we know if you are going to be saved don't expect brother Chris I expect ever to be saved when I come in this message boy was I wrong but one thing I knew I was saved and they don't want to be saying they don't have to but I know I got saved hallelujah amen the old Jesse Dunn and I knew Jesse was raised up Hallelujah I've never been the same Hallelujah Glory thank you Jesus so I knew as long as it happened to me as long as I got the experience I know it's real Hallelujah has never failed to keep me walking for the Lord Jesus Christ this power of salvation so we want a real experience with God Hallelujah but the RAM said jump as high as you can live right however high if you can if you can live over smoking I jump this high right if I can live over over dirty magazines I could jump that high right if I can live over gossip in life then I can jump real high praise God Hallelujah tell the kids like that I'm just like David you just give God all your might only jump as high as you live Hallelujah amen some of these preachers out there dance or they dance around and Shout around and they find out they're living sinful in their private lives shame on them they were jumping higher than what they lived only jump as high as you live Hallelujah the trouble is they don't yield all their courts right they don't yield their soul their Spirit or their body all the way they've got to yield all the way to the Lord Jesus Christ I'm trying to close here I better I better hold this up here yeah let's close it uh this goes with these two okay now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord is there's what there's liberty look you got Liberty now Liberty means this true Liberty is living as we ought and not as we please so true Liberty is living and obeying God's commands that's being really on Liberty I'm in Liberty I'm living how God wants me to live I'm free from my sin I'm free from addiction right that's Liberty I have a license to do as one pleases ah I have a license to do what I really want to do I really want to serve God hallelujah that's Liberty but look if you got Liberty Church look at this then you are we all with an open face beholding as a glass in the glory of the Lord our change into the same image from glory to glory even by the spirit of God in other words if you really got Liberty you're looking into God's mirror and it is changing you to look just like it right you look into the word oh that's right that's why you read your Bible every day right that's why you pray Lord I want to be like that I want to see that my life I want to see Miracles I want to see healings I want to see salvation I want to see peace oh I want to see righteousness I want to see Joy praise God I want to become that and the Bible says if you have Liberty then you will become that praise God you become the word of God as you look into it just like any old book right you look into a porn book you're going to turn into a porn star you put your book in a doctor book you're gonna turn into a doctor huh put yourself I'd put myself in the Playbook when I played I played Akron Universe I played football at Akron University I play with some former superstars in the NFL I was never good though not that good but I just tell you the Playbook when I say the Playbook I become the Playbook right you put your face in this book you become God's book you become God's image you become God's servant your change from Glory unto Glory oh Hallelujah church I know it's all about when I first come the message I can only handle so much Glory I only understood water baptism but as time goes on I can handle more Glory oh sanctification baptism Holy Ghost Seven Seals I can just handle so much more Glory Hallelujah dancing before the Lord I can handle that amen because we go from glory to glory to more Glory because we stare in the word of God and we become the word of God we become the prophecy that's written about us that's what I mean we become the Bride of the last days wherefore be not unwise but understanding what the will of the Lord is be not drunk with wine which is excess but be filled with the spirit speaking to yourselves in Psalms so here again this is these are clear signs you're walking in obedience to the spirit you're talking to one another about songs and hymns and spiritual songs singing now in your free time I'll say less in your time where it's just you and God you don't have your cell phone there all the time right or your iPad or your whatever iMac whatever you got Aces in those times when you're just by yourself you're singing and making melody in your heart to the Lord there's joy in the house of the Lord there's joy in the house or are we worried
