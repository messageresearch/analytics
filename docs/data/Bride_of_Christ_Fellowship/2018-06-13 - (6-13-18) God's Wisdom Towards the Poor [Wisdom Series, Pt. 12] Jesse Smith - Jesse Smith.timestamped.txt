[40:49] meats and food and just dropped him on
[40:51] our our kitchen and my wife just started
[40:53] crying you know I just it's just God's
[40:55] amazing grace church you know God is so
[40:59] merciful and I just you know just tell
[41:00] you got to encourage you thank you for
[41:02] your kindness and anything we do for the
[41:05] Lord he's watching and you know he'll
[41:07] he'll pay us back you know and we
[41:08] thought that that's not why we do it we
[41:10] do it you know we give to others to be
[41:12] like Christ because we care about others
[41:14] we love others but then God rewards us
[41:16] you know so it's just God's mercy and
[41:19] love so you know our hearts are really
[41:21] full really blessed right now and we're
[41:24] just thankful for all that God has done
[41:26] and thank you for all your love to us
[41:28] amen we certainly love everybody by the
[41:30] grace of Lord let's look at this wisdom
[41:33] towards the poor I like to look at that
[41:35] thought dear tonight you know as I said
[41:38] I was I'm reading now this is my second
[41:39] time in a row through Proverbs I just
[41:41] keep seeing these thoughts about poor
[41:43] and rich and revenue and and so I like
[41:46] to just preach on that tonight I got
[41:48] about 70 slides so there's I'll have a
[41:50] lot of scripture up here so we don't
[41:52] have to do much turn and I think maybe a
[41:54] couple times we'll turn in your Bible
[41:55] but I got a lot of scripture just I had
[41:57] plenty of time I'm on summer vacation I
[41:59] love it I'm having a great time and just
[42:02] enjoying the family and enjoying
[42:05] studying and praying more and and
[42:06] playing time to study so I'm thankful
[42:09] for that so I want to start with this
[42:12] thought as we got our text the Lord
[42:15] makes rich and poor I was kind of
[42:18] dealing with this a few weeks ago you
[42:19] know just saying how it's God determines
[42:21] many times God determines our position
[42:24] in life you know saying you know you
[42:27] know you know even about our church you
[42:29] know God made want us to be a small
[42:31] church forever you know or at least for
[42:32] on our lifetime if God wants us to be a
[42:35] big church but he'll take care of it and
[42:38] you know same thing now applies here to
[42:39] our own finances you know the Bible says
[42:42] that it's God who makes us rich or poor
[42:45] now this
[42:47] actually the first time it's mentioned
[42:48] is Hannah's prayer in First Samuel
[42:50] Chapter two she's praying and thanking
[42:52] the Lord for giving her a Samuel the
[42:56] Prophet and she's just praying and
[42:59] saying the Lord makes poor and maketh
[43:01] rich he bringeth low and he lifts it up
[43:04] so Hanna had been lifted up by God amen
[43:07] God it allowed her to be down for a
[43:09] while and to feel we'd say poor in
[43:12] spirit you know not really financially
[43:13] remember she was the best treated of of
[43:15] her of her of her husband's wives and
[43:18] concubines she was the best treated but
[43:21] she in her Thanksgiving prayer she was
[43:24] just saying how Lord you make all these
[43:26] things you're the one who determines my
[43:28] position in life and you make poor you
[43:31] make rich you make you bring low and you
[43:33] lift up so God is ordering all of our
[43:36] footsteps amen as we walk in obedience
[43:38] praise the Lord now we know there's of
[43:40] course you can we can always choose the
[43:42] perfect will of God or the permissive
[43:44] will of God but we know even brother
[43:46] Branham said God will use the permissive
[43:48] will and he'll bring it back to the
[43:49] perfect will as with Jonah amen
[43:52] he may have stepped out he left the
[43:53] presence of the Lord and mother and said
[43:55] you know many everybody gets down on him
[43:57] but but what happened it had to be that
[43:59] way God knew he would choose that path
[44:00] because he had to come through the whale
[44:02] and the heathens the Ninevites had to
[44:05] see him come out of a whale of their own
[44:07] fish God you know so God it makes
[44:09] everything work out all right but we
[44:12] should strive to never step out of the
[44:14] presence of God amen we should strive to
[44:16] live in His divine presence amen now we
[44:20] repeated this this was our text here
[44:22] again a good name is better than riches
[44:24] loving favor than silver gold and the
[44:27] rich and poor meet together the Lord is
[44:30] the maker of them both you know God does
[44:33] that will look at some scriptures later
[44:34] on you know God in the church God will
[44:36] have rich people and poor people in the
[44:38] same church and we must the Bible said
[44:41] we must treat each other all the same by
[44:43] God's grace and so we'll look at that in
[44:45] the book of James it speaks of that but
[44:48] it's God who is directing these things
[44:50] and of course there's consequences we'll
[44:52] get to that as well what I did is I went
[44:54] through every scripture I could find on
[44:55] the poor and the rich and the wealthy
[44:57] and revenue and money anything I could
[44:59] find in Proverbs about
[45:00] topic I wouldn't look at the poor and
[45:03] how God has a hata to toward the poor
[45:06] now I want to just jump ahead though to
[45:08] Cleese yesyes five verse 18 it says
[45:09] behold that which I have seen it is good
[45:12] and calmly for one to eat and drink and
[45:14] enjoy the good of Oz labor then he
[45:16] taketh Under the Sun all the days of his
[45:18] life which God giveth him for it is his
[45:22] portion amen
[45:23] every man also to whom God hath given
[45:25] riches and wealth and given him power to
[45:28] eat thereof and to take his portion and
[45:31] to rejoice in his labour this is the
[45:34] gift of God amen for he shall not much
[45:37] remember the days of his life because
[45:39] God answered him in the joy of his heart
[45:43] amen
[45:44] so the the Solomon the rider is telling
[45:47] us that we should enjoy just the daily
[45:49] blessings of life it's kind of hot in
[45:52] here maokai can you turn on the air and
[45:54] set it to 60 64 okay 64 not too low cuz
[45:58] it it's really hard on the through the
[46:01] heart on the furnace and the air cooling
[46:02] when when did we do that so just set it
[46:04] on 64 buddy but Solomon is saying you
[46:09] know he watched Solomon observed all
[46:11] these men and all of his kingdom for all
[46:12] these years and and he observed its best
[46:15] when we when we enjoy everything about
[46:17] our lives we shouldn't feel bad you know
[46:20] if God's giving us food or money or what
[46:23] God's given us we shouldn't feel bad
[46:25] about that we should enjoy it we should
[46:27] thank God for it
[46:28] amen because it's not it's God that gave
[46:31] it unto us the Bible says and God has
[46:34] done this not just to some men but to
[46:36] every man everyone that God has given
[46:38] this ability to should enjoy it
[46:41] amen because God answers him in the joy
[46:45] of his heart so God wants us to feel joy
[46:47] in every life situation praise the Lord
[46:50] you should enjoy coming to church on
[46:52] Wednesday night we should enjoy coming
[46:55] to church on Sunday morning Sunday night
[46:57] or a prayer meeting or whatever we're
[46:59] wherever we're at we should have joined
[47:00] her heart God wants us to enjoy the
[47:02] moment praise God now I want to look at
[47:06] this thought as we saw earlier it's
[47:08] always better to live godly than to have
[47:13] more money
[47:14] better is the little with the righteous
[47:16] then great revenues without right god
[47:22] says we're better off it's better off to
[47:24] have just a little and just barely
[47:26] getting by it's better to have that then
[47:30] not have righteousness better is the
[47:34] poor that walketh in his integrity then
[47:38] he that is perverse and his lips and as
[47:40] a fool so it's better we've got to honey
[47:44] trust God tonight it's better to have a
[47:47] little and have righteousness than to
[47:48] have so much and not have righteousness
[47:51] it's better to be poor and walk in
[47:53] integrity than to have perverse lips and
[47:56] be a fool see the Bible the book of
[48:00] Proverbs keeps echoing these same
[48:02] thoughts and adding a little more each
[48:03] time better is the poor that walketh in
[48:06] his uprightness then he that is perverse
[48:08] in his ways though he be rich amen God
[48:12] said we're better off to be poor and
[48:15] walking uprightness than to be a rich
[48:17] wealthy man or woman again it keeps
[48:20] saying this the desire of a man is is
[48:23] kindness and a poor man is better than a
[48:26] liar glory amen it'd be better to have a
[48:31] poor friend than a rich liar a good name
[48:34] is rather to be chosen us as our text
[48:36] than great riches and loving favor
[48:39] rather than silver goal to be better to
[48:41] be known for my that person's really
[48:42] honest than to be that person's really
[48:44] rich it's better to have a good name all
[48:46] the Smith name is a good name or or you
[48:49] put your last name in there that's a
[48:50] good name those are good people it's a
[48:54] good thing to do that have this good
[48:56] name Ecclesiastes says it again better
[48:59] is a poor and a wise child then an old
[49:04] and foolish King now who's the old and
[49:06] foolish King Solomon is right because
[49:09] he's writing this he's writing this at
[49:11] the end of his life he remember he tried
[49:13] all these things he tried women he tried
[49:15] wine he tried all he tried building he's
[49:17] tried wealth he said all these things
[49:19] are vanity right so he's saying it's
[49:22] better to be a poor and a wise child
[49:25] than an old and foolish king who will no
[49:27] more be in my
[49:29] four out of prison he cometh the rain so
[49:32] at least this poor child who's wise will
[49:34] come to rain at least he has a future
[49:36] because he's wise
[49:38] whereas also he that is born in his
[49:40] kingdom
[49:41] B cometh poor Amen so a foolish King
[49:45] will produce poverty eventually because
[49:49] he's not wise with the resources God has
[49:51] given him look at proverbs 19 14 houses
[49:55] of riches are the inheritance of
[49:57] father's and a prudent wife is from the
[50:00] Lord so again remember God makes poor
[50:03] God makes rich so some people are just
[50:05] born into wealth right some people just
[50:08] had rich parents and so that's the way
[50:10] God allows them to be raised that's the
[50:13] experience God gives them they just
[50:15] always had lots of money I'm not in that
[50:17] boat I don't know if you are not but
[50:20] some people haven't by inheritance their
[50:23] parents just have all kinds of money and
[50:25] they can just help them out through life
[50:26] but either way we have a great Heavenly
[50:29] Father will take care of all of his
[50:31] children praise God I do have a rich
[50:33] inheritance amen it might not be money
[50:35] but it's God's grace amen it's God's
[50:38] love hallelujah
[50:41] Solomon says it again there's one alone
[50:44] and there is not a second so let's look
[50:46] at a man who's all by himself but he's
[50:48] rich yeah he hath neither a child nor
[50:50] brother so a man who's never had a child
[50:53] and he has no brothers he's an only
[50:55] child yet is there no end of all his
[50:57] labor yet he's still working so see we
[50:59] think we're so busy right oh I'm so I
[51:01] got seven kids I'm so busy well I've got
[51:04] this and that I'm so busy but look the
[51:06] Bible says even a man without kids
[51:08] without any family he's still busy all
[51:10] the time he's still working all the time
[51:12] we're all going to work all the time
[51:13] that's the command of God God gave that
[51:15] to Adam in the beginning before there
[51:17] was even Sid our lives are gonna be
[51:19] filled with labor it depends on the
[51:20] attitude that we put forth throughout
[51:22] our day now look what it says he has no
[51:25] end easy don't have any children you
[51:26] don't have any siblings or any family
[51:28] and yet there's no end of his work
[51:31] neither is his I satisfy with riches all
[51:35] he has to do is take care of himself you
[51:37] don't have to put any food on the table
[51:38] to provide for the children you have to
[51:40] pay insurance for the
[51:42] or do anything like that he has nothing
[51:44] to do with that but yet he's still not
[51:46] satisfied with riches neither saith he
[51:50] for whom do I labor and bereaved my soul
[51:53] for good this is also vanity a the
[51:56] source or travail so Solomon saw that
[52:00] the man who has to take care of no one
[52:02] he's still not happy with all the wealth
[52:04] because wealth won't make you happy Amen
[52:07] how many celebrities have committed
[52:08] suicide in the last year I think we had
[52:10] like three in the last week or something
[52:12] like that have all the money all the
[52:14] riches all the big Instagram accounts
[52:16] you know all the likes on Facebook they
[52:19] have as much as you want but it proves
[52:21] that money does not bring happiness the
[52:24] Bible actually says giving to the poor
[52:26] will make you happy so one of these
[52:30] people ever gave to the poor I wonder
[52:31] how much they gave to the poor because
[52:33] the Bible said it will make you happy
[52:34] how many know God's Word never fails
[52:36] so see you Solomon observe this you know
[52:39] you can have lots of children and you
[52:41] can just work all the time or you can
[52:42] have no children you're still work all
[52:43] the time and you're still not satisfied
[52:45] with money because money does not
[52:47] satisfy please ask these 911 I returned
[52:51] and saw Under the Sun that the race is
[52:53] not to the Swift nor the battle to the
[52:56] strong nor yet bread to the wise
[52:59] nor yet riches to men of understanding
[53:02] so men that are smart don't always get
[53:04] rich nor yet favor to men of skill but
[53:08] time and chance happeneth to them all
[53:10] now we know God's not rolling a dice up
[53:12] there like wow I'll see how Jesse's life
[53:14] turns out you know well he will he pass
[53:16] go like he's not like a doing a Monopoly
[53:18] board I wonder how he he's not doing
[53:20] that God is purposing everything that I
[53:23] might be conformed to the image of
[53:25] Christ God is purposing everything in
[53:27] your life that you might be conformed to
[53:30] the image of his son amen that's in
[53:33] Romans chapter 8 so we must recognize
[53:36] and submit to God's will and not seek
[53:39] our own will because the smartest we may
[53:43] be with money or as smart as we may be
[53:44] or is it with as much wisdom a gift of
[53:47] wisdom as we may have in the Holy Spirit
[53:49] that doesn't guarantee certain things in
[53:52] life it's about the plan of God for our
[53:54] lives
[53:55] please nasty 1020 curse not the King no
[53:59] no not in thy thoughts and curse not the
[54:02] rich in thy bedchamber some people are
[54:05] so jealous of rich people that they
[54:07] speak evil of just because they're rich
[54:09] the Bible says not to do that for a bird
[54:12] of the air shall carry the voice and
[54:14] that which hath wings shall tell the
[54:16] matter I don't know if you saw this but
[54:18] I think Twitter's in this verse I saw
[54:21] that years ago when I first read this in
[54:22] Twitter Twitter's in this verse right
[54:24] because people have all these curses and
[54:26] they tweet them out like that like our
[54:28] president sometimes it's good sometimes
[54:30] as bad but they tweet out the evil
[54:33] things in their heart right and a little
[54:35] bird carries it over all over the
[54:37] internet so everybody sees what they're
[54:38] thinking in their bedchamber
[54:40] oh my so see we're not the curse anybody
[54:43] we're to bless and not curse amen
[54:46] that's right now a member church God
[54:49] made Solomon rich remember God makes
[54:52] poor God makes rich but we know you some
[54:55] of his riches to build idolatrous
[54:57] temples see God was pleased he did not
[55:00] ask for riches he did not ask for a long
[55:03] life he did not ask for a life over his
[55:06] enemies or he didn't ask for the life as
[55:08] enemies he asked for discernment and God
[55:11] said because you asked that I'll give
[55:12] you everything you didn't ask for but
[55:14] remember his wives turned his heart away
[55:16] and he built high places for Chima and
[55:20] Moab and likewise he did for every I'm
[55:25] sure likewise did he for all the strange
[55:27] wives was birch incense and sacrifice
[55:29] unto their gods
[55:31] so just because God makes us rich
[55:33] doesn't mean everything's going to turn
[55:35] out good
[55:35] we need a continual living sacrifice of
[55:38] our hearts and minds unto God we need to
[55:41] die daily how we need to die today to
[55:43] yourself die to your own feelings died
[55:46] your own emotions died to your own
[55:48] leadings and wisdom die to your own self
[55:52] and live for Christ now remember this
[55:56] what I love about God although God makes
[55:58] some rich in some poor God ensures
[56:01] there's plenty for the poor and the
[56:05] Church said God you say well God made me
[56:09] I hardly have enough well that's not
[56:11] what the Bible says so I have to ask are
[56:14] using your resources the right way are
[56:16] you looking for resources because
[56:17] there's resources out there now of
[56:20] course we know maybe a time of trial
[56:21] time of tests as well but let's look at
[56:24] this the Bible says this look at
[56:26] proverbs 13 23 March food is in the
[56:30] tillage of the poor not a little bit of
[56:33] food much food but there's that that
[56:38] destroy for want of judgment see those
[56:42] people that don't judge this this
[56:44] promise that God gave about leftover
[56:47] food in their fields if they didn't
[56:49] judge it then they'd be destroyed if
[56:51] they didn't believe God's Word that God
[56:53] was going to leave or have his people
[56:55] leave all these crops and everything in
[56:58] the seventh year then they'd be judged
[57:00] because that's what Exodus 23 says and
[57:03] six years shalt thou show that land and
[57:06] shall gather in the fruits thereof but
[57:08] the seventh year thou shalt let it rest
[57:10] and lie still can you imagine on the
[57:13] seventh can you imagine every seven
[57:15] years you wouldn't have to go to work
[57:16] brother William can you imagine that
[57:17] thank goodness Oh glory I get you know I
[57:20] get two and half months off every summer
[57:22] can you imagine a whole year off this is
[57:25] what God promises people work hard for
[57:27] six years take a year off yeah he said
[57:32] I'll give you so much in the six years
[57:33] you'll have plenty to last that seventh
[57:35] year not that the poor of thy people may
[57:40] eat so God said don't even plan so just
[57:43] take that seventh year off just
[57:45] distressed and whatever grows up it'll
[57:48] be for the poor people and the beasts of
[57:50] the field and what they leave the beasts
[57:53] of the field shall eat in like manner
[57:55] thou shalt deal with thy vineyard and
[57:57] with thigh olive guard amen how many
[58:00] believe God is all-powerful God God told
[58:04] him if you just wait on the seventh year
[58:06] God was gonna do the farming God was
[58:08] gonna do the planting and that's and if
[58:10] you know if God's a farmer he's going to
[58:12] get great yields amen if you place it in
[58:15] God's hands and if you let God provide
[58:17] for you God is going to make sure
[58:18] there's plenty of food in the tillage of
[58:21] the pouring ahead
[58:22] God we're going to bless that seventh
[58:24] year if you just trusted the Lord and
[58:27] how we should trust him today amen
[58:30] that's beautiful
[58:32] now we don't have time but well we do
[58:35] have time let's go there let's go to the
[58:36] biggest 25
[58:37] let's make time here I got time let me
[58:41] set the timer though because I don't
[58:42] want to lose track of time keep saying
[58:45] the word time Leviticus 25 one two seven
[58:52] this is a little more information about
[58:55] what we just read God gives a little
[59:00] more detail 1 this 7 a little
[59:06] spake unto Moses at Mount Sinai saying
[59:08] speaking of the children of Israel and
[59:09] saying to them when you come into land
[59:11] which I give you then then shall the
[59:14] land keep a Sabbath unto the Lord six
[59:18] years thou shalt sow thy field and six
[59:21] years thou shalt prune thy vineyard and
[59:23] gather in the fruit thereof but in the
[59:25] seventh year shall be a Sabbath of rest
[59:27] unto the land a Sabbath for the Lord
[59:30] thou shalt neither so that I feel no
[59:33] pruned I've been iord that which growth
[59:35] of its own accord of the harvest thou
[59:37] shalt not reap neither gather the grapes
[59:40] of thy vine undressed for it is a year
[59:42] of rest under the land and the Sabbath
[59:44] of the land shall be meat for you for
[59:47] thee and for thy servant and for thy
[59:48] maid and for the hired servant and for
[59:51] thy stranger that sojourneth with thee
[59:52] and for thy cattle and for the beasts
[59:54] that are in thy land shall all the
[59:57] increase there of be meat so see God was
[1:00:00] promising them work hard six years and I
[1:00:03] promise I'll take care of you I'll bless
[1:00:05] those years and you take that seventh
[1:00:07] year off and I'll provide food for the
[1:00:09] poor and I'll provide food for the
[1:00:12] beasts because it's a Sabbath unto me
[1:00:14] it's a rest unto God it's a time to rest
[1:00:18] and learn to trust God amen is that how
[1:00:20] we do it you know people get so upset
[1:00:22] well I got to work more days I go to six
[1:00:24] days and then pretty soon they got to go
[1:00:25] to seven and stop coming to church and
[1:00:27] all these things like that
[1:00:28] and see we get the same test today we've
[1:00:31] got to have the same a confidence that
[1:00:33] if I work if I do as much as I can and I
[1:00:35] give God his
[1:00:37] a birthday brother branham called Sunday
[1:00:38] his Sabbath day how do we know that I
[1:00:40] just heard it today or I'm sorry heard
[1:00:42] this week my dad said our Sabbath day
[1:00:45] today our Sabbath day of worship is
[1:00:46] Sunday that's our day we take off it's
[1:00:49] the day we give the whole day to the
[1:00:50] Lord amen
[1:00:51] so see we're promises if we are if we're
[1:00:54] given this if we will put God first and
[1:00:57] honor God with a Sabbath and God will
[1:01:00] bless us amen it's the promise of the
[1:01:03] Lord now here I think you'll like this
[1:01:05] quote I like this now who can doubt that
[1:01:07] that's what Paul said that's Paul
[1:01:09] scripture that's Paul's right that's
[1:01:11] what he taught his church the church
[1:01:13] positioning before the foundation of the
[1:01:15] world when God in his labor pain was
[1:01:17] bringing forth bringing forth you
[1:01:20] knowing what you would do he presented a
[1:01:23] placed you into his own body to be a
[1:01:26] housewife to be a farmer to be a
[1:01:31] preacher to be a prophet to be this or
[1:01:34] to be that he placed you positionally
[1:01:37] aren't you glad for the farmers where
[1:01:41] would you be tonight if you were if we
[1:01:43] didn't have farmers we'd be probably out
[1:01:45] working in the fields I'm so thankful
[1:01:47] that God has positionally place he is
[1:01:50] he's called men and perhaps women from
[1:01:53] the womb you're gonna grow up and be a
[1:01:54] farmer and he's done that he's
[1:01:57] positionally placed them to serve God as
[1:02:00] a farmer that they might do a great work
[1:02:02] and put food on our table to meet the
[1:02:05] needs of all God's children amen
[1:02:07] I'm glad God's got doctors at her call
[1:02:10] of God amen
[1:02:11] and teachers and nurses and our
[1:02:14] housewives and husbands and all these
[1:02:16] things God has positionally placed us
[1:02:18] and we should be thankful for all of
[1:02:20] them amen because that's what God has
[1:02:22] called us to do before the foundation of
[1:02:25] the world amen
[1:02:28] look at the Bible says this is speaking
[1:02:30] when when a rich man and a poor man
[1:02:32] walking to the church or if they're come
[1:02:34] unto your assembly a man with the gold
[1:02:36] ring and goodly apparel and they're
[1:02:38] coming also a poor man in a vile raiment
[1:02:40] and you have respect to him that wears
[1:02:42] the gay clothing and say to him sit thou
[1:02:45] here in a good place and say the poor
[1:02:47] stand thou here or sit here under my
[1:02:49] footstool
[1:02:51] are ye not then partial in yourselves
[1:02:53] and our become judges of evil thoughts
[1:02:56] hearken my beloved brethren now look at
[1:02:58] this hath not God chosen the poor of
[1:03:02] this world rich in faith and heirs of
[1:03:06] the kingdom which he has promised to
[1:03:08] them that love him amen
[1:03:10] who is God choosing many times those who
[1:03:13] are rich in faith not rich in money but
[1:03:16] rich in faith amen and many times like
[1:03:19] brother man tells us the Christians are
[1:03:21] poor people there on the poor side God
[1:03:25] chooses them because they need God they
[1:03:27] need to believe the promises of God amen
[1:03:30] and so God chooses them and will make
[1:03:34] them inheritors of God's kingdom amen
[1:03:37] because he's the great heavenly father
[1:03:39] oh what a blessing to know that God
[1:03:42] makes some rich God makes some poor
[1:03:44] remember jesus said there be very few of
[1:03:47] rich that enter the kingdom of God
[1:03:48] very few rich people but God has chosen
[1:03:52] the poor who have rich faith hallelujah
[1:03:56] amen now let's look at the treatment of
[1:03:59] the poor this is what the proverb says
[1:04:01] about how we treat the poor the poor is
[1:04:06] hated even of his own neighbor but the
[1:04:09] rich have many friends now this is a
[1:04:12] good way to judge whether you're rich or
[1:04:14] poor to your neighbor's hate you or not
[1:04:16] I guess you could be a you know
[1:04:18] Solomon's making a generalized statement
[1:04:21] here but most of the time you know your
[1:04:23] neighbors should love you if you're real
[1:04:24] Christian amen
[1:04:25] but Solomon notice poor people are hated
[1:04:29] by their neighbors that's what Solomon
[1:04:31] noticed all the brethren of the poor do
[1:04:34] hate him so even the family members of
[1:04:36] the poor hate when they come around now
[1:04:40] these must not be saved people how much
[1:04:43] more do his friends go far from him so
[1:04:45] poor people tend to not have good family
[1:04:48] relationships because they don't want to
[1:04:49] be around them right their friends don't
[1:04:53] want to be around them their neighbors
[1:04:54] don't want to rerun them so see many
[1:04:56] times poor people just have one hope
[1:04:58] that's God right he pursues them with
[1:05:02] words yet they are one too
[1:05:04] to him oh my the rich ruled us over the
[1:05:10] poor so the poor always feel like
[1:05:11] they're in kinda like a slave slavery or
[1:05:14] captivity and the borrower is servant to
[1:05:17] the lender by like this in the
[1:05:20] Millennium in the future home the poor
[1:05:22] will rule over the rich amen
[1:05:24] just like Lazarus the beggar he was poor
[1:05:26] and he just begged for the crumbs but
[1:05:28] then he's there with Abraham and
[1:05:30] Abraham's bosom and the rich man's
[1:05:32] asking for one little drop of water
[1:05:34] right and so God
[1:05:36] switches it around right he switches
[1:05:39] their destinies around or I say their
[1:05:41] conditions based upon their their faith
[1:05:44] even though he's poor in the world
[1:05:46] Lazarus was rich in faith amen
[1:05:48] hallelujah isn't that striking he was
[1:05:52] rich in faith but yet he never got out
[1:05:53] of being a beggar see how God makes some
[1:05:56] rich and some poor and the church said
[1:05:59] see God makes some poor I wonder how
[1:06:02] many times he prayed Oh God give me give
[1:06:04] me more than a few crumbs give me you
[1:06:06] know give me but maybe God just allowed
[1:06:08] him to be poor for a purpose for a
[1:06:09] testimony right that's what God does he
[1:06:12] raises us for a testimony hallelujah now
[1:06:17] proverbs 14 31 he that oppresses the
[1:06:21] poor reproaches his maker so people make
[1:06:24] it harder on the poor or don't give to
[1:06:27] the poor they taught blaspheme or defy
[1:06:30] God because God is the maker of the poor
[1:06:35] but either on earth him hath mercy on
[1:06:38] the poor how many knew that how many
[1:06:43] knew is that serious it's that serious
[1:06:46] how we treat the poor and I'm gonna try
[1:06:49] to remember at the end of this service I
[1:06:51] really like it if you would give me a
[1:06:53] list on a piece of paper of any poor
[1:06:55] people you know that we can help them
[1:06:56] out if you know anybody pray about it
[1:06:59] you know but if you can remember then
[1:07:00] this service you have any friends that
[1:07:01] you know or poor Church we need to help
[1:07:04] them out and you believe that we need to
[1:07:08] help out if you can't give them cash
[1:07:10] let's give them rice or let's give them
[1:07:11] beans or let's give them something let's
[1:07:13] help out the poor who so market the poor
[1:07:17] see we shouldn't mock the poor reproach
[1:07:20] his maker blasphemes his maker and he
[1:07:24] that is glad at calamity shall not be
[1:07:26] unpunished so see we search and doesn't
[1:07:29] it break your heart if you're a
[1:07:29] Christian it should break your heart
[1:07:31] when there's tsunamis or earthquakes or
[1:07:33] tornadoes and people die or there's
[1:07:35] flooding that should break our hearts we
[1:07:39] shouldn't be glad at calamities we
[1:07:41] should have pity and pray for them amen
[1:07:44] we do not mock the poor we don't oppress
[1:07:47] the poor we don't laugh at people who go
[1:07:50] through calamities remember like the
[1:07:52] Bible said in first Corinthians 12 if
[1:07:54] we're a body when one part hurts all the
[1:07:57] rest of the body hurts for that part
[1:08:00] right
[1:08:01] all of it hurts like Monday I work so
[1:08:05] hard Monday I moved all of our furniture
[1:08:06] and I think I did 28 flights of steps on
[1:08:10] Monday and I will overwork myself so on
[1:08:15] Monday I woke up and I had a headache
[1:08:16] all day I'm sorry on Tuesday I had a
[1:08:18] head like all day yesterday because I
[1:08:20] was drinking water I was doing
[1:08:22] everything I got 9 hours of sleep yeah I
[1:08:25] still had a headache because I
[1:08:26] overworked my body and you think I could
[1:08:28] get much work done on Tuesday no because
[1:08:30] my head was pounding my hands went into
[1:08:33] work my heart wanted to work my legs
[1:08:35] want to work but my mind wouldn't let me
[1:08:37] because I have such a bad headache the
[1:08:40] rest of the body felt the pain of the
[1:08:43] headache but I went to bed last night
[1:08:44] what woke up fine this morning but see
[1:08:47] everybody every part of the body depends
[1:08:50] on every other part and church we depend
[1:08:52] on one another by God's grace amen
[1:08:57] look the poor uses entreaties but the
[1:09:01] rich answereth roughly I mean how many
[1:09:03] aware of that rich people are usually
[1:09:05] real short may be arrogant and their
[1:09:08] answers they treat people real roughly
[1:09:10] but a poor person they're using please
[1:09:13] can you please they're begging you I'm
[1:09:15] begging you can you do this you know can
[1:09:17] you that's one way to know where they
[1:09:19] stand
[1:09:21] wealth maketh many friends but the poor
[1:09:24] is separated from his neighbors so the
[1:09:26] people that are often poorest are the
[1:09:27] loneliest people so we have to remember
[1:09:31] that
[1:09:31] the poor people are often the most
[1:09:34] lonely and so we need to go visit them
[1:09:37] we need to help them now look at this
[1:09:42] let's listen for the cry the poor as we
[1:09:45] pray tonight and a little bit here let's
[1:09:47] listen for the cries of the poor who so
[1:09:50] stoppeth his ears at the cry of the poor
[1:09:53] he also shall cry himself but shall not
[1:09:57] be heard think about that all right if
[1:10:01] we don't if we don't listen to other
[1:10:03] other people what their needs are and if
[1:10:04] we don't care what their needs are well
[1:10:06] then we at when we ask for something
[1:10:07] God's not gonna answer our need how we
[1:10:10] treat others is how we treat the Lord
[1:10:12] right try of the poor and if our ears
[1:10:15] are open we'll hear it how many be that
[1:10:18] there is a cry of the poor please ask
[1:10:23] these five eight now this is this is the
[1:10:26] confidence we have here again with God
[1:10:30] how God is going to take care of the
[1:10:31] poor but look what says if thou see us
[1:10:33] the oppression of the poor and violent
[1:10:35] perverting of judgment and justice in a
[1:10:38] province Marvel not at the matter so if
[1:10:43] we see the poor being mistreated we're
[1:10:44] not the Marvel be like surprised like oh
[1:10:46] this is new for he that is higher than
[1:10:50] the highest regardeth amen and there be
[1:10:55] higher than they a men see the poor are
[1:10:58] not without someone to fight for them
[1:11:00] God is gonna fight for them amen but
[1:11:02] many times search God uses us to fight
[1:11:05] for them hallelujah so we've got to
[1:11:08] always hear the cry of the poor remember
[1:11:13] God is in control he fights for the poor
[1:11:18] look what look at this one proverbs 29
[1:11:21] 13 the poor and the deceitful man meet
[1:11:25] together to see the sinner in the poor
[1:11:27] the Lord lighten both their that means
[1:11:30] illuminates both their eyes so the poor
[1:11:33] rich and the rich come together or the
[1:11:34] poor in the center come together God
[1:11:36] opens both their eyes to see their
[1:11:38] conditions and to see the Word of God
[1:11:40] right the Bible said that God wrote a
[1:11:43] conscience in every person's heart
[1:11:45] so at some point they recognized wow
[1:11:47] there there's got to be a god at some
[1:11:49] point they have to God lightens both
[1:11:51] their eyes and God gives every man a
[1:11:54] chance to do his will
[1:11:55] amen so God makes some rich God makes
[1:11:59] some poor God gives everyone a chance to
[1:12:01] help out the poor that's right amen
[1:12:04] look at this one proverbs 22 22 rob not
[1:12:07] the poor because he's poor
[1:12:09] neither oppress the afflicted in the
[1:12:12] gate for the Lord will plead their cause
[1:12:15] I like that one
[1:12:16] glory amen remember the gate was the
[1:12:19] courtroom of those days so if a poor
[1:12:22] person gets treated in the courtroom we
[1:12:24] don't have to get all discouraged too
[1:12:26] much because the Lord is going to plead
[1:12:28] their cause amen and sport look at this
[1:12:31] spoil the soul of those that spoil them
[1:12:34] that means like losing your life right
[1:12:37] losing your salvation or or not being
[1:12:39] saved or being lost this is such a deep
[1:12:42] heartfelt matter to God and you know it
[1:12:46] Matthew 25 Jesus gives eternal life just
[1:12:49] to those who gave me to someone the
[1:12:51] least of all the Christians if you just
[1:12:52] give them a meal Jesus will give you
[1:12:54] eternal life oh this is such a heart
[1:12:58] message of God God says help people help
[1:13:02] the poor do something for them if not
[1:13:05] I'll spoil their souls we've got to have
[1:13:08] a burden to help the poor and now I just
[1:13:10] talked about it to do something about it
[1:13:12] now I just preach about it but do
[1:13:14] something about it amen the Lord will
[1:13:19] plead their cause and spoil the soul of
[1:13:23] those that spoiled them now again he
[1:13:27] that
[1:13:28] presses the poor to increase his riches
[1:13:30] and he they give it to the rich just
[1:13:32] surely come to one God will make it
[1:13:34] where they they're getting more God will
[1:13:35] make them lose it all well so we'll see
[1:13:37] that here a little bit in the scripture
[1:13:39] you liking this so far you like to say
[1:13:41] Amen I I was well I'm just like well
[1:13:44] this is flowing this morning I said up
[1:13:46] this is wonderful it's beautiful
[1:13:48] here's there's I love it you need we
[1:13:51] should be happy when we help the poor he
[1:13:53] that despises his neighbor sitteth but
[1:13:56] he that hath mercy on the poor happy is
[1:13:58] he
[1:13:59] how can people end their lives how can
[1:14:02] there be no hope in life when the Bible
[1:14:04] says if you are have mercy on people you
[1:14:08] will be happy
[1:14:10] Amen that's in the Old Testament that's
[1:14:12] not even the Holy Ghost joy this is just
[1:14:15] common regular happiness human happiness
[1:14:17] when you care about other people when
[1:14:20] you have mercy on those who might not
[1:14:21] deserve it the Bible said God will make
[1:14:24] you happy hey man I don't want to be
[1:14:27] happy out there I do I don't want to be
[1:14:31] sad I won't even scourge I don't want me
[1:14:32] to press I want to be happy well the
[1:14:34] Bible tells us one sure way to do it
[1:14:36] have mercy on someone poor person and
[1:14:42] the church don't feel bad too if it's
[1:14:44] the beggar I know I know most of those
[1:14:46] beggars I've I've seen a beggar get
[1:14:48] money and I've seen him walk into the
[1:14:50] gas station where we weren't we rented a
[1:14:52] u-haul down there on Waterloo Avenue
[1:14:53] let's see where would it be
[1:14:55] I'm not sure where I'm at right now it's
[1:14:57] that way but I watched we went to the
[1:14:59] John and I rented a u-haul one time to
[1:15:01] move the church there might have been to
[1:15:02] this place right here and we saw a man
[1:15:04] get money from the street he walked over
[1:15:07] here and bought a beer and just started
[1:15:09] drinking it now do you think those
[1:15:11] people really want their money to help a
[1:15:13] drunk person no but see that the the the
[1:15:17] point I'm trying to make is that God
[1:15:19] sends rain on the just and the unjust
[1:15:22] Amen God sends the Holy Ghost anointing
[1:15:26] on the unjust just as well as the just
[1:15:29] right god waters the thorn just like he
[1:15:32] waters your petunias oh yeah hey or
[1:15:34] whatever flowers you love tulips
[1:15:37] whatever you love he what he sends water
[1:15:38] on both of them
[1:15:40] and so if you give something and someone
[1:15:43] misused it you don't feel bad because
[1:15:45] that's what God does all God does that
[1:15:46] all the time
[1:15:47] God does that every day he sends he let
[1:15:50] the Sun Rise on people who don't deserve
[1:15:52] it who blaspheme his name who speak evil
[1:15:56] the Word of God God keeps sending
[1:15:58] blessing and help after help after help
[1:16:00] chance after chance after chance that's
[1:16:02] the love of God and Jesus said if you do
[1:16:04] that then you'll be the children of my
[1:16:06] father which is in heaven amen
[1:16:08] that makes you a real child of God now
[1:16:11] I'm not saying go give cash to a drunk
[1:16:13] beggar that's not what I'm saying but
[1:16:15] I'm saying you can have peace that if
[1:16:17] you feel letting to give and you give
[1:16:19] something God will honor that and you'll
[1:16:21] be happy because of a men like I said in
[1:16:26] the past you know with with my busy life
[1:16:28] and you know when I see beggars in the
[1:16:30] past I've stacked tuna cans and Lydia
[1:16:33] Prime members this Lydia Malachi I used
[1:16:35] to stacked tuna cans right in that
[1:16:37] little space between the two front seats
[1:16:38] and church age books when I'd see a
[1:16:40] beggar I just give him both the church a
[1:16:42] tuna can and I gave my cards I never got
[1:16:46] one call one time I offered a man food
[1:16:50] and he said I don't like that food I
[1:16:51] said you must not be very hungry then
[1:16:53] sir it was right up by the corner right
[1:16:56] here right when you got off a 77 south I
[1:16:58] said well you must not be very hungry I
[1:17:00] don't like that oh man my you must be
[1:17:05] livin good out there on those gift I
[1:17:10] wish I had oh ma but if you're really
[1:17:14] hungry you'll eat anything the Bible
[1:17:16] says that - if you're really hungry even
[1:17:18] the most sour thing is like honey the
[1:17:21] Bible says that so see we want to be
[1:17:24] happy and so one way to be happy and the
[1:17:27] program said it's live eternal life is
[1:17:29] living for other people this is living
[1:17:31] for other people look at this he that
[1:17:35] bite now this is my user his interests
[1:17:37] so he that my interest in unjust gain
[1:17:39] increases his substance he should gather
[1:17:42] it for him that will pity the poor oh my
[1:17:46] so if a man is using evil ways to get
[1:17:50] money got the Bible said God will find
[1:17:53] some way to take his money
[1:17:54] from him and then somehow give it to the
[1:17:56] poor that's what the Bible says God
[1:17:59] reward those who help the poor right
[1:18:02] pity the poor we have to have pity on
[1:18:05] the poor the king that faithfully judges
[1:18:12] the poor I like that you see they got to
[1:18:14] be judged too like like we said they got
[1:18:15] to judge them is this a drunk is this a
[1:18:17] cigarette addict is this a cocaine
[1:18:19] addict got to be careful what we give
[1:18:21] them right the king that faithfully
[1:18:24] judges the poor his throne shall be
[1:18:26] established forever amen
[1:18:28] huh me know you're a king and a priest
[1:18:29] Hey amen you got a faithfully judge the
[1:18:33] polari men that's right
[1:18:36] Parvez 31 nine remember this is King
[1:18:42] Lemuel mother could have been Bathsheba
[1:18:44] or it could have been another woman open
[1:18:47] thy mouth and judge righteously and
[1:18:48] plead the cause of the poor and the
[1:18:52] needy so if there's any poor friend you
[1:18:54] have and you see them in a bad situation
[1:18:56] open your mouth
[1:18:58] tell me tell somebody and let's try to
[1:19:00] help out their cause by the grace of
[1:19:01] Lord never understand
[1:19:03] Amen we want I want to know because many
[1:19:06] times hurts just fifty dollars of food
[1:19:08] or twenty dollars of food or ten dollars
[1:19:10] of food will bless their hearts and know
[1:19:12] that it'll make you happy it'll make us
[1:19:15] happy by the grace of the Lord now we
[1:19:22] said this earlier the Lord rate makes
[1:19:24] rich and poor but yet he gives free more
[1:19:26] agency and opportunities so you know God
[1:19:28] has God has a position for both of us
[1:19:31] but or for each of us whether rich or
[1:19:34] poor but even within that we have to be
[1:19:37] faithful with what he's given to us so
[1:19:40] let's go through these scriptures I
[1:19:41] think you understand what I'm trying to
[1:19:42] say in other words you could increase
[1:19:44] your money or you can lose your money
[1:19:45] you know you can be faithful with your
[1:19:48] money or you can be unfaithful happy is
[1:19:51] the man that findeth wisdom and the man
[1:19:53] that getteth understanding for the
[1:19:54] merchandise of it is better than the
[1:19:56] merchandise of silver and the game there
[1:19:58] have been fine gold she is more precious
[1:20:02] than rubies and all the things that thou
[1:20:03] canst desire not to be compared into her
[1:20:06] length of days is it a right
[1:20:08] and in her left hand riches and honor
[1:20:10] amen
[1:20:13] so the wisdom of God the understanding
[1:20:16] of God is more valuable than silver or

[1:20:21] this start stock market people ask me
[1:20:23] well you know is this the end time
[1:20:25] they've asked me should we buy gold or
[1:20:27] should we invest in silver and I'm like
[1:20:30] just invest in the Holy Ghost you don't
[1:20:32] have to worry about the value of that's
[1:20:34] gonna go down Oh what if the Holy Ghost

[1:20:37] keep being more valuable all the time

[1:21:02] market glory but we got to believe that
[1:21:06] we got to believe the baptism of the
[1:21:08] Holy Ghost good that's wisdom write the
[1:21:09] wise virgins had the Holy Ghost
[1:21:10] we gotta believe the baptism Holy Ghost
[1:21:12] is more valuable than our bank accounts

[1:21:17] friends or getting our parents or
[1:21:19] getting our loved ones to the baptism of
[1:21:21] the Holy Ghost
[1:21:22] is more valuable than all the money you
[1:21:24] can save up and all the interest you can
[1:21:26] make oh I believe that church don't you
[1:21:29] believe that amen more valuable than all
[1:21:32] that that's the Word of God wisdom says

[1:21:59] gold and my revenue my yield or produce
[1:22:02] is better than choice silver to have the

[1:22:09] gains you can make on the stock market
[1:22:11] or all the deals you can pull if you're
[1:22:12] a business man or woman it's better than

[1:22:21] if you invest in the wisdom of God amen
[1:22:24] and they're more durable as well praise
[1:22:28] God
[1:22:30] now you know this but I just well I just
[1:22:32] had one scripture on me not lazy how
[1:22:34] long with our sleep o sluggard when wilt
[1:22:36] thou arise out of thy sleepy right yet a
[1:22:41] little sleeping a little slumber a
[1:22:42] little folding of the hands to sleep
[1:22:44] socialize of poverty come as one that
[1:22:46] travaileth and I want as in our men I
[1:22:49] see this in a lot of young men they
[1:22:52] don't get jobs that live with their
[1:22:54] parents or they bum off people they move
[1:22:56] in with that person move in with that
[1:22:57] one moving they never get the place
[1:22:59] where they can really live on their own
[1:23:01] and stand for themselves and that's
[1:23:04] because it's a lazy Spirit amen and
[1:23:07] poverty will come to the lazy person
[1:23:10] where the BAM said a person that will
[1:23:11] work is a Christian a Christian will
[1:23:13] work that's right
[1:23:16] he becometh poor that deals with a slack
[1:23:19] hand but the hand of the diligent maketh
[1:23:23] rich so people who are diligent about
[1:23:26] they're faithful about their work
[1:23:27] hard-working not slack not lazy not
[1:23:32] carefree but they're diligent the Bible
[1:23:34] said they can become rich and now Church
[1:23:39] there is one good reason to become rich
[1:23:40] so you can give it all away amen that's
[1:23:46] the one reason you might want to be rich
[1:23:48] you know God gives you sometimes like I
[1:23:50] said God may allow you have choices in
[1:23:52] life well if you make a choice if you're
[1:23:54] a good a businessman investor do that so
[1:23:57] you can help somebody out how many
[1:23:59] member brother bill Dow from brother
[1:24:00] branham's sermons
[1:24:01] how many member him he's from Lima Ohio
[1:24:04] his granddaughter went to the church
[1:24:08] that I was first became in the message
[1:24:09] in down there in lima by believers he
[1:24:12] was a millionaire well guess who paid
[1:24:14] for brother Rams $40,000 IRS bill who
[1:24:19] paid for that when it was due in 1962
[1:24:21] who paid for that a millionaire bill Dow
[1:24:24] [Laughter]
[1:24:26] Amen brother have said when he paid it
[1:24:28] he said he shouted and rejoice he said
[1:24:30] I'm free all my debts been paid I'm free
[1:24:33] and he said I'm gonna pay
[1:24:34] they're build out back little by little
[1:24:36] I don't know if he ever did but see God
[1:24:39] needed a rich man to pay off the
[1:24:41] prophets debt and the church said see
[1:24:46] God has some poor God makes some rich
[1:24:51] it's a good thing build I was diligent
[1:24:53] with his money because he helped pay off
[1:24:55] a prophet's debt
[1:24:56] he wasn't slack he wasn't lazy he was a
[1:24:59] hard-working man millionaire there is
[1:25:05] that maketh himself rich yet half
[1:25:06] nothing else well this is a lot of
[1:25:08] sinners do this today they become rich
[1:25:10] but yet really they don't have anything
[1:25:13] there is that make of himself poor yet
[1:25:17] he has great riches amen praise the Lord
[1:25:21] and that beautiful God makes it turn the
[1:25:25] opposite way if you got the wrong desire
[1:25:26] God will turn it out to the bad but if
[1:25:29] you've got the right desire God turn it
[1:25:30] into good amen it looks like you're
[1:25:32] getting poor less money less money all
[1:25:34] the time but God's saying I'm making you
[1:25:36] rich I'm young letting you store up
[1:25:39] treasures in heaven brother sister oh my
[1:25:44] either love with pleasure shall be a
[1:25:46] poor man
[1:25:47] so then getting back to your people that
[1:25:49] burn up you know I've seen my friends do
[1:25:51] that my high school friends they got
[1:25:52] jobs and they would only go to work
[1:25:54] because they had to pay off all the
[1:25:56] money they spent on alcohol that weekend
[1:25:58] right or their fancy car some or their
[1:26:01] cigarettes and drugs and all these
[1:26:02] things like that that was their only
[1:26:04] motivation to go work was that on Friday
[1:26:06] when they got their paychecks they could
[1:26:08] go blow it at the bar or in the dance
[1:26:09] club in that a shame he the love with
[1:26:13] pleasure should be a poor man but he the
[1:26:14] love with wine and oil should not be
[1:26:16] rich I like this by humility and the
[1:26:21] fear of the Lord are riches honor and
[1:26:24] life Amen now I look at these four
[1:26:26] spiritual but it can be it can be
[1:26:29] natural as well like because of Solomon
[1:26:31] Solomon got rich because he was humble
[1:26:33] he feared the Lord he wanted he didn't
[1:26:35] ask for the big things he asked for the
[1:26:37] sermon he asked for wisdom to lead the
[1:26:39] people now here's where I'm saying this
[1:26:42] is the scripture where we use if you
[1:26:45] want to become rich you should become
[1:26:46] rich in order to give it all away
[1:26:48] because the Bible said labor not to be
[1:26:51] rich cease from thine own wisdom but you
[1:26:54] should labor to give right
[1:26:56] don't labor to be rich but if you're
[1:26:58] gonna have a successful business then do
[1:27:01] it to help other people out
[1:27:03] wilt thou set thine eyes upon that which
[1:27:06] is not for riches certainly make
[1:27:07] themselves wings they fly away as an
[1:27:10] eagle toward heaven
[1:27:12] all right that's something that's ABAB
[1:27:14] we probably feel a lot of us right Oh
[1:27:16] soon as we make some money just flies
[1:27:18] the way right
[1:27:19] see you later just made this I feel like
[1:27:21] I'm finally getting ahead and there it
[1:27:22] goes
[1:27:24] it just flies away see we got to
[1:27:27] understand that God will take care of us
[1:27:29] amen God will take care of us so we
[1:27:32] labor so we work hard to give now let me
[1:27:34] tell you another testimony recently one
[1:27:36] of my friends down in the I'll just tell
[1:27:38] you it was brother Tim Humes
[1:27:40] and he he he sat on her brother Rams
[1:27:44] ministry as a child growing up and he
[1:27:47] felt led after brother man left the
[1:27:49] scene he felt led to start a church and
[1:27:50] he said it never grew his church never
[1:27:54] grew until he started doing an annual
[1:27:56] missionary meeting and then when he
[1:27:58] started bringing the missionaries every
[1:28:00] year and he would raise as much money as
[1:28:01] he could give the missionaries
[1:28:02] he said his church started expanding and
[1:28:04] spanning when they needed to build a new
[1:28:06] church and I know this I know this for a
[1:28:08] fact because I know the person one of
[1:28:11] the members in the church this business
[1:28:13] started booming he was working on the
[1:28:15] internet and his business aren't
[1:28:16] expanding and now he makes multi million
[1:28:19] dollars a year and guess where his ties
[1:28:20] go when the church needed a new church
[1:28:23] to build a church all those ties from
[1:28:26] the men's means dollars went to build
[1:28:28] this church and now it's paid for and
[1:28:30] it's just like 300 or 400 down there in
[1:28:33] North Carolina doesn't that something
[1:28:35] this this and I know this man this man's
[1:28:38] a multi you know he's made a
[1:28:39] multi-millionaire I know him but God let
[1:28:43] him me rich in order to give so the
[1:28:46] people would have a place to worship and
[1:28:48] people from all the way around the world
[1:28:50] come to this church to hear the Word of
[1:28:52] God amen
[1:28:54] glory and I like that like how God backs
[1:28:57] up that kind of effort like that God
[1:29:00] backs up that missionary effort
[1:29:02] God backs it up and so see if we're
[1:29:04] gonna labor here for if we see we're
[1:29:06] going to be pretty good financially then
[1:29:08] God's giving us that so we can give it
[1:29:10] to somebody else
[1:29:11] and not to make our lives well I'm
[1:29:14] Richard increases goods I don't have
[1:29:16] need of nothing you know that attitude
[1:29:18] you know we don't want that attitude I
[1:29:21] look at this through wisdom as a house
[1:29:24] builded and my understanding is
[1:29:26] established and by now it's other
[1:29:27] chambers be filled with all precious and
[1:29:29] pleasant riches so when you have wisdom
[1:29:33] and knowledge your house is filled with
[1:29:34] all these riches spiritual spiritual
[1:29:37] riches a faithful man shall bound with
[1:29:42] blessings I hope you I hope you can say
[1:29:45] that all the time my God has blessed me
[1:29:46] so much I've been saying that a lot this
[1:29:48] week God you have just been so merciful
[1:29:50] you have just blessed me with godly
[1:29:52] friends and and godly Christians but he
[1:29:55] that maketh haste to be rich shall not
[1:29:57] be innocent so see here's the sin if if
[1:30:00] God gives you ability as a businessman
[1:30:02] or woman we're not to get nervous and
[1:30:04] upset trying to get rich we're not let's
[1:30:07] we're not trying to make haste to be
[1:30:09] rich if God allows it then God allows it
[1:30:11] but God will allow us you can bless
[1:30:13] other people but see the sin is when you
[1:30:16] really want to get rich really faster
[1:30:18] you really want to make a lot of money
[1:30:19] really fast because that shows a lack of
[1:30:21] patience that shows a lack of faith and
[1:30:25] the Bible said he that haste is to be
[1:30:27] rich hath an evil eye oh I've just got
[1:30:31] to make more money any way I can make
[1:30:33] quick money anyway you see people like
[1:30:35] that they got a evil eye they got greedy
[1:30:37] they're prideful the error gets
[1:30:39] something like they've got some type of
[1:30:41] greedy spirit or something they're all
[1:30:43] just nervous about it I got to make more
[1:30:46] I gotta make more don't we know that our
[1:30:48] father owns the cattle on a Thousand
[1:30:49] Hills we we always hear that Scripture
[1:30:52] from the Psalms it's so true it's so
[1:30:55] true we shouldn't be in a big hurry to
[1:30:57] try to be rich or being a big hurry to
[1:31:00] try to get more money just trust in God
[1:31:02] just be diligent just honor God just
[1:31:06] seek ye first the kingdom of God and all
[1:31:09] these things have you added unto you
[1:31:11] amen see
[1:31:14] that kind of person he doesn't consider
[1:31:16] that poverty you'll come upon him to get
[1:31:19] rich quick schemes we've all seen them
[1:31:21] the pyramid schemes that's an evil heart
[1:31:26] when you are hasting you're really
[1:31:28] nervous and anxious about getting rich
[1:31:30] real fast
[1:31:30] that's a sin there will not be innocent
[1:31:33] in the Bible says I like this prayer you
[1:31:37] remember this prayer brother Branham
[1:31:38] said this is I forget what he call this
[1:31:40] he said like the all-sufficient prayer
[1:31:41] that's not it but he C called this a
[1:31:44] very special prayer of ki King agar two
[1:31:49] things that are required of thee deny me
[1:31:51] them not before I die in other words
[1:31:52] give me these before I die gotta have
[1:31:54] these before I die two things and this
[1:31:57] is how many how do you have this prayer
[1:31:58] tonight remove me far from vanity and
[1:32:00] lies I don't want fake you know class
[1:32:03] and prestige and vanity and wasting of
[1:32:06] God's money and lies and and and
[1:32:10] popularity and famous this I would take
[1:32:13] me far away from that let me live a
[1:32:15] separated life unto God amen hallelujah
[1:32:18] that's not like our church has none of
[1:32:20] that vanity and lies in Hollywood we
[1:32:22] don't want to know Hollywood I'm
[1:32:23] spitting all over my iPad tonight
[1:32:25] I'm preaching the gospel we have no
[1:32:27] popularity here awesome we love is Jesus
[1:32:30] Christ amen and him crucified that's
[1:32:32] right remove me far from vanity and lies
[1:32:35] and the second thing give me neither
[1:32:38] poverty nor riches remember God makes
[1:32:42] rich God makes poor agar said placed me
[1:32:45] right in between brother Mansur this is
[1:32:49] one of the most stable prayers I'd been
[1:32:51] the word don't make me rich don't make
[1:32:54] me poor and this is how you know you're
[1:32:57] poor if you have to go steal or if
[1:32:59] you're tempted to steal because you
[1:33:00] don't have your daily needs that means
[1:33:03] you're poor if not then your your pride
[1:33:05] in this middle road like most of us feed
[1:33:10] me with food convenient for me lest I be
[1:33:13] full of denied he's so rich people are
[1:33:15] more likely to deny God and say who is
[1:33:18] the Lord or lest I be poor and steal and
[1:33:21] take the name of my God in vain so God
[1:33:24] said make me right in the middle my dad
[1:33:25] would always quote not always but my dad
[1:33:27] would often
[1:33:28] this scripture to me growing up because
[1:33:31] my dad you know around around time he
[1:33:33] was 33 or something like that he started
[1:33:34] really studying the Bible and he would
[1:33:37] say Lord don't make me rich Lord don't
[1:33:39] make me poor we see these two things
[1:33:41] remove all sin away from me and then let
[1:33:44] me just live right in the middle of the
[1:33:46] road
[1:33:47] I don't want to be rich I don't want to
[1:33:49] be poor I just want enough to have so I
[1:33:52] can live a life and I can rejoice in the
[1:33:55] food and my family and everything I want
[1:33:57] to rejoice now true riches of course are
[1:34:01] the attributes of Christ's character now
[1:34:04] look the Bible says the tongue
[1:34:05] everybody got tongue here tonight the
[1:34:07] tongue of the just is as choice silver
[1:34:09] God looks at your tongue and he has the
[1:34:12] value of silver the heart of the wicked
[1:34:16] is little worth the lips are the
[1:34:18] righteous feed many but fools die for
[1:34:20] want of wisdom the blessings of the Lord
[1:34:23] it maketh rich and he addeth no sorrow
[1:34:27] with it see God looks at your tongue and
[1:34:30] say my that's a valuable tongue because
[1:34:32] he or she is always giving praise to God
[1:34:35] always thanking God for the blessings
[1:34:37] that's what's valuable in the sight of
[1:34:38] God a heart that loves God is very
[1:34:42] valuable I like this a gracious woman
[1:34:47] retains honor she keeps her honor and
[1:34:50] strong men retain riches is that that's
[1:34:53] a great difference rich men just want to
[1:34:54] keep all their money but women want to
[1:34:56] keep all their godly character Amen
[1:34:58] women willing to keep their godly
[1:35:00] testimony hallelujah a good name is
[1:35:05] rather to be chosen than great riches we
[1:35:07] read that earlier see retain keep keep
[1:35:11] the honor keep the the modesty keep the
[1:35:14] holiness right keep the promise of God
[1:35:17] Jesus said I counsel thee to buy of me
[1:35:20] gold tried in the fire gold as time
[1:35:22] tested faith remember that thou mayest
[1:35:25] be rich and white raiment which is the
[1:35:26] righteousness of the saints that thou
[1:35:29] mayest be clothed and that the shame of
[1:35:31] thy nakedness do not appear and anoint
[1:35:33] thine eyes i understanding with I saw
[1:35:35] that thou may se amen
[1:35:38] that's what I say God give me time
[1:35:40] tested faith
[1:35:41] give me a righteous lifestyle and give
[1:35:43] me understanding to see the Word of God
[1:35:45] amen
[1:35:46] for every error of my life but
[1:35:48] especially with the rich in the poor
[1:35:49] help me to see this this condition
[1:35:55] poverty and shame shall be to him that
[1:35:57] refuses instruction but he that
[1:36:00] regardeth reproof shall be honored ah
[1:36:04] this is going longer than I thought it
[1:36:06] would we do not trust in riches I hope
[1:36:08] you're not trusting your job tonight
[1:36:10] hope you're not trust in your bank
[1:36:11] account tonight or your inheritance hope
[1:36:13] you're trusting in the Living God
[1:36:14] tonight the rich man's wealth is his
[1:36:17] strong City the destruction of the poor
[1:36:19] is their poverty so see a rich man he
[1:36:22] trusts in his wealth like it's a strong
[1:36:24] City armed I've got all this protection
[1:36:26] around me right I got all this security
[1:36:29] I'm so stable I'm so secure the Bible
[1:36:32] said a rich man's wealth this is a
[1:36:33] strong City and as in high wall in his
[1:36:36] own conceit or imagination see his he's
[1:36:39] just imagine he's got this money but
[1:36:41] he's just imagining that he's safe but
[1:36:43] he doesn't even understand his life is
[1:36:45] in the hand of God before destruction
[1:36:48] the heart of the man is hearty and
[1:36:50] before honor is humility a man the
[1:36:54] church have you been humbled lately
[1:36:55] guess what there's some honor coming for
[1:36:57] you down the road
[1:36:58] amen God's gonna honor you amen God my
[1:37:00] honor you and your own life God might

[1:38:07] justified by faith we have peace with
[1:38:10] God through our Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:38:13] if we've been baptized and if we believe
[1:38:16] in Jesus Christ the Bible said we have
[1:38:18] peace with God amen let's not feel like
[1:38:21] we're fighting a war against God when
[1:38:23] the Bible says if we believe and we've
[1:38:25] been baptized and justified in the name
[1:38:27] of Jesus we have peace with God through
[1:38:29] our Lord Jesus Christ amen and the Bible
[1:38:34] said God keeps you in perfect peace when
[1:38:35] you keep your mind on him think about
[1:38:37] him all day long
[1:38:38] I was driving today to recycle and get
[1:38:40] milk I'm I'm just the prisoner to Christ

[1:38:45] time is that how you offer I'm going to
[1:38:47] get milk I'm going to recycle all this
[1:38:48] cardboard you know and all I can think

[1:38:52] is wonderful praise the Lord
[1:38:53] oh yeah if I even tried to think about
[1:38:55] something else it always comes back to
[1:38:56] Jesus because he keeps us in perfect
[1:39:00] peace we learned not to worry we learned
[1:39:02] not to fret we learned not to be
[1:39:03] discouraged by keeping perfect peace
[1:39:06] hearts by trusting in the Lord and yeah
[1:39:11] we got a city and we also got a strong
[1:39:13] tower it's the name of Jesus Christ the
[1:39:15] name of the Lord is a strong tower the
[1:39:18] righteous run into it and is safe our
[1:39:21] security is so much greater than the
[1:39:24] rich man's Amen this is just made up
[1:39:26] it's imagination its conceit and pride
[1:39:29] but ours is the name and power of
[1:39:31] Almighty God amen that's our strong
[1:39:34] tower tonight huh
[1:39:36] I'm feeling good I finally feel like
[1:39:37] preaching now amen glory
[1:39:40] thank you Jesus amen the strong tower
[1:39:43] riches profit not in the day of wrath
[1:39:47] but righteousness deliver from death
[1:39:52] either trust
[1:39:54] his riches shall fall but the righteous
[1:39:56] shall flourish as a branch remember
[1:39:58] Steve Jobs the Apple founder he was
[1:40:01] telling people I think it's in his
[1:40:02] autobiography he was saying I have all
[1:40:04] these billions of dollars and I can't
[1:40:06] even cure this little you just liver
[1:40:07] lung cancer liver cancer that he had
[1:40:09] what good is all these billions of
[1:40:11] dollar gonna do when they can't deliver
[1:40:13] you in the day of your death
[1:40:15] oh my and thank God we got a God who can
[1:40:18] deliver us amen a God who will deliver
[1:40:21] from death hell and the grave amen
[1:40:24] we have such profit in faith there's
[1:40:27] such benefits to being a Christian
[1:40:29] hallelujah that they don't have oh god
[1:40:32] help us to remember all his benefits
[1:40:34] I like this there is that scattereth and
[1:40:38] yet increaseth see if you scatter all
[1:40:40] these seeds you'll increase and there is
[1:40:42] that withholdeth more than it's meat but
[1:40:45] at end to the poverty here it is people
[1:40:48] now this is what people are that's what
[1:40:50] we should be we should be givers we
[1:40:51] should be increasing our scattering all
[1:40:53] the time helping people helping people
[1:40:55] but see when we withhold more than we
[1:40:58] should you ever feel that little check
[1:41:00] like I should have gave a little more
[1:41:03] anybody ever felt that you don't raise
[1:41:05] your hand but see that's what the Bible
[1:41:07] says he that withholdeth more than meet
[1:41:10] attended the poverty see we got to be
[1:41:13] sensitive to how much you want me to
[1:41:15] give Lord how much should I give because
[1:41:20] we don't want to give less than we
[1:41:22] should because the Bible says we'll end
[1:41:23] up when to paying for it we have to be
[1:41:26] sense of an Oh Lord how much can I
[1:41:28] afford how much should I give how many
[1:41:32] want to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit
[1:41:33] in that I do I don't want to give under
[1:41:36] I want to give exactly what the Lord
[1:41:38] would have me to give this is beautify
[1:41:40] don't know none of them none of probably
[1:41:42] member when I preach on this I preach a
[1:41:44] whole series on Nehemiah Esther all
[1:41:50] those I can't they can't they go now Joe
[1:41:52] can't member now the whole series zoobel
[1:41:56] Zechariah Hagee I preached this whole
[1:41:58] series Hagee I was rebuking the people
[1:42:02] because they spent more money on their
[1:42:04] house than God's house did you know that
[1:42:08] everybody know that the Bible the
[1:42:11] history says they went sixteen years
[1:42:13] from the the time the government shut
[1:42:16] down zerubabbel until the time Haggai
[1:42:18] and Zechariah started prophesying to
[1:42:20] rebuild the house rebuild the temple
[1:42:21] finish the temple finish the walls they
[1:42:24] spent 16 years doing nothing and God
[1:42:26] said this God said is it time for you o
[1:42:29] you to dwell in your sealed houses and
[1:42:32] this house lay it like waste till you
[1:42:36] got a nice pretty house at home but the
[1:42:38] house of God is in shambles
[1:42:40] now therefore saith the Lord of hosts
[1:42:42] consider your ways you have sold much
[1:42:44] and bringing little so see God was
[1:42:46] making them not so prosperous because
[1:42:48] they were neglecting the house of God
[1:42:51] you eat but you have not enough you
[1:42:53] drink but are not filled with drink you
[1:42:55] clothed you but there's none warm and he
[1:42:57] the earnest wages earnest wages to put
[1:42:59] it in a bag with holes thus saith the
[1:43:05] Lord God of hosts consider your ways go
[1:43:07] up to the mountain and bring down wooden
[1:43:09] skies like go get some wood bring it
[1:43:10] down to the house and I'll take pleasure
[1:43:12] and I'll be glorified saith the Lord so
[1:43:15] go work go finish the house of God you
[1:43:19] look for much and lo it came too little
[1:43:20] and when you brought it home I did blow
[1:43:22] upon it why so once they did it that God
[1:43:24] blew it down why because of my house is
[1:43:28] laid waste and ye run every man to his
[1:43:30] own house now Church most of us do good
[1:43:33] job with ties and offers I'm just saying
[1:43:35] this is what God will do to people when
[1:43:37] they neglect the house of God right I'm
[1:43:41] thankful for all that you give I'm
[1:43:42] thankful for your giving I try to give
[1:43:43] as much as I can to to the church ties
[1:43:45] that offerings I try to give as much as
[1:43:47] I can but look at God's attitude towards
[1:43:50] whose house should be first God's house
[1:43:53] should be first and if not gonna put
[1:43:55] holes in your little bag of money oh my
[1:43:59] how many one honor the Lord with all of
[1:44:01] our firstfruits of our substance amen
[1:44:04] the sleep of a labouring man is sweet
[1:44:06] whether he eat little or much so but the
[1:44:09] abundance of the rich will not suffer
[1:44:11] him to sleep so you see the stress that
[1:44:12] rich people get under that's why that
[1:44:14] was such a great prayer don't make me
[1:44:16] rich don't make me poor so I can at
[1:44:18] least sleep at night
[1:44:20] remember that's why Michael Jackson died
[1:44:23] remember that he died because he
[1:44:25] couldn't sleep because of all the demons
[1:44:26] that he let into his life and the man
[1:44:28] kept giving him that propofol or
[1:44:29] whatever it was and eventually gave him
[1:44:31] too much and he died because he couldn't
[1:44:33] sleep at night because of all the demon
[1:44:34] torment a Yeti is one of the richest men
[1:44:36] in the world they sold off his Munich
[1:44:39] music catalog for fifty billion dollars
[1:44:41] after he died and he couldn't sleep at
[1:44:44] night how blessed you are if you can
[1:44:46] sleep tonight I just put an app on my
[1:44:48] phone actually know how much I sleep
[1:44:50] every night now so I can rejoice and say
[1:44:52] thank you lord
[1:44:52] nine hours eight hours last night I got
[1:44:54] six hours but I want to get up early and
[1:44:56] study and pray this morning so I'm still
[1:44:58] feeling good by God's grace but see the
[1:45:01] rich they hardly can sleep they're so
[1:45:02] stressed out about their money that's
[1:45:05] right that's how we know word in our
[1:45:07] flesh if we're stressing out over money
[1:45:13] charge them that are
[1:45:15] in this world which some of us are
[1:45:17] medium some of us are close to being
[1:45:18] rich perhaps that they be not
[1:45:20] high-minded nor trust in uncertain
[1:45:22] riches don't trust in them but in the
[1:45:25] Living God who giveth us richly all
[1:45:26] things to enjoy they that do good that
[1:45:31] they be rich in good works ready to
[1:45:33] distribute willing to communicate so see
[1:45:35] if you're richer we got a lot of money
[1:45:37] we got to be ready to do good we've got
[1:45:39] to be we've got to do good because when
[1:45:41] we do it we're laying up in store for
[1:45:43] themselves a good foundation against the
[1:45:45] time to come that they may lay hold on
[1:45:47] eternal life amen
[1:45:49] see that people will be able to possess
[1:45:51] eternal life because they were ready to
[1:45:53] give to others if we give to others God
[1:45:55] will give us eternal life hey man that's
[1:45:59] the Word of God and be thou diligent you
[1:46:02] know the state of thy flocks and look
[1:46:05] well till I heard let's stand I'm gonna
[1:46:06] I better stop let's say into our feet
[1:46:08] here
[1:46:08] be thou diligent to know the state of
[1:46:10] thy flocks and look well to thy herds
[1:46:14] for riches are not forever and Duff the
[1:46:18] crown endure to every generation no does
[1:46:22] it I'm gonna skip this part but God only
[1:46:24] asked you to give out of your ability
[1:46:26] God's not gonna ask you to give
[1:46:27] something you don't have God's only
[1:46:29] gonna ask us to give what we do have I'm
[1:46:31] gonna skip all that I got all these
[1:46:32] scriptures on this I'm gonna skip that
[1:46:34] I'm gonna go right to the end
[1:46:36] did you know brother Branham said he
[1:46:38] gave ten or twenty thousand dollars to
[1:46:42] people over the years
[1:46:44] guess how much that is today if you do
[1:46:47] the inflation calculator at this
[1:46:49] government website if he gave anywhere
[1:46:51] from ten to twenty thousand dollars
[1:46:53] he gave anywhere from eighty two
[1:46:55] thousand dollars to one hundred sixty
[1:46:57] six thousand dollars away he gave that
[1:46:59] away brother Branham did now what kind
[1:47:04] of life did he live did he live a life
[1:47:05] that was where the gospel absolutely
[1:47:08] over the years so let's say you make
[1:47:10] fifty thousand a year you tithe five
[1:47:11] thousand maybe you give a you know
[1:47:13] thousand of offering I don't know
[1:47:16] multiply five thousand time in ten years
[1:47:18] right well after 10 years you give him
[1:47:19] fifty thousand dollars to God and this
[1:47:25] is what he gave
[1:47:26] he said just the people that would come
[1:47:27] to the door he said like a man that says
[1:47:29] I need any tires
[1:47:31] he said there's ten or twenty thousand
[1:47:33] dollars on the books from these years
[1:47:35] that I'd give out like that people just
[1:47:37] come to his house and ask for things 20
[1:47:39] I'm sorry 10 to 20 which was 82 to a
[1:47:42] hundred sixty-six thousand he just gave
[1:47:44] away and you know I program did that
[1:47:48] because he was a righteous man the
[1:47:50] righteous consider the cause of the poor
[1:47:53] but the wicked regardeth not to know it
[1:47:55] I don't want to hear about your
[1:47:56] complaining I've got money problems - I
[1:47:59] don't want to hear about it
[1:48:00] see that's wicked we should try to give
[1:48:04] if we have it to give remember there's a
[1:48:06] time to get a time to lose a time to
[1:48:09] keep and a time to cast away we cast our
[1:48:14] bread upon the waters the Bible said to
[1:48:15] return to you at the right time that is
[1:48:20] everything okay back there huh okay all
[1:48:23] right I didn't know if there's okay
[1:48:24] thank you in closing we need to see
[1:48:29] Jesus in our poor friends because the
[1:48:32] Bible said he that hath pity upon the
[1:48:34] poor lendeth unto the Lord
[1:48:36] so when you give to that poor person
[1:48:38] it's like giving to God God's right
[1:48:41] there Jesus is right there like lending
[1:48:43] to God and that which he hath given will
[1:48:47] he pay him again how many have seen that
[1:48:48] to be true you give to the poor God will
[1:48:50] bless you some time later on there'll be
[1:48:52] a season where you get blessed Jesus
[1:48:56] told the disciples he said if even you
[1:48:59] give a cup of water unto the little
[1:49:01] child in the name of a disciple you'll
[1:49:03] have a reward remember Jesus gives
[1:49:08] eternal life to those who are who fed
[1:49:09] the hungry who gave clothes to the naked
[1:49:13] housed the stranger and visited the sick
[1:49:17] in the prison the sick in the hospital
[1:49:19] is in prison Jesus gave eternal life to
[1:49:22] them
[1:49:25] remember the prob
[1:49:27] one woman she stretched out her hand to
[1:49:28] the poor she reaches forth her hands to
[1:49:30] the needy many daughters have done
[1:49:33] virtuously but she's excels Imam I don't
[1:49:36] know I love this I know the Lord will
