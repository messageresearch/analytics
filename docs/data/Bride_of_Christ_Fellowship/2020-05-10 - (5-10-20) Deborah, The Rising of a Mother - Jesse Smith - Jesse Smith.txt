bless your people especially our buttons on this may give you all the glory in Jesus Christ let's go to judges chapter 5 here and then we'll read our memory verse from our sister Karen so we thank the Lord for that judges 5:7 I like to preach on Deborah this morning Deborah the rising of a mother let's preach on that this morning by God's grace and then we will look to our memory verses well judges 5 7 judges five seven I'll read this myself and then we'll read our memory verse together praise God judges 5 verse 7 the inhabitants of the villages ceased they ceased in Israel until that I arose I Deborah arose that I arose a mother in Israel let's go to Isaiah chapter 12 verse 2 Isaiah 12 verse 2 as he had 12 verse to read verses 2 to 5 let's read this together on three one two three behold god is my salvation i will trust and not be afraid for the lord jehovah is my strength and my song he also is become my salvation therefore with joy shall ye draw water out of the wells of salvation and in that day shall ye say praise the lord call upon his name declare his doings among the people make mention that his name is exalted sing unto the Lord for he hath done excellent things this is known in all the earth and the Saints said Amen god bless you bein seated to praise the Lord so again we're thankful again for all the mothers Lord bless you we thought we'd do a little bit extra decorating today you know it never did that before if some yesterday I'm just like well I don't know when I go buy some decorations for the moms so we're very thankful for the moms and all of our sisters and the mothers to be we believe and who knows which one these little ones are raised up and be mothers and we always want them to know that it's an honorable godly thing to be a real godly mother and we thank God for that for the random calls her the fifth gospel we're familiar with that she's the one that gets them first she gets to put that first eternal imprint on their character praise God and before the teachers get them but even before dad gets him you know as according to the you know Old Testament Hebrew you know patterns of life and the raising of the children you know the tutoring and so forth and then the adoptions according to you know to Galatians three and four speaks of that but we're so thankful for our mothers and may the Lord bless ya this you know I thought studying yesterday I just kind of felt led to look at Deborah so Lord willing we'll look at her life today I don't think I've ever preached on Deborah as far as like a whole sermons this be my first one by God's grace I preached on Leah a couple years ago that was a real blessing and looking forward to this thought here I got numerous notes you know just as they come I try to write them down as quick as possible and look to the Lord here so Deborah the rising of a mother she was a godly woman who really rose up at a time when the people needed a mother and will look to that here we'll we'll just start with the quotes of brother Branham and maybe some background on Deborah and then we'll go what an Lord willing with the scriptures all about her life there's not a whole lot but it's in chapters 4 and 5 of Judges such a godly woman but you remember here Deborah was about twelve hundred years before Christ about 200 years before David right after the generation of Joshua had died off and remember let's go to judges chapter one though let's read a little bit from here so you can kind of you know rehearse some of these conditions to see the hour that that she was living in as you're turning to judges one I kind of referenced these scriptures a few months ago as we were looking at brother Branham as a prophet and and some of the disagreements people have with him and a lot of the misunderstandings they have with brother Branham how how someone can be given thus saith the Lord and it's it's it's a direction from God it's a it's a command of God but if they disobey it then they miss out on God's blessings and that would be different as far as you know that kind of dust saith the Lord will be different from something where it's absolutely going to come to pass and so that that deals in with the thought as the Lord has been dealing with me lately with the will of God there are some things with the will of God that are absolutely going to happen because God has decreed it in his will and then there's other parts of the word of will of God that are we say unknown right there's like a known will of God that we know this is absolutely going to happen like the Millenium like the rapture praise God like the future home that's absolutely the will of God it's it's known it's going to happen but there are other things that are unknown that are left up to man's choice in other words man cannot stop the rapture praise God amen evil men cannot stop the rapture praise God evil men cannot stop Israel returning to her homeland praise God or the millennium the millennial reign of Jesus Christ he will reign with a rod of iron over every nation and righteousness will be declared from sea to shining sea praise God the whole world will be ruled by Jesus the son of David there's nothing they can do it's the known will of God there's nothing that can be done with that praise God but there are promises given to individuals that are with the unknown will of God as far as men has a choice in it a man every man remember the Bible said it's God's will that all men will be saved right but not all men will be saved we know that we know Jesus said few there be that find it so there's a will of God that's immutable unchangeable it will no one can stop it but then there's a will of God that God leaves up to mankind and man has the choice whether he can accept God's will or turn down God's will in fact remember you remember from Matthew 7 on the Sermon on the Mount where Jesus said many will come to me and say Lord Lord have we not done many miracles and cast out devils and Jesus said I never knew you because you didn't do the will of God praise God they were workers of iniquity they loved the anointing while it was on them at the church service but outside of that they didn't live true to God's Word and Jesus calls that workers of iniquity so really there are three kinds of Christians right there's the wise the foolish and the imposters there's three kinds of Christians praise God and the workers of iniquity are the imposters they act like it for a time but they disobey the will of God and and they will not be saved the workers of iniquity but remember in the times the judges they had God's promise it was a it was a conditional promise to Joshua where God told Joshua you'll possess all these lands wherever you put your foot on you'll possess it and he gave them the borders from the sea all the way for the western border to the sea all the way to the eastern border by the river Jordan he gave him the whole borders but the Bible said that they never achieved those borders because of their disobedience that's right and so they had disobeyed the word of the Lord now look at verse let's go to chapter judges chapter 1 here I'm right there some of these are just for reviewing them for you look at verse 19 judges 1:19 and the Lord was with Judah and he drove out the inhabitants of the mountain but could not drive out the inhabitants of the valley because they had chariots of iron and they gave had brought unto Caleb as Moses said and he expelled thence the three sons of anak a church did you ever stop to think about that what do you mean God's not powerful enough to drive out a chariot ever thought about that of course God is able to drive out chariots but because of the people's lack of faith right what's a chariot to God right God form the iron that made the chariot a chariot is nothing in the hand of God against God so see all these scriptures have to fit into this this understanding that that God had given them power to drive out all the inhabitants but if they weren't driven out it wasn't God's fault it was the people's failure praise God look at verse 21 the children of Benjamin did not drive out the Jebusites that inhabited Jerusalem but the Jebusites dwell with the children of Benjamin in Jerusalem unto this day they go down to verse 27 neither did man asked to drive out the inhabitants of Beth she and her towns nor Dana and her towns northern heaviness of door in her towns northern heaviness of him in her towns northern habits of Meg Megiddo and her towns but the K Knights would dwell in that land and it came to pass when Israel was strong that they put the Canaanites a tribute and did not utterly drive them out so they they could have driven them out but they did it they put him on tribute my so now look at this even the amorite were bossing around the children of Dan how is that possible how is it that God's children are pushed around by heathens that wasn't God's will but it was allowed because of their unbelief verse 34 and the amorite forced the churn of Dan into the mountain for they would not suffer them to go down to the valley or what what do you mean are you serious God's people being pushed around by the enemy God had already told him you will not be the tail you'll be the head but that was based upon conditions praise God amen they had to obey the conditions of the word and if they obeyed the conditions in other words God was could only do in their lives but they let God do praise God same thing is today hallelujah God can only do in our lives what we allow him to do praise God through obedience and through submission and through his leadership and through the will of God amen now look at verse chapter two let's go to chapter two now in chapter 2 verses 1 2 & 3 the Bible said they begin making covenants with them God didn't want him to make covenants with the enemy he wanted them to have no covenants he'd already given them all those 460 years oh wow Israel was in Egypt he given him all of that space to repent and that's the reason he sent them back was to drive them out to drive out the inhabitants the land because they were evil they they put their own children in the fires the Bible said they were evil - they were abortionist right there were evil men and women there were heathens did awful unspeakable evils and God said that's the very reason I'm setting you in there he said you're gonna be my light to the nation's amen hallelujah Israel was to be the light to the nation's so are you jesus said you are the light of the world amen a city on the hill cannot be hidden people look at our lives and they should see the light and the love and the power of God amen we are the light of this world praise God just as Israel was the light now the bride is the light of the world now to go down to verse 10 this is how sad their condition got they started they started making leagues with them they could have driven them out but they didn't these are people that only wanted partial victories from the Word of God they were okay with just getting a little bit of victory and said but they still wouldn't have their sin on the side oh let that not be our testimony today praise God let's let's ask for a full victory praise God let's ask for a full healing let's ask for a life let's live a life that's fully devoted to God's will amen verse 10 of chapter 2 after Joshua died and also that generation were gathered unto their fathers and there arose another generation after them which knew not the Lord nor yet the works which he had done for Israel now you have a strange scripture here it seems that the next generation that rises up doesn't know what God's done so it makes it seem like the previous generation the original generation got a little relaxed as they got older right now of course the Bible said God will never leave himself without a witness so there was witnesses there and Deborah was one of them praise God amen all these judges in each generation God never left himself without a witness there was always somebody he could get his hand on that would believe the word that would deliver the people praise God amen but a lot of them even that came through the Bible said the next generation didn't know the works of the Lord so somebody started letting down the bar praise God and I got to remind myself at some point we have to have another testimony service where everybody can tell their testimonies because these children need to know what God has done in our lives I want to hear it again sister Karen for the hostei I want to hear it again praise God sister Beatrice of God will help you to share your testimonies times you know that God has moved in a supernatural way the next generation needs to know and it's it's not their opportunist panse ability it's our responsibility see part of that responsibility was on the previous generation too make sure they knew his remember God told him in Deuteronomy 6 he said you father's diligently train your children talk to them about the Lord when you rise up when you lay down when you go out to work when you come in right at the dinner table talk about the Lord amen he said put it on your fence outside your house like a word of the Lord in other words decorate your home with the things of God amen see there's a responsibility but this generation rose up and they didn't know the Lord look at verse 19 write 16 says nevertheless God still raised up judges to deliver them every couple of years it seemed like you know fifty years forty years there was different time periods where they would and then they would verse 17 they would always disobey the judges um they went a whoring after other gods and by themselves and then the Lord verse 18 would keep raising up more judges let's read 18 and when the Lord raised them up judges then the Lord was with the judge and delivered them on the hand of their enemies all the days of the judge for repented the Lord because of their groanings by reason of them that oppressed them and vexed them amen look at that church God was so great when he could find one person in this case one woman all the other judges were men but God just tried to find one loyal person and he used that person and annoyed them and raised them up and that person would deliver God's people and then the rest of the life of that judge the people were free amen most of them were they men would go back in the world but God would still honor the life and testimony of that original judge because he had a testimony that please God amen now look at that the rest of the people benefited a lot of them didn't take advantage of it and serve God could I just Jose can I just share your testimony real quick about that Perry green thing so you know sister Karen sat under brother and Brenda did you sit under Peregrine too for years so was a godly man he passed away a few years ago really godly man here his whole ministry was getting the people to see a prophet had come he was always pointing to the Prophet always everything it was God sent a prophet God sent a prophet and I'm glad he did praise God well you know Karen had told us different testimonies brother peregrina had to have different supernatural things one of them was his testimony of God telling him to take his hands off the the drivers wheel and the car drove itself for many miles wasn't it about six hours he watched God steer his car now that's a good testimony right there powerful testimony well Jose was sick this week brother right and he's watching a brother peregrines testimony on YouTube and he's got a very bad headache and he goes to sleep and brother Jose has a dream now it's strange he sees a Perry green like kinda like dead in his coffin at his funeral but then later in the dream he sees Perry green come pray over Jose cuz he's got a headache and when he woke up his headache was gone now now I told her the hose I think that's a great I think that's God's showing brother Jose and all of us that God honors his servants because Perry green he's passed on he can't pray for anybody now when it's to me it's showing that God was with that man in that ministry and brother Perry green he stood against the tape ministry to the tape he sure did they didn't like him I've got videos on that he knew because brother Perry green knew he was with brother branham on all those meetings he knew brother man was not for playing tapes he was from live man anointed with God's Spirit preaching God's Word because that was Paul's pattern but just that's an example it just came to me Rosie that's an example of God just blessing the people showing them that God was with that original man see God was with brother green and God gave a vindication of that this week just another one like you know just for us I think that's a great testimony so it was in the days of judges everybody would be blessed for the next 40 50 years because of one man or woman's obedience to God's Word and so we find here now I want to read a scripture to show you this here judges 17:6 I'm skipping ahead but I just want to read a scripture because it helps us understand the book of Judges in those days there was no king in Israel when every man did that which was right in his eyes there's no king all's they had was brother bang just judges and every town their little judges and we'll get to that a little bit because Moses actually established that before he died Moses established it and even Joshua established that there was to be judges if there was no prophet there hadn't been a judge like we have today right you get in trouble you got to go see the judge in Akron you get in trouble uh Columbus you got to go to see the judge in Columbus so there was local judges it's an exodus 21 that God originally called men to judge in Moses's time I'm gonna read Exodus 18:21 moreover thou shall provide out of all them able men such as fear God men of truth hating covetousness and the sad part is we got a bunch of judges today that are political right yeah they'll take a bribe from a Republican they'll take a bribe from a Democrat shame on any politician that will do that God said a real judge is impartial he don't favor anybody but God God and God's Word amen he said hating covetousness and place such over them to be rulers of thousands and thrillers of hundreds rulers of fifties and rulers of ten and let them judge the people at all seasons and it shall be that every great matter they shall bring unto thee now this is of course just Jethro giving Moses wisdom he got overloaded with all the cases so God sends our God anoints Moses and then Moses chooses men and raises them up to be judges over the thousands and hundreds and so forth also in numbers eleven he looked at this a few weeks ago Moses is so over overwhelmed with all the burden of these two million or more by this time three million four million he's so burned he said God did I beget all these children and God said okay I'll send the Holy Spirit the same spirit on you on seventy other men and they will judge you he said I'm sorry they will judge the people rather and it was men every time it was men right the Bible said the Lord came down in the cloud and numbers 11:25 and spake on him and took the spirit that was upon him and gave it unto the seventy elders and it came to pass that when the spirit rested on them they prophesied and did not cease and I remember we use a scripture last week to show taking sides with Jesus how program said this is God's system God takes the same spirit that's on the leader or the starter of the movement and puts it on other men that follow him and how do you know they got the right spirit because they say what the original man said praise God it's very easy amen what did Paul say that's what we're going back to right we're trusting that brother man preached what Paul preached and we we can trust it because we can go look and find it in the Bible and so that's God's system today he takes his spirit and puts it on that original man and then shares it with other faithful men that will point right back to the Word of God now Church a judge had supreme authority look at Deuteronomy 17 12 and the man that will do presumptuously and will not hearken under the priests that stand at the minister before the LORD thy God or unto the judge even that man shall die and thou shalt put away that evil from Israel so church a priest or a judge had power of life and death kind like today right so this was not a small job this was not a job of little responsibility this was a job where lives hang in the balance Futures families destinies right consequences hang in the balance of a judge right before his death joshua continued the judges system in joshua 23 - and joshua called for all israel for the elders for their heads and for their judges and for their officers and send them i am old and stricken of age i'm skipping down to verse 10 one man of you shall chase a thousand so he's speaking to men judges that are meant for the lord your god he it is that fighteth for you as he hath promised you amen so before God dies I'm sorry before Joshua dies God can die before Joshua dies he gathers all the men and tells them you must judge and one of you if you obey God's Word will chase a thousand praise God so judge is not only a great Authority they had great supernatural ability if the people would just believe amen I don't know if the people just obeyed God's Word and and respected the judges then one man would chase a thousand enemies away praise God that's beautiful what a promise now I want to make sure I read a couple of more scriptures here because there's a lot I want to say about this topic here so judges here were gift with or they were gifted with truth the Holy Spirit anointed a judge to be able to discern truth that's that's what the word discernment means right judge November Hebrews 4:12 says the Word of God is quick and powerful and is a discerner of the thoughts and tends of the heart it means it's a judge of it this Holy Spirit will discern between right and wrong he's sure intention the right intention or is your intention the wrong intention remember we saw last week our brother Ram said the reason he wanted to open the winners and escape the people was kind of selfish because he wanted to go up there and do more hunting see the angel discerned his motivations hope that doesn't sell anybody but see the whole the Word of God will always discern truth from air the right motivation from the wrong motivation the Word of God will always discern that and then reveal what's right or wrong and give you a choice that's why sermons sometimes will be directly right at you to show you which choice to make it's exactly what you're going through that's so you can make the right decision because that's what God's word comes to do it comes to rightly divide soul and spirit okay this is a soul matter this is a spirit matter here's right or wrong make the right choice it's simple right God makes it simple for us he makes it so simple that that the only way we wouldn't do the will of God is if we don't want to do the will of God but God wants he he so loved the world that He sent His Son Jesus to save the world from condemnation he did it by his love Church and we could just see how much God loves us he's a God of justice but he loves us praise God and he's laying before us today life and death blessing and curse let's accept life that's acceptable assing amen that's always obey God's Word in every case as we get to Lord willing in the next few weeks and we look at the will of God there's a known will of God and then there's your unknown will of God and that's why the Holy Spirit sends gifts to help you with the unknown things you don't know well it's beautiful I've been looking at the scripture last few days you there is a known will of God we know exactly what God wants with so many things but then with other things we don't know and that's what must be sought for that's the will that's why we set the Bible says you set your face to seek God it's not for the things you already know it's for the things you don't know praise God and so a judge was called of God with great responsibility now remember a judge was not a prophet right like a leader of what I mean like how Moses led the people Moses had all kinds of people raised up against him I was looking through that my notes about this remember his is Moses's brother and sister Aaron and Miriam making fun of who he married and God said what do you think Moses says you think he's just like a common person and I show dreams he said he's my prophet and I'll speak to him lip to ear how dare you speak and mock my prophet you know the Bible said God was really angry with Aaron for that he didn't live much longer him and Mirim did not live much longer after that Miriam Cork's got leprosy I don't know why Aaron in it but maybe she was more harsh with her her mocking I'm not sure but the Bible said that God was angry with them and so see you know and the Bible called Miriam a prophetess so there were signs Miriam would say thus saith the Lord and would come to pass now look Church we got to be careful not to let people or even brother Graham become common to us because Moses got so common well he's our brother he's our little brother I prophesied look God look what God did they're mean I'm OC they let Moses become too common and God had to show him you must always show respect for the servant of God God will honor those who respect and honor him Church in number 16 the Levites and Korah sought the priesthood from Aaron uh there was uh yeah and then Nathan member Kaur and Dathan and then there was Balaam there was all kinds of different prophets in that time that we're all trying to compete and and try to throw the people off but like with the Bible said the two that were faithful were Caleb and Joshua now why were they thankful the Bible said because they had a different spirit of them praise God amen didn't have to worry about them falling away why because they were real believers and the same as today don't worry about real people falling away the real Lex will never fall away they'll be like Caleb and Joshua they'll recognize the true ministry and they'll support that with all they got and they'll never fall away praise God yet there was a Balaam rose up he had some supernatural Korah Dathan different people everybody there was all these distractions all the time same thing today we have to stay with the Word of God that we know to be the revealed will of God Almighty praise God now let me read a few quotes here from brother Branham this is from if god be forced where be all the miracles I look he's laying out the condition of Deborah we're gonna start getting now two more on Deborah's life and testimony program said we're all acquainted with the judges of Israel how they had done the Israelites the Philistines and many nights em writes all the different ones had come in like locusts and just eat up what they had and take it out and go on but did you notice they cannot do that until Israel first fell away from God so Graham is gonna show how many times things happen in our lives because we're disobeying God he says the devil can't set a foot on you to hurt you until you first get away from God you first you must first remember that check when anything happens see if you're in the faith or not see that if your right to the place with God then remember the devil can do you no harm you're in Christ of course even this must be balanced right because Paul he was right with God but he said getting that satanic buffeting messenger remember that it's I Corinthians 12 so we have to so whenever bad things happen we have to examine ourselves and say is this because of my is this because of my mistake or is this God letting me go through a test to make me a better Christian hey men praise God said and a few years before this but now he's romance preaching on getting this sermon if God be with us where we all the miracles but he said a few years before Gideon there had been the prophetess Deborah and barek and how that she had prophesied and told them what to do and it was just exactly right Barrack the great warrior and how they made a song of the triumph over the enemy but as soon as they got out of that twist right straight back into the rut they went again oh how many people do we see it Church they'll get a little victory they'll come to church and be excited for a few weeks and then pretty soon they don't see him anymore what happened this is what happened they weren't they never got the spirit of the revival all the way in them praise God they got a little bit of victory they got a little bit of excitement a little bit of blessing but they never continued in until that blessing lived in them every single day in other words they might have got justified but they never got sanctified hi he said if that isn't the picture of the church today just as soon as it gets out of one twist right into another one it goes but the time had come for action now get talking about Gideon he said that's the same now the time has come for action the time has come when playing Church had to become to a halt with God there's a woman this week that emailed me and said I listen to tapes all the time I tried to the best I can't have been baptized but I can't get the Holy Ghost and I said you got to get down to business with God when I got the Holy Ghost I would go to church and just pray before the service and I was just looking for God to fill me all the time when I was at home I wait till people left I go up in my closet and just prayed say God fill me with the Holy Ghost you got to be you got to be longing for it you got to be under expectation if people aren't getting fairness because they're not obeying all the Word of God because the Bible said I'll freely give you a gift if you just obey God's Word the Bible said acts 5:32 he gives the Holy Ghost to them that obey so there's a reason if we're not born again it's because we got to obey the Word of God we got to really believe God got to confess anything wrong in our lives now let's look at this thought here I want to read this quote from brother Branham Deborah being a judge was like a politician today like a woman politician today or woman judge today right that really wasn't her place because by scripture all the judges were supposed to be men but as you'll see there was nobody else that could do it right that's why God allowed it it wasn't God's perfect will God's perfect will would have been the people just stayed on fire and all the men and leadership would have been on fire and serving God but the Bible said they went a whoring after after every victory once life got easy then they went in the sin a church that's the danger for message people - once we get a few victories we got to stay dedicated to God we got to keep praying gonna keep reading your Bible keep studying keep serving God keep asking questions about the Word of God keep going in the Word of God keep hungry and thirsty when things get easy it's not the time to relax it's the time to grow more in love with God that's always that was always Israel's problem they get a few victories things get easy they go back into sin because I read you the scriptures you saw Joshua numbers 11 number Exodus 18 every time God talked about judges it was always to be men now program as is asked I'm sorry no brother man tells a story about a woman rebuking him for not accepting women preachers don't read this quote to you here real quick said oh now he's talking about the initial evidence ain't speaking in tongues then he's against women preachers and this was a woman preacher so a woman preacher come against brother Branham and he says now I was eating breakfast with them and they said brother bran look at this would you think it and pulled out a letter and I said well sister she don't understand the boys told me their mother was a woman preacher she didn't go for the message and now she says in there now he said women shouldn't not have authority over man because that's what first Timothy 2 says right now they said brother how about Phoebe in the Bible Paul's helper because member Phoebe was a helper to Paul in the gospel but Ram says certainly she was a seller of goods and Paul asked the people he said do you think Paul would say let the women keep sign on the churches not permitted them to speak and turn around say now Phoebe our helper in the gospel she's gonna preach a few nights he said that was contradict himself remember Paul's letters got shared with everybody did you know in Peters last letter Peter said everybody knew he knew all of Paul's letters were Scripture did you know that Paul said Peter sent some of them are hard to understand he gets in those mysteries and those deep types of you know allegories of Ishmael and and and Isaac and all these types of Sarah and Hagar he gets in these deep mysteries but what he says is right so he says what about Phoebe so see all the churches would have read where Paul said I don't forbid a woman to preach the gospel to men so they said well brother man what about Deborah she was one of the judges in the Bible a woman was a judge in the Bible if that's not a thority over man now church in one way it was it just be like going to the judge the if you went to the judge today he or she would have authority over you well Graham says they said brother man that always puzzled me I said why sister why would you that puzzle you said well because a woman judge brother man said I said that's politics not the church okay so Deborah was in political power right judge power not Church power he said not the church they don't have one thing to do with the church Paul said let them be under obedience as saith the law and the law can't put a woman up to be a priest can't put it up you never seen a woman high priest you never seen a woman a priest nowhere in the Bible you never seen a woman a preacher in the Bible certainly so everybody can see that Wow the Bible said Deborah sat under a tree and people would come and she'd listen their story and then she would judge it and tell him exactly what to do and the Bible said it was right every time right but that but while that was going on Israel had a priesthood in a church going on she wasn't in the temple or she wasn't in the tent to praise God she wasn't over there in the tent and and ministering and going into the holy place or anything like that she was wet she wasn't even a part of that she sat in her courthouse and judged the people she wasn't in the house of God and a good point is that remember this is a time when the people were back slid every other judge was a man except one woman thank God for though she was a godly woman wonderful testimony powerful so you have that the Word of God never made a woman a priest shies away from handling the Word of God but in a time when the the church was at its lowest ebb didn't have a prophet didn't have a real leadership didn't have a king to really establish the leadership then God used a woman because nobody else would do it praise God I say the same today God will use anybody who's willing to serve Him God will use a lukewarm foolish virgin I should they look for lukewarm I said God will use a foolish virgin woman preacher if the man won't rise up and do it you say prove that I'll be happy too in 1953 brother and prayed for a woman who was a woman preacher and God healed her and God never rebuked her for preaching you know why because God had already rebuked everyone brother Brian was preaching it and God knew she probably wouldn't repent but when it came down to divine healing God healed the woman look up brother BAM said he said now all right come lady you believe me to be God's prophet prophet means preacher you understand that the reason you believe because you're a preacher yourself well isn't that right that's right yes ma'am you have female trouble of low blood and you're a minister is that right you're healed in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ be made well what what see someone loves me and that could be a surprise because we know it's absolutely against what he preached but under that anointing member God is not a respecter of persons praise God if that woman needed faith for healing or I'm sorry that woman had faith for healing and she comes on the same ground as brother Branham or any other preacher God is obligated to his word he has to heal her if it's her faith believes in divine healing a woman minister healed under the prophets message absolutely absolutely we know uh you know there was many people that were healed right that weren't fully true to God's Word God can heal anybody as long as they believe praise God and so see Deborah was was was living at a time I'll say like this where was her husband I'm sure he was a good man I'm sure but why wasn't he the judge men were the leaders of the family where's her husband well he just was just got a little pushover maybe he should have been there or another man in their little city there should have risen up but if nobody will rise up gotta look for a humble heart and he'll raise them up that ought to encourage you got to look at your situation see if nobody else can do it God used me I see this person needs help or if I can be a light there now I'm not saying break the word of God never break the word of God but if maybe you you you you usually wouldn't do something maybe it's like let's say for a sister maybe you wouldn't pray for the sick cuz you're just you know you want to lay hands on a man or yo that's fine but maybe God would anoint you to give him a prayer cloth so we must be open to God using us maybe if nobody else would do it you we can rise up in faith and say God used me I feel your anointing to do it so see brother Graham has to correct them it's not the priesthood it's political he said there was numerous prophetess Miriam different ones but a man says sometimes there were queens over them and so forth like that king and queen at the decease of the King the Queen had to take his place so they elected another King and so forth that's what brother Bram says sometimes women got put in those positions where they had to they had to rule they had to take authority until another man came now program makes a real striking statement here it's kind of harsh but he said we got a woman judge in the city he said that's the reason the city is so polluted now that might be hard for people to see but obviously brother Branham must have had some discernment to know she was a corrupt woman because we know God is the same yesterday today and forever right so Tucson was in bad condition because of the woman judge but Israel was in a good position because they had a woman judge are you with me everything Church Deborah was a good judge and God blessed that generation because of Deborah but now there's a woman judge in Tucson and she's awful Saint could there could there be the same thing today I believe it because listen could we have woman judge today that God would bless yes even if she's foolish virgin yes I believe that it's possible I believe it's the perfect will of God no but I believe God could use it for his glory why because he did it in the Old Testament never wasn't born again and the church said she wasn't born again yet God used her when there was nobody else so to rise up for righteousness let me use another example didn't God use lot as a judge was he'd on the same level as Abraham no no no but God use whoever would be a witness there praise God remember when Sarah Palin almost became vice-president member 2008 that was on that was all over the news I was a CNN video about it they asked they went on ask these different preachers you know how could you be a Christian and support Sarah Palin possibly in vice president and the man said it just shows the condition that America is in he said it's the same it's vody back I'm a good he's a good Baptist preacher right but he said it just shows America's in the same position as Israel I'm like that's nothing but the truth nothing but the truth because where's that the Prophet God's off the scene Alleluia praise God and I'll say like this if the brothers don't like the women being vice president why don't the brothers would go run for office right where's the men how come the men don't step up see it's not going to be those women fought if Deborah is that in Deborah generation though she won't be held accountable it really wasn't God's perfect will but at least she was willing to serve God amen remember in the days of Hezekiah church remember that he was 25 when he became King the Bible said as soon as he became king he clean up the house of God his dad and let the house of God go to waste the doors were falling off and there was idols everywhere and as soon as he became King where they met he broke down all the idols he smashed him to dust threw him in the river and clean it all up and the Bible said they held the feast I think it was the feast of Passover and the Bible said they were low on priests so they had to make some people priests who were not priests just for that situation and the Bible said God allowed it because they needed it God let men act as priests who were priests in order to handle the Word of God in order to handle the worship let the people worship the way he won them the worship raised God amen let me say like well I better not go there I don't want to go there there's a few things I what I was going to say was something like this like God may have churches where it looks like people are breaking the word and they probably are but it's because it's not there's no one else that could do it now what I mean by that and are probably not wise version they're probably foolish version but at least they're doing something for God I've never met many women preachers but although the denominational preachers I have met I've just tried to encourage them and share what I know and testify like the one time I was test to find that Lutheran preacher we just got out of the marriage or the wedding and I'm testifying and I was touched it was my wife soldiers and I said preacher I said God has been so good to me I said he delivered me from cigarettes he delivered me from chewing tobacco I set me free by the power of God I wasn't shouting like that but I'm getting excited now I was like he set me free he delivered me from you know bad movies and and and cigarettes and chewing tobacco and he went like this he said he tapped his breasts right here his chest and he said yeah I still can't get over cigarettes so I carry him right here in my pocket I thought oh my god have mercy I said now I know I was supposed to come to this church service I was coming to testify that God is the real Living God can deliver us from that and a real experience with God will sanctify you from that you know clean you out from that that he you know the Bible said you don't depend on those things you depend on the power of the Holy Spirit I knew later why I was I was raise I was taken there to be a witness against that ministry now could God use that man he could he could God use a lot of people that maybe didn't fit the qualifications so I want to just read those quotes so if you haven't heard those they would help you out that Deborah is wasn't in she wasn't in the priests and in fact you'll never find a woman in the priesthood in the whole Old Testament God never even let one get there just so the types worked you let a woman be judged but he let a woman get to the priesthood that's how much he protected it now let's go to judges chapter 4 let's finish here I'll give me I'm gonna set my timer 15 minutes here judges chapter 4 verse 1 let's let's look at this life this beautiful life of Deborah do you know her name means B it means a B Barrack means lightning there's a lot of great lessons we can learn in there how many love the Lord today there's so many church the reason I felt led to preach us is just encourage our sisters but also so you'll know you and I shouldn't be arrogant towards people that don't believe what we believe we should be loving if God healed a woman preacher through His Prophet and let her keep preaching no doubt well then let's be kind to those people because I'll sit like this church that they have a place in God's economy there's gonna be people the bride is gonna live in that holy city but there's got to be people outside the city to fill the earth there's got to be people kings and peoples that bring their glory into the city they have a place in God's economy like all the time you'll hear me say I thank God for the Assembly of God denomination I was raised and at least I went to a church they let women wear pants and watch movies and sports and but I knew I felt the presence of God many times they're like amen and whoever tell me this you know they they talk with a mint one of a men's family members who went to a denominational Church and had a supernatural experience remember you were telling me that brother and like a discernment like this person discerned a demon in one of his friends or how can we don't see that message well we do sometimes it just depends who's got the gifts praise God and that that encouraged me like you can remember though primer I was happy when I heard that praise God that their family and friends can go to churches and get deliverance thank God for that but I wonder if that denominational Church when it comes down to women preachers I wonder what they say I wonder what they say about women the men's hair length wonder what they would say about water baptism and the Godhead and all these things that we know are thus saith the Lord but see I want to be happy I want to rejoice at least demons are getting driven off of people praise God so I want to encourage all of us that we should have we should always brother Manson in the my family I listened to it last week brother Graham sending questions and answers on the seals he said never make yourself odd to be a Christian now you're you're obviously gonna look odd just by how you dress especially if you're a woman but you don't have to act and do strange things brother and he said he summarized he said just tell the people all the time how much you love Jesus don't be odd don't be strange and act like you got you know some secret channel to God no God can hear their prayers too and honestly they might even have more gifts that we have because the gifts and callings of God are without repentance none of you can add any cubit to your stature I can't add any gifts to my stature whatever I have got already gave to me praise God who are we that can add gifts we can't add gifts to our stature we just got to work with what God gave us a man we got to yield to the Holy Spirit and let God use us to the greatest extent that he can so I wanted to make sure everybody understands that that we should have the such a sweet kind attitude towards anyone that we see is trying to serve the Lord we should just be so kind to them and pray for them and encourage them because they are they have a part in God's economy they have a part now they remember they're not the dollar they're not the silver dollar they might be a nickel or penny but God can still use them for his glory and let me just share this too with who is dead but the Amen remembers brother amen called me I was on when it was on a Wednesday Tuesday morning and I told you this before I had woken up that morning at 4:15 I couldn't get three scriptures out of my mind one of them was about there's power of life and death in the tongue so when a man called me I didn't know this had happened I was shocked that who his dad was so sick and almost dying and you guess he'd already died and came back I think that was right is that right they couldn't find a heartbeat is that what it was at first cuz he was turned all purple right and then they took they shocked him and brought his life back and then a man called me the next morning a man might remember but I said I said let's speak the word brother remember I was I had Lidia Malachi my office they might remember too I walked out and I just I remember I was staring up at the hills and I just spoke and I spoke to them out remember that he meant I prayed that I said I speak to that mountain of sickness in the name of Jesus Christ let their dad come out of that hospital and let him get well now just two weeks later after that bang was saying he thought his dad was gonna die and then afterbang told me that two and half weeks later he said all of a sudden within those last two days something switched and he got over you got a lot of strength back and he come back home now what happened their church I just felt led of the Holy Spirit to speak to that mountain did he come out of there yeah bang wrote it down and said it was a miracle see we see miracles by speaking God's Word amen hey man I was just telling a man on the email this morning he said God's but God's people aren't speaking the word to the till Atlanta rain I said sir where have you been I started say it nicely and I said I said in all humility brother and all kindness I said I Jose spoken the word to a couple that couldn't have children I've spoken to a couple that couldn't have children we spoke to the mountain of who is dad sickness I spoken to the mountain of my friends sickness and God honored the spoken word amen God gave women that couldn't have babies God gave their babies amen two men that were dying in the hospital God brought him back amen and now they're living in well in their homes now we're still praying for her dad but look and I kept telling bang guys I kept text him said there's power life and death in the tongue every time he would text me I would stop what I was doing on my computer I'd raised my hands to heaven I said I'm speaking live my children remember I'm speaking like I'm speaking life maybe well in Jesus Christ's name speaking live and so see Church when God annoys us we speak God's Word and God backs up his word amen so I'm Sarah not to say that God still can move mountains today praise God now we course with her dad you know we know the whole mountains not move yet but let's keep believing we don't know what God's gonna do it we don't know how much you'll allow with her dad so we run we're on the right in the middle of it we just got to be positive right we got to just trust in God we got to speak God's Word just be just find the revelation in your heart do you believe God's will and just speak it don't doubt it just speak God's Word praise God now judges for verses 1 to 3 and the children of Israel again did eve on the side of the Lord when a hoot he was a deliverer was dead and the Lord sold them in the hand of Jacob and king of Canaan that rain and haze are the captain of whose host was cesira or Sisera which dwell in the Harrow chef's of the Gentiles verse 3 and the two mr. crying to the Lord for he had nine hundred chariots of iron and 20 years he mildly oppressed the children of Israel ah goodness our church hasn't been around for 20 years we've been around 14 years our anniversary's in a couple weeks 20 years they were oppressed 20 years Canaan and and Sisera had worked together to keep them in bondage and they after 20 years they finally say God deliver us deliver us these are the same ones that were worshipping idols a few years later or earlier it's like a lot of people today they only crowd to God when something bad happens church I want to be faithful to God in the good times and the bad times I want God to hear my voice on the mountaintop and I want God to hear my cries in the valley praise God it wasn't that way they only cried in the valley once they got the mountaintop they made them grows and with idols and altars and evil look at verse 3 I'm sorry we read that church catch that 900 chariots of what iron what does I represent who knows Babylon right remember the remember the statue over the statue Daniel saw what was the last one iron Babylon praise God God's gonna raise up a woman that overcomes Babylon a man honey I'm talking about the bride of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah so see that's why brother Ram said go back and you can see all the types in the Bible he said look for Jesus Christ and the bride in all these types in the Bible that's the chapter I just wrote this week there's so many types Samson's wife from Timna or Timnath s there's a type of the bride I there's all they're all typed the bride of Jesus Christ Abigail Abigail his husband had to die that she can marry the king that's what the Bible says in Romans 7 the Bible says that we should be married to another we should be dead to the law our first husband but we should be married to Christ amen glory oh it's rich my Candace all these things point to the the bride the woman the church 20 years of losses can you imagine having a drought for 20 years just bad things for 20 years I would think after the first two months she'd be like Lord what have I done but they start crying out finally after 20 years I want my I want my heart to cry out if I just make one mistake the first day God forgive me God forgive me deliver me I don't want to live addicted to sin I don't want to live in the snares of the devil I want to be free you mothers and children want to be free in Christ Jesus amen we want to be free we don't want to be a slave to sin and corruption now in verses 4 to 9 look at this gallant woman here Deborah look it's let's look at her for last few minutes here at verse 4 endeavor a prophetess the wife of lappa Dolph now I'm not saying against the boat he should have been the judge God didn't call women to be judges she judged Israel at that time and she dwell under the palm tree of Deborah between Rhema and Bethel in the Mount Ephraim and the turn of Israel came up to her for judgment and she sent and called Barrack the son of ABBA no I am out of Kadish Naphtali and said unto Him hath not the Lord God of Israel commanded saying go and draw toward Mount Tabor and take with thee ten thousand men of the children of Naphtali and the children of his ebullient look at this she's reminding him she said didn't God tell you what to do to get the victory in other words here's a woman gotta remind the man the leader of the army didn't God tell us to do this already shouldn't we have been doing this already praise God you ever have to do that you ever have to remind somebody with the Word of God didn't I tell you this already don't we know we should do this already look how humble she is Andrew Deborah was a very humble woman she's a very humble judges we'll get to this you'll see how almost she was she never glorified herself but she says it real homely didn't the Lord say in other words didn't you already have the saith the Lord and why haven't you obeyed it verse six no seven God told him what was gonna happen Church look at verse seven and I will draw unto thee to the river of Keshawn see sirrah the captain of jaemin's army with his chariots with his multitude and I'll deliver him into thy hand God already told him to go gather go to that River I'm gonna bring the enemy right to your doorstep and the man barracks kinda like you know he kind of sat on it for a while we don't know how long but she's trying to remind him didn't I already tell you thus saith the Lord see how it's hard sometimes for men to humble themselves and the church said it is hard for men me it's men it's hard for men sometimes to humble themselves so God gives a gracious woman to barrack to remind him didn't how we already say got thus saith the Lord and this is what you got to do look at the next verse look at verse eight look how barrack says he says and barrack sending her if thou wilt go with me then I will go but if that will not go with me I will not go look at this guy Church this guy is in the Hall of Fame of faith just like it in right he said ah he said fine he said if you think you got though say the Lord in other words I won't move on your thus saith the Lord unless you're willing to go with your own prophecy see the nice trust there they build up there but if you know if you don't act glory if you don't act on your own word I'm not acting on it either praise God and that's what a real that's what a real bride Church you do today my life you should look at my life and see it as I obey the word you should do the same praise God Amen what we saw brother do and they obeyed the word and God vindicate it we should do it to praise God see he and also he thought too he said I'm not going out there without that anointed prophet the Bible says if you there's 15 minutes sorry the Bible says if you respect God's prophets God will prosper you she said if you okay if you're the anointed prophet yes if you if you're gonna act upon your prophecy then yes I'll go if you go now it's important as she went to because church he gave the very sign when to start the battle usually the man the king was standing there and said let's go forth in the battle right he's looking the whole time say sister when do we start this battle ready when we go and sister when we go start this battle he was waiting for the sister to tell him when to start the battle that's scriptural look at verse 9 and she said I will surely go with thee notwithstanding the journey that thou talked take us shall not be for thine honor oh now God's unveiling it now berrak was waiting because he was a little selfish he wanted his own honor and this but look at this the word the word Lord has to come to the through the woman to tell this man this ain't for your honor God's gonna honor somebody else look at this church for the Lord shall sell sister into the hand of a woman and Deborah Rosa went with Barrett to Kiedis did you believe that God has to rebuke this prideful man he wants the honor but she says I'll go but you have to understand this thing for your honor God's actually gonna honor a woman through this battle and who was it's Jael so if you read later on the chapter let's just jump ahead a little bit now everything falls exactly in line with what God told Barrack through Deborah at 13 and Cicero gathered together all his chariots even 900 charity satire and all the people that were with him they went to the river kashan now look at verse 14 here's where he's waiting the whole time what do we do sister when do we move when we move look at verse 14 and Deborah send a barrack up for this is the day in which the Lord had delivered Sisera into thine hand is not the Lord gone out before thee though Barrack went down from Mount Tabor and ten thousand men after him he's waiting the whole time what's the Prophet gonna say what's the what's what's the anointed prophets is gonna say praise God he waits on the Word of God prays out what a lesson amen church this ain't the first time God gave a word through a woman remember Sarah told Abraham get rid of Hagar and Ishmael Abraham's like I don't know about that he went into prayer and God said hearken unto the voice of your wife don't fear to put away Hagar and Ishmael as Abraham says alright Lord praise God see this ain't the only time and Barak was respectful to that woman and she told him exactly this day this scripture is gonna be fulfilled praise God hallelujah she waited on the anointed gift of God to tell her or to tell him when do I act when do I get the victory he waited for the church to tell him when and he got the victory and she has to say again didn't the Lord go before thee in other words then didn't you see the Lord prophesy all this haven't you seen just exactly what I told you look there they are 900 of them Church 900 900 charity of iron how many in Israel have zero because this was the iron age this is the Iron Age and Bronze Age these these countries had way more technology than Israel and they're all nervous because there was 900 ayran chariots against none of theirs but they went out with thus saith the Lord that all encourage us church amen no matter your enemy no matter the trial you face you've got the word of the Lord praise God no matter what technologies might be against we've got the save the Lord and if God is for us who can be against us 900 iron charts and nothing except a woman directing this man oh here it is God always also shouldn't say like that God often uses the weak he lifts up the weak to do great things God will use the week to deliver other people because his strength is made perfect in weakness oh it's beautiful look at verse 15 and the Lord discomforted cesira and all his chariots and all the hosts in the edge of the sword before Barrack that sister alighted down on his chariot and fled away off his feet now the rest of this chapter church is this Sisera he was the leader he ran away and then a woman named Jo said oh oh you're tired come into my house he's like give me some water she's like I'll give you some milk she said fear not come into my house she lied to him just like Rahab lied to those soldiers said no I haven't seen any or the spies went that way and they're hiding up there God honored a lie because they didn't have the Holy Ghost in those days and while he's sleeping she takes a hammer a nail and it's really descriptive I read I heard it this morning I just cringe like what and then she took a sword and finish the job after a nail went through the temples a nail went through the temples and then she took a sword and finish the job and the Bible said God subdued on that day Jabin the king of Canaan before the children of Israel and that was the fulfillment of what Deborah had said Deborah had said barek it's not you the one that's gonna get the honor it's Jael a woman's gonna get the honor because you know church in those days to be defeated by a woman if you're a man that's the greatest lack that's the greatest disrespect you could have right you're a man and you get defeated by a woman so God he humbles us the sister of this evil ruler he brings him down and and deceives him and causes this woman to end his life and God exhaust this woman to honor Jael you know what the Bible said the Bible said that she had great honor where's that scripture I'd like to see it real quick because the Bible said she deserved great honor yeah it's verse go to chapter 5 verse 24 the Bible said blessed above all woman shall be Jael the wife of Heber the Kay night lesson shall she be above women in the tent how come Catholics don't pray to Jael like they do Mary right they say mayor they say they do their prayer beads and say Mary Mother of grace highly exalted about above vow of all women what about her see like that demon contradicts itself they say Mary's above all women what about her she's above all women she'd be exalted you see how that's wrong see how it's just this the wrong spirit there they don't even got it right now let's close I know I said that 20 minutes ago but I'll try to finish chapter 5 is Deborah singing a song and all the people are worshipping God because God has delivered them after 20 years of slavery and bondage and then habitants couldn't even hardly walk on the streets without the soldiers their God delivers them by women praise God God delivers them by Deborah and Jael God had to remind Barrack you're not gonna get all the glory look at verse 2 here's where Deborah is so humble she praises God for the willingness of the people verse 2 crazy the Lord for the willing or the avenging of Israel when the people willingly offer themselves but look how humble this is church the people wouldn't go out without her every see that she's there you got thank you Lord for these willing people but none of them would have went been willing if she had not got thus saith the Lord that's when you'll find a real leader right that's when you find a real child of God God mighty use them in a mighty way but they'll give other people credit hey man praise God she didn't Pat herself on the back she said thank you Lord for willing soldiers that would fight for your great name look at verse 4 Lord when that went us out of Seir when thou marches on the field of Edom the earth temple were trembled and the heavens dropped and the clouds also dropped water the mountains melted from the before the Lord even the Sinai from before the Lord God of Israel she sing in church and she said that God walked before their armies God was going before them God goes before you and I praise God when we go to battle something we gotta say God go before us and then she's in her song she says it was God that was walking on that battlefield God was gonna drive them back praise God God fights for his people you know that saying by the rainbow he said he said God he said watch if you don't if you don't know God he's mighty in battle you just watch him when he goes to fightin Church that's what we should see God moving is in the midst of the battle as long as we worship Him as long as we obey Him as long as we put him first oh I love this and then verse 6 and 7 in the days of Shamgar the son of a method the days of Jael the highways were unoccupied and the travelers walked through byways that sounds like the day the streets are unoccupied because everybody's quarantined Debra's saying that's how it was where is everybody everybody's unoccupied verse 7 then the inhabitants of the villages ceased they ceased in Israel until I Deborah arose and I arose a mother in Israel you know what is really to that time they needed a mother they needed someone to care for amen they need someone to love them they need someone to give them wisdom and discern them and God couldn't find anybody else so God raise them up a mother prays God hey man you know America needed the church a mother I don't know you know you know what the armies of Israel needed a mother they need someone to instruct them someone to give them the wisdom someone to tell them exactly what they must do is that what you mothers do you tell your children with your hands brush your teeth you tell them everything they need that's what Israel needed they needed a mother and so God gave them one praise God Church God will give you what you need praise God God had to raise up a godly woman like Deborah this is what is renewed and no one else is there notice she said they were willing all those men who were willing after I got thus saith the Lord so she was willing first to get the word of Lord be devoted to God and when God raised her up and everybody else followed her this woman look at verse 20 this is so beautiful 20 this this song gives us more of the details of the battle they fought from heaven the stars in their courses fought against Sisera the river of Kashan swept them away that ancient river the river Kashan oh my soul thou has trodden down strength so God calls them to the river and it doesn't tell us in the previous chapter when the song God tells us God calls all these chairs with a man right to the river and then he causes the Stars and the moon and the earth to cause such an overflow of water that the water flows out and stops all those chariots right in the mud what good is a chariot if it's all stopped up in the mud it's a chariot too hard for the Lord no he said I'll fight for you I'll use all heaven and all nature I'll use the moon I use the Stars I'll use the rivers I'll use everything to protect my God fearing people praise God hey man he said I'll move heaven and earth I'll come down from heaven myself before them and I'll call for the rivers to bring forth waters to stop your enemies because you're my people and I've set my love upon you praise God amen let's stand to our feet praise God the rivers overflowed and God uses nature to defeat nine hundred chariots the Bible said in verse 23 the angels of God cursed the enemies sure didn't look like it right nine hundred chariots against ten thousand just little armed Israelites look like Israel was cursed but the angels had the authority of God to curse the enemy and God said the reason they're cursed they didn't help Israel beforehand George this is why God saves anyone who will help a Holy Ghost field Christian the reason Cicerone them lost is because their their previous descendant or previous family members had mistreated Israel verse 40 I'm sorry verse 31 so let all Israel let all thine enemies perish Oh Lord but let them that love him be as a son when he goeth forth in his might and the land had rest for forty years what did Israel need is Baxton and condition it needed a mother to instruct them and if they listened that mother church they're gonna have 40 years of victory 40 a whole generation see you mother's see what you're doing you are shaping the next generation proved it right here if you just faithfully discern the truth and give your children the Word of God tell them the truth it will bless the next generation let's have the musicians come here please remember God or the RAM said God will probably save Nicodemus and gamellia Nicodemus didn't even go I mean he he went to Jesus by night right you know he wasn't he wasn't just coming out and support them but because he was good to Jesus Khmer I never joined the Christian group he was a Jewish teacher he just said don't persecute Christians you might that might be God but Ram said perhaps God will save Camellia all because he just didn't you didn't support persecuting Christians Oh Church God is so merciful how many how many want his mercy oh my I want his mercy for me my family I want it for anyone anyone no matter no matter how much they can receive how much revelation they can receive I want to see them receive God's mercy now to see our mothers continue doing the wonderful job they're doing train those children teach them the Word of God teach them to judge right from wrong because you will shape the next generation praise God let's bow our heads here Israel needed a mother so God rose one up the Bible said the Holy Spirit searches the earth looking for somebody that will fear the Lord search
