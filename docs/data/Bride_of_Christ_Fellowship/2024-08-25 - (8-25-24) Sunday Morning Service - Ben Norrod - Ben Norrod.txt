TRANSCRIPT
========================================
preaching of the word of the Lord God helping us amen we're so glad for the realities of godone the wonderful things that he does and who he is and uh if you got your Bible this morning there's so many different things that I would love to bring this morning I'm telling you I I I've got I've got it loaded up and I'm not joking when I say I could literally probably preach three or four hours this morning and not even get halfway through all that I've got in these pages right here and so I uh now I'm not announcing to you that I'm going to preach three or four hours don't get nervous on me but I I I'm telling you so many good things that I would love to be able to share we got these two services to do it and uh if you'll be patient relaxed and just open your heart and let the Lord amen just bless you and encourage you on what we're going to speak on I think it'll be a great blessing to you now I want to start in Hebrews chapter one and uh there's so many different things that uh Paul says in this book of Hebrews and of course there is a uh as you may know you may not know this but I I'll I'll share this part with you that uh many are not exactly certain and there's a debate as to who the writer of Hebrews was but because we know brother Brenham was a prophet and he opinioned that he believe Paul was the writer of this book and I I I'm sorry to say this I know this is probably going to wind me up on somebody's we website or somebody's Facebook or something but I'll take brother bram's opinion any day of the week over many of these guys I hear that say different and him being a prophet his understanding was enlarged he saw things in a bigger view than what we see it and I certainly believe it when brother Bram read Hebrews you know he was someone that probably saw the parallels and the things in it and knew in some way that Paul was the writer of this book now we're going to start at chapter one and I'm just going to pull open a couple places here in my Bible I've got it electronically but I've also got it here on these little old onion skin pages and I like the Bible for more reasons than just be in the Bible but that cover is an animal skin cover something had to die in order for you to have this book in your hand this morning and I like that something died for us amen Jesus was the one that gave his life amen God gave His only begotten son that whosoever that's me I'm part of that group of Amen people that amen God could call and uh I want to be as sensitive to this as I can with what I'm getting ready to say but I believe by faith that he died for me am I want to be that as sensitive as I can saying that I know you have an opinion yourself but and a faith yourself but I believe he died for me amen and I can't even speak for my own wife standing here I believe he died for me my sins were buried Amen in the sea of God's forgetfulness I don't mind telling you you I am so glad that I know that to be the truth hallelujah brother I'm telling you if it wasn't for that something of his blood breaking over our lives we would be of a people most miserable and greater than that he rose again and we live in resurrection power Resurrection Life and I love that amen so we're going to begin at verse one now if I was to call a title I want to speak to you the Lord helping us upon living in the true Tabernacle living in the true Tabernacle and we're going to talk just a little while about some of these chapters and and now when we get done with the text reading now just hold your book right there to Hebrews 1 because the Lord willing what I want to try to do if God will help me is I want to go through some of these chapters and I want to show you some things there's a a great debate upon being prophets in the last day prophets in this time well that ain't going to work it ain't holding it ain't got enough Pentecost in it to hold that jacket amen we going to have to convert it up from where it was amen amen it needs a better upswing when I'm trying to say it's still back in the Lutheran days I think that little thing amen hallelujah but anyways U not that this is a Lutheran pull pit I didn't mean that but I mean that little hook amen but there's a great debate about uh whether we should believe in prophets of the last day Messengers like brother brandom and I believe the Lord give me a little something here in the first chapter of Hebrews and coming up here and the Lord putting this on my heart brother Jesse I don't mean to say this this out loud like I'm going to say it and I know it's going to be heard but I so wished in my heart knowing that you know the critics stream these little services and things out here I so wish these people would get a hold of what I'm going to say in this first couple verses I think it would help them if they could see it right because you know we could debate about who God's messenger is and we could fuss and go back and forth and opinion about this or that who was supposed to be Malachi for the the argument always goes back well there ain't supposed to be prophets in the last stage we're not supposed to have prophets in it then I will say this for the benefits of not just the Saints but those that be critical and hear me and say this I I want to let them know and I want to let you all know that I don't blame people sometimes for looking at the message people in the churches and the message way they do we've had so much nonsense in the name of this truth it it's understandable why people would be critical it's understandable why they would Point their fingers at certain things around the message of the hour we have certainly been our Own Worst Enemy around this truth and remember it's not been the Pentecostals the Baptist or the Methodist that have brought the shame or the reproach on us it's been our own kind it's been our own people and it's it's important for us I'm saying this for a reason now it's important for us to know not only by Revelation what we believe but to be able to have an answer by scripture of the hope that lays within us now I wouldn't say it this strongly if I didn't know your pastor already preached it this way I might I might might dumb this down or water it down a little bit if somebody was a little bit more upon everything has to be quotes and quotes and quotes and quotes and I I try to respect that too but I know Jesse preaches this and I'm right in the same fellowship with him that everything brother brandham taught to us has to be tied back to scripture amen and here is my hope and here is what I believe that if I can take what brother brandom preached back to the Bible and that is true then I can already give brother Bram the benefit of the doubt and the assumption that his experiences were just as true as what he preached because it come out of the Bible and if I had a man that come to me or a woman come to me and said they had all kinds of experiences and their Revelation was as rotten as it could get then I would sit back and say you know something is not right somewhere because right Revelation now listen to me closely don't you fail this you you little aconites over here you little bride of Christ Fellowship people you listen brother Ben if your Revelation is right it will make your experiences be right that's right people that have wrong experiences more than likely they don't have an understanding of scriptural things can I give you an example before we read a person has a dream brother Ram taught us this and the Bible also teaches us that if a dream comes without an interpreter in the land it must be a direct message Joseph fear not to take unto thee Mary thy wife for that which is conceived in her is the Holy Ghost uh of the Holy Ghost so when we see people come with dreams a lot of Dreams I had a vision I had a this and I had a that and not any of it lines up with any spec of scripture or no Revelation to it most of the time it's just their own subconscious doing a lot of things because of the busyness of the day and they try to make something spiritual out of it to the point to where they can't be corrected amen that you know right then somewhere in their Doctrine somewhere something is wrong because if it is truly God it can be corrected by by the word right no matter what they say it can always be corrected by the word and we want to be correctable people right so the Lord helping us now I want to dwell on this first couple verses but let let's read it together God who at sunry times and in diverse manners spake in times past unto the fathers by the prophets verse two hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom he hath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he made the worlds now verse three with me and then we'll pray who being the brightness of his glory and the express image of his person and upholding All Things by the word of his power when he hath by himself purged our sins sat down on the right hand of the Majesty on high and all of the children of God said amen let's bow our heads and pray over the word father thank you for the reading of Thy word Lord as we have quoted it together stated it together Lord we've sat and recited the songs of Zion and sang them from the bottom of our heart we've taken up the offerings and the tithes which is a part of your worship we've come in with our prayer requests which is a part of your worship I would all men stand praying Lord we've come with our Bibles and our hands and our hearts open in the attitude of agreement that's a part of the worship of God we've a with the opening prayer Lord and the songs of special songs and things have been sung to the glory of God now we come to the most sincere part of any service and that is the preaching of the word of God lord we're praying that this morning you will forgive our frailties in every way sins indiscretions wrongs or silliness of humankind forgive us of it Lord wash us of it may we with all seriousness and sobriety approach this open word May the power of God fall upon it fall upon me fall upon them and may you speak with a voice of utterance may it even be a thunder of God that speaks through the words of the Lord this morning that not only announces Lord in the heavens above but in the earth below and in our hearts in the middle may we just as the expression goes may heaven and earth may they Embrace and kiss together and may we just get caught right in the middle of the smack as the old fell said one day Lord Lord Jesus may your glory pour out on us we pray as we look at the great things of God bless us now in the name of Jesus Christ amen and amen and amen and amen God bless you you may be seated amen now hold your book there in Hebrews for just a little while and being that this is a a good solid teaching church amen I like that because sometimes I feel like we dig into things a little bit on the Evangelistic side which is all right but often we rush through subjects and jump from one thing to another and not really dig deep enough to understand the depth of it all now I want to show if the Lord will help us now how this puts together in the first chapter of Hebrews now I want to get some background about what it is that we're looking at and there's seven chapters right in a row of course I don't mean chronologically or sequentially but I mean there's seven chapters right in a row introducing and these seven chapters bring up a background Paul leading into the eighth chapter where he starts speaking about the Tabernacle of God and the uh body of Jesus Christ which would become the new Tabernacle of the Lord amen in which God would dwell and His glory would never depart from these seven chapters leading up and again I don't mean chronologically now I mean somebody could say well of course they're in a roow brother bin 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 but what I mean is each of these chapters that they serve a specific purpose in introducing Paul's main idea or his main thought in this book of Hebrews and in order to understand the entire book itself you have to understand how Paul laid this out and what we look at many times in this first verse is Ammunition by those outside the ranks of what we would call the message of the hour that would use this verse to try to establish an understanding about being no more prophets but actually when you look at this in the correct way through the eyes of Revelation what you'll understand is that in this first chapter Paul is not dismissing nor is he distinguishing any type of ministry in the New Testament whatsoever actually what Paul is establishing here is he is referring back in the very first verse he is establishing the Old Testament principles of how the church was called out of Egypt amen under Father Abraham the promise given the church called out amen as the word church is the called out we know and then that church called out amen out of Egypt and then placed under a spiritual system that God had ordained of them in their order of worship we know that when the Tabernacle was pitched amen that God established how to pay tithes how to give offerings how to offer incense how to sacrifice animals what the priest was supposed to be dressed like what the inner Court was supposed to look look like all of the duties and the responsibilities throughout the three courts amen including where the tribes would be positioned on the outside now if you'll think with me just a moment and go right back before this first chapter of Hebrews and let's go back into the Old Testament because when you look at verse one Paul is directly inviting us Amen to go back into the Old Testament to see how God done it look at them first words God in sunry times in diverse manners spaken the past unto the fathers by the prophets if we just stop right there amen and just look exactly what he's trying to tell us he is inviting us to see how God done it in the original way amen and remember before the very days of all of Moses's system setting up and when I say system I don't mean organization but I mean God's way his order or his system of doing things now amen when God established that in Moses amen the sacrifice had to be offered at a certain season time under a certain uh uh pretense a certain animal it had to be perfect it had to have all sort of things amen associated with it and only a certain man could go behind that Veil once a year and offer up the sacrifices to God Amen for the sins of Israel amen but before that system was established amen a man didn't know where to pay his ties at didn't know where to give his offerings unto the Lord at amen anyone at any time could sacrifice at any moment as we would say on the street amen out in the world and things we' say well as the mood hits some amen they just stop and they'd offer up a bulock or Ram or something like that amen it's not that God didn't recognize it amen but there was as Paul tells us a more excellent way coming down the road amen just like the church ages amen when God opened up the church ages amen he started with the church of Pentecost and those early firstborn Believers amen they came on fire for the powers of God that had come through Jesus Christ amen and set the world on fire amen without question they went about doing good that seed then was swn in the seed Amen swn in the ground I mean to say the seed was swn into the ground too many s's in that sentence amen amen amen swn into the ground hallelujah amen and then it come back up through Martin Luther amen now we know that when we examine and study the things that Martin Luther taught amen his hatred against the Jews and his feeling calling them the Antichrist and such as that amen it would be the same exact idea amen as some man out there wandering around in the desert amen and feeling a burden to do something for God like balam who would go and offer seven Rams and seven Bullocks amen a true prophet of God within his time and within his moment that he was true to the Lord amen and here is balam who later becomes a false amen anointed one as we would say in the last day he become an anointed one but false himself amen knew exactly by revelation what it was that God would tell Moses later would be offered all speaking of Christ all speaking of the Resurrection all speaking of the seven Church ages all speaking of all the sevens that would come later on Amen but here's a man without a pastor without an evangelist a teacher a prophet or an apostle without a church without an assembly without a group out by himself all of a sudden gets a revelation sound familiar amen there's Martin Luther he has no guidance he has no Pastor he has no leader and then all of a sudden in the middle of nowhere so to speak God reveals to him the just shall not live by works but the just shall live by faith can you say Amen now God took them into a deeper way amen they come up through Wesley came up through Pentecost and now God Amen after the church ages are running out remember brother bradam his ministry was not to the elect of God entirely but he was a dual type Ministry being a breach messenger like John was he had to stand between two ages and two dispensations amen John was baptizing unto while still standing both feet in the Old Testament amen under that anointing he was pointing unto and now here comes Elijah in the last day amen standing at the end of the Gentile Church ages he's pointing this way to Pentecost and announcing that he who will come will be the Capstone Ministry of the last day Amen brother bradam stood right in the middle between both of them ages amen he was not just the ministry of the minister to you you and I the bride of Christ but he was also the messenger of Lady oia amen and all of that had to be closed out why when the Thunders would begin to sound and the seals would come open amen God like Moses would call them back to the mountain of the Lord amen and in the mountain of the Lord that statue of a perfect man there would have to be a Capstone there would have to be an established order of how God expected us to live and what to do and how to behave amen therefore amen marriage and divorce had to us be established amen the trumpets had to be saw the plagues had to be talked about the vs the Thunders the seals Daniel 70 weeks and every single bit of it amen had to be established for us to know exactly hallelujah how to approach God his word to get oursel ready for the coming of the Lord Jesus amen it's a beautiful type and how it parallels itself and remember now Paul is inviting us to go back and look at that before he introduces his main thought any of you people that's ever been in school here in any way you remember when you used to have to examine a book you had details but you also had a main idea and all of the details were the things that described your main idea and if you don't know the details you don't know the main idea and if you don't know the main idea you probably don't understand the details amen but Paul had to establish for us amen how he was going to bridge the gap between the Old Testament and the New Testament Church all right now watch now he tells us inviting us now God in Sun UND times in diverse manners spake in times P unto the fathers by the prophets now listen to me carefully this is not a declaration of the ending of the prophets right right this next verse hath in these last days spoken unto us by his son whom Heath appointed heir of All Things by whom also he U made the worlds now if in the last days he had spoken unto us by his son all right let's establish what the last days are remember the last days is not just a uh uh just a time period hanging in space somewhere or another nobody knows when it begins or when it ended but the last days are the last two days that was prophesied or 2,000 years of church history amen these men had no Revelation on when the coming of the Lord was going to be and when they spoke it they spoke it like it happen any moment in any hour right and you know what beautiful about it when they went down into the dirt and took the dirt nap as brother B called it amen when they get up at the coming of the Lord Jesus they went down looking for him urgent for his coming they'll get up looking for him urgent for his coming oh what people we ought to be sitting here this morning urgent for the coming of the Lord hallelujah amen and this is not let me say again this is not a declaration of the ending of the prophets stop with me a moment this man said he spoke to us by the prophets now he speaks by his son if Paul believed that God was no longer going to use prophets then somebody please tell me what he meant by this in 1 Corinthians 14:37 I'm going to give our sister about four or five seconds here every how long it takes you to put this up I'm going to let I'm going to let you see it with your eyes first it'll just make a deeper impression all right and then let's see I'm sorry 1 Corinthians 14:37 is that right7 37 what did I say 47 by yeah that's the one all right yeah yeah all right just let it linger a moment all right now if we take what they say people in the world hath in the last days spoken unto us by his son see there brother Ben see no more prophets same man said this same man said that yes amen good brother good now we got a problem here either Paul's being like Peter and speaks out of this side of his mouth with one group and then speaks out of another out of that one or maybe the man that they're assigning and and attributing that that thought that there's no more Prophet they're attributing it to the man saying that Paul believed that when really if you look at this Paul didn't believe that that's right yes amen because you'll notice he says if any man thinks himself to be spiritual or a prophet well if he didn't believe in prophets what's he saying this for yes sir hello somebody Hallelujah the fact of the matter is this man didn't believe what they say he believed here that's right but rather if you look at it closely and let the Holy Spirit open up to your eyes he is introducing to us a change oh my in verse one he's telling us what God did in verse two he's telling us what he's getting ready to do amen Paul has not established to these people yet who is speaking to us in the last days remember many of these people that he introduces his letters to they're already Christians they're already born again they've already heard the gospel preach you can tell by his salutation to the church that's in Ephesus the saved the Sanctified the born again but where's that at in the book of Hebrews Hallelujah when he starts out chapter one he don't say to the saved and the Sanctified and the Born Again In Heavenly places he starts introducing to them the Gospel of Jesus Christ as has been updated by the season and the time of Prophecy and the hour that Paul was living He is telling this Hebrew church about what God did and what God is doing right now and what he's getting ready to do he spends the entire book trying to show them who Jesus Christ was Hallelujah now if these are born again people what's he spending all that time for the problem is they're not looking at it through the eyes of Revelation they've taken some scholar some Theologian that's tried to explain away the need for a messenger in this day and in doing so they use these verses to back them up and their argument as thin as the broth made from the shadow of a chicken starve five times a death that's right there not a scriptural basis in it whatsoever come on don't you get quiet on me it's true right exactly what they're trying to do and it's nothing but the devil putting deception on the people because in order for the mysteries of God to be finished in the last day it wasn't an apostle that he said he'd s he didn't say behold I'll send you Malachi amen Elijah the pastor or Elijah the teacher or Elijah the Apostle but he announced he would be a prophet why because only the word of the Lord can come to the Prophet yes oh my now that's a big statement within himself seeing as how in the book of Acts alone you got 13 prophets go back and count them Judas and Silas and agabus and different ones amen all called prophets of the Lord amen in this day and age people have such an Old Testament thinking about how the church is supposed to operate amen and if I can preach fast enough and you can listen quick enough if that clock will SL slow down on me I'm going to show you some things about the order of this if God help me because I think what we need to understand is how the order of the church has been established God never intended for us to be left without profits even in the last day the biggest argument we have today is over Joseph brandham why because we've got quotes about Brother Joseph we don't have quotes about John or Jack or these other guys we have quotes about Brother Joseph therefore everybody will lean to those quotes quot I say everybody but I mean a portion of people will lean to those quotes because brother bam said it but let's understand something in the New Testament Church amen it is not a prophet exactly that is the voice of God to the day remember Isaiah said to whom of the AR is the arm of the Lord revealed and then John sees that arm in the Book of Revelation and that arm is clutching Seven Stars and the revelation of Christ would come through those Seven Stars what were they seven Spirits amen seven anointings that was sent by the one anointing the great spirit of God like a fountain pouring out Seven Rivers or seven streams Amen in every age under a specific message that would call the people out and I know what the critics are saying now how in the world can a man like it was in the days of Columba and them amen that they was in one age and the people was in another amen well if God Amen had it so perfectly then why did Brother B put him dead before the message even lived on you know it's almost like people don't believe in Preachers even in the critic side of things amen because all it would take is for one Columba to preach what the spirit spoke to him and let one evangelist One Pastor one Prophet one Apostle and one teacher get a hold of that message and that message would propagate for Generations amen I haven't seen Paul either I'm not in Paul's age amen but if I preach anything contr let me be a cursed that's right Hallelujah a man don't have to be present to have an influence over the age that he's been given that's right hallelujah amen it's just like you at home amen living the life that you live I'm talking about Good lives Christian lives amen your pastor don't have to be sitting in your leg just he don't have to be amen sitting with you in Wally world Amen or going to the schoolhouse or somewhere with you to make sure that you live right to have an influence over you no he preaches the gospel he brings in men that believe the truth amen you Fellowship around the carcass of that word and where the carcass is the Eagles will be gathered hallelujah amen you come and you Feast on that word and the influence of that word follows you in the absence of the messenger hallelujah amen it doesn't matter if the man was present for the age or not he was the one that started as it was threw the rock up in the air and got the message going but I don't want talk about that how many times have people been influenced by this remark it is the right mental attitude toward any promise of God will bring it to pass how many has been influenced by that little statement brother Brams said it but it wasn't brother Brams that come from FF Bosworth go back and read his book Christ the Healer go he didn't get that from brother he didn't get that from Brother brand brother brand got that from brother bonworth who was his mentor that's right hello somebody yes sir amen unless you're a prophet worshipper this is this easy for you come on now amen and where did Brother Bosworth get it he got that inspiration from somebody else and they got that inspiration from somebody else it may have trapped back hundreds of years before the original remark was even given but just because a man isn't sitting right there does not mean the influence of it is I've never seen brother brandom I know it's not in one meeting the best I've ever done was read a book hear a tape see the videos and the pictures that's about as good as it gets for me but the influence of this message has caused me to come closer to Jesus Christ than I've ever been in my entire life and that's what matters at the end of the day amen and you have to understand that the Prophecy of the last day was God would send Elijah the prophet why the prophet of the hour would be the one inspired and gifted to be able to take the message the word and break it down and interpret it for the people it could have been prophesied in the last days I'll send you Elijah the pastors it could have been prophesied I'll send you Elijah the apostles God could have done whatever he wanted to do but the key thing to remember was the man was a star first he that hath an ear not they not them not those he that hath an ear let him singular him hear what the spirit says unto the church that star was the only one that could hear what God was saying in that age could you imagine what a responsibility that must have been brother b stand there knowing he was the only ear on the earth that was hearing directly from God what God thought about this hour Hallelujah GL none of the other ones had that Revelation about themselves not only that he had the burden of the sign M Messianic sign he had the burden of people sleeping on his front doorstep his kids having to step over him to go to school if he was such a deceiver and such a liar why'd people run to him like that why didn't his peers speak up and say what a liar is why have we waited 60 years for a bunch of intellectuals to go back and pick up a bunch of magazines and articles amen that I don't know I could trust those men and women either that's right I'd like to see what else they wrote how biased they were about subjects you don't know maybe one of their grandmas got offended by Brother bam telling her how short her hair was and he decided to get even with the prophet of God right oh it's easy to declare amen and establish something when you're looking at it through the keyhole of your own filter amen but if God thought enough of William brandom to cause all of the Miracles that he caused all of the Revelation that he caused Hallelujah and it stayed right with that word right there that I'm just dumb enough to believe that everything else has to hit true the same word do I believe brother B got confused do I believe he misunderstood things do I believe he mixed it up of course I do he was an uneducated hillbilly now listen I'm raised with the hillbillies my people are Hillbillies I know how they do I had an uncle that would tell me the same story 40 different ways every time he told it that doesn't strike me as that he's some kind of a oh he's an idiot he's a dummy he's a fool he's a he's a deceiver I didn't call the man name I just said to poor old Hill he can't remember nothing I attribute that kind of respect to brother brandham listen as it was told one time amen as it was told Amen to a brother down in Dayton I'll just say it that way maybe I should keep his name out of my mouth amen he asked Billy Paul Billy he said that man in Canada for example he said how many times did that happen to brother Brenham he said Billy Paul rolled his eyes kind of back in his head like this he said I never thought of it like that he said but you know that happened to Daddy over and over and over and over and over and over again now you w't tell me bunch of intellectuals come along that ain't never laid hands on nobody and never seen God do nothing ain't never preached a sermon and see nobody saved and where what church are we supposed to go to if we leave the message what place do we leave that's got more truth that's got more to us if we are in a call why are people in this message getting closer to God and God vindicating it better Hallelujah that's right oh you say it's become a great mess yes it has because it's supposed to every true move of God will have this foolishness around it but that doesn't mean God disqualifies the real that's inside of it that's right Hallelujah and here we see God in the last days has spoken to us by his son same man Ephesians chapter 4 and he that's the son gave some Apostles prophets teachers evangelists and pastors sir for the work of the ministry and Paul was trying to dismiss prophets in this verse oh here we go but brother Ben the law and the prophets were until John I wish y'all just look up in school what that word and means it's a conjunction it's a part of speech that connects two main thoughts yes sir for the law and the prophets were until John that's right but after the law had been completed after the law had been fulfilled that did not mean God dismissed and distinguished uh uh extinguished rather the prophets of God prophets carried on the law was fulfilled amen hello yes sir and again Jesus was not making a declaration that because I'm here I'm ending all prophets that's right brother if he did then why'd he come along in Matthew and say truly Elias will come and restore all things that's in the future yes sir sir praise the Lord if that's the case why did Jesus himself say beware of false prophets in the future last I checked if there's a false one there's got to be a true one hiding somewhere Jesus did not declare the end of the prophets all he was declaring to the people was look at the present stage of my Ministry look at where we are right now it was not a declaration of the extinguishing of these men or their Ministries he was trying to show them glory to God where they were living and what time they were living in hallelujah amen and if they saw it correctly saw it right they would see Jesus was showing them you have held on to the prophets and the law but then he turned around and said but here I am I fulfill every bit of that that's right he wasn't trying to dismiss these men he was trying to show them I am completing everything they work for yes sir every labor that Isaiah and Jeremiah and the rest of time had put in Amen to build the body of Christ up to get it ready for the headstone I am your head and they wanted to kill him for it so Jesus prophesied to him again he said that's right the head he said the Cornerstone would be rejected that was him he said but that Cornerstone that stumbling Stone would also be made the head that which was the corner would also be made the head and do you know that word that Jesus uses in there when he talks about amen he said that the builders rejected do you know that word means preachers many of the leaders in that day now I'm simplifying that of course but at the essence of it it is the Ministry of that day that stood right in front of their congregation said now listen this Jesus of Nazareth he's not approved of us but he didn't have to be cuz John said he was approved of God woo glory to God hallelujah he didn't need to be approved of man neither did Brother bradam neither did Paul neither do you neither do I we must be approved of God that's how we get our Vindication amen God approved him going about doing good and doing the things that his father would show him amen it was not a declaration of the ending of the prophets how in the world can people be so blinded it's the devil that's all there is to it yes sir even Luther Wesley the Pentecostals all the way far back even after the death of the Apostles there was still an incorporation of prophetic throughout the entire church ages until we come all the way to the end time and all of a sudden magically out of nowhere we don't believe in prophets no more right for 2,000 years the church has believed in prophets until we get to this age wonder why if people have got any wisdom at all if they intelligent spiritually speaking they can see it's nothing more than the devil trying to throw the heat off of the Revelation that's being fulfilled in the last day right yes sir good you know the nature of anything by watching what it does good and yet somebody will say well now brother being we only believe in one Prophet to the age woo be careful now now you're talking like the Old Testament may I say to you like Paul did God in sunry times and diverse manners spake unto the fathers by one Prophet God dealt to isra dealt with Israel as a Onan ministry right there were no evangelists under Isaiah's Ministry that's right brother yes they were are no teachers pastors which which group of people did Isaiah write and say now when you go to a city ordain Elders never in the Old Testament do you see the ministry being established except for one place that was in the Tabernacle yes good good and those men would preach what the prophet said to those people interesting isn't it that they would preach what the prophet said but they had to line up with what the prophet said for the age just like you and I we have to line up to what brother bam said in the last day amen or you say but I'm confused by that get the Holy Ghost you don't have to worry about that confusion will be solved when you get born again that's right Born Again will straighten out have all that problem am mean because Jesus himself said when I come and make my Abode he the spirit of truth will show you things that will come shortly to pass I'll solve all of those confusions if you just get born again hallelujah amen so it leads me to believe a lot of the reason people are confused either a they're not studying deep enough and they are born again and they're just not applying themselves or they're just not born again all the way through it that's amen remember what Paul said they that are of a carnal mind amen they can only compare things natural to things that are natural but we that are born again with the spirit of God in us we can compare that which is spiritual Amen to that which is spiritual as well Hallelujah that's why you can take these things and parallel them to the Bible cuz you're a spiritual minded person you can see it if it's laying there you can see it plainly oh my imagine that Paul backgrounding we have heard from the prophets of the Old Testament one man to one generation those men that was dedicated to the Tabernacle they would come and they would speak to the people but God's mouthpiece was not those men one Prophet to the age coming to the New Testament God had one star and from from that star he sent the message and then that message would be propagated now in the five-fold ministry that came out from it listen to me carefully those five-fold Ministry would become the voice of God to the people yes was no longer just standing up there and reading the prophet said the prophet said Moses said on page so and so verse so and so volume God didn't call us to be professional quarters praise the Lord somebody my job is to take the INSP ation that came from the angel of the age and preached that to you just as likeminded as if brother Bram was standing right here himself amen hallelujah which is entirely different from what they had in the Old Testament those men didn't have the inspiration of God to break into what the prophet said for that day and break it down to the people that's right that's right because we're not talking about gifted men now we're talking about men that were anointed by a natural bloodline do you know the difference between those In Those Old Testament oh I don't say they couldn't get inspired I don't say God couldn't reveal things to them and show but not like today it's a completely different thing as it is today the blood of bulls and Bullocks and goats and lambs and things will not cover the sin of a human being today they could Slaughter every lamb in the field it would not take your sin away amen cuz there was only one and John declared him Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sins of the world Amen and as he was declared to be who he was that's the only lamb that can wash away our sins GL to God they all had their place they all had their time and the voice of their blood spoke for the people of that dispensation but now we have a more excellent way and that is the blood of the Lord Jesus Christ and the life thereof Hallelujah notice now the men of God the ministry become the voice of God hold on under their messenger saying only what Paul said saying what all the rest of them said I was preaching in a church quite far north from here and if any of these folks are streaming me and they hear me say this you forgive me I'm not say anything ugly about you but there's a group up there and some of them are just absolute brandom worshippers and I I told them so so I'm not hiding anything and I told him I said to hold brother brandham to that kind of a standard that brother brandham had a superior Revelation to everybody else nonsense and hogwash William brandham never done what he done done on his own all right now here come our Critics on the other side that's right he plagiarized everything please for God's sakes please go back and look at the definition of plagiarism plagiarism is to make it your own and not tell nobody where you got it and I go all through the message of the hour and show you places that brother B talked about amen Clarence Lark and all the rest of them that he studied after he made no bones or no exceptions about telling us that he had to study and read and find out what these men believe to find what the Holy Spirit would say for the age he never heal hid that or concealed that from us he told us right off the bat what was going on in the beginning that's not plagiarism that's using work to try to uh previous work to try to establish an understanding on something is it me plagiarizing if I stand here and quote Paul and didn't tell you Paul said it you got your own Bible you know where it come from do I have to stand up here and say to you every time I say it now the Apostle Paul said Jesus Christ the same yesterday and forever brother R knew people studyed they understood where they could get these things that's right if he was trying to conceal it from us he would have done something so much different change words change phrases change dates made it look like he didn't get it from them at all but he was dumb enough to even use their own diagrams and things like that I guess there were no libraries in the 50s and the 60s that people could go find these books for themselves I guess they wasn't selling them on bookshelves brother Jesse I guess it was only brother Bram that had his very personal copy right wasn't plagiarism he was doing what God called him to do which is take all of the truths for 2,000 years and tie them together and solve and answer these questions for us and he didn't have a superior Revelation he went beyond the curtain of time and said I preach exactly what Paul preached where did Paul get where God in sunry times and diverse manners spake unto us he's putting himself in there you know wo Glory oh that was fresh and new I like that spoke unto us by the fatherto the fathers by our prophets he didn't get it on his own either he quoted so many different places that all of those men said and if you go through Paul's own letter he didn't go around and say now John said Jeremiah said Ezekiel said every great now then you'll hear him say as it is written well and by the terms and definitions of most people today Paul was a plagiarizer but it ain't true that's right it ain't true it's just absolutely not the truth it's people with an agenda who have been hurt hurt by message Theory hurt by message ideas hurt by message dogmas that's right brother that's right and really what these people need they don't realize that they need deeper healing than some of our own people sitting in the pews yes sir yes sir because to take such an attack against one man like that that ought to tell you something yes if the message is false why care just walk off and leave well we're going to warn everybody else to wear where you going to take us when you're done warning me what church should I believe oh just believe the Bible and be a good Christian well good for you you now join the same Club as 900 different denominations all saying the same foolishness love Jesus you'll go to heaven not everybody that loves Jesus is going to heaven I got news for you it ain't whether you love Jesus or not it's whether Jesus loves you that's right oh you say he loves everybody be careful of that Jacob have I love and Esau have I hated there is a perfect hatred that comes from the Holy Spirit when you cross that word he'll Mark your name out of the book and you're done that's right you think he has love for Judas you think he has concern and care for Judas he did it one time but when he crossed the line that was it God can't love and hate a man at the same time his own nature condemns him to be mixed minded like that that's right right amen amen the denominational thinking is well just love God and just serve the Lord and just read your Bible really okay we've had this book for 2,000 years and still we got organization trinitarianism false baptisms of all kind beliefs on Holiness that's every Wich of place I've been going back through brother Jesse's book again and I got I bought me a a journal just for the purpose of going through the book been making notes and things like that and about about back through the first four chapters again and I tell you to me it was so beautiful and I put a flower Bud on him before amen the grave gets him amen amen but I thought it was so beautiful how the idea one of the premises of the book behind all that was written was not this idea you better do this or you'll going to hell but it was the idea of if you love God you want to be the most pleasing to him that you can you want to serve the Lord you want to serve him in the deepness of sincerity so you're willing to do or dress or act in any way that God would be pleased with your life amen and brother Jesse let me say publicly amen I know this goes on this internet I know shame in it but let me say publicly how proud and how much I admire that kind of spirit behind text like that because we've had one quotebook after another we've had one writing after another amen that's constantly pointing Believe it or you're going to hell amen but the real idea behind the message of this hour and I want critics and all to hear me amen is a relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ falling in love with God somebody help me preach right now amen falling in love with the Lord Jesus Christ amen and having your heart full of the Holy Ghost with it you are on your way to hell but not because God wants to send you there because you choose to go there that's right that's the reason you go God don't send nobody to hell they do by their own decisions they send them to hell that's right amen if Jesus had his way if he wanted to have his perfect way I'm willing God he said I don't want anybody to perish that's what I feel in my heart for Humanity I know what kind of condition they got into I set the stage for this all to work out the way it did and if I had my brother so to speak I'd let everybody be saved but God knows they can't he knows it's not possible for everybody to be saved he knows that the serpent seed introduced another spiritual line that's right yes and being that God had to express everything that he was and knowing that he had to open up that window to let the devil come into the human race and start this thing a person as I went through some of the believe the sign material on Facebook the other day I noticed again and again and again a complete repudiation of the serpent Seed doctrine how in the world are we going to know how Satan's working on humankind if we can't find out how he got into the humankind how are we going to know where it all started as I've said to you before a little Tabernacle out here amen Jesus and John the rest of these men when they talked about the devil they called him serpents and snakes of all of the animals they could have chosen the animal kingdom of all the animals that God could have told Moses to put up on a pole why didn't you say put a chimpanzee on a pole why didn't you say put a baboon or put a put a monkey or put a rhinoceros or or an elephant or a giraffe on the pole yes sir all the animals that God wanted to bring healing through why' they have to look at a serpent on a pole why was it a snake that John said you Generation of Vipers down there right cuz God and those men and those prophets know amen where that original sin began amen right back here in the Garden of Eden when there was a creature that stood upright like the serpent amen had the ability to be indwelled by the devil and Satan used that being to interject his human seed that human seed the serpent wasn't a man amen just like we would think but he was was a man just the same sure he was he had a different look he was much taller and bigger than everything else stronger for the Giants come from later that's right brother yes amen and brother even said one place and forgive this I'm using a term from the 50s but I'm quoting this directly from condemnation by representation brother said and throwing it off on the colored race he call them amen we wouldn't say that today we'd say the black race or something like that he said they're as ignorant as they can be the serpant wasn't a monkey he wasn't a reptile he was a man and he was built in a way that his seed line could mix with Eve that's right and he done it and produced twins within that girl from Adam and from The Serpent and then God cursed him and put him on his belly and made him a snake Moses picked him up John picked him up amen they come all the way into the New Testament Church and even in history they're worshiping serpents yes sir yes sir why John called it that old serpent that old Dragon called the devil amen why are these things being concealed number one God hides it from the eyes of the wise and prudent but he reveals it to Baby such as we learn I want to say something to you little church I don't care what you're going through I don't care what mistakes you made I don't care how down you feel on yourself if you've got a teachable spirit within you that wants to know what's right that alone ought to be enough to make you rise to your feet and scream to the top of your lungs and say thank you Jesus for keeping your hand on my life Hallelujah Glory amen I mean if you want to be just the least bit teachable the least bit understanding amen get an understanding rather from the word of God and be understood and the things that you are dealing with as a Christian it ought to put pride in your heart a pride in your heart to say Lord thank you thank you for loving me and caring for me and not giving up on my life no matter what came my way amen it ought to make us rejoice it ought to make us like Jesus he said father I thank you I thank you that you've hid these things from the eyes of the wise Hallelujah God amen and praise the Lord and Hallelujah now notice again in this first chapter Paul is now introducing to them and backgrounding them the change from the Old Testament to the New Testament in Hebrews chapter two Paul continues to position Christ in his supreme authority just background these and find out the pattern of this as I said all seven chapters I don't mean chronologically or sequentially but the thought that Paul is bringing he's building up all of the background to get to his main idea the second chapter he is positioning Christ as Supreme deity go back and read that second chapter Hebrews and watch again if Paul didn't say it over and over and over again made him a little lower than the Angels thou has put all things under subjection under his feet it becomes him who are all things by whom are all things and bringing many sons unto glory to make the captain of their salvation per perfect through suffering on and on chapter three he identifies him as the high priest of the New Testament and it continues to bridge the gap in chapter three between the Jews of the Old Testament and how there is a new generation of Believers given a covenant through Jesus Christ all right then you pick up chapter four Paul tells us that we are to enter into this promise of God not like those of the Old Testament who and I quote not to plagiarize of course but to quote they had their hearts hardened to the truth but Christ gave them a natural Sabbath but unto us we are given a spiritual one in Christ Jesus anybody remember what Hebrews 4:12 says for the word of God is quick and more powerful sharper than a two-edged sword dividing aunder between the finest parts of humanity spirituality and anything else in the universe chapter five he establishes Jesus as the new high priest and he explains the New Order of mzc Hebrews chapter 6 Paul is admonishing us to leave those former things and move on into Perfection we use Hebrews chapter 6 and we quote it for the New Testament Church but he's really not even talking of the New Testament Church as much as he is showing we need to leave those old things in the Old Testament right because he tells us baptisms resurrections of the Dead they had all of that in the Old Testament friends yes good John baptized praise the Lord yes many of them establish the the message as we would say that's right A lot of the things Paul is referring to in this sixth chapter he is talking he is still Bridging the Gap between the old and between the new oh God if you look at it right you can see it plain as day he's not even got to his main thought yet and yet they go back to verses 1 and two and Hebrews 1 and one and Hebrews 1 and two and say see there no more prophets well if you just keep reading through the next seven chapters you'll see that's not even idea at all that's right he's not even talking about thatl that's not even his subject that might be their subject but that's not Paul's that's right brother good wo come on now Hallelujah right he's establishing something completely different than what they're talking about look again he talks about leaving the former things moving into Perfection to Christ and to not become a borderline believer as they did back there in verse seven he is connecting the Old Testament priesthood with the New Testament priesthood under mesic now let's turn to Hebrews chapter 8 let's pick up about six verses there now Paul is coming in to the main idea everything he started in the very first verse now he's brought it to the Apex here he's been preaching for seven chapters now he's going to hit the secret of the message this is the thing he been holding in his heart he's been driving them building them up to get him and it puts me in mind amen when brother bam went down to Arkansas some years ago amen after he preaches I think it was the Third Exodus or perhaps he brings the thir Exodus after that amen he goes down amen into Hot Springs I think it was or Lon perhaps one of those amen and it was Sam Johnson one of our brothers right down there in Michigan amen who had I called him up one day I said Sam brother Braham said that he was down there in Arkansas trying to get them people out of that thing they were trying to get into I said Sam you were there that you were the campaign manager I said what was brother Bram trying to keep them people from you know what he told me he said brother br had that group of people down there that was Oneness of God true Oneness baptized correctly believe Holiness believed everything like we Believers believed he said but they were trying to organize and denominate that belief to protect it they said and brother Bram went down there to try to swing them out of that idea of organizing and you know what he done for three and four Services he preached and built them up for three or four days to the sign of the Messiah isn't that amazing that he's trying to keep them from organizing and he spends his entire Revival bringing them up to the point to where he's showing them the sign of the Messiah well why would he do that because we all know the sign of the Messiah and the prophet was a signpost not pointing backwards to denomination those ages had already run out but pointing them ahead to the new message of God the opening of the seven celles come on somebody help me right now he was pointing them ahead and he knew if you didn't couldn't see the sign you couldn't move on that's right brother but if they could see Jesus Christ Hallelujah standing there in human flesh again amen designing the very thoughts and intents of the heart as he did with Abraham and the rest of them he would say if he was standing right here in this business suit he said what would he say to us he said would he act exactly the same as he did then let's see if that same Jesus is here C the prayer L now sister you're not from here your name is so and so and you live it so and so you've got such and such disease now let's see if Abraham am man had the promise of God Elohim you see if that Elohim is still here and he turned his back and he said now you over here and you over there yes amen oh I know I know I know they say that technology was so powerful and so great back then they had a little system worked out where people could understand their names and he he had all that memorized isin't it amazing when it comes to discernment brother had a perfect memory when it comes to telling a story he didn't good brother good very good pot can't call Kettle greasy folks and a white man can't speak with a forked tongue said Mr Indian brother that's right that's right right either he had a bad memory or he didn't right but you're taking a prophet who did have a bad memory about things you say he didn't he said he did yes hallelujah oh oh oh we got quiet on that one well let's just throw a quote in there and support it and break it up but said now here I'm standing here he said I'm got getting to be an old man I can't remember things like I used to I think he said I may call the number wrong but he said I used to be able to remember 60 or 70 scriptures without opening my Bible he said now I got to write it all down he said if you'd see my notes a star passing over a bridge and things like that what was those notes for to help him remember Hallelujah right oh I know I know we're just giving B too much credit we're just giv I'm giving him all the same Grace I'd give to anybody else I give that to pastors I give that to evangelist teachers Apostles I give it to anybody a prophet whoever he might be I give it to lay people painters Farmers Factory workers Auto Workers I give it to everybody yes sir yes sir amen I don't care who they are or what your color is or what nation they come from or how tall or skinny or fat or ugly or pretty or what I don't care who they are amen I give everybody the credit and the benefit of the doubt that sometimes they just can't remember things yes Amen brother amen hallelujah amen oh my here's the beauty of it in questions and answers brother R is misquoting one of the scriptures in Revelation 5 and calling it wrong one of the old men he's dead now used to come by the house all the time fell about him anded Iverson brother BR said who who what's the matter somebody's sick everybody okay what's going on in here he said everybody right my so brother Ned holler read it again brother Bram oh the scripture the scripture oh I see now yes and brother ramman they put it in Capital H is which the only time Jeff lville should be putting in capitals on there like that his brother br's voice ain't the capital letter by the way his vocal cords is a small letter that was a son of man little a revealing the son of man that's the capital right we shouldn't capitalize brother bram's name and make some kind of big powerful thing out of it when he was just an instrument of God who would have quoted it wrong and a Nazarene told him to change it good brother good the scripture brother said he Capital H was so determined that I wouldn't miss that and that same prophet of God goes right on there preaching about 7,000 and calls it 700 six or seven different times in the very same paragraph and God never stopped him not one time you know why because people could understand what had happened we should afford to profit the same kind of Grace now as we did then Amen brother amen praise the Lord somebody same you should afford to your pastor well brother Jesse just don't understand that maybe he don't well he just don't get it maybe he don't that's right what's wrong with that last I check God doesn't use this most Superior genetic streamline to lead the bride believe me when I tell you I am the dumbest box of rocks you've ever seen in your entire life and if it wasn't for the grace of God I wouldn't have nothing to my name we don't lead because we're smart because we got a good memory because we're intelligent because we're charismatic we lead because we're led by the Lord that's right we make mistakes we do things wrong hello yes sir even you sir even the congregation it's easy for pastors and preachers alike to misunderstand their congregations I've had people stare a hole through me and I think that fell that woman she's disagreeing with every word to come my mouth come they're the only ones in the church was listening that night it's an easy thing to get in there and misunderstand that's why we have to look at one another Through The Eyes of Grace Grace of God grace is the cry Grace is the Cry of the Capstone Bride of the last day amen notice now Hebrews 81 let let let me hurry we're already past 12 now of the things which we have spoken this is the sum don't don't don't rush past that Linger on that a moment seven chapters Paul has been talking about things he comes to 81 and now he's going to sum up everything he's been talking about here's Paul's main idea starting at Hebrews 1 and one we have such a high priest who is set on the right hand of the Throne of the Majesty in the heavens what all kind of people you think he's talking to you think he'd preached this brand new to the Ephesians did he need to go to the Galatians and tell them you have a high priest no Paul was preaching this kind of stuff to the Galatians you are already sealed under the day of your Redemption amen Ephesians chapter 1 after you heard the word of Truth you he's talking to them you were sealed by that Holy Spirit of Promise the message was direct that they were already in but this Hebrews group wasn't he is evangelizing to people who don't know Christ and don't understand the mystery of the day they're living in oh God but Austin I love it amen he is showing plainly you don't know what hour you're living in so I'm going to show you chapter 8 verse one here is the sum of everything I've been saying as a Jew as a Hebrew you already know God in sunry times and diverse manners spake to us but now he's speaking differently this is I'm again I'm going to say it again and again and again to get the point down and nail it down hard heart this is not a declaration of the end the the ending of the prophetic offices God didn't turn around and say I'm going to do away all the prophets he turned around and gave them not only am I going to give you prophets but I'm going to give you Shepherds after my own heart too and evangelist set on fire as a fire breath and teachers to establish the truth hallelujah and apostles is one sent to go out there and missionary the entire church and if we can get if we can get it tonight maybe the Lord willing amen he said for the work of the ministry tree all that other is plural until he comes there cuz there's only one Ministry that we're looking at that's that ministry right there the ministry of Jesus Christ I have only been given a borrowed gift right yes sir this gift is not mine I don't own it I'm responsible for it I'm responsible for its use for its Effectiveness and for what I do with this gift but it's not mine Hallelujah he gave me a portion of his own Ministry for the work and the edification of the saints of God the body of Christ praise the Lord so you can be people walking around my Ministry my church and my sheep they're as ignorant as dumb as they can be spiritually speaking yes sir they're foolish when it comes to understanding the things of God this is not your church these are not your sheep it's not your ministry if God called you at all it's God's Ministry he just let you partake in his gift amen hallelujah amen amen that goes for singing or anything else no matter what that gifting is God gave it he shared it with you to be a blessing to the body of Christ hallelujah amen it's not your gift it's God's Gift given to you hallelujah thank you Jesus look verse two a minister of the sanctuary I love that this word a public Minister a servant of the state one busied with holy things oh I love that so Paul now is telling us that Jesus our high priest is busied with holy things for all y'all that might have had yourself picturing Jesus sitting up on a box somewh another doing nothing but just kind of taking it easy with his feet kicked up just forgiving a few sins every now and then you don't realize how hard Jesus works every single day he might have rested on the seventh day but he's busy otherwise he might have retired from the job of making the worlds and the dimensions and those things but he's like every other retiree he just don't sit around lay around do nothing he goes to work in other places woo thank you Jesus and he's been doing that for 6,000 years amen he rested on the seventh day and HED it and called it holy and then started busying himself amen with mankind he still feed sparrows yes so if he's still feeding sparrows I know he's still listening he's still watching he's still hovering he's still protecting he's still brooding Oh Glory to God God he buses himself as a minister of holy things beauti amen I'm so glad to be a part of the family of God and of the true Tabernacle which the Lord pitched and not man for every high priest is ordained to offer gifts and sacrifices wherefore it is of necessity that this man have somewhat also to offer now what does it sign like this does not sound like a man that is preaching to save people this is a man preaching to Jews this is a man preaching to those steeped and stooped in Judaism and they are so deep in it that they don't see what God's done in that generation and Paul is introducing to him what God's done the same as you I would find some old Baptist or Methodist or a presbyterian some old fell out there am man or some woman or something that's been a a Methodist or whatever they had their whole life hey hey man hey you heard what God done in this last day the promise of Malachi 4 the promise of Luke 17 the promise of Revelation 10 God in this last generation this last day oh I know I know buddy God in Sury times and diverse manners spake in that church of yours and some of those forefathers you had but in the last days God's taken a man in this day to speak to us the things of God and restore the original faith of the fathers that's exactly what Paul is doing he's witnessing to these people the same as we be witnessing to somebody else about our generation amen oh I love it for if he were on Earth he should not be a priest seeing the priest that offer gifts are according to the law so Jesus wasn't a law a priest according to the law how could you come from the tribe of Arian when you are the tribe of Aaron hello somebody how can you be a levite when you are the levite where do you think they come from he's the main one Hallelujah he is the priest according to not the law but watch they served unto the example of a Shadow and Shadow of heavenly things as Moses was admonished of God when he was about to make the Tabernacle see saith he that they'll make all things according to the pattern showed to thee in the mount but now turn to Christ now he hath obtained what a more excellent Ministry by much also he is the mediator of a what better Covenant which was established upon what better promises now this does not sound to me like a man who is talking to Born Again believers who are following Jesus Christ and preaching the gospel and establishing churches God and Sury times and divers manners but now have spoken to us by his son I see there no more prophets when you look at it through the whole seven chapters up to this eth chapter right here you can see it does not even in the subject matter that wasn't even Paul's thought Paul's not even looking at in that direction he's not even studying in that direction that's not his purpose his intent or his main idea every author has a purpose behind their writing and if you know the author's purpose you know what he's writing about and remember I learned this in college when I was first learning how to write and speak and be a smart guy which I'm still not there but I got a paper that says I'm supposed to be but I ain't but I learned the first thing you need to know is you need to know your audience for example there's some of our Saints in here that their their motherland is not America you come from GH or these other places like that so if I had a whole church full of Gins believe me when I tell you I spoke to over 5,000 of them at a time I don't go under those churches like that and use all of the American terms and slangs and idioms and jargons when I'm driving up and down the street and and brothers are packing me around I'm looking at the Billboards I'm looking at the at the at the the stores I'm looking at people how they dress and I'm going to find some way to be able to identify something in Gana with my message try to be a man to all men as Paul said and I'm going to preach along that way and I'm going to say things along that way so that's where I started developing I I've done it just as a little funny thing amen not as a fun making thing to make fun but it's just a little silly thing amen just kind of expressing my own love for the African people but I would be preaching to them and I'd hit a little point and I go ah and every one of them they know what I was talking about cuz them African Saints hit that little and I love I get done I hear them brothers they come around they say now look at there that's one reason we love brother Ben he speaks like us well I meant to because I want to be able to relate the gospel of what I know and relate it in a way that they can feel the most home with it it's the most effective that way amen and I may not hit every custom and culture just exactly that way but I'm going to preach the gospel and present it in the best way I humanly know and here's Paul is a Jew who knows his own Hebrew people and he is presenting it to them in the language they understand this whole book of Hebrews is Paul dealing with his own kind the Ephesians wasn't his own the Galatians wasn't his own many of those were Gentiles that had come into the truth through the preaching of the Gospel many of those Gentile people had come in under the truth of Paul's message hearing maybe Peter or or or bolom or some of the other ones preach Thomas or whoever it might have been they heard the gospel preach and came in as Gentiles but now Paul is talking to his own right so now Paul might have done a little every now and then right he's relating the message oh can you see it friends can you understand it he's talking to his own kind he knows that they cannot see that gap between the prophets and Jesus so where does he start at the very place he needs to God in sunry times and divers manners it's like any Jew that believes their prophet he knows better than to walk out there and present them a letter that discredits The Messengers that came before him that's right he knows better than to present the Gospel of Jesus Christ without acknowledging the ones that brought the truth in the first place Hallelujah very good so he spoke unto our fathers by the prophets I love that man's boldness but now in the last days woo said hold back a little bit Paul give him a little bit more Runway said you kidding these are my people I know them I'm just hitting them with a blood Hammer yes sir I give them one verse to get warmed up here we [Laughter] go Glory that's how God deals with all of us in the way that we think the way we're made up Amen in every culture God will deal with them in that certain way to help them understand what is truth all right let's go a little bit further let's quit now in Exodus chapter 25: 8-9 this is where he tells them to make a sanctuary that I may dwell among them according to all that I show this is what Paul was quoting from after the pattern of the Tabernacle the pattern of the instruments thereof even so shall ye make it so if we're talking about amen living in this true Tabernacle now Paul is going to spend the rest of the time dealing with how we get there now you and I we don't have to take that Journey this morning or tonight but suffice it to say that when we start coming in just look at this I'm just going to pick up one in Hebrews chapter 10 verse one the law having a shadow of good things to come not the very image can never with those sacrifices they offered year by year make the CER there unto perfect for the worshipper once purged should have no more conscience of sin that's right do you understand folks he's not talking to Believers yet they're potential Believers they're still living outside they haven't come into Christ yet still in the 10th chapter he's still trying to show them how to achieve true for oh my God hallelujah why couldn't he just say to them well you believe the message of prophets are already saved cuz they wasn't they might have been Justified and Sanctified under the law but the Tabernacle was now rent in Twain and the earthquake that happened at Mount Calvary they say the temple was right below Calvary and when the earthquake Struck it it took the temple and rattled it right in half until the veil of the temple was completely ripped in half God showing that the priesthood was changing because you remember unless a priest died or somehow if he would take and there was a symbol that he would use take His Garment by the collar and rip it in half and it was a strong collar WRA time many many times over and the think of the anger that cus had when he grabbed his collar and rent it like that be like like some of these super guys amen these big powerful bodybuilders ripping a phone book in half that's how mad Jesus made him and with all that demon power hiding in cesis that little backslid message believer anyways he had enough power to take that car and rip it in half you know how to shine that there was a new priesthood coming in yes woo that the old Tabernacle was gone away and a new priest would take over in a new Tabernacle and Not only would he forgive us of our sins once a year but he'd forgive us forever past present and future that's why when I'm in trouble I go to the blood when I'm hopeless I go to the blood when I'm sick I go to the blood when I need Joy I go to the blood and the blood is the power thereof the life thereof Hallelujah that's how I receive the Holy Ghost the breaking of that blood cell the breaking of the promise of God and down upon my heart comes the baptism of the Holy Ghost all the way Plum over you just keep on turning he's all the way over here into chapter 11 faith is the substance of things not seen he spends an entire chapter reviewing to them why their brothers and their fathers and their people done what they've done well it's a good thing to do don't discredit the Believers before you like some of us message people do right throw off on Pentecostals and throw off on these people somebody come from a denomination throw you don't know anything in that old Baptist church or you don't don't you say that to them Faith LED them somewhere it may have only LED them to salvation but Faith LED them somewhere amen I'm acquainted with a a brother he's a message believer to this day he's not a preacher or nothing like that but got saved in Billy Graham's meeting and it preachers right say billy goat Graham and he was just an unbeliever an impostor shame on him everybody gets a start somewhere don't get quiet on me come on everybody gets a start somewhere their faith took them through this Hall of Fame just like that Faith may have led them to a Baptist Church and if they're True Believers that faith will lead them right through that system right into something else right into something else because once Jesus starts leading you you don't always have to be right in Canaan land to be led by the Holy Ghost you can still be in the wilderness and sanctification and the Journey you could still be following under the baptism of the Holy Ghost man of Fallen daily and not having nothing in your soul you can still go through every stage of the journey yes sir and God still be leading you Hallelujah he comes all the way up now in Hebrews chapter 12 now he's established and we have are compassed about with a great cloud of witnesses following peace chapter 13 let Brotherly Love continue oh my and he finishes out Grace be with you all amen salute all of them that have rule over you and all the saints in Italy Salute You Grace be with you all he's finishing the letter around by bringing them into true Christianity for you that are born again he's establishing the people in the faith he takes them from chapter one at the very very Foundation of it all by time he gets to the 13th chapter he finishes out with that amen that's the Capstone of everything he's been trying to bring so this book is not an indictment of prophetic offices this book of Hebrews is not an indictment of the prophetic it is a journey from when God spoke in the Old Testament to Jesus being established in the new to what God's going to do all the way through it because don't forget it's in that 13th chapter somewhere around verse 8 where he said Jesus Christ is the same Hallelujah praise the Lord amen God establishing the entire gospel in this book of Hebrews let's stand let's stand praise be to God let's bow our heads together Lord Jesus we so thank you today how powerful how Mighty and how wonderful is your word and your truth Lord people may want to make fun of us for this truth and for what we believe you know Lord as far as my heart's concerned that's up to them never do I want to come to a place to where I feel like that Within Myself that I know everything I've read this book of Hebrews so many different times in my service to you and yet Lord just the other day you opened it up to me to see different things that i' never seen before that's what I love about your word Lord no matter what's being said or how we read it it's an eternal thing that just keeps opening opening opening and opening take the dictionary and do that it won't read the encyclopedia it had does have that power but every word of God establishes a new truth in there somewhere whatever angle you show us whatever Direction you take us it shows us what is right and what is true and Lord we thank you so much for unfolding this little part of this today I believe it's a help Lord and for whatever reason Lord I felt just compelled by you to preach it like I've been preaching it maybe dealing with that critical side of these things and Lord I know somebody might get it try to use it against me or try to make me look bad but Lord I I don't mean it like I'm coming up here for the purpose of attacking but Lord in my heart I really wish some of these people could see it in a better way I know how other folks have been damaged by these things in the world and denominations have discredited prophetic offices even if you turned on TV BN or some religious station or you got on serus or one of these satellite programs some internet station if the subject of a prophet of God comes up they're either going to be for it but some ridiculous version of it or they're going to be completely against it and Lord we know that counterfeits are always sent before the true arrives and there's been Elijah's coats Elijah's manels and all of those things that come to this day even the very man that established the Jehovah Witness got a same got the same pyramid Capstone called himself the seventh angel said the seals would come open Lord It's not that what they said was wrong all of them were falling under the anointing of the hour probing and probing and probing but the problem is they didn't have the call or the prophetic office or the min Ministry prophesied to tie together every one of those loose ends so for Generations they probed at it Lin had some things right he was a very spiritual man in many ways same Lin was a trinitarian some of the very same simple things that brother brenon pulled out of his truth he didn't go along with the second person of a godhead do we turn around and say about to hust and these guys Lord that that these men that the bride is the h 44,000 and were saved by regeneration of the water lord every one of these people probed it what's true but without a messenger of God in the last day to tie it together and take truth from here and here and here and here we wouldn't understand what the full truth of the whole thing is many were working a puzzle as it were but not many could put it together by the spiritual discernment of the holy spirit so father thank thank you for brother Brenham thank you for this message yes Hallelujah I would never be bold enough to call him a liar I'd never be bold enough to say that he was wrong even though I know there's many times that he missed things and misunderstood it but that doesn't make him completely wrong if it does then I'm in a mess cuz Lord there been many times my Revelation has developed and changed and I I've evolved over the years from what I believ 20 years ago 10 years ago I've seen different truths Lord we preach what we get when we get it we try our best to deliver to the people and Lord if they can see it they can see it if they can't they can't but Lord would you be kind enough to not only Open the Eyes of those that are sitting here today to what I've preached but Lord in your sweetness will you go to those critics out there with all their websites and all their materials and all their things cuz Lord I know there's been an attack against this little church but Lord I don't speak ill of them I don't speak meanness to them not not this point I'm not saying a mean thing to them I'm praying Lord that like you said that you would open their eyes that they could see what's right for Lord every one of us visible and invisible we've been hurt by things in the world we've been offended by people in the message folks say things to us we hear things going around and some people they've sheltered themselves away from it and almost get scared to hear anything and that's not wise either Lord we have to open our eyes and our ears to understand the day and the time we're living The Good the Bad and the Ugly and Lord we need to have an answer for the hope that lays within us so father at the end of this message the best that I can do to try to show the people and establish us as Christian Believers in this one little thought that you never indicted prophetic offices for this day Hallelujah but Lord you established them through the ministry of Paul and now as you gave gifts unto men now there is an order of the church which if you're willing in a few hours time we'll come right back here to this church I'll come to this platform we'll pick it right back up in Corinthians and go to show that divine order of the believing Church of God if it Be Your Will that you'd let that be just that way I pray you'll meet us back here at this platform Lord and anoint the people open our hearts to be able to receive it and understand why we come to church what the benefit of being in church was and why we need Ministry and why we need the gifts of the Spirit why we need the workings of the Holy Spirit if it be thy will bring us back at this appointed time and season as we ask it for your grace and Your Glory by your grace and For Your Glory in Jesus name amen and amen can't you see why I'm [Music] happy I've accepted the word of the Lord the re word that was spoken by the prophet of Mali can you sing it with some Revelation this morning can't you see why I'm happy I accepted the word of the [Music] Lord word that was SP come by the prophet of Mali for why don't you raise your hand sing it to the Lord now you see see why I happy amen amen I've accepted the word of the Lord yes I have oh with a word that was spok by the prophet of Mal for all is well all is well we have heard the the message shalone all is well for there is a place of bir we heard about it this morning behind that in Veil so rest little bride rest for all is well and all is well amen glory and all aren't you glad about it Saints oh we we have heard so all is way for there is a place place of bur to rest behind the end so oh rest little bride rest for all is well I want to sing this for he us Believers and for the critics as well now listen I keep saying this like I'm saying it because this is the way the Holy Spirit told me to approach this this morning but Jesse I ain't got no idea why I'm doing it this way just the Lord put it in my mouth just this way I don't even know what's been going on up this way but I can tell you this much I know what Jesus told me to do so I want to sing it like this to you as Believers and to the critics as well now things have not worked out the way God's people thought for we're still here fighting the the greatest battle ever fought but we must have the faith of Abraham knowing God's word never fails that if we'll trust in him here a Critic it don't matter you'll find that all is well amen glory all is way all is well we have heard the message to love all is well for there is a place of perfect rest but it's behind that new Tabernacle Oh Glory rest in of rde rest for all is well B you hands with me just a moment as they play softly now I wonder if somebody here this morning or even tonight whenever they might hear this message perhaps you're even a Critic of the truth but maybe something you might be a Critic in here this morning I don't know but perhaps something in your heart has resonated with the little truth that I've tried to bring you I don't know it all and I don't try to be a know- it- all if I am God forgive me but maybe something inside of you maybe you've even been wavering about what is right maybe you're sitting here listening on the internet and you're a Critic truly but God's been dealing with you to look at things in a different way maybe you would see the holy spirit's calling to you to change your mindset maybe the Lord's trying to show some of you people that's listening to my voice maybe your way of approach has just been affected by the people you've hung around maybe them birds of a feather you shouldn't have been flocking together with anywhere there's a counterfeit there's got to be a real somewhere and maybe you're even a Critic you might have YouTube channels I don't care what you got but if you're here or abroad or wherever you might be and in your heart you know God's dealing with you to change your mind away from the things you've been following you want to be different I want you wherever you are here or wherever to raise your hand to the Lord and say Jesus according to what I believe you're dealing with me about and what brother Ben's been preaching about and what the holy spirit's been saying I feel I need to be different as of today this morning tonight wherever you may be won't you raise your hand up to the Lord at this moment and say god father forgive me Lord I followed the wrong influences and I want to be different I want to be changed show me what's true show me what's truth and what is right and I'll Follow You Lord and say it in Jesus Christ's name and mean it and watch and see if God won't visit you right where you're at but be weary take heed it may be your last opportunity last call that God ever deal with you so don't take it lightly don't take it lightly don't lay that down lightly say Lord here I am whatever you want to do with me don't throw me away but remold my clay remake me shape me again in a new image take away all of my hurts and my ills and my fears these Spooks and specters that surround these truths and these words of people help me not to look to websites into men leaning to their arms of own understanding but help me look to the word of God the Holy Spirit and to a prayer life to lay before your word ask you to show me what's true and to lay there until you fill me with the Holy Ghost and solve the sin question of my heart and life Grant it Lord in Jesus name if there be anybody in the sound of my voice lost don't know Jesus as their savior you want to get saved tonight this morning morning whenever you hear this if you're in this building this morning same to you as it would be to anybody else you want to raise your hand Lord say I'm a sinner and I need to be saved just raise your hand to the Lord God bless you God bless you God bless you God bless you the Father in Heaven who knows all things sees every hand every life every heart maybe he's just trying to attack a spirit this morning that might be working on maybe your mind who knows but don't let that word depart from your heart hide it deep within your heart child don't let go of the things you know that are pure and right leaning to the arm of one's understanding for David said he that leans to the arm of flesh is cursed already Simon bar Jonah Flesh and Blood didn't reveal this but my Father which is in heaven he opens a door no man can open and shuts one no man can shut he is the GI of Revelation and life alone he is the giver and the Fountain of eternal life and all you got to do is open your heart receive him and say Lord I'm a sinner and I need a savior You Are My Savior do for me what I can't do myself forgive me wash me cleanse me Purify Me keep me right and in Jesus name from today on I promise to serve you Lord with every footstep with every thought with every intention and I do it in the name and I ask it in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and him crucified and resurrected on the third day in Jesus Christ's name hallelujah how many you just believe with me for all things once you raise your hand up to the Lord let's give him praise for it right now somehow God's been supernaturally dealing with people I'm telling you that right now all these years I've been preaching I can't think of a time even since we had the first defections in this message I can't think of a time I've seen the Holy Spirit go into it like this brother Jesse not my intention to take the directions I hope people hear and everywhere I hope you're listening hope you're opening your heart to the Holy Spirit and say Lord Teach Me Guide Me show me what's right show me what's truth and if you want to know a greater portion of this I challenge you here and abroad come back into the message tonight sit down at my feet a little while and let me teach you what the Church of the Living God looks like amen because I promise you as a minister I only mean it for your good and for your benefit Hallelujah he is a minister unto thee for good and not for evil May the Holy Spirit bless us now as we give him thanks for all he's done for all things for all things and whatever need you might have this morning if you want you like to come be prayed for I'm going to turn it back to brother Jesse let him lead the service out you come right over here to the side I'll come pray for you if you have a need you know I I'm the world's worst about the anointing oil part of it it's not that I don't believe in it but brother B said when you had certain kinds of gifts he said you know the oil you put it on the person the oil he said is there to protect you from that Spirit that's on that person me a sickness or whatever it is he said but if there's a gift there like healing or faith or something like that he said that gift stands between you and that person so I've never been one for the oil but not that I won't use it if you want it you want to be anointed of oil for some reason hey that's all right brother Jesse's always standing ready I'm it ready we pray for you know where we can otherwise let's worship a little bit as our brother comes and we'll close out this morning saying it's been good to be in the house of the Lord can you say Amen to that it's been good to be in the house of the Lord this morning his presence has been so rich and so sweet and so deep this morning I just I've been a long time since I've seen him come to battle for lost souls like this morning that's what he was doing partly there's somebody on that camera out there that God's dealing with brother Jesse and I don't know what's been going on on your side of the world out here but God's dealing with somebody out there I'm telling you and I don't know maybe somebody in here has been affected by things if you have you listen to the voice of the holy spirit this morning let God deal with your heart because I can tell you right now looking at the Bible the way I see it the way that I believe it to be true there's no way that all of these other things could be right that we don't believe in church anymore people do away with paying ties how in the world can we even call oursel Believers if we're not willing to take a portion of our money and give it into the church I know there's been preachers turned into fat cats and driving Mercedes and living high on the hog I get that but I shop at Walmart and some of those fat cats sitting in their million dollars home do the same thing some of you will vote Democrat Michelle Obama talking the other night about how she' like to see things uh distributed to the poor in her $50 million worth of property that her and Barack live in I don't say they don't earn it and don't deserve it but let's look at the thing in the right way why would we take a tenth of our living and bring it to the church why why would we take our offerings and give them unto the Lord you know why we don't do it because we just don't understand the benefit of church anymore we've lost that Vision brother Jesse people I hear them all the time sick in their body and troubled and have a need they'll come to me after church I was going to go up there I thought maybe I should I wanted you to pray for me but but what what you come to church for that's right to come in with a burden and leave with a bigger one why do we come to the house of God so we can be relieved of the burdens that's within our body spirit and soul and to re receive to receive instruction in the things of God and how to be a better Christian how we might please him betterall right but you know in this day and age if you ain't got some big great charismatic Ministry and you're kicking the walls out of things and seeing angels and listen I'm a man that believes in the Supernatural I don't say this bragging but just to show you my words are powerful sometimes the way I present myself it sounds like I'm swinging One Direction but I believe in all these Supernatural things I've spoken tongues I've prophesied I've interpreted I've laid hands on the sick I've manifested every spiritual nine gift I've seen the love of God in my life to be able to look at men that I knew was going to going to kill me and love them just like brother BR Lov the bull and the bees I've I've felt the presence of angels of the Lord I've seen the pillar of fire a time or two in my life I've heard God's voice speak to me audibly right here in my heart I've seen the supernatural God do many many things in the 30 plus years that I've served him since a boy many years ago when I was a boy that cloud I told you the cloud put right on top of the trees I wasn't even saved yet I wasn't even full of the Holy Ghost yet I was out flying kites with my daddy and I was out there at 12 years old and my kite had taken a nose D brother Jesse and I went out there to go run and grab it I picked up the cord like this and went to turn and run so I could pull it up in the air and right on top of the trees and it was one of those blue sky Ohio days without a cloud in the sky and that seven angel cloud appeared right on top of the trees and I stood there and looked at it for 10 minutes long and I knew it wasn't no rocket ship smoke and I knew it wasn't some fig somebody's imagination cuz that picture hung on my pastor's wall in our church and I studied until I knew every little whip of the tail and right there it was in front of my eyes 40 years nearly I went down my life wondering why God let me see that until all of a sudden one of these boys got on the internet and started hitting against the cloud again this is an old debate anyways talking about it being fake and being false and how it wasn't true they you or anybody whoever you might be come too late to tell me such a thing yes I saw it with my very own eyes I know it to be the truth I was in Arizona some years ago and some of them that was living during that time time they walked right out on their porch and could see it standing right out in the air they didn't say it looked like a white cloud they said it looked iridescent at night all them seven colors of the rainbow sitting right up in that cloud a rocket don't hang in the air that long smoke don't hang in the air that long but God hides it from the eyes of the wise and prudent some time ago the critics put up a a picture of The Beatles and Ed Sullivan in the same Houston Coliseum it's a black and white photo with those lights above them and they had streaks above them the same as brother Brenham had above him one day that one troubled me I thought boyo how am I going to explain that one that's a toughy because they look exactly the same of course the argument is that George dayy had nothing to do with it well fine fine I'll go your way but the one problem I've got with their photos is they're not in color CU if you saw it in color you wouldn't see a pillar of fire black and white over brother bram's head you'd see this color above the Beatles but above brother Ram's Head would be an ambrish yellow green color see God hides it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and reveals it to babes such as would learn because all you got to do is put it in color baby and you can see what it is what I'm trying to say to you is there's no reason that we should walk out of this church this morning and have any doubts in whom we have already believed that's right that's right God didn't establish the truth and put this church here and send ministers around the world to establish the truth of this message just to let a bunch of people that didn't have the Holy Ghost tear it up a bunch of uneducated and illiterate people didn't know hardly how to write their name and God take them and shake the world with them and then a bunch of intellectuals come along the think because they got a bunch of newspaper clippings and talk to some guy that's got about as much recall about what he ate for supper 20 years ago as what he did in brother Bam's meeting hello we're leaning to the arm of Flesh in these matters when we should be leaning upon one thing the Bible this is my road map right here hallelujah so should I believe in prophets should I believe in a Ministry amen I'm glad y'all saying amen tonight would be a hard message for you if you couldn't say it I'm setting this up for tonight I want you to understand where we're heading we come to church with this idea that this is just a gathering of something we do for religious feeling the purpose of church is so much more than just Gathering under the oaces of religion yes and if you'll give me time tonight and God willing I come back I'm going to take it and show it to you in the Bible and I'm going to show you why we come to the house of the Lord and if you think that your part is just to come here and sit and listen at a preacher you've missed the point of church altogether yes that's right quiet on that one huh I know I know it's hard for us to reconcile in our mind well what am I supposed to do I don't play music I you got a soul did you bring your soul with you yes did you did your two feet bring your soul with you bring your Holy Ghost with you yes H bring your prayer life with you amen or did you leave that at home in the closet somewhere night did you bring your faith yes why didn't y'all answer me some of y'all just looking at me huh did you bring your virtue and your patience and all them with you yes did you bring your Christianity Hallelujah well what did you bring to church for just put on display and let it sit there look pretty you brought it because you are a part of a supernatural Dynamo amen and without you the church cannot Thrive spiritually come back this afternoon you'll see it amen love you if you want prayer I'm going to pray for you come Jesse God bless you my brother
