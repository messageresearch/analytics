========================================

poon that got that assembly started and we have do our did our best to remain a lighthouse there by God's grace in that uh little town there so and regarding that picture brother Jesse sent there that was a uh that was a hard thing for me to do I I um I'm just going to tell you be honest here obviously we always want to be honest but I want to tell you the backstory behind that uh in 2015 uh brother cam wanted me to get ordained and I turned him down and within a couple months my Apprentice died and I always felt like that was the Lord being angry with me and not bringing judgment to me so I've been kind of running uh from this uh maybe whatever this is uh calling or whatever you want to say uh so it was a very humbling thing to get up there and um do that knowing that that my apprentice's life could be the reason he lost it is because of me and uh my wife knows how many times I've wanted to get out of teaching the Bible and doing Bible studies and ministering here or there just uh because you don't feel called you don't feel uh worthy to do it and um it is a dangerous thing obviously we all we all will be judged on that the great day on what we do what we think what we say on uh how we act and those sort of things but saints of God then to the ministry it's now uh here we have to come here and try to find the very mind of God and what God places on your heart and then bring it forth to the wife and bride of Christ and that is a serious thing when you speak to the wife of God you want to be in a certain condition and say the right things so uh in that being said um let's see here I don't know if Sister Casa can get this going for me I hooked up on the other one uh not the not this one but on the other one we'll see but I have a uh PowerPoint by God's grace so this is a little thought that I was listening to a sermon I just jumped out at me and I want to kind of and it led me down a kind of a the same path but on a little side path there and I want to go this way by God's grace this morning and it's a simple study but I want you to to see what what we're up against what our loved ones are under and what we've been called out of so it's a very simple uh study but saints of God the power behind us and what we're fighting and what we're battling is uh maybe more than I even realized as far as the implications of what uh the devil has done in this day and in the age ages that have been before and the system the spiritual system that's been set up um uh to capture the souls of man so and there's so much more to this than we could even now say the see so if we could maybe we'll stand here by God's grace and go to uh the book of Ephesians 6 as my pastor there he he dived in he's kind of went off this topic recently and went into something just as marvelous U but here in Ephesians as we want to be Ephesians uh in this last day in Ephesians 6 vers uh verse 10 through 13 let me see if I can get there myself Ephesians 6 verse 10 through 13 so let's say let's read the scripture here as we approach the king Our Savior our Lord as I heard the prophet say he says many people want him to be uh their God and savior but not many want him to be their lord his he wants uh we want him to be our lord of our lives and to rule and guide us and tell us what to do and be obedient to that that's our that's our hearts cry uh Ephesians 6 ver10 says finally my brethren be strong in the Lord and the power of His might put on the whole armor of God that you may be able to stand against the Ws of the devil and look at verse 12 for we wrestle not against flesh and blood he says uh but principalities and against Powers against the rulers of the darkness of this world against spiritual High wickedness in high places right wherefore take unto you the whole AR of God that you may be able to withstand in the evil day and having done all to stand let's say a word of prayer dear Lord Jesus Lord we love you Lord God and Lord you've been more than wonderful to us Lord God and Lord as we see this day approaching Lord and we come together even the more the Bible says Lord because we're supposed to come together and assemble Lord at your house God it's a it's a commandment God it's it's not a suggestion Lord and Lord Jesus Lord we ask that you would Minister Lord to these people God lord lord all I can do is open my mouth Lord but I want your very thoughts and your minds Lord if you want me to get off this topic Lord and provide the very thoughts God lord for I believe Lord you dwell in US Lord God lord and we are your temples God lord and Lord God we want to clean we want to keep clean temples Lord just real Sanctified and set aside for you Lord and for your kingdom Lord that we could win souls Lord Lord even at this moment right here be edifying to your wife God lord to your to your bride here God lord and Lord we certainly love and appreciate Lord God and Lord I want as you loved us God lord we want our love to grow towards you more Lord God and more Lord Lord give each one Lord a double portion th Holy Ghost Lord be with us this morning Lord as we do our best Lord to yield to you Lord God in your spirit we love you bless the people God In The Name of Jesus Christ amen you may be seated by God's grace well it's good to be back and um know the weird the strange thing of course is as soon as brother Jesse and brother cam uh ordained me into the ministry I've got two invitations I was gone two weeks ago to the Amish Church there in nvar and then I was then the week after that I was at Amish Church in or exus we say like the the Christian the new Christian Church in new uh Junction City and then here I am this week and then I get a break and then I go back to the church in Navar there uh so the Lord has put me in service uh and the beautiful thing it's all a small assembly so just tiny groups where I don't feel uncomfortable or however uh so we want to get into this thought here and uh I'll tell you what those uh the brothers there and both those uh assemblies in Nar and Junction City are wonderful Saints and I'm trying to bring whatever I get invitation the thoughts the I see what my the assembly I'm a part of at my home Church there the things we battle I try to encourage them and get them to watch out for these things so it doesn't take place in their assembly you know to warn as the the spirit of God always wants to warn then that's before judgment God always warns the people so we want to bring forth as far as a thought to them a way of seeing thing a different angle to uh give them to be aware that the devil is a roaring lion and he comes out to to kill kill uh kill steal and destroy the assembly he as my pastor one time did a study on sheep he says he know you the first indication of a sick sheep is uh uh the Sheep will separate itself from the assembly so that's what we want is we want to keep the people all together closer and closer drawing one with another so uh this morning I'd like to teach on by God's grace uh I want to speak on maybe the real war and with a subtopic of the Unseen um now getting back to the scripture notice here as we see he says the Bible in said in verse 12 he says for we wrestle not against flesh and blood so as we are Christians and we become Christians and we are standing as Christians the very Wars that we go through are not not between you and your brother you and your sister or anything like that though a friction may appear though though a disagreement or however whatever would take place before in the in the assembly between two individuals or three individuals or five individuals or if there's an uprising against the pastor or an uprising against the member of the assembly or however saints of God we do not wrestle against flesh and blood but the Bible declares here that it's against rulers of the darkness against Powers against principalities against Spirit sh wickedness in high places in other words what we see here in the natural is not the realest thing the greatest battle we have right now is in the spiritual realm oh Lord God if we could just Lord ask you this morning if you could open our eyes to a spiritual realm and see what is battling us what is fighting Us in this realm right in this room right now because there's two forces two Spirits Among Us right now and that is the Lord Jesus Christ the only true and living God and of course we have Satan his lowly de demons sure absolutely so those are the things that we battle those are the things that are affecting us right now I'll say like this many times when I was in Lima I'd get so tired in church that I would start falling asleep and as soon as uh our pastor there brother Brooks would say something he just say in such a way and it felt that that heaviness that tiredness would be lifted off and I'd be wide awake from there on so it shows me right there that was a tired Spirit a weary Spirit trying to get on me try to close my eyes take my mind off the scripture and get my mind to wander and shut down my flesh oh my so so so Spirits have power uh those those sort of things have a certain anointing to them as well and of course you know all those things by God's grace um uh so that is what we're fighting everything we see in the natural what is the Ukraine and Russia War those are two Spirits fighting right there is it the spirit of God and this one it could be two demons fighting right there because the Bible says what Satan's kingdom is divided sure there's no strength to it whatsoever he was already been conquered so they are already a weak people they're already weak uhh entities right there weak uh weaken their power according to the power of Christ sure and now we see Israel and now Hamas and Iran and all those sort of things what is what there's spirits that are doing those things right and of course God is in full control of it all amen sure we see something evil take place we know that's not the hand of God but God may have asked a spirit to come down and deceive or do this or do that why because God's word cannot come back void and it must everything must take place at a certain time at a specific people at a specific area as well so we know that God is in full control one thing for certain I was talking with a brother and he was uh bashing and and and of course it's easy to do our lovely present there if that's what you want to call him he's our president and he is our President Joe Biden right but now I said to the brother he he was kind of downplaying him which I which is it's not easy to it's yeah it's automatic so that's wow uh when you see Insanity what do you what do you do when you see someone do something completely and act a certain way you're speechless you're just you're left without words just in all of the thing I tell just as John saw the great of Revelation he says and he was astonished at this woman my what do what do you say right so as he was talking I said well God allowed Joe Biden to get in presence as a judgment to this people oh my and look what he brought in the White House all these crazy and insane kind of things of transgender colored hair just people who are completely out of their mind saints of God it's gone it's too far gone man it'll never come back right now as we get into these things I want to read a quote here now notice he says Christians the whole armor of Christianity is Faith right you've got to believe in everything that was ordained for you as an offens weapon and defensive weapon everything that was given to you you must have faith that that it was given to you for the thing he says he says everything that we have seen everything that we have is unseen everything he mentioned in that armor is unseen every everything you say oh I love this person or I love this person I love my mom I where is that love at give me a glass of that love because I'm a little low this morning I'd like to have a cup of what you have but you cannot produce it because it's in the Unseen right there a spiritual thing even felo love is in the spirit realm right it's affections sure uh and but then of course we know the agape love is the spirit of God and that's also in the Unseen he says everything that we have is unseen the only things that is real is unseen unexplained he says the things that can be explained are not real everything we see right now is less real is not even I'll say this more is it not even close to what is the Unseen right as I drive down the highways and I don't know why this affects me so much but every time I see a dead animal whether it's a squirrel whether it's a chipmunk or a deer or whatever I say Lord God have mercy I do not like to see death I don't like to see it I don't like to see it on the road just laying there and people and then I my heart goes out for those perished animals but I really believe that God is in full control and he loses nothing the very mind that spoke that deer and that squirrel or that into existence knows exactly where the spirit of that animal is right now today amen there is nothing lost that can be lost absolutely he says now notice he says he says they are explained are not real they are superficial and die but the things that cannot be explained are Immortal in the whole real amen and Saints of god that's literally and I say it like this this is the power of what God gave us what was one of the things that he gave us that is in the Unseen it is our very words that we speak out are in the Unseen you you hear I am opening my mouth and whatever is projecting out of this mouth is words or language but we cannot see this language or words being projected and enter into your ears you can't see any of it so it's in the spiritual realm that what the voice and the words and and noise travels in the Unseen but in the Unseen these things can take great effect to you these things can change lives and save souls or they can bring condemnation or lost souls sure by what the very unseen words of the power the Bible says the power of the mouth of life and death is in the mouth sure then that's all in the Unseen that power of the mouth he says what is in the Unseen and it carries life or it carries death sure he says but the things that can be not explained or Immortal in the whole realm he says look at the armor of Christianity love what part of you is love joy uh Faith longsuffering meekness patience all these things are unseen you can literally walk up to someone on a job site cuz that's where I work on a job site and you can come to a certain man in within 10 seconds you can tell if this man is impatient if he's got a temper or if he's just relax and chill why because out of the abundance of the the the heart the mouth speaketh sure brother Bram said he says you can know a person in two minutes just what comes out of their mouth he said that about someone who has the Holy Ghost you can tell and he said in two or five minutes however he said you could tell if he's got the holy ghost or not just by judging in the Unseen realm the things that he that that the couldn't even uh uh uh literally physically see but he could pick up the spirit of the words he could literally pick up what was speaking back to him amen sure he says not none of these things you can't see them they're unseen he says yet we believe them SS sints of God everything we believe are the very religion that God has sent us is unseen yes we have not even seen our savior in the flesh we haven't even seen the prophet of Malachi 4 In the Flesh all we have is a is a picture of it just like a the I saw this my my lovely Kent hovind he'd go up in his little places and he' say and he show a picture of on the screen of his wife he says this is not my wife this is just a picture of her right sure so we have pictures of the prophet he say he say but that's that's just a picture of him that's not him sure so everything we have we take we are we are literally in the in the era of the greatest Faith right here we're going to need that great faith for this Rapture right sure for this body change absolutely he says he says now he they unseen yet we believe them Love Never Dies faith is in is the victory we believe these things that we don't see so all the powers everything that that that that destinat or or predestines our end whether we go up or whether we go down or the very things that we go through is all in the Unseen the path that we live is in the Unseen the the things that we encounter the things that we fight are in the unseen realm sure and they're in another dimension sure now let's see here as I was sharing there with uh um the Saints in Junction City he says he says in Romans 10 verse1 17 so then Faith cometh by hearing so notice Faith which the Bible says we we go jump right here now what is Faith he says faith is a substance of things hoped for and the evidence of Things Not Seen so this faith is unseen it's in another Dimension it's another realm he says but he said the way you get this un dimens this unseen substance he says is by hearing the word of God now we have to continually hear the word of God because notice what it says so then Faith cometh it never said it comes right then the very second you hear your first sermon do you get Faith uhh for healing not necessarily the first time you hear the baptism of the name of Jesus Christ you receive the faith for the Holy Ghost not necessarily he says but what says the faith cometh by hearing and hearing by the word of God this all takes place in another dimension this all takes place in another realm the invisible and yet that invisible realm is able to what affect us our flesh and our spirit absolutely it affects the entire being of the person absolutely what because why God made it in such a way that it would deceive the very elected oh my it could deceive the Lost absolutely this has to be this remember this whole story is not even it is for Christ but it's also for his bride the whole intention of the whole thing is what we see the very we see the first Adam struggle with the what with with with what the invisible God was struggling before he became God right and that was what he said then he became lonely before he was God he was all he was all by himself dwelling his attributes and he was lonely he wanted someone to spend eternity with he wanted someone right here that would love him and he loved her amen and that would be what the bride of Christ amen the entire thing is for his wife that's the entire we know that now let's continue on here I got a long ways uh by God's grace maybe maybe not now I want to start this here uh the invisible realm and saints of God I hope by the end of this that you were encouraged because a lot of us had no idea what we were caught into and the power of what was done to us in religious Realms so let's look here by God's grace um I always love this quote this really explains so many things by God's grace he says now so Baum got Israel to commit fornication do you know that the physical fornication is the very same spirit that lies in organized religion so notice he goes he goes physical fornication other words two people coming together to have the wrong act right he says this joining together this joining together he says the exact same he says Spirit that's an organized religion so what is fornication is without a marriage vow right it's an Act without a marriage vow without marriage ceremony without a real uh for for someone that you you you dedicate you you you you you give your whole life to that other person right so this is just for pleasure we say like that he says in the very same spirit that lays an organized religion now notice organized religion what is that organized religion is someone who Jesus Christ is not the head of the church oh my they rejected the husband now and they are running around and doing all these sort of things he said I said the spirit of fornication is the spirit of organization so notice now what does this take place here how he say he say all fornications will have their place in the Lake of Fire this is what God thinks of organization yes sir the and her daughters will be in the Lake of Fire but now think about this this is a physical act but it means something in the spiritual realm this physical act right here is a I like the in the physical that's the physical that's the type of what takes place in the spiritual in the ecclesiastical realm yes and there's a joining there there's something that takes place there denominations are not of God they never have been and never will be it's the wrong spirit so notice the very wrong The Same Spirit that causes a unmarried woman and unmarried man to commit acts there is the exact same spirit that takes place as what we see in the Baptist and the assembly to God in in the Catholic church and all those sort of things that's the exact same spirit because remember the spirits were here before this thing this thing was even in motion they were up up in heaven worshiping God right and then they were deceived by Satan and then we know from there but that same Spirit those Spirits were separated themselves from Christ because the prophet said he says he said Satan set up his kingdom on the North Side of Heaven A separation he says denomination not God he has never even been never will be it's a wrong spirit that separates the people of God into hierarchy and leoty and it's therefore a wrong spirit that separates the people from the people right he says he says that's what organization and denominations do it's organizing they separate themselves from the word of God and bring themselves into spiritual adultery so we could literally I say this in the Physical Realm a young man and a young girl could keep themselves pure from all in uh from all all all filth and and those sort of things right but if they join up then with the false church and they move into that sort of Realm they're doing the exact same thing to God and yet can yet they have sincere Hearts sincere motives they're trying to do God a service without it being in his word we'll say it like that right and come a lot of times I'll say this I was in the same boat in that exact same thing we do it to with ignorance we were brought up under a certain religion we're brought up in a certain Church were brought up in to do religion in a certain kind of way and what God God then got he lets and I like this I was just as filthy as I could be I almost when I was in the world as as was in the Assemblies of God it was bad it's it was completely embarrassed I really repent so now um in this same thought I want you to look at the scripture here in 1 Corinthians 6:15 he says know ye not that your bodies are the members of Christ shall I then to take the members he say of Christ and make them the members of a harlot he says God forbid now he's talking spiritual or or even natural but we can also apply this in the spiritual right he says what know ye not that he which is joined to a harlot is one body so now notice something when when when in the natural if when somebody goes out to the bars or the dance clubs and a man sees a woman and this and this and things take place they actually join it's a spiritual joining together they actually not only they come together in the flesh but they also it's a spiritual joining and the Bible declares they become one flesh whether they know it or not there something in the spiritual takes place right there he says should we do that and he says God forbid what know you not that he which is joined to a harlot is one body for two saith he shall be one flesh so L when they come to do that same Paul is actually connecting this to a marriage act because he's going right back to uh uh literally what what uh um uh the first Adam said or Adam said he says he says man and woman come together and they must uh become one flesh bone of my bone and Flesh of My Flesh he says and then leave the father and mother so he's literally bringing this back he says he says but they're performing the exact same act it's a Marriage Act he's bringing this to a marriage a spiritual marriage he says and but uh uh uh but it's but now notice he says but he that is joined under the spirit unto the Lord is one Spirit he says flee fornication every every sin that man goeth is without the body but he that committeth fornication sinth against his own body uh he says what what you uh know ye not that your body is the Temple of the Holy Ghost which is in you which ye have of God and ye are not your own amen so here how many was bought with the price how many recognized the blood of Jesus Christ on that day on the day of Cal y hanging from the cross that was our sacrifice and by that spirit that left him that came back on his church we are joined with him in one spirit and one body amen and that is the what the mystical body of Jesus Christ amen and we are the bride of Christ by faith amen amen because what we can't prove it can where's my where's my where's my little plaque that says I am the bride of Christ I don't have one but I'm taking it by faith amen because I've seen what he's called me to and I de see the word that he's delivering to me and that I'm eating and I believe this is fresh Mana amen this is something that God has ordained that that that no one else can take from me what what it saying in the in the third seal he says touch not the oil and the wine the devil has no he cannot take anything from you he can't take Revelation from you and SS of God that's a mystery of why others are falling away in this hour from the message yes Hallelujah take not touch not the oil and wine did they really have the wine did they really drink that wine down and and really live effect and give them stipulation oh my right hallelujah or did they actually have the wine but they failed to have the oil as well which the oil is the keeper the oil is the keeper for 20 years you can go preach this gospel but if the Holy Ghost keeper if the one that the Bible says God knoweth and he has the seal he knows those that are his amen and that that right there right there is the keeper he is the one that's holding us in his hand absolutely as Christ held the Seven Stars in his right hand he also is more than if he could keep that Seven Stars how much more his bride amen how much more the ones that he loved not his servants in his right hand but his very the apple of his heart the apple of his eye the bride of Christ amen absolutely he will keep us amen he said he would he would never leave nor forsake you amen absolutely praise God he is able and I'm trusting in Him we're play putting all our faith and trusting in his word that he is faithful to finish this work amen as he started a work in your life this morning absolutely look back one year ago look back 5 years ago look back 20 years ago and tell me tell me if God has not changed your life if he's not brought you to a higher place if he's not what done Miracles and signs and all those things and not only that but he shared what the Mysteries the mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven are given to you and that is only for the bride it's not for the m multitudes it is for his people the mysteries of God Amen what is the what did the prophet say the evidence of the Holy Ghost was it wasn't Divine love he says he said it was receiving the revealed word for your hour brother bradam was 60 years ago what about this hour amen we should be growing and brother said he says in this generation he said I hope you're catching it he said I hope you're catching the things that I'm bringing forth he says but if there comes another generation he says no doubt he there'll be higher than this one Amen in what Revelation and spiritual understanding absolutely why because we're getting closer to the Head amen we're getting closer to our husband amen sure as I shared in uh and I'll say it like this why do denominations have such a problem when I was in a denomination they never taught from the Old Testament hardly ever proess how much how much Old Testament did you hear outside of David killing Goliath and knowing the do you know why they can't preach the Old Testament do you know why why because the Old Testament is Shadow and type to have a shadow you must have an image but if you have the wrong image or the right or the wrong right thing when you bring the wrong thing if you bring a threers down it's not going to line up with the scripture in the Old Testament if you bring a false baptism down it's not going to line up if you bring the false god of false religion it'll never fit the shadow at all so they have no ability to understand the Old Testament the shadows and types when I was in Thailand a couple times ago I taught on Joseph the perfect type of Christ and they were blown away because they had never seen it why because they have the wrong interpretation of the New Testament you take the right New Testament you the revelation of the New Testament you bring it down to the Shadow and it's going to fit perfectly it's not going to be distorted all the details will be in the exact same and you'll be able to place this place that place that and it's under the amen sure do you see what we're seeing here by God's grace now dealing with uh adultery spiritually fornication spiritually we want to look in now how how would this take place now notice he says he that which is joined to a harlot how did this man how did this person be joined to a harlot what had to take place right here he says shall I take the members of Christ and make the members of Harlot how would someone do that anyhow how is it possible that they could take the members of Christ and bring them to a hearted it's through how she speaks it's through the very words that Usher out of the harlot's mouth now notice my son attend unto my wisdom and bow thine ear to thy understanding now notice here Solomon says he listen to what I'm saying he says that thou regardest that mayest discard regard discretion and that thy lips may keep knowledge he says keep these things right here right for what because this is our battle this is our sword of the spirit comes right out of our lips right he says for the lips of a strange woman drop as honeycomb remember when uh Jonathan was out in the field he's everybody's weary tired he saw honey drop from the sky and he hit it with a stick and put his mouth he says he says it was enlightening honey yes it was stimulation to him it gave him strength some kind of a meat from the honey right from the bees and now here this that Harlot woman will have something he is as a honeycomb it's not real honeycomb but it's as a honeycomb it be something that will be so tasty so good he says and her mouth is smoother than the Holy Ghost how can how can the mouth of a harlot or the words of a harlot be smoother than the Holy Ghost but the holy the Holy Ghost is rigid the Holy Ghost says you've got to stay with my word but what's smoother than honey oh you can do whatever you want you can do oh it's okay they didn't really mean that or or this scripture really doesn't mean that that's smoother than the Holy Ghost when the Holy Ghost stands here right here and says if you mess that up life and death stands right here if you cross this line you're going to the wrong territory I'll say like this would we be able if God would permit it which he will not but if he would ever permit this that he would come down in the flesh and pastor church one more time would you be able to handle Jesus as your pastor right right let me play my part Jesus would say I'm gonna suffer and die and I'll be like Lord You're Not Gonna Die that's not and he says Get Behind Me Satan whoa and all all the 11 disciples are like H who's controlling who's controlling Simon wonder what Spirits in Simon could you handle Jesus as your pastor he says but her end is bitter as warmwood sharp as a two-edged sword he says sharp as a two-edged sword just as cutting her feet go down to death her steps take hold on her hell lest thou should us Ponder the the path of Life her ways are movable in other words she'll take you off the path this way path this way what God said he says the the the the gate is straight and narrow which leadth unto eternal life but she will what take you off the path he says her ways are movable that thou sh that thou canest not know them hear me now therefore oh my children depart not from the words of my mouth what are the words of mouth of his mouth right here we have to stick with the scripture stick with the Bible now notice right here another thing Solomon actually according to what he says he literally eyewitnessed this the Bible says he was looking out of the casement of his house there out of casement of his where he was standing and he saw this young man he says void of understanding void of discretion had no re he was simple he just was just walking around and and this woman takes the Bible says and he caught him and kissed him with an imputed M mouth or however you want to say it and now notice when she's speaking to him come let us let us take our fill of Love unto the morning let us Solace ourselves with loves for the good man is not home he has gone along Journey he says he had taken a bad bag of money with him and will come home at the day appointed but with her Fair much fair speech I remember a battle years ago I was going against Pastor versus me versus pastor and people were watching and I said brother and I was speaking to the pastor I said we've got to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and the pastor says well God knows my heart do you really think it really matters if it's Father's holy ghost or Lord Jesus Christ and I said yes but to those that are hearing they heard his reasoning and it was smoother than the very spirit that was speaking out of me staying stick with the word of God it's pleasing itching ears things that oh that's that's right I mean does it really matter there's reason it away right and with her much fair speech she caused him to yield what stop for a moment stop for a second and with flattering of her lips she forced him once he caused once he yielded she had him once he stopped for one second she literally grabbed them by the arm and there they went now I want to go to where I'm going here by God's grace in Revelation 171 we know who the mother of harlots is and this is more of a Protestant little study here by God's grace but there's a certain section I thought was absolutely phenomenal he says here come one of the Seven Angels which had the seven vials he says and talked with me saying comeing come up hi come hither you have to come up hither he's already there he says come hither and I'll show the the Judgment of the great which sits upon many Waters with whom the kings of the Earth have committed fornication no notice the same spirit that Paul is addressing there The Same Spirit of that is what the spirit of organization which have committed what spiritual organization or fornication and the inhabitants of the Earth have been made drunk with the wine of her fornication with her organization what did she do she organized everything when Lord when the Lord LED Martin Luther out what did she do she infiltrated and organized when Wes come out he they infiltrated and organized and now there's thousands and thousands and thousands of churches that are under the head of the Catholic church and they don't even know it he says he carried me away in the spirit in the wilderness and I saw a woman sit with seven with with a Scarlet colored Beast full of names of blasphemy having seven heads and 10 horns and the woman was arrayed in purple and scarlet color and decked with gold and precious stones and Pearls now notice having a golden cup in her hand full of Abominations and filthiness of fornication right and have committed fornication with her with the wine of her fornication what was her wine Abominations and filthiness anything that's that God hates they were for it anything that was against the scripture of God they were for and they performed it he says and upon her forehead was a name written mystery Babylon the great the mother of harlots and Abominations of the earth so now notice in Revelations 19 6 so the angel shows John the bapt or John the Revelator St John and shows him the great and then here in Revelations 19:7 at the right at the coming of Christ with the bride to take over in verse 7 he says let us be glad and rejoice and give honor to him for the marriage of the Lamb is come and his wife hath made herself ready so the eagle Prophet took John showed him the great and then just two chapters afterwards we find out that J the eagle is showing the prophet or sorry or John he says shows him the coming of the Lord the marriage of the Lamb I just like this brother I just talked with brother Brooks and in one of his dreams when he was very young that he was he had made the Rapture and he was playing the tambourine going into heaven he says and when he got to the gates there he was playing the tambourine he says and he saw Jesus he said in in his in his mind the thought entered he's not going to let me in and he started to step back and as he stepped back he says Jesus moved quicker and grabbed him and picked him him up like a man with a woman and kissed him and I said and I'll speak one today about and he was rehearsing that story to me that that Vision he had or that dream and I said brother Brooks you know the kiss is right before the wedding supper and he's like brother that's right I said brother even though we're the wife we're technically not married yet he has to come and get her perform everything we do in a marriage ceremony must be performed exactly so there's a vows that takes place which is what he planting he gives us what the token which is the Holy Ghost and then when he comes for her he picks her up kisses her as the man would kiss his bride lifting the veil reveals her who she is then then he takes her to the wedding supper then for the honeymoon is the Thousand-Year Millennium Reign Hallelujah I said that's exactly right he's like yeah but that's that's good he says but notice he says and his wife hath made her s ready now the question I read this and I said why is this placed here why is the wife hath made herself ready in Revelations 19 and not in Revelations 3 why is it not why is this here alls I know is that whatever was said to her before had to have alerted her to what she must do and what was the last last thing she heard from Heaven what was the last thing she heard from Heaven before this it it's right here in Revelations 18 verse one and after these things I saw another Angel come down from heaven having great power and the Earth was lightened with his glory and he cried mighy with a strong voice saying to Babylon the great is H is Fallen has fallen has become the habitation of devils and the hold of every foul uh spirit and the cage of every unclean and hateful bird All Nations have drunk from the wine of the wrath of her fornication and the kings of the Earth have committed fornication with her and the merchants of the Earth are waxed Rich through the abundance of her Delicacies who's the who's the Mercers who's the Mercers of the earth Bill Gates all these big owners the big companies who's making the big money the real merchants of the Earth the ones causing inflation the ones selling they're upping the price so much higher than than they are now notice they've all committed fornication other words they've all organized into an into an organization what is that the image directed to the Beast they have to come into this what and it'll they'll take the mark by and it's what a one world church and then if you go into that one World Church you have literally done these things but what was the ver what was the voice to the bride and I heard another voice from Heaven saying come out of her my people my people my wife my bride he says come out over my people that be not partakers of her sins and that you receive not of her plagues this is what we have have to do this is what we must do get away from every Catholic Doctrine every Catholic tradition all those sort of things must go anything that's anti- word or against the word not found in the word of God must go right that's how the bride makes herself ready now notice what the prophet of God said here he says all the things which are dainty good all departed from thee and thou shalt find them the more this is exactly organized Church the last day for it says in verse four come out people he says notice remember what's taking place here everything in the Book of Revelation is taking place in chronological order but John is being handw walked by that angel through time he's literally taking a 2,000 year walk with the angel who was commissioned by Jesus to bring him and reveal these things and as we see these things he says he says come out of my people the Rapture has not yet taken place the bride is not gone when these terrible conditions of the rich false Church exist so we're here that's why now notice Harvest Time yes Harvest Time the two vines that grew together entwined their branches are now to be separated the fruits of those Vines which were at such variance will be gathered into separate Garners the two spirits will go into separate destinations he says now is it time to heed the final call that comes only to the wheat bride amen well brother I've I've witnessed to so many people brother Jesse how many how many postcards have you sent out in this this town thousands and thousands but this call to come out is only for the wheat bride and comes only to the wheat Bride come out over my people my partakers of sins and that ye the wheat receive not her Terror plagues Great Tribulation of six se old Matthew 24 how come we can hear this call how come we can hear this how do we receive this and it comes down to this as I I was looking into this I saw a couple quotes and just blew up in my face and I saw the power of what we're dealing with here and that's why the Bible says to come with all longsuffering the Bible says love conquer all and I hope by the end of this you'll see that if a man can get so in a spot to where he's anointed of God to to speak to a lost or Fallen brother or lost or Fallen sister that God can actually break that thing now look here what was revealed in Revelation 13 the two beasts one out of the water one out of the sand one of the land now notice he says I saw one of the heads that weread wounded in the death and the deadly wound was healed and all the world wondered at the Beast now notice that we know this took place in the time of Constantine when it from went from religious or or or or or military might to Papa might he says and and now notice there was given to him a mouth speaking great BL things to blasphemies he say and he opened his mouth and blasphemy and blasphemy against God number one number two to blaspheme his name number three and his Tabernacle he says and them that dwell in Earth there's four blasphemies like four horse riders interesting now four four insects right I'm sure many of you know what these are but we're going to rehearse them real quick he says and he opened his mouth as in blasphemy what's the first thing that would that defiled open his mouth just like a harlot like a woman trying to lure and deceive and pull away conquer he says teaching for com doctrines the Commandments of men hey high-m minded lovers of pleasure having a form of godliness and denying the power thereof that's the mouth of blasphemy now remember these are unseen powers here this is his way he's working through the Unseen the the dimensions the Realms then he says and he blasphemed the name of God changing the name to titles and refusing to do otherwise right here's the other two I found another in another sermon he says to blashe his name give him a title his Tabernacle which is the Holy Spirit dwelling place to take a place place in Rome a Vatican City you can just go down and blashe blashe by saying that they were intercessors these four things these four things were the power that was given to to them or to him to deceive the world with these Powers notice these are spoken powers and there was given him a mouse speaking great things and blasphemies and power was given unto him to continue 42 months you know that's the tribulation there now let's continue on now notice the Antichrist Spirit was already working in the New Testament Church it already come down to a place where St Paul had visited the Galatians or when he was writing a letter to the Galatians and he'd come inspected he heard things he saw whatever whatever he says and in his Ser in his his letter he says oh foolish galations who hath bewish you that you should not obey the truth he literally called it witchcraft because the early church was given Grace there was nothing given to the Gentiles there's no there was no Feast we had to do no no uh other the only thing it's given to is what feet washing baptism and communion to add to this is witchcraft yes sir he called it to be witch witchcraft it is satanic it is in the spiritual realm now and yet in that church and write a branch off of the book of Acts and we find now something at taken place people had now notice what did they do did they do on purpose they probably did on purpose the Jews were doing these things trying to bring them right but they were under the wrong spirit and when you're under the wrong Spirit you'll bring forth the wrong word and therefore be anti- word if you're anti- word you're Antichrist and if you're Antichrist then you're you're lost you're done and the Antichrist word the Antichrist Spirit what is witchcraft yes sir now notice he says the what's that witchcraft uh mean by false representations to be witch I'm going to go into something real simple but it's so powerful how many people we witnessed to hundreds and hundreds and hundreds trying to wind them in and a brother just text me the other day said brother Sai he goes should I lead with the prophet when I'm witnessing or should I lead with the scripture I said well brother I've I I that's been a battle the whole time I just kind of lead with the scripture with Jesus and this and that and however and just try and win him to the word of God because the word if I can get him to the word of God they'll have a foundation if I can get him to the word of God they'll get the promise of the Holy Ghost would we lead him to a veil the prophet Veil I'll say this God can do anything many people have heard uh uh those sort of things just like uh MAA said I'll give you Malachi 4 but she was already a Christian but when she prayed for for brother Brandon the spirit said I'll give you him right hey go hey God and every person's built differently every person has a different kind of hunger I like medium rare steaks others like medium what others like medium rare steaks with with with a Pittsburgh touch to it where they free fry the outside burn it others like this other like that everybody has their own kind of taste God knows what is what your soul hungers and he knows the way that's going to catch you every fish is not going to bite the same kind of bait amen every fish want some fish are hungry at other times other fish aren't oh my sure now I want you to show I want you to see the power of this look here oh brother side that's really really simple yeah this right here has more power than we even maybe understand something takes place right here remember this is the lion Throne guard the lion Zoom the zoom on the East Gate is guarding the way into the East Gate that was what was on be on the throne of Heaven up there when John saw it these four beasts guarding the gate this was the East Gate guarding this is a guard you can't get past this unless you catch Revelation now notice he says I love this he says I was in the spear isn't that wonderful my I love that you could just call those words the whole of the Christian Life we've got to be in the spirit every time we leave our houses every time we leave our cars and in our houses and in our cars we must be in the spirit live there how many want to live in the spirit of God absolutely we want to walk in the light as he is in the light amen walking with him as the prophet God got lost up in the mountains or or directly after he called that storm out and the he's heard he's heard the Holy Ghost say come walk with me brother I would love to and they walked by what after the third poll took place now notice he says uh he says I will pray in the spirit he says I will sing in the spirit I'll live in the spirit if there's anything good that will come to me and has to be revealed by the spirit there's no way other way I can't teach it no one can preach it it has to be revealed by the spirit but in order to get the Revelation you've got to get in the spirit he says and then it has to be revealed by the spirit confirmed by the word because we have to make sure it's the right Spirit revealing it amen he says he says and made manifest by the results it Bears now notice what he says after this look at it this way all too many people read the Bible where it says in Acts 238 repent be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for remission of sins and you shall receive the gift of hly ghost and they just pass right on they don't see it why don't they see it if they saw it by getting in the spirit does anyone remember that time when the baptism was revealed to them little did you know you were in the spirit at that time there had to be such a hunger for the word the truth that even though I was baptized twice wrong way one as a Catholic sprinkled baby and then as a Pentecostal father's Holy Ghost baptism when I saw that truth I was hungering I must have been in the spirit amen and when you were baptized in the name of Jesus Christ and this was revealed to you you were in the spirit and you didn't even know it well brother he was just doing a Bible study or somebody just witnessed this to me and they won me and I said I've getting baptized you were in the spirit when that was real real to you Hallelujah they would know that if they wanted to receive the Holy Spirit they would need to repent be baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and then God would be Duty bound to fulfill his word by filling them with the Holy Ghost this they never got in his spirit or it would happen to them exactly as the word said right so if they not if they didn't get in the spirit of Christ What Spirit were they under yes sir there's only two yes sir pray to God for a revelation by his spirit that is the first step getting in the spirit now I want to I want to show you these things right here baptism of holy go Holy Spirit he says now in Galatians 1 18 Paul said if an angel from heaven comes down bright shining Angel what is he speaking of a revelation in other words this false if a Man reveals something else or or even Paul himself come and reveal something to him gives you Revelation if it's not if it doesn't line up with the original it's false right he said what's he speaking of a revelation blessed be the name of the Lord it doesn't matter how good your Revelation is it has to come what back to yourm right we know those things he says falsely he says find me one place where anybody was ever baptized in the name of father and Holy Ghost it's not written in the sacred writings what is it it's a Dogma that started with the Catholic church right I know this is Basics but I'm telling you there's some this is why this is why we're not winning as many Souls as we need because remember we're not Waring against this brother or sister in denomination we're trying to they are held by something yes something has caught them and there they brought forth false water baptism to sprinkling in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ the Father the Holy Ghost Jesus said under the inspiration he gave to John he says you have a name that you're living but you're dead father son Holy Ghost is a dying name that's right when you are baptized I'll say this because that's not really baptized that's a false baptism yes when Peter was dealing with the 12 disciples in Ephesus or passing through the upper Coast he said not didn't do not he says he says You must be baptized re-baptized did he say re-baptized no he said you must be baptized John's baptism wasn't even the real baptism he did not say re-baptized he says You must be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ there's only one baptism everything else is false outdated or obsolete well let's go walk to the Red Sea that's obsolete by about 4,000 years right now he says it's a dying name that's why we see no victory in our loved ones that our religious ones let me tell you a little personal experience Switzerland Germany and the places that I've been how does the fortune teller's Works how does evil spirits travel think on this let this soak in how do evil spirits travel remember they the evil spirits can't travel with the true word of God because how can be two be together and be uh unagreed how can two be how's how it go uh how could be two be joined I can't walk together and disagree right thank you brother he says how does evil travel evil spirits travel I want you to believe want you to believe me as your pastor CU you're the one I'm speaking to Devil's travel in the name of the father son Holy Ghost when I was sprinkled as a baby demons started guiding my life Pastor Jesse we've been at a couple of our cousins weddings and what did the pastors marry them in the name in in the name of the father son and they they they they spoke this in their marriage vows and my wife literally was speak we were speaking this on the way here and she goes she goes Z why do you think America has so many divorces because literally when that Pastor that denominational Pastor marries two individuals and says I marry you in the name of the father son Holy Ghost demons are transferred individ indiv invisibly through those words and it takes effect and it's what through a Devils travel in the name of the father Holy Ghost they cut feathers and everything else and they throw them spells on each other through the name of the father ghost it call it call it the three High names this is what we're battling why can't they see the Lord Jesus Christ because they're consumed by religious Devils blinding their eyes I was I feel like I was led to a certain brother one time I met him in a shoe Sho store and he got me involved this in this business but I was only joined that business to witness to them and Beth is my witness after every one of those business meetings I witnessed to him baptism it took three months every Sunday night for two hours after this we we' get home at one o'clock in the morning every Sunday for like three months it took three months for them even for one to see the baptism name of Jesus Christ and for three months all like did was go over baptism again and again and again and again for three months we didn't talk about predestination we didn't talk about the mother harlots we didn't talk about anything else I hit baptism for three months it took three months for even one to get baptized for him to even see it and you know what he did after that after I B he actually wanted me to baptize him baptize in the name of Jesus Christ and then he went to his old pastor and because now we're moving on to godhead I'm like he went behind back and says hey I'm I'm going to go he came me and him met in a parking lot every time we' get done with our meetings we meet in the parking lot afterwards and during the week we s in the parking lot talking to us and then we head out right one day he showed up in the we I I was sitting in his car he's like all right s man I got I got I got something to tell you I go what he goes I had a meeting with my pastor I'm like and I labored labored for four months on these two individuals and one of them one of them got baptized and he says I he go go I I think I'm going to stick with Trinity I just went my pastor I'm like you talk to them and he's like yeah he goes I recorded it you want to listen I said absolutely and he starts playing the conversation between him and his pastor and the pastor says oh no that's that's Lord Jesus Christ is invalid it's not and I said that's a lie that's a lie that's a lie come on come on sir you know that's a lie you that's a lie he's said well s I'm just I'm just gonna stay where I'm at and I was so hurt I I accepted the the defeat I was like fine pretty good that's fine all right well as you feel lad and this and this then he goes but I had a dream I said and then just kind of bring me relief I said tell me your dream tell me your Dream It's Over anyhow right what does it matter I said tell me your dream he goes Simon he goes I was in a parking lot and as soon as he said parking lot I said this has to do with us I go he goes when I was in that parking lot I saw Jesus over in the distance he said his body was perfect like I would think he says but his face his head was all messed up his teeth were shooting this way and that way and his his eyes were disfigured and he was all messed up he said and I started walking to Jesus he says and as I walked to Christ he like double duty to me like he said before I knew it he say he was right there in my face like this he said and he was boss he just called a boss you see the face of Cris it's seriously look looking right at the Creator he said but when he when that when Jesus got right to his face he said his head was perfectly perfectly perfect he go s do you know what that means I said absolutely I know what that means I said if you would draw closer to Jesus he will reveal the godhead see right now the godheads is all messed up I said but said I said but if you draw closer to him he said he said the godhead will become clear to you and when I said that the holy ghost in the car dropped on him and he started go like this and for five minutes the Holy Ghost took over his body and he couldn't move and His Hands start going like this and all he could do was move his eyes to mean I'm just like get him Lord get him and after about five minutes it started coming off and he's like and he comes three he's like s what was that I said that I said I'll just say his name I said Eric you wouldn't believe his servant you wouldn't believe what I was trying to teach you for four months I said so God had to come down and prove to you literally when I spoke that the Holy Ghost showed up and proved that it was right I said now you have to make a choice guess what now he believes Oneness but then he hasn't come back since Devils travel in the name of the father and Holy Ghost they blind the people what do those demons do what those Devils do they come in the person when they get baptized in the name of the father ghost those demons now are attached to him through through them through them and they start the reasoning process because remember they can't do much to the flesh but in the where did Eve fall in the in the spirit realm in the mind realm reasoning affections uh all those sort of things right there in Switzerland he says I stood by the hands of the post like that where the honest men and women died where they cut their tongues and burnt their eyes and everything out hot rods that prostitute Catholic Church not only that but they early anglicans to church churches too he says and your Protestant churches did the same thing and they throw those spells by the father Son and Holy Ghost it literally looks like to me the what is the point of the Catholic Church they're to control the people remember they if they go off the word they that false word that hybrid word takes an effect on people it is a spiritual realm we're dealing with is a spiritual effect and if that in fact I I was at the Junction City and they showed me a a video uh brother Chad Lamb did on baptism and he showed and and I think it was brother Frank that was under brother Chad that found it but literally he found a video from 2016 where the pope literally said anyone that's got our baptism is ours why would he say that that's right if that baptism didn't have any power that's right if that baptism didn't connect to people in the spiritual realm it's a channel so here they are these are what F ghost is a spell when without the proper understanding look here he says how did I know there was a living God not until somebody a theology somebody's intellectual conception of some emotional period that passed through an age gone by as infidels would tell us but one day Down Yonder I found him and talked him face to face that made things different he said spiritualism Works through Father Son and Holy Ghost I stood in meeting where those witches was a working now he says spiritualism Works through that this is a gateway this right here this is a this is a baptism of death demons travel through this baptism what was the first two things the Catholic Church changed baptism and godhead and look at everything that flooded in and then now the prophet of God connects this baptism to spiritualism what's spiritualism here's the Apostles Creed everybody know that don't they have a song didn't thir day or something like Apostles Creed song or somebody I I believe in God the Father Almighty creator of heavens and the Earth Jesus Christ his only son our Lord uh our Lord who was born conceived by the Holy Ghost born of Virgin Mary suffered was under crucified and then gets all this stuff which is relatively right I believe in the Holy Spirit the Holy Catholic Church the communion of saints the Forgiveness of sins the resurrection of the body and the life of everlasting amen so through what' he say he says Spiritual Works through father son Holy Ghost now the Catholic Church believes the intercession or the communion of saints of dead people to go and die it's purely a spirit a form of spiritualism right right and the Protestant church right in their own homemade Apostles Creed so what do he say a lot of the Protestants have a adopted the Apostles Creed right and I'll say like this one of my old foremen he was at the time and he's not saved right now but at the time he was a free Baptist he says he opened his free Baptist Bible study his Bible they gave him from the free Baptist he says and in that was the Apostles Creed and he said the Holy Roman Catholic Church the Baptists had already adopted this in put it in their Bible the Holy Roman Catholic Church is in I believe in them the Baptist the free Baptist and the pro church right in her homemade Apostles Creed which is never something found in the Bible they say they believe in the Holy Roman Catholic church and they believe in the community of saints which blings brings P prism into spiritualism as well now they're connected but where was the start in father son Holy Ghost baptism what brother say about the Catholic church he says what's your uh opinion you're just a non-catholic aren't you he says no sir I'm a Protestant he said you don't protest he says I do protest not the people but the church's Doctrine see he says what's your opinion of the church I'm sorry you asked that he says go ahead say it I asked you he said what brother what the what did Malachi 4 say about the Revelation 1718 the highest form of spiritualism that I know of he said spiritualism yes sir I mean not the Church of Satan not witches and warlocks he said but the Catholic church is the highest form of speaking they have buil ions praying to dead people billions and sometimes they get oil out of their hands or foreheads out of statues and blood and all those sort of things it's it has a fact because why have power he says anything that intercedes with the dead is spiritualism all them women walk he says going down the street pulling the Rocks like things doing pent he says pent to a dead woman who her lover is killed and makes her a saint calls her canonized by the church he I said that's spiritualism so when we go out witnessing from here on remember how they were baptized you know how much more success I have witnessing on uh at the job site of people who are not religious and they're able to even see serpent seed I witnessed to a a religious man years ago and I said man you need to get re-baptized he says I'm already saved you're telling me what I've do what what's all this effect because he had God was cleaning him up he's likeyou telling me I got to re baptize I've already seen results and it rejected baptism right there and I moved on to a painter guy who was talking completely filth I started hitting with serice seed and he says I see it and I'm like here's a religious man that what he baptized father Holy Ghost and then once you reveal the truth behind it he can't receive it and I goes to complete Heathen and he's able to see receive one of the Mysteries of the Kingdom of Heaven did he continue on no but he saw it it was revealed to him he's like I see that unreal now what is spiritualism a a system of belief or religious practice based on supposed communion with the dead Saints or dead with the spirits of the Dead especially through mediums now in closing here my pastor's been uh brother Cam's been preaching on preparation for the New Testament Church ages and he's going through David's life and showing everything that must take place before the book of Acts in the Old Testament and as he was teaching this uh listen to another sermon and things start jumping if you look at King Saul King Saul was a type of denomination Minister brother said he was a high Mighty denominational man ecclesiastical vests and all those sort of things and the shields were doctrines and all those sort of things right all that he was completely denominational and we know that King Saul committed two great sins he he literally sacrificed when he should not done the sacrifice right the prophet Samuel was supposed to sacrifice and he did not wait long enough to sacrifice and Saul said I forced myself because of the people and then after that God continued to move through him it says he says now he say when I get you this King he says destroy all the AMCs destroy them all they went into battle and Saul said Saul said to Samuel I've done all I've kept every word every commandment Samuel's like what's the bleeding of the sheep I hear what's this mooing of the cows what are these other animals he says and what's this what's the king here you left alive what's he doing here and Samuel said he says the kingdom is rent from you it's over right now notice he says Thou Hast done foolishly thou has not kept the Commandment of the Lord thy God which he commanded thee for now would the Lord have established th Kingdom forever in Israel and now the kingdom shall not continue the Lord has saw a man after his own heart the Lord hath commanded him to be Captain over his people so at this point right here does everyone remember as soon as this point God now has to go and Hunt himself a man after his own heart and he finds David right and as soon as the prophet goes and takes the Horn of oil and anoints David the Bible says the spirit of the Lord was with David from that point on and we see the very next verse after that that an evil spirit was sent by God onto Saul so look at the connection right here now notice the denominational now has since passed their day of judgment or pass their day of Grace I'll say like that and then now the true anointing is on the true and now the denomination was catch a different kind of spirit now notice what takes place when he catches this evil spirit the spirit starts uh giving saw horrible times nightmares dreams however whatever you say something get him just in a bad attitude all the time and he has to find someone to bring those evil spirits off of him and we know the story how uh the a man said he said King Saul he said I've heard of a man the son of Jesse he says that will play before you with his hand on the harp and he said bring him and and and and David gets there and starts playing the harp maybe not singing maybe he was asked to sing and song sings a beautiful song but he doesn't like it where did I get that thought from and then he plays continue plays and the Bible said the evil spirit departs from him he said hey I want you with me always because he saw the spirit of God on this young man and we know the story how uh now notice for Rebellion is the sin of Witchcraft and stubbornness is the iniquity the iniquity and idolatry so as as that evil spirit would start dealing with Saul remember this is the this is the this is a type in Shadow we know what a good spirit does what we know what the Holy Ghost does and we know what the Antichrist Spirit does now remember the one who received the anointing oil from the horn the one who received the presence of God from the horn had a name what was his name David David was his name David was the one who was the Shepherd David was the one who fought the bear and the lion and slew them David was one was the one who took down Goliath with a sling and one stone David was his name but from the very time that Saul received that evil spirit what did Saul call David he would not call him by name but he would call him by time [Laughter] idles an evil spirit keeping the name hidden Time After Time who is this he said and Saul's anger was kindled against Jonathan he said thou son of a perverse rebellious woman do not I confuse it thou has chosen David the son of Jesse and yet David at one point was one of the head leaders of Saul taking he said once he once he saw the people like David more than himself he said he eyed him from that day and separated him from him and then David went out before him as one of his great commanders and mighty leaders and went out Bes and the Bible said he'd be saved to behav himself more wisely than all the rest so Sol s Saul knew his name was David but once he received the evil spirit he only would refer to him and as titles good amen see what the evil spirit does and when he bring the tit he would hide the name of the people but the people knew he was referring because they understood who the titles represented but one by one he says for as long as the son of Jesse liveth upon the ground Thou shalt be established nor thy kingdom then sa and servant stood about me hear y you bites will the will David he says will the son of Jesse give everyone who fields that all of you have conspired against me and there's not there's none that showeth me that my son hath made a league with the son of Jesse title switching the name for titles shows the denominational spe is one and the same ah he says and Saul said unto him why hast thou conspired against me thou and the son of Jesse the title son of Jesse no that's Malachi brother [Laughter] okay now notice what amlc look what the priesthood refers him to and amalec answered the king and said who is so faithful among you of all thy servants as the son of Jesse the priesthood had a revelation the TR priesthood had the revelation of the name of David which is the King's son-in-law Oh my he doesn't refer him to as a son of Jesse but the son of the king oh my David and David's young man came and said to nabal according to all those words the same of as of David and ceased and nabal answered David's servants and said who is David and who is the son of Jesse he said ' there are many servants nowadays that break away from every man from his master so when Saul started referring to him as the son of David everyone in that area referred to him as the son of David as well and already got to who nabal who is a foolish man foolish virgin maybe lost didn't even know who David was who's the son Jesse ain't nobody him now would Saul ever use the name of David again or would he always refer to him as the son of Jesse Remember the Time Saul went after David one more time said I heard among the Wilderness here and he went in and they found a cave and like hey let's just stay tonight in the the cave and call it good they said all right and the Bible said that David and his mighty men were hiding in that cave and the Bible said a deep sleep Came Upon all them and as let me as the Mighty Men says David now's your chance the Lord has re Avenged you and you're the only guy that can do it David goes out with the spear you know how that song goes I love it goes like this and all the mighty man he's he did it he slew the he slew he slew the king now he's the King David comes back with a little clo did he do it did he do it no he say I'll not touch God's anointing but the Bible said in his heart just renting his cloth His Garment rented his heart it broke him so David stayed his servants with these words and suffered them to rise not against Saul but Saul rose up out of the cave and went his way didn't even know anything had taken place so David also Rose after and went out of the cave and cried after Saul my Lord the king then Saul looked behind him he says David he says stooped his face to the ground and bowed himself David said unto Saul why hast thou why hearest thou men's words saying behold David seeketh thy hurt behold this this day thine eyes have seen how the Lord has delivered thee today in my hand in the cave and some bade me kill thee but my eyes spared thee he says and I have not put away I have not put forth my hand against thee my Lord for he is the Lord's anointed look what he's coming out of his heart Saul I could I had you God put you right in my hands God is with me I could have took the crown right now in fact they were pressuring me to do it they wanted me to do it what they want to get out of the Wilderness they want to get back they want to they want fields and ven wordss they want to they want to take over the Nations for God they want to start this ministry now he says and I said no he says more over my father see see the skirt of the robe of my hand for I have cut off thy skirt thy robe and kill thee not know thou and see that there is no evil nor transgression in my hand and I have not sinned against thee yet thou htest my soul to take it the Lord's judge between me and thee and the Lord's avenge me of thee but my eye ha uh but my hand has not been upon thee as the Lord as sayith the proverb of the Ancients wickedness proceeded from the wicked but my hand shall not be upon thee after whom is the king of Israel come out after whom thou dust after a dog a dead dog after flee the Lord therefore judged between me and thee and see and plead my cause and deliver me out of thy hand and it came to pass as David had made an end of the speaking of the words of the Saul that Saul said is this thy voice my son of Jesse now he starts speaking to him something had broken and he realized that David was righteous and he switched back from titles and then calls him David goes right back to the name remember with them titles comes an evil spirit those e that that titles brings or carries an evil spirit saints of God how are we going to win these people we're going to have to get in the spirit of God to say the right as David said the right thing to Saul if David would not came out of the cage cave and revealed things to him and spoken that Saul would have went on and did what he did and just still been angry and this and this but right here at this time David felt led to go and speak to the man at a certain time in a certain kind of way and a certain kind of tone under the anointing of God and He restored his name right back to him amen he says Thou Art more righteous than I and and thou and and for and and for thou Hast rewarded me good whereas I reward thee evil now why is it D why did he want to we hide the name of David because the name of David means loving or beloved he was a type of Christ and God said this is my beloved Son in whom I'm well pleased amen he did not want to call him beloved of the Lord he would not refer to he did not want to we acknowledge that what the God loved him loved David and the spirit of God was with David he would not acknowledge it what this evil spirit within him good but after David brought it in such a way he brought it back he says you are the Beloved of the Lord amen let's rise amen says by God's grace I kept you an hour and 20 sorry well not sorry but I wanted you to see these things it was just a basic study on baptism but it shows you what we're dealing with here that Father Son and Holy Ghost baptism is a dangerous thing I I was false baptized twice and God kept me out of it he kept me from he pulled me right from those things in fact last I knew I still had the little card from the Catholic church I should find it and burn it right but he pulled us out and for those of you who are never baptized or false baptized father and Holy Ghost blessings of the Lord are with you but saints of God pray for Revelation I just heard a brother say this he said he said first of all we need Revelation and then we need to get into action even though it's even though something is revealed to us we still have to take an action for well I see it I see it AB but what are you going to do about it now amen amen so we trust all is well Hearts Minds clear saints of God be encouraged God look what God has blessed you with the correct baptism you've been baptized in the name of Jesus Christ no Devils can get through the the Lord Jesus Christ baptism there's only one spirit that is Promised through that baptism there's only one Spirit guarantees you the Holy Ghost and that what that the spirit of God guarantees you that because who spoke of Peter on that day the Holy Ghost amen Peter says this is the way he says and you shall receive eternal life amen you at that time when you receive him what you will be bride amen there's nothing can stop it straight is the gate and narrow is the way that straight gate is a water way that Waterway carries one Spirit only one Spirit can operate right there hallelujah amen praise God God all Hearts Minds clear SS God if you have something on burden on your heart this morning if you need something we will pray for you by God's grace and all the sort of things but the Lord is good remember the Bible said these are what what Paul say he said these are the unsearchable riches of Christ there are things hidden in here there are things hidden in the quotes there are Greater Heights of understanding and Revelation that we need to get to Hallelujah because remember we're not fighting the war for our El did David fight the war for himself he was fighting for all of Israel he was fighting for God to take full control of the Kingdom absolutely for that area that was the promised land remember the book does not shut until that last Soul receives the Holy Ghost Hallelujah he says at that time of the closing he's let him be filthy that is filthy still him that is righteous righteous still him is unjust still he says and him that is Holy be holy still saints of God let us find these last few and pull them out shut that uh demonic Lifeline that evil spirit Lifeline of that baptism because once they it's amazing how the devil knew that the devil changed baptism and God itad and through that came everything the persecution the the evilness the the the the drunken with the blood of saints the riches everything came through that baptism and somehow the devil knew it because remember it's off the word you're no longer with Christ amen let's let's just say a word of prayer musicians if you want to come and play Here by God's grace something nice the Lord is so mindful to us he has kept us he has shown us Great and Mighty things but just going over this to me when I studied this out I said man he delivered me even at that first initial point where I was hungering for more word and the first first thing one of the first things that God brought was to me through brother Craig brother Brooks was baptism in the name of Jesus Christ this is the way this is the way out this is the way to eternal life this is the correct path right here Saints and I'm so I'm grateful now I'm grateful more now right now than I was back then I was so stirred up back then I was so excited but here right now I see that if I wouldn't have rejected that what I would have been there are people right now from my old church that rejected this baptism and now they have DJ Services at weddings and they're playing Michael Jackson and Metallica and the last time I saw on Facebook one of them has a beer right on there and these are Minister one is a minister singing in the church denomination Church they have beers now they have this that I meet a lot of Christians on the church they're still cussing and swearing there is no difference because when they get baptized that way that's the lifeline of the devil when you go off one word what does it do it opens the that's literally the crack that lets demons enter in and remember it's a spiritual thing what is baptism you're dying with Christ you're dying with your mate you're literally taking on uh when he died on the cross that's what that represents you're dying with him by baptism into that so it's a spiritual coming into a covenant with him you're coming to a marriage with him and if you do that wrong you're coming into another marriage a different marriage in the wrong way yes sir and with that wrong marriage comes the wrong things amen amen so let's just let's just bow our heads here by God's grace let's lift our hands to the Lord let's say a word of prayer dear Lord Jesus Lord we love you and Lord God as I look back now 23 years later God lord from when you revealed your word Lord to me Lord and I see how powerful that revelation of baptism is Lord God on how your name must be used the proper name the proper way Lord I'm so thankful Lord that you showed us and revealed this to us God and Lord God we love you so much Lord bless Every Soul that pushed their way out Lord give them strength God give them might Lord God give them Faith Lord God give them understanding and revelation God lord as we continue in on this journey we have with you Lord Lord guide us Lord lead us Lord by the power of thy Spirit Lord and Lord we need you Lord God Lord help us Lord to cry and sigh for the Abominations done in the city Lord God help us Lord to to find our Lo the lost souls Lord our brothers and sisters Lord who still need us Lord put it in US Lord uh a real hunger and thirst God Lord Lord help us get to where you want us to be a God lord every day should be a growth God every move should be a growth God a step higher Lord uh more more Revelation Lord more communion with you Lord help us to push and press God Bless the people Lord for a little cut up little study God strength them God protect them God in all their ways Lord keep their minds Lord Lord may you come out Lord may they yield Lord that second and Third Realm Lord God if you dwell in their hearts Lord their souls God Lord rise up through them God take full control Lord you're at the helm Lord you're at the control tower God Lord guide each one God lord lord Jesus help us Lord to yield these veils God help us to get so sick and tired of Leo to see it Lord tired of ourselves Lord tired of the things we see in the world we see destruction just here Lord this things ready to ignite Lord God help us Lord be with us Lord guide us Lord fill us Lord fill our lamps with the oil Lord once again Lord give us a double portion Bless the people in the name of Jesus Christ amen amen don't you love the Lord Jesus Christ his word is eternal he keeps us from things I mean sints of God what if he would not have showed us this how many demons would I have had on me thousands TW I mean my goodness out of our genetics what we see our parents right depression that depression Spirit got a stronghold on my daddy our daddy but by the end the Lord's going to Lord's going to take care of that when he rises once more when the Holy Ghost Rises once more and comes on the seed for his bride things are going to take place let us let us yield ourselves once again say Lord God I commit my life back to you and from this day forward Lord God Lord God no matter what someone says no matter what someone does I know it's just flesh it's not them you find the most wicked man in the world the one that's killed a million people on their deathbed they'll be crying because they're just flesh when that evil anointing comes off them I guarantee they regret what they've done remember that giant man that tried to kill brother brandom that Maniac I'm gonna I'm gonna rip you from limb to limb brother B said he had every Power to do it but before that demon possessed man could get to him the Holy Ghost said he says but you he says who challenged the Holy Ghost will fall before my feet and that Maniac fell and the police are like what are we going to do he said just leave him be he says is he healed he says no he loves that Spirit when he comes back he says he'll be exactly the same just haul them off but I guarantee you if we could get someone free from those Spirits they'd become a normal happy individual Hallelujah let me ask you like this most babies the most babies are born are they happy or they mean they want to be they want to be happy they want to smile and giggle and laugh and go go right they want to do all that if you treat him that way if you nurture them that way they're going to be happy but if you get a parent with a bad Spirit on them an evil spirit that child will be angry and hateful and throw and talk back and all those sort of things The Same Spirit that was on the parents who jumps to the children it's the same with the false church if the church has a false Doctrine false Spirit it'll jump onto the people as well absolutely saints of God thank God for you have a wonderful Pastor brother Jess amen praying seeking the Lord for what does feed to his sheep there by God God's sheep there so let's
