will you be glorified here tonight help us lord to yield to you in jesus christ's name and everybody said amen praise god let's stand and take our bibles we want to read two portions of scripture here let's go to second peter 1 6 and then we'll read our memory verse from first thessalonians 5. so 2nd peter 1 6 we like to look at temperance tonight by god's grace uh ii peter 1 6. while you're turning there i don't know if you remember but last summer i preached on patience i don't know if you remember that we had visitors from my school come it was on a couple of sunday nights in july so lord willing i'll probably skip patience i'll just you know briefly review it next time lord willing because we've already heard it recently who doesn't need more patience though god knows i need more of it praise god remember it's so important the trials and the suffering is what produces patience and we can't run from that we have to welcome that we have to praise god in the midst of the storm that's what will give us grace to be more patient so ii peter 2 i'm sorry second peter 1 verse 6. thank you let's read this one then we'll read our memory verse uh one two three and to knowledge temperance and to temperance patience and the patience godliness let's go to first thessalonians 5 14. thessalonians 5 14. we'll read 14 down to uh 23 by the grace of god remember this is right after the rapture text praise god this is his advice here let's read 14-23 1 2 3 now we exhort you brethren warn them that our unruly comfort the feeble-minded support the weak be patient toward all men see that none render evil for evil unto any man but ever follow that which is good both among yourselves and to all men rejoice evermore pray without ceasing in everything give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus concerning you quench not the spirit despise not prophesying prove all things hold fast that which is good abstain from all appearance of evil and the very god of peace sanctify you holy and i pray god your whole spirit and soul and body be preserved blameless unto the coming of our lord jesus christ may god has a blessing and rhema his word may be seated praise god well i'm coming off a great week on the lord you know i had some great services sunday and it's been a great week you know today i got two emails one from uh af or congo and then one from india people are enjoying the videos online and learning in it and one of them wants to translate my book for me into one of the india languages or dialects so i'm not sure about that i appreciate that but uh i gotta check him out first you know make sure he's a good good soldier uh so just encouraging there and uh it's been a great week in the lord we're still working on writing the seventh uh church age chapter by god's grace so that's a great study it's going really good i'm learning a lot of things about the church ages i never knew um so it's been really great um i just there's so much to it but i love it and uh thankful for god's grace here i guess we'll just get right to the word here uh so let's look at temperance here tonight i got some good quotes here some i've never read to you before i've just been listening you know to brother branham and finding these good quotes so i think they'll be a blessing to you about temperance here by god's grace now uh here peter the man remember he had the keys to the kingdom and he also had the keys to a statue of a perfect man praise god he had both what a what a commission this guy had he had he had keys to open salvation to all bibles that he had the gospel to the circumcision so he was the preacher to lead the jews with the holy ghost and then paul was the preacher the gospel to the uncircumcision so wow paul and peter just those twin towers there i'll say it like that just twin pillars ah what amazing uh what amazing faith they had praise god and remember paul was the messenger to the age because he rebuked peter in church that's what i like about peter he had so much experiences with god but look how humble he was he was humble enough to accept correction from a man that didn't know jesus personally but he knew him by the holy spirit amen what uh what a godly man peter my uh i just think so much of these bible saints you know i always you know look i don't know about you i was trying to look up my life which one am i most like you know i try to i try to see which one am i most like which is the least among all of them you know that's who i'd say i would be like but uh such amazing things such amazing revelations that god and that's what i believe i believe jesus will have paul and peter right there on the side so that's what i believe i could be wrong but the gospel to the circumcision gospel to the uncircumcision uh i just believe it'll be that way i could be wrong that just struck me right now i never thought about that uh my what amazing testimonies those men have thank god for their testimonies but remember it's all by grace it's all by god's mercy so temperance is a fourth portion of the holy spirit it's another level we'd say of anointing and it means in the greek self-control as we said on sunday i kind of close sunday night it's the virtue of one who masters his desires and passions especially his sensual appetites so when you have self-control you are able to master your sight what you look at uh you're able to master your taste what you eat or drink what you touch what you smell and what you hear okay so that is the quality of temperance it's the anointing of the holy spirit in other words without god's spirit you can't really monitor and control what you look at right or what you eat or what you what you see or what you smell or what you taste you won't be able to control that without the real power of the holy spirit amen that's why god gave it to us at the fourth step was temperance and it's interesting four is the earthly number right so temperance is control over the body right and the body is an earth bound uh temple right it's earth bound so that's interesting four deals with that and so you know once you know once you have faith you know god's way once you have virtue you have strength to to to walk it knowledge helps you understand why you're walking on it right turns the lights on uh and now temperance gives you the control to remain on the way so you don't leave the the narrow way and go to the broadway where everybody oh i want to i want my lust and my flesh to be satisfied and i just got to have another smoker that was my battle right i just got to have another uh marriage partner i just gotta get married a third time you know like so many people do uh but see temperance will keep you on the straight and narrow praise god it won't let you satisfy your flesh above the soul praise god and that's a great anointing that god gives us uh in other words temperance empowers you to be more spiritual than carnal right what remember what does the bible call sinners the bible calls them brute beasts right so man or woman without the holy ghost is nothing but a beast but when you get holy ghost temperance now you're beginning to control the beast right that black dog now you're beginning to control that black dog and not feed him and you don't become a beast now you're becoming a saint praise god now you're becoming separated hallelujah the bible called them saints in the old testament and they weren't born again right but they were separated by the holy spirit praise god the anointing they could receive on their flesh and in their mind they were separated to that praise god and so now you become a more spiritual person rather than everything is decided by the flesh like just in a small way like little kids right they got to go out and use the bathroom three or four times a service not not ours you know but some at some churches not not naomi's not i'm not not nobody here is what i'm saying but you know at school i got kids like that i'll just say it like that uh and then they gotta you know they can't control their eating right they they just they have a heart they're just such carnal creatures uh that they can't control themselves uh their their sensual appetites and and but these must be brought into subjection or obedience to the holy spirit in other words once you have temperance you work by god your your sixth sense instead of your five senses right because temperance is that it's control it's your sixth sense faith having control over your five senses praise god that's what it means that's what temperance is you can control your fleshly appetites that's right remember faith is a substance right it's a substance of things hoped for the evidence of things not seen praise god now you know this but galatians 5 24 25 it sums up the spiritual versus natural battle so it sums up the battle of temperance versus fleshly lust and the bible said and they that are christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit praise god so your your victory if you're going to be spiritually minded if you're going to live by faith the sense of faith the spiritual sense rather than the natural sense it only comes through crucifying and abstaining from the lusts of the flesh praise god uh see so crucifixion is a slow cruel death just like jesus's crucifixion and he says take up your cross daily and follow me and paul said die daily he's talking about uh crucifying his temptations through the five senses amen all right so that's a pretty good uh introduction there to temperance now as i wrote this i just kind of felt inspired uh to get to the the three channels of temptation so we'll be getting that in just a few moments but if you got your bible uh go to first corinthians three i want you to notice here in first corinthians 3 1-7 paul calls the church carnal which means they were they were living in their flesh and they were satisfying the desires of their flesh now remember this is the same church that had tongues interpretation prophecy knowledge gifts i mean they had all the gifts so much that paul said just two or three in a service right he had so much they were i'll say like this they were so gifted but yet they were so carnal now we find the opposite many times say we're more dedicated than natural but we're not as spiritually gifted as we like right like who wouldn't want to prophesy like right brother amen like i would love to speak in tongues and then interpret it i wish i could but god doesn't work that way by what we want god gives us what he knows we need amen but they were the opposite brother amen they had so much gifts but yet no control over their bodies now which one would you rather have brother adam tells you he'd rather have the consecrated life right because brother braham said brother branson look at that ephesian church paul didn't have to rebuke them about sleeping with their mothers in law right or i'm sorry their stepmom he'd have to rebuke him and teach him about gifts he got down to the deep things of god how you were chosen in christ before the foundation of the world amen oh my so see but remember god loves a variety god likes gifted churches you know god likes god god has churches that are extremely gifted but more carnal but then he's got real spiritual churches with not as many gifts god has a variety right just like he's got big families small families black families white families brown family he loves a variety god is and god's in all that praise god and none of us can add any cubit to our stature but i'll say this we can covet the best gifts amen remember we saw that sunday night you and i can covet we can say god give us more praise god because remember amen my wife asked me a good question i'm going to share this with you my wife said how come there you know there aren't more gifts many times and i it just came to me and that's what i found out the gift just makes room for itself when people ask me questions many times the gift will just operate and the scripture came to me that the bible says let no man take your crown right and every gift is a talent and jesus said if this man won't do the talent i'll give it to another man so see when it comes down to gifts if we're not earnestly coveting and praying for more gifts of operation god will say well if you're not going to use it i'll give it to brother amen i'll give it to sister lydia or you know you know what i mean because and that's why brother abraham said the holy ghost can fall on one person one time to do one gift and then never use that person again well that may be because they grieve the holy spirit after that or it could be nobody else was open to it nobody was open to being yielded to the holy spirit so god chose that person amen because they were open to it praise god like my wife was saying my wife had a very prophetic dream like you like you guys have dreams and she went and warned the woman and she laughed it off and said oh i'd never wear pants or cut my hair within a couple years she did it and my wife's never had a real prophetic dream like that since in the same case to me i did the same thing i warned a minister's uh son-in-law yeah son-in-law and they just went right to it a few years after that but that's like a one-time thing like right now in my life and recently in my ministry i'm seeing more speaking the word faith i'm that's what you know like with who is dad uh and then my friend's dad and then the the two couples that couldn't have children you know so it's just interesting you know you look at your life church and and see and ask god to show you which gifts are operating in my life and help me to be faithful with the talents you've given me praise god help me to earnestly covet the best gifts but look he finds a carnal church first corinthians 3 1. we're going to read one to seven so lydia can you put him up there hun yeah you're good at that thanks you're good too okay i'm the bad one and i brethren could not speak unto you as spiritual now look at this but as in the cardinal even as unto babes in christ they remember they prophesied all the time they had miracles but yet he said spiritually you're babies because you're carnal in other words you don't have temperance right my they were coming to church they were operating the gifts for the amen but they were carnal and didn't even have temperance right remember paul called that man who slept with his step uh i'm sorry his mother yes stepmom paul called him a brother paul said put him under the blood our brother that he might give him over to satan that he might be saved a brother that means he at least had justification now there's no way he had the holy ghost doing that kind of evil thing but he was at least justified and paul gave the benefit of the doubt sometimes christians that are not born again make sexual sins like that and it's a shame it shouldn't be named once in the church of god but sometimes it happens in the church of god when people don't have temperance look you're babies but yet they had all kinds of powerful gifts and operation see out today church this is this is a great mystery this christianity is a great mystery you better we better know christ amen we need to know the revelations you know we need to know the revelation of the mystery but thank god he said it will be finished in the last days amen oh what a blessing we have to have the revelation of the mystery of god amen amen so see no matter how spiritual people are but amen no matter how much supernatural we may see in other people's lives that's fine but let's watch how they live afterwards let's see how they act the next week amen let's see what they act like let's see what they say let's see how they treat the not the highest people in the church but the least esteemed people in the church let's see if they can even love the unlovable let's see how they can love their enemies praise god paul said i gotta rebuke you you're just babies number two i'm sorry verse two i have fed you with milk and not with meat see you couldn't go into the deep things before the foundation of the world for hitherto you were not able to bear it neither yet now are you able remember he said melchizedek was a deep thing remember that that was in hebrews 5. no i'm sorry hebrews 6. no it's five and six sorry verse three for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you envying and strife and divisions are you not yet carnal and walk as men mine they were christians but walking like the world because of those go back to three because of what envying strife and divisions anytime you see a church that has envying divisions and strife they are not mature christians they're baby christians is that right that's that's the word of god think about all the church splits people have it's because they're baby christians now unless there's a good reason for you know if the leadership's off the word yeah then you should separate if they won't take corrections yes you should separate and divide yourself don't be amongst 11 right be unleavened praise god next verse verse 4 for while one saith i'm a paul another i'm of apollos are you not are you yet carnal see they were bragging it's not a sin to say well i go to brother jesse's church i go to brother samuel's church or brother cam that's not a sin but paul gets down to their sin they in the next verses they were proud of it they were bragging on the preachers instead of bragging on jesus amen okay next verse 5 who then is paul who's apollos but ministers by whom you believe even as the lord gave to every man see every man's got a preacher every man you're gonna everybody's gonna go to some pastor's church but that don't make you any better and we shouldn't end the other people and we shouldn't exalt ourselves above anybody else verse six i have planted apollos water but god gave the increase oh i love how paul says it remember that remember uh paul went to ephesus remember and and he said have you received holy ghost since you believe and apollos was out of town and they got the holy ghost well paul said i planted that seed in their souls and then apollos came back and saw they were filled the holy ghost and watered it praise god but paul never said i'm better because you know you got the you got they got the holy ghost under me i'm greater paul never said that paul said we're all working together to make these seeds quicken and to bring forth fruit unto god next verse so then neither is he that planted anything neither he that watereth but god that gives the increase amen see you and i cannot increase i can't give you a revelation you can't give me a revelation only god can give it amen but we all work together we all do our little parts and if each of us does our little part each of us pray and create an atmosphere during the song service and worship god and love god and covet earnestly the best gifts then god gives an increase in the church amen praise god go back one verse though verse six god gives the increase i just want to see that i want you to see that again paul planted the holy ghost as far as they got the holy ghost they got the seed of god through paul's preaching and praying but apollos come afterwards and watered that but god is the one that gave the increase in other words god is the one that saved you don't say brother jesse save me or brother branham save me or no no one saved you jesus saved you praise god jesus gave the increase thank god somebody shared the word with you i thank god for simon but simon didn't save me christ saved me amen christ gave me the increase simon watered amen brother brooks planted uh simon show me the seed but then you know and then here and being a pastor you know god waters through me praise god but i'm just i'm i'm just on the same we're all on the same level we're way down here christ is way up there amen but see paul calls them you carnal church you baby church i don't want to be a baby message church that's what they do they they exalt some preachers and you've heard it you know some people exalt some preachers way above others paul said it's not that way it's not that way shouldn't be that way because he said that's when you're carnal that's when you're not you're not walking in temperance you're looking at how look you're you're going by your sight and what you hear oh i can hear this person on the internet and oh i see what kind of big church they have or what kind of nice clothes he's wearing his vehicle is a lot nicer than other people's you know uh they they live off of those things rather than the holy spirit because the holy spirit respects no man above any other he's not a respecter of persons but he is a rewarder of those that diligently seek him amen he's not a respecter he's a rewarder amen glory see they couldn't handle meat preaching remember meat preaching is discerning good and evil that's why the man that's why the man in the in chapter five that's chapter three in chapter five the man sleeping with his step mom the bible said they weren't even upset about it see they they couldn't handle the meat the meat would have told them that's wrong and they would discern that's evil paul had to come by and be their meat for them right he had to be he had to be their discernment for them he said you need to get rid of him put him out front of the blood and let his soul be saved on that day see we don't want just uh milk preaching there is a time for milk preaching especially for the children or the justified or you know or those who have you know just getting virtue or knowledge or something like that but pretty soon you have to grow up into meat praise god and you have to uh you have to stop looking at preachers and start looking at the word christ behind all of it if not you're going to be extremely carnal extremely extremely envious extremely divided because you only like this type of preacher only like that type of preacher unlike preachers from that state or only like preachers that act like this and that's carnal and it should not be in the church of god amen now i'd skipped a little bit but let me go back to this remember in order to get every anointing on the statute perfect man you have to reject something right with faith you got to reject unbelief right with virtue i forget the one you gotta reject i can't remember that now with knowledge you gotta reject reasoning well with temperance you have to reject sensuality now pull up the scripture well yeah pull up jude 1 18 19. [Music] now over time church this is going to encourage you amen over time you can judge christians who have temperance by the church they go to right because the bible says they went out from us because they were not of us so if you look at the long-term membership of a church and the people that really love god you're going to find the people that are temperate that's true look at this how they that told you there should be mockers in the last time are we living the last time they're mocking us they're mocking christians who should walk after their own ungodly lust next verse these be they who separate themselves sensual not having the holy spirit there's always going to be a few judases hanging around and the church said but for the real godly saints they're the most the people that's what i can say thank god for our church praise god most of the people in the church if they're temperate then they're staying here because this is a place of holiness because those that are sensual the bible said they separate themselves they don't like to hang around you holy rollers praise god because you don't want to do the things they do praise god see so as time goes by like we've been hanging about run bang now for 20 years almost he's a holy man by the holy spirit not by because he's something great you know i'm nobody either i'm just saying he loves holiness he hasn't separated himself but many of our friends have right many of our friends have separated themselves from our fellowship because they're sensual they like the lust of the flesh and so they're uh they don't have the holy spirit see so see there is something to be said for church attendance and staying at one church there's something to be said for that it proves you got the holy ghost praise god and you're temperate hallelujah remember judas hung around so long but he couldn't go to the pentecost he showed his colors oh thank you lord go to second timothy 2 22. remember paul said follow me as i follow christ so brother is not here but we follow his message but you have to follow somebody physically and paul tells us who to follow he tells you to follow people who are not sensual not carnal in other words follow people that have temperance flee also youthful lusts but follow righteousness faith charity peace with them that call on the lord out of a pure heart ah that's what i like i like to be on a church where they're calling upon god they're worshiping god and they're doing it from the purity the sincerity they're not doing it for show they're doing it because they love god and they need god we need more of god as time goes on we're need more of god to make it through laodicea amen amen so the bible said flee from those youthful lusts right we'll get to some examples in just a moment here literally flee them remember any of these lusts anything you see taste uh feel smell hear anything that that uh abstain from all appearance of evil the bible says brother cam gave me a good tip and i need to do this so i'm just i'm saying it so i remember cam said he said his uh phone did he say that he set his phone to the 12 year old setting you know how you can do like 12 18. uh you can do explicit nc 17. i didn't realize that but i'm gonna have to do that he said he put it on 12 years old and so he don't get any of the ads anymore that show like you know women in bikinis or uh you know things like men wearing underwear i thought man that's a good idea i need to do that that's a great idea i didn't know you could do that because you know as a christian we don't purposely go to those things but satan tries to surprise us with it and it kind of upsets us at times right now i don't know about you but i get most of my news from youtube i you know subscribe to fox and a few other places uh daily wire and a couple other guys well i pay 13 a month so i don't have to see those filthy ads to me it's worth every penny 13 bucks is a deal not to see those filthy ads because i'll take it because i don't want to hear the filthy rap i don't want to hear the fear of the filthy country music i don't want to see the alcohol i don't want to see the ads for new cars i don't want to see that so i want to so i want to learn and this should be true for all of us we should get better at being holy on our phones and our tablets as time goes on it should be more holy praise god if not we need to get rid of it or stop saying where holy ghost filled nine so flee from it and then follow those people that call upon god with a pure heart amen i love that that's beautiful so church you can see we're starting to see a huge difference but amen as i've been around the message just you know just about 19 years i can i can tell now looking back i can tell which churches were temperate and which ones weren't because of the things they saw tasted touch smelled and heard they would they would talk about hearing and enjoying things that i knew was wrong right and then i heard then they would talk about their relationships that were in you know some deacons and preachers married two or three times how is this happening in this church and they want me to preach you know just you know you as you it's very easy you just have to to discern just listen to what they say and look at what they do right look at their five senses which sense are they feeding the most the five senses or the sixth sense amen let's feed faith amen let's be faithful now let's look at this uh real briefly so as i as i was writing this is months ago maybe a year ago i felt led of the holy spirit this would be the right place to put the lust of the eyes the pride of life and the lust of the flesh because temperance is where you get the victory over all those things at least the lust of the flesh and lust of the eyes i felt it was so inspired i really believe it was inspired see your temptations come in one of these three categories either lust of the flesh lust of the eyes pride of life now let's look at some very simple lust of the flesh examples now i define this as sinful acts that bring your flesh pleasure or satisfaction in a sinful way right in a simple way because there's nothing wrong with you know wanting to go eat you know supper not wrong with that but here's the first one the bible clearly says drunkenness perverts your moral judgment according to proverbs 31 4-5 and drunkards will not inherit the kingdom of god praise god so that's a very simple one most of us of course wouldn't get drunk uh so that's a very simple one now here's the one where i have some new quotes i've never read before and this is what i wrote months ago pull up proverbs 23 20 lydia proverbs 23 20. let's look at overeating because i mentioned this on sunday and this is one that's awful in america that's why we have diabetes because people overeat they especially the pop and sugar it's like they're idle they got to have mountain dew or dr pepper or whatever even sugary coffee drinks my coffee i don't put any sugar in my coffee just milk i don't put anything in there because i don't want i don't want diabetes down the road i don't want that i stopped drinking pop 20 years ago because i saw the effects that it was having on my life but look at proverbs 23 20 be not among wine bibbers among riotous eaters of flesh so see right to so lots of parties feasting eating next verse 21 for the drunkard and the glutton shall come to poverty and drowsiness shall clothe a man with rags so see that someone that overeats what does that mean they overspend on food and not only that but if they overspend on food that becomes an evil habit and then they just overspend on everything see because you over overspend you spend too much money on food spend too much time on food and then it leads to an addiction of spending too much money on everything so the bible says those that are gluttonous often come to poverty because they put all their money in eating and then they can develop bad habits of of spending too much money as well look at philippians 3 18 and 19 lydia paul now we'll get to this eventually when we preach our series that the lord tarries and he keeps directing me to philippians paul says in philippians 3 18 for many walk of whom i have told you often and now tell you even weeping now this made paul cry that they are the enemies of the cross of christ can you imagine being an enemy of the cross of christ i don't want to be an enemy of it i want to be a supporter of it praise god i want to be an advocate for the cross in other words more people need the cross amen i need the cross we all need the cross but some people paul would cry and say they're fighting against the cross well how are they doing that verse 19 whose end is their destruction whose god is their belly so they really don't worship god jesus they worship right here so i can get satisfied that's the most important thing of the day is where am i going to eat next or how can i convince these christians to give me more money so i can go feed myself and this made paul cry whose glories and their shame who mined earthly things all they thought about was the next meal and the next indulgence to the flesh now it might not be a problem in our church but you go to other churches you're gonna find a lot of people are overweight now sometimes people can't help it but most of the time people can help it because look it's in the word i'm not talking about a five or ten extra pounds i'm not talking about that i'm talking about when when you and i know when we know in our minds we've got a problem our biggest concern is our belly instead of heavenly treasures praise god let me read you some quotes i thought you might like these from brother branham this is from the absolute after the seals december 1st that's my brother paul's birthday paul brother runs into a brother and he says i met brother uh buddhist out here and i hadn't seen him since i've been here and i said height where you been he said getting turkey dinner ready for them and so i was telling him i'd lost some weight and he said you i said you haven't changed a bit he said neither have you i said that's real diplomacy i said but you know i have lost weight i went from 170 to 145 so i sure have changed so brother brahms lost some weight here 25 pounds my suits all too big a little too big for me and someone just got me one the other day so i could wear it down here one that didn't hang off my shoulders and the waistline lap over so brothers were watching brother branham and he was so skinny that his suits look funny on him like a clown his waist would lap over maybe the belt would be really really tight and you know how pants look when they when you're they're too big for you and people noticed his jackets were just too big for him and so the brother's like can i buy you a new suit you kind of look like you're you're a little guy in a big suit brother ram said now here's what he says about losing 25 pounds i'm trying to do my very best for jesus christ while i have a chance to do it amen brother man lost 25 pounds after the seals so he could do a better job serving jesus christ anybody knows once you get overweight and you lose that weight you just have more energy right anyone knows that brother branham knew that and he says it not one time i got multi i got three quotes here mouth of two or three witnesses anybody knows that now i was joking the other night i was up up late eating ice cream and that's true i did that a couple of nights but i don't do it every night because if i do you'll see pimples all over me my wife will see them on my shoulders and my back i just break out i just can't handle much sugar every now and then i'll have a little extra ice cream that i'm probably supposed to have but it's just you know five or ten minutes it's a little bowl i'm not talking about eating three or four bowls in a week i'm not talking about that and people ask me brother amen how come you're not gaining weight i said well because i try to take care of i try to make it spiritual because it is i the reason i exercise and i love exercising with malachi but the reason i do it is so my temple will last a little longer so i'm not in the hospital and i can serve jesus christ that's the reason i do it most of my friends by the their bellies instead of looking like this they're looking like that and they're only 38 39 40 41 42 and they're ch they got three or four chins you know i'm not making fun of them but church i believe if you're if you don't if you have temperance you can control how much you eat see it proves when they get overweight on purpose it proves they don't have temperance but peter said add it amen instead of adding the food add temperance instead praise god i mean overeating food because normal foods good if you eat enough green vegetables and and green beans and carrots and everything like that you're going to lose weight you're going to be healthy praise god the trouble is they eat a taco bell and most of that has preservatives in it and then they'll go home and eat a snicker bar and then they'll drink a lemonade or an iced tea or something like that and it's all the wrong food and it's not what your body needs you're not giving it what it needs so it turns it into fat but see the bible says he who has temper is temper in everything amen that means he can drive by a taco bell or mcdonald's or you can walk by the ice cream section and not be a slave to the ice cream section a giant eagle amen or all to you that's where i mostly shop aldi you understand but so many people in the message are addicted to the fleshly things overeating and that is a clear sign brothers and sisters they don't have temperance maybe they had it at one time but remember you can lose the anointing you might have good treasures in your house but if you let that devil in there of of overeating and gluttony he'll rob he'll spoil that temperance and he'll take it away from you and tie up your faith praise god it's true i mean i i don't think brother brother brooks would mind me saying this but every time he's here he goes for a jog right he was jogging friday and saturday and i think monday morning he took a jog he said brother jesse i got to work so hard to keep he'll run four or five miles and he's in his 60s just to keep his weight normal because his his metabolism is so slow if he doesn't do that he'll just keep going and that's what i admire about him and that see that shows me that shows me that if you've got temperance you're going to keep trying even in your 60s right because he's the father of he's my spiritual father and that's what i love about that he's taking care of himself he realizes if i don't take care of the natural i'm going to get diseases and that's going to hinder my service to god but i want to be a servant of god who's faithful i want to be a servant of god who's trustworthy amen who can who's devoted to the work of god and not the work of getting a happy living in laodicea that's why i try to fast you know as much as i can so brother man lost 25 pounds why to win a fashion show to win a beauty contest to win a strong man contest brothers the arnold expo they have an arnold expo you know where they pose and everything like that no he did it so he could serve christ better 25 pounds that was in december 63. now this is in november 61. brother braham said right now i'm not eating pleasant foods and i have it since the going away of my mother so when his mom died he just stopped eating pleasant foods he said i'm seeking the lord for a new vision can you imagine that someone you love so much dies and you say god i need a new vision so i'm going to stop eating as much as i used to i'm just eating soft things as little as i can get by with [Music] see in america we're always seeing how much we can get for our money right how much can i eat at that all you can eat buffet now they won't have any more because of corona virus but that's that's the attitude of all a lot of friends a lot of people in the message i want to get as much as i can for my money and by the way i'm saying when i need a vision from god a new spiritual devotion from god i need to eat as little as i can just enough to get by with it he was a small man church brother man was not a big man he says now i'm not fasting so see eating a little bit is not fasting no just to do that that ain't giving that to the lord see he's saying i'm not fast he said i'm not fasting to lose weight he said because that wouldn't be for the lord that'd be for me right he says you want to give the lord the best you got he says it twice there amen when you need a new vision when you need a breakthrough with god he said i'm just eating less so see i'm more spiritual more temperate instead of being so carnal all the time you know you ever heard that expression hangry you're so hung hungry that you're angry it's funny but it's wrong unless like you're gonna die or something like that but a lot of people get like that especially in america if they don't get what they want when they want it if i don't get my chipotle i like chipotle that's why i'm saying that if i don't get my panera if i don't get my whatever they get angry see that shows a lack of temperance and that's carnal here's the last one but this is in uh hebrews chapter 1 uh 1957. he says now uh i may fly to california up to maine just where he would call me that's the reason i don't set long itineraries i can't do that my ministry is not cut out that way which is different now i came home for a little rest i lost 20 pounds in the last meeting and brother mercer and brother goad was up a little while ago and said brother branham i notice what you do you put your whole heart into it so brother branham and god had to show them this brother branham god told him to go up in and hunt so he could rest his mind and body and while up there he would you know eat meat and he would gain weight you know because he has all those animals to eat but then when he would go into a long meeting all the strain on his body and his mind all the staying up preaching for pete no preaching and praying for the sick he would lose weight and the brothers noticed like brother branham you're a lot thinner and he said that's because he said i'm putting my whole heart into it now church that should be for us too anytime we're putting our whole heart into serving jesus christ our spiritual desires should be greater than our natural desires i think the reason i'm preaching on this so long is because this is the biggest one of the biggest problems in the message i see with temperance people just can't control their bodies they can't control what they eat they can't most people have a hard time with that and they just balloon and balloon and balloon and i'm not saying there's nothing wrong with a just you know a little bit of weight as you gain a little weight as you get older i'm not saying about that but i'm saying about the spirit of this laodicean church age the spirit of lusting for the things of the flesh brother man said yeah he said you put your whole heart into it he said i said yeah that's right that's the only way you can do a right kind of job for the lord is to put everything you got right in the forefront for christ all your strength all your soul all your heart all your mind everything you got amen hallelujah amen give everything you got to christ even how much food you eat i'm not saying starve yourself yeah for many years i've been taking a multivitamin so you know i get those nutrients i may not get during the day and then i can eat less he said whatever you got put it in the use of god's service so there's three quotes but ram said the reason i lose weight is i want to give my very best to jesus christ now i appreciate marriage banquets i preach it as well i've told sisters and brothers yeah the reason you might want to lose weight is to be more attractive to your spouse but your spouse should never put you down for your weight male or female we're supposed to be children of love right but there's nothing wrong with me well i like to look healthy so my wife thinks i'm attractive that kind of sounds kind of silly but yeah that's the funny thing about marriage you know but there's nothing wrong with that brother said it's part of a woman to be pretty but ram said there's nothing wrong with a woman wanting to be pretty for her husband there's nothing wrong with that but you don't let it go overboard right where you dress sexy or you or you know you starve yourself or you develop you know what do they call that throw up syndrome what do they call that anorexia thank you sister that's right yeah that was big when we were growing up and when i was in high school that a lot of the girls did that they would eat and then you see one at a time they go into the bathroom and you'd hear and they throw it up just to stay slim and trim which is very unhealthy that just is evil right because what a waste that is you gorge yourself and then you go throw it up that's what a waste that is so vain right so i want to move on now but does everybody understand i preach really hard about that brother amen i preach hard on having big families and a lot of people don't like me i preach holiness like let's live it if it's in the bible let's live it praise god and nobody to this day has ever shown me a scripture against it either overeating or having a big family no one's ever to this day show me i've had preachers come in here and say i know you believe in big families brother jess well that's because it's the word and no one's ever showed me a scripture where it's okay to limit it now unless the mother's sick right unless the mother we know that that's wisdom right you don't put yourself in a evil situation unless you know god like brother branham remember brother bram uh he knew he's gonna have a joseph and the doctors say we gotta we gotta close up we gotta get rid of your wife's ovaries and everything like that uh she just had too many babies too many c-sections brother man said doctor that's fine but you aren't touching that because the lord told me i'm going to have a baby another i have a boy that's different that's different remember the doctor said you know her uterus is so so thin it'll it'll break and they'll lose the baby and she'll lose her life and brother man said it doesn't matter what your science says god told me i'm going to have a son praise god that's different that's different but if the mother's life is in jeopardy no of course we don't tell the mothers to put their lives in jeopardy unless they're feeling led of the lord because if they're in god's hands they're in the perfect hands they'll be totally safe all right so let's move on i hope that's a blessing i may preach that again on sunday as well because i want the whole church to hear i know some people don't hear wednesday nights because i don't know why but sometimes so i want to make sure i appreciate it again i hope you can sit through that maybe again on sunday like just a little bit of that because i want them to see what brother ram said we got to give god our best we got to give god our best and it's too easy church it's too easy to be worldly in america hopefully naomi and beatrice can say amen to that one this is the world of plenty this is the land of the plenty right if there ever was a laodicean age it's right here but we've got to master that we've got to deny that and take up a cross brother amen and follow jesus praise god hallelujah the next one is sexual sins the lust of the flesh remember david's son amnon he was so vexed with fleshly lust that he raped his half-sister tamar and then he was later murdered by her full brother absalon and remember we know it was lust because as soon as he got done with it done raping her he started hating her right afterwards real love will wait to the wedding night so i hope our sisters and young girls hear that any man that would mistreat you and try to steal something so precious as your innocence that's not even a man that's a beast that's a dog amen but a real man who'll wait to the wedding night and wait to the marriage life that's a man that's got real temperance praise god holy ghost temperance amen paul said purge out put away that wicked church member brother who was fornicating with his stepmom purge him out he's dirty he's filthy purge him out of the church now drugs is another one the word witchcraft in the new testament means drugs so anyone addicted to drugs that's a lust of the flesh we've had you know the young guys that used to come to our church that was their big thing drugs which witchcraft though and one of the brothers told me but amen when he would he would do it so he could see demons in that realm and they would try to get him to jump out the window of like a four-story building and he would and his friends would have to save him from jumping out that's witchcraft when people take those uh drugs and opioids or whatever they're they're messing with demons and adam will my cousin will tell you that he's seen demons he's felt demons when he was high on those drugs all those years cocaine all that like that that's the realm of demonic spirits uh it's witchcraft and remember he just wants to get started on one little one like smoking and then i'll get you on the next one drinking and then the next one marijuana and the next one you cocaine and it keeps going and going and going because he wants to steal kill and destroy christians will not do that because they're going to inherit the kingdom of god now let's remove the lust of the eyes this is a very simple one as well now remember lusting of the eyes is very close to covetousness because you want you covet you often covet the things you see like right now i'm battling this i'll just be honest i covet having all my houses the outside landscaping looking so beautiful i just don't i want to get rid of all the weeds you know i'd so i've got to be careful like not to go overboard on it because i just i like things looking nice and in order right like at the church we want things to be nice and in order i got to be careful because i drive i did i was driving my house was like wow look at that landscape and that is awesome but i gotta remember ah that's just temporary they might not even know jesus our lives gotta be what's in order praise god so that's something i have to battle just a simple something as simple as that so sexual attraction is one of the biggest lust of the eyes right that's what david fell to the lust of the eyes caused him to commit adultery then murder jesus says to look in lust is the same as adultery property jesus said in the great supper parable that a man turns down can you imagine turning down an invitation to the wedding supper of the lamb so he can go he said i must first must needs go and see my recently purchased land in luke 14. he wanted to go look at his hills and valleys and mountains and say my look what i got and he turned down the marriage supper with christ just because he saw the land he saw the building he saw the business material possessions is another one remember uh aiken saw the babylonian garment the silver and the gold and it led to 36 israelis dying because they lost the next battle they tried to fight i think it was a.i 36 lusting after the eyes and stealing gold silver and babylonian garments led to the death of 36 men because he couldn't he didn't have tempers he couldn't control his desire just to look that's a really nice jacket and tie i think i'll steal those those are snake skin belt and i don't believe in killing snakes like that but they're more expensive oh that's a leather oh i'll steal that and it proved aiken didn't have the temperance that he should have had he had it at one point right he had it because they crossed over in the promised land but then he let it come back on he lost that temperance and so see that's a good example brother i want to show this one that's a good example sister naomi crossing over river jordan was like the baptism of the holy ghost right because egypt was justification wilderness sanctification river jordan baptist and holy ghost but see you we got to be real careful how we use that right because aiken had already crossed over into baptism holy ghost but god swallowed him up into the earth so we got to be careful how we use that right i don't think i don't think how could a holy ghost phil person today steal gold and treasures and money out of people's bank accounts can you imagine that or steal clothes can you imagine that so see we got to be very careful how we use our types don't we i have to be very careful remember financial prospects a lot of these are with money a lot the bible said he looked towards sodom i never set my timer did i okay let me set it now give me 10 more minutes i even got that reminder on my phone i forgot to look at it lot saw a sodom and he said it looked like the garden of eden so he pitched his tent towards sodom pretty soon he's mayor he's one of the mayors or judges of sodom sitting in the gates judging and then he lost almost everybody's family to the fire and brimstone almost everybody's family and then we know he led to incest with his daughters ah he should have stayed with abraham's seed praise god he should but the man said he forgot about the promised son amen he forgot about jesus's return amen balaam he was the unfaithful prophet and he greedily rejected god's perfect will uh to seek balak's lucrative offer and cause israel to stumble now let's go to the pride of life i'm almost done here well maybe a little bit pride of life now this is interesting now you know what pride of life means it means self-promotion self-will and self-praise so when someone is in the pride of life they want to be promoted they want to do what they want to do and they want to be praised by other people always be careful when someone compliments you always try to say something like well it's by god's grace that's what i do try not to accept we need to try not to accept praise i just said i always try to say this john 15 5 without him i can do nothing if there's anything good that came out of me it wasn't me it was christ because pride of life is i will like satan i will ascend i will exalt my throne i'll go above the stars i will do this i will do that so see pride of life now i have four examples here reputation is example of the pride of life we want a reputation remember tower of babel what do they want for the amen to make a name for themselves pride of life they said let's put brick and mortar let's build until they get to heaven like brother brooks said they they could have got there somehow i don't they would have crossed a mention somehow they were so smart but they wanted to make a name for themselves herod herod the ruler was smitten by the angel lord and worms ate him because he accepted praise as god rather than giving god the glory in acts 12 22-23 remember that they said oh herod's a god and so the bible said god smote him ange lord sworn him and the worms ate them all up because of the pride of life the next pride of life battle is with greatness the disciples were battling self-promotion arguing who's greater i'm the greater evangelist i've i'm a better preacher i i have more miracles i i no no me no arguing who's greater that's the pride of life king nebuchadnezzar had to wander with the beasts of the field for seven years with a beast mind because he believed it was his own power that established the babylonian kingdom praise god and i've got to be careful too amen if i think well because of me look at our church it's not because of me if there's anything good of the church it's because of god's grace i'm just doing it i just have to be faithful doing my part i just have to water praise god like i get home i just got to get out the hose every week and just let it water i just got a water that's all i do but god's the one who gives life to the believers amen he's the one that gives life i just work in water i just hold the host and turn on the host do my duty go turn off roll back up the hose i'm done like the bible said i'll go to sleep i'll wake up and they'll be sprung up because god is the one who makes us live and grow and move amen oh i'm so great because my babylonian kingdom i'm so great look at my church no there's none great but god even jesus wouldn't let them call them good right he said who you calling good there's only one good but god he's talking about his flesh the next pride of life area is strife remember we had up there in the corinths the corinth church had strife strife is election earring electioneering for your office or your promotion so it's like it's like politics vote for me give me money because i'm trying to be the next leader they're electioneering right they're trying to they're doing politics and korah and nathan were doing politics trying to become the real priest of god so moses said well god's going to show who it is let's get that rod out remember brother brooks in cambridge on that let's put that place in the holiest voice let's see whose rod brings forth in the prince of god amen let's see who god vindicates in the friends of the lord amen let's see whose life produces the real fruit of the holy spirit that's god's servant and then remember king uzziah he tried to become a priest the bible said he was a godly king he did everything right until the end of his life when he tried to become a priest in second chronicles 26 and the lord smote him with leprosy to the day that he died oh church i i i want to live by i want to remember that one i always remember that one in solomon i it doesn't matter what i've done for god it doesn't matter how good i've served god in the past i've got to make sure i keep serving god in other words i want god to crown my life with holiness not crying in disgrace i want to start strong i'm going to stay strong and i want to finish strong praise god amen i don't want to give up at the end and lose my temperance and then become fleshly and sinful and be crowned with disgrace and then the last one is murder now we don't you know cain murdered abel because of his pride of life but brother says and jesus says we murder people by being mad at them and damaging their character right and that's the pride of life see someone attacks somebody else they're accusing the brethren because they're trying to promote themselves or their church or their will or they're trying to make you think how spiritual they are that's why they attack other people all right three minutes i'll close with this yeah it works out good hebrews 1 9 can you put up there now i never saw this before until i was writing this book but both eve and jesus had through the threefold temptations jesus overcame while eve fell eve was tempted with the lust of the flesh because the tree was good for food see lust of the flesh food right she was tempted with the lust of the eyes because the tree was pleasant to the eyes and eve fell to the pride of life because the tree would make her wise i can be like god i will be like god and she fell in all three areas oh but thank god there came the woman's sea later the seat of the woman jesus christ born of a virgin amen and jesus came by and it was the greatest temptation ever on a man this wasn't just some other lust demon or this wasn't just a drunk demon or something like that this was satan himself the old serpent the old dragon himself satan himself and jesus was tired and hungry and thirsty after 40 days and in this weak state he still overcame because of this right here he still overcame because why he loved righteousness more and he hated iniquity amen he loved to obey god see you and i we will overcome satan every time if we love to obey more than we love to give into the flesh and remember to always be love that determines all your actions because faith works by love amen this proves it right here the reason jesus turned him down about the future kingdoms and the stone of bread and doing a miracle and trying to do all these the reason he turned him down to all three areas because he loved his father and he loved to make his father happy praise god love oh this is beautiful ah look at that iniquity is purposely transgressing you know it's wrong and yet you do it that's called iniquity and jesus had a choice i either do righteousness or i do iniquity which one did he love more he loved to obey more that's one thing satan can never do he can never love god amen he can never love the word amen but you and i love the word that's what separates us from satan and all the demons and all the lukewarm we love to obey god's word it's all based upon love let's stand to our feet jesus overcame by love love always overcomes now let me here's a real thought that struck me by amen i think you'll like it jesus said thou shalt not tempt the lord thy god in other words don't test god with miracles but god did say to test him with a couple of things ties and offerings amen hallelujah there's times you test god church not with miracles now you test him with your finances that's where you test him is that right he said prove me see if i won't pour open the gates right the the windows of heaven and pour out the blessing that's a fresh revelation that came to me when i was writing my there are times you test the lord he said prove me and see if i won't do it praise god oh i love the word don't you church ah the lesson is quoting and obeying the word defeats satan anytime anyplace anywhere and if you speak god's word love god's word stand upon god's word satan will leave us for a season and he'll never give you a test that you can't overcome you'll always have the ability to break through that and love righteousness and obey it instead of giving in to the flesh how many of you want to be a more spiritual christian i want preachers to come in like cam and brother brooks and simon and say this is a real spiritual church i want them to be able to say wow i gotta the lord gave me some deep things when i was studying last night because i you guys can't i mean you're beyond milk you could handle milk but you wanted something deeper than just milk that's what i want to see when guest preachers come in when i come to the pulpit i want to feel such a liberty that we can go deep in the deep things of god and discern right from wrong in our daily lives so we can grow to be more like christ rather than backslide into a lukewarm condition where there's no spiritual hunger anymore we're hungering more for the things of the world let's hunger and thirst after righteousness musicians if you'll come lord willing on sunday we'll look at the fruit of temperance did you know that there's a attribute of temperance and the statue of man but then there's a fruit of temperance it's just like faith faith is an attribute on the status perfect man but there's also a fruit of faith same thing with temperance in other words there's a very mature level of temperance that only holy ghost-filled saints experience that's what i want to experience i know it's going to be hard haven is going to be tough but if i'm faithful to the lord he'll help me to be able to bring my body into subjection instead of feeding my flesh so much i'll be able to feed my soul more that's what i love about you know i'm working outside more i'm trying to get a little tan here you know but i get to listen to sermons while i'm doing i put those headphones on i get to listen to sermons so it's all jesus that's like a two two three hours of sermon listening to the lord listening to his words singing his songs praising them that's one thing i love about working outside i just gotta make sure i don't get my eyes in the lust of the eyes not trying to make it you know fancy but just trying to keep all the land under control i'll say it like that keep it under control let's bow our heads for a moment church we only overcome by love satan will never love god he'll never love the word but that's where we're different we love the word we love to obey let's pray that god will help us to hate iniquity more and more and yet we'll grow in love for god will love righteousness more and more now as we pray i went through these areas i'm just going to read them real quick drunkenness overeating sexual sins drugs sexual attraction property material possessions financial prospects reputation greatness strife murder if you're battling one of those let's trust god tonight that you can speak the word the next time that temptation comes how many want to do that just speak the word
