stand here today because it's no strange with the camera angle but let's just open our Bibles here let's start with 2nd samuel 7 we like to start with david's covenant here so 2nd Samuel 7 verse 4 2nd Samuel 7 4 [Music] we're willing tonight maybe we'll get done with all the covenants we'll see how everything goes here 2nd Samuel 7 4 extra 3 verse 3 because verse 3 is one brother branham points out as important to show how God's prophets make mistakes and they're not infallible of course you know they're where they are infallible when they say thus saith the Lord but as far as their their human words and ideas and opinions those are not infallible let's start with verse 3 and Nathan said to the king go do all that is in thine heart for the Lord is with thee so we know David was desiring to build a house for the Lord and David said do Nathan said do all that's in your heart David let's read verse 4 and it came to pass that night that the word of the Lord came unto Nathan saying go and tell my servant David thus saith the Lord shalt thou build me in a house for me to dwell in whereas I have not dwelt in any house since the time that I brought up the children of Israel out of Egypt even in this day but I've walked in a tent and in the tabernacle in all the places where and I walked with all the children of Israel spake ayuh word with any of the tribes of Israel whom I commanded to feed my people Israel saying why build ye not me and a house of cedar now therefore so shalt thou say unto my servant David thus saith the Lord of hosts I took thee from the sheep coat from following the sheep to be ruler over my people my people over Israel what a way what a beautiful way for God to remind David where he brought him from he took him from the Sheep the Sheep coat and made him king over Israel praise God verse 9 and I was with thee whithersoever thou wentest and I've cut off all thine enemies out of thy sight and have made thee a great name like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth moreover I will appoint a place for my people Israel will plant them that they may dwell in the place of their own and move no more neither shall the children of wickedness afflict them any more as before time and as since the time that I commanded judges to be over my people Israel and have caused the to rest from all thine enemies also the Lord tells II that he will make thee and a house praise God so we'll pause right there just for a moment we're looking at the fifth covenant David's covenant and there's two main portions of Scripture this is the first one second samuel 7 for 217 and then after this we'll go to Luke chapter 1 verses 30 to 33 so it looks like here that we can see how David's covenant is getting set up and again one interesting thing about this covenant I don't I don't think it has a blood sacrifice connected to it as we'll see the other ones did you know Adam and Eve God gave coats of skins to Adam and Eve and then Noah's covenant Abraham's covenant and Moses his covenant all had animal sacrifice and blood but it seems this one doesn't have one now let's pick up reading there in 2nd Samuel 7 12 and we'll read down through 17 and when thy days be fulfilled and thou shalt sleep with thy father's I will set up thy seed after thee which shall proceed out of thy bowels and I will establish his kingdom he shall build an house for my name and I will establish the throne of his kingdom forever I will be his father and he shall be my son if he commits iniquity I will chasten him with the rod of men and with the stripes of the children of men but my mercy shall not depart away from him as I took it from Saul whom I put away before thee and thine house and thy kingdom shall be established forever before thee thy throne should be established forever according to all these words and according to all this vision so did Nathan speak unto David what a beautiful covenant such amazing promises but let's get a little bit of background here this covenant was given to David about 500 years after Moses covenant and God as we saw initiated this covenant through his prophet Nathan and just like Abraham's covenant here God is choosing the deal with one man and his offspring rather than making a worldwide covenant with everyone at the same time so we seek Abraham and David's covenants start with one man and they work out towards all the others and this is a beautiful pattern to see here in David's covenant God is building upon the Mosaic Covenant because Moses's government had the law and the priesthood so he starts off with law priesthood and now he builds a kingship or a kingdom a kingship for one king he's remember in the Old Testament they were God told Moses they would be a kingdom of priests remember that children have God called them out of Egypt and said you're gonna be a kingdom of priests unto me but now he says I'm gonna put one king above all of you so we know who that king was Jesus yeah praise the Lord he was the ultimate king we know David I'm sorry Solomon was the first king there and there was numerous kings have followed him but eventually the throne of David was cut down as we'll see here tonight through the scripture so God builds upon the law the hood and now he builds kingship or a single king over his people this represents the true king the Lord Jesus Christ who the Bible says one day he will rule all nations with the rod of iron praise God according to revelation 12 5 and that's in the Millennium praise God and it looks like even in the future home so we read our our text here out of 2nd Samuel 7 and you saw three things that God was going to establish through Solomon a throne a house and a kingdom a throne house and a kingdom and this was spoken to be forever now and I I'm sorry in Psalms 89 3 and 4 God specifically caused this a covenant so I'd like to read that to you I have made a covenant with my chosen I have sworn unto David my servant thy seed will I establish forever and build up their own to all generations say law so that scripture is important because it specifically calls this a covenant now I want to read a couple scriptures where everybody can clearly see how this covenant is conditional now it didn't sound like it right when we read 2nd Samuel 7 it sounded like it was just gonna be forever seemed like there would be no conditions but there were and that's why it's important to hear all of God's prophets because the more you hear God's prophets the more details God gives about his prophecies right just like with Jesus first coming he would bruise the head of the serpent and then later we come out of Abraham's lineage later he come out of David's lineage then he'd be born in Bethlehem with each prophet we got more and more detail more and more clues about where Christ would be born and so with other prophets we can see more details about David's covenant now it's interesting I went online and I found a couple websites where people actually believe that David's throne is England you know how they have kings and queens in England some people believe that's David's throne today and we disagree of course but they try to make some ancestor connections and they try to create some type of lineage where like Queen Elizabeth today would be the the lineage of David now of course we don't believe that and the reason they do that is because they read second Samuel 7 and they see how this throne is to continue forever and so they think well that must mean forever and but it takes understanding it takes reading the rest of the scripture to understand that God actually paused this covenant kind of like you did with the Daniel 70 weeks he paused Daniel 70 weeks and God will pick up this covenant but pick it back up during the Millennium so let's read a few scriptures and so you can see them let's start with 2nd chronicles 7 18 to 22 but actually where we just verses 19 and 20 second chronicles 7 19 and 20 okay so second chronicles 7 19 and 20 but if you turn away and forsake my statutes and my Commandments which I've set before you and shall go and serve other gods and worship them then will I pluck them up by the roots out of my land which I have given them in this house which I've sanctified for my name will I cast out of my sight and will make it to be a proverb and a byword among all nations did you catch that where he says and this house that you see that is what was God's promise to Solomon throne house Kingdom so here God says this house if you don't obey my statutes I'll pick up this house out of the land okay so Solomon sins and the many sins of his royal offspring eventually turned Israel away and God had to pluck up the nation and then scatter them abroad into other nations the last king of Israel of David seed was Zedekiah if you remember of the Book of Jeremiah and he was expelled from his throne around 587 BC 587 BC and since that moment there has not been a son of David ruling in Israel so he was the last son of David ruling now like I said some people believe Prince Charles and Queen Elizabeth is continuing that but I don't see that by the scripture because the Bible said he will pluck up the house now there's another there's a couple other scriptures that are really important to seeing this so god postponed the promises until jesus' second coming and it states it plainly in Ezekiel 21 so if you have your Bibles equal 21 verses 26 and 27 don't we have malachi read that one I would get now kind of case you may be reading that okay can you read okay Malachi Ezekiel 21 26 and 27 let's say Lord take off the crown you shouldn't have to just sing exalt him that is loan evasive meditite I will overturn overturn overturn it and it shall be no more until he come right it is I will give it to him amen so hopefully you could hear that but Malachi read how thus saith the Lord remove the diadem take off the crown so God speaking to Israel he's gonna take away that crown of David he said I'll overturn it shall be no more until what a beautiful word praise God until he's gonna remove David's throne from Israel until he come whose right it is so who has rights to the throne of David Jesus Christ that God said I will give it to my son Jesus Christ see God will never do away with David's house although they're on we'd say a probationary period or disciplinary period he'll never do away with them he'll never do away with Israel because of his other covenants his glorious promises praise God God promised to preserve the house of David because of his promise in 2nd chronicles 21 7 so I'll read that one and then acacia if you would go to Jeremiah 33 so I'm gonna read I'm going to read 2nd chronicles 21 7 the case you will get Jeremiah 33 verse 20 333 20 let me read this one 1st 2nd chronicles 21 7 howbeit the Lord would not destroy the house of David because of the Covenant praise God the agreement the league because of the covenant that he made with David and as he promised to give a light to him and to his sons forever praise God so there's two beautiful scriptures Lydia you go to Jeremiah 31 so KC's gonna read a beautiful scripture work these two portions are both in Jeremiah Jeremiah 33 and then Jeremiah chapter 31 and they both prove that God cannot ever forget Israel so acacia can you read Jeremiah 33 23 24 25 and 26 [Music] hey men not sure if you can hear that but God said I will cause the captivity of my people to return and I'll have mercy on them God said I will not cast away the seed of Jacob and of David my servant so and he even makes a promise based upon day and night he said thus saith the Lord if my covenant be not with day and night and I have not appointed the ordinance of heaven earth so in other words God is saying my covenant with Israel is as sure as this beautiful sky here it's sure this beautiful sunlight the daytime the nighttime as sure as day and night is sure so is my covenant with Israel and the house of David he said I will not cast him away forever but I will bring again their captivity that's jeremiah chapter 33 I asked Lydia to go to Jeremiah chapter 31 Lydia will read verses 31 to 34 and you can read them and then when you're ready Jeremiah 31:31 to 34 [Music] [Music] [Music] amen so God recognizes here in Jeremiah 31 that Israel's already broken the Covenant that he's given to them he says although I was a husband unto them so God has stayed with Israel despite the times they've broken his covenants and of course this is the new covenant which we'll get to in a few moments here but if you go to verse 35 are we that thus saith the Lord which giveth the Sun for a light by day and the ordinance of moon and of the stars for a light by night now stay with me o this beautiful which divided the sea when the waves thereof roar the Lord of Hosts is his name look at verse 36 this is beautiful if those ordinances depart from before me saith the Lord then the seed of Israel also shall cease from being a nation before me forever praise God the moon the Stars the light the day the darkness he said if those pass away then Israel will pass away but if they never pass away my promises with Israel will never pass away now look at verse 37 this one brother man mentions in the fifth seal because we even listen to that he said thus saith the Lord if heaven above can be measured who can measure the heavens science still can't do it and the foundation of the earth searched out beneath I will also cast off all the seed of Israel for all that they have done saith the Lord who can measure no man can measure the heights of the heavens or the depths of the earth praise God so God says since no man can measure that neither can anyone measure my love for my people Israel and the house of David beautiful praise God Alleluia beautiful promises all God's covenants are so so steadfast completely sure now let's look at a few more scriptures here let's go to Isaiah 9:6 and 7 maybe a case you can do Isaiah 9:6 and 7 and then Malachi have you get Luke 1:32 and 33 so let's look at what Isaiah says about the David or the Davidic covenant and then also what the angel Gabriel tells Mary about it because it has a deeper meaning obviously than what we said with some of these people trying to guess and try to hope that the seed of David still has a king somewhere but we read the scriptures how he's gonna take away the diadem so praise God beautiful beautiful promises we love we love this verse right for Christmas time wonderful counselor the babe should be born unto you born of a virgin but I specifically want to point out of the increase of his government and peace there shall be no end so that's why it seems like the Davidic covenant is actually an eternal covenant it's part of the eternal covenant as well because there will be no end to Jesus's reign as son of David on the throne of Israel now the angel Gabriel visits Mary and gives her more revelation about this the deeper meaning of the throne of David so Malachi can you read Luke 1 32 and 33 he shall be great and shall be called the son of the highest David and he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever and of his kingdom there shall be no man a man praise God of his kingdom there shall be no end who this son of David this babe that was to be born of Mary what a promise praise God so we can see that this Davidic covenant it's on pause right now but it's going to be renewed soon praise God in the Millennium and then from there it will have no end this covenant has a deeper meaning this kingship this kingship turns into an eternal kingship by the grace of the Lord now it's important to note I preached this numerous times but this kingdom was actually first offered to Saul but because Saul was disobedient it was given to David and the Bible says that in 1st Samuel 13 13 and Samuel said to Saul dah has done foolishly now has not kept the commandment of the LORD thy God which he commanded thee 4 now with the Lord have established the kingdom upon Israel forever alright what a promise that psalmist out on church I just want to say this god only knows the great blessings and rewards men and women lose due to their selfish disobedience it's so important for you and I just to learn how to obey to humble ourselves and just simply submit and not rebel against God's simple humble commands remember Saul just did it in a few in a few ways he just sacrificed right before allied you got there and then he didn't kill everything he should have destroyed everything that should apply to our lives we should cut out everything that hinders our walk with the we should live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God I want to read a quote real quick I mentioned it on Wednesday night from the church age book this is from the summer nian church age chapter four programs talking about a free existence of souls the RAM said is not the person that comes predestinated eternally from God it is the word or seed that is it way back there too far back for the human mind to grasp the eternal God with eternal thoughts thought and decreed Romans nine thirteen Jacob have I loved and Esau have I hated and neither was born and neither had done good or evil brother Ram gets back to writing for himself see it was the thought and then that thought became expressed and God bought back Jacob because Jacob alone was seed I like this watch because it deals with the Covenant next Jacob alone had the seed and that is why he had respect to the birthright and Covenant of God praise God there it is he said if you are true seed you will hear that word the spirit will baptize you into the body of Christ filling you and empowering you and you'll receive the word for your day and your age hallelujah so this sets apart the seed of Abraham and Jacob and Moses and as it goes down now to David the reason David respected this covenant was because he was a seed of God and so will be today as we now get closer to moving now to the New Covenant or the present covenant were under now those that are the true seed of God that were eternal in the thoughts of God they're the ones that will respect and honor and obey and keep God's covenant praise the Lord hallelujah so let's do that now now Lydia actually already read our our scriptures for the new covenant so God told Israel and to give you a new covenant he sent me to give you a new heart and I'm gonna write your write my words upon your heart praise God now this covenant does have the shedding of blood of course we know whose blood that is that is the Lord Jesus Christ praise God but before that let's see how when this new covenant is made the Old Covenant waxes old the Bible sent so I'll just read that Hebrews 813 so Hebrews 813 in that he saith a new covenant he hath made the first old now that which decayeth and waxeth old is ready to vanish away praise God and we looked at that this morning how many of the requirements from the the Old Covenant or the law are vanished away right for example the Levitical priesthood is vanished away from New Testament believers because we don't have to sacrifice animals physical animals anymore many of the civil laws as we looked at this morning like with men growing beards some of those no longer apply but the moral law the truce the moral laws that God gave us such as the Ten Commandments and abominations we can see scripturally by searching the New Testament we can see many of those still apply today and the Bible says that we through the spirit keep the righteousness of the law praise God that's in Romans chapter 8 we're not going to read that now so we see Church when we when we have the New Covenant as we're receiving the New Covenant it makes the old vanish away now we know what that can't mean we get rid of everything that Moses said right because we just read this morning in Ephesians chapter 6 where did Paul get his authority to tell the children to honor the parents he got it for Moses so we have to understand these scriptures by rightly dividing them and you know why God does that because he loves to hide himself from the wise and prudent prudent those people who think they can all figure it out but he reveals himself unto babes such as we learn so people will use Hebrews 813 and say we don't need the law we don't need the Old Testament and then they'll let women wear pants they let men wear skirts though the reject a lot of the scriptures from the Old Testament it's because they haven't rightly divided the Word of God so may God help us to always rightly divide the word of truth okay now acacia are you next or is Malachi next okay what's our vacation they should go to Luke 22 20 Hebrews 9 16 and 17 let's look at two more scriptures that talk about how this covenant is founded upon Jesus's blood it's dedicated and established through the blood of Christ so okay so when you're ready Luke 22 verse 20 he meant so Jesus specifically caused or caused the Lord's Supper the New Testament in my blood see he was just ready to shed his blood because that was the ninety got arrested the next day was gonna be his crucifixion so he's letting the the disciples know I'm gonna make a New Testament and it's gonna be in my blood now remember at this point they don't understand they're not even sure he's gonna resurrect the Bible said they didn't really understand it till after his resurrection so they were just missing it but you know God was gracious we all would have missed it it just went over their heads because it just wasn't the time for them to understand it because God reveals everything in this time and season so Lydia through Christ's death and his blood sacrifice and his resurrection the Covenant goes into effect and we see how it the Covenant can't go in effect until Christ dies because of Hebrews 9 16 and 17 so Lydia can you read that Braes god so here we see that the New Testament could not have any effect until after Christ died the Bible said Jesus destroyed death through death he had to go through the door of death as an innocent sacrifice in order to defeat death and so once Jesus died the the benefits of the Testament went into effect praise God we saw those we saw that inheritance begin getting poured out on the day of Pentecost praise God that's when they started getting poured out all the inheritance right we receive the inheritance of the Saints in light the scripture says that so just as a natural man or a natural son can't receive his father's inheritance doctors father passes away so it is with our New Covenant we can't receive the benefits in the inheritance until the testator died and so that shows how God and the son were one in the same praise God I just want to make again the point I don't know if you remember this but I was making the point on Wednesday how a lot of the covenants have animal sacrifices of course Jesus was not an animal although his nature was like a lamb and he was led by a dove but just as the other sacrifice or the other covenants had sacrifices that were torn so Jesus was torn the Bible said he was so torn that his bones stared at him they were so exposed and so it was with Noah Noah tore apart the sacrifices Moses tore about the sacrifices Abraham sacrifices were torn apart so much that God came as that fiery smoking furnace of the pillar of fire and came and his presence hovered right between those two sacrifices so we see that Jesus had to be opened up his body had to be opened up just like the other sacrifices had to be torn apart and so God uses another sacrifice here a blood sacrifice to confirm his covenant that he is going to keep his promise arch' glad he keeps his promise praise God and he backed it up by shedding blood they got and it was just not just any blood it was holy blood praise God so the pardoning of Jesus holy blood cannot ever be overemphasized while the other covenants had blood Adam and Eve had coats of skins Moses sprinkled the people with blood Abraham had sacrifice sight of sacrifices the nude the New Covenant blood completely abolished his sins and it it clears our guilty conscience okay and that's in Hebrews 10 1 to 5 the Bible said the Old Testament worshipers would make sacrifices but their conscience 'iz were still defiled they still felt guilty a church that should help us if we really confess our sins through the blood of Jesus Christ we shouldn't feel guilty anymore we should be able to say praise God God cast in the sea of forgetfulness I know I did wrong but he forgave me praise God that's what the power of Jesus blood is supposed to do under this new covenant it's supposed to purge our guilt guilty conscience so that we leave the church service or we leave our prayer closet or we leave wherever we confess our sin we leave there with a clear conscience that God has forgiven us praise God if there's any about your sins and if they still remain we just have to read Hebrews chapter 10 that's all you have to do because he settles it once and for all praise God and then Colossians 2:13 says it plainly Christ has forgiven you all trespasses not some but all this is why God had to keep sending covenants as we said Abraham's covenant was wonderful there was many blessings and Noah and all out all down Moses but none of them handled sin none of them abolished sin until the new covet the new covenant did away with all sins praise God because it's it's a blood was of a greater power hallelujah Jesus blood is the perfect remedy for sin and it's the last covenant that requires blood because it's the eternal covenant doesn't require blood the first edan covenant was bloodless and so is the eternal covenant the future home covenant so let's read a good scripture here Malachi you get Hebrews 13 verses 20 and 21 this is just a beautiful scripture if we ever battle you know what God's Spirit is doing in our lives you know we go through seasons of highs and lows go through mountaintops we go through valleys times you can everyone can tell God is moving doing great things but then you go through quiet seasons if we ever wonder about that we just have to turn to Hebrews 13 verses 20 and 21 because we see what the blood does for our daily works right so today you have the day off most you have the day off from work but tomorrow I got a work still at work from home but I still got to work but our daily works are taken care of by Christ's blood so Malachi Hebrews 13 20 and 21 he's the prop again from the dead our Lord Jesus that great Shepherd of the sheep through the blood of the everlasting covenant make you perfect in every good work to do his will we're giving you that we just won't easy to decide through Jesus Christ praise God now brother Branham pulls out this scripture he says notice it's the blood it's the blood of the everlasting covenant not the eternal right because we will not need blood in the New Jerusalem will we well we have to have a blood sacrifice we can say oh god I'm sorry no because we'll have new bodies death will be swallowed up in life praise God and are our greatest enemy who's our greatest enemy he'll be done away with is that the white throne judgement he'll be tossed in the lake of fire so you won't have a tempter anymore we'll have brand-new bodies that don't have sin nature so the new covenant is everlasting but not eternal because the Bible says the blood of the everlasting covenant church it will make us perfect in every good work to do his will so whether we're in a mountain top we see God doing great things signs miracles wonders or we're just in a valley we're still doing God's will because God takes us through mountains of valleys there's a time and season for everything and the blood is working in you and I that which is well pleasing in a sight so see the Covenant is gonna take care of you and I you and I should be so secure in the blood of Jesus Christ constantly confessing our sins trusting in the blood knowing that God has wiped away our sins because it's the blood or it's the Holy Spirit's life that is gonna daily help us to do what's well pleasing in God's sight praise God it'll lead us and guide us into all of God's perfect will all of his every good work right you'll go to work tomorrow you're stayed home you should do good works right we should do good things tomorrow right children chinnu evil works if the blood is with us in this covenant it will make us do good works right it will help us do good works because it's gonna make us do every good work to do God's will so see it's the perfect blood that makes our lives perfect perfect blood makes the worshiper perfect praise God just like job right is he Ana he had a perfect sacrifice for his dispensation his covenant in are a dispensation his covenant he had a perfect sacrifice God said he's perfect he met the requirements so you and I with a perfect blood it'll make the worshipers perfect because the Bible says he that his sacrifice sanctifies us he that was sanctified sanctifies us once and for all praise God so the sight of God were forgiven forever praise God amen now I want to read this in Hebrews 8:6 I'll just read it Jesus's blood is a better covenant established upon better promises praise God I hope you've seen it in our last three sermons on the Bible covenants each covenant got better and better didn't it each one got better and better and here this is an even better covenant than Moses's covenant this is the even better covenant than David's covenant this covenant is gonna make everything we do every work we do it'll make it work together to be well pleasing in the sight of God it's because the token because the token is not something outside like the rainbow is not even something under our clothes we'd say like the male circumcision it's not something like that we said it's not something outside is not something under it's something inside praise God inside the soul of the believer praise God now because it's based upon better promises there is a greater responsibility for this covenant member jesus said that he said there's there's greater punishments for those Pharisees and Sadducees who rejected his ministry then even for Sodom and Gomorrah remember that because a greater than Solomon is here so each covenant had greater and greater promises so much so that Jesus says it's gonna be worse off for the Pharisees and Sadducees and unbelievers who rejected him then even Sodom and Gomorrah now Hebrews 10:29 I read this will go for about five five or ten more minutes here let me set the timer Hebrews 10:29 may God help us to to rejoice in this new covenant look what it says that there's what scripture warns to those who don't take the covenant very seriously Hebrews 10:29 of how much sorer punishment suppose ye shall he be thought worthy who hath trodden under foot the Son of God and hath counted the blood of the Covenant wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace okay so people that disobey grace people that reject grace people that reject God's commands in the New Covenant are considering God's blood covenant and unholy thing it's not sacred it's not special they're saying you know alcohol is more special than God's covenant they're saying being married two or three times is more special than God's covenants what they're saying they're counting the blood of the Covenant and unholy thing it's not a special thing it's not a sacred thing to them and how sad that is but the Bible said how much more punishment will they get because it's a covenant with better promises so there's a greater responsibility to respond to the Covenant and receive it this covenant is so powerful God's spear is gonna cause men to go all around the world to preach this good news to every nation God won't let this this world end until every nation has heard the good news of this new covenant praise God that's Matthew 24:14 and this gospel of the kingdom shall be preached in all the world for a witness unto all nations and then shall the end come praise God and that's because God has appointed a day where he's gonna judge all men by Jesus Christ acts 17:31 because he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath ordained whereof he hath given assurance unto all men in that he hath raised him from the dead now look at that church Bible said God gave every man the assurance that he's going to judge them all by raising Christ from the dead so see the fact that these plants raised from the dead or they go down under they come back up that's a sign of the resurrection God said God says he's let every man know that he's raised Christ from the dead so all these things in nature speak of God raising his son from the dead and there'll be no excuses on that day according to acts 17:31 as we're finishing up here the token of this covenant is the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise God it's the seal of God in the soul of the believer so God marks the believers soul with Abraham he marked just the men's bodies with Noah he just marked the sky right temporarily every now and then you'd see it with Moses he just marked them one time by sprinkling them with blood but here a positive covenant he gives an indwelling token praise God he gives them a eternal sign in their souls praise God that's the power of this this token of the new covenant praise God and this has spoken three times it's called a seal three times we're familiar with Ephesians 4:30 but it's also Ephesians 1:13 and here's when we don't read too much Lydia can you get this one 2nd Corinthians 1:22 this is one we're not really maybe familiar with I'm not as familiar with it because we often just quote Ephesians 4:30 but 2nd Corinthians 1:22 causes a seal as well so that he whenever you're ready 2nd Corinthians 1:22 amen praise God so God has sealed us and given us the earnest which is a downpayment so church you and I if we have eternal life imagine that it's just a portion of eternal life there's a lot more praise God it's just a downpayment just a portion but there's so much more for us to enjoy by the grace of God amen all right so the life of the animal sacrifices all the way since Adam and Eve when they left the Garden of Eden could never come upon them but now the life of the sacrifice Jesus Christ can come upon you and I praise God remember this new covenant was first sent to Israel but when they rejected it the Bible said they were blinded and so it is today any person who chooses not to believe it spiritual blinders get put over their heart right Paul says what that veil over their heart is done away in Christ when they say I don't believe that and if all religions are the same a veil a blindness goes over their heart they don't feel what you and I feel for Christ and for Christian remember God promised he foreknew Israel's failure and he promised to have mercy on them but just like the story of Joseph in the Old Testament God was gonna blind the Brethren and through the blindness he was going to save the Gentiles right God saved the nation of Egypt through Joseph praise God and God promised to return to blinded Israel and give her another chance to receive the New Covenant and that will take place shortly after the rapture of the Gentile bride which we believe were a part of by the grace of the Lord in closing here revelation 4 revelation 14:1 2:5 says that Jesus Christ will stand with 144,000 guileless guiltless Jews on Mount Zion which from what I understand is the tallest mountain or the highest mountain in the city of Jerusalem which can be seen today he's gonna stand with them and they'll be reunited that's when Israel will receive this new covenant that we have right now this mountaintop experience is of course before that it's preceded by Jesus revealing his identity to Israel it will cause them to mourn in anguish upon realizing they crucified their Messiah and they'll go from house to house crying and weeping after they realized what they've done to their Messiah let's read that it's been a long time since we read that Zechariah 12:10 so Malachi can you get zechariah 12:10 I try to turn there as well before this wind picks up and blows my Bible some other place Zechariah 12:10 so we want to show this how God returns to Israel in the New Covenant right now they're blinded because they turned it down but after the rapture of the Gentile bride God will graph back in Israel give them another chance and that merciful and that's so gracious they turned it down so God cuts him off but then after he's done with the Gentiles he grafts him back in and gives him another chance a second chance to receive it zechariah zechariah Krays god so that's where a spirit of grace gets a pour poured upon them and they mourn in bitterness verse 11 in that day there should be a great mourning in Jerusalem as the morning of hey Dad remand in the valley of Megiddo verse 12 and the land shall mourn every family apart the family of the house of David apart and their wives apart the family of the house of Nathan apart and their wives apart the family of the house of Levi apart and their wives apart the family of shamea apart and their wives apart all the families that remain every family apart and their lives apart right so they're younger twelve tribes all party up but even have the brothers mourning in a separate place and the sisters verse 1 of chapter 13 in that day there shall be a fountain opened to the house of David and to the habitants of Jerusalem for sin and for uncleanness praise God what a beautiful promise so this is the new tusks new testament new come being brought back a second chance given to God's people because remember he said I won't forget you he said if you can measure the heavens then I'll forget he said but no man no man can measure the heavens praise God he said if day and night stops I'll forget Israel but day and night keep going don't they they're perpetual and just as God keeps these beautiful covenants out here so God will give Israel another chance at the new covenant praise God when's this when this happens they'll weep and they'll cry they'll repent and the Bible says the nation will be born in one day Isaiah 66 as a nation will be born in one day after they weep and mourn they'll be baptized with the Holy Ghost a church that ought to be a good lesson for us if we want to be born again we have to weep and cry and mourn over our sins don't we the RAM so you have to have a boohoo experience you got a boohoo it out you got to cry and be sorrowful for your sin and then God he'll baptize you with the Holy Ghost and fire praise God hallelujah last scripture Romans 11:26 and 27 Paul shares the scripture and shows that Israel all of Israel be saved all the predestinate of Israel all that all the Israel that God foreknew in his mind the 144,000 all of them shall be saved and so all Israel shall be saved as it is written there shall come out of Sion the deliverer and shall turn away ungodliness is my covenant unto them when I shall take away their sins so see the new covenant began at Jesus's death and resurrection right he had to pay the price with his blood then he had to raise from the dead and then it ends this new covenant probably ends at the white throne judgment because blood for forgiveness is no longer needed that's because death hell Satan have all been cast in the lake of fire sin is forever defeated praise God let's sing a little song here freeze gun let's just uh God God God God by his word our God our God ring he's alive and he's alive ah a pad great one go the blood of Jesus precious blood of Jesus and all the [Applause]
