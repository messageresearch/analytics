TRANSCRIPT
========================================
three i guess you can start the live stream perhaps you already have i'll have some slides to show ii timothy 3 1 2 timothy 3 1 2 timothy 3 1. i'm going to pick up right where i left off lord willing on sunday as far as with the writings of saint paul ii timothy 3 1. look at part 3 here of the power of the apostles doctrine let's read verse one together if we can on three one two three this know also that in the last days perilous times shall come go down to verse 10 because we'll be looking at these uh descriptions of the dangerous times we live in right now let's read verse 10 together on three one two three but thou hast fully known my doctrine manner of life purpose faith longsuffering charity patience amen may god has a blessing to read his word you may be seated tonight by god's grace so it's quite a list here uh if you go to verse 2 here's the list again i'm going to put it up here so you can see it it's quite a list paul describes our day the last days now this there can be an argument made that this means the last 2000 years and i would i would say amen to that but no doubt it does mean the last days as well our days and have we ever seen a scripture that is more true than this that the time we're living in is a time of self-love right covetous people they only want what they want boasters bragging on themselves proud blasphemers disobedient to parents unthankful unholy without natural affection you know it's so rare you find even children that uh obey their parents it's so rare we were at the dentist today and the dentist told me he said a lot of children come through here he said i i want you to know your children are different than them i said that's cause they hear me scream at them preaching three times a week i said i said i appreciate them three times a week but i said then mom their mom's at home i said i give mom all the credit uh but it you know it's the word of god as well but you know they can recognize there's a there's a strip there's a major difference between worldly children and christian children because they're obedient to parents and that's what we should strive for labor for obedience they're unthankful in this day they're unholy without natural affection truce breakers false accusers incontinent means lack of self-control as we looked at on sunday with temperance you know as we looked at the the evening service about taking care of your body uh showing self-control that's an anointing of the holy spirit to control what goes in your body what comes out of your mouth what you look at with your eyes that's an anointing of the holy spirit fierce despisers of those that are good traitors heady highminded lovers of pleasures more than lovers of god having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof so let it be known of course that many churches have a form of godliness it looks like reverence that's what the word godliness means piety and reverence but there's they're lacking the power to be reverent they're lacking the power to be really pious or aware of the holy spirit so the bible says turn away from them we have a right like we were talking earlier in the car we have a right to turn away from people that don't follow the word we have a right the bible said to avoid them we have a right to not let them into our homes so let's read that one while we got a second john since we're talking we had mentioned that in the car i was talking with austin elena you have a scriptural right if anyone does not bring the doctrine of jesus christ you do not let them in your home verse nine is just a it's been a tremendous revelation for me whosoever transgresseth and abideth not in the doctrine of christ hath not god see if someone can't learn the doctrine of christ they're not born again he that abideth in the doctrine of christ hath both the father and the son hallelujah verse 10 if there come any unto you and bring not this doctrine receive him not into your house neither bid him god's speed okay so if anyone comes and they don't preach our doctrine or bible doctrine do not let them in your house and then don't even say god speed you on your way god bless you on your way you don't even do that right because that's what the bible said neither have been in god's speech because verse 11 he that abideth him godspeed is partaker of his evil deeds so someone who preaches false doctrine or teaches false doctrine don't say god bless you or hope your ways are blessed because they're doing evil that's different if you don't know and it's different if they're a foolish virgin that's different too because remember jesus said anyone that's not against us is for us that's how you know if they're for you praise god then they're not against us praise god if they're for jesus right but if we know their doctrine is sly we know they're they're liars and we know they're deceivers and we know they're demon-possessed which anyone any man that would prophesy in the name of the lord and be wrong they'd be demon-possessed for sure because it's a lying spirit anyone that would do that you don't be you don't bid them godspeed and you don't let them in your house is that understood you guys see that ii john that's second john 1 9 10 and 11. so you have a right to protect your home you have a right to protect the atmosphere of the holy spirit praise god so paul clearly says in chapter 3 of ii timothy now getting back here but you've fully known my doctrine so clearly what what differentiates the lost world the the dangerous sinners from paul paul's doctrine the way he lived his manner of life his purpose in life his faith his longsuffering his charity and his patience so i just want to take this a little bit further so paul's doctrine from jesus produces the opposite conditions of the perilous times okay so if these are sinful perilous uh uh behaviors paul's doctrine will give us opposite okay so the blue is the opposite so instead of loving yourself what do you do you crucify the lust of your flesh paul's doctrine will produce the opposite of this right instead of you being covetousness always wanting more you'll be generous instead of bragging on yourself you'll brag on jesus instead of being proud the bible says you'll be poor in spirit well i'm weak without jesus i got to have jesus i'm nothing without jesus that's foreign spirit instead of blaspheming which is calling good works of the devil you'll worship jesus in truth praise god instead of being disobedient you'll obey your parents and all the children said amen instead of being unthankful you'll be thankful instead of being unholy you'll be holy which means separated you're separated from the things of the world unto god instead of having no natural affection you'll have natural affection you'll love the things of nature right you'll love nature you'll love babies right you'll love sunrises sunsets you'll love nursing mothers right you'll love pregnant white women you know you'll love fathers that love their children you'll love fatherhood motherhood you'll love grandparents that love kids you know you'll love everything beautiful that god described about life praise god but you know did you see those protests a few weeks ago in washington dc they were protesting the supreme court's decision about abortion and they had women on live tv take abortion pills and uh they're shouting cheering clapping for those abortions that are done right there right in the presence see they're cheering on death because they're under the spirit of the antichrist death right and then there was a woman preacher who came out this week said her abortion was the most beautiful thing that she's ever experienced with god such a lie such a lie because that's a murderous spirit right they don't have natural feelings for love for for real love right they lost that a long time ago see they're truce breakers they don't but we're promise keepers right we keep our promise we're not false accusers we're truthful witnesses we're not incontinent we're self-controlled we're not fierce we're tame and gentle hallelujah we don't despise those that are good we rejoice with the body of christ if we hear a good testimony we say praise the lord we don't get jealous of other churches if they have great testimonies we rejoice in their testimonies we're not traitors we're loyal we're not heady which means reckless we're stable watch people who are reckless and unstable right that's that's that's the perilous times that's the effect of the antichrist spirit we are not lovers of pleasures more lovers of god we crucify the pleasures of the world and we make god our pleasure worshiping god praying reading our bibles witnessing reading the bible listening to sermons these are all our greatest pleasures amen we don't rejoice in having a form of godliness we have true reverence for god and we don't quench the holy spirit we let the holy spirit flow praise god and yes we turn away from all those that manifest the perilous spirits of the antichrist we turn away from them praise god we would rather be a small but holy group praise god amen then a large uh richard increased with good uh brood of satan bruno vipers right we thought we'd rather be a small little group of of doves right than a bunch of snakes in the grass amen hallelujah praise god amen thank god that's what we're living for church we're living a separated life we're living uh to manifest the love of jesus christ to a world that's lost and dying amen they should be able to look at our lives and see the real love of god in our lives hallelujah now i mean i started making a video about this today i was going to preach this on sunday but i didn't get to it i was going to bring it in because the apostle talks about the last times right he's in the last last times perilous times will come fierce dangerous times to come well that's just one of at least 14 signs of the end times okay so bear with me i'd like to preach these a little bit and i wrote about this in chapter 12 of my book from last year so the first two conditions are that sinners are unaware of the rapture right they're living like they have they only have one life but we don't live that way if we don't experience good things in this life that's okay because we've definitely got a better life coming amen hallelujah i'm not worried about a mansion here i want to make sure i live in the mansion with jesus over there praise god i'm not going to labor for a mansion here because i know jesus is preparing one for me praise god but they're unaware of his coming but we are very aware we live every day aware that this could be the day jesus could come this could be the year where it all finishes up so i want to make sure this year is a year that i dedicate to christ hallelujah amen second they will have a mantra or they're saying will be peace and safety right whereas god is saying the opposite god is saying tribulation and death and wrath that's what god is thinking right so they're saying oh jesus ain't going to come and there's no such thing as jesus oh it's just a fairy tale there's no tribulation they say we need peace and we need safety now we're supposed to pray for peace the bible says that paul says that that we can spread the gospel but their peace and safety is a peace and safety without jesus christ that's the peace and safety they want or in other words a peace and safety where well jesus is the same as buddha right or jesus is the same as uh he's just a prophet just like muhammad right so they want a unity of religions but jesus never had that unity he said i am the way the truth and the life praise god now you remember this from a few weeks ago what was the name of this beast now i've heard they've taken it down since i don't know but i've just heard youtube videos but i don't know i don't live in new york but this was a statue they put up in december in new york at the headquarters of the united nations what's the name of this the guardian for what peace and security peace and safety right they have a beast for peace and safety now some people have said it's taken down i don't know it's a combination remember of two scriptures uh daniel chapter 7 and revelation 13. and it reminds us of the beast which is the antichrist spirit praise god it was in babylon the means of persians and the grecians and then rome so in other words this is a symbol of the evil roman antichrist spirit which is basically the antichrist spirit that's going to try to rule the world with a one world religion and one world government right so we see this is and the very name of it points to the mantra that the whole world is going to have peace and safety peace and safety is that right praise god now that's that's one that's the second one okay so let's get down to these 14 okay the third one is their scoffers mocking jesus's second coming now you see that especially with atheists right atheists love to mock christians they mock them about the bible they mock them about oh you believe a whale swallow jonah and you see that last year a whale smiled a man and spit him up did you see that that was awesome it was right off of maine the coast of maine a whale swallowed a man he lived but then he got vomited up see god is not gonna let there be any doubt praise god that the bible's true hallelujah he's gonna prove it to all the scoffers hallelujah they have to recognize it third the conditions of noah's time will be repeated that's in luke 17 jesus christ himself said as it was the days of noah so will it be in this day there'll be violence uh just uncontrolled violence lust-based marriages people get married not because they love the person's character but they just they love their physical appearance right but christians get married of course by character amen of course they want to be attracted to their spouse you know but the main thing is christian character because the only marriage the bible forbids is a christian with a non-christian amen as we said on sunday and then jesus also said they'll have continually evil thoughts all they can think about all they can tweet about all they can talk about is evil right only evil all the time uh sorry uh third fourth fifth also sodomite conditions will be repeated jesus said what was sodom sodom was feeling with males who were homosexual they were in gangs and they would uh use gang attacks to hurt men and i'm just kind of saying it very broadly that's how bad it was and nobody stopped them the government didn't stop them they just ruled they ruled the city with their sodomite acts and jesus said as it was the days of sodom so will be in this day oh you know what's interesting on that church today i was at uh target and i ran into a former student of mine and he said hey mr smith i'm like who is this he said i'm so-and-so i was in your third grade class and it was a boy but he's transitioning in a transgender to a woman and his badge said a girl's name instead of his name and and then he had like makeup on and girl's hair and i'm like oh how you doing he's like oh you were always one of my favorite teachers he said i was battling a lot of anger that year but you were really patient and kind with me and you listen to me and talk with me and he was he got suspended that year for giving a death threat in third grade to another kid but uh he said are you a principal now i said no i said i said i have a degree but i realize i don't want that to be if you're a principal that's your whole life i don't want all the stress and i said i want a life and i want to preach also as well and i just so happened i had one more card in my uh in my wall and i gave my card i said please text me email me and i can pray for you if you have any prayer requests please let me know and it has both my books on there front and back and then he had to get back to work but he was talking like a girl but he was a he's a man he's a man but i just thought what a divine uh what a divine meaning and uh i'm gonna pray for him let's pray i'm gonna pray for him at the closest service i actually forgot to write his his name down there now church if you told me when he was in third grade that he returned to a woman i said you're crazy there had been no such thing without just well that was a 2009 because that's when obama became president i remember that year distinctly if you would have told me that all those uh you know when i was 12 11 12 13 years ago i said no way there's no way that would ever happen in america but see we're seeing these we're seeing these conditions here it is we're seeing these conditions manifest right but our power of prayer is is greater than the sins of the world it all depends on god's predestination praise god but see how you see that church see how no matter the littlest kindness you do people remember it that was 13 years ago he still remembers what i teach and i could i couldn't recognize him right i didn't go see him he come saw me so see god god is using you because i said like this god is using you more than you know praise god and people are going to come up and say you know that's what brother man says in heaven people are going to come up and say oh thank you for living such a godly life you are a witness here there and church in other words your influence is going to impact more than what you think praise god so just keep living for jesus praise god amen hallelujah i was just encouraged by that so be encouraged church that god will have give you divine meetings praise god we never know what's going to happen like someday somebody might walk into a burger king and they're going to come get saved because that's how austin got saved coming to a burger king and benjamin and come to church and baptize him in the name of the lord jesus praise god you never know so you always be ready praise god now two three four five the sixth one evil men and seducers will grow even more evil with greater deceptions haven't we seen that preachers get more sly they're closer to the truth but yet they're so far away so deceptions get greater so we got to have greater discernment praise god we have to be able to rightly divide the word of truth even more by the grace of god we've got to say god help me in a growing judgment help me to care about false doctrine praise god help me to care so i can discern good from evil amen that's real mature christianity when you can tell is this good or is this evil now you become a mature believer church we don't want to be babies praise god we don't want to we don't want to be baby christians sitting in a pew just oh nurse me mama or father nurse me heavenly father give me a bottle no we want we want real strong meat praise god we want steak and chicken for a meal praise god spiritually speaking praise god we don't want to milk diet our whole lives we want to grow up we don't want to be babies we want to be mature we want god to be able to trust us with real authority praise god amen i had a man email me this week and said pray for me that god will give me more demonstration in my life i said it's going to take more sacrifice you better be praying ready to be sacrifice your time sacrifice your energy if god's gonna use anybody it's somebody who's fully surrendered praise god someone who's sincere about the gospel someone who wants to grow up and be a real mature believer praise god amen so it's two three four five six i always lose count here seven many churches will commit a great falling waste of seven eight nine ten okay that's uh many churches will fall away sinners can't fall away from god only chur people that know the word and heard the word only they can fall away remember jesus said there's that second kind of ground on the stony ground he said they believe for a while but then they fall away in times of persecution that's what we have today many message churches falling away from the message when the time of persecution or the time of accusation comes praise god eight few people have genuine faith expressed through regular prayer now this is where we really need to pick up our lives right right that's where we all we all need to pick up our life here jesus said we're coming to a time when he said will i find faith on the earth when i return and the context is a woman who's praying and knocking saying god open the door of revelation to me god answer my prayer we can't give up when god doesn't answer we can't give up after a week you can't give up after a year you girls you can't you know now you can't give up after five years amen i didn't hear you praise god you don't give up praise god you keep praying you keep asking you stay faithful because you know god is faithful amen now we've seen in 2020 jesus said pestilence is in earthquakes and wars will increase as sorrows of the tribulation okay or sorrows before the tribulation rather so now we know chrono coronavirus swine flu and now do you see some of these states they're starting to lose uh their their mandates well i imagine a few years or maybe next year they're going to send another man-made flu around right they'll probably do that again maybe a little more serious but don't but don't fret the bible never tells us to worry the bible says be anxious for nothing praise god for nothing don't be anxious for anything just the bible says watch and pray cast all your burns on the lord because he cares for you amen hallelujah so now we're we should be strong soldiers now we should know okay pestilences are going to come there's going to be more flus that are going to come there's going to be more earthquakes there's going to be more rumors of wars that's why we're not shaking i told somebody i'm not shaking about russia and ukraine and u.s we're not shaking about that are we concerned yes should we pray yes but that doesn't shake us because that's exactly what jesus said wars and rumors of wars we should expect that and we should pray for peace we shouldn't be shaken by every little thing we should be solid same believers where we can't get shaken but we're standing on the rock of ages where we have a firm foundation satan can't move us we know where we stand amen ten here's where now here's where we're getting into our text right the tenth sign is what we read for our text they'll love themselves more than god right they won't have natural affection all these things we read this okay that's 10th so 11th the new testament gospel will have been preached to all the world now satan thought he used coronavirus to stop the preachers but god's going to find a way to do it anyway we went to voice of god years ago and they said there's many more languages that need the message in their language if that's the case and there's many nations and languages that haven't heard the real preaching but the bible says the gospel has to be preached to all the world and i'm sorry oh i'm not sorry i'm not sorry to say it but a tape preaching is not real preaching real preachers have feet the bible said to go preach the gospel praise god hallelujah so we need to pray that god as we and we've been praying this austin we've been lena we've been praying this that god will open up the traveling restrictions so uh evangelists and missionaries can go back out and and win souls for the kingdom of god like simon i think he's made five trips to thailand trying to start churches he almost had one started but then the enemy come in and and uh kind of caused the pastor to leave the message but he almost had one by god's grace we were rejoicing but then the man fell away because he must have loved the world more than he loved the things of god but see church every nation uh will have the gospel preached to them that's another sign we're looking for so we hear things from missionaries like oh did you hear that brother austin the missionary said oh yeah ty ev everybody in thailand's heard the word right oh everybody's in china has heard the word it seems like the gospel it seems like the whole world's heard the gospel well then we'll know we're getting closer or maybe it's through the internet you know maybe it's internet though he'll pr they'll hear preaching through the internet okay here's the last ones here here's uh 14 13 12. i'm going to look at this one here a little bit here another way we'll know the rapture is coming is when we see the false churches uniting with united states politicians to create new laws to stop our church and churches like us that's how we'll know we're getting really close because that's what revelation uh 13 16 says he's going to cause all to take a mark in other words he's going to force he's going to lock down everybody right they're going to lock down their money they're going to lock down everything he's gonna cause all to try to worship the beast okay that's call and then they're gonna have to unite in order for those churches to stay open they're gonna have to unite in an ecumenical move church this is apostolic doctrine this is doctrine from the apostle paul this is important praise god amen these are the signs that he's coming praise god aren't you glad you can see the signs hallelujah amen psalm 27 5 says in the time of trouble he shall hide me in his pavilion praise god god's going to hide us in the times of trouble from the wrath of god and revelation 3 10 says i'm going to keep them from the our temptation that'll come upon the whole world okay the 13th sign is israelis will be physically returning to live in the holy land i've seen numerous articles about this over the last 10 or 15 years and they're going to seek to rebuild a temple revelation 11 says it they have to rebuild a temple we don't know if the temple is going to be before the rapture or after we don't know but it is a sign of israel returning and them wanting to rebuild the temple and 14th now there could be more church there could be 15 there could be 20 there could be 30 signs that that were at the end time but i just made a short quick list to put in the book regular churches will be in a laodicean lukewarm condition there will be more concern with riches and goods having no more need of truth and unwilling to repent church you you and i got to get in the habit of saying lord i'm coming here for more word tonight i'm coming here to become a better christian praise god ah lord feed me with something that will inspire me praise god give me something that's fresh from the throne of god amen how many want something fresh from the throne of god amen that should be our desire now i believe we're still waiting here's the checks at the bottom i believe we're still waiting for the fourth vision to come to pass now some people think we're already here waiting for the seventh i personally believe we're still waiting for the fourth because i was looking up driverless cars today uh and the in the vision brother branham said uh they had no steering wheel and they were pla and a family was playing some sort of game to amuse themselves okay it was a plastic car a bubble topped car that was running down beautiful highways under remote control so i uh so i'm sorry i should have showed the quote i didn't show the quote so this is this is the fourth vision brother branham had okay so it's a vision of plastic bubble top car remote control a family was seated in the car and they're playing some sort of a game to amuse themselves i was driving down the road today and it was pretty bumpy it's going to be pretty hard to play a game in a bumpy car as ours yes so i i personally think this vision is not yet fulfilled i personally think we need better highways and the highways got to be connected to the cars but of course many people disagree with me but that's fine i still believe uh that one's not fulfilled because the vision showed this and we haven't seen it remember church these three were so plain nobody could deny them brother brown had these visions they were so plain nobody could deny fascism right nobody could deny mussolini uh hitler and stalin nobody could deny that but see we have some questions here where it's not the reality is not lining up to the vision right just like here brother branham said let's look at the fifth vision the fifth vision uh showed women they cut their hair we see that now he says but they went into a state of undress until the last picture i saw was a woman naked except for a little fig leaf type apron on so brother adam said it's got to get to a spot where the whole world becomes a state of undress and the last one is a woman who only has a little fig leaf apron on austin i don't know i feel like we could be on on woman rising power because this this this came true like last year like the year before there's a thing called only fans now like every single woman i've ever met has the only fans is basically where you just post pornography of themselves and men buy it like like every i say like 70 of women that you meet out in the world has you probably why don't you have an only parent to get that money like that's what they say everything is crazy and then then he says something about women rising to power right yeah that's the next one yeah now that part though didn't get it in the division here but yeah he says in other quotes the day kamala harris became the vice president she was wearing her butt so that there's talks about joe biden stepping down and commodity coming to president right right that happens because you know he's mentally incapable right now oh sure sure so like if he steps down and she becomes president and she was wearing purple yeah that's and brother a lot of preachers think that right but when i look at the visions like i said when i look at those i mean it's totally undeniable the words of the vision every literal word detail came to pass so yeah some people believe that some preachers believe yeah they believe like it's past it's overdue no i don't believe that because i believe i believe the rap should be right on time i don't believe it's going to be past due i believe it's going to be right on time because god's still saving souls and there are nations that haven't heard the word so yeah at the when i made this video today i said i could be wrong on it i could be wrong so i always want to be humble like that i could be wrong but here's why i you know with the fifth one um i just really feel like you know this last part here we haven't seen that now i haven't seen it uh it's got to be a state of undress the whole world will be in a state of undress okay so that's why that one i'm a little hesitant on now the sixth one i made a video about this one brother uh this vision look i know first of all i don't think kamala harris is beautiful a lot of men don't like it's split like 50 50. she held the people in a complete power biden and harris do not have complete power the supreme court have shot down almost every illegal thing that they've done so the vision showed complete power to a woman brother bram said i believe it was the catholic church though i knew it could possibly be a vision of some woman rising great power due to a popular vote so the nation hasn't bowed to kamala i haven't so you don't have complete power i don't think she's beautiful um i believe it's the roman catholic church but i could be wrong so i'm leaving that open all the time believe that but remember those first three were absolutely precisely fulfilled to the letter so that's why you know i'm just waiting on that okay and then consider what all with with those 14 other signs like all these nations still need to hear the word of god that's why i believe kind of where we're at right now so yeah but keep your convictions about you that's what you want to do brother ram said i don't want people that don't have their own convictions he said we'd just be a bunch of pushovers he said so don't be a pushover he said i respect somebody that differs with me yeah and like i said i could be wrong but yeah that's okay the seventh one i saw the most terrible explosion i turned and saw nothing in america but debris craters and smoke all over so see i believe the first three were so precise that the last four must be equally precise and here's another reason the preachers that i know that say you know we're waiting only for the last one they are really children in their doctrine like they believe god wants to heal all the time and if you don't get healed it's your fault and to me that's that's just wrong and they don't some of them don't believe in fasting some of them don't believe in healthy living i mean it's so sad the way people uh stand or the way preachers act so that's why if i look at all these details you know i put them on a scale spiritually and i pray i think all these things and i say well i don't think they're fulfilled and and now but let's say time goes on let's say time goes on and we do get beautiful highways that are remote control with magnets and everything and then who's right and who's wrong they're wrong and i'm right but i don't mind if i'm wrong i mean if the lord comes i'm ready because i got the holy ghost i got the holy ghost god i'm ready to go praise god but for my few years or my 20-some years of being in the message i've seen most people guess and they're trying to be prophets guessing the coming lord but then they look foolish when it doesn't come to pass i don't know bro i couldn't i could probably tell i could probably tell you five preachers maybe 10 that have said this they thought this was year of the coming and every year it comes and goes and they just they get people's hopes up right it's a false hope okay and they get them focused on other things rather than the gospel rather than living holy and understanding more about the word of god all right just trying to get them to be fearful about the coming lord rather than loving the coming of the lord so i'm going to be so in love with jesus that no matter what happens i'm ready to go because i'm i'm i'm i'm in love with him i'm not predicting or anything like that i'm just so in love with him he's all my focus and i'm ready to go when he calls praise god i don't want to get people guessing and things like that so it's just to me that's that's i guess i'm saying brother that's hurt that's hurt me over the years when i've seen people i've respected make guesses and i know they're not living right i know they're not really growing and understanding you know of the of the message okay so i hope that's a so here's where brother man says i believe according to revelation 13 16 that the bride will have to stop preaching for the beast is demanding the mark in the hand or the forehead if permission to preach be granted domination or sorry denominations will take the mark or be forced to quit preaching then the lamb will come for his bride and judge the great harlot so that's why i believe we're going to have to have a time of squeeze where they're going to for they're going to close our doors any church we're already registered with green ohio see that thing i got hanging out in there in the fellowship we're already registered they know we're a church i don't know if they know what we believe but we're registered okay brother madam said that only the very elect will not be fooled the temptation will come as follows the ecumenical move that was started on what seems like such a beautiful and blessed principle fulfilling christ's prayer that we all might be one becomes so strong politically that she bears pressure upon the government to cause all to join with her either directly or through adherence to principles enacted the law so that no people will be recognized as actual churches unless under direct or indirect domination of this council little groups will lose charters privileges etc until they lose all property and spiritual rights with the people okay so that's a little review is that review okay i just want to review that real quick i want to show you that there's at least 14 signs that were that were closer to the coming of the lord but i'll say like this brother just like brother brahm said he said it may be a hundred years he said it may be tomorrow right all these things could happen like that just like jesus's crucifixion they all happen within a matter of a few days right as soon as he was arrested he was put on trial that fulfills the passover he was a passover lamb and friday saturday sunday my goodness uh 50 or 60 prophecies all fulfilled in the matter of three days that's why we got to be ready all the time whether it's church day or not we've got to be seeking god's faith we face we've got to be ready for us coming we must watch and pray amen amen now go to back to second timothy 3 praise god second timothy 3. now paul said in verse 10 we read verse 10 right what was the difference between the the the perilous people and paul his doctrine his manner of life now go down to verse 14. now verse 13 is where he prophesied evil men would get worse and worse look at verse 14. but continue in the things that which thou hast learned and has been assured of knowing of whom thou hast learn them see continue in the doctrine right and that from a child thou hast known the holy scriptures which are able to make the wise and the salvation through faith which is in christ jesus so church don't ever stop reading your bible read your bible every day and the church said what makes you wise to be saved what's going to make you wise to escape the tribulation the word of god the holy scriptures amen and like i said you can read in the old testament about ruth you can read about esther and that can give you encouragement and that will help you to be ready for the rapture praise god all these are beautiful types speaking of our day praise god it's a beautiful beautiful type verse 16. all scripture is given by inspiration of god and is profitable for what for doctrine all scripture can be used for teaching for reproof for correction for instruction and righteousness that the man of god may be perfect thoroughly furnished unto all good works praise god how many want to go tomorrow and do good works for god you know what's going to help you the word of god is amen the holy scriptures are going to help you and it doesn't matter which scripture it is amen i could preach out of nahum tonight praise god i could preach out a song of solomon and that should prepare you to do good works tomorrow amen because all scripture is profitable for good works and also for salvation amen now go to chapter four second timothy chapter four verse one i charge you therefore this is his last letter before he was killed and his head cut off i charge you i give you a command before god and the lord jesus christ he shall judge the quick and the dead and his appearing in his kingdom preach the word why did he say read my epistles right because god loves real preachers preach the word be instant in season out of season reprove rebuke exhort with all longsuffering and what doctrine so correct the people rebuke the people right help the people strengthen the people be long-suffering suffer with the people and give them sound doctrine for the time will come in verse 3 when they will not endure they won't bear sound doctrine church is everybody catching all the doctrine these last two chapters doctrine doctrine doctrine doctrine doctrine it's all through it what is going to separate the true from the false it's their sound apostles doctrine praise god doctrine is going to make your home holy praise god amen doctrine is going to make you do good works tomorrow praise god doctrine's going to make you save amen doctrine is going to help you go in the rapture praise god doctrine is what separates you doctrine is going to lead you to the right church hallelujah amen because the false churches have false teachers that don't preach sound doctrine but after their own lust shall they heap to themselves teachers having itching ears and they shall turn away their ears from the truth and shall and be turned unto fables so tell them stories lies verse 5 but watch thou in all things in endure afflictions do the work of the evangelists make full proof of thy ministry okay so the scripture endure they will not sustain sound doctrine so that's how you know you're in a false church right or a church that's uh led by the devil they will not keep up sound teaching so in other words they'll compromise on homosexuality right like we've seen last few years or they'll compromise on the importance of divine healing right or their compromise on what it means to have the holy ghost like churches they say if you believe brother bran was a prophet you have the holy ghost that's a lie that's a church that won't endure sound doctrine because the bible doesn't say that you could believe in peter all you want but just believing in peter don't give you the holy ghost right jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever praise god on the day of pentecost you couldn't be filled with the holy ghost bible even peter was a prophet you had to meet jesus christ you had to repent and be baptized and you shall be filled with the holy ghost praise god so never accept a false doctrine never ex never accept a false gospel our gospel should be pure bible pure truth pure holy ghost and pure revelation of the word of god amen hallelujah our church must sustain we must hold up sound doctrine because many churches won't and we've got to be the example we have to be an example church although small we have to be an example church and what the brothers say the brother said in that email we're a city on a hill that can't be hidden or even our little tiny church so much so that a man in england can get online and say i noticed something different about your church compared to other churches so it's not in the number it's in the quality of the holy spirit amen hallelujah like i told that man the other day we had a sister visit her church has 300 people in it and she never she doesn't feel the love of god she comes to our church where there's 30 or 20 and she feels the love of god so where is the holy spirit the holy spirit is where people are sincere and they're growing as christians and they want more love of god and they want sound doctrine and their preachers and their pastor bears and upholds and endures sound doctrine praise god amen and church i know the church that that woman's from and they don't have a lot of strong doctrine like they're the church i was telling you they believe a baby can get the baptism of the holy ghost in its womb like john the baptist but they're so they're so unsound in doctrine see they're just unsound there's many other examples i forget now i used to know more of them but i'm not in touch with that church anymore but that's just one of them they don't have the understanding to get the holy ghost you got to repent first just like peter said and let me remind my teenagers let me talk to you before after the service okay because there's something about that we need to talk about okay yeah this week we need to talk about this week okay all right so everybody see that by god's grace so what does he tell what's his last words to a preacher preach the word preach sound doctrine don't compromise because the time is going to come where people will not be able to be taught how to live a godly life now church think about that what could the holy spirit teach you tonight that you need to learn how to do now don't raise your hands but how many say have a better prayer life don't raise your hands i'm going to say love your enemies you have to raise your hand see if we can start naming some things that we can learn from the holy spirit tonight how about fasting you have to raise your hand right how about overcoming evil with good how about how about answering a harsh word with a soft tone how about having a good thought life and not not uh fearing and not worrying and not being anxious and living stress-free praise god we have to raise our hands right but see we can all learn how to be more like christ how about learn how to use our gifts better whether it's word of wisdom or knowledge or miracles or signs or wonders or tongues of interpretation or faith who couldn't learn a better operation of the holy spirit in their lives i think we should all say amen to that don't you we can all learn something but we got to come to church seeking something to learn we got to come with a learner's attitude right as we looked at a few uh i think last week by god's grace so see our church must endure we must bear with me we must sustain we must encourage sound doctrine and we must we must live what we hear preached praise god like i give that example of austin you know i preached on suffering he went home with a headache he said thank you lord i can suffer he learned that from the sermon and then god healed him of that praise god see that that's what all of us have to do we have to take what we hear and go apply it to our lives oh yeah like uh i got an email this week a sister is reading my book somewhere she's on chapter 10 already can you imagine that that's the furthest i've heard somebody go with the chapter that's a lot of pages that's like 600 pages and she said i read your chapter 10 on the mr iniquity and she said all those scriptures were on my mind i went somewhere in public and a man just started talking to me about how i dress i was dressed holy and she said i got to witness to him about the mystery of iniquity because it was fresh on my mind today and she said i invited him to church hopefully he'll want to talk more about the word he didn't know the message she said hopefully he'll want to know more about the message isn't that awesome so church whenever you're seeking god trying to grow god will use that out in your life somewhere but but we got to be willing to grow praise god we've got to be willing and and desiring more of god reading and praying and staying in tune with the holy spirit praise god i have another testimony another brother um he's an older brother he's got cancer but he he read part of my book as well and he went out and uh he said where can i get re-baptized he lives in connecticut and guess what i got a good friend in connecticut brother craig booer he said can i is there a church nearby and craig's church is an hour and a half from him and he went to craig's church last sunday and got baptized in the name of lord jesus christ from reading my book so see god knows how to do it church any effort we have any any anything we do for god any work is not in vain in the lord god is long-suffering he's still trying to find people that want to be saved praise god he's still trying to find people that want to be baptized the bible said the holy spirit is circling the earth his eyes are going to and fro trying to make himself powerful on the behalf of those that love god amen praise god so see we must have long suffering how many can suffer a little longer can you suffer another year if the lord doesn't come can you do another five years another 10 years where we all got gray hair can we can we handle that can we suffer that long can we suffer with one another that long i i know we can and the beautiful part is we'll see many testimonies along the way praise god like we've seen brother ram said he saw a vision and the holy spirit said when the vision leaves you read 2nd timothy 4. don't forget 2nd timothy 4. when the vision left me standing right there on 7th street a 19 year old boy the voice of god in the room said ii timothy 4 that's exactly what it turned out to be the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine brother branham was sent to help us have sound doctrine look what he says people want something the pentecostals want something that can pat them on the back see they just want to come to church and everybody like them and let them live there it is they want to live the way they want to church if you're not living right i'm here to rebuke you tonight by the holy spirit right just like i want to be rebuked when i'm not living right that's what the bible said rebuke correct exhort with all longsuffering and doctrine amen hallelujah because we all need correction at times church we all need it right you can't read paul's letters and not see that doctrine was essential for the believer to do a work for god how many are doing work for god it's essential to have the doctrine the teaching of the word of god if you're going to do any works for god amen he said here's what they want to do they want to play the piano 40 beats per second that's funny what's the maximum you can get malachi like eight is there no limit i guess with god all things are possible right and he says all the pentecostals want to do is real fast beat and jump up and down and dance about women do that way and the men the same way but live in sin see the presbyterian methodist lutheran baptist there's many sincere person all those organizations that's exactly right but that system has gotten them so bound up to they think as long as they belong to the church their names upon the books and their heaven bound your name on a book here on earth don't mean nothing to god amen it doesn't mean anything that you and i come to church here that doesn't mean anything because we've all known people that came here and fell away right what means what makes the more difference is that jesus christ lives inside your soul praise god that makes a difference and then you come here and then you're a channel you're a vessel that god can use like last week when god used naomi and beatrice so well for your your mom wasn't that powerful that was glorious you never know right that's how it is you never know when you're going to be called upon by god to do something for god that's a great example being ready to serve the lord did you know i was going to call upon you to pray i didn't either but when the service closed your text came to my mind and said your text said we all need to gather jose and the brothers and pray that text came into my mind like a picture i said well let me call up who's here if anybody can pray i said it's those women back there isn't that true yeah that's true the holy spirit brought that back to me i didn't have it in my nose you can look at the paper i didn't have it on there the holy spirit did that see because the holy spirit is interested in using us if we're willing to be used amen he said your name has got to be written in the lives book of life by the blood of jesus christ and know that your sins are forgiven but they want the pentecostals want that kind that's the kind of pastors they want they don't want nothing else and when god in the last days has shook every divine gift that's recommended the bible every gift that jesus christ promised every gift every sign every end time sign everything that was promised in the bible as far as i can see myself has already been shook before the nation and she plunges on toward hell as hard as she can go tell them they'll run on anyhow in other words brother ram saying ii timothy 4 is fulfilled they don't want sound doctrine they want to uh they want to dance in the church and then live any way they want the rest of the week but paul but paul told timothy don't you settle for that you preach the word amen and be ready because they are going to leave you amen the world is going to leave you and pretty soon you're just going to be left with saints hallelujah amen pretty soon you're just going to be left with sheep hallelujah or doves the people that really love god i feel like that's what we've got here praise god amen i really believe that i wouldn't say that if i didn't believe that because there was time a few years ago i knew we didn't have all saints here and i couldn't say it but i didn't want to say it i guess i could have said it but i really believe that everybody that is a faithful tithe pair here and coming to church i believe they're real children of god amen now i got about five or ten minutes so here let me try to find a place to close let's go to titus yeah let's try to finish in titus here it's right after ii timothy titus chapter 1 verses 8 and 9. this is paul writing a letter to a pastor named titus now verse 8 says he said now this is a bishop a bishop means an overseer this also means a pastor so a bishop verse 8 must be a lover of hospitality a lover of good men sober just holy temperant verse 9 a pastor must hold fast the faithful word as he hath been taught that he may be able by signs wonders and miracles did i read that right no what do you say a pastor does what by able by what sound doctrine both to exhort and to convince the gangsters hallelujah praise god huh how you gonna are gonna overcome all the gainsayers and the critics of the message how you can do it by sound bible doctrine that's what i found church the teaching brother ram gave us it actually rebukes all the people that have left the message and if they're watching they're spying on me come talk to me don't run on somebody else come talk to me please if you have any courage in your heart at all come talk to me if i offend you i don't i just don't think i said anything wrong see it's the doctrine that's what i found see how they're attacking they're attacking brother ram's character most of the time or his his tendency to forget his tendency to exaggerate they're attacking uh uh sometimes you know uh he he's he maybe wouldn't live all the way that he preached because he was human he made mistakes but church the majority of their criticisms are not about the doctrine the majority are just about his human mistakes and of course the main ones are prophecy they don't understand prophecy but the more i read the bible the more i see uh how brother branham was a true prophet and i'm going to preach more on that soon my god's grace because i've been studying on that as well so but how are you going to uh how is a preacher filled with the holy ghost going to keep us standing he's going to use sound doctrine to convince the church that the bible's right and the gangsters are wrong they're liars turn away from them don't believe them but you believe sound bible truth because jesus says thy word is truth amen hallelujah in other words church having the truth is enough even if we never see another miracle the miracle of sound doctrine would be enough praise god and that's what abraham told the rich man in hell the rich man said send my or send lazarus back to my brothers and that they'll see them rise from the dead and they'll be saved and abras abraham said nonsense they've got moses and the law they've got the teaching they've got the sound doctrine amen if they won't believe the doctrine they won't believe the miracles amen hallelujah because the antichrist church will have false signs and lying wonders as well they may have more supernatural than us as far as those kind of signs i don't know but i know one thing i know the holy spirit living in our lives will guide us into all truth and thy word is truth and i know one thing the bible says these signs shall follow them that believe amen hallelujah it's exactly right so when you have gangsters and you have uh accusers of brother random accusers of brother jesse what does the bible say we have to use sound doctrine to show how they're wrong praise god chapter two verse one i'm trying to close here i'll just do these churches then titus okay and then i'll stop i'll save these for next time lord willing we'll see which way the holy spirit directs me as i study titus 2 1 2 and 3. now i read this one last sunday but speak i'm sorry last wednesday but speak thou the things which become what sound doctrine so when you talk about things make sure it's found in the bible and that's why we got to be careful like because a lot of brothers and sisters have experiences right and so we have to make sure well is that exactly scriptural the things we talk about should be sound doctrine okay like brother austin here's a good example remember brother man told that story he was beyond the curtain of time and the angel said all that ever loved you and all you loved are here in heaven right but that that statement has to be have sound doctrine to it right in other words we have to find bible examples is there a bible example where every person a believer loved was saved now i don't know can we think of one i thought about it for years sister naomi i can't think of one i mean there could be but see how see how easy it is to just listen to the story and then just believe it but the bible says we should speak things that become what sound doctrine in other words where can i teach that in the bible now the other thought on that is well the love maybe that was just divine love so all those people i had i shared the divine love with god well of course they'll be there because they have the same holy ghost brother branham did amen now that's what i think it is now brother now before i did it brother so i'm letting you know i grew in this area i used to think well everybody i love sinners saints going to go to heaven i don't believe that anymore because i don't have scripture for that so now i feel like that story has to be understood by the bible because the bible said jesus comes to all those that love his appearing there it is right hallelujah amen that's in the book of titus as well praise god so see every story every testimony every miracle whatever it is has to be brought back to the bible to make sure that's a sound bible doctrine does that make sense everybody well brother jesse that takes a lot of work well that's exactly what preachers are supposed to be doing they're supposed to be working in the bible did you know the bible said doctrine is labor when you teach something it's actual work i've got to make sure this scripture works with that one i've got to make sure this one works together that's actual work and a workman is worthy of his hire that's why they pay the preachers because they're supposed to labor in here to give you spiritual blessings anybody blessed yet tonight by god's grace okay good i got a few amen praise the lord amen i trust you are i am too by god's grace i'm blessed by this word of god here tonight so speak now the things which becomes sound doctrine verse two that the age men be sober grave temperate sound in faith in charity and patience verse three the age women likewise that they be in behaviors becometh holiness not false accusers now look look what he tells the women make sure the women aren't lying on each other there's been a woman one of our family members of somebody in our church who's lied on me and lied on other people born in our church and got caught in the lies and this woman of course doesn't go to our church but she's related to people in our church she's a false accuser accuse me of saying things i never said and things i never did but what can i do all i can do is love them pray for them not given to much wine teachers of what good things so see a woman is to teach but look who she's supposed to teach verse 4 tells us that they may teach the young women so women don't teach from the pulpit women teach from their lives with younger women to be sober to love their husbands and to love their children okay now go down to verse uh verse six young men likewise exhort to be so reminded so austin's a young man right maokai's young man i hope i'm still young too but be sober right don't be so foolish right as young men we we can't be foolish we have to be sin we have to be serious at times right we have to be sincere right because young people have this uh inclination just to be laughed laughing all the time happy go lucky but the holy spirit says be sober minded make sure your mind is serious on the things of god verse eight i'm sorry verse verse seven why why would sober men be young men be sober mind in verse seven in all things showing thyself a pattern of good works oh something just struck me there uh in doctrine showing uncorruptedness gravity sincerity so let me show two things there you should have a pattern of good works now let me give you a pattern you already do you give ties that's the pattern of good works you give offerings that's a pattern of good works some people don't have that pattern yet they're trying to learn that pattern right we all had to learn it but you should have a pattern in other words you should see something repeat oh i do this all the time that's why you should have a fast day you should have a pattern of good works right i have a reminder to come up make sure you're given to the poor every month now some months i gotta say oh i gotta do that because i haven't given to the poor this month right but most months i've been helping people out so i just click okay done i already did it but you need a pattern you have to show yourself a pattern of good works and that comes by obeying the doctrine of the bible being able to be taught by the holy spirit how to live a godly life and a pattern of good works and we got a lot of young people coming up here don't we got a lot of little girls you
