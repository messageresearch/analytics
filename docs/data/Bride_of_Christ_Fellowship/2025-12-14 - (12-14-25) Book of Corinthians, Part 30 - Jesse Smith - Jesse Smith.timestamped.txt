[16:51] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. God bless everybody.
[16:53] It's good to be in the house of the Lord
[16:54] today.
[16:56] Open up with a word of prayer. Have a
[16:58] few songs [music] and uh preach God's
[17:00] word today.
[17:04] Just so all the uh live streamers are
[17:06] aware, I did cancel service. Um, as far
[17:09] as [music] I didn't want people out on
[17:10] the roads, but people are welcome to
[17:13] come if they feel led by God's grace,
[17:15] but [music] we don't want anyone in any
[17:17] danger. Um,
[17:20] so uh for those in live stream land, God
[17:24] bless you richly and may God speak to
[17:25] you and strengthen you, [music] help
[17:27] you. Uh we thought the audio would be
[17:29] better here uh for the preaching mainly
[17:32] um singing as [music] well, but we don't
[17:35] have good audio for the instruments on
[17:38] the live stream. So, we apologize about
[17:39] that. But we're just grateful to be
[17:41] gathered here despite [music] the snow
[17:43] and we're so thankful. Uh brother Chris
[17:46] wants to thank the Lord that he was uh
[17:47] safe last night driving around while he
[17:50] was working. [music] And I got a text
[17:52] from God bless her uh sister. uh she
[17:55] wanted to testify and say thank God that
[17:57] [music] she was driving up near I think
[17:58] Brimfield, I think, if I'm not mistaken,
[18:00] and God got her home safely. [music] So,
[18:02] let's thank the Lord for that. Amen.
[18:04] [applause] God is good.
[18:08] Amen.
[18:10] I'm thankful God got us here uh with no
[18:12] [music]
[18:13] accidents. We saw three or four cars on
[18:15] the side of the road. Grateful though
[18:17] God has kept us. [music] And let's have
[18:18] a word of prayer as we enter into
[18:20] worship.
[18:22] Dear God, we thank you for today. Lord,
[18:23] it's a joy to be in your presence. Lord,
[18:25] it's a joy to gather. [music] And Lord,
[18:27] although most aren't here, Lord, I know
[18:28] you're with them, Lord, in their homes.
[18:31] And uh we know you're with us. For
[18:32] [music] wherever two or three are
[18:34] gathered, there I am in the midst. What
[18:36] a promise, Lord. As we heard, Lord,
[18:38] during the instrumental [music] songs,
[18:40] Lord, you're the way maker. You're the
[18:42] promisekeeper. Hallelujah. You're the
[18:44] light in the darkness, Lord. You're
[18:47] faithful, Lord God. you could swear by
[18:49] no greater. So you [music] swore by
[18:51] yourself that you would keep your
[18:53] covenant. You would keep your promises.
[18:55] Thank you for a blood covenant through
[18:57] the blood of Jesus Christ. [music]
[18:58] Hallelujah.
[19:00] Perfect sacrifice means perfect
[19:02] cleansing, perfect loosing from our
[19:04] sins. Thank you, God, that we're washed
[19:07] perfectly [music] by the blood of Jesus
[19:08] Christ. Hallelujah. We're more thankful
[19:10] for that than anything we know, [music]
[19:12] Lord, as your prophet said in the
[19:14] invisible union.
[19:16] So God, as we're gathered here today,
[19:18] thank you for safe travel that uh our
[19:20] family could be there, a little [music]
[19:21] portions of our family rather, Austin
[19:23] and brother Chris. Lord, we thank you
[19:24] for safe travel. [music] Lord, bless
[19:26] your saints, Lord, that are at home,
[19:28] Lord God. And I just pray you give them
[19:30] good health, [music] good strength, Lord
[19:32] God. Help us to worship you here today,
[19:34] God, in spirit and in truth. For there's
[19:36] only one [music] spirit we want to be
[19:37] in. That's the Holy Spirit. Hallelujah.
[19:39] So bless our worship. Uh minister to
[19:42] those, [music] Lord, on the live stream,
[19:43] Lord. those that are watching by archive
[19:46] and God strengthen our [music] faith.
[19:48] Lord, as we come to the end of this
[19:51] 2025, we want to say thank you for a
[19:54] year of your grace, a year of your
[19:56] [music] favor, a year, another year of
[19:58] provision, another year of your
[20:00] spiritual blessings and your physical
[20:02] protection, Lord God. Hallelujah. We
[20:05] just want to say, holy, holy, holy is
[20:07] the Lord God Almighty. Hallelujah.
[20:10] You're worthy of all praise, worthy of
[20:11] our worship. So, Father, we want to give
[20:13] you worship today. Bless [music] our

[34:37] I've had a dollar [singing]
[34:38] to my name and I've had friends that
[34:43] walked away
[34:45] and I've even lost myself a time or two.
[34:53] There [music] were bridges crossed and
[34:56] burned. Through all the wreckage I have
[35:00] learned, there's one thing that I could
[35:04] never lose.
[35:08] If I got Jesus,
[35:12] I've got all that I [singing]

[35:18] away from me and I'll be okay. [music]
[35:24] I got Jesus. [singing]
[35:28] There's a hope that's living deep
[35:31] inside.
[35:32] Joy [music] that I could never hide and
[35:36] a safe [singing] place to fall. If I got
[35:39] Jesus,
[35:42] I've got it all.
[35:46] I've seen weakness turned astray. I've
[35:50] seen failures met with grace.
[35:54] And it's not from what I've done. It's
[35:57] Christ in [music]
[35:59] me.
[36:01] A miracle [singing]
[36:02] I can't explain. He has given me his
[36:07] [singing] name. I'm the [music] richest
[36:10] man that I could ever be. [music]
[36:16] I got Jesus.
[36:20] all [music and singing] that I could
[36:22] ever need. Take this world away from me
[36:28] and I'll be [singing and music] okay.
[36:31] My God, Jesus,
[36:35] there's a hope that's [music] living
[36:37] deep inside. Joy that I could [singing]
[36:41] never hide. [music] Safe place to fall.
[36:45] If I got Jesus,
[36:49] I've got it all.
[36:54] Someday that trumpet's going to sound
[36:58] [music]
[37:01] and the king [singing] of heaven will
[37:03] ride upon the clouds coming [music]
[37:06] down.
[37:08] And I'll hit my knees, [singing] oh
[37:10] Lord, and sings [music] my soul.
[37:14] I'm going home.
[37:18] If I got Jesus,
[37:22] I've got all that I [singing] could ever
[37:26] need. Take this world away from me. And
[37:31] I'll be okay.
[37:33] I got Jesus.
[37:38] There's a hope that's [singing] living
[37:40] deep inside. Joy that I could never
[37:44] hide. Safe place [singing]
[37:46] to fall. If I got Jesus,
[37:51] I've got it all.
[37:55] If I got Jesus,
[37:59] I've got it all.
[38:02] Amen. Amen. Let's take a few prayer

[40:33] Oh, yeah. I saw her uh Friday and her
[40:35] [music] surgery's tomorrow at 400 p.m.
[40:38] That's right. Thank you, brother. Let's
[40:39] pray for Hannah.
[40:41] And so, the doctors are going to they're
[40:42] going in to see, you know, why things
[40:45] [music] are leaking out of her uh
[40:49] belly button there. And if they can fix
[40:51] it, they'll fix it right then and there
[40:53] tomorrow. if they if they search it out
[40:55] and they realize there's more issues,
[40:58] then they'll come back later. So, let's
[41:00] pray that they can fix it tomorrow by
[41:02] God's [music] grace. That'd be very
[41:04] special.
[41:06] I appreciate you remember that, but I
[41:07] forgot about tomorrow 400 p.m. surgery.
[41:18] We've got it all. Let's pray for these
[41:21] [music] requests. We have it all with
[41:22] Jesus. Thank you, Lord. What a promise,
[41:23] Lord. You're the way maker, the
[41:25] promiseke keeper. God, we come by the
[41:27] blood of Jesus Christ today, [music]
[41:28] God. Forgive our sins. We've worshiped
[41:30] you, God. We've given you praise and
[41:32] honor. You are holy, holy, holy, holy.
[41:34] We join the cherubam. We join the
[41:36] seraraphim. We join [music] the heavenly
[41:38] host saying, "Holy, holy, holy. The
[41:41] whole earth is full of your glory. So,
[41:44] we love you today, God. We worship you.
[41:46] [music] You're holy. You're set apart.
[41:48] You're special, Lord God. Hallelujah.
[41:51] We just don't have [music] words to
[41:53] rightly put it.
[41:55] Of course, it's impossible to summarize
[41:58] an [music] eternal being, Lord, with
[41:59] human words, Lord.
[42:02] But we worship you with all we have
[42:04] today, God. We give you thanks. We cry
[42:05] holy today. [music] Hallelujah. Thank
[42:08] you, Lord God, for blessing us that we
[42:10] can be here, for blessing the saints
[42:12] that they can live stream, Lord God,
[42:13] that we [music] can all worship you and
[42:16] hear the word of Lord and offer these
[42:17] prayer requests to heaven, Lord God.
[42:21] We know they go past the ceiling, Lord
[42:22] God. They're not stopped by [music] the
[42:24] ceiling, but by faith, they go up to
[42:26] heaven as incense, Lord God, because
[42:29] you've forgiven our sins. We're
[42:30] perfectly forgiven [music] by the blood
[42:31] of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. And we're
[42:34] priests unto God to make intercession.
[42:37] So, in the name of Jesus Christ, [music]
[42:38] we ask for healing, Lord God, for all
[42:40] those that need it, Lord. Brother Ben
[42:42] Nurro, we pray for healing, Lord. just
[42:44] use the surgeons there that his appendix
[42:47] could be removed and he could be
[42:49] recovered [music] in the name of Jesus
[42:51] Christ that we could see him soon in a
[42:52] couple weeks. Lord, bless our brother.
[42:54] Give him grace and [music] strength to
[42:56] go through these uh sicknesses, these
[43:00] ailments, Lord God. [music] But
[43:01] strengthen him that he can continue to
[43:03] preach your word, Lord God, and
[43:05] strengthen the saints, Lord God. How we
[43:07] appreciate our brother, Lord. We ask for
[43:09] healing for Elijah with battling cancer
[43:12] at 22 years old. Lord, you've done it
[43:13] before. [music] We've heard different
[43:15] testimonies around the message and even
[43:17] my own mother. Lord, you're able to heal
[43:19] cancer. So, Father, we [music] ask for
[43:20] healing in Jesus name. Lord, extend the
[43:23] man's life. I pray, Lord God. The young
[43:25] man, Lord God, give him hope, Lord God,
[43:28] for a future, [music] Lord God.
[43:30] Hallelujah.
[43:32] Lord, may they be good thoughts, Lord
[43:34] [music] God. Hallelujah, for the future.
[43:36] Lord, ultimately, Lord, your plan is the
[43:38] best plan. So, God, we make our requests
[43:40] [music]
[43:40] known unto you. bless our brother. We
[43:42] pray he's a message believer. [snorts]
[43:46] So, Father, Lord, just reveal yourself
[43:47] to him. Reveal your will to our [music]
[43:49] brother Elijah there, God, in Kansas, in
[43:52] Jesus Christ's name. Touch sister
[43:54] [music] uh Lena, Lord, God, we just
[43:56] pray, God, for uh the thyroid that it
[43:59] would be healed, Lord, in Jesus name.
[44:01] Lord, as the biopsy [music] comes up,
[44:03] Lord, strengthen Lena's faith, Austin's
[44:06] faith, Lord God, our faith to believe
[44:07] that all things [music] are possible,
[44:08] Lord, to them that believe. Hallelujah.
[44:11] Lord, our lives are in your hands, Lord
[44:13] God. [music] Hallelujah. Everything
[44:14] works together for good. All things work
[44:16] together for the good to them that love
[44:18] the Lord. Hallelujah. We love you, Lord
[44:21] God. And this will work for your glory.
[44:22] [music] So give our sister a healing
[44:24] touch in Jesus Christ's holy name.
[44:26] Hallelujah. Touch her as well, Lord,
[44:28] with a [music] pregnancy, Lord Jesus.
[44:29] Give her grace and strength. Father, we
[44:31] ask it, Lord. God, be with Chris's
[44:33] [music]
[44:34] nephew there in the hospital, Lord God.
[44:36] We just pray you'd have a swift
[44:37] recovery, Lord. that your Holy Spirit
[44:39] touch his body, [music] God, that he'll
[44:42] recover, Lord God. Lord, how we hate to
[44:44] go through these seasons of [music] cold
[44:46] and sickness, but Lord, your grace gives
[44:48] us mercy each and every time. And we
[44:50] [music] ask for mercy again. We ask for
[44:51] the healing power of the Holy Spirit to
[44:53] touch the young boy, Lord, for your
[44:55] glory. [music] That Chris would magnify
[44:56] your name. All of us would magnify your
[44:58] holy name about your mercy and [music]
[45:00] about your healing powers, Lord Jesus.
[45:02] So minister to the child, we pray in the
[45:04] holy name of Jesus Christ, our Lord. We
[45:07] ask [music] it. Father, we ask God for
[45:09] healing for Hannah. Lord, God, thank you
[45:12] for her her courage, Lord, as I prayed
[45:14] with her. Father, I just ask, [music]
[45:16] God, that the surgeons could find the
[45:19] problem, Lord, about this leakage. And
[45:21] Lord, bring healing to it tomorrow,
[45:22] Lord, at 4 p.m., [music] God, just give
[45:24] her courage, Lord, give the parents,
[45:26] Lord, courage as well, Lord God. We're
[45:29] trusting in Almighty God. [music]
[45:30] Hallelujah. Make a way, Lord God, that
[45:33] the child could be healed and not have
[45:34] this leaking anymore for the glory of
[45:37] God. That she [music] can enjoy school,
[45:38] enjoy being a child, Lord God.
[45:41] Hallelujah. And peace can come upon this
[45:43] wonderful family. God, I ask it.
[45:45] Remember the parents there, Lord God.
[45:47] [music] Be with Hannah and the surgeons,
[45:49] God. Thank you for this technology.
[45:51] Thank you for your healing powers,
[45:53] [music] Lord, through uh doctors doing
[45:56] their part. And then, Lord, you're the
[45:57] only one that can heal, Father. So God,
[46:00] we thank you. All praise and glory and
[46:01] honor [music] goes to thy name. And
[46:03] Lord, just like Luther, the physician,
[46:05] you used him, God, use these physicians,
[46:07] God, for your glory.
[46:09] Father God, we commit [music] this
[46:10] service into your hands, God. And I pray
[46:13] you bless the preaching of thy word and
[46:14] our our worship and our prayers, Lord
[46:17] God. Thank you again [music] for safe
[46:18] travel that we could be here, Lord. We
[46:21] ask for another wonderful week here,
[46:23] Lord, coming up. [music] God, give us
[46:24] grace, Lord, to do your will, Lord God.
[46:27] You'll continue to provide, Lord, all
[46:28] things, [music] God. May we continue to
[46:31] surrender to you, Lord, all of our
[46:32] lives, all of our [music] worship, all
[46:34] of our praise, God. We trust you with
[46:37] our lives. Bless this uh preaching of
[46:39] thy word and the singing [music] here in
[46:40] Jesus Christ's name. Amen.
[46:43] Amen.
[46:45] Let's uh pick it up a little bit here by
[46:47] God's grace. Jesus, I'll never forget
[46:48] what you've done for me.
[46:54] again. Jesus, [music and singing] I'll
[46:56] never forget what you done for me.
[47:02] Jesus, I'll never forget how you [music]
[47:06] set me free.
[47:09] Jesus, [singing] I'll never forget how
[47:12] [music] you brought me out.
[47:16] [music]
[47:17] Never [singing] forget.
[47:23] And [music and singing] how can I forget
[47:26] what you've done for me?
[47:30] [music] How can [singing] I forget
[47:33] how you've set me free?
[47:37] How [music and singing] can I forget
[47:40] how you brought me out? [music]
[47:44] How can I forget
[47:47] no [music]
[47:49] ever?
[47:51] He's done so much for me that I cannot
[47:55] [music] tell [singing] it all.
[47:58] I cannot tell it all. No, I cannot tell
[48:03] it all. [music] He's done so much for me
[48:08] that I cannot tell [music and singing]
[48:10] it all. He has taken my sins [singing]
[48:15] away.
[48:18] Oh, he's been so good to me that I
[48:22] [singing] cannot tell it all. [music] I
[48:26] cannot tell it all.
[48:29] I cannot [singing] tell it all. He's
[48:32] [music] been so good to me that I cannot
[48:37] tell it all. He has taken my sins away.
[48:45] Bring [music and singing] up a well
[48:49] down in my soul.
[48:52] Bring up a well
[48:55] and make thee whole.
[48:59] Bring up [singing] a
[49:03] give to me
[49:06] and love
[49:09] abundantly. [music]
[49:11] How can I forget?
[49:14] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[49:14] &gt;&gt; How can [music] I forget
[49:16] what you've done?
[49:21] How [music and singing] can I forget how
[49:23] you set me free?
[49:27] And how can I forget
[49:30] how you [singing] brought me? Thank you,
[49:33] Lord. Oh, how can I [music] forget
[49:37] your name? He's done well.
[49:40] &gt;&gt; [singing]
[49:40] &gt;&gt; He's done [music] so much for me that I
[49:44] cannot tell it all. [music] I cannot
[49:49] tell it all. Oh, I cannot tell it all.
[49:54] He's [music] done so much for me
[49:56] [singing]
[49:57] that I cannot tell it all. He has taken
[50:03] my sins away.
[50:08] Amen. I thank God. Hallelujah.
[50:11] Amen.
[50:14] And that's the best part. He took our
[50:15] sins away. Praise God. Amen. Let's take
[50:18] our Bibles here. Uh by God's grace,
[50:20] let's go to 1 Corinthians chapter 16. I
[50:22] think by the help of the Lord, we'll
[50:23] finish the book today. It's been 30
[50:26] sermons on this book. And uh it's been
[50:29] really wonderful. By God's grace, I
[50:31] trust you've enjoyed it.
[50:35] 1 Corinthians chapter 16.
[50:53] We'll just read verse one here. by the
[50:55] grace of God.
[51:02] I was thinking on this and know just
[51:05] what a book this is. What a church this
[51:07] was. And then I was just thinking again
[51:08] this morning, this is a church that
[51:11] baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus
[51:13] Christ. Right? This is a church uh that
[51:16] believed God was one person, right? This
[51:19] is a book of Acts church. They had the
[51:21] right water baptism. They had faith in
[51:23] the blood of Jesus Christ. But they had
[51:25] a lot of problems just because of the
[51:27] sin nature. Now Paul will address it in
[51:30] the next book. He'll talk about the seal
[51:32] of the Holy Ghost. And so obviously, you
[51:34] know, Paul doubted some of these people
[51:36] were sealed by the Holy Ghost just like
[51:37] he doubted in Galatia that they had the
[51:39] new birth because they'd brought
[51:41] legalism into the the faith. And he
[51:45] called them fools because of that. Uh
[51:47] but still despite all this, Paul shows a
[51:49] lot of grace and a lot of love. And
[51:50] that's what we want to remember too.
[51:51] When people struggle in the church, we
[51:53] want to show them a lot of grace and a
[51:55] lot of love. Amen.
[51:57] Chapter 16 here, verse one.
[52:06] Let's just read verse one here. Then we
[52:09] can be seated here. Let's read it on
[52:10] three. One, two, three. Now, concerning
[52:13] the collection for the saints, as I have
[52:16] given order to the churches of Galatia,
[52:19] even so do ye. May God add his blessing
[52:22] to the reading of the word. You can be
[52:23] seated.
[52:26] I have some notes here. We'll show here
[52:28] by God's grace.
[52:31] I just love how uh the previous chapter
[52:34] ended there uh as we looked at on
[52:36] Wednesday night. Thanks be to God who
[52:38] gives us victory through our Lord Jesus
[52:40] Christ. Let's feel victorious today.
[52:41] Praise God. All victory is in Jesus. And
[52:45] because of that, be steadfast,
[52:46] unmovable,
[52:48] always abounding in the work of the
[52:50] Lord. For as much as you know that your
[52:52] labor is not in vain in the Lord. Amen.
[52:56] So, obviously, this was a large church.
[52:58] Remember, Jesus told Paul, I have many
[53:00] people in this city, and I don't know if
[53:02] they gathered in one church or just in
[53:04] numerous house churches there in
[53:05] Corinth. We don't we're not really told
[53:08] uh where they actually gathered and how
[53:10] many people there were, but there was
[53:11] many people saved in Corinth according
[53:14] to the Lord Jesus.
[53:16] And so he would encourage he would of
[53:18] course bring correction to all those
[53:19] that needed correction, but then he
[53:21] would encourage all the faithful, keep
[53:22] going, keep standing uh by the grace of
[53:25] God. And so here in chapter 16, he
[53:27] brings a close to the book. And hard to
[53:30] believe we're here at the end. We're
[53:31] here at this the ninth section here of
[53:33] the thoughts that CI Scoffield gives at
[53:36] least to outline this book. And we're
[53:38] looking at his closing instructions and
[53:40] greetings. And I just counted them up. I
[53:43] just I think I put 10 sins on here that
[53:45] he found in the church. I added one here
[53:47] in here. We saw the division because of
[53:50] uh some people liked some preachers
[53:52] better than others. Sexual morality. And
[53:54] I added this one. They weren't mourning
[53:57] over that. There were certain groups
[53:58] they they weren't sad about the sin in
[54:00] the church, right? So they they'd gotten
[54:03] so used to the sexual sin they didn't
[54:05] even mourn over it. The Bible said, Paul
[54:06] said they were puffed up about it. So
[54:09] again, just a really awful condition
[54:11] there. They were suing each other,
[54:12] getting drunk at the Lord's table. Uh
[54:15] the rich were not, you know, uh giving
[54:18] food to the poor at communion. Uh they
[54:20] were out of order with their spiritual
[54:22] gifts. And I think it's clear too now
[54:23] that I thought about it, you know, whim
[54:25] the women were asking questions out loud
[54:27] during the services. So they must have
[54:29] had some type of a big room and and the
[54:31] women would sit there and try to ask
[54:33] questions during the service. And Paul
[54:35] said, "Let your women ask questions at
[54:36] home. Ask your husbands at home." So
[54:39] there must have been some type of
[54:40] tradition in Corinth that the women
[54:43] could shout out during uh the religious
[54:45] services. And Paul tells them they're to
[54:47] be silent in the church. They're not
[54:49] supposed to preach the word of God and
[54:50] let them ask their questions at home.
[54:53] And that's how it would be, church. You
[54:54] know, that's how be, you know, imagine
[54:55] if I'm preaching and and there's uh uh
[54:58] adults in the back whispering and asking
[55:00] questions in the back, right? While I'm
[55:01] preaching, you know, we'd all be
[55:03] distracted, right? We'd all be uh we'd
[55:05] all be unable to focus on what was going
[55:08] on. But this is what was happening in
[55:10] the church, a book of Acts church that
[55:11] had been baptized in the name of the
[55:13] Lord Jesus Christ. So, uh just
[55:15] immaturity, right? A lot of immaturity.
[55:17] Uh but uh God sent Paul to correct the
[55:20] immaturity. And then there were some
[55:22] that were saying there was no
[55:23] resurrection. Paul called them foolish
[55:25] as we saw on Wednesday night. And as
[55:27] we'll see today, they lack some
[55:28] generosity. And we'll actually see it
[55:31] even into the uh book of second
[55:33] Corinthians. As we'll see, they also
[55:35] suffered a lot of false teachers uh in
[55:38] the church as well. Now, I just want to
[55:40] lay this out because I've been learning
[55:41] this as well as I've been studying it.
[55:43] Paul actually wrote four letters to the
[55:45] Corinthians. We only got two of them
[55:48] because if you pay attention, you know,
[55:50] uh, to these words in 1 Corinthians 5:9,
[55:53] Paul said, "I wrote to you that you
[55:55] would not keep company with
[55:56] fornicators." So Paul had already
[55:58] written them one letter.
[56:00] Okay? And then they wrote back because
[56:02] Paul says in 1 Corinthians 7, he said,
[56:05] "I'm going to address your questions
[56:06] from your letter." And it was about
[56:08] marriage. And he he said, "If you're
[56:10] burning, get married." Remember that? He
[56:12] talked about those who had been
[56:13] separated. So Paul already wrote one
[56:15] letter. We don't we don't have this
[56:16] letter. Uh we have Paul's second letter
[56:19] which we call first Corinthians because
[56:21] that's the first letter we have.
[56:23] And then Paul says when he's writing
[56:25] second Corinthians, he says he wrote
[56:27] another letter that brought them to
[56:29] tears because he cared so much about
[56:32] them. Um and he didn't uh he didn't he
[56:35] didn't really want to make them cry, but
[56:37] he knew he had to bring them to
[56:38] repentance. And so then then he writes
[56:40] the letter of second Corinthians. So,
[56:42] there's actually four letters uh that
[56:44] Paul writes unto them, and we're just
[56:46] getting two of them. Uh I think in
[56:48] heaven, we'll get to read all four.
[56:49] Praise God. We'll really know because
[56:51] remember down through the ages, we'll
[56:53] take an age and we'll look at God's
[56:55] kindness to the Corinthians. Praise God.
[56:57] God's kindness to the Akran saints, all
[57:00] of us. Amen. Or we'd say maybe the
[57:02] Leoian church age. will take an age
[57:03] where God will explain and maybe he'll
[57:07] put it up on his big uh television
[57:08] screen, you know, the heavenly screen,
[57:10] and we'll see how God was so faithful to
[57:12] us down through the ages. We'll see that
[57:14] he never left us. He never forsook us.
[57:17] So, just keep that in mind that there's
[57:20] uh there's there's different
[57:21] interactions with Paul and the
[57:22] Corinthians. Despite there only being
[57:25] two letters, Paul was interacting with
[57:27] them.
[57:29] Now um in verse one now concerning the
[57:31] collection of the saints as I've given
[57:33] order to the churches of Galatia even so
[57:36] do ye. So Paul gave an order as an
[57:39] apostle as the man that started the
[57:41] church he gave an order to collect money
[57:44] and he said do it on the first day of
[57:46] the week. Now we also know in acts
[57:48] chapter 20 the believers always met on
[57:50] the first day of the week. So this is
[57:52] one thing that separated the Christians
[57:54] from the Jews because the Jews would
[57:55] meet on Saturday, right? Because their
[57:58] Sabbath started Friday night and it went
[57:59] to Saturday night. That was their day.
[58:03] Okay? But our days basically start at
[58:05] 12:00 a.m., right? And go to the next 12
[58:07] a.m. So our days are slightly different.
[58:11] But that immediately set Christians
[58:13] apart. They worshiped on Sunday because
[58:15] that's the day our Lord resurrected. And
[58:18] Jews would worship on Saturday.
[58:20] Now, there's nothing wrong with taking a
[58:22] day of rest like Charlie Kirk did. You
[58:23] know, he he uh he honored the the
[58:25] Saturday Sabbath, right? There's there's
[58:28] no there's no harm in doing that. I have
[58:30] a a friend named Dan Danny Finley. He
[58:32] does the same thing from Friday night to
[58:34] Saturday night. He shuts his phone down
[58:35] and he just reads and eats good food in
[58:38] his home with his wife and they have
[58:39] friends over. And that sounds like
[58:41] pretty good, right? Sounds pretty good.
[58:43] I don't know how I could do that though
[58:44] with nine children.
[58:46] Um and he and he and he expresses a lot
[58:50] of great uh victory in that uh maybe for
[58:53] him. And so that's a Christian liberty.
[58:55] You know, like the Bible says, one man
[58:56] will esteem one day holy, another man
[58:58] won't. But the Bible said just be fully
[59:00] persuaded in your own minds. The point
[59:02] we need to make is that there needs to
[59:04] be one day we rest and don't work. And
[59:05] that's Sunday for us. That's right.
[59:07] &gt;&gt; Right. We should physically rest Sunday
[59:09] and just give God the whole day. But in
[59:12] one way, we rest every day of the week
[59:14] &gt;&gt; because the baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[59:16] rest for the soul. That's in Hebrews 4.
[59:19] So, just keep your spot there. Let me
[59:21] read uh let's read that if you forgot
[59:22] about that. And good for the live
[59:25] streamers, too. I I just had a a sister
[59:27] email me this week saying she streams
[59:29] most of our services. So, uh because
[59:31] they don't have a pastor and we have
[59:33] numerous people that send us our tithes
[59:34] and they don't even go here. Uh they
[59:37] really help keep our church open by
[59:39] God's grace. It's quite gracious of God
[59:42] to do that. Hebrews 4.
[59:48] Let's go there. Uh
[59:51] verse one says, "Let us therefore fear
[59:54] less a promise being left us of entering
[59:56] into his rest any of you should seem to
[59:59] come short of it." So there is a New
[1:00:01] Testament rest. It's the rest for the
[1:00:03] soul. Hallelujah.
[1:00:06] And um now let's go down here. I don't
[1:00:09] want to skip it. I didn't have it this
[1:00:10] written out down especially but I don't
[1:00:13] want to miss it. Let's just go to verse
[1:00:14] nine because we can clear clear clearly
[1:00:15] see it there. There remainth therefore a
[1:00:17] rest for the people of God. So Paul
[1:00:20] recognizes here the Old Testament had a
[1:00:22] rest. It was Saturday but there remains
[1:00:25] a greater rest than that. Just keeping
[1:00:28] Saturday uh like our Seventh Day
[1:00:31] Adventist friends like Master McCra used
[1:00:32] to be a Seventh Day Adventist. Just
[1:00:34] doing that that wasn't enough. God gave
[1:00:37] us something greater in the New
[1:00:38] Testament. For he that has entered into
[1:00:40] his rest, he hath also ceased from his
[1:00:43] own works as God did from his. So now we
[1:00:46] see the Christian rest is stopping your
[1:00:48] sinful life and it's resting in God's
[1:00:51] life. Right? We're doing the works of
[1:00:53] God. In other words, I've stopped living
[1:00:55] for the world like I used to when I was
[1:00:56] a sinner. I've ceased from that and now
[1:00:59] I'm doing the works of Christ. And then
[1:01:01] I love verse 11 and 12. Let us therefore
[1:01:04] labor to enter into that rest, lest any
[1:01:06] man fall after the same example of
[1:01:08] unbelief. So it's only unbelief that's
[1:01:11] going to keep some from entering into
[1:01:12] the Holy Ghost New Testament rest. For
[1:01:15] the word of God is quick and powerful,
[1:01:17] sharper than any two-edged sword,
[1:01:19] piercing even to dividing a sunder of
[1:01:22] soul and spirit and of the joints and
[1:01:23] marrow, and is a discerner of the
[1:01:25] thoughts and intents of the heart. You
[1:01:27] know, I had this happen. I the Lord used
[1:01:29] me to discern someone's life on Monday
[1:01:30] night. Malachi when after he gave his
[1:01:32] testimony on Monday night, uh this young
[1:01:35] man came up and he said, uh he said,
[1:01:36] "Jesse, can you give me some psalms that
[1:01:39] would really help me? I'm really
[1:01:40] struggling with depression and things
[1:01:43] like that." And the very psalm I sent
[1:01:45] him later, he texted me and said,
[1:01:46] "That's the one I was looking for." He
[1:01:48] said, "My I was hungering in my heart
[1:01:50] for that one, and that's the one you
[1:01:52] sent me. Praise God." And so I told him,
[1:01:54] "That's that that's Hebrews 4:12." Uh
[1:01:57] Hebrews 4:12 shows how the word of God
[1:01:59] knows the thoughts and intents of your
[1:02:01] heart. And when that is revealed to you
[1:02:03] or when God gives you the desire of your
[1:02:05] heart, that's a sign that the living
[1:02:07] word is working in our midst.
[1:02:10] Hallelujah.
[1:02:13] So, uh we want to see that there that uh
[1:02:15] Christians worship on Sunday. Now, the
[1:02:18] Seventh Day Adventist Church, they
[1:02:20] they're against the Catholic Church,
[1:02:21] which is good in many ways, but just so
[1:02:24] you know, they believe the mark of the
[1:02:26] beast is worshiping on Sunday. And they
[1:02:28] believe that's what the Catholic Church
[1:02:30] is going to force everybody to take the
[1:02:31] mark, which is worshiping on Sunday. So,
[1:02:34] just so you know, um uh that that's
[1:02:38] that's their whole uh idea. That's their
[1:02:41] hypothesis about how the mark is going
[1:02:43] to come down, right? But we know brother
[1:02:45] Ram said with thus sayith the Lord. It's
[1:02:47] unionized religion is the mark of the
[1:02:49] beast. In other words, you have to join
[1:02:51] in with their unionized group. Religion
[1:02:54] is going to be like a union. You got to
[1:02:55] join the union of religion. And it's a
[1:02:58] uniting with the Roman Catholic Church
[1:02:59] and the Protestants. But we'll never do
[1:03:01] that because we're united to Christ.
[1:03:03] Hallelujah. We're not united to
[1:03:05] denomination or united in any other way.
[1:03:07] We're only united to Jesus Christ.
[1:03:11] Now Paul says uh I gave an order that we
[1:03:15] need to collect money and bring your
[1:03:17] money on the first day of the week as
[1:03:19] God has prospered you. So God doesn't
[1:03:22] ask us to give things we don't have. God
[1:03:25] only asks us to give what we do have.
[1:03:27] And he said when I come whomsoever ye
[1:03:29] shall approve by your letters them will
[1:03:31] I send to bring your liberality unto
[1:03:35] Jerusalem. So Paul said, "You're going
[1:03:36] to write me a letter back, and you'll
[1:03:38] tell me the men that are going to carry
[1:03:40] this money to Jerusalem."
[1:03:43] All right. And verse four, "And if it be
[1:03:45] me that I go also, they shall go with
[1:03:48] me." So Paul ordered all numerous
[1:03:51] churches to to collect money and send it
[1:03:54] to Jerusalem because of the famine.
[1:03:56] Remember the famine that Agabus
[1:03:57] foretold? He said, "There'll be a great
[1:03:59] dir throughout the land." Agabus said
[1:04:01] that with thus sayeth the Lord. And it
[1:04:03] came to pass in Paul's day.
[1:04:06] And now that dirt had not reached Paul,
[1:04:08] right, in Galatia and Ephesus and uh
[1:04:10] Corinth, the dirt had not reached there.
[1:04:12] It was mainly there around Jerusalem.
[1:04:15] So Paul said, "Let's let's show our
[1:04:18] Jewish brethren some love and let's send
[1:04:20] them some money because they're really
[1:04:22] hurting right now and they need food and
[1:04:25] they need uh their necessities met." So
[1:04:28] he he gave an order. I order you to
[1:04:30] bring some free will offerings. Well,
[1:04:32] how would you feel if I did that today?
[1:04:34] Amen. How would you feel if uh uh your
[1:04:36] pastor did that or some other preacher
[1:04:37] said, "I feel ordered and I I order you
[1:04:40] by the Holy Spirit to bring some
[1:04:42] offerings." Amen. But this was Paul was
[1:04:45] an apostle. They knew that he had seen
[1:04:47] Jesus. Hallelujah. He had the testimony.
[1:04:49] He had the miracles. He had the
[1:04:51] reputation that he met Jesus. So Paul
[1:04:53] could give those orders. He started the
[1:04:55] church. So they trusted him by his
[1:04:58] experience with Christ.
[1:05:01] Hallelujah. And Paul said, 'I'm willing
[1:05:04] to go even uh with your messengers to
[1:05:07] Jerusalem if needed. If you want me to
[1:05:09] go with them to make sure the money gets
[1:05:11] there, I'll go with them. So Paul had a
[1:05:14] a very willing spirit to make sure the
[1:05:16] people knew their money was being used
[1:05:18] the right way. Hallelujah. Now verse
[1:05:21] five. Now I will come unto you when I
[1:05:24] shall pass through Macedonia, for I do
[1:05:26] pass through Macedonia,
[1:05:29] and it may be that I will abide yay. Now
[1:05:32] notice he's using may, right? May. We'll
[1:05:34] see later in the second or the in the
[1:05:36] fourth letter, which is the second
[1:05:37] letter to the Corinthians, that Paul had
[1:05:40] to change his plans.
[1:05:42] He said, but notice he uses may and if
[1:05:45] the Lord willing. And it may be that I
[1:05:47] will abide yay in winter with you, that
[1:05:48] ye may bring me on my journey
[1:05:51] whethersoever I go. So that's how the
[1:05:54] old days were with travel. If you got
[1:05:56] stuck one place in winter, you're there
[1:05:58] all winter, right? You're not traveling
[1:06:00] in winter in those days. The roads and
[1:06:02] the vehicles weren't good enough. And
[1:06:04] Paul says, if I go to you and it's
[1:06:05] winter time, I'll have to stay there.
[1:06:09] Now, I like how Paul says this, I'm
[1:06:10] going to come to you. Because some of
[1:06:12] them had pridefully said that Paul would
[1:06:14] not come to them anymore. Remember they
[1:06:16] said that Paul would just write really
[1:06:18] harsh letters, but he wouldn't come to
[1:06:20] see them face to face. But Paul said,
[1:06:22] "No, I'm going to come talk to you face
[1:06:24] to face."
[1:06:26] Because some of them were saying, "Well,
[1:06:27] Paul can rebuke us by letter, but he
[1:06:29] won't come rebuke us to our face." Well,
[1:06:30] we find out later he does. He writes
[1:06:33] about it in the second letter.
[1:06:36] And remember, there was a click in the
[1:06:37] church that did not accept Paul, right?
[1:06:40] That's how you have it. And you know,
[1:06:41] some most churches have a click where
[1:06:43] they don't go along with the pastor.
[1:06:45] Maybe they don't go around with some
[1:06:46] preachers. They don't go along. They
[1:06:48] don't go along with the song service.
[1:06:49] You know, there was a couple years ago
[1:06:50] that there was a certain group at
[1:06:52] another church, not our church, but
[1:06:53] another church. They didn't like how the
[1:06:55] song service was being run. And so, they
[1:06:57] expressed numerous uh times about their
[1:07:00] their desire for it to change. And when
[1:07:01] it didn't change, they just up and left.
[1:07:04] You know, you always have you just have
[1:07:05] clicks sometimes of people that want
[1:07:08] things run their way. Now, if there's a
[1:07:10] sin, then then it's not addressed. Well,
[1:07:12] then yes, I would leave, too. If there
[1:07:14] was a sin and it wasn't addressed,
[1:07:16] right? But now, you know, uh we just
[1:07:19] don't want to uh we just don't want to
[1:07:20] make a click about something, right? We
[1:07:23] just don't want to make a a fuss about
[1:07:25] something if we just have a little
[1:07:26] difference on something and it's not a
[1:07:29] scriptural difference or there's not a
[1:07:30] good reason we should have a difference.
[1:07:33] Okay? So, uh I I think our church is
[1:07:35] pretty good with that by God's grace and
[1:07:36] we're thankful. Like I said, I'm very
[1:07:38] thankful for that that we don't have
[1:07:39] those 10 sins going on in our church.
[1:07:41] Praise God. And we have the same Lord
[1:07:43] Jesus Christ baptism. Amen. The same
[1:07:44] gospel and same revelation, the same
[1:07:47] mysteries finished by the grace of God.
[1:07:49] We're thankful for that.
[1:07:51] Uh but Paul still wants to come see
[1:07:53] them. And we know he does come see them
[1:07:55] as we'll get to in the next book.
[1:07:59] Verse seven, for I will not see you now
[1:08:02] by the way, but I trust to Terry a while
[1:08:04] with you if the Lord permits. So Paul
[1:08:07] was a very mature believer. He said, uh,
[1:08:10] I'll stay with you if God is willing.
[1:08:13] And that's what we want to remember to
[1:08:14] always say. Well, next year I'll do this
[1:08:16] if God is willing.
[1:08:18] &gt;&gt; Right? That shows maturity. It shows
[1:08:20] like you, it shows that you understand
[1:08:23] you can't plan out the future. You're
[1:08:24] doing everything by God's grace.
[1:08:28] So Paul was very mature when he spoke
[1:08:30] about future events. if the Lord's
[1:08:32] willing or by God's grace, if God will
[1:08:34] give me grace, I'll do this or that.
[1:08:37] Verse eight, but I will tarry at Ephesus
[1:08:40] until Pentecost. So, this is this is
[1:08:42] important to know. Paul wrote this
[1:08:44] letter while he was at Ephesus. And if
[1:08:46] you know the book of Acts, well, then
[1:08:47] you can kind of see the time period when
[1:08:50] he wrote this letter.
[1:08:53] And uh so we'll look at that here in the
[1:08:55] scripture by God's grace. Verse nine,
[1:08:58] for a great door and effectual which is
[1:09:00] a powerful door
[1:09:03] or an active door is open unto me and
[1:09:06] there are many adversaries.
[1:09:09] So Paul was there in Ephesus when he
[1:09:11] wrote to the church in Corenth. And
[1:09:14] remember how it all started? 12 people
[1:09:16] receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:18] That that's a great open door. Amen.
[1:09:20] Hallelujah. You get 12 saints that are
[1:09:22] on fire filled with the Holy Ghost.
[1:09:24] That's a great start to a church.
[1:09:25] Hallelujah. Even brother Ram said that
[1:09:27] was the candlestick that John wrote
[1:09:29] about. Remember that was the candlestick
[1:09:32] um that if they didn't keep their first
[1:09:34] love, God would take away their
[1:09:35] candlestick.
[1:09:37] &gt;&gt; God would take the church out of Ephesus
[1:09:39] if they failed to repent. And history
[1:09:40] says a lot of them failed to repent. So
[1:09:42] the church was scattered and the
[1:09:44] believers left Ephesus after I think it
[1:09:47] was 20ome odd years if I'm not mistaken.
[1:09:50] But the move of Ephesus started right
[1:09:53] with 12 receiving the baptism of the
[1:09:55] Holy Ghost. He preached there for three
[1:09:57] years according to Acts 20:31. And
[1:10:00] remember Paul cried on all their necks
[1:10:01] when he left. They were all crying
[1:10:03] because they knew he was going to Rome.
[1:10:05] They'd never see him again. Uh at least
[1:10:07] on this side by by God's grace. But
[1:10:09] right now they're with him in glory.
[1:10:11] Amen. They'll they saw Paul again.
[1:10:13] They're seeing Paul right now. Praise
[1:10:14] God. But it still broke their hearts to
[1:10:16] know that I'll never see him in flesh
[1:10:18] the rest of my days. Bye.
[1:10:22] And church. Now, we get this
[1:10:24] understanding that when God opens a
[1:10:25] door, there might be adversaries or
[1:10:28] there might not be. Now, everyone's
[1:10:30] going to have trials and trouble, but
[1:10:32] some adversaries will be greater than
[1:10:34] others.
[1:10:36] And so Paul says there's going to be
[1:10:37] many there was many adversaries in
[1:10:40] Ephesus,
[1:10:41] but yet God was with him. And remember,
[1:10:43] Jesus himself had to come to Paul to
[1:10:46] tell him stay in Corinth. Yeah. Stay in
[1:10:48] Corinth. preach there. Let's read that.
[1:10:50] Let's go. Let's hit that here. Acts 18.
[1:10:52] I think that would be helpful for you to
[1:10:54] see. In other words, I want you to see
[1:10:57] that. It's Acts 18.
[1:11:00] Because there might be a time that
[1:11:02] you're fearful. There might be a time
[1:11:04] you feel like running away from your
[1:11:05] problems. And if you do, cry out to God
[1:11:08] and God will show you what to do.
[1:11:11] &gt;&gt; Because remember when uh the Roman
[1:11:13] government was going to kill all the
[1:11:14] Christians, I'm sorry, all the Jews in
[1:11:16] Rome. The Bible said they left Rome and
[1:11:19] then they came back when they got a new
[1:11:20] emperor. Okay? So, there's times God
[1:11:23] does scatter us, right? Because of awful
[1:11:26] conditions, maybe fearful conditions.
[1:11:28] But then there's times God wants us to
[1:11:30] stay despite fearful conditions.
[1:11:35] Uh verse 9, Acts 18:9, and this is Paul
[1:11:38] founding the church in Corenth. Verse 9
[1:11:41] says, "Then spake the Lord to Paul in
[1:11:43] the in night by a vision, be not afraid,
[1:11:45] but speak and hold not thy peace." So
[1:11:48] Paul was afraid to speak in Corenth,
[1:11:49] right? But Paul God or Jesus tells him,
[1:11:52] "Don't be afraid. Keep preaching the
[1:11:54] word of God." Verse 10. Now, how how can
[1:11:58] he have courage? Because Jesus is with
[1:12:00] him. How can you have courage because
[1:12:02] Jesus is with you? And no man shall set
[1:12:05] on thee to hurt thee, for I have much
[1:12:08] people in this city. and that he
[1:12:09] continued there a year and six months
[1:12:11] teaching the word of God among them. So
[1:12:15] this was when Paul started the church.
[1:12:17] This was before Paul Paul wrote the
[1:12:19] first of those four letters. So
[1:12:21] everybody see that he wrote four letters
[1:12:23] but Paul founded it here in Acts 18. And
[1:12:26] after he left he wrote the first letter
[1:12:27] then the second letter the third letter
[1:12:29] and then he wrote the fourth letter
[1:12:31] after that.
[1:12:34] And so what did he do? He stayed there a
[1:12:35] year, six, 18 months teaching the word
[1:12:38] of God among them.
[1:12:40] So now church, now you could understand
[1:12:43] if you're ever fearful, should I do this
[1:12:45] or fearful, should I do do that? Should
[1:12:47] I move? Should I stay here? Should I go
[1:12:49] somewhere else? Whenever you're fear
[1:12:51] fearful, cry out to God. And God, if
[1:12:53] he's the same yesterday, today, and
[1:12:55] forever, he'll show you whether to stay
[1:12:57] or go from your fear. And he'll give you
[1:12:59] grace to overcome your fears.
[1:13:01] Hallelujah. So I think that's important
[1:13:03] to see there. Uh and then Paul when he
[1:13:06] went to Ephesus, God called it a or he
[1:13:08] called it a great door. That was a
[1:13:10] powerful active open door to him and
[1:13:14] he'd have many adversaries. Now in
[1:13:17] Akran, I don't I don't know. I'd say we
[1:13:19] maybe have not had many adversaries.
[1:13:20] We've had a few adversaries in Akran,
[1:13:22] but I wouldn't say many because Paul
[1:13:24] gives us a list. Look at this list of
[1:13:26] Paul's uh adversaries out of Acts
[1:13:28] chapter 19 and 20.
[1:13:33] Uh he had to face people's hearts who
[1:13:35] were hardened by unbelief. Hard-hearted
[1:13:38] people. Now, we've had to face that. Uh
[1:13:40] spiritual conflicts. Remember that big
[1:13:42] economic persecution and riot. Remember
[1:13:45] Paul uh cast a demon out of the the
[1:13:47] woman there and it and it caused their
[1:13:50] her owners there to get upset because
[1:13:51] they were going to lose money. Uh and it
[1:13:53] caused a great riot. Remember for two
[1:13:55] hours they shouted, "Great is Diana.
[1:13:57] Great is Diana." They had such a a big
[1:13:59] riot there and Paul was his life was
[1:14:02] threatened. Now our lives have never
[1:14:04] been threat threatened for being
[1:14:05] Christians, have they? So that's why I
[1:14:07] said we might have faced some adversary,
[1:14:09] but we haven't faced many adversaries.
[1:14:12] Brother Chris,
[1:14:26] &gt;&gt; let me see, brother. Yes. Let me see.
[1:14:30] I thought it was, but I could be wrong.
[1:14:32] Let me see.
[1:14:39] Yeah, brother. Yeah. Uh,
[1:14:41] it might not be. Let me check. I thought
[1:14:43] it was, but I could be wrong on that
[1:14:45] one, brother. I remember the Bible said
[1:14:47] he was grieved. So, let me look up
[1:14:48] grieved
[1:14:50] in his spirit.
[1:14:54] Oh, it's Acts 16. So, no brother, I got
[1:14:57] that wrong. So, thank you for that.
[1:14:58] Really helped uh by God's grace. That
[1:15:00] was Acts chapter 16.
[1:15:05] It was verse 18.
[1:15:12] Yeah, this is a different uh he did
[1:15:15] rebuke. Oh, yeah. Evil spirits uh did he
[1:15:19] did deal with evil spirits here
[1:15:22] and exorcist. Let's read that Acts.
[1:15:24] Yeah, we might read the Acts 19:13. Then
[1:15:26] certain of the Vagabond Jews, exorcists
[1:15:28] took upon them to call over them which
[1:15:31] had evil spirits, the name of the Lord
[1:15:33] Jesus, saying, "We adjure you by Jesus
[1:15:35] whom Paul preacheth." Okay? These are
[1:15:36] the seven sons ofKeva.
[1:15:39] Okay?
[1:15:42] And they tried to cast out devils. Those
[1:15:44] devils knew Paul. They knew Jesus, but
[1:15:46] they didn't know the seven sons ofKeva.
[1:15:49] And when people heard about that, the
[1:15:50] Bible said great fear fell upon them. So
[1:15:53] that's verse 17. And this was known to
[1:15:54] all the Jews and Greeks also dwelling at
[1:15:56] Ephesus.
[1:15:59] Okay. Oh yeah. And also Paul Yeah. Uh
[1:16:01] yeah. Let's go back up to verse 12. A
[1:16:03] lot of his handkerchiefs were laid on
[1:16:05] people. They took handkerchiefs from his
[1:16:06] body, laid them on people, and demons uh
[1:16:10] evil spirits went out from them. So
[1:16:12] people got disease or healed from demon
[1:16:14] powers. So devils were cast out just by
[1:16:16] the cloths of Paul's body, you know,
[1:16:19] from his body laying on sick people and
[1:16:20] demonpossessed people. So, good
[1:16:22] question, bro. Yes, good question. Um,
[1:16:24] and then verse 18. And many that believe
[1:16:26] came and confessed and shued their
[1:16:28] deeds. Now, I love verse 19 because they
[1:16:31] they throw all their magical arts books
[1:16:33] in a big pile and they burn it. So,
[1:16:36] again, shows how many people were
[1:16:38] delivered from spirits of witchcraft.
[1:16:40] Verse 19. Many of them also which used
[1:16:42] curious arts brought their books
[1:16:44] together and burned them before all men.
[1:16:46] And they counted the price of them and
[1:16:48] found at 50,000 pieces of silver. So
[1:16:50] mightily grew the word of God and
[1:16:52] prevailed. Hallelujah. So good, good
[1:16:55] question, brother. Good. Let's give them
[1:16:56] to class. Amen. So the other woman was
[1:16:59] in uh I'm already forgetting that one.
[1:17:02] Uh what was it? Yeah, chapter 16. That's
[1:17:05] right. Yes. I didn't turn enough pages.
[1:17:10] Yeah, Philippi. That was in Philippi.
[1:17:12] Yes.
[1:17:14] By God's grace. And then um in Ephesus,
[1:17:17] they cast out demons with the prayer
[1:17:18] cloths. Demons came out just by laying
[1:17:20] them on uh the uh sick and the
[1:17:23] demon-possessed. So, thank you, brother.
[1:17:26] And then he had a near-death experience.
[1:17:28] And also, Ephesus is where he fought the
[1:17:30] beast. Remember we preached on that last
[1:17:31] week. He would be Paul was put into a
[1:17:34] coliseum and had to fight off beasts.
[1:17:37] So, we know by God's grace he didn't
[1:17:39] die, right? God gave him favor. And of
[1:17:41] course, the emotional suffering when
[1:17:43] they left each other, that was what
[1:17:44] we're talking about. They were crying on
[1:17:45] the Christian brothers were crying on
[1:17:47] his neck when they accompanied him to
[1:17:49] the boat where he was going to sail
[1:17:50] towards Rome.
[1:17:52] So, he said many adversaries, right?
[1:17:55] There was many trials. My goodness,
[1:17:58] wrestling animals, uh calls for his life
[1:18:01] to be uh threatened and killed. Uh and
[1:18:05] so we've had adversity in Akran, but
[1:18:08] nothing like that. But remember, brother
[1:18:10] Ram says, "With thus sayith the Lord,
[1:18:11] the same persecution in Rome will come
[1:18:13] to the United States someday.
[1:18:16] We don't know if we have to live to see
[1:18:17] it or not. But either way, God's grace
[1:18:20] will give us power for that hour."
[1:18:22] Right? God's grace, if God gave Paul
[1:18:24] grace, God will give us grace if we have
[1:18:25] to go through that. Uh because God is
[1:18:28] faithful. Amen. Now, I just thought I
[1:18:30] want to look at this thought. I just
[1:18:31] thought saw the scripture about open
[1:18:33] doors and uh these these Christian
[1:18:36] brothers gave wrote a commentary in the
[1:18:38] 1800s and they showed like four
[1:18:40] different verses about open doors in the
[1:18:42] Bible. Uh the Bible said there's a door
[1:18:45] of hope. The Bible says there's a door
[1:18:46] of faith. The Bible says there's an open
[1:18:49] door and the Bible said there's a door
[1:18:51] of utterance. So the reason I go through
[1:18:53] that is just for so you and I we'll see
[1:18:55] opportunities in our lives as open
[1:18:57] doors. So I feel like Malachi got an
[1:19:00] open door to share his testimony there,
[1:19:02] right? And that has opened up
[1:19:03] friendships, right, with other
[1:19:05] individuals. Hallelujah.
[1:19:08] And each one of us whenever we get an
[1:19:09] opportunity to whether it's to testify,
[1:19:11] preach, or even sing, that's an open
[1:19:14] door. God has given us a a channel or an
[1:19:17] opportunity to share the love of Jesus
[1:19:19] Christ. It's open doors. And I just
[1:19:22] thought I would read the I just studied
[1:19:24] a little bit on the the the door of hope
[1:19:26] this morning. In Hosea, God said he was
[1:19:30] going to give Israel a door of hope. And
[1:19:33] she sh she shall sing there as in the
[1:19:36] days of her youth and as in the day when
[1:19:37] she come up out of the land of Egypt.
[1:19:40] Now the door of hope was in the valley
[1:19:42] of Acor which was the same valley. It
[1:19:46] was near the Jordan River uh where Achen
[1:19:49] and his family were swallowed up.
[1:19:52] &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, not swallowed up. They were
[1:19:53] stoned there. That's right. Stoned.
[1:19:56] And so God told Israel many years later,
[1:19:59] I'm going to turn this place of
[1:20:00] destruction and judgment. I'm going to
[1:20:02] turn this into a place of mercy and
[1:20:05] restoration.
[1:20:06] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. So, you know, the
[1:20:09] valley of Acor, in other words, it had a
[1:20:10] negative connotation for all these
[1:20:12] years. Oh, judgment, judgment. But God
[1:20:14] tells Israel in the days of Hosea, I'm
[1:20:16] gonna make this a valley of hope. In
[1:20:18] other words,
[1:20:20] hallelujah. So God's door of hope was
[1:20:23] Israel taking the idols out of their
[1:20:25] mouths. In other words, saying
[1:20:27] worshiping the wrong thing and renewing
[1:20:30] God's covenant among them and making
[1:20:32] them a faithful wife rather than a
[1:20:35] disobedient wife.
[1:20:38] So we see a place of judgment can become
[1:20:40] a place of mercy which is just like
[1:20:43] Ephesus which was just like Corinth.
[1:20:45] Beforehand they were filthy cities but
[1:20:48] the grace of God comes to them and saves
[1:20:51] men and women makes them saints.
[1:20:53] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:20:54] &gt;&gt; And now God has taken a filthy place and
[1:20:57] at least cleaned out a portion of it.
[1:20:58] Hallelujah.
[1:21:00] &gt;&gt; And so Akan used to have a Akran used to
[1:21:03] be a place with no message church but
[1:21:05] now there's a message church.
[1:21:06] Hallelujah. Amen. In other words, God's
[1:21:09] given hope in a very sinful city.
[1:21:12] That's what we see God did with Ephesus.
[1:21:15] That's what God did with Corinth. God
[1:21:17] does it with Akran. God does it with
[1:21:18] Napoleon. God does it with Albian. God
[1:21:21] did it in Sheffield. Hallelujah.
[1:21:25] &gt;&gt; And so God specializes in turning bad
[1:21:28] situations into good ones. We could have
[1:21:30] a bad marriage, but God can turn it
[1:21:32] good. We could have children that go
[1:21:35] against God, but then they turn to
[1:21:36] following God.
[1:21:38] &gt;&gt; We could have a church situation that
[1:21:40] was bad. I I wrote the wrong word there.
[1:21:42] The church the church situation would
[1:21:44] have been bad, but then it turns into
[1:21:45] good.
[1:21:47] &gt;&gt; Work situations, you name it.
[1:21:48] Businesses, whatever uh you know, any of
[1:21:51] your endeavors, any of your talents, it
[1:21:53] it could uh start as something bad, but
[1:21:55] then God can change into something good.
[1:21:58] &gt;&gt; God specializes in that. Hallelujah.
[1:22:04] Now verse 10 he says now if Timothy has
[1:22:07] come to Corenth see that he may be you
[1:22:10] or be with you without fear. So Paul
[1:22:12] knew there was people at Corenth that
[1:22:15] would try to intimidate anyone
[1:22:17] associated with him. And so Paul says if
[1:22:20] he comes don't let people put him in a
[1:22:22] state of fear like they're going to hurt
[1:22:24] or reject Timothy. make sure he feels
[1:22:27] love that he's welcomed at your church
[1:22:30] for he workketh the work of the Lord as
[1:22:33] I also do. So apparently there must have
[1:22:36] been some people at Corinth that would
[1:22:37] try to intimidate the preachers.
[1:22:39] Hallelujah. Tell the preachers what to
[1:22:41] preach, right?
[1:22:44] And then there were even some people
[1:22:45] that would despise anyone associated
[1:22:47] with Paul.
[1:22:49] Let no man therefore despise him, but
[1:22:52] conduct him forth in peace that he may
[1:22:54] come unto me. For I look for him with
[1:22:57] the brethren. Hallelujah. So Paul knew
[1:23:00] there might be people that would
[1:23:01] mistreat anyone associated. They despise
[1:23:04] anyone associated with Paul. And Paul
[1:23:07] said, "Make sure he's given a peaceful
[1:23:09] welcome when he comes to the church."
[1:23:12] Hallelujah. Now, what again, what a what
[1:23:15] an awful situation this church was. Paul
[1:23:17] knew it's possible there could be some
[1:23:19] people that would intimidate anyone
[1:23:22] associated with Paul.
[1:23:24] How sad. What a sad condition that would
[1:23:26] be.
[1:23:29] So Paul says, in other words, give him
[1:23:30] love, brotherly kindness. Don't give him
[1:23:33] harshness. And we love Timothy, don't
[1:23:35] we? He was Paul's spiritual son in the
[1:23:37] gospel. And no one was more likeminded
[1:23:40] to Paul than Timothy.
[1:23:43] Yet we'd say amongst some message
[1:23:46] people, he was a hybrid because he his
[1:23:48] parents were from two different
[1:23:50] nationalities. Right? Now, we wouldn't
[1:23:52] say that, but deceived message people
[1:23:54] would. They would say, "Well, he's not
[1:23:56] fully Jew or he's not fully Greek, and
[1:23:58] he's he's from a mixed marriage or
[1:24:00] something like that." That's only what a
[1:24:02] carnal person would say.
[1:24:04] &gt;&gt; So, I love this. I love how God put it
[1:24:05] there in the scripture. That it doesn't
[1:24:07] matter your parents what nationalities
[1:24:10] they were. It matters that God is your
[1:24:12] spiritual parent. Hallelujah. And so,
[1:24:15] you you could be of mixed uh
[1:24:17] nationalities. You could be from a mixed
[1:24:19] marriage. And think of that. You could
[1:24:21] be from a mixed natural marriage but
[1:24:23] still be most likeminded as the prophet
[1:24:25] of God.
[1:24:27] &gt;&gt; So that's why I love Timothy. He's such
[1:24:29] a wonderful example. And Paul Paul was
[1:24:31] able to recognize, wow, he's he's got
[1:24:33] parents from different nations, yet he's
[1:24:35] still the one who's most focused on the
[1:24:37] message of the hour.
[1:24:40] I take courage from that church. I don't
[1:24:41] know about you, but I take courage from
[1:24:43] that. Praise God. Because uh I I'm I'm
[1:24:46] not associated with William Brandham. I
[1:24:48] never met him. My parents didn't know
[1:24:49] him. My parents were basically uh not
[1:24:52] faithful to church, you know, most of
[1:24:53] growing up most of my life there. But
[1:24:55] even out of that, God can bring
[1:24:57] redemption out of a family maybe that
[1:24:59] doesn't look right, doesn't seem right
[1:25:02] to other people. I want to be most
[1:25:04] likeminded all the Bible writers and
[1:25:07] brother Brandham.
[1:25:08] &gt;&gt; And I think you want that as well.
[1:25:10] Shouldn't every preacher want that?
[1:25:12] Hallelujah. To be most likeminded as the
[1:25:16] authors of the Bible. So I take courage
[1:25:18] from that. I hope you take courage from
[1:25:20] that as well.
[1:25:22] &gt;&gt; That it doesn't matter. Your past
[1:25:23] doesn't matter. What matters is your
[1:25:25] relationship with Jesus right now.
[1:25:29] &gt;&gt; Verse 12. And as touching our brother
[1:25:31] Apollos, I greatly desired him to come
[1:25:34] unto you with the brethren. So Paul was
[1:25:36] hoping the Apollos could come back.
[1:25:38] Remember, he'd already preached there
[1:25:40] and a lot of them loved Apollos.
[1:25:44] He said, "But his will was not at all to
[1:25:46] come at this time. He will come when he
[1:25:48] shall have convenient time or an
[1:25:50] opportunity to to come at the right
[1:25:52] time.
[1:25:54] Now, you remember Apollos, right? He was
[1:25:56] an eloquent preacher. He never
[1:25:57] stuttered. Probably he never spit. You
[1:25:59] know, he was probably just so perfectly
[1:26:01] eloquent. And we're thankful for
[1:26:03] eloquent preachers. I'm not making fun
[1:26:05] of them. I love eloquent preachers. I
[1:26:07] love somebody that can just deliver it.
[1:26:08] There's no stuttering and there's no
[1:26:10] confusion. They don't forget things.
[1:26:12] They just know exactly what they're
[1:26:13] going to say and they say it.
[1:26:14] Hallelujah. I love preachers like that.
[1:26:16] I'll never be one of those, but I love
[1:26:18] preachers like that. Amen. Um, and he
[1:26:21] was mighty, but this is something we can
[1:26:23] all I can strive to be. I can strive to
[1:26:25] be mighty in the scripture. In other
[1:26:27] words, to to give myself to finding the
[1:26:30] word of God, knowing the word of God,
[1:26:32] quoting the word of God, being able to
[1:26:33] rightly divide the word of God as best
[1:26:35] as I possibly can. That's what I strive
[1:26:38] to do.
[1:26:40] And remember, if some had pridefully
[1:26:42] gravitated towards Apollos and then they
[1:26:45] would say at church, "Well, I wish
[1:26:46] Apollos would come.
[1:26:48] I I'd rather have him preach than Peter.
[1:26:52] I'd rather have Apollos than Paul come."
[1:26:55] Pastor, why don't you invite Apollos
[1:26:56] back? We get all these other preachers
[1:26:58] too too much, you know?
[1:27:02] And I'm a follower of Apollos because
[1:27:04] he's the most clear speaker. No doubt he
[1:27:06] was. No doubt he was. But it it it
[1:27:08] shouldn't take that shouldn't cause
[1:27:10] brothers to fight against other brothers
[1:27:12] or sisters. Right
[1:27:15] now, I like here what Paul says too. You
[1:27:17] know, Paul didn't condemn Apollos's
[1:27:20] decision not to come to Corenth at that
[1:27:23] season.
[1:27:25] And church, this is a a principle I've
[1:27:28] actually used a lot down through the
[1:27:30] years, ever since 2013. That was my last
[1:27:31] trip to South America. I had to make a
[1:27:34] decision. They kept inviting me back,
[1:27:35] but I had to make a decision. And I've
[1:27:37] been been invited to India. I've been
[1:27:39] been invited to Africa, different
[1:27:40] places. And I just tell them, I'm sorry
[1:27:42] I can't come now. I'll try to come at a
[1:27:44] convenient season.
[1:27:46] I've got to come at a time where there's
[1:27:48] it's the right opportunity to come.
[1:27:51] And the reason is this is of course
[1:27:53] because of my family. Um I feel like I
[1:27:56] should stay with my family rather than
[1:27:58] travel in evangelism.
[1:28:00] Uh numerous preachers have told me stay
[1:28:02] with your family [clears throat]
[1:28:05] especially especially during the early
[1:28:07] years while your children are young and
[1:28:10] even teenage years.
[1:28:14] Uh because I've had a couple preachers
[1:28:15] warn me, you know, they told me I one
[1:28:18] one in particular said, "I've left my
[1:28:20] children so much that I think it caused
[1:28:22] some of them not to believe."
[1:28:25] and they started hanging around with a
[1:28:27] lot of uh young people that got them
[1:28:30] into porn and movies and worldliness and
[1:28:33] girls wearing pants and makeup
[1:28:36] and uh it's important uh so to me this
[1:28:41] scripture always stuck out to me. I have
[1:28:43] to make sure when I do something uh that
[1:28:46] I'm truly called to do it and I know
[1:28:47] it's God's time and season for me to do
[1:28:49] it. Hallelujah. And you know, another
[1:28:53] opportunity, another example of this is
[1:28:54] I won't invite preachers to come during
[1:28:56] the winter time, you know, if they live
[1:28:58] far away because I don't want them to
[1:28:59] slip on the ice, right? I don't want
[1:29:01] them to I don't want them to have to
[1:29:02] cancel their visit because of snow or
[1:29:04] ice. So, I try to invite maybe brothers
[1:29:07] only uh from really close locations to
[1:29:10] come in the wintertime.
[1:29:13] But I like how Paul was, you know, Paul
[1:29:15] didn't condemn Apollos and say, "Well,
[1:29:17] he didn't want to come and he should
[1:29:18] have came." He understood that there's a
[1:29:21] right time and season for all the
[1:29:22] ministry to be done.
[1:29:25] Now he starts bringing this down to a
[1:29:27] close church here by God's grace.
[1:29:32] Now he starts a new thought here. Now
[1:29:34] isn't this interesting church? You know
[1:29:36] uh he begins closing the letter and he
[1:29:38] says, "Watch ye stand fast in the faith.
[1:29:42] Quit you like men and be strong." He
[1:29:45] gives four uh four we'd say commissions
[1:29:49] in one simple verse.
[1:29:53] But this is powerful advice considering
[1:29:55] there are nine or 10 sin problems. I
[1:29:57] think I added one. Uh so don't pay
[1:29:59] attention to the nine there. I think I
[1:30:00] added 10 there.
[1:30:03] So Paul gives advice, watch, which means
[1:30:06] give strict attention to the your church
[1:30:09] and how the the devil might try to get
[1:30:11] into the church.
[1:30:13] other words, just just like when we're
[1:30:15] driving on the ice out here, right? You
[1:30:16] really got to pay a lot of attention
[1:30:18] while you're driving on ice. I can't
[1:30:20] look at the billboards. I can't look at
[1:30:21] that nice that lawn or that yard or that
[1:30:24] that that business. You got to say,
[1:30:26] "Right, I have your eyes right on the
[1:30:29] road, right? Somebody might stop right
[1:30:30] in front of you, right? Then you got to
[1:30:31] slam on your brakes. You go slide in the
[1:30:33] snow."
[1:30:35] So, it's a good reminder even as I was
[1:30:36] driving today, give strict attention to
[1:30:39] the church. In other words, all of us
[1:30:41] here and those at home need to watch
[1:30:44] what's going on in the church. Are any
[1:30:46] evil spirits trying to get into the
[1:30:47] church?
[1:30:48] Remember, brother Random said, u Satan
[1:30:52] won't let your church stay happy.
[1:30:53] Remember he said that in Christ the
[1:30:56] mystery of God revealed. He said,
[1:30:57] "You're happy now." He said, "But Satan
[1:31:00] won't let you stay that way." He said
[1:31:02] either he'll inject somebody with poison
[1:31:06] injection and then send them into the
[1:31:07] church or he'll go inside the church and
[1:31:10] inject someone with poison and try to
[1:31:12] take the love and the joy out of the
[1:31:14] church. Now, we've just seen that this
[1:31:15] year. But we went we went through
[1:31:17] numerous years where there's just all
[1:31:19] this love and all this joy, which is
[1:31:21] wonderful.
[1:31:23] I took a picture. I might share with the
[1:31:25] church uh
[1:31:28] and maybe I'll put it up uh I'll put it
[1:31:30] up maybe on Wednesday night or something
[1:31:32] like that. But back in 2017, you know,
[1:31:35] there was so much joy and revival. I
[1:31:38] don't know if everybody remembers me
[1:31:39] sharing this picture. When we first got
[1:31:40] back into this sanctuary, we were I
[1:31:43] could just feel the revival and I would
[1:31:45] take pictures like this and every hand
[1:31:47] in the whole church was raised up during
[1:31:48] song service and people were shouting,
[1:31:50] "Brother Andy was the song leader." Now,
[1:31:52] you guys might not remember that, might
[1:31:54] remember that, but there was such a a
[1:31:56] season of joy and victory and revival.
[1:31:59] Uh, and I I would take I would just sit
[1:32:01] back as a pastor and take pictures that
[1:32:03] like, man, what a what a time of
[1:32:05] victory. What a time. You know, some of
[1:32:07] these people, I could tell their
[1:32:08] stories. They didn't have home churches
[1:32:10] and God brought them here and they were
[1:32:11] just on fire. You know, they uh uh and
[1:32:15] some of them had just left churches and
[1:32:17] um some of them had had their marriages
[1:32:19] restored. Some people in here were just
[1:32:22] uh recently coming the message within a
[1:32:24] couple years.
[1:32:27] And so a lot of people had their first
[1:32:29] love when we took those pictures
[1:32:32] and then time happens and then adversity
[1:32:35] comes.
[1:32:36] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And so this is awesome
[1:32:40] advice. This is powerful advice for all
[1:32:42] of us because we're going to go through
[1:32:45] times when oh my everything's it's easy
[1:32:47] to serve God. It's wonderful to serve
[1:32:48] God. Everybody's on fire, but then we're
[1:32:50] going to go through some times where
[1:32:51] there's a lot of adversity and
[1:32:53] difficulty.
[1:32:55] So, this this picture, I just found that
[1:32:57] on the online yesterday and took a
[1:32:59] screenshot like that. So, encap
[1:33:01] encapsulates
[1:33:02] how churches go through different times
[1:33:04] and seasons.
[1:33:07] But in any time and season, this is what
[1:33:09] we need to do. Watch and give strict
[1:33:12] attention to the two spirits in the
[1:33:14] framework of the church.
[1:33:17] And then stand fast in the faith.
[1:33:21] Continue. In other words, continue
[1:33:23] standing in the faith. Don't lay down,
[1:33:24] right? Don't remember the series we
[1:33:26] preach on, we wrestle not against flesh
[1:33:27] and blood. Don't let the devil wrestle
[1:33:29] you down and try to choke out your
[1:33:31] testimony for God.
[1:33:33] So stand right. Don't get wrestled down
[1:33:36] where you have nothing to testify about.
[1:33:38] You have no victory in your life. Don't
[1:33:40] get wrestled down. Stand for the faith.
[1:33:42] Watch for the enemy.
[1:33:44] And then he says, "Quit, you like men."
[1:33:46] And that's not something we'd say uh
[1:33:48] today. But in those days, it meant be
[1:33:50] brave like a man.
[1:33:53] Okay? So don't Yep. You can't be fearful
[1:33:56] amongst evil spirits or people going
[1:33:58] through problems. You got to bravely do
[1:34:00] it. And what's the brave way? Go talk to
[1:34:01] them one- on- one. That's the brave way.
[1:34:05] Don't talk to somebody else about
[1:34:07] somebody else's problem. You go talk to
[1:34:09] that person if you're concerned about
[1:34:10] that person's problems. That's bravery.
[1:34:13] That's real Christian bravery.
[1:34:16] And then he says, "Be strong." So keep
[1:34:19] strengthening. Keep working out
[1:34:20] spiritually. Hallelujah. You might want
[1:34:22] to do it naturally, too. Amen. It's
[1:34:24] helped me a little bit by God's grace. A
[1:34:26] little exercise profits a little. Praise
[1:34:28] God. You get a little bit of profit. But
[1:34:30] look at that. It's a four-fold
[1:34:33] uh encouragement. Watch, stand, be
[1:34:36] brave, be strong.
[1:34:39] And this was spoken to a church with 10
[1:34:41] sins in it, right? 10 sinful situations
[1:34:45] that had to get worked through. So Paul
[1:34:48] is talking to those who are strong, keep
[1:34:50] being strong.
[1:34:52] Try, in other words, try to hold this
[1:34:54] church together because this church has
[1:34:55] a lot of problems.
[1:34:59] And church, if you're honest, this h
[1:35:00] this this this will be helpful in your
[1:35:02] marriage, right? This will be helpful in
[1:35:05] your home life. This will be helpful
[1:35:07] with your family that's not in the
[1:35:08] message.
[1:35:10] &gt;&gt; Do all of this, right? Give strict
[1:35:12] attention to what are the spirits
[1:35:13] working in my family? My brothers, my
[1:35:15] sisters, my mother, my grandparents.
[1:35:17] What spirits are working around here?
[1:35:20] Help me to stand in the faith. Help me
[1:35:22] to be brave. Help me to get stronger.
[1:35:25] Hallelujah.
[1:35:28] Verse 14. Is it any surprise Paul brings
[1:35:32] love back into this? He's gone through
[1:35:34] all their problems and it's like
[1:35:37] circling back. This is all about love.
[1:35:40] Let all thing all your things be done
[1:35:42] with charity.
[1:35:44] And we saw remember charity can bear all
[1:35:47] things.
[1:35:48] &gt;&gt; Charity can suffer through anything,
[1:35:52] right? It won't quit. It won't give up.
[1:35:54] If anything can get through a trial, it
[1:35:58] is the love of God that can get you
[1:35:59] through a trial.
[1:36:02] And remember I think six times brother
[1:36:03] Ram said it in his 1957 uh Sunday school
[1:36:06] message on book of Corinthians book of
[1:36:09] correction charity is your anchor. So as
[1:36:13] all the storms come through this church
[1:36:14] or any church the anchor that will hold
[1:36:18] you is the love of God that will keep
[1:36:21] you from that will keep your ship from
[1:36:23] getting capsized and sinking. Right? The
[1:36:26] love of God.
[1:36:29] Hallelujah. So our anchor is the love of
[1:36:32] God. Verse 15, I beseech you. Now this
[1:36:36] word means to beg or to summon you to
[1:36:38] give you a charge or a commission. I
[1:36:41] beseech you brethren, you know the house
[1:36:43] of Stfanis that it is the first fruits
[1:36:46] of Aaya
[1:36:49] and that they have addicted themselves
[1:36:52] to the ministry of the saints.
[1:36:56] All right. All right. Now, this is the
[1:36:57] only time the word addicted is used in
[1:36:59] the whole Bible. Hallelujah. Now,
[1:37:01] another word for it is stronghold.
[1:37:03] Right? Somebody people can have
[1:37:04] strongholds or addictions in their human
[1:37:07] spirits or in their bodies
[1:37:10] uh possession, demon possession or
[1:37:13] oppression.
[1:37:15] But here Paul gives a good example of
[1:37:17] being addicted. And this is the kind of
[1:37:18] addiction we want to have church.
[1:37:20] Hallelujah.
[1:37:23] Paul says remember the house of Stfanis.
[1:37:26] This must have been a wonderful man of
[1:37:27] God because he became addicted to
[1:37:31] serving the body of Christ.
[1:37:34] Now the modern English definition of
[1:37:37] addiction is unable to stop or I'm
[1:37:41] dependent on that. So Stfanis and his
[1:37:44] house were unable to stop helping the
[1:37:47] the church members.
[1:37:49] So that's what you and I need. We need
[1:37:52] this attitude where I'm just going to
[1:37:53] keep helping.
[1:37:55] I'm not going to stop helping my
[1:37:57] brother. I'm not going to stop helping
[1:37:58] my sister. Hallelujah. I've been
[1:38:01] addicted to the ministry of the saints.
[1:38:06] And it's awesome. So, so it's awesome to
[1:38:08] see despite having all these problems,
[1:38:10] there were some faithful saints that
[1:38:13] were addicted to serving. I'll say like
[1:38:15] this, the love of God had made them
[1:38:17] addicted to serving the saints.
[1:38:20] &gt;&gt; Right? Because we see in verse 14, what
[1:38:21] is it? It's love. Love causes you to be
[1:38:24] addicted to serving the saints. That's
[1:38:26] why you don't quit this church and go
[1:38:27] somewhere else. Well, I'll quit
[1:38:29] pastoring. I'll go somewhere else. The
[1:38:30] love of God makes you addicted and
[1:38:33] faithful to serving the family of God
[1:38:35] where God's called you.
[1:38:38] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Verse 16.
[1:38:42] So now Paul says that ye submit
[1:38:44] yourselves unto such the house of
[1:38:46] Stfanis
[1:38:48] and to everyone that helpeth with us and
[1:38:51] labor.
[1:38:53] Hallelujah.
[1:38:55] So Paul says there's this family in the
[1:38:57] church. They're addicted to serving the
[1:39:00] saints. And Paul says you should all
[1:39:02] follow their example. Amen.
[1:39:06] So see church every family uh every
[1:39:08] believer should be known for doing
[1:39:10] something
[1:39:12] right everybody should have a ministry.
[1:39:14] Tabith Tabatha was known for making alms
[1:39:17] which were making coats and garments.
[1:39:21] Hallelujah.
[1:39:24] uh the faithful widows there in Ephesus
[1:39:27] according to Paul and Timothy they were
[1:39:30] known because they raised children
[1:39:33] they lodge strangers
[1:39:35] they wash the saints feet and they
[1:39:39] relieve the afflicted and more
[1:39:43] hallelujah
[1:39:45] uh
[1:39:47] the Bible says we should be hospitable
[1:39:49] and we should provide the necessities of
[1:39:52] the saints so you should be known as
[1:39:54] someone who's likes to host people. We
[1:39:56] should be known as that. We like to host
[1:39:58] them or we like to provide for them.
[1:40:01] Hallelujah.
[1:40:03] We should all be known for having some
[1:40:06] type of a ministry that's helping out
[1:40:08] the saints. Hallelujah.
[1:40:13] No matter how small it is, church, no
[1:40:15] matter how small it is,
[1:40:19] maybe having a small group Bible study,
[1:40:21] small group prayer, right?
[1:40:23] singing song specials, helping at the
[1:40:25] church with the the technology team.
[1:40:28] Everybody's got a ministry about how
[1:40:31] they can help other people better
[1:40:34] worship the Lord. Now, most of us have
[1:40:36] most of our necessities met, but every
[1:40:38] now and then we have people who need
[1:40:40] food, clothes, their rent paid, their
[1:40:42] bills paid, and so we try to step in and
[1:40:45] help out by the grace of God. That's
[1:40:46] what we're called to do. That that's
[1:40:49] what every Christian should do.
[1:40:52] He said he said uh he told the
[1:40:54] Corinthians submit to the house of
[1:40:56] Stfanis because they have this addiction
[1:40:59] to helping the saints.
[1:41:01] &gt;&gt; In other words, see which family in the
[1:41:03] churches serve the rest of the church
[1:41:06] and just follow help them out.
[1:41:11] &gt;&gt; And even in Rome, remember Phoebe now
[1:41:13] she wasn't a deaconist like they say.
[1:41:15] They got that wrong. There's no such
[1:41:16] thing as a deaconess. A deacon can only
[1:41:19] be the husband of one wife. But she was
[1:41:21] known for securing many. Paul said,
[1:41:24] "Help her in her business because she's
[1:41:27] a secure of many." So my sister Phoebe
[1:41:30] really stood out. She would help out
[1:41:32] those that were sick, afflicted, needed
[1:41:34] food, clothes, help somebody out. She
[1:41:38] was known for that. Just like the house
[1:41:40] of Stfanis was known for helping out the
[1:41:43] saints, being addicted to being
[1:41:44] hospitable.
[1:41:48] So I want to encourage and challenge our
[1:41:50] church. You know what are you known for?
[1:41:53] Who are you known for helping out? What
[1:41:55] what have you done to help out? You
[1:41:56] should be known for helping out somebody
[1:41:59] in the church.
[1:42:00] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[1:42:02] Like I was even telling brother Chris,
[1:42:03] you know how I appreciate brother Chris
[1:42:05] coming so he can lock the door when we
[1:42:07] need it, you know, or he can go open the
[1:42:09] door if somebody needs it. That's super
[1:42:11] helpful, you know, just finding a place
[1:42:14] uh just finding a position to to be
[1:42:16] helpful to help the saints. Praise God.
[1:42:18] Being willing to bring people to church,
[1:42:20] right? I got three open seats or I got
[1:42:21] four open seats in my car or I've got
[1:42:23] six in my van. You know, who needs a
[1:42:25] ride to church?
[1:42:27] That's so helpful.
[1:42:29] And that's what Christians should be
[1:42:31] known for. How can I help out the body
[1:42:33] of Christ? Or maybe you're the one that
[1:42:35] always remembers somebody's birthday. Or
[1:42:38] maybe you're the one that always wants
[1:42:39] to be hospitable and and do a carry and
[1:42:41] lunch and organize that.
[1:42:46] Just be known. We should be known for
[1:42:49] the love of God that we have wanting to
[1:42:52] help out the saints and meet their
[1:42:53] needs.
[1:42:58] Now, this is really hard to read. So,
[1:42:59] I'm sorry. I got this from Chat GTP
[1:43:01] because I heard a preacher say it and
[1:43:02] then I said, "Go search the internet." A
[1:43:04] lot of uh nonprofit organizations were
[1:43:08] actually founded by Christians.
[1:43:11] In other words, Christians are known for
[1:43:14] helping people out. So, you might have
[1:43:17] heard of Samaritan's Purse. That was
[1:43:19] started by a Christian. Uh Franklin
[1:43:21] Graham, he's Billy Graham's son. I think
[1:43:23] he runs that now. Now, I know Billy
[1:43:26] Graham got a lot of false doctrine, but
[1:43:28] the point is Christians are donating
[1:43:30] millions of dollars. And church,
[1:43:32] remember when uh was it North Carolina
[1:43:34] had the hurricane last year? I think it
[1:43:36] was last year. Samaritan's Purse was one
[1:43:40] of the first ones there to bring
[1:43:41] generators in, water bottles, food.
[1:43:45] Remember, even Elon Musk sent his
[1:43:47] satellites and gave them free internet
[1:43:48] access. And some of the people were
[1:43:50] actually saved through that, right?
[1:43:51] Because they they didn't have internet
[1:43:52] access and they were stranded. And so,
[1:43:54] look at that. I mean, that's a good
[1:43:56] that's a good deed.
[1:43:59] Wow. I didn't I forgot about that. Amen.
[1:44:02] And so God sees that. Now works don't
[1:44:04] save us.
[1:44:06] &gt;&gt; But as Christians, when we're saved, we
[1:44:08] want to help out other people. And Paul
[1:44:10] said, "This house of Stfanis, they're
[1:44:12] known for ministering to the saints." He
[1:44:16] said, "All of you should join in with
[1:44:17] them."
[1:44:20] The Salvation Army, that was started by
[1:44:22] a preacher, William Booth. He was a
[1:44:24] preacher. Hallelujah. See, they pres
[1:44:27] they provide disaster relief, medical
[1:44:29] relief, clean water, rebuilding,
[1:44:32] preaching the gospel. They share the
[1:44:33] gospel with people. Uh they provide
[1:44:36] poverty relief, shelter, disaster,
[1:44:39] spiritual care. The YMCA was actually
[1:44:41] now now it's not, but it was started by
[1:44:43] Christians to help the youth to give
[1:44:46] community welfare to people, disaster
[1:44:48] support, operation blessing, volunteers
[1:44:50] of America. Now, I I know Compassion
[1:44:53] International
[1:44:55] uh they uh we sponsor a child through
[1:44:58] them. We send money to a child in
[1:44:59] Uganda. Oh, no, I'm sorry, Rwanda. And
[1:45:02] it gives him and his family food every
[1:45:04] month and then they write letters back.
[1:45:06] Now, I hope it's going with the right
[1:45:08] with the right motive and objective.
[1:45:11] I mean, I'm not for sure. I'm just
[1:45:13] trusting it is. And if not, God sees my
[1:45:16] heart, right? God sees my heart. You
[1:45:18] can't outgive God. God will never let
[1:45:20] any man God will never owe man or God
[1:45:23] will never owe a man anything. If God
[1:45:25] sees your heart and is pure, God will
[1:45:27] reward you for any giving. And then God
[1:45:30] will make those people suffer who were
[1:45:31] lying and stealing. Uh I worked for
[1:45:34] Habitat for Humanity on two of my spring
[1:45:36] break trips down to Florida when I was
[1:45:38] in college. We just worked a few hours
[1:45:40] at this house that they it was under
[1:45:42] construction. I I got a few pictures. I
[1:45:44] was just cutting I had a scroll saw. I
[1:45:46] was just cutting some boards. I was uh
[1:45:48] cleaning out the house, you know, just
[1:45:50] doing little things, nailing down. I put
[1:45:52] a few nails in the in some boards, you
[1:45:53] know, not like Malachi, but just doing a
[1:45:56] little whatever little work I could
[1:45:57] handle as a college student. But that
[1:46:00] was started by a Christian.
[1:46:03] And then the Red Cross uh were started
[1:46:06] by Christians. Now, of course, they're
[1:46:07] mainly woke and political today, but I
[1:46:10] just want to give you an example. Like
[1:46:11] Christians are known for their kindness
[1:46:14] and generosity and for helping out
[1:46:16] people during hard times.
[1:46:21] Now Paul says, "I'm glad of the coming
[1:46:23] of Stfanis." So Stfanis left his home,
[1:46:27] right, to go bring uh the letter from
[1:46:30] the church of Corinth to Paul where Paul
[1:46:33] was at Ephesus. So he left his house
[1:46:36] that was addicted to the serving of the
[1:46:37] saints and he came and delivered this
[1:46:40] letter from the the church at Corinth to
[1:46:43] Paul at Ephesus
[1:46:46] and also fortunat
[1:46:49] aus
[1:46:51] I can't say that exactly right for that
[1:46:54] which was lacking on your part they have
[1:46:56] supplied.
[1:46:58] Okay.
[1:47:01] Now, I don't think Paul's rebuking them
[1:47:02] here in this case, but uh verse 18 says,
[1:47:06] "For they have refreshed my spirit and
[1:47:08] yours." So, Paul said, "Because they
[1:47:11] were always helping people out, they
[1:47:12] refresh them." So, anytime you help
[1:47:15] somebody out, when they need it, it
[1:47:16] brings refreshing to their life, right?
[1:47:19] whether you need a visit, whether you
[1:47:20] need a visit in the hospital, uh whether
[1:47:23] you need food or uh your your rent paid
[1:47:26] or bills paid or something like that.
[1:47:30] He said, "They've refreshed my spirit
[1:47:32] and yours, and therefore acknowledge ye
[1:47:34] them that are such." So Paul says, "Make
[1:47:38] sure you point out and acknowledge these
[1:47:40] people."
[1:47:42] All right? So, uh so the Bible tells us,
[1:47:45] right? What did Jesus say? Don't let
[1:47:47] your right hand know what your left
[1:47:48] hand's doing. Right? So, there's a time
[1:47:51] and season for that. But there's also a
[1:47:53] time where the Bible says, "Be a city on
[1:47:55] a hill and let the whole world see your
[1:47:58] good deeds that they might glorify your
[1:48:00] father which is in heaven."
[1:48:03] And now Paul is saying, "Acknowledge
[1:48:06] them because they've refreshed my
[1:48:08] spirit."
[1:48:10] Okay? So be in other words, remember
[1:48:12] this letter was read in front of the
[1:48:13] whole church.
[1:48:16] So the whole church was going to know
[1:48:18] these brothers refresh our spirits.
[1:48:20] These brothers did a good work. And
[1:48:22] Stefanis's house, they're really given
[1:48:24] to hospitality. They really serve
[1:48:26] people. You should all follow his house.
[1:48:30] See, there's going to come time from the
[1:48:32] pulpit. There may come times from the
[1:48:33] pulpit here. Maybe it's brother Cam or
[1:48:35] me or some other preacher, maybe brother
[1:48:37] Benerrod. He'll point out certain people
[1:48:39] in the church that are doing good
[1:48:40] things. And we shouldn't get jealous of
[1:48:42] that. We should learn from that.
[1:48:45] Because that's what they did in the
[1:48:47] early church. They acknowledge, here's
[1:48:49] the people that are really ministering
[1:48:51] to the saints. Help them out.
[1:48:55] Hallelujah.
[1:48:57] And again, that's what refreshes people.
[1:49:00] What refreshes people is helping them
[1:49:03] out and ministering to their needs.
[1:49:06] As Paul said, I was refreshed by these
[1:49:08] brothers
[1:49:10] because they traveled so far. They
[1:49:12] brought your letter and they refreshed
[1:49:14] my spirit and they refreshed your spirit
[1:49:16] back in Corenth
[1:49:18] and acknowledge that. Make sure you
[1:49:20] point that out. These brother have a
[1:49:21] special ministry in refreshing people,
[1:49:24] helping them out, ministering to the
[1:49:27] needs of the saints.
[1:49:29] Pretty awesome, right? The book of Acts
[1:49:31] church is pretty awesome, isn't it?
[1:49:34] Now, when we think of it, we just think
[1:49:35] of miracles, miracles, miracles, dead
[1:49:36] being raised, paralyzed being raised.
[1:49:39] But this is also part of it, too. Verse
[1:49:43] 19, we're almost done. My the churches
[1:49:47] of Asia salute you. Aquilla and
[1:49:50] Priscilla salute you much in the Lord
[1:49:53] with the church that is in their house.
[1:49:55] So see, in those days, most churches
[1:49:58] gathered in homes, right? They didn't
[1:50:00] have a lot of big buildings like we have
[1:50:03] uh today or big rooms.
[1:50:06] So Aquilla and Priscilla sent their
[1:50:08] greetings to the church in Corinth.
[1:50:11] through Paul and all the churches in
[1:50:13] Asia such as uh Ephesus, Galatia,
[1:50:17] Thessalonica,
[1:50:19] and Rome. And uh 1 Corinthians 16:20,
[1:50:23] all the brethren greet you. Greet one
[1:50:25] another with an holy kiss.
[1:50:29] So all the saints, so you know, you'll
[1:50:31] hear brother Kim say, you know, I send
[1:50:32] greetings from the church and you'll
[1:50:34] hear when I go places, I send greetings
[1:50:36] from the saints in Akan, right? That's
[1:50:37] why we do that because that's what they
[1:50:38] did in the early church.
[1:50:44] Oh yeah.
[1:50:51] Oh my goodness. Oh wow.
[1:50:55] Right. So that's wrong, right? Because
[1:50:56] we know there's more the lips are are
[1:50:59] important part of reproduction, male and
[1:51:02] female, right? So good. Yeah, good
[1:51:04] point. I didn't know that. My goodness.
[1:51:06] Now, some people say in the
[1:51:07] Mediterranean, brother, that the men
[1:51:09] still kiss each other on the cheek. You
[1:51:10] know, they go like this and this and um
[1:51:12] some people say they kiss on the neck.
[1:51:14] Uh but we definitely stay away from the
[1:51:16] lips. Praise God. Uh because that's
[1:51:18] unholy, right? It's got to be a holy
[1:51:20] thing. Uh and so good. I'm glad you
[1:51:22] caught that. Yeah. So, a lot of people
[1:51:25] misunderstand the scripture. Of course,
[1:51:27] their life proves it, right? Their life
[1:51:29] proves it. Uh they deny the word of God
[1:51:31] in so many areas. They add to the word
[1:51:33] of God, like they add the caps and
[1:51:34] everything like that.
[1:51:36] uh they add their whole like most Amish
[1:51:38] have their own books outside the Bible,
[1:51:40] right? That they have to follow all
[1:51:41] these laws. So they're legalists. So
[1:51:44] whenever you have one false doctrine, if
[1:51:46] you don't clean it out, it will produce
[1:51:47] more false doctrines. That's where you
[1:51:49] get their false doctrine on the unholy
[1:51:51] kiss.
[1:51:53] Yes, sir. Very good. Yep. That's this
[1:51:56] letter. This letter. Hallelujah. Verse
[1:51:58] 21. The salutation of me Paul with mine
[1:52:02] own hand.
[1:52:04] Now to understand this church, you can
[1:52:06] see here that uh Paul wrote his own name
[1:52:10] at the end of the letter to confirm that
[1:52:12] he wrote it. Uh remember Paul wrote in
[1:52:15] large letters to the Galatian church and
[1:52:17] I got the I got the Bible verses up here
[1:52:19] if you want to research it on your own.
[1:52:21] You'll see that remember uh Terseius
[1:52:24] wrote the letter to the Romans for Paul
[1:52:27] because his eyes had gotten so bad.
[1:52:29] Terseius had to write it and then Paul
[1:52:31] would sign his name at the end in really
[1:52:33] big letters.
[1:52:35] because his eyes were in such bad
[1:52:36] condition.
[1:52:38] And he says this, if you look up those
[1:52:40] verses, Paul said he signed his name at
[1:52:42] the end to the Corinthians, to the
[1:52:45] Colossians, and the Thessalonicans. He
[1:52:47] couldn't even write with his own eyes.
[1:52:50] So, he has to end it with his signature
[1:52:52] at the end.
[1:52:55] And remember, the Galatians said they
[1:52:56] would have cut out their own eyes and
[1:52:58] given them to Paul because Paul had such
[1:53:01] a bad eye condition.
[1:53:04] Now, what about all these people that
[1:53:05] say, "Oh, God wants to heal all your
[1:53:07] sicknesses.
[1:53:09] The first prophet of God, he didn't get
[1:53:11] his healed, right?"
[1:53:14] So, it just shows they're unbalanced in
[1:53:16] the word of God, right? They're
[1:53:17] preaching a different gospel than what
[1:53:18] Paul preached. Now, that church, that's
[1:53:21] the amazing part, Brother Chris. Paul
[1:53:23] would pray for somebody with bad eyes
[1:53:24] and then they get healed and he
[1:53:26] wouldn't.
[1:53:28] Imagine that. That's why church, I've
[1:53:30] seen preachers, brother Austin, I've
[1:53:32] seen preachers that are disabled and
[1:53:34] they are paralyzed preaching from a
[1:53:37] wheelchair and yet God can still answer
[1:53:40] their prayers, but God keeps them in a
[1:53:42] wheelchair.
[1:53:46] So that that's why church, we never want
[1:53:47] to judge people harshly,
[1:53:49] right? Or too harshly without really
[1:53:51] researching like now why are you in this
[1:53:53] condition? Is it because of sin or is
[1:53:55] God keeping you humble?
[1:53:58] So that's how Paul was. Remember Paul in
[1:54:00] in Paul's later ministry, he traveled
[1:54:02] with Luke. In other words, he tra when
[1:54:04] he would come preach, he'd bring a a
[1:54:06] doctor with him to come preach. Oh,
[1:54:08] there's Paul. He's got his doctor with
[1:54:09] him to make sure he he don't run into
[1:54:11] things, right? You don't bump into
[1:54:12] things, try to nurse him back to health.
[1:54:15] So if if brother Benerod comes in a few
[1:54:17] weeks and he's suffer a little bit and
[1:54:19] bring some medication, well, praise the
[1:54:20] Lord. See, it's God who allows these
[1:54:23] things in our lives.
[1:54:25] And and with Paul, it was to keep him
[1:54:28] humble. But we don't know all the
[1:54:30] reasons that God allows other people to
[1:54:33] suffer and not heal them. It might be
[1:54:36] because of unconfessed sin, but it might
[1:54:38] not be.
[1:54:40] It might just be for humility or some
[1:54:43] other purpose. Or maybe that's the
[1:54:44] sickness that's going to lead to their
[1:54:46] death. And remember, I I told y'all
[1:54:48] about Brother Keith Randolph passing
[1:54:49] away. Remember? Well, he preached for us
[1:54:51] so many times, such a blessing. And he
[1:54:54] told me on the text, he said, "Brother
[1:54:55] Jesse, I think I'm going to come out of
[1:54:56] here and preach again." Well, guess
[1:54:57] what? He never got out, but he wanted
[1:54:59] to, right? So, that sickness eventually
[1:55:02] led to him going home to be with the
[1:55:04] Lord, right? And it wasn't, as far as we
[1:55:07] know, it wasn't anything wrong with his
[1:55:08] life. He hoped to get out of it, but God
[1:55:11] used it. Somehow, God still got glory
[1:55:13] out of that by God's grace.
[1:55:16] &gt;&gt; And church, we don't judge other people
[1:55:17] because we don't know how we're going to
[1:55:18] leave this world
[1:55:20] &gt;&gt; if God carries.
[1:55:22] &gt;&gt; Right? I was thinking about that how
[1:55:23] brother Brandham, you know, died through
[1:55:25] a car accident. What about Mphibichef
[1:55:27] church? He was dropped as a baby. He was
[1:55:30] paralyzed as a baby and then he spent
[1:55:33] the rest of his life paralyzed. And
[1:55:35] people look at him and say, "Oh, he's
[1:55:36] just a paralyzed man." And oh, what an
[1:55:39] awful accident. That shows he's not
[1:55:40] right with God. But we never get that in
[1:55:42] the whole rest of the scripture. He was
[1:55:44] right with God. And then David lets him
[1:55:47] sit at the king's table to end his life.
[1:55:50] You know, accidents happen. God just
[1:55:51] allows accidents to happen,
[1:55:54] right? And we got to really, especially
[1:55:57] with brother Brandham, you know, I'm
[1:55:58] talking talking about people who attack
[1:55:59] brother Brandham. They're attacking the
[1:56:00] way he died. But look at Mib
[1:56:02] Mphibicheth, you know, look at how
[1:56:04] Elisha died. Elisha died of a sickness.
[1:56:06] He had double the miracles Elijah had.
[1:56:07] You'd think he'd go in the rapture. He
[1:56:09] didn't. He died. He did twice the
[1:56:12] miracles as Elijah. What? And with each
[1:56:16] case, you can't judge somebody
[1:56:17] necessarily how they die or accidents
[1:56:20] happening in their lives. You have to
[1:56:21] look at their life that they live for
[1:56:23] Jesus Christ.
[1:56:26] And so you look at Paul and say, "That
[1:56:28] preacher, that's a prophet." And he
[1:56:30] can't even see. He's got to write his
[1:56:31] name real big on a letter and it looks
[1:56:34] like baby writing or it looks like a
[1:56:36] child's writing. That's God hiding
[1:56:39] himself in simplicity. Hallelujah.
[1:56:41] That's God hiding himself in humility.
[1:56:44] Because remember church, when you're
[1:56:46] weak, you're also what?
[1:56:48] &gt;&gt; Strong. That's when you're your
[1:56:49] strongest. When you realize how weak you
[1:56:51] are. And you got to fully depend on the
[1:56:53] Lord.
[1:56:57] And this eye trouble was perhaps his
[1:56:59] thorn in his flesh. He said in 2
[1:57:01] Corinthians 12:7. So you and I can't let
[1:57:03] our physical limitations stop the work
[1:57:05] of God in our lives.
[1:57:08] Paul could have said, "Well, I got bad
[1:57:10] eye trouble. I'm not going to write any
[1:57:11] more letters or I'm not going to travel
[1:57:12] anymore. No, church. He kept he kept
[1:57:14] going. He kept writing letters. He kept
[1:57:16] traveling.
[1:57:18] &gt;&gt; Just because a physical limitation makes
[1:57:20] it hard doesn't mean you quit.
[1:57:23] &gt;&gt; You keep doing what God called you to
[1:57:25] do.
[1:57:26] &gt;&gt; We humbly serve God's purpose. No matter
[1:57:29] how hard it is,
[1:57:31] &gt;&gt; it wasn't easy for Paul to write
[1:57:32] letters. It wasn't easy for him to
[1:57:34] travel, but he kept doing the word of
[1:57:36] God. In other words, let's not look for
[1:57:37] excuses to stop doing what God's called
[1:57:39] us to do. Let's do it. Hallelujah. Let's
[1:57:42] be strong. Quit you like men.
[1:57:43] Hallelujah.
[1:57:44] &gt;&gt; Watch. Stand therefore in the faith.
[1:57:46] Hallelujah.
[1:57:48] Paul's such a mighty example of this.
[1:57:52] Here we come. Come down to the last few
[1:57:53] verses here. Now, how long how long have
[1:57:56] I been preaching? I didn't set my timer.
[1:58:00] Over an hour. Really? Okay. Hard to
[1:58:01] believe that. Mercy.
[1:58:04] Doesn't seem like that.
[1:58:07] Now, over the years, you might have
[1:58:08] heard people say Marinatha, right? Like
[1:58:11] you hear different denominations.
[1:58:12] There's al also a Marinatha church. I've
[1:58:14] heard of that.
[1:58:16] Oh, yeah. It's right down the road. Yes.
[1:58:17] Amen. That's right. That's why I thought
[1:58:18] about it, but I forgot it was close. And
[1:58:20] I always wonder where does that come
[1:58:21] from? It comes from Paul's letter. Now,
[1:58:24] Paul is finishing up this letter to the
[1:58:26] Corinthians, and he says, "If any man
[1:58:28] love not or if any man hates the Lord
[1:58:30] Jesus, let him be ananthemma marinatha.
[1:58:35] Now the word ananthemma means accursed.
[1:58:39] In other words, Paul says, "If any man
[1:58:42] not loves not the Lord Jesus,
[1:58:44] he's cursed. Come Lord Jesus." In other
[1:58:47] words, come Lord Jesus. Whether people
[1:58:49] love him, whether people hate him, Jesus
[1:58:52] is coming back. Hallelujah. And it
[1:58:55] seemed like there were some people in
[1:58:56] the church that didn't like Jesus,
[1:58:58] right? They because you know one reason
[1:59:01] they don't like Jesus if they don't like
[1:59:03] he who Jesus sent.
[1:59:06] Amen. Right. And most people that don't
[1:59:09] like brother Brandham I have a have a
[1:59:10] hard time believing they actually love
[1:59:12] Jesus. If they don't like brother
[1:59:13] Brandham.
[1:59:15] Hallelujah. Because the same thing is
[1:59:16] true with Paul. People didn't like Paul
[1:59:18] in the church. They didn't want Paul to
[1:59:20] come back. They doubted him. They he's
[1:59:22] not going to come back.
[1:59:24] And Paul realizes, see, they if they
[1:59:26] hate me, they probably hate Jesus. But
[1:59:28] either way, come Lord Jesus. May Jesus
[1:59:30] return for his bride.
[1:59:34] So you'll hear saints say Marinatha. It
[1:59:36] just means come Lord Jesus, come. Either
[1:59:38] way, come Lord Jesus.
[1:59:40] It's like during co people would say
[1:59:42] Marinatha, right? We got masks on. We're
[1:59:45] wondering what's going to happen, who's
[1:59:47] going to die.
[1:59:48] And some people said, "Well, just come,
[1:59:50] Lord Jesus." My this is such an awful
[1:59:53] condition. We want you to come back,
[1:59:54] Jesus. And church they've been saying
[1:59:56] that since the days of Corenth believes
[1:59:59] believers have been saying Marinatha
[2:00:02] come Lord Jesus like John said come
[2:00:04] quickly.
[2:00:06] So he ends the letter by saying if you
[2:00:08] do not love Jesus you're cursed. He said
[2:00:11] but come Lord Jesus. But he's not done.
[2:00:14] I love that he's not done.
[2:00:18] [clears throat]
[2:00:20] Just so you know, anathema
[2:00:23] means a cursed to bind under a great
[2:00:26] curse. That's the definition. Just so
[2:00:28] you know.
[2:00:30] Last two verses. Hallelujah. We made it
[2:00:32] to the end. The grace of our Lord Jesus
[2:00:35] Christ be with you. So what does he
[2:00:36] leave them with? The same thing he
[2:00:38] started them with. Grace. Verse three,
[2:00:42] Paul gives grace to the Corinthians. So
[2:00:44] he starts it and ends it the same way.
[2:00:47] Grace. And remember, grace is unmmerited
[2:00:50] favor. It is just God's favor given to
[2:00:52] you and I, and we don't even deserve it.
[2:00:56] &gt;&gt; Uh, does the church in Corinth deserve
[2:00:58] God's grace? No. They got a lot of
[2:01:00] problems. Do we deserve God's grace? No.
[2:01:03] We've got problems, too. Hallelujah.
[2:01:06] That's why we want to look at it. That
[2:01:08] we've all got problems. Yet, we can
[2:01:10] still be a book of Acts church. I have
[2:01:11] started by a prophet and started by
[2:01:13] supernatural means. And God has numerous
[2:01:15] people in this city that are saved. We
[2:01:17] got the right baptism and we understand
[2:01:18] the word of God. The mystery of God's
[2:01:20] been revealed. Our hearts are turned
[2:01:22] back to the apostolic fathers. Amen.
[2:01:24] &gt;&gt; But we still got problems. We still need
[2:01:26] God's grace.
[2:01:29] And the very last verse, he says, "My
[2:01:31] love be with you all in Christ Jesus. So
[2:01:36] be it." Hallelujah. Amen. So we are we
[2:01:39] learn church, Paul wants his love to be
[2:01:42] with the church as well.
[2:01:44] And we learn love is corrected because
[2:01:46] Paul didn't Paul didn't uh ignore their
[2:01:49] sins. Paul called them out in the
[2:01:51] letter.
[2:01:52] He said, 'I heard from the house of
[2:01:54] Khloe, there's divisions among you.
[2:01:57] Right? I heard some man is sleeping with
[2:02:00] his stepmom and some of you aren't even
[2:02:01] sad about it. I heard some women are
[2:02:04] shouting out questions during the
[2:02:06] meeting and trying to preach.
[2:02:10] And I heard there's just unlimited
[2:02:12] tongues interpretations and people are
[2:02:14] walking in feeling like they're
[2:02:16] barbarians. They don't even know what's
[2:02:17] being spoken. Stop it.
[2:02:20] &gt;&gt; Clean it up.
[2:02:21] &gt;&gt; And yet I love you.
[2:02:23] &gt;&gt; Because that's what a real Christian
[2:02:25] does.
[2:02:26] &gt;&gt; A real Christian is able to tell you
[2:02:27] where they disagree with you, right? Or
[2:02:29] where you're wrong and still love you.
[2:02:33] &gt;&gt; So, right. So you you can say that you
[2:02:34] can tell somebody you're wrong on this,
[2:02:36] but I still love you and God has grace
[2:02:38] on you.
[2:02:40] Praise God. Because that's what Paul
[2:02:42] does. Even if it hurts, a Christian will
[2:02:45] say that, "I truly love you. May God's
[2:02:48] grace be upon you." But these areas you
[2:02:50] got to clean up in your life.
[2:02:53] And then if you truly love them, you'll
[2:02:56] accept the correction over time, right?
[2:02:59] Because we're not always ready to give
[2:03:00] up our or overcome our battles right at
[2:03:03] the moment. It's called out if we're all
[2:03:05] honest. Amen.
[2:03:08] And then we'll stay with the family of
[2:03:10] God. We won't get upset and leave them
[2:03:13] because charity is the greatest gift.
[2:03:16] And charity is the bond or glue that
[2:03:19] holds our church together. And church is
[2:03:21] the glue that will hold your marriage
[2:03:23] and your family together.
[2:03:25] That's why
[2:03:27] uh some people can stay so faithful, you
[2:03:30] know, to their local church.
[2:03:32] I can see how a pastor, you know, can
[2:03:34] stay at a church 30, 40, 50 years
[2:03:36] because the same love I need to keep my
[2:03:39] family and my marriage together is the
[2:03:40] same love we need to keep the church
[2:03:41] together.
[2:03:44] I've been married over 22 years, right?
[2:03:46] I'll be pastoring this church in 20
[2:03:48] years coming up in June. How can you
[2:03:49] stay there 20 years through the ups and
[2:03:51] the lows? Because love holds me together
[2:03:53] with the people.
[2:03:55] &gt;&gt; Love is the glue that holds me together
[2:03:57] with everybody. Love keeps us together
[2:04:01] through the good times, through the
[2:04:03] mountain tops, right? Through the
[2:04:04] valleys.
[2:04:06] It's love that holds us together.
[2:04:09] And if you have love, Paul says, above
[2:04:12] everything else, he told the Colossians,
[2:04:14] put on love because it's the bond, and I
[2:04:17] wrote the wrong word. It's the not body,
[2:04:18] it's the bond of perfectness.
[2:04:21] So, other words, love will keep
[2:04:23] everything together perfectly. Love will
[2:04:25] help us to stay united.
[2:04:28] Paul told the Ephesians, "With all
[2:04:30] loneliness of mind, all longsuffering,
[2:04:33] forebear one another." In other words,
[2:04:34] put up with each other in love. Keep the
[2:04:37] unity of the spirit in the bond of
[2:04:39] peace.
[2:04:41] He says, "Love,
[2:04:43] when you speak it, love will help you
[2:04:45] grow up into all things, and every
[2:04:47] believer will supply what the other one
[2:04:49] has need of."
[2:04:53] He says, "Gss are useless without love,
[2:04:56] but with love, gifts are powerful, and
[2:04:59] love holds on. Love bears all things.
[2:05:01] Love never fails." And he says, "Love
[2:05:05] will fulfill the whole law and will
[2:05:07] never work ill to its neighbor."
[2:05:10] That's what love does. Hallelujah. Now,
[2:05:14] I'm going to stop right there. I might
[2:05:15] preach this on Wednesday. Let's stand to
[2:05:16] our feet and Malachi can come here by
[2:05:19] the grace of God. Well, I'm excited as a
[2:05:21] pastor. I finished that series. Amen.
[2:05:23] After 30 sermons. Hallelujah. It's
[2:05:26] awesome to get through that. Don't you
[2:05:27] love just going through the Bible like
[2:05:28] that slowly? I just love it. I love I
[2:05:30] love comparing this verse with that
[2:05:32] verse and this quote with that quote.
[2:05:35] It's such a blessing by God's grace. And
[2:05:37] how many uh believe that the message for
[2:05:39] this book is clearly about charity,
[2:05:42] right? It's clearly about love. Love.
[2:05:45] The Bible says love will cover over a
[2:05:47] multitude of sin.
[2:05:49] Hallelujah. This church had a multitude
[2:05:52] of sin.
[2:05:53] I mean, big- time sin. Sins I've never
[2:05:57] seen in Akran. I've never seen anybody
[2:05:59] walk in here drunk. As far as I know, no
[2:06:02] one's ever had that sexual immorality in
[2:06:04] our church like it they had in their
[2:06:05] church.
[2:06:07] So far, as by God's grace, no one's ever
[2:06:10] sued anybody in here.
[2:06:12] But yet, we still have problems.
[2:06:15] So if love kept that church together,
[2:06:17] love can keep our church together.
[2:06:20] Hallelujah. Let's have a word of prayer.
[2:06:23] Father God, we thank you for today. God,
[2:06:25] thank you for bringing us to the end of
[2:06:26] this series, Lord God. What a blessing,
[2:06:28] God. Hallelujah.
[2:06:30] Thank you for the bond of love, Lord
[2:06:32] Jesus.
[2:06:33] Lord, as I look at that picture from
[2:06:35] 2017 and I saw all those couples [music]
[2:06:37] and families on fire, fresh young
[2:06:40] believers in the message,
[2:06:43] Lord, it makes me happy [music]
[2:06:46] to see, Lord, what a beautiful season
[2:06:47] that was.
[2:06:50] And Lord, it makes me happy, Lord, even
[2:06:51] today to look out and see those [music]
[2:06:53] saints that could be here. Also to know
[2:06:55] that numerous saints are live streaming
[2:06:57] the services. It made me happy last
[2:07:00] Sunday to see all the [music] saints
[2:07:01] when brother Cam was here and brother
[2:07:04] Cam sure enjoyed the fellowship and the
[2:07:05] worship
[2:07:08] commented about it as well. Makes me
[2:07:10] happy to see the saints who stay bonded
[2:07:13] together through your [music] love
[2:07:15] through charity.
[2:07:17] Lord I just pray your love would bind us
[2:07:19] together [music] Lord God
[2:07:22] more and more Lord Jesus.
[2:07:25] Lord, may we addict ourselves to serving
[2:07:28] one another. How could I serve [music]
[2:07:29] my brother? How can I serve my sister?
[2:07:32] Let every person be known for some type
[2:07:34] of a ministry. As we've said [music] it
[2:07:36] many times before, what gifts do we
[2:07:38] have? What ministries do we have? And
[2:07:41] God, may we [music] be faithful to those
[2:07:43] ministries.
[2:07:47] Lord, may each person find their place
[2:07:49] in the body [music] of Christ. I ask
[2:07:51] you, Lord God.
[2:07:53] Lord, it's true.
[2:07:56] Love [music] can bear all things. Love
[2:07:58] can hope all things. Love can endure all
[2:08:01] things. As a pastor, love has endured
[2:08:05] over [music] 22 years in my marriage.
[2:08:08] As a pastor here, love has endured
[2:08:11] almost 20 years. Lord God,
[2:08:16] with my job as a teacher, Lord, love has
[2:08:19] endured over [music] 23
[2:08:22] classes, I believe.
[2:08:25] Lord, love just [music] endures
[2:08:28] and it works no ill toward its neighbor,
[2:08:30] Lord God. Lord, [music] may we put on
[2:08:33] the bond of love today, Lord Jesus.
[2:08:35] Hallelujah.
[2:08:37] Lord, your love kept this church
[2:08:38] together [music] despite all the 10 sins
[2:08:40] we saw in Corenth. Lord, we have sins in
[2:08:43] our church, too. We're not perfect, Lord
[2:08:45] God.
[2:08:47] But may your love help us to confess our
[2:08:48] sins, [music] Lord. Live true one to
[2:08:51] another, Lord Jesus.
[2:08:54] Then your spirit will move amongst us,
[2:08:55] Lord God, for your glory, Lord God. Do
[2:08:58] great things, [music] God. Great and
[2:08:59] mighty things that we don't know about.
[2:09:02] Hallelujah. You've done it before.
[2:09:04] You'll do it again, Lord God.
[2:09:07] So strengthen us here today, Lord God.
[2:09:09] Bless those that faithfully came out to
[2:09:10] the house of the Lord and [music] bless
[2:09:11] those that stayed home, Lord God.
[2:09:13] Staying safe, Lord. Hallelujah. Let your
[2:09:16] spirit be with them in their homes, Lord
[2:09:17] God, this beautiful Sunday [music] that
[2:09:19] we have, Lord God.
[2:09:23] Father, all this wisdom in the books of
[2:09:25] the Bible, Lord, all this teaching,
[2:09:28] [music] Lord, that's thus sayeth the
[2:09:29] Lord, I pray we could apply it, Lord,
[2:09:31] incrementally to our lives. we'd go from
[2:09:34] grace to grace, [music] from glory to
[2:09:36] glory. Hallelujah.
[2:09:39] Let the peace of God rule our hearts
[2:09:42] through the love of God.
[2:09:44] I ask [music] all these things, all
[2:09:46] these blessings upon our church in Jesus
[2:09:48] Christ's name. And the saints said,
[2:09:51] "Amen." Let's thank God for today.
[2:09:52] Hallelujah. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Thank
[2:09:54] you for your love, oh God. Thank you,
[2:09:56] Lord God. I love you, Lord Jesus.
[2:09:59] Amen. I came to worship. Let's sing
[2:10:01] that. Hallelujah.

[2:22:25] so true. Heavenly Father, as we close
[2:22:26] the service, [music] Lord, we thank you
[2:22:28] for today. My life, every life here,
[2:22:31] every life on the live stream is [music]
[2:22:32] worth the living because you live.
[2:22:36] We read that where Paul said it. If you
[2:22:39] did not rise, we are men [music] most
[2:22:41] miserable. But if you rose, and you did,
[2:22:44] we have a living hope, Lord God.
[2:22:47] Hallelujah. It is sure and steadfast. We
[2:22:50] must raise again, [music] Lord God.
[2:22:52] There must come a second resurrection.
[2:22:55] Hallelujah. There must come a rapture
[2:22:58] because you live, Lord God. [music] We
[2:23:00] know you live because your spirit moves
[2:23:02] among us. Hallelujah. You've given many
[2:23:05] infallible [music] proofs when you
[2:23:07] raise, Lord God. And you still give
[2:23:09] proofs that you're alive and well,
[2:23:10] healing, saving, filling with the Holy
[2:23:12] Ghost, the gifts of the spirit, Lord
[2:23:14] God. You give [music] many infallible
[2:23:16] proofs. So we thank you, God, for your
[2:23:18] mercy and grace. Lord, bless our church,
[2:23:21] Lord, with the love of God. May charity
[2:23:22] be the bond of perfectness in this
[2:23:25] church, God.
[2:23:27] Lord, we just ask for better weather
[2:23:29] that we could gather on Wednesday, Lord.
[2:23:33] And then next Sunday, Lord, should you
[2:23:34] terry, God, we look forward to the
[2:23:36] Christmas season, Lord, of giving gifts,
[2:23:38] Lord, to [music] our family and friends,
[2:23:40] God, and remembering the ultimate gift
[2:23:42] that was given. Hallelujah. The greatest
[2:23:44] gift that was ever given, God sending
[2:23:47] [music] his son Jesus to save our souls.
[2:23:49] Hallelujah. We do all things in
[2:23:51] remembrance of that, Lord God. that
[2:23:53] [music] great gift of Jesus Christ.
[2:23:57] So we thank you for today, Lord. Bless
[2:23:58] our [music] day. May the mothers get
[2:24:00] rest especially, Lord God.
[2:24:03] May we be refreshed, Lord, heading into
[2:24:05] this work week, Lord. And may you anoint
[2:24:08] us and give us strength.
[2:24:10] Help us, Lord, to be strong, quit
[2:24:12] [music] you like men. May we stand in
[2:24:15] the faith, Lord God. Hallelujah. May we
[2:24:18] watch, Lord, for afflictions.
[2:24:20] Hallelujah. May we stand with the love
[2:24:22] of God until you return in Jesus
[2:24:25] Christ's [music] name. And the saint
[2:24:26] said, "Amen." God bless you, saints.
[2:24:28] You're dismissed.
