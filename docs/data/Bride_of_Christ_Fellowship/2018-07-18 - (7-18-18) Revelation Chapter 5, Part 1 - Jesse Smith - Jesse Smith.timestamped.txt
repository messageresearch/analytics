[18:27] walked out there and she said you know
[18:28] I've been praying that God would send me
[18:30] a church that has love and she said I've
[18:33] heard in all these churches she says
[18:34] I've seen all the gifts of God but I
[18:36] haven't seen love and she said then your
[18:38] pamphlet
[18:39] your postcard came in the mail and she
[18:41] said I saw your big smile I came here
[18:43] and said you guys have the love of God
[18:46] so that's a that's a wonderful testimony
[18:48] that the Lord you know led us to send
[18:51] those out here and hopefully she comes

[35:20] continue this revelation series by the
[35:23] grace of God tonight there's all kinds
[35:26] of different ways I wanted to go there's
[35:28] all kinds of things I want to study and
[35:29] preach I want to get back to that
[35:34] Ephesians series and I want to continue
[35:39] on the wisdoms series I'm still reading
[35:40] on all those and then I want to do a
[35:43] little series on numbers because I've
[35:44] been studying numbers in the Bible and
[35:46] I've been emailing with sister Wendy a
[35:48] little bit about that and just you know
[35:49] different numbers you see in the Bible
[35:50] like 5 and different ones you know they
[35:52] all have meaning so anyways but I just
[35:56] felt led this I was praying this morning
[35:58] and so forth and I just kind of felt led
[36:00] to come to this Revelation chapter 5 I'd
[36:03] like to preach all the way through the
[36:04] book of Revelation if God would help me
[36:06] so we'll see what the Lord has for us
[36:09] here tonight amen
[36:10] Revelation chapter 5 verse 1 I'm just
[36:12] going to read verse 1 because I don't
[36:14] know if we'll make a bass verse 1
[36:16] because what I've done is I've listened
[36:18] to brother Branham preached Revelation
[36:20] chapter 5 there's two parts on it
[36:21] they're both in June of nineteen and a
[36:24] sixty-one and so I'm just going slowly
[36:26] through there and then just pulling out
[36:28] and listen to what he says the the
[36:30] things he emphasizes and I'm just going
[36:32] to preach those by the grace of the Lord
[36:34] and I'm gonna inject some other things
[36:36] to that brother Ram has said of course
[36:38] throughout the entire message but that's
[36:39] where I'm starting I'm starting with
[36:40] revelation 5 from 1961 as my my outline
[36:44] that's my inspiration and then as
[36:46] inspiration comes then I just add to it
[36:49] from other places in the message
[36:50] revelation 5 verse 1 if you're there say
[36:53] Amen let's read it together just one
[36:56] verse let's read on three one two three
[36:58] and I saw in the right hand of him that
[37:01] sat on the throne a book written within
[37:04] and on the backside sealed with seven
[37:08] seals let's have a word of Prayer if you
[37:10] ever need on your heart just making on

[38:50] wrong so this is a video right off of
[38:52] YouTube everybody can watch it watch
[38:55] this video and see how it's a one-world
[38:59] religion that the Pope is pushing it's
[39:02] it's plain to see when everybody see I
[39:04] don't know if you have seen it I saw I
[39:06] shared with brother Simon I don't know
[39:07] if he didn't actually text me back to
[39:09] let me know if he watched it but if you
[39:10] haven't seen this you're gonna be
[39:11] shocked you're gonna see the Pope kiss
[39:13] another religions holy book I forget I
[39:15] don't know which religion it was but he
[39:17] bends down and kisses their holy book
[39:18] and does all you know all kinds of
[39:20] things who he shouldn't do that's
[39:23] because he's not God's messenger but you
[39:26] know we don't say that arrogantly we
[39:27] just say if actually okay so hopefully
[39:29] this is loud enough here so most of the
[39:34] planet's inhabitants declare themselves
[39:35] believers this should lead to dialog
[39:39] among religions we should not stop
[39:45] praying for it and collaborating with
[39:46] those who think differently I have
[39:50] confidence in Buddha I believe in God I
[39:54] believe in Jesus Christ I believe in God
[39:56] Allah many thing differently feel
[39:59] differently seeking God or meeting God
[40:05] in different ways in this crowd in this
[40:08] range of religion there is kissing
[40:10] whatever that is in this crowd in this
[40:12] range of religions there's only one
[40:14] certainly that we have for all we're all
[40:18] children of God
[40:23] I believe in love I believe in love I
[40:29] believe in love go feeling both I hope
[40:35] you will spread my prayer requests this
[40:36] month this was from January 2016 sincere
[40:40] dialogue among men and women of
[40:42] different faiths they produce the fruits
[40:46] of peace and justice
[40:48] I've confidence in your prayers
[40:51] alright we're not gonna clap after that
[40:53] one so don't clap that's right from the
[40:58] tri from the Pope's worldwide the Pope
[41:01] video org you can go check it out if you
[41:02] want okay so I don't want to see that
[41:06] all right it just they automatically
[41:09] play stuff and I thought I shut that off
[41:11] but okay I just want to follow up was
[41:13] that does that help by God's grace it's
[41:15] so obvious to the believer in church it
[41:19] ought to give us confidence that we will
[41:20] not be left behind in the tribulation
[41:23] amen glory we are walking in the light
[41:28] we are not walking in darkness that
[41:31] doesn't appeal to me at all because I
[41:33] know behind all those I love yous I love
[41:34] yous I know they don't love this word
[41:38] and don't get me wrong I love them with
[41:40] a cry see love where you love your
[41:42] enemies we do love them but we do not
[41:45] love their lies the Muslims reject the
[41:48] blood of Jesus Christ that means they've
[41:50] rejected the atonement so our Jews
[41:52] they'd rejected the atonement right now
[41:55] of course we know they can be saved
[41:56] because they've been blinded but the
[41:57] Muslims have not been blinded they're
[41:59] purposely blinded by the god of this
[42:01] evil age amen so what we need to do is
[42:04] we just clean closer to the Word of God
[42:06] stay more true to God and understand
[42:09] that true oneness is obedience to God's
[42:11] Word this word the one word the one
[42:15] faith amen
[42:16] so hope that's a help by God's grace and
[42:18] you can share that with your friends
[42:19] I've shared it with numerous people and
[42:21] I hope it was a blessing by God's grace
[42:23] Oh revelation 5 part 1 this is part 79
[42:29] of the series so we're thankful for the
[42:31] progress that God has given us amen I'm
[42:34] just gonna you know as I started setting
[42:35] this I'm like well I'm just gonna go one
[42:37] verse that
[42:37] I don't think we're gonna finish verse
[42:39] one tonight because brother Adam said so
[42:41] much if you if you listen to the message
[42:43] he says so much about the book of
[42:45] redemption and the book and the seals
[42:48] and everything like that so I'll
[42:49] probably just have time to you know just
[42:52] start this here tonight and keep it
[42:54] going so let me just pull up the
[42:57] scripture here verse one revelation five
[43:05] verse one and I saw in the right hand of
[43:08] him that sat on the throne a book
[43:11] written within and on the backside
[43:15] sealed with seven seals so just look at
[43:18] this scripture tonight and try to show
[43:22] you what the prophet of God said about
[43:24] it by God's grace I plan to preach on
[43:26] the Seventh Seal tonight and the seven
[43:29] thunders I hope you brought your
[43:30] spiritual caps both RAM said your
[43:33] spiritual understanding caps it's so
[43:35] simple Church and I had I've had people
[43:37] all over this nation this week contact
[43:40] me and say thank you for the clearness
[43:42] and the simpleness of your teachings I
[43:44] just had somebody call me today and say
[43:46] thank you that your videos teach the the
[43:49] gospel in such clarity they said it's so
[43:52] simple and that I'm not saying that to
[43:53] brag I'm saying that because brother
[43:55] Branham said God is revealed in
[43:56] simplicity it's not to be so deep and
[43:59] mysterious what needs to be done is we
[44:02] need to say God clear out my thoughts of
[44:03] all my previous thinking and help me
[44:05] just to believe what the Word of God
[44:07] says amen and then help me to understand
[44:09] brother Graham's quotes cuz he was a man
[44:10] you know he has his thoughts changed on
[44:13] different things like the white horse
[44:14] riders a very easy example to see we got
[44:18] to say Lord help me just to see the
[44:19] simplicity behind it all and so I hope
[44:21] you'll see the simplicity behind it
[44:23] tonight by the grace of God how many
[44:25] want simplicity in their lives
[44:27] I think if church I think if you
[44:30] honestly look at the quotes you're gonna
[44:32] see how simple it is by the grace of God
[44:35] now remember brother Branham said that
[44:38] the right hand of God in heaven is not a
[44:40] literal right hand it's a place of
[44:44] authority can everybody say Amen in
[44:47] other words we don't have God the Father
[44:48] standing there and he's got his hands on
[44:50] a throne and he's sitting
[44:51] open like this and then Jesus is you
[44:53] know sitting Jesus sitting on Daddy's
[44:56] right hand that's that's not what it is
[44:58] and there's not even two Thrones because
[45:00] the Bible said there's only one throat
[45:02] amen
[45:02] there's 24 Thrones for the 24 elders but
[45:05] then Bible said there's one thrown by
[45:08] the grace of God we've preached on that
[45:10] as we've led up to this point there's
[45:12] only one throne and so this is symbolic
[45:16] here I saw on the right hand of him who
[45:17] sat upon a throne a book so there must
[45:19] have been a book somehow floating or
[45:23] somehow on the throne there must have
[45:25] been at some how because it wasn't a
[45:27] literal right hand and at this point
[45:30] John has not even seen the lamb yet I
[45:33] mean know what I'm talking about because
[45:34] the lamb comes out later brother Graham
[45:36] stood where was the lamb
[45:38] he said the lamb was back in the
[45:39] intercession booth interceding for the
[45:42] sins of you and I men hallelujah so John
[45:46] doesn't even see the lamb so he sees a
[45:48] throne it must be empty or maybe there's
[45:52] there's light and rainbows and
[45:53] lightnings and thunderings and all these
[45:54] things there but there's a book there
[45:57] there's a book at the right hand or you
[45:59] say at the place of authority of God and
[46:02] we don't see the Lamb yet because
[46:03] they're all crying in a few moments then
[46:05] a few scriptures down they're all crying
[46:07] saying who's worthy who's worthy and no
[46:09] one sees the lamb so that's the picture
[46:11] that we see at the beginning of this
[46:13] verse now let's look at a book rogram
[46:17] says a book the book was sealed by these
[46:21] seven seals the whole mystery of the
[46:24] book is sealed up in these seven seals
[46:25] this is one of the most greatest
[46:28] chapters in the whole book of Revelation
[46:31] oh yes I look forward to preaching the
[46:34] one of the greatest books in the book of
[46:36] Revelation tonight amen
[46:37] it's a privilege to do so Church and I
[46:41] want you to remember we've had a few
[46:43] guest ministers coming here lately and
[46:44] they've talked about how we need to
[46:47] speak more of the word and we've heard
[46:49] so much on the seven seals and and let
[46:53] me say and I've said this before we've
[46:54] got to balance that statement if we are
[46:57] coming to church and we're almost dozing
[46:59] off and and we're just hearing teaching
[47:01] and we're not pulling on the word it
[47:03] doesn't matter what anybody
[47:05] we're not gonna be on fire for God it
[47:09] doesn't really matter it's up to you and
[47:11] I Jesus isn't gonna say well you know
[47:14] he's not gonna say well it was my fault
[47:16] I wasn't sending the Word of God you
[47:17] know you lost your first love because I
[47:19] wasn't sending the Holy Spirit Jesus not
[47:22] going to say that Jesus has sent the
[47:24] Holy Spirit and it's our responsibility
[47:26] to come and dine with the master because
[47:28] he's inviting us tonight come and dine
[47:30] amen and we've got to come and sit at
[47:33] the table we've got the feast on the
[47:35] word we got the pull on the word we've
[47:37] got the love the word amen but the point
[47:39] I want to make is that and I said it
[47:43] before the Holy Spirit gave brother bran
[47:45] the seven seals and he caught in his
[47:47] greatest meetings and it had some of the
[47:49] greatest healings because leukemia was
[47:51] healed that week in March of 1963 where
[47:54] he was teaching and revealing the
[47:56] mysteries of God so when I'm when I know
[47:59] our brothers meaning I did talk to
[48:00] brother Joe he said they would I and
[48:04] what we were talking about what happens
[48:07] is that people let the word of God
[48:08] become intellectual instead of receiving
[48:11] the reality of it in other words they
[48:14] memorize the seven seals they were
[48:16] memorized what this symbol means that
[48:17] symbol it means but they do not receive
[48:20] the anointing of the flying eagle and
[48:23] the church said because they continue to
[48:26] wallow around and worldliness and so no
[48:29] matter who preaches it even if brother
[48:30] Branham see people they criticize
[48:32] preachers today but why don't they go
[48:34] listen to brother Brenneman and if they
[48:36] did they could listen the seventh seal
[48:37] why doesn't their faith rock because
[48:39] they're not receiving the word the
[48:41] spirit behind the word amen it's just
[48:44] becoming election ilysm so Church you
[48:46] and I it's your responsibility it's my
[48:48] responsibility to stay on fire with God
[48:51] we can't blame anybody else we will all
[48:53] stand individually before the throne of
[48:56] God amen
[48:57] this is an individual affair we'll stand
[48:59] there in
[49:03] or what your grandparents or your
[49:05] grandma you will stand there
[49:06] individually and your answer for their
[49:09] deeds done in the body amen hallelujah
[49:12] now there may be a time where you stand
[49:13] there with your husband or wife member
[49:14] brother Brahim had that dream where he
[49:16] and his wife were caught up to the
[49:17] throne you may stand there but you will
[49:19] not be judged as far as well because of
[49:21] your prayers of your wife your husband
[49:23] is saved
[49:23] No you've got to make that decision
[49:25] yourself everybody's got to die out to
[49:27] themselves everybody's got to go to
[49:29] Calvary amen mercy there is great and
[49:32] grace is free amen
[49:34] and there the burden was God's grace was
[49:36] multiplied to me amen there my burdened
[49:39] soul found Liberty at Calvary praise God
[49:41] that's what I'm saying is that you and I
[49:43] are responsible for our own walk and
[49:46] understanding and brother Joe agreed and
[49:48] when I was saying what we were saying is
[49:50] that people just teach they just teach
[49:52] the symbols they teach what they mean
[49:54] but they don't encourage the people to
[49:56] reach out and walk in the spirit praise
[49:58] God and to accept the anointing that God
[50:00] is dishing out even tonight amen how
[50:02] many want more the anointing of God well
[50:04] then you've got to accept it amen and
[50:06] you've got to receive it tonight you've
[50:08] got to enjoy the word you've got to say
[50:10] Amen brother Brahim said that when you
[50:12] say Amen it's like saying SiC them to
[50:13] the devil in other words devil get out
[50:16] of here when you say amen amen
[50:18] it said sick of me and then God will
[50:20] drive away that skunk of a devil are you
[50:23] with me Church but you've got to believe
[50:25] the Lord
[50:25] you've got to Amen the word if you're
[50:28] sit here and act like nothing's going on
[50:29] then the Holy Spirit can't minister to
[50:31] you but you've got to get in the spirit
[50:33] and worship God amen or I've seen it a
[50:37] hundred times if I haven't seen it a
[50:38] thousand times of all the times I preach
[50:40] anyone that's hungry for God's Word can
[50:42] receive whatever they have need of if we
[50:45] just believe and in get in the spirit
[50:46] and enjoy what God is speaking to us
[50:49] amen
[50:49] I've seen it a hundred times if not more
[50:52] alright we just got to get in the spirit
[50:54] of it now Berta may have said a seal
[50:56] represents a finished product now this
[50:58] ought to encourage you hopefully I'll
[51:00] hear a few amens here because if you
[51:02] Amen this then you were - Amen brother
[51:04] branham had you been living in 1961
[51:06] something that has already been tested
[51:08] proven and then sealed we have the
[51:11] earnest of our salvation now by being
[51:14] sealed with the
[51:14] spirit that is the earnest of our
[51:16] salvation let's go back just a minute
[51:19] I got a scripture written down here
[51:21] several of them so brother man wants to
[51:23] prove by the scripture so Rodin leaves
[51:25] the seals on the book are you with me
[51:28] here
[51:28] he leaves their seven seals on the book
[51:30] he leaves the seals and he just talks
[51:32] about a seal what is a seal so he shows
[51:34] us this and now it begins teaching on a
[51:36] seal he says now and he reads Ephesians
[51:40] 1:1 2:13 I'm not going to read all this
[51:42] but let just read his comments we find
[51:45] out that when the seal means it's a
[51:46] finished thing with God it's already
[51:48] settled and every believer was sealed
[51:50] with this promise from the very
[51:52] beginning because before the foundation
[51:54] of the world
[51:55] we were predestined unto the adoption of
[51:57] sons they men died he said before the
[52:00] world ever began oh what a hope that
[52:05] makes us rest that fast and sure anchor
[52:08] to the soul
[52:08] that's not tossed about here and there
[52:10] but anchored in Christ or hope that's
[52:13] sure and then program quotes this
[52:14] visions 1:13 predestinate us before the
[52:18] foundation world to the adoptions of
[52:20] sons by Jesus Christ oh how wonderful I
[52:22] love that a finished work with God amen
[52:26] are you glad in God's eyes your finished
[52:28] work but here on earth you're not we're
[52:31] gonna need more of God's grace we need
[52:33] more of his teaching more of his
[52:34] correction more of his love more of his
[52:37] inspiration more of his anointing but in
[52:39] God's eyes it's already a finished work
[52:41] amen hallelujah that's what the Bible
[52:45] says and then he jumps to Romans 8:29
[52:47] for whom God for no so see first God had
[52:51] before no you would love him he also did
[52:54] predestinate to be conformed to the
[52:57] image of his son that he might be the
[52:59] firstborn among many brethren moreover
[53:02] whom he did predestinate I love this
[53:04] then he also called so God predestinated
[53:06] you he's also called you have me been
[53:08] called to the message I know I have and
[53:10] whom he called let me also so why we
[53:15] worried about being condemned to the
[53:16] devil if the Bible says if he's called
[53:19] us and if he's predestinated us then
[53:21] there's they were already justified and
[53:23] that means declared righteous let's push
[53:25] it now if we if we sin let's confess it
[53:28] and then we can no there's nothing wrong
[53:29] in our lives and then we're justified he
[53:32] declares us righteous Amen and whom he
[53:38] justified them he also glorified a
[53:40] brother and said that glorified means
[53:41] you got a glorified body waiting yeah
[53:44] that me and that glorified body is what
[53:47] father swallows up this terrestrial body
[53:49] at the rapture amen
[53:51] but Adam said that's that theophany he
[53:54] said and that glorified body come down
[53:56] and meet and they swallow up this
[53:58] terrestrial body Oh and that happens at
[54:00] the that the last Trump and that that's
[54:03] happens at that meeting in the air I'm
[54:05] looking forward to that so see look if
[54:07] he foreknew you and all these things he
[54:09] predestined called justified he also has
[54:12] a glorified body for you amen Oh a glory
[54:15] that is see this is not outside the
[54:18] Bible teaching this is just Bible facts
[54:20] this is what churches can't preach
[54:22] because the people get confused or they
[54:25] think you're trying to be too spiritual
[54:26] I'm not trying to be too spiritual I'm
[54:28] just trying to be spiritual I'm just
[54:30] trying to be as spiritual as God wants
[54:32] me to be I'm not making this up either
[54:34] this applies to you or doesn't but I say
[54:37] it applies to me and I hope you'll
[54:39] confess it applies to you t amen you
[54:42] don't there except that if you don't
[54:43] want but I want to accept that amen we
[54:46] should all accept that because you
[54:47] should say God called me
[54:49] God's predestinated me God foreknew me
[54:51] and because of that he's also justified
[54:54] me and he's got a glorified body waiting
[54:56] for me
[54:56] oh my right but I have said now let me
[55:01] just go to another scripture so he's
[55:03] already gone through two now he goes to
[55:04] third oh I'm sorry no this is the same
[55:07] one that's the same all that he foreknew
[55:09] he called he called he justified
[55:10] justified he glorified all the way from
[55:13] the beginning God in His great infinite
[55:14] mind foresaw his church and
[55:16] predestinated unto the adoption of
[55:19] children through Jesus Christ to give
[55:20] them eternal life at the end of the age
[55:22] look what he looks over brother Neville
[55:24] the pastor he says what a beautiful
[55:25] thing brother Neville that just makes me
[55:27] feel lots better is that how it made you
[55:30] feel tonight I hope so
[55:32] it's the two old men in their 50s does
[55:34] that make you feel better he said oh
[55:35] don't don't don't you oh yeah adoption
[55:38] by the blood of Jesus Christ adoption
[55:41] means I'm
[55:41] as one of God's sons by the blood that
[55:45] was shed in my place amen
[55:47] I'm adopted by the blood the blood paid
[55:50] the price that I can join God's family
[55:52] amen
[55:53] Oh hallelujah that's a beautiful thing
[55:56] makes us feel a lot better you feel
[55:58] better already tonight
[55:59] you ought to now notice as we go on he
[56:02] says we know we're predestinated with
[56:04] the lamb the Holy Spirit is our seal the
[56:06] earnest means more is yet to come
[56:09] we only have the earnest of it now the
[56:11] earnest is just a down payment oh how
[56:13] beautiful just the down payment that
[56:14] holds it secures it anchors it so no one
[56:17] else can touch it it's the earnest of
[56:19] our adoption amen the Holy Spirit is now
[56:22] the earnest of God in our hearts the
[56:23] adoption of sons are waiting us at the
[56:26] end of the road sons and daughters of
[56:28] God now let's get into adoption program
[56:31] breaks into the the teaching on adoption
[56:34] now hope this clears it up for you I've
[56:37] got your Bible let's go to your Bible
[56:38] revelation 8 I'm sorry I'm not
[56:40] revelation Romans 8:22 now let me pose
[56:47] you the question because I'm gonna give
[56:48] you the answer in a minute can you be
[56:51] fully adopted now on the earth you have
[56:54] to wait till later to be fully adopted
[56:56] now don't say it out loud because I
[56:57] don't want you to be embarrassed if you
[56:58] get it wrong I might have got it wrong
[57:00] too
[57:00] but let's see what brother Aaron says
[57:02] now some people may preach there you're
[57:04] you're fully adopted right now you're a
[57:06] full adopted son or daughter of God your
[57:08] name is just as good on the check as the
[57:10] father's now let's see what brother
[57:14] Branham taught in this message here and
[57:17] from I understand this is true all the
[57:20] way through the message so let's go to
[57:23] Romans 8:22 for we know that the whole
[57:27] creation groaneth and travaileth in pain
[57:29] together until now my impression was
[57:33] grown in 2000 years ago what is it doing
[57:35] now you know sometimes I look at these
[57:37] animals and I feel so sorry for the
[57:38] animals and the trees you know because
[57:40] you can tell they're groaning you can
[57:42] tell someone at least I'm around they
[57:44] don't seem like they're very happy many
[57:45] times they're that their groaning
[57:48] waiting for the Bible says here they're
[57:51] waiting for the the new world verse 23
[57:53] and not only
[57:55] so not only animals at nature and rent
[57:57] reason and all these things not only are
[58:00] they groaning but the Bible said now are
[58:02] they but ourselves also which have the
[58:05] firstfruits of the Spirit even we
[58:08] ourselves groan within ourselves waiting
[58:10] for the adoption to it the redemption of
[58:15] our body so not only our animals we'd
[58:21] say any living plant trees for us not
[58:24] only is every living thing groaning
[58:26] waiting for the new day waiting for the
[58:29] Millennium hallelujah
[58:30] not only are they groaning for the
[58:32] Millennium but the Bible said a Holy
[58:34] Ghost full Christian is also groaning on
[58:37] the inside waiting for the day of
[58:39] redemption amen
[58:42] to it now the word to it means means or
[58:46] is so let me read us again but we
[58:49] ourselves in verse 23 groan within
[58:51] ourselves waiting for the adoption to it
[58:53] that is the redemption of our bodies so
[58:57] now let me answer your question can you
[59:00] be fully adapted opted by Jesus Christ
[59:03] while in this body what's the answer is
[59:05] anybody know no good brother good we
[59:10] said the same time no you cannot be
[59:12] fully adopted while you're in this body
[59:15] the Bible says that the fullness of the
[59:18] adoption comes at the body change amen
[59:21] but listen if you're born again you've
[59:24] got the spirit of adoption in your heart
[59:26] are you with me you have the spirit of
[59:30] adoption in your heart that's the
[59:31] baptism of the Holy Ghost but you're not
[59:33] fully adopted until that whole nature
[59:36] swallows up your whole body and now your
[59:39] whole being is swallowed up in life and
[59:41] now you're hoping is fully surrendered
[59:44] to Jesus Christ amen I hope that clears
[59:47] it up we've heard a lot of preaching
[59:48] about well actually not me our church
[59:50] but other churches and churches out
[59:52] people I've talked to or they hear a lot
[59:54] of preaching about adoption but let me
[59:55] clear it up to you when you're born
[59:57] again you have this spirit to be adopted
[59:59] your that you're adopted in the family
[1:00:01] of God but the fullness of it in other
[1:00:03] words all the benefits do not take place
[1:00:06] until the rapture of the bride of Jesus
[1:00:08] Christ
[1:00:09] and that's according to the Bible Romans
[1:00:11] 8:23 here's what my ram says oh do you
[1:00:20] see it all creation is groaning said
[1:00:22] Paul everything is growing look at the
[1:00:23] trees by Rama the trees are struggling
[1:00:25] you watch wait to that SAP goes down
[1:00:28] they're gonna be struggling and the wind
[1:00:29] be dropping their branches they're gonna
[1:00:32] be swaying and they don't like that the
[1:00:34] Bible said they're groaning look at the
[1:00:37] flowers how they struggle for life look
[1:00:39] look just look for the frost to tear
[1:00:41] them down look at the trees how they
[1:00:42] struggle to hold out their branches out
[1:00:44] to sing the glories of God how we ought
[1:00:48] to sing our how we ought to raise our
[1:00:49] branches tonight and say thank you Jesus
[1:00:51] thank you that the wind of the Holy
[1:00:53] Spirit blow through this tree amen
[1:00:56] move this tree to glorify your Holy Name
[1:00:59] Amen
[1:01:00] no glory he said everything all nature
[1:01:03] all animals well not my animals well
[1:01:05] just see what brother Graham said to all
[1:01:07] the animals the Bible said all creation
[1:01:09] groans you got to pay attention your
[1:01:11] animals
[1:01:12] we got to paid better attention our
[1:01:14] trees and our property all the birds all
[1:01:17] the birds that visit your house are
[1:01:18] groaning they they're just groaning for
[1:01:21] something they're groaning for
[1:01:22] perfection
[1:01:22] they're groaning for that new day praise
[1:01:25] God they're groaning for the eighth day
[1:01:27] they're groaning for the Millenium and
[1:01:29] that's what I'm groaning for that's what
[1:01:31] you're groaning for a perfect day I want
[1:01:34] to wake up in the morning and not feel
[1:01:35] the back pain anymore and I'm a young
[1:01:38] men's I guess Benz would to hide what
[1:01:40] you call young I want to wake up in the
[1:01:42] morning and I don't want to have a
[1:01:44] headache
[1:01:44] I don't wake up in the morning and I can
[1:01:47] just do all of the exercises right away
[1:01:48] that's not going to happen but till that
[1:01:51] day but listen I still wake up and I
[1:01:53] groan for that I don't want to die I
[1:01:57] don't want to get old I don't want to
[1:01:59] you know go through the older the
[1:02:00] challenges of being old and so that
[1:02:02] shows that I'm groaning for the
[1:02:04] perfection of God I'm groaning for my
[1:02:07] glorified body and if I've got a
[1:02:08] glorified one I know I've got a
[1:02:10] theophany tool amen
[1:02:11] because we need three bodies for
[1:02:13] perfection amen terrestrial celestial
[1:02:16] and glorified how he flow
[1:02:21] from the enemy quickly and gets away so
[1:02:23] when birds fly away their groaning I
[1:02:24] don't have to run away from this I like
[1:02:26] to run away from that everything
[1:02:31] groaning brother have said everything
[1:02:32] the Bible says all creation groans and
[1:02:35] we ourselves appalled we groan to with
[1:02:38] them for you're waiting for the
[1:02:39] redemption of our body but now now they
[1:02:41] did all those years now now we have the
[1:02:44] earnest of inheritance
[1:02:45] Omar what do we have we have the
[1:02:47] evidence that God lives if you are born
[1:02:50] again of the Holy Ghost you have the
[1:02:53] evidence that God is alive we have the
[1:02:57] evidence that God is with us we have the
[1:02:59] evidence that God is not forsaken us
[1:03:01] number one Sunday night we got to share
[1:03:02] that when that beautiful I remember some
[1:03:05] people were here but Sunday night I
[1:03:06] preached on the power of Jesus Christ's
[1:03:07] name
[1:03:08] and I said anyone who wants to stand up
[1:03:09] and testify that there's power there's
[1:03:12] power in the spoken word of Jesus Christ
[1:03:14] you're feel free feel free to stand up
[1:03:18] and people just started standing up and
[1:03:19] telling all these times that they spoke
[1:03:22] the name of Jesus Christ and nature or
[1:03:24] creation or body parts and all these
[1:03:26] things they all had to give way because
[1:03:29] there's power in the name of Jesus
[1:03:31] Christ amen
[1:03:32] I'm glad to experience it and I want to
[1:03:34] experience it more and more praise God
[1:03:36] amen we have evidence I'm not talking
[1:03:39] about something I don't know about I'm
[1:03:41] talking about something I do know about
[1:03:42] there's power in the name of Jesus and
[1:03:45] I've got the evidence that Christ lives
[1:03:46] in me Oh hallelujah and we have the
[1:03:52] evidence he's not forsaken us that we
[1:03:53] are his and he's ours
[1:03:55] because we in our bodies where's your
[1:03:58] evidence brother yes yeah not in there
[1:04:04] it's not really here you could point and
[1:04:06] say you have some type of written
[1:04:07] evidence here but brother Branham said
[1:04:10] your evidence it's right in here yeah
[1:04:13] show me your evidence I can't I can't
[1:04:15] really open up this cavity right here
[1:04:17] but it's in here do you tell people
[1:04:20] about it all the time yeah I don't I
[1:04:23] want people all the time to come see the
[1:04:25] evidence of the living Jesus Christ and
[1:04:28] all those that have been called will
[1:04:30] come to it amen all that the father has
[1:04:33] given me to come to me
[1:04:34] he says we now tabernacle so we
[1:04:38] Tabernacle the Holy Spirit of God that
[1:04:41] cries out Abba Father
[1:04:43] now Abba is a word of the Syriac
[1:04:47] language and so when the the author of
[1:04:50] the gospel wrote it it really Abba just
[1:04:53] means father but this is two languages
[1:04:55] if you read the Bible read the
[1:04:56] commentaries so this one's Greek and
[1:04:59] then this was in Syria so Jiri Jesus was
[1:05:01] using that that Syriac or Serie attic
[1:05:03] word I forget the name of it actually
[1:05:05] but anyways that the the right of the
[1:05:07] gospel just lists that when you say
[1:05:09] father you've just said Abba
[1:05:11] does every understand Patera is the
[1:05:14] actual Latin word is that right yeah
[1:05:16] Potter I think it's the Greek Greek is
[1:05:19] pretty close to that too at least what I
[1:05:21] saw in my Greek lexicon when I clicked
[1:05:22] on it today but other words when you say
[1:05:24] you have to say Abba Father you can
[1:05:26] though if you want I'm just saying when
[1:05:28] you say father it's the same as saying
[1:05:29] Abba to them to say well I have to say
[1:05:32] Abba Father I mean you could I mean you
[1:05:34] don't have to but if you just say father
[1:05:36] in heaven or heavenly father you said
[1:05:38] heavenly Abba that's what you said
[1:05:39] heavenly ABBA so notice brother Branham
[1:05:43] says the evidence that you have got in
[1:05:46] you is that you cry Abba Father that's
[1:05:51] the evidence but man aside now they are
[1:05:54] all saying and trying to prove that they
[1:05:56] have it all or have enough yet is this
[1:05:58] the truth now this is a different quote
[1:05:59] about the book of Acts shirker comparing
[1:06:02] this 20th century Church to the first
[1:06:04] century Church go ahead do that where's
[1:06:06] the power where's the love where's the
[1:06:08] purified church that withstood sin and
[1:06:10] walk with faith toward Jesus where's the
[1:06:12] unity you can't find it if this church
[1:06:15] has all it needs
[1:06:16] why were they crying out for more of God
[1:06:18] in the book of Acts as though they
[1:06:20] didn't have it all and yet they had far
[1:06:23] more than they have today and the church
[1:06:26] said go to Acts chapter 4 brother Adam
[1:06:30] said this is an evidence acts for
[1:06:32] actually you know you don't have to I
[1:06:33] got a right here I'd I didn't think I
[1:06:34] put it up here I thought I changed the
[1:06:35] slide and I forgot about it so program
[1:06:38] says one part of the evidence that you
[1:06:39] have the Holy Ghost is you crying out to
[1:06:43] the Father in prayer I'm not talking
[1:06:46] about Hail Mary Mother of grace ER or
[1:06:48] dear dear God thank you for this food
[1:06:50] bless us for the food Amen or whatever
[1:06:51] rhyme you want thank you for the food
[1:06:53] thank you for the goodness
[1:06:54] Amen I'm not talking about that I'm
[1:06:56] talking about when something inside of
[1:06:58] you calls out to something out there
[1:07:00] amen
[1:07:01] when the Spirit of God in you cries out
[1:07:04] for your father that's what we're
[1:07:06] talking about and only the people have
[1:07:09] the Holy Ghost can really cry out like
[1:07:11] that because the Bible says they cry
[1:07:13] Abba Father and that's the evidence that
[1:07:17] they have been adopted into the body of
[1:07:19] Jesus Christ
[1:07:20] dori amen now remember if you know Acts
[1:07:24] for Peter and John were in the disciples
[1:07:28] had just done a miracle in Acts chapter
[1:07:29] three the paralyzed man walked and then
[1:07:32] they get they get questioned before the
[1:07:34] Sanhedrin they get threatened they said
[1:07:36] don't you ever preach in that name don't
[1:07:38] you ever tell anybody about Jesus don't
[1:07:40] you ever tell anybody thought william
[1:07:41] branham anymore
[1:07:41] don't you talk anymore about the Bible
[1:07:43] and don't you preach the message anymore
[1:07:44] and I said okay whatever is between you
[1:07:46] and God that's fine but I'm gonna honor
[1:07:48] God and not you
[1:07:50] they left there say you can do whatever
[1:07:53] you want between God and man but we're
[1:07:54] gonna honor God and so they were a
[1:07:58] little discouraged so the Bible said
[1:07:59] they went back to an upper room and when
[1:08:01] they heard that they lifted up their
[1:08:03] voice to God now listen Church when was
[1:08:05] the last time you raise your voice in
[1:08:06] prayer to God I'm not saying you have to
[1:08:08] do it every day but when was the last
[1:08:10] time this is and these people are born
[1:08:13] again they got threatened don't preach
[1:08:15] in that name don't talk about Jesus so
[1:08:17] much and so they got discouraged they
[1:08:20] said we need to go pray and they lifted
[1:08:23] up their voices in prayer I sure like at
[1:08:26] this church at the end of the service
[1:08:27] when my voice isn't the only one that I
[1:08:30] hear when we're closing in prayer and
[1:08:32] the church said because when they now
[1:08:36] this is when you're really hungry for
[1:08:38] the Holy Ghost you cannot hold still if
[1:08:40] you've got the Holy Ghost in you and
[1:08:42] you're really crying out to God you have
[1:08:45] the Spirit of God in you and it cries
[1:08:47] out it lifts the voice to God Almighty
[1:08:50] so I'm giving you Bible Evans that's
[1:08:52] what brother Bram says this is what
[1:08:54] children of God do this is one evidence
[1:08:56] that you know you're born again you're
[1:08:58] not ashamed to cry out to God Abba or
[1:09:01] fire
[1:09:01] or daddy I love you you're my heavenly
[1:09:04] father you're my heavenly dad I'm going
[1:09:06] you on the scene hey man
[1:09:08] and you know when they call the Bible
[1:09:11] said lift over their voice and when they
[1:09:12] had prayed this is a prayer
[1:09:15] the place was shaking where they were
[1:09:17] assembled together and they're all
[1:09:18] filled with the Holy Ghost and they
[1:09:19] spoke the Word of God with boldness so
[1:09:22] think about when was the last time you
[1:09:24] prayed lift up your voice and you walked
[1:09:25] out of your clouds at all propose and
[1:09:27] full of the Holy Ghost hopefully it
[1:09:29] wasn't too long ago if it is long ago
[1:09:32] it's time to get back in there because
[1:09:34] when we pray like this when we cry out
[1:09:36] to God brother said I'm a father a real
[1:09:38] sincere prayer is the part of the
[1:09:40] evidence that you are borned again
[1:09:42] hallelujah and then again here's where
[1:09:47] Jesus said it and Jesus said Abba Father
[1:09:49] other words he said father all things
[1:09:51] are possible into thee take away this
[1:09:53] cup from me nevertheless not what I will
[1:09:55] but thou but what thou wilt amen
[1:09:59] now here's where it is in Scripture that
[1:10:01] this is all Scripture I'm not making
[1:10:02] this up if you were paying attention
[1:10:04] you'll know this is right Galatians four
[1:10:07] or five to redeem them that were under
[1:10:08] the law that we might receive the
[1:10:10] adoption of sons so being brought into
[1:10:12] officially into God's family because you
[1:10:15] are sons God has sent forth the spirit
[1:10:17] of his son into your hearts crying Abba
[1:10:20] Father that's one way you know you are a
[1:10:23] child of the Father because you're
[1:10:25] crying out to the Father amen that's how
[1:10:28] you know God your father and you're
[1:10:29] truly born again you're not ashamed to
[1:10:31] cry out to God you love God and you need
[1:10:34] him every hour when they're at whenever
[1:10:36] there's little discouragement you've got
[1:10:37] to cry out to God God put something
[1:10:39] inside of you a part of him inside of
[1:10:42] you to cry back out to him because
[1:10:44] you're a child of God amen
[1:10:46] if you're ashamed to play if you're
[1:10:48] shame to lift your voice if you're
[1:10:49] ashamed of Christ God is your father
[1:10:50] then I start thinking well am I born
[1:10:52] again or not am I born again do I have
[1:10:55] the Spirit of God because the spirit of
[1:10:57] a father cries out to God in that manner
[1:11:00] Oh father remember jesus said if it be
[1:11:04] possible let this cup pass Oh God
[1:11:07] Oh father if it's possible take this
[1:11:09] trial away oh man if it's possible
[1:11:12] take the sickness away that's what a
[1:11:14] child of God
[1:11:16] God loves to hear his children cry hey
[1:11:19] man he's got no other way to hear them
[1:11:21] cry then for them to just cry out to God
[1:11:23] when they're born again they say father
[1:11:25] I'm in need of you glory
[1:11:29] and remember Zeki of mine the same thing
[1:11:32] the Lord said set a mark upon the
[1:11:34] foreheads of them that sigh and cry for
[1:11:36] all the abominations that be done the
[1:11:38] midst thereof sighing and cry I preached
[1:11:41] on that often but it's one evidence that
[1:11:44] you're right where you need to be when
[1:11:46] you are so sick of sin that it makes you
[1:11:49] cry and weep that's so bad that you want
[1:11:51] to see soul saved you're tired of seeing
[1:11:53] your family live the way they live your
[1:11:55] friends that live the way they live
[1:11:56] you're so sick and tired at that it
[1:11:58] breaks your heart and you want a crowd
[1:12:00] to God and say God save their wretched
[1:12:01] souls amen that's part of the evidence
[1:12:06] of being born again hallelujah now now
[1:12:11] the trees does not have it so the trees
[1:12:14] don't have the Holy Spirit Nature does
[1:12:16] not have it but yet we are still growing
[1:12:17] with them because as yet we haven't
[1:12:19] received the fullness of our adoption so
[1:12:23] do you understand now when you get born
[1:12:24] again you have the spirit of adoption
[1:12:26] but you don't have the fullness of
[1:12:28] adoption which is the glorified body and
[1:12:30] the theophany body because the Bible
[1:12:33] said the fullness is to it that is the
[1:12:35] redemption of our body but we have the
[1:12:38] earnest of it that we are picked up from
[1:12:40] the things of the world and now become
[1:12:42] sons and daughters of God what kind of
[1:12:43] people should we be oh my when we think
[1:12:45] of that think of it now we have the
[1:12:48] earnest our spirits groaning for the
[1:12:50] full adoption so see that's what we're
[1:12:51] going for
[1:12:52] we're groaning to be perfect are you how
[1:12:54] do you feel do you feel that way are you
[1:12:55] groaning I just want to be perfect
[1:12:57] before God I don't want any problems I
[1:12:59] don't have to deal with sin I just want
[1:13:02] to be in a brand-new body that's the
[1:13:03] groaning of a real Christian I just want
[1:13:05] to be perfect like Jesus amen our
[1:13:09] spirits groaning for the full adoption
[1:13:12] but we have now the earnest of it as we
[1:13:16] receive the Holy Spirit it is the
[1:13:17] earnest of our complete adoption or
[1:13:19] complete salvation oh how beautiful I
[1:13:21] just love that all right we are waiting
[1:13:24] for the fullness of adoption he says
[1:13:25] when will this take place
[1:13:29] the rapture amen
[1:13:32] do you understand when will it take
[1:13:34] place when you're fully adopted into the
[1:13:37] family of God the full adoption does not
[1:13:40] take place until the first resurrection
[1:13:43] which is the rapture that's what our
[1:13:47] bodies will be changed from these vile
[1:13:48] creatures that we are and will have a
[1:13:51] body like unto his glorious body so if I
[1:13:53] walked up the after service and and said
[1:13:55] sister Connie are you are you adopted
[1:13:57] the family of God was if she was born
[1:13:59] the Holy Ghost she would say yes I'm
[1:14:01] adopted family of God I would and then
[1:14:03] I'll say well do you have the phone and
[1:14:04] something doctrine she'd say no but I'm
[1:14:07] gonna have it one of these days
[1:14:08] right well Jessie are you adopted into
[1:14:11] gods family I believe I am I believe I'm
[1:14:13] born again the Holy Ghost are you fully
[1:14:14] adopted not quite not quite but I feel
[1:14:19] but there's something growing in me
[1:14:20] waiting until I am fully adopted and I
[1:14:24] can feel if they men I feel like I don't
[1:14:26] want to go through this I feel like I
[1:14:28] just want to be in a perfect body I just
[1:14:30] want to be like my Savior amen
[1:14:32] Alleluia because the Bible said for when
[1:14:34] we should see him as he is we will be
[1:14:36] like him when he appears we appear in
[1:14:39] his likeness we will have a body like
[1:14:40] here's a glorious glorified body and all
[1:14:43] the trials and struggles of life will
[1:14:44] fade off I ought to hear an amen on that
[1:14:47] so at least somebody shout Amen maybe
[1:14:50] and all the trials of life will fade
[1:14:53] away off into a little mist and blow
[1:14:58] away to never be no more goodbye
[1:15:03] troubles the wind of the Holy Spirit
[1:15:06] just take it away like a little miss see
[1:15:08] you later I love our brother Brahim uses
[1:15:12] these poetic words these images you know
[1:15:15] for us in our minds we can picture oh
[1:15:17] steam just vaporizing you know
[1:15:19] evaporating that's what a brother have
[1:15:21] said our troubles are just gonna be
[1:15:22] evaporated oh now let's get into the
[1:15:26] seven seals okay
[1:15:27] so put on your spiritual thinking caps
[1:15:28] your brother and says put on your good
[1:15:30] girls good I like acacia birthday girls
[1:15:32] got her cap on
[1:15:34] amen now the verse says verse run
[1:15:38] revelation 5:1 okay let me go back I
[1:15:40] want to read it
[1:15:42] the Bible says that the book is written
[1:15:44] within and on the backside sealed with
[1:15:48] seven seals and I saw on the right hand
[1:15:51] of him that sat on the throne a book
[1:15:53] written within and on the backside
[1:15:55] sealed with seven seals okay so here's
[1:16:00] what I want to say about this this says
[1:16:01] that this scripture has been greatly
[1:16:02] misunderstood by certain groups which
[1:16:05] namely is the seventh Thunder movement
[1:16:07] which I've interacted with some people
[1:16:09] that came out of it and also a pastor
[1:16:11] that battle that brother of on carry on
[1:16:12] from New York he battled it he was never
[1:16:14] in it he battled it and condemned it now
[1:16:16] note some people have misinterpreted
[1:16:18] brother branham's words about what was
[1:16:21] written on the back side of the book the
[1:16:23] false teachers say there's more to be
[1:16:26] revealed that than that what was in the
[1:16:28] Bible that's wrong so these preachers
[1:16:32] will say well I'll see those readers
[1:16:33] riding on the inside of the book like
[1:16:35] this but then there's writing on the
[1:16:37] back and that's what God's going to show
[1:16:39] me because I got more revelation than
[1:16:40] you that's wrong here's the quote that
[1:16:47] gets misunderstood it's from services
[1:16:49] it's the end time which was a very deep
[1:16:50] message very symbolic lots of Dreams
[1:16:52] lots of visions they dealt with the
[1:16:54] cloud we preach on that a few weeks ago
[1:16:56] dealt with the cloud from 1963 a lot of
[1:16:59] visions now brother and I said look
[1:17:01] we're the voices was the thunders not in
[1:17:03] heaven on earth the thunders never
[1:17:05] uttered from the heavens they uttered
[1:17:08] from the earth I'm I understand that
[1:17:10] Revelation chapter 10 the Bible said the
[1:17:12] angel descended and when he descended he
[1:17:14] sounded and there were seven thunders of
[1:17:16] their voices on the earth praise God now
[1:17:21] here's where they misunderstand it it's
[1:17:24] on the backside when a book is completed
[1:17:26] not did he say on the front side he said
[1:17:29] on the backside and after it's all done
[1:17:31] completed then the seven thunders voices
[1:17:34] is the only thing that's stuck in the
[1:17:37] book that's not revealed it's not even
[1:17:41] written in the book so people take this
[1:17:45] quote and what I think I just I don't
[1:17:47] know for sure but my opinion is brother
[1:17:48] band just mixed up his words he's a man
[1:17:50] sometimes he did that but this is the
[1:17:53] quote that's so misunderstood
[1:17:56] and notice the false teachers say they
[1:17:59] have the interpretation of the seven
[1:18:02] thunders the book deal with the statute
[1:18:05] perfect man that's what the whole
[1:18:06] movement was around the seven thunders
[1:18:08] movement was saying the thunders that
[1:18:09] uttered were the seven attributes or
[1:18:12] virtues that we need in order to be in
[1:18:14] the statute of the fullness of Christ
[1:18:15] that's wrong they are the the the Bible
[1:18:19] said the thunders dealt with the seven
[1:18:21] seals not the Statue River man now the
[1:18:25] fruit of that movement proved they were
[1:18:28] wrong and what were some of the fruits
[1:18:30] of the movement the children of the
[1:18:33] founders were caught in adultery and
[1:18:35] money embezzlement and spent years in
[1:18:38] jail in New York City they exalted the
[1:18:41] leader of that movement so much so that
[1:18:43] they prophesied that he would raise from
[1:18:45] the dead when he died and he didn't so
[1:18:48] there's false prophecy all surrounding
[1:18:50] that there's money problems
[1:18:52] there's dissociation there's there's
[1:18:54] heresies all on that other fruit around
[1:18:57] this false doctrine is wrong in fact
[1:19:00] brother Craig and brother Dave Llewellyn
[1:19:02] I don't think they'd mind me calling
[1:19:03] their names but they went to one of
[1:19:04] those seven Thunder movements and the
[1:19:06] preacher saw how those two were not a
[1:19:09] mending like everybody else because if
[1:19:11] you don't amen seven thunders then they
[1:19:13] look at you like you're crazy because
[1:19:15] you're not getting in the spirit like
[1:19:17] they are and Craig said I just didn't
[1:19:19] understand what they were saying about
[1:19:20] the seven thunders and pretty soon the
[1:19:24] preacher started preaching on them
[1:19:25] saying we've got some he says some stale
[1:19:28] white popcorn because the church was
[1:19:29] black I don't know if the preacher was
[1:19:31] white or black or not I don't know we
[1:19:33] said we got some stale white popcorn
[1:19:34] over here that's not popping and popping
[1:19:37] like it ought to be popping so they got
[1:19:39] up and left and I don't blame them I
[1:19:40] would have got up and left too if you
[1:19:43] don't understand that how can you say
[1:19:44] man but if something strikes you from
[1:19:46] God your more than say Amen you'll feel
[1:19:49] the fire of God burn down in your soul
[1:19:51] it'll be a revelation to you it's faith
[1:19:53] coming to the believer and you'll have
[1:19:55] to do something because you'll be full
[1:19:57] of joy unspeakable and full of glory
[1:19:59] your cuff will run over amen I feel it
[1:20:03] right now he meant out of anuya glory
[1:20:06] but the fruit
[1:20:09] of the myth of the move was wrong and
[1:20:11] and I talked to brother LaVon he's told
[1:20:14] me numerous stories where he would go
[1:20:15] into their meetings and blast them they
[1:20:17] let him say some words
[1:20:18] he'd blast them from the pulp and they
[1:20:20] still wouldn't repent and knew it was
[1:20:22] wrong knew everything was wrong it was a
[1:20:24] denomination a denomination and he was
[1:20:27] invited certain meetings that would
[1:20:29] blast it all around a lot of people left
[1:20:31] but some people still in it and that's
[1:20:33] the quote they misunderstood brother
[1:20:36] Brennan told us the seven thunders were
[1:20:39] about the revelations in the seven seals
[1:20:41] how many understand that the thunders
[1:20:44] are about the seals let's go to
[1:20:46] revelation 10 all right now I just
[1:20:52] preached on verse one two Sundays ago
[1:20:54] and also on a Wednesday night yeah last
[1:20:57] Wednesday night I preached part two of
[1:20:58] clothed with the cloud first one and I
[1:21:00] saw another mighty angel come down from
[1:21:02] heaven clothed with the crowd that's
[1:21:03] Christ and a rainbow was upon his head
[1:21:06] we saw in the Life magazine and his face
[1:21:07] was as it were the Sun that's the
[1:21:09] picture and his feet as pillars of fire
[1:21:11] must have been the pillar of fire and he
[1:21:13] had in his hand a little book open now
[1:21:15] here's where it is that's the book that
[1:21:17] was in heaven the book that was in
[1:21:19] heaven was seven seals is now open the
[1:21:22] seals have been taken off the book and
[1:21:24] now the book is brought down to heaven
[1:21:26] aren't you glad amen it's brought down
[1:21:28] from heaven down to earth and he said
[1:21:31] his right foot upon the sea and his left
[1:21:33] foot upon the earth and he cried with a
[1:21:36] loud voice as when a lion roar and when
[1:21:38] he had cried seven thunders uttered
[1:21:40] their voices so Jesus Christ descends
[1:21:43] and he comes down to the earth and he
[1:21:46] utters what the seven thunders say and
[1:21:48] it's honored on the earth
[1:21:50] it wasn't uttered in heaven it was
[1:21:52] uttered on the earth all this earth is
[1:21:54] so privileged to have God speak is seven
[1:21:57] thunder mysteries down on the earth amen
[1:22:00] we have to wonder it was it said well I
[1:22:02] wish I could have been there in heaven
[1:22:03] God brought heaven on the earth to show
[1:22:06] us what those revelations were in those
[1:22:08] seven seals Amen oh yes no member of
[1:22:13] verse 4 John can't write it when the
[1:22:15] seven thunders and other voices I was
[1:22:17] about to write and I heard a voice from
[1:22:18] heaven saying unto me seal up those
[1:22:19] things that the seven thunders uttered
[1:22:21] and write them not and
[1:22:22] danger which I saw standing upon the
[1:22:24] scene upon the earth lifted up his hand
[1:22:26] to heaven and he swear by him that
[1:22:28] liveth for ever and ever who created
[1:22:29] heaven and all and the things that
[1:22:31] therein are and the earth and the things
[1:22:32] that therein are and the sea and the
[1:22:33] things that there which therein are that
[1:22:36] there should be time or delay no longer
[1:22:38] so God was not gonna after that God was
[1:22:40] not gonna delay any longer he was going
[1:22:43] to do verse 7 but in the days of the
[1:22:45] seventh angel when he shall begin to
[1:22:46] sound the mystery of God should be
[1:22:48] finished as he hath declared to his
[1:22:51] servants the prophets so we see the
[1:22:53] mystery of God cannot be finished until
[1:22:55] the seven thunders uttered their voices
[1:22:57] upon the earth as ever understand I hope
[1:23:01] you understand this we're gonna preach
[1:23:02] on Sunday night we're gonna preach on
[1:23:03] the twelve Bible mysteries because all
[1:23:06] the mystery of God must be finished
[1:23:07] praise the Lord all the mystery of God
[1:23:10] so every time the Bible says there's a
[1:23:12] mystery it's got to be finished and the
[1:23:14] church said it has to be because the
[1:23:16] Bible said the mystery of God is
[1:23:19] finished all right so don't get confused
[1:23:23] the seven thunders are not about the
[1:23:25] stats River man that's what the seven
[1:23:27] thunders movement was all about it was
[1:23:29] wrong what the brother did he just put a
[1:23:30] few quotes together from different
[1:23:32] sermons and putting together and that
[1:23:33] wasn't what brother man was saying
[1:23:34] brother Ram later said the seven
[1:23:36] thunders were about the seven seals amen
[1:23:39] now here's where brother ham tells you
[1:23:44] directly the seven thunders were all
[1:23:46] about the seals they asked brother Aaron
[1:23:49] brother man
[1:23:50] have you seen the seventh I'm sorry have
[1:23:52] the seven thunders which equals seven
[1:23:53] mysteries already been revealed were
[1:23:55] they reveal
[1:24:04] you
[1:25:04] if there is please see me afterwards
[1:25:06] please email me or text me or something
[1:25:09] like that please let me know why if
[1:25:11] there's any confusion because brother
[1:25:15] Aaron tells us no they say oh they are
[1:25:18] they no they were already revealed in
[1:25:21] the seven seals and I have to really
[1:25:25] feel burden to cover this here tonight
[1:25:27] now now this is in the church age book
[1:25:30] which some people don't believe I tend
[1:25:32] to believe it's mostly right because
[1:25:34] I've only found a few minutes takes now
[1:25:38] this messenger malachi for revelation
[1:25:40] ten seven is gonna do two things one
[1:25:42] according to malachi for that your heart
[1:25:44] feeling like you wish you lived in the
[1:25:47] book of acts days if it is then you're
[1:25:48] harder it's getting turn to the book of
[1:25:50] Acts if you see it then you need a heart
[1:25:52] change you need a heart transplant right
[1:25:55] your heart should be turned to the
[1:25:59] hearts of st. Paul to the hearts of st.
[1:26:01] John to the hearts of st. Peter our
[1:26:03] heart should be turning that's what
[1:26:05] programmes of ministry was to do if
[1:26:07] we're not longing for Bible days our
[1:26:09] hearts turning it turned a man but if we
[1:26:12] are longing for the Bible days if we are
[1:26:14] no need for more supernatural more of
[1:26:16] God and more of the Holy Ghost then it
[1:26:18] proves your hearts been tired amen it
[1:26:21] was turned by the Spirit elijha
[1:26:24] hallelujah that's one two he'll reveal
[1:26:31] the mysteries of the seven thunders in
[1:26:33] Revelation 10 which you are the
[1:26:37] revelations contained in the seven seals
[1:26:40] so some people say well I won't take
[1:26:41] this it's the church age book but what I
[1:26:44] do is I go back well brother Branham
[1:26:45] said it while on tape not in the book he
[1:26:49] said it the same thing the seven
[1:26:51] thunders were about the seven seals and
[1:26:53] then he says in the book the seven
[1:26:54] thunders about the seven seals
[1:26:55] to me that's unity to me that's harmony
[1:26:59] that's not disharmony that's harmony to
[1:27:01] me how does anyone else feel that's
[1:27:04] harmony to them now look this is
[1:27:08] beautiful this is why I don't want to
[1:27:11] downplay the revelation of the seven
[1:27:12] seals it will be these divinely revealed
[1:27:15] mystery truths from the seals that
[1:27:17] Julie turn the hearts of the children to
[1:27:19] the Pentecostal fathers if you don't see
[1:27:22] that's why this is why the the Seals has
[1:27:25] become education to people they just
[1:27:27] become dead letter to people because if
[1:27:30] their heart is not turned to the
[1:27:32] Pentecostal fathers then they haven't
[1:27:34] caught the revelation the seven seals
[1:27:36] it's not been revealed to them it's just
[1:27:38] intellectualism and they don't care
[1:27:40] about it and doesn't do anything to them
[1:27:42] in other words they don't want the
[1:27:43] anointing of the hour they want to be
[1:27:45] anointed with cares of the world they
[1:27:47] don't want to be anointed with the Holy
[1:27:49] Ghost who acts like a flying eagle in
[1:27:50] this hour amen
[1:27:53] hope you can understand that church I
[1:27:55] know it's getting quiet but listen
[1:27:58] that's important if our if your heart is
[1:28:00] not turning if you're not longing to see
[1:28:02] more of the book of Acts if you're not
[1:28:04] not longing to see return the book of
[1:28:05] Acts you have not received the
[1:28:06] revelation the seven seals because
[1:28:09] that's what it produces it produces
[1:28:11] somebody who rise up
[1:28:13] we're like with wings like an eagle amen
[1:28:15] it'll produces somebody who can renew
[1:28:18] their strength and become a strong
[1:28:20] Christian even though maybe they they
[1:28:21] aren't right now they know God's going
[1:28:23] to bring their strength back and they're
[1:28:25] gonna get their first love back amen
[1:28:26] hallelujah if they're enjoying living in
[1:28:30] Laodicea enjoying life and join the
[1:28:32] cares of the world they have not
[1:28:34] received the revelation of seven it's
[1:28:36] just been announced to them brother
[1:28:37] Branham said it went right over their
[1:28:39] head and he said so with a rapture go
[1:28:40] right over their head if they have ever
[1:28:42] received the revelation of the seven
[1:28:43] seals and brother Jesse said Amen I'm
[1:28:49] not upset
[1:28:50] but it's serious if the Bible is just an
[1:28:53] old Bible to you and it doesn't get you
[1:28:55] excited to read anymore then you're
[1:28:56] backslidden
[1:28:57] then you have not received the
[1:28:59] revelation because it is these
[1:29:01] revelations of the seals that literally
[1:29:03] turn your heart back I want to be
[1:29:05] anointed I want to fly above this world
[1:29:07] I hate sin I can't eat sin I've got to
[1:29:10] fly up in heavenly places amen that's
[1:29:12] what I'm talking about but see a natural
[1:29:16] mind cannot understand the spiritual
[1:29:18] things of God hallelujah and that's a
[1:29:21] mystery in first Corinthians do then the
[1:29:24] spiritual mind judges all your life it
[1:29:26] just doesn't judge when you go to church
[1:29:28] it judges when you go home as a
[1:29:29] spiritual is it going to draw me closer
[1:29:31] to Jesus cry
[1:29:31] is this gonna put my children closer to
[1:29:33] Christ or not a spiritual mind will
[1:29:35] judge is this gonna draw me closer to
[1:29:37] Christ or not a spiritual mind will
[1:29:39] judge everything and bring everything
[1:29:41] into subjection to the Holy Spirit amen
[1:29:44] hallelujah that's the two things brother
[1:29:48] Rams ministry was supposed to do turn
[1:29:52] our hearts to the father's and then also
[1:29:57] reveal the mysteries contain the seven
[1:29:59] seals which are the seven thunders and
[1:30:02] that literally will turn the hearts of
[1:30:05] the children to the Pentecostal father's
[1:30:06] I believe the obvious that's just my
[1:30:10] testimony that's what happened to me
[1:30:11] when God revealed to me the seven seals
[1:30:14] and I realized I was born again and God
[1:30:15] gave me the born-again experience it set
[1:30:17] me on fire and sister Connie they have
[1:30:19] been able to put this far out no matter
[1:30:20] people my job or people my family I
[1:30:22] don't believe the message they have it
[1:30:23] for all these 18 years been able to put
[1:30:24] that fire out
[1:30:25] it just keeps burning but I've got to
[1:30:28] feed the fire rather go home and throw
[1:30:29] some wood some dead wood some dead ideas
[1:30:32] on that fire say God take away my ideas
[1:30:34] give me fresh thoughts from heaven amen
[1:30:36] give me a fresh burden for the word of
[1:30:39] God let me see the book of Acts of my
[1:30:41] life I'm yearning for that my heart is
[1:30:43] turned to the faith of st. Paul MN if
[1:30:47] not then you haven't received the
[1:30:49] revelation so it just was just was
[1:30:51] education to you and that's a sad
[1:30:54] situation to be in but there's always
[1:30:56] hope
[1:30:56] as long as you're alive there's hope
[1:30:58] amen there's hope for all of us praise
[1:31:00] the Lord in the
[1:31:04] Jays book program says this yeah
[1:31:07] program says it'll take a profit to
[1:31:09] reveal the seven Thunder so this is what
[1:31:10] we read revelation 10 3 to 4 is the
[1:31:13] endtime front period that the seven
[1:31:14] thunders of Jesus came forth what was in
[1:31:16] those thunders no one knows but we need
[1:31:19] to know and it will take a prophet to
[1:31:20] get the revelation because God has no
[1:31:22] other way of bringing out his spiritual
[1:31:23] scriptural revelations except by a
[1:31:25] prophet the word always came by prophet
[1:31:27] and always will amen all right let's

[1:32:33] laws just different the good on that
[1:32:35] pop quiz there ha ha ha program said
[1:32:38] you're my class the RAM said that the
[1:32:40] church is the class the pastor is the
[1:32:42] teacher you can look it up other day I'm
[1:32:44] said that in the seals he said my class
[1:32:46] did pretty good he said got your notes
[1:32:47] in Benzes class he says class and I
[1:32:51] already do teach that works out pretty
[1:32:52] good
[1:32:52] amen let's reveal the Seventh Seal now
[1:32:55] the 5th seal you know was the white
[1:32:57] robes given to who juice the 60 it was
[1:33:01] the two prophets unleashing what
[1:33:14] construction during the Great
[1:33:16] Tribulation
[1:33:16] yeah very Simon see look everything
[1:33:25] quiet Darren and rather wonderful even
[1:33:28] stuff now behind those brother Ram said
[1:33:31] should give us the hearts of the
[1:33:34] Apostolic fathers if we truly believe
[1:33:36] those revelations and I preach it like
[1:33:39] this a noble Aaron's never heard us
[1:33:40] before other things test to me brother
[1:33:43] it means this we cannot let the death
[1:33:45] horse rider of the pale spiritual death
[1:33:47] we can't let him ride in our property
[1:33:49] we've got to turn him back and drive him
[1:33:53] back with the power of Jesus Christ
[1:33:55] because he's riding all over the world
[1:33:57] he's riding all over everybody's
[1:33:59] property except the bride hey man
[1:34:02] because momentum said best state to live
[1:34:04] brother man said spiritual death has
[1:34:06] struck the Pentecostal church thus saith
[1:34:09] the Lord he said it in the fourth seal
[1:34:10] amen it's already rode it's already rode
[1:34:14] in denominations and we've got to keep
[1:34:16] it out of our lives in other words we
[1:34:18] got to stay on fire we can't die and get
[1:34:20] tired on God we got to stay on fire for
[1:34:22] Christ that will turn your hearts back
[1:34:26] to the Apostolic fathers amen that's
[1:34:29] where you be the seventh seal now for
[1:34:32] all of you to know I preached us about
[1:34:35] two years ago because I sell this to the
[1:34:36] slides I just cut copy paste and some of
[1:34:38] the slides in here because this is where
[1:34:40] brother Adam goes with this so all of
[1:34:43] you know the seventh seal is the day and
[1:34:46] hour when Jesus comes back for the
[1:34:48] rapture just so you know the seventh
[1:34:50] seal is the moment of the rapture I'm
[1:34:52] going to show you about 10 quotes that
[1:34:54] say that this is not brother Jesse's
[1:34:55] idea this is brother branham's preaching
[1:34:57] and program said it was a ministry or a
[1:34:59] revelation
[1:35:00] I found it now I found it most helpful
[1:35:02] to start at the end of the ministry of
[1:35:04] brother Branham and go back to the
[1:35:05] Seventh Seal sermon so I started at the
[1:35:07] end when he said seventh seal and then I
[1:35:08] went back from 65 back to sixth I'm 63
[1:35:13] now I believe the Seventh Seal is the
[1:35:15] day and the hour of the coming of jesus
[1:35:18] christ the rapture or the first
[1:35:19] resurrection
[1:35:21] now this is
[1:35:22] sixteen months after March 63 when he
[1:35:25] preached the Seventh Seal so over a year
[1:35:27] and a half about a year and a half later
[1:35:29] here's what my RAM said he said the last
[1:35:31] seal will be the coming of the Lord this
[1:35:34] is in broken cisterns I'm gonna skip
[1:35:36] down remember
[1:35:37] they which are alive and remain shall
[1:35:38] not hinder those which are sleeping for
[1:35:40] the Trump of God that last trumpet the
[1:35:43] sixth one is sounded and that last
[1:35:45] trumpet that like that last seal will be
[1:35:48] the coming of the Lord
[1:35:49] if shall sound the dead in Christ shall
[1:35:51] rise first just resting to that time and
[1:35:54] what are you resting and you're resting
[1:35:55] in your soul the baptism of the Holy
[1:35:57] Ghost that doesn't mean rest like we're
[1:35:59] not gonna do outreach anymore I want you
[1:36:02] to send out any more invitations you
[1:36:03] know we don't need to go passing out
[1:36:05] things we don't need to witness the
[1:36:07] people anymore that's not the rest thing
[1:36:08] he's talking about he's talking about
[1:36:10] resting in your soul jesus said come
[1:36:12] unto me all you that are weary and
[1:36:14] heavy-laden and I'll give you rest for
[1:36:15] your souls that's the rest that we need
[1:36:18] in this hour hallelujah now remember the
[1:36:22] Trump of God that's the very last hour
[1:36:24] shout voice Trump Trump is the very last
[1:36:26] thing as part of the rapture at the last
[1:36:30] Trump the dead in Christ rise first we
[1:36:32] which are alive and remain shall be
[1:36:33] caught up together with them in the
[1:36:34] clouds to meet the lord in the air so
[1:36:36] shall we ever be with the Lord now this
[1:36:38] is in feast of the trumpet so this is
[1:36:40] July 64 now let me say this right here
[1:36:43] that every Trump of that blow blown
[1:36:44] under the sixth seal in other words in
[1:36:46] the Ministry of Moses and Elijah we'll
[1:36:50] get in that a few minutes where we
[1:36:51] caught the seal they're all the trumpets
[1:36:53] sounded under the sixth seal because the
[1:36:55] Seventh Seal There was silence no one
[1:36:58] knew that was the minute or hour that
[1:37:03] Christ would come as he revealed to us
[1:37:06] and the church said brother Branham said
[1:37:10] Jesus revealed to us that the seven seal
[1:37:13] had silence because that was the very
[1:37:16] minute that Jesus Christ left heaven and
[1:37:20] came down to air to meet us in the sky
[1:37:23] for the rapture for the marriage as
[1:37:25] every understand that's why they're
[1:37:27] silenced remember all the all the beasts
[1:37:29] are saying holy holy holy all the sinner
[1:37:32] friends are saying holy holy holy
[1:37:33] everybody's saying holy all of a sudden
[1:37:35] the seven seals stop
[1:37:36] but I said that's because Jesus comes
[1:37:39] down to meet us in the air they're not
[1:37:42] gonna out holy holy holy why he's
[1:37:43] not there they're gonna wait till gets
[1:37:46] back
[1:37:49] the man said the Seventh Seal was the
[1:37:51] minute or hour that Christ would come as
[1:37:52] he revealed it to us he says then again
[1:37:57] now this is where people get confused
[1:37:59] but stay with me the Seventh Seal hasn't
[1:38:02] opened yet you know that's his coming at
[1:38:06] the same time now as soon as the church
[1:38:08] the bride is jarred together she's taken
[1:38:09] up and that mystery of the seventh seal
[1:38:11] them or the seventh seal the mystery of
[1:38:13] going now people don't get confused he
[1:38:16] programmed said in the same sermon he
[1:38:18] said the seventh seal has been revealed
[1:38:19] to us and then he said it has open yet
[1:38:21] in the same sermon but remember HCO has
[1:38:25] three different parts to it so we're
[1:38:28] gonna go through that just a minute let
[1:38:29] me see it let me let me skip ahead to
[1:38:31] that so I I feel I feel I better do that
[1:38:33] right now
[1:38:37] brother Branham said every seal has
[1:38:39] three parts a symbol form a reality form
[1:38:42] and a revelation form did great if you
[1:38:44] knew that then we know that okay
[1:38:46] not many people just a couple well let's
[1:38:49] go back to read it so you know brother
[1:38:51] BAM said this in the first seal he said
[1:38:52] and notice the first seal when it was
[1:38:54] open the symbol form so see a seal has a
[1:38:57] symbol it thundered now what about when
[1:39:00] it's open it's reality for so what about
[1:39:04] when that seal actually takes place on
[1:39:06] the earth what about when that red horse
[1:39:08] actually went riding and started killing
[1:39:10] Christians it had to have another form
[1:39:13] john saw the form in the vision but it
[1:39:16] had to have a form where it actually
[1:39:18] happened in the real life does that make
[1:39:19] sense to everybody I hope it does see he
[1:39:25] said it thundered as soon as a lamb
[1:39:26] struck back the first seal what did it
[1:39:28] reveal not all of itself
[1:39:29] first it's with God so see first the
[1:39:31] seals with God next it's in a symbol
[1:39:33] then it's revealed three things every
[1:39:35] seal has three things about man tells us
[1:39:37] he is coming from fourth from the throne
[1:39:40] first it can't be seen heard enough and
[1:39:42] it's sealed up the Lambs blood paid the
[1:39:44] price at thunder would have spoke out
[1:39:46] and when he did a white horse rider
[1:39:47] started out and it was still a symbol so
[1:39:49] let's go to this
[1:39:50] so the first seat you'll brother branham
[1:39:53] preach it on March 16th the symbol form
[1:39:56] of the first seal that John saw and 89 D
[1:39:58] does this makes sense the reality form
[1:40:01] though took place that white horse rider
[1:40:03] actually went riding around 33 82 380
[1:40:06] the revelation form didn't come until
[1:40:10] brother Branham preached in on March 18
[1:40:12] 1963 amen
[1:40:16] glory can I give you another visual just
[1:40:19] I'll come back to this I made this you -
[1:40:21] you might remember this there's three
[1:40:23] forms there so here's the reality forms
[1:40:26] of the seals in other words the white
[1:40:27] horse rode this long the red horse rode
[1:40:30] this long in reality on these dates and
[1:40:32] then the black horse rode this long on
[1:40:34] those dates and then the pale horse was
[1:40:37] riding today on these dates that's the
[1:40:39] reality form John saw the symbol form
[1:40:42] right here John's in a vision he sees a
[1:40:43] form 80 90 but the reality he form had
[1:40:47] not gone yet and brother Branham gave us
[1:40:50] the revelation form in March of 1963
[1:40:53] aren't you glad oh my
[1:40:58] am i making this up anybody am I making
[1:41:00] this up or is this the truth of God I'm
[1:41:04] not making this up I just showed you the
[1:41:06] quotes and I'm just trying to give you a
[1:41:08] visual so you'll catch it brother in the
[1:41:11] same sermon brother Branham says the
[1:41:13] seven seals revealed and they says it
[1:41:14] hasn't open yet and that's because of
[1:41:17] what I just showed you I made one just
[1:41:20] for the seventh seal when brother
[1:41:21] Branham preached the seven seal it was
[1:41:23] actually the voice of God revealing the
[1:41:25] revelation of the seventh seal so the
[1:41:28] symbol form of the seventh seal was in
[1:41:30] 1890 there was really no symbol like
[1:41:31] brother and said other than just there
[1:41:32] was silence there was really no symbols
[1:41:34] no horse rider no robes the reality form
[1:41:39] of the seventh seal is still future and
[1:41:41] this is what brother Branham means when
[1:41:43] it hasn't opened yet the rapture has not
[1:41:47] taken place yet the seventh seal is not
[1:41:49] open yet but has the seventh seal been
[1:41:52] revealed to us yes we know what it means
[1:41:54] if the day and our miss coming oh thank
[1:41:58] you thank you Jesus oh yeah that's the
[1:42:02] only way you can understand it if you do
[1:42:04] other way you get confused and you
[1:42:06] stumble yourself and you get yourself
[1:42:07] all wrapped up I used to be all wrapped
[1:42:09] up in it till God revealed it to me
[1:42:12] that's the truth all right let's keep
[1:42:17] going on the quote so you know the
[1:42:19] Seventh Seal is the what somebody say
[1:42:21] the Seventh Seal is the day and what day
[1:42:24] an hour was coming that's the rapture
[1:42:26] the seventh seal is the day an hour of
[1:42:29] Jesus Christ coming in the rapture
[1:42:30] that's why the seventh seal means so
[1:42:32] much to us Church that's try I don't get
[1:42:34] tired about people preaching about the
[1:42:36] seventh seal because I want to be a part
[1:42:37] of the rapture a mehendi I want to know
[1:42:40] more about what I'm gonna be a part of
[1:42:42] I'm not I don't want to know about it if
[1:42:45] I'm not gonna be a part of it I want to
[1:42:46] know about it because I got a ticket to
[1:42:48] me there amen
[1:42:49] where is it take it out where's the
[1:42:50] evidence right in here amen
[1:42:53] where's the evidence that you're gonna
[1:42:55] be there right in here look real hard
[1:42:59] you'll see that the life of Christ if
[1:43:01] someone's got the baptism Holy Ghost
[1:43:02] you'll see the life of Christ thank you
[1:43:06] Jesus glorious brother ma'am said he
[1:43:11] revealed it then he says he hasn't
[1:43:12] opened it that's because the reality
[1:43:14] form hasn't been opened and that's what
[1:43:18] I put up there
[1:43:19] okay now here's that yeah that's the
[1:43:21] scripture
[1:43:23] okay so by minute jesus said heaven
[1:43:26] earth shall pass away my words shall not
[1:43:28] pass away I got to finish up that's our
[1:43:29] but of that day and hour knoweth no man
[1:43:31] no not the angels of heaven but the
[1:43:33] father how many remember in the Book of
[1:43:35] Luke Jesus said not even the son knows
[1:43:37] it not even the Son of God knows when
[1:43:40] the rapture is going to take place only
[1:43:42] the father in Souls and armed personnel
[1:43:47] program since the seven is always the
[1:43:49] mystery watch that seven that's the
[1:43:50] finish that was the coming of the Lord
[1:43:54] heaven was quiet silent nobody moved
[1:43:56] because jesus said himself not an even
[1:43:58] angel heaven knows when I'll return I
[1:44:00] don't even know it myself what time the
[1:44:02] father has put in his mind God alone
[1:44:04] knows of the Spirit and said I don't
[1:44:06] know it then it wasn't revealed and when
[1:44:11] the seventh trumpet sounded of the
[1:44:13] seventh angel seal was open and there
[1:44:15] was silence in the heaven see it wasn't
[1:44:16] given away what would
[1:44:18] place so John didn't write any symbol
[1:44:20] cuz there was no symbol given to it God
[1:44:22] want to keep it a secret brother branham
[1:44:26] said remember the seven seals where he
[1:44:28] said were revealed day by day in March
[1:44:30] 1963 remember he hid the Seventh Seal
[1:44:33] from us he wouldn't do it when the angel
[1:44:35] stood by day by day but then he wouldn't
[1:44:38] do it on that one he said their silence
[1:44:39] didn't having no one knew it it was the
[1:44:41] coming of the Lord so see the reason
[1:44:44] their silence in heaven is because the
[1:44:45] Lord has come oh thank you lord
[1:44:48] is everybody catching this tonight are
[1:44:51] you catching it the seventh seal has
[1:44:53] been revealed to us we know it's the day
[1:44:54] in the hour has the reality form
[1:44:56] happened no that's what we're all here
[1:44:58] for that's why you're here in church
[1:45:00] tonight is because you're waiting for
[1:45:01] the the Rebbe the reality for mother 7co
[1:45:03] to happen raise your hand if you're
[1:45:05] waiting for the reality form of the
[1:45:06] Seventh Seal anybody waiting for that
[1:45:07] that's the whole thing I'm waiting for
[1:45:09] is for the reality of the opening of the
[1:45:12] Seventh Seal to strike me amen that's
[1:45:15] what I'm waiting for for the rapture so
[1:45:18] why was there silence in heaven brother
[1:45:19] man tells us plain he said the whole
[1:45:21] time the angels are crying holy holy
[1:45:23] holy there's silence because Jesus the
[1:45:27] body of Jesus stands and leaves the
[1:45:29] throne and heaven and comes down to meet
[1:45:31] his bride there here's her brother F
[1:45:32] says it in the Sardis and church age and
[1:45:34] Jesus comes from heaven with ten
[1:45:36] thousand times ten thousand of his
[1:45:38] saints and the Bible says that the
[1:45:40] heavens was empty for the space of half
[1:45:42] an hour where is this big fellow God
[1:45:45] then uh-huh see he's in Christ oh
[1:45:51] holiday where is God how come the angels
[1:45:54] are quiet where is this big fella that
[1:45:56] used to sit on the throne he's down
[1:45:57] there getting his bride oh he went in to
[1:46:01] snatch away his life amen before Satan
[1:46:05] could pull off his tribulation
[1:46:06] destruction and his wrath he went and
[1:46:10] got caught his bride away snatched her
[1:46:12] away the word rapture means snatch to
[1:46:14] snatch up before the destruction strikes
[1:46:17] the earth where is that big fella he's
[1:46:20] meeting his bride in the air
[1:46:23] thank you Jesus Christ the mystery of
[1:46:26] God reveal God's great mystery of it's a
[1:46:29] secret he kept it a secret nobody know -
[1:46:31] nothing
[1:46:32] about it even the Angels didn't
[1:46:33] understand it see he didn't reveal it
[1:46:34] that's the reason under our seventh
[1:46:36] mystery when the seventh seal was open
[1:46:38] there was silence Jesus when he was on
[1:46:40] earth they wanted to know when he would
[1:46:41] come he said it's not even the son
[1:46:43] himself don't even know when it's going
[1:46:46] to happen
[1:46:46] see God has all this to himself it's a
[1:46:52] secret Christ in Ministry of God
[1:46:54] revealed and that's the reason there was
[1:46:55] silence in heaven for the space of half
[1:46:56] an hour and seven thunders under their
[1:46:58] voices and John was even forbidden to
[1:47:00] ride at sea the coming of the Lord
[1:47:02] that's one thing he has a revealed yet
[1:47:04] of how he will come and when he will
[1:47:06] come it's a good thing that he doesn't
[1:47:09] what if everybody knew the rapture was
[1:47:11] going to take place on let's just say
[1:47:13] you know 11 and 11 you know something
[1:47:15] like that
[1:47:15] what if everybody knew they'd wait until
[1:47:18] the 10th to get ready
[1:47:19] wait they would live like a devil all
[1:47:22] the way up to the 10th but that night
[1:47:25] they say a few prayers Oh Lord I want to
[1:47:27] be right forgive me get out of jail card
[1:47:31] get out of Hell card get out of
[1:47:33] tribulation card but see Jesus keeps it
[1:47:35] a secret
[1:47:36] because he only wants those that are
[1:47:38] going that way to live right in godly
[1:47:40] all the time hey I don't care it's gonna
[1:47:43] be they just want to be ready praise God
[1:47:46] and they're making themselves ready
[1:47:48] every day not just on Sunday or
[1:47:50] Wednesday every day that you understand
[1:47:52] every day they make themselves ready
[1:47:54] every day you ought to make yourself
[1:47:56] ready Wednesday and Sunday too I do I
[1:47:59] know about that I prayed a little harder
[1:48:00] prayers you know be more sincere days I
[1:48:02] got a preach of course we're all human
[1:48:07] Christ a mystery God again
[1:48:09] the coming Lord is in a mystery now we
[1:48:11] don't know when he's coming how he's
[1:48:12] coming but we know he is coming and so
[1:48:17] was all the mysteries of God waiting for
[1:48:18] this last day after he's already been
[1:48:22] completed well then he reveals and shows
[1:48:24] us what he's done oh my he never gave
[1:48:26] his mystery in every let's say info
[1:48:28] ready in full so Jesus gave some of the
[1:48:32] revelation of 7 sealed we know it's the
[1:48:33] day an hour but he didn't give all of it
[1:48:35] it wasn't given in full and remember if
[1:48:39] we go back to that slide to go back to
[1:48:42] those
[1:48:43] three parts now this has the fifth sixth
[1:48:45] and seventh seal but I just copied and
[1:48:47] pasted this over on a separate slide
[1:48:49] this has been shown there was no symbol
[1:48:51] this is not known but this is known we
[1:48:54] know what the revelation of the Seventh
[1:48:55] Seal is it's the day in the hour of the
[1:48:57] rapture of the bride of Jesus Christ
[1:48:58] we know what that is because he asked to
[1:49:02] leave heaven so they stopped they
[1:49:03] stopped worshiping their silence he
[1:49:05] comes down and he takes his wife Hey
[1:49:07] all right now that church is this simple
[1:49:12] is this simple I hope so
[1:49:15] if not I'll preach it again Sunday night
[1:49:17] I can't do something that next Wednesday
[1:49:18] night I'll go through a little slower if
[1:49:20] you want but I won't everybody how you
[1:49:23] want the young I want my son and my
[1:49:24] daughters I want them to catch it that
[1:49:26] the seven seal is the last seal because
[1:49:28] that's what we're all longing for that's
[1:49:30] the V you know church I hope understand
[1:49:32] that's the very climax of history when
[1:49:35] Jesus Christ comes back and takes his
[1:49:37] bride away everything falls apart after
[1:49:40] that the Bible said that that God will
[1:49:43] that he will let as long as he's here as
[1:49:46] long as the Holy Spirit's here got a
[1:49:48] little this sin going on but once the
[1:49:50] Holy Spirit takes the bride off then
[1:49:52] there's no more mercy it's all judgment
[1:49:54] and that's the end of our history that's
[1:49:57] the end of all things because it's all
[1:49:59] going to end in a short three and a half
[1:50:00] year or shortly period after that it's
[1:50:02] all going to end sure that for that it's
[1:50:04] the presence of the Holy Spirit in the
[1:50:06] bride today that's keeping judgment off
[1:50:08] the earth amen so like I told you on
[1:50:14] March 22nd that's what I believe I
[1:50:16] believe it's right where the RAM said
[1:50:17] the thunders are already uttered the
[1:50:20] fifth seal literally sounded on earth on
[1:50:22] March 22nd I'm sorry the fifth under
[1:50:24] rather the sixth Thunder uttered on
[1:50:27] March 23rd and the seven thunders
[1:50:30] uttered its voice on March 24 1963
[1:50:33] because remember that book was open it
[1:50:35] was brought down in Christ
[1:50:37] roars the Bible said he roar like a lion
[1:50:38] lion represents profit according to a
[1:50:41] most 378 when a lion roar who doesn't
[1:50:44] fear right sure the Lord God will do
[1:50:46] know nothing but he revealed the secret
[1:50:48] unto his servants the prophets
[1:50:49] so he comes down here he low roars like
[1:50:52] a lion programs preaching little man's
[1:50:54] preaching the gospel and the lion is
[1:50:56] wrong
[1:50:56] out the thunders of God and God's people
[1:50:59] heard it and rejoiced submit and their
[1:51:01] hearts are being turned to the
[1:51:03] Pentecostal fathers they met Oh
[1:51:04] hallelujah exactly right I don't get
[1:51:08] more on the seven seals I know about you
[1:51:09] but I don't get bored on them because
[1:51:11] they all point to the coming of my Lord
[1:51:14] doesn't bore me does it it's not
[1:51:16] education to me it's revelation to me
[1:51:18] because I'm flying above the pay a horse
[1:51:21] rider because I got anointing to fly
[1:51:24] above sin that's what it means I'm
[1:51:25] flying above sin okay let me close now
[1:51:29] now the whole reason and this might I
[1:51:32] hope this is okay the whole reason I
[1:51:34] went with over the seven thunders and
[1:51:36] the movement was to show this this seven
[1:51:40] thunders movement added on to the Bible
[1:51:42] because there was nothing in the Bible
[1:51:44] that said this the seven thunders were
[1:51:46] about the the the statute River man
[1:51:48] there that was never in the Bible and
[1:51:51] let me tell you this brother Branham
[1:51:53] says some people may say oh see it's
[1:51:58] written on the inside and the backside
[1:51:59] some people may say there's things in
[1:52:01] the Bible we've got to know to make the
[1:52:03] rapture let me tell you that's a lie I'm
[1:52:06] gonna show you about 10 quotes that
[1:52:07] prove it oh there's there's things that
[1:52:09] aren't written the Bible brother Aaron
[1:52:11] that we got a sister Connie you know you
[1:52:12] gotta you gotta you got to understand
[1:52:14] things that are not in the Bible
[1:52:15] to go on the rapture that's a lie from
[1:52:17] Hell program says it let's read it
[1:52:22] we will never add to the Word of God
[1:52:25] this word is complete and they're cursed
[1:52:29] you're cursed if you add to this or take
[1:52:31] one word away you're cursed by God to do
[1:52:34] it so see it's without understanding the
[1:52:37] group that did that they added on to it
[1:52:39] look what happened falling apart God
[1:52:42] does that God let time go on just to
[1:52:43] show that that was a heresy Milgram says
[1:52:47] we'll never add to the word now brother
[1:52:50] I was preaching in the seventh seal okay
[1:52:53] you know what let me see I'm gonna skip
[1:52:55] this because if this is where he says
[1:53:01] okay this is where
[1:53:02] the Seventh Seal has not even written
[1:53:04] the word it's a total secret that angels
[1:53:06] everything shut up he said what is the
[1:53:08] Seventh Seal it's the thing that Jesus
[1:53:09] said not even the angels of heaven
[1:53:11] didn't know nothing about see he didn't
[1:53:13] know it himself said only God would know
[1:53:16] it so I'm just proving to you in the
[1:53:17] seventh seal brother Branham said what
[1:53:19] the seventh seal was it was the coming
[1:53:21] of Christ all right now let me get to
[1:53:23] these quotes I must have put that slide
[1:53:25] yeah I put that slide in the wrong spot
[1:53:26] I'm sorry forgive me let me put it in
[1:53:28] the right spot that will help us we'll
[1:53:33] never add to the word man so now we
[1:53:36] believe that God can do things that he
[1:53:37] has not written the word but we like to
[1:53:39] stay just with what he's written well
[1:53:44] God couldn't do that but if it's not
[1:53:45] written no thanks
[1:53:48] that's my brother BAM balled out
[1:53:49] preachers that said oh I've got blood in
[1:53:51] my hands
[1:53:52] you need to have blood your hands like
[1:53:53] the Holy Ghost then you've got the Holy
[1:53:55] Ghost we got blood your hands that's not
[1:53:56] in the Bible so it's not true if people
[1:53:59] aren't do things outside the Bible
[1:54:00] that's up to them what brother I'm said
[1:54:02] I'm just gonna stay with the Bible then
[1:54:06] we know for sure if you just stay with
[1:54:08] what's written in the word amen I just
[1:54:13] feel good I'm just gonna dance around
[1:54:15] yeah thank you Jesus I just feel good
[1:54:18] tonight we don't got to add one thing to
[1:54:20] this Bible Church we just gotta follow I
[1:54:22] know what this word amen
[1:54:24] this Holy Word we don't had nothing
[1:54:28] twittered there's nothing out there it's
[1:54:29] all in the Word of God and the Holy
[1:54:31] Spirit will guide us into all the truth
[1:54:32] of the word amen hallelujah Thank You
[1:54:37] Laura I'm just feeling inspired tonight
[1:54:39] amen Oh someone said brother branham
[1:54:43] well them seven seals brother branham
[1:54:45] that we'll be revealing the last day
[1:54:47] some great mystery how we get closer to
[1:54:49] God the RAM said no sir
[1:54:51] can't be who suffer
[1:54:56] take one word from this Bible or add one
[1:54:57] to it his part will be taken from the
[1:54:59] book of life what it is is a revelation
[1:55:03] of what has been missed back there to
[1:55:05] bring it's already wrote here it's in
[1:55:11] here and to make you feel good it's to
[1:55:17] reveal what already has been written see
[1:55:21] because you can't add one thing to it or
[1:55:23] take one word from it
[1:55:24] and the church said pieces the trumpets
[1:55:28] he keeps going now I'm gonna skip that
[1:55:30] because I gotta finish piece of trumpet
[1:55:35] same quote same quote oh hey here's
[1:55:41] another one let's see yeah so this is
[1:55:45] from 1965 someone said to me now well
[1:55:47] now some day the Lord probably you see
[1:55:49] visions Bill Graham will reveal to you
[1:55:51] what these things are and we can all get
[1:55:54] closer to God and have more power than
[1:55:56] we get in speaking in tongues and things
[1:55:57] I said it can't be that way because see
[1:56:02] I believe that were to be the truth and
[1:56:03] the Bible said whoever had one were to
[1:56:05] take one word from it it has to be in
[1:56:06] this word see it's the mysteries that
[1:56:08] the people have overlooked I hope you
[1:56:13] understand me tonight your chair our
[1:56:16] biggest concern tonight is that we do
[1:56:20] not overlook what's already been
[1:56:22] preached to us sometimes people are so
[1:56:25] busy searching for something new
[1:56:27] something new something new outside of
[1:56:28] the word and this whole time brother
[1:56:32] Graham saying it's not something outside
[1:56:34] it's not something way out there it's
[1:56:36] gonna be something that people are just
[1:56:37] reading over and they just read over the
[1:56:41] rapture they just they just read it over
[1:56:44] a heart that's turned back to the
[1:56:47] Apostolic fathers it's not very
[1:56:52] interesting that some program says I
[1:56:54] just come on give me something new and
[1:56:57] God's like it's right under your nose
[1:57:02] just get your nose
[1:57:03] in the book just gets your face in the
[1:57:05] book right but the people's overlooked
[1:57:10] well right there is where my message of
[1:57:12] the serpentine the true belief of the
[1:57:13] security believer comes where the
[1:57:15] serpentine come from church it came from
[1:57:17] the book not outside the book it came
[1:57:21] from the mouth came in today even now
[1:57:24] the Holy Spirit the supernatural power
[1:57:26] God is in the earth moving showing
[1:57:27] things and people run from it
[1:57:29] now I'm gonna skip this this is where
[1:57:31] program says not God doesn't heal
[1:57:33] everybody and he gives the example of
[1:57:34] John 5 where God here jesus healed a
[1:57:37] impotent man but there were some times
[1:57:39] God did heal everybody we know that some
[1:57:41] skipping past that let's go to these
[1:57:42] quotes oh I love this this is good oh
[1:57:47] look at this this is what I hear
[1:57:49] Pentecostal people say all the time
[1:57:50] because I work with them Church but
[1:57:51] please listen to me I work with them
[1:57:52] I've had them I've heard them preaches
[1:57:54] the kids of Bible club and I just sit
[1:57:56] there bow my head like no that's just
[1:57:57] wrong they they say well kids we can go
[1:57:59] to the hospital raise up ever in the
[1:58:01] hospital Mike no we can't and the
[1:58:05] Pentecostal ER let me drop this to you
[1:58:07] you're looking for a time to come that
[1:58:09] when there's going to be men rise up on
[1:58:10] the earth and go out in hospitals and
[1:58:13] deliver them and say the whole Hospital
[1:58:15] move out brother says don't you never be
[1:58:19] deceived like that you believe me it's a
[1:58:25] lie it never was done see it never was
[1:58:31] in the book did Peter and John and Paul
[1:58:37] do they go into hospitals and pull
[1:58:38] everybody out no but see the Pentecostal
[1:58:42] people they saw us try to try to say oh
[1:58:43] you have greater faith greater works
[1:58:45] than these will do program said it's not
[1:58:46] greater than Jesus you can't do any
[1:58:48] greater than creating or walking on
[1:58:50] water he said it just means more more of
[1:58:54] the same through a many membered Bride
[1:58:57] he said don't you never be to see like
[1:59:00] that you believe me that you believe
[1:59:01] that's a lie let's say that was a
[1:59:05] hospital he went in there by leading of
[1:59:06] the Spirit he found one man so he's
[1:59:08] talked about Jesus in John chapter 5 he
[1:59:09] found one man the hospital he spoke to
[1:59:13] that man he told him the secrets of his
[1:59:15] life told him
[1:59:16] there he wasn't able to walk and so
[1:59:18] forth okay all right let's say in our
[1:59:21] feet I'm gonna stop right there there
[1:59:23] was more I must have skipped over I
[1:59:29] thought there was more I must have
[1:59:38] skipped past it off to go through there
[1:59:41] and find that but I hope everybody
[1:59:42] understands we do not need anything
[1:59:46] outside the Bible we're not looking on
[1:59:48] the back side of a book looking for
[1:59:49] different things we just want to not
[1:59:52] overlook we just want to see what's
[1:59:54] already written right before us we just
[1:59:57] don't want to overlook the power of the
[1:59:58] seven seals hope you understand that's
[2:00:05] why we got to be careful you know I
[2:00:06] think Aaron and I talked about one time
[2:00:08] when if people are saying we got to have
[2:00:09] more that's true we may need more
[2:00:10] revelation but if we get revelation with
[2:00:12] rapture it's not going to come outside
[2:00:13] the Bible it's gonna be what's already
[2:00:14] written right here we just been having
[2:00:16] paying attention or in other words like
[2:00:18] this the Holy Spirit hasn't moved us to
[2:00:20] it yet that sounds better because I'm
[2:00:23] about to I'm paying attention every
[2:00:25] service I preach I'm trying to I take
[2:00:27] all those notes I try to prove
[2:00:29] everything I'm saying is the truth as a
[2:00:31] workman rightly dividing the the truth
[2:00:33] right I'm not ashamed of what I preach
[2:00:35] if you would know what I preach it's
[2:00:36] right up there I'll show it to everybody
[2:00:38] if they want to copy my notes they can
[2:00:39] have a copy of my notes I'm not ashamed
[2:00:41] of what I preach I'm preaching the truth
[2:00:43] of God but the point is we're not
[2:00:45] looking for something out there we're
[2:00:47] looking for a more revelation of what
[2:00:48] God has already given to us amen now how
[2:00:52] much you come here let's worship the
[2:00:54] Lord here I hope by this everybody can
[2:00:58] see the importance of the seven seals
[2:01:00] I understand there's men that are not
[2:01:04] called to preach and they preach on the
[2:01:05] seven seals and they lower the faith of
[2:01:07] people that's true and that's what the
[2:01:09] brothers were saying when they were here
[2:01:10] because I talked to brother Joe
[2:01:11] afterwards that's what they were saying
[2:01:13] those brothers had no annoyed I'm sorry
[2:01:15] the false teachers have no anointing
[2:01:17] they just make the seals all
[2:01:18] intellectual
[2:01:19] but when you preach the seals the right
[2:01:21] way you're saying children of God repent
[2:01:25] of your sins and get the Holy Ghost
[2:01:27] anointing that you can fly above your
[2:01:29] addictions amen and five of your
[2:01:32] problems you can soar above
[2:01:34] denominations and creeds and every sin
[2:01:37] you can mate everything you feel in your
[2:01:39] body your mind you've got a 5 of that by
[2:01:42] the power of the Holy Spirit that's what
[2:01:44] we're saying and whatever you have to do
[2:01:46] to do that do it get on your knees raise
[2:01:48] your hands run the aisles
[2:01:50] whatever you do without we have to do to
[2:01:52] get that anointing just make sure you're
[2:01:53] born again that's not that's not
[2:01:58] intellectualism that's pointing
[2:01:59] everybody for the baptism of the Holy
[2:02:01] Ghost and the church said that's what
[2:02:05] we're all trying to do that's what I'm
[2:02:06] trying to do every preacher I write up
[2:02:07] here that's what I want them all you
[2:02:09] point everybody to the Holy Ghost
[2:02:10] it'll never add to this or take away it
[2:02:13] always point you to what you've
[2:02:14] overlooked what I've overlooked because
[2:02:18] we all need God's grace
[2:02:20] none of us that are any better than
[2:02:22] anyone else
[2:02:22] praise the Lord if none of us hear that
[2:02:26] I'm so good I don't need the blood of
[2:02:27] Christ if you think that you are lost
[2:02:30] we all need the blood of Christ and we
[2:02:32] all need his grace every hour that's
[2:02:36] power hits you in church I know listen
[2:02:40] me I'm not just preaching this for our
[2:02:42] church I know there's numerous families
[2:02:43] streaming tonight and all over the
[2:02:45] country and I believe it'll help them
[2:02:48] too by God's grace so the way I'm
[2:02:49] preaching I hope you understand it's for
[2:02:52] its for more than just us people are
[2:02:55] pulling on the worth of God in a
[2:02:56] different place just a few but they're
[2:02:58] still pulling now I want to feed those
[2:02:59] few they don't have a pastor on a feed
[2:03:01] on until the Holy Spirit can point them
[2:03:03] to a pastor
[2:03:05] because I'm not the pastor of YouTube
[2:03:06] I'm not the pastor of anyone else but
[2:03:09] I'm pointing them to a pastor that's
[2:03:10] what I'm trying to do by God's grace
[2:03:15] have any father Oh God
[2:03:18] thank you lord oh I feel your bonus
[2:03:21] tonight Lord Jesus I feel the confidence
[2:03:25] in Christ tonight hallelujah Jesus thank
[2:03:31] you Lord for this word of Revelation
[2:03:34] chapter 5 amen
[2:03:36] thank you lord oh this book written on
[2:03:40] the backside and within Lord God
[2:03:42] hallelujah your prophet has told us
[2:03:45] we're not to add to this book or take
[2:03:48] away from it
[2:03:49] hallelujah Lord open our eyes Lord God
[2:03:52] that we not overlook things in the word
[2:03:56] open our eyes to see or give us fresh
[2:04:00] eye salvus we're not seeing the Bible as
[2:04:03] helpful if we're not understanding the
[2:04:06] Bible you can't see it or it's all
