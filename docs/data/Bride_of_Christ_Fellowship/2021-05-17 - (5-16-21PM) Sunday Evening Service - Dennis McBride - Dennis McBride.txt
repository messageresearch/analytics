far as where i came from and and you know uh it's my journey up to this point so i pray the lord help me in that so in our bibles let's turn to ephesians chapter 2. we appreciate everything that's been done since we've been here including for sure the fellowship it's been very sweet and good and we just thank god it's been a very enjoyable and blessed weekend for me amen so ephesians chapter 2 starting at verse 1 familiar scripture of course it says and you hath thee quickened who were dead in trespasses and sins wherein in times past you walked according to the course of this world according to the prince of the power of the heir the spirit that now worketh in the children of disobedience among whom also we have we all had our conversation in times past in the lusts of our flesh fulfilling the desires of the flesh and of the mind and we're by nature the children of wrath even as others but god who was rich in mercy for his great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead and sins have quickened us together with christ by grace are ye saved and have raised us up together and made us sit together in heavenly places in christ jesus that in the ages to come he might show the exceeding riches of his grace and his kindness toward us through christ jesus for by grace are ye saved through faith and that not of yourselves it is the gift of god not of works unless any man should boast amen may the lord bless the reading of his word saints i didn't pray that i i need to pray amen let's pray heavenly father we thank you for allowing us to be here lord we pray that you would help us at this time fatherly or just direct this lord especially toward the young children father god to bring them to uh esteem what they have in a greater way father help us to do that lord in jesus christ's name we ask you amen amen amen god bless you all right um [Music] i'm gonna share with you a quotation here uh there are many things that god shared through his prophet it has really helped me along along the way but um this particular quotation here has meant a lot to me because i could really relate to it in regards to my life prior to coming to god and being exposed to the message of the hour when i heard the prophet say these things it was an immediate connection i can identify with it you know he talked about the little boy that never saw a mirror before you know and he sees a mirror and he makes a movement and then the mirror the image in the mirror makes the same movement and then he comes to a realization that's me you know and and that's that's what this had you know that's what it did for me in my life so this is from the god who was rich in mercy um and he goes on to say here he says for when god had you in his thinking at the beginning he says you have to be he says some part of you your life that's in you now had to be with god before there he says well when he before he even become material on earth before there was anything but god you were one of his attributes and we've heard these things over the years right but i do realize that it's a difference or yeah it is a difference between hearing something and then god actually quickening it to you because there are many things that i've heard many times over but it wasn't until the latter time that god actually helped me to see and understand okay wow i see it now you know so we hear these things or whatever but you know for the young people or what have you i know it'll come a time where god will make it real to you by his grace all right so he's saying that we were one of god's attributes he says he know what your name would be how many believe that amen so my mom and dad just didn't come up with a name hey man god already knew my name was dennis before my mom and dad were even born amen one thing i always consider when jesus was talking about elijah and he was talking about how he was going to come but how he's already come yes right yeah he could have called brother brandon's name right there but he held that yeah he looked he looked right at brother branham's face when he was speaking of that future coming of elijah amen he could have called his name but he held it because it wasn't time yet for that name to be made known so for every one of us god knew us prior to us coming amen we we i believe we were a part of him right a personal part of him right okay so he goes on to say he know what your name would be he know what color of hair you would have he knowed all about you you know and that goes into people that kind of want to alter themselves you know god made you in the way that he wanted you to be you know but the world again the influence of the world it influences people to make them not appreciate how they are right you know and try to live up to another standard then you have people trying to make themselves look like other people when god to you to god you're beautiful just like you are you're perfect amen amen he wants us to be able to appreciate that okay he knowed all about you he says the only thing happened he says is you when you being a sinner he says many of you can fellowship with me on this thought and here's here's the meat of it here saints when you were you when you were a little boy or a little girl you would walk around there he says would be certain things that would just he says where it wouldn't bother the other kids it seemed like there was something in you that cried out when i was young just to let you know a little bit about myself i was born in brooklyn new york my memory of brooklyn is zero because while i was one years old there was something that happened uh i don't know if my mom ever found out who it was but uh we lived in new york we lived in a you know an apartment unit of course the floors hi how many it was i don't know but at whatever apartment we were in there was a knock at the door and there was somebody there to do my mom harm and they uh forced their way in and they they went to assaulting my mom and my mom told me that uh the only thing she could do for me was take me and yeah i guess it was a couch that was there she flipped the couch over and she actually tucked me up under the couch and the person just started to assault my mom uh and i don't know how long it went on but whenever the person left my mom was kind of semi-conscious and she was able to remember where she put me and she got me and she went stumbling down the hallway and when she got to a certain door of a neighbor she's in her own words to me and my mom our home wasn't a christian home so i didn't grow up in a christian home it was it was it was worldly it was full of the things of the world so when my mom telling me this uh she she wouldn't try to sound spiritual but she said that when she got to the door of the neighbor she said the door just opened up and nobody was by the door and she looked down and said the neighbors were sitting there looking at her from the couch and when they saw her condition they rushed out to help her so from that my mom got put into the hospital and she was in the hospital for over a month trying to recover so during that time my grandmother which lived in south carolina she came and flew up and got me and that's how i got to south carolina from new york but even in that it was god's will that i go to south carolina you know there's nothing that happens within a believer's life that's just half hazard we believe that you know i'm speaking to you now whatever but each one of us have different backgrounds and things of that nature different upbringings uh and my purpose this morning is just again to help the young people to be able to more appreciate what you have within your parents and how you're actually being raised so my grandmother came and got me when my mother got better she came down her and my father went married so when she got better she came down uh and for whatever the reason was my dad didn't come down so i grew up without my dad uh only child uh and got here mom got here you know she tried to get her life together and whatever you know she wanted to go into nursing and she entered into the nursing field you know the beginning stages of it uh where she would just kind of assist whatever the term is for i don't know what it is but she was an assistant she transported patients and just did like little light work when it came to the nursing part nothing real in depth uh you know at a certain point a certain time period we were doing fairly well you know i wasn't hungry wasn't lacking for anything we stayed in an apartment complex and you know we had the little necessities of life weren't rich by any means but we had the necessities of life she was able to take care of me you know decently but then as time went on um some people became some people uh were introduced into my mom's life and there's one person in particular that was introduced to my my mom's life uh and it was another woman but it was a major turning point from the time that person into my mom's life everything went downhill you know she entered into a life of drugs and i know we've heard about the different type drugs that are out there there's not a drug that's out out there outside of a few that my mom didn't try uh right before my eyes i just saw everything just kind of crumble down and so my grandmother she didn't live far away and she was always concerned about me and uh you know basically our apartment became like a drug location uh i would wake up in the middle of the night sometimes to go and use the restroom and the restrooms across the hall from my bedroom but if i looked up the hall to my left i could partially see the kitchen and sometimes in the middle of the night i'll wake up to go use the restroom and i'll look and there'll be strangers in my home and they'll be in there using drugs and stuff like that you know uh but now now that i look back at it i marvel i marvel because god was keeping me so here i am a young man growing up in this kind of an environment right there was an acknowledgment of god but there was no serving of god okay so i'm growing up in this environment and that's why when i i read this because the neighborhood we lived in god you know as i grew up i got to be 10 11 12 or whatever you know um that's malachi your son's name malachi how old are you you're 14. okay so between 12 and 14 the guys in in the apartment complex that i lived in uh they you know as far as they were out there pretty deeply even at a young age they were stealing cars brand new cars off of car lots and they they would take them and hide them and they would come and invite me to go and ride with them and i'm gonna read this again because he says here uh many of you can fellowship with me in this thought when you were when you was a little boy or a little girl he says you would walk around and there would be certain things he says with just where it wouldn't bother the other kids it seemed like there was something in you that cried out he says there was a god somewhere he says yet you were a sinner he said you remember that and as i'm listening to this i'm like lord i remember that and where those guys would come and try to get me to go and take joy rides with them in stolen cars something in me say no i can't do it and what it was was this saints he said you remember that he said certainly he says now what was that he says that was the little form of life in you then and then after a while he said you heard the gospel maybe you went to church he said you picked out this and that he says it went from denomination to denomination he says but one day you being a part of god you had to be a part of the word and when you heard the word he says you know where you come from you know what was the truth he says you are always he says the seed was always in you he says the word seen the word that was in you he says that was before the foundation of the world saw the word in you and you come to it so he was talking about the effects of the seed that was that seed was already in us it was in me and and god was influencing me through that seed even though i didn't know him it's the thing that made me uncomfortable that didn't allow me to go to certain extents that other kids could go to around about 12 or 13 years old living this living in this apartment complex living in those conditions there was something in me that was crying out to the point to where i would get up on my own and get myself dressed and i would walk the church i found a church nearby and i walked i went to that church on my own at 12 years old what was that that was the god who was rich in mercy what was he doing he knew who i was he knew i was a part of him he knew today i'll be here preaching isn't that something and not just me but all of us when we were young little little lads and things running around here you know living like contrary lives and in in wrong situations and whatever god was watching every one of us wherever we were and things could have turned out a lot worse the things i had become engaged in had it could have had a i wouldn't even be here today i would be dead the situations i was in you know outside one time i i didn't know what what crack cocaine was i didn't know what drugs was you know and i'm standing outside and it's a young guy that was involved with that lifestyle and he rolled by on a bike and he asked me to hold my hand out and hold something for him until he got back i'm just a little kid and i'm just standing outside i held my hand out he put it in there i didn't know what it was soon after a police patrol a police patrol car came running through ride through the neighborhood it was looking for him he circled back around and reappeared and asked me to give it back to him i gave it back to him it wasn't until years later i realized that was drugs that was on me i literally saw police come and knock on my like they knocked on my door because there was drugs being housed within the apartment and they literally bust down the door i had to go to my grandmother's house but yet in the midst of all of that there was something that was protecting me it was god message called come follow me he says i think sometimes in going to school now i think send becky and sarah and joseph he says into these these high schools and things he says where all this is going on he says i think i'll take take them and get them back into the mountain and raise them up there like the indians live why did he say that he was concerned about the activity and just just the way that the age was and the influences that were so dominant amongst young people you know you hear now today about you know young people bringing guns to school stuff like that look at the shootings that's taking place you know it's just so much we don't want to go into all the little group no details of everything but you can just see what's out there even amongst the young groups the young crowds know when i was growing up it's just a lot saints but he was concerned about the upbringing of his children in these environments because he didn't want the influences of the world a man to infiltrate to penetrate his children's lives and he goes on to say but here he says and then this is very important here he says he says but here is what it is he says what's in the kid is going to come out no matter where it is it's got to he says it's going to come out he says if it's evil in there it'll come out in the indian count if it's good in there it'll come out in any camp see it's what the child he says is it's what's in the kid the makeup of the kid he says what's on the inside of you and what you are now is what you'll probably be the rest of your life he says you're on a changing spot he's noticed this now he says do you know do you know what 86 percent of the other conversions to jesus christ has done before 21 years old all right he says it shows it statistics show and 86 percent that come to christ come before their 21. he says you he says after you pass that age you become more molded or set in your ways that's why amen though in those most impressionable years those are the most critical now i say that but also he brings a balance to it god can do anything so he's not saying thus saith the lord this is exactly how this is going you know no because god he went i was past 20. you know when when when i really felt the call of god and i felt compelled to begin to give my life to god i i had gone to the marine corps gotten out of the marine corps and i was past 20. you know what i mean so what he's saying here is not just like 100 across the board but he's just pointing out the the facts that he had come across at that time he's talking about statistics that he had come across right he goes on to say this he says you after you pass that age you become more molded and said in your ways oh it's possible sure he says they come 70 80 years old he says but it's very rare he says you make yourself when you're young i'm talking about the god who was rich in mercy because me according to my lifestyle meaning the environment i grew up in what i was exposed to i should be a much different man than what i am today but what made the difference it's that seed people can't make themselves good we realize that right amen brother branham talked about a social gospel that was being preached among the people it wasn't doing nothing for the people but but it go it goes deeper than that because if if predestination isn't there isn't a part of that person's life meaning being predestinated unto god to into me to manifest a part of god in the time that you're in that's the only thing that matters that seed is not there there ain't even anything in there to quicken unless you have the gene of god you can't even receive you can't truly be baptized by the holy ghost in the soul it's that gene of god that's in the soul already when we come into the world the gene of god is already in us isn't that right and in god's appointed time he creates the atmosphere around us to draw us into his presence and he begins to work on us and what is it doing is creating the atmosphere or the conditions around the seed for a birth to take place so now i'm i'm living with my grandmother now from 13 years old onward because the conditions in the home was too bad you know i'm growing up with my grandmother she did the best she could she was living on a fixed income and so there was a lot of things so when i was speaking this morning on the gauging success i experienced a lot of that you know i didn't have a lot my grandma couldn't provide a lot for me but i was going to school and i felt the pressures both spoken and unspoken i wanted to be accepted i wanted to be like everybody else i wanted to be looked at looked upon as being you know one of the cool dudes in the school you know so in order to do that you got to have certain things you got to have certain clothes and certain name brands and things of that nature you know so what did i do at 15 years old i went out and got me a job and i blew all of my money i had no money saved every check i got went on close why because i wanted to live up to a certain standard that my peers were calling for isn't that something i should have saved my mind amen i already had a good bit of money in the bank versus being broke trying to impress somebody that don't even care nothing about you that don't mean nothing to you so when we hear little things coming from other kids and things of that nature and whatever you you can't put a lot of weight on that don't put no weight on it you know you got to be able you got to come to a place by the grace of god where you dismiss it amen just dismiss it and ask god to give you help and grace to be able to stand and continue to stand for what's right coming through school now started working bought my own clothes bought my own vehicle 12th year in high school middle of the 12th grade year i always tried to find a way to get out of class just for a little bit just to get a break so i tell the teacher can i use the restroom so yeah go ahead so now i'm walking down the corridor the hallways are empty because people are in class and i heard this door closed behind me it was the door to the main office area and when i turned around i saw this young girl 12th grade walking in the other direction i just saw the back side of her and because i was there for a while i kind of knew new people and my first thought was oh it's a new girl that started coming to the school she having a long skirt things of that nature you know so i went on to my class after some time or whatever i got a chance to see her face i was like man she's pretty pretty you know but one thing that caught me was that because of how pretty she was she was getting a lot of attention and and i ain't like attention like that and i said well now i know i'm not going to talk to her because she get too much attention and they might bring me trouble you know because if i talk to her and everybody else want to talk to her then they're going to have some problems so i said i'ma stay away from her all together because that's going to be trouble for me and so i got to a point to where you know i i was able to get what they call pm release that means you come to school and you get out at a certain time earlier than everybody else and i had to choose a class to go to in order to be able to do that so i chose economics and my first day in the class i stepped in the door and i looked to my right in the first chair that was there she was sitting right there so because she was sitting there i walked to the other side of the room and all the way back to the back and i sat in the back chair in the back so i can make sure i didn't talk to her and then one day i came to class and i forgot my book and the teacher i believe his name was mr welch he told me to sit by her and share books with her and when i did that is our first time beginning to talk and i guess that was that because she became my wife you know but then it was through her because her parents back in the early 80s along with brother charles's dad they were all a part of a pentecostal church called progressive brother brooks was there as well they were all going to the same church brother brooks and my father-in-law are best friends they've been friends since like young they had a lot of experiences together if you ask them they've been shot at together and everything they were best friends you know and even to this day they talk about every day but nonetheless though uh her parents came out from the progressive movement around about the early 80s that's when god was beginning to deal with all of them and a lot was done that was the first time any of them had seen the pillar of fire because they were claiming a parcel of ground that the church is now on they were claiming a parcel of ground for their own so that they can actually build a church and the man was reluctant to sell the land in the beginning but then god moved upon them to kind of go and be more bold and direct with the man in a good way and the man had a change of heart so what they did is they didn't have all the funds to build a church and whatever and so they came and they began to march around the land they all got together walked up the street and they marched around the land they were singing songs praising god and that was their way of claiming the land and actually asking god also to bless them to build a church and during that time is when everyone that was there actually saw the pillar of fire appear and hover over the group you know many people that were there saw it and that's a testimony i've heard many times over from the witnesses that was there but that was just god showing himself giving them something to anchor them in what they were doing because they had made a big decision to depart from what they had known for so long so now my wife was brought up as as the young people are in here now that she was actually brought up from that time as the message became introduced and they began to grow in the grace and the knowledge of god uh so now here i am coming in contact with her but not knowing what she's a part of but that was god see he was directing me the whole time that wasn't a haphazard meeting amen it was god leading so now i'm with her now i'm being introduced to her family and it wasn't until sometime later that i was actually told about the message of the hour you know and i can remember that the time in the day or rather not the time of the day but i can remember how it was and it was her her brother that was about 12 years old at that time he asked me he said have you ever heard of brother brandon i said no who is that they say come come on in the rooms i got a video i want you to see it was a 20th century prophet and he took me in a room and he put it was a vhs right vhs put in the vcr and it started playing my first time ever hearing his voice seeing him or whatever but i found myself just sitting there and just feeling to stay there and watch through the whole thing for some reason it caught my attention what was it it was god's light crossing my path god's light flashed across my path and something happened but i didn't realize what was happening i just knew that an interest had had had appeared in my heart and now i'm sitting there looking at this tape so from that point on that interest never left me my father-in-law had a washing machine in the basement it was full of tapes that don't sound right right the washing machine was broke and it just had tapes in it old sermons from the church plus a mixture of brother branham sermons was in there as well and i started coming home from work and i had a little tape recorder and i would go down into that washing machine and go in and just kind of look at the titles and whatever and kind of grab something that seemed like it interests me a little bit or whatever and i go and i put it in a tape player and i sit down on the floor and i just listen most of the tapes i got in the beginning seemed to always be the prayer lines and i had never grown up around anything like that so my first thought was is this real you know but i'm listening it's like i'm feel i'm listening to the whole thing and i keep coming home and i keep going down there getting more tapes and i started listening and listening then all of a sudden i started finding myself understanding some things and i got a notebook and i started writing little things down and then it just kind of began to build and build and build and build and grow and grow and grow so it was through my wife that the lord allowed me to come in contact with him in his move for this hour and i just found myself following i couldn't explain it to you i didn't know why it was just an agreement that was in my heart i didn't have i didn't have no questions as far as to question it is this right who is this man this i ain't that was none of that there it was just i don't know like it was something about what he was saying that just set well with me so like i'm saying here you know he was saying that the seed of god was in you then and watch how he says this again he says here uh he said you were always the seed of god the seeds the seed was always he says the seed was was in you always the word seeing the word that was in you that was before the foundation of the word saw the word the word that that was in you and you come to it so that was god flashing his light across my path and it caught my attention and from that point it wasn't all at once but then a changing of my life just began to set in now all of a sudden the more i gave myself to listening to this word certain things just the taste of the world just begin to leave me without without without things being just heartbroken and things of that nature it was just something that just began to happen i just didn't feel no more to do this or to do that you know it just started dropping the desire just started leaving me it started dropping off of my life and that just continued like that it continued it's continuing like that up until the day god is still helping me to be delivered and to be freed from from many different things but the man i am today i should not be based off of how i started but it was the god who was rich in mercy paul knew what his beginnings were he was he was an enemy of the cross working against it amen helping to imprison those that were apart listen that was a part of his own family when i say that meaning he was a part of that group and he didn't even know it stephen was his brother not blood brother but blood brother in christ he just he was still in ignorance he was still blinded he didn't know who he was but shortly after that what did god do god flashed across his path and he heard god's voice for the first time himself and what what what happened at that point it brought about a change it wasn't an immediate change it was just enough to stop him where he was and make him reconsider his ways then he left out god led him out away from everybody and dealt with his heart and when he came back from that visitation with god he came back with the same revelation that the rest of them had so it's not by works you know i mean even though we grow up in the church and things of that nature amen there is something that still has to happen with within each individual heart there's a real experience that must take place amen and that's that that's the real starting point right there now that's not to say that everything else was in vain no sir because all the preaching of the word that the young people are hearing and whatever guess what it's doing is like the watering of a seed that's been sown in the ground it creates an atmosphere around that seed is softening that hard shell that's harboring that germ amen and it's causing that shell to begin to break up lose its strength and begin to rot away so that that sunlight when it's beaming down now now it's causing the life that's in that germ to come forth that's where you see real boring again experiences take place you never know when it's going to happen how it's going to happen and what service it'll happen in but it's one thing for sure is going to happen amen god even though paul was persecuting him god was looking down on paul while he was a part of the pharisee group and god was identifying him as his son regardless of his condition yeah isn't that something god wasn't upset with paul because he was being who he was at that time he saw him as his son and he knew that he was going to come to that point to where he was going to leave what he was a part of and began to enter into god's purpose for his life more so but while he was in the pharisee religion guess what he was a son already the gene of god was already there isn't that something he had no clue though i'ma leave you with this scripture amen second corinthians chapter four verse six it says for god who commanded notice how he says this now he says for god who commanded the light to shine out of darkness isn't that something so that means that the light was tucked away inside of that darkness and when he called for the light the light began to shine out of darkness that woman at the well she had a seed in her but it was covered over isn't that right but when she came in contact with the message of her hour jesus christ manifesting himself according to his word right what did it do his presence commanded the light to shine out of darkness the sunlight from his rays of life it pulled the life out of that woman and brought it to the surface and it made her express the part of god that she was isn't that right yes but for those who had a show of religion right that same life it pulled what was really in them out and caused them to show their colors to show that you know what i'm not really on god's side like i thought i was right because now i'm finding myself hating the very manifestation of god that's in my day brother branham said the shining of the light of the life of god it blacked them all the way out because what little light they did have when they rejected and responded to god manifesting himself in that hour and the way they and they responded to him in the way they did it shut them all the way out he says now what little light they did have in the spirit and in the flesh they went to straight darkness isn't that something yes sir so i'm grateful for the god who was rich in mercy i'm grateful for what he's done in each one of our lives to bring us to where we are and the work ain't done yet but now we're in a place where we can actually i can relax more because i know who i am now maybe it's some that's maybe in here who don't quite know who you are you're a little confused you don't know maybe the devil is fighting you and telling you well you know maybe you're not a christian you got to dismiss all of those thoughts yes amen you believe god you you lord i believe i am a christian let that be your confession when you hear that spirit coming and talking and you trying to make you doubt that you combat it by saying the opposite don't settle down don't receive it block it out amen go turn on a sermon or something sing a song with something yes when we had a little mission work going back at home and whatever brother you met you didn't come did you didn't come and minister at our fellowship did you you did you remember mr wade him he's a he was an older man i'm just going to share this short portion of it he hadn't worked for many years so his his finances had dwindled all the way down he was he was barely getting by i mean like he didn't have nothing the lord blessed him to get a car a job or whatever you know but then things just wasn't panning out right just in the way that he would like for it to be and he had dealt with so much hardship and gone through through so many things he had just became real discouraged you never know what's going on with a person he was in the privacy of his own home the devil had gotten such a control over his mind until he he only he thought the only solution was was to take his life now i'm seeing him and i'm fellowshipping with him but i didn't notice that's where his mind had gone to and he had planned it out how he was gonna die he told me this after the fact planned it out how he was going to set it up how he was going to take his own life out he said and then something came to him and told him to go play a message and he went and he put on a message this is just a random message from brother branham he said something came to him right when he was having those thoughts of taking his life that night something came to him he said and told him to go and play one of the sermons i had given him a set he came to me later on after all of this days maybe weeks after and shared with me this testimony he said brother i'm telling you when i put that sermon on and i sat and i listened to it he says those thoughts completely left the desire to take his life completely left and it happened on more than one occasion he said so when the enemy comes and begins the war at the mine go put on the sermon yes go pray allow something to come in that's of the right spirit and the right boy it comes from god and allow it to begin to just to move upon you and minister to you and soothe you in your thoughts and in your mind settle you down because that's a battle and it's a spiritual battle and many times when we're having those battles we don't always distinguish things in the way that we should we know about the devil but yet when he's talking to our minds we don't always identify the voice as talking to us as the devil we find ourselves just in a place and the grace of god got to come and snap us out of it but he's rich in mercy he didn't allow him to take his life and i'm grateful for that he's grateful for that he's living to see another day as much more i could share things but i'm feeling the kind of stop right there just to give you a little glimpse into my past and what i've gone through to come up to this point just a portion of it um but for the young people you're blessed you are so blessed to be brought up in the homes that you are have the parents that you have to be at your age exposed to this truth even as i'm talking to you i know you know some of the younger minds or whatever they can't quite quite grasp but brother brother brother mcbride is saying amen but i'm trusting in god amen who's here right now and you are his children he's watching over you and the very words that are being spoken he'll bring him back to you and he'll actually move upon your heart to be able to understand it in the right time that's one of the works of the holy ghost when it comes in he said he takes the things you have heard and now he begins to make sense of it in your heart now you receive the inside teacher and he begins to expound on the things you've already heard bringing it back do you remember this is what it means this is what it means see it right here so everything is all right i believe our children will be all right by the grace of god it's god who is our father that's watching over the whole work it's his work amen so all we got to do is just trust in him and as he said enter into his rest we can really rest in confidence and faith knowing that we're in good hands amen god bless you saints i thank god for everything again wonderful atmosphere wonderful group man to hear those kids sing like they do i mean with all their little hearts that's that's a wonderful melody you can make a cd with that brother and i'll buy it i'll listen to it praise the lord god bless you saints amen praise the lord keep me in prayer keep my family in prayer please let's stand to our feet here praise god [Music] we're going to sing a song here and see if anyone needs prayer also [Applause] [Music] mercy [Music] me [Music] [Laughter] [Music] me [Music] first [Music] oh [Music] prayer tonight [Music] crack [Music] that's [Music]
