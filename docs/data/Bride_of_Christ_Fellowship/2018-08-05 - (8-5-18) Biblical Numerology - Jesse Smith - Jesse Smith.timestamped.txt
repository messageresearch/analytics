[28:45] [Music]
[28:51] [Applause]
[28:57] [Music]
[29:00] [Applause]
[29:08] Raisa let's send our feet here let's
[29:10] take our Bibles the grace of Lord will
[29:12] try to get right to the Word of God I
[29:22] like to go to Psalms 37 I'd like to just
[29:25] start a new series today by God's grace
[29:27] I told you I was going to start this
[29:29] series I'd like to look at Bible
[29:32] numerology for a few services by God's
[29:34] grace so look at the power of God
[29:36] revealed through numbers we'd like to
[29:38] look at that by the grace of the lord I
[29:40] think it'd be a blessing to you I just
[29:42] couldn't stop smiling the whole time I'm
[29:43] studying this like wow this is pretty
[29:45] amazing
[29:46] and I'd be honest I could not even
[29:49] scratch the surface because you can get
[29:51] into all the realms of nature you know
[29:53] plant life animal life you know you name
[29:55] it I'm just trying to stay with the
[29:57] Bible and I have I have one I mean what
[30:00] I mean is that you could go out into
[30:01] science you could find all these other
[30:03] numbers but I'll probably spend most of
[30:05] my time focusing on the God I'll
[30:07] probably get through numbers 1 through 3
[30:09] today because there's 3 is so huge
[30:11] threes like the most popular number in
[30:13] the scripture I think but so if we could
[30:18] there it's a Psalms by God's grace and
[30:22] Psalms 37 23 we'll just read that
[30:27] together if we can
[30:29] let's begin on three one two three the
[30:32] steps of a good man are ordered by the
[30:35] Lord and he delighteth in his way
[30:38] amen let's just have one more word of
[30:39] Prayer Heavenly Father Lord we've read
[30:41] your word the Bible says the steps of a
[30:44] good man are ordered by the Lord there's
[30:46] so much order in your universe in our
[30:48] bodies in nature and Lord there's order
[30:51] in our lives and we thank you for that
[30:54] Lord you've ordered all these events of
[30:55] our lives or I think of even the Grahams
[30:57] Lord how you've ordered them to move to
[30:59] Michigan Lord and you ordered me to come
[31:02] to Akron so many years ago in 1999 Lord
[31:05] and you just ordered us Lord to do
[31:07] different things and different times and
[31:10] seasons so we thank you for that Lord
[31:12] let us always walk in your ordered pass
[31:15] Lord the perfect will of God and father
[31:17] just help us to understand how you
[31:19] reveal yourself through these numbers
[31:22] Lord that you've created so father we
[31:24] love you today speak to us we pray in
[31:26] Jesus Christ's name and the church said
[31:28] Amen god bless yous being seated praise
[31:30] the Lord so let's look at this thought
[31:35] here and I'll try to keep it an hour if
[31:38] I keep an hour it'll be only 11
[31:40] I'm sorry only 12:30 when I'm done here
[31:42] so that would be a new record by God's
[31:45] grace so let me set my watch so I don't
[31:48] forget and also I'd have one more one
[31:58] more thing I have an update at the end
[32:00] of the service as well I do have an
[32:01] update on what I shared on Wednesday
[32:02] night with brother Adam Bowe who left
[32:05] the church I shared some things on
[32:07] Wednesday night about that I do have a
[32:08] follow up to share with that brother
[32:10] Adam and I talked last night on the
[32:12] phone so I'll be sharing a little bit
[32:13] about that afterwards by God's grace I
[32:15] want to want to make sure I let you know
[32:16] about that
[32:17] it's really good news by God's grace we
[32:18] had a really good fellowship or a
[32:20] conversation yesterday so thank the Lord
[32:22] for that so let's look at biblical
[32:24] numerology how many ever interested in
[32:26] numerology the numbers of the Bible oh
[32:28] it's such a wonderful thing I was doing
[32:32] some searches but my main reference is
[32:34] II W Bollinger a preacher who lived you
[32:37] know there in the late 1800s you know
[32:41] early 1900s
[32:42] they someone put his book online it's
[32:46] called numbers in Scripture so I'm
[32:47] pulling a lot out of there cuz you know
[32:50] why reinvent the wheel you know they've
[32:52] he's already done all those years and
[32:53] wrote a whole book on numbers you know
[32:55] so I don't really feel like I should
[32:56] start from scratch and just ignore all
[32:58] that work that he's done so I pulled a
[33:01] lot of thoughts from his book there and
[33:04] I'm only done with you know the first
[33:06] few chapters and like you said like I
[33:09] said number three will have a lot to
[33:11] preach on this morning with number three
[33:12] but let's look at numerology define you
[33:16] know and as I was looking at the the
[33:18] actual word numerology if you don't put
[33:21] a biblical in front of it it has
[33:22] connections to the occult because if you
[33:25] look at Webster's dictionary numerology
[33:27] is the study of the occult significance
[33:30] of numbers because you know the common
[33:32] person that would would say well I'm not
[33:34] a Satanist you know they wouldn't worry
[33:35] too much about numbers but the people
[33:37] who spend the most time of it outside of
[33:39] Christians would be those in the
[33:42] spiritual or the evil demonic world that
[33:44] work operate with demons you know of
[33:46] course we're fighting our prayers are
[33:48] fighting in that demon world as well
[33:50] amen our prayers are fighting against
[33:52] those demons amen
[33:53] because we wrestle not against flesh and
[33:55] blood but against spiritual wickedness
[33:56] in high places huh how's your wrestling
[33:59] going lately you scoot wrestling in
[34:00] prayer amen
[34:01] wrestle against those demons claiming
[34:03] the promises of God crying out to God
[34:05] for victory he'll answer let's just give
[34:07] him some time to answer praise the Lord
[34:08] so the the definition I found was from
[34:11] cross examine org it's a that's a he's a
[34:14] doctorate a man who does apologetics but
[34:17] he defined biblical numerology as the
[34:19] study of how God uses numbers to
[34:22] indicate truth brother Branham says it a
[34:24] little differently as we'll seen a
[34:26] little bit brother Branham calls
[34:27] numerology how God reveals himself so
[34:31] it's God's way to reveal himself through
[34:34] numbers so brother Branham calls it
[34:37] God's numerology so he says three is the
[34:40] number of perfection we all know that
[34:41] three is God's number in his numerology
[34:44] so God has a numerology can you say amen
[34:46] to that God is known by his numbers so
[34:52] we really can't know God fully unless we
[34:55] know the number
[34:56] that he uses threes perfection 7 is
[34:59] worship 24 is worship
[35:01] 40 is temptation 50 is pentecost jubilee
[35:05] and so forth all of his numbers his
[35:06] numerals of God is perfected isn't
[35:09] perfection now 3 is the number of
[35:12] perfection so if you want to know more
[35:15] about God you've got to understand the
[35:18] numerology of the Bible the biblical
[35:19] numerology and we'll show some examples
[35:24] as we go down here now church numbers
[35:27] how does God deal this how does God
[35:30] reveal himself through numbers well
[35:31] numbers reveal God's loving heart
[35:35] because program said Heavenly Father my
[35:38] mind goes now to your many instances of
[35:40] how you have dealt with your people
[35:42] through many different signs of wonder
[35:44] sure you know where the sparrows was you
[35:48] said not one could fall even though two
[35:49] of them only cost 1/2 1/4 of a penny but
[35:52] how insignificant that was but yet you
[35:54] know the sparrow I love this you said
[35:57] even the hairs of the heads of the
[36:00] Apostles were numbered amen
[36:04] you know at every animal you're just all
[36:07] life Lord and nothing can be done except
[36:12] you know it you're omniscient
[36:13] omnipresent omnipotent you're infinite
[36:17] so numbers reveal God's love his caring
[36:22] love for us because the Bible says now
[36:25] remember Jesus is sending out the twelve
[36:26] disciples two by two he said I'm sending
[36:29] you out as lambs among wolves I've never
[36:32] dealt with wolves they try to steal your
[36:35] joy they try to steal your victory they
[36:37] try to make you lose your testimony
[36:38] remember Paul prayed for three years
[36:40] there's another three I forgot to put on
[36:42] there Paul prayed for three years a
[36:45] warning that the Church of Ephesus
[36:47] wolves are coming to come and wolves are
[36:49] gonna come in he warned them for three
[36:51] years because God wanted to give them a
[36:53] complete warning a perfect divine
[36:55] warning amen
[36:57] so God let them be warned for three
[36:59] years but Jesus before he sent them out
[37:02] he said fear not them which kill the
[37:04] body but are not able to kill the soul
[37:06] but rather fear him which is able to
[37:09] destroy
[37:10] both soul and body in hell are not two
[37:13] sparrows sold for a farthing and one of
[37:15] them shall not fall on the ground
[37:17] without your father can you imagine that
[37:19] when a bird falls down or when an animal
[37:21] dies they didn't die without the father
[37:24] knowing about it
[37:25] Omaha is God interested in his creation
[37:28] Church absolutely that's why you can
[37:31] speak to creation and if God gave you
[37:33] that thought creation must obey you amen
[37:36] that's exactly right
[37:37] he said the very hairs of your head are
[37:40] all numbered so what does he show you
[37:45] showing I love you so much
[37:47] that that I care and I'm numbered even
[37:50] the hairs on your head which science
[37:52] says there's between 90,000 and 150,000
[37:56] I'll tell you my sweeper at home sleeps
[37:57] up about 3,000 every week I think then
[38:00] I'll get the scissors out you know and
[38:02] try to cut it off there but but God
[38:07] knows where each way and we just throw
[38:09] them in the trash but brother BAM says
[38:10] we'll get them back some of if the
[38:13] brothers lost their hair they might wish
[38:14] they had more you know but but you'll
[38:18] get them back by God's grace for you
[38:21] fear not either for now you are more
[38:24] valuable than the sparrows how many say
[38:26] I love you Jesus amen
[38:28] if animals fall and God knows about it
[38:32] how much more when you fall you struggle
[38:35] or you go through a hard time how much
[38:36] more does God care and God know about it
[38:40] you think oh well I would never send my
[38:43] children as a sheep among wolves but God
[38:45] does because God knows he will
[38:48] orchestrate things that and he'll make
[38:50] sure that there's no temptation except
[38:52] God makes a way of escape amen now we're
[38:56] not foolish and throw our children out
[38:57] like you know
[38:58] sheep among wolves we're not foolish
[39:01] like that but the point I'm making is
[39:03] that we have to have trust in the
[39:04] Almighty God we have to have confidence
[39:07] in Almighty God we must seek first the
[39:09] kingdom of God and His righteousness and
[39:12] all these things will be added unto us
[39:14] amen
[39:15] program said not long ago has Coleman
[39:17] back these two or three hairs I got left
[39:19] my wife sitting back there said Billy
[39:21] you're just about bald-headed I said but
[39:23] I haven't
[39:24] one of them she said well were they all
[39:26] at tell me I said where was they before
[39:29] I got them they're there they're waiting
[39:33] for me someday I'll go to them they was
[39:37] every hair of your heads numbered and
[39:39] not one of them can be lost don't you
[39:42] love how God sent a prophet to us I've
[39:45] never heard that in anything I was
[39:47] raised in denomination I never heard
[39:48] anybody preach that but it's so true
[39:51] wherever our hairs came from and if we
[39:54] lose them they must be there waiting for
[39:56] us amen to come back to them but rather
[40:00] said these hands it used to be a little
[40:01] boy
[40:02] these soldiers shoulders that's stooping
[40:04] under preaching the gospel someday will
[40:07] spring back again to the picture man may
[40:09] I'm sorry made in His image stand in his
[40:12] likeness wash in his blood redeemed by
[40:15] His grace I shall stand and no fear to
[40:18] death amen just the very fact that Jesus
[40:22] said every hairs numbered just that very
[40:25] fact should give us such grace and no
[40:28] fear in life amen because if God knows
[40:30] every hair he knows where you're going
[40:32] after you leave this earth a man because
[40:36] he loves you so much and he cares so
[40:38] much if he cares for the bird if he
[40:40] cares for the animal how much more does
[40:42] he care for you and I who are in His
[40:44] image praise God but have said the hairs
[40:47] the Bible says the hairs your head is
[40:49] numbered not one of them shall perish
[40:50] there was one time there wasn't nothing
[40:52] and then they was and they went back to
[40:54] where they was before I had them so will
[40:57] this body be someday the calcium potash
[41:00] will go back but God will speak and I'll
[41:03] jump from the earth that's my god oh
[41:06] that's one jump I look forward to
[41:08] jumping amen
[41:09] a holiday I jumped allows a long jumper
[41:12] in high school I love to jump I would
[41:13] jump and dunk the basketball I love to
[41:16] jump but that jump is no comparison to
[41:18] this resurrection jump amen
[41:21] and God's going to get all of us a
[41:22] resurrection jump hallelujah these
[41:25] bodies will jump right out of the earth
[41:26] amen jump right out the dust when he
[41:29] called your body will answer amen glory
[41:32] he holds the whole world in his hands he
[41:35] just
[41:36] blows the stars off made the solar
[41:39] system spoke his word and it was so the
[41:41] very dirt that you're setting over is
[41:43] his word made manifest never think about
[41:46] that very dirt you wash off your feet
[41:48] God created that dirt he said it didn't
[41:53] where to come from the dirt that you're
[41:54] walking on is his word made manifest he
[41:58] said let there be and there was I
[42:00] believe every word that he said is the
[42:01] truth no matter how long it lingers it's
[42:04] so anyhow
[42:06] hallelujah what these hairs was before
[42:11] they come on me what were they before
[42:12] they come on me they are waiting for me
[42:14] and every hair is numbered and not one
[42:17] bit of us will be lost but I'll raise it
[42:22] up at the last day saith God I believe
[42:24] that this just as true as I believe I'm
[42:27] standing here you know when I was in
[42:29] college I had a shoulder injury and I
[42:32] injured it twice my AC joint they had to
[42:34] cut off part of my bone and there to sew
[42:36] it back together and now I don't have
[42:38] this big bump like I used to have but
[42:40] some of my bone was left at that
[42:44] hospital I don't know if they burn it I
[42:45] don't know what they did with it but
[42:47] according to this and according to Jesus
[42:49] Jesus said I'll raise you up and that's
[42:52] every part of you if you've lost any
[42:54] part think of the amputee think of the
[42:56] person who's had lost body parts and so
[42:59] forth the jesus said I'll raise you up
[43:01] and brother man said he's not going to
[43:03] drain just partial up he's gonna raise
[43:05] all of you up amen
[43:06] so that bone I lost is coming back by
[43:09] God's grace amen I believe that for
[43:12] Jesus and all that the father has given
[43:14] me shall come to me and him that cometh
[43:16] to me I will in no wise cast out so I
[43:19] came down from heaven not to do my own
[43:20] will but the will of him that sent me
[43:22] and this is the Father's will which has
[43:25] sent me that of all which you have given
[43:28] me I should lose nothing but should
[43:30] raise it up again at the last day and
[43:32] this is the will of him that sent me
[43:34] that everyone would see at the Son and
[43:36] believeth on him may have everlasting
[43:37] life and I will raise him up at the last
[43:41] day he repeats it again so you have
[43:43] another witness another testimony that
[43:45] God is going to raise you up glory and
[43:49] he's not done he's
[43:50] the third time no man can come to me
[43:52] except my father which has sent me draw
[43:54] him and I will raise him up at the last
[43:57] day it is written the prophets and they
[43:59] shall all be taught of God every man
[44:01] therefore that hath heard and hath
[44:03] learned of the Father cometh to me but
[44:07] as it were only made of 16 elements
[44:10] that's petroleum potash cosmic light so
[44:13] forth so that God gets its in the earth
[44:15] and he will just call it again and I'll
[44:19] answer that's right I believe that I
[44:21] believe that with all that's in my heart
[44:23] and soul of mine I solemnly believe it
[44:25] over this Bible if I die over in the
[44:28] next few minutes I believe that that he
[44:30] called you believe that this morning
[44:32] if you die and whatever happens he will
[44:35] call for your body and it will come
[44:38] forth amen he said every head of your
[44:41] heads numbered nothing will be lost
[44:43] every hairs numbered nothing will be
[44:45] lost I'll raise that but the last day he
[44:48] either give it to me now can't he give
[44:50] it back to me by a promise if he gave
[44:53] you something and you lost something can
[44:56] he give back what was lost
[44:57] he said if he can't make me what I am
[45:00] without a choice I'm sorry if he can't
[45:02] make me where I am without a choice how
[45:04] much more can he make me back by a
[45:07] choice by taking him Roy I feel
[45:11] religious now to know that we're coming
[45:12] a resurrection and will be restored and
[45:15] alike again like he showed Abraham their
[45:17] notice jesus said that that was God
[45:20] manifested in a human flesh amen
[45:23] Church we know that our footsteps are
[45:26] years even our words and even our names
[45:30] are all numbered they're all numbered
[45:34] God has a specific number for them
[45:37] Almighty and gracious God who's a prayer
[45:40] answering God
[45:40] a father that knows all as children has
[45:42] need of you notice before we were born
[45:45] and you have our footsteps numbered the
[45:50] very hairs of your head are numbered and
[45:52] our words are all weighed in that
[45:54] balance so Lord God let us this morning
[45:57] to do things this solemn obligation that
[46:00] we have before thee you know I really
[46:02] like this watch when I first got it
[46:04] about two
[46:04] years ago and one reason I liked it was
[46:06] because it counted my steps I like to
[46:09] look down and say oh by 7000 steps today
[46:11] thousand steps but you know this is just
[46:14] an imitation of what God is doing
[46:16] already in heaven I know yeah let's see
[46:20] they're just picking up of what God has
[46:22] already done because the footsteps of
[46:24] the righteous are ordered and counted
[46:26] and determined by the Lord amen
[46:30] every single one of them our words are
[46:38] waiting the bound so look what the Bible
[46:39] says there shall nothing cast their
[46:41] young nor be barren in thy land the
[46:44] number of thy days will I fulfill so God
[46:46] promises Israel you will have every day
[46:49] to the full promise I gave you in the
[46:52] promised land there wouldn't be one day
[46:54] less there wouldn't be one day more and
[46:57] the bottom said so teach us the number
[47:00] our days that we may apply our hearts on
[47:02] their wisdom how many we say Lord teach
[47:04] me to number my days help me not to
[47:06] forget that I'm mortal that I just have
[47:08] a short time on earth that my life is
[47:11] like a vapor and I want everything in my
[47:14] life to manifest and declare that Jesus
[47:16] Christ is the same yesterday today and
[47:18] forever I just have a short breath of
[47:21] life and let everybody who know my life
[47:23] everybody that saw that that vapor of
[47:25] life may they say that life was to
[47:28] glorify Jesus amen
[47:31] teach us the number our days and realize
[47:33] we don't have as much time maybe as we
[47:35] thought we have we all have an
[47:38] appointment with the Heavenly Father the
[47:43] Bible says it
[47:43] have a little physical strength you
[47:45] might get 10 more years now we know
[47:48] again this is a probability this is not
[47:49] a promise it's a probability because
[47:51] Jesus only got 33 years and if anybody
[47:54] deserved a full life on earth
[47:55] it was Christ so the days of our years
[47:58] are threescore years and ten seventy and
[48:00] if by reason of strength they be
[48:02] fourscore years yet is their strength
[48:04] labor and sorrow for it is soon cut off
[48:08] and we fly away now we know Church that
[48:13] you know if we exercise or eat well or
[48:15] take care of ourselves and get enough
[48:16] rest we know you may add a few more
[48:18] years to our life but we must not strive
[48:23] to have to have more for ourselves
[48:26] selfishly we've got to say god I'm going
[48:29] to take care of this temple because
[48:31] taking care of this temple glorifies you
[48:33] but we shouldn't say well I gotta live
[48:36] til I'm 90 or I got a live-time 100 I
[48:38] gotta live to know it's not us who
[48:40] determines the days it's God who
[48:43] determines the number of our years and
[48:45] you I hope you learned a lesson from
[48:47] Hezekiah Hezekiah throughs of hands of
[48:49] the wallet said give me 15 more years
[48:51] God gave it to him and he wasted those
[48:53] 15 years and we preach on that recently
[48:56] on a Sunday night if you remember that
[48:57] we preach on life struggles life's
[48:59] battles he wasted he squandered 15 more
[49:02] years and the Bible said it would have
[49:04] been better if he had just died earlier
[49:07] 15 years earlier and gone when God
[49:09] wanted him to go how many one to go and
[49:11] God wants them to go and I hope I hope
[49:13] for all of us that when God wants us to
[49:15] go it's all the same day our second and
[49:18] minute at the first resurrection amen
[49:20] that's all we're living for that's what
[49:22] we're preaching for to be the bride of
[49:24] Jesus Christ to fulfill the rapture
[49:26] scriptures to meet Jesus Christ in the
[49:29] air and to hear the last chomp amen
[49:31] glory that's what we're living for
[49:34] that's what we're dying for that's what
[49:36] we're doing everything in our power to
[49:37] do is to meet Christ in the air at the
[49:40] return of the Lord amen
[49:43] so you say well I'm gonna live till I'm
[49:44] 100 well good but you got to make sure
[49:46] that's how long God wants you to live
[49:48] right we don't want to be rebellious we
[49:51] don't want to rebel against the Lord we
[49:53] don't want to be selfish like Hezekiah
[49:56] was in the last little bit of
[49:57] is life we all want to be selfish we
[49:59] want to just say Lord and your time make
[50:01] everything beautiful Lord just take me
[50:03] when it's your time to take me amen
[50:06] that's exactly right see even your days
[50:10] are numbered your kingdom Babylon was
[50:13] numbered it says and this is the writing
[50:15] that was written main a main a tech go
[50:18] up hare Shen I'm definitely saying that
[50:21] right this is the interpretation of the
[50:23] thing men a God hath numbered thy
[50:26] kingdom and I've finished it see every
[50:29] kingdom has a number of days a number of
[50:32] years that it's going to to exist we
[50:35] know you know David ruled for 40 years I
[50:37] remember that Solomon ruled 40 years
[50:40] I've been pastoring 12 years and I I
[50:42] just my mind after wonder Lord how many
[50:44] years am I gonna be here pastoring you
[50:47] know I want to do all the years that God
[50:49] has given me praise God God has
[50:51] determined the numbers of our lives and
[50:55] our ministries all that he's called us
[50:57] to do and see even a name has a number
[51:01] let him that hath understanding count
[51:04] the number of the beast for it's a
[51:05] number of a man in his number of six
[51:07] hundred threescore and six
[51:09] Vic areas Philly Day right in God's
[51:14] stead and so even names have numbers now
[51:20] that's not the direction I'm taking this
[51:22] service but I'm sure there is a whole
[51:23] study on that you can find numbers if
[51:25] you take the Roman numerals the
[51:26] different names you can find numbers but
[51:28] what this made me think of as my
[51:30] personal testimony of God calling me to
[51:33] preach and receive the message and I'll
[51:36] just share this real quick
[51:37] in 2002 shortly after I came in the
[51:39] message a brother named Bill Tyler who
[51:41] was attending brother broaches church
[51:43] sent me a letter of encouragement
[51:45] showing the similarities in my life to
[51:48] the number 11 my football number was 11
[51:51] my weight on the website Akron's website
[51:55] was 191 which adds up to 11 my current
[51:58] weight I just had my physical last week
[52:00] is 11 - I've lost a little bit of weight
[52:04] since college there are September 11th
[52:07] attacks made Simon go to the message
[52:10] Bible study so we could
[52:11] the endtime message I receive the
[52:15] message in the 11th month of the year
[52:17] and I was born in the 11th month of the
[52:20] year do numbers have a meaning Church so
[52:25] here's his letter I'm not going to read
[52:26] all of it but he said wow I was on the
[52:28] website he said I just want to encourage
[52:29] you you know I didn't know you were
[52:31] number 11 so that's what he saw on the
[52:32] website that ugly guy there and so I was
[52:35] 191 back in 2002 and there's my picture
[52:38] I've always been drawn to number 11 I
[52:41] always wondered why do I like 11 so much
[52:44] well the Bible says that Jesus went out
[52:47] into the vineyard and he found workers
[52:50] at the third the first our third our
[52:52] right six our ninth our but he goes one
[52:56] more time he goes one more time he
[52:58] didn't have to because it kind of breaks
[53:00] the types of the three right three hours
[53:02] 6 hours 9 hours 12 hours he kind of
[53:05] broke the type a little bit and he went
[53:07] out at what hour the 11th and so you
[53:11] know the scripture in Bible times the
[53:13] 11th hour was 5:00 p.m. evening time
[53:17] glory 6 a.m. was the first hour because
[53:21] there was broken up into two twelve the
[53:23] 24-hour day was broken up into two
[53:25] twelve six a.m. was the first hour 9:00
[53:27] a.m. so this worker goes out at 6 a.m.
[53:29] goes at 9 a.m. noon 3:00 p.m. and for
[53:32] some reason he goes I think I better go
[53:34] out at the eleventh hour he kind of
[53:36] breaks the type it's kind of out of
[53:38] order does anybody understand that
[53:39] understand that 11:00 is kind of out of
[53:42] the ordinary pattern of God and that's
[53:45] because brother Branham said this was a
[53:48] type of the end time he said now hold it
[53:51] he said what the 11th hour people could
[53:53] come in so Jesus said hold it so the
[53:56] 11th hour people could come in the last
[53:58] calling of the Gentiles huh me no
[54:02] brother Ram said the 11th hour workers
[54:04] are the Gentile bride and we know that
[54:06] mother worked there dad worked there
[54:08] grandmother worked back there this is
[54:10] our age the 11th hour that world war
[54:13] stopped the 11th month in the year the
[54:15] 11th day of the month the 11th hour in
[54:18] the day the 11th minute in the hour that
[54:20] he said that the 8th I'm sorry that the
[54:23] 11th hour people might come in
[54:25] receive the same baptism in the Holy
[54:28] Ghost they did back there at the
[54:29] beginning to bring back the power and
[54:32] the resurrection of the Lord Jesus
[54:33] Christ with the same sign in wonders hey
[54:36] man remember this is from the BBC
[54:39] website but you can find it on
[54:40] history.com you can find it on every
[54:43] history reference this is people
[54:45] celebrating in London at the end of the
[54:48] war so World War one ended at 11:00 a.m.
[54:51] on the eleventh day of the eleventh
[54:54] month in 1918 not 1911 I thought it was
[54:57] 1911 but that's one extra 11:00 that we
[55:00] did we didn't have I made a fool myself
[55:03] one time it was in 1911
[55:05] someone told me no it's not night I so
[55:07] forgive me Lord Germany signed the
[55:09] armistice that had been prepared by
[55:12] Britain and France so this is the first
[55:15] world war ended on 11:00 a.m. on
[55:18] November 11th 11th month 11th 11th day
[55:22] 11th hour and they still don't know you
[55:24] can look it up they still don't know why
[55:26] ended at that time they don't know
[55:27] somebody chose it well I know chose it
[55:30] God chose it God put it upon them those
[55:33] hearts of the Germans to sign that the
[55:35] deal there of the peace treaty God did
[55:38] that because God was showing I'm going
[55:40] to make one more call before this old
[55:42] history is finished I'm going to give
[55:44] the 11th hour workers a chance to work
[55:47] in my vineyard amen
[55:50] program says this you noticed
[55:52] November 11th 11th o clock in the day of
[55:54] the eleventh month in the year the
[55:55] eleventh day in the month and eleventh
[55:57] hour in the day you remember then what
[55:59] Jesus said about that so Matthew 20 the
[56:03] parable of the $11 worker is all about
[56:05] this day Jesus was talking about this
[56:09] day the final call and I always wondered
[56:12] why I like number 11 brother bang I'm
[56:14] not sure why I liked it so much but now
[56:16] I know it's a part of me it's a part of
[56:20] my calling it's God revealing himself to
[56:23] me praise God
[56:24] that's what numbers do in your life they
[56:26] reveal to you God's call for your life
[56:29] amen
[56:32] 1 1 2
[56:34] at one time one got a penny the next one
[56:37] went that was $11 people what was that
[56:39] right there they were the 11th hour
[56:41] people it's been held back now it's
[56:43] getting time for them to come in and
[56:44] they're gathering out those Jews for a
[56:46] nation now the 7th angels message is to
[56:50] open the mystery of the seals calling
[56:53] calling write of Christ fellowship in
[56:57] Akron amen is that right the Gentile
[57:01] workers see God once workers today how
[57:04] many want to work for God God doesn't
[57:07] want sinners God wants workers amen
[57:09] we're supposed to be working in the
[57:12] vineyard of the Lord amen
[57:14] gentle workers to receive the same pay
[57:17] that the first our workers got Jesus
[57:21] taught it he said there was some
[57:22] people's went to the harvest they were
[57:24] hired when they did have a early morning
[57:26] they received a penny for a day than at
[57:28] noontime someone else come in and went
[57:29] to work and then the eleventh hour that
[57:31] was the last hour of the day that
[57:34] someone come in and received the same
[57:35] kind of pay they did the first hour of
[57:37] the day the last hour it's so perfectly
[57:42] how the first our messengers with the
[57:44] word with the gospel with the truth they
[57:46] came in at the day of Pentecost then
[57:48] there was a middle age of black them out
[57:50] then to middle the day Luther Wesley
[57:51] them came in and then there's to be an
[57:53] evening time message and to receive the
[57:55] same thing they did at the beginning he
[57:57] said the evening time message is to
[57:59] restore back again to bring back that
[58:02] same thing again and the church said Oh
[58:04] in that beautiful church man
[58:07] now I'm not preaching on this this
[58:09] morning but just to give you a heads up
[58:11] 11 is the number of disorder kiss
[58:16] judgment and finality or last because of
[58:19] the 11th hour workers were the final
[58:22] call it was the last call there was no
[58:26] other call after that are you glad Jesus
[58:29] college at the end time aren't you glad
[58:31] Jesus came out for one more one more
[58:33] invitation who else wants to work who
[58:36] else wants to receive the message of the
[58:37] hour I'm glad he came out one more time
[58:39] because I was one of those eleven dollar
[58:41] workers amen and I didn't know William
[58:45] Rand was a prophet till I was you know
[58:47] 21 years old I didn't
[58:48] oh that but God knew there's something
[58:50] about him he was he's gonna labor for me
[58:52] he's gonna labor for one more hour
[58:54] out there in the heat of the day right
[58:56] before the evening time oh I love it I
[59:00] love how God shows us and reveals to us
[59:02] himself oh thank you Jesus
[59:06] so we're not preaching on that one this
[59:08] morning but you'll see there's so many
[59:10] judgements associated with number 11 in
[59:12] the Bible and we didn't brother man say
[59:14] judge what's gonna hit the west coast
[59:16] what day in the day of the eleventh hour
[59:18] workers fritzsche perfectly now before
[59:22] we get to these numbers 1 2 3 Satan has
[59:25] numerology as well I mentioned that
[59:26] earlier people that are in the occult
[59:28] you know they'll sacrifice so many
[59:30] animals or do so many things like that
[59:32] they have a they have a numerology but
[59:35] it's a pattern after hell I'm sorry it's
[59:39] pattern I'm sorry it's calling on the
[59:40] powers of hell but it's imitating God's
[59:43] numbers the example I won't get to today
[59:46] but is Balaam in the days of Moses God
[59:50] told Moses you're gonna have three major
[59:52] feasts and at the feast at the feast of
[59:56] an atonement you're gonna sacrifice
[59:57] seven bullocks at the Day of Atonement
[1:00:00] okay and so motor and Balaam must have
[1:00:04] heard that send Balaam before he goes to
[1:00:06] talk to God he sacrifices seven bullocks
[1:00:09] because he was copying Moses he saw
[1:00:12] Moses through something Maia
[1:00:14] I think that's a righteous man I'm gonna
[1:00:15] copy that and it worked right Balaam got
[1:00:19] in the presence of God he got thus saith
[1:00:21] the Lord
[1:00:22] but after that he had a false teaching
[1:00:24] interjected into his met in his ministry
[1:00:26] and with every false prophet they might
[1:00:29] be right prophesy but you've gotta watch
[1:00:31] their entire life you've got to watch
[1:00:34] what they teach you gotta watch what
[1:00:36] goes on after the prophecy you got to
[1:00:38] make sure the wind that smacked in the
[1:00:39] face of the wind that anointed you on
[1:00:41] the day of Pentecost that came like a
[1:00:43] rushing mighty wind you got to make sure
[1:00:44] you know where that wind came from amen
[1:00:47] so by their fruits they're know not by
[1:00:49] their first few times in the message or
[1:00:52] first few days or years of the message
[1:00:54] by their fruits they're known give them
[1:00:57] some time they'll manifest which side
[1:00:59] they're on
[1:00:59] I want to manifest that Jesus Christ
[1:01:02] living inside of me amen brother and say
[1:01:05] your name is ben hereafter you'll be
[1:01:07] called Peter now this is getting into
[1:01:08] the number of names which I said I'm not
[1:01:10] dealing with that one today he said you
[1:01:12] were saw but you're called Paul from now
[1:01:14] on how about all these names if you
[1:01:16] don't if that don't if they don't mean
[1:01:18] something or you say that's numerology
[1:01:20] the devil's got one and God's got one
[1:01:25] everything that Devils got he's
[1:01:27] patterned after God amen it's all after
[1:01:32] God like I was telling you at the movies
[1:01:34] what all these movies were they trying
[1:01:36] to uh promote they're trying to promote
[1:01:38] superheroes they're trying to promote
[1:01:41] riches they're trying to promote you
[1:01:43] ruling over something and that's all
[1:01:45] what they Satan just copying them off
[1:01:47] God because the whole the whole pinnacle
[1:01:50] of Christianity is Jesus bringing his
[1:01:53] bride back to the Garden of Eden
[1:01:55] so bride and groom can rule over all
[1:01:57] creation amen
[1:01:59] in a super power in the super power of
[1:02:02] the Holy Ghost amen
[1:02:04] it's just a it's just a perversion Satan
[1:02:07] just pattern it and copied it off of God
[1:02:09] that's why all these that's why they'll
[1:02:11] promote all these superheroes today
[1:02:12] because there's only one superhero Jesus
[1:02:15] Christ find out that your name has a
[1:02:19] bearing on your life my name means a
[1:02:22] gift in one Hebrew translation oh
[1:02:25] there's different Trenton different
[1:02:26] meanings for all of our names did your
[1:02:28] name mean light brother vain garden amen
[1:02:31] praise the Lord that's a good name
[1:02:33] hallelujah
[1:02:34] every heart is like a ground a garden
[1:02:37] right Theresa it make sure it's an
[1:02:38] honest good heart glory now find out
[1:02:42] that your name he says now I can't go
[1:02:44] too much of that because the devil has a
[1:02:45] false numerology
[1:02:47] we know that people starts feeling and
[1:02:49] so far like that which runs into
[1:02:51] spiritualism and spiritual is of the
[1:02:53] devil so see church we make sure we
[1:02:55] don't go overboard with this because
[1:02:57] you'll make yourself crazy look at all
[1:02:59] the numbers on your receipts looking at
[1:03:01] all your numbers on your whatever your
[1:03:03] emails or social security number you'll
[1:03:07] go crazy one time I got a receipt and I
[1:03:10] paid six dollars and 66 cents you know
[1:03:11] for something I just I just said Oh
[1:03:14] devil shut up you know I just threw
[1:03:16] I know where I stand I know who the
[1:03:18] devil is I know I know I know that what
[1:03:21] that Pope stands for and I know what I
[1:03:22] stand for amen
[1:03:24] see but you could go reverse it on Judas
[1:03:27] I've got a 666 I'm Judas well six
[1:03:29] dollars and sixty six cents is not 666
[1:03:32] dollars if you want to be technical
[1:03:36] right so see you can go too far on it
[1:03:39] you go too far and if you see us 666
[1:03:41] they praise the Lord I know what it is
[1:03:43] and I've been I've been raised up to
[1:03:45] stand against it amen
[1:03:47] I know who the enemy is I know who I'm
[1:03:49] fighting but my Jesus is 777 it's like
[1:03:53] our prophet William Eric Pratt 777 so we
[1:03:58] know God did that by God's grace but we
[1:03:59] don't make that a major because then
[1:04:01] people like if someone has six letters
[1:04:03] in their name then they'll be I'm just
[1:04:04] discouraged well six is a good number
[1:04:05] when God made Adam when God made Adam on
[1:04:08] the sixth day it was all purity he was a
[1:04:10] perfect man there's nothing wrong with
[1:04:12] six as long as you're not going off on
[1:04:14] the devil's side of six because God has
[1:04:17] a numerology and the devil has a
[1:04:18] numerology remember I showed you there
[1:04:20] are six weapons on the full armor of God
[1:04:22] why would God do six because he's a
[1:04:24] perfect man he's got all six weapons but
[1:04:26] they met he's a perfect man he's got all
[1:04:28] his weapons he's got lost gear he can
[1:04:31] defeat any foe because he's all got all
[1:04:33] of God's six weapons and defenses to
[1:04:35] knock off the devil amen but don't you
[1:04:38] know don't take it too far
[1:04:39] you know don't take it too far now watch
[1:04:44] that cane spear come right down through
[1:04:46] the scripture right on this very last
[1:04:47] day oh good I got my time left okay
[1:04:51] fundamental just as fundamentals the
[1:04:53] other one was look at the Prophet Balaam
[1:04:55] and the prophet Moses okay this is what
[1:04:57] I mentioned earlier both of them were
[1:04:59] seven altars Jehovah's altars blood on
[1:05:01] each one not only that but Rams on each
[1:05:03] one yeah I'm sorry did I say bullocks I
[1:05:04] met Rams in numerology exactly the right
[1:05:07] number seven perfect seven Rams just the
[1:05:10] lacs exactly like both altars so Satan
[1:05:15] is always going to impersonate God's
[1:05:17] true numerology as fundamental as one
[1:05:20] was the other one was also but who did
[1:05:22] God vindicate I love that see see the
[1:05:26] wound that was in his word
[1:05:28] oh thank you that's why your everyday
[1:05:31] life coming to church three times a week
[1:05:33] or how many times the answers that's why
[1:05:36] your everyday life is just as important
[1:05:38] as any supernatural experiences you have
[1:05:41] because your life proves what seat you
[1:05:43] came from amen
[1:05:46] as I've always said the most mature
[1:05:48] people I know imma share this with
[1:05:49] brother Aaron because he's new to our
[1:05:50] church the most mature people I know are
[1:05:52] those who love God the most out of their
[1:05:54] local home church because your support
[1:05:58] of your home church is the reflection of
[1:06:00] how you live your life at home if you're
[1:06:03] not faithful to the home church if
[1:06:04] you're not interested the home church
[1:06:05] that really you're slacking at home
[1:06:08] because this is our hope this is our
[1:06:10] family this is our home where we gather
[1:06:12] this is where we worship the Lord so
[1:06:15] your dedication in this church your your
[1:06:18] your attitude toward this church is a
[1:06:20] total reflection of your walk with God
[1:06:22] in your house that's exactly right
[1:06:25] that's exactly true brother band said
[1:06:28] don't you miss any service he said that
[1:06:29] the Spirit of God is in you he said they
[1:06:31] can't chain you away from coming church
[1:06:33] he said you can't wait till someone
[1:06:35] unlocks that door out there and he said
[1:06:38] if you don't feel that way it's time you
[1:06:40] got to praying amen glory see those with
[1:06:47] the revelation of the number obey the
[1:06:49] word of God
[1:06:50] Cain and Balaam disobeyed the word
[1:06:52] although Balaam had the right number a
[1:06:54] couple times and prophesied right he
[1:06:56] disobeyed the word he thought
[1:06:58] fornication was okay he he wanted to see
[1:07:00] God's people stumble no true child of
[1:07:03] God will attack another true child of
[1:07:05] God they might fall short they might
[1:07:07] make a mistake if they're a child of God
[1:07:08] they'll come back and apologize right
[1:07:10] because they're a real child of God but
[1:07:13] we know the Spirit of God does not
[1:07:15] attack the Spirit of God praise the Lord
[1:07:17] it was Ishmael who mocked and made fun
[1:07:20] of Isaac so we should be the ones being
[1:07:24] made fun of is that is that fun to be
[1:07:27] made fun of church no but if anybody's
[1:07:30] going to be made fun of it should be us
[1:07:32] so we got to be prepared for we got to
[1:07:35] be ready for we got to be prepared to be
[1:07:37] talked down upon
[1:07:39] we got to be prepared to be criticized
[1:07:41] because the Ishmael will always mock and
[1:07:43] make fun of the Isaac and I know about
[1:07:45] you but I'm a child of promise amen
[1:07:48] we must be children of the promise we
[1:07:50] believe God's promise God called us to
[1:07:53] this message God wants us to obey this
[1:07:55] message and so we must be willing to
[1:07:57] endure all the markings and the
[1:07:59] persecution we must in do it for the
[1:08:01] kingdom of God who to God vindicate the
[1:08:07] one that's with the word fundamental
[1:08:09] doesn't mean too much
[1:08:10] it's the revelation of God alright let's
[1:08:15] look at some numbers like I said we'll
[1:08:16] try to get to numbers 1 2 3 because
[1:08:18] that's really all I had time to study I
[1:08:20] mean over the years I think a year ago I
[1:08:21] started making a document that has all
[1:08:23] these numbers and every time I come
[1:08:25] across the number now I try to if I
[1:08:26] remember I try to go record it on this
[1:08:28] list so I have all kinds of numbers but
[1:08:31] as far as enough for preaching I just
[1:08:33] got one two and three really for today
[1:08:34] really so let's just try to finish that
[1:08:36] I got 23 minutes you know the Lord this
[1:08:39] morning
[1:08:40] Amen like I said I can see how God has
[1:08:43] revealed is called to me through numbers
[1:08:45] the number 11 it's it's made God's call
[1:08:49] real in my life and so that's what
[1:08:52] that's the focus of this message
[1:08:54] so you can understand numbers and then
[1:08:56] those numbers will help reveal God's
[1:08:58] will to you how many 1 know God's will I
[1:09:00] want to know God's heart more how many
[1:09:03] want to worship the Lord well the way to
[1:09:04] know God more is through numbers when
[1:09:07] God vindicates things so the meaning of
[1:09:10] number one number one has two meanings
[1:09:12] it can mean primacy which is the same as
[1:09:14] preeminence it can also mean unity of
[1:09:17] individuals okay so preeminence mean
[1:09:20] that there's only one and there's no
[1:09:22] other that's what primacy or preeminence
[1:09:25] means there's one and there's no other
[1:09:27] than unity of course is all just one a
[1:09:30] group all agreeing on one thought so
[1:09:34] primacy defined by Webster's is the
[1:09:37] state of being first being preeminent
[1:09:39] it's the first of importance the first
[1:09:42] of order the first of rank preeminent
[1:09:47] now let's look at some examples here all
[1:09:50] of these now I didn't have time to get
[1:09:52] all the scriptures but I could ease
[1:09:53] find them you just need a concordance
[1:09:54] and only had so much time so I some of
[1:09:57] them I didn't put all the scriptures on
[1:09:58] but there's one god there's one load
[1:10:01] there's one spirit one father which
[1:10:03] means there's only one there's no other
[1:10:05] father there's one faith there's one way
[1:10:08] there's one truth which means there's no
[1:10:10] other way to believe the Bible than the
[1:10:12] way we believe it every other way is a
[1:10:16] perversion it's an imitation because
[1:10:19] there's only one faith faith is the same
[1:10:21] thing Paul preached amen
[1:10:22] it's not like we're special it's just
[1:10:24] been restored back to us and there's no
[1:10:26] other way to be in the perfect one of
[1:10:28] God then they obey the one faith that
[1:10:30] God has revealed to this whole world's
[1:10:32] in this last time there's only one
[1:10:34] baptism that's the name of the Lord
[1:10:36] Jesus Christ there is no other people we
[1:10:40] know we know brother answer there's
[1:10:41] going to be surprised on the day of
[1:10:42] judgment how many understand that in
[1:10:44] Matthew 25 they're like when do we see
[1:10:45] Lord when do we do these things and he
[1:10:47] said when you did the least of these my
[1:10:48] brethren there's also going to be
[1:10:50] surprises on the other side where Jesus
[1:10:52] where they say Jesus did we not cast out
[1:10:54] devils and prophesy and do all these
[1:10:56] things and Jesus said I never knew you
[1:10:58] now I don't want any surprises on the
[1:11:01] day of judgment you guys everybody hear
[1:11:03] me I don't know the words I want to know
[1:11:06] his side I'm on right now I'm going to
[1:11:08] make my calling election sure right now
[1:11:10] so there's no surprises for me on the
[1:11:12] day of judgment so when I close my eyes
[1:11:15] and death I know that my spiritual eyes
[1:11:17] to be open and I'll see engines backing
[1:11:19] me to that sixth dimension amen because
[1:11:23] it's good because of how much we fell in
[1:11:26] love with Jesus because the Holy Spirit
[1:11:28] led us into all truth because that's the
[1:11:31] evidence of the Holy Ghost how do you
[1:11:33] know he got the Holy Ghost she spoke in
[1:11:34] tongues no I know a lot of people have
[1:11:36] spoken tongues that committed adultery
[1:11:37] and got divorce and broke all kinds of
[1:11:41] scriptures that doesn't just proves God
[1:11:43] was anointing your tongue to speak in
[1:11:44] tongues which is a great blessing the
[1:11:46] Bible says it's great edification to you
[1:11:48] but Paul went on and say I'd rather
[1:11:50] speak five words you can understand then
[1:11:53] 10,000 and an unknown tongue God wants
[1:11:56] us to grow deeper in the understanding
[1:11:57] of the word of God God wants us to
[1:11:59] understand God's Word his will and he
[1:12:02] wants us to obey it did you know
[1:12:06] well you know it but did you ever think
[1:12:08] about this how there's only one or first
[1:12:10] Great Commandment there's only one you
[1:12:14] know Jesus will be called one name in
[1:12:16] the millennium I would said there'll be
[1:12:17] one Lord in his name one have one way to
[1:12:19] can't dress
[1:12:21] he might have all these titles but
[1:12:22] there's one name to the husband there's
[1:12:25] one name in the first day of creation
[1:12:28] there was only one light that came forth
[1:12:30] let there be light there's one light not
[1:12:33] two lights one light the other light Sun
[1:12:36] and Moon they came later stars they came
[1:12:37] later on the first day they run one
[1:12:40] light Northern Light just one light
[1:12:42] God's light hey man God said I am the
[1:12:45] light of the world amen and he's still
[1:12:48] alive the world in you and I praise God
[1:12:51] the Bible said there's only one
[1:12:53] sacrifice Jesus Christ to see that's why
[1:12:55] we say Muslims though they believe in
[1:12:57] Christ but they don't recognize that his
[1:12:59] blood paid for their sins so they they
[1:13:01] their sins remain on them because there
[1:13:03] is only one sacrifice there's one
[1:13:06] mediator between God and man so see this
[1:13:08] is where we start to see the importance
[1:13:10] of this of the numbers making the Virgin
[1:13:13] Mary a mediator which the Roman Catholic
[1:13:15] Church does they call her mediatrix that
[1:13:18] blasphemes the primacy or preeminence of
[1:13:22] Christ and the church said that's why
[1:13:25] numbers are so important the Bob
[1:13:26] wouldn't say he's one of the mediators
[1:13:28] and you can also pray to st. John and
[1:13:30] st. Jude and all these things like that
[1:13:32] he's the only mediator he's the only one
[1:13:35] that were here first and he won't say
[1:13:36] here approaches warning a man because
[1:13:39] he's plural amen he has the preeminence
[1:13:42] he deserves primacy Jesus Christ is the
[1:13:45] only way you can get help today I'm
[1:13:47] doing his help
[1:13:48] hey man it's offered all the time we
[1:13:52] just got to come to the one mediator
[1:13:54] there's one bread for one body of
[1:13:58] believers
[1:13:59] that's first Corinthians 10:17 there's
[1:14:02] only one bread there's only one source
[1:14:03] for food oh thank you lord and there's
[1:14:07] only one body hallelujah now unity again
[1:14:12] I didn't have a whole lot of time on
[1:14:13] this one I was as I saw the amount you
[1:14:15] know I just read chapter one and I
[1:14:17] didn't go beyond that this was in
[1:14:18] chapter 1 so I'm gonna move on to
[1:14:20] chapter 2 and
[1:14:20] but unity the Bible said they had one
[1:14:23] heart one Accord in acts 1 art one soul
[1:14:26] one mind in the book of Acts so see it
[1:14:29] can mean it can mean primacy but it can
[1:14:32] also mean unity as well in church that's
[1:14:37] what we if if we can get to this now
[1:14:39] we've seen God do miracles among us heal
[1:14:41] people say people but when we get to
[1:14:43] this more often we'll see more of the
[1:14:44] power of God how many understand that
[1:14:46] that's all we got to pray we got live
[1:14:48] lives at home that's worth of the gospel
[1:14:50] and you know a church you know if you're
[1:14:52] coming to church with a spirit of
[1:14:53] expectation right we know if we're
[1:14:55] coming to church hungry for God or not
[1:14:57] we got to be hungry we got to cast all
[1:14:59] of the things of the world we got to get
[1:15:01] in one man set that we want to see Jesus
[1:15:03] Christ manifested in our lives amen we
[1:15:06] want to see a manifested on the job in
[1:15:07] our home in our church and there as we
[1:15:09] get one Accord we see more of God moving
[1:15:11] all the time oh it's so true if we can
[1:15:15] just get one Accord it we're not worried
[1:15:16] about after service we're not worried
[1:15:18] about next week or next month I don't
[1:15:20] know we're always be concerned about is
[1:15:21] what is Jesus gonna speak to us today
[1:15:23] amen
[1:15:25] now remember Satan can imitate one and I
[1:15:28] didn't have much time on this either I
[1:15:29] know I'm not I'm not even doing this I'm
[1:15:32] not even scratching the surface Church I
[1:15:33] know I'm not so you have to bear with me
[1:15:35] this is just this is all of the things I
[1:15:37] brought out and in my studies the last
[1:15:39] week summer Satan has a limitation one
[1:15:42] one World Order or one unionized
[1:15:44] religion and of course the tower Babel
[1:15:46] Babel they had one language okay so I'm
[1:15:49] showing you there's both sides Satan
[1:15:50] copied it and there's both sides here
[1:15:53] all right number two you know the meat
[1:15:57] now these two may be the same you know
[1:15:58] like I said I'm not have that say the
[1:16:01] Horde this morning I'm just trying to
[1:16:03] find all the different interpretations
[1:16:05] two can mean division when you divide
[1:16:07] something different so contrasting two
[1:16:10] things a testimony you need two
[1:16:12] witnesses two can also mean friendship
[1:16:14] or unity as well so one can the unity so
[1:16:17] can two to community as well all right
[1:16:20] Butler have said - he said yes - is a
[1:16:24] confirmation but if four will confirm it
[1:16:26] it'll be a double double confirmation so
[1:16:28] I wrote that down for later when we
[1:16:29] preach on number four four can be an
[1:16:31] earthly number four can be deliverance
[1:16:33] for
[1:16:34] also be a double confirmation then we
[1:16:38] ought to believe with all of our hearts
[1:16:40] are you are you enjoying this so far I
[1:16:42] just well I just thought oh man this is
[1:16:44] gonna be great because we know why
[1:16:46] because I want to see God more in my
[1:16:48] life I want God to reveal himself more
[1:16:51] in the numbers and the timings and the
[1:16:53] years and the months why does this
[1:16:55] happen for that purpose why do these
[1:16:56] things happen so to represents division
[1:17:00] in these ways to is the first number
[1:17:02] that can be divided but on the second
[1:17:06] day of creation the FIR minute was
[1:17:08] divided I'm sorry the Fermin it divide
[1:17:11] the waters from the waters
[1:17:12] so what happened on day 2 Division 2
[1:17:17] represents division sheep are divided
[1:17:20] the Bible actually uses that literal
[1:17:22] word on the on the day of judgment of
[1:17:25] the white throne judgment they're
[1:17:26] divided sheep on the right hand goats on
[1:17:28] the left there are two classes of
[1:17:32] believers so God divides the class into
[1:17:34] two groups ones on the throne ones the
[1:17:36] wise ones the foolish then he has two
[1:17:39] classes of unbelievers that make
[1:17:40] believers and the unbelievers he has two
[1:17:42] classes two divides there was two goats
[1:17:46] for a sin-offering on the day of
[1:17:48] atonement which was divided Israel from
[1:17:51] their sin I love that the first goat
[1:17:54] paid the price of all their sins so
[1:17:57] payment was paid by the first coat the
[1:18:00] second goat separated them from their
[1:18:02] sin amen
[1:18:03] so it took two goats to separate Israel
[1:18:07] from their sins hallelujah not one - you
[1:18:11] see see how this is important now
[1:18:14] comparing and I'm sorry contrasting is
[1:18:17] the difference so when we can trash we
[1:18:19] find two things and their differences so
[1:18:22] Adam the Bible calls Adam he's the first
[1:18:24] Adam a living soul that's the the
[1:18:27] contrary or the opposite of Jesus who is
[1:18:30] the last Adam the cricketing spirit you
[1:18:33] see that God is contrasting them showing
[1:18:36] there's a difference the first Adam fell
[1:18:38] the second Adam can't fall I know yeah
[1:18:43] difference in twins well think of
[1:18:47] different these are all differences
[1:18:48] between Isaac and Ishmael we are talked
[1:18:50] about that one earlier Jacob and Esau
[1:18:52] Abraham a lot but there but their
[1:18:54] differences as far as believers because
[1:18:56] lot was saved Moses and Balaam heaven in
[1:18:59] hell Jesus and Judas heaven in hell also
[1:19:03] differences opposites of law versus
[1:19:05] grace faith versus works light versus
[1:19:08] dark truth versus lie hot cold wet dry
[1:19:11] heaven earth body spirit wise foolish
[1:19:14] heaven hell - vines amen
[1:19:16] the true behind the false vine all the
[1:19:20] New Testaments which again was long
[1:19:21] Greeks you had the Aaronic priesthood
[1:19:23] and today were under the Melchizedek
[1:19:25] Priesthood there's the difference today
[1:19:28] is the new priesthood hallelujah now to
[1:19:32] speaks to have an a testimony as well or
[1:19:35] having a witness
[1:19:36] oh good 12 minutes glory God is seeking
[1:19:40] true worshipers with the testimony of
[1:19:43] worshiping with spirit and in truth we
[1:19:46] all know you can have the right
[1:19:47] anointing but be wrong in your truth we
[1:19:50] all know you can have all of the truth
[1:19:52] but don't have the love of God the
[1:19:54] anointing of God so now if you have both
[1:19:57] now you have a testimony how much true
[1:19:58] worshipper there will be two prophets in
[1:20:02] the bottle of this the Bible literally
[1:20:03] says they give their testimony to their
[1:20:07] whole purpose is to give a testimony to
[1:20:10] Jesus Christ they made during the
[1:20:12] tribulation at the end of their
[1:20:14] testimony the remnant received Jesus
[1:20:16] Christ Oh glory wisdom and knowledge
[1:20:20] testified to a true understanding or I
[1:20:23] have knowledge about the water baptism
[1:20:24] well you need wisdom though have you
[1:20:26] been baptized with a true repentant
[1:20:28] heart if you got unknown knowledge and
[1:20:30] wisdom about that and you act upon that
[1:20:32] now you've got true understanding you've
[1:20:34] got a revelation oil and wine testifies
[1:20:38] the true worship and healing because
[1:20:41] Jesus poured the oil on the line for
[1:20:43] healing on the prodigal right I'm not
[1:20:45] probably go on the the man who was
[1:20:47] beaten and the Jesus told the Antichrist
[1:20:51] spirit touch not the oil and wine glory
[1:20:55] so brother man said olá was the Holy
[1:20:57] Ghost baptism and
[1:20:59] is the stimulation it brings to you and
[1:21:03] he said gnats he said spiritual Lord has
[1:21:05] the same effect on a man as natural line
[1:21:08] does and that's how I feel this morning
[1:21:10] hey Cory it makes you happy said you
[1:21:13] become animated brother Aaron says
[1:21:14] you'll become a Johnson when you're
[1:21:16] drinking the line of the Holy Ghost
[1:21:18] a man bread and wine testified to
[1:21:24] Jesus's body and blood when you partake
[1:21:27] of both it's a testament that you're
[1:21:29] waiting for it's coming because he said
[1:21:31] do these things until I return right so
[1:21:34] when you take both the bread and the
[1:21:35] wine now you have a testimony that you
[1:21:38] believe in Jesus Christ you're waiting
[1:21:39] for us coming Moses said this now of
[1:21:44] course this wasn't it you know in a
[1:21:46] negative sense he said I call heaven and
[1:21:48] earth to witness against Israel this day
[1:21:50] because they were going to eventually
[1:21:51] break the Covenant they were gonna get
[1:21:53] kicked out the promised land and Jesus
[1:21:56] said in the mouth of two or three
[1:21:57] witnesses let every word be established
[1:21:58] so that gives someone a testimony when
[1:22:00] this person says that this person says
[1:22:02] it now you've got a testimony alright
[1:22:05] two represents friendship or unity
[1:22:07] divine friendship the Bible said there's
[1:22:09] a friend that sticketh closer than a
[1:22:12] brother so you got all these friends but
[1:22:15] there's one friend who's better than all
[1:22:16] of them that's Jesus Christ he's your
[1:22:19] greatest friend praise God how many glad
[1:22:21] he sticks close to you when it feels
[1:22:23] like you don't have any friends if he's
[1:22:25] like nobody cares about you nobody's
[1:22:26] playing for you
[1:22:27] just remember Jesus prayed for you and
[1:22:29] he's your closest friend amen
[1:22:32] it's you and him it's you and him
[1:22:35] friendship husband and wife of course
[1:22:38] types Christ of the church I love that
[1:22:39] word Song of Solomon said this is my
[1:22:41] beloved this is my friend husband wife
[1:22:46] friendship brothers we need to be
[1:22:48] friendly to our wives sisters wives we
[1:22:51] need to be friendly to our husbands
[1:22:52] that's real friendship another
[1:22:56] second commandment it's about friendship
[1:22:58] its to love your neighbor as yourself I
[1:23:01] love it
[1:23:03] the second - right - represents
[1:23:05] friendship two fellows in one ship
[1:23:07] brother Branham says his fellowship and
[1:23:09] two or three gathered in Christ's name
[1:23:11] brings his presence how many like that
[1:23:13] now like I said I hardly have any on
[1:23:15] this I just had one say in either add it
[1:23:18] or takes away from God's Word and what
[1:23:20] does that cause that causes division so
[1:23:23] Satan can either add to the Bible or
[1:23:25] take away and that is an act of division
[1:23:28] he's dividing people from the Word of
[1:23:31] God so like I said the what I've read it
[1:23:35] hasn't given many of Satan's numbers so
[1:23:37] and I don't really know how far I want
[1:23:38] to study into that to be honest with you
[1:23:40] so if I'm you know if you were more into
[1:23:42] the cult than I was well then keep it to
[1:23:44] yourself because I already know want to
[1:23:45] know you know I know most people here
[1:23:47] weren't I know a couple brothers who
[1:23:48] were they would know about that but I
[1:23:50] don't want to start studying those
[1:23:51] things too deep I'll just give you God's
[1:23:53] and if you know God's and you can cast
[1:23:54] out anything that exalts itself against
[1:23:57] God's numbers amen that's right now
[1:24:00] we'll close with this here and give me a
[1:24:02] I got eight minutes this is probably the
[1:24:07] biggest number in scripture that I've
[1:24:08] that I've seen so far three three means
[1:24:11] divine perfection when me - which means
[1:24:12] God did it and it is totally perfect
[1:24:15] there's no flaws in it and brother
[1:24:18] Branham said three is life as well
[1:24:21] brother Branham said that he said now we
[1:24:23] understand God is perfected in threes
[1:24:25] now God is perfected in three five
[1:24:27] graces five seven is completion like the
[1:24:29] world God is perfected in Father Son
[1:24:31] Holy Ghost
[1:24:31] that's the perfection of the Godhead all
[1:24:33] one God in three manifestations of three
[1:24:35] attributes of one God or three offices
[1:24:38] in the one Godhead now there's also
[1:24:41] three imperfection of the steps of grace
[1:24:43] to the Church justification
[1:24:45] sanctification baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:24:47] that consists of the new birth just like
[1:24:49] a natural birth is tight with by it
[1:24:50] which a woman giving birth to a child
[1:24:52] the first thing comes forth is water
[1:24:54] blood and then life he says seven is
[1:24:59] God's number of completion three is
[1:25:01] God's perfect number so there's three
[1:25:05] and there's seven threes so
[1:25:06] mathematically spiritually by the word
[1:25:08] by the witnesses of the Holy Ghost
[1:25:10] it has completed the thing together he
[1:25:12] said let's study it aren't you glad we
[1:25:14] can study it today glory and here's
[1:25:17] where he says three's a number of life
[1:25:19] listen close he said I mean he said
[1:25:21] seven is the number of completion three
[1:25:24] is the number life so we'll go like I
[1:25:31] said I'm not gonna I'm not gonna breathe
[1:25:32] this in fact I may save some this for
[1:25:34] Wednesday that may save me a little bit
[1:25:36] of pressure over the week here cuz
[1:25:38] Monday I'll be I won't have time to
[1:25:39] study will be out in Jeffersonville but
[1:25:40] I'll just preach until this timer goes
[1:25:42] off is that okay by God's grace okay
[1:25:44] good thank you so we and like I said I
[1:25:48] have not even scratched the surface of
[1:25:49] this there's so much more this is just
[1:25:51] what I found from ballinger's book so in
[1:25:54] nature there's divine perfection solids
[1:25:57] have length width and height time is
[1:26:00] complete with the past present future
[1:26:04] relationships are complete in three
[1:26:06] points of view first person second
[1:26:08] person third person three points of view
[1:26:11] human capabilities this is all you can
[1:26:14] do you can only do these three things
[1:26:15] Church you can only think speak and do
[1:26:18] that's all you can do what else can you
[1:26:20] do and we think of anything else to give
[1:26:23] that's all you can do
[1:26:25] god perfected it God made sure there's
[1:26:27] only three channels that we could do the
[1:26:29] kingdoms of matter according to science
[1:26:32] our mineral like the earth animal
[1:26:34] vegetable that's it that's all the only
[1:26:38] kingdoms that matter there are in nature
[1:26:42] a babies born in three steps water blood
[1:26:45] spirit we just heard brother BAM say
[1:26:46] that the wheat plant has three stages
[1:26:48] stalk tassel grain man's being has three
[1:26:51] parts body soul spirit the purifying of
[1:26:53] the earth is the flood of Noah Christ's
[1:26:55] blood and the atomic fire or volcanic
[1:26:58] fire that will come at the end of
[1:27:00] Armageddon the earthly witnesses of
[1:27:03] water blood Spears that kind of ties in
[1:27:06] with the baby there's three witnesses
[1:27:08] that the baby's born water blood spirit
[1:27:11] there's three races of men I don't have
[1:27:14] these in the right order because I've
[1:27:15] never studied on this this has been I
[1:27:17] never felt led of the Lord to study on
[1:27:18] that well there's basically three races
[1:27:20] of men Jew Gentile Samaritan which stem
[1:27:22] from ham
[1:27:23] and Japheth Noah's three sons that came
[1:27:26] out of the Ark in creation day three in
[1:27:31] Genesis had three things mentioned the
[1:27:34] waters and land were separated and then
[1:27:37] seeds came up three things and to prove
[1:27:41] you that three means life the Bible said
[1:27:43] the seeds rose up out of the earth which
[1:27:46] symbolizes the resurrection of Jesus
[1:27:48] Christ even I know yeah divine
[1:27:51] perfection God gives life on the third
[1:27:53] day amen
[1:27:54] Jonah came out on the third day three
[1:27:57] his life hallelujah aren't you glad for
[1:27:59] life amen

[1:28:02] three terrestrial celestial and
[1:28:06] glorified I'm glad I've heard from at
[1:28:07] least two of them praise the Lord oh
[1:28:09] yeah because the Bible said don't you
[1:28:12] know that even though the angels of the
[1:28:14] child behold the face of the Father in
[1:28:16] heaven thus the Alpha knees are waiting
[1:28:18] for us by the throne of God amen brother

[1:28:24] me the Holy Spirit you heard from your
[1:28:25] theophany so another I can't explain
[1:28:27] that through scripture I preached on
[1:28:29] that a few years ago when I preached I'm
[1:28:30] Melchizedek I can't explain that but I
[1:28:32] believe it because sometimes I feel just
[1:28:33] like heaven come down Church sometimes I
[1:28:36] feel like I know heaven is here God is
[1:28:38] here that is moving God is speaking God
[1:28:41] is leading guiding healing we just feel

[1:29:07] I'm just so joyful I can hardly help
[1:29:10] myself
[1:29:10] glory and I've felt two of those bodies
[1:29:14] I sure like the theophany a lot better
[1:29:15] than this this pest house right here
[1:29:19] there's three heavens brother Branham
[1:29:21] says this entry store seal there's the
[1:29:23] first heaven as the clouds he calls it
[1:29:25] clouds which we know you know science
[1:29:27] calls the atmosphere then there's the
[1:29:30] whole universe which brother BAM calls a
[1:29:31] solar system but we know there's many
[1:29:33] solar systems right but he means the
[1:29:35] whole universe
[1:29:37] then there's God's throne which my man
[1:29:38] calls heaven so there's three heavens
[1:29:41] Paul was caught up to the third heaven
[1:29:43] the throne of God that holy place praise
[1:29:46] the Lord amen
[1:29:48] in creation oh yeah I'm sorry yeah Bill
[1:29:51] Graham yeah bro Graham also said this
[1:29:53] about the three heavens this is
[1:29:55] interesting there's the Holy Spirit and
[1:29:58] jugg beings and gods Thrones I don't
[1:30:00] know if heaven has three divisions but
[1:30:02] he said that he said that's what the
[1:30:04] third heaven means so this could be it
[1:30:05] could be a wrong quo or it could be
[1:30:06] something that God could give us
[1:30:07] understanding later well just I'm going
[1:30:09] to keep up on the shelf and the church
[1:30:12] said keep it up there on the shelf can't
[1:30:15] work with it right now and I'm I can't
[1:30:16] I'm working right now
[1:30:17] maybe something God will reveal to us
[1:30:19] later on I just got a couple minutes
[1:30:24] here bear with me there's divine
[1:30:26] perfection in the Godhead we know God
[1:30:29] there's one name to the Father Son and
[1:30:31] Holy Ghost God above us the Father God
[1:30:34] with us God the Son and God in us God
[1:30:37] the Holy Ghost now it's not God the son
[1:30:39] if I said that forgive me the Bible
[1:30:40] doesn't say God the Son it's the son of
[1:30:42] God that's a Catholic dogma God the Son
[1:30:45] so I'm sorry I didn't mean to say God
[1:30:46] the Son so forgive me now it's perfect
[1:30:51] because the Bible said these three bear
[1:30:53] record in heaven amen so God can bear
[1:30:56] record on every soul that was ever on
[1:30:58] the earth because he's both Father Son
[1:31:00] and Holy Ghost these three bear record
[1:31:03] in heaven the father the word and the
[1:31:05] Holy Ghost these three are one that's
[1:31:08] purr that's a perfect divine witness and
[1:31:10] record of everything that's ever
[1:31:11] happened in the whole universe there's
[1:31:14] three attributes of God God is
[1:31:16] all-powerful omnipotent God is
[1:31:19] omnipresent everywhere by foreknowledge
[1:31:21] right and he's omniscient he's
[1:31:23] all-knowing so because he's omniscient
[1:31:26] all-knowing he can be everywhere at one
[1:31:28] time because he just he can
[1:31:30] he created time he it's something some
[1:31:33] creation outside of him you know he
[1:31:34] created that and he knows everything
[1:31:36] that's going on in there my brother
[1:31:37] Hannah said he's not like God he said
[1:31:38] God's not in a tree remember brother
[1:31:40] Graham said that God's not in a tree
[1:31:42] God's not in the carpet right he's a
[1:31:44] being and he chooses what to dwell in
[1:31:46] but because his foreknowledge he can be
[1:31:48] in this room right now everybody also he
[1:31:51] sends his home
[1:31:51] the spirit - amen ah here's my hour just
[1:31:54] let me finish this slide hopefully oh I

[1:33:24] look at those hands amen this is just
[1:33:26] one way this is not the only way of
[1:33:28] course but this is one way remember how
[1:33:32] brother Brandon how did brother ham new
[1:33:33] he's supposed to go west remember he had
[1:33:35] seven dreams and then the vision capped
[1:33:38] it off as the eighth one remember that
[1:33:40] from services at the end time seven
[1:33:42] people in the church all dreamed about
[1:33:43] brother Branham going out west going out
[1:33:45] west the the the rock and the pyramid
[1:33:47] and and the crowbar taking off the top
[1:33:49] of the pyramid all these things seven
[1:33:51] people had but the eighth one he said
[1:33:53] capped it off and and then when he got
[1:33:58] done preaching the seven see I think I
[1:34:00] share this with brother John recently
[1:34:02] when he got done preaching the Seventh
[1:34:04] Seal brother
[1:34:05] said this was the thing I wondered about
[1:34:07] my whole life
[1:34:08] Amy a 54 year old man saying I've
[1:34:12] wondered what did this fest mean I had
[1:34:14] I've had these questions in my life for
[1:34:16] 54 years and God has told me gods
[1:34:19] revealed to me out through the numbers
[1:34:21] of the dreams and visions a man
[1:34:23] oh no yeah but see we got to pay
[1:34:25] attention I'm not saying you got a big
[1:34:29] yourself over spiritual but I'm saying
[1:34:30] you got to pay attention when God is
[1:34:32] speaking to you I'm saying I need to pay
[1:34:35] better attention to God speaking to me
[1:34:38] let's just bow our heads let me pray for
[1:34:40] you
[1:34:40] churches pray for other people in here
[1:34:42] that God will continue to speak to us
[1:34:44] reveal himself to us through the numbers
[1:34:47] of our lives through dreams visions
[1:34:50] prophecies let's pray together Heavenly
[1:34:52] Father in Jesus Christ's name how great
[1:34:56] you are Lord God you just blew the stars
[1:35:00] off your hands and the stars are
[1:35:04] numberless Lord God as the grains of the
