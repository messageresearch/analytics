here once we're all rested up by God's grace Deuteronomy 34 verse 5 well kind of I'll start with the text of the first question the first questions about the body of Moses so we'll just start there Deuteronomy 34 verse 5 if you're there say Amen let's read 34 so let's read 5 and 6 together that's a lot of reading but let's try it this morning by God's grace on three ready one two three so Moses the servant of the Lord died there in the land of Moab according to the word of the Lord and he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab over against Beth peor but no man knoweth of his supplicant to this day amen let's have word of Prayer everything on your hearts make it known unto God Heavenly Father we are all needy Lord but we know you're Jehovah Jireh we know you're our Father Abba Father

Heavenly Father may be glorified Lord and all that's said and done Lord just guide me Lord questions that answers our are challenging at times so lord help me Lord by the Holy Spirit to rightly divide the word of truth lest each and every heart and soul Lord God we love you and we just want to know more of you that we might love you more and that we might meet you in the air Lord God at your Second Coming we give you all the glory in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless yous being seated to praise the Lord I know one thing I forgot my mother-in-law Tammy's here let's give her around flaws my God's grace god bless you Tammy you know as I always say Tammy is always such a huge help and supporter to our family and every time I think about it I just want to cry I feel it coming now but you know we you know every time we've had a baby all seven she's come on everyone and give us such a tremendous help and now you know her main help now you know is just to help with all the other children and they just love grandma the grandma with waffles Ruby my mom is the grandma with tacos and so we're we're just so grateful for Tammy all that she does and and we couldn't have not done our construction at home without Tammy you know she's really helped us out in so many ways and I feel like we got a new house you know at least half a new house and but we're grateful you know cuz you know like that song said we're just borrowing that house for a little while you know that when the Lord comes and you know God's gonna burn the whole earth again before he comes back and to start all over but during these few years it's nice to have a fresh start you know and to give the place of children like to be at you know a place to be honest I like to be at - our house was you know from the 60s and rather old you know so it's nice to have some renovations and so forth like that and we'll be paying for for a few years but we're grateful anything worth having is worth paying for so we're grateful God is so good to us Church and we're just you know God has provided every need you know as the families increased you know God's provided every need and I thought you know I can grow a beard now that I got seven kids you know I thought well I'll just try to grow beard but I can't really grow beard as you can see you know so it's like aren't you going to shave before you I think I have seven kids now you know I think I can hold a beard now for a while you know I don't know too many people that have seven kids you know I'll just joke about yeah I really haven't had time to shave you know I look awful anyway but that's okay so you can switch over maokai had this but we're grateful you know we were so delighted and I've seen all seven babies born it's a miracle every time and you know the midwives were just complimenting my wife on her birth and how she takes care of herself and and we're thankful so thankful for Chris and all that she does at the home you know and our family wouldn't be what it is without Kristin you know she's the backbone of the family and we're just so grateful for all that she does and may God give a rest today she's at home resting live streaming so honey if I say anything wrong I'm sure we'll talk about it when we get home by God's grace hopefully I didn't say anything wrong so far sometimes I thought little secrets I shouldn't you know people tell me not to tell I just forget you know and and then sometimes I mention the wrong scripture a wife will help me correct me at home so I should appreciate a godly wife like that by God's grace so like I said I have four questions and I think we'll get to all of them by the grace of the Lord here the first one was great a great question there was more of an explained eye and I kind of paraphrase that if that's okay I kind of paraphrase the questions they could fit on the slides but the basically said explained Jude 1 verse 9 when Michael was arguing about the devil I'm sorry with the devil about Moses's body can you please explain more on the might on Michael the Archangel so let's go to Jude chapter 1 verse 9 there's only one chapter of course Jude 1:9 as these are great questions by the way I'm so thankful brother branham said it too he loves to get questions from the people I love the questions because it lets me know what's on your heart it lets me know if there's anything I need to preach on to help give understanding I've got a lot of questions you know there's things I'm going to be studying and answering questions myself especially with the trumpets you know the Feast of Trumpets that whole sermon is always been a puzzle to me so Lord willing this summer I want to really go slowly through that message but Jude 1 verse 9 says yet Michael the Archangel now to get the context and verse eight Jude is kind of rebuking false preachers that speak evil things against the true preachers so in verse 80 saying likewise also these filthy dreamers defile the flesh despise Dominion and speak evil of dignities so the context is false preachers will always speak evil against you know people in high authority or high honor in verse nine yet Michael the Archangel when contending with the devil he disputed about the body of Moses Durst not bring against him a railing accusation but said the Lord rebuke thee so in context this scripture is showing how even an angel and Archangel Michael will not even bring a railing accusation against Satan himself and so that's why these preachers who speak evil of dignitaries and do evil things like that that's why they'll be condemned is because they're not afraid to speak evil railing accusation against other men of God or other Christians and yet even angels won't even say evil things like that - Satan himself so that's really humbling for all of us right and we all need to be careful what we say about dignities can you say amen to that we must be very careful if angels won't even say evil things to Satan we better be careful what we say about other people now in the context so in the context we'll get to the context in just a moment but let me give the quick answer the the longer question was wondering did Moses die or not and so so yes first Moses did die but Elijah did not okay so we read that for our text both men or their anointings it could be their anointings - but I personally leave it'll be the literal men because Jesus brought back Moses and Elijah on Mount Transfiguration and Peter James and John saw both of their theophanies right and so I believe those very same men will preach to Israel soon whether it's in the next year five years ten years hundred years we don't know but God so honored those two prophets that he brought them back down from heaven in Jesus's day and he's going to use them in Israel when Israel it has the blinders taken off and now they can finally see Jesus was our Messiah Jesus was Isaiah 53 so I believe the men or their anointings will come back to minister the 144,000 now here's the scripture God told Joshua he said Moses my servant is dead so clearly Moses died and the scripture this was our text if you read the whole context it's verses 1 to 8 Moses died in Moab probably on top of a mountain the last thing we hear about him is that he died in mountain on a mountain the last thing we heard about him was he was on a mountain and then the Bible said he died and then they buried him in a valley in the land of Moab saw some valley now here's a more on the answer Moses his death represent his and his eventual resurrection because that's what we know what happened we get to that a moment Moses death represents the dead in Christ so Moses died but then Jesus or God resurrected him shortly after his death we don't know when but at some point after Moses died God resurrected him because in Jude 1 the devil's arguing he's like where is the body of Moses where is it at because remember Satan had dominion over all the people that died because when Adam because Adam forfeited all the rights in the Garden of Eden and the Bible said whoever you're overcome by you become enslaved to so because Adam has a son of God fell and chose to fall on purpose to Satan now Satan has that dominion over all dead people so Satan you know Moses died and Satan's waiting down for the body he's waiting for the bow you know he's waiting for Moses to come down well at some point I don't know how long if he did go down or not to to paradise or not but at some point he doesn't see the body of Moses where's the body of Moses I'm supposed to have the body of Moses and all Michael says is the Lord rebuke you God rebukes you Satan then that's because God resurrected Moses's body and took it up to heaven so Moses was a perfect type of Christ so and everything everything about Moses his life resembled Jesus Christ now Elijah he never died at all so Elijah represents we which are alive and remain and brother Branham said mount Transfiguration was a preview of the second coming of Jesus Christ and it is we can see that plainly here's the quotes the Prophet said there we see him representing those who died Moses to represent the dead Saints Elijah with his group at the last day with his raptured group standing there so when Jesus comes back to the rapture the Bible says in first Thessalonians 4 he's gonna stop in the air the dead in Christ will rise first well that's those who have died I'd like Paul Martin Luther John Wesley we believe brother Branham Billy Graham all these men any man who was filled with the Holy Ghost will be raised up and will will see them first will see the dead in Christ because that's what happened when Jesus resurrected the dead the dead raised first and they saw them and then they will go to meet them in the air and then we which are alive and remain if it's privileged if we're privileged or blessed to be that then our bodies will be changed our bodies will be swallowed up in life and then we'll go to meet him in the air that's what the Bible says and first that's thrown is for let's read it just just four so you got it first Thessalonians chapter four just so no one knows or everybody knows I'm not making this up this is all in the Bible it's got to happen just like it happened in Jesus day everything in here has to happen praise God we're so grateful for that first Thessalonians chapter 4 verse 16 I believe Malachi can you read 16 and 17 sir yes sir amen so you have Jesus Christ in the air and you have two groups with him those who are dead but now resurrected and those who don't have to die they get a body change and they go to meet Christ in the air you have two groups there and that's exactly what we saw on Mount Transfiguration let me skip ahead to the picture that's exactly what we see I'm out Transfiguration we have Peter James and John you have Jesus you have Moses and Moses represents those who died but are resurrected and then you have Elijah who never died and the he's worked those that are alive and remain he's the he's the symbol of all of us by God's grace you know if the rapture takes place in our life it might not it might be generations down the road but if it happens in our life we believe by the faith of Christ our bodies will be changed and we'll won't have to die we'll have to go meet that we'll go to meet our Lord in the air okay so let me go back and read the quotes so you got them here this is God's Word and fallible every word that he says come to pass he said now if we want we can take the 70 chapter of Matthew a few days after that Jesus take Peter James and John up into the mountain apart to be witnesses Peter James and John and they seen the kingdom of God come and power they seen the coming of the kingdom of God rehearsed right amen oh they were brought into view of watching the kingdom of God rehearse as it come the issuing in all of the millennium they seen the rehearsal now go to Matthew 16 why did Jesus do this so in other words why did Jesus do this Jesus showed them this because he promised to do that in matthew 16 jesus promised to show some of them the coming of the Lord so they got a preview so Matthew chapter 16 verse 28 Lydia can you read that you got that oh you don't have it okay Malachi can you read 28 sorry amen so Jesus standing there he tells the disciples some of you are going to see the second coming of the Son of Man and so then a few days later I think we have seven days later from not mistaken Jesus takes some of them up and they see the preview or the rehearsal of the second coming of Jesus Christ there's going to be the dead in Christ there's going to be those which alive remain this is also a preview of God returning to Israel with the 144,000 amen so it's a beautiful preview and brother branham he likens it unto when the movie ten commandments by Cecil DeMille came out he said before Cecil DeMille movie came out he invited Oral Roberts aaand all these preachers to preview the movie before it was released to the public road Ram said that's what Jesus did on Mount Transfiguration he had a preview about what he was going to do and he invited these people to come and see it of course we know they didn't have to give their opinions Jesus was just showing them what it was going to be like praise God and he was rehearsing to them the second coming of the Lord so that's what we see by the grace of Lord now let me go a little bit further oh yeah I just read this to you he said Oral Roberts one of them Cecil DeMille the Ten Commandments he called her brother should care and brother Roberts many preachers across the land any preacher could come and be invited to come into their studio before the picture was ever released and let them see the rehearsal of it before it was ever showed out when they was charging $25 a ticket they seen the rehearsal of it that they might pass their opinion on whether there was any critics about it or what could be said so forth they seen it before the public seen it and Jesus said some of you standing here amen will not taste of death until they see the kingdom of God coming in power or see the Son of man coming in his kingdom rather see the Son of man coming in his kingdom amen oh so does that help by God's grace okay so more the answer Satan was arguing over Moses body because Satan had claimed on all the dead but God did not give it to Satan God resurrected Moses as a type of Christ and there's our scripture we read earlier he was contending give me that body give me that body and the devil and the ant Michael's like no rebuke the Lord rebukes you in other words he's not giving it the answer he said just rebuking you you and we're not gonna talk about it oh god is so great and the Prophet said in future home he said notice again he raised up Moses from the grave he was raised up where's his grave can anybody find it but read the book of Jude see the Archangel disputing with the Archangel Satan said the Michael said the Lord rebuke you disputing over the body of Moses I'm gonna skip ahead he said no his body was packed away the Angels took him he did not mortify he did not corrupt so brother Branham believed that even Moses was was raptured or resurrected even before the three days kind of like Jesus how the Bible said Jesus body did not corrupt right the Bible says that in Psalms chapter 16 so it didn't go past three days that's why I had to berate within the third day and so brother Branham even believe that perhaps Moses is his body did not corrupt either but that God resurrected it before it would corrupt and he says God took him up in the rapture so Moses had a half year to glory in the Old Testament every man went to the heart so yeah I hope I don't know if the people know this but here here so you know in the Old Testament every man went to the heart of the earth when they died and they're either tormented down there or they were put to Abraham's bosom and Jesus said this but remember God took Moses to heaven so Moses must not or maybe wasn't down there very long because Jesus said so shall the Son of Man be three days and nights in the heart of the earth so when Jesus died his body was left in the subtle but his spirit went to the heart of the earth and he preached the souls that were in prison okay we know the Bible says that in 1st Peter chapter 3 but remember Jesus also said when the beggar died he was carried by the Angels into Abraham's bosom so maybe Moses was there three days or a little short short of three days I don't know but at some point Jesus called his spirit back up or God called his spirit back up and then rat raptured him and took him to heaven so you when you died you either went to Abraham's bosom or you went to the place of torment which is like a prison house until the white throne judgment the day of judgment but we know now Abraham and Jesus resurrected he brought all those Saints up with him and many of them were seen and then he took him to heaven so now paradise isn't in the heart of the earth now paradise is up in heaven that's what the scripture says by God's grace so if you didn't know about that there's there's of course plenty more scriptures on that but I just want to give a quick answer to that that great question now here's some more let's look at look at Michael now this is my opinion only in my opinion Michael is only an archangel and he's not the person of Jesus Christ that's just my opinion I don't believe Mark Michael is actually Jesus Christ to me he's a type of Christ like the Sun is a type of Christ the son that we say that we see today that came up this morning thank God and here's why you we have five scriptures about Michael three of them are in Daniel one's in Jude one's in Revelation now here's where here's where people might think Michael is Christ because brother Graham twice says Michael's Christ but he never says it in the seals and he never says it thus saith the Lord so like brother William and I were talking yesterday when a prophet says something you've got to make sure you know if it's his opinion or if it's God talking okay because every prophets a man every prophet makes mistakes but a prophet what makes them a prophet is that when they say thus saith the Lord or if they say in the name of the Lord that has to happen if it doesn't then that man wasn't a prophet okay so brother Brandon when he was talking about Michael he never said that's thus saith the Lord or in the name of the Lord that was just his opinion and he only said it twice so I personally don't think Michael is Christ I personally Michael is just an angel or an archangel now here's my reasons the book of Hebrews says an angel cannot be called a son Michael is called an archangel and will read the scriptures next so you can see it angels cannot be called sons they can't now to me this whole idea you know like let's say let's say another church or we believe Michaels Christ well that's fine I'm not going to argue about it I'm not going to with you I'm not going to disfellowship with you to me this issue of Michael is he Christ or not to me it's just a minor it's not a major a major is are you born again are you saved are you filled with the Holy Ghost are you being sanctified right I are you living the Word of God all the what the Word of God says but what are Michaels Christ or not that doesn't really impact our salvation okay personally and that I can see I personally can't see that and if I if I missing something and then you know my prayer lord help me to be humble open my eyes so I can see what I'm missing because I just want to know God's truth I just want to be humble with it so this is a minor to me not a major and to me it's not even a heresy like if someone says well Michaels Christ to me it's not even a heresy unless they take that really far okay and then they start praying to Michael or worshiping Michael now that's wrong now you've got heresy because now you've got idolatry like if you change your name when now we're the church of Michael the son of God well now that's see now you're getting into a little bit of heresy there now you're giving worship to an angel because the Bible just calls him an archangel okay now here's the scripture Michael's called one of the chief Prince's which is interesting like again we don't have a whole lot of so to me I've always wanted now this and my thought is Michael one of the two cherubims that covered the mercy seat maybe we know brother Brandon brother man makes it sound like Lucifer was like right there you know and the Bible said the Bible said Lucifer was the anointed cherub that covereth so it seems like Lucifer was one of those two angels that was right by the throne of God it was Michael the other one I don't know it seems like it to me it seems like it because there's a war in heaven and Michael kicks Lucifer out of heaven that's what it seems like to me because the Bible said Michael has angels under him okay so then Michael's called the prince he's called the Prince of the Jews which that's interesting too he's one of the treaty princes but he's a prince of the Jews so interesting Daniel 12:1 at that time shall Michael stand up that Great Prince which standeth for the children of thy people so it must be that Michael standing there before the prince of god and he's standing up maybe he's reporting about what's going on with the Jews in heaven now we know God knows all about it but God likes to give people purpose on the earth right he likes to give angels purpose in heaven right God doesn't have to have ministering spirits are you with me God doesn't have to have us he chooses to have us by His amazing grace he chooses to have angels he chooses to make us remember the Bible said in acts 7 God doesn't need us God doesn't need our buildings God doesn't need but he chooses to have us for his pleasure and we are to live for the pleasure of God and so the same thing Michael perhaps reports you know to the Father he reports about the Jewish people because he's standing for them thank God amen aren't you glad Jesus Christ is standing for you praise God I don't know if the Gentiles have a chief Prince or not but we've got the chief we've got the Prince of Peace amen hallelujah we've got the Son of God the king of kings lord of lords sitting for us amen glory and look they're gonna stay and he's gonna stand for them when they're delivered so there must be some type of intercession you know that Michael gives member just like Gabriel had or just like that was Michael that interceded for Daniel remember he interceded for Daniel's prayer where Daniel prayed in twenty days of the twenty-one days later God sent the answer praise the Lord and just another thought on this one we've read this a few times but the Bible did not say one of the Archangels so it just said the Archangel so I don't know it could be so in other words what I'm saying Michael may not be that angel right there I'm just saying I don't know but it seems like he is cuz he's called D Archangel and maybe that's because Satan is no longer an archangel I don't know he lost his position he left his first to stay i I don't know I'm just trying to show you what the scripture says and because remember there was war in heaven Michael and his angels so Michaels one of the chief Prince's he's an archangel he has angels that obey Him underneath him just like the military the pattern of leadership and authority he had he's the head angel and he has angels under him now here's another Michael may have a part in both the New Testament rapture and the deliverance of the hundred forty-four thousand Jews but I'm not sure because the Bible we just read it the Bible says for the Lord himself shall descend from heaven with a shout with the voice of the Archangel I don't know if Jesus you know he stands up and says Michael blow the trumpet yeah I don't know or Michael call forth the dead I don't know what's gonna happen but the Bible said the Bible says that the voice of the Archangel and then the Trump of God now for us that have heard the message we know the shout has already gone forth that's the message to wake everybody up and get their lamps trimmed get ready for the coming the marriage of Jesus the voice of the Archangel would be the raising of the dead in Christ just like there was angels you know when Christ raised from the dead there was angels right there it is - so hyper that's what I personally believe if you asked me if you wanted my opinion I'd say the voice of the Archangel must be Jesus you know maybe sending Michael down to earth when the dead in Christ rise I don't know what's the voice of an archangel of the Archangel by the way the Archangel so it looks like Michael so it could be I don't know for sure and then the Trump of God that's the last thing and that's where the bodies are changed the Bible says in first Corinthians 15 that the Trump of God shall sound and the the bodies will be swallowed up death to be swallowed up in life and our bodies will be changed in the moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump so see the last Trump is when we get our body change the voice of the Archangels the dead in Christ and the shout is getting everybody ready getting everybody ready now here's the two quotes just so you know once in 1955 where the Prophet said and at that time Michael shall stand up the Great Prince he says Michael was Christ of course who fought the angelic Wars in heaven with the devil it it's possible I don't know it's possible Christ the mystery of God revealed the Prophet said the first thing that Lucifer done to separate the fellowship of God man he want to build him a United Kingdom a greater splendor and seemingly more culture to greater Kingdom than Michael Christ had so it looks like it could have been Christ but here's the scripture where I just I just feel like this says that an angel cannot be called a son beings made so much better than the Angels as he hath by inheritance obtained a more excellent name than they for unto which of the Angels said he at any time thou art my son so the Paul saying you know when did God ever call an angel his son he never did so he had to create Christ who was made lower than the Angels he had to form a perfect body a sinless body in the womb of the Virgin Mary and again I'll be to him a father and he shall be to me a son and it says later in the chapter but to which of the Angels said he at any time sit on my right hand so God's not gonna have a right angel sit on his right hand it's gonna be his son this it's on his right hand until I make thine enemies thy footstool are they not all ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs now look see are they not all so he's saying all angels our ministering spirits sent forth to minister for them who shall be heirs of salvation so can believe whatever you want Church I love you no matter what but if you start worshipping Michael I might have to check you on that one we don't want to go I don't I don't believe we're taught to do that when we read the book of Revelation they're all worshiping the lamb they're all worth being Lord God Almighty Jesus Christ you know so I don't think anybody will go that way but I just want to say that I I just want to warn you people can get off and take Michael too far in fact there was a church in New York I'd know this for a fact because I talked to the pastor he went through it he had to correct them there's a church in New York not long ago that they said they said the voice of the Archangel was Michael okay and then they said that that voice was already sounding and they made their pastor the voice of the Archangel they made their pastor Michael and that has already happened in New York and of course you know the brother of on he tried to help them get corrected on it but they still consider their pastor is the voice of the Archangel so that's that's idolatry you know that's worship and they and they worship this man and they won't let anyone listen to any other tapes than what this man then this okay so I'm just telling you without the Holy Spirit people are gonna get off the track that's why we need the Holy Spirit to keep us humble to keep us in the Word of God not to add anything or take anything away okay so does that help for the first question and that helped by God's grace amen and if you know as always if there's any other questions see me after service or email me text me I certainly like questions you know the Bible says to grow and grace the knowledge of the Lord and that's what we should always be doing I always love learning more about Jesus because it always helps me out somehow in my life I can find somehow all praise the Lord this is so encouraging this will encourage me you know to go further with God and this will help me this is such a blessing it'll always help you out somehow make you be thankful make you make you worship make you love God more you know there's always whenever God reveals something there's always some blessing behind it amen here's the next question can a mentally ill person receive the Holy Ghost and there's more to the question a believer has been diagnosed with schizophrenia and bipolar disorder she's been burden her whole life with this the family suffers because of outbreaks of daily yelling cussing and physical altercations actually I forgot I forgot a slide but Mike wet my answer would be the person can be filled with the Holy Ghost before that happens I don't know how it could happen after because when that when that demon comes in or that spirit comes in it's a spirit of torment okay so it would have to happen before that's my understanding so let me show you some scriptures and quotes about this but I could be wrong like I said I'm open to be be corrected I'm willing to be corrected but I'll just show you what what I've heard brother BAM saying what the Bible says in demonology brother Branham says now the first thing what a demon is you hear so many talking about people talking about a demon now a demon a devil all comes from one word the English word it's called a tormentor a fellow that torments is a devil an evil one and we've all had them right we've all been around but we've got to overcome them with love we've got a love the Tormentor that's right a fellow that torments is the devil okay now the Bible today is so I'm sorry is to most to many people become so old back book that Grandma and Grandpa read or something like that there's not much to it's for the old folks and so for people say it but that's wrong it's for everybody and demons are tormentors that torment us now there's demons that comes into the soul of men now brother Branham means spirit okay so let me let me get back to this now before 1963 brother Branham had these three parts of man switched around and this is all in the Bible for those who don't know the Bible literally says we have three parts we have a soul spirit and body the Bible literally says that we have three parts and so before 1963 before God revealed it to him he thought the Spirit was the very core of a person but later he preached it and showed how the soul is actually the core of the person because the Bible says the sould sinneth it shall die the soul and we talked about 3,000 souls were saved on the day of Pentecost so it's the soul the spirit can go through good times the spirit can go through hard times you can have a broken spirit a wounded spirit a rejoicing spirit you can have a healed spirit this is our mind okay and so I just want everybody to see this before the person gets tormented with a like schizophrenia or any demon torment their soul can be sealed here but yet have no torment that can happen brother Branham tells us that that can happen okay but their spirit can go through torment and their body can go through torment remember when Jesus sweat drops of blood the Bible called that depression that was and there's no greater depression on we think we've been depressed right and we have right some of us been depressed but you've never been depressed where you sweat blood profusely so Jesus was tormented in his spirit how can I go to the cross how can I endure this huh and he prayed about it three times still sweat of depression sweat the blood drops a sweat of depression poured on his forehead in this none of us have been through that okay so none of us have been tormented like that but remember Jesus had this the Dove with the remember the Dove came down it ascended descended on his soul he was sealed but yet he went through this tremendous torment in his spirit and then in his body he was you know beaten and bruised and bloodied and stabbed with a spear and all crown of thorns he went through all this torment but they could never touch his soul and that's true for you and I Satan can do it God can make let Satan do whatever he wants in our body in our spirits but thank God our souls are sealed to the day of our Redemption thank God Satan can't touch your soul because the Bible said you're he's sealed out amen Christ is sealed in and he's sealed out the devil is sealed out of your soul he cannot change your destination hallelujah thank God for that so let me read the quote now there's demons that comes into that on this is the spirit this he means spirit of man because he change it later on I hope everybody understands it okay and the phraseology would be and I'd say that's the demon that comes into the spirit not so it's something that torments the spirit many times you can see a person maybe of insanity now they may be a converted person fill with the holy spirit and yet be totally insane that can happen you see that's right that has nothing to do with the soul or anything in this case yeah well in that case it's right it's a torment or something that torments them and brother William and I were talking about this yesterday you know think about all the hard things God let believers go through you know we just mentioned Jesus what about Elijah Elijah I'm sorry Lisha Eli sure did twice as many miracles Elijah but he died of an awful disease the Bible said God let that prophet die of a disease right God didn't heal him right yeah but God let him die and then God lets brother Branham die by getting hit by a drunk driver at a car accident right God let his own son die on a cross naked stripped bloodied and bruised and beaten and cut and blah God let his own son do that so we must understand is that God we that God has a plan and purpose for all of our lives and God may at some point someone made me feel with the Holy Ghost of the power of Jesus in their heart they love Christ they obey every word of God they see signs wonders and miracles they love the Lord Jesus butts later on in life God may allow them to go through a test a trial and one of them could be insanity we just have to understand that that God can allow that so again the soul can be sealed but then torment can be filling a person's mind it's very possible think about well think about this how many people have we known in the message that we believe or see what the Holy Ghost but then later on life they lost their minds Alzheimer's you name it you mean think about that think about all those you know situations that happen to people that doesn't impact their soul and thank God it doesn't amen thank God it doesn't but see God's allowing that for a test to the individual but also a test or trial for the family right to see how they going to love and care for their elderly loved ones or not you know it's a test it's it's it's a test for everyone this whole life is a great big test and we want to put a pass with an A+ by the blood of Christ but the only way we're gonna pass this would be studying studying up for the tests to know to have the Holy Spirit direct us to the answers for the tests because we don't know what's gonna be on the test all the time but we know we're gonna be tested and so that's what we have to do remember this testimony brother Brian was talking 1965 he said oh if we could only learn that that what part of the word we are see what what part of the word are we we must take our place no matter what it is amen but may have said I think of a little sister here in the wheelchair somehow sometime so bro there's a and this is in Arizona right this is impressed Scott there was a little girl in a wheelchair there that brother Brandon would see from time to time when he would come back and preach he said how many faithful prayers had been made over it he said but then we don't understand so he just committed to God so brother Branham would pray for this woman and pray for this little girl pray for and nothing what happened yet other people would be healed his wife would be healed of a tumor right blind eyes would open you know across my baby's eyes would go straight we have testimonies of all God doing all these things Tim Meyers wife's grandmother being healed of tuberculosis in 1951 and I met the woman she would die of tuberculosis and I brother Graham told her thus saith the Lord are gonna be healed and I met the woman God healed her of tuberculosis but then God lets a little baby a little little girl here sit in a wheelchair we got to find our place in the Word of God what place does God want us to play now look what brother Branham says she is a flower here among you Mahajan's with her pleasantness and everything see that we can get up and go around how she would longed to do that but yet she is pleasant just the way she sits I always get not depressed I always get inspired to watch the little lady because we all believe in healing we've seen God do americo's far beyond that and she knows that to see but she's willing to take her place they hate men in that beautiful she's willing if God doesn't want to heal me praise the Lord I'll praise God anyway now church it may be because of this I don't know why it may be on the day of judgment maybe she has to stand there and other people that were in wheelchairs will say well God you didn't heal me that's why I didn't serve you but God will bring her up and say well I Love You Lord no matter what even though you wouldn't heal me I still loved you and I accepted forgiveness for my sins and I serve you all the days of my life your grace was overflowing you gave me peace even during my lifetime even though you didn't hear me you gave me peace in my soul forgave all my sins and I didn't reject the cross and yet someone rejects the cross and all because what God would it heal me you see how God may have to do that someday we don't know we don't know and like I told somebody this week I said they say why can't see my children and I said well you need to go and see God and God will show you if not now God will show you eventually they were wondering is this because of my sins or is this a test the only way to know is you got to see God you've got to get down on your knees you got a fast and pray you've got to consecrate your life to Christ and you've got to call out to God for an answer who your answer you now or later but either way while you're caught up to God I believe he'll fill you with such love amen I believe he'll fill you with such confidence and peace and faith that no matter what he says you'll be grateful for his will anyway amen and so you know I always take this scripture to the Bible said we exhort you brethren warn them they're unruly people that don't do right things give them a warning but we're also to comfort the feeble-minded we're supposed to try to bring comfort to people and that actually means faint-hearted so this would maybe not be like someone with schizophrenia but but just someone who's always down and discouraged how can I make it through another week I don't know if I could Lord I just don't know if I can make it through another month I don't know if I can make it through another year well you know when is God gonna hear my prayer we're supposed to comfort them and say God is with you can I pray for you can I help you out anyway we're supposed to be the ones who provide comfort for those people and then the Bible said support the weak now this can definitely be a prompt lied to someone with schizophrenia or any disease we're supposed to provide support for the weak and then be patient toward all men huh me know that sickness brings patience I mean those that trials and and discouragement it builds patience in you you are forced to wait you don't have a choice God forces you in the Bible what Jesus said in patience possess your souls so it is while you're waiting and being patient Lord I just got it I'll just have to be patient have another choice that's when you're learning to possess salvation I know God will hear me I'm waiting he may not do it now but I'm learning patience and I'll wait on the Lord that's when you learn to really possess your salvation because in patience you possess your souls it's in that difficult time you know like I told you the story before God hear my momma cancer in the church and another woman in the church the very next year year after had the same cancer the same place and died and you know I just I sit there and cry like well god why did you heal my mom and not this other one I don't know it's up to God we've got to find our place in the Word of God we got to find what's the purpose of God for our lives and why doesn't why does this happen why we've got to trust God God is not the author of confusion God's the author of order praise God God is the author of understanding and and purpose and meaning God gives us meaning for all these things there's a meaning behind all of our suffering but we've got to be willing to seek God to find it I've got to humble ourselves remember the Bible said all contention comes from pride oh god you should not have done that that's pride oh god I know better than you this would have been better and we we can't say things like that we can't let things like that come out of our mouths we have to be humble and not prideful we got to be humble not arrogant now I do want to say this recently we had something happened the message a few years ago with mental illness you do have to use a lot of wisdom in 2000 January to 2016 Kenneth Janz a trustee and musician at Happy Valley Church of Jesus Christ in Tennessee was shot and killed by his daughter he was 77 I think now his daughter had experienced mental illness beginning at 45 years old so she lived a forty five years without any trouble and all of a sudden at 45 she had mental illness and ten years later she shot her father they would take her I read the articles online they interviewed the family and everything they would take her to institutions every time she had a flare-up you know every time she had a flare they would they would pray for her there just God you know placing your hands all these things she had grown children she had grown children now the courts ruled her insane but she didn't go to prison she went to a mental health facility what happened is that she had access to guns somehow she had access to guns I don't know if she knew the locks you know or the calm nations on the locks I don't know what happened but she had this spell she went through a spell where she thought her father had killed her son and her son called her that day and like no mom I'm fine I'm fine but she couldn't get out of her mind she was in one of those fits she took the gun and shot her dad and he was a musician in the trusty and and so you know I say all that to to say you know you got to have wisdom if you have some mental illness you know you got that you have to support the weak you have to be patient and you have to be very careful what they know and what they have access to okay does everyone understand that you just got to be very careful God may heal them God may not but we have to use wisdom and I remember I remember when that happened I was listening to a lot of the sermons at that time from Tennessee and it was a very very hard time no doubt very sad time but that's one thing that kind of hit home to me we got to be very careful with mental illness now brother Branham of course saw mental illness healed many times there's one case where there was a woman with five children and there's and remember she was so demon-possessed brother Graham tried to grab ahold of her and he had best had to rip his arm out of her grasp because she was so strong and she was making noises and all these things and the husband she sold everything on their farm almost to come see brother Brandon to see if they could get healed and he said brother Branham now he said no he said I don't know what I got I don't know what I'm gonna do so you just broke down crying and she's got five little children at home she's been a good woman she Harold these old clods and helped me to raise cotton crop so this woman was well for many years five children worked on the farm but when she taken sick I've done everything I could do I sold my farm in order to get here brother Branham I had one thing left a pair of mules I sold them this was in 1950 actually probably 1949 it's on tape I sold them to her brother to get her 200 miles to bring her here why now she's kicked the glass out of the car and her limbs are bleeding she hasn't been off her back for two years and don't even know her own name this is how serious it is and about that time she turned around and she said william branham you have nothing to do with me I brought her here so that was a demon speaking through this woman and I said and the father he said that's not her that's the devil speaking out of her that's right they recognize they know he said why brother brand that's the first word she spoken in two years so this woman hadn't talked for two years then all of a sudden she says you know William Branham I have nothing to do with you that's because he was a minister of the gospel and I said the devil just used her lips just like it was in the case of Legion in the days of Jesus she come crawling over to me that way and said you ain't got nothing to do with me crawling like that and I said brother do you believe this story that you heard me tell about the coming of that angel and he said with all my heart as he threw his arms around me I walked to the corner of the step and I prayed with all my heart to Lord Jesus so she's down in the basement he just walks over to the last step and prays for he doesn't even lay hands on her he just praised her because that's wisdom right she would have killed him so there's wisdom right you got we have to use wisdom with people with mental illnesses and I said God look at that poor woman five little innocent children at home no mother one suckling baby I said what can happen Oh God have mercy and the Spirit of the Lord came and I asked the devil to leave the woman I turned back around I said now do you believe it he said with all my heart what should I do with her brother Branham I said take her back so they didn't see a healing immediately but Graham said take her back take her right on back to the sanatorium or the institution in the facility and I said if you don't doubt one thing that I told you watch what will happen so see he had to believe - that's what Jesus said be done to you according to your faith we've got to believe the promise of God and though it's hard but we got to believe it and faith always get the victory over unbelief two months after that I was in Jonesboro Arkansas where there's many things was happening some 28,000 people gathered in the city and I was speaking pressing or waving their hands at me some woman and she said don't you recognize me brother Branham I said no ma'am I said you all of you excuse me she said I just wanted to see you I seen somebody laughing there it was her husband and there she was sitting there just as normal in her right mind with her five little children just as perfect as she could be but BAM said see they taken her back you know so they drugged her back in this car that had the windows kicked out because she was so demon-possessed but she never kicked the car one time going back to see God was giving her a little bit of healing a little bit of healing a little more victory as the time went on they put her back in the padded cell the second morning they went in to feed her she was setting up so not laying on the floor now she's up and on the fourth and third or fourth morning they dismissed her as a well person and sent her home to her children Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen thank God for that praise the Lord yeah God his God is so merciful so whatever way Jesus wants to heal someone we just have to be sensitive to what he's leading us to do okay I can't think of a now my life I don't think I've anyone seen anyone healed of mental illness although I have seen God bring out numerous people out of depression so much more when I tried to pray for them they would fight and kick and eventually God brought them out of that by the grace of the Lord that's happened numerous times on numerous occasions where God is I prayed over people and God has cast out the demons that's happened numerous times before I've seen that so in this case that's what I'd say I would say support this person love them because patient as you possibly can with them and maybe pray about having a minister come over to the house to pray for the person or try to bring the person to a service but make sure you're ready if that devil flares up make sure you're ready to use wisdom so that person doesn't hurt somebody else you just have to use wisdom and you have to say God leading me and guiding me I don't want to put anybody else in danger but we desire healing and so with this person with brother branham she didn't even make it to the meeting she just stayed in the basement the whole time she couldn't even go in the service but brother Graham we got as close as she could and just prayed and asked for God's grace and God chose the healer like we know the woman the little girl in the wheelchair God didn't heal her but she still loved the Lord Jesus with all her heart so I hope that helps by the grace of Lord that's that's what I can find out about mental illness it's a spirit it's a demon spirit that's entered someone's mind tormenting them and somehow God has allowed it and we have to ask for God's wisdom to how to handle that whether God's going to heal them or not okay I got two more by God's grace all right good that's a good question I've never heard this question before why does the Bible mention the Book of Enoch if it's not inspired that's a good question did Christians write the Book of Enoch those are all good questions really good questions now the answer to me I believe the Book of Enoch actually copied the book of Jude and not vice versa so I I don't believe the Book of Enoch is inspired and here's why but try not to jump ahead of me I know we long program to read but people say oh anak wrote The Book of Enoch so we should make that part of the Bible very few people believe that okay very few but the argument is there's a passage in the Book of Enoch that says the Lord will come with 10,000 of his Saints that's in the Book of Enoch you can see it online okay and that same phrase is in Jude verses 14 and 15 so people say well see Jude copied off of Enoch but I don't believe that I believe Jude's writing was before the Book of Enoch and I believe someone impersonated the book someone impersonated Enoch and wrote their own book and this is why because okay well before that here it is we don't need the Book of Enoch to determine that Enoch was a seventh from Adam we don't need that because we only need Genesis 5 verse 1 to 24 for that so also in the Book of Enoch it says he's for the seventh from Adam but we don't even need that because that started in the book of Genesis here's the reason I don't believe in it the Book of Enoch supports angels fathering children let's go to Genesis 6 some people might not know about this but it's a popular doctrine among some people that believe in angels can turn into humans it's not there's nothing in the Bible about that Genesis 6 verse 1 and it came to men began to multiply on the face of the earth the daughters were born of unto them that the sons of God saw the daughters of men that they were fair and they chose them lives of all which they chose and the Lord said my spirit shall not always strive with man for that he also is flesh yet his day should be one hundred and twenty years there were giants in the earth in those days and also after that when the sons of God came in unto the daughters of men and they bare children to them and the same became mighty men which were of old men of renown okay so people read this text and they'll say oh see the the sons of God were angels that came down and they they married daughters of men and now we have Giants that's that's wrong that you you cannot do that and program tells us why if you allow that then you have Satan is now a creator because now Satan can combine with humanity and create a different offspring that God didn't create no Giants are just a difference in the DNA pool that's all Giants are like you have Manute Bol you know he was about seven seven you have yo Ming that NBA player he's almost 8 feet tall you know that's just in the gene pool ok you cannot make Satan a creator that would make him equal with God and he's not equal with God the Bible said there's only one creator there's only one wise all-powerful God so angels cannot mate with humans is impossible they they they're the Bible said they're spirits and we are flesh okay and you cannot do that so the sons of God were actually the descendants of Seth they're thus the sentence of Seth that married daughters of men or women who are not believers in Jehovah and after that then you started getting giants okay it's a it's a mixture of the DNA pool okay now here's where Bob Arum says it he said a doctor DeHaan takes Josephus his stand and say that they pressed themselves the angels press themselves into human flesh and taking on them wives and there were giants in the Land of Nod and they had taken them to themselves wives and live with them when the sons of God the Fallen Angels taken and seen the daughters of men and the sex desire was such a great thing and yet them being sinful from falling they pressed themselves in the human flesh that's what that Josephus believes as well apparently if they do that they'd spoil divine healing they'd spoil everything else if the devil can you because Satan's not a creator he doesn't have power power like that he does have power but not that kind of power he cannot create he only perverts what has been created he is no creator he's only a pervert err okay that's an excellent question but I think here's what I think happened I think I mean the Book of Enoch could have been written by someone before the time of Jude you know it could have been but either way I just believe Satan used that Book of Enoch as a distraction to try to pull people away from believing the truth of God's Word and especially serpents eat right because this ties in a lot with serpents eat because what happened was Satan entered into a human body I'm sorry a body that was like human which was a serpent seduced Eve right and then produced a serpent seed Cain who is of his father the devil the Bible says and that produced more DNA trouble I would say like that more of a mixture of DNA trouble right okay a fallen man polluted the polluted DNA pool the gene pool that's polluted so that's what and this is this causes distraction that's what the Nephilim that's this is called the Nephilim doctrine where angels can mate with humans that's why that's wrong it's just the perversion it's a distraction and it's off the Word of God so if anybody said anything about now I haven't read The Book of Enoch but there's like four sections the first section is about that and the second one is about all his heavenly visions so I imagine if we open that up we probably find some other things that were false you know things like that so right away we know according to the first chapter of the Book of Enoch we know it was a false work and it's not inspired of the Word of God okay so a great question there that was a wonderful question okay last question and if my Hauer i got six minutes and my hours done and save a tough one for the last one I had this question I think this is a great question what are your thoughts about mixed marriages so like white marrying black black marrying white I preached this before but I just want everyone to know the reason this is a question is because brother Branham lived in the before civil rights and he lived during the Jim Crow laws and the reason this is a question the message is because brother Branham just believed they should have always stayed separate he you know as far as marriages he always thought blacks should just marry black-white marry white and so forth like that and he was very heart he was very firm and harsh about it brother Graham called it a pitiful thing if a white and black married you know he called it he was pretty harsh with it now for me though I I I don't I don't go that harsh myself and he's the man he's allowed to have his own opinion I I believe brother ban was a prophet I respect him as a prophet but program taught us everything you believe take it back to the Bible okay and then one there's one case of a William and I were talking mother yesterday brother Branham said if Martin Luther King Jr's not careful he's gonna lead millions of african-americans to a riot he called it a riot where they'd be slaughtered like let's say if the black people rose up for their civil rights and there was such a big crowd of them that you know brother BAM thought they might have a riot now they never did but he thought and brother Adam said this he thought Martin Luther King jr. is leading them to a death trap and there's going to be millions of them killed in riots that was his opinion they asked him later and he said brother Branham was that thus saith the Lord and he said of course not he said that just my own opinion about it he said I could be totally wrong he said I have nothing on the Lord from that he said but if I get something on the Lord front for him from it he said it'll speak it it'll say thus saith the Lord so we got to let brother Branham be a man okay and we may have little differences with things now 99% of what he said we all agree with but this is one where I you know I'm not that harsh with it now personally let me say this I believe it's best for white to marry white black to marry black Asian to marry Asian you name it east to marry east you know West to marry West you know you you name it I I believe that's the best thing to do but there are examples in the Bible where God put people to and they were not the same race and so I'm brother branham even admits this in numerous quote it's almost like he recognized it but maybe just never brought it down to a teaching but he never taught on it because it wasn't a doctrine you know it wasn't a major doctrine ok so let me read a few quotes here let me just give you a quick examples the most obvious example is with Moses and Zipporah Moses was a Hebrew man and if you look at the Hebrews today they're dark but they're not that dark if you look at a Theo pian they're pretty dark so God had Moses you know he of course Moses did it itself not God but Moses ran from Egypt because he murdered him a man and God had him marry Zipporah and Ethiopian a black woman right and and he's darker maybe he's brownish you know but he marries a black woman right and and brother Branham said well the Bible says this as well that Moses his siblings made fun of him because he married an Ethiopian that's in numbers the Book of Numbers I believe it's chapter 18 if I'm not mistaken Miriam makes fun of him and Aaron makes fun of him and God said aren't you afraid to speak against my servant so they weren't giving him respect for his wife in his marriage and God smote Miriam with leprosy and she got healed but died shortly after that for making fun of Moses's wife and brother Bram said that was sapore was mote was God's choice for Moses God chose the poor and Church of you know your Bible the poorest saved God's light I'm sorry the poor say Moses his life the angel was coming to kill Moses because he didn't circumcise his two sons and sapore circumcise him with a razor through the foreskins down and said you've been a bloody husband to me and brother Bram said the poorest saved Moses life because he got so busy with the ministry he forgot to circumcise his own sons so our absolute like program I said is the Bible and of course the Bible is brother Graham's absolute as well but he was a man he wasn't perfect he's not God we don't worship Him he was a prophet he foretold the future right we know what's gonna happen we know according to Scripture he taught the Bible he finished the mysteries of God amen glory and we know that because everything he taught was from the Bible with these mysteries and prophecies it's all from the Bible but in this case this is just one of his ideas and I can I can see the principle behind it okay because like in nature high breeding or intermingling it's not always a good thing they're getting so smart now or you know they can actually bypass with food and actually make it kind of good you know they they can do some things now they're getting pretty smart but at the beginning you couldn't do that because they weren't smart enough but the point is like reproduces with like and God loves variety God loves a man's dark skinned God loves a woman's pale skin God loves the tan skin God God loves the variety just like he loves a variety of flowers and nature and everything like that God loves a variety and I think it's best like the Bible you know like I believe that it's best to marry within your race if at all possible but there's going to be times when you can't or there's gonna be times where God is leading you outside of that okay so the example the best example is Moses and Zipporah the second one was Joseph and his Gentile wife probably Egyptian and they were the biggest heathens of all of them right God gave Joseph in Egypt a Gentile wife but vamsa noticed when Joseph rejected by his brother and he was given a gentle wife Pharaoh gave him a Gentile wife he bored Gentile children half Jew half Gentile so if you're getting technical he had hybrid children like if you're getting I don't think that's the right thing to say but just so we can understand it he had mixed children okay the beautiful example is Boaz and Ruth Ruth was a Moabite as' and most of the Moabite is's our mobitz were under the curse of God because they didn't help out Moses on his way back to eat Israel most them but God of all the people to get Boaz a wife who's eventually gonna have Obed Obed Jesse Jesse David David down to Christ of all people he chooses a Moabite woman Ruth and brings a Moabite totally Gentile totally heathen under the curses of God he brings her out from under curse and brings her into the fold and now her name and her sons names are in the very lineage of God's own son Jesus Christ so what am I saying I'm saying we should use the wisdom of God we must find the leadership of the Holy Ghost from who you're gonna marry right and God can save a mixed person right we know that remember Timothy he was a mixture and a Greek father and a Jewish mother and Paul thought so much of him he said that's my son in the gospel and I can trust the Corinth the Corinthians I can I can put the Corinthians in the hand of Timothy and Timothy will teach them everything I've I've taught because Timothy is born again and he's my son in the gospel to see it you know like me my mom was fully Indian Spanish you name it you know American I can show you the percentages if you want I just can't remember them right now you know Native American I'm off my dad is 30% great Great Britain you know so I'm kind of a Brit you know I guess that royal wedding you know I got a connection there I don't know it's so silly but I'm thirty percent in Great Britain in my blood you know so anyways I'm a mixed and you know so if I didn't understand this I well I got a got to marry a mixed you know but God sent me a great wife high school sweetheart you know like it's God place that God has to place it together so God will lead you on who to marry but you shouldn't like for example like people shouldn't get mad and say well I don't like what brother Branham said so I'm black I'm gonna go marry a white man or I'm white and I'm gonna go marry I'm black that's that's the wrong attitude you know if you just don't agree with someone just be kind about disagreeing with them right above all what a Peter say above all try to be smarter than everybody know above all have fervent charity one to another love jesus said you'll know they're my disciples by God's grace at Bride of Christ fellowship because they love you have one for another how we treat each other that's how he's supposed to know we're Christians visitors like our brother Jason he should watch and I hope by God's grace that he sees us love each other after service got any fights scheduled for after service I hope not I hope not we should have love we should care for each other you know when someone's hurting we should try to encourage them strengthen them support them pray for them we should do all we can we should be real Christians here because it's love and so that's where I stand on it I believe the main thing though when you get married is to marry someone who believes in Jesus Christ the same way you do that's the main thing brother I said under no circumstance should I believe or marry an unbeliever under no circumstances never because then you're then you're mixing your mixing faith versus unbelief you know we cannot do that the scripture says in secondly in 6 that we we should be unequally yoked or sure we should not be unequally yoked right we should be equally yoked together in other words you have a burden for the gospel I have a burden for the gospel let's let's plow these fields for the Lord let's work till Jesus comes you and I work together we'll be in perfect harmony amen that's what we should do by the grace of the Lord let me I'm just flipping through any of these last thoughts I wrote down here and you know I don't think we've ever had any any issues with this but it is a great question I know some people and when I got the question yesterday it was a video of a preacher and some people take a really hard stance on it some people don't take any stance at all but I just try to I just try to stay right in the middle I think if you follow God's will for your life and marry the person God wants you to marry no matter what skin color they are I think God will accept you because God is the one that led you to do that if you go against the Word of God and you don't obey the Holy Spirit and don't marry the right person I think there might be some consequences to that it all depends on if you follow the leadership of the Holy Spirit all right any other scriptures I think that's it let's stay on our feet by the gray yeah I think that's interesting really great question let's give those questions around pause I like those questions by the grace of Leigh I appreciate that I appreciate questions like I said if I can be a help to anybody we surely want to do that and I know I may be I forgot some things or if I miss anything you know let me know by the grace of Lord we're just trying to rightly divide the word of truth that's what a preacher is called to do you know rightly divide it and place it as a sacrifice unto the Lord that God would be pleased with our sacrifice and our offering amen that's just bow our heads here for a prayer by the grace of the Lord Heavenly Father we love you Lord God we thank you for your word Lord we know your word is our absolute dear God it's the last say it's our foundation our cornerstone the keystone of our lives father were grateful for the questions
