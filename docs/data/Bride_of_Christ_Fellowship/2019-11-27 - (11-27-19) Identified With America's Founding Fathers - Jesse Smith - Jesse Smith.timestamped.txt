[37:06] Raisa let's take our Bibles here tonight
[37:09] this was a Psalm chapter 33 I'd like to
[37:13] continue looking at American history
[37:15] by God's grace I like to title this
[37:18] identified with America's founding
[37:20] fathers start to look at some of the
[37:22] founding fathers and their testimonies
[37:24] tonight Psalms 33 look at verse 11
[37:31] Psalms 33 11 on Sunday we looked at
[37:41] proverbs 14 that righteousness exalts a
[37:44] nation so we have a great idea why some
[37:49] nations are exalted and other nations
[37:51] are not it's because those that are
[37:54] exalted have kept the way of the Lord
[37:56] praise God and God's blessings lasts
[38:00] from generation to generation to
[38:02] generation praise God hallelujah
[38:05] proverbs 33 verse 11
[38:12] actually let's read verse eight though I
[38:14] would like to read that I saw that
[38:16] earlier and I thought that'd be good
[38:18] scripture to read as well by God's grace
[38:21] Psalms 33 8 let all the earth fear the
[38:25] Lord that all the inhabitants of the
[38:27] world stand in awe of him are we
[38:30] standing in awe of him tonight praise
[38:31] God that's why we're standing because we
[38:33] know how great God is tonight let's go
[38:38] down to verse 11 the counsel of the Lord
[38:40] stands forever
[38:42] the thoughts of his heart to all
[38:45] generations let's all read verse 12
[38:48] together Psalm 33:12 thank you three two
[38:56] on three one two three blessed is the
[39:00] nation whose God is the Lord and the
[39:04] people whom he hath chosen for his own
[39:06] inheritance praise God aren't you glad
[39:09] he chose you praise God he didn't have
[39:12] to but he chose you he knew you choose
[39:14] him for he's God he can't force you to
[39:17] serve Him that's how we're to pray let's
[39:19] bow our heads here tonight
[39:20] you haven't eaten on your heart just
[39:22] making known unto the Lord here
[39:23] how many father Lord we're happy to be
[39:25] in your house tonight on this pray Lord
[39:27] God and worship you and I pray God your
[39:29] truth would be preached your people
[39:31] would receive it they'd be fed their
[39:33] spiritual portion of spiritual manna
[39:36] Lord God for for tonight's service as we
[39:38] head into the holidays may we truly have
[39:40] the spirit of Thanksgiving which is the
[39:42] holy spirit dear God to be thankful for
[39:45] all the blessings that you've graciously
[39:48] bestowed upon us Lord God we don't
[39:51] deserve it but Lord we're grateful for
[39:53] our our forefathers or those in this
[39:56] nation who have laid the groundwork and
[39:58] sacrificed so much that we can enjoy
[40:01] your blessings and help us to continue
[40:03] to live righteously that we pass it on
[40:05] to Lydia's generation Malachi generation
[40:09] and nature's and virtues and Eden's and
[40:11] this next generation James and Lily Lord
[40:14] will pass on how we know the Lord is
[40:17] real and the testimonies that we've seen
[40:19] God do pass it on that right
[40:22] Lord can be lived out again it should
[40:26] there be another generation dear God
[40:28] granite Lord God and let us live
[40:29] righteously as we sing that song let us
[40:32] be a generation that seeks your face
[40:33] those of us who are adults those of us
[40:36] who are older and more mature and know
[40:38] better help us to seek your face O God
[40:40] for Lord we must seek you in a day you
[40:42] can be found and help us tonight as we
[40:45] preach your word help us to receive it
[40:46] and preach it and live it for your glory
[40:48] in Jesus Christ's name and the church
[40:50] said Amen god bless you being seated
[40:53] praise God so Lord willing we'll be
[41:00] looking at these thoughts here tonight
[41:03] by God's grace Lydia I'm sorry case you
[41:12] can switch over here I'm gonna try to
[41:16] show a visual here it's called the
[41:21] liberty matrix and I'll talk about this
[41:23] in just a moment here I'm pulling from
[41:28] three different references for this
[41:30] little series actually for one of them I
[41:33] read at school Sunday we looked at
[41:36] identified with the pilgrims and trust
[41:38] that was a blessing to you by God's
[41:39] grace I'm holding from a source this
[41:45] book is a good source on shaping history
[41:47] through prayer and fasting I'm pulling
[41:48] from this one I'm pulling from a
[41:50] documentary by Kirk Cameron called
[41:52] monumental and that's what this one's
[41:53] about this is not from that video but
[41:56] it's a picture describing the monument
[41:58] and then I'm pulling from another video
[42:01] I watched by David Barton he's the the
[42:06] leader of the ministry called wall
[42:08] builders he has over a thousand
[42:10] documents of the early American fathers
[42:13] like the literal real documents books
[42:16] the letters they wrote books books that
[42:19] they printed he's one of the largest
[42:21] collectors of American artifacts and
[42:25] then I'm pulling from a few facts from a
[42:26] book I read at school too
[42:28] about the pilgrims so praise God today
[42:31] let's just remember that quote I kind of
[42:33] started Sunday morning with
[42:36] the RAM said I was identified with them
[42:40] at he says at Plymouth Rock when they
[42:43] landed on Plymouth Rock I was with them
[42:46] so was you everybody praise God he said
[42:51] I was right there on Valley Forge I
[42:53] crossed the icy Delaware with a bunch of
[42:55] soldiers I prayed all night with George
[42:57] Washington I crossed the Delaware with a
[43:01] vision in my heart we are American he
[43:05] said I rang the Liberty Bell the first
[43:07] July 4th 1776 I rang the Liberty Bell
[43:11] here and declared that we are
[43:13] independent to be a real American I had
[43:16] to I was identified with her in the
[43:20] Revolutionary so that's what we look at
[43:22] today by God's grace so we'll look at
[43:31] our text again the Bible says blessed is
[43:34] the nation whose God is the Lord and the
[43:37] people whom he has chosen for his
[43:39] inheritance you know recently somebody
[43:41] emailed me about from Africa and emailed
[43:44] me about the condition of his country
[43:45] and I didn't know what to say I didn't
[43:48] know the history of how his country had
[43:50] treated the gospel but I do believe I
[43:53] shared this scripture if I wasn't if I'm
[43:55] not for not for I'm not mistaken that
[43:57] God honors every nation that fears him
[44:00] praise God
[44:01] look at Israel how many times have they
[44:04] tried to wipe them off the map over the
[44:07] last 6,000 years they've just tried each
[44:09] country you know Germany and Russia and
[44:12] different ones have tried to to wipe
[44:14] them off the map right Iran and Saudi
[44:16] Arabia and Iraq different kind of Syria
[44:18] all the nations have tried to wipe them
[44:20] off the map but they can't get rid of
[44:22] them because there's a small group of
[44:24] believers and God is faithful any nation
[44:28] that honors God in righteousness and
[44:31] teaches righteousness God will defend
[44:33] them although they had to suffer you
[44:35] know the Jews for crucifying Jesus
[44:37] Christ he said let the blood be upon us
[44:39] in our children God never forsakes them
[44:41] because they're part of Abraham's
[44:43] natural seed and we know there's a small
[44:46] remnant in there of about 144,000
[44:49] that's gonna receive the baptism of the
[44:50] Holy Ghost amen so there's a small group
[44:54] there's a little group and that's
[44:55] raising up now I imagine as we as we as
[44:58] we speak and as we preach it's
[44:59] increasing by the maybe the by the tens
[45:01] and the maybe the 20s and 50s year after
[45:05] year just increasing until pretty soon
[45:07] they're gonna have a hundred forty-four
[45:08] thousand that will fully believe the
[45:11] Word of God and of course they'll get
[45:13] the Holy Ghost after the rapture but we
[45:16] look here and see that blessed is a
[45:18] nation whose God is the Lord and
[45:20] righteousness exalts a nation we saw on
[45:25] Sunday how there's never been a nation
[45:26] as prosperous as United States of
[45:29] America and even so to this day you know
[45:32] recently last week the stock market
[45:35] reached its highest level ever
[45:36] so that means prosperity is happening
[45:39] businesses are growing here in America
[45:42] still to this day now of course we know
[45:44] her national debt is I think past twenty
[45:47] trillion if I'm not mistaken so it's a
[45:51] false sense of prosperity but
[45:53] nevertheless the businesses are growing
[45:54] and they're expanding and people are
[45:56] hiring and so we still see traces of
[45:59] this prosperity although we know our
[46:03] doom is eminent we know brother Branham
[46:06] said thus saith the Lord the very god
[46:09] that America claims to serve will
[46:11] destroy her but we know God will never
[46:13] destroy the righteous with the wicked
[46:15] and as long as there's god-fearing
[46:17] people here that are praying on their
[46:19] knees that are reading their Bibles that
[46:21] are singing and worshiping God in spirit
[46:24] and truth God will not let them be
[46:26] destroyed with the wicked amen
[46:28] so thank God for that praise God that we
[46:31] have that hope that God is going to
[46:33] spare all of us praise God that love the
[46:36] Lord no matter what church no matter
[46:37] what state no matter where you are God
[46:40] will be with those who fear Him and God
[46:42] is watching over his people praise God
[46:45] so I'm thankful he's watching over me
[46:47] tonight hallelujah but we are identified
[46:49] with America's founding fathers now
[46:53] around it this this monument I'll read a
[46:57] little bit out of it here a little bit I
[46:59] want to give us some background on it
[47:02] and I'm just gonna read off it if you
[47:04] could I'm not gonna zoom in so that
[47:06] because then you couldn't see it real
[47:07] well but this is a nearly forgotten
[47:10] monument to the forefathers and it
[47:13] actually is a hunt it's 81 feet tall so
[47:18] it's about four storeys tall and it's
[47:21] about 180 tons and some say it's the
[47:25] world's largest solid granite monument
[47:29] so as one piece of granite massive piece
[47:32] and it took 70 years to chisel out these
[47:37] statues in it and all the words 70 years
[47:40] okay it was dedicated in 1889 that means
[47:47] even before the Civil War they started
[47:50] working on this right before the Civil
[47:53] War they found one huge chunk of granite
[47:56] and this was like I say a hundred some
[47:59] years after the pilgrims had died
[48:02] Americans wanted a way to remember how
[48:06] this country started and they wanted
[48:09] they went to all the future generations
[48:11] to remember how was this country blessed
[48:15] why is this country so prosperous and
[48:18] even after the war of 1812
[48:21] remember that war 1812 it started
[48:23] shortly after that so they had seen my
[48:25] we got victory over the British we got
[48:27] victory over the French we got all these
[48:29] victories how did this happen and the
[48:32] founding fathers knew it wasn't because
[48:34] they were smarter wasn't because they
[48:36] were stronger wasn't because they were
[48:37] better at war it was because God
[48:41] favoured them because they love God's
[48:43] Word amen praise God and so they thought
[48:48] nah how can we make a blueprint to
[48:51] remind future generations on how this
[48:55] country came to be so successful came to
[48:58] be so prosperous what can we do so they
[49:01] voted and spent all this money and over
[49:04] 70 years of chiseling away one one one
[49:09] stone at a time praise God and I'll say
[49:12] I just making this masterpiece praise
[49:14] God
[49:15] hey hey man idea this masterpiece and
[49:18] it's called the matrix of Liberty so the
[49:22] whole point of this is to show how a
[49:26] nation can give true Liberty to the
[49:29] people praise God how a nation can be
[49:32] truly free now think about all the other
[49:35] nations that had slavery now we had
[49:37] slavery for a while but it got
[49:38] eventually got outlawed by Abraham
[49:40] Lincoln praise the Lord and he lived
[49:42] during the time this was being built
[49:44] of course he died before it was finished
[49:45] because he died in 1865 and this wasn't
[49:48] dedicated until 1889 about 30 years 33
[49:52] years afterwards so this was a great
[49:59] thing and Thomas Jefferson said there's
[50:02] a quote down here it's hard for you to
[50:04] read but it says the price of freedom is
[50:06] eternal vigilance so of course we know
[50:09] vigilance deals with dedication and
[50:11] diligence and watchfulness so if you
[50:14] want freedom if you want true Liberty
[50:17] you've got to be watchful you have to
[50:19] watch and pray
[50:20] you have to stay watchful and make sure
[50:23] the enemy doesn't overtake you praise
[50:25] God that's what we're saying today we're
[50:28] not just talking about the United States
[50:31] of America we're talking about the bride
[50:33] of Jesus Christ amen
[50:35] the Bible says Paul says we must keep a
[50:38] watch for the enemy Satan I'm sorry
[50:41] that's Peter I'm sorry yeah Peter says
[50:44] Satan goes around like a roaring lion
[50:46] seeking Him whom he may devour praise
[50:50] God and so we must be cautious at all
[50:52] times how Satan is trying to distract us
[50:55] praise God from spiritual things if ever
[50:59] need to be spiritual it's now praise the
[51:02] Lord if ever we need to watch and make
[51:04] sure we don't fall away spiritually or
[51:06] get loose in our spiritual life it must
[51:08] be now we must watch now we must pay the
[51:11] price in order to be right with God in
[51:16] order to be on fire with God you've got
[51:18] to pay the price and that's called
[51:20] diligence and I said it he knocks name
[51:23] actually means dedicate I think I said
[51:24] it meant something different on Sunday I
[51:27] think I said it
[51:29] discipline but it means dedicated but
[51:31] she had the same idea
[51:32] Enoch was a man dedicated to Christ for
[51:35] his day right the Holy Spirit the
[51:37] anointing and so after the pilgrims
[51:42] established over their colonies pretty
[51:44] soon you had colonies pretty soon then
[51:46] you had States and after the government
[51:50] had been established they built this
[51:53] monument and it was a just a beautiful
[51:57] memory here of of how to establish a
[52:02] godly nation so you think how come how
[52:05] come how come different countries like
[52:08] we say in South America or Africa or
[52:10] Europe how come they're not blessed or
[52:13] how come they don't have any blessings
[52:15] in their in their countries many times
[52:17] it's because they've disrespected God's
[52:20] Word they've turned it down they've
[52:22] they've shut the mouths of preachers
[52:24] right now it's difficult to it let me
[52:26] say this too it's difficult because
[52:28] there's many Middle Eastern countries
[52:30] that are seemingly prosperous right
[52:32] because they have oil and they have
[52:35] different natural resources but that's
[52:37] just the leaders if you look at just the
[52:39] regular people a lot of them are in
[52:41] poverty and a lot of them are being
[52:45] persecuted right and they're being
[52:47] they're being ruled over by tyrants so
[52:50] what this shows is that Satan controls
[52:53] every Kingdom right same controls every
[52:55] government but the majority of the
[52:57] people will be live under freedom and
[52:59] liberty when righteousness is is
[53:02] established by the leaders praise God
[53:05] and so that's why America has stood well
[53:07] for so long brother Branham said
[53:11] remember in nineteen had it's a revival
[53:14] member in 1906 at Azusa Street but then
[53:18] they turned that revival turn to the
[53:20] next revival down the 50 year jubilee in
[53:23] 1956 but ma'am said they turned it down
[53:25] so see America was blessed it was a
[53:28] Christian nation for a long time but
[53:30] somewhere after 1906 they turned down
[53:33] the revival right and then they started
[53:36] turning it down and then finally they
[53:37] had one last chance fifty years later
[53:39] and they turned it down
[53:42] and they'll never go back and so we've
[53:44] seen just recently it's been a time
[53:47] where the nation has turned its back on
[53:50] God right but see we're still enjoying
[53:53] blessings because the previous
[53:55] generation like brother Ram generation
[53:57] the one before that they live godly
[53:59] right and the generation before us live
[54:02] godly and so we're still reaping the
[54:05] benefits God still has to honor all the
[54:09] generations all the prayers of all the
[54:11] previous generations and church if God
[54:14] honor them that God will honor our
[54:15] prayers for the next generation praise
[54:18] God but but we've got to be just as
[54:20] faithful as the previous generation was
[54:22] praise God and you're gonna see Church
[54:25] this is a challenge to us when we go
[54:27] through some of these things tonight
[54:28] it's a challenge to us because they had
[54:31] a lot more prayer and fasting maybe than
[54:33] we do praise God as we've got to realize
[54:35] if we're gonna be a generation that
[54:37] seeks after God we've got to be more
[54:39] willing to sacrifice more of our time
[54:41] and more of our food and more of our
[54:43] American privileges in order to get the
[54:45] spiritual privileges of Christianity I
[54:48] know that's not popular but listen
[54:51] that's the Laodicea that's the age we're
[54:52] living in praise God
[54:54] but you and I believe God is helping me
[54:56] in my life but if it hasn't happened in
[54:58] your life your life needs to have a
[55:00] pattern of prayer and fasting if you're
[55:03] not constantly prayer and fasting then
[55:06] you're not truly reaching the level of a
[55:09] disciple that you could be Jesus didn't
[55:11] say if you want to fast he said when you
[55:14] fast Jesus say if you might pray he said
[55:17] when you pray any true disciple of Jesus
[55:21] Christ Jesus said when I leave then will
[55:23] my servants fast and that's what this
[55:26] book devotes a couple chapters to it
[55:28] devotes chapters are showing how real
[55:30] Christians fast real Christians realize
[55:33] we have so many natural benefits we've
[55:35] got a we got to get our eyes off the
[55:38] natural benefits and we got to look to
[55:40] heaven for spiritual benefits and that
[55:42] means starving our flesh sometimes and
[55:44] then feeding on spiritual things
[55:46] praise God now that won't get me a big
[55:49] church that won't get me a big amen but
[55:52] it will get me a good amen from the
[55:53] Angels praise God
[55:55] how do you thank the Lord amen so I know
[55:58] if not many people are behind me are on
[56:01] the internet or not many of people are
[56:02] behind me in my my town or anything like
[56:05] that I know one thing I know heavens
[56:08] behind me praise God because I got the
[56:10] word of the Lord praise God amen we have
[56:13] the word of the Lord thank God for that
[56:17] now this is the pattern on how to
[56:23] develop a godly country so let me go
[56:28] ahead and read a little bit about this
[56:30] and I probably see if I can zoom in here
[56:32] let me see if I can maybe there's
[56:34] different parts I can zoom into I think
[56:36] I should be able to yeah all right well
[56:40] that's why I didn't want to do that's
[56:42] why I've got to try to be careful here
[56:45] so it's a four story tall monument and
[56:49] this is 81 feet itself it's pretty
[56:53] massive just this lady faith now there's
[56:58] four human characters on towards the
[57:01] bottom but there's one character at the
[57:03] top and so all this one character we'd
[57:08] say is the most important of all of them
[57:10] and this is how the pilgrims bill
[57:14] America the very top of it is faith so
[57:18] they you can see faith right there
[57:20] so faith is the very first thing it's
[57:23] the first thing you see is this high
[57:24] faith faith is exalted right amen
[57:27] without faith it's impossible to please
[57:30] God amen
[57:32] praise God now Church what his faith
[57:34] also faith is a revelation of the will
[57:37] of God so America was founded on faith
[57:41] it's a woman pointing to heaven see
[57:44] you're pointing to heaven and she's got
[57:48] a book in her hand that represents the
[57:50] Bible praise God now you can't see it
[57:54] there but she's got to start her
[57:56] forehead and I don't know if these
[57:57] pilgrims understood what they were
[57:59] saying there but that star represents
[58:01] the mark jesus said I'll put the mark in
[58:04] their foreheads the seal of God amen the
[58:08] baptism of the Holy go
[58:09] the seal of God in their foreheads amen
[58:11] so a nation that's going to be
[58:13] prosperous the blueprint for how to have
[58:16] a prosperous nation is to have a lady a
[58:19] church who's received Fetty she knows
[58:21] where her faith comes from she know
[58:23] where she come from
[58:24] amen she comes from heaven her
[58:26] revelation comes from heaven and she's
[58:28] born again she's got the seal of God the
[58:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost hmm glory so
[58:37] faith is an member churches the
[58:40] foundation right so the course the
[58:42] foundation here is at the top but when
[58:44] in the snatch program and faith is the
[58:46] foundation you've got to have faith it's
[58:49] impossible to get anywhere with God
[58:50] without faith hallelujah now the next
[58:56] one now there's a special order it's not
[58:58] on this but the next one is morality so
[59:02] the next one's a woman of morality now
[59:05] it's hard to see there but she has no
[59:08] eyes it's as if her eyes were plucked
[59:11] out and that's because she's not looking
[59:15] at natural things morality that doesn't
[59:17] look at the natural things for guidance
[59:19] it has to look inward for guidance so
[59:23] morality there
[59:24] she's look she's not looking to outward
[59:26] things for her for her morality but
[59:29] she's looking at the transformation of
[59:31] her heart she has the Ten Commandments
[59:33] there and she also has the scroll of
[59:37] Revelation amen Safran got faith after
[59:41] you've got this a nation next needs
[59:43] morality and so morality comes from the
[59:48] Ten Commandments right and it comes from
[59:51] the scroll of Revelation amen praise God
[59:54] why because the Ten Commandments give
[59:57] you morals but then Revelation tells you
[1:00:00] the end of all things what is the end of
[1:00:02] morality it's being a part of Jesus's
[1:00:05] bride hallelujah it's being a part of
[1:00:09] the New Jerusalem oh my that's the end
[1:00:13] point of morality you got to have the
[1:00:17] Ten Commandments you got to keep the
[1:00:18] Word of God you must live the Word of
[1:00:20] God but you know you know
[1:00:23] that satan doesn't win this thing satan
[1:00:24] looks like he's winning right now but
[1:00:26] you know Jesus Christ is the mighty
[1:00:28] conquer now you can't see it real good
[1:00:33] there but underneath you can't see at
[1:00:35] all there's too little human statues one
[1:00:38] of them is called the Prophet the RA and
[1:00:41] one of them is called the Evangelist so
[1:00:45] you will gain morality by listening to
[1:00:47] God's prophet and listening to the
[1:00:50] Evangelist I wish they would have put
[1:00:52] pastor in there but they did it so maybe
[1:00:54] but you know you got to have that too so
[1:00:57] a nation must be I must have faith must
[1:01:00] be sealed in the forehead and then
[1:01:02] morality must be established it looks to
[1:01:06] the inward character you develop
[1:01:08] inwardly that's why when you pray church
[1:01:10] you say you close your eyes that God
[1:01:11] help me to obey help me not to lie help
[1:01:14] me not this steal and cheat and think
[1:01:16] evil thoughts you close your eyes
[1:01:17] because you don't want influence you
[1:01:19] know what your choice is influenced by
[1:01:21] what you see you want your choices
[1:01:23] influenced by what's in your heart
[1:01:25] that's the Word of God the Holy Spirit
[1:01:30] so it is the preaching of the Evangelist
[1:01:33] that establishes morality and it's the
[1:01:37] prophecy of the Prophet because the
[1:01:39] Spirit of Jesus Christ is the spirit of
[1:01:41] prophecy prophecy gives you morality
[1:01:44] because you and I know there's a day of
[1:01:47] judgment coming praise God death is the
[1:01:49] great equalizer right death it makes
[1:01:53] everybody the same everybody knows
[1:01:55] they're going to die in it and you have
[1:01:57] to like our Taekwondo master set like
[1:01:59] set it like that
[1:02:00] when you die no matter how many people
[1:02:02] around you do it alone
[1:02:04] really you die alone you come into the
[1:02:07] world alone and you go out of the world
[1:02:09] alone so it gives you that more at you
[1:02:12] got to have morality because you know
[1:02:13] you've got to face God alone praise God
[1:02:18] so we get that fir through the
[1:02:20] Evangelist and the Prophet praise God
[1:02:23] that's established next so first you
[1:02:26] gotta have faith and then you must
[1:02:27] establish morality
[1:02:31] praise God next is law let me see if I
[1:02:35] can now this is a man law as a man so
[1:02:38] once you have faith it produces internal
[1:02:42] morality and that creates a moral system
[1:02:45] of law okay so now you're beyond the
[1:02:48] individual now you see it you're getting
[1:02:49] out into a community right now you need
[1:02:52] law and here and they're statues under
[1:02:55] him statues called justice and mercy so
[1:03:00] see you must have swift justice and
[1:03:02] justice is holding the scales of justice
[1:03:03] right an eye for an eye a tooth for a
[1:03:07] tooth the judgments must be fair right
[1:03:09] and it must be fair for rich or poor but
[1:03:13] there's also mercy whereas if someone
[1:03:15] makes a mistake they can be forgiven and
[1:03:18] they if they're locked up they can be
[1:03:20] let loose and they can be back into
[1:03:23] society and they can live a better life
[1:03:25] they can live a transformed life praise
[1:03:29] God
[1:03:30] now this says in holding the statue of
[1:03:32] law and extends the hand of mercy law
[1:03:35] has a warrior spirit with eyes that
[1:03:38] appear to be looking deep into the heart
[1:03:39] and the soul of the individual so we
[1:03:42] know the law must be established praise
[1:03:44] God there must be a order for society
[1:03:48] but this can't happen until we have
[1:03:50] faith right and experience with God
[1:03:52] recognizing where we come from
[1:03:54] understanding faith pleases God we've
[1:03:58] established morality in the individual
[1:04:00] who doesn't look to the world but looks
[1:04:03] inside of the heart to the word and then
[1:04:05] now law can it be established in society
[1:04:08] next we're almost to the end of this
[1:04:10] thing is education and education points
[1:04:15] of the book of knowledge praise God and
[1:04:17] now that you have civil law now you can
[1:04:20] educate your children now that the
[1:04:23] adults you know have order and they they
[1:04:26] have established what's right and wrong
[1:04:27] and justice and mercy now you can
[1:04:30] educate your children now you can't see
[1:04:34] it there but she's wearing a wreath of
[1:04:36] victory like the Roman athletes would
[1:04:38] wear and the Greek athletes there's a
[1:04:40] wreath of victory and that symbolizes
[1:04:44] that she's
[1:04:45] got the victory and this is like a 25
[1:04:48] year old mother so when a mother has
[1:04:52] victory
[1:04:53] she's victorious because she knows she's
[1:04:56] trained the children in the law or the
[1:04:58] Word of God the word of knowledge amen
[1:05:01] so she's victorious because she's
[1:05:04] prepared these young children she's
[1:05:06] trained them up and the things of God
[1:05:07] and when they're older they won't depart
[1:05:10] from it so what is Satan done to this
[1:05:12] world
[1:05:13] Satan's done to our country he's gone
[1:05:15] down to the schools right and he's
[1:05:17] changed the thing that they're being
[1:05:19] taught right that's how he's now you
[1:05:23] know Satan's got the wreath he thinks at
[1:05:25] least with a lot of people with many
[1:05:27] families Satan's wearing his wreath
[1:05:28] because he's changed the way that people
[1:05:31] are educated right so he's done that but
[1:05:38] this is how the pilgrims knew they had
[1:05:40] to establish this on faith morality law
[1:05:44] and then education now underneath her
[1:05:47] are a picture of another mother holding
[1:05:49] a child's hand showing how it was the
[1:05:51] the parents responsibility to guide
[1:05:54] their children right so in other words
[1:05:58] uh you know the early pilgrims weren't
[1:06:01] about just having big school government
[1:06:03] right
[1:06:04] they believed in home school that was
[1:06:06] okay and you know of course it was okay
[1:06:09] to set him to schools but there had to
[1:06:10] be the Word of God at the school praise
[1:06:13] God
[1:06:13] now we went to public school and God had
[1:06:16] mercy on us so God will have mercy in
[1:06:18] this hour but we better be praying
[1:06:20] praise God if we send our children
[1:06:22] public school we better be praying if we
[1:06:24] homeschool we better be praying as well
[1:06:26] praise God because it's the parents
[1:06:29] responsibility after you have faith
[1:06:31] morality in law now it's the parents job
[1:06:34] to educate them to give them the
[1:06:36] knowledge they need praise God
[1:06:39] now so one one side is the the mother
[1:06:43] with the holding the head of the child
[1:06:45] on the other side is an old man and he's
[1:06:48] standing there he's got an open book and
[1:06:49] it's pointing at open books at his feet
[1:06:52] and that shows that the elderly have a
[1:06:54] part two the grandparents have an
[1:06:57] important part of Education
[1:06:58] the grandparent we're to look to the
[1:07:01] older ones for wisdom because they got
[1:07:04] the books open they know what the book
[1:07:06] says ain't a head and on the other side
[1:07:09] of the old man is a globe which shows
[1:07:13] the old ones should have a knowledge
[1:07:14] about the world they should know what
[1:07:16] the world is like and be able to teach
[1:07:18] the next generation about how to I'll
[1:07:21] say like this to finish the great
[1:07:22] commission praise God right that's what
[1:07:27] the world represents and also a
[1:07:28] Christian worldview how do we understand
[1:07:31] nations how do we understand a foreign
[1:07:33] affairs you understand it by the
[1:07:35] knowledge gained from the Word of God
[1:07:37] and the out the older ones should have
[1:07:40] that good wisdom and good understanding
[1:07:42] on how to think about world problems
[1:07:43] praise God and world solutions and every
[1:07:47] solution lays in the Word of God praise
[1:07:50] the Lord the church now we're coming
[1:07:53] down to the end of this so this last
[1:07:57] picture remember this is called the
[1:07:59] matrix of liberty this is how the
[1:08:02] Pilgrims and you can go this that this
[1:08:04] monument is in Plymouth Massachusetts
[1:08:07] it's right over looking you know
[1:08:10] Plymouth Rock where the Pilgrims landed
[1:08:12] it's overlooking that up on the hill and
[1:08:14] it's it's got more visitors since Kirk
[1:08:16] Cameron did his his documentary because
[1:08:20] it's been hidden people have forgotten
[1:08:22] about it right people have left the Word
[1:08:24] of God and they've gone to entertainment
[1:08:26] they've gone to Sports they've gone to
[1:08:28] money they've gone to everything except
[1:08:30] God's Word they've left the pattern the
[1:08:32] blueprint of God's Word but thank God
[1:08:35] and every age God has a witness amen
[1:08:38] hallelujah and this stands as a four
[1:08:41] story tall witness against this nation
[1:08:44] for those who will reject God's Word
[1:08:46] this is God's plan now the last man is
[1:08:51] called Liberty Man look he's a young man
[1:08:52] looks out of ice 22 or 21 he's a strong
[1:08:55] man he's a soldier and he is the fruit
[1:09:00] of obeying the matrix so if you have
[1:09:03] faith and then if you have morality law
[1:09:06] and education you are gonna produce
[1:09:08] young strong soldiers for the kingdom of
[1:09:11] God
[1:09:12] hey Dad hallelujah and he hopes you
[1:09:15] can't see it here but he holds broken
[1:09:18] chains so he's so strong that he breaks
[1:09:21] the yokes amen and the Bible said the
[1:09:23] anointing breaks the yokes hallelujah so
[1:09:27] if you want to be delivered from an
[1:09:28] addiction it takes the anointing of the
[1:09:30] Holy Spirit praise God now of course
[1:09:32] they were thinking natural many times of
[1:09:34] course being free from Great Britain
[1:09:36] right the chains of the Anglican Church
[1:09:38] in the England Church and over a shorter
[1:09:43] you can't see it but there's a skin a
[1:09:45] hide of a lion and the lion's head skin
[1:09:48] is at his feet hallelujah
[1:09:52] so the Bible said Satan's like a roaring
[1:09:56] lion
[1:09:56] so this liner can represent two things
[1:09:59] that can represent Satan that when you
[1:10:01] when you have all this established in
[1:10:03] your home in your country you have
[1:10:05] victory over the evil one because the
[1:10:07] gates of Hell will not prevail against
[1:10:09] the church amen it's the church praise
[1:10:12] God the church is a her praise God the
[1:10:16] gates of Hell will not prevail against
[1:10:17] her the church because she's the lady of
[1:10:20] the top lady faith amen and remember
[1:10:27] Mystery Babylon was a combination of
[1:10:29] those three other animals right the line
[1:10:31] the leopard and the bear so this shows
[1:10:35] even in their day the day of the the
[1:10:37] Sardis church age and then also now it
[1:10:39] goes into Philadelphia Church age it
[1:10:41] showed that this is how a person of
[1:10:44] believer gets victory over Mystery
[1:10:47] Babylon amen with faith morality living
[1:10:52] the word obeying the law establishing
[1:10:54] law being educated and taught the things
[1:10:56] of the the Word of God and then
[1:10:59] establishing Liberty praise God
[1:11:07] now just to give you an idea how big
[1:11:09] that is look how big that is you can see
[1:11:12] the people down at the bottom look how
[1:11:13] the God the cause of the small they are
[1:11:16] so I was looking at like one two three
[1:11:19] four over four stories tall its massive
[1:11:24] maybe one day we'll go see it honey we
[1:11:26] ready somebody say maybe we'll try to go
[1:11:27] see that Saturday I don't know that's
[1:11:30] possible but that's what this video
[1:11:34] documentary teaches about though they
[1:11:37] wanted to leave this behind this is one
[1:11:39] solid piece of granite mine 70 years so
[1:11:44] that all Americans would know this is
[1:11:46] how you establish Liberty and I just
[1:11:50] think it's good brother bang that I came
[1:11:51] out of Liberty Center I just think that
[1:11:52] my hometown was Liberty center and our
[1:11:54] nickname is the Sons of Liberty
[1:11:56] praise God so I just think that's just
[1:11:59] God gives that to encourage me but I
[1:12:02] said like this I preached a gospel that
[1:12:04] sets the captives free
[1:12:06] Amen because I've seen it I've seen
[1:12:07] people deliver it as I preach for them
[1:12:09] do people healed saved as I preached
[1:12:12] them i baptize them in the name of the
[1:12:13] Lord Jesus Christ amen
[1:12:15] we preach the gospel of the Liberty the
[1:12:18] good news of Jesus Christ amen
[1:12:20] not many will receive it but those that
[1:12:23] will is the power of God unto salvation
[1:12:25] for them praise God
[1:12:27] thank the Lord now I'd like to look at a
[1:12:35] few ideas on prayer and fasting so now
[1:12:39] I'm gonna switch over here to the book
[1:12:41] by Derek Prince and hopefully I can that
[1:12:47] was a song service I think it was this
[1:12:50] one there yeah
[1:12:58] no severing that one oh yes this one
[1:13:03] Bible club Arrowhead Bible club I had
[1:13:05] this one there so let's just look at a
[1:13:08] few donor Rita a little bit of history
[1:13:10] on prayer and fasting we showed how the
[1:13:12] pilgrims prayed and fasted and God heard
[1:13:16] that member at the the drought they had
[1:13:18] in 1623 I think it was their third or or
[1:13:21] second summer there and they're gonna
[1:13:23] lose all their crops and it could mean
[1:13:25] death and they set aside a day of prayer
[1:13:27] and fasting and they prayed all day the
[1:13:29] Native Americans are like yeah right
[1:13:30] like nothing's gonna happen but then God
[1:13:32] answered with a nice gentle storm and a
[1:13:35] lot of rain water and the crops were
[1:13:37] saved and the Native Americans were
[1:13:39] amazed that God had answered and so that
[1:13:42] was prayer and fasting was part of their
[1:13:46] their history as part of their way to
[1:13:49] seek God now I want to look at a few
[1:13:52] things here let's look at George
[1:13:53] Washington first in May of 1774 the
[1:14:03] British Parliament had ordered an
[1:14:05] embargo on the port of Boston
[1:14:07] Massachusetts
[1:14:10] but then the House of Burgesses of
[1:14:13] Virginia passed a resolution protesting
[1:14:16] this act and setting aside the day of
[1:14:18] June first as a Day of Prayer how
[1:14:21] humiliation and fasting so in other
[1:14:26] words the leaders in America of course
[1:14:29] we had informed our government yet
[1:14:31] leaders in America were like we're not
[1:14:34] we don't want this embargo we don't want
[1:14:35] this tax so they said let's set aside a
[1:14:38] day of Prayer humiliation and fasting
[1:14:41] and it was ordered in 1774 that everyone
[1:14:49] submit to this and it was ordered by
[1:14:54] George Washington even before he was
[1:14:57] president he said that on the first day
[1:15:01] of June that it says to go to the to
[1:15:05] each person go to the church in his own
[1:15:08] City for the purposes of fasting
[1:15:11] humiliation
[1:15:12] prayer devoutly to implore the divine
[1:15:15] interposition for averting that heavy
[1:15:19] commodity which threatens the
[1:15:20] destruction of our civil rights and that
[1:15:25] each person read prayers and lists and
[1:15:29] pre and listen to sermons and preach
[1:15:30] sermons suitable for the occasion
[1:15:33] so in other words they could sense wars
[1:15:36] on the horizon so we need to pray and
[1:15:39] ask God God help us to miss out on this
[1:15:42] war please let us not go to war and so
[1:15:49] they set aside that day George
[1:15:50] Washington in his diary wrote these
[1:15:54] words 1 2 3 4 5 he wrote 7 words in his
[1:15:57] diary that day and it was says this went
[1:16:00] to church and fasted all day that was
[1:16:03] George Washington's diary entry for June
[1:16:06] 1st 1774 amen praise God and we were in
[1:16:13] one of those churches in Williamsburg I
[1:16:16] don't know if it was that one but we
[1:16:17] were in a church where the the founding
[1:16:20] fathers met right at the time of the
[1:16:22] revolution but before deciding so it
[1:16:25] might it must have been 1775 or
[1:16:27] something along those lines they prayed
[1:16:30] and fasted all day in that church
[1:16:34] Washington not only believed in prayer
[1:16:36] for divine intervention but he also pray
[1:16:40] believed in acknowledging such
[1:16:41] intervention when prayer was answered so
[1:16:45] a few years later now this is a
[1:16:46] different one I don't think I have this
[1:16:48] one up there no I don't but a few years
[1:16:51] later in 1795 once he was president he
[1:16:54] set aside a day a National Day of Prayer
[1:16:57] and Thanksgiving in 1795 ok so about 21
[1:17:02] years later and he said we want to make
[1:17:07] a day of devout reverence affectionate
[1:17:09] gratitude to acknowledge our many and
[1:17:12] great obligations to Almighty God and to
[1:17:14] implore him to continue and confirm the
[1:17:18] blessings we experienced amen amen
[1:17:22] so he saw that the blessings okay we won
[1:17:25] the
[1:17:26] or we won the Revolutionary War we
[1:17:28] defeat the Britons or the British he's
[1:17:30] but less devoted damn Thanksgiving and
[1:17:32] also in this day of Thanksgiving
[1:17:34] let's give him thanks and ask that the
[1:17:36] blessings continue Church we got to keep
[1:17:38] coming to church and thanking God saying
[1:17:41] God let your blessings continue let my
[1:17:43] health continue let let us continue to
[1:17:45] win souls every now and then praise God
[1:17:47] that miracles signs and wonders continue
[1:17:50] we need to ask for these things to
[1:17:52] continue we got to ask for it Amen if we
[1:17:55] don't ask we're not going to receive
[1:17:56] because that's the order you got to ask
[1:17:58] and then you receive praise God so he
[1:18:04] set aside the thirteenth I'm sorry yeah
[1:18:07] the thirteenth day I'm so the nineteenth
[1:18:12] day of February 1795 as a national day
[1:18:16] of Thanksgiving in prayer to follow up
[1:18:19] and give thanks he said I we will render
[1:18:23] their sincere and hearty thanks to the
[1:18:25] great ruler of nations for his manifest
[1:18:28] and signal mercies which distinguished
[1:18:30] our lot as a nation and at the same time
[1:18:34] humbly and reverently to beseech the
[1:18:36] kind of--the ER of these blessings to
[1:18:39] graciously prolong them to us to imprint
[1:18:42] on our hearts a deep and solemn sense of
[1:18:45] our obligations to him for them to teach
[1:18:49] us to rightly estimate their immense
[1:18:51] value to preserve us from the arrogance
[1:18:55] of prosperity that's what we need praise
[1:18:56] God amen God keep us for being arrogant
[1:19:01] and prideful help us remember where all
[1:19:03] these blessings come from hallelujah
[1:19:10] help us to establish habits of sobriety
[1:19:14] order morality and piety and finally to
[1:19:17] impart all the blessings we possess or
[1:19:20] ask for ourselves to the whole family of
[1:19:22] mankind so George Washington was praying
[1:19:25] not just for his nation but the
[1:19:27] blessings of Christianity to flow to
[1:19:28] every nation praise God I'm gonna jump
[1:19:33] a little bit to our second president
[1:19:37] John Adams we United States were coming
[1:19:43] to the verge of open war with France in
[1:19:47] 1798 so that was three years after this
[1:19:52] damned prayer and fasting to George
[1:19:53] Washington established but on March 23rd
[1:19:59] 1798 he proclaimed May 9th then that
[1:20:05] same year so - in two months in advance
[1:20:06] as a day of solemn humiliation fasting
[1:20:09] in prayer and John Adams wrote this we
[1:20:13] pray for safety and prosperity of
[1:20:15] Nations ultimately essentially depend on
[1:20:18] the protection and the blessing of
[1:20:19] Almighty God and the National
[1:20:21] acknowledgement of this truth is not
[1:20:23] only an indispensable duty which the
[1:20:26] people owe to him how many oh god that
[1:20:28] Amen I owe God that but a duty whose
[1:20:32] natural influence is favorable to the
[1:20:34] promotion of that morality and piety he
[1:20:40] said under these considerations it has
[1:20:41] appeared to me that the duty of
[1:20:43] employing the mercy and benediction of
[1:20:45] heaven on our country demands at this
[1:20:47] time a special attention from its
[1:20:49] inhabitants so he said I I proclaim a
[1:20:54] day of solemn humiliation fasting in
[1:20:56] prayer that the citizens of these United
[1:20:58] States abstain on that day from their
[1:21:01] customary worldly occupations and offer
[1:21:04] their devote addresses to the fathers of
[1:21:06] Mercy praise God in our deepest humility
[1:21:11] acknowledged before the god I serve
[1:21:13] before God the manifold sins and
[1:21:15] transgressions which we are justly
[1:21:17] chargeable as individuals and as a
[1:21:19] nation beseeching him at the same time
[1:21:22] his infinite grace through the Redeemer
[1:21:24] of the world freely to remit all of our
[1:21:27] offences and to Incline in us by His
[1:21:29] Holy Spirit that the sincere repentance
[1:21:31] and Reformation which may afford us
[1:21:35] reason to hope for his inestimable
[1:21:37] favour and heavenly benediction he
[1:21:41] raised God and they say these guys
[1:21:43] didn't believe in God nonsense they just
[1:21:47] don't know there
[1:21:47] praise God this don't read history
[1:21:51] praise God's there you have the first
[1:21:53] president the second president both
[1:21:55] designating days of prayer and fasting
[1:21:59] now of course you know they never went
[1:22:02] to war with France right God kept them
[1:22:04] from that so see the god ants when they
[1:22:07] fasted and prayed God heard their
[1:22:08] prayers the church I read this or I
[1:22:11] heard this today on a documentary when
[1:22:13] George Washington had them fat it was 3
[1:22:17] million Americans on their knees pray
[1:22:20] amen hallelujah and look how hard it is
[1:22:25] hard is it to get one church to get on
[1:22:27] their knees fasting and praying
[1:22:28] how hard is it today just one church
[1:22:31] ours or another one how hard is it but
[1:22:33] see they were so sincere they were so
[1:22:35] believing God's Word they were so honest
[1:22:38] before God three million people got on
[1:22:40] their knees fasted and prayed and God
[1:22:42] gave him a victory the Revolutionary God
[1:22:44] gave him a victory over France look at
[1:22:47] the power of Prayer praise God three
[1:22:52] million people on their knees of course
[1:22:57] you know what God did with Daniel one
[1:22:59] man on his knees look at God did with
[1:23:00] Daniel God said the angel gave him the
[1:23:03] Daniel seventy weeks God God showed him
[1:23:05] all these revelations show where the lot
[1:23:08] his people would be in their end time
[1:23:09] and he showed him all this the future
[1:23:12] things mine he showed them the enemy
[1:23:14] shortened God Daniel saw the white
[1:23:17] throne judgment amen hallelujah
[1:23:19] Daniel Chapter seven so one man
[1:23:22] dedicated to God in prayer and passing
[1:23:24] can receive great revelations but look
[1:23:27] how much more can be done if we do it
[1:23:29] collectively so we think
[1:23:39] we think we sacrifice a lot now let's
[1:23:40] remember how much they sacrificed went
[1:23:43] to church all day and fasted and prayed
[1:23:45] George Washington said listen to
[1:23:48] preaching all day prayed all day saying
[1:23:51] all day didn't eat all day that's that's
[1:23:54] our first president praise God all right
[1:23:58] let's get jump ahead to our fourth
[1:23:59] president now in 1815 America was on the
[1:24:10] verge with another war with Britain they
[1:24:13] want some more fighting they hadn't had
[1:24:15] enough they wanted some more but this
[1:24:19] story has a miracle right the other two
[1:24:22] you know they prayed and fasted but they
[1:24:24] had to fight that fight and then the
[1:24:26] first one they got the Revolutionary War
[1:24:27] the second one they defeated France
[1:24:29] before was a big war but this one is a
[1:24:33] story of God answering their prayers
[1:24:37] even before the day of prayer and
[1:24:39] fasting and that fulfills Isaiah and I
[1:24:43] know this applies to the millennium and
[1:24:45] the future home but it was kind of
[1:24:48] fulfilled at this time because Isaiah 65
[1:24:51] 24 says and it shall come to pass that
[1:24:53] before they call I will answer and while
[1:24:58] they're yet speaking I will hear oh
[1:25:00] that's just like Eliezer Amen remember
[1:25:04] at least I just read that this week
[1:25:05] Eliezer is saying God let the woman that
[1:25:08] comes out and feeds my camel and then
[1:25:11] feeds the others let her be the the wife
[1:25:14] for my servant son Isaac and the Bible
[1:25:16] said while he praying that Rebecca walks
[1:25:19] out and says hey can I feed your camels
[1:25:21] amen I'm an alien race God that's the
[1:25:24] power of the Holy Spirit why are you
[1:25:26] praying many times God can answer while
[1:25:28] we pray praise God
[1:25:31] so James Madison saw a war on the
[1:25:34] horizon with Great Britain in church he
[1:25:42] set a date was Thursday
[1:25:46] a April I don't know the day as a
[1:25:49] Thursday in now the second Thursday in
[1:25:51] April 1815 he proclaimed a great day of
[1:25:55] fasting and prayer he said that got to
[1:26:00] Almighty God for his great goodness
[1:26:03] manifesting and restoring to them the
[1:26:05] blessing of peace they were starting to

[1:27:26] years here of course this is while that
[1:27:28] monument was being built right now
[1:27:31] Liberty matrix-y was being built Abraham
[1:27:35] Lincoln had at least three separate days
[1:27:37] of national humiliation prayer and
[1:27:40] fasting of course the prime cause of
[1:27:43] each was a civil war and the central
[1:27:46] theme of a petition was for the
[1:27:49] restoration of national peace and unity
[1:27:54] Lincoln in these at Lincoln's first
[1:27:57] proclamation was requested by Joint
[1:27:59] Committee of both both houses of
[1:28:01] Congress and the day set apart was the
[1:28:03] last Thursday in September 1861 the
[1:28:08] following is a part of his Proclamation
[1:28:10] he said I'm recommending a day of public
[1:28:13] humiliation prayer and fasting to be
[1:28:15] observed by the people United States
[1:28:17] with religious solemn matisse and the
[1:28:20] offering of fervent supplications to
[1:28:22] Almighty God for the safety and welfare
[1:28:24] of these states his blessing on their
[1:28:27] arms see he wanted God's blessings on

[1:28:54] said it is fit and becoming in all
[1:28:56] people at all times look at this 1861
[1:29:01] church all people all times to
[1:29:04] acknowledge and revere the supreme
[1:29:06] government of God to bow in humble
[1:29:08] submission to the his chastisements to
[1:29:11] confess and deplore their sins and
[1:29:13] transgressions in the full conviction
[1:29:16] that the fear of the Lord is the
[1:29:17] beginning of wisdom and to pray and
[1:29:20] withal fervency and contrition for the
[1:29:23] pardon of their past offenses and for
[1:29:26] blessings upon their present and
[1:29:28] prospective action amen I saying repent
[1:29:32] of all the past and look for God's
[1:29:34] leadership in your life right now
[1:29:37] he said I Abraham Lincoln president
[1:29:40] United States do a point in the last
[1:29:42] Thursday in September next as a day of
[1:29:44] humiliation prayer and fasting for all
[1:29:46] the people the nation and I recommend to
[1:29:49] all the people especially to all the
[1:29:51] ministers and the teachers of religion
[1:29:53] of all denominations and to all the
[1:29:55] heads of families to observe and keep
[1:29:57] that day according to their several
[1:29:59] Creed's and modes of worship in all
[1:30:01] humility and with all religious solemn
[1:30:04] duty to the end that the United prayer
[1:30:06] of the nation may ascend to the throne
[1:30:09] of grace amen and may bring down
[1:30:12] plentiful blessings upon our country hey
[1:30:16] hey man praise God he said I implore all
[1:30:22] people to assemble in their preferred
[1:30:24] places of what public worship on that
[1:30:26] day and there and then to render to the
[1:30:29] Almighty and merciful ruler of the
[1:30:31] universe such homages is it homage is
[1:30:35] homages homage and such confessions and
[1:30:39] to offer to him such supplications as
[1:30:42] the Congress of the United States have
[1:30:44] so solemnly so earnestly and so
[1:30:46] reverently recommended now Church OB
[1:30:52] see now this is one historical fact from
[1:30:55] the beginning of the pilgrims time in
[1:30:59] the United States all the way up to here
[1:31:01] the Civil War history says there was
[1:31:06] over 1,000 days of prayer and fasting
[1:31:09] that were assigned by the leaders of
[1:31:12] either you know the pilgrims or the
[1:31:14] United States the president's 1,000 days
[1:31:17] of prayer and fasting and sometimes we
[1:31:21] get discouraged coming to church three
[1:31:22] times a week right because life gets
[1:31:25] hard we get you know mind battles we
[1:31:27] struggle but if we want to see God's
[1:31:30] blessings continue we have to talk to
[1:31:33] God we have to clean up our lives amen
[1:31:35] we got to keep vigilant praise the Lord
[1:31:38] amen we got to following the pattern of
[1:31:42] God's holiness praise God and living how
[1:31:45] God would have us to live now I'm
[1:31:47] closing let me do a couple scriptures
[1:31:49] that I close here go to first Timothy
[1:31:53] chapter 2 let's read this again first
[1:31:58] Timothy chapter
[1:31:59] to verse one now I hope this helps you
[1:32:20] see Church why why brother Branham would
[1:32:22] say I would be honored to fight for this
[1:32:24] country remember program tried to sign
[1:32:26] up for the Second World War remember
[1:32:27] that they said we got enough guys
[1:32:29] already your clergy you're in your late
[1:32:31] 30s you know you need to stay and don't
[1:32:33] go over
[1:32:33] he said he wanted to he said it would've
[1:32:36] been an honor to go and fight and die
[1:32:37] for this country and Abraham Lincoln is
[1:32:40] like Lord be the the strength behind our
[1:32:43] arms right so you can see how God is the
[1:32:50] one moving even in the natural armies
[1:32:52] God many times with the righteous nation
[1:32:55] he's the one behind them and there's
[1:32:57] nothing wrong with that because you have
[1:32:59] to protect what God has given to you
[1:33:01] praise God now 1st Timothy 2 verse 1 now
[1:33:08] look at the order here I now remember
[1:33:11] this is the same chapter where he says
[1:33:13] women can't preach this is the same
[1:33:15] chapter where he says women need to wear
[1:33:17] modest clothes right and Adam was the
[1:33:21] one who sinned right he's the one that
[1:33:22] was he wasn't a seed he said willfully
[1:33:24] Adams mistake of course we know he did
[1:33:27] it to save Eve part of him it's the same
[1:33:31] chapter verse 1 i exhort therefore that
[1:33:34] first of all supplications prayers
[1:33:36] intercessions and giving of thanks be
[1:33:39] made for all men so Paul is laying out 2
[1:33:42] Timothy this is how you hold a church
[1:33:44] this is how you live a godly life the
[1:33:47] first thing we're established on is
[1:33:49] prayer and prayer for all men praise God
[1:33:53] Catholic Rite Methodist pray for sinners
[1:33:57] the thing that this our house needs to
[1:34:00] be a house of prayer praise God if you
[1:34:03] know anyone that needs prayer bring them
[1:34:05] here
[1:34:05] you should come early and pray for
[1:34:07] people here praise God when we're United
[1:34:10] you should we should pray and have our
[1:34:12] minds on other people
[1:34:13] because Paul says first of all pray for
[1:34:16] all men
[1:34:19] verse 2 now look what he goes through
[1:34:22] now for Kings we should pray for kings
[1:34:26] and for all that are in authority that
[1:34:32] we may lead a quiet and peaceable life
[1:34:34] in all godliness and honesty amen look
[1:34:37] at all these that what are they praying
[1:34:38] for they're praying for peace God give
[1:34:41] us peace yet there's enemies out there
[1:34:43] but God will use the enemies to drive us
[1:34:46] to our knees to pray for peace amen
[1:34:48] hallelujah verse three for this is good
[1:34:56] and acceptable in the sight of God our
[1:34:58] Savior see God wants us to live a
[1:35:00] peaceful life but we do it by prayer if
[1:35:03] we're having battles in our homes if
[1:35:05] we're having battles in our families
[1:35:06] it's making us want to pray it's you
[1:35:09] guys using that so we'll pray for peace
[1:35:12] praise God
[1:35:16] now we had that in our life you know
[1:35:18] whenever we first came in the message
[1:35:20] there was arguments in my family there
[1:35:22] was arguments on all sides and it
[1:35:23] brought us to prayer right I mean what
[1:35:25] does those things drive you to it drives
[1:35:27] you to prayer because you don't want and
[1:35:29] thank God you don't God use his time you
[1:35:31] know time well many times cool people
[1:35:33] off praise God but it was through the
[1:35:35] prayers right prayer for peace prayer
[1:35:39] for that we can live our lives how we
[1:35:42] feel led to do and fulfill the Great
[1:35:44] Commission and do our part and teach our
[1:35:46] children praise God amen do that third
[1:35:49] step right with that fourth step of
[1:35:51] Education do that prepare God wants a
[1:35:55] generation prepared so we need peace to
[1:35:58] prepare the next generation that's part
[1:35:59] of God's plan amen
[1:36:01] we need years of peace to train up these
[1:36:04] children to take four so they later on
[1:36:06] can take the gospel elsewhere praise God
[1:36:09] we need years of peace to do that
[1:36:11] hallelujah amen all right
[1:36:23] go back to Luke 19 now preach on this
[1:36:26] recently as a parable of the kingdom
[1:36:32] this is the parable of the pounds let's
[1:36:35] go back to the Luke 19 verse 11
[1:36:41] remember this parable he was talking to
[1:36:43] Jews and they thought my the kingdom of
[1:36:45] God is going to come right now and Jesus
[1:36:47] kinda had to cool them off say put on
[1:36:48] put on your brakes boys it ain't
[1:36:50] happening right now he was going to tell
[1:36:54] them that he you know if the Jews were
[1:36:56] to take the kingdom I'm gonna give it to
[1:36:57] the Gentiles but here's a thought that
[1:37:03] one of these documentaries brought out I
[1:37:06] really liked it he said a certain
[1:37:08] nobleman went into a far country to
[1:37:09] receive for himself a kingdom and to
[1:37:11] return and he called his ten servants
[1:37:14] and delivered them 10 pounds and said
[1:37:16] unto them occupy till I come but his
[1:37:21] citizens hated him and sent a message
[1:37:23] after him saying we will not have this
[1:37:25] man to reign over us and it came to pass
[1:37:28] that when he was returned having
[1:37:29] received the kingdom then he commanded
[1:37:31] these servants to be called in him to
[1:37:33] whom he had given the money that he
[1:37:34] might know how much every man had gained
[1:37:37] by trading so I want to just close with
[1:37:41] that thought on occupy till i come so
[1:37:43] stay on our feet here having been closed
[1:37:45] or a be dismissed in just a moment here
[1:37:48] he said occupy until I come let me look
[1:37:54] up the Greek word I didn't forget to do
[1:37:55] that let me look it up real quick here
[1:37:58] occupy means too busy oneself with to
[1:38:01] trade to occupy so God has given each of
[1:38:05] us natural money but also spiritual
[1:38:08] talents as we looked at last month and
[1:38:10] the previous month's and Jesus didn't
[1:38:13] say be a pushover and just be lazy and
[1:38:17] don't do anything Jesus said occupy he
[1:38:21] said pray for those that are in the
[1:38:23] government pray for those that are
[1:38:25] ruling so you can live a quiet and
[1:38:27] peaceable life and preach the gospel and
[1:38:30] get the next generation to hear the word
[1:38:33] of God
[1:38:33] occupy that's my church I believe we
[1:38:37] should
[1:38:37] pray for our leaders in America we
[1:38:40] should vote people say now people say
[1:38:42] the voting is rigged
[1:38:43] how can it be rigged especially with
[1:38:45] last presidential election they wanted a
[1:38:48] Hillary Clinton to win right so how is
[1:38:53] it rigged it's not rigged as far as I
[1:38:56] can see because God is the one the Bible
[1:38:59] said God is the one who raises up and
[1:39:02] takes down even if it was rigged before
[1:39:05] God will sue you so use it too he'll use
[1:39:09] it to bring justice and he'll use it to
[1:39:12] ultimately bring about his prophecy but
[1:39:16] Jesus Christ said occupy take the goods
[1:39:20] I've given you protect it in other words
[1:39:22] fight for invest in it right fight the
[1:39:25] good fight of faith we're supposed to
[1:39:29] keep peace in our homes right we're
[1:39:31] supposed to establish morality and then
[1:39:34] educate our children and and keep the
[1:39:36] law of God and that will produce men and
[1:39:39] women that love the liberty of the Holy
[1:39:40] Spirit amen
[1:39:41] how do you praise God amen
[1:39:46] praise the Lord so I got a whole lot
[1:39:49] more Lord willing we'll get two on
[1:39:50] Sunday by God's grace did you like that
[1:39:53] was that helpful I know it's a lot of
[1:39:54] history Church but we got to do that we
[1:39:57] got to look at back at history we have
[1:40:00] to see we have to learn from history
[1:40:02] praise God so you can switch over there
[1:40:07] now let's bow our heads for a word of
[1:40:09] Prayer here let's remember that little
[1:40:14] monument I should say little let's
[1:40:16] remember that massive monument for a
[1:40:17] moment are we keeping God's command in
[1:40:26] this pattern now this is that we'd say
[1:40:28] the final pattern but it is a great look
[1:40:31] at how to establish real liberty and
[1:40:34] freedom as a Christian first thing is
[1:40:38] faith have we received a revelation from
[1:40:40] heaven
[1:40:42] then we got to establish morality godly
[1:40:46] habits in our lives that will make us
[1:40:49] obey the laws the land it or make us
[1:40:51] respect our government it will lead us
[1:40:57] to train the next generation so it's so
[1:41:01] important to chain that next generation
[1:41:03] and the effects of that will be people
[1:41:06] that really experience the power and the
[1:41:08] Liberty the Holy Spirit as Paul said
[1:41:13] we're the spirit Lord is theirs what
[1:41:15] church Liberty amen
