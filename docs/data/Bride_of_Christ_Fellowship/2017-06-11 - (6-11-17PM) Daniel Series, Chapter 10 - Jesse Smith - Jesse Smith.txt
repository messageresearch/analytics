[Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] Oh [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] thank you lord I set our feet here from reading of the word here let's go to the end of chapter 10 Daniel chapter 10 or the street not leave the first two verses up stick Daniel 10 and 12 a rather short chapter Elevens the long one this would be obvious or message easily to Daniel chapter 10 I hope you're enjoying it I surely have I feel like all the nervousness towards Daniel and these things have all been dissolved and God's grace I mean you're very secure and what our prophet taught us we didn't want to teach this to others as well very thankful for that end of chapter 10 verse 1 Daniel 10 verse 1 and the 3rd year of Cyrus king of Persia a thing was revealed unto Daniel whose name was called bel - Shay's our and the thing was true but the time appointed was long and he understood the thing and had understanding of division we'll just stop right there let's have a word of Prayer if you need on your heart just making known up to God like the free John the annuals answered prayers tonight let's just our knit Heavenly Father Lord we love your word we love seeing these Psalms we glorify your name o Lord all Majesty belongs to the all glory and honor Lord Jesus to the alone dear God we worship you tonight we thank you for the songs of Zion we thank you Lord for the prayers of the saints Lord Jesus truly you're with us intruder courting these events here tonight look upon our pure hearts Lord and meet the needs of every hand that was raised in every heart that was raised her father were grateful to be in your house lord thank you for our visitor and his daughter but Ivan their dear God I pray he just ministered his feets father to speak to us in a special way tonight Lord and remind us how you so faithfully answer our prayers Lord if we just wait and believe and so father we love you tonight bless us now in Jesus Christ everybody said amen god bless you ve seen a race car now that is rich over there complete circle I can show some quotes here and some scriptures tonight by God's grace like I said I know how long we'll be but I don't know about you with it whenever getting the spirit time just flies anyway so don't even worry about the clock play map in order to try to take care of my throat voice rather I try to keep a little shorter on Sunday night let's look at this here Daniels answered prayers here it's Daniel the Daniel series been working on Hart Ted and I trusted blessed by this brought great understanding to me you know next chapter is going to be a little bit of study and looks like it's on the second and third kingdoms of Daniels vision so Persian Empire and Grecian Empire and then we have a lot of the types of ante kiyose I'm sorry anta Caius and then a lot of times as him as the Antichrist so we're looking at that Lord willing next week by the grace of the Lord is going to see our sister Dale may God bless you sister good to see you praise the Lord so that's a look to the Lord here and we preach it his word I think it's just an encouraging message on prayer and intercession seeking seeking God's face is a great chapter on how to seek God's face and to have confidence as you wait upon the Lord and pray God will surely answer you now chapter 10 the background the commentary says this chapter takes place one year after chapter 9 when Gabriel visited Daniel and gave him Daniel seventy weeks so one year later God visits in Daniel's got 84 years old at this time how many would be like Danny when you're 84 years old you're still just fasting and praying as a 9 Laurie go under the Bible said haven't caught him greatly beloved they met because heaven loved him because he loved having a man he was interested in spiritual things a man and the longer time goes on the longer we're going to see the world has nothing to offer us we must see heavenly things a maginot be everything anything of the world will be in vain it will pass away but the things of God are eternally mad now verse 1 we read that for our text tonight now Cyrus followed Darius there is the me who has succeeded belt Shazahn so Cyrus here this takes place in the third year Cyrus alright and the Bible said that Daniel received a true revelation and he understood the vision so we're going to see this is a vision of the visit from the angel of the Lord what a what a great type of brother branham how the angel orbit visit brother Brandon what a great great way to learn how brother Branham must have felt by looking at the life of Daniel it's a great teaching here now verse 2 in those days identity was mourning three full weeks I ate no Pleasant bread nor camp flesh nor wine in my mouth neither did I anoint myself at all so three weeks were fulfilled so Daniel mourned three weeks he had no Pleasant or delightful bread it was a partial fast so he ate some bread and water while he was mourning now here's why he was said history says the construction of the temple through zerubabbel had been stopped remember the Samaritan government had stopped them they had a great revival coming back and so forth but the government had lied or I'm sorry people had lied to the government they stopped the construction of the temple so Daniels morning and and he's praying and wondering why the temple had been stopped but as day after Daniel prays of course two prophets made the people's efforts prosper it was Hagee is a Cariah so see a the even though the people look defeated as long as somebody was intercessor intercessing in Prague God could raise up a new prophet under a new messenger here super bowl would had led them there but they needed some encouragement so God raised up two anointed prophets and the Bible said they prospered through the prophecy now how many would say your life has prospered because you heard the Prophet brother Brad a man I can say that did that by the - totally Pross a man spiritually most importantly spiritually right of course naturally as you pay your tithes if your offerings God prospers you but that's not so much the phosphor that we really need to really to prosper in God in spiritual blessings praise that what you're the fruits of the spirit the gifts of the Spirit the revelation of God's Word in that those things are we must prosper in it hallelujah so Daniel was mourning and fasting these three weeks and God eventually brought two prophets that was later of course Daniels now in Babylon of course but the Haggai and Zechariah rose up in Israel you're a little bit years later by God's grace now verse four in the four and twentieth day of the first month as I was by the side of the great river which is high dekho verse five that lifted up my eyes and looked and behold a certain man clothed in linen whose loins were girded with the fine gold of you fast now verse six his body was also like a bear on his face as the appearance of lightning his lamps her eyes as lamps of fire and his arms and his feet like a color to polish brass and the voice of his words like the voice of a multitude and I Daniel alone saw the vision for the men that were with me saw not the vision but a great quaking fell upon them so that they fled to hide themselves now this is an interesting scripture because it seems like this angel looks a lot like Christ in Revelation chapter 1 right eyes afire feet is brass right bright is lightening he looks a lot like Christ but it's not Christ and here's why we know that because this angel was not able to break rude to Daniel on his own power he needed help from Michael but Christ would obviously have all power over all the demons right I'm Frank so he has an appearance like Christ the glorified body of Christ but he's not Christ because this angel is actually a hindered you know for 21 days as we'll see in just a little bit so he's a certain man of I so he's an age of the Lord he has all these attributes his voice is a multitude and he came to Daniel a great vision brother Graham said it was the angel of the Lord Daniel only saw the vision this is really great here the men with him felt a quaking and they ran and fled but they did not see the vision this is the separate of st. Paul's experience on the road to Damascus when the men heard the voice but did not see the vision remember that from acts 9 / 7 so it's kind of it's very similar to that they did not see the vision but they heard something now Daniels case they felt something they felt the holy presence they got a quaking of the angel Lord there so they just ran away he Church Tommy against can see the difference between the two kinds of anointing from God you could have one where about said it's a joyful he called it bubble dancing anointing you could have the happiness of the Lord but the other one he said is a fearful anointing which he says you feel like he said those kind of experiences you never get used to right and he said those are experiences that anchor you in God's Word it's a fearful thing right to be in the presence of an angel of the Lord amen so that's the kite daniel has here he has an experience with the angel the Lord a fearful thing here to be in his presence and program said see look Daniel prayed at the angel or hurt him but couldn't get to him for how many days 21 days so the Prophet tells us this is the angel the Lord praise God a man now programs goes on he says when Daniel was down by the river one day he fell into a trance and saw a vision many of those with it they didn't see the vision was given all the Daniel you see it someone can stand right next to you and see things that you can't see to save your life that's right someone said I don't believe that I never seen nothing that's because it wasn't for you to see it that went with Paul when all was stuck for shrug off his horse and Anna thought of the dirt and the Wallower as it was of the dirt none of that hurt the boys have seen the mission Paul saw none of them saw the star that cost every every Observatory but the Wiseman sandai takes it to Jesus did only the wise men saw the star praise God but man says many things are that way because God has designed for certain people to see and others cannot see oh I love that when God has infinite wisdom has predestinated or for Dane for certain things that happen it can happen to the person sitting right next to you and you'll know nothing about it Dana aren't you glad that God showed himself to you may not know other people could have made the service and they they walk out of the service not feeling anything but you were out of walked out and we knew God was in the place amen and our lives were take impacted our lives because there was ordained for us to see what we saw and hear what we heard they met he said now you can imagine how that prophet that haze' felt that sermon I goes the days of Elijah he looked over at him and said why I don't see nobody and he said God opened the boy's eyes and it as soon as God did something here it is get it when God opened his spiritual sight all around there the profit stood chariots of fire dangers of fire why he's seeing why the chariots of fire outnumber that Syrian army by the thousands the mountains was on fire Ainge was a fire horses of fire chariots of fire look about God said just the same tonight I wonder what would happen if a man here tonight has the power to strike across your eyes and say look standing around this Tabernacle tonight you would be a member here the rest of your life oh yeah if we could see the angels around us we'd want to be a member here the rest of our lives because God backs up his word he's not with denominations there are no longer the mouthpiece of God but the mouthpiece of God is the bride of Jesus cry man exactly right yet he said sometimes you can't see it with your hat tries but you can feel the impulse of it something here a sixth sense that denotes something is near in a head now he said they didn't see it he didn't see that first but Elijah probably didn't see it but he asked for the boy's eyes to see it but he liked she was conscious that they were there amen remember good hazus all yet have his eyes kind of open to see all the angels just like here with Daniel just like here was Saint John I'm sorry nothing huh just like here with the wise men right amen and also st. Paul's what it is I said Thomas one times two let me put my hands at his side and she said now you see him will leave how much greater is their reward who's never yet seen and yet believe that's us tonight - whosoever will believe without seeing a man you realize you get a greater blessing tonight you may believe there's angels here that even if you saw the Angels our reward is crater riot because we are just taking God at face value of his word a man Haven we're just taking it at God's eye but bless you more just for believing my written word and Matt out you even see the supernatural reality man exactly right he said more blessed are you to believe what you haven't seen so God's Word I absolutely not there must be angels and caps around all about all amen amen for the character of those who fear the Lord Jesus amen now Daniel verse 8 negative 10 verse 8 their cross up the load and saw this great vision and there remain no strength in me for my Commodus was turned into corruption and I retain no strength yet heard I the voice of his words and when I heard the voice of his words that I was in I was in a deep sleep on my face and my face toward the ground and behold in hand touched me which set me upon my knees and upon the palms of my hands so I just put some notes here Daniel found a deep sleep upon his faith with no strength until I had got you that's very similar to Saint John in Revelation 1 verses 12 to 19 memory pause on his face is dead but Christ Himself came and touched him and he received strength praise God verse 11 huh and he said to the old Daniel a man greatly beloved understand the words that I speak unto thee and stand upright for unto thee have I now sent and when he had spoken this word unto me I stood trembling then he said to me fear not Daniel were from the first day that I was set thine heart to understand and to change myself before thy God thy words were heard and I'm come for thy words what a comfort u.s. church amen heaven love Daniel in a great way aren't you glad the Engel stood trembling and the angel said fear not the angel heard day you are day 1 now it was the age 21 aren't you glad that God hurt you on day 1 you might be on day 365 you might be on day 30,000 you might be on Thursday but God heard your prayer on day 1 amen my man said he did not bring our brother Daniel such a wonderful salutation from God is Oh Daniel greatly beloved program said what did that make you good to think that God loved you if I wasn't crazy loved I just like to know that I'm kind of a little bit loved up there wouldn't you hey bad but the Bible said with great love wherewith he hath loved us so the Bible said he has great love to all his children amen that's exactly right sure he said you think he said just to think he thinks of me once in a while it would just make me watch the screen amen and sorry that heaven thinks a little Jessie sniff that is family oh it makes heaven what it makes us what a scream ahead I think that heaven remembers up Cygnus just to think that he even cares for me and we have the assurance that he does care for us because he said while were yet sinners Christ died in our stead hallelujah program tries encourages hear about the 21-day so he says sometimes you pray I believe Daniel the angel couldn't get to one time he was asking a probably 21 days wasn't it 21 days for if you get there see now if you'd have lost faith they've lost out but you just do exactly what God says do this is his word first the other secondarily a man look what I'm saying the first thing above even a supernatural visitation is the word Emmanuel that's what we need Church that's Loudy that's what we all need we just eat faith in the first thing which is God's right word right then if you get a secondary experience you know you hear a voice you see a vision you have a dream that's wonderful that's just a second identification but all we need is the first one 1980 I meant and he says if you lose faith you Lou Staudt so god help us a persevere of us and never give up that's why we come to the house of God God keeps encouraging us strengthening us stay with it don't doubt don't clear half the side anything that would cause you to turn aside from God's Word and stay with his eternal unfailing word for it will never fail us ain't man hallelujah he's encouraging us don't lose faith and one of these days I want to get to that study that's my next study I think I will not list I would look at the scriptures where it says faint not because we are totally constantly and I punish so faint don't give up don't give up hope don't give up pray don't give up we must not give up we must keep on the firing line and then because as long as it's God's written word God is obligated to his word hallelujah Graham said he cross all heaven earth to make sure one word of his did it fail that's how much he packs up his word other than it's exactly right verse 13 I lost my spot here so pardon me stepping through the Bible lost my spot the Prince of Persia withstood the age of the Lord until Michael one of the chief Prince's came to help the angel the Lord so this angel Lord was withstood he was kind of fighting against so it seems both the age of the Lord at the Prince of Persia were of equal rank in the angel rank they were opposing to be princes Michael was one of the chief Prince's though and his help allowed the angel Lord to come through to Daniel 21 days he wrestled with the Prince of Persia so recall that demons are territorial right he was wrestling the Prince of Babylon though the Prince of Persia was arrested in the Prince of Northwest lling the Prince of Persia because demons are territorial he says and they demons do not even want to leave their own countries remember the demons that were went to the Sligh they said please they told Jesus please don't cast us out of our country and Jesus said fine Jesus can go on the slide see because demons are set down and they like to rule over the place where they are they don't like to lead and brother Branham said demons even have wars amongst themselves see because their kingdoms going to fall our kingdoms not divided our kingdom can never fall right but ze kingdom is going to fall other than a guy man that's exactly right on the 38 now let's go through the quote here where it says in victory day he says we find that because the people do this and cause these great fusses and so forth now see as long as saying controls that there's going to be wars and troubles in war jesus said so in Saint Matthew 24 you'll hear of wars and rumors of wars and Wars of war why because the Prince of the earth the safe and the power of the nations there is a national spirit here at national sphere here it's Devils they can't get along with one another what's our national spirit entertainment right America wants to be entertained make me laugh make me giggle make me excited you do it to me you entertain me you get me to a spot where I'm excited but God but God tells us we've got to die to ourselves amen we can't rely upon entertainment we've got a we've got to get the channel we got to get in preparation we got to create the atmosphere ourselves because we're creators amen amen see that's why we come to church we pray you say God help me to create the atmosphere I'm not here to be entertained by a preacher or a song leader or a piano player I'm here to create an atmosphere on illuminate exactly right I may have said did you ever take a bunch in the Eskimo Eskimo country up there where you go on dog sleds northern Alaska way out there in the northwestern territory when the guy there was tie the dogs off gone Huskies he tied on one here went out there right there I said why you not for said they are so full of the devil they kill one another just kill that's all they think about mothers are there's demons in North America and then demons up in the Eskimo country and now he said the demons even get on animals well he said that's the devil you see he's a killer he's just the nation just even Devils fighting Devils they just fight one another but God is all of see so you can't do nothing but love one another amen see when there's fights and churches see what of this it's Satan getting it because all God wants to do is for us to love each other man so you see the whole principle basis right back against them spirits exactly back to the beginning Genesis is the seed chapter two produces everything then that we have in the earth today not what a striking thought demons body demons right but not only that but then when they angel or once they get through an answer Daniels requests the Prince of Persia so that the chief demon of that Persian Empire he rises up to fight Fortson you're not getting to that prophet of God so fast you're going to go through me and he fought for 21 days until Michael came the Archangel right the Archangel came and helped him out so we could deliver the message to God's prophet see Church there's there's higher principalities there's things going on up above we just need to be patient with the Lord praise God don't get up they should be patient thanks God because there's things going on we can't see we must trust in the unfailing Word of God exactly right now let me get back to Mara at the end of 10 to 13 I like that praise the Lord now verse 13 I didn't read that but the Prince of the kingdom of Persia withstood me one of the twenty days but lo Michael one of the chief Prince's came to help me and I remain there with the kings of Persia so see that you had to get help from Michael now verse 14 Malachi lydic you need some help tonight read it by God's grace now - you read 14 and 15 now I am come to make me understand what shall befall thy people in the latter days we had the vision is for many days and when he had spoken such words into me I set my face toward the ground and I became dumb look just when the angel speaks the word he becomes dumb he becomes powerless just as it just for an angel speaking to him Lydia you read 16 and 17 then I opened my mouth on stage and said that's it before me o my lord by the vision my sorrows are turned upon me and I retreat and go straight for how can a servant of this my lord talk with this my lord press for me straightway there there remain a man verse 18 then there came again and touched me one like the appearance of a man and he strengthened me so we can see the angel or came to help Daniel understand what would happen to Israel in the latter days yet the vision was for many days in the future still hundreds of years and some of them thousands of years because in Chapter 12 we start about or props talking about the tribulation and chapter 11 he hasn't been there about Armageddon now strength and breath left Daniel at the presence and the word this angel but the angel touches Daniel and he gains the strength look at verse 19 I like this this right here shows the power of the spoken word let's look at verse 19 have you ever eaten verse 19 sir and Sam open greatly beloved paradise peace be unto thee be strong yea and be strong and when he had spoken unto me I was strengthened and said this my lord speak for thou has strengthened me David so see how the angel spoken he was fearful so the angel I to say fear not so I wrote you know I'm just writing Daniel breaking below strengthen as the angel spoke be strong showing the power of the spoken word to discuss that as he said be strong he received the strength is that what you feel sometimes with the preaching of the word you just so much preach it and preach it right to your life and while the preaching is going forth it makes you happy and give you strength praise God it gives you courage it gives you the confidence that the Word of God you receive those strength as the word is being spoken to you on about - that's how I felt last Sunday when brother Sammy was preaching to us take that as he preached the word I just received strengthened by the discerning different things going on I was very thankful for that now for the power of the spoken word and then notice of verse 19 now he's ready to listen once he strengthened in the Lord and I'll tell you and I will be when we're strong in the Lord now we can listen to what's being said right but if we come to church tired and worn out and discouraged and and speaking negative and and speaking death rather like we're weak in the faith and we can't receive the Word of God but we've got to be strong praise God I'm going to be able to receive it when we're strong we can hear the word of the Lord it's exactly right amen verse 20 then he said no it's nowhere for him come unto thee and now will I return to fight with the Prince of Persia and when I am gone for lo the Prince of grisha shall come so verse 20 the angel Lord would return to by the Prince of Persia but he also prophesied that Greece would follow Persia as the next Gentile word rule power so let them know that no member Daniel exceed Babylon rise up and Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar and now he's the mid some Medes and Persians right with Darius and now Cyrus but the angel lets him know next is going to come the Grecian Empire that vision I interpreted for Nebuchadnezzar that is going to come next he let them know numbers 21 is the last verse I told you it's going to be a shorter message tonight hard to believe I could preach this short but you want to be mindful verse 21 but I will show thee that which is noted in the scripture of truth and there is none that holds with me in these things but Michael your prince so before the angel the Lord leaves he would show Daniel that which is noted in the scripture of truth in other words this seems to refer to the word that's already recorded in heaven because the Bible said that the Word of God is forever settled in heaven there must be some copy of God's Word somewhere already had it before batik and written on earth right because it's forever settled it's already settled in heaven just as the lamb was already slain the foundation or the mind of God before the foundation of the world all these things have happened beforehand that's right now chapters 11 and 12 are what the angel is going to show Daniel further after a Daniel had fasted and prayed and saw the things of God so you'll see that I should read Daniel 11 and 12 maybe agree that this week you'll see that it's the angel continuing to talk and explain what's going to happen with the Grecian Empire and then of course with the Antichrist spirit I'm sorry the Antichrist person and before he goes or before you guys all goes on to chapter 11 and 12 he says only Michael would hold in these things with the angel or fastener key to these things for some reason that Michael would just help out him in these matters Michael was the one chosen to hold that Prince of Persia aren't you glad God's got angels that stronger than demons aren't you glad you have nothing to fear no matter what demons come your way God's got angels that could overpower me a man just said his angels to get charged over you amen exactly right so in Chapter 11 we'll see the fall of the Persian and Greek Empire since recorded the kings of the north and south brother after the king of the north was Russia and the king of the south at least the history was Egypt at least in history but prophetically I'm not sure and then it goes into the vile person it spends as much of the chapter chapter going through the vow person which is Antiochus which is a type of the Antichrist as we already saw in Daniel chapter 8 remember that one and ends Antiochus then chapter 12 is a very short chapter it's the tribulation the Jewish remnant which are the 144,000 let's save our feet by God's grace I'll stop right there I don't preach about a half hour hey that's the shortest I've ever preached testing right there the grace of the Lord but how did he want to be faithful to the Lord and they want to be able to wait twenty one days I want to be 200 days 2,100 days 90 days we must wait we must remember that God hears us on day number one Amen God is faithful to bring us the revelation of that which we seek for Daniel was seeking memory was fasting he said help me understand this how can understand this 21 days later God helps him to understand the praise God and now we're living in the day with everything that Daniel wrote even if he didn't understand it God has revealed to get to us through the prophet of Malachi 4 amen blessing praise God let's close with a song or two by the grace of the Lord amen trust you were blessed tonight by these things and as you heard and seen praise God let's see God still moves
