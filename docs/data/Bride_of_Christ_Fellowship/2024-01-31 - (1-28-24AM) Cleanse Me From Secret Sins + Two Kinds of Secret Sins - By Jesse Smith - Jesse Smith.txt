========================================

Psalm chapter 19:12 i' like to preach a simple sermon today on cleansing from Secret sins I like to preach on that today uh by God's grace this kind of comes on the uh you know the heels of brother Dennis's message you know uh messages rather how many enjoyed those everybody enjoyed those amen I was so blessed uh listening to those psalm 19:12 so Lord willing will'll look at this thought here this morning and then uh tonight like I said we'll do a a kids Bible study or children's Bible study and I want to share a couple things that are kind of uh important to the message you know like I shared on on uh Sunday or Wednesday there's been another sort of Prophecy that someone's going to be healed um and this group has had other prophecies that have failed um regarding people being healed and so just something I'm watching and I want to be uh cautious of uh you know the same group that calls himself the greatest of all time has had this happen and and you know no doubt we see I you know we've see great testimonies come out of their lives and so forth uh wonderful moves of God but at the same time um just something to watch there I'd like to share that by God's grace so Psalm 19:12 let's read that together if we can on three one 2 3 who can understand his errors cleanse thou me from Secret faults amen May God as his Blessing to reading of his word you may be seated praise God so it's good to be back with the Saints today Hallelujah and very happy again to be in the house of the Lord with all the saints of like Precious Faith every time I'm gone I miss you Saints so I'm I'm really glad to see everybody back together Hallelujah wish looking forward to that one great reunion day when we'll always be together with Jesus and amen we have all eternity and um we'll just have a grand time in the Lord hallelujah I like what the scripture says uh we shall ever be with the Lord I like that I want to spend eternity with the Lord Jesus and of course with you um but we're looking forward to that great great wonderful day by God's grace but here we're fighting the the the the good fight of Faith praise God and God's word always gives us Victory praise the Lord so we're happy to be in the house of the Lord today and like I said I just want to kind of uh preach based off of some of the inspiration that I heard you know from Brother Dennis's sermons I only got to listen to them one time uh you know I got sick on uh Friday so I was sick Friday and a little bit of Saturday you I was so thankful I didn't get sick that whole time you know my my family was sick for about six or eight weeks and I never got sick the whole time but then it came to me on uh Thursday night I tried to rebuke it and I did it it it stayed off a few hours but then it came to me um and then you know had to deal with that but I I recovered so quickly all was I can do is say thank the Lord like I felt like a new person it only last like a day and a half I'm like thank God if I'm going to get sick that's what I want to do just a short sickness but uh God was gracious I know my wife helped me with some herbs and you know all this all this good healing stuff uh so I was very thankful for that uh but if you didn't hear from me the last few days because I've been battling but uh I'm feel much better you know by yesterday night I was back to 100% I feel like myself again amen and so I'm good to be uh I'm glad to be here and Feeling Good by God's grace you I was wondering on Friday am I have to call Simon last minute I going we have to do a tape service or something like that but Jesus really stepped in and helped us out there so I'm thankful for God's Amazing Grace I know you've seen it in your life too you know God God many times would do exceedingly abundantly above all we ask or think praise God and so I count that a blessing today uh just to be with you I count it a real blessing praise God so I want to look at this thought of cleansing from Secret sins and there's there's two aspects as I meditated on this and you know since hearing brother Dennis's sermons I think I put them up I posted them on last Monday if I'm not mistaken or maybe Sunday night I can't remember when I got those actually on there but then I listened to them on Monday morning and I was really blessed and I don't know if you've known it or not I think I told you this but if I didn't I'm sorry but brother Dennis has what we believe is a gift of discernment so remember discernment is judging the secrets and thoughts intents of the heart and there's uh you know that's one of the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit and I talked to them he and I went to Aladdin on Saturday after I picked him up I always take the preachers out to eat but I thought uh I really want to have a good talk with this brother I don't want to take him to Chipotle cuz they got got rap music you know you know sometimes I'm affected by that not all the time but sometimes I'm affected by that I really want to have a good conversation with him so I thought what restaurant can I take him to that doesn't have rock and roll so we went to Aladdin and he noticed it right away Aladdin is actually owned by a Christian at least that location CU my wife and I have talked with him uh he moved over here from uh the Middle East uh maybe eight or 10 years ago and I've told him God bless you and so we had just had a good talk in that atmosphere we both felt the holy Spirit while we were talking amen um and um you know some of the things he preached was what we were talking about on Saturday and then I preach some of those same things on Sunday and grown men grown men in their 50s 60s maybe probably 60s I I don't want I don't want to overestimate their ages but as we were talking we were talking about the Battle of sin and um you know uh putting down a stake in your in your spiritual land and saying I know God's given me this much Victory uh as far as even with the baptism of the Holy Ghost or any any spiritual blessing you've attained you know uh he and I were talking about that and uh and brother Den was like wow that's good and I my brother Bram said that and everything and uh so then when I was preaching on Sunday you know I felt led to preach that uh you know how Christians can have such Victory but then will fall short in a secret sin right like brother Brandon fell short with the critical spirit and I just went through some of those things while preaching that you know Paul said he said he did things he hated now Paul wouldn't reveal to us what sins they were he just said they were hateful sins so you don't have to confess and tell everybody all the details of your hateful sins just be honest right and say i' I've sinned yes um we know Peter you know uh of course the the the the segregation there between Gentiles we see his sin well no doubt he hated that but as I preach that you know you know the Holy Spirit kind of led me in that direction and uh just put a state down put a spiritual Mark and and remember God did this in my life and I've experienced such Victory here amen you know and let's not forget what God has done hallelujah don't forget where God has brought you from praise God Amen and You Know The Enemy will try to drive you back from that place where you've achieved you know brother Ram says footsteps are possession you know testimonies are are possession amen but then the enemy tries to drive you back remember it's a it's a constantly taken ground right it's a you take ground the enemy tries to push you back but you got to possess that you got to get back what you had and then take more ground amen amen and so just as I you know as brother Dennis and I talked about that I just saw how the Holy Spirit brought some of those same thoughts and then a brother would come up after his name's Andy there and he would come up and say brother Jesse I just needed to hear that actually two brothers told me that even brother Irvin and Brother Andy said all week I've been battling that I you know the devil's been tell me you don't have what you said you have and you're not even saved or you're not even forgiven and how could you do this and how could you do that and they were crying you know they were just weeping and and just thanking the Lord that uh that God had brought this word in here the word that you know uh the scripture tells us plainly that the footsteps of the righteous are order of the Lord right and then God God forgives all of our transgressions hallelujah amen and how God totally takes away all of our sin hallelujah amen as soon as we confess it it's abolished brother BR said it's like ink being put in a a bottle of bleach praise God and he said it breaks up and it goes back to what it was at the beginning but brother Adam says when Jesus uh died for all of our sins all that sin went back on Satan Hallelujah because he's the father of it all Hallelujah he said all that sin is broken up all your mistakes all your sins has been broken up and it's gone back to the one who caused all of it Satan Hallelujah the father of lies and so it was just very very special for me to see you know some of the things we talked about there in in our just our little Fellowship there and uh what was uh was was things that the Holy Spirit used to encourage these two brothers and I know the brothers both in their 60s and you know think about that I'm they're 60 years old and battling am I really forgiven or am I saved and we've all had those moments like the dark Seasons where uh Satan brings in all the questions are you sure you've done this are you sure God has done this for you are you sure of this are you sure of that but how God's word comes around to show us that we are more than conquerors in Christ Jesus amen that means we have more than more surpassing victories that's what that more than conquer means we have surpassing victories see we have victories but then we have victories beyond that that surpass some other victories praise God it means we have continual victories amen Victory after Victory Faith from Faith from glory to glory the light shining more unto a perfect day Hallelujah so I love to see how the Holy Spirit you know moves upon us and brother Dennis said he just had me on his heart back in December he's like I just want to reach out to brother Jesse and fellowship with him and that's when I was like I was like brother I've said so many times I'm going to invite you and I keep forgetting so I said I know this is God's will for you to come and how many believe it was God's will to hear him preach praise God Amen so I just rejoice in that I love how God orchestrates it so I'll send you out the dates but I asked him to come back and preach our anniversary services in June that'll be our 18th Church anniversary so I want brother Dennis to preach that by God's grace but just keep that in mind you know when brother you know people said that about brother Diggs and brother uh uh brother McBride and it works on both ends as long as we're living Sanctified then God's gifts can operate and as long as the preacher is living as Sanctified as possible then those gifts operate so that ought have been in good encouragement that people are living pure before God am Hallelujah if you saw uh God's spirit operate there through brother Dennis and you know your heart in life was discerned or like I told you when Simon came the one time I I texted him nine discernments of my heart in one sermon on a Wednesday night God God don't care if it's Wednesday night or Sunday morning amen God just wants people that are hungry for the word of God hallelujah amen and so you know we know if we if we if we trust in the Lord with all of our hearts and lean not on our own understanding then God uh you know God will direct our paths praise God and he will discern you know our our lives for for us so I got this you know thought from that uh sermon he preached the morning of course the evening was more the same but I just found in studying this that there's two types of secret sins I don't know if you found this in the scripture but I found this in my sec I'm sorry my searching the scriptures because you know church I told you this numerous times but I've always prayed this Lord please let my sins just be between you and I well I never realized until brother Dennis preached that what does that mean that means I'm going going to battle my secret sins does everybody understand like I want to live so close to Christ that nobody can see me sin now I know it's not possible but I want to get as close as I can Hallelujah where people just see he's a Godly brother he loves the Lord and he's walking in the with the Lord that's just my request I want people to look at me and I want to be a city on a hill that cannot be hidden I want to shine for Jesus Christ amen you understand saying but I I realized after we preach that wow every sin I have is a secret sin then in most cases now my family could probably see some of my shortcomings I get upset or frustrated or not as patient as I should be I hope I'm not angry with my children too much you know with with sinful anger I hope not uh but I just you know I just realized that after we preached that I'm like I have secret sins in other words that nobody knows about like Paul had right right like he didn't tell any he didn't tell us all the details but then brother Dennis brought out the secret sins of aen right wasn't that his text yes and brother R preach about preached about that of course in adoption part one uh 1960 and how it relates there uh to the believer and so I realized that there's two types of secret sins and then we read where David David a man after God's Own Heart where he had secret sins but wasn't he saved brother Jess yes wasn't he a man after God's Own Heart didn't he please God yes but he had secret sins as well now some of them came out you know the Bible says I read a few weeks ago in Chronicles the Bible said the only one that God recognized was the sin of bash Sheba and Uriah the Bible said David did all that was right think about that all a l David did all that was right except in the area of basheba I thought wow what Amazing Grace that's a kind of Grace I want God to have on my life amen amen you only you I mean think about that you sinned every day but I'm really only fell short in one area I don't I don't know how to explain that church but all I know is that's what God's word said hallelujah amen but but I found that there then there's there these two types of secret sins they secret sins of those who are worthy of judgment okay like achen there secret sins that are worthy of judgment as we'll show a little bit ananas and saf that's it's also a new testament thing as well there's secret sins that are worthy of judgment we'd say done by Sinners but then there's secret sins done by Saints which uh lead us to more sanctification or a pure heart a more Pure Heart okay and so this is what Paul talked about I'm just going to rehearse these real briefly um in Romans 7 I'm just going to rehearse this because I preached on this a few weeks ago Paul said in Romans 7:15 15 I do the things I hate but what I hate is what I do so that that's what you and I our secret sins when we have secret sins we hate that we do it but Paul said it's sin within me that does it he said it's no more I that does it but sin that dwelleth Within Me Hallelujah so these are the secret this is the elements of secret sin that we have to battle Paul said in Romans 7:23 I come into captivity to my sin I become a slave to my secret sins right so as I preach that Wednesday night we we we all come into a prison of our our own sin we we put ourselves in a prison to our sin now for how long that depends how long we want to enjoy the the pleasures of sin right but as soon as we want to get out God offers a way out hallelujah amen Paul says it I I come into captivity he says and then he calls himself in Romans 7:24 he said oh Wretched Man that I am so he recognized I have two parts to me I have a part of me that cannot sin the soul but I have a part of me that that sins and a wretched part of me a hateful part of me a part that I become a slave to sin and then he says he finishes the chapter I thank God through Jesus Christ amen what a way to end the chapter amen I thank God through Jesus Christ that I'm able to overcome this and then he tells us in the next chapter there's no condemnation because I walk after the spirit spirit and not the flesh amen so there we get the New Testament Foundation of having secret sins sins that we hate we do yet we can still overcome them by the grace of Goden Hallelujah now I want to get just share this thought briefly here I just want to spend maybe a minute on this thought but I look forward to God giving me more Revelation on this and and the thought is the death penalty question God gave aen the death penalty but he didn't give it to Cain did you ever think of that so I just I'm I'm I'm in one way I'm excited for God to show me the revelation of this at some point hopefully in the future God did not kill Cain and God even let him have a mark as the mark of the beast a prefigure of the mark of the beast right he had a physical Mark of the spiritual reprobate soul that he had interesting right but then uh but then of course you know he lets other Sinners live their entire lives out like Ahab or even Jezebel he lets these Sinners live such long lives but then he'll give the death penalty to aen for stealing we'd say just stealing now there's never a there's never a a uh there's never a a pass for any sin right but he stole clothes and a wedge of gold was it for just stealing you know gold and clothes he gets the immediate death sentence plus some of his family members because they knew of his sin so I just you know I'm looking to God to understand this here you know God would let Cain live but then he would take ain's life and his family he would let Cain live but then he would take ananas and saf's life for one lie because he said Satan has filled your heart to lie to the Holy Ghost so I don't know you know is that the Revelation when when someone gets filled with Satan does then God judge them and take them off the scene I don't know but one thing's for sure we want to confess our sins as soon as possible right we do not want to become workers of iniquity right uh the Bible said uh God will in John 15 God will Purge us and so if if we get purged like the pruning business that Malachi and Lydia are familiar with they're just going to have less branches for a while less branches but more branches will come amen and it will actually make you more fruitful amen and normally they're pruned in the season after harvest so you and I will get pruned and it'll seem like we have less fruit but God's in it all and God's going to bring you to a more fruitful season hallelujah amen amen so we're have seasons where we're going to look and say well it looks like I don't have as much fruit as I used to have but yet you did you know God uh gave you fruit to your life you have testimonies for your life is what I'm saying but you're going to go through Seasons where it seems like there's not as much testimony but friends be encouraged because God's a god of Seasons hallelujah amen God's a god of restoration Hallelujah God's a god of more fruit praise God more victories Hallelujah God's in that business but he's got to he's got to prune us hallelujah to bring forth more fruit and then what about Herod in Acts 12 Herod talks and one day and they say he's like a God and God smites him the angel Lord smites him dead right there how come he didn't get Grace like Cain got right so it's just interesting you know some secret sins God will have it seems like God just pours out that Swift judgment other times you know the Bible and even Judas for three and 1/2 years he had all that secret sin of being a thief and God let him go for three and a half years until Satan filled his heart right and then he went off and sold Jesus and then he went off and hung himself so just uh it's it's striking uh to think of these things and as Christians we should always ask for Mercy praise God ask Mercy on ourselves trust in the mercy that we've received with and also ask Mercy for our friends and loved ones that God maybe perhaps could use us to share God's word with them to bring them to repentance praise God Amen because none of us want to see anyone taken off the scene prematurely right we all want to see people come to the Saving Grace we know not all will be saved but I feel like God would place as it as it were if we're Abraham I believe God would would Place Lots in our lives praise God where God would remember our prayer the Bible said God remembered the prayer of Abraham praise God God remembered that high that Priestly prayer of Abraham amen and we're Kings and Priests unto God hallelujah God remembered the prayer of his priest Hallelujah because a priest is an intercessor between God and man Hallelujah and that's where God's placed us as priests between the living and the dead praise God Amen so I'm looking for more Revelation on that why does God sometimes let him go and then remember the said some men's sins go before them others a others men's sins await them at the Judgment in other words there's so many judases out there that can hide their sins and we don't really see it yeah but all everything will be made known on that day brother R said that and the Bible says it too the fiery eyes of Jesus will burn through any uh pretending and there will no no one be able to hide anything from Jesus on that day the Bible says he's got eyes of Fire fire so my prayer is Lord show me my secret faults now praise God cleanse me of my secret faults now like David said Hallelujah cleanse me now Purge me now let my purging be be in my lifetime praise God Amen so I don't have to be purged later during the tribulation or something like that but God let me be purged now for my secret faults hallelujah amen oh my so I hope you can see those those two thoughts here we have secret sins that lead to IM mediate judgment on this Earth but then the believer has secret sins that God is merciful upon there secret sins that judgment gets poured out but Believers have secret sins God shows mercy and I'm very grateful for God's mercy Hallelujah each person would be Hallelujah and I just want to look at that David thought you know a lot of these verses were written through the holy or by the Holy Spirit through David uh in 1st Samuel 134 14 uh Saul had disobeyed the Lord and uh Samuel said but now thy kingdom shall not continue the Lord has sought him a man after his own heart and the Lord hath commanded him to be Captain over his people because thou has not kept that which the Lord commanded thee so I love this before David even slays Goliath before David is even King God already recognizes him as a man after his own heart in other words God had four knowledge that David would love God hallelujah amen just like job God sees you in your perfect condition hallelujah amen God sees you as a Believer forgiven as a Son of God hallelujah God sees you in that finished condition praise God Amen even before the victories or even before the failures right even before that God sees you as a child of God just like God told Jeremiah I ordain you a prophet to the Nations Hallelujah before I form you in the womb I knew you praise God that means he knew my faults he knew my good he knew my bad but he still knew I was his son he still knew you were his daughter hallelujah amen he still knew that praise God this was all for known by I love how God chooses to look at the positive and not the negative amen praise the lord lord Psalm 25 verse 7 if you pull that up there did you ever see this I heard a preacher preach this the other day I was like unbelievable uh Psalm 257 remember not the sins of my youth this is a Psalm of David nor my transgressions according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness sake oh Lord now you can apply leave this up here just a moment you can apply this numerous ways he could mean his youth you know from a child or a teenager or just you know a young man man even you know let's say David I think he died what was it 80 I forget he he reigned 40 years 70 good okay was it 30 years he was 30 years old when he became king and he reigned 40 years yes 70 good bless your heart so died at 70 so he might have wrote this and thought about well when I was 30 or when I was 50 when I committed that with bash was around 50 or 55 the midlife crisis and uh but I like this he's a man after God's Own Heart but he still had his past would sometimes come back to haunt him the devil would bring up all those things that God already forgave and the church said I love what David said but God never saw that right now God wasn't going to remember that but I like how he even prayed it he said Lord remember not my sins of my youth now he was a child the B he's the one that even wrote a man sorry uh in in sin my mother conceived me in other words that sin nature passed from my mother and father into me I always had a sin nature I've always sinned so even this man after God's Own Heart you know he a sinned as a child now we picture David out there as a shepherd and he's singing and praying the whole time but sometimes he maybe said some bad words to those sheep I don't know maybe he despised that his dad we know his dad was was against him maybe despise his dad yeah right maybe you speak against your parents right now children don't say Amen but I'm sure at some point you upset with your parents why did my dad do this why did my mom do that but David said Lord forgive me of those things amen amen because you can't help it that sin Nature's uh it's already in you it's the part of us we hate it's our biggest enemy that's but we also got our biggest Victory on the inside as well Hallelujah the spirit of God Amen amen amen but I love this God calls him a man after for his own heart and yet he had a sinful youth just like you did no different just like all of us we have this in other words we have secret sin even as a child or teenager right as a teenager David slays Goliath and now they're singing songs to him you ever think you got a little pride in there maybe maybe when was the last time somebody sang songs about you Austin has slayed his 10, thousands you know I'll just put your name in there but Hosea slain his 10,000 I mean there had to be at some point some type of sin because the Bible said we sin every day right but he was able always to confess his sins amen he's always able to say God please don't remember my sinful youth hallelujah amen so he would had have sins before he defeated the bear he would had sins before he defeated the line so Church take that as an encouragement praise God God will forget your past and then he'll give you victories in the present hallelujah hallelujah the thing to do is forget your past amen put your past behind you confess it and take God at his word and now fight the good fight of Faith hallelujah amen amen David had to do that he had to have sins in his life but he said Lord do not remember them hallelujah amen and if God forgave them under the blood of bulls and goats how much more us gracious Hallelujah according to thy mercy remember thou me for thy goodness sake oh Lord remember a sinner saved by grace why so I can magnify your goodness amen so I can talk tell others about the goodness of God amen I will sing of the goodness of God Amen all my life he's been faithful that's what David is saying here Lord forgive my past don't remember my youthful sins and everyone will tell everyone will hear me tell of your goodness to me amen the Lord Psalm 32 verse1 if you put that up there some more scriptures about the blessedness of God a Psalm of David Mill m chill I can't know how to say that one blessed is he whose transgression Is Forgiven whose sin is covered now that was covered on the blood of bulls and goats but now it's abolished like the law could only cover sin it would hide your sin but now the sin's already been paid for amen and it's been sent away Glory blessed is the man whom the Lord imputeth not iniquity who wrote this David and in whose Spirit there is no pretending or guile hallelujah amen blessed is man I'm sorry yeah we'll stop right there so David's the one that wrote this God has blessed those those whose sins he covers over it's a blessing that God forgives our sins that person if we could think of a word what would you call them favored highly favored David said I'd call them blessed amen that's how you name a a forgiven son or daughter of God call them the blessing of the Lord hallelujah Psalm 654 H Psalm 654 blessed is the man whom thou chooses and caus us to approach unto thee that he may dwell in thy courts we shall be satisfied with the goodness of thy house even of thy Holy Temple I love this just like I share with that Junction City I didn't choose to go to them God chose me to go to them I just I just like these reminders from God that I didn't choose God God chose me and if God chose me then he allowed me to come before him praise God and if God chose me like he chose David then God is only going to look at my good parts amen God's going to forgive all my bad parts because he chose me praise God here's another one about choosing Psalm 9412 blessed is a man whom thou chastenest it's a blessing for God to rebuke me amen it's a blessing when God spanks me in my secret sins God sends Dennis McBride to spank us or you understand any service right where you'd be corrected how many appreciate the correction of the Lord blessed is the man whom thou chasen us oh Lord and teaches him out of thy law amen the word of Teach Me Lord if I'm wrong show me in the word how I can get the victory praise God verse 13 that thou mayest give him rest for the from the days of his adversity I've gone through many days of Trials I fought this sin very long time it's been a battle with this secret sin but give me rest from that day of adversity praise God give me a season of Grace give me a season of Joy Hallelujah give me a fresh start Hallelujah give me rest from all these trials amen until the pit be digged for the wicked Lord take care of this enemy take this evil spirit away from me right but we got the authority many times to tell Satan get behind me right we've got Authority many times so we're blessed to be called We're Blessed to be forgiven uh we're we're blessed to be chosen by God and we're blessed to be corrected by God remember David repeated this in Romans 4:4 now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of Grace but of debt we don't earn our salvation but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justifieth the ungodly his faith is counted for righteousness see just believing that God has forgiven me that's righteousness now you've got faith that you just believe God forgave you because God said he would you just believe God's grace you believe in God's mercy that's what brings salvation not because you worked and you did something but because you accepted God at his face value of his Worden amen verse six even as David also describeth the blessedness of this man unto whom God imputeth righteousness without works amen wow so David said God gives you righteousness without any of your Works amen wow Malachi you really did all these wonderful works and on the piano and all these other works that that must be why you're righteous no you got righteousness just because you believe God forgives you you just believe God you take God at his word amen amen and then you show your appreciation then you're zealous for good works because of the goodness God has shown you praise God verse 7 saying blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven and whose sins are covered blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin oh my amen hallelujah amen I want to read this one again let's go to John chapter 8 I'd read this and shared this with a friend it just struck me as real sweet no it's not John 8 it's the woman caught in the act of adultery John is it john8 okay I thought see I was looking at the end of the chapter beginning it's the beginning amen yes thank you I appreciate that son thank you Hallelujah you know just remember this you know years ago I preach this Revelation I remember specifically you know we just moved into our house there in DL toown and I thought what is the revelation of God Jesus stooping twice and I waited all day on God for this Revelation brother Austin I sat there I remember I paced back and forth in our bedroom it was upstairs where the girls you know Haven I just paced back and forth God what is the Revelation stooping and then the song came to me stooping to woo to win to save my soul MH there was two stooping of the son of man the son of man stooped and the word became flesh in the life of Jesus Amen but brother R said that son of man gift was not shown to the Gentiles only the Jews and Samaritans got it glory amen this is one of those amazing Revelations I got to put on the video but he stooped again brother Ram said in order for God to be fair and just he he had to come as son of man again in the ministry of brother bradam amen so he stooped down and he expressed himself he wrote on the earth the word expressed itself on the earth hallelujah amen oh it's a beautiful type hallelujah amen and he spoke to the woman he spoke to the church hallelujah amen so see that the woman the woman caught adultery types the church how she was adultery to Christ but as Christ comes the second time here in the light in the ministry of brother Bram he tells her uh in verse 10 woman where are thine accusers hath no man condemned thee Glory now she had all these condemners but then Jesus said well who's worthy to condemn which of you have not sinned I imagine remember the oldest the wisest they're the ones that Dro their Stones first in other words the longer we live the the more we know how much we fall short of of God's glory right the more we're aware wow I really am a sinner saved by grace I'm not the prim and proper and perfect Christian I used used to think I was I was telling the brothers there in Junction City one time I said at one time in my Christian Life I had so much Zeal for God I thought I would never have like any secret sins and I said boy did I get a a reality check I thought well I'd never do this or I'd never do that and I didn't realize it was a little pride now there's still minor sins brother man said if you have if you do major sins you're not born again the Holy Ghost will keep you from major sins but little minor things I thought I'd never do I find myself doing them and the Lord had to Humble me so the older I get the more I realize I need God's grace so the woman so when Jesus says who's worthy to judge all the accusers leave and the woman's just left with her and Jesus that's how we got to see ourselves today we got to remember all these demon lies and all this mind battle we got to we got to remember they cannot accuse they're not the judge amen they don't have the final say hallelujah they're not worthy to judge us or anything like that in fact Jesus Will cast all those thoughts away Jesus will help us have victory over all these mind battles all these lies all these accusations and we've got to get to the spot where it's just us and Jesus Hallelujah amen and she said no man Lord is that how you feel nobody can accuse you today hallelujah amen that's how we should feel right and Jesus said to her neither do I condemn thee go and sin no more a woman who just a few moments ago was caught in the act of adultery Jesus says I don't condemn you now that shows the power and the swiftness of God's forgiving Grace hallelujah oh just minutes before before adulter adulter going to hell can't inherit the kingdom of God and then a few minutes later Jesus said I forgive you you can be part of the kingdom of God hallelujah oh my Amazing Grace How Sweet the Sound amen and saved a wret like me Hallelujah why because the son of man souped a second time Hallelujah he magnified himself he come down to earth and expressed the word of God on the the earth oh it's a beautiful thing and this this of course is before the cross right before the blood was actually shed and Jesus was already forgiving this way even before the blood was shed Hallelujah and so this is a good text here church if you just did a sin a few hours before church God has already forgiven you if you confessed it and he would not hold it against you you must have the desire though to sin no more right go and sin no more am Hallelujah and that's the joy of the Christian it's also sometimes the Mind Battle of a Christian but that's the joy of a Christian even no matter what I did before service or no matter what I did this week if I confess it and I really tell Jesus I'm sorry that he's faithful and just to forgive me of all unrighteousness amen and it proves right there pulled out of the bed of adultery I wonder how much clothes she had on but Jesus say I don't condemn you oh my Hallelujah she must have been a a forn daughter of God hallelujah blessed is one whom thou forgive us whose iniquities are covered hallelujah amen oh it's amazing grace How Sweet the Sound let's get to our our text in Psalm 19 I didn't know how long this was going to be I thought well this my might be a short sermon but you never know with me you never know uh Psalm 197 I think I preached two hours last Sunday to The Junction City Saints it felt like five minutes I thought oh I'm getting my strength back now I could preach three hours sometime no Psalm 19 verse 7 so our text was in verse 12 but I just I looked at this chapter I thought wow what a beautiful chapter to see what what leads David up to write this and church this is what should lead us up to believe God the the perfectness of God's word in other words our our our uh our thoughts of God are so high you know uh we admire God so much our admiration for Jesus his majesty is so great it should make us want to cleanse Our Lives am like that brother preached at the youth meeting you know uh what's the cure for loneliness I still want to preach a sermon on this but it's just fellowship with the greatest being in the entire universe that's SEC cure for loneliness that he would stoop down there it is he stop down and spend time with me in my prayer time or my whever I'm whenever I'm fellowshipping with him that the King of Kings amen and the Lord of lords would spend time with me Hallelujah like that song brother amen sings how do I know cuz I talk to him today how do I get rid of loneliness how do I get rid of my trials how do I overcome this I talk to the king Hallelujah I talk to Jesus today praise God I showed him all my troubles all my sorrows praise God I'm feeling pretty good amen I've got sweating already by God's grace I thought well I'm sick I don't know how hard I'll be able to preach but I'm preaching pretty normal today the law of the Lord is perfect converting the soul the testimony of the Lord is sure making wise the simple see we were just simple Sinners right foolish but God makes us wise through his word the statues of the Lord are right rejoicing the heart see we had some we had some dancing on Wednesday night sorry I forgot to put that sermon public so I'm sorry if you want to go back and listen to that I'm sorry I forgot to make that public after preaching that on on Wednesday I'm just like I just can't preach that and not dance I can't I can't preach that and not praise the Lord and one of our girls was praying Lord let us have a dance service so God was working on both ends there Hallelujah I I I I can't go through these words and not rejoice that's right Hallelujah God God's done all this for me and I'm not going to thank him for what he's done I've gotta I've got to thank God look what he's done praise God the statues of God Rejoice the heart the Commandment of the Lord is pure enlightening the eyes so now we can we with with the purity of the Holy Ghost we can see situations perfectly amen right and we see we see you know these people are like our church we you know we see this these people are real Christians here we fall short of God's glory but we can see their purity they want to do what's right they want to serve God Amen but we've seen people come in and they haven't had that Purity because they get pulled back into the things of the world right and so some of their words and some of their songs or some of their testimonies they weren't in all real sincerity right because it's the purity of God that enlightens our eyes to really see what's in people's hearts amen the fear of the Lord is clean I like that enduring forever the judgments of the Lord are true and righteous all together so this is this is what David's saying leading up to this thought about secret sins wow god is perfect God converts my soul he's sure he makes me wise he's right he rejoices in my heart he's pure he's clean his words endure forever he's true he's righteous more to be desired are they than gold this Bible is more valuable than gold that's right and the church said if only a realized that right he took the wedge of gold this is more valuable than gold Hallelujah yay much than much fine gold sweeter also than honey and the honeycomb moreover by them is thy servant warned so he considered a privilege to be warned by God I love that in other words I don't want to I don't want to be sailing toward a cataract a a waterfall and not be warned I want God to warn me praise God Amen that's like does the Bible say something about sudden destruction I don't want to come upon sudden destruction I want God to warn me and that would be a sign that he loves me praise God hallelujah that'll be a real sign that God loves me that he will keep me from falling amen they'll keep me from falling Hallelujah that would be God's love to his servant and in keeping of them there is a great reward you know one time just on that warning thought after I did the debate against the the believe the sign people they did a video mocking me saying oh Jesse's just warning them Jesse's just warning the homosexuals he's just warning the trans people and they mocked me for that but then come to find out now another one of them uh another one that's left the message now they're accepting nonbinary people so trans people and they're they're they're they're rejoicing in that now see what happened Church they didn't take heed to the warning God can only warn people so many times right but I'm like David I'm so thankful God has warned me these pure words amen now if that ain't proof these people are wrong then nothing will nothing will convince them and I'll just say this you know a lot of these people that leave the message they were in churches that were not filled with the Holy Ghost that's the trouble right they and those churches give the message a bad name but it's churches like that give it the right name praise God amen hallelujah amen thank God he warns us and if we keep the word of God there's great rewards Hallelujah like the Bible said in this life and in the Life to Come praise God like I told you that one time last summer I made these awful Financial mistakes breaking you know breaking my vehicles and everything I just cry out to God and somebody uh somebody put it on their heart to send me a certain amount of money that paid for all of it and I didn't have this money laying around I just I looked at it as it's a great reward for just obeying God it's a great reward like just taking heed of God's warnings there's so many benefits to serving the lord Hallelujah so after all this magnification of God's word is fine it's pure it's holy it warns me it keeps me then he says Lord who can understand his HS sometimes I can't even understand why I sin the way I do am I the only one that can say Amen to that David said who can understand his HS that happen to me so many times I'll say brother all I say why did I say that what what where did I get that from that wasn't me that was that inside of me why and it's a reminder to repent and then say Lord set a guard before my lips Hallelujah put the Holy Ghost there with the sword of the spirit praise God and don't let evil out only let good come out praise God who can understand I love the I love the word so much I love all these things about God's word it's so it's converted me all these things but I can't understand why I do these things cleanse me thou from secret or hidden faults isn't that something the Bible said we can be mature be therefore perfect now how you don't have to raise your hand but how many here have ever loved somebody that was an enemy that if you did that showed you're a mature Christian but even being a mature Christian you have faults that you can't understand right so I just want to balance that out you can be mature sure but then still have sins and faults that you're ashamed of because that's how David was that's how Paul was if anybody was mature it was the first church age messenger yes because all other Church ages are judged by Paul that's right it reminds me of Moses how God told Moses I'll destroy them and I'll start with you but God told Paul I saved you from the depths of sin but I'm making you the pattern praise God the pattern of Grace and everybody will be judged by your gospel you don't change it either my it's beautiful my cleanse me from Secret faults and remember Jesus said I don't have the scripture in front of me maybe one of you can find it but he said where do all these sins come he said they come from within a man it's not that what goes into the body that defiles the man it's what's already in the man that defiles him remember that scripture so that's what David's saying I love the word it it's converted me I'm a not for us to be I'm a holy ghost filled Saint the word of God has power in my life but lord I can't understand my error sometimes cleanse me wash me from my secret faults verse 13 keep back thy servant also from presumptuous sins whoever look who knows what that word does anybody know I didn't know till today now I might have preach it I might have forgot who knows what presumptuous means proud or arrogant see sometimes we think we just know it all well I'm just going to do this because I'm I'm I'm such a strong person in other words I'm going to do this I don't even have to ask God about it I can just do this because I know all about it it or I'm God's gift to the world I'm the greatest of all time or I'm the greatest believer in akan or I'm the greatest believer in albian or Iowa or Napoleon you know he said keep me from proud or arrogant sins now for us it's judging others many times without having Mercy yes right I've seen that in my life a critical spirit right critical spirit he said cleanse me from my secret things that are in here but keep me also from prideful sins where I think I'm better than anybody as far as like for salvation right because we know there's a wise and foolish virgin and I even had a guy tell me that this week on the on the on the uh comments on YouTube he was condem he was trying to condemn me oh you're you're angry and you make Angry comments I said sir when did you start a YouTube channel and when have you when have you had debates with people for 10 years he said you're right you're more righteous than me that's the same thing Samuel said to Saul Saul said David is more righteous than you Saul right so in some ways we are going to be more righteous than the foolish virgin right we're going to obey more of the word of God but we can't let that go to our head we can't allow that to make us stop seeking God we must stand seek ye first the kingdom of God hallelujah and his righteousness I love what that verse said in 2 Corinthians I think it's 6:14 Paul said renew my mind day by day am that means church we need a brand new mind starting today amen well Jesse when can I get a new mind today is a great day for that Paul said each day he said you must take up the cross day daily and follow me amen that's right Die daily he said be renewed in the spirit of your mind be renewed every day hallelujah amen keep me Lord from arrogant sins let them not have dominion over me in other words don't let me get addicted to these things and the church said yes uh can I say like this Lord help me not to get a complex can I say like that right God keep me from complexes then shall I be upright and remember Church the Bible says that the Bible says that you know when we confess our sins we have confidence with God right amen right that God will hear us amen the times we prayed and God has answered well the only way that could happen is if the people both the the the seeker and the preacher or whoever's praying the sisters whoever's praying they had to have confidence with God they had had to have all the sins confessed walking in humility but walking in the boldness of the Holy Spirit praise God Amen see he says let them not have dominion over me I'll be upright I'll be innocent from the great transgression now remember he was going to commit a great transgression but he says Lord you can keep me from becoming arrogant where I get so arrogant that I commit sins and then I do something really awful now how many want that as your testimony I want that testimony cleanse me from Secret sins that are inside of my my mind I'd say and the S the sinful part of My Flesh and then Lord don't let Pride have dominion over me where I do a great transgression that's what we're going to get I'm going to show that tonight that's what I think's happening with a lot of preachers they get so pride and arrogant over the years that they'll speak speak things and it doesn't happen but what is it are they still saved I believe they are but it's a great transgression just like David and Solomon right these great transgressions and yet that God and yet God will say he's a man after my own heart verse 14 let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh Lord my strength and my redeemer I remember this couple I think cam was here the last time I remember cam preaching on this he showed a scripture where David said I will Delight in the word of the Lord all the day long amen I even challenged the Bible club kids I said when was the last time you thought about God all day I said I'm not telling you not to pay attention to your teacher you got to pass those tests but I mean you know pay attention but always know God's going to help me pay attention God's helping me remember these facts so I can pass the test all of our students in the back God's going to help you with your test just pray before the test amen hallelujah and I I challenge you that's a that's a heart after God's Own Heart that's David David's heart was L was saying Lord I want to think about you all day throughout all my ups and downs of the day the good times the bad times I want to Delight in the word of God your word rejoices my heart amen oh hallelujah praise the Lord now I want to share a little bit about this achan thought I may preach a uh a separate sermon on this this might be a part one might have a part two this achan effect is interesting I liken it unto the Solomon effect the Solomon syndrome as you get old got to make sure you don't backslide on God like Solomon did as he got older all these he let all these wives turn his heart away from the Lord but the achan effect is secret sin that causes God to put a judgment on your life now I don't know how much this applies I can see it clearly apply in the in the Corinthian Church let's read that 1 Corinthians 11 I mentioned this times but just now think about this in the light of what brother Dennis preached to us verse 27 1 Corinthians 11:27 wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the Lord unworthy shall be guilty of the body and blood of the Lord but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthy eateth and drinketh Damnation to himself not Discerning the Lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep okay so many people died in their church because they didn't treat each other the right way so that's the achan effect right there was sin in the church they didn't take care of it in other words when somebody offended them they didn't go talk to them about it they just talked to somebody else about it if somebody offends you go talk to them about it right don't talk to somebody else about it go to that individual right but here we can see the a achan effect and then many got weak and sickly you know think about all the people they'd go to pray for maybe they had a stomach sickness or maybe they had a bronchitis a brother in the Corinthian Church you know uh can I pray for you and they pray and pray and pray and nothing would happen because they have unconfessed sin oh God he our sister he our brother but God won't do it until they confess their sins amen they're hiding something in their life they ought to confess Hallelujah you know many many times people can't Rejoice or dance or shout or sing because they've got unconfessed sin oh but if you've confessed all your sins you can have joy in the house of the Lord today Hallelujah CU you know God doesn't hold anything against you it's all been forgiven hallelujah amen amen that's why all these people all these men addicted to pornography that's why they can't raise their hands in sin that's why they can't worship they can't get excited about the word of God because they live under condemnation oh God cleanse them from Secret sin hallelujah amen amen hallelujah and put your emotions put your desires and passions God just emailed me yesterday he said how can I get victory over this I said look at Jesus if you just fall in love with Jesus all these things will pass away Hallelujah the filth and the destruction and the wickedness will all pass away away Turn Your Eyes On Jesus look forward his wonderful face hallelujah look at Jesus for a while go read the book of Hebrews he was made like unto a man but he was close to an angel look at his Beauty look what look look what his blood did look at him he's the high priest now he can be touched by the feeling of your Temptation Hallelujah that's right get your eyes on Jesus one time like I told another brother years ago he's like how do I overcome this I said go get in the presence of God I didn't have to give him a list of 50 things to do go repent and go get in God's presence and we sense the Holiness of Jesus and you draw n to God God will draw n to you Hallelujah so this achin effect now what's interesting as I was I think I was talking to Cas about this on Wednesday night we can see the aen effect in the Corinthian Church and also the galatian church because Paul said oh foolish Galatians who hath Bewitched you they were under demonic influence to try to bring the law back into Grace and Paul says I'm glad or no Paul says I may have to come there and birth you again and make sure you guys really got the Holy Ghost see because Holy Ghost F people don't do legalism the church said amen some might have to birth you again making all these laws and rules that aren't in the Bible now not in the Bible what was interesting though uh this one I shared with AAA you know the achan effect didn't impact uh the Saints there in Samaria when the Holy Ghost fell remember Simon the sorcer got baptized and he just he still had this bitterness in him though and then Peter and James and John or Peter and John uh they're laying hands and the Holy Ghost is Fallen one after another Holy Ghost these people are filled with the Holy Ghost and then Simon says let me give you money so I can have that gift and Peter said God be merciful to you so look there's secret sin but yet God is still blessing so there's this accountability aspect when there's secret sin and people know about it and the church doesn't take care of it that's when the blessings stop is that right amen so I want to think of more examples on that because it's quite a thought the aen effect didn't stop the church when ananas and Safa sinned right God dealt with it and God kept the church pure moved right on and church you know if you've been around long you know my prayer has always been God don't let sin come into that door you probably heard me preach that 20 or 30 times right you can quote me you know the words that are going to come out of my mouth and wh why is that because of this the ACH and effect I don't want people sick and dying around here I want people living to the glory of God hallelujah hallelujah I want to see people get their three score and 10 if they're really strong four score maybe beyond that by God's grace Hallelujah we want to live in Holiness we want to live in Purity praise God all the days of our life and just be sure of this church be sure of this if you have Secret sin it will find itself out it will hunt you down numbers 32:22 and again this is just God's grace it's just God's grace that he'll remind us of our sin that's God's mercy if you get to the spot where your sin won't hunt you down now you've been reprobate it doesn't bother you to sin anymore now they're reprobates Psalm 32:22 and the land be subdued before the Lord then after ye shall return and be Guiltless before the Lord and before Israel and this land shall be your possession before the Lord but if you will not do so behold you have sinned against the Lord and be sure your sin will find you out which means hunt you down right evil will pursue you if you don't confess your secret sins but if you confess your sins you're forgiven of all unrighteousness amen Hallelujah Psalm 140: 11 140 ver1 let not an evil speaker be established in the earth evil shall hunt the violent man to overthrown it's the law of reaping and sewing now we don't take it too far like the prosperity just name it and claim it right but there is a law of reaping and sewing see that evil shall hunt down the violent man many times if you're violent someone will be violent against you it'll hunt you down Proverbs 13:21 evil pursueth Sinners right it'll chase them down but to the righteous good shall be repaid amen see one way or another you're going to get repaid let's seow seeds of righteousness so we get paid back with righteousness Psalm I'm sorry Isaiah 591 and2 behold the Lord hand the Lord's hand is not shortened that it cannot save neither his ear heavy that it cannot hear how many know that God hears your prayers amen right he might just be silent for a season or he might be testing you right or you might have caused a silence for a season verse two but your iniquities have separated you between your and your God this is beginning Israel and your sins have hid his face from you that he will not hear verse uh 12 in the same chapter for our transgressions are multiplied before thee and our sins testify against us for our transgressions are with us and as for our iniquities we know them thank God we know them praise God so here so here we have These Warnings that if we don't confess our secret sins God won't hear our prayers Hallelujah 1 Corinthians 4 verse 5 therefore judge nothing before the time until the Lord come who will bring both to light the hidden things of Darkness see people talk about conspiracies oh yeah there's conspiracies there's a lot of hidden Darkness out there right church God will bring it to light and will make manifest the counsels of the hearts and then shall every man have Praise of God you know over the years we've seen all these politicians they'll lie right to the camera and then years later it'll come out and you say wow that's what the face of a liar looks like right right God will bring it to light like Bill Clinton I promise I never did anything evil in Old office yet he was the biggest hormonger in the Oval Office like JFK God will bring it to light now there's even exposed beyond that right the the island of the wicked it's wicked demonic uh demon-possessed people he says and then shall every man have Praise of God Amen God will expose the unfruitful works but God will honor the hidden wonderful works of God hallelujah God will reward you for your faithfulness praise God who cares if anybody sees it God sees it that's what's important Hallelujah pray fast give arms in secret and God will reward you openly hallelujah amen what a what a privilege Hallelujah remember Hebrews 12 the Lord uh chastens Those whom he loves amen if God lets your secret sins catch up you that's just his love to you because he could have let it go on and you wouldn't have to face it until the Judgment I want to face my sins now amen cuz everybody's got secret faults if David did you do if if if Paul did certainly we do Jesus said in Revelation 3 as many as I love I rebuke and chasen Hallelujah let us not forget some of these uh major scriptures I'm trying to bring it to bring this down to a close here um Proverbs 2813 and 14 he that but who so confesseth and forsaketh them Shall Have Mercy amen that that that's what we must do we must confess them to God and then leave those sins and get the victory praise God we know he's Satan's going to come back at another opportune season but let's get Victory and forsake them Hallelujah happy is the man that fearth always but he that hardeneth his heart shall fall into mischief Hallelujah the hard Hearts remember I said sh shared that on Wednesday or two Wednesdays ago now with controlling our emotions it's okay to be angry at a hard-hearted person as long as it's Jesus in you right amen as long as Jesus in you there's nothing wrong with that Psalm 69:5 I love this a Psalm of David a man after God's Own Heart Church just be encouraged with this Psalm 695 oh God thou knowest my foolishness Jesus told his own disciples they were fools of course they didn't have the Holy Ghost but Paul told the Galatians you're foolish and if David could humble himself in his own this is his own personal song now imagine he sang this oh God thou knowest my foolishness so even in his own song he could say God I'm a fool sometimes yeah right I do presumptuous things I knew better I got all proud and arrogant like I knew about it and I was the best person and I got I did foolish yeah if David could admit that we can admit that and my sins are not hid from thee but that's not the end of the song Psalm 69 is entire song so the first part of the song is God you know I'm foolish sometimes but he goes on in verse 13 but as for me my prayer is unto thee Oh Lord in an acceptable time see now I'm accepted sometimes I'm foolish but other times God accepts me hallelujah oh God in the multitude of thy mercy hear me I sound like some some Catholic chant or something like that I went to too many Catholic churches in the truth of in the truth of thy salvation hear me oh lord for thy loving kindness is good verse 16 turn unto me according to the multitude of thy Tender Mercies amen I've been foolish but let your grace come back to me let me feel your presence again hallelujah amen I'm foolish sometimes but I want to be back in your presence hallelujah amen glory a man after God's Own Heart brother [Laughter] amen he's got secet faults he's got he's foolish he does things that he hates sounds a lot like me sounds a lot like you he says and hide not thy face from thy servant for I'm in trouble hear me Speedy now I wonder why he's in trouble probably because his own sins probably because of his own foolishness yeah that's right right yeah so bring your face remember the God said I'll turn my face away from you if you sin but he says here turn your face toward me so David must have sinned he must have did some foolish things he said God bring your face towards me again I want to see your presence I want to feel that I'm accepted by you how many want to feel that way when you come to church that God has accepted your sacrifice I tell you on that Friday uh Friday morning it was 3:00 a.m. that's when that stomach trouble hit me I asked as God I rebuked that sickness it lasted for about 6 hours so I was thankful for that 6 hours but I said I told the Lord I got on my knees in my office bathroom there and I said Lord this is a sacrifice I don't feel like praising your name but I praised them anyway I did not feel like praising God I said Lord this is a sacrifice of praise please touch my stomach now I woke up I didn't feel bad but then about two hours later I felt pretty bad but just it reminded me again of the sacrifice of praise it's easy to praise God when you feel like it it's not easy to praise God when you're struggling you feel foolish you feel like you've let God down you feel guilty but we've got to believe the word of God am I'm in trouble anybody been in trouble this week hear me turn your face toward me I'm in trouble Lord I did I was in trouble with sickness draw nigh unto my soul so see he felt far from God I've been foolish turn to me draw come back to me draw nigh to my soul redeem it deliver me because of mine enemies amen and then 69: 30A 69:3 I will praise the name of God with a song and will Magnify Him with Thanksgiving this also shall praise please the Lord better than a ox or bulock than hath horns and hoofs wow alls God really wants is a hallelujah amen all that I have is a Hallelujah is that isn't that an inspired song gratitude that's really all God wants confess your sins recognize I'm foolish sometimes I do things I don't like but I'm going to return I'm going to say thank you Lord for having grace and mercy upon me I'm going to praise your name in the sanctuary amen I'm going to give you glory now to do that you got to forget about your mistakes yes got to forget about it verse 31 this also shall please the Lord I'm sorry verse 32 The Humble shall see this and be glad amen let me just say this church each one of us know about our struggles we know we go through difficult times but it makes us glad when we see each other overcome our faults and come back and give God some prais amen I know brother Jesse fell short there but wow look he's praising God today well you ought to be happy I'm just like David Hallelujah I got forget all my foolishness I forget all my sins and I come back to give God the sacrifice of praise Hallelujah because he has made me glad hallelujah hallelujah and your heart shall live that seek God for the Lord heareth the poor and despises not his prisoners Paul said I'm a prisoner of Christ amen hallelujah look at this one uh Psalm 90:8 a Psalm of Moses so Moses could sing about this as well Psalm 90:8 thou has set our iniquities before thee our secret sins in the light of thy countenance so see God has all these God knows all of our sins right but he chooses to forgive he chooses to show us Mercy amen so I thought that last song was very fitting brother to this message I knew I was going to preach on this and I was just smiling like oh God knows what he's doing he's preparing our hearts see God has all these sins before us right but he forgives us but verse 12 so teach us to number our days that we may apply our hearts unto wisdom not foolishness wisdom return oh Lord how long and let it repent thee concerning thy servants he return to me so once we sin we got to confess but then we got to ask God God bring your favor back bring your anointing back in my life amen I I want to feel your presence again I want the Holy Spirit to blow through the church again hallelujah amen I want it to anoint me on the job or in my car or my prayer closet or in the church I want to feel the anointing of God I want to feel God's face hallelujah oh satisfy us early with their Mercy there's that Shane and Shan song I love that satisfy us with your love when the sun comes up satisfy us early with your mercy that we may rejoice and be glad all of our days make us glad concerning to the day I'm sorry according to the days wherein thou has Afflicted us and the years wherein we have seen evil oh Church we've had some good years lately how many of us would label like a whole year as evil I can't think of any you know maybe as a sinner there had some evil years there but look at what God's grace God's grace gives us hope for the future amen God God's grace shines upon us all 365 days of the year Hallelujah we can say these years years have been good years I think of Austin Lena you know every time how many years they' been back you know they've been back theyve been good years Hallelujah years of our children they've been good years together 20 years of marriage theyve been all good years no evil years by God's grace 18 years of pastoring they've been or almost 18 17 they've been good years Hallelujah some tough times but by God's grace we've overcome Hallelujah uh verse 16 let thy Work appear unto thy servants and thy Glory under their children and let the beauty of the Lord Our God be upon us and establish thou the work of our hands upon us yay the work of our hands shall estab shall establish thou it Hallelujah establish our works help us to do the works of God that God has called us to do for for us it's like this Lord use the gifts that are in my life amen I want Jesus to say Well done you had this preaching gift and and you doubled that gift amen so for each one Lord if you Lord if I've got a gift of faith may I double this gift as a pleasing sacrifice unto you amen hallelujah now I think I'll just close here because it's already it's already been an hour and a half so it doesn't seem like that does it does it to you ises it to you I hope not it's gone fast um couple more scriptures I want to read here by God's grace numerous ones here um Micah 717 he will turn again and have compassion upon us he will subdue our iniquities and thou will cast all their sins into the depths of the sea amen so what an encouragement in the Old Testament the Saints knew if they if they had left God God would return to them God will return with compassion now this is why I forgot to share about brother Dennis uh did you notice he said fasting has been powerful for him in this year of his life so in our personal conversation he said I've been trying to fast my entire Christian life and never had been doing it the right way Church he's 48 years old now I want to use this as an encouragement he never gave up trying to fast he sought God until God heard his prayer amen amen what a sign of a mature Christian now I I I told all you he's one of the men I respect the most but I didn't tell him that because I don't want him to get lifted up because if people tell me that I might struggle and like be a little prideful but I didn't tell them that because I always want to just keep that humble relationship but I really admire his faith but I thought I was so humble he could say I've been fasting for almost 30 years and this is the year that I finally got victory in fasting amen so be encouraged right if you want more of God or if you want God to return to you God will return to you yes amen did you hear some of the words he said out of his mouth he said I want to he said I have a death sentence I've got to die for my family that means pray and intercede for his family church that was precious we the precious words of God amen amen through fasting through prayer amen amen he's 48 and finally so brother brother bang there's hope for us brother Jose there's hope for us I'm 43 There's Hope For Me Hallelujah I've had great times of fasting no doubt about it but here God lets a servant Lord go decades and still coming into and he said it's like a I'm like a brand new Christian I feel like I got a brand new walk I got my first love back the church said there is God wants to have compassion am and now he can pray for his children like he never could before because he's gone through difficult Seasons gone through trials he's waited on the Lord and God has renewed his strength like the eagle amen hallelujah I was so encouraged about this is God Amen God is here but God will subdue your iniquities amen don't worry about that God will subdue them he's greater than your your sins amen God is greater he will cast all everybody say all all their sins in the depths of the sea um ACAA can you switch over I want to show this video real quick I CAU I saw this a few weeks ago I don't know how good the volume will be on here I'll try to turn this up all the way you ever seen a video on the depths of the sea God said I'm going to cast all your sins in the depths of the sea This Woman's talking about the depths of the sea but she ain't talking about it about God but let's see it's going to be just a second here to get this going most people don't understand how deep the ocean really is imagine you walk off the coast into the water at 10 m or 33 ft deep you're already experiencing an entire additional atmosphere of pressure at he so catch that by the time your head's covered in the water you're already in a different atmosphere and this is what God has done to our sins see where I'm going with this just just just in a few feet six feet your are already in a different atmosphere hallelujah amen hallelujah praise God and M where do your sins go not to the first layer all the way to the bottom 114 m you're passing the verified record for a human diver with no equipment at 830 you're the depth of the tallest building on earth and at 1,000 M down no light from the surface is getting to you anymore and you're only about a tenth of the way down 1,00 not even a tenth of the way down no sunlight can even get down there in other words whatever is buried under there the sun ain't going to shine on it you ain't going to find it that's only a tenth of the way down mic is like I have no other way to say this Hallelujah I don't even know how to describe this but the Holy Spirit strike in my heart and it says God through all your sins in the sea of forgetfulness hallelujah oh my Hallelujah this spoke to me Hallelujah I thought that's what God did with my sins 220 M and you're in the territory of the deepest military submarines that we know about at 3,800 M you hit the Titanic Titanic just above it is where the infamous ocean Gates immersible imploded the deepest recorded natural point is 10,984 M deep or 6.8 mil this point this is Challenger Deep if you put Mount Everest into the water upside down there would still be over a mile until you got to the bottom all right how many can say Amen to that the ocean is seven almost seven miles deep Hallelujah and all these years ago 3,000 years ago God inspired Micah to write God is going to return with compassion upon you this is why God can be compassionate because he can so get rid of your sins he'll never remember them ever again hallelujah amen now what I found was interesting too now you can unplug there man finally reached the bottom in 2019 one man went down there I forget his name Discovery Channel had it on there his name was Victor vescovo it was April I'm sorry August 24th 2019 he said he made it down to the mo or Malo hole the deepest point in the Arctic Ocean this was the first Man dive to ever reach the bottom of the trench and mark the completion of the fifth and final stage of the historic five depths Expedition a mission to reach the deepest point of all five of the Earth's oceans in a man submersible and Diving them solo and the thought came to me it took man 6,000 years to get to the depths of the sea what was God showing God was showing it's it's nearly impossible for 6,000 years it's nearly impossible for anyone to ever find the sins that I forgive Hallelujah for 6,000 years it was man cannot ever get to the bottom now what does Satan like to do Satan's like the type of this guy getting down there he likes to try to go down there and bring them up but God said I'll never remember them in other words when Satan goes down there to find them there's no evidence there Hallelujah there's nothing at the bottom hallelujah praise God cuz it's all been done away with through the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah so what what what what must we do Isaiah 40 54:17 no weapon that's formed against you shall prosper every tongue that shall rise against thee in judgment Thou shalt condemn any devil that tries to condemn you you will condemn that devil and the church said that's the Bible that was Old Testament right this was for foreshadowing what Paul said Saints don't you know that the Saints will judge the Earth don't you know the Saints will judge Angels hallelujah oh Hallelujah all because of the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah blessed is the man whom thou will not impute iniquity whose sins are covered hallelujah amen oh my so what must we do we must forget those things that are in the past which are behind and reach forth unto those things which are before press toward the mark for the prize of the High Calling of God in Christ Jesus amen if God is for us who can be against us who shall lay anything to the charge of God's elect there is no demon that will accuse you praise Goden all their voices will be condemned the Bible said you will condemn that Spirit you will judge that Spirit of of Pride that spirit of fear that critical spirit you will judge that cons that that spirit and you'll condemn that Spirit by the power of God and church let me just say like this you got power to cast it down right now Hallelujah you'll do the final casting down at the white Throne judgment but we've got right now to cast down any sin that exalts itself in our life we got Mighty powers of God to pull down all the strong holds Hallelujah let's stand to our feet musicians can come if there's no charge to you then who is he that condemneth God's people well that's the devil it is Christ that died we didn't pay for our own sins Christ paid for our sins sins he's even at the right hand of God who also maketh intercession for us who shall separate us from the love of Christ what is this all about the SE it's about God's love God's trying to give us an idea how much he actually loves us hallelujah amen nothing shall separate us from the love of Jesus Christ amen amen how many Wonder be cleansed from Secret sin amen let's bow our heads here in all these things we're more than conquerors you'll overcome someday let's make today your day amen amen there is nothing able to separate us from the love of God which is in Christ Jesus our lord father God we thank you for today Lord God I've tried to use this illustration Lord to to show the people what you said in Micah Lord we want to be like David we want to say God's word is Holy God's word converted me God's mercies are sure God's presence is Holy so Lord because of your greatness because of your majesty cleanse me from my secret faults please don't let me be presumptuous and prideful Hallelujah Grant it Lord [Music] Jesus Lord we're not the type that does these sins where you instantly judge us like ACH and we're not that type dear God but we have these personal battles that we feel like David sometimes we feel foolish why did I say that why did I do that yet Lord we know there's Mercy just like there was for David just like there was for Moses who had that prideful presumptuous sin of calling them Rebels hallelujah oh God your grace is even greater than Mount Everest we can see the depths is deeper than the height of Mount Everest the highest mountain you've given us to look at and stand in awe of yet your forgiveness we'd say is greater than that Hallelujah Hallelujah God cleanse us here Lord God make us to Rejoice make us glad to serve you Lord God thank you for sending us these sermons Lord these last few weeks God may we take advantage of them Lord God give us hope there's future seasons of Grace you'll turn again to us your compassion will be towards us we are your sons we are your daughters [Music] we will praise your name in the land of the living we love you Lord God I just pray Lord as I've said many times God please don't let sin remain in here in this Sanctuary forgive us of all sin let us continue to walk in the power of the spirit in the love of God cleanse us from Secret sins as the Bible said in Isaiah wash me and I'll be whiter than snow and we just simply must confess in order for you to wash us blessed is the man who confesses his sin who doesn't hide his sin Lord if we have any secret sins in our lives God may we confess them now and know that we are are forgiven we thank you God for this opportunity to worship and hear the word of God to learn of the word of God I was so refreshed by this thought you shared with us Lord as you shared with me as I studied and [Music] prepared Lord as you said one day we'll judge these Fallen Angels one day we'll judge the world because of your warnings we heard now Lord God help us to take heed to Thy word Lord [Music] God we will give you thanks and praise to walk in the Integrity of the Holy Spirit In Jesus Christ's name amen let's sing this song If anyone desires prayer you're more than welcome to come be happy to pray with you
