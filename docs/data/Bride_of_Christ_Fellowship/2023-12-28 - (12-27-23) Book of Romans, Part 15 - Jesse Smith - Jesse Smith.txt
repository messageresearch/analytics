TRANSCRIPT
========================================
well I'm not sure um says I got to do it this way I've never done it that way before I don't know I guess I'll just leave it on the pulpit and they can just stare up at the ceiling or something like that all right God bless live streamers I'm not sure we had just a or orentation issue here so God bless everybody let me get a book here to set this up Romans 7 we look at the book of Romans I believe this is part 15 we did a short section what's that would that work Buddy would that work if it can be in the portrait mode that would be great so I just got to pull it up well that is fantastic brother you okay let's see how that goes thank you brother am God's always got somebody to help us out love you brother thank God bless the Saints and we thank brother amen for setting that up by God's grace Romans 7 uh 4 and 5 I want to continue on the book of Romans thank you for your patience here as we get going I'm not going to watch the time tonight because we don't have school or well some us have work tomorrow right sorry about that I guess I'll watch the time sorry sorry I didn't think about that just thinking about my own self I shouldn't do that so Romans 7:4 and 5 it was a wonderful message I went back and listened to it uh today just to hear the message and so blessed by the songs and the worship and just what God spoke brother Austin sent me a text and said some of the things that were preach were I was saying like where is this coming from he's like that's just what he needed to hear so I said praise the Lord and there's one testimony to share at the end is very important uh to me kind of dealt with Sunday as well um so we I'll share that at the End by God's grace Romans 7 ver4 and 5 so I'm just starting off with you know looking at these two verses and we're going to just focus on the fruit because the Bible said you must be married to Christ and then you produce the fruit of the Holy Spirit I just want to start with that thought before you're married to before we are married to Christ we had fruit unto death you know the sin just produced death in our lives nothing nothing good right but once you come to Christ once you become married to Christ and you get his name when you're baptized then you produce the fruits of the Holy Spirit praise God Amen Hallelujah there's fruits when you're to be justified there's fruits the sanctification and then there's fruits the baptism of the Holy Ghost we preached on that because John said bring forth fruits unto repentance Hallelujah Romans 7 uh 4 and 5 I'll read verse four and then we can read verse 5 together verse four says wherefore my brethren ye also are become dead to the law by the body of Christ that you should be married to another even to him who is raised from the dead that we should bring forth fruit unto God let's read verse 5 on three 1 2 3 for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sins which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death may God add as a blessing to the Ring of his word you may be seated by God's grace all right so we'll try to take about an hour here I'll try to watch the time here by God's I'm Sorry by God's grace no school tomorrow right we just got work tomorrow right no school when did you go back girls when you go back to school December 3rd or January 3rd right okay the Wednesday that's okay that's all right January 3rd I go back the 4th that's right because you got one day before me I get one day after you so so we we see when we're married to Christ it produces fruit in our lives praise God so I want to read that out of Galatians 5 you have your Bible uh let's go to Galatians 5:18 I like how Paul the same one that wrote this right the same one that wrote Romans 7 wrote here Galatians and let's just review some of these fruits here of Our Lives thank God that the uh old married spouse is dead and the church said amen that law the legalism the curse we are dead to that spouse and we are married to Christ hallelujah amen praise the Lord do we do we still battle sin of course is sin still in our members yes of course Hallelujah but God doesn't hold that against us right that's that's the that's the battle that we must face that's the greatest battle ever fought praise God God gives us uh something to do with the faith that we receive praise God we learn to be an overcomer we learn to overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of Our Testimony praise God amen amen and he he lets us uh fight the good fight of Faith Hallelujah and when we can't fight anymore he fights for us amen amen we feel like giving up praise God he sends in reinforcements Hallelujah feel like All Is Lost we feel like there's no hope Jesus gives us a reason to Hope praise God he is our Living Hope amen amen Galatians 5:18 beautifully lays out this uh thought here actually I'll read 17 because the the flesh lust against the spirit and the spirit against the Flesh and these are contrary one to another so that you cannot do the things that you would that's one good thing to keep in mind the Holy Ghost was always opposite of the flesh the flesh wants to glorify it self and the the you know the three Avenues of sin lust of the eyes lust of the flesh pride of life but the holy spirit is opposite of that praise God they're contrary they're always fighting one against another right Hallelujah we want to live in a spot where we can easily uh surrender to the leading of the Holy Spirit rather than easily surrendering to the flesh right we want to live so close to God that that we can easily be led by the Holy Spirit now verse uh 18 for but if ye be led by the spirit you're not under the law now the works of the flesh are manifest which are adultery fornication uncleanness theous which is lawlessness oh I'm saved by grace I can live however I want no you can't that's that's called lashious idolatry which is a lot in our day in our group it's Idol idolizing brother brandom in tapes right uh witchcraft which remember uh Rebellion is the same as witchcraft yes remember I told you that Pastor in Florida uh uh got visited by evil spirits for two weeks in a row and he found out later it was witches in the church that were telling him not to preach and just press play that was witchcraft in a a Florida Church a message church so we can't we can't think of like witchcraft is something off there you know uh it's witches around a a pot or a cauldron of steam and stuff like that it's people that can come to church yes and say press play that's right but they can also say preach right you know they can say anything but that the way we test all things is give them the word test praise God Amen take take them to the word of God what does the word say praise God Amen and the word will manifest every time is it the spirit of God or the spirit of the Antichrist yes so see that's you know Satan's a he's a brother said he's a genius at his job it's too easy to detect a witch if you know if she looks like a witch with makeup on and a crooked nose and a black hat it's too easy right so he's got to be more deceptive all the time so let's make sure by God's grace we're walking according to the spirit and not the flesh amen like you can see now and I'm just going to get on this for just a moment just one more moment you can see the move the the move behind this tape church is you don't have to go to church just send us your money that's where they're at right now they haven't gone to church for years now it's been two or three years they haven't even gathered together for church that that's the effect of it and the Bible says gather more as you see that day approaches right and it's and it's gone completely opposite but but to them they're so blind they can't even see the Hebrews 10: 24 and 25 gather more and they can't even hear brother say it on the tapes the man said don't stay at home go to church he said if the spirit of God is in you it can't wait till those doors open up amen and some of you got your own key you can open up the door yourself hallelujah amen you ought to be thankful praise God that you can open the door of the church yourself Hallelujah if you don't if you don't got a key let me know I don't know if anybody's got a key but let me know if you need a key by God's grace we'll try to get you key Hallelujah now uh hatred variance emulations wrath Strife seditions heresies envyings murders drunkenness reings now revelings are the late night parties I read that quote on Sunday but that's what brother was talking about reings late night parties and such of like of which I tell you before as I have told you in time past that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God that's why I told my barber today you know I don't go to late night New Year's Eve parties I said I'm in bed the same time hopefully earlier because late night parties is it's a it's a Temptation for sin it's always an open door for Satan right I think Zer and I were texting about that right you were texting about that when I was growing up you know we had uh family Christmas parties and family New Year's Eve parties and we'd be up till midnight we watch the ball drop and my my my dad and my my uncles and I we'd be playing cards we'd be gambling basically poker smoking and cussing and it was just a it was just all sin nothing ever good comes out of those things and the Bible tells that's a work of the flesh the Bible tells us that praise God the Bible said avoid all appearance of evil praise God Amen so it's a good lesson a good reminder for us the Bible said uh of though of which I tell you before fishing verse 21 as I've told you in times pass that they which do such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God now of course they can repent of these things and be saved like the thief on the cross he was a thief and he was forgiven right at the last moment the Bible don't even record him saying forgive me the Bible just says he said Remember Me amen hallelujah the Bible don't record where he says I Repent of my sins you're my lamb you know he don't say that he just says remember me and Jesus said today you'll be with me in Paradise that must mean Jesus knows your heart if you don't got the right word Jesus knows your heart praise God Amen Hallelujah see Church don't feel bad if you pray you don't got the right word just say God you know my heart and Jesus knows what's in your heart praise God Amen now here if you're married to Christ verse 22 but the fruit of the spirit is love you just love God's people you love your enemies you love the word amen that's the fruit that's how you know you're married to Christ you love the word like brother R said how can how can a church say they're married to Christ when they cut their hair wear pants and bobbed hair and makeup and speaking in tongues of the evidence and all these that it's not married to Christ they're married to a Creed and God will give them Grace if they'll repent right but their their their fruits show that they're not married to the truth of the word yes and I gave you a list of 100 things I didn't go through it maybe one of these Services I'll go actually slowly through the list so you can see it I didn't actually get to study on that one either more I like to get on 200 of those first but love joy peace longsuffering I think a joy you know the Bible said rejoice in the lord always and again I say rejoice amen amen and I was reading this week in Leviticus 23 I think it's Deuteronomy 16 where talked about the Feast of Weeks and one of the brothers brother John was talking to me about that on Sunday there's seven Israel feasts remember there's the Passover that's Christ types Christ death there's unleavened bread that types Christ going down uh to hell to get the keys uh there there's the U the the Feast of first fruits that's the Resurrection the fourth one for is Deliverance amen four there's four uh there's four beasts the fourth one is the Feast of Weeks which is us it's two wave loaves that were waved before the people and they had leaven in them it was two it was two uh loav of bread it was the Jew and Gentile church amen hallelujah and the Bible said when in that Feast you harvest you harvest all the seeds that's why we're still preaching trying to harvest souls and the Bible said rejoice in that Feast amen hallelujah praise God what am I saying this is the season to Rejoice amen rejoice in Christ h am and then he says Rejoice always and again I say rejoice same man who is whipped five times the same man who is Shipwrecked three times the same man says Rejoice always and again I say rejoice find something to be happy about praise God Amen we got a lot of a lot of choices to find out what we should be happy with amen hallelujah thank God verse 23 well actually I never finished 22 joy peace longsuffering goodness I'm sorry gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law and they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections and lust and notice it's not a one-time thing it's a daily thing right amen I was talking to brother Brooks and we were kind of talking about this and he was saying you know he said I used to think that these things would be gone forever the the you know the the past sins but those spirits come back the Bible said don't come back right right like we would have thought oh I'll never be tempted by that again or you know we better be careful what we say right you got to understand that the demons are going to come back and they're going to try to come in with a little more strength right a little more persuasion but we got to be ready to cast them down praise God cast out any imagination that exalts itself against the knowledge of God Amen I like hearing you know veteran Saints like that like hear Brother Brooks's testimony like that stirs me up amen I want to be I want to be faithful praise God I want to be ready I want to be aware verse 25 if ye live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit let us let us not be desirous of vain Glory provoking one another envying one another let's let's try not to provoke one another let's try not to Envy one another let's be happy for everybody praise God Amen now back back to Romans 7 here now the Bible said uh it's the Motions of sin in verse uh let's see verse five for when we were in the flesh the Motions of sin motions means the inward State or the Affliction of sins which were by the law did work in our members to bring forth fruit unto death so when you were a sinner you were in the inward state of sin it was just constant sin now I'm sure some of you might remember that I'm not asking you to raise your hand but you might remember when you were constantly sinning all the time right there was times like the Bible said in Genesis 6 I can relate to that every thought of the imagination of the heart was evil continually I remember that right now it seems like a long time ago so thank God for that but that that's the condition the world got in and Paul says that's the condition we were in we were in an inward state of the motion of sin Hallelujah right I like verse six but now amen those are two beautiful words amen I used to be in that inward sayate but now I'm delivered from the law praise God Amen that being dead wherein we were held that we should serve in the newness of spirit and not the oldness of the letter praise God Amen we are delivered from the curse of the law right as we want over on Sunday if you break one of them you're guilty of all of them but now we serve in the newness of the spirit and remember Church in context this is like this is like honeymoon this is you're serving Jesus like it's the honeymoon because it's a marriage you were you your old spouse died now know those of us who are married we know it's like to be on the honeymoon if you had one hopefully you had one by God's grace if you didn't I'm very sorry pray maybe I can help you out with that if you need some financial help I did that a couple times I've helped a couple people get some honeymoon times they need it by God's grace but anyways you know this is the context you're now married to Christ so serve your new spouse with the newness of spirit amen amen in other words your first love hallelujah amen serve Jesus with gladness of heart I just read that this week in Deuteronomy 28 God told Israel because you did not serve me with joy fness of gladness of heart therefore you shall serve your enemies what a rebuke but also what a blessing to us if we serve god with joyfulness and gladness we will overcome our enemies amen amen that's why Christians find it hard the message or any other the church they find it hard if they're not serving God with joyfulness and gladness they become Servants of sin and then brother Ram tells us uh that that he tells that then Christianity it's hard to be a Christian then right brother R tell us that I forget the exact words but brother R say uh you know PR people that had no Victory they have no Victory because they didn't serve god with joyfulness and gladness all the joy was taken out of Christianity right all the victory was taken out all the blessings somehow Satan deceived them and and tempted them into forgetting all the good things of God oh my my goodness but Paul says let it be a honey brother no wonder brother say let your marriage always be a honeymoon amen and all the amen or I'm sorry all the married people said Amen to that one Hallelujah not the oldness of the letter now this is a statement many people understand the letter kth but the spirit giveth life amen I noticed a lot of message preachers they condemn any Message Bible teacher because they're not like them they're not loud enough like maybe a Bible teacher isn't loud enough or not not speaking fast enough or getting the people excited enough remember brother Brian says that turns him off when people when preachers come in and they just got to have a loud service if they don't have a loud service then they're not uh having Church you can't judge every service by the noise right amen right God might be speaking in a still Small Voice God might be rebuking well nobody says amen when they're being rebuked when was the last time you shouted amen and dance around here when you got rebuked by something you don't do that when you're getting rebuked but the Bible Jesus said if I love you I'll rebuke you amen amen right so so this thought came to me as I was studying they these preachers use the letter kill it but they misuse it and it's misused out of context of course we condemn any false teacher who's teaching heresies whether they're loud or quiet but there's just as many loud preachers preaching heresies as there are quiet teachers right preaching heresies there's just as many I could take you on YouTube and show you just as just as many right so get your Bible go to 2 Corinthians 3:6 now let's look at the context of this because Paul mentions it here we should serve in the newness of spirit and not the letter again remember he's giving the contrast between the New Testament and the Old Testament that's the context the context isn't loud preachers against quiet preachers that's why church sometimes some of my favorite services are Wednesday nights when it's more quiet or Sunday nights when people are asking really good questions and I feel the presence of God moving in other words it don't have to be a loud service every time I thank God for the loud we had a nice loud service on Sunday that Sunday morning that was really good there's a lot of clapping a lot of rejoicing and thank God for that amen but have you noticed sometimes too God's in the quiet many times too amen why because the Bible says you're searching your soul the Bible said you take the can of the Lord and God escorts you remember down past your flesh remember that preach on that down and past your mind and then now he goes deep out down into your soul he takes the candle of the spirit right the candle and you go searching the Bible says Search Your Heart search your spirit search your soul right right search me oh God see if there be any wicked way in me the Bible says amen sometimes there's those deep searching Services praise God hallelujah Second Corinthians 3:6 who also has made us able ministers of the New Testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter kth but the spirit giveth life so pre Preachers will say well he's not loud enough he's doing too much teaching he's standing still too much see he's of the letter that's not what he's talking about right the Bible said Jesus sat daily in the temple teaching the people just sat he wasn't walking around all the time or running around like preachers he wasn't jumping around like I do sometimes you know he sat in the temple daily teaching the people the word of God right amen so let's get the context verse 7 but if the ministration of death written engraved in Stones oh now we're getting to the context was glorious so that the children of Israel could not steadfastly behold the face of Moses for the glory of his countenance which Glory was be done away hath not I'm sorry how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious so the letter is the law Hallelujah the letter is The Ten Commandments and of course all the other 600 or 500 or sorry 6003 sorry 6003 Commandments now look at verse 9 for the administration of condemnation so now the Old Testament is called condemnation there was only condemnation in there right the Messiah hadn't come yet you never could sacrifice enough Bullocks or goats right you you just never could do it much more do the ministration of righteousness exceed in glory so the letter is not new Testament teachers the letter is the Old Testament law it's the spouse who died and the church said amen it's that legalism it's that curse of the law that's what the that's what the letter that kills is it just said it right there it's the ministration of condemnation like Moses found out as soon as God gives me Ten Commandments before he can deliver them to the people they've already broken them amen that's the law praise God right that that that's when you know uh you're under the law that's when you know you're guilty right before you even know about it you've already broken it praise God now brother R says this about teaching he said I remember staying a year and six months in the Book of Revelation in the Tabernacle here that's what I like in teaching I just love teaching oh my I think it's wonderful it gives the basis and settles the church Hallelujah now look brother said there's a great vast difference between a teacher and a preacher see it's two different gifts of the Spirit Al together two different gifts and I humbly say this but I haven't got a gift of either brother Bram says now if those people believe every word is th sayth the Lord then brother Ram didn't teach anything because he says he doesn't have a gift to do it and he didn't preach anything because he said he's not a Preacher Brother Ram said mine of course is praying for the sick that's what the Lord called me to do but how many know brother Ram was a real preacher how many know brother really could teach the word of God you haven't you better go listen to the seals in the church ages again and Hebrew series listen to those again M but see he's being humble and even says this I humbly say this I haven't got the gift of be them so notice brother says I love teaching Jesus said in Matthew 28:19 go ye therefore and teach All Nations baptizing them in the one name of the father Son and Holy Ghost the Lord Jesus Christ verse 20 teaching them to observe all things whatsoever I have commanded you Hallelujah brother bram's talking about deacons in 1963 and and they the deacons asked brother Bram what if the people won't listen to the deacons and look what brother Bram says says people often get mad mad at us when we try to correct them he says they do at me too they'll do it at any man see a person that does that there's something wrong with that person Hallelujah they're not right with God for the spirit of Christ is subject to Christ teaching Christ's house Christ order if you've got the spirit of Christ you obey what the what the rules are at the church Hallelujah if you got the spirit of Christ you obey Christ teaching yes his house his order amen amen Jesus said go and teach the word of God hallelujah I just thought I'd take a few minutes out of here and preach that to you so you could understand Hallelujah brother B says this uh I'm going to skip that quote uh put up 1 John 2:27 hun you're doing good tonight here I appreciate dedication you do good every service 1 John 2:27 I preached on this I think I preached on this recently but the anointing which you have received of him abideth in you and you need not let any man teach you now these people that are tape worshippers uh they'll they'll use this other people that don't believe in Preachers they'll use this and say they'll say well I've got the anointing I don't need anybody to teach me but as the same anointing teach you all things and is truth and is no lie and even as it has taught you ye shall abide in him now I'm not going to go there but earlier in this chapter John is saying there's false teachers and he's telling them when these false teachers come to you you don't need anybody to teach you because the anointing will teach you what to say in that hour amen that's the context now look what brother Ram says here I like I like what brother Ram says about this he said oh there's many that rise up and say oh I don't need to go to church anymore praise God the Holy Ghost has come he's the teacher but Ram says when you get get that idea you're just wrong so I'll remember that next time somebody tells me I don't have to go to church I don't need a preacher to teach me I'll say you're just wrong for why did the Holy Ghost set teachers in the church if he was going to be the teacher don't you like that why would one scripture contradict the other the route is none of them contradict each other that's right see there are first apostles prophets teachers evangelist pastors the Holy Spirit set teachers in the church so he could teach through that teacher and if it isn't according to the word God doesn't confirm it and then if it isn't the right kind of teaching it must compare with the entire Bible and be just as alive today as it was then there's the real thing made manifest amen that's what we're looking for church when I teach something I look for God to vindicate it amen or when I preach something I look for somebody to be blessed by that praise God Amen we got a good blessing on Sunday I'm going to share that testimony at the end here in a little bit and so that's what I look for and every time you know you know I I've I've had certain people you know email me and say brother Jesse when you put those videos out you're standing behind that Pulpit teaching the word of God they said I feel the presence of God I feel the Holy Spirit teaching I said praise God hallelujah that's what I want that's what brother man says that's what the gift should do right God should vindicate the gift praise God amen amen amen I'll tell you real just I'll tell you real plainly when I first started preaching it was really hard to get behind this sacred desk now now I'm used to it now I kind of I got a sacred respect for it I used to shake I us well not there but I used to Shake in my offices you know the different offices I've had I would Shake in trouble like what am I going to say I used to wonder can you imag a sister Naomi sister B I used to wonder how could I preach a half an hour I used to wonder that when I first start preaching and I preach two hours on Sunday and I stopped a short I could have kept preaching there's a good atmosphere in here I used to wonder like how I think my first sermon I preached was 15 minutes over at car sees apartment there on book booko Avenue right how how in the world what happen you just learn to yield to the Holy Spirit I might go from teaching a little bit then I'll bounce into some preaching amen hallelujah amen or might be trying to raise faith and just preach preach preach or might be trying to explain something and rightly divide the word of Truth praise God Amen because that's what Devils do Devils try to get people to doubt but the Holy Spirit comes in and teaches the truth praise God Amen that's what Satan's doing mainly now trying to get people to doubt the message and every time they get their eyes off the Bible Church keep your eyes on the Bible amen let me tell you that I always find that the holy spirit will take me back back to the Bible back to the Bible they want to get your eyes on William brandom and all these if if ifs and presumption presumption presumption just remember God sent brother brandom and he point us back to the word of God yes amen hallelujah so I love I love that quote brother BR says how why the Holy Spirit set teachers in the church if he was going to be the only teacher good point brother Brandon I love it Hallelujah now let's go back to Romans 7:8 I thought I'd take about yeah maybe half hour on that one 7 verse 8 okay now this is a familiar text you know I've uh I I mention this often you know why church because I'm always preaching on being more Sanctified right amen a lot of my sermons come down to how can we be more pure before God Amen yes right cuz honestly once you got the Holy Ghost once it's confirmed in your heart you got the hly Holy Ghost then you say Lord what must I do now well the main thing to do is stay purified stay Sanctified so God can use your Holy Ghost amen right that's why we want God to use that Holy Ghost that's inside of me praise God amen amen now verse seven what shall we say then is the law sin God forbid now look at that the Bible just said the law was administration of death see because there was a part of curse in it right it was the curse was included there if you don't keep all of it you're guilty of it all but then he says is it sin though God forbid no nay I had not known sin but by the law for I had not known lust except the law said Thou shalt not covet but sin taking occasion by the Commandment wrought in me all manner of concusions I'm going to pull up my uh Greek Lexicon here and look up some of these words okay so bear with me here concusion says a desire or craving or longing for that which is forbidden okay for without the law sin was dead verse n for I was alive without the law once but when the Commandment came sin revived and I died verse 10 and the Commandment which was ordained to life I found it be unto death okay verse 11 for sin taking occasion by the Commandment deceive me and by it slew me now he's not talking naturally he's talking spiritually so the law was so hard to keep I felt like it killed me anybody ever feel like that before amen anybody ever try to set up your expectations for yourself well I'm going to do this this and that and when you don't do it you feel like it killed you you ever feel like that am I the only one you know we have we have such high which is good you want to have high goals right you want to I'm going to preach on that you want to set goals for 2024 I preach a little bit on it but you want to set goals but don't be discouraged if you don't reach some of them I mean I I went found goals I set like years ago and I finally got them done like three years later I I didn't get discouraged I mean I knew in the back of my mind I wanted to get that done but it's all in God's time and season praise God as long as I'm giving my best as long as I'm trying my best God will bless me hallelujah amen again we got to find like brother said lay out your thousand your texts your thousand th to-do items on your to-do list lay those out before the Lord and say holy spirit Lead Me amen and I'm going to watch in the next few days I'm going to watch the next few weeks and I'm going to see Lord which way you're moving me amen like I just had somebody you I thought about you know how was my year of 2023 I just had a guy overseas send me an email this week and he said brother I can't tell you how important that video series you did on the 24 Lies coming out of brandom Tabernacle he said cuz I'm surrounded by people think about that church we got a good we got we got a pretty healthy church amen some people don't have a healthy Church some people got preachers that sometimes preach and sometimes play tapes and then there's all these other tape worshippers around we're we're blessed by God's grace we're surrounded by some really good churches but this this man says I I I was I've always had this struggle here with with is is Bram Tabernacle off or not and then I stumble upon your channel and we know it's not a stumbling praise God it's God or ordering the footsteps amen amen hallelujah like that one guy told me he said uh for all these years I've been crying Lord raise up somebody to defend this message he's been praying that for years and then he found my channel why I've been doing it for many years yeah for 10 years I've been doing it for all those years God sent me somebody God already Raised Me Up amen hallelujah amen but it's it's this idea of uh doing God a service right being Sanctified being purified so God can use us now praise God amen amen now verse uh verse 12 wherefore the law is Holy and the Commandment holy and just and good I've been going through uh I've been going transferring all my notes from one Bible to my new Bible I've gone through Genesis through Joshua and this last few days it's been awesome I see all these types all these Shadows all these Revelations but it's reminding me there's so much Holiness in the Old Testament there's so many Beautiful Stories in there that I forgotten about like oh there it is that's I forgot about that amen the Bible said the law was holy and good and righteous amen amen but when it came down to me obeying it it slew me it killed me right it told me all these things things I doing were were sins these were all sins right and it slew me verse 13 was then that which is good made death unto me God forbid God didn't intend for this to be uh death unto me but sin that it might appear sin working death in Me by that which is good that sin by the Commandment might become exceedingly sinful so God remember we got to tie this in with Galatians God set up the law to as a school Master to bring us to Christ amen amen God put all 613 laws in there to get you and I to understand I need a savior amen I need Grace I need someone to forgive me of all my trespasses amen amen I need someone to keep the law for me amen I can't do it I need somebody that will keep it for me praise God and God provided him and his name is Jesus Christ amen hallelujah oh I love the word of God don't you verse 14 for we know that the law is spiritual but I am carnal sold under sin how many can say Amen to that I'm a very carnal person amen certainly verse 15 for that which I do I allow not for what I would that I do not but what I hate that I do now remember we just reference first John 3:9 on Sunday and that was one of the brothers that John said that was one of the greatest Revelations he had from Sunday he never understood the soul how does the soul work how can God forgive me he never understood that verse when I preached it and laid it out there now he understands it by God's grace amen I thought that's beautiful I said that's the same thing I needed I needed brother R to preach that to me Hallelujah the now think about that that the holy ghost that comes inside when you when you're born again the holy ghost that comes in there that Holy Ghost never sinned amen and now it's in you amen and now you got a part of God Amen but that was God's part of himself that was for you amen that never sinned Hallelujah and never can sin hallelujah amen that's why Paul says I've never sinned it wasn't me it was the sin that dwells within me praise God Amen wasn't the Eternal part of God that sinned it was this carnal part of me that sinned I'm going to read a quote in a little bit brother says it's like you've got two persons in you right that's why brother could say I'm who's my greatest enemy William brandom he don't even say Satan he says William brandham is my greatest enemy now Satan our enemy of course all his devils and his minions they're all enemies but he said my greatest enemy in other words is the sin nature inside of me right yes so see where you know the law is Holy the the law is good he said but I don't allow myself to obey more I do things that I hate you don't have to raise your hand but maybe did something you hated today right don't feel bad you're in some pretty good company you're in Paul's company you're in the first church age Messengers company amen amen hallelujah you're in David's company praise God right amen the Bible said he despised the word of God when he took bash Sheba in other words he his sin nature was I can't stand that word I despise that word I can have whoever I want now he might have been drinking like on that Sight and Sound you know we don't know but his his flesh that other side of him hated that commandment so he took bash Sheba anyway now Paul on of course A minor level he's got the Holy Ghost it's a new testament but Paul on a minor level says I do things that I hate right so how do you overcome Paul how do you overcome he tells us verse 16 if then I do that which I would not I consent unto the law that that it's good other words oh it's good to sin verse 17 now then it is no more I that do it but sin that dwelleth Within Me Church repeat after me say I don't do it I don't do it sin does it sin does it hallelujah praise God Paul said it's not me it's sin that dwells within me amen Verse 18 for I know that in me that is in my flesh dwelleth no good thing for to will is present with me but how to perform that which is good I find not how to accomplish in other words how to achieve that which is good I can't find it is that interesting he says I'm like on a journey I'm searching for a way I can obey the word of God and I don't find it sometimes right but the Bible says if you resist Satan he'll flee and then God will draw nigh to you amen so what is what do we understand from this Paul would sin he did things he hated and what it shows what it proves by the Bible he just didn't wait long enough and that's the same for you and I right hallelujah amen we all could resist Satan a little more a little more Faithfully couldn't we I'm talking about when you sin think about when you might have sinned today maybe you made it this far without sinning bless your heart it's possible very possible when I was over there in Theo I hardly you know I was really close to God I felt like I was just really really on fire for God hallelujah amen but think about that if you sin today you you you you W able to accomplish you weren't able to find that strength to obey CU you didn't wait long enough praise God the Bible said in every Temptation there's a way out yes amen amen amen verse 20 for if I do that I would not it is no more I that do it but sin that dwells within me hallelujah it's no more I that sins Hallelujah the seed of God cannot sin Hallelujah God hallelujah it's sin that dwells within me I then find a law that when I was would do good evil is present with me so we have this law whenever I want to do what God wants me to do there's always something there's always going to be something they're tempting me how many ever do that in the morning you want to get up and pray read your Bible but then there's something there's a law there's always something distracting you hallelujah it's a law or maybe you like to study at night or pray at night that's wonderful but then there's always a law sleepiness is going to be fighting you right or calling somebody or or texting somebody or watching something there's always going to be that law you know it so what do you have to do you have to be stirred up the Bible say you got to be stirred up stir up your mind and be ready to obey the word of God because you know it's a law it's it's always going to operate it's always going to be that way when I want to do good something's going to be right there now for me is when I want to study there's always going to be some popcorn right there that maybe once to maybe it's tell me to eat it right it might distract me from studying right that's I've always had that I've always had that law that law is always there right or if I want to fast oh I can smell the Burger King driving down the street now I don't buy it but I sure smell it right like those brothers from uh Jun City they said what's that smell I said that's Burger King we were getting the Chipotle said that's hard Temptation sometimes but there's a law anytime you want to do good the devil's right there to try to stop you so you got to have that sword of the spirit ready to fight Hallelujah we ready to fight Hallelujah so this time I'm going to find a way to do this amen amen I'm going to find a way to pray find a way to read my Bible I'm going to find a way to witness I'm going to find a way to listen to that sermon praise God am yes but he was honest sometimes I try to find it and I don't find it obviously because he didn't wait long enough because the Bible say you wait on the Lord what happens you renew your strength amen so the church there's that law the law is always going to be there right just like the law of sin and death sin die sin die right it's a law you're always going to find that verse 22 for I Delight in the law of God after the inward man see there's a part of us that inside that really loves the word amen hallelujah right we you know let's be honest there might be days we don't feel like going to church but I tell you once we get here the inward guy gets happy right amen the inward woman starts reing I used guys so I thought I used woman so you understand what I'm talking about the inward part of you now I'm happy now let's sing now praise God isn't that funny you know you struggled all day to do it but you get here it's so easy why cuz we got licks of fire amen there more fire here amen there's more faith there's more confidence in God there's more of Faith here there's more obedience I it's a great atmosphere to worship God hallelujah amen that's why it's so important that we gather together more as we see that day approaching see the inward man Delights in it the fleshly man is contrary to it it's enity it's hatred against God right your flesh don't want to serve God your flesh don't want to obey Paul says but I Delight after the inward man that's how that's how you have to always know that God will forgive you because it wasn't the inward man that sinned it was the outward man right right inward man loves to talk about the word inward man loves to hear sermons and take notes on the Bible and go study it at home the inward man love to do that verse 23 but I see another law in my members Waring against the law of my mind this is why brother calls it the greatest battle ever fought the greatest War that's ever been fought and it brings me into captivity to the law of sin which is in my members now captivity look at that church every time we sin we're LED away captive like we seen that song I'm no stranger to a prison right All My Hope Is In Jesus isn't that true true the Bible said every time we sin we let ourselves be locked in a jail prison but then Jesus every time lets us out praise God Amen he lets us out just by saying I'm sorry forgive me try me again hallelujah amen It Wasn't Me Jesus it was my sin Hallelujah it wasn't the seed that you placed in me it was this awful sinful flesh hallelujah amen and if you really mean it he lets you out amen now you're not a slave anymore now you're a free man or woman amen amen amen that isn't that interesting Church you know it's that it's just quite a thought there every time we sin we become a slave to it for short term right so think about that in and out of jail every day and Jesus keeps letting us out now that's love amen that is Mercy that's Divine longsuffering amen think about that we walk I not say like we commit a sin we get arrested every day put into prison captivity and then we ask for forgiveness and he forgives us and lets us out the same day amen you don't get in there for a week you don't get in there for two weeks it's not a fiveyear sentence amen it's the grace of almighty God now depending on the sin there might be some natural consequences right I'm talking about brother man says minor sins I'm if you got if you're doing major sins you're not born again because you got the fruit of the spirit praise God hallelujah but if your fruit is under death you're not quite born again it's time to get born again praise God Amen and I love this look at he says in verse 24 oh Wretched Man that I am this means Afflicted oh Afflicted man that I am it means enduring toils and troubles oh troubled man that I am anybody ever feel like that you're troubled right I'm Afflicted that's why brother man says we want to be we want to be set free from this uh what do he call it uh stank house what's he what's it called uh I can't remember that pest house there it is there it is sorry I couldn't think of that word there he said this is a pest house like a house of House Of Mice a house of rats we went to the pet store last week I saw a bunch of rats at the pet store pests right bunch of mice and that's what brother says your body is like a pest house full of rats and mice running all over it's just a bunch of it's a it's a corrupted area and Paul says oh Wretched Man that I am who should deliver me from this body of death oh right Church how many desire to have a body that's free from sin amen if you do you're just like Paul amen Paul said this body is wretched this body's Afflicted it's got an awful sin disease it's almost incurable but it is curable when you get a new body praise God it will be curable at the Rapture amen amen when death is swallowed up in life Hallelujah amen he said oh Afflicted man that I am who shall deliver me and then he answers it there's Deliverance in Jesus Christ amen he said I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord so then with the mind I myself serve the law of God Amen but with the flesh the law of sin now brother R tells us this is very interesting he never mentions the soul because remember the soul is the nature of your being but that's not what you serve god with that's the nature that your mind has to draw on praise God Amen your mind has to pray and ask God and you have to pray and say Lord what do you lead me to do and sometimes the spirit of God in your soul and the church said amen will be a still Small Voice or you'll just feel some some leaning from within you it's God speaking to you through the soul but your mind has to be brought into the service of God the mind has to ask the soul what must I do praise God Amen he says I serve God with my mind he didn't say soul right because the soul is sealed to the day of redemption the soul is just a nature nature right nature so is a nature that that that that that's your identity that's what you are but you think and make decisions in your mind and so the Mind must overcome the Mind must draw inspiration from the spirit of God in our soul hallelujah amen amen and this is my service to God let me look up that word serve to be a slave Glory I thought I'd get a few amens on that keep thinking or just keep listening in other words my mind is a slave to my soul amen right that's how we got to look at it we have to make our mind a slave the mind you must do everything the soul says amen amen if not we're going to get into cap captivity it happens at least once a day for most of us yes you might make it a couple of days you might make it like Cam said you might make it a week I don't know all things are possible but pretty soon you're going to fall short yes and that mind needs to get itself back into slavery to the Holy Spirit that's inside of you amen praise God brother says that statement he says all that the believer needs is already inside of you and sometimes isn't funny church sometimes we're looking up to heaven God send me something from heaven and that's you know something could come from heaven but really if the spirit of God is in you then the the direction or the the answer is already in you praise God amen hallelujah it's beautiful oh Afflicted man that I am I'm Afflicted with sin in my members but I thank God through Jesus Christ Our Lord he's going to deliver me hallelujah amen every day brother amen we're promised he's going to deliver us yes amen every day every time we go into captivity sister me God's going to deliver us out of captivity amen he promised Hallelujah that's a promise of God he knows we're wretched of our own selves he knows sin dwells within our members so he's faithful and just to forgive us and Deliver Us from all of our afflictions amen hallelujah now I want to read this quote brother R brother R uh gets asked about Roman 7even I don't know if you've heard this lately if you haven't you're going to like it if you've heard it lately you're going to enjoy it even more questions and answers part four 1964 Romans 7:14 to18 we know that the law is spiritual but I'm carnal sold under sin and then he reads the rest of the verse it says this I cannot understand they ask brother Bram I can't understand what I just read Romans 7 uh 14 to 18 that I do what I hate I don't do what I want to do I'm a Wretched Man and brother B answers this he said well Paul he said speaking to the Romans let me kind of Polish it up so you can see who's ever polished their shoes before I do it once a month or something like that what do polished you makes it more shiny right makes it more clear gets all the dirt off so I like how brother says that to you the word of God's all dirty but let me polish it up so it shines Hallelujah let me polish that up with some prophetic Revelation Hallelujah right now look brother says quote Paul said he said in me is two persons right one wants me to do wrong the other one wants me to do and every time I start to do right then wrong hinders me yes so brother tried to polish It Up by saying you got two persons inside of you you got a good person and you got an evil person yes and the church said amen but said you're outward man which is controlled by six senses I think he means five your inward man controlled by one sense which is Faith and this Faith disagrees with all senses if the senses doesn't agree with faith he's talking about the soul the soul will disagree with anything you see feel taste touch or smell it'll disagree with any of that if we'll listen to our soul he said but one is contrary to the other but as long as your senses agree with faith wonderful but if your senses disagree with faith then leave the senses alone right like an easy example uh you know the sense of smell if you're if you were alcoholic and you smell that beer can you know your senses are telling you to get it but the soul says don't do it so if the senses disagree with the word you got to stay with the word amen right Hallelujah he said Jesus made a statement a promise the inside man says that's true the outside man reasons that it can't be true to you he says then ignore the outside man and accept the inside man that's the same thing Paul was speaking of Hallelujah but said we are carnal and that part must perish but then inside we're Spirit man a soul inside and that's faith in God's word then we bring our entire body under subjection to the word by Faith by accepting what God Said Amen oh church that's when we get Victory when we accept What God Says and when we obey What God Says amen hallelujah brother says this as long as you're in this life you're going to be sticky he's talking about a caber right like a uh like a thorny plant it's got sticky thorns on it he says as long as you're in this light you're going to be sticky and have a carnal nature that's going to bother you as long as you live it's hard to say Amen to that but it's true you're going to be bothered all the days of your life by that other person living inside of you but the inside of you you're born again and when you're raised up you're in the likeness of Christ and all the sin is gone gone from you he says amen he says that's the thing and then he goes to this story of this man in Arizona he was at a Indian reservation and the man would come up and say me sick he'd say me sick me sick how many remember that story me sick me sick brother would pray for him he come back again you need prayer me sick all he knew was me sick well eventually he got saved he got healed in brother man's meetings by Jesus and then he got saved and then he got able to learn some new words brother says someone told me he got got converted and received the Holy Ghost and he said to the the Indian man how you getting along and he said pretty good and pretty bad so if I if I greet you at church and say how you doing brother amen I won't be offended if you say pretty good and pretty bad I won't be offended I know you're talking about a quote he said well how do you mean you're pretty bad and pretty good he called him chief he was the chief of the tribe well since me receive the Holy Ghost he said there's been two dogs inside of me one of them is the bad dog and one of them is the good dog now he says black and white and he said they argue all the time how many ever had arguing mind battles the flesh is saying do this do this you're say no I'm not doing that I know it's wrong I know what the word says well no you should do it you it make you feel better well no it's not it's going to get me grieving the Holy Spirit and they argue back and forth all the time that's right yes that's why sometimes we're not so happy we've had arguments all day but if you were at my house you wouldn't see me argu with my wife it was Jesse arguing with Jesse right all day maybe not all day praise God he said they argue all the time they growl and fight at one another you ever feel like you're growling and fighting inside I just want to do this no you're not doing this I just do it no I don't want to do it the he said the white dog wants me to do good he said the other one wants me to do bad well Chief which one of them wins the fight well that depends on which one Chief feeds the most so I think that's a good answer here see there just depends on the Waring of the body that's in you it depends on which one we cater to which nature you cater to the carnal nature after the things of the world or the spiritual nature after the things of God that does it amen and the church said amen we saw this earlier go to uh Romans I believe it was Romans 5 this just come to my mind right now or was it Romans 6 oh no it's Romans 6 yeah Romans 6 yes we get the same idea Romans 612 let not sin there Reign your mortal body that you should obey it in the lust thereof in other words Church don't let don't let yourself get in a rut where you're addicted to a sin right yes right don't become a slave to that right Don't Let It Rain don't let it rule your life right and you've heard me say this before I ask God this all the time Lord keep me from sinning publicly that I don't bring reproach upon the church or or the people in other words I prayed God let my sin just be private between you and me that's how I want to live so close to God I don't bring any reproach upon the church or the message or the gospel because lots of preachers have brought reproach upon Christ and I pray God just keep please keep me so humble just rebuke me whatever you have to do rebuke me over and over again so that it could just be between you and I and nobody will see my struggles except me and you I must tell Jesus all my struggles praise God yes amen that's been my prayer I don't want sin to Reign Over Me I want to Reign Over sin yes amen because I'm a king you're a king you're a queen sisters you got something to Reign Over praise God Amen you got something to rule over Hallelujah I just I'm going to go and preach this one I just read this this morning in Deuteronomy God told Moses when you get Kings tell those kings they need to write the entire Bible out every day every year did you know that kings were supposed to make a fresh copy of the Bible every year and the Bible said they got to read the Bible every day who does Kings well I'm so busy I have so many responsibilities if you're a king you better read the word every single day hallelujah amen the only way he said your heart won't get turned away by chariots I need more chariots I need more money I or women right or wives or sexual Temptation uh and then he says uh other temptation Kings will or money all these things Wars and soldiers he says You must write the word of God out every day every year make a new Bible every year read the Bible every day study the Bible That's how you overcome this is how you fight your battles Kings amen amen and sisters that's how Queens fight their battles hallelujah amen amen I've never done that read the Bible in a year thing usually takes me a little longer because I I can't just read the Bible I've got to preach the Bible but there's no law that says you have to you know that's just a suggestion for kings of course their Bible is a lot shorter than ours is he only had the first five books of the Torah that been pretty easy to get through that in a year but the point is if you want to Reign spiritually if you want to Reign Over sin you got to take the word of God in every day that's the way Kings fight that's the way the Kings rule verse 13 now here here this now brother this is what brother says K he used the word hater but the Bible uses yield same word yield neither yield your members as instruments of unrighteousness Unto sin but yield yourselves unto God as those that are alive from the dead and your members as instruments of righteous unto God remember your mind is an instrument God wants to use God wants you to think about holy things yes amen your tongue and vocal cords are an instrument God's want to use for you to testify amen to praise His name yield your words to that Hallelujah yield your mind use your actions Let The Works of your hands glorify God I love what the Bible said about Joseph everything he did God prospered it praise God everything his hand touched it was blessed amen hallelujah we just passed 5,000 downloads on the podcast I thought see everything we put our hand to God blesses amen amen amen hallelujah that's what we want to be we want to be just unit to God Lord my I'm my vocal cords are yielded my hands my mind especially our mind needs to be yielded to God's word hallelujah cuz that's the greatest battle that's where we're either captive to slavery to sin or we're free men and women walking after the holy spirit amen amen now I'm going to close with this here musicians Mal is not ready so let's stand though let's stand I'm going to close with this testimony just a reminder of the grace of God to me thank you man God perfect timing there bud musicians can come I'm gonna let this be public too kind of involves my wife I guess I'll try to relate this if the Holy Spirit would bring me something to this I guess you know I just relate it like this you know my wife uh so Sunday night uh after church we went home and um you everybody left which was that was fine but the uh The Junction City Saints stayed after and they had questions for me okay they had questions like the sisters they wondered about those cloths that they wear you ever see them wear of course you probably see them wear the cloths that was a question um they had a question about uh ties and offerings so I try to answer that I I recorded the I recorded the entire uh conversation but God was really moving in in our midst there God was really moving uh I I can I watch I was watching faces brother said you can see when Satan gets upset on people's faces right and so I just you know I felt the leadership of the Holy Spirit God was bringing me verses I just kind of felt like I was I was doing the will of God so so we were here probably till like 4:30 maybe I don't know and I stayed after to clean up there you know but uh that night I went home and uh I went to bed and this is kind of just like a something that never happened to me before now amen this might happened to you one time uh I was sleeping I woke up at 1 or 1:30 a.m. and I could not breathe no air was getting in I've never had this happen it was one of the scariest moments of My Life um and I sat up and I'm like I'm going to try not to be too dramatic here I could not breathe I couldn't get any any air in no air was coming out and I'm like you know Christian's like what what's going on what's going on you know um I've never had this happen before and so um I didn't know what to do but I've choked I've choked before on food and so I went and got some water well I thought the only thing you know I'm just you know I'm just standing there like by the bed I don't know what's going on and in my mind I'm thinking this is it you're going to die thank God it wasn't um all I can think of in a moment was just run to the bathroom try to get some water so I ran into the bathroom there and then Kristen followed me you know she's going she's really upset I'm upset and I'm like and then Kristen's like do you want me to do the heick I couldn't talk all they I couldn't talk and uh all of a sudden she did the heck when she did the heck she just said Jesus Jesus Jesus and as soon as she said Jesus it's like something clicked and like the window opened amen amen I mean this was I don't know how many seconds it was but I didn't have air for a while I didn't see anything closing in but I'm like I'm going to die I'm going to die right here in my bathroom as soon as she said Jesus it's like the window open and I could breathe a little bit and eventually I cough cough cough um and so you know Christen was extremely scared right well I you know the next day I didn't think much of it and I thought you know I thought well maybe uh I sleep with my mouth open and maybe my throat got too dry and Kristen said I think it was a spiritual attack of Satan she's like you should check and see if there was any testimonies from Sunday and have you ever had that brother where you can't breathe in your bed or something like that I know a couple of Brothers Simons had it and it was an attack of the enemy right and I've never had that before but as soon as she said Jesus Jesus now in my mind I was like water water you know like my in other words my mind was so car thank God for a Godly wife yes my carnal mind I I didn't think of I just think of water because I was in a carnal condition the Bible says we're carnal sold under sin and so I texted the sisters and the brothers that came and one of the sisters said sure enough when we were in that meeting she said I was I don't know if you saw it she said I was battling depression for 2 weeks because somebody called me up and said I'm condemned I'm not going to get the Holy Ghost and she said when I taught that about the head coverings when I taught through the scriptures she said that depression left and she left here full of joy and she got all of her Victory back and brother even said it when people get deliverances those demons would follow him to the hotel room and sometimes you have to fight them off let me know if you want those quotes they would follow him to the hotel room and try to torment him I'm not saying what that what I'm not saying that's what happened but that's what I think happened because I've never had anything like that before and so I've been reminded this week of the importance of calling on Jesus also the mortality of all of us if time goes on one day I'll breathe my last breath when I do that I want people to be singing about Jesus shouting the name of Jesus Hallelujah I was reminded of mortality it's a real thing I was also reminded on the power of calling on the name of Jesus Christ so that's just a little testimony I thought I'd share not really sure I could tie that into the message but I just want to encourage you you know in our weaknesses and our strengths he'll come Deliver Us praise God I was certainly delivered on Sunday night think about that Christmas see it was already Christmas day it was already 1 1 1:00 a.m. 1:30 but God was gracious to to me God was gracious to me so I want to give God thanks praise God let's bow our heads for a word of prayer here if you have a song brother amen do you have a song or anything you want to sing okay praise God hallelujah let's have a word of Prayer by the grace of God here play himym of Heaven you know we were uh Jose sang that I really enjoyed that hym of Heaven these things kind of make me think of Heaven that's what Kristen said she said Jesse it reminded me of my Mor of your mortality of our mortality one day if God carries we'll pass beyond the veil I just heard brother Ram say this week he said I'm so glad I settled that question many years ago he said I told Jesus I don't want any trouble down at the river how many want how many want a safe passage at the river praise God am you want the Angels just to Faithfully escort you to the throat of God hallelujah that's what I one praise God just thankful that the spirit delivers us in our weaknesses in our infirmities in our trials the holy spirit is faithful that was a very scary moment but Jesus Christ came to deliver it started by calling on the name of Jesus Heavenly Father we thank you Lord God lord and I just share this testimony just to encourage the Saints and I share it because I want to give you thanks Lord God you spared my life or maybe you spared me brain damage who knows I might have passed out and hit my head I don't know the floor is very hard in there but Lord I just want to take a moment and say thank you for sparing me this week Lord God when I couldn't breathe and I'm looking for a natural answer my wife calls on the spiritual answer and I don't think it was the heck I think it was the name of Jesus cuz she didn't do that too long on [Music] me Lord I want to thank you for setting that sister free from depression Lord God she was depressed for 2 weeks but thank you Jesus you're the deliverer oh Wretched Man that I am each one of us brought into captivity of our own sin but thanks be to God hallelujah who delivers us thanks be to God who sets us free [Music] hallelujah oh Wretched Man that I Am Lord God thank you for the victory in the name
