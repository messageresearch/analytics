[38:55] [Music]
[39:03] [Music]
[39:15] [Applause]

[41:17] [Music]
[41:23] [Music]
[41:34] [Applause]
[41:42] thank God for His goodness praise the
[41:44] Lord let's stand to our feet let's sing
[41:45] one more song here as our brother Brian
[41:47] comes to minister God's word for us how
[41:49] many
[41:57] so busy it wouldn't have been fair to
[42:02] you all I told brother Jesse early in
[42:04] the week I said it wouldn't be fair to
[42:06] the Saints you know that I wouldn't have
[42:07] been able to dedicate my time to study
[42:09] in prayer it just wouldn't have been
[42:11] fair to you folks and so if I come it's
[42:16] it's a struggle when I go out anywhere
[42:17] just to try to preach the word just
[42:19] because I want to find the mind of God
[42:21] and then sometimes panic sets in when
[42:25] when things aren't I don't think that
[42:27] it's right you know it's uh from not in
[42:30] the in that will but my son had
[42:32] graduated we had a graduation party last
[42:34] week and uh June and July as it's really
[42:38] busy months for us so I just thank God
[42:41] for what he's what he's done for us and
[42:46] just the wonderful family that I have my
[42:49] natural family and my spiritual family
[42:52] just the wonderful works that he's done
[42:54] with us just appreciate him I'm also
[43:00] glad that I'm here before brother Jim
[43:03] he's a much better preacher you know the
[43:05] ending of a thing is better than the
[43:07] beginning so when he when he comes by
[43:09] God's grace you'll be treated real well
[43:11] to some good ministry
[43:13] I think highly of our pastor just a
[43:16] wonderful man and and we always want to
[43:18] not just him but every pastor that's out
[43:21] there you know he lifts your pastor up
[43:22] you know pray for wisdom that he would
[43:24] receive wisdom and because that's that's
[43:28] what he's feeding you with so if you
[43:30] want to be blessed and pray for the one
[43:32] that's going to feed you you know so and
[43:35] you're going to eat at your own risk
[43:37] how's that if you don't pray for him
[43:40] you're not gonna get fed you're gonna
[43:41] starve to death amen so if we just think
[43:44] thank God for four men of God that are
[43:47] duty bound and standing their post of
[43:50] duty then let's read Isaiah 59 and 19
[43:56] says so shall they fear the name of the
[44:01] Lord from the West and his glory from
[44:03] the rising of the Sun when the enemy
[44:06] shall come in like a flood the Spirit of
[44:09] the Lord shall lift up a standard
[44:11] against him hey man let's bow our heads
[44:15] most gracious Heavenly Father it's with
[44:18] great honor and great humility to that
[44:21] stand here before you and your people
[44:23] this morning and fathers I think your
[44:26] brother Prakash so many times saying
[44:27] there's nothing good in me and Lord I
[44:29] feel the same way there's nothing good
[44:30] in me except which you have placed there
[44:32] you've taken out the the heart of stone
[44:34] and know you've replaced it with a flesh
[44:37] heart or God and I just appreciate the
[44:39] change that you've made in all of our
[44:40] lives but lord if there's one here that
[44:43] needs that changing I pray that you
[44:45] would speak to their hearts this morning
[44:47] that you would send that changing to
[44:49] them also Oh father the Lord is I want
[44:53] to be dependent on you this morning and
[44:55] and not upon myself I don't just give me
[44:59] that gift that the Prophet spoke about
[45:01] many times about getting himself out of
[45:03] the way lord I just pray that you would
[45:05] send the same gift and let your spirit
[45:07] just have it's have its way this morning
[45:09] that you would have preeminence in this
[45:11] service and I pray that you regard my
[45:12] lips that I wouldn't say anything
[45:13] contrary to your word the Lord I'll just
[45:19] pray that you would be glorified and
[45:20] that your children would be edified Lord
[45:23] we ask it in your precious name our Lord
[45:24] Jesus Christ amen thank you Lord you may
[45:27] be seated just kind of want to talk to
[45:31] you for a little bit one I like to get
[45:35] get calmed down a little bit so I I
[45:37] talked a little bit beforehand it's it's
[45:39] been a little while since I've I've
[45:42] ministered and it's been I don't know
[45:45] how I don't know when the last time I
[45:46] was here but it seems like forever
[45:49] [Laughter]
[45:51] so I thank brother Jesse for inviting me
[45:53] and uh I do have a lot of scripture
[45:57] today so bear with me
[46:00] it might seem it I have a lot of
[46:04] Scripture but it's not exhaustive but
[46:06] you might think that it's exhaustive
[46:07] that I hope I don't bore you but I'd
[46:11] rather his I'd rather be his word so I
[46:13] can get it out than just my word so it's
[46:16] uh and also bear with me if I end up
[46:19] running because I I can I get excited
[46:22] when I talk about this stuff and
[46:24] and just when I think about I don't know
[46:27] if y'all knew just kind of this year in
[46:32] January well beforehand I was past four
[46:35] years since 2015 I've been having some
[46:37] health issues I think 2016 I had three
[46:42] surgeries that year and January ended up
[46:46] with a bowel blockage and then I had
[46:50] three surgeries this year I had insert
[46:52] another bowel surgery and and a couple
[46:55] other things that had happened but I
[46:58] just think God for all the prayers I
[47:01] don't know if if it extended here or not
[47:03] if y'all had received prayer requests
[47:05] but I thank God that he's healed me and
[47:07] brother brother Jesse he'd asked me how
[47:12] I was feeling in the office and I said I
[47:14] feel great people at work have been
[47:15] asking me how you feel and I say I feel
[47:17] great I feel fantastic you know and it's
[47:20] all by God yeah I told brother Jesse I
[47:23] said when the doctors say and my wife
[47:24] was sitting in the office with me so she
[47:26] knows what the surgeon says and he said
[47:28] I don't know what else to do there's
[47:30] nothing there's nothing that I can do
[47:32] and and the GI doctor they don't know
[47:34] what to do there's nothing then they
[47:36] could do and I just can't help but think
[47:37] of that woman that had the blood issue
[47:38] for 12 years she spent all their money
[47:40] she went to the doctor she did
[47:41] everything that they could and they said
[47:43] that there's nothing else that they
[47:44] could do but what happened because there
[47:46] was nothing else that man could do that
[47:48] we don't put our trust in man God was
[47:50] able to come on that scene a man and I
[47:52] just thank God that he came and touched
[47:54] me in my body amen and it's so great to
[47:57] say that I'm not in pain because there
[47:59] were times that I'd wake up in the
[48:01] morning I was in pain I'd go throughout
[48:03] the day I try to do something out in the
[48:04] garage just try to do something because
[48:06] I'm the type of guy that I can't stand
[48:08] sitting around my wife yelled at me
[48:10] several times that I should be resting
[48:12] and relaxing but it's hard for me so it
[48:14] really plays a battle on my mind and
[48:17] that if I sit there I go stir-crazy
[48:20] because I know there's there's something
[48:21] to do and uh but I'd go out in their
[48:26] garage in about five ten minutes later
[48:28] I'd have to go back in because I was
[48:29] hurting so bad and I don't like taking
[48:32] pills and I'd be laying there and I'd be
[48:34] hurt and she'd come in well did you take
[48:35] a pain pill well no I wanted to take a
[48:38] pain
[48:38] he'll cuz I don't want to take a pain I
[48:41] want God to touch me I want touched I
[48:43] want his healing hand to be upon me but
[48:46] I ended up taking a pain pill a little
[48:48] bit after cuz you know and then it
[48:50] seemed like a little after I take a pain
[48:52] pill and you're looking for that four
[48:55] hour mark where you could take another
[48:56] one cuz it just didn't do anything and
[48:58] I'm not trying to I'm trying to exalt
[49:02] God is what I'm trying to do here
[49:03] because I just thank God for a saving
[49:06] touch and I thank God for a wonderful
[49:08] family that my kids they would write
[49:12] little notes to me you know just
[49:14] encouraging me and giving me scripture
[49:16] and that just means so much to me and I
[49:18] might not have told them but it means a
[49:20] lot to me because it helps me it knows
[49:23] that I know that they're reading in the
[49:25] scripture and they're they're wanting to
[49:26] be an encouragement and that's my desire
[49:28] here today that's why I Minister the
[49:30] Word of God because I just want to be an
[49:31] encouragement if I can be an
[49:33] encouragement to one person that's all
[49:35] that matters you might somebody might
[49:36] think that I'm boring that and that's
[49:38] fine as long as I can reach one person
[49:39] that's struggling in their life and if
[49:41] it helps them overcome then it doesn't
[49:43] matter all else is all else is fodder
[49:45] not to say that everybody's here fodder
[49:47] to forgive me I don't I don't mean that
[49:48] everybody means everybody means
[49:50] something but I just want to help one
[49:53] person that's my desire and I know my
[49:56] kids have the the same desire and it's
[49:58] it's so wonderful to know that they want
[50:00] to carry on the same that they want to
[50:02] help somebody that they they have the
[50:03] same heart all my kids have been
[50:05] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[50:08] save one and he's only three but I look
[50:11] forward to whenever he's ready you know
[50:13] that we baptize him - so how much more
[50:16] can a daddy be blessed bear with me I'm
[50:20] not a preacher like brother Jesse I
[50:22] think barely very highly brother Jesse
[50:24] he's a magnificent preacher teacher a
[50:27] very good teacher but uh
[50:31] and also I know Memorial Day and
[50:34] Independence Day of past but bear with
[50:36] me through the well what I'd like to
[50:39] speak on this morning is raising the
[50:41] standard now as we read in Isaiah 59 in
[50:45] 19 the end of that verse it says the
[50:49] Spirit of the Lord shall lift up a
[50:50] standard against them if
[50:52] I'm sure people that have gone through
[50:54] school they have an idea of what
[50:56] standard means but here I'm the kind of
[50:58] person that likes to go it click on the
[51:01] word to see what it actually means in
[51:03] that verse because we in the English
[51:06] language we have many words there it's
[51:09] the same word but it has different
[51:10] meanings it'll have multiple meanings so
[51:13] it behooves us to go and see what that
[51:16] word actually means in that particular
[51:19] text because if you go with it with the
[51:22] assumption that it means something that
[51:23] you already know and you try to apply it
[51:25] then it it absolutely doesn't mean that
[51:29] so bear with me a little bit standard
[51:32] here in this particular verse means to
[51:35] flee to escape to take flight to depart
[51:40] to disappear to drive hastily to costs
[51:46] or to cause to disappear or to hide so
[51:50] in the enemy will read that verse so so
[51:53] shall they fear the name of the Lord
[51:55] from the west and his glory from the
[51:57] rising of the Sun which we know that it
[51:59] would be the East so from the east to
[52:01] the west you know that they fear the
[52:04] name of the Lord when the enemy shall
[52:06] come in like a flood the Spirit of the
[52:08] Lord shall raise up a way of escape
[52:12] against him so when you're up against
[52:15] the enemy he's providing a way to be
[52:18] driven out hastily - he's given it
[52:20] provided away for an escape to flee to
[52:23] escape the situation amen
[52:25] in Psalms 27 and 5 it says for in the
[52:30] time of trouble he shall hide me in his
[52:32] pavilion is that right Amen isn't it so
[52:34] great to be hidden in his civilian in
[52:36] the secret of his Tabernacle shall he
[52:39] hide me he shall set me up upon a rock
[52:41] he's the one who set me up upon the rock
[52:44] he's the one who's hiding me
[52:45] he's the one who's delivering me from
[52:47] the problems in the situation's Amen
[52:49] Psalm 17 in verse 6 it says I have
[52:52] called upon me for that won't hear me
[52:55] isn't that great to know that he will
[52:57] hear us amen
[52:58] he says I am called upon me for that one
[53:01] hear me that assurance that David had
[53:03] wrote this poem the assurance that he
[53:06] knows that God is going to hear him
[53:07] he says incline thine ear unto me and
[53:10] hear my speech show thy marvelous
[53:12] loving-kindness oh now that save is by
[53:14] the right hand and pay attention to this
[53:16] right hand as we go through that that's
[53:19] save us by thy right hand them which put
[53:22] their trust in thee from those that rise
[53:24] up against them keep me as the apple of
[53:27] the eye hide me under the shadow of thy
[53:29] wings from the wicked that oppressed me
[53:32] from my deadly enemies who can pass me
[53:34] about now so I'm 60 and starting in the
[53:37] eleventh verse it says give us help from
[53:40] trouble for vain is the help of man as I
[53:43] said that we know that man cannot get
[53:45] it's great that men wants to help us but
[53:48] that's not where we put our trust we
[53:50] might give men honor but we don't give
[53:53] them our full trust because you never
[53:54] well I better stay away from that man
[53:58] can always fail man has always given up
[54:01] on his covenant with God is that right
[54:02] so man is the one who's always failed
[54:04] God has always kept every single
[54:06] covenant that he has given man man is
[54:09] the one who's always always always
[54:11] broken the Covenant so we know that God
[54:15] is faithful man is not Amen now let's
[54:20] turn to Exodus 17 in verse 9 I told you
[54:25] I had a lot of scriptures I'll get you
[54:27] some exercise and flipping through the
[54:29] Bible you know they say that the average
[54:32] buyer or the average home has about 9
[54:34] Bibles and it and I think I told this
[54:36] story here before but there's a maid
[54:39] that was cleaning the house and the
[54:41] owner came home and they were looking
[54:42] for the for the Bible and they had asked
[54:45] the maid have you seen my Bible and she
[54:49] said you know how many houses I go into
[54:50] and I see the Bible and I'll hide it and
[54:52] nobody ever asked for it and you're the
[54:55] first person who asked for it yeah so I
[54:57] hope your Bible hasn't collected dust if
[54:59] it has throughout the week we'll we'll
[55:00] tear that dust off this week a man will
[55:02] tear it off this morning
[55:03] and Moses said unto Joshua choose us out
[55:08] men and go go out fight with Amalek now
[55:13] I don't know about you but that just
[55:15] reminds me of another scripture over in
[55:16] mark 16
[55:17] he says go ye out into the world and
[55:19] preach the gospel to every creature amen
[55:22] [Laughter]
[55:24] and tomorrow and now I'll get back to
[55:29] that and tomorrow I will stand on the
[55:32] top of the hill with the rod of God in
[55:34] my hand so Joshua did as Moses had said
[55:37] to him and fraught with Amalek and Moses
[55:39] Aaron and Hur went up to the top of the
[55:42] hill and it came to pass when Moses held
[55:44] up his hand that Israel prevailed and
[55:46] when he let down his hand Amalek prevail
[55:49] but Moses hands were very heavy there
[55:52] excuse me we're heavy and they took a
[55:54] stone and put it under him and he sat
[55:56] thereon and Aaron and her stayed up his
[55:59] hands see they're helping Moses to hold
[56:01] his hands up because whenever he lowered
[56:03] his hands the enemy was winning but when
[56:05] his hands were up in there and praising
[56:07] thank Thanksgiving to God and Dwalin and
[56:09] God is he had the victories raised in
[56:11] his hand he was able to overcome the
[56:13] enemy amen
[56:14] so here Aaron in her his brethren a
[56:17] brother and a brother-in-law because I
[56:19] think I hers is Marian's husband so his
[56:22] brothers were there helping him know
[56:24] overcome so you call out to your
[56:25] brethren for help amen amen
[56:28] that's a wonderful example to Christians
[56:30] in this day amen
[56:32] but her Erin and her stayed up his hands
[56:35] the one on the one side and the other on
[56:36] the other side his hands were steady
[56:38] until the going down to the Sun and
[56:40] Joshua discovered Amalek and his people
[56:42] with the edge of the sword and the Lord
[56:44] said unto Moses write this for a
[56:47] memorial in a book and rehearse it in
[56:49] the ears of Joshua for I will utterly
[56:52] put out the remembrance of Amalek from
[56:53] under heaven
[56:54] he didn't say from the earth he said
[56:56] from heaven and Moses built an altar and
[57:00] called the name of it
[57:02] Jehovah Nissi for he said because the
[57:04] Lord has sworn that the Lord will have
[57:07] war with Emelec from generation to
[57:10] generation
[57:10] now Amalek is a constant agitation to
[57:13] Israel is that right
[57:14] so therefore it's a type of the flesh
[57:16] because we have this we have this flesh
[57:18] it's a it's a constant agitation in our
[57:21] lives is that right
[57:22] it's a day-to-day battle now you sit
[57:25] down jesus said when I said March 16
[57:28] jesus said go ye out into the world
[57:30] you're going to go
[57:31] to the world now preach the gospel this
[57:33] is not an easy thing to go out and
[57:34] preach the gospel because he also said
[57:36] that I send you out amongst wolves is
[57:38] that right so it's not going to be an
[57:40] easy task so it's not so much it's great
[57:44] to have somebody with you it's great to
[57:45] go in pairs because there's strength in
[57:47] numbers is that right but it's it's
[57:49] behooves you more to have the Spirit of
[57:51] the Lord with you then having a brother
[57:53] or sister with you is that right amen so
[57:57] but during this battle and like I said
[58:00] when Moses the hands were lowered that
[58:03] they were defeated the enemy was
[58:05] defeating Israel but when their their
[58:07] hands was raised in the air that's when
[58:09] they were too able to defeat the enemy
[58:16] but when we it shows that when we try to
[58:19] do it independently by ourselves we get
[58:21] wore out we get so tired we can't press
[58:23] on but when we join forces when we join
[58:26] forces that's when we're able to
[58:29] overcome and become the victors they men
[58:31] because it's nice iron sharpens iron
[58:33] it's nice to know and when I was down in
[58:36] the dumps I was getting into a depressed
[58:38] state there my children were giving me
[58:40] scripture there people were calling me
[58:41] text me saying we're praying for you
[58:43] just giving you encouragement and
[58:45] brother Justin reminded me of something
[58:47] that I preached here about the Eagles
[58:48] giving strength to one another you know
[58:50] feeding them meat the Eagles that of the
[58:52] older the elder Eagles that have gone
[58:54] through situations were dropping meat
[58:56] down to the younger Eagles helping to
[58:57] revive them because they've been through
[58:59] those situations and knowing that eating
[59:01] the meat of the word will give strength
[59:03] and build you up and help you to
[59:05] overcome is that right
[59:07] praise God now Jehovah Nissi everybody
[59:10] knows what that means it's one of the
[59:11] seven compounding the redemptive days of
[59:14] of Christ
[59:15] herve God Jehovah Nissi means God is my
[59:19] banner now what is a banner now this is
[59:23] going with standard this is a standard a
[59:26] banner is a flag a standard and ensign
[59:30] Jesus Christ as our ensign is he not and
[59:33] a rallying point something lifted up a
[59:36] signal poll a rallying point does
[59:40] everybody know what a rallying point us
[59:41] it's when you say hey everybody over
[59:43] here you know
[59:44] somebody's getting thumped on by a gang
[59:46] you're calling out to your friends am
[59:47] overhear rally over here this is where
[59:49] the fight is hey man so that's a
[59:52] rallying point you're calling the troops
[59:54] you're calling for backup but a banner
[59:58] is something that identifies and unifies
[1:00:00] a particular group of people for example
[1:00:03] a military flag or standard is sometimes
[1:00:06] called a banner
[1:00:08] IRA's caught also called Old Glory the
[1:00:12] Israelites saying the Lord is my banner
[1:00:15] was a way of identifying themselves as
[1:00:18] the unified followers of the Lord God a
[1:00:22] banner also functions as a rallying
[1:00:25] point for troops in a battle we'll get
[1:00:27] to that here in a second the author
[1:00:30] Moses built in Exodus 17 marked the
[1:00:33] place where God intervened on behalf of
[1:00:35] his people and promised to utterly
[1:00:37] defeat his enemies first Corinthians 10
[1:00:44] and 13 it says there had no temptation
[1:00:50] taken you but such as is common to man
[1:00:53] but God is faithful who will not suffer
[1:00:58] you to be tempted above that ye are able
[1:01:01] but with the temptation also make a way
[1:01:05] to escape that standard we were talking
[1:01:07] about in Isaiah 59 he makes a way of
[1:01:09] escape that you may be able to bear it
[1:01:12] you can overcome it it might seem a
[1:01:14] little bit strong right now but just
[1:01:16] hold on a little bit longer there's too
[1:01:18] much of it
[1:01:19] there's too much suicides going on if
[1:01:21] these people just hold on a little bit
[1:01:23] longer there is light at the end of the
[1:01:25] tunnel there is a promise there is a
[1:01:26] hope of glory just hold on a little bit
[1:01:28] longer amen you're wondering if God
[1:01:31] really exists hold on he'll show himself
[1:01:33] amen he is faithful he is true just hold
[1:01:36] on a little bit longer you know it says
[1:01:41] here but with the temptation also make a
[1:01:43] way of escape that way jesus said that I
[1:01:46] am the way I am the truth and I am the
[1:01:48] life is that right so here is the way
[1:01:50] that will bring you out is that right
[1:01:52] instead of waving the flag of surrender
[1:01:54] sound the trumpet for help raise a
[1:01:57] standard and shout
[1:01:58] the bellow cried a rattle his troops
[1:02:01] Matthew 24 and 27 it says for is the
[1:02:04] Lightning cometh out of the east and
[1:02:06] shyness even unto the West so shall also
[1:02:10] the coming of the Son of man be
[1:02:12] for who excuse me for wheresoever the
[1:02:14] carcasses
[1:02:15] there were the Eagles be gathered
[1:02:17] together amen carcass what does the
[1:02:20] carcass everybody knows what a carcass
[1:02:22] is it is something dead if you see an
[1:02:25] animal carcass on the road you see a
[1:02:27] dead animal on the road now you can look
[1:02:29] at that metaphorically to say that
[1:02:30] somebody has fallen down so where so
[1:02:32] wherever the carcass is wheresoever and
[1:02:34] brother/sister has fallen down there
[1:02:36] where the Eagles be gathered to continue
[1:02:38] to give them that meat to encourage them
[1:02:40] to help them up him and lifting up amen
[1:02:42] so wherever that carcass is the Eagles
[1:02:45] the strong bird the strong bear no other
[1:02:48] bird could fly as high as that Eagle
[1:02:50] amen
[1:02:51] whoo I never realized that until this
[1:02:58] weekend about the carcass cuz you always
[1:03:00] think of something dead
[1:03:01] well where's wherever the Eagles are
[1:03:02] gathered but if you read before that and
[1:03:04] after that it's talking about something
[1:03:06] that has fallen down excuse me before
[1:03:08] that matter talks about about now I
[1:03:11] can't remember what it is now about
[1:03:13] raising up and I think it's a part of
[1:03:15] the rapture shortly after that talking
[1:03:18] about going away so when you see
[1:03:21] somebody down gather together strengthen
[1:03:26] numbers
[1:03:27] rally the troops together amen there's
[1:03:30] nothing more important than a good
[1:03:31] old-fashioned prayer meeting hey man if
[1:03:37] any man be sick among you call upon the
[1:03:39] elders and they shall lay hands on you
[1:03:41] and you shall recover did not God say I
[1:03:44] am the healer of all thy diseases I'm
[1:03:46] kind of getting off my nose right now
[1:03:47] but God said and over in Psalms don't
[1:03:51] forget all of my benefits for I am the
[1:03:53] healer of all all all my diseases every
[1:03:58] single disease there is a one that's
[1:04:00] gonna overcome him amen God is true
[1:04:03] strong for that
[1:04:04] Amen there are other false gods out
[1:04:06] there but they're not real gods at all
[1:04:08] you know there's many gods but they're
[1:04:11] false gods
[1:04:12] stand up to our Lord God and Savior a
[1:04:14] man but God is my banner
[1:04:18] you know lifted up let's turn to numbers
[1:04:21] 21 and verse sake am I going a little
[1:04:29] too fast this morning this is like the
[1:04:33] most personable church I know you're
[1:04:35] gonna have a conversation across it both
[1:04:37] it yeah it's kind of neat having a small
[1:04:40] a small group but numbers 21 and 8 where
[1:04:47] we read what a banner was lifting up a
[1:04:50] signal pole I can't think of a better
[1:04:52] signal pole than this uh it says and the
[1:04:56] Lord said unto Moses make the a fiery
[1:04:58] Serpent and set it upon a pole now let's
[1:05:01] kind of get a background here if you
[1:05:03] don't know this story before here the
[1:05:06] children of Israel were just complaining
[1:05:07] and whining and just bickering amongst
[1:05:09] themselves having to having fights here
[1:05:11] fights there and nothing was going right
[1:05:13] for them you know just just like how we
[1:05:15] get sometimes in a sinner position
[1:05:17] you're just so lost you can't gain any
[1:05:19] ground you know you're just you're
[1:05:21] trying to tread water but you're making
[1:05:23] no progress that because that way is
[1:05:26] death we know the wages of sin is death
[1:05:28] so there's no progress there is no life
[1:05:31] to a sinful life amen
[1:05:33] to the the to a sinful way so therefore
[1:05:36] this is why God has written God has told
[1:05:40] Moses to raise us this fiery serpent he
[1:05:42] says and the Lord said unto Moses make
[1:05:44] the a fiery Serpent and set it apart a
[1:05:46] pole and his shall come to pass that
[1:05:48] every one that has bitten when he
[1:05:50] looketh upon it shall live and Moses
[1:05:53] made a serpent of brass and put it apart
[1:05:55] a pole and it came to pass that if the
[1:05:57] serpent had bitten any man when he
[1:05:59] beheld the serpent of brass he lived
[1:06:02] so something lifted up it's just like in
[1:06:05] John I want to see on three and 14 this
[1:06:11] is the parallel of that scripture that
[1:06:12] we just read and it says and as Moses
[1:06:17] lifted up the serpent in the wilderness
[1:06:18] even so must the Son of Man be lifted up
[1:06:22] so I can't see more of a signal Pole
[1:06:26] of life and of rallying than Jesus
[1:06:28] Christ amen and then it says that
[1:06:30] whosoever believeth in him should not
[1:06:32] perish but have eternal life now they're
[1:06:35] to say that a separated people know it's
[1:06:38] so in John 3:16 it says for God so loved
[1:06:42] the world it wasn't just specific people
[1:06:47] for God so loved the world that He gave
[1:06:49] His only begotten Son that whosoever
[1:06:52] believeth in him shall not should not
[1:06:55] perish but have everlasting life now we
[1:06:57] know that their vessels of Honor vessels
[1:07:00] of dishonor we know that the certain
[1:07:02] ones can't come to that perfection they
[1:07:05] can't come to see that Jesus Christ is
[1:07:07] the truth the life in the way they
[1:07:09] cannot repent because we know that
[1:07:11] that's one seed that will not get there
[1:07:13] we know that there's a seed of God
[1:07:15] that's that's going to receive the word
[1:07:18] and to be able to accept the word and
[1:07:20] continue in his and his laws or in his
[1:07:24] statutes or anything that would when you
[1:07:26] hear the word you say yes Lord you might
[1:07:29] have a little rebellion afterwards but I
[1:07:31] know there's there's a scripture in the
[1:07:33] New Testament where the father said go
[1:07:34] into this and the man said no I'm not
[1:07:36] going to do that but what happened he
[1:07:38] turned and went the other way he
[1:07:40] repented and said yes I will do this
[1:07:42] thing but there was another son that
[1:07:44] said yeah I'll go and do it but he went
[1:07:46] the other way and didn't do it so we
[1:07:49] know that there's a certain group that's
[1:07:50] going to be able to accept it there's a
[1:07:52] certain group that then that the one
[1:07:54] that can and one that cannot is that
[1:07:56] right so I strongly suggest that you
[1:08:00] look into your lives and see if you're
[1:08:02] responding to the Word of God to see if
[1:08:04] you're accepting the Word of God or not
[1:08:12] Philippians 2 and 9
[1:08:29] it says wherefore this is also talking
[1:08:31] about God as my banner wherefore God
[1:08:34] also hath highly exalted him and given
[1:08:36] him a name which is above every name
[1:08:39] that at the name of Jesus every knee
[1:08:42] should bow of things in heaven and
[1:08:45] things in earth and things under the
[1:08:47] earth and that every tongue should
[1:08:49] confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the
[1:08:52] glory of God the Father so whether it's
[1:08:59] a believer or non-believer one way or
[1:09:02] another you're going to bow the knee one
[1:09:06] way or another you're gonna bow the knee
[1:09:09] in acts 2 and I'm just kind of going
[1:09:12] through it I hope this helps somebody
[1:09:14] this morning X 2 and 29 I could be a
[1:09:25] talker out out of Muenster I could talk
[1:09:27] your ear off I could talk to people all
[1:09:28] day long but but sometimes here you know
[1:09:31] thoughts kind of escape a little bit so
[1:09:33] I have to stay and stay with the
[1:09:36] scripture I've never been accused or
[1:09:42] guilty of being able to think real well
[1:09:45] on my feet
[1:09:45] [Laughter]
[1:09:49] my perfect vision isn't ice a pine site
[1:09:53] [Laughter]
[1:09:55] X 2 and 29 it says men and brethren let
[1:09:59] me freely speak unto you of the
[1:10:01] patriarch David that he is both dead and
[1:10:04] buried and his Sepulchre is with us unto
[1:10:07] this day therefore being a prophet did
[1:10:12] you know King David was a prophet
[1:10:14] therefore being a prophet and knowing
[1:10:17] that God had sworn with an oath to him
[1:10:19] that of the fruit of his loins according
[1:10:22] to the flesh according to the flesh
[1:10:24] that's very important he would raise up
[1:10:27] Christ to sit on his throne he's seeing
[1:10:30] this before spake of the resurrection of
[1:10:33] Christ that his soul was not left in
[1:10:35] Hell neither his flesh did see
[1:10:37] corruption
[1:10:38] Jesus hath God raised up where of we all
[1:10:41] are witnesses therefore being by the
[1:10:45] right hand there's the right hand again
[1:10:47] therefore being by the right hand of God
[1:10:50] exalted and having received of the
[1:10:52] father the promise of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:54] he has shed forth this which he now seen
[1:10:57] here for David is not ascended David is
[1:11:02] not ascended and it's not the Prophet
[1:11:05] that has ascended for you amen for David
[1:11:08] is not ascended into the heavens but he
[1:11:11] sayeth himself the Lord saith unto my
[1:11:13] lord sit thou on my right hand there's
[1:11:17] the right hand again until I make thy
[1:11:21] foes thy footstool therefore let all the
[1:11:23] house of Israel know assuredly that God
[1:11:26] has made that same Jesus whom ye have
[1:11:30] crucified both Lord and Christ who set
[1:11:36] him up the David set him up now David
[1:11:38] didn't set him up God has set him up in
[1:11:40] that position was David king of Israel
[1:11:42] and at the time yes he was there was he
[1:11:45] king at that time yes he was king but
[1:11:48] that doesn't mean that he was higher
[1:11:51] than Christ just his lineage was not
[1:11:54] going to Christ or the the the flesh
[1:11:58] Jesus was not going to or the spiritual
[1:12:00] Christ Jesus was not going to come
[1:12:02] through the lineage of of David it was
[1:12:06] just through the the natural man through
[1:12:08] Mary which it still didn't it was God
[1:12:13] who created all of it he created the
[1:12:15] seed he created the egg so the only
[1:12:17] flesh part of it was the incubator that
[1:12:19] was it that was it a man
[1:12:26] but right hand what does right hand
[1:12:28] signify most people are right-handed
[1:12:32] I'll say man what is it with the right
[1:12:34] hand right hand is dominant right hand
[1:12:37] signifies authority and power because
[1:12:41] I'm right-handed that's where my power
[1:12:43] is of course years ago when I was
[1:12:45] younger I found out that I hit harder
[1:12:46] with my left it's got a weird on that
[1:12:51] where sometimes you know this but right
[1:12:53] hand signifies power and authority now
[1:12:57] so I'm 60 and verse four says thou has
[1:13:00] given a banner to them that fear thee
[1:13:03] that it may be displayed because of the
[1:13:06] truth Selah that thy beloved may be
[1:13:11] delivered that's us you know David means
[1:13:13] beloved but think of us put yourselves
[1:13:17] into the scripture that died beloved may
[1:13:20] be delivered safe with thy right hand
[1:13:23] and hear me now going to the military if
[1:13:27] if I was a general and David was a
[1:13:31] lieutenant the one with the higher rank
[1:13:34] walks on the right when we salute we
[1:13:39] salute with the right hand we don't
[1:13:41] salute with the left hand we salute with
[1:13:43] the right hand this is a type of just
[1:13:47] military now bear with me I'm just
[1:13:48] trying to illustrate if we do this in
[1:13:50] the natural or walks on the right not
[1:13:53] marching marching is something different
[1:13:55] but when you're walking in pairs or in a
[1:13:58] small group the person with the rank is
[1:14:01] on the right side always Authority is
[1:14:06] always always always on the right now
[1:14:10] let's talk about our flag our lag our
[1:14:12] banner our standard of the United States
[1:14:15] the US flag which it's it's a had an
[1:14:19] evolution of different designs of flags
[1:14:22] over the years you know to me I don't
[1:14:28] know what a flag I don't know how you
[1:14:30] view the US flag which I'm a veteran if
[1:14:32] for those of you that don't know not
[1:14:36] that I'm bragging on it by any means but
[1:14:37] the US flag means to me it represents
[1:14:42] the people to me it does
[1:14:45] represent the government so when you see
[1:14:47] these people burning flags I don't take
[1:14:49] a defense if it was just against the
[1:14:53] government fine I can understand your
[1:14:55] anger against the government but when
[1:14:56] you're burning the flag when you're
[1:14:57] desecrating the flag to me that's a shot
[1:14:59] against each and every one of you and
[1:15:01] every citizen in this country meant F
[1:15:04] flag represents each and every one of
[1:15:06] you every all those stars is one
[1:15:08] individual state so it's a union they
[1:15:12] call that blue area the Union its
[1:15:14] unified it's a unity of people it's a
[1:15:17] unity of the American citizen now I'm
[1:15:22] not trying to get political I try to
[1:15:24] keep that separate but I just want to
[1:15:26] see I just want to illustrate of what
[1:15:28] the flag represents it represents the
[1:15:31] individual states and the thirteen
[1:15:32] colonies and all that and the the red
[1:15:34] and white they have there and the blue
[1:15:36] they all have their significant meanings
[1:15:39] of why they put the color there but we
[1:15:43] all have life liberty and the pursuit of
[1:15:45] happiness is that right so it represents
[1:15:47] you your benefits its your Constitution
[1:15:54] those are your rights so the same thing
[1:15:58] with this ensign he represents us
[1:16:00] because he died for us it's not so much
[1:16:02] of a government but it represents you
[1:16:07] he's come to save those that are lost
[1:16:10] that was you is that right if you are
[1:16:13] represented in him hey man pamphlets the
[1:16:22] flag has to be displayed in a certain
[1:16:25] way or it's perceived disrespectful amen
[1:16:31] it's perceived as an act of disrespect
[1:16:34] if you're gonna fly the flag the Union
[1:16:38] would always be to my right to the
[1:16:41] audience's left it would be to my right
[1:16:43] that's where the authority would be so
[1:16:45] if it's hung horizontally the Union is
[1:16:47] on the right okay when it's flown in a
[1:16:51] group if there's a couple flags the
[1:16:54] other flag will be to my left and the US
[1:16:57] flag would be to my right
[1:17:00] it's showing the authority of the US as
[1:17:03] as the greatest nation is what we feel
[1:17:06] is the higher power if you fly it fly a
[1:17:12] flag if you display a flag a US flag
[1:17:16] upside down it's considered that is it's
[1:17:23] a sign of distress a sign of emergency
[1:17:25] and just because Trump is president and
[1:17:28] they don't like it that does not declare
[1:17:30] it a state of emergency these people are
[1:17:32] flying the flag upside down it might be
[1:17:34] urgency to them but it's not a national
[1:17:36] emergency so if you're ever in trouble
[1:17:38] and you need help and there's no one
[1:17:41] around you flag your flight or fly your
[1:17:42] flag upside down to show that you're in
[1:17:45] distress to person or property that's
[1:17:47] that's the reasoning behind flying the
[1:17:50] flag upside down half-mast is a display
[1:17:53] of respect and honor to those that have
[1:17:55] fallen whether it be a senator or
[1:17:58] congressman a fallen soldier or
[1:18:00] something important that of course they
[1:18:03] don't do it for every every US citizen
[1:18:05] is important whether you're an immigrant
[1:18:07] or whether you're a natural-born citizen
[1:18:08] it doesn't matter to me
[1:18:11] I accept the immigration I accept that
[1:18:15] because we're all Pilgrims and strangers
[1:18:17] in this land a man this world is not my
[1:18:19] home and uh you also you're not supposed
[1:18:28] to allow the flag to touch the ground
[1:18:30] because it's it's considered an act of
[1:18:32] desecration but are you supposed to
[1:18:35] throw the flag away no you're just
[1:18:37] supposed to keep it from touching the
[1:18:39] ground because the the people beforehand
[1:18:43] they considered that as a state of
[1:18:45] fallin that it would be a fallen nation
[1:18:48] because that that flag represents the
[1:18:50] nation not so much the government you
[1:18:52] might disagree with the government but
[1:18:54] that flag represents us as a nation a
[1:18:55] United people the United States of
[1:18:58] America is that right
[1:18:59] so also when you're flying a flag if
[1:19:05] it's multiple Flags oh my
[1:19:11] it's supposed to be equal with all the
[1:19:15] nations or higher it's never supposed to
[1:19:17] be below if you have multiple nation
[1:19:20] national flags flying
[1:19:21] it's either supposed to be equal or
[1:19:23] higher never below so you gotta see what
[1:19:28] I'm getting at here we exalt the Lord
[1:19:31] Jesus Christ we put him higher and he
[1:19:34] thought it not robbery to be equal with
[1:19:36] God amen
[1:19:37] and he made himself lower than the
[1:19:39] Angels but he was raised and lifted up
[1:19:41] highers all right well my butt Psalms 20
[1:19:47] and verse 5 I don't know what time ok
[1:19:49] you do have a clock back there what time
[1:19:51] did I come out bro I don't work
[1:19:56] but Psalms 20 and verse 5 it says we
[1:20:01] won't rejoice and thy salvation
[1:20:09] everybody everybody ok this morning we
[1:20:13] will rejoice in thy salvation and then
[1:20:15] the name of our God we will set up our
[1:20:17] banners we will raise our Flags in the
[1:20:20] name of our God is that right one nation
[1:20:23] we say the Pledge of Allegiance one
[1:20:25] nation under God indivisible with
[1:20:27] liberty and justice for all
[1:20:29] so we raise our flag in the name of God
[1:20:32] and that's what they don't like so much
[1:20:35] but but the Lord fulfill all thy
[1:20:38] petitions now know I that the Lord
[1:20:41] sayeth his anointed
[1:20:42] he will hear from him he will hear him
[1:20:45] from his holy heaven with the saving
[1:20:48] strength of his right hand some trust in
[1:20:52] chariots and some in horses but we will
[1:20:55] remember the name of the Lord our God
[1:20:57] they are brought down and fallen but we
[1:21:00] are risen and stand upright save Lord
[1:21:04] let the King hear us when we call no I
[1:21:07] mean I'm proud to be an American and
[1:21:08] I'll do whatever I can to protect that I
[1:21:10] will do whatever I can to preserve the
[1:21:12] rights of this country and that's why I
[1:21:14] served it was a sense of duty it wasn't
[1:21:16] because I wanted to go war and be some
[1:21:18] kind of a hero it was a sense of duty
[1:21:20] that I felt within me that I wanted to
[1:21:22] preserve the rights of every single
[1:21:24] American citizen I'm one guy what can
[1:21:26] one guy do nothing but strengthen
[1:21:28] numbers if I could add to it if I could
[1:21:30] put my shoulder to the wheel to help
[1:21:32] save this country now I don't agree with
[1:21:34] all the wars I don't agree with that I
[1:21:36] don't agree with how our countries
[1:21:38] handle things I'm not saying that I
[1:21:40] agree with everything that they did when
[1:21:43] I say that I'm American but we're
[1:21:44] rossette were represented American just
[1:21:47] like the Prophet said we were
[1:21:49] represented and when George Washington
[1:21:50] was there through all those battles
[1:21:52] Abraham Lincoln we had that
[1:21:53] representation as of the nation through
[1:21:56] all of her bumps bruises and her glory
[1:21:58] amen so I accept that because I still
[1:22:03] stand proud to be an American even
[1:22:05] though sometimes I'm I would be
[1:22:06] embarrassed because of some of the
[1:22:09] things that politicians have done but
[1:22:11] that doesn't take the pride away for
[1:22:16] being a natural-born citizen here where
[1:22:19] we have freedoms many more freedoms than
[1:22:22] what other countries have is that right
[1:22:24] do you even recognize the freedoms that
[1:22:26] you have did we brought that out do you
[1:22:30] does anybody know the first five
[1:22:32] amendments what's the first amendment Oh
[1:22:41] freedom of speech freedom of the press
[1:22:45] [Laughter]
[1:22:46] I'm just going to going to do this but I
[1:22:50] remembered I had this
[1:22:51] there's a brother at camp he went
[1:22:54] through it it was real neat the way he
[1:22:56] did it so I hope I can do him justice
[1:22:59] now forgive me when I say pride I don't
[1:23:02] mean though hearty haughty pride I
[1:23:04] believe you said I have pride in the
[1:23:05] work that you do but pride is an
[1:23:09] arrogancy being far from us to have it
[1:23:11] but the first First Amendment is
[1:23:14] Congress shall make no law respecting an
[1:23:16] establishment of religion or prohibiting
[1:23:17] the free exercise thereof or abridging
[1:23:20] the freedom of speech or of the press or
[1:23:23] the right of the people to peaceably
[1:23:25] assemble and to petition the government
[1:23:30] for a redress of grievances now you have
[1:23:35] the right to peacefully assemble which
[1:23:36] which we're here doing
[1:23:38] right we are here assembled together in
[1:23:40] a peaceful manner of course we want to
[1:23:43] stay here and beat the snot out of
[1:23:46] demons too so so you have the right to
[1:23:52] say to give your opinion each one of us
[1:23:55] here has a right to their own opinion
[1:23:56] and they have the right to give their
[1:23:59] own opinion now does that mean yes you
[1:24:01] could say anything you want and
[1:24:03] everything is fine and dandy no because
[1:24:05] everything that you say there is a
[1:24:07] consequence to it so use it that freedom
[1:24:12] wisely you have the right to say I am a
[1:24:16] Christian in this day you have the right
[1:24:18] to say Satan get thee behind me you have
[1:24:21] the right to say those things you can't
[1:24:23] don't let don't let Satan try to take
[1:24:25] your speech away from you - to quote
[1:24:28] scripture or to encourage somebody else
[1:24:30] don't you take don't you let him take
[1:24:32] that right away now does anybody know
[1:24:34] what the Second Amendment is right to
[1:24:38] bear arms thank you yes this is audience
[1:24:40] participation I'm not nervous anymore
[1:24:45] you nervous now did I make it second
[1:24:53] amendment it's not just bearing the arms
[1:24:55] but a well-regulated militia being
[1:24:59] necessary to the security of a free
[1:25:02] State the right of the people to keep
[1:25:06] and bear arms and not be infringed you
[1:25:09] have the right to rally the troops
[1:25:11] together you have the right to rally
[1:25:13] brothers and sisters together to pray
[1:25:15] and write the bear arms you have the
[1:25:17] right to take the sword of faith and
[1:25:19] strike down every demon in your life is
[1:25:21] that right amen
[1:25:23] third amendment not very many people
[1:25:25] know this one but does anybody know it
[1:25:28] no no soldier shall in time of peace be
[1:25:34] quartered in any house so in the time of
[1:25:38] war if the soldiers come and say we're
[1:25:39] kicking you out of your house because
[1:25:41] that's what they used to do when the
[1:25:42] English were here there's a British they
[1:25:45] kick the people out of their own homes
[1:25:46] took their food and did whatever they
[1:25:48] want but this
[1:25:51] was established because of that no
[1:25:55] soldier shall in the time of peace be
[1:25:56] quartered in any house without the
[1:25:58] consent of the owner nor in time of war
[1:26:02] but in a manner to be prescribed by law
[1:26:06] so you have the right to kick out a
[1:26:08] demon that wants to try to come in in a
[1:26:10] house in your own he has no right to be
[1:26:13] there no matter what he tries to say to
[1:26:15] you I belong here he does it you have
[1:26:19] the right to kick him out when you get
[1:26:20] right with God now if you have sin in
[1:26:22] your life that that that demon has every
[1:26:25] right to be there but when you get right
[1:26:27] with God when you're living right with
[1:26:29] God you had the right to kick him out of
[1:26:30] your home
[1:26:32] now Fourth Amendment the right of the
[1:26:38] people to be secure in their persons
[1:26:40] houses papers and effects against
[1:26:43] unreasonable searches and seizures shall
[1:26:45] not be violated and no warrants shall
[1:26:48] issue but upon probable cause supported
[1:26:51] by oath or affirmation and particularly
[1:26:55] describing the place to be describing
[1:26:58] the place to be searched and the persons
[1:27:00] or things to be seized so they have no
[1:27:03] right to come into your home and to
[1:27:05] unless they have a warrant to come in
[1:27:07] there those demons don't have a right to
[1:27:09] be there what does that scripture when
[1:27:12] when the man cleans his home and the in
[1:27:15] the the demon leaves if you don't
[1:27:18] fulfill that void with the Word of God
[1:27:21] that demon is able to come in there with
[1:27:24] seven other worse than him so you'll be
[1:27:27] worse off a man so you don't have to
[1:27:30] allow those things to come in there now
[1:27:32] the fifth amendment anybody know a fifth
[1:27:36] amendment is everybody's heard I plead
[1:27:39] the fifth
[1:27:40] right no person shall be held to answer
[1:27:45] for a capital or otherwise infamous
[1:27:47] crime unless on a presentment or
[1:27:51] indictment of a grand jury except in
[1:27:54] cases arising in the land or naval
[1:27:58] forces or in the militia when an actual
[1:28:01] service and time of war or public danger
[1:28:03] nor shall any person be
[1:28:05] subject for the same offense to be twice
[1:28:07] put in jeopardy oh that one's important
[1:28:10] so you have the right to not suffer
[1:28:13] double jeopardy nor shall any person be
[1:28:19] subject for the same offence to be twice
[1:28:22] put in jeopardy of life or limb nor
[1:28:24] shall be compelled in any criminal case
[1:28:26] to be a witness against himself we have
[1:28:29] one accuser of the Brethren and he
[1:28:31] brought his case forth the viewer a
[1:28:33] sinner and he brought the case forth to
[1:28:35] God yep you were a sinner okay you were
[1:28:37] guilty as charged
[1:28:38] well once you repent you cannot be
[1:28:39] charged again for that same one you
[1:28:41] cannot be prosecuted for double jeopardy
[1:28:44] amen nor be deprived of life liberty or
[1:28:50] property without due process of law so
[1:28:52] there has to be a court trial nor shall
[1:28:55] private property be taken for public use
[1:28:57] without just compensation so the
[1:29:00] government can't come in and just
[1:29:02] declare eminent domain and kick you out
[1:29:04] of your house but there has to be just
[1:29:06] compensation before they could take that
[1:29:07] amen so there's a little bit of lesson
[1:29:10] on the on the first five amendments I
[1:29:13] forgot about three when you know I
[1:29:15] thought I knew the other ones three and
[1:29:17] four I kind of forgot about it but that
[1:29:18] got me thinking if I don't know my
[1:29:20] constitutional rights
[1:29:21] do I know my biblical rights you know if
[1:29:25] I'm not studying if I don't know my
[1:29:26] natural rights do I know my spiritual
[1:29:28] rights something to think about so it
[1:29:32] behooves us not only as American
[1:29:34] citizens to know what your rights are
[1:29:36] but it also behooves us to read into
[1:29:38] Scripture to know what our spiritual
[1:29:40] rights are Jeremiah 51 and 27 now this
[1:29:50] is only illustrating of how reson
[1:29:53] raising a standard declares a state of
[1:29:56] war Jeremiah 51 and 27 it says set you
[1:30:03] up a standard in the land though he's
[1:30:08] saying raise the flag set up set ye up a
[1:30:12] standard in the land blow the trumpet
[1:30:14] among the nations prepare the nations
[1:30:16] against her call together against her
[1:30:18] the king
[1:30:19] of ararat many and that's not Alcatraz I
[1:30:24] know that but Ashkenaz appoint a captain
[1:30:28] against her cause the horses to come up
[1:30:31] as the rough caterpillars now he's
[1:30:33] saying set you up a standard in the land
[1:30:35] blow the trumpet among the nations and
[1:30:37] prepare the nations against her so this
[1:30:41] is a declaration of war so raising the
[1:30:45] standard not not so much as what we're
[1:30:47] doing we fly the flag of buildings you
[1:30:48] might fly the flag at your house that's
[1:30:50] not a declaration of war but when you go
[1:30:52] to another country and you say we're
[1:30:55] here that's a declaration of war and
[1:30:57] you're there to fight revelation 17 and
[1:31:03] verse 12 I'll try to wind this down
[1:31:06] because I'm I don't even know if I'm
[1:31:08] halfway is anybody tired if you're tired
[1:31:12] you're more than welcome to stand up
[1:31:13] you're not going to offend me by any
[1:31:14] means revelation 17 and verse 12 this is
[1:31:22] this is just another illustration here
[1:31:24] and the ten horns which thou sawest are
[1:31:27] ten Kings which have received no Kingdom
[1:31:30] as yet but receive power as kings one
[1:31:34] hour with the Beast these have one mind
[1:31:37] and shall give their power and strength
[1:31:40] unto the Beast see they're rallying
[1:31:43] their troops together they're trying to
[1:31:45] combine their power amen we just read
[1:31:47] that so they have one mind and shall
[1:31:49] give their power and strength unto the
[1:31:51] Beast so they're combining forces these
[1:31:54] shall make war with the lamb and the
[1:31:56] lamb shall overcome them for he is Lord
[1:31:59] of lords and King of Kings and they that
[1:32:01] are with him are called and chosen and
[1:32:04] faithful are you called are you chosen
[1:32:07] no are you faithful now you are able to
[1:32:10] overcome is that right because he's the
[1:32:12] Lord of lords and the king of kings and
[1:32:14] he's already overcome but just to show
[1:32:19] that they have declared war on the lamb
[1:32:22] they've declared war and if you're in
[1:32:24] him they've declared war on you now are
[1:32:29] you going to take that easily
[1:32:32] just want to read this quote here you
[1:32:35] might thinking that it doesn't pertain
[1:32:36] anything but just bear with me he says
[1:32:39] let us go back to the beginning in the
[1:32:41] original physical creation as we know it
[1:32:44] today God made everything in pairs male
[1:32:47] and female there were two chickens
[1:32:50] rooster and hen there were two cattle
[1:32:53] the cow in the bull and right down the
[1:32:56] line but when it came to man there was
[1:32:58] only one they were not a pair Adam Adam
[1:33:02] had been made in an image of God he was
[1:33:05] a son of God as a son of God he could
[1:33:07] not be tempted and fall that would be
[1:33:10] impossible so God took a byproduct of
[1:33:13] man to caused the fall woman never
[1:33:15] stepped fresh from the hand of God as a
[1:33:18] true product of God
[1:33:19] she was produced from man and when God
[1:33:22] caused her to be brought forth from man
[1:33:25] she was vastly different from the other
[1:33:28] females he had created now bear with me
[1:33:31] sisters when I read this okay it's going
[1:33:33] to come out good in the end trust me she
[1:33:36] was able to be seduced no other female
[1:33:39] in creation can be immoral but the human
[1:33:43] female may be touched at almost any time
[1:33:46] and that weakness in her allowed Satan
[1:33:48] to seduce her by way of the serpent and
[1:33:51] has brought the woman to very peculiar
[1:33:54] to a very peculiar position before God
[1:33:57] and his word she is the type of all
[1:34:00] things vulgar foul and loathsome on the
[1:34:03] one hand and on the other hand she is
[1:34:07] the type of all things clean and
[1:34:09] beautiful and holy as the receptacle of
[1:34:12] the Spirit amen and blessings of God see
[1:34:17] the position you women hold oh my so
[1:34:20] long as you use it in her pure form
[1:34:23] amen oh my and on the
[1:34:33] and she is called the who is drunk
[1:34:35] with the wine of her fornication on the
[1:34:38] other hand she is called the bride of
[1:34:40] Christ on one hand she is called Mystery
[1:34:44] Babylon the abomination before God and
[1:34:47] on the other hand she is called New
[1:34:49] Jerusalem our mother on the one hand she
[1:34:52] is so foul and wicked and lewd that she
[1:34:56] is summarily cast into the lake of fire
[1:34:58] as the only fit place for her and on the
[1:35:03] other hand she is exalted to heaven
[1:35:06] sharing the very throne of God as the
[1:35:10] only place befitting such a queen oh my
[1:35:16] the one might call you dirty and filthy
[1:35:20] but that's the accuser of the Brethren
[1:35:22] before you repented and we're forgiven
[1:35:25] of your sins because God throws it in
[1:35:27] the sea of forgetfulness right we don't
[1:35:28] suffer and suffer double jeopardy you
[1:35:31] were forgiven of a once he cannot bring
[1:35:33] it again no matter how much he goes to
[1:35:35] and fro for on this earth he cannot
[1:35:38] bring that accusation up again for you
[1:35:40] are forgiven you were justified amen
[1:35:43] justified just if I'd never done it
[1:35:46] before
[1:35:47] Amen and in this diet errant Church age
[1:35:52] she is a dominating female she is
[1:35:54] Mystery Babylon she is the great
[1:35:57] she is Jezebel the false prophet is see
[1:36:00] how the other side looks that's how God
[1:36:03] use them you don't want to be viewed
[1:36:05] like that to God do you it would make
[1:36:09] you feel so pitiful so shameful to know
[1:36:11] that somebody's viewing you as a as a
[1:36:13] horror or an unclean woman amen she's
[1:36:18] Jezebel the false prophet is why because
[1:36:21] the truth female is submissive to God
[1:36:23] Christ is her head she has no word but
[1:36:27] his no thoughts but his no leadership
[1:36:30] but his he is our standard he is the one
[1:36:33] who was guiding us amen but what about
[1:36:36] this church she has cast out the word
[1:36:38] destroyed the Bibles and worthy assays
[1:36:40] of the godly she has slain those who had
[1:36:43] preached the truth she has taken over
[1:36:46] Kings
[1:36:46] princes and Nations controls armies and
[1:36:49] insists that she is the true party of
[1:36:52] Christ and that her popes are the vicars
[1:36:54] of Christ were in the place of that's
[1:36:56] what vicars means in the place of Christ
[1:36:59] she is utterly seduced by the devil
[1:37:01] until she in turn has become the seducer
[1:37:04] of others she is the bride of Satan and
[1:37:08] has produced his bastard child religions
[1:37:12] but listen up here all through the Dark
[1:37:16] Ages
[1:37:17] she is dominated for over 900 years she
[1:37:21] has plundered and destroyed she killed
[1:37:24] the arts destroyed the sciences produced
[1:37:27] nothing but death until the light of the
[1:37:29] truth was almost entirely gone pay
[1:37:32] attention to that let me say it again
[1:37:34] produced nothing but death until the
[1:37:37] light of the truth was almost entirely
[1:37:39] gone and only bares the sliver of light
[1:37:44] remained the oil and wine had almost
[1:37:48] almost ceased could to see the very
[1:37:52] elect
[1:37:52] if possible so the oil and wine had
[1:37:56] almost ceased to flow but though she
[1:37:59] dominated the world kingdoms and
[1:38:01] demanded that all men find their
[1:38:03] citizenship in her on the name of
[1:38:06] religion I hear that so many times then
[1:38:08] this was the Crusades is what they're
[1:38:10] talking about as a Roman Church if you
[1:38:12] weren't a member of the Roman Church if
[1:38:13] you didn't accept that they were going
[1:38:14] to kill you because you were an infidel
[1:38:16] whether you've proved you were a
[1:38:18] Protestant or not you profess Jesus
[1:38:19] Christ they didn't care on that if you
[1:38:22] were not a member of the Catholic Church
[1:38:23] you were gonna be slain and your family
[1:38:25] along with you so that's what he's
[1:38:28] talking about here and it was so dark in
[1:38:30] those times like he said there was a
[1:38:31] hardly a glimmer of light there was just
[1:38:33] a sliver of light in that day which the
[1:38:35] light of the light of the world is the
[1:38:37] gospel is that right the light of the
[1:38:39] world is Jesus Christ there is a little
[1:38:44] but there she dominated dominated the
[1:38:47] world kingdoms and demanded that all men
[1:38:49] find their citizenship in her there was
[1:38:52] a little group who belonged to God and
[1:38:55] their citizenship was in heaven this
[1:39:00] world
[1:39:01] I'm only passing through Imagi could not
[1:39:06] and then she could not destroy God kept
[1:39:10] his little flock God kept his little
[1:39:13] flock if he kept them there he'll keep
[1:39:15] you in this day is that right they could
[1:39:17] not be destroyed no matter how dark it
[1:39:20] gets in your life no matter how dark it
[1:39:22] might not seem that there's any light
[1:39:23] there hold on a little bit longer hold
[1:39:26] on a little bit longer this church of
[1:39:29] role was as heathen and wicked as Queen
[1:39:31] Athaliah
[1:39:32] who tried to destroy all the royal seed
[1:39:34] and almost succeeded all most succeeded
[1:39:39] but God preserved one and of him there
[1:39:44] came more of the faithful
[1:39:46] so God preserved a little flock in that
[1:39:48] long dark night and the truth there
[1:39:51] finally arose hey Luther oh my now what
[1:39:58] I'm going to get here when you're
[1:39:58] marching you see a group you see
[1:40:00] somebody marching along the line they
[1:40:02] what they have is the flag at the
[1:40:03] forefront it's a little standard it's
[1:40:05] called a guide on now that in the time
[1:40:08] of war they carried at the front oh my
[1:40:12] is there room here they carried at the
[1:40:15] forefront so what happens is is all the
[1:40:18] troops that are in the back they could
[1:40:20] see they had their eyes on that standard
[1:40:22] because he's leading wherever they're
[1:40:23] going in the battle because on what's
[1:40:26] that scripture I can't every battles
[1:40:28] with confused noise but this should be
[1:40:30] with blood oh my so you have this one
[1:40:36] with the guide on showing the way
[1:40:37] through the battle cutting through now
[1:40:39] if that flag fell if that flag fell so
[1:40:43] where's whatever the carcass is there
[1:40:45] the Eagles would be gathered if one is
[1:40:46] fallen the the one behind them would
[1:40:49] pick up that flag and continue it on
[1:40:51] ahead
[1:40:52] right so they could keep showing where
[1:40:54] the battle is they could keep showing
[1:40:56] the one way man now that's your
[1:41:03] responsibility if somebody's there for
[1:41:05] and you've got to pick up the standard
[1:41:07] you've got to raise the standard this
[1:41:09] the battle they declared war we're
[1:41:11] fighting for life is that right hey man
[1:41:14] please da oh man when I get who that was
[1:41:21] going to be old another message but if
[1:41:23] it's just so good right it's something
[1:41:25] so even though they tried to destroy the
[1:41:29] whole life they just they tried to
[1:41:30] destroy those of garlic and not do it
[1:41:35] hey that land could be you when
[1:41:38] everybody's trying to put it down you
[1:41:39] could be that voice you had the right to
[1:41:42] remain silent but you don't have to
[1:41:44] remain silent is that right you have a
[1:41:46] say just like anybody else they're
[1:41:48] trying to pull your rights down that's
[1:41:50] what they're trying to do they have
[1:41:51] declared war that group called antiva
[1:41:53] they have declared war on conservatives
[1:41:56] I don't know if you know that they've
[1:41:58] got weapons I just saw the thing the
[1:42:00] other night this this police officer was
[1:42:02] saying that these this group has gotten
[1:42:04] more bold they've gotten more weapons
[1:42:07] and the more organized the hold they've
[1:42:10] gotten more weapons and they're more
[1:42:12] organized than they ever were before and
[1:42:14] they're having a hard time fighting
[1:42:16] against it they're trying to tear the
[1:42:18] freedoms down they're trying to take
[1:42:19] your rights away now to me I see this is
[1:42:21] in this in as an Austrian of what the
[1:42:24] Prophet said that we won't be able to
[1:42:26] assemble peacefully here anymore
[1:42:27] I see the Austrian coming in do you say
[1:42:30] it Saints they've declared war on your
[1:42:32] peace they declare war on what you stand
[1:42:36] for and you stand for Christ is that
[1:42:37] right
[1:42:38] they have declared war this is the time
[1:42:40] where they're trying to change the
[1:42:41] freedoms they're trying to get rid of
[1:42:43] the Second Amendment they want to keep
[1:42:45] the First Amendment to themselves and
[1:42:46] only they have the free speech because
[1:42:48] when you give your opinion they try to
[1:42:50] shut you down
[1:42:50] that's it hypocrisy if I've ever seen it
[1:42:54] they fight and cry say we have free
[1:42:57] speech freedom of the press will stop
[1:42:59] lying and stop your cheating and let
[1:43:01] somebody else have a say so everybody's
[1:43:04] got an opinion everybody's an American
[1:43:06] citizen is that right we all have to
[1:43:08] share the same right so being far from
[1:43:10] us when we shut anybody else down that's
[1:43:12] hypocrisy who I don't think I've ever
[1:43:19] sweated like this
[1:43:20] [Laughter]
[1:43:25] but like I said they've more organized
[1:43:28] more or more armed than before
[1:43:30] they're anti-trump there are
[1:43:32] anti-christian they're anti white male
[1:43:34] and they are anti sound mind
[1:43:37] it's crazy what they're doing now it's
[1:43:39] crazy and did not brother brain say that
[1:43:42] that was going to happen Who am I
[1:43:44] they're going to be so far out of their
[1:43:46] mind and I could see that they're anti
[1:43:51] sound mind they've got to be I'll try to
[1:43:56] stop yelling at you talk to you like a
[1:43:59] civilized human being
[1:44:02] let me muster up my dignity again I want
[1:44:11] to get real with you this is what you're
[1:44:13] facing in this day that's why it's so
[1:44:16] important that we stay true we get our
[1:44:18] our minds and our thoughts established
[1:44:20] in the Word of God know what the Word of
[1:44:22] God says know your rights when you buy a
[1:44:24] piece of property I can't even take a
[1:44:25] drinker in when you buy a piece of
[1:44:27] property you go on you see what you pull
[1:44:29] at the house and you know say how big my
[1:44:31] place is see how we can run around and
[1:44:33] do whatever at least see what the rights
[1:44:35] you have see what promises you have
[1:44:37] because what your struggle without
[1:44:43] another standard say molta this is what
[1:44:48] you get when there's multiple meetings
[1:44:52] yeah we have a standard it's also a set
[1:44:56] of rules of things that should be the
[1:45:00] same you have standard sockets you have
[1:45:02] metric sockets measurements of weight
[1:45:05] and different things like when you get a
[1:45:08] kit it all comes standard there's a
[1:45:11] certain standard that's met a certain
[1:45:13] criteria that's met to be in the same
[1:45:17] package so when somebody orders it they
[1:45:19] get the same thing it's a repetitive
[1:45:21] thing it's it's maintaining the same
[1:45:23] criteria I guess that's probably the
[1:45:25] easiest way that I could explain it a
[1:45:28] government has standards they have
[1:45:30] regulations on on the EPA they have
[1:45:32] standards that these companies have to
[1:45:35] work by you know they have to fall
[1:45:37] within certain parameters or standards
[1:45:41] but the one I want to get to is is
[1:45:44] customs customs that we live what kind
[1:45:47] of life we live what you're used to
[1:45:49] doing are your standards high enough
[1:45:51] amen
[1:45:53] so if you see yourself when you see
[1:45:55] yourself not living right or or you see
[1:45:59] yourself forward a little bit raise your
[1:46:01] standard a little bit you got to be a
[1:46:03] little bit more discipline is that right
[1:46:05] first Corinthians 13:11 says when I was
[1:46:08] a child I spake as a child I understood
[1:46:10] as a child I thought as a child but when
[1:46:13] I became a man I put away childish
[1:46:16] things a man having the same line that
[1:46:20] in order to receive the kingdom of
[1:46:22] heaven we have to receive it as children
[1:46:24] and in the mouths of babes oh my
[1:46:27] goodness my little three-year-old he
[1:46:29] says he says some good things man it
[1:46:32] hope get in the same he really believes
[1:46:35] God you know and just the things that a
[1:46:37] three-year-old says it kind of makes me
[1:46:40] almost embarrassed man if he's got faith
[1:46:42] that God's gonna do it where's my faith
[1:46:44] you know and I understand a lot more
[1:46:46] than what he does but he says this is
[1:46:49] going to be this is the way it should be
[1:46:50] that's that's the way I believe God's
[1:46:52] gonna do it you know and that's his mind
[1:46:54] frame and I appreciate that so we've got
[1:46:58] to be able to receive things as a child
[1:47:00] a childlike faith but don't act like a
[1:47:02] child
[1:47:04] what's the scripture be children and
[1:47:06] maliciousness you know be children are
[1:47:08] wrongdoing as far as don't do it on
[1:47:10] purpose
[1:47:11] you know but since we became a man act
[1:47:14] like a man you know put away the
[1:47:16] childish things we're not children
[1:47:17] anymore
[1:47:21] but like I said they've and the these
[1:47:25] people have declared war on us
[1:47:30] so sometimes we don't know how to answer
[1:47:32] these people they ask a question and
[1:47:37] sometimes to our shame we don't know the
[1:47:39] answer that's why I say we got to get
[1:47:41] into the word we got to know what the
[1:47:42] word says because we with a good
[1:47:43] conscience we ought to be able to answer
[1:47:45] every man that asks us
[1:47:47] of why of the hope that we have is that
[1:47:50] right I can't remember the word verbatim
[1:47:52] but it's not it's not that we're
[1:47:56] fighting them and wrestling them down to
[1:47:58] the ground and you know learning jujitsu
[1:47:59] and all this other stuff and and holding
[1:48:01] them down well you got it you got to do
[1:48:03] what I say it's not in that kind of a
[1:48:05] thing because I just told a fellow that
[1:48:08] that's the other day that if a man is
[1:48:10] thirsty you give him something to drink
[1:48:12] give him a glass of water don't put a
[1:48:13] fire hose in his mouth you know why is
[1:48:16] this serpents harmless as doves all
[1:48:18] right so we ought to know what the word
[1:48:20] says and give it in love you know it's
[1:48:23] not beating somebody down with the word
[1:48:25] of God
[1:48:28] second Corinthians ten and three says
[1:48:30] for though we walk in the flesh we do
[1:48:33] not war after the flesh for the weapons
[1:48:36] of our warfare are not carnal but mighty
[1:48:39] through God to the pulling down of
[1:48:41] strongholds casting down imaginations
[1:48:43] and every high thing that exalteth
[1:48:47] itself against the knowledge of God and
[1:48:49] bringing into captivity every thought to
[1:48:52] the obedience of Christ now how do you
[1:48:55] do that and having in a readiness to
[1:48:57] revenge how many has a spirit of revenge
[1:49:01] in there and there you know how many
[1:49:04] entertains that spirit of revenge I used
[1:49:06] to be a very vengeful person my wife
[1:49:08] would say if you did something to me I
[1:49:10] was going to get you twice as bad I was
[1:49:13] going to get you back with interest but
[1:49:16] I think God the revenge I want to have
[1:49:18] is what it says here and having any
[1:49:20] readiness to revenge all disobedience
[1:49:22] when your obedience is fulfilled now 1st
[1:49:28] Peter 2 and 15 it answers it kind of in
[1:49:30] the same way just in a different light
[1:49:32] that for so is the will of God that with
[1:49:36] well doing you may put the silence in
[1:49:39] the ignorance of foolish men now I think
[1:49:42] I've said are here but preach the gospel
[1:49:43] use words as if necessary you know
[1:49:46] people are watching so sometimes they're
[1:49:49] watching the actions making sure your
[1:49:51] actions line up with the words that you
[1:49:53] said so for so is the will of God how
[1:49:57] many's looking for the will of God your
[1:50:00] answer right here
[1:50:01] that with well-doing you may put the
[1:50:03] silence the ignorance of foolish man
[1:50:05] knows I would come against you just like
[1:50:08] we read in the beginning and Psalms that
[1:50:10] the wicked you're coming to oppress them
[1:50:11] this is your way out this is your way of
[1:50:13] escape by your obedience and by your
[1:50:16] well doing you could shut them up
[1:50:19] because it will have no accusation
[1:50:21] against you as free and not using your
[1:50:24] liberty for a cloak of maliciousness but
[1:50:26] as the servants of God honor all men
[1:50:30] just the ones in church oh man the ones
[1:50:36] you work with the ones that you really
[1:50:37] care not to be around it's kind of hard
[1:50:40] it's it's easy to be ridiculed for your
[1:50:43] wrongdoing and and persecuted for your
[1:50:45] wrongdoing but it's hard for when you do
[1:50:47] right and you get persecutors that right
[1:50:49] that's scriptural isn't hello as free
[1:50:52] now using your excuse me honor all men
[1:50:54] love the Brotherhood fear God and honor
[1:50:57] the king praise alone oh you've heard me
[1:51:03] rambling for a while yeah I'm gonna try
[1:51:09] and wind this down
[1:51:18] anybody been blessed this morning no
[1:51:21] glory not by me is by his words I pray
[1:51:28] for his leading because my struggle is I
[1:51:31] can get all kinds of stuff down and this
[1:51:33] could have been something real
[1:51:34] exhaustive but uh there's a time where
[1:51:37] it's got to be shut off brother Jesse
[1:51:38] knows there's a time you got it well
[1:51:40] they're just going to have to go view it
[1:51:41] for themselves if they want more they're
[1:51:43] gonna have to go back and read it you
[1:51:44] know and that's that's something that I
[1:51:46] I strongly recommend you know go back
[1:51:48] and read it some things I might have cut
[1:51:50] short go back and read these scriptures
[1:51:51] because you get more when you read the
[1:51:53] read more of the text you get more out
[1:51:55] of it because we're only getting small
[1:51:58] sections out of these things
[1:51:59] and I think each one of these scriptures
[1:52:02] are an encouragement to know that God is
[1:52:04] faithful and he is there in your time of
[1:52:06] need and even in this time of war and
[1:52:09] he's there fighting the battle for you
[1:52:11] you just be obedient to him is that
[1:52:12] right
[1:52:15] sorry if I bored you at all but I can't
[1:52:18] help but these scriptures they might not
[1:52:21] refer exactly to rapture but when I read
[1:52:26] it I can't help but think of the rapture
[1:52:28] does that make sense so when I read that
[1:52:31] don't don't think that I'm trying to
[1:52:33] portray it that this is rapture
[1:52:34] Scripture this is just what I think of
[1:52:36] when I read these it is that is that
[1:52:38] okay there's my disclaimer so now I'm
[1:52:40] not at fault no I'm kidding but Isaiah
[1:52:44] 62 oh my yeah this is the first
[1:52:51] definition of standard how he made a way
[1:52:54] of escape and made a way for us to flee
[1:52:56] I can't help but think of the rapture
[1:52:58] that that's how he's getting us to
[1:53:00] escape this old world hey meant oh my
[1:53:05] Isaiah 62 and verse 8 it said the Lord
[1:53:10] has sworn by his right hand and by the
[1:53:12] arm of his strength surely I will no
[1:53:15] more give my corn to to be meat for
[1:53:18] thine enemies and the sons of the
[1:53:20] stranger shall not drink no wine for the
[1:53:23] which thou has labored now you got to
[1:53:26] understand I kind of go back that Israel
[1:53:28] was punished for a time and he let
[1:53:32] Israel's enemies pretty much have the
[1:53:36] reign over them and so he's saying
[1:53:38] enough is enough you've paid your dues
[1:53:41] no more so that that's kind of what he's
[1:53:44] saying here they're not going to take
[1:53:46] your corn anymore they're not going to
[1:53:47] take your Warren they're there your wine
[1:53:49] they're gonna have to provide their own
[1:53:50] anymore because this is wartime yeah
[1:53:55] but they that have gathered it shall eat
[1:53:57] it and praise the Lord and they that
[1:54:00] have brought it together shall drink it
[1:54:02] in the courts of my holiness go through
[1:54:04] go through the gates prepare ye the way
[1:54:07] of the people cast up cast up the
[1:54:10] highway gather out the stones lift up a
[1:54:14] standard for the people behold the LORD
[1:54:16] hath proclaimed unto the end of the
[1:54:18] world say he to the daughter of Zion
[1:54:20] behold thy salvation cometh behold his
[1:54:23] reward is with him and his work before
[1:54:25] him and they that shall call him
[1:54:28] and they shall call them the holy people
[1:54:31] the redeemed of the Lord and thou shalt
[1:54:33] be called sought out a city not forsaken
[1:54:37] now I can't help it at first Peter 2:9
[1:54:40] and 10 somewhere around there it says
[1:54:42] that you were a holy nation a royal
[1:54:44] priesthood oh my the holy people that's
[1:54:49] one of my favorite scriptures Isaiah 11
[1:54:55] and 10 it says and in that day there
[1:54:57] shall be a root of Jesse who is that
[1:54:59] root of Jesse we read it a little bit
[1:55:01] earlier that David wasn't the one to
[1:55:02] send it up into heaven but it was Christ
[1:55:04] that was the Senate under heaven and
[1:55:06] David was a root so you see where I'm
[1:55:08] going so you know what the root of Jesse
[1:55:10] is that's Christ so and in that day
[1:55:13] there should be a root of Jesse which
[1:55:15] shall stand for an ensign of the people
[1:55:17] we read it as a brass serpent was lift
[1:55:18] up social Jesus Christ be lifted up for
[1:55:21] the to save the people of the world for
[1:55:24] those that would believe on him to it
[1:55:26] show the Gentiles seek 10 tiles were
[1:55:30] considered the heathens those that
[1:55:31] didn't believe in the Jewish way you're
[1:55:34] considered Gentiles or Greeks or
[1:55:38] whatever it's it's a nation other than
[1:55:40] Jewish so the Gentiles you know to it
[1:55:47] shall the Gentiles seek and his rest
[1:55:50] shall be glorious Jesus Christ is our
[1:55:55] rest he is our Sabbath David do you seek
[1:55:58] him to him or to inch of the Gentiles
[1:56:01] seek we are seeking him is that right
[1:56:03] our eyes are upon him our eyes are upon
[1:56:06] our standard the captain of the army
[1:56:08] amen and it shall come to pass in that
[1:56:13] day that the Lord shall set his hand
[1:56:15] again the second time to what to recover
[1:56:21] the remnant of his people I know that's
[1:56:25] probably talking about the 144,000 and
[1:56:27] you know the people of Israel but I
[1:56:29] can't help but think of it as me as the
[1:56:31] as the rapture comes the calling away
[1:56:34] he's coming a second coming he's coming
[1:56:36] to take me away hey man woo
[1:56:42] which shall be left from Assyria and
[1:56:44] this is the natural stuff left from
[1:56:45] Assyria from Egypt and for path roast
[1:56:47] and from cush and from Elam
[1:56:49] I'm from Shinar from Hema Hamas and from
[1:56:53] the islands of the sea and he shall set
[1:56:55] up an ensign for the nations and shall
[1:56:57] assemble the outcasts of Israel that's
[1:56:59] us the Gentiles that's the way I see it
[1:57:02] anyways because I'm putting myself into
[1:57:04] the scripture and gathered together this
[1:57:07] the dispersed of Judah from the four
[1:57:09] corners of the earth
[1:57:10] now we could I'm not going to write now
[1:57:14] but you can get into the teaching of the
[1:57:15] the outcasts of Israel and those that
[1:57:18] are dispersed of Judah you know that's
[1:57:20] that's all part of the Israel coming
[1:57:22] together at a later time I'm not a
[1:57:25] teacher I'll leave that up to brother
[1:57:26] Jesse thanks brother bro now Luke 17 and
[1:57:39] 26 you could see it as this day for sure
[1:57:44] it says and as it wasn't as it was in
[1:57:47] the days of Noah so shall it be also in
[1:57:51] the days of the Son of Man they did eat
[1:57:53] they drank they married wives they were
[1:57:56] given in marriage until the day of Noah
[1:57:58] entered into the ark and the flood came
[1:58:01] and destroyed them all likewise also as
[1:58:06] it was in the days of lot they did eat
[1:58:08] they drank they bought they sold they
[1:58:11] planted they builded but the same day
[1:58:14] that lot went out of Sodom it rained
[1:58:16] fire and brimstone from heaven and
[1:58:18] destroyed them all you see a common a
[1:58:21] common situation happening here that
[1:58:26] whenever the righteous leave the scene
[1:58:31] chaos
[1:58:32] soon follows because there is no love
[1:58:36] left in the land to hold it together see
[1:58:42] how important you are oh my
[1:58:46] even thus shall it be in the day when
[1:58:48] the Son of Man is revealed in that day
[1:58:51] he would shall be upon the housetop
[1:58:53] housetop and his stuff in the house let
[1:58:56] him not come down to take it away and he
[1:58:58] that is in the field let him likewise
[1:59:00] not return back remember Lot's wife when
[1:59:03] she turned she turned to the pillar salt
[1:59:05] because she was looking unto the things
[1:59:07] that that was and and I think brother
[1:59:09] Branham said it was the desire that she
[1:59:10] had that she wanted to go back whosoever
[1:59:18] shall seek to save his life shall lose
[1:59:20] it and whosoever shall lose his life
[1:59:22] shall preserve it I tell you in that
[1:59:25] night there shall be two men in one bed
[1:59:28] the one shall be taken and the other
[1:59:31] shall be left two women shall be
[1:59:33] grinding together the one shall be taken
[1:59:35] and the other left two men shall be in
[1:59:37] the field the one shall be taken and the
[1:59:39] other left and the answered and said
[1:59:41] unto him where Lord and he said unto
[1:59:44] them wheresoever the body is there there
[1:59:48] will the eagle's be gathered together
[1:59:51] praise the Lord
[1:59:53] there were the Eagles be rallied
[1:59:56] together at the rallying point praise
[2:00:00] God you stand to your feet
[2:00:06] this morning how does it feel I need to
[2:00:14] just cut it off there you've heard me
[2:00:16] talking a lot and I hope something was
[2:00:20] was of a benefit to you I'm about out of
[2:00:27] breath for some reason I need to start
[2:00:29] work it out they say I talk a lot but I
[2:00:36] don't think I'm used to talking this
[2:00:38] much yeah I recommend going back and
[2:00:46] reading Isaiah 59 in 19 I was going to
[2:00:49] review going back but but we spend a lot
[2:00:52] of time in scriptures this morning
