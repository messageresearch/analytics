[16:37] [Music]
[16:52] [Music]
[17:01] i'd like to uh look at as i said this
[17:03] morning
[17:04] i'd like to look at the names of the
[17:06] lord
[17:08] tonight now guy can you do me a favor
[17:10] here with the wireless mic i'm sorry i
[17:11] took it off and i forgot to bring it out
[17:13] here thank you
[17:16] so let's uh there's a few scriptures
[17:20] here
[17:23] let's go to exodus 3 i think this will
[17:24] be a you know one of the pivotal
[17:26] scriptures
[17:26] here when god reveals himself to moses
[17:29] he kind of washington kind of he
[17:33] definitely tells moses about his
[17:34] character as the i am
[17:36] so let's look at that thank you sir
[17:42] exodus chapter three let's go there and
[17:44] then we'll skip down to verse
[17:47] 13 exodus 3 13.
[18:00] good to see you bang in the family and
[18:01] sister sia god bless them good to see
[18:03] them by the grace of the lord
[18:04] great job but amen here tonight thank
[18:06] you great job on songs
[18:09] exodus 3 13.
[18:18] [Music]
[18:20] i just like to preach a little thought
[18:21] on the names of god
[18:24] and i just had a little sub topic i am
[18:28] i'm sorry i am what the i am says that i
[18:32] am
[18:32] so i heard that in a song one time i
[18:34] thought that's really interesting
[18:37] i am what i am because the i am tells me
[18:40] who i am
[18:42] i was like wow i really like that um
[18:45] so i just want to just preach on that
[18:46] like that's my sub topic i
[18:48] am what the i am says i am
[18:52] i want to look at the names of god here
[18:53] so let's read exodus
[18:55] 3 13
[18:58] 14 and i actually want to read 15 2
[19:01] because god
[19:02] tells moses this about his name
[19:08] verse 13 and moses said unto god behold
[19:11] when i come
[19:12] unto the children of israel and shall
[19:14] say unto them the god of your fathers
[19:16] has sent me unto you
[19:17] and they shall say to me what is his
[19:19] name
[19:20] what shall i say unto them
[19:25] verse 14 and god said unto moses i
[19:28] am that i am
[19:32] now these words i am they're just common
[19:34] words they're just common hebrew words
[19:36] like if you
[19:36] you said to become or to exist just
[19:39] means you exist
[19:41] there's no special meaning behind these
[19:42] words he's just pointing out that i
[19:44] i've always been here i've always been
[19:47] and i always will be
[19:49] these are just common words i've always
[19:51] existed i've always been here
[19:53] i'd always be here and he said thus
[19:55] shalt thou say unto the children of
[19:56] israel i
[19:57] am hath sent me unto you
[20:01] the i am the existing one verse 15 now
[20:04] and god says a little more here
[20:07] and god said moreover unto moses thus
[20:09] shalt thou say unto the children of
[20:10] israel
[20:12] the lord god of your fathers the god of
[20:16] abraham
[20:16] the god of isaac and the god of jacob
[20:19] hath sent
[20:20] me unto you this is my name
[20:24] forever now notice he didn't say
[20:26] eternally
[20:27] because jesus gets a new name that's
[20:29] right but forever can be a long time
[20:33] right he didn't say forever he said
[20:36] i'm sorry he didn't say eternally he
[20:37] said forever
[20:40] but this was going to be his name this
[20:41] was 1491
[20:43] bc right so that's uh 20
[20:46] it's almost 2500 years i'm sorry 3500
[20:50] years ago
[20:51] he still is the i am today he still is
[20:54] the lord god jehovah today
[20:56] amen as we'll see this has been his name
[20:59] forever
[21:01] thousands of years he said and this is
[21:05] my memorial
[21:06] unto all generations his name church
[21:10] his name is a memorial we're talking
[21:13] about doing a memorial for your
[21:14] father-in-law you know
[21:15] for the bang i'd like to draw a picture
[21:16] of your time when you came up for prayer
[21:18] but god said my name is a memorial
[21:21] my name is a constant remembrance of my
[21:24] character
[21:25] let's have let's read brother amen's
[21:27] memory verse since we didn't do it last
[21:28] week

[21:35] isaiah 41 verse 10.
[21:40] and uh before we get into the word of
[21:42] god we'll say a word of prayer let's

[22:03] family is still
[22:05] see how if we we gotta just take care of
[22:08] you know feelings right we gotta
[22:09] we gotta we gotta uh we have to ask god

[22:13] but that we have asked ask god for
[22:15] healing
[22:16] and grace to make it through difficult
[22:18] times
[22:20] uh and so they really need our prayers
[22:22] let's remember them here

[24:50] here and bless all your saints in jesus
[24:52] christ's name
[24:53] and saint said amen god bless you being
[24:56] seated praise god
[24:58] as i said i do have slides for this one
[24:59] this is the one that i kind of prepared
[25:00] for
[25:01] as far as put all my time into the
[25:03] studying here
[25:05] and making slides so i want to look at
[25:07] the names of god here
[25:10] and but like i said i have the subtopic
[25:14] this is a tremendous subject you know
[25:16] and i guess i'd
[25:18] i'd remembered it was a great subject
[25:20] but i was reminded of what a
[25:22] larger subject it was than what i
[25:24] thought it was i think you'll be blessed
[25:26] tonight and uh i trust the lord will
[25:28] uh speak to your heart and help you i'm
[25:30] just looking at my notes to make sure i
[25:31] don't forget anything
[25:32] okay yeah there was one thing i wanted
[25:34] to look at here just a minute
[25:36] i just want to have it ready to go in
[25:37] case i need it
[25:39] for the ending here all right so i hope
[25:43] after this everybody comes out and they
[25:44] have a greater appreciation for the name
[25:46] of god
[25:47] i know i have just in the last few days
[25:50] of studying this
[25:51] okay here we go all right
[25:55] so i am declares who i am
[25:58] the great i am right we know god is the
[26:01] great i am as we just read there
[26:03] in the scripture he's the one who
[26:04] declares what i
[26:06] am because we know the scripture
[26:09] israel did not profit from the word
[26:11] because they didn't mix that word with
[26:13] faith
[26:14] in other words we can hear all day long
[26:16] about god and what god has done
[26:18] but at some point we've got to accept
[26:20] god's word
[26:21] and the bible says the word of god is
[26:23] nigh thee even in your mouth
[26:26] and the bible said there's life and
[26:27] death in the power of the tongue
[26:30] right so uh we can hear the word all day
[26:33] all day all day which we do sometimes
[26:35] and it's a blessing
[26:36] but unless we quote that unless we take
[26:38] that word
[26:39] and put it into action it will do no
[26:42] good for us
[26:43] and so that's what this idea is all
[26:45] about if the i am has told us what we
[26:47] are then we need to speak that and
[26:49] believe that especially in battle
[26:52] we heard about this morning there's two
[26:53] kinds of battles right there's a passive
[26:55] battle
[26:55] and then there's a more active battle
[26:57] right with the sword and you're swinging
[26:59] the sword and you're
[27:00] attacking the enemy uh and so that's
[27:03] what i'm talking about so when we get
[27:04] into more
[27:05] active battle we've got to be speaking
[27:06] the word all the time
[27:08] how many are witnessed that if you speak
[27:10] the word the devil will ultimately leave
[27:14] it may take a little while right he'll
[27:16] hang around for a season
[27:18] but if you resist the devil he will flee
[27:22] and we resist him through like jesus
[27:23] said speaking the word it is written
[27:26] it is written and many times we forget
[27:28] you know the blessings
[27:30] that are pronounced over us in the word
[27:32] of god
[27:33] that we must accept and we must believe
[27:35] and we must stand upon so
[27:37] that's kind of my sub topic the i am
[27:39] declares who i am now
[27:42] i kind of got this idea this is a
[27:44] screenshot of my scofield bible
[27:46] and this is from the book of malachi so
[27:49] malachi
[27:50] there's a note uh there's the little
[27:52] reference note the number one
[27:54] uh and i just ever since i got a
[27:56] scofield bible back in
[27:57] i must have been 2008 or 2009
[28:00] this picture has just always stayed in
[28:02] my mind every time i think about that's
[28:03] the power of pictures right
[28:05] some pictures just stay in your minds
[28:07] every time somebody asked me about god
[28:09] and the names of god i said go look in
[28:10] the scofield because it's
[28:12] it's really laid out well there now i've
[28:15] never preached on it because i've always
[28:16] known it's a it's a tremendous subject
[28:19] okay uh now what's helpful about this is
[28:22] it gives the scriptures where it's first
[28:24] used and we'll
[28:25] we'll read through actually most of
[28:26] these we're not gonna i'm not ready for
[28:28] this one this cot these compound names
[28:30] with
[28:30] l i didn't really have time to study on
[28:32] that one i just had time to study on
[28:34] these up here
[28:35] the primary and the compound with
[28:36] jehovah
[28:38] uh and it's something you know that
[28:42] we've heard many times but but it's it's
[28:44] important to know what they mean
[28:46] because it just gives us a greater
[28:48] appreciation of who god is
[28:51] and that's what these names represent
[28:52] remember name represents
[28:54] power your name represents authority
[28:59] so when god is revealing all these names
[29:01] he's showing us
[29:02] i have authority over this area
[29:04] hallelujah
[29:06] i have power over this area through my
[29:09] name
[29:10] right like jehovah jireh abraham said
[29:12] the god who provides amen
[29:14] in other words abraham was saying our
[29:16] god provides he has the authority to
[29:18] provide amen
[29:20] that makes him jehovah jireh praise god
[29:22] amen
[29:23] and so now that actually came after the
[29:25] fact you know so many of these early
[29:27] saints they had to go through great
[29:28] trials to learn the name
[29:30] but now that he's gone through it we can
[29:32] access that name
[29:33] and call on that name before we go
[29:36] through it praise god
[29:37] or as we're going through it praise god
[29:39] we can have that assurance
[29:40] that if god answered that way in the
[29:43] past he's still that god
[29:45] he still has that character he'll still
[29:48] act the same way he did back then
[29:49] amen because that's his name that's his
[29:52] authority that's his character praise
[29:54] god
[29:55] and so uh just keep this in mind uh
[29:58] uh it's a great topic and i'm just i'm
[30:01] just like i told amen now i'm just
[30:02] scratching the surface i'm really
[30:04] literally
[30:04] just scratching the surface because
[30:06] there's so there's so many names of god
[30:09] like for example if you just type in
[30:11] jehovah and look in the hebrew lexicon
[30:14] there's hundreds hundreds because some
[30:17] some places were called jehovah so and
[30:19] so right now we know there are seven
[30:21] redemptive names that's that's
[30:22] scriptural
[30:23] that deal with our redemption but
[30:24] there's also like names like uh
[30:26] you know like uh elijah was jehovah
[30:29] jehovah's are
[30:30] jehovah is my god or something like that
[30:32] i mean there's so many names that have
[30:34] like parts of jehovah in them
[30:36] right like joshua jehovah's salvation
[30:38] that's what it means like so jehovah is
[30:40] part of so many words and so many names
[30:43] right
[30:43] it's just a tremendous subject amazing
[30:45] subject and so i just want to start
[30:47] getting down into it so
[30:48] i kind of typed it out a little bit just
[30:50] to show you uh with you know to make it
[30:52] a little wider a little brighter
[30:54] so with each class there's three classes
[30:58] of names you have primary names which
[31:00] are like really
[31:00] proper names you have con and then two
[31:02] kinds of compound names
[31:04] so we have an english form of the hebrew
[31:07] equivalent that it comes from okay and
[31:10] so
[31:10] our english word god with lowercase og
[31:14] comes from el allah or elohim
[31:18] and each one has like a special
[31:19] definition or term
[31:22] okay and then lord capital l-o-r-d has a
[31:25] special
[31:26] meaning a different meaning okay so when
[31:29] he said when we say
[31:30] when we get down to lord god it means
[31:32] jehovah elohim
[31:34] okay and if you just say lord in the
[31:37] hebrew that just means add on or adonai
[31:41] just hang on just bear with me it's
[31:43] gonna it it's just
[31:46] uh it's such a deep subject i kind of i
[31:47] kind of feel intimidated with it but i'm
[31:49] just trying to make it
[31:50] i'm trying to keep it as simple as i can
[31:52] uh some subjects i really gravitate to
[31:54] this is one that's been kind of harder
[31:55] to kind of get into
[31:56] because i don't know hebrew right
[31:58] anybody here know hebrew
[32:00] anybody teach me a lesson on hebrew
[32:01] anybody teach me a lesson on greek and i
[32:03] don't really want to go
[32:04] learn greek or hebrew i'd rather say in
[32:05] the revelation of this message you know
[32:07] i'd rather stay in that but i see how it
[32:09] can be helpful at times
[32:11] but god has revealed enough to us where
[32:13] we don't have to be scholars right we
[32:14] don't have to be the scribes
[32:16] we don't have to be uh scribes pharisees
[32:18] uh
[32:19] lawyers we have to be that we can just
[32:21] be souls of like precious faith amen
[32:24] we just want to be believers in the name
[32:26] of god praise god
[32:27] and his character so i just put an arrow
[32:30] in here i could have put an arrow in
[32:31] each one because they all
[32:32] show the equivalent right uh lord god
[32:35] and then lord
[32:36] god and then lord of hosts okay and i
[32:38] actually didn't get the lord of hosts i
[32:40] kind of ran out of time there so
[32:41] we'll just see how far we can get by the
[32:43] grace of god here let me set a timer
[32:46] just to kind of watch my time okay so
[32:48] let's go through the primary names first
[32:51] okay we have these pride and
[32:52] primary names and let's look at the the
[32:54] word
[32:55] uh god yeah so we have three primary
[32:58] names we have god
[32:59] lord with capital and then we have
[33:02] lowercase lord
[33:03] or l-o-r-d like that
[33:08] okay all right
[33:11] so i've always wondered why does lord
[33:12] have all caps in the king james version
[33:15] but other versions it doesn't
[33:17] it's because it has a different meaning
[33:18] okay so let's start with the first one
[33:20] god now god in hebrew means
[33:24] el ella or elohim
[33:27] because each one has a different meaning
[33:29] now the first occurrence is genesis 1 1.
[33:32] in the beginning elohim created the
[33:36] heaven and the earth now remember moses
[33:38] wrote that
[33:39] so moses had a revelation well this was
[33:41] 1500 years after god had done it
[33:45] moses gets the vision he looks back he
[33:46] said in the beginning elohim
[33:49] created the heaven and earth now elohim
[33:51] means strong one
[33:52] in hebrew isn't that interesting they
[33:55] just called him strong one
[33:57] he's so brothers let's not think we're
[33:58] so strong okay because we can't compare
[34:01] anything to this guy
[34:02] this great god almighty he's much more
[34:04] stronger than we are right
[34:07] so it means strong one in the hebrew now
[34:09] scofield
[34:10] i want to try to cite i'm using mainly
[34:12] scofield for these
[34:14] it means strength or strong one l does l
[34:17] means
[34:17] strength or strong one and then allah
[34:20] which the muslims gonna take that right
[34:22] means to swear or bind oneself by an
[34:25] oath uh so that implies faithfulness
[34:28] so the strong faithful one so there are
[34:31] different ways you could just kind of
[34:33] like summarize
[34:34] it but the hebrew lexicon just says
[34:36] strong one
[34:38] but you can really dig deep down deep
[34:40] into the hebrew meanings
[34:42] okay so there's just a lot of different
[34:45] hebrew meanings and a lot of different
[34:46] like like a lexicon i remember i showed
[34:48] you the picture lexicon for one word you
[34:50] can have
[34:51] like nine different meanings for one
[34:54] word
[34:55] right and so the the scholars try to
[34:57] find the best meanings of the words
[35:01] okay so this is normally the strong one
[35:04] and this word god is used
[35:05] 2 500 times so it's a common word like
[35:08] either talking about god
[35:09] or it can be used to talk about angels
[35:11] this one greek word
[35:13] but every time it every time the
[35:15] translators would read it they would
[35:16] always put the capital g
[35:17] there because they knew oh strong one
[35:19] this speaking of our god
[35:22] right this is speaking of elohim this
[35:24] ain't speaking of some angel although
[35:25] they're strong
[35:26] but not as strong as god so see
[35:28] translators had quite a job didn't they
[35:31] i'm glad i'm not a translator you would
[35:34] really need the anointing of the holy
[35:36] ghost for translation thank god they had
[35:37] it too praise god
[35:39] uh so when you said in the beginning god
[35:44] in the beginning elohim the strong one
[35:47] created heaven and earth now the second
[35:50] primary name
[35:51] is lord with capital l-o-r-d
[35:55] that means jehovah
[35:58] in the hebrew and that means the
[36:02] self-existent one
[36:03] okay and the first occurrence is genesis
[36:08] 2 verse 4. these are the generations of
[36:10] the heavens and of the earth when they
[36:12] were created
[36:13] in the day when look how moses now
[36:15] changes his name a little bit
[36:17] in the day when the lord god
[36:20] made the earth and the heavens before he
[36:22] was just elohim
[36:23] but now he's getting more specific
[36:26] jehovah
[36:26] elohim right because now he's talking
[36:29] about this god creating man
[36:32] right and man needs god to exist
[36:36] so in each time when this is why it's
[36:38] such a tremendous study
[36:40] you can look at every different time a
[36:41] name is used of god
[36:43] and that that will apply directly to
[36:45] what they needed in that time
[36:48] okay i'll show you some examples it's
[36:49] amazing so in other words whatever they
[36:51] needed
[36:52] god would provide amen and god would
[36:55] show another
[36:56] facet of his character he'd show another
[36:59] attribute like abraham i'm provider
[37:02] praise god hallelujah to each one i'm
[37:05] the healer
[37:06] right joshua i'm the savior amen i'm the
[37:09] captain of the lord's host with you
[37:10] praise god
[37:11] each one he would manifest different
[37:13] attributes
[37:14] right and so that's where we can see the
[37:17] beauty of god's names
[37:19] okay let me turn back here in my bible
[37:23] i want to get back to genesis real quick
[37:25] just i have a reference here
[37:30] okay
[37:33] all right so now here's a little
[37:36] background now lord means jehovah the
[37:38] self-existent one but
[37:39] notice jehovah is actually like a
[37:42] nickname
[37:43] a respectful nickname for yahweh
[37:46] yahweh is actually the most proper name
[37:49] of god
[37:50] in the old testament okay yahweh yahweh
[37:53] was the most sacred name so
[37:55] it was so sacred they they didn't want
[37:57] to say yahweh
[37:59] because they might disrespect the lord's
[38:01] name right
[38:02] just like sometimes isn't it sometimes
[38:05] maybe we we might not use
[38:06] the name jesus with as much respect as
[38:08] we should right and god forgive us
[38:11] you know especially if we use it in a
[38:12] joke or something may god have
[38:14] mercy on us and help us to always honor
[38:17] that hallowed name
[38:19] right we've got to be careful how we say
[38:20] the name of the lord jesus right
[38:22] hallowed be thy name and so they wanted
[38:25] to take a step well
[38:26] we can take a step to try to protect
[38:29] that holy name
[38:30] we'll just call him jehovah so that's
[38:33] what they did
[38:33] they just they just call him jehovah now
[38:35] there's a lot to this like
[38:37] with jehovah they first didn't have any
[38:39] vowels in it and it was just
[38:40] it was just some other word but then
[38:42] they added some vials to make it sound
[38:44] better it's so deep i mean it is so deep
[38:48] i can't even scratch the surface of it
[38:49] i'm just trying to go over this the top
[38:51] so you have a general understanding
[38:53] what's going on here okay
[38:54] like there it's it's so in-depth uh
[38:57] i've had you know remember remember
[38:59] brother ray brother ray he studies this
[39:01] he studies like the hebrew uh origins of
[39:05] names and he's saying things i'm like i
[39:07] can't it's just going right over the top
[39:09] i i don't know about that i'm not sure i
[39:12] wish i knew i don't know
[39:14] you know because i can't study that plus
[39:15] the word and preach you know or else i'd
[39:17] be fully into the
[39:18] the hebrew origins of language
[39:23] uh so i'm just trying to summarize it so
[39:25] yahweh was the most
[39:27] holy hebrew name so they said let's
[39:29] protect that let's call him jehovah
[39:32] that's what they did it was substituted
[39:33] in reverence
[39:36] but now scofield says the complete
[39:38] meaning of jehovah
[39:40] is the self-existent one who reveals
[39:43] himself
[39:44] okay so here let me read now it's not up
[39:46] here but here's what scofield says
[39:52] he says hava from which jehovah or
[39:55] is formed so that va that
[39:58] hova in hebrew he says that means to
[40:02] self-revelation
[40:04] i'm sorry to become or to become known
[40:09] thus pointing to a continuous and
[40:11] increasing
[40:12] self-revelation so
[40:15] god is becoming to you god is
[40:18] continually revealing more of himself to
[40:21] you
[40:22] hallelujah right right we love what we
[40:25] know about god but we know there's more
[40:27] right and so that's part of his name i
[40:30] am the self-existing one
[40:32] and i'm continually revealing more of
[40:34] myself
[40:35] to you now that's where denominations
[40:38] and even message denominations fall
[40:40] short they think they know all about it
[40:42] and they stop asking god for more
[40:44] revelation of himself
[40:45] we must not do that we must say lord i
[40:47] know there's more revelation
[40:49] there's more to you reveal more of
[40:51] yourself to me praise god
[40:53] you see the devil puts up a scarecrow
[40:55] and say oh well brother ram didn't use
[40:56] that scripture you can't use it that's a
[40:58] scarecrow
[40:58] if you've got the holy spirit it'll line
[41:00] up with what brother branham said amen
[41:03] he don't have to say every he didn't say
[41:05] every word in the bible he didn't preach
[41:06] on every
[41:07] sermon or i'm sorry every scripture in
[41:09] the bible but that's okay the holy
[41:11] spirit will help it line up with
[41:12] everything he did say
[41:14] that it did line up in the bible
[41:17] so i get criticized been criticized many
[41:18] times for that because i'll preach a
[41:20] scripture i don't have a quote for
[41:22] that's okay i got a quote right here for
[41:24] it's right from the bible praise god
[41:26] i might not have a brother branham quote
[41:27] but i got a god quote
[41:29] and i'll tell you that's a little more
[41:31] powerful than brother branham's quotes
[41:33] a lot more powerful amen
[41:36] although we need a prophet we needed a
[41:38] prophet the bible said we had to send a
[41:40] prophet a seventh church
[41:42] messenger right god had to send a
[41:44] forerunner
[41:45] but the the quote i end my next coming
[41:48] book with is a quote where brother
[41:50] brahma says
[41:50] he said if we would just put a comma
[41:52] instead of a period he said we'd have
[41:54] revelation after revelation he said
[41:56] revival
[41:57] after revival so that's the very last
[42:00] quote i end with the book in the book
[42:02] uh right now it's in the final stage i
[42:04] have the final copy and i'm reading
[42:06] through it one more time
[42:07] i've already found like 30 mistakes
[42:10] so that means before i submitted it i
[42:11] missed all those mistakes like bb
[42:14] or i forgot a quotation mark or
[42:15] something so
[42:17] i'm four chapters through i got what i
[42:20] got ten more chapters to go through this
[42:21] week but hopefully after this week i'll
[42:23] have it all done
[42:24] uh and then hopefully it'll be released
[42:26] end of june or early july i'm excited
[42:27] because i'm almost there
[42:29] i can see the light brother bang at the
[42:30] end of the tunnel
[42:33] how many months has it been it's almost
[42:34] been mercy it's been too long
[42:36] anyways my point is that god wants to
[42:38] reveal more of himself to us
[42:41] praise god that's his name that's who he
[42:43] is
[42:44] i'm a self-existing one and i'm going to
[42:46] give more revelation of myself
[42:48] to all those who want it not to the wise
[42:52] and prudent but to the babes that want
[42:54] to learn amen
[42:56] that's what he reveals himself to jesus
[42:58] thank the lord for that
[42:59] i thank you that you reveal yourself to
[43:01] people that want more of your revelation
[43:04] amen remember king uzziah
[43:07] got leprosy because he stopped seeking
[43:09] the lord
[43:10] as long as he sought god god bless him
[43:13] but as soon as he got lifted up in pride
[43:15] he stopped going to look in the bible
[43:16] for more revelation
[43:17] he got leprosy got lifted up in pride
[43:20] let us not be a usia praise god
[43:22] let us be a paul amen who pressed on
[43:25] towards the mark
[43:26] praise god who knew there was a crowd of
[43:28] righteousness awaiting him
[43:29] who fought the good fight and won the
[43:31] prize amen amen hallelujah
[43:34] thank the lord so
[43:38] this has used almost 519 times in the
[43:41] old testament
[43:42] lord so if you just type in lord god
[43:44] you'll find a lot of them
[43:46] it's a common uh reference to god it's
[43:49] just this lord jehovah
[43:51] the self-existent one so when you say
[43:54] lord when your prayer
[43:55] lord i love you you're saying
[43:56] self-existent one i love you
[43:59] see like this is the things we don't
[44:01] think about often right we forget
[44:03] that's why hebrew language is so rich
[44:06] right in meaning these words mean more
[44:09] to them because they're taught that from
[44:10] a young age
[44:11] and so that's why it's good for us to go
[44:13] back and learn some of that
[44:15] because we can remember when i pray i'm
[44:16] talking to the god who exists before
[44:19] before me after me who created time
[44:22] he i i'm in his hands praise god all my
[44:25] days are in his hands he's numbered my
[44:27] hairs on my head even when they fall out
[44:29] he numbers them
[44:30] he numbers them he's numbered my days he
[44:32] numbers my steps
[44:33] the footsteps of the righteous or or the
[44:35] lord i'm in the heart i'm in the palm of
[44:38] god i'm in the hand of god amen
[44:40] he's the self-existent one he has
[44:42] control over my whole life
[44:44] i love this okay so that's what scofield
[44:47] says now
[44:47] as i said i read a little bit of extra
[44:50] he said combining these meanings of hava
[44:54] or hova we arrive at the meaning of the
[44:56] name jehovah he's the self-existent one
[44:59] who reveals himself the name
[45:02] is in itself an advance upon the name of
[45:04] god
[45:06] so jehovah is an advanced form of god in
[45:09] other words
[45:09] god revealed more of himself first he
[45:12] was elohim
[45:13] the strong one but now he's the
[45:15] self-existent one who wants to reveal
[45:17] himself
[45:18] so god is continually revealing more of
[45:20] himself
[45:21] to his people amen hallelujah i love
[45:24] this
[45:24] beautiful
[45:28] see so his first attribute he revealed
[45:30] was i'm strong
[45:33] then he reveals i'm i'm self-existent
[45:36] and i want to reveal more myself to you
[45:40] that's in genesis chapter 2 church right
[45:43] after adam and eve were created then he
[45:45] reveals himself
[45:46] i'm the lord god oh it's glorious
[45:54] beautiful all right now here i got this
[45:57] a long time ago from brother donnie
[45:58] reagan i just love a
[46:00] few few preachers have helped me in my
[46:02] christian walk more than donnie reagan
[46:04] now there's a few things he said
[46:05] recently that
[46:05] i kind of disagree with a couple things
[46:08] uh but as a man of god i
[46:09] i couldn't be more grateful for his
[46:11] ministry this helped me tremendously
[46:13] i still listened to some of his sermons
[46:15] when he preached about brahm tabernacle
[46:17] back in 2002 i got them all on my phone
[46:19] brother i got five here i stand sermons
[46:21] i listen
[46:22] from time to time and man i'm like
[46:23] there's so much revelation on those
[46:25] sermons
[46:26] it just it really encourages me but i
[46:28] just want you to notice
[46:29] 11 times in genesis 2
[46:32] moses calls god the lord god first he
[46:35] was only god in chapter 1
[46:37] elohim but then in chapter 2 he's called
[46:40] lord god 11 times
[46:42] but when that lion devil
[46:46] anointed that serpent he come up to eve
[46:48] and said yay
[46:50] hath god said
[46:53] he took him back just to being elohim
[46:57] he become lord god jehovah elohim
[47:01] right but satan took a part of his
[47:04] character away
[47:05] he took a part of the self-existent one
[47:07] that wants to reveal his true nature
[47:10] to you in other words he started he went
[47:12] he deleted some of god's revelation
[47:16] he just called him elohim the strong one
[47:19] hath the strong one really said this
[47:21] instead of has jehovah elohim said this
[47:24] have the self-existent strong one who
[47:27] reveals more of himself
[47:28] he took that out and is that what satan
[47:32] always does he either adds to the word
[47:33] or takes away from it isn't that what
[47:36] his job is his job is
[47:39] in your brother tells us his job is to
[47:41] make you discredit the word
[47:44] and that can either be adding to the
[47:45] word taken away from the word
[47:47] doubting the word but look at the devil
[47:49] change in the name of god he did the
[47:51] same thing when he sprinkled with father
[47:53] son holy ghost
[47:54] right that's blasphemy amen brother
[47:58] preaches that in the seals he he
[48:00] blasphemed god's name
[48:01] his tabernacle and his saints in heaven
[48:03] amen
[48:05] he blasphemed the name of god by
[48:07] changing it from lord jesus christ to
[48:09] the titles father son holy ghost
[48:11] he is all those titles but that's not
[48:13] his name amen
[48:15] his name is the lord jesus christ amen
[48:18] amen
[48:19] and he's blasting the catholic church is
[48:21] blasting god's name by doing that
[48:23] just like satan did right there in the
[48:25] beginning
[48:26] he only calls him god elohim he leaves
[48:29] out his nature as jehovah
[48:32] oh my now the third
[48:35] now remember these are primary names god
[48:38] lord with all caps and now
[48:40] lord adonai
[48:43] i love this now the first occurrence is
[48:46] genesis 15
[48:47] 2 and abraham said lord god
[48:52] what will now give me seeing i go
[48:54] childless
[48:55] and the steward of my house is this
[48:57] eleazar of damascus
[49:00] notice he never been called adonai
[49:02] before
[49:04] right you can look it up in the hebrew
[49:06] look it up yeah you can look it up
[49:08] this is the first time he's ever called
[49:10] adonai
[49:11] and it came to the father of the faith
[49:15] so the father of the faith abraham gets
[49:17] the revelation
[49:18] that not only is he jehovah elohim
[49:21] he's also adonai
[49:24] right and adonai means master so he's
[49:30] saying lord
[49:31] master jehovah
[49:34] that church what does master represent
[49:36] well he's my ruler
[49:38] i'm a servant praise god i'm a slave
[49:42] how many love slaves we have to jesus
[49:44] out there how many prisoners paul said
[49:46] i'm a prisoner i'm a slave of christ
[49:49] amen
[49:50] in other words he's saying god jesus is
[49:52] my adonai praise god
[49:55] he's my master i'm a slave i'm a servant
[49:58] but it's by love
[49:59] i'm a bond servant of love i'm a
[50:01] prisoner of love amen
[50:03] slave to the master lies that song
[50:05] jackie bennett always saying
[50:11] now schofield says yeah adonai means
[50:14] master in the hebrew
[50:15] first time everyone anyone ever called
[50:17] god master as least recordings in holy
[50:20] writ
[50:20] was abraham he said
[50:24] adonai master elohim
[50:28] master elohim now this is used to
[50:31] express the relationship between god
[50:33] as master and the believer as a servant
[50:36] and this is another good example
[50:38] moses prayed this is near our text here
[50:41] right when he was being commissioned to
[50:42] take over egypt
[50:43] he said oh my adonai i am not
[50:47] eloquent see god's trying to commission
[50:50] him to do something
[50:51] and and moses says it right lord you're
[50:54] my adonai
[50:55] you're my master but i can't do it you
[50:58] think your master would ever ask you to
[50:59] do something you couldn't do
[51:00] not this master not the holy master
[51:04] not the strong master he would ask you
[51:05] to do something unless they'll equip you
[51:08] to do it praise god
[51:09] so moses had the right response adonai
[51:12] master
[51:13] how can i do this i want to serve you
[51:15] i've been waiting
[51:16] 80 years to serve you hallelujah i had
[51:19] to get 40 years beat all that knowledge
[51:21] of egypt out of me i've been waiting to
[51:23] be a real servant
[51:24] here now i can serve you master how can
[51:26] i do it i'm not able
[51:28] and god said who made your mouth servant
[51:32] and if you still got trouble i'll make
[51:33] aaron your prophet and you be god
[51:36] right the master was going to do this
[51:40] the master was going to set up his
[51:42] servant for success amen
[51:44] church god is setting us up to succeed
[51:46] amen
[51:48] just keep the word of god you'll be a
[51:49] great success
[51:51] hallelujah just like god told joshua
[51:54] you'll be a great success just keep the
[51:56] word of god
[52:00] and this is used of course many many
[52:02] times lord
[52:04] is used over and over again without the
[52:06] capitals okay so that's adonai
[52:08] you have jehovah you have adonai elohim
[52:13] all right now i just highlighted the
[52:15] ones kind of involved that we went over
[52:17] those are the only ones i had time as i
[52:18] finished up studying this morning
[52:20] those are the ones and now like i said
[52:22] the beautiful thing about a scofield
[52:24] bible
[52:25] is that he has all the references you
[52:28] can just go right there and you can find
[52:29] the notes about it
[52:30] and he did a lot of that groundwork okay
[52:33] so he did a lot of the hebrew studying
[52:35] the hebrew and he kind of put it into
[52:36] this
[52:37] uh wonderful bible so i just ordered a
[52:40] new scofield bible
[52:41] did didn't we get you one brother
[52:43] william and you got it right there came
[52:45] back
[52:46] all right went across the ocean come
[52:47] back praise the lord i just brought a
[52:49] new one but i didn't buy it from voice
[52:50] of god because voice of god puts that
[52:52] one in there i know we both have one
[52:53] right
[52:55] but this is why this is wrong i
[52:58] appreciate what they do but look they
[52:59] said may your understanding of the words
[53:01] written this holy book
[53:03] agree line for line word for word and
[53:05] dot for dot with the message of the
[53:06] hour that's heresy
[53:10] may your understanding of this book line
[53:12] up with every word brother branham said
[53:14] that's heresy
[53:16] right that's why i thought this time i'm
[53:19] not getting one from voice of god i'm
[53:20] just getting a plain one
[53:22] now i'm gonna miss some of these
[53:23] pictures in here
[53:25] i'm gonna miss brother brown's letter to
[53:27] the lord you know i'm gonna miss that
[53:28] i may rip that out and just put it in my
[53:30] new scope for the bible
[53:33] it's a beautiful he says dear god help
[53:35] me to be thy true servant i promise to
[53:37] teach this thy holy word
[53:39] and to live it as
[53:43] though as thou will help me to do i do
[53:46] believe
[53:46] every word in this bible to be thy word
[53:50] help me to live and prove it so to my
[53:52] generation
[53:53] look at these words in jesus christ's
[53:56] name
[53:56] i pray a man reverend william branham
[53:59] tucson arizona
[54:00] his unworthy humble servant my goodness
[54:04] isn't that beautiful now that's a real
[54:06] servant of god right there
[54:08] he didn't say lord make my tapes equal
[54:11] to your bible he didn't say that
[54:12] he said may i make this bible live and
[54:16] that's what he did
[54:17] he accomplished god answered his prayer
[54:19] i'll say it like that praise god
[54:21] but just you know just a little point
[54:22] there about the scofield bible now you
[54:24] can still get one if you want you can
[54:25] get one from
[54:26] voice of god i could just cross it off
[54:27] with a permanent marker right i could
[54:28] just do that
[54:29] but i thought since i'm getting a new
[54:30] one i'm not going to get that one this
[54:32] time
[54:33] uh just to kind of separate myself a
[54:35] little bit although you know i do
[54:37] appreciate the brothers
[54:38] okay so like i said i'll have to go
[54:41] through
[54:43] this uh since we have time i'm only 30
[54:46] i'm only 20 minutes into this okay uh
[54:48] since we have time to get your bibles
[54:49] let's go through the seven compound
[54:50] names of jehovah just briefly
[54:52] let's just read them out of here uh you
[54:54] know because schofield has him right
[54:56] here on his notes so if you have a
[54:57] scofield bible
[54:58] he lists them right here with references
[55:00] that's a real help
[55:01] see i didn't have time to put him up
[55:02] there so we're just going to read them
[55:03] right out of here
[55:08] okay so the first one is jehovah jireh
[55:10] the lord will provide how about i get
[55:11] some of those readers out there some
[55:12] young people all right elizabeth first
[55:14] one hand up nature all right
[55:15] elizabeth can you read genesis
[55:19] 13 22 14 and then nature how about
[55:22] exodus 15 26
[55:26] so genesis 22 13 and 14 elizabeth
[55:30] and then nature exodus 15 26 these are
[55:32] the first two jehovah jireh and jehovah
[55:35] rapha
[55:37] i love this as see the more time you
[55:39] spend with god the more you learn about
[55:41] his character
[55:43] abraham came to know him as he's my
[55:45] provider
[55:46] when it seems like there's no way he'll
[55:48] provide when i don't have what i need
[55:50] he'll provide it that's his name that's
[55:53] who he is
[55:53] that's what he does amen and if you
[55:56] don't product provide then i didn't need
[55:57] it
[55:58] right all right if god don't provide it
[56:00] then it wasn't meant for me to have it
[56:02] and i can live with that because i can
[56:04] trust the almighty god i can trust trust
[56:05] the self-existing one
[56:08] i can trust i can trust jehovah
[56:11] hallelujah okay so elizabeth genesis 22
[56:14] 13 and 14 when you're ready
[56:42] is
[56:57] amen wonderful elizabeth so see abraham
[57:00] caught it
[57:01] so here's like kind of like another
[57:02] memorial like we talked about this
[57:03] morning
[57:04] that's all god's army was about overcome
[57:07] and then remember it that's what i'm
[57:10] saying this morning
[57:11] i heard a preacher say i thought that
[57:12] was a good idea joshua could just be
[57:13] called overcome and remember that's what
[57:15] the whole book can be called that
[57:17] overcome all the enemies and don't
[57:18] forget about it remember how god is with
[57:21] you he's brought you this far
[57:23] he'll continue to be with you he'll
[57:25] never forsake you
[57:26] you will succeed you will overcome your
[57:29] invincible army
[57:31] glory praise god and so abraham gets
[57:34] this ramp
[57:35] he says this place is jehovah jireh
[57:38] right in the mount of the lord there it
[57:41] is jehovah in the mount of jehovah it
[57:43] shall be seen
[57:45] hallelujah that was mount moriah too
[57:47] that's where christ would later be
[57:48] crucified right there on that mountain
[57:49] right there god would provide himself
[57:52] another sacrifice amen
[57:54] a lamb behold the lamb of god who takes
[57:57] away the sin of the world jehovah
[57:59] providing it
[58:00] providing you and i a sacrifice he did a
[58:02] divine exchange children praise god
[58:06] he exchanged our sin for his
[58:08] righteousness amen
[58:11] jehovah jireh hallelujah so in context
[58:14] god's providing us owns his own
[58:16] sacrifice okay nature uh
[58:18] exodus 15 26. whenever you're ready
[58:44] [Music]

[59:16] hey man amen hallelujah so remember this
[59:19] is right
[59:19] after they come out this right after
[59:20] exodus right the people murmured against
[59:23] moses what shall you drink
[59:24] remember he cast a tree in the waters
[59:26] the bitter witness became sweet
[59:28] so you cat you cast the cross into any
[59:30] bitter situation it's going to turn out
[59:31] sweet
[59:32] right just with the cross in there mercy
[59:34] forgiveness sacrifice divine exchange
[59:37] amen
[59:37] just cast christ cross in any situation
[59:40] makes it sweet and then god said uh keep
[59:43] all my commandments you'll have no
[59:45] diseases
[59:46] that will stay on you for i am the lord
[59:48] that healeth thee
[59:49] for i am the jehovah that healeth thee

[59:56] he reveals himself to moses
[59:58] i'm jehovah rapha i like what it said
[1:00:00] earlier in the verse
[1:00:01] if you hearken to the voice of jehovah
[1:00:03] thy elohim

[1:00:07] self-existent one

[1:00:48] some of these
[1:00:49] exodus 17 8 to 15.
[1:00:54] okay this is right after yeah right
[1:00:56] after joshua has chosen to go fight yeah
[1:00:58] this is his first battle right
[1:01:00] we preached on this a while back yeah
[1:01:02] remember they hold up uh aaron and her
[1:01:05] hold up moses's hands right and then we
[1:01:08] see down uh there in 14
[1:01:11] and the lord said to moses write this
[1:01:13] for a memorial in a book see it's always
[1:01:14] about remembrance
[1:01:15] don't forget this don't forget what
[1:01:16] god's done and rehearse in the ears of
[1:01:19] joshua
[1:01:20] for i will utterly put out the
[1:01:22] remembrance of amloc from under heaven
[1:01:23] we just stopped there for a moment
[1:01:24] these people were constantly supposed to
[1:01:26] whisper to joshua you're strong
[1:01:28] be strong be very courageous remember
[1:01:31] when you
[1:01:32] defeated the amalekites i remember when
[1:01:34] aaron and her held up moses hands
[1:01:36] remember that
[1:01:36] don't forget that that god is with you
[1:01:38] in other words god will always do
[1:01:40] something supernatural
[1:01:41] so you can get the victory right just
[1:01:44] look up to where the man
[1:01:45] just look up to the man praise god just
[1:01:47] look up to the cross amen just look up
[1:01:49] to jesus

[1:01:51] long as your your faith is in god and
[1:01:53] your hands are not falling down and
[1:01:55] weary
[1:01:56] as long as you're strong you'll get the
[1:01:57] victory praise god
[1:01:59] he said write this and tell him about it
[1:02:01] over and over again
[1:02:05] that's why i like when preachers tell
[1:02:06] testimonies anybody like that when
[1:02:08] preachers
[1:02:08] i love it when preachers i love when
[1:02:10] they can put the word together
[1:02:11] but i like more when they can tell me a
[1:02:13] good testimony

[1:02:16] backed up that god's moving in their
[1:02:18] life

[1:02:26] until the until i get one
[1:02:28] because i want to hear what god has done
[1:02:29] for them lately praise god
[1:02:31] see because god we must remember all
[1:02:33] that he's done and that
[1:02:35] raises our faith for the current battle

[1:04:26] yeah this is right after he meets the
[1:04:27] angel right when he's getting
[1:04:27] commissioned he hasn't defeated the
[1:04:28] midianites yet
[1:04:29] right after his commission verse 24 then
[1:04:31] gideon built an altar unto the lord and
[1:04:33] called it jehovah shalom
[1:04:35] unto this day it is yet an orpha of the
[1:04:39] aborigines i'm sorry abba herzeits sorry

[1:05:03] behind here
[1:05:03] the threshing floor right yeah you're a
[1:05:05] pretty strong valiant man hiding behind
[1:05:08] here now i'm just kind of making it a
[1:05:09] little silly but god wasn't playing
[1:05:11] around
[1:05:11] god said you're a man of valor see many
[1:05:13] times god is telling us what we are
[1:05:16] but he's he's saying that so we'll grow
[1:05:18] into it
[1:05:19] ah church we're a we are a uh
[1:05:24] a rapture destined people we may not
[1:05:27] feel like it yet
[1:05:28] but that's what god is telling us amen
[1:05:32] we are a people by god's grace if he
[1:05:34] tarries we may escape
[1:05:36] death we're a people that will be the
[1:05:38] most privileged people
[1:05:40] that could ever be on the face of the
[1:05:41] earth amen
[1:05:43] to skip funerals and to not have to die
[1:05:45] not have to taste death
[1:05:47] but he's telling us in advance we may
[1:05:49] not be our faith may not be where it
[1:05:51] wants to be
[1:05:51] but god always does that he always calls
[1:05:54] you amen
[1:05:55] he calls you then equips you and then he
[1:05:57] strengthens you along the journey
[1:05:58] and you get the victory praise god he
[1:06:01] said you're a mighty man of valor hiding
[1:06:03] back here

[1:06:33] but that's what he says he says i am
[1:06:36] jehovah shalom
[1:06:38] jehovah the lord send peace
[1:06:41] the self-existent one is sending you
[1:06:44] peace
[1:06:45] how'd he send him peace he said i'm an
[1:06:47] angel hallelujah
[1:06:49] now remember then he still got scared
[1:06:51] and so he you know he did the
[1:06:53] uh he did the wolves right what are
[1:06:54] those called again
[1:06:56] the fleece there we go please i always
[1:06:58] forget that word he put the fleece
[1:07:00] before the lord
[1:07:01] he kept asking god for more signs then
[1:07:03] the last one was that dream of the bread
[1:07:05] the
[1:07:06] midnight's had the dream of the bread
[1:07:07] coming down destroying the camp see and
[1:07:09] god was just encouraging
[1:07:10] god had called and do something our
[1:07:12] church when god has called us to do
[1:07:14] something he's going to make sure we
[1:07:15] accomplish it amen
[1:07:17] but this is where god revealed himself
[1:07:19] i'm jehovah shalom
[1:07:21] i'm the self-existent one revealing
[1:07:22] himself as i will always send you peace
[1:07:25] how many had peace
[1:07:26] from god amen you mean you might not
[1:07:29] have

[1:07:37] it amen
[1:07:40] i should not have been in a peaceful
[1:07:41] state but i was in peace
[1:07:43] because god is my peace and he revealed
[1:07:47] himself
[1:07:47] as the god of peace to me praise god
[1:07:50] that's we have to remember when people
[1:07:52] get sick or people go through hard times
[1:07:53] we've got to keep the peace right we got
[1:07:55] to keep peace in our hearts and give

[1:10:35] uh jeremiah 23 6 jehovah tiscanu
[1:10:39] jeremiah 23 6.
[1:10:44] not real polished up on jeremiah meaning
[1:10:46] i haven't read it recently
[1:10:49] looks like this chapter he's yeah he's
[1:10:51] rebuking the pastors
[1:10:53] at the beginning they scatter the flock
[1:10:56] and drive them away
[1:10:59] he said i'm still going to gather the
[1:11:00] remnant out of there i'll set up
[1:11:02] shepherds to feed them they'll feel no
[1:11:04] more fear no more the people won't be
[1:11:06] dismayed lacking
[1:11:07] verse 5. behold the days come say the
[1:11:13] lord that i will raise
[1:11:14] unto david a righteous branch and a king
[1:11:16] shall reign and prosper
[1:11:17] and shall execute judgment and justice
[1:11:19] in the earth in his days judah shall be
[1:11:21] saved and israel shall dwell safely
[1:11:23] and this is his name whereby he shall be
[1:11:26] called
[1:11:27] the lord our righteousness praise god
[1:11:31] jehovah tiscanu our righteousness
[1:11:34] this is concerning the future
[1:11:36] restoration and conversion of israel
[1:11:39] praise god in other words jesus came to
[1:11:42] be our righteousness
[1:11:43] jehovah the self-existent one takes our
[1:11:46] place
[1:11:47] and his righteousness is imputed to us
[1:11:50] he we give him our sins and our sorrows
[1:11:53] and all of our
[1:11:54] shortcomings we give him our sins and
[1:11:56] sorrows on the cross right
[1:11:58] and he gives us his righteousness amen
[1:12:02] fulfilled in christ amen jehovah this
[1:12:04] canoe he's my righteousness amen
[1:12:07] church after all these six what more
[1:12:08] could you want right there's heart i
[1:12:10] mean what what more could you need
[1:12:12] but there's one more seventh
[1:12:17] is ezekiel 48 35 ezekiel 48
[1:12:22] 35
[1:12:29] last okay last verse of the chapter
[1:12:36] now if i'm not mistaken this is speaking
[1:12:37] of the millennial temple if i'm not
[1:12:39] mistaken i could be wrong on that one
[1:12:40] it's been a while since i brushed up on
[1:12:42] that one
[1:12:43] i use that language because that's what
[1:12:44] brother brown used in the seals he said
[1:12:45] i need to brush up on that russia
[1:12:47] or polish up because i need to polish it
[1:12:49] up on that one
[1:12:51] so here it is the last one jehovah shama
[1:12:54] which means the lord
[1:12:55] the self-existent one is present
[1:12:59] so verse 35 says round about 18 000
[1:13:01] measures and the name of the city from
[1:13:03] that day shall be
[1:13:04] the lord is there oh what a millennium
[1:13:07] church like brother said don't miss the
[1:13:10] millennium
[1:13:10] whatever you do don't miss the
[1:13:12] millennium in other words whatever you
[1:13:13] do get the holy ghost amen
[1:13:17] for the rest of the dead live not to the
[1:13:19] thousand years or over
[1:13:20] but there's going to be a people that
[1:13:22] live the bible said they're going to
[1:13:23] rule and reign
[1:13:25] and they were the ones that overcame the
[1:13:26] beast they overcame the catholic church
[1:13:29] jezebel and their daughters praise god
[1:13:31] that's where i want to be
[1:13:33] i want to be where the lord is amen
[1:13:36] hallelujah
[1:13:38] where i am there the self-existent one
[1:13:40] is there amen
[1:13:42] oh my oh the millennium ah
[1:13:46] he said don't miss that
[1:13:49] that's where jehovah is jehovah shaman
[1:13:53] now remember church now we use this
[1:13:54] that's actually speaking the millennium
[1:13:56] but we use this for today because he
[1:13:57] said i'll never leave you
[1:13:58] or forsake you so that scripture is used
[1:14:01] for the physical body of jesus the
[1:14:02] millennium
[1:14:03] but we can use it as a spiritual sense
[1:14:05] because he promised he would never leave
[1:14:07] us nor forsake us
[1:14:09] right he's standing he's standing in the
[1:14:11] midst of the candlesticks you have seven
[1:14:12] candlesticks
[1:14:13] he's right in the middle of those
[1:14:14] candlesticks he said i'm with you to the
[1:14:16] end of the age
[1:14:18] in matthew 28 verse 20. so there's seven
[1:14:23] now what's interesting is jesus the
[1:14:26] eighth one fulfills all of them
[1:14:28] joshua jehovah's our salvation
[1:14:32] right which is interesting that would be
[1:14:33] eight right eight
[1:14:35] and there's eight steps to touch perfect
[1:14:36] man i just think that's really beautiful
[1:14:39] so see when people say the seven there's
[1:14:41] always eight
[1:14:42] job is our salvation right because what
[1:14:44] do the angels say what do we call them
[1:14:45] do we call jesus jehovah this canoe
[1:14:48] do we call him jehovah jireh what do we
[1:14:51] call we call him jehovah
[1:14:53] is our salvation call him joshua amen
[1:14:56] hallelujah
[1:14:57] call him yeshua call him jesus he'll
[1:15:00] save us from our sins amen
[1:15:03] in other words all those needs are
[1:15:05] rolled up in this if he saves us from
[1:15:06] his sin
[1:15:07] he'll do everything else amen he'll
[1:15:10] provide he'll be there he'll be our
[1:15:12] banner
[1:15:12] he'll be everything as long as he saves
[1:15:15] us from our sins amen
[1:15:17] hallelujah thank god there you go
[1:15:25] i've never preached a sermon on the
[1:15:26] seven compound names of jehovah till
[1:15:28] today
[1:15:29] i did it really fast now see you could
[1:15:31] take each one of those you could devote
[1:15:32] one service to each one
[1:15:34] you can show all the times jehovah
[1:15:35] provided and then start with that first
[1:15:37] one with abraham
[1:15:38] you say you see he's jehovah gyra and
[1:15:41] you see how you can do that you can just
[1:15:42] teach it right down through
[1:15:44] but i just thought i'd go through here
[1:15:45] kind of quickly okay so you can kind of
[1:15:46] see it
[1:15:47] so remember these are all the compound
[1:15:48] names with
[1:15:50] uh well i didn't get i'm sorry they're
[1:15:52] down here
[1:15:53] yeah jova sub see i never got that see
[1:15:57] there may be more than seven compound
[1:15:59] names see there could be that too
[1:16:02] okay uh so you have jehovah
[1:16:07] since we have that let's look that up
[1:16:08] real quick here
[1:16:10] uh let me turn there back to malachi i
[1:16:13] still haven't been an hour yeah i'm
[1:16:14] gonna try to do about an hour here
[1:16:16] lord willing sorry
[1:16:21] let's look up that reference thank you
[1:16:23] for your patience
[1:16:29] anybody's got a scofield bible can beat
[1:16:30] me there let me know
[1:16:32] okay it's first samuel 1 3 first samuel
[1:16:34] 1 3.
[1:16:39] don't ever feel bad about you know we're
[1:16:41] searching through the bible i've heard
[1:16:42] so many tapes of brother branham where
[1:16:43] he's searching through the bible
[1:16:44] women read scriptures he has wife read
[1:16:47] scriptures he had little kids read
[1:16:48] scriptures
[1:16:49] you know when you're just teaching going
[1:16:50] through it slowly sometimes the holy
[1:16:52] spirit will bring a thought to you gotta
[1:16:53] look it up
[1:16:54] so don't ever feel bad about that
[1:16:58] all right oh yes this is the lord of
[1:17:02] hosts
[1:17:02] all right this is jehovah's sabbath
[1:17:07] first samuel 1 3 and this man went up
[1:17:10] out of the city
[1:17:11] yearly to worship and to sacrifice unto
[1:17:14] the lord of hosts
[1:17:16] in shiloh that's jehovah shabbat
[1:17:19] the lord of armies amen
[1:17:22] hallelujah the jehovah of armies the
[1:17:25] self-existent one who
[1:17:27] leads armies like the captain of the
[1:17:29] lord's host
[1:17:30] and the two sons of eli hofney and
[1:17:32] phineas the priest of the lord were
[1:17:33] there
[1:17:34] the priests of jehovah were there now
[1:17:35] those are the ones we mentioned this
[1:17:37] morning
[1:17:38] they took of god's right just like ache
[1:17:40] and took of god's
[1:17:42] spoils these two took of god sacrificed
[1:17:44] the the fat of the sacrifices and the
[1:17:47] all three died these two and achan died
[1:17:50] because they took something that
[1:17:51] belonged to god
[1:17:54] all right
[1:17:57] so there you go there's at least nine
[1:17:58] right there there's at least nine
[1:17:59] jehovah's
[1:18:00] okay there could be more and i think you
[1:18:03] know honestly as i think about this
[1:18:04] i think that's maybe one reason i never
[1:18:06] preached on the seven compound names of
[1:18:08] jehovah because i looked in the
[1:18:09] scripture and i saw more now i'm
[1:18:12] i'm talking from like 10 years ago here
[1:18:14] so i'm trying to remember from 10 years
[1:18:16] ago but
[1:18:16] that's probably why i never preach it
[1:18:18] because as i started studying i found
[1:18:19] more and more jehovah
[1:18:21] names now this is kind of coming back to
[1:18:23] me right now so just
[1:18:25] uh just bear with me on that one okay
[1:18:26] let me try to bring this down to close
[1:18:28] here
[1:18:30] yeah okay so we went through that the
[1:18:32] seven compound names
[1:18:34] of the lord god jehovah elohim okay now
[1:18:36] let's go back to uh
[1:18:37] zeke i'm sorry exodus now is exodus 3.
[1:18:40] let's go back here
[1:18:42] now you actually don't have to turn
[1:18:43] there let's just so the word
[1:18:45] i am just means hey yah which means to
[1:18:48] exist or to become
[1:18:49] this is used almost 4 000 times in the
[1:18:52] bible
[1:18:52] because it just means to become to exist
[1:18:56] like if there was a scripture that said
[1:18:57] uh this man became the wife of that man
[1:19:01] or whatever you know or that woman
[1:19:02] rather
[1:19:03] whatever they became this it became that
[1:19:05] that's the word hayah
[1:19:06] so it's a very common word this is i am
[1:19:09] so god tells moses tell them
[1:19:11] i am that i am sent you
[1:19:15] right the one that is existing
[1:19:19] the existing one that's existing that's
[1:19:22] been existing right
[1:19:23] i am that i am sent me the existing one
[1:19:27] the becoming one right the one who's
[1:19:30] revealing himself
[1:19:31] now here's the actual scriptures again
[1:19:33] now i just want to bring this out just
[1:19:35] we already read it but
[1:19:36] this is my name forever right i just
[1:19:39] want to bring that out
[1:19:40] this is my name forever now look what he
[1:19:41] says but god said unto moses so this is
[1:19:44] elohim
[1:19:45] right elohim the strong one said to
[1:19:48] moses
[1:19:48] thou shalt thou say the church of israel
[1:19:50] the lord god so jehovah elohim
[1:19:53] tell them the self-existent strong one
[1:19:55] of your fathers
[1:19:57] the strong one of abraham the strong one
[1:19:59] of isaac and the strong one of jacob
[1:20:02] isn't that awesome because abraham isaac
[1:20:04] jacob we all can look at their lives and
[1:20:06] see how weak they were
[1:20:09] we could all see how many mistakes they
[1:20:10] made but god said tell them
[1:20:13] the strong one of abraham in other words
[1:20:16] the one who led abraham and gave him
[1:20:19] seed when he had no one
[1:20:21] the one that changed his body praise god
[1:20:25] i'm the god of i'm the elohim of abraham
[1:20:28] i'm the elohim of isaac isaac planted
[1:20:31] seeds
[1:20:32] in the wilderness and the bible said
[1:20:33] they should not have brought forth but
[1:20:35] they brought forth a hundredfold
[1:20:38] in the wilderness see wherever god is he
[1:20:41] just does supernatural things amen
[1:20:43] amen see now look he chose not to go
[1:20:46] down to egypt
[1:20:47] he said i'm going to plant here anyway
[1:20:48] in the famine i'm going to plant here
[1:20:50] and god gave him a hundredfold return
[1:20:54] god would have did that first daddy if
[1:20:55] you'd have stayed in the promised land
[1:20:58] praise god in other words keep god's
[1:21:00] word at all costs
[1:21:02] amen let them tease you let them make
[1:21:05] fun of you
[1:21:06] let them speak evil things you just obey
[1:21:08] god's word
[1:21:09] god is going to show up in a
[1:21:11] supernatural way
[1:21:14] isaac could have said well my dad went
[1:21:16] down i guess he's the father of faith
[1:21:17] i'll leave the promised land too i'll go
[1:21:19] down to egypt but no he had faith
[1:21:22] he had confidence if god bless abra if
[1:21:25] god blessed my dad
[1:21:27] i'm going to take a stand on god's word
[1:21:28] i'm going to stay right here i'm not
[1:21:30] going to repeat those mistakes
[1:21:33] and god blessed him that's what we got
[1:21:36] to do
[1:21:36] we got to not we have to learn from the
[1:21:38] mistakes from our past and then watch
[1:21:40] god do great things in our life
[1:21:42] praise god amen
[1:21:46] he said tell them i'm the elohim of
[1:21:47] isaac i'm the elohim
[1:21:50] of jacob has set me
[1:21:53] unto you tell the strong one
[1:21:56] this is my name forever lord god
[1:21:59] right the self-existent strong this will
[1:22:02] always be my name
[1:22:03] i'm the ex-existing one i exist by
[1:22:06] myself
[1:22:06] with my own power and i'm strong
[1:22:10] remind them tell them i am that i am
[1:22:12] that
[1:22:14] i am that strong one i am that jehovah
[1:22:17] the strong one
[1:22:18] the self-existent one see
[1:22:22] he says i am has sent me to you because
[1:22:24] god had previously said i am that i am
[1:22:26] that's got a little bit of repeat there
[1:22:28] this is a repeat i think as well tell
[1:22:31] him the jehovah
[1:22:32] elohim has sent you the self-existing
[1:22:35] strong one
[1:22:37] but look church he could prove it right
[1:22:39] god gives us all signs to prove that
[1:22:41] he's with us he could pull his hand
[1:22:42] up in bring out leprosy pull it out and
[1:22:46] made whole again
[1:22:47] see god if god sends you he's gonna give
[1:22:49] you signs
[1:22:51] he could throw down the stick and turn
[1:22:52] the serpent pick it up come back to his
[1:22:54] staff
[1:22:55] right so not only did he have the word
[1:22:58] but he had signs miracles and wonders
[1:23:00] amen
[1:23:01] that's why i love brother ryan no matter
[1:23:02] what they said about him he could stand
[1:23:04] there and tell them their address
[1:23:06] tell them what's wrong with them and say
[1:23:07] that's thus saith the lord amen
[1:23:10] he had those gifts like moses right yet
[1:23:12] he said that angel said as moses was
[1:23:14] given two gifts
[1:23:15] you'll be given two gifts he said if you
[1:23:18] can just get the people to believe the
[1:23:20] word amen
[1:23:22] the word my what a what a parallel it is
[1:23:25] right moses and brother branham
[1:23:28] hallelujah the gifts and getting the
[1:23:29] people to believe
[1:23:31] praise god
[1:23:34] now i got a few minutes here i have nine
[1:23:36] minutes until my hour
[1:23:37] so i'll try to finish up here now of
[1:23:40] course i couldn't get to everything in
[1:23:41] the old testament like i said there's
[1:23:43] there's sermons and sermons and sermons
[1:23:44] on the names of god
[1:23:46] but we just know the greatest name today
[1:23:49] is the lord jesus christ
[1:23:50] amen right we know that that's the name
[1:23:53] uh
[1:23:53] we breathe out because the bible said
[1:23:56] let
[1:23:56] all the house of israel know so all
[1:23:59] these jehovah worshipers all these
[1:24:00] yahweh this that's a real sacred name
[1:24:02] now
[1:24:03] all these sacred yahweh worshipers let
[1:24:05] them know
[1:24:06] god elohim has made this jesus
[1:24:10] god has made this joshua whom you
[1:24:12] crucified
[1:24:13] both lord and christ
[1:24:17] because jesus joshua's just a common
[1:24:19] name how many joshua's do you know
[1:24:21] i'm a schoolteacher there's a joshua in
[1:24:23] almost every class
[1:24:25] it's a common name because it's a great
[1:24:26] name right that's the english name of
[1:24:30] yeshua
[1:24:31] right so joshua's of jesus is a very
[1:24:35] common name
[1:24:37] so peter had the keys he said you got to
[1:24:40] recognize this is more than just a man
[1:24:43] he was crucified but god raised him from
[1:24:45] the dead
[1:24:47] he is both lord and christ
[1:24:51] he is joshua he is jehovah's our
[1:24:54] salvation
[1:24:55] but he's more than that there you go
[1:24:58] glory so scofield remember now scofield
[1:25:02] says
[1:25:02] the word jesus is the greek form of the
[1:25:05] hebrew name
[1:25:06] jeshua yeshua okay so we're actually
[1:25:10] saying the greek
[1:25:11] word joshua when we say jesus that's
[1:25:13] actually a greek word
[1:25:14] we're actually saying the greek word
[1:25:16] like the word trinity in the greek i
[1:25:17] think it's trinitas if i'm not mistaken
[1:25:19] or is that latin help me out latin
[1:25:21] people
[1:25:23] is it trinitas or
[1:25:26] you guys remember
[1:25:31] okay yeah
[1:25:35] i appreciate that yeah i just read the
[1:25:36] chapter this week that's why i was fresh
[1:25:38] on my mind
[1:25:39] so instead of we're saying the word
[1:25:40] trinity if we were just saying the the
[1:25:42] word we just say trinitas
[1:25:44] the holy trinitized that's what we'd say
[1:25:46] but that's kind of what we're doing for
[1:25:48] greek
[1:25:48] of course we know it's unholy trinity
[1:25:50] right you know i'm not trying to support
[1:25:52] the trinity
[1:25:53] it's of the devil thus saith the lord so
[1:25:54] i'm not trying to
[1:25:56] don't ever think i'd say that uh but
[1:25:58] jesus is like saying the greek is
[1:26:00] actually the actual greek word jesus
[1:26:03] okay now here's what i want to get to
[1:26:05] the word
[1:26:06] lord he said jesus this joshua is both
[1:26:09] lord
[1:26:10] and christ lord is curios
[1:26:13] which the is the greek word for lord or
[1:26:15] master
[1:26:16] and some scholars say that's the same
[1:26:19] word they use for adonai in the greek
[1:26:22] so they said let israel know this jesus
[1:26:25] is actually adonai
[1:26:27] hallelujah amen the same one that they
[1:26:31] recognize
[1:26:31] abraham said adonai he's the master amen
[1:26:36] he's the lord jesus is the master amen
[1:26:39] he's your master from the old testament
[1:26:41] that's what the holy spirit told brother
[1:26:42] adam jesus in the new testament is
[1:26:44] jehovah of the old amen
[1:26:48] hallelujah i'm having a good old time
[1:26:49] today raise that
[1:26:53] he said let him know he's both curios
[1:26:56] adonai
[1:26:58] and he's christ now christ means
[1:27:01] christos in the greek
[1:27:03] which means the anointed
[1:27:06] let them know this is the anointed
[1:27:09] adonai
[1:27:11] this is the anointed joshua i don't know
[1:27:13] i guess i'm trying to put them all
[1:27:14] together
[1:27:15] it's the uh adonai who's anointed he's
[1:27:18] our joshua
[1:27:19] and this is equal in the hebrew to
[1:27:21] messiah because messiah means the
[1:27:23] anointed one
[1:27:24] so christ and messiah mean the same
[1:27:26] thing
[1:27:27] okay so he's not just joshua he's the
[1:27:31] anointed one
[1:27:32] to come who's adonai as well
[1:27:35] oh how many can say amen to that see
[1:27:37] that
[1:27:38] no he's more than joshua he's more than
[1:27:40] just jesus
[1:27:41] right he is adonai he's master of the
[1:27:44] universe amen
[1:27:46] he's the master of heaven and earth
[1:27:47] praise god come down
[1:27:49] the word was made flesh among us
[1:27:52] and he's the anointed messiah that was
[1:27:54] to come
[1:27:56] and the bible said he's far above all
[1:27:58] principality power might
[1:27:59] and dominion every name that is named
[1:28:02] not only in this world
[1:28:03] but also in that which is to come church
[1:28:05] anytime you're in you're in need
[1:28:07] call upon the name of the lord jesus
[1:28:08] christ
[1:28:10] call upon that holy name this name is
[1:28:12] far above
[1:28:14] all other names right because you got
[1:28:16] jehovah in there jesus means jehovah
[1:28:18] you got jehovah adonai right you got the
[1:28:21] anointed messiah the anointing he's got
[1:28:23] the anointing praise god
[1:28:25] he's got the power he's got the holy
[1:28:27] spirit praise god amen
[1:28:30] call on this name for it's far above any
[1:28:33] other name
[1:28:35] we could say 9-1-1 call me up please
[1:28:37] come please
[1:28:38] please club but it's better to call on
[1:28:40] jesus right
[1:28:41] i mean we thank god for the 9-1-1 but
[1:28:44] what i'm saying is
[1:28:45] this is the name that's far above all of
[1:28:48] them this is the first name we should
[1:28:49] breathe
[1:28:50] this is the first power this is the
[1:28:52] first authority we should go to
[1:28:54] is the name of the lord jesus christ
[1:28:57] wherefore god has also highly exalted
[1:28:59] him and given him a name which is above
[1:29:02] every name the anointed adonai
[1:29:06] master jehovah's our salvation
[1:29:10] self-existent one who's constantly
[1:29:12] revealing self
[1:29:13] for salvation that's the lord jesus
[1:29:15] christ
[1:29:17] that at the name of jesus joshua
[1:29:20] every knee shall bow jehovah is our
[1:29:22] salvation
[1:29:23] of things in heaven things on earth and
[1:29:26] things under the earth
[1:29:30] now here's what i want to close i just
[1:29:31] want to close with this a few thoughts
[1:29:32] here
[1:29:34] this is why it's so important
[1:29:38] a few weeks ago i was kind of praying
[1:29:40] and uh and i was just confessing what
[1:29:42] god
[1:29:43] said about me about you in the bible
[1:29:47] right
[1:29:47] i was just in prayer and it really
[1:29:49] encouraged me for a number of days
[1:29:51] i've been encouraged since then so i
[1:29:52] haven't had to do that you know but just
[1:29:54] praying for other people and things
[1:29:57] but i just started i heard this sermon
[1:29:58] about that i was like wow the ims
[1:30:02] what am i i know what god is now what am
[1:30:05] i
[1:30:06] praise god but jesus said verily
[1:30:09] everlasting to you before abraham was
[1:30:11] i am this is why they picked up stones
[1:30:15] to stone them
[1:30:16] because he's saying this man is saying
[1:30:18] he's jehovah
[1:30:20] this man is saying he's the lord god
[1:30:22] that met abra or that met moses
[1:30:25] he's making himself equal with god and
[1:30:28] jesus never apologized it
[1:30:30] and church he never even explained it
[1:30:33] he said if you can't believe me believe
[1:30:35] the works amen
[1:30:38] hallelujah he didn't explain he didn't
[1:30:39] have a lesson on well here let me teach
[1:30:40] you hebrew
[1:30:42] he didn't go through that he said look
[1:30:43] at the works he said no they said no man
[1:30:45] can do this
[1:30:46] except god except elohim the strong one
[1:30:49] be with him amen
[1:30:51] he said before abraham was i am
[1:30:58] now here i like this too see so
[1:31:00] constantly brother branson it was kind
[1:31:01] of like
[1:31:02] a dual personality he said sometimes
[1:31:04] jesus flesh would speak
[1:31:05] other times god would speak right
[1:31:09] philip said to him lord show us the
[1:31:11] father and it's the fight that says in
[1:31:13] other words show us elohim
[1:31:15] right show us god show us adonai show us
[1:31:16] jehovah and jesus said have i
[1:31:19] been so long time with you and yet thou
[1:31:22] has not known me philip
[1:31:24] look at that he said show us the father
[1:31:26] he said i've been here this whole time
[1:31:28] see because the father was made flesh
[1:31:31] right
[1:31:32] adonai was made flesh jehovah was made
[1:31:35] flesh
[1:31:36] elohim was made flesh he says i've been
[1:31:39] here
[1:31:39] you haven't even seen me
[1:31:44] he that has seen me has seen the father
[1:31:47] and how sayest thou then show us the
[1:31:50] father
[1:31:51] i love how jesus when he's asked
[1:31:52] questions he'll often ask them a
[1:31:53] question
[1:31:55] right he'll bring it back what do you
[1:31:57] say what are your thoughts let me ask
[1:31:59] you this
[1:32:01] he's constantly trying to get them to
[1:32:02] think and understand what are they
[1:32:04] really trying to say
[1:32:05] he said believe us thou not that i am in
[1:32:07] the father the father and me the words
[1:32:09] that i speak unto you i speak not of
[1:32:10] myself
[1:32:11] but the father that dwelt in me he do
[1:32:13] with the works
[1:32:15] now lord willing i'm going to preach on
[1:32:17] the god head pretty soon but remember
[1:32:18] this is what they they're so
[1:32:20] trinitarians are so dogmatic this is
[1:32:22] what they believe they believe two
[1:32:23] separate persons live in one person
[1:32:27] because jesus said the father dwelt in
[1:32:28] me but the bible said the spirit abode
[1:32:31] in him
[1:32:32] they believe two gods live in one god
[1:32:37] if jesus is fully god why does he need
[1:32:39] another god to come live in him
[1:32:41] and the church said why if he's fully
[1:32:45] god why is he the father
[1:32:47] he shouldn't he should be god right
[1:32:52] but they there's my hour so i'll try to
[1:32:54] close here in a moment but see they get
[1:32:55] so confused and they can't explain it
[1:32:57] they just say well that's what we
[1:32:59] believe that's what the giants of the
[1:33:00] faith taught the giants of the faith
[1:33:02] wrote the bible praise god
[1:33:04] and the giants of the faith never caught
[1:33:06] in three gods or three verses
[1:33:07] he said jesus christ is the invisible
[1:33:10] image of the person of god amen
[1:33:13] he is adonai made flesh amen he's the
[1:33:16] image of jehovah he's the image of
[1:33:18] elohim
[1:33:19] made flesh he said have i been this time
[1:33:21] i've been here three and a half years
[1:33:22] and you haven't seen the father
[1:33:25] i love how he humbles everybody humble
[1:33:28] me lord humble me
[1:33:31] the father the dwelleth in me he do with
[1:33:33] the works
[1:33:34] church if god if god comes in our
[1:33:36] generation this is going to be fighting
[1:33:37] words
[1:33:38] they're going to want to kill us when we
[1:33:40] say trinitarians of the devil do you
[1:33:42] understand
[1:33:43] they're not killing they're not really
[1:33:44] upset yet but if we if god comes in our
[1:33:46] day they're going to get upset
[1:33:48] and they're going to kill us but jesus
[1:33:50] said because you kept the word of my
[1:33:51] patience i'm going to keep you from the
[1:33:53] hour
[1:33:54] of temptation that cometh upon the whole
[1:33:55] world
[1:33:57] these are going to become fighting words
[1:33:58] pretty soon oh you're a trinitarian
[1:34:01] you're a charlatan you're i'm sure
[1:34:03] you're not a trinitarian you're a
[1:34:04] charleston you're a heathen
[1:34:05] you're a you're a heretic let them call
[1:34:07] them whatever they want just like i read
[1:34:09] this morning
[1:34:09] paul's right paul said i i'm not they
[1:34:12] can't prove what they're accusing me he
[1:34:13] said
[1:34:14] but this one thing the way that they
[1:34:16] call heresy
[1:34:17] so i worship the god of our fathers
[1:34:19] believing everything
[1:34:20] that is written in the prophets amen i
[1:34:23] believe this whole book
[1:34:24] from cover to cover and it never says
[1:34:26] he's three persons he's one person amen
[1:34:29] yeah that's right i do worship by the
[1:34:30] way they call heresy but really it's
[1:34:32] orthodoxy
[1:34:34] praise god we're really the real
[1:34:36] orthodox christians
[1:34:38] because we just keep all the word of god
[1:34:42] but if this happens in our day if this
[1:34:43] move of hating jews keeps going like
[1:34:45] it's going
[1:34:47] and this move to worship uh
[1:34:51] this move to worship homosexuality and
[1:34:54] and all these things if this keep moving
[1:34:55] they're gonna hate us pretty soon
[1:34:57] if it happens in our day what do we got
[1:35:00] to do we got to pray for those who
[1:35:01] persecute us
[1:35:03] right bless those who persecute us pray
[1:35:05] for those who despitefully use us
[1:35:07] we have to be trained for that right now
[1:35:10] i'll tell you
[1:35:10] youtube has trained me for that because
[1:35:12] every week i get criticized and
[1:35:14] so you need to stop preaching and you
[1:35:16] need to sit down who are you to correct
[1:35:17] william branham i'm like i'm not
[1:35:18] corrected with you brandon it's the holy
[1:35:20] spirit corrected william branham
[1:35:22] william branham's he's a prophet of god
[1:35:24] but he was a man
[1:35:25] and when he makes mistakes if the holy
[1:35:26] spirit's here he's going to correct the
[1:35:28] mistake
[1:35:29] it ain't me it's the holy spirit praise
[1:35:31] god but if you want to worship the tapes
[1:35:34] go ahead you can worship the teeth you
[1:35:35] shouldn't
[1:35:37] you shouldn't worship the tapes you
[1:35:38] should listen to tapes not worship them
[1:35:41] my
[1:35:42] mercy i was just trying to think of some
[1:35:46] of the things they called me this week
[1:35:49] the lowest human on the earth and you're
[1:35:51] going to be preaching i mean
[1:35:52] all kinds of things sit down and shut up
[1:35:54] they told me all kinds of things
[1:35:56] that just makes you want to preach
[1:35:57] harder they're just stirring me up to
[1:36:00] preach harder against it
[1:36:02] to blast all that oh yeah and if you
[1:36:03] don't know i got a video i shared with
[1:36:05] william
[1:36:06] and i shared with jose i got a video of
[1:36:08] of the actual auto recordings of billy
[1:36:10] paul and joseph
[1:36:11] sharing their false doctrine it's not
[1:36:14] public but it's
[1:36:15] it's available with the link so if you
[1:36:18] want to hear some of the things they say
[1:36:19] i took me three hours to i did two
[1:36:21] saturdays ago it took me three hours to
[1:36:23] get that thing done
[1:36:24] to go research it put it all in there
[1:36:26] line up all the audio
[1:36:28] that was hopefully that was three hours
[1:36:29] well worth it if that just posed one
[1:36:32] person out of idolatry
[1:36:33] that three hours was a huge blessing
[1:36:35] because i've already had people tell me
[1:36:36] oh this is a blessing thank you but it's
[1:36:38] not public right
[1:36:39] it won't be on there on your scroll list
[1:36:41] on youtube right won't come up there
[1:36:42] but you have to reach it by us a special
[1:36:45] link
[1:36:50] okay
[1:36:52] now let's just go through this let's
[1:36:56] give me five minutes here let me set
[1:36:57] that should it take me five minutes
[1:37:01] my wife's laughing there
[1:37:04] okay give me ten
[1:37:07] now look i am church i am what the i am
[1:37:11] says i
[1:37:11] am because jesus christ is the i am
[1:37:15] made flesh if he says something i am
[1:37:19] that's what i am
[1:37:21] but the first and most important thing
[1:37:23] is i am nothing
[1:37:25] without the i am that's the most
[1:37:28] important thing
[1:37:29] if we catch nothing else tonight catch
[1:37:32] that
[1:37:32] we are nothing unless the i am has mercy
[1:37:34] on us
[1:37:38] i think that's my last slide yeah that
[1:37:39] is my last slide so i'll keep that up
[1:37:41] there
[1:37:42] um so i didn't have time like i said i
[1:37:43] didn't have as much time as i wanted to
[1:37:44] go through this but that's okay i
[1:37:45] i hope you guys try to give you the bulk
[1:37:47] of the message like the main thought
[1:37:49] so here's what i was praying lately
[1:37:52] i am nothing
[1:37:56] without jesus christ working through me
[1:37:59] as is written in
[1:38:00] john 15 verse 5.
[1:38:04] so that means i am only doing good
[1:38:07] things if christ is working through me
[1:38:10] i am a blessing only if i yield to the i
[1:38:13] am
[1:38:15] everything else no matter how much money
[1:38:16] how much property how many buildings i
[1:38:18] could build or whatever
[1:38:19] how many awards i could earn that's
[1:38:21] nothing unless christ is with me
[1:38:24] now let me go through a few of these
[1:38:25] here i got three minutes left
[1:38:29] i am blessed with all spiritual
[1:38:31] blessings
[1:38:33] as is written in ephesians 1 verse 4.
[1:38:37] i am you are because the i am said so
[1:38:42] and if he says it it's going to come to
[1:38:44] pass
[1:38:46] i am our i am a partaker of his divine
[1:38:48] nature
[1:38:50] i am a partaker of faith virtue
[1:38:51] knowledge
[1:38:53] temperance patience goddess brother
[1:38:54] kindness charity i am a partaker of all
[1:38:56] those
[1:38:58] i am because the i am said i am
[1:39:03] i am beloved because in romans 9
[1:39:07] god said i'm going to take up people
[1:39:08] gentiles that were not beloved
[1:39:10] and i shall call them beloved hallelujah
[1:39:13] that makes me want to cry amen
[1:39:14] hallelujah
[1:39:17] i am beloved well amen somebody loves me
[1:39:21] i know you do buddy but somebody greater
[1:39:23] than you loves me i know everybody loves
[1:39:26] me here i love you too
[1:39:27] but what i'm saying is that i'm loved by
[1:39:29] the i am
[1:39:32] i'm greatly loved by the i am
[1:39:37] ephesians 2 says i am love with great
[1:39:40] love
[1:39:41] the bible says with his great love he
[1:39:43] has loved us
[1:39:44] amen i am greatly loved sister amen
[1:39:48] brother i am greatly loved i am
[1:39:50] quickened
[1:39:51] by the holy ghost amen because the bible
[1:39:54] says i am
[1:39:58] i am loved by christ because he gave his
[1:40:00] life for me on the cross
[1:40:04] i am inseparable from the love of god
[1:40:08] according to romans chapter 8. 10
[1:40:12] things cannot separate me from the love
[1:40:14] of god
[1:40:15] amen see all that beloved thing i was
[1:40:18] telling you about
[1:40:18] see there's 10 things that can't no none
[1:40:21] of those 10 things can separate me
[1:40:22] because i'm so beloved
[1:40:25] and church i ain't bragging i'm just
[1:40:26] being rejoicing here tonight you ought
[1:40:28] to be rejoicing too
[1:40:29] right you are god's beloved amen and
[1:40:32] nothing
[1:40:33] can separate you from his love
[1:40:38] i am favored by god because my enemies
[1:40:41] don't triumph over me
[1:40:43] as is written in psalm 41
[1:40:47] i am more than a conqueror in christ
[1:40:49] according to romans chapter 8
[1:40:53] i am a secret prayer warrior who
[1:40:55] secretly fast gives alms
[1:40:58] and secretly prays because that's what
