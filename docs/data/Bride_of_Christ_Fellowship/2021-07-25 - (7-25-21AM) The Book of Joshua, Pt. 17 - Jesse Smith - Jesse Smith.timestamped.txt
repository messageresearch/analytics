[0:21] grace of god i'd like to continue on
[0:22] this thought there's just been some
[0:25] just some beautiful thoughts as i've
[0:26] read through these chapters i've
[0:27] listened to different sermons about it
[0:29] as well
[0:30] and just looking forward to getting to
[0:31] some of these thoughts
[0:33] i think they'll be a real help to you a
[0:34] real blessing to you
[0:37] today we'll look at uh joshua as he
[0:41] goes to the northern part of
[0:45] canaan's land there to get these great
[0:46] victories joshua 11
[0:48] verses 4 5 and 6.
[1:02] i trust you're seeing yourself as joshua
[1:05] as the invincible army possessing the
[1:07] promised land praise god
[1:09] i trust you're seeing yourself is that
[1:10] i'm seeing myself as that
[1:12] and i want to uh glorify god and in
[1:15] every trial
[1:16] i want to uh overcome by the word of god
[1:19] and the blood of jesus christ right the
[1:21] word of our testimony
[1:22] and we just want to see ourselves as
[1:23] soldiers taking this ground you know we
[1:25] don't have to
[1:26] we don't have to take the whole ground
[1:27] praise god right we have to we don't we
[1:29] don't we don't have to do everything in
[1:30] the world right meet every need but we
[1:32] do have to possess
[1:33] our ground praise god what god has put
[1:36] us
[1:36] under responsibility for we want to see
[1:39] what has god made me responsible for
[1:41] and then lord help me to possess the
[1:44] promises
[1:44] help me to be faithful right in
[1:47] establishing
[1:48] what you want to establish in my life
[1:50] praise god
[1:52] so joshua 11. now i'll read uh
[1:56] i'll let me read 4 5 6 and then we'll
[1:58] read 15 together
[1:59] the main thought about this chapter is
[2:01] joshua left nothing undone
[2:05] you'll see church though that the other
[2:07] one the other israelites
[2:08] they did some they had some things they
[2:11] left undone
[2:12] but joshua didn't joshua himself was
[2:15] faithful in all that the word asked him
[2:18] to do
[2:19] praise god and that's how we want to be
[2:20] we want to be the joshua
[2:22] where we're faithful in everything we
[2:24] didn't leave anything undone
[2:26] right we didn't let anything linger in
[2:27] the past and we didn't we didn't leave
[2:29] anything unconfessed
[2:30] no no we took care of everything
[2:32] everything's under the blood praise god
[2:35] christ has conquered everything in my
[2:37] life praise god
[2:39] joshua 11 here let me read 4 5 6
[2:42] and they went out they and all their
[2:43] hosts with them much people even as a
[2:45] sand that is upon the seashore
[2:47] in multitude with horses and chariots
[2:49] very many and when all the kings were
[2:51] met together they came and pitched
[2:52] together at the waters of
[2:54] maram which means high place the waters
[2:57] of the high place
[3:00] to fight against israel
[3:03] and the lord said unto joshua that's
[3:05] jehovah see that capital l-o-r-d
[3:07] that's the self-existent one who reveals
[3:09] himself and the self-existent one who
[3:12] reveals himself said unto joshua
[3:14] be not afraid because of them
[3:20] for tomorrow about this time will i
[3:22] deliver them up all slain before
[3:24] israel thou shalt hoe their horses
[3:27] and burn their chariots with fire
[3:32] okay now go down to verse 15 let's read
[3:34] 15 together because this is how
[3:36] this is how the the writer describes
[3:38] joshua's
[3:39] ministry let's read verse 15 together
[3:41] ready one two
[3:42] three as the lord commanded moses his
[3:45] servant
[3:46] so did moses command joshua and so did
[3:50] joshua he left nothing undone of
[3:54] all that the lord commanded moses amen
[3:57] now we're not done let's go to jeremiah
[3:58] 29 we want to read our memory verse from
[3:59] sister hua
[4:00] beautiful beautiful verses here jeremiah
[4:03] 29 11.
[4:04] it's good to see you by the mj this
[4:05] morning appreciate you pressing out to
[4:06] the house of god
[4:07] brother and i shared your thanks to
[4:09] brother bang as well so god bless you
[4:11] sir
[4:13] good to see you brother god bless you
[4:14] jeremiah 29
[4:17] 11 12 and 13. thank god that he has
[4:21] good thoughts toward us praise god
[4:24] church if not if not god would be
[4:26] hardening your heart towards the gospel
[4:28] maybe we'll get to that later this
[4:29] morning but if your heart is tender
[4:32] towards jesus christ you and i ought to
[4:34] be the happiest people in this earth
[4:36] because remember pharaoh and other all
[4:38] these other ones he always hardened
[4:39] their heart against god
[4:41] god heart of their own hearts because he
[4:42] knew that they wanted hard hearts
[4:44] he knew they wouldn't obey moses right
[4:47] he knew pharaoh wouldn't or submit to
[4:49] moses so he had to harden his heart
[4:51] so that god could get glory in those
[4:53] hard-hearted people
[4:55] right god hardens the hearts of those
[4:58] that
[4:58] deny the word of god but he softens the
[5:01] hearts of all those that love the word
[5:03] of god
[5:03] i'm thankful for a soft heart today
[5:05] church i'm thankful that god can still
[5:07] speak to me god changed my heart
[5:09] there's anything wrong against you god i
[5:11] want to obey all of it
[5:12] i'm not going to be like pharaoh and
[5:13] fight against it i'm not going to fight
[5:15] against it i just want all your grace i
[5:17] just want to obey all your commands lord
[5:19] keep me tender to the holy spirit
[5:22] i don't want to resist him i want to
[5:23] welcome him praise god
[5:25] i want to let him flow through my life
[5:28] it's a beautiful thought man this this
[5:30] bible it just keeps opening like
[5:31] we're talking about william last week it
[5:33] just keeps opening all the time it's
[5:35] just
[5:35] it's so much more beautiful and clear
[5:37] all the time
[5:38] verse 11 let's read 11 12 and 13 1 2
[5:41] 3 for i know the thoughts that i think
[5:44] toward you
[5:45] saith the lord thoughts of peace and not
[5:48] of
[5:48] evil to give you an expected end
[5:52] then shall ye call upon me and ye shall
[5:55] go
[5:55] and pray unto me and i will hearken unto
[5:59] you
[5:59] and ye shall seek me and find me when ye
[6:03] shall search for me
[6:04] with all your heart praise god look at
[6:06] 14 though and i'll be found of you save
[6:08] the lord how many want to find the lord
[6:10] amen see church he's always near to us
[6:13] right but there's times he hides himself
[6:14] because he wants you to seek after him
[6:17] he could just come out and solve all
[6:18] your problems right
[6:20] but sometimes he'll hide himself because
[6:21] he wants to feel that you love him
[6:24] and he wants to feel that right he wants
[6:25] to feel you he wants you to be an
[6:27] overcomer
[6:29] he wants you to be more than a conqueror
[6:30] he wants to see you take the faith that
[6:32] you have in your heart
[6:33] and use it and glorify him and seek
[6:36] after him and surely he'll be found of
[6:38] you
[6:38] that's our head's here one more time
[6:40] let's have a word of prayer heavenly

[7:21] being seated praise god
[7:26] just trusting the holy spirit to speak
[7:28] to us today
[7:29] and uh minister all of our needs
[7:34] i have a few slides i don't have a whole
[7:35] lot um
[7:38] but i just got a few let's look at this
[7:40] stuff you can switch over
[7:41] uh joshua left nothing undone
[7:45] and in church as i've read through this
[7:47] and uh listened to different sermons and
[7:48] studied a little
[7:49] gone through commentaries and and trying
[7:51] to read and understand this chapter
[7:54] it becomes more real to us that we
[7:58] are in the same uh situation as joshua
[8:01] except in a spiritual light praise god
[8:04] we're not trying to
[8:05] i'm not trying to defeat anybody so i
[8:07] can have my home in doyle's town
[8:09] at least not yet right we don't know
[8:11] what the speech is going to be like
[8:13] we don't know i mean there's wars and
[8:16] hopefully we never have to do anything
[8:17] like that but our
[8:19] battle is a spiritual battle and we are
[8:22] driving out
[8:23] spiritual wickedness in high places
[8:25] there it is high places the waters of
[8:27] moher
[8:28] that's what it means high places and so
[8:30] it's it's never been more clear to me
[8:32] and hopefully you
[8:34] that we are going to be facing uh
[8:36] enemies
[8:37] without and within right but but each
[8:40] time it's a spiritual enemy
[8:42] and each time we're given dominion over
[8:44] them and we can't let them defeat our
[8:47] faith
[8:47] we've got to use the faith and
[8:49] revelation that we have in fact
[8:50] jesus promised us the gates of hell will
[8:53] not prevail against your revelation
[8:56] as long as you have that revelation it's
[8:58] not head knowledge now
[8:59] but it's something that god has
[9:00] deposited into your soul
[9:02] amen as long as it's something deposited
[9:05] into your soul
[9:06] then the hell cannot prevail against you
[9:08] because you won't disobey god you won't
[9:10] throw god's word aside
[9:12] like adam and eve you won't come from
[9:14] out behind the protection of the word
[9:17] you'll stay behind the word the word
[9:19] will be your shield
[9:20] the word will be your protection and
[9:22] satan can't touch you
[9:23] if you're hid behind the word of god
[9:26] amen
[9:27] now we read our texts here and uh i just
[9:29] want to show there's some
[9:30] the types of this now this is in the
[9:33] book you'll see it in the book it's
[9:34] figure 11 in the book when you get it
[9:35] hopefully next week
[9:37] by god's grace i may deliver them to you
[9:39] this week i just may drive to your house
[9:41] and drop them off that's how bad i want
[9:42] to see those i've been waiting two and a
[9:45] half years for this time
[9:46] i ordered on amazon send me a copy i
[9:49] just want to see it
[9:50] uh but church this is in the book too
[9:53] there's three stages to our christian
[9:55] walk right and this is
[9:57] a reminder for most of us but the first
[9:59] thing is god justifies you by faith
[10:01] when you get saved he declares that
[10:03] you're righteous
[10:04] in other words you you repented of your
[10:06] sins you've been forgiven
[10:08] and in israel this happened when they
[10:10] exited egypt
[10:12] and crossed the waters right and so for
[10:15] us in the new testament
[10:16] we repent of our sins and we get
[10:18] baptized in the name of the lord jesus
[10:20] christ
[10:22] uh the catholic church changed the
[10:24] baptism to father son holy ghost and now
[10:27] they even sprinkle most times they don't
[10:28] even
[10:29] really baptize in in immersion in water
[10:33] but see we baptized the way the bible
[10:35] said jesus said father the name of the
[10:36] father holy ghost
[10:37] ten days later pete he opened peter's
[10:40] understanding and he baptized the name
[10:41] of jesus christ
[10:43] okay so that's what this represents so
[10:45] when we got baptized
[10:47] it's it's as if we passed through the
[10:49] red sea praise god
[10:50] and we came out dancing and shouted if
[10:53] you ever were happy it would have been
[10:55] that moment praise god right
[10:57] because you are no longer a slave in
[10:59] egypt you're a free
[11:00] son and daughter of the king amen you've
[11:03] been set free from the bondage of sin
[11:06] and now all those task masters are
[11:08] drowned in the sea
[11:10] your past is totally forgiven in the sea
[11:13] and now you're looking ahead to a new
[11:15] life
[11:16] thank god but then you know they went
[11:18] through the wilderness which represents
[11:20] our sanctification
[11:21] now this is this is in the greek it
[11:24] means you're purified in your heart and
[11:27] life
[11:28] so in other words you need your mind
[11:30] purified
[11:31] so you don't think so much evil things
[11:34] and life
[11:35] means you start obeying the word of god
[11:39] okay so first you get saved thank god
[11:41] you get saved
[11:42] but now god has to work on you through
[11:44] constant tests and trials
[11:46] to help you overcome many major sins
[11:50] okay and that that's in the bible so get
[11:51] your bible first corinthians six
[11:53] we've gone over this many times but i
[11:55] want you to see it
[11:56] first corinthians 6 9. in other words
[12:00] god is trying to get
[12:01] into your soul he's got into your mind
[12:04] and your heart you know your feelings
[12:05] your affections you repented
[12:07] you love god but he's got to sanctify
[12:10] your heart
[12:11] and your life now look at first
[12:13] corinthians 6 9.
[12:15] now he just got done talking about
[12:20] defrauding your brother and and doing
[12:22] wrong to your brethren
[12:24] and suing someone which was awful you
[12:26] know we never should sue anybody that's
[12:28] a christian right
[12:30] uh verse 9 know ye not that the
[12:32] unrighteous shall not inherit the
[12:33] kingdom of god
[12:34] remember jesus said the kingdom of god
[12:36] is within you
[12:37] right kingdom means rule or dominion the
[12:40] rule of the holy ghost jesus says
[12:42] should be within you so see these
[12:46] these sins if people keep living in
[12:48] these sins they will not inherit the
[12:49] kingdom of god
[12:51] be not deceived verse nine neither
[12:53] fornicators so people having sex before
[12:55] marriage
[12:55] they can't be born again they can't
[12:57] enter canaan as long as they're having
[12:58] sex before marriage
[13:00] right nor idolaters as long as they're
[13:03] worshiping idol american idol or
[13:05] netflix idols or basketball idols
[13:07] football idols
[13:08] they cannot be born again nor doctors
[13:11] you know living with a second wife or a
[13:13] third wife or second husband or third
[13:15] husband
[13:15] they cannot be born again effeminate
[13:17] means having a young child
[13:19] that they abuse that's child molesters
[13:22] child molesters do are cannot be born
[13:25] again
[13:26] paul says you can't be because you're
[13:27] not purified you're not sanctified
[13:29] god won't come and live in you if you're
[13:31] allowing evil like that in your life
[13:33] that's
[13:34] the people like that belong in jail nor
[13:37] abusers of themselves with mankind
[13:39] that's homosexuality
[13:41] verse 10 nor thieves so even if people
[13:43] are stealing still
[13:45] all the time they are not born again
[13:47] it's impossible
[13:48] see if you've got god inside of you
[13:50] he'll check you and say don't take that
[13:52] that's not yours that doesn't belong to
[13:54] you
[13:55] see nor covetous
[13:58] see desiring other people's things nor
[14:01] drunkards that could be you know
[14:02] husbands and wives too right like
[14:04] the ten commandments say nor drunk or
[14:06] someone getting drunk cannot be born
[14:08] again
[14:08] because they don't want to be filled
[14:10] with the holy ghost they'd rather be
[14:11] filled with wine
[14:12] but see we want to be filled with the
[14:13] holy ghost amen we want the new wine
[14:16] praise god
[14:17] of the holy ghost god fill me with that
[14:19] praise god i'll i'll still act
[14:20] drunk though hallelujah i still act
[14:23] happy and crazy
[14:24] it might seem like crazy to the world
[14:26] but it's enthusiasm it's love for god
[14:28] it's joy unspeakable
[14:30] and full of glory and the world knows
[14:33] nothing about that praise god
[14:35] they don't know anything about that
[14:36] because they've never been washed by the
[14:38] fountain right of living waters
[14:40] see now revilers those are evil speaking
[14:43] words so when people do this reviling on
[14:45] facebook or
[14:46] uh instagram or whatever when they
[14:47] revile and tear down people
[14:50] shows they're not born again right
[14:53] nor extortioners that's making up
[14:55] schemes to make money right
[14:57] shall inherit the kingdom of god these
[14:59] people cannot be born again
[15:01] if they keep living like this verse 11
[15:04] and such were some of you
[15:06] but you are washed but you are
[15:07] sanctified you're justified
[15:09] in the name of the lord jesus and by the
[15:11] spirit of our god
[15:13] see we used to we all used to do some of
[15:16] those things
[15:17] right but god has washed us in the blood
[15:19] we've been washed we've come out of that
[15:21] we got cleaned out and now we're not
[15:22] filled with those evil sins
[15:24] we're filled with god's holiness and
[15:27] that's what makes us different in the
[15:28] new testament
[15:29] in the old testament they can met they
[15:31] they were under the blood of bulls and
[15:32] goats and there was always a remembrance
[15:34] of all their sin that's been that means
[15:36] they kept doing those sins right they
[15:38] they kept doing it unless they were
[15:39] really dedicated like joseph
[15:41] but here in the new testament the blood
[15:43] of jesus christ purges our conscience
[15:45] it makes you forget many times you were
[15:47] a sinner
[15:48] and it makes your mind fully consumed on
[15:51] the things of god
[15:53] because christ is in your soul
[15:56] okay now look at uh now here's verse 12.
[15:59] this this
[15:59] helped me quit this helped me to quit
[16:01] tobacco all things are unlocked
[16:03] i'm sorry all things are lawful for me
[16:04] but all things are not expedient or
[16:06] helpful beneficial
[16:08] all things are lawful for me but i will
[16:09] not be brought under the power of any
[16:12] so every addiction church we can point
[16:14] to this scripture and say
[16:15] these things might might be lawful they
[16:18] might be uh
[16:19] uh we might be allowed to do them by the
[16:21] american laws
[16:22] but i am more concerned about the laws
[16:25] of god amen
[16:26] i don't want the power of satan abiding
[16:29] over me
[16:30] or ruling over me i want to be under the
[16:32] power of god
[16:33] amen and that's how we must live like
[16:36] joshua
[16:37] he was he refused to be brought under
[16:39] the power
[16:40] of any of those kings he refused to pay
[16:43] tribute to them
[16:44] he refused to give honor and respect to
[16:47] them he refused that he said
[16:49] i'm a conqueror god's given me this land
[16:52] i'm not leaving anything
[16:53] undone i i'm i'm possessing everything
[16:56] god gave to me charles may that be our
[16:58] testimony
[16:59] we'll possess every promise god has
[17:01] given to us amen
[17:02] remember our blessings are spiritual
[17:05] blessings right
[17:06] the bible said you've been blessed with
[17:08] all spiritual blessings
[17:09] in christ jesus so see we're going to
[17:12] have problems
[17:13] but we got to overcome the spirits that
[17:15] are trying to pull us down
[17:19] i hope that's clear now i want to show
[17:21] another way so see the way you
[17:23] the way you get purified is god gives
[17:25] you anointing he starts with the
[17:27] anointing of faith
[17:29] and then he gives you anointing of
[17:31] virtue and then it gives you anointing
[17:32] of knowledge
[17:33] and then tempers now temperance is the
[17:35] big one that's controlling your your
[17:36] bodily passions
[17:38] so that could be like uh sexual sins uh
[17:41] it could be lust of the eyes you know
[17:43] uh all these kind of things so this is
[17:44] dealing with your body when you get that
[17:46] anointing
[17:47] boy you're really getting power now amen
[17:49] because most people fall away right they
[17:51] fall away from god because they can't
[17:53] control
[17:54] their bodily passions but then you get
[17:57] patience with god
[17:58] you get another anointing of godliness
[18:00] you keep getting more brother ramsey
[18:01] it's like a little button
[18:03] but that said when you when you get
[18:04] saved it's like a little button of god's
[18:06] anointing
[18:07] and the more you feed that the bigger it
[18:08] grows amen
[18:10] and then i'll say like this it fills up
[18:12] in your mind and it
[18:13] pours over into your soul praise god i
[18:17] mean
[18:17] and once it forced into your soul it
[18:19] never leaves it's sealed in there
[18:22] hallelujah but then you got to keep
[18:24] taking care of this every day the mind
[18:27] that's where the battle is praise god
[18:29] see then it spills over you get the
[18:31] charity you get god's love
[18:32] down in your soul no matter when trials
[18:35] come you'll eventually come back to the
[18:36] spot where i love god
[18:38] i'm a real servant of god god forgive me
[18:40] if i made a mistake here i come i come
[18:42] back to you lord
[18:42] take my whole life consume my whole life
[18:44] uh renew my mind transform my mind amen
[18:48] renew me today because i need your grace
[18:50] today
[18:53] so it's all in there hopefully they'll
[18:54] find that hopefully people will find
[18:56] that a blessing
[18:58] i just want to review that in church let
[19:01] me go back there
[19:03] when i got baptized in lord jesus christ
[19:06] i instantly i i think i share that
[19:08] testimony i could no longer cuss
[19:10] it's like it's like the coal of fire had
[19:13] been taken off the altar and put on my
[19:16] lips
[19:17] i could no longer cuss it just instantly
[19:20] and
[19:20] and soon after that i started getting
[19:21] victory of all those temptations and
[19:24] those addictions
[19:25] there's something about that name praise
[19:27] god
[19:28] hallelujah that name above all names the
[19:30] name of the lord jesus christ
[19:32] every devil has to tremble at that name
[19:35] speak that name in faith
[19:36] and watch the enemies gotta move back
[19:38] praise god they might hang around for a
[19:40] little while but just keep speaking the
[19:42] word of god
[19:43] pretty soon uh they will flee the bible
[19:45] said they have to flee
[19:47] as you resist satan resist him with the
[19:49] name of jesus
[19:53] and i put that in the book church i went
[19:54] to church after church denomination
[19:56] predomination
[19:57] i never could get the victory because
[19:58] they didn't have the name they had
[19:59] fathers and holy ghosts those are titles
[20:02] but see eventually when the name came
[20:04] then i started experiencing the
[20:06] power of god because there's authority
[20:09] in a name
[20:10] the demons couldn't be moved because
[20:11] there's no authority to move them
[20:13] oh but when i repented and got saved and
[20:15] got filled or
[20:16] i got led by the holy spirit i started
[20:19] understanding the authority
[20:21] now i've been baptized in his name now
[20:24] he calls me his own because i took on
[20:26] his name amen
[20:28] and now his authority can move out
[20:30] anything contrary
[20:32] to his spirit and it can bring in the
[20:35] anointing of god
[20:36] the character of christ and make me more
[20:38] like christ
[20:42] now i just you know i was listening to a
[20:44] sermon yesterday and i just heard this
[20:47] a reference to the scripture i didn't
[20:48] hear the whole scripture but i just want
[20:50] to share this church
[20:51] our battles are within and without
[20:55] but the main battle is within for us
[20:59] right we're not we're not battling the
[21:00] military right yet
[21:02] i don't know i don't know if it ever
[21:03] comes down to that i don't know let's
[21:05] hope not
[21:07] but most of our battles are within us
[21:10] and so it's in our minds and
[21:13] and both john and paul taught the same
[21:16] thing
[21:17] that they were wretched with they were
[21:20] wretched men
[21:21] within their own humanity within their
[21:23] flesh
[21:24] but in their souls they were more than
[21:26] conquerors in christ
[21:29] so church we're gonna we have to be
[21:30] realistic we're gonna lose some battles
[21:33] but that doesn't mean we've lost the war
[21:37] joshua lost a couple battles right but
[21:40] see god helped him redeem it praise god
[21:43] god help them come
[21:44] back and get the victory amen see we're
[21:46] gonna
[21:47] battle and just because we lose one
[21:49] doesn't mean we quit or give
[21:50] up or question things am i even saved or
[21:53] no no no
[21:54] you confess it get it under the blood
[21:56] and now go
[21:57] now run out to the battle praise god go
[22:00] don't hide out from the battle don't be
[22:02] a saul be like david
[22:04] run out to the giant amen run out to the
[22:07] battle because you're going
[22:08] in the name of the lord amen hallelujah
[22:13] remember saul was hiding back and he was
[22:15] hiding among amongst the
[22:16] uh the baskets and everything like that
[22:18] where's our king where's our king
[22:20] he's hiding him somebody find him but
[22:22] david had a revelation
[22:23] that he was going to take that giant's
[22:24] head off so he ran out to meet the enemy
[22:27] now church that's what we need
[22:28] we need the anointing to face our
[22:32] our trial to face our enemy we need to
[22:35] get under god's anointing through prayer
[22:37] worship you know repentance however you
[22:39] got to do it you get under that
[22:41] anointing and that anointing will
[22:42] empower you
[22:43] god does not give a spirit of fear he
[22:46] doesn't run from the enemies
[22:47] he faces the enemies and he overcomes
[22:50] them
[22:52] hallelujah so this scripture came to my
[22:55] heart yesterday i need to look that up
[22:57] now look he's in second corinthians this
[23:00] is the church in corinth
[23:01] this was the church that had lots of
[23:02] gifts but not much character they were
[23:04] sanctified but many of them weren't
[23:06] filled with the holy ghost
[23:08] right they had a lot of supernatural but
[23:10] they needed some more character of
[23:11] christ
[23:13] now for when we were coming to macedonia
[23:16] right that's uh referring to uh the
[23:19] philippi
[23:20] near philippi our flesh had no rest
[23:23] but we were troubled on every side
[23:26] without were fightings
[23:28] within were fears that church let me
[23:31] tell you
[23:31] he said we we paul was scared when
[23:34] people would persecute him
[23:36] paul was scared right
[23:40] if any of you ever ever been uh well i
[23:42] don't know about
[23:43] hopefully none of you have ever been
[23:44] arrested but if you have how many been
[23:46] pulled over
[23:47] i get scared every time i get pulled
[23:48] over it's been been about a year since
[23:50] i've been pulled over thank god for that
[23:52] i got a speeding ticket last year but i
[23:54] really get scared
[23:55] i don't want nothing to happen it's just
[23:57] a natural human reaction
[23:59] just because you're scared doesn't mean
[24:01] you're not saved
[24:02] just because you're scared doesn't mean
[24:04] god's not with you
[24:06] that's not what i mean it just means
[24:08] you're human if you get scared
[24:10] because look paul said he's scared but
[24:11] the bible said the fearful
[24:13] are going to burn the lake of fire paul
[24:15] didn't see paul didn't remain a slave
[24:18] to fear we're all going to have fear
[24:21] but then we got to overcome fear praise
[24:23] god
[24:24] right so if we if we get scared with
[24:26] something that's fine
[24:28] just say god i'm going to battle this
[24:30] and i'm going to bow this
[24:31] until i overcome this i in other words i
[24:35] will conquer fear fear will not dominate
[24:38] my life
[24:39] but i will dominate fear
[24:43] see paul church paul was fearful so
[24:46] inwardly he had fear he was fighting
[24:48] outwardly he had foes he was
[24:50] going against and so see we'll have both
[24:54] too
[24:55] we'll have people that'll mock us or
[24:56] make fun of us or threaten us outside
[24:58] but then we also have to battle the fear
[25:00] on the inside so we have a
[25:02] a a two-front war right malachi we have
[25:04] a war on two fronts
[25:06] now not all the time but sometimes and
[25:09] so we got to be able to
[25:11] overcome the fears that are outside and
[25:14] then the fears that are inside most
[25:16] the ones that are terrorized us most are
[25:18] the fears that are inside
[25:19] what are people going to think how am i
[25:21] going to do this
[25:22] what are they going to say who cares
[25:24] what anybody says we need to find out
[25:25] what god's word says about it praise god
[25:28] see and as i grow older i care less what
[25:31] people think of me
[25:32] right i used to be concerned what are
[25:34] they going to think well i don't care
[25:36] anymore what they think i i know what
[25:39] god's called me to do right
[25:41] i know where god's called me place me i
[25:43] see what he's put in my
[25:45] my my responsibility and i must be
[25:48] faithful with that
[25:49] i'm gonna get my eyes off of other
[25:50] people i'm only gonna look to jesus
[25:53] christ
[25:53] and please him and love everybody else
[25:56] praise god
[25:57] for the greatest gift we can have is
[25:59] love
[26:01] hallelujah nevertheless god now look now
[26:04] look how how does paul get comfort out
[26:06] of his fear
[26:09] god does what that comforted those that
[26:12] are cast down
[26:13] comforted us by the vision
[26:18] by the dream dreams are good visions are
[26:21] good
[26:22] by the coming of titus a young gentile
[26:25] preacher
[26:28] so paul's battling inside he's all
[26:30] fearful
[26:31] and outside he's got enemies and how
[26:34] does god god
[26:35] help me so what does god do he sends him
[26:37] titus
[26:39] praise god he sends a man
[26:43] who's got god inside of him and praise
[26:45] god so god steps down in a man named
[26:48] titus
[26:48] and he sends titus go comfort my servant
[26:51] paul
[26:52] he's battling fear i want you to be a
[26:54] strength to him
[26:55] church you realize just being around a
[26:57] holy ghost-filled saint is enough to
[26:59] comfort you and strengthen you in the
[27:01] midst of your trials
[27:02] you don't even have to have the answer
[27:04] to your trials just being around
[27:06] somebody who's got the pillar of fire
[27:08] inside of them
[27:09] it so helps you it so comforts you it so
[27:12] strengthens you
[27:13] it's as if god himself was right there
[27:16] comforting you amen
[27:18] hallelujah praise god
[27:21] the man been he'd been whipped five
[27:23] times
[27:25] with 39 stripes each time
[27:29] almost 200 times
[27:32] fearful who can help me god said i'm
[27:35] gonna this i mean i could come down in a
[27:36] pillar of fire
[27:38] i could shine as a great light like i
[27:40] did when he i saved him on the road
[27:41] damascus
[27:42] but this time i think i'll send him
[27:44] titus
[27:44] [Laughter]
[27:47] i'm going to send titus a pr a pastor oh
[27:51] to help the prophet look how god can use
[27:55] someone of lower rank amen
[27:57] that we would say lower rank or lower
[27:59] gifting god can use someone more humble
[28:02] than us
[28:03] or lower than us to encourage us in the
[28:05] lord
[28:11] first keep your eyes open god may use
[28:12] the children to encourage you sometimes
[28:16] keep your hearts open right god may use
[28:19] someone of seemingly
[28:20] lesser rank lesser privilege or
[28:25] lesser superiority or something
[28:29] in other words god will use somebody
[28:30] humble
[28:32] to deliver you from your fear
[28:36] and not by his coming only so paul says
[28:39] not just titus
[28:40] help me now that comfort means to take
[28:43] away fear
[28:44] it means to so paul got delivered
[28:46] through the comfort of fellowship
[28:48] see why we got a fellowship more church
[28:51] everything's just going to be better the
[28:53] more we fellowship praise god
[28:56] not by his coming only but by the
[28:58] consolation wherever
[28:59] he was comforted in you praise god
[29:04] so titus was comforted by the
[29:06] corinthians
[29:07] and that and when paul heard a word from
[29:09] titus and about the corinthians
[29:11] both of those testimonies work together
[29:14] to provide paul some comfort on this
[29:16] earth
[29:19] church i'm sure you've noticed by now
[29:21] this is not a very comfortable life
[29:24] living in laodicea it's not very
[29:25] comfortable there's problems there's bad
[29:27] news there's trouble on every side
[29:30] but god has special ways to bring you
[29:32] some comfort praise god
[29:34] just ask him praise god it might not
[29:37] come the way you want it
[29:38] but god is going to see the bible said
[29:40] he's the god of comfort amen
[29:42] he's the god of help he's the god of
[29:44] strength and
[29:46] and even if you're a prophet no matter
[29:47] how great you are how much revelation
[29:49] you might have we all we thank god for
[29:51] revelation
[29:52] but no matter how much we have god can
[29:54] always use
[29:56] someone humble uh to help us god if
[29:59] we're open to god that's undiscovered in
[30:01] unexpected ways but we've got to be
[30:03] trusted in god to do it
[30:04] and then receive the comfort that he
[30:06] does say
[30:10] when he told us your earnest desire for
[30:13] mourning your firmer mind toward me
[30:15] so i'll rejoice the more you remember
[30:16] this paul had rebuked the corinthian
[30:19] church in the first letter
[30:21] this is the second letter so paul gets
[30:24] word back from titus
[30:26] that the corinthians got his first
[30:28] letter and they repented of that man
[30:30] that man that was sleeping with his
[30:31] stepmom and that word
[30:34] from titus right and that word from
[30:37] titus titus brought to paul
[30:39] that brought a great comfort so not only
[30:41] just seeing titus's face
[30:43] he just wanted to see his face oh my
[30:44] brother titus i'm so
[30:46] comforted but not only that but also the
[30:48] news
[30:49] that the saints repented praise god amen
[30:52] church just news uh that you got healed
[30:55] will bless us
[30:56] all praise god just see any testimony
[30:59] that you have
[31:00] let's share it praise god because it
[31:02] ought to encourage us
[31:03] it comforts us to know all good news
[31:06] makes the saints feel good amen
[31:08] it brings comfort it gives god's a
[31:10] consolation
[31:11] it gives us evidence that god is with us
[31:13] amen
[31:16] like i shared that testimony bang out on
[31:17] wednesday i don't know if you heard it
[31:18] but amen asked me to give my testimony
[31:20] last year and put it on youtube
[31:22] so i did and then a sister from canada
[31:25] couldn't have a baby she watched it and
[31:28] she she said right after that she
[31:29] conceived and had a baby
[31:32] and then she uh she wanted to thank the
[31:34] church for putting that testimony up
[31:37] so see i probably would not have done
[31:38] that unless he would have kept asking me
[31:40] but see how god see how god used you
[31:42] brothers see and we all work together
[31:44] you know we all work together for that
[31:46] you know uh and see that encourages us
[31:49] god is that ought to comfort us praise
[31:50] god
[31:51] if god heard that prayer of that little
[31:53] woman over there in canada
[31:54] if god heard her prayer god will hear
[31:56] your prayer too
[31:58] god's gonna hear my prayer god will hear
[32:00] your prayer god cares amen he's going to
[32:03] bring comfort
[32:04] weight on him he's the holy one of
[32:05] israel he's the timeless one
[32:07] he's the one who's never late he's the
[32:09] one that's always on time
[32:11] trust in the almighty god hallelujah
[32:15] but yeah you're going to have fears
[32:16] without and fears within
[32:20] but you've got to pray for god's comfort
[32:23] and you'll get the victory
[32:25] praise god now i didn't think i'd spend
[32:27] this long on this but
[32:28] god knows what we have need of praise
[32:29] god i i've
[32:31] brother william i've tried to i quit
[32:33] trying to figure it out you know
[32:35] i used to think well i'm going to preach
[32:36] this long on this i just quit i'm just
[32:37] like that
[32:38] the holy spirit's going to take over
[32:39] right who am i i don't know nothing
[32:42] i'm i'm a ding-dong they'd say i'm i'm a
[32:44] nobody i'm a fool
[32:45] i'm a fool without christ with him i
[32:48] have nothing but with his leadership
[32:50] all things can be accomplished amen his
[32:52] will can be done if we yield to it
[32:54] praise the lord
[32:56] now look so see paul paul didn't go to
[33:00] hell he said i know i've got a crown of
[33:02] eternal life waiting for me but he
[33:04] battled fear
[33:05] see so only those that are addicted to
[33:08] fear only those that are addicted to
[33:09] murdering
[33:10] whoremongers liars idolaters sorcerers
[33:13] those are the ones that get punished but
[33:16] you and i
[33:17] don't get punished because we overcome
[33:19] that
[33:21] we discern the antichrist spirit
[33:25] in the midst of the church right we
[33:27] discern it and when we discern it
[33:29] we cast it out amen
[33:32] that's all the church has to do discern
[33:34] the two spirits in the framework of the
[33:36] church
[33:36] and if she does that and casts out the
[33:39] evil spirits
[33:40] she'll be an invincible army and that's
[33:43] what we've been for 15 years
[33:45] right man we've been a invincible army
[33:48] for 15 years yeah we lost a few battles
[33:51] i can i can tell you my mistakes i made
[33:53] a few mistakes here and there but i'm
[33:55] still fighting the devil
[33:56] i'm still here i'm still standing with
[33:59] the the armor of god on praise god let
[34:01] me get my sword out here

[34:11] my mind's ready i got a uh
[34:13] i got the breastplate jesus's
[34:14] righteousness covers me
[34:16] i'm still standing i'm still fighting
[34:19] and i will not be defeated
[34:21] because jesus made me more than a
[34:23] conqueror amen
[34:25] i'm still fighting i'm still here you're
[34:27] still here so keep fighting
[34:29] the comfort's on the way praise god and
[34:32] the comforter's breaking the comfort
[34:33] amen
[34:34] i didn't know yeah i ain't going
[34:37] anywhere praise god
[34:39] i'm going to go fight for the devil i'm
[34:41] going to live for the devil i'm going to
[34:42] quit
[34:42] i'm here to stay praise god i'm in the
[34:46] land
[34:46] god gave me this land amen god gave me
[34:49] this position god gave me my wife and
[34:52] kids
[34:52] god gave us this church we're not moving
[34:55] back we're going forward
[34:58] hallelujah no devil in hell can move
[35:02] us back because we've got thus saith the
[35:03] lord
[35:05] we've got the word of jesus christ we've
[35:08] got the mind of god
[35:10] we've got the mind of christ amen we
[35:12] just got to forget our fearful thoughts
[35:14] right for
[35:15] forget our human minds and take on the
[35:17] mind of christ
[35:24] paul says i delight after the word of
[35:25] god in the inward man see
[35:28] yet he had fear on the inside too so see
[35:30] you can have fear on the inside but yeah
[35:32] happiness at the same time oh it's a
[35:36] multi-front battle but i see another law
[35:40] in my members
[35:42] warned against the law of my mind and
[35:44] bringing me
[35:45] into slavery let's all say slavery say
[35:49] paul was a slave sometimes yes paul he
[35:51] was free
[35:52] right as a free man but he was slave he
[35:54] was caught in traps of sin sometimes
[35:58] bringing me in the captivity to the law
[36:00] of sin which is in my members
[36:04] see paul sometimes fell short of the
[36:06] glory of god
[36:07] in this chapter he says i do things that
[36:08] i hate
[36:10] see there's sometimes he became a slave
[36:12] to the devil
[36:14] right and so do we sometimes we just
[36:16] surrender and say okay devil i can't
[36:17] fight anymore
[36:18] let me enjoy this sin right
[36:21] we all do it from time to time don't we
[36:25] so what does he say he said there's a
[36:27] part of me that's wretched
[36:29] oh wretched man that i am who shall
[36:32] deliver me from the
[36:33] here's the problem the problem is the
[36:35] body
[36:36] that's my problem amen is this body god
[36:40] it ain't god it ain't the holy spirit
[36:42] it's this body
[36:43] this wretched body who shall deliver me
[36:46] say but thanks be to god jesus christ
[36:49] our lord with the mind i serve the law
[36:51] of god
[36:52] but with the flesh the law since he was
[36:54] thankful to god
[36:55] we're thankful for jesus christ our lord
[36:58] when we can serve his word when we can
[37:00] obey his word
[37:01] that brings us out of captivity and then
[37:03] we're free in our minds
[37:09] we're free in our minds when we repent
[37:11] of our sins
[37:12] we get our mind off the sin and we get
[37:14] started looking under jesus the author
[37:16] and finisher of our faith
[37:20] i've seen them brother man we've seen
[37:21] them we've seen them coming to church
[37:22] slaves and leave out free men
[37:25] leave leave out free men and women
[37:27] praise god we've all done it right we've
[37:29] all come in this church discouraged
[37:32] but then we leave out we're forgiven
[37:34] we're feeling blessed
[37:36] oh now i'm ready to go out there and
[37:37] battle the devil this week amen
[37:39] i'm ready for battle praise god out he
[37:41] had me slaver
[37:42] uh jesus broke the chain this morning
[37:44] amen i think because he's a chain
[37:46] breaker amen
[37:47] miracle worker promise keeper he's our
[37:50] light in the darkness
[37:51] amen amen but there's a part of us like
[37:54] i'm a wretched person but mj if you just
[37:57] see my life sometimes i'm a wretched
[37:58] person brother
[38:00] but thanks be to god who gives me the
[38:02] victory over this body
[38:06] hopefully as time goes on you see more
[38:07] of god than the wretched part of me
[38:10] right right you see because i'm growing
[38:13] in his anointing
[38:14] i'm growing in his character i'm being
[38:16] i'm learning how to yield to him praise
[38:19] god
[38:19] amen hallelujah i'm the light of god i'm
[38:23] going from glory to glory
[38:25] from faith to faith the light is shining
[38:28] more increasing
[38:29] onto a perfect day amen
[38:35] now look he just ends that chapter by
[38:37] saying oh wretched man that i am
[38:38] and then he says now there's no
[38:40] condemnation
[38:43] can you imagine telling amen brother
[38:44] amen i'm a wretched man
[38:46] but i have no condemnation how can a
[38:48] wretched man have no condemnation
[38:50] because your body's wretched amen the
[38:53] sin and your body is wretched
[38:55] but my soul there's no condemnation
[38:58] there's no
[38:59] claims against me in heaven i have a
[39:01] clean slate in heaven
[39:02] i'm forgiven the blood of jesus has
[39:04] washed away
[39:05] all my sin this body is wretched but i'm
[39:08] forgiven
[39:09] i'm justified amen heaven has
[39:12] nothing against me because jesus took my
[39:15] place amen
[39:18] you imagine say that brother i'm so
[39:20] wretched brother but i have no
[39:21] condemnation
[39:23] it's like it's a paradox the christian
[39:25] life is a paradox
[39:28] within our fears within uh is
[39:31] wretchedness
[39:32] within is hateful things but the soul
[39:35] has no condemnation
[39:38] the soul is totally perfect in the eyes
[39:40] of god
[39:42] because now i'm walking after the spirit
[39:44] and not the flesh
[39:46] church you realize that as soon as you
[39:48] turn down sin let's say it's a
[39:50] temptation to lie
[39:51] or it's a temptation to text somebody
[39:53] back with angry angry words
[39:55] as soon as you set down the phone or you
[39:57] turn it on and just start worship
[39:58] instead
[39:58] you are now walking in the holy spirit
[40:01] because if you would have
[40:03] disobeyed and done something sinful then
[40:06] you would have been walking the flesh
[40:07] church brothers as soon as you turn your
[40:09] eyes from looking at that
[40:10] sexy dress woman you're now walking the
[40:12] holy spirit amen
[40:15] it might not feel like it because that
[40:17] that evil guy on the inside
[40:18] right or there's a deal you can make a
[40:20] deal dishonest deal but as soon as you
[40:22] turn that down and say i'm not doing
[40:24] that
[40:24] i'm gonna just trust in the lord as soon
[40:27] as you do that you're walking in the
[40:28] holy spirit
[40:29] see we don't live by what we see we
[40:31] don't live by sight
[40:33] we walk by faith amen and even if the
[40:36] holy ghost isn't anointing
[40:38] my mind at that point i know by the
[40:40] revelation of the holy ghost that i'm
[40:42] walking in the spirit
[40:43] when i deny the lust of the flesh
[40:47] hallelujah whether i feel it or not i
[40:50] know i'm walking the holy ghost
[40:51] because i'm not walking in the flesh
[40:53] anymore
[40:56] for the law of the spirit of life in
[40:58] christ jesus had made me free
[41:00] from the law of sin and death so before
[41:02] he's saying i'm so wretched who's going
[41:03] to deliver me from this
[41:04] and then he says i'm free from the law
[41:06] of sin and death
[41:08] he just said he was a slave to it and
[41:09] now a few verses a few breaths later
[41:12] he says i'm free from it see because
[41:14] he's living from a different place
[41:16] he now he's living from the soul now
[41:18] he's living from
[41:19] obedience to the holy spirit before he
[41:21] was he was uh doing things he
[41:23] shouldn't do he was doing sins and and
[41:25] and and falling short of the glory of
[41:27] god
[41:27] and oh my what a wretched person but now
[41:30] he said i don't have any condemnation
[41:32] i'm walking by the spirit church what uh
[41:35] what
[41:36] what uh what a rollercoaster ride our
[41:39] lives are can i say like that everybody
[41:41] said this is the hardest time of any age
[41:43] because of that because of all the
[41:45] pressures of this world
[41:47] this is the hardest age in able to
[41:49] overcome so if you're overcoming church
[41:52] you ought to be encouraged amen you
[41:54] ought to be shouting the victory praise
[41:56] god
[41:56] because this is the hardest age of
[41:58] deception and temptation
[41:59] and trials but here you are in the midst
[42:02] of satan's eden
[42:03] overcoming satan at every one of his
[42:05] tricks trusting in the blood of jesus
[42:07] christ and proving in this world
[42:09] that jesus christ is alive
[42:12] his spirit's inside of me when i turn
[42:15] down the flesh
[42:16] i'm walking the holy spirit and
[42:17] everybody can see i'm walking by the
[42:19] spirit i'm a new
[42:20] i'm a new creature in christ jesus i'm a
[42:22] god man i'm a jesus man
[42:25] i love jesus and i'm not walking of the
[42:27] things of the flesh
[42:28] i'm walking after the things of the
[42:30] spirit
[42:35] it's beautiful i mean this is so
[42:36] beautiful
[42:38] now look what john says john says if you
[42:42] confess your sins
[42:43] god is faithful to forgive you how many
[42:44] can say amen to that church you just got
[42:46] to confess and say jesus
[42:48] i'm the guilty one forgive me and then
[42:50] forgive me and then he'll forgive you
[42:53] and he cleanses you from all the
[42:56] unrighteousness now if we say we have
[42:58] not sinned we make him a liar and his
[43:00] word is not in us
[43:01] my little children these things i write
[43:02] unto you that you sin not
[43:05] if any man sin we have an advocate
[43:06] that's a legal counselor
[43:08] a lawyer with the father jesus christ
[43:11] the righteous
[43:12] well i like my chances in court brother
[43:14] william if jesus
[43:16] is my lawyer and god's the judge
[43:20] because the father and the son are one
[43:22] amen
[43:23] these three are one i sure like my
[43:25] chances if i got the holy ghost in me
[43:28] and jesus is my aunt my lawyer and the
[43:30] father's on the
[43:31] on the throne i sure like my chances
[43:33] praise god
[43:34] we're gonna win the case we're gonna be
[43:36] forgiven he's gonna declare us
[43:38] justified never did it in the first
[43:42] place
[43:43] so you don't got to argue anything you
[43:45] just got to say lawyer will you forgive
[43:46] me
[43:47] i confess my sin i'm wrong yes i forgive
[43:50] you and i cleanse you from all
[43:51] righteousness judge please uh there's no
[43:54] evidence against my defendant
[43:56] and the judge say he's free you get that
[43:58] gavel he said he's free
[44:00] go and sin no more amen
[44:03] that's what he told the woman god
[44:04] adultery go and sin
[44:06] no more praise god he said i'm writing
[44:09] you these things that you
[44:11] sin not that you walk in the spirit
[44:14] and overcome that battle within
[44:18] those fears within those doubts within
[44:21] that
[44:22] stress within i'm writing to you that
[44:24] you don't owe
[44:25] obey that but you obey the holy spirit
[44:28] and walk in the spirit
[44:31] the same guy that says you sin just like
[44:33] paul
[44:35] same guy says this he that committed
[44:38] sinners of the devil
[44:38] the devil said from the beginning for
[44:40] this purpose the son of god was
[44:42] manifested that he might destroy the
[44:43] works
[44:44] of the devil that's who you are
[44:48] if he was born to do that so are you
[44:51] then the bible say you're supposed to
[44:53] cast down anything that is
[44:55] exalted itself what is cast down throw
[44:57] down to pitch down
[44:59] to really now if i cast this down what'd
[45:01] you expect me to do like that
[45:02] what would you expect i'm casting that
[45:04] down well the bible says we're supposed
[45:06] to cast down
[45:07] anything against the word of god by the
[45:10] power of god
[45:12] if jesus came to destroy the works of
[45:14] the devil then so
[45:16] we must destroy the works of the devil
[45:17] as well
[45:19] but we just got to cast it down we got
[45:21] to stand there
[45:22] and be able to overcome was that a good
[45:25] illustration of casting down
[45:28] hopefully there's no tears here you know
[45:31] anyways it was given to me so i thank
[45:33] the lord for that
[45:34] i haven't bought a suit in like 10 years
[45:36] thank the lord
[45:37] so the same man that says this whosoever
[45:40] is born of god
[45:41] does not commit sin
[45:45] he just said if you say you have no sin
[45:47] you're a liar
[45:50] josh are you with me and then he says if
[45:52] you're
[45:54] born of god you do not commit sin for
[45:57] his seed remains in him
[45:58] for he cannot sin because he's born to
[46:01] god
[46:03] the same man said you're a liar if you
[46:05] say you don't sin
[46:06] and then he says if you if you're born
[46:09] again you cannot sin
[46:11] it's just like paul right just like paul
[46:14] i'm a wretched man
[46:15] i got no condemnation and i sin
[46:18] sometimes
[46:19] i never sin i didn't tell you look at
[46:22] god he's trying to teach us here
[46:24] to live from the inside praise god to
[46:26] live
[46:27] from the nature that's inside of us the
[46:29] holy nature of god
[46:31] acknowledge you make mistakes but also
[46:33] acknowledge that god seed cannot sin
[46:43] you've probably seen me do it i'm sure
[46:44] you've seen other people do it
[46:46] at the pulpit we'll feel so bad for
[46:48] something we did and then just a few
[46:49] seconds later we're shout rejoicing and
[46:51] giving god the glory
[46:52] why is that because part of me
[46:56] is a sinning part but the other part of
[46:58] me can never sin
[47:00] and i love to see the part that cannot
[47:02] sing i love to see
[47:04] myself overcome sin
[47:07] see this is how we're manifested or this
[47:09] is how we appear
[47:10] in this the children of god are
[47:12] manifested or appear and the children of
[47:14] the devil
[47:14] because he always know them because they
[47:16] disobey the word of god
[47:19] whosoever doth not righteousness is not
[47:21] of god neither he that loveth not his
[47:23] brother
[47:28] see church there should be nobody in
[47:29] this church that you cannot love
[47:32] some are going to be harder to talk to
[47:34] than others i'm probably hard to talk to
[47:36] sometimes
[47:36] sometimes in my mind i'm tired worn out
[47:38] sometimes i'm battling
[47:40] but we should still be able to love one
[47:42] another
[47:44] right help them out pray for them
[47:47] i try to encourage them in the lord see
[47:50] this is how this is this is how we
[47:52] appear we love each other
[47:55] praise god that's what makes jesus
[47:57] disciples different from other ones
[47:59] he said you'll know my they're my
[48:00] disciples because they love one another
[48:03] they love one another
[48:06] all right now now we'll finally get to
[48:08] joshua boy that was really something
[48:10] there
[48:10] probably that's a little bit of
[48:11] introduction there my god because i'll
[48:12] say a little review
[48:15] give me 30 more minutes by god's grace
[48:16] i'm sweating having a good old time here
[48:18] today
[48:19] i'd love to be on jesus side praise god
[48:22] now here look at church
[48:23] some of the battles now we're already in
[48:26] chapter 11.
[48:27] in chapters 6 through 10 the lord
[48:30] jehovah
[48:30] led israel into the victory in the
[48:33] central and southern part of canaan
[48:36] it was interesting they you know here
[48:37] down here in egypt they have to travel
[48:39] up instead of going right in there they
[48:40] go up and around because of their
[48:43] unbelief
[48:43] they've got to go up and around to
[48:45] jordan cross
[48:47] jordan and god doesn't take them in from
[48:49] the south or the north
[48:50] god takes them from right in the center
[48:53] in other words god directs you right to
[48:56] the heart of the battle
[48:58] praise god the bible said you got to
[49:02] uproot every root of bitterness
[49:05] god don't take you to the uh the top of
[49:07] the plant he takes you to the root of
[49:09] the plant
[49:10] the cause of the problem amen church
[49:13] see god takes them to the very heart of
[49:15] the battle
[49:17] the greatest cities he takes them first
[49:20] just like jesus right when he got the
[49:22] holy ghost he went out there in the
[49:23] wilderness he took on the greatest enemy
[49:25] for
[49:26] satan and if he then he had confidence
[49:28] if i can defeat satan of course he knew
[49:30] he would but
[49:30] you know for us if i can defeat satan
[49:33] then i can defeat the rest of them
[49:35] as long as i obey the word of god then
[49:37] i'll be more than a conqueror
[49:39] church some of your greatest battles
[49:41] come right after you're born again
[49:42] and that's to build up your confidence
[49:45] that my if god gave me victory over that
[49:47] if god gave me victory over that then
[49:49] i'm on the way to
[49:50] many many victories i cannot be stopped
[49:53] if god is for me
[49:54] who can be against me hallelujah
[49:58] if god is with me if god's fighting for
[50:00] me who's going to
[50:01] defeat god nobody can defeat god because
[50:04] he's the great warrior he's the man of
[50:06] war
[50:07] either he's the mighty conqueror he's
[50:09] the one that we we
[50:10] we cling to his power we trust in his
[50:13] power and he'll never fail the church as
[50:15] long as we obey the word of god
[50:19] see when you get born again he brings
[50:21] you right in the very thick of the
[50:22] battle
[50:24] and he shows you you can be an overcomer
[50:25] in the very middle of all
[50:27] all hell breaking loose all trouble
[50:28] breaking loose all problems breaking
[50:30] loose
[50:30] he can make you more than a conqueror in
[50:32] the very midst of it
[50:35] other people fall away other people
[50:36] wouldn't venture i wouldn't venture to
[50:38] go there
[50:39] i don't think i'd ever try that like
[50:41] like the like when i left the chapel
[50:42] they were telling me oh
[50:43] i could never stop going to movies
[50:46] that's what they told me
[50:47] i i how could you do that how could you
[50:49] stop watching sports jesse
[50:51] see they couldn't imagine overcoming
[50:54] that enemy and getting the victory in
[50:55] that battle
[50:57] see they they couldn't handle that
[50:58] battle right i don't know how you could
[51:01] ever stop smoking
[51:02] i don't know how you ever could stop
[51:03] chewing tobacco i don't know how you can
[51:05] ever stop to see they don't even
[51:07] understand the battle church but see god
[51:10] leads us
[51:10] into the battle we don't fear the enemy
[51:13] because god
[51:14] sent us and he gave us a word he gave us
[51:16] the word
[51:17] he said only be strong and very
[51:20] courageous
[51:22] as i was with moses so will i be with
[51:24] you praise god
[51:26] he said just be strong courageous
[51:28] meditate on the word of god
[51:30] you'll have strength for the battle
[51:35] that's how you know someone's really
[51:36] born again they can be thrown in the
[51:39] very thick of things and they're going
[51:40] to overcome somehow
[51:42] they're not going to abandon the battle
[51:43] they're not going to quit coming to
[51:44] church they're not going to quit reading
[51:45] their bible
[51:46] they're going to stand there until god
[51:48] delivers them praise god
[51:50] they're going to stand there like a
[51:51] warrior they're going to stand there
[51:53] like they got faith amen
[51:55] they're going to stand there like
[51:56] they've got big muscles and hair on
[51:57] their chest if they're a man
[51:58] they're going to stand there as a real
[52:00] soldier obedient
[52:02] knowing that god is going to back them
[52:04] up
[52:07] hallelujah i just thought it was
[52:11] interesting he takes him in the very
[52:12] heart
[52:13] of the battle right just like the garden
[52:16] of eden where was the battle right the
[52:17] very center of
[52:18] the midst of the garden see that
[52:22] where was about so eve she let down her
[52:24] word
[52:25] in the very midst of the battle the very
[52:27] the hotness of the battle
[52:29] right the very intense part see that's
[52:32] where she fell
[52:33] but we overcome because now we're in the
[52:35] very midst of satan's eden
[52:36] the most deceptive time there ever was
[52:38] right
[52:40] the most wicked time never was here we
[52:42] are in the midst of this
[52:44] and we've got to overcome right in the
[52:46] in the middle of it
[52:47] and we're in america too where it's rich
[52:50] and increased with goods
[52:51] have needed nothing we're in the very
[52:52] thick of it
[52:54] and god is asking us to stand how are we
[52:56] going to stand
[52:58] he's asking us to stand in the midst of
[53:00] uh satan's eden
[53:01] the the beast out of the land from
[53:03] revelation 13
[53:05] to stand against that beast see
[53:08] because we got a greater anointing they
[53:10] have the beast anointing right
[53:12] the satanic antichrist anointing but we
[53:15] got the flying eagle anointing
[53:17] amen it depends what you're anointed
[53:19] with praise god
[53:20] as long as you got that flying ego
[53:22] anointing you don't fear the enemy you
[53:24] fly above the enemy
[53:26] he can't touch you because you're seated
[53:28] in heavenly places
[53:29] in christ jesus
[53:32] but i like that that's how i knew by the
[53:34] way all these denominational friends
[53:35] that's how i knew
[53:36] they couldn't understand how i could
[53:38] overcome the battles
[53:39] but god was with me he was calling me to
[53:42] a higher calling
[53:44] praise god how could you have your your
[53:47] wife dressed like that how could she
[53:49] ever quit wearing makeup how could you
[53:51] not get tattoos
[53:52] how how could you uh uh not go to
[53:55] parties and how could you do all these
[53:56] things
[53:57] because i fear god that's why and you
[54:00] fear god you hate evil
[54:02] because i met god amen god met me
[54:06] god introduced himself to me and just
[54:08] like the burning bush
[54:09] god sent me with his word amen like he
[54:11] did moses amen
[54:14] how could i deny the very one who sent
[54:15] me and save me and call me praise god
[54:19] see so now here if you look at the map
[54:23] this is what i showed you last time when
[54:24] they first came in they got jericho ai
[54:27] the gibeonites members surrendered they
[54:28] were hivites and then
[54:30] all these five gathered against joshua
[54:33] in joshua chapter 10.
[54:35] and joshua did the surprise attack
[54:36] remember that he did the surprise he
[54:39] ambushed him
[54:40] i'm sorry that was ai uh with that one
[54:42] that's when he said son stand still
[54:44] he need a little more time to kill all
[54:46] these devils out of his life
[54:48] so he said he said son stand still
[54:50] brother bram said the earth stood still
[54:54] and the sunlight kept coming the earth
[54:56] stood still
[54:57] never was a day like it before so now
[55:00] god is directing them now they've
[55:02] defeated the southern enemy
[55:03] now god is directing them northward to
[55:06] the waters of maram which means high
[55:08] places
[55:11] so get your bible there joshua because
[55:13] joshua
[55:14] chapter 11.
[55:30] i've said it before i'll keep saying it
[55:31] joshua's one of the greatest books
[55:33] to help you learn how to be an overcomer
[55:37] always pray before battles
[55:41] right always obey all the word of god
[55:43] like jericho
[55:44] obey all of it pray before it like ai
[55:47] pray before every battle
[55:48] obey all the scripture everything you
[55:50] know how to do and god will bring the
[55:51] victory
[55:56] see we're more than conquerors in christ
[55:57] jesus now in verse one it came to pass
[56:00] when jabin king of hazel heard that
[56:02] those things that he sent to jobab king
[56:04] of maddon and the king of
[56:06] shimron the king of atshaf now
[56:12] he calls all these other kings together
[56:14] they don't list them on there but i
[56:15] think there's five other
[56:16] kings of before the kings and they're
[56:17] not mistaken now look at verse
[56:19] 4 church and they went out and they all
[56:21] their hosts with them much people even
[56:23] as the sand that is upon the seashore
[56:25] and multitude
[56:26] with horses and chariots very many
[56:28] church how many horses did israel
[56:30] have zero how many chariots did israel
[56:33] have to defend themselves against the
[56:35] chariots of
[56:36] of these five kings here
[56:39] chariots were considered the greatest
[56:40] weapon in those days because you got
[56:42] speed and you got iron
[56:45] and you got speed horses so these
[56:48] enemies have
[56:49] all the power of man
[56:53] i hope you heard me praise god they had
[56:55] all the power of man was against god's
[56:58] people
[56:58] he's got these humble little wars they
[57:00] probably don't have matching you know
[57:02] outfits
[57:03] right they they all had matching outfits
[57:05] they've been there for 400 years
[57:08] 450 years those kingdoms have built
[57:10] themselves up
[57:11] they were organized strong iron chariots
[57:15] everything screamed out were greater
[57:17] than you we're greater than you
[57:19] and they look out there or they must
[57:21] have looked out there and they've seen
[57:23] the whole
[57:24] all the land covered in soldiers
[57:26] everywhere you look as soldiers
[57:29] kind of like in the wintertime all you
[57:30] look all you see is snow everywhere you
[57:31] go
[57:34] right or today like or like this week
[57:36] all you see is rain there's so much
[57:39] sweat everywhere bloody they look out
[57:41] all they see is warriors
[57:44] you think god was scared up there in
[57:45] heaven you think god was shaking his
[57:46] boots
[57:47] oh all these devils are gathered against
[57:49] me
[57:50] god seated on his throne the ancient
[57:53] days
[57:54] he's like i've already been here in my
[57:56] mind
[57:57] i saw this before the foundation of the
[58:00] world and i'm going to make joshua the
[58:02] conqueror amen
[58:03] i'm with you joshua i'm not scared of
[58:05] them they're all
[58:06] they got demon powers but i've got the
[58:09] greater power
[58:11] i'm with you son don't fear them i don't
[58:14] care
[58:14] i don't care how big they are if they're
[58:16] as big as the sand of the sea don't be
[58:18] afraid of them
[58:18] i'm with you that's one thing to say
[58:22] that but it's another thing to speak it
[58:24] praise god
[58:28] verse 5 says they all came to the waters
[58:30] of maram which is high
[58:32] places and they fight there they're
[58:35] there
[58:36] to fight verse six
[58:40] now look what god tells joshua before he
[58:42] goes now church this is the
[58:44] one of the greatest helps we can ever do
[58:47] before we go into any battle i've said
[58:48] this before any meeting any phone call
[58:51] anything before we go into it we should
[58:53] pray god give me your spirit of power
[58:55] take the fear away from me i prayed that
[58:59] i felt good but inside i was still
[59:00] shaken but i knew i had the power of god
[59:02] on me
[59:03] i felt that numerous times right like
[59:05] paul said fear is within
[59:07] right you got fears within but in your
[59:09] soul your soul is anointed with the
[59:11] power of god
[59:14] so as the lord say to joshua be not
[59:16] afraid because of them
[59:18] for tomorrow about this time i will
[59:19] deliver them all up slain before the
[59:21] israel look god tells him i'm with you
[59:23] don't be afraid and he tells them when
[59:24] the victory is going to happen
[59:26] tomorrow you just got to get through
[59:29] this in one day you just got to get
[59:30] through it one day
[59:32] now for us it's always gonna it's
[59:34] usually gonna be soon i'm gonna get you
[59:35] through this soon
[59:37] right because we're not prophets and
[59:38] like joshua's a prophet he spoke
[59:40] uh heard saw the visions of god talk
[59:42] with god he met the the captain of the
[59:43] lord's host
[59:44] you know but see we got to have
[59:47] confidence
[59:47] that god is with us and that his word
[59:51] is faithful his word is steadfast
[59:54] nothing can move
[59:55] god nothing can move god's word god's
[59:58] word will stand
[59:59] hallelujah forever it's settled in
[1:00:01] heaven amen
[1:00:05] don't be afraid because of your enemy
[1:00:08] he said by tomorrow i'll deliver them
[1:00:11] all up slain
[1:00:12] now look now look what he says here i
[1:00:14] heard a preacher say that's really good
[1:00:15] thou shalt who their horses now that
[1:00:17] means cut their uh their hamstrings so
[1:00:19] they can't run
[1:00:20] fast now they'll still be alive but
[1:00:23] then you won't be afraid of them like
[1:00:24] they're gonna trample you down nobody's
[1:00:25] gonna chase you down
[1:00:27] we're gonna cut their hamstrings and
[1:00:30] burn their chariots isn't that something
[1:00:36] god says don't be afraid by this time
[1:00:39] tomorrow
[1:00:39] and then here's what you do with their
[1:00:41] armies burn them
[1:00:43] burn their cherries verse seven so
[1:00:46] joshua came all the people with
[1:00:48] a war with him and they come up suddenly
[1:00:50] now here like imagine church this is the
[1:00:52] title they're at gilgal
[1:00:53] a tiny little army can you imagine
[1:00:55] they're leaping over mountains and
[1:00:57] running up
[1:00:57] and they and then all of a sudden they
[1:00:59] surprise this big huge army
[1:01:02] a tiny little ambush of men come against
[1:01:05] this mighty army but they come
[1:01:07] suddenly they get a a quick a quick
[1:01:10] attack a surprise attack
[1:01:12] this tiny little army surprises the big
[1:01:15] army
[1:01:16] and instantly starts slaying them they
[1:01:18] just they just flow in there like a
[1:01:20] like a tiny uh like a missile or
[1:01:22] something like that like a little bullet
[1:01:24] they just fly up there and just start
[1:01:26] taking them out
[1:01:27] and it causes them all to flee
[1:01:34] a sudden attack from a tiny little army
[1:01:38] and the lord deliver them into the hand
[1:01:39] of israel smote them
[1:01:41] chase them down so this little tiny army
[1:01:44] starts chasing down all these
[1:01:46] thousands upon thousands and thousands
[1:01:49] of men finishing verse 8 they smote them
[1:01:53] until they left none remaining and
[1:01:56] joshua to them as the lord bait him
[1:01:58] he hold their horses and burn their
[1:02:00] chariots
[1:02:02] that is so significant church if you
[1:02:05] were an
[1:02:06] army and you defeated an army
[1:02:09] and you saw all their chariots were
[1:02:11] there what would you do with the
[1:02:13] chariots
[1:02:15] i'd probably take them right that's just
[1:02:18] going to make me stronger
[1:02:21] but that's what the world would think
[1:02:24] the world would say oh
[1:02:26] use their chariots uh you you need the
[1:02:28] you need the power of the
[1:02:30] enemy in order to be stronger
[1:02:33] you need to be like them your army needs
[1:02:35] to be just like the world that's a lie
[1:02:37] from hell
[1:02:38] your churches need to be just like this
[1:02:40] other church that's a lie from hell
[1:02:42] we need to be just like the book of acts
[1:02:43] church amen
[1:02:45] we have to be a denominational and all
[1:02:46] that non-denomination we don't we don't
[1:02:49] look to
[1:02:49] anybody else we don't look at anyone
[1:02:51] else's power we look at the power of
[1:02:53] christ
[1:02:56] so god said instead of taking those
[1:02:58] chairs now if you read the chapter
[1:03:00] they spoil everything else
[1:03:04] where's that scripture the bible said
[1:03:05] they spoil everything else
[1:03:12] yeah they utterly destroyed him in verse
[1:03:14] 11.
[1:03:16] killed all the kings in verse 12.
[1:03:20] yeah he killed hazer in verse 13. yeah
[1:03:22] in verse 14 all the spoiled these cities
[1:03:24] and the cattle the children of israel
[1:03:25] took they for praying on themselves
[1:03:27] why did they take the chariots and and
[1:03:29] the horses
[1:03:31] because god was showing them you are a
[1:03:33] different kind of army
[1:03:36] your power is not in man's devices
[1:03:40] don't try to have power of the enemy
[1:03:43] trust in my power hallelujah
[1:03:47] in other words the power of the enemy is
[1:03:50] never
[1:03:50] something that we're attracted to amen
[1:03:53] right the power of satan is never
[1:03:55] something we would ever
[1:03:56] be attracted to we're not trying to
[1:03:58] mimic satan's power
[1:04:00] we cast down any power of darkness amen
[1:04:03] any power that exalts itself against the
[1:04:05] word of god we cast it down
[1:04:07] we burn it up i don't want any power the
[1:04:09] enemy in my life
[1:04:10] whether it's playing politics or lying
[1:04:14] or stealing or trying to do these things
[1:04:16] i don't want any powers of the enemy
[1:04:18] i'm trusting in the power of god i'm a
[1:04:20] different kind of soldier
[1:04:21] i'm a different breed i'm a different
[1:04:23] kind of army i'm a god breed amen
[1:04:27] i will not copy off the world to try to
[1:04:30] have power
[1:04:30] my power comes from jesus amen
[1:04:35] the church that's why we don't build big
[1:04:36] denominations in big buildings right
[1:04:38] because there's no power in that
[1:04:42] it's powered for the world it's power
[1:04:45] for the enemy
[1:04:46] but it's not power for god's people
[1:04:48] praise god
[1:04:49] are you with me the power of god is holy
[1:04:52] power praise god
[1:04:55] hallelujah that's what we do the powers
[1:04:59] of darkness they did in the book of acts
[1:05:00] remember in the book of acts
[1:05:01] they went there and they got a church
[1:05:03] started there and the bible said they
[1:05:04] took those
[1:05:05] books of witchcraft and they burnt them
[1:05:09] right that was ephesus right that's what
[1:05:11] you do
[1:05:12] any power that comes outside of christ
[1:05:15] burn it up any influence any temptation
[1:05:19] anything that might give you this little
[1:05:20] advantage
[1:05:21] burn it up don't even let it tempt you
[1:05:24] just trust
[1:05:24] in the living god he brought you this
[1:05:27] far he's gonna take you on home amen
[1:05:30] his power brought you this far his power
[1:05:32] has been faithful his power will
[1:05:34] always remain faithful we don't take the
[1:05:36] power of darkness we live on the power
[1:05:38] of holiness
[1:05:45] destroy every man
[1:05:49] anything that was the breathing they
[1:05:51] destroyed
[1:05:52] verse 15 as we read that for our texts
[1:05:55] joshua did
[1:05:56] everything moses commanded and the bible
[1:05:59] said he
[1:06:00] enough unknown
[1:06:04] i'm about that testimony
[1:06:08] uh go to book of matthew here
[1:06:13] i'm looking it up
[1:06:16] listen brother can't preach a good
[1:06:18] message on when
[1:06:20] matthew 23 23 yeah what a rebuke this is
[1:06:23] the chapter that has the eight woes
[1:06:24] against the pharisees that's in the book
[1:06:25] it's in the
[1:06:26] uh mystery of iniquity chapter
[1:06:29] anyone who lives in iniquity deserves
[1:06:31] woes and rebukes right jesus gave him
[1:06:32] eight of them
[1:06:35] woe unto you scribes and pharisees
[1:06:37] hypocrites for you pay tithe
[1:06:39] and anas and cuman and have omitted the
[1:06:41] way to your matters of the law judgment
[1:06:43] mercy and faith these all you have to
[1:06:47] done and not to leave the other
[1:06:49] undone so see in other words they were
[1:06:52] real good at finances
[1:06:54] right they're real good at paying ties
[1:06:56] not so good at judging
[1:06:59] not so good at showing mercy but jesus
[1:07:02] christ said you need to be good at
[1:07:03] finances
[1:07:04] and you need to be good at showing mercy
[1:07:06] so don't leave anything undone
[1:07:10] right if something seems unfinished in
[1:07:12] your life church let's finish it
[1:07:14] finishing is always the hardest thing to
[1:07:16] do i love starting things but man i have
[1:07:17] a hard time finishing things
[1:07:19] but this book is taught these two books
[1:07:21] these two books have taught me patience
[1:07:22] it's finished it is finished
[1:07:25] it's taught me that i've got to keep
[1:07:27] pressing on until i finish something
[1:07:31] and jesus christ said you must do
[1:07:34] everything that we're called to do in
[1:07:36] the word but
[1:07:37] also do not ignore anything don't don't
[1:07:40] let there be
[1:07:40] places in your life that you're just not
[1:07:42] paying attention to
[1:07:45] right think about your life make sure
[1:07:49] make sure everything in your life is
[1:07:50] squared away
[1:07:52] right all your relationships makes sure
[1:07:55] relationships are right
[1:07:56] you sinned against anybody go talk to
[1:07:58] them right
[1:08:00] make sure your church life your church
[1:08:01] family everybody's teaching everybody
[1:08:02] good
[1:08:04] right your work make sure everything's
[1:08:06] good at work make sure everything's
[1:08:07] gonna work
[1:08:07] everything's squared away makes your
[1:08:10] finances are okay
[1:08:12] right everything's squared away he said
[1:08:14] don't leave anything undone how about
[1:08:16] feed the poor
[1:08:19] remember remember when peter and paul
[1:08:21] left they met the bible said they left
[1:08:22] and the last thing paul said
[1:08:24] he said keep the commands he said and
[1:08:26] don't forget the poor
[1:08:28] that's the last thing brother william a
[1:08:30] holy ghost-filled saint said
[1:08:32] don't forget the poor see
[1:08:35] that's one thing we forget sometimes
[1:08:37] let's remember the poor
[1:08:39] so you've got to make sure everything is
[1:08:40] taken care of
[1:08:42] i've been working on landscaping all
[1:08:44] summer i finally felt like yesterday i'm
[1:08:47] caught up
[1:08:48] now there's a couple areas that's undone
[1:08:50] but those really aren't my areas
[1:08:52] i would probably laugh if we talked
[1:08:53] about anything i got everything i got
[1:08:55] the weed eater out this week by the mj
[1:08:57] i was weed eating i was i was mowing i
[1:09:00] mowed it yesterday
[1:09:01] i i just feel like i kind of look i
[1:09:03] breathed yesterday i was like i
[1:09:06] better enjoy this i feel like i got
[1:09:07] everything caught up here
[1:09:09] the inside was all clean we cleaned you
[1:09:11] know on friday we had the naomi and the
[1:09:13] family over on friday and
[1:09:14] we cleaned it man it was like
[1:09:18] this is like the best i've ever seen it
[1:09:20] here
[1:09:21] it feels like everything's done dishes
[1:09:23] are done
[1:09:25] and that's what we have to have that
[1:09:26] desire for spiritual
[1:09:28] spiritual completion amen make sure
[1:09:31] everything is finished hallelujah
[1:09:35] make sure the poor taken care of make
[1:09:38] sure your family relationships are solid
[1:09:40] right make sure everything is taken care
[1:09:44] of that's what joshua did that's what
[1:09:45] we're gonna do church
[1:09:46] that's what we're gonna do everything
[1:09:48] will be taken care of
[1:09:49] all of our lives will be uh administered
[1:09:52] the word to the in other words the word
[1:09:55] is gonna reign
[1:09:56] over every area of our lives amen how
[1:09:58] did it get praise god
[1:10:01] the word has preeminence in every area
[1:10:03] of our lives
[1:10:08] see that's how you know a pharisee a
[1:10:10] pharisee only takes care of part of
[1:10:12] their lives
[1:10:13] right but the holy ghost don't say they
[1:10:16] take care of all them
[1:10:19] ah thank you jesus hallelujah leave
[1:10:22] nothing undone look at verse 18.
[1:10:27] so joshua takes all the land the bomb
[1:10:29] said and joshua made a law a war a long
[1:10:32] time with all those kings church you
[1:10:34] know how long this war was
[1:10:35] at least six or seven years
[1:10:38] now the battle we read today was just a
[1:10:40] short battle right they drove him out
[1:10:42] they chased him down and killed him
[1:10:44] but the next chapter shows 31 kings
[1:10:48] 31 kings i love it god names them by
[1:10:52] name
[1:10:54] in other words this devil that was
[1:10:56] defeated
[1:10:57] this devil was defeated that devil was
[1:11:00] defeated
[1:11:01] this one and this sickness and that and
[1:11:03] cancer i see
[1:11:04] all these things he names them one by
[1:11:07] one
[1:11:08] god is a god of lists i love it god he
[1:11:11] records all the names that were in all
[1:11:13] the 12 tribes of israel
[1:11:15] he knows whose father is who he knows
[1:11:17] whose daughter's who
[1:11:18] he knows all the overcomers he knows all
[1:11:21] the unbelievers
[1:11:22] and god has a list of all of our names
[1:11:24] thank god we're listed on the lamb's
[1:11:26] book of life thank god
[1:11:27] your name is there now live like it
[1:11:29] praise god and
[1:11:30] overcome the enemy in every one of those
[1:11:32] tricks
[1:11:36] the bible said god is not unrighteous to
[1:11:39] forget your labor of love
[1:11:41] in other words the bible said god makes
[1:11:44] a list right now of everybody who's
[1:11:45] talking about him
[1:11:46] and he rewards them there's a list going
[1:11:48] angels are taking record right now
[1:11:50] well this brother's saying amen the
[1:11:52] sisters saying amen this brother's
[1:11:54] overcoming that
[1:11:55] there's a list going on right now in
[1:11:56] heaven church
[1:11:58] hallelujah i want to be recorded praise
[1:12:00] god
[1:12:01] i want to have the testimony i was
[1:12:03] thinking about jesus glorifying jesus
[1:12:06] i was denying the flesh i was walking in
[1:12:08] the spirit praise god
[1:12:10] i was thinking about the things of god
[1:12:12] hallelujah testifying helping the saints
[1:12:15] encouraging them
[1:12:16] edifying and praying for them amen
[1:12:19] hallelujah not leaving anything undone
[1:12:21] praise god
[1:12:26] sometimes these wars last a long time
[1:12:31] oh my sometimes they last longer than we
[1:12:33] want
[1:12:34] but church if you're the joshua army you
[1:12:37] just keep going forward
[1:12:39] and you are going to get the victory
[1:12:42] it's been a long battle against this
[1:12:43] sickness
[1:12:44] it's been a long battle against that
[1:12:46] brother it's been a long battle against
[1:12:49] that church
[1:12:51] it's been a long battle against that
[1:12:53] spirit
[1:12:55] but i am going to get the victory
[1:12:58] but jesus christ is going to make me
[1:13:00] more than a conqueror in this situation
[1:13:03] joshua didn't quit after a little a
[1:13:04] short little battle
[1:13:07] he didn't come in there expecting well
[1:13:08] i'll just battle for a year and then
[1:13:11] then it's all that will rest no he came
[1:13:14] in there knowing i've got to drive out
[1:13:16] millions of people i've got many
[1:13:20] many enemies i've got to conquer i'm in
[1:13:22] this for the long haul
[1:13:24] and we'll get to the chapter 14 caleb
[1:13:25] was in this for the long haul
[1:13:28] hallelujah he was in it for the long
[1:13:30] haul his 85 year old
[1:13:32] man just as strong when he was 40. i'm
[1:13:34] 40 right now so i need to remember
[1:13:36] i need to figure out how much i can lift
[1:13:37] right now no that's just
[1:13:39] cardinal but that's the same idea as
[1:13:42] strong as he was at 40
[1:13:44] at 85 he was the same strength the same
[1:13:47] power
[1:13:48] see how god keeps you strong see if
[1:13:50] you're faithful to god god will be
[1:13:52] faithful to you praise god
[1:13:54] in other words if you want to be strong
[1:13:56] if you want to keep the victory god's
[1:13:58] going to give you the victory amen
[1:14:00] if you want to be strong when you get
[1:14:02] older like brother william and like
[1:14:03] sister beatrice
[1:14:04] you will just be faithful just keep the
[1:14:06] commands
[1:14:07] just leave nothing undone
[1:14:11] hallelujah if you want to you can be
[1:14:14] strong
[1:14:16] even into your final days
[1:14:19] just leave nothing undone
[1:14:24] of all that the lord commands you to do
[1:14:26] verse 18 a long war
[1:14:28] verse 19 only the gibeonites made peace
[1:14:30] everybody else they killed
[1:14:33] for in that middle area that central
[1:14:35] southern and northern parts
[1:14:38] now look at verse 20 church look at this
[1:14:40] for it was of the lord to harden their
[1:14:42] hearts
[1:14:42] that they should come against israel in
[1:14:44] battle that he might destroy them
[1:14:46] utterly that they might
[1:14:47] have no favor but that he might destroy
[1:14:49] them as the lord commanded moses you see
[1:14:51] church
[1:14:52] in other words the gibeonites wanted
[1:14:54] they had soft hearts to god
[1:14:56] see but all the people that hated god
[1:14:59] that hated holiness
[1:15:00] hated the holy ghost and all of the
[1:15:02] other people that hated moses and hated
[1:15:04] the prophet of god
[1:15:05] all of them that hate it god hardened
[1:15:07] them on purpose
[1:15:08] to bring them to judgment but anybody
[1:15:10] who wanted mercy god showed him mercy
[1:15:13] anyone who shows you mercy i believe
[1:15:15] god's going to show that mercy
[1:15:17] hallelujah because the gibeonites just
[1:15:20] were merciful
[1:15:22] they were humble they feared god and
[1:15:24] they were they were just kind right
[1:15:27] they didn't fight against israel and god
[1:15:30] had mercy on them
[1:15:32] i'm expecting some surprise on the day
[1:15:34] of judgment by the way
[1:15:35] i'm done good ones praise god
[1:15:39] if god was merciful to soft-hearted
[1:15:42] gibeonites
[1:15:44] god will be merciful soft part of people
[1:15:48] today
[1:15:49] people that won't speak against you
[1:15:53] they might not be with you they're not
[1:15:55] here but they don't speak against you
[1:15:58] and they know that you serve that you're
[1:15:59] a true christian god will be merciful to
[1:16:01] them
[1:16:02] i believe that with all my heart
[1:16:08] and you ought to do your part and say
[1:16:09] father forgive them they don't know what
[1:16:10] they're doing
[1:16:12] right just like jesus that's our example
[1:16:15] jesus said father forgive them they just
[1:16:17] don't know what they're doing
[1:16:19] and we know jesus or we know jesus
[1:16:21] prayer was heard by the father
[1:16:23] see god only hardens the hearts of those
[1:16:28] who will ultimately choose to fight
[1:16:29] against him
[1:16:31] god will not harden someone's heart if
[1:16:32] they want to be saved
[1:16:36] see now look at verse 22 now church this
[1:16:39] is interesting
[1:16:40] there was none of the anakins left in
[1:16:41] the land of the children of israel now
[1:16:43] americans were giants if you know your
[1:16:45] bible
[1:16:46] anakins were giants none of the giants
[1:16:49] were left in land
[1:16:50] only in gaza in gath
[1:16:53] in ashdod there remained huh
[1:16:58] what giant came out of gaff
[1:17:02] and he had four brothers
[1:17:06] see church i'm going to show this to you
[1:17:08] joshua did
[1:17:09] everything god told him to do
[1:17:13] and he was faithful with it but some of
[1:17:15] the other israeli
[1:17:17] warriors didn't do their part
[1:17:20] they didn't drive out the giants out of
[1:17:22] gas
[1:17:25] that's what happened later came to haunt
[1:17:26] them later
[1:17:28] when goliath rose up a few hundred years
[1:17:30] later right
[1:17:32] see church that's why it's so important
[1:17:33] when you come to christ surrender it all
[1:17:36] hallelujah say god take every selfish
[1:17:39] part of me out
[1:17:40] take every desire take anything that's
[1:17:43] contrary to you
[1:17:45] take it out of my life take all these
[1:17:47] giant obsessions and all these giant
[1:17:49] unbelief and
[1:17:50] all this giant lust and all this giant
[1:17:52] greed and all this giant doubt
[1:17:54] hallelujah
[1:17:54] all this giant fear take it all out of
[1:17:56] me take every
[1:17:58] enemy out of me that in the future i can
[1:18:00] have a better future
[1:18:01] to serve you amen
[1:18:10] because if you don't take care of it now
[1:18:12] it's gonna come back to haunt you
[1:18:15] maybe one day i'll tell you a story i
[1:18:16] think something i think recently in the
[1:18:17] past year something came back to haunt
[1:18:19] me that i didn't take care of
[1:18:20] now god has worked it out maybe i'll
[1:18:22] tell you that sometime in the future
[1:18:28] i thought my if i only would have taken
[1:18:29] care of this years ago
[1:18:33] i would not be suffering like i am now
[1:18:38] so see giants remain in gath
[1:18:42] and that's where goliath come out
[1:18:45] look at verse 23 so joshua took the
[1:18:46] whole land no that just means his
[1:18:48] portion church
[1:18:50] so i'm going to show you some scriptures
[1:18:53] there was a lot more left
[1:18:56] joshua took the whole land according to
[1:18:58] all that the lord had said unto moses
[1:18:59] see
[1:18:59] all the things moses said joshua did it
[1:19:04] and joshua gave it for inheritance unto
[1:19:05] israel according to their divisions by
[1:19:07] their tribes
[1:19:07] and the land rested the war
[1:19:11] so they finally got rest after about
[1:19:13] seven six or seven years of war
[1:19:17] once they in that interesting seven if
[1:19:20] it would be seven years because every
[1:19:21] seven years you know the spotlight says
[1:19:22] something's supposed to happen in your
[1:19:23] life every seven years
[1:19:24] that's interesting i remember there were
[1:19:26] some good sevens when i did my life
[1:19:28] 35 going i'm coming up to one 42 i'm
[1:19:30] coming
[1:19:31] a couple years i'll be going on another
[1:19:34] one
[1:19:36] see this joshua took the whole land
[1:19:39] now church if you've got your bible skip
[1:19:41] ahead to chapter 13 verse 1.
[1:19:45] i'm going to prove to you church this
[1:19:47] only means joshua's
[1:19:49] portion he fulfilled not the rest of the
[1:19:52] saints
[1:19:57] now joshua's old and stricken in years
[1:20:00] see when you get older the bible says he
[1:20:02] strikes you with oldness
[1:20:05] he burdens you with oldness right
[1:20:08] and the lord said unto him thou art old
[1:20:09] and stricken in years
[1:20:11] i made you i made you old i made you
[1:20:13] tired right
[1:20:15] and there remains yet very much land
[1:20:18] to be possessed
[1:20:21] this is the land that yet remaineth now
[1:20:23] look up here church
[1:20:24] this is from my bible it's very hard to
[1:20:26] see i'm very sorry but here are some of
[1:20:28] the cities we're talking about
[1:20:30] there's jericho
[1:20:33] okay there's some of their northern this
[1:20:35] is the northern parts where they got the
[1:20:36] victory up here the waters of
[1:20:37] maram
[1:20:41] okay so the red is all that joshua took
[1:20:45] so when the bible said joshua took all
[1:20:46] the land that's all the land
[1:20:49] the green is what god says there's still
[1:20:51] more remaining
[1:20:54] i wish i could find gath down there
[1:20:56] there's gaza oh yeah there's gather
[1:20:57] right there
[1:20:58] that's goliath's hometown right there
[1:21:00] they got so close
[1:21:01] up to that where they just didn't drive
[1:21:04] out the enemies
[1:21:05] out of that place
[1:21:09] see so joshua does all that moses
[1:21:12] commands and then they get rest go to
[1:21:15] acts chapter 9 verse 31 i'm coming up on
[1:21:17] about an hour and a half here
[1:21:22] i appreciate your attention i know it's
[1:21:23] hard sometimes but i appreciate your
[1:21:25] attention
[1:21:25] acts 9 31.
[1:21:29] how many appreciate the word this
[1:21:30] morning god bless you
[1:21:35] then the gates of hell will not prevail
[1:21:36] against you
[1:21:38] if you receive the revelation of this
[1:21:40] the gates of hell cannot overcome
[1:21:42] you that's what jesus christ said
[1:21:45] i believe that with all my heart
[1:21:50] acts 9 31 then the churches had
[1:21:54] rest joshua had to rest after seven
[1:21:57] years
[1:21:58] oh you can have rest in the new
[1:21:59] testament it's okay for a church to have
[1:22:03] rest in the new testament see everybody
[1:22:05] always use that quote brother and says
[1:22:07] if you're not battling you're not a true
[1:22:08] church that's true sometimes
[1:22:11] just like they say every time you do
[1:22:13] missionary work it's up god not every
[1:22:14] time
[1:22:16] paul tried to go to asia and the holy
[1:22:17] spirit said i forbid you to go to asia
[1:22:20] see how people pick and choose whatever
[1:22:21] quotes they want and they don't balance
[1:22:24] out quotes by the word of god
[1:22:25] we must rightly divide the word of truth
[1:22:28] the bible said prove all things
[1:22:29] try every spirit
[1:22:39] so joshua could have rest but we can't
[1:22:41] no no the bible says
[1:22:43] we can have rest and then had the
[1:22:46] churches rest throughout all judea and
[1:22:47] galilee samara and we're edified
[1:22:50] and walking in the fear of the lord
[1:22:55] and in the comfort there's
[1:22:58] paul said i needed comfort i'm having
[1:23:00] all these inward fearful battles
[1:23:02] but god sent me titus to comfort me
[1:23:05] praise god
[1:23:07] and we're multiplied now church go to
[1:23:09] the verse before that
[1:23:12] how did they get rest
[1:23:16] well if you read the verse before that
[1:23:18] which when the brother knew they brought
[1:23:19] him down to caesarea and sent them forth
[1:23:20] to tarsus
[1:23:21] they got rest when paul came or became
[1:23:24] paul instead of saul
[1:23:27] so they got rest so they were persecuted
[1:23:29] for a little while brother amen
[1:23:31] but after the persecution god gave them
[1:23:33] rest
[1:23:34] and then they spent that time just being
[1:23:37] built up and edified
[1:23:39] instead of coming to church to be i
[1:23:40] wonder if paul's going to break or saul
[1:23:42] is going to break down the door
[1:23:43] instead of all the torment now they
[1:23:46] could come to church and just i'm coming
[1:23:47] here to be built up now
[1:23:49] i'm coming here to be comforted church
[1:23:51] me and i'm enjoying it right now i
[1:23:52] praise god
[1:23:54] we're enjoying the rest of the lord
[1:23:55] right now we don't have any battles
[1:23:57] within the church right now
[1:23:58] we're in a time of rest and we ought to
[1:24:00] be getting built up praise god
[1:24:02] we ought to be getting stronger how do
[1:24:03] we edify one another
[1:24:05] being comforted praise god but just a
[1:24:07] few years ago we didn't have rest
[1:24:10] i told this to people and they thought
[1:24:11] what i told you who was it the preacher
[1:24:13] came a few weeks ago
[1:24:17] he said you guys used to have battles i
[1:24:18] said yeah i said certain people in the
[1:24:20] church would sit back there
[1:24:21] and all service they'd be going like
[1:24:22] this to me
[1:24:25] all service i'm trying to like encourage
[1:24:27] people i'm trying to preach my heart out
[1:24:29] and i look out there and they're like
[1:24:32] i'm like why don't you just say amen or
[1:24:33] something like that and that happened
[1:24:35] for like two years
[1:24:37] now honestly church those times it was
[1:24:39] really hard to come to church
[1:24:42] i wasn't having rest you probably saw me
[1:24:44] actually longer at the altar
[1:24:47] right right
[1:24:50] and then god supernaturally through a
[1:24:53] prayer
[1:24:54] i went to that person's chair and i said
[1:24:56] in the name of jesus christ i rebuked
[1:24:58] this spirit
[1:25:00] what was it of uh this critical spirit
[1:25:02] and i commanded to leave in the name of
[1:25:03] jesus christ
[1:25:05] 11 days later they left brother
[1:25:09] three days later no the next day a
[1:25:11] preacher come in and the preacher said
[1:25:13] uh
[1:25:14] so and so back there they said whatever
[1:25:16] you're planning to do
[1:25:17] do it the holy spirit told me to do it
[1:25:22] and they left a few days later and since
[1:25:24] then i've just been so happy
[1:25:26] right i mean i don't have any none of
[1:25:28] you no this is good for you
[1:25:30] none of you look at me and angry with me
[1:25:32] now if you are let me know i'll say i'm
[1:25:33] sorry if i
[1:25:34] offended you but everybody's usually got
[1:25:37] smiles on their face
[1:25:39] thinking real deep like maybe praying
[1:25:44] see we we're at a season of rest right
[1:25:46] now
[1:25:47] as far as most of us who's persecuting
[1:25:51] you right now
[1:25:51] who's persecuting you who's threatening
[1:25:53] your life
[1:25:55] now right now nobody's calling me a
[1:25:56] devil nobody's persecuting me as far as
[1:25:58] i know
[1:25:58] but i've gone through seasons where i've
[1:26:00] had that persecuted from within
[1:26:04] persecuted from without right and then
[1:26:05] fears within fears within fears without
[1:26:09] but see after a while god you keep

[1:28:07] that's right without holiness no man
[1:28:08] shall see the lord there's another one
[1:28:10] i'm thinking of too
[1:28:11] peace let me just look it up it's in
[1:28:14] timothy or thessalonians
[1:28:18] it's good acceptable on the side of our
[1:28:20] our savior there's a scripture like that
[1:28:25] bear with me here this one just came to
[1:28:28] me i didn't have time to look it up
[1:28:31] charity peace oh yeah
[1:28:34] first timothy two two there is pray for
[1:28:37] kings and for all that are in authority
[1:28:38] that we may lead a quiet and peaceful
[1:28:40] life
[1:28:41] in all godliness and honesty a church
[1:28:43] and because of that peace when that
[1:28:44] critical spirit left now i wrote the
[1:28:46] next book
[1:28:48] i had peace to write that next book now
[1:28:50] in church if that just saves one person
[1:28:53] it was worth it all god gave me a season
[1:28:55] of peace
[1:28:57] to write this full ex exposition on or
[1:29:00] full commentary on all the mysteries of
[1:29:02] god
[1:29:03] and i believe now church we're doing
[1:29:04] even more on our part
[1:29:06] to prophesy again to nations and
[1:29:09] kingdoms and peoples
[1:29:11] right we'll see what god does with it
[1:29:14] right but we got to do our part
[1:29:17] we've got to eat the book thank god well
[1:29:18] i've sure enjoyed it these last few
[1:29:19] years eating all the mysteries of god
[1:29:21] it's been delicious amen i'm stronger
[1:29:24] because of it praise god
[1:29:25] but now i don't let it stop there you
[1:29:27] must prophesy
[1:29:29] in i'm a prophesy again
[1:29:32] prophecies of the random games because
[1:29:34] right out of the bible
[1:29:36] right some sea church there are times of
[1:29:40] rest
[1:29:43] times of war now some of you like maybe
[1:29:45] going through wars and battles right now
[1:29:48] but most of them are wars within right
[1:29:52] and that's where you can still get the
[1:29:53] victory

[1:29:57] comfort just say god

[1:30:13] you or something like that and that may
[1:30:15] come
[1:30:16] brothers of course that may comfort you
[1:30:20] just to know somebody's with you
[1:30:21] someone's praying for you
[1:30:23] it can be just like that
[1:30:27] just to know that someone is thinking
[1:30:29] about you
[1:30:31] just to know that someone's praying for
[1:30:32] you that may be just the comfort that
[1:30:34] you needed
[1:30:35] i remember that one it was right after i
[1:30:37] heard the message brother william a
[1:30:38] couple of months after that
[1:30:40] the denominational brothers cornered me
[1:30:42] in the room and convinced me the message
[1:30:44] was wrong and i said okay
[1:30:45] that's right yeah that's probably wrong
[1:30:47] and all this i was i was convinced for
[1:30:49] one night
[1:30:49] i woke up the next morning i got a phone
[1:30:51] call from a message pastor
[1:30:53] craig booer and he said how's it going
[1:30:56] you still believe the message brother
[1:30:58] and i said yes and i so and i said i'm
[1:31:01] sorry last night i was
[1:31:02] convinced the pray to come out of it but
[1:31:04] i'm back in
[1:31:05] that phone call brought me back in
[1:31:09] i just been prayed out the night before
[1:31:11] you see they couldn't pull me out
[1:31:12] because they didn't put me in god put me
[1:31:13] in praise god
[1:31:15] hallelujah no man can pull you out if
[1:31:17] god put you in praise god
[1:31:19] but see how god used that word of
[1:31:21] comfort that word of encouragement
[1:31:25] and just that brother's that brother his
[1:31:27] brother craig bore that brother's
[1:31:28] testimony or influence in my life is
[1:31:31] beyond i can hardly explain how much
[1:31:32] that brothers
[1:31:33] encouraged me and yet we haven't spent
[1:31:36] that much time together
[1:31:37] but that one those few moments of
[1:31:39] comfort and edification
[1:31:40] have gone beyond anything the world
[1:31:42] could ever offer
[1:31:45] just like paul said god come for me by
[1:31:47] sending me
[1:31:48] god and flesh hallelujah god sent me a
[1:31:52] man when i needed comfort amen
[1:31:55] he sent me a good report a testimony

[1:32:29] church here you know chapter 12. now
[1:32:33] verses 1 through 6 are moses's victories
[1:32:35] repeated
[1:32:36] but verses 7 through the end were
[1:32:39] joshua's victories
[1:32:40] of 31 kings defeated
[1:32:48] god puts a list in his bible
[1:32:53] because it proves he keeps his word
[1:32:58] i'm going to bring out the scripture let
[1:32:59] me
[1:33:01] go to luke 1 45
[1:33:06] why does god put these unending seems
[1:33:08] like a list in here
[1:33:10] because god wants a record among men
[1:33:13] that god keeps his word god wants
[1:33:17] men to share with other men that god
[1:33:20] kept every single detail of his word
[1:33:23] god doesn't lie church amen

[1:33:36] you something god will bring it to pass
[1:33:40] so god says i'll go ahead and list all
[1:33:42] 31 devils

[1:33:47] that when i give my word i back up my
[1:33:49] word

[1:34:05] it i perform
[1:34:06] my promise i always keep my promise the
[1:34:09] devil can't stop me

[1:34:32] and that and that and god did this all
[1:34:34] these things god is faithful to his word
[1:34:38] last scripture isaiah 6 verse 1
[1:34:44] i think it's the last scripture
[1:34:50] brother tim and kimmy preached this
[1:34:51] years ago in that year the king of
[1:34:53] uzziah died
[1:34:54] i saw also the lord sitting upon a
[1:34:57] throne high
[1:34:58] lifted up and his train
[1:35:02] filled the temple a train is his skirt
[1:35:05] or robe
[1:35:06] like the kings like a woman wears when
[1:35:07] she gets married her veil
[1:35:09] that long veil is like a train
[1:35:12] right it expresses all of her purity
[1:35:15] all of her beauty right
[1:35:18] right it's just a sense of wow she's so
[1:35:20] pure she's so beautiful
[1:35:22] but god sits on his throne in heaven and
[1:35:24] isaiah said his
[1:35:26] his robe his skirt filled the whole
[1:35:28] temple
[1:35:29] it was so great can you imagine fold
[1:35:32] after fold
[1:35:32] after fold of this train can you imagine
[1:35:35] isaiah said i see the whole heavens
[1:35:37] filled with this train and brother tim
[1:35:40] showed us my history one time from the
[1:35:41] kings
[1:35:42] the kings would on their train they
[1:35:43] would put all the names
[1:35:45] of all the enemies they'd conquered
[1:35:48] and so god was showing isaiah look at
[1:35:50] all that i've conquered amen
[1:35:53] my train is so great i defeated 31 kings
[1:35:56] i defeated it for joshua i defeated all
[1:35:58] these kings from
[1:35:59] for moses i defeated all those kings for
[1:36:01] abraham
[1:36:02] i defeated all these kings no king can
[1:36:05] stand before me
[1:36:06] my uh my my glory goes before me
[1:36:10] my testimonies are great my word never
[1:36:12] fails
[1:36:13] you can trust in me praise god listen to
[1:36:16] our feet we can trust
[1:36:18] in the lord his train his testimonies of
[1:36:21] victory fill the temple
[1:36:24] so if they fill that temple shouldn't
[1:36:26] they fill our temple
[1:36:29] shouldn't they fill our lips you can
[1:36:30] stop the livestream musicians you can
[1:36:34] come
