[27:46] [Music]
[28:03] we're on the right path aren't we
[28:07] hey man you like how the Lord inhabits
[28:09] that amen he likes they were walking up
[28:11] the highway amen we're going to try to
[28:14] sing that song If we can I command my
[28:15] hands uh
[28:17] praise the Lord and you know one thing
[28:20] I'm going to say is I actually sung that
[28:23] at a concert
[28:25] so what it was went to Louisiana Camp
[28:27] there's a bunch of British people there
[28:29] and they taught us in the middle of the
[28:31] street down there and when they would do
[28:33] it they say I come in my feet to praise
[28:36] the Lord
[28:38] and sure enough when I when I sung that
[28:41] on that CD for the South Carolina
[28:42] meetings the Holy Ghost so took me I was
[28:45] just dancing the whole time
[28:48] and and that's that's what's beautiful
[28:50] about it because you know the the Lord
[28:52] can anoint you to do that too amen so
[28:54] sometimes just looking to see if you can
[28:55] get by yourself so we'll see if we can
[28:57] do this if the Lord would be pleased
[28:58] there
[29:00] I command my hands to praise the Lord
[29:05] [Music]
[29:35] foreign
[29:37] [Music]
[30:53] here we go you've got to praise
[31:05] [Music]
[31:13] Hallelujah ladies
[31:20] [Music]
[31:48] doctor friends Hallelujah
[31:54] [Music]
[32:01] they'll be dancing Over Yonder
[32:07] Mr brother Brooks when you need him
[32:11] amen
[32:15] we'll go and get into the word of God
[32:16] this evening
[32:20] sister Eden my big sister nature they
[32:22] took me aside and they said are you
[32:24] teaching tonight
[32:26] and I was just going to preach but I
[32:27] didn't preach this morning
[32:29] but uh I think what I'm going to try to
[32:31] do I'm going to try to teach them
[32:33] if you sisters do want to come up here
[32:34] and sit so I'm going to kind of teach it
[32:36] it's a little bit deeper but if you have
[32:37] any questions your pastor is here to
[32:39] answer those while I do this
[32:41] [Laughter]
[32:43] so if you have a question it's almost
[32:44] like a little school room
[32:46] so you can just raise your hand
[32:48] and we'll give we'll give the pastor the
[32:51] opportunity to do that and uh perhaps if
[32:53] uh he wants to pass it on to me however
[32:55] he wants to do it that's fine but uh I'm
[32:59] going to teach something and uh this
[33:01] subject right here is another subject to
[33:05] me that validates that this message is
[33:08] right
[33:09] it validates that the word of God Is
[33:12] Right
[33:13] and it shows me that this message will
[33:16] produce what it said it would produce
[33:18] just like we were saying this morning
[33:22] if the word says it we can believe it we
[33:26] can punctuate it with an amen
[33:28] whether it materializes right intermitts
[33:31] right at that time or not we can say I
[33:33] believe it's mine
[33:34] and we stay right there until God gives
[33:36] it to us amen
[33:37] I don't know about you I believe that
[33:39] Hallelujah
[33:41] so uh Revelations 4 verse 1.
[33:46] got a lot of I got a lot of pictures
[33:47] here and I'm gonna I'm gonna run this
[33:49] right through the scripture so this
[33:51] actually has a very important Heavenly
[33:52] meaning and then it has a very important
[33:55] uh meaning for you as well if you can
[33:58] see the picture okay so it's pretty
[34:00] simple if he young has got any questions
[34:02] we'll see what we can do brother Jesse
[34:03] and ran out of the room so he's probably
[34:05] prepping up to give all the answers and
[34:07] uh
[34:09] we'll see what the Lord will do all
[34:10] right
[34:12] so this is a very powerful portion of
[34:15] Revelations here and it's very
[34:18] particular to us because this is
[34:20] following Revelations two and three
[34:22] working with the church ages right so
[34:26] and I had a sister
[34:30] amen
[34:33] it's great to see you sis
[34:35] amen so Revelations 4 1. now watch this
[34:38] here after this I looked right after the
[34:41] church ages and behold a door was opened
[34:44] in heaven and the first voice which I
[34:47] heard was as it were of a trumpet
[34:49] talking with me which said come up
[34:53] hither
[34:54] and I will shoe the things which must be
[34:58] here after so this spot right here come
[35:01] up hither
[35:03] brother Branham said that that was a
[35:05] type of the rapture
[35:07] come up hither it follows the church
[35:10] ages and what right as because what
[35:13] we're in the the very end of the seventh
[35:14] Church age
[35:15] the next thing is is we're going to meet
[35:17] him in the air come up hither okay
[35:21] and immediately I was in the spirit and
[35:24] behold a throne was set in heaven and
[35:27] one sat on the throne so I guess I could
[35:31] propose the question is that where will
[35:33] we be right after we are raptured
[35:37] we will go to the throne of God
[35:40] all right no questions for the pastor
[35:42] yet that's good
[35:44] all right
[35:46] so one more spot
[35:51] Revelations 4 6.
[35:54] well these young has got their Bibles
[35:56] out Glory wonderful
[36:06] I don't know about you I'm really
[36:07] looking forward to this you're getting
[36:08] ready to get caught right up to the
[36:09] throne of God uh but I want you to see
[36:12] that this is
[36:13] this is something that we put out here
[36:16] but if you watch the concept is
[36:18] completely through the scripture and
[36:19] that's what we're going to go into today
[36:21] with this little teaching okay
[36:23] Revelations 4 6 and it says Before the
[36:25] Throne there was a sea of glass like
[36:27] under Crystal and in the midst of the
[36:29] throne so in the middle of the throne
[36:31] that word mitts in the in the midst of a
[36:33] throne and round about the throne
[36:36] so in the middle of the throne and then
[36:38] round above the throne were four beasts
[36:41] full of eyes before and behind four
[36:46] beasts
[36:47] so if you could picture it and we'll see
[36:48] in just a minute here the actual
[36:51] visualization of what heaven looks like
[36:53] right now
[36:54] okay and it says the first Beast was
[36:57] like a lion the second beast like a calf
[36:59] the third Beast had a face as a man and
[37:02] the fourth Beast was like a flying eagle
[37:05] so how so children how many beasts were
[37:07] there
[37:08] four
[37:10] okay and the four beasts had each of
[37:12] them six wings about him and they're
[37:15] full of eyes within and they rest not
[37:17] day and night saying holy holy holy Lord
[37:21] God Almighty which was and is and is to
[37:23] come they don't even need rest you know
[37:26] why because they're in the presence of
[37:28] God
[37:28] so I wonder if we could be in the
[37:31] presence of God
[37:32] what that would do and that's what I'm
[37:34] saying that that takes away the fatigue
[37:36] how in the world could Paul dispute in a
[37:39] temple and and persuade all day long and
[37:41] then go make tents all night long
[37:45] he must have had a presence
[37:50] so worship is very key to these things
[37:53] all right so let's bow our heads forward
[37:54] a prayer and then we'll get right into
[37:56] this little teaching Lord Jesus we love
[37:58] you we appreciate this opportunity and
[37:59] Lord as we have now commanded
[38:02] by the word that you put in our mouths
[38:05] we've came in at our hands we've
[38:07] commanded our our feet we've command our
[38:10] body we've commanded our mind to come
[38:12] under subjection to this word Lord we
[38:15] pray right now God that this little
[38:17] atmosphere that we just talked about
[38:18] this heavenly place oh God would settle
[38:22] down in the midst of here Lord and that
[38:24] Lord is we want to be illuminated by Thy
[38:27] word that Lord you'd surely just bring
[38:30] us a teaching bring us an understanding
[38:32] o god of the of the Heavenly realm of
[38:35] God that we can actually put our hands
[38:37] on Lord that we can know God that that
[38:39] this is actually deeper and richer than
[38:42] we ever thought and we believe that
[38:44] you'll do it today so Lord we're just
[38:45] commending ourselves to that I pray oh
[38:47] God if it be thy will or just anoint the
[38:49] children for any questions that they
[38:50] might have and we will surely rejoice as
[38:55] the answers unfold in the name of Jesus
[38:56] Christ that church says together amen
[38:58] may be seated
[39:01] so children as I'm I'm going through
[39:03] this
[39:04] if you have any questions I think
[39:06] brother Jesse said the adults could even
[39:07] ask questions but if anyone has any
[39:09] questions just slow me down I'm going to
[39:11] try to leave my normal really quick pace
[39:14] and I'm going to slow down okay but we
[39:17] want to teach this uh the best that we
[39:21] can in order to show you the picture uh
[39:25] here in an opening slide and obviously
[39:27] you can get on the internet and find a
[39:29] lot of these things online but we find
[39:32] that that Throne scene in The Book of
[39:35] Revelations 4 it talks about how you
[39:39] have 24 Elders around the Throne of God
[39:43] and that's what John's seen right but if
[39:46] you notice here you got
[39:48] a beast here
[39:50] a beast here a beast here and a beast
[39:54] here I'm going to show you the relevance
[39:55] of this in just a minute and I'm going
[39:57] to keep unfolding it to you so you can
[39:59] see this beautiful picture that God has
[40:01] in his word but uh I want you to notice
[40:03] that God is always surrounded
[40:06] he wants
[40:08] beings angels zoons
[40:13] he wants to be surrounded by those that
[40:16] love him
[40:18] Hallelujah
[40:21] amen so you know what's our purpose is
[40:24] to surround God who loves us yes Haven
[40:29] two
[40:36] both oh pastor
[40:48] physical manifestation
[40:50] yes
[40:57] remember they're in a dimension where
[40:59] nothing oh brother Jesse
[41:02] [Laughter]
[41:04] now you have to remember like I
[41:06] mentioned this morning is that in that
[41:09] Dimension that dimension of Heaven is
[41:10] there bore is there boredom there
[41:13] so let me ask you another question is
[41:15] there any uh fatigue or tiredness there
[41:17] no so they can actually you know like
[41:20] how we would worship Oh Glory to God you
[41:22] know I command my feet and we're there's
[41:24] nothing to hinder that in them so it's
[41:28] just part of the dimension that they're
[41:30] in is they can keep on without any
[41:34] negative thing to slow them down they
[41:35] just keep and stay in that atmosphere to
[41:37] worship okay
[41:39] all right now I got a lot to say about
[41:41] this so uh I'm going to answer that
[41:44] question too okay
[41:46] so I want to show you what
[41:48] remember we're going to be working with
[41:49] four thrown guards okay
[41:52] so here is actually probably the closest
[41:56] depiction of what those four beasts that
[41:59] surrounded the throne are okay
[42:01] you notice we have calf's feet
[42:05] you notice we have six wings just like
[42:08] seraphim
[42:09] okay and what we notice is that each
[42:12] Beast had four heads
[42:15] and within that we have here children
[42:17] what do we have here
[42:18] a lion what do we have here a man what
[42:21] do we have back here Ox good job what do
[42:24] we have there Eagle I gotta end with the
[42:26] eagle
[42:27] okay but uh it says God has four Throne
[42:30] guards in his kingdom these are uh the
[42:33] lion the ox man Eagle as stated in
[42:36] Revelations 4 7 and Ezekiel 1 10. uh
[42:39] catch the Revelation regarding these
[42:40] beasts notice that these four beasts are
[42:42] represented in heaven
[42:44] that's what we're talking about in
[42:45] heaven
[42:46] and also in the Old Testament and in the
[42:48] New Testament and even in the new Heaven
[42:51] and Earth uh they now what do they do
[42:53] they raise up God's standards against
[42:56] the devil in every generation of the
[42:58] seven Church ages okay and we won't talk
[43:00] too much about that
[43:01] um but we're going to lay out the
[43:03] pattern so if you can see the pattern
[43:06] then you can really see how this affects
[43:07] you okay
[43:15] yep yep
[43:19] yep but now
[43:21] um and and this is just my my
[43:23] presumption Pastor helped me if you
[43:24] differ but uh it is denoted in the Book
[43:27] of Revelations that each one had a
[43:30] different face forward
[43:31] as far as you have an eagle you have an
[43:34] ox you have a man and you have uh of
[43:37] course the lion so I would say by
[43:41] looking at the scripture that it denotes
[43:44] that
[43:46] um specifically what each one had but
[43:48] yet they all had all four so I guess in
[43:51] that idea is that this one have this but
[43:53] you go to the next one and he would have
[43:54] the man perhaps now that's just a
[43:57] presumption because but I'm just doing
[43:58] that by the scripture as far as how it
[44:00] denotes each one had a different one but
[44:02] yet all had all four
[44:14] which I'm going to
[44:15] [Laughter]
[44:19] good job pastor
[44:24] so another picture of the Throne of God
[44:26] very quickly here
[44:28] um and this is uh brother Ron malevo and
[44:31] there you have the throne scene you have
[44:32] 24 Elders surrounding can I ask the
[44:36] children
[44:37] you want your question first and mine to
[44:39] you
[44:44] yes
[44:45] yes
[44:46] and that's that's what we're getting
[44:48] ready to show very good very good how
[44:50] did you know that glory to God
[44:52] great
[44:54] um so in having each Beast stands for
[44:58] something okay they're surrounding the
[45:00] throne and of course they're called The
[45:02] Throne guards so if they're called a
[45:04] throne guard what are they actually
[45:05] doing
[45:06] they're guarding the throne okay
[45:09] now watch uh back in the Book of Ezekiel
[45:13] a little bit of reading here but here it
[45:15] is as your pastor denoted here in
[45:18] Ezekiel 1 4 it says and I looked and
[45:20] behold a whirlwind came out of the out
[45:23] of the North a great Cloud I like that
[45:26] came out of the north north is where Dan
[45:28] was right and a fire unfolding itself
[45:30] and a brightness was about it and out of
[45:33] the midst thereof as the color of amber
[45:36] out of the midst of the fire what does
[45:39] the amber color represent of course we
[45:41] realized that was a pillar of fire okay
[45:44] so ezekiel's having uh this unfold him
[45:47] in the spiritual realm he's seeing all
[45:49] these things coming forth he sees the
[45:51] Amber Pillar of Fire coming out okay now
[45:54] here's the thing did that pillar Fire
[45:56] come by itself let's see it says also
[45:58] out of the midst thereof came the
[46:00] likeness of four living creatures
[46:03] so notice that Amber Pillar of Fire
[46:06] was once again just like in the scene of
[46:09] Heaven surrounded
[46:11] okay now watch this
[46:13] and uh came four living creatures and
[46:15] this was their appearance that they had
[46:17] the likeness of a man and everyone had
[46:19] four faces and everyone had four wings
[46:22] and their feet were straight feet and
[46:25] the sole of their feet was like the soul
[46:27] of a calf's foot that's where we get a
[46:29] cast foot and they sparkled like the
[46:31] color of burnished brass and they had
[46:33] the hands of a man under their wings on
[46:36] their four sides
[46:39] and they forehead their faces and their
[46:41] wings their wings were joined one to
[46:43] another they turned not when they went
[46:46] and they went everyone straight forward
[46:48] I want you to see this so when when this
[46:51] Entourage if I could say it like that
[46:52] was guarding God they didn't get
[46:55] distracted by anything
[46:57] they never turned aside
[47:01] it says right there they turned not when
[47:03] when they went they didn't get
[47:04] distracted by anything they had one
[47:06] Mission and that was to surround God
[47:11] Hallelujah now if you think about it
[47:13] that's why we are not to be distracted
[47:17] we are supposed to go straight forward
[47:19] with Jesus Christ remember if you would
[47:22] look at the type or think about the type
[47:24] you have Elijah and Elisha
[47:26] Elisha had to have his eyes solely on
[47:29] Elijah which was a type of Christ he
[47:32] could not turn any other way but he had
[47:36] to keep his eyes solely on Elijah or a
[47:39] type of Christ The Bride In Christ and
[47:41] what following that then he would get
[47:44] the double portion blessing Okay so
[47:48] he says and for the likeness of their
[47:49] faces the four had the face of a man the
[47:52] face of a lion on the right side and
[47:54] they forehead the face of an ox on the
[47:55] left side they four also had the face of
[47:57] an eagle okay so perhaps that was the
[47:58] the normal faces thus were their faces
[48:01] and their wings were stretched upwards
[48:03] two wings of everyone and were joined
[48:05] one to another and two covered their
[48:07] bodies and they went everyone straight
[48:09] forward there it is again
[48:11] wither the spirit was to go they went
[48:14] and they turned not when they went all
[48:16] right so wherever the spirit went they
[48:19] went
[48:21] I want you to see this
[48:22] God
[48:23] has always left the witness
[48:26] that he has guards around him
[48:28] this is what I want you to see because
[48:30] you're going to find out pretty quick
[48:31] that this actually comes really close to
[48:33] home okay there's another rendition or
[48:36] idea of what that might be as depicted
[48:39] um
[48:40] I can't wait to see it I don't know
[48:42] about you it's going to be a really good
[48:44] time
[48:46] so we see the setup and here remember it
[48:49] was stated by brother Ron there that in
[48:52] the Old Testament this was seen okay
[48:56] so when they had the Tabernacle they
[49:00] were surrounded by four tribes
[49:03] so you have Reuben to the South
[49:05] Judah to the east
[49:07] Ephraim to the west and then Dan to the
[49:11] north now I'm going to show you another
[49:12] picture in a second here and how God
[49:15] orchestrated that in the wilderness he
[49:17] had them surrounding the Tabernacle
[49:21] so think about it so in heaven God has
[49:24] four surrounding when God would leave
[49:26] Heaven as a pillar of fire those four
[49:28] went with him they turned out they just
[49:30] surrounded him to be his guards and here
[49:33] now God has the Tabernacle with the
[49:35] outer Court the holy place and the
[49:37] holies of holies and once again he
[49:39] surrounds himself
[49:41] by four tribes if you look in the
[49:42] Scripture it says to the north to the
[49:44] South to the East and to the West were
[49:46] these tribes now
[49:48] let's show you how amazing this is
[49:51] when God said that they would be to
[49:53] north south east and west he also gave
[49:56] the numbers of the people in the tribes
[50:00] okay here you have your Tabernacle of
[50:03] course they're surrounded by the
[50:04] gershonites the koathites and the
[50:06] marathites marathites but notice the
[50:10] numbers that were given in the scripture
[50:12] so dance to the north so Judas to the
[50:15] east but look to the east you have 186
[50:18] 000. watch the ratio
[50:21] okay to the north yet Dan 157. to the
[50:25] that's the north so the South was 151.
[50:28] so almost equal this way and then down
[50:31] here there's 30 000 more
[50:33] and then to the North or to the excuse
[50:35] me to the it's East West to the West Was
[50:37] 108 000.
[50:39] you almost have perfectly set up
[50:43] the cross
[50:46] but notice God didn't have them to the
[50:48] Northwest he had him to the north he had
[50:50] him to the South came to the East and to
[50:52] the West
[50:53] so you see that God actually surrounded
[50:55] so wait what was in there the Ark of the
[50:58] Covenant
[50:59] what was there God
[51:02] so God guarded himself
[51:05] with the 12 tribes of Israel north south
[51:09] east and west
[51:10] but
[51:12] what does that look like
[51:14] the cross
[51:17] so Jesus even shown the same picture
[51:21] when he was on the cross
[51:25] so even as he come to his crucifixion
[51:28] he showed that what would he was
[51:31] surrounded by the wood
[51:34] and the ordered church right so
[51:38] this is pretty phenomenal if you ask me
[51:40] but so you see in the Old Testament what
[51:42] was it
[51:43] God always had to be guarded
[51:48] okay
[51:49] let's continue
[51:51] you see that children
[51:52] that's pretty neat huh so in heaven he's
[51:55] like that on Earth he's like that when
[51:57] he's on a cross he was like that
[51:59] is that all
[52:00] right even says no there's more
[52:05] when the ark remember the Tabernacle you
[52:08] would take it down
[52:10] you would take the ark and the Ark would
[52:13] have to be what it couldn't be carried
[52:14] on a new cart which is a type of
[52:15] denomination
[52:17] it actually had to be carried on the
[52:18] shoulders of the priest so God made the
[52:21] ark to have staves through it
[52:24] how many priests were to carry it
[52:27] four
[52:28] were three on this side one on this side
[52:30] no it was equally spread that there
[52:33] would be four guards around that Ark so
[52:37] where was this that was the presence of
[52:40] God was there
[52:41] yeah right the presence of God was so
[52:43] strong in there that Joshua could send
[52:46] the art through the Jordan River and it
[52:47] would split the river just like Moses
[52:50] did with the Red Sea
[52:52] the ark could do that the ark was a type
[52:54] of what the word
[52:56] who is the word god
[52:59] so he's always guarded by four
[53:04] okay
[53:07] that's neat I wonder if there's any more
[53:11] is that called irony
[53:15] we'll see what the prophet says in the
[53:17] fifth seal he says now one of those
[53:19] creatures we find out in studying the
[53:22] Revelation in the churches that one of
[53:25] them had was the lion the other was Ox
[53:27] the other was a man the other was an
[53:29] eagle we find out in the church ages
[53:32] that those four beasts meaning four
[53:35] powers was gathered around the acts of
[53:38] the Apostle just the way that the
[53:41] Tabernacle in the wilderness okay so the
[53:45] things that we just seen in the Old
[53:46] Testament
[53:47] that actually continued on into the New
[53:51] Testament
[53:52] okay
[53:55] now
[53:56] let's see where we go next let's read
[53:58] another one okay
[54:00] we'll add a little bit more momentarily
[54:02] it says now we find out that there were
[54:05] the guards to The Mercy Seat
[54:08] they watched The Mercy Seat and nothing
[54:11] come to it
[54:13] it crossed over the tribes first before
[54:16] it could get to The Mercy Seat so
[54:18] nothing could ever get near The Mercy
[54:22] Seat
[54:23] I want you to see this because there's
[54:25] nothing that can get near The Mercy Seat
[54:28] in your life
[54:29] that's the way God made this amen
[54:32] amen what does that mean that means you
[54:33] can always believe in the blood of
[54:34] Christ Jesus Christ
[54:36] the sacrifice the atonement has been
[54:39] made and there's nothing that can touch
[54:42] it
[54:43] you can always believe in the blood see
[54:46] you can fail all the time
[54:48] but that Mercy Seat can never be touched
[54:53] that's why the Bible says if any man
[54:55] fail the grace of God
[54:59] you have to fail the grace
[55:02] well how much will he gives he just
[55:03] keeps on giving it until you what
[55:05] you've forfeited you have to forfeit
[55:08] your rights to it
[55:10] that's why there's gonna be a lot of
[55:11] surprises on the Judgment Day
[55:14] because there'll be a lot of people that
[55:16] didn't forfeit that all right
[55:19] so it says every man willing to give his
[55:22] life every Israelite and Camp would die
[55:25] before anything could enter into that
[55:27] camp over there and take that mercy seat
[55:30] and now we find out that that was the
[55:33] Old Testament order
[55:35] in the New Testament
[55:38] order in the New Testament order we find
[55:41] the same thing that it was guarded The
[55:44] Mercy Seat so there's a mercy seat in
[55:47] the New Testament too
[55:49] okay
[55:50] he says oh I hope you get you get it The
[55:52] Mercy Seat is still guarded
[55:55] still got guards
[55:57] okay
[55:58] we found out that those guards are
[56:01] Matthew Mark Luke and John
[56:04] guarding the book of Acts
[56:08] hmm
[56:09] and the acts of the Holy Spirit done
[56:12] amongst the apostles which is the book
[56:14] of Acts of the new Test new of the New
[56:16] Testament and the four writers of the
[56:19] Gospel Matthew Mark Luke and John all
[56:21] guard The Mercy Seat to show that it is
[56:24] God the Holy Spirit today each scripture
[56:28] Matthew Mark Luke and John every one of
[56:31] them will back up the true Gospel of the
[56:34] Lord Jesus Christ and the acts of the
[56:36] Holy Spirit
[56:38] that's when you know the message is real
[56:43] so in the New Testament
[56:46] we still have
[56:50] now we'll get to this in just a second
[56:51] but notice we have John
[56:55] mark
[56:57] Matthew
[56:58] and Luke
[57:00] we still have guards in the New
[57:02] Testament
[57:03] now
[57:04] notice here the Holy Spirit baptism
[57:07] okay so it's still surrounded
[57:11] but now God is taking residence
[57:14] somewhere else in in the Old Testament
[57:17] children
[57:19] did God actually fill as far as the Holy
[57:22] Ghost baptism into the people
[57:24] the sacrifice was not made yet so I
[57:26] would say no
[57:29] I know it's a little bit deep
[57:30] [Laughter]
[57:32] so
[57:33] let's look here
[57:35] so in the New Testament there are still
[57:38] four guards
[57:41] but remember
[57:42] they always say well it's the Acts of
[57:44] the Apostles but it's not the Acts of
[57:46] the Apostles it's actually the acts of
[57:48] the Holy Spirit
[57:51] so now in the New Testament we actually
[57:54] find that the acts of the Holy Spirit
[57:57] are guarded to the north south east and
[57:59] west
[58:00] and what does it guard the gospels guard
[58:04] the book of Acts
[58:08] you ever wonder why there's four Gospels
[58:11] that's why
[58:13] God made four Gospels
[58:16] because God always had to be guarded
[58:21] but where was God actually seen here
[58:25] the book of Acts
[58:27] that's what he's trying to guard here
[58:28] okay now obviously what was made
[58:31] manifest
[58:32] in those gospels Jesus Christ
[58:35] but now he was bridging from the Old
[58:38] Testament become the sacrifice and what
[58:40] he was trying to do was enter into the
[58:42] next part of the work
[58:46] which is
[58:48] and when we went and got the gospels and
[58:50] show exactly when you enter into the ark
[58:54] they was guarding the ark the Covenant
[58:56] and then we find out that the Covenant
[58:58] of the new church its representation on
[59:01] Earth was the Holy Spirit so what's
[59:04] Jesus doing remember he was coming as
[59:05] the Lamb of God to become the sacrifice
[59:08] but what was the purpose of that
[59:09] remember he said it's expedient that I
[59:11] go away so the comforter can come to you
[59:15] I'm going to show you something here
[59:16] okay that's why I love this this message
[59:18] beautiful he says and four beasts
[59:21] represented as the 12 tribes of Israel
[59:22] as it washed and find their natures and
[59:25] take in that same nature and bring it to
[59:27] each one of those four gospels remember
[59:32] if we had time we could go through and
[59:34] show you that the the four main tribes
[59:36] that actually went around the Tabernacle
[59:38] they all had emblems
[59:41] and you know what they were it was the
[59:44] lion the ox the man and the eagle
[59:48] it was the same emblems in the Old
[59:50] Testament
[59:51] to what we would find were the faces
[59:54] of literally
[59:56] what we'd see in the Throne of Heaven by
[59:58] the Beast okay so it says and taking the
[1:00:01] same nature bring each one to the four
[1:00:02] gospels exactly was exactly the same one
[1:00:05] talk to the lion the other the ox the
[1:00:07] other the four Gospels
[1:00:10] looks like my slide messed up on me here
[1:00:12] there it is the four Gospels
[1:00:15] are the guards I believe it says in the
[1:00:17] guards to the acts of the Holy Spirit
[1:00:20] okay so let's continue
[1:00:23] so the gospels protect the acts of the
[1:00:27] Holy Spirit now we're saying something
[1:00:28] now
[1:00:30] the gospels actually protect the book of
[1:00:34] Acts well who does the book of Acts
[1:00:36] belong to
[1:00:41] you can say me
[1:00:45] so now I wonder
[1:00:48] where God is
[1:00:57] now how do they guard the book of Acts
[1:01:01] how these gospels going to guard that
[1:01:05] Revelations chapter 4 3 he says the
[1:01:08] framework Pentecost wasn't the framework
[1:01:13] of the Gospels
[1:01:15] the four Gospels
[1:01:18] are the framework to back Pentecost
[1:01:23] so the gospels actually guard
[1:01:26] the acts of the Holy Spirit okay now
[1:01:29] watch this it says after they had this
[1:01:31] framework up Pentecost become into
[1:01:34] existence
[1:01:36] so without those gospels coming first
[1:01:39] you say well start in the New Testament
[1:01:41] well what do you have you have the four
[1:01:42] books Matthew Mark Luke and John
[1:01:45] and then what
[1:01:47] and the acts of the Holy Spirit
[1:01:49] okay
[1:01:50] he says is that right which was wrote
[1:01:53] first the book of Acts or the apostles
[1:01:55] the apostles were right so Jesus walked
[1:01:58] along doing works and predicting what
[1:02:00] would come
[1:02:01] and Matthew Mark Luke and John them four
[1:02:05] guards come and was writing everything
[1:02:07] they seen coming to pass telling it just
[1:02:10] like it is how it was going to happen
[1:02:13] what was going to take place then all at
[1:02:16] once they framed it around and here it
[1:02:19] come you see why Jesus said the things
[1:02:22] he did
[1:02:23] because the things that he said would
[1:02:26] actually what he was setting the
[1:02:29] framework of what the acts of the Holy
[1:02:31] Spirit would be right it says Matthew
[1:02:33] Mark Luke and John is the framework or
[1:02:36] the guard work that protects watch this
[1:02:39] the main Temple
[1:02:42] the throne
[1:02:44] the Pentecostal blessing
[1:02:48] so first we have what in the New
[1:02:50] Testament we have the four gospels
[1:02:51] Matthew Mark Luke and John and what do
[1:02:54] they surround the acts of the Holy
[1:02:55] Spirit but now he's saying
[1:02:58] that Matthew Mark Luke and John they
[1:03:01] actually guard the main Temple the
[1:03:04] throne and what does he call that
[1:03:06] the Pentecostal blessing
[1:03:08] which is what the baptism of the Holy
[1:03:11] Ghost
[1:03:16] now we sing that song no ye not know ye
[1:03:19] not ye are a temple
[1:03:23] know ye not know ye not ER Temple is
[1:03:26] that just a song or is that a scripture
[1:03:28] the scripture
[1:03:30] scripture
[1:03:31] you are a temple
[1:03:34] so there was a temple in the Old
[1:03:35] Testament
[1:03:36] but who's the temple in the New
[1:03:37] Testament
[1:03:39] you are
[1:03:48] yep yep that's what the Pentecostal so
[1:03:50] it's the acts of the Holy Spirit
[1:03:52] so as the Holy Spirit working through
[1:03:54] those people and what you were going to
[1:03:56] show you is how Matthew Mark Luke and
[1:03:59] John
[1:04:01] how they guard that blessing okay
[1:04:03] so it's it's all got to work together so
[1:04:06] now if you are
[1:04:08] the temple of God
[1:04:10] where did your Prophet say the The Mercy
[1:04:12] Seat was at now
[1:04:18] now how could The Mercy Seat be there
[1:04:21] because The Mercy Seat is where God is
[1:04:24] see we we under emphasize what the
[1:04:28] baptism of the Holy Ghost is
[1:04:30] okay
[1:04:33] so girls
[1:04:34] sisters
[1:04:38] when you get the baptism of the Holy
[1:04:39] Ghost where does that put God
[1:04:42] man look at that
[1:04:44] did you just get that because I said
[1:04:46] that you already knew that
[1:04:50] do it you do it well taught
[1:04:55] so if you're the temple of God
[1:04:57] you have a holies of holies where God
[1:05:00] wants to live and that's inside of you
[1:05:02] now in the Old Testament
[1:05:04] what could happen in the holies of
[1:05:06] holies
[1:05:07] God would what meet them there just like
[1:05:10] that song
[1:05:12] God would meet them there he said I will
[1:05:14] commune with you there so where does God
[1:05:16] communion where does he want to commune
[1:05:18] with you
[1:05:21] inside but wait a minute
[1:05:22] that's the Pentecostal blessing and he's
[1:05:25] in the temple of you
[1:05:27] then how
[1:05:29] can these guard you
[1:05:33] that's what we want to know
[1:05:35] so these gospels will actually guard you
[1:05:39] now what are these gospels where what
[1:05:42] are they represented doing
[1:05:44] bringing forth the word
[1:05:52] now watch this
[1:05:54] so we know in the New Testament that
[1:05:56] there was an order
[1:05:57] that these beasts would live out through
[1:05:59] the seven Church ages right they would
[1:06:02] live out in that same order
[1:06:04] now I found this absolutely amazing
[1:06:07] because when I looked up the names and
[1:06:09] what the meaning of the name meant
[1:06:11] so the Book of Matthew
[1:06:14] your Prophet said was the lion
[1:06:16] you know what Matthew means gift of the
[1:06:19] Lord
[1:06:21] the baptism of the Holy Ghost which was
[1:06:24] the first age where the Holy Ghost fell
[1:06:27] out upon them
[1:06:31] now remember the seven Church ages are
[1:06:34] also represented
[1:06:37] by a fixture or a furnishing
[1:06:40] in the Tabernacle on the temple
[1:06:43] you girls no no let me give you a hint
[1:06:46] so there's actually a piece of furniture
[1:06:48] that was in the temple in the Tabernacle
[1:06:52] that had seven in it kind of like that
[1:06:55] can you tell me what that was
[1:06:58] the seven golden candlesticks
[1:07:00] which represent the seven Church ages
[1:07:04] yeah now now let me ask you
[1:07:06] um
[1:07:07] yes now they're golden candlesticks so
[1:07:10] what were they supposed to do
[1:07:13] they're supposed to be lit all day long
[1:07:15] was the fire supposed to be extinguished
[1:07:17] no no but it was supposed to burn
[1:07:19] continually burning and what would that
[1:07:21] show
[1:07:23] because what was it what was it actually
[1:07:25] burning
[1:07:28] oh
[1:07:31] oil which was a type of the
[1:07:33] Holy Ghost now did the seventh did the
[1:07:35] seventh arm in the menorah and the Seven
[1:07:37] golden candlesticks did that just go out
[1:07:39] and there was no fire there
[1:07:41] no did they skip the seventh for the
[1:07:42] perfect type that that laodicea would be
[1:07:45] would be completely extinguished of
[1:07:46] flame not at all
[1:07:49] every single arm burnt the fire
[1:07:54] Hallelujah you can't say the fourth
[1:07:56] Church age didn't burn the fire it
[1:07:58] burned the fire
[1:08:00] but it burnt the fire according
[1:08:03] to what the anointing was over the age
[1:08:05] because this also shows what would
[1:08:08] combat
[1:08:10] the Antichrist rolling out over those
[1:08:12] ages so Matthew actually means gift of
[1:08:15] the Lord which the Holy Ghost was the
[1:08:18] gift of the Lord okay
[1:08:22] I found this interesting this is a
[1:08:24] little bit of
[1:08:25] information but
[1:08:28] it says in Easton's dictionary he says
[1:08:30] the one aim pervading the whole book
[1:08:32] is uh and this is Matthew is the show
[1:08:34] that Jesus is he of whom Moses in the
[1:08:37] law and the prophets did right this
[1:08:39] gospel contains no fewer than 65
[1:08:42] references to the Old Testament 43 of
[1:08:45] these being direct verbal citations thus
[1:08:47] greatly outnumbering those found found
[1:08:50] in the other gospels the main feature of
[1:08:53] this gospel may be expressed in the
[1:08:56] motto I am not come to destroy but to
[1:09:00] fulfill
[1:09:02] okay so the purpose of the Gospel of
[1:09:05] Matthew is to show that Jesus come to
[1:09:08] fulfill the what the whole law in giving
[1:09:13] the Holy Ghost now here's an interesting
[1:09:15] graph if you see it I want you to notice
[1:09:17] there's only three of the gospels here
[1:09:19] there's a reason for that
[1:09:21] but if you can see what it's saying uh
[1:09:23] the relationships between the synoptic
[1:09:25] gospels you can see that Mark and Luke
[1:09:29] they agree in one percent right but yet
[1:09:33] unique they have three percent yo Mark
[1:09:36] has three percent but uh the tradition
[1:09:38] that they carry with each other uh you
[1:09:40] know 70 76 percent of Mark is in these
[1:09:42] two other gospels so they all work
[1:09:45] together but they have a double
[1:09:46] tradition and then they have something
[1:09:48] unique there so they all work together
[1:09:51] you see it's the same word but yet
[1:09:54] there's an expression that each book is
[1:09:57] actually trying to show okay
[1:10:00] um so Matthew's main point is to show
[1:10:03] that Jesus Christ come to fulfill all of
[1:10:05] it
[1:10:06] Hallelujah and to do what what did it
[1:10:08] end up doing he fulfilled it all
[1:10:10] so he could become all to you
[1:10:12] he could fill you the gift of the Lord
[1:10:15] the baptism Holy Ghost
[1:10:18] let's move to Mark Matthew mark
[1:10:21] when you look up
[1:10:23] the meaning of Mark Mark's name means a
[1:10:26] defense
[1:10:28] it was one of the evangelists probably
[1:10:30] the author of The Gospel of Mark it says
[1:10:32] Mark was likely written from Rome to
[1:10:34] Romans but more broadly Gentiles the
[1:10:37] purpose of the Gospel is to present
[1:10:39] Jesus Christ to Gentiles and to
[1:10:40] encourage Believers to endure and
[1:10:43] persevere persevere in the face of
[1:10:45] persecution and perhaps even martyrdom
[1:10:48] you know what that's amazing
[1:10:50] because
[1:10:52] that's the ox
[1:10:56] brother Bram said that that was the
[1:10:58] defense
[1:11:00] that's and what does the name Mark mean
[1:11:01] defense
[1:11:03] defense amazing
[1:11:05] that's how Supernatural this Bible is
[1:11:09] it works perfectly
[1:11:11] it says Mark was apparently more
[1:11:13] impressed by the mighty works that Jesus
[1:11:14] performed by the content of Jesus
[1:11:17] teaching
[1:11:18] uh more than half of Mark's gospel is
[1:11:20] devoted to giving an account of the
[1:11:22] remarkable Deeds that Jesus performed
[1:11:24] many of these Deeds dealt with Healing
[1:11:26] The Sick all right so that Ox anointing
[1:11:30] we can see it ties right in with the
[1:11:32] Book of Mark it was a defense so first
[1:11:34] you have the lion which was the baptism
[1:11:36] of holy ghost pulling out on that age
[1:11:38] and then what then it moved to the ox
[1:11:41] when remember when the Antichrist Spirit
[1:11:43] comes out as a red horse rider it's
[1:11:46] blood
[1:11:47] so brother Bram said he said they
[1:11:48] couldn't do anything but
[1:11:50] go and run and give their lives for the
[1:11:53] gospel's saved they because that's what
[1:11:54] the ox does now I have one sermon on
[1:11:56] each one of these so I'm just hitting a
[1:11:58] few highlights okay but you can see that
[1:12:01] that's what the ox does the ox labors
[1:12:04] and then it gives its life that's what
[1:12:06] it's always done
[1:12:08] ties right in with Mark
[1:12:10] now watch this
[1:12:12] Luke
[1:12:13] guess what the name Luke means
[1:12:18] to illuminate
[1:12:22] it means light giving
[1:12:25] so Luke
[1:12:27] was the man age
[1:12:30] or with the man anointing
[1:12:32] first Thessalonians 5 4 but ye Brethren
[1:12:35] are not in darkness that the day should
[1:12:37] overtake you as a thief ye are all the
[1:12:40] children of light and the children of
[1:12:41] the day we are not of the night nor of
[1:12:45] the darkness
[1:12:47] so Luke's Luke's day uh the Gospel of
[1:12:51] Luke represents the man age all right
[1:12:54] that's that's your that's your Luther
[1:12:56] that's your Wesley and the name itself
[1:12:59] actually means to illuminate
[1:13:03] it's pretty deep stuff but but you see
[1:13:05] you see how it ties in real good yeah
[1:13:07] yeah you can't make that up that's a
[1:13:08] dictionary
[1:13:11] so now watch
[1:13:13] so what was Saint Luke what was so
[1:13:16] ironic about the the book of Saint Luke
[1:13:17] does anybody know before you look at the
[1:13:19] slide let me hide it does anybody know
[1:13:22] I know Pastor knows
[1:13:24] Luke was a book of
[1:13:27] parables
[1:13:30] the most Parables of any of the Gospel
[1:13:34] between 24 to 40 depending on what view
[1:13:38] you take
[1:13:39] so Luke is completely full
[1:13:42] of parables
[1:13:46] a parable is it's a story that's coming
[1:13:50] out uh
[1:13:52] like like the wise and the fools version
[1:13:54] it's saying something
[1:13:56] but there's a meaning behind it but it
[1:13:58] actually takes the supernatural
[1:14:00] revelation of Jesus Christ to show what
[1:14:02] it was like his disciples his disciples
[1:14:04] said you know Jesus why do you always
[1:14:06] speak in parables he said because it's
[1:14:08] for your eyes to see
[1:14:10] so he had to give them an illumination
[1:14:14] through the stories that he told you
[1:14:17] might remember that in the in uh also in
[1:14:20] in the Book of Luke that Jesus would
[1:14:22] tell Parables and the Pharisees said
[1:14:24] they perceived that Jesus talked about
[1:14:25] them
[1:14:28] and what they want to kill him because
[1:14:30] they didn't fully understand all of it
[1:14:33] but he was speaking about evil things
[1:14:34] and they in evil people and they knew
[1:14:36] that it was them
[1:14:39] so so but they couldn't they couldn't
[1:14:41] catch the the idea of it in order to
[1:14:44] repent
[1:14:45] and get right with God
[1:14:47] so Luke was actually a book full of
[1:14:50] Mysteries full of uh of of an
[1:14:54] illumination of the depths of the word
[1:14:57] right
[1:14:59] in Matthew 13 10 it says the disciples
[1:15:01] came and said unto him why speaketh thou
[1:15:03] unto them in Parables he answered and
[1:15:06] said unto them because it is given unto
[1:15:08] you to know the mysteries of the kingdom
[1:15:09] of heaven but to them
[1:15:11] it is not given so it was remember you
[1:15:15] have lion ox and now man
[1:15:18] what was Luther Luther and Wesley's ages
[1:15:21] they were ages where the illumination of
[1:15:24] the Reformation came out
[1:15:26] and they begin to what they won they won
[1:15:29] they got Bibles
[1:15:31] and then they were anointed to dig into
[1:15:33] the depths of that word and to start
[1:15:35] bringing out
[1:15:37] ideas right
[1:15:40] it's a man age
[1:15:43] then lastly
[1:15:45] we have John
[1:15:49] what does John mean
[1:15:52] so remember Matthew means the gift of
[1:15:55] the Lord
[1:15:58] but John means Jehovah's gift it's a
[1:16:02] type of the eagle
[1:16:04] it means the grace or mercy of the Lord
[1:16:07] so the grace and the mercy of the Lord
[1:16:09] remember brother Branson he said he said
[1:16:11] Grace provided Israel a prophet Moses
[1:16:14] Grace gave them blood
[1:16:17] so Grace would actually bring forth the
[1:16:21] eagle okay
[1:16:23] now watch
[1:16:25] in 55 1004 come let us reason he says
[1:16:28] now that's when a person operated the
[1:16:30] gift of God now listen it's not me
[1:16:34] that needs to be for you
[1:16:36] brother Branch it's not me that needs to
[1:16:38] be for you
[1:16:40] now I'm fixing the Closing Services just
[1:16:42] in a night or two start praying for sick
[1:16:44] and it never do me I've never been I
[1:16:47] don't know nothing about it it's your
[1:16:50] faith in God
[1:16:52] that says the same thing now watch what
[1:16:54] he says it's a gift of God
[1:16:59] I'm not God's gift
[1:17:04] brother Branham was not God's gift
[1:17:09] that light
[1:17:10] an angel that you see the pictures of
[1:17:14] the pillar of Fire
[1:17:17] he said the scientific world now all
[1:17:19] over the world Germany United States
[1:17:20] everywhere took the picture of it
[1:17:22] that's God's
[1:17:24] gift
[1:17:26] so the eagle would be anointed by the
[1:17:30] pillar of fire in this day and age right
[1:17:32] but what was the Eagle's role
[1:17:35] the eagle remember it can Fly Above All
[1:17:39] the pressures of the world
[1:17:43] Hallelujah it has eyes that can it can
[1:17:46] be so high but it can see everything
[1:17:48] down there yes
[1:17:58] Pastor is the eagle God
[1:18:04] foreign
[1:18:09] good good question wonderful
[1:18:14] so that's God's gift
[1:18:15] so what is God's gift
[1:18:18] you see that's why you can never Focus
[1:18:20] or make the flesh man
[1:18:24] you're absolute
[1:18:25] his Humanity
[1:18:29] it has to be what
[1:18:31] this discern within our lives what is
[1:18:35] God and what is man
[1:18:38] because when the man talks that's not
[1:18:40] God's gift
[1:18:43] right that might be God's Prophet but
[1:18:44] that's not God's gift
[1:18:47] God's gift
[1:18:49] no can God's Gift fail it cannot fail
[1:18:53] because it's God
[1:18:55] so it comes upon us to receive what the
[1:19:00] word of the Lord remember what what is
[1:19:02] the message to us and correct me if you
[1:19:04] have a different idea pastor but but to
[1:19:06] me what the message is
[1:19:10] it is the revelation of the word of God
[1:19:13] to us in this hour
[1:19:15] that's what the message is it's the word
[1:19:17] of God the finishing of the Mysteries
[1:19:21] thank God God what he can only reveal
[1:19:23] the word through a prophet
[1:19:26] but he never said Focus or worship the
[1:19:29] prophet
[1:19:30] brother Braham said he said this is to
[1:19:32] take you back to the word
[1:19:34] because the word cannot fail
[1:19:36] right we got preachers leaving the
[1:19:38] message why do they leave a message
[1:19:39] because they're focused on a man
[1:19:40] he's a failure like they are
[1:19:44] right don't look at me I'm gonna fail
[1:19:47] you
[1:19:48] just ask my church
[1:19:51] but I can't be everything to them I
[1:19:53] can't be their God
[1:19:54] I wasn't made to be their god brother
[1:19:56] Jesse's not made to be your God God is
[1:19:58] made to be your God
[1:19:59] so you follow him as he follows Christ
[1:20:02] Hallelujah but who are you following
[1:20:03] Christ
[1:20:04] it's Christ in him the hope of glory
[1:20:07] amen and what he's following what he's
[1:20:09] eating of a pasture you are eating of a
[1:20:12] pasture the same pasture right
[1:20:14] hallelujah it's not to receive a pastor
[1:20:17] Spirit but it's to receive the spirit of
[1:20:20] God in the pastor that same Holy Ghost
[1:20:22] he has you should have amen and that's
[1:20:24] that's what brother Brandon
[1:20:25] distinguished
[1:20:26] because he showed that people actually
[1:20:28] receive the pastor if the pastor's a big
[1:20:30] Joker everybody in the church is going
[1:20:32] to be a big Joker if the pastor is a
[1:20:34] foolish Jester he's always he's joking
[1:20:36] but he's always ripping on people and
[1:20:37] doing things like that watch the church
[1:20:38] the church will do the same thing and
[1:20:39] they'll make excuses why they're like
[1:20:41] that
[1:20:42] or if he's really intellectual
[1:20:43] there's no spirit of God moving on him
[1:20:45] the whole church will be that way that's
[1:20:47] why when you look in the message you'll
[1:20:48] see that there's a Teaching Ministry
[1:20:50] well generally if the people are not
[1:20:53] receiving the teaching and they're
[1:20:54] receiving the man
[1:20:56] they will just sit in your chairs and
[1:20:58] this
[1:20:59] amen and just walk away because here's
[1:21:02] the thing it doesn't matter which one of
[1:21:04] the five-fold ministry gifts you have
[1:21:07] to bring the Holy Ghost down
[1:21:09] they'll all bring the Holy Ghost down
[1:21:16] so Jehovah's gift
[1:21:19] was what
[1:21:22] Hallelujah as Pastor answered
[1:21:26] I feel good because that's exactly what
[1:21:27] I was gonna say
[1:21:30] it was that pillar
[1:21:32] it was God's presence coming down to the
[1:21:37] people amen
[1:21:39] Hallelujah you know it's like uh I was
[1:21:41] talking brother Jesse and he said he's
[1:21:42] working with Azusa Street
[1:21:44] yes
[1:21:52] if they're
[1:21:54] born again if they're born again they're
[1:21:56] supposed to
[1:21:57] but that's the thing I mean are they are
[1:21:59] they just a message believer or have
[1:22:01] they received the Holy Ghost of that
[1:22:03] message
[1:22:05] right so that's why we can't just let
[1:22:07] the message and say well I just come to
[1:22:09] church
[1:22:10] you're not supposed to come to church as
[1:22:11] we said this morning by the scripture
[1:22:12] you're supposed to be a partaker in that
[1:22:14] word of God you're supposed to bring
[1:22:16] forth the the nine spiritual gifts
[1:22:18] God made you for that that that's that's
[1:22:20] what the nicolaitan spirit has destroyed
[1:22:23] it's put all the emphasis on a preacher
[1:22:26] just watch me go and like I said Lord of
[1:22:29] God I'm jumping on the mcdane
[1:22:32] and then you sit there and watch him
[1:22:33] he's like wow
[1:22:34] wow he's really anointed or boy he's got
[1:22:36] a lot of energy
[1:22:37] laughs
[1:22:40] but it's not it's not a gawking gospel
[1:22:43] it's a gospel that you can live out
[1:22:47] Hallelujah
[1:22:50] so what's God's gift
[1:22:52] that Pillar of Fire that's that's old
[1:22:55] Papa eagle
[1:22:58] he says let me stop here a minute if
[1:22:59] America would take its science and try
[1:23:02] to find research to cure cancer or
[1:23:04] something that would do somebody good
[1:23:05] instead of trying to or here I'll change
[1:23:08] that if America would turn to its gift
[1:23:10] from God
[1:23:12] and would receive God's Gift that's in
[1:23:15] the nation now they wouldn't have to
[1:23:17] build bomb shelters and things to
[1:23:19] protect
[1:23:22] wow
[1:23:23] now let me ask you a question then oh
[1:23:26] children
[1:23:30] if you received God's gift and that gift
[1:23:33] is what
[1:23:35] God
[1:23:37] where's he living
[1:23:38] in your heart
[1:23:40] so if things are getting really dark and
[1:23:42] evil in America
[1:23:46] what will that gift do for you
[1:23:49] here let me help you
[1:23:52] they wouldn't have to build bomb
[1:23:54] shelters and things to protect
[1:23:56] he will protect you
[1:23:59] hallelujah we're just showing in the
[1:24:01] scripture I was telling brother Jesse
[1:24:02] where we were eating there is that the
[1:24:04] scripture says that he will be your
[1:24:06] shield and your Buckler
[1:24:09] when you're holding a shield man this
[1:24:11] guy even got an armhole on it
[1:24:15] you got a shield you shoot a dart at me
[1:24:17] bam Bam Bam I tried doing it with my son
[1:24:20] my son played Nerf guns with me he gave
[1:24:22] me a little uh garbage can top I'm like
[1:24:27] now eventually you hit me
[1:24:29] I was doing pretty good
[1:24:31] but then he took it away and I was in
[1:24:33] trouble
[1:24:34] and they hurt
[1:24:37] so
[1:24:38] that's a shield but you know what a
[1:24:40] buckler means do you girls know what a
[1:24:42] buckler is anybody Buckler
[1:24:46] so buckler in Hebrew means to surround
[1:24:50] so you have a shield and God is a
[1:24:53] buckler to you which means his presence
[1:24:56] come here
[1:24:58] oh look at this okay boy that's a lot
[1:25:01] that's a lot of help okay you get in the
[1:25:02] middle okay
[1:25:04] okay so first but here do this first
[1:25:07] hold your Shield face everybody
[1:25:09] okay get out of the way get out of the
[1:25:10] way real quick scoot side scoot side
[1:25:12] side
[1:25:14] Glory good enough
[1:25:16] so she's got a shield
[1:25:18] Bam Bam Bam Bam it's pretty good you
[1:25:21] know she's like learn from me I don't
[1:25:23] know
[1:25:24] okay so that's your Shield but did you
[1:25:26] know God's also a Buckler surrounder
[1:25:32] okay
[1:25:33] so now her Shield even has protection
[1:25:37] so God wants to be that to you and I was
[1:25:39] telling brother Jesse what did Satan
[1:25:41] hate about job
[1:25:44] what did he hate sister Lydia
[1:25:47] he had a hedge about him
[1:25:49] a hedge about him he was completely
[1:25:52] surrounded by the presence of God
[1:25:55] and Satan couldn't even touch him
[1:25:58] so was job the only one that gets one of
[1:26:00] those no
[1:26:02] no thank you girls thank you you did
[1:26:03] great you did really good
[1:26:10] so you see
[1:26:12] God promised man you did real good sis
[1:26:14] yeah you stole your hand up yeah
[1:26:28] because because you're pastor
[1:26:43] yeah
[1:26:45] remember how Jesus said love the Lord
[1:26:53] well if you and if you think about it if
[1:26:54] I can add this pastor the the soul is
[1:26:57] spiritual
[1:26:58] but your heart
[1:27:01] pump your your heart that's part of the
[1:27:03] temple as well
[1:27:05] so the soul of course being part of that
[1:27:08] within there okay so it's kind of a
[1:27:11] spiritual thing going on inside just
[1:27:13] like the seed is in there
[1:27:15] okay so the Gospel of John now I won't
[1:27:19] be able to get those what time is it
[1:27:20] we're doing oh we're doing all right I'm
[1:27:22] gonna try to quit pretty quick here okay
[1:27:24] I want to show you what I'm going to
[1:27:25] show you how the prophet like in this
[1:27:26] okay
[1:27:28] the Gospel of John okay
[1:27:32] so the Gospel of John is the Eagles book
[1:27:34] okay it says in John 20 30 and many
[1:27:37] other signs truly did Jesus in the
[1:27:39] presence of his disciples which are not
[1:27:41] written in this book but these are
[1:27:43] written that ye might believe that Jesus
[1:27:46] is the Christ the son of God and that
[1:27:49] believing ye might have life
[1:27:52] through his name all right let me ask
[1:27:55] the children a question so the Gospel of
[1:27:57] John is represented by the eagle it's
[1:28:00] Jehovah's gift the pillar of Fire
[1:28:03] so
[1:28:07] is the Book of John like any of the
[1:28:10] other Gospels
[1:28:13] it's actually so different than the
[1:28:15] other three it's set all by themselves
[1:28:18] but now let me ask you another question
[1:28:22] so John is a type
[1:28:25] of somebody
[1:28:28] in the scripture John's a type of
[1:28:32] of somebody
[1:28:34] anybody answer what that is who's that
[1:28:36] somebody
[1:28:39] huh
[1:28:44] all right John is a type of a church or
[1:28:48] the
[1:28:49] bride
[1:28:52] right so John is single-handedly notice
[1:28:55] he talks about the Book of John he says
[1:28:57] that you might believe that Jesus is the
[1:28:59] Christ Son of God and that believing you
[1:29:01] might have life through his name
[1:29:03] John is different than any other gospel
[1:29:05] and it has a distinct message all by
[1:29:08] itself in relation to the synoptics or
[1:29:10] the three gospels the differences are
[1:29:13] great
[1:29:14] but more surprising is the fact that the
[1:29:17] points of contact between these gospels
[1:29:19] and the fourth gospel are so few
[1:29:23] John is the bride's book
[1:29:25] but yet of course
[1:29:28] the full word too all of them working
[1:29:31] together right
[1:29:33] the scenes depicted the work's done the
[1:29:36] word spoken and the reflections made by
[1:29:38] the writer are all directed towards the
[1:29:40] aim of enabling the readers to believe
[1:29:43] that Jesus is the Christ the son of God
[1:29:47] Hallelujah
[1:29:53] now your Prophet talks about
[1:29:57] he says how does John guard the acts of
[1:30:00] the Holy Spirit
[1:30:04] we know the word that Jesus Christ is
[1:30:06] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:30:09] so how does John
[1:30:11] guard the acts of the Holy Spirit I'm
[1:30:13] gonna be I'm gonna try to be quick with
[1:30:14] this okay
[1:30:15] then we'll close
[1:30:16] in Revelation chapter 4 he said here's
[1:30:18] the lion the servant Jesus gave them
[1:30:20] power and he protects it he protects
[1:30:22] Acts 2 38. the gospels actually have to
[1:30:26] protect
[1:30:27] Acts 2 38.
[1:30:29] okay
[1:30:30] he backs her right up there that line
[1:30:33] here comes the sweetness of the Gospel
[1:30:36] with this Eagle saying the works that I
[1:30:39] do shall you do also okay so the gospels
[1:30:43] actually will guard the book of Acts by
[1:30:47] laying the doctrine down
[1:30:50] that shows that acts is not something
[1:30:53] crazy but it's actually exactly what the
[1:30:55] gospels say about Jesus Christ amen okay
[1:30:59] he says uh because what does John say
[1:31:02] the works that I do shall you do also
[1:31:07] children
[1:31:10] does anyone know where that is the works
[1:31:12] that I do shall you do also it's in the
[1:31:14] Book of John but anybody remember where
[1:31:16] it's at
[1:31:20] it's a big bonus that's a big bonus
[1:31:27] John 14 12.
[1:31:29] that's a good one to memorize
[1:31:32] he says
[1:31:34] More Than This shall you do fly across
[1:31:36] the world with it like the dove that had
[1:31:38] the mates head pulled off and pour on
[1:31:40] the blood sprinkle the ground crying
[1:31:42] holy holy holy to the Lord clean the
[1:31:43] leopard yeah now I got another one here
[1:31:45] John 15 7. let's turn right to John 15
[1:31:48] 7. if he abide in me now in my words not
[1:31:50] the seminary's words my words abide in
[1:31:52] you ye shall ask what you will and it
[1:31:55] shall be done unto you okay
[1:31:59] that's right then the that gospel
[1:32:01] guarded right there
[1:32:04] this Pentecostal blessing is guarded by
[1:32:07] John and his gospel it's guarded by
[1:32:09] Matthew his gospel
[1:32:12] okay
[1:32:13] so when a shadow could heal
[1:32:16] he said if you abide in me he said ask
[1:32:18] what you will shall be done unto you if
[1:32:20] you've got a a lame man that's gated
[1:32:22] beautiful
[1:32:24] it's guarded right in the gospel
[1:32:26] The Works that I do shall you do see how
[1:32:28] it guards it by the word
[1:32:30] well wait a minute so if The Mercy Seat
[1:32:32] is inside of you what guards you
[1:32:35] the gospel
[1:32:37] you can always go back to Jesus Christ
[1:32:39] in the gospel
[1:32:42] and what's it going to do guard your
[1:32:44] experience
[1:32:47] man I wonder if this gospel is right
[1:32:49] I wonder if the message is right well if
[1:32:52] you got the Pentecostal blessing all you
[1:32:53] got to do is go back to the to the
[1:32:54] guards and the guards will show you
[1:32:56] you're right on
[1:32:59] okay does the Book of John guard the
[1:33:01] Supernatural and the believer I'm taking
[1:33:03] these from Brother random there's John
[1:33:04] 14 12. he the belief in me the works
[1:33:06] that I do shall he do also Greater Works
[1:33:08] shall than these shall he do because I
[1:33:10] go into my father and whatsoever he
[1:33:12] shall ask in my name that will I do that
[1:33:14] the father may be glorified in the son
[1:33:15] if he shall ask anything in my name I
[1:33:18] will do it
[1:33:19] anything
[1:33:21] tell them see I always wondered and and
[1:33:24] you can see how God left the gospel
[1:33:26] because he said he said if if you shall
[1:33:29] ask for food in my name I'll do it
[1:33:31] that's included in anything
[1:33:35] he gave you an open check
[1:33:40] and said anything you ask I will do it
[1:33:44] so then what
[1:33:46] it showed that what the gospel is not
[1:33:49] the acts of the holy spirit is not it's
[1:33:53] not just limited
[1:33:55] it can be anything at any time
[1:33:59] we got to take it back to the word we're
[1:34:00] not talking oil coming out of your hands
[1:34:02] and things like that but it will go
[1:34:04] along the same pattern of the word
[1:34:05] anything
[1:34:16] well that's Pastor you want that one
[1:34:37] and first first John I believe it's five
[1:34:38] it says if you ask anything according to
[1:34:40] his will he'll do it
[1:34:43] yeah so if you don't ask a corner his
[1:34:45] will he's not going to do it
[1:34:48] if you ain't got no faith are you going
[1:34:49] to do it all right how about the ones
[1:34:52] is the one that's guarded
[1:34:54] Jesus said I am the way the truth and
[1:34:56] the life no man comes to the father but
[1:34:59] by me if he had known me you should have
[1:35:01] known my father also so you know Jesus
[1:35:03] you know the father and from henceforth
[1:35:05] you know him and have seen him so they
[1:35:07] were seeing the father
[1:35:10] well who's the father then
[1:35:13] Philip saith unto him Lord show us the
[1:35:15] father and it suffices us just show us
[1:35:17] the father
[1:35:18] Jesus said then have I been so long time
[1:35:21] with you and yet thou hast thou not
[1:35:23] known me
[1:35:26] so children who was the father
[1:35:28] Jesus
[1:35:29] so he was all father son Holy Ghost
[1:35:33] book of Hebrews said he was the fullness
[1:35:35] of the godhead bodily so he carried all
[1:35:38] of it
[1:35:38] all right
[1:35:40] so
[1:35:41] let's continue okay I gotta quit
[1:35:44] does it does it guard Divine Healing
[1:35:48] he says now let's take and see if
[1:35:51] Matthew up here now will guard it for
[1:35:53] divine healing got your pencils and
[1:35:55] things now that you're writing this down
[1:35:57] all right see if Matthew divides well
[1:35:59] we'll guard it let's let's take Matthew
[1:36:01] 10 1. let's take and see if John just
[1:36:04] one or two let's take two or one of them
[1:36:07] and see what's in John 14 12 John 15 7.
[1:36:09] so no matter where you go in the Gospels
[1:36:13] it will guard all the supernatural life
[1:36:16] of God
[1:36:17] that he wants to do in you
[1:36:19] so you can say well
[1:36:22] God
[1:36:23] then there's there should be
[1:36:25] Supernatural in my life
[1:36:29] you should believe that
[1:36:31] but notice what that is
[1:36:34] it's got to be the acts of the Holy
[1:36:36] Spirit
[1:36:38] see we have to have God where he belongs
[1:36:42] now remember what happened in the book
[1:36:44] of Samuel it says when they took the Ark
[1:36:46] of God they said they called it Ichabod
[1:36:49] the glory of the Lord has Departed
[1:36:51] when the ark left the glory Departed so
[1:36:54] if the glory departs from life we say oh
[1:36:56] God your word's the same I believe you
[1:36:58] can produce in me oh God come just fill
[1:37:00] me up amen give me a refilling of the
[1:37:01] Holy Ghost amen
[1:37:03] Hallelujah because the gospels are
[1:37:05] guarding the experience of that ax in
[1:37:08] your life
[1:37:09] just for just for the preacher no
[1:37:12] no what these mind shall follow them
[1:37:14] that believe
[1:37:15] see Mark guards
[1:37:18] the book of Acts
[1:37:22] does it guard the baptism the Holy Ghost
[1:37:25] and I'll pray the father he shall give
[1:37:27] you another comforter that that he may
[1:37:29] abide with you forever even the spirit
[1:37:30] of Truth
[1:37:32] he says whom the world cannot receive
[1:37:34] because it seeth and not near the
[1:37:35] northern but ye shall know him for he
[1:37:36] dwelleth with you and shall be in you
[1:37:39] so what happened in the acts of the Holy
[1:37:41] Spirit he already prophesied it was
[1:37:42] coming to them it's guarded right here
[1:37:45] they say well you say you got the Holy
[1:37:47] Ghost it's my guard right there
[1:37:49] [Laughter]
[1:37:51] Jesus said
[1:37:53] hey brother amen how come you got so
[1:37:55] much comfort in your life you can see
[1:37:57] they say you shouldn't be you shouldn't
[1:37:59] have any special comfort you say that's
[1:38:02] guarded
[1:38:03] that's guarded in my life
[1:38:05] you can't touch my comfort
[1:38:08] because Jesus said I will not leave you
[1:38:11] comfortless I will come to you
[1:38:15] so the holy spirit is Jesus inside of
[1:38:18] you he said right there
[1:38:20] in his guards that you have it
[1:38:23] right so if you've got the joy of the
[1:38:25] Holy Ghost
[1:38:27] it's right there he said ask that your
[1:38:28] joy may be full
[1:38:30] John 16 7. nevertheless I tell you the
[1:38:32] truth it is expedient for you that I go
[1:38:34] away for if I go not away the comforter
[1:38:36] will not come unto you right
[1:38:38] I will send him unto you
[1:38:40] see the Book of John it's a beautiful
[1:38:41] okay
[1:38:43] let me ask you a question where are the
[1:38:45] guards for the modern Christian
[1:38:47] doctrines
[1:38:51] this is the difference where are their
[1:38:53] guards
[1:38:56] how about the guards for the trinity
[1:39:00] all they can come up with is John 1.
[1:39:03] and try to say it's a dove coming down
[1:39:05] and God talking
[1:39:09] and Jesus standing there
[1:39:13] that's all they got
[1:39:15] and it says as a dove
[1:39:17] but in their depiction they got Grandpa
[1:39:20] god with with gray hair
[1:39:24] and then they got Holy Spirit bird
[1:39:26] flying around
[1:39:28] I mean that's it's kind of belittling
[1:39:31] they're trying to say that that's why a
[1:39:32] lot of people say there's a two-person
[1:39:33] godhead not a three because they don't
[1:39:35] want to make a bird God
[1:39:38] but I said he was as a dove
[1:39:42] on the wings of a snow white dog right
[1:39:44] how about uh how about trinitarian
[1:39:46] baptism father son Holy Ghost
[1:39:49] it's not in the acts of the Holy Spirit
[1:39:53] it might be in Matthew
[1:39:55] and that actually guards
[1:39:58] what acts 238 is in the name singular of
[1:40:02] the father son Holy Ghost
[1:40:04] how about the Eucharist is that guarding
[1:40:07] the gospels no
[1:40:08] no even there we only need initial
[1:40:11] evidence of tongues not there
[1:40:13] uh eternal hell
[1:40:14] it's not there
[1:40:17] patents not there
[1:40:20] Eternal sonship not there
[1:40:22] they don't have any guards over their
[1:40:24] experience so what is their experience
[1:40:33] we're good
[1:40:36] any questions
[1:40:38] boys hands go quick man how you need to
[1:40:41] come over to my church for a while
[1:40:46] uh who's first
[1:40:48] David
[1:41:30] so what's capitalized it's got right
[1:41:35] but what does comfort Comforts The
[1:41:37] attribute of God
[1:41:39] I always find it interesting though
[1:41:40] Jesse that in the in the Old Testament
[1:41:42] you know I talk about wisdom and it's
[1:41:44] always called her
[1:41:47] she
[1:41:48] so so the wisdom is an attribute of God
[1:41:53] and what it's it's explained as a female
[1:41:58] so that you have God and you have his
[1:41:59] attributes wait a minute wait a minute
[1:42:02] so what are you
[1:42:06] you're an attribute of his mind and you
[1:42:09] are
[1:42:10] in the spiritual you are feminine you're
[1:42:12] the bride the Church of Jesus Christ
[1:42:17] uh another hand was up here
[1:42:21] brilliant man
[1:42:45] that was pretty weird
[1:42:46] [Laughter]
[1:42:50] that's pretty good
[1:42:58] now a lot of the things what he did is
[1:43:00] he is he of course he had to make the
[1:43:02] type run all the way through
[1:43:06] I I would actually say that only only in
[1:43:09] this realm
[1:43:11] is that actually something disturbing or
[1:43:14] something
[1:43:15] that would actually come against you
[1:43:16] because when you get there that's
[1:43:18] that's part of the actual glory of God
[1:43:20] because those zones are also an
[1:43:22] attribute of God because they're just as
[1:43:24] Eternal as he is
[1:43:33] Revelations 5.
[1:43:36] it's it's seven horns
[1:43:38] now now what was the representation of
[1:43:40] that
[1:43:41] the seven horns were the power to the
[1:43:44] Beast or the seven Church ages
[1:44:20] power
[1:44:36] wealth
[1:44:54] foreign
[1:44:59] and so the book was the book and the
[1:45:02] works were finished from the foundation
[1:45:04] of the world
[1:45:05] so that means when God made Satan
[1:45:08] he already knew that Satan was going to
[1:45:10] try to overthrow him
[1:45:14] so God set it up
[1:45:16] that he would be guarded
[1:45:19] but then he showed all through the word
[1:45:23] why were those guards there during the
[1:45:25] word
[1:45:27] to show that God was just as protected
[1:45:29] in heaven as he is on Earth
[1:45:32] your experience is just as protected
[1:45:34] right now
[1:45:36] as God himself
[1:45:46] that's part of the thing to get you away
[1:45:47] from the fear or Scare this is all
[1:45:50] predestinated
[1:45:51] so so when he fights you and when he
[1:45:53] challenges you
[1:45:55] you have what's going to guard you the
[1:45:58] word of God
[1:46:01] and then you can be identified with that
[1:46:03] word
[1:46:05] got some really good questions up in
[1:46:07] here brother God bless it
[1:46:16] so you see how that just runs right
[1:46:18] through the scripture and we're getting
[1:46:19] ready to go there
[1:46:21] I I believe brother I believe brother
[1:46:22] sister we're going to be in such an awe
[1:46:25] when we when we move into these
[1:46:27] dimensions
[1:46:28] and uh
[1:46:31] you know even even with Azusa Street and
[1:46:33] some of these things like that Angela's
[1:46:35] Temple that they could hear angels
[1:46:38] singing in the background they could be
[1:46:40] getting such an atmosphere and anointing
[1:46:42] that the Holy Ghost would come in there
[1:46:44] you could hear angels singing
[1:47:35] and so I mean just literally
[1:47:37] no negative
[1:47:39] thing can be on you
[1:47:42] once you transition
[1:47:43] so in a moment in twinkling of an eye
[1:47:46] you go to a place where they're that's
[1:47:48] the thing because we experience fear we
[1:47:50] experience nervousness anxiety doubt
[1:47:53] questions confusion you realize there's
[1:47:54] no questions over there no confusion
[1:47:58] Hallelujah you remember brother Branham
[1:48:00] said he said when you get your theophany
[1:48:01] he said right now you don't know
[1:48:04] but he said once you have that you'll
[1:48:06] know all about it then
[1:48:11] because it's it's the word it's the
[1:48:13] expression of the word
[1:48:19] one
[1:48:21] I think that's one thing I don't know if
[1:48:22] he knows
[1:48:26] right now
[1:48:31] I wouldn't think so
[1:48:46] many questions
[1:48:49] mm-hmm
[1:48:52] there was no boredom you know just can
[1:48:54] keep on unfolding all throughout
[1:48:56] eternity that's like I said you know
[1:48:58] some of the things that brother Branham
[1:48:59] said blows your mind like uh you know
[1:49:01] what what's in you you could actually go
[1:49:03] create a world and go live on it
[1:49:09] so if you're made in the image and
[1:49:10] likeness of God you can do the same
[1:49:12] things that God did
[1:49:15] you know as you're under his headship as
[1:49:18] he's moved upon you to do those things
[1:49:20] because you know what we're going to is
[1:49:22] also the expression of the perfect
[1:49:25] headship husband and wife relationship
[1:49:27] with God
[1:49:30] so you'll literally experience the
[1:49:34] perfect marital relation
[1:49:36] with God as far as what he expressed
[1:49:38] down here you will be that
[1:49:44] and my wife says amen
[1:49:49] she gotta deal with me
[1:49:53] oh what a good time it's like a little
[1:49:55] family meeting
[1:49:57] I'm so glad you answered all those
[1:49:58] questions
[1:50:00] great job brother
[1:50:03] everybody good
[1:50:06] so you see how perfect the Bible is
[1:50:08] perfect the message is
[1:50:10] so this is part of the thing you don't
[1:50:12] have to have any fear of doubt about
[1:50:14] what you are or what guards you
[1:50:17] so when Satan brings anything to you and
[1:50:19] he lies
[1:50:21] what do you do you put the guards after
[1:50:23] him
[1:50:25] just remember you are surrounded by
[1:50:28] a great cloud of witnesses not not just
[1:50:30] the the folks that went before you have
[1:50:32] the witness of the Gospel all around you
[1:50:37] oh my that was so beautiful now how's
[1:50:40] this a touch because you know obviously
[1:50:41] it goes through every Doctrine those
[1:50:43] Gospels it has to surface seeds there
[1:50:45] and they're all there
[1:50:47] Hallelujah
[1:50:52] praise the Lord
[1:50:53] children you're good
[1:51:01] [Applause]
