brother Simon got home he gave me a left me a voicemail and he said they sold a lot of seed there but he said he's just praying now that to see if God would send he feels like someone needs to move

strong name my name is graven on his head my name is ring in on his heart I know that long no tongue can bid means be part no tongue can bid me thence deep ah amen praise God Amen thank the Lord Amen let's say on let's go to Revelation chapter 10 verse 1 I've had all my heart to preach on the cloud so like to preach on clothed with the cloud today by God's grace so let's look at that by the grace of the Lord or the Hosea was looking and I were talking about this for a while he was looking forward to hearing this but enough to hear it on the archive but praise God revelation 10 verse 1 tonight by God's grace at 4 o'clock we'll preach on the outreach service thus saith the Lord for the future dealing with prophecy about the mark of the beast United States Rome and the Vatican and assurance for Christians and advances in science with the driverless cars all that brother Branham prophesied we'll look at that tonight and hopefully some people come if not hopefully they'll listen to it online we have 81 views of last Sunday night's service so that encouraged me that's the most we don't have that many so thank God hopefully somebody's here in the Word of God and they have a choice either accept it or reject it and hopefully someone will accept it and if so hopefully they'll let us know we really like to provide a home Church for people in this area who are hungry for the Word of God amen so Revelation chapter 10 verse 1 we'll just look at this verse you know we know most of other Rams ministry or his ministries emphasis I'm sorry emphasized in Chapter seven we know that but I believe revelation 10 verse one was fulfilled in February March of 1963 that's just my opinion by God's grace so I like to explain why today revelation 10 verse 1 if you're there say Amen let's read this together on three one two three and I saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire let's just bow our heads in a word of Prayer Heavenly Father I thank you for your mercy and grace we thank you for this gathering we're gathered here in the name of Jesus Christ we know the scripture revelation 10:1 is injustice inspired as John 3:16 hallelujah and Hebrews 13:8 Lord so we thank you for this word that we've read break it to our hearts and father to strengthen us encourage us in thy word today mate today your word be truly spoken Lord and father may hearts hear the message today Lord especially this evening that I've never heard it before that you might be glorified and draw all men unto you in Jesus Christ's name and the church said Amen god bless she's been seated praise the Lord so you can switch over Malachi when you're ready by God's grace as we get into the cloud here sister Connie the friend her friend gave me that magazine from 1963 so if you want to see original copy thank the Lord I got one I tried to buy one one time there's like a hundred some dollars I'm like I just can't I got five kids or six kids I can't buy it but thank the Lord for whoever whoever purchased that for me I really appreciate it was that Bruce or bill further bill okay yep I remember brother bill was sitting right there so may the Lord bless brother bill praise God so let's look at this thought here by the grace of the Lord I'm going to I got you know how many vert I got you know like 75 slides on this okay so it I don't think it'll take too long I'm gonna set a time or two by the grace of the Lord and okay here we go so let's look at this here our text was of course revelation 10 verse 1 I believe this is Scripture that's already fulfilled I preached that numerous times and brother Branham did say revelation 10 1 to 7 is history he did say that in what is the attraction on the mountain in 1965 I don't have that quote for you to see but I could easily find it if you'd like to see that so the reason I'm preaching this is just kind of as an introduction on 2012 you know some of the people left the message prominent people and they started a website well they kept their website going believe the sign but they changed it to going against brother Branham so in 2012 and so one of the one of the main things that got them to leave the message was the the the cloud they didn't believe it was of God anymore so just to give you a background for those you don't know it around sunset on February 28 1963 a mysterious cloud was photographed near Flagstaff Arizona and actually it was photographed over 80 times according to this article in it remains sunlit for 28 minutes after sunset so the every the Sun was already down but then there's cloud appeared for 28 minutes the cloud was highlighted in the may 1963 edition of Life magazine that's what I got right here the mae-mae Life magazine also science magazine and weather wise magazine covered it in June of 63 and I think it was December of 63 I don't have copies of those but you can find scanned copies online all three magazines were amazed because the clouds seem to have formed above the normal height at which clouds can form so they're saying how could this happen these scientists didn't know how this can happen how could a cloud form at a hundred I think one hundred and forty four thousand feet how could a cloud form his clouds don't form that high that's why planes fly above that height so brother branham mentioned the life magazine one month after its publication in June of 1963 in the message standing in the gap he connected the cloud to his vision of the seven angel pyramid that he'd already shared with Brenham tabernacle in December of 1962 and so critics say these people that left the message they say the cloud was not from God and can be explained through natural events and so they've come up with all these ideas you know even about the pillar of fire picture from 1950 and and the pictures of where there's a the hood of death over a woman and all the pictures with brother Branham with you know the pillar of fire they've come up with reasons all these are not true and what it comes down to it's their opinion against the Prophet that's what it comes down to it's their opinion against our opinion they cannot prove any of their claims and ultimately all of our proofs go back to the Bible because the Bible will prove who was what is the truth of today what the message of today is and who's today who's today's messenger is the Bible will ultimately prove that so I'm putting my opinion with God's prophets amen because I know he preached thus saith the Lord I know that it's been revealed to me the Heavenly Father has revealed that to me so I thank God for that now followers of brother Branham know that he foretold a vision of and I quote snow white angels in the form of a pyramid in December of 1962 about two months before the February 1963 photo so we know it was prophesied of because a vision is prophetic a vision is from the Lord so we know it's prophetic now here's what I believe just so you know I believe the cloud was a supernatural manifestation of Jesus Christ I believe the cloud was formed by seven angels and I believe the cloud fulfilled Revelation 10:1 which led to the fulfilling of Revelation ten seven within the same month that's what I believe because you're gonna see the cloud had to have appeared at least twice it hadn't appeared in February and then according to brother Graham's own calendar and the dates he preached he would have seen the cloud March 8th or March 7th I believe March 8th so I believe the cloud God showed the cloud twice once publicly and then once privately and so I'll prove that here in the next few moments by God's grace now here's the literal things brother Branham said that are literal quotes so in December of 62 brother BAM said a pyramid like these messengers mighty ones great power powerful angels snow white okay snow white remember he calls it snow white angels in the form of a pyramid this is month two months before it happened he said I saw seven angels in the form of a pyramid yeah this is in 63 I'm sorry yeah of June that was the standing in the gap message and then he said seven angels represent in there so brother BAM says the angels were representing Christ the angels represented Christ so it was angels revealing Christ that's why I said it's a manifestation of Jesus Christ amen brother BAM said there he is two years later in 1965 he said there he is standing there the supreme judge there's a manifestation of Christ two months after that in July of 65 and that turning sideways in this picture there he is he is supreme authority so you got to take the picture and you got to turn it sideways he said right before he died a month before he died he said you see what it is it's Hoffman's head of Christ at 33 and he's wigged with that white angel wig to show that the message of him being God is the truth amen go hurry all right now I just put this one up here from the third axis I like this he said there it is they don't know what it's all about and scientists are trying to anybody got a picture of it called in a cloud 26 miles high in the shape of a pyramid seven angels represent in their brought back and brought you the Word of God under the inspiration so he tells us the whole point of the cloud was to give brother Branham a supernatural Commission to go back east and open up the seven seals amen he said under the inspiration it tells you these hours that you're coming and living in the spiritual mind we'll pick it up right now see and get it it's an exodus we're going to leave one of these days thanks be to God and remember at Israel's first Exodus God came down in the cloud and met with Moses let me know that that was at the first Exodus so here at the third axis we have it again God coming down in a cloud to meet with this prophet before the third Exodus amen I believe that now let's understand the criticism of the cloud so if anybody tries to criticize you know you you have an understanding you can refer to this sermon and I've always loved doing this I've always loved doing apologetics in other words they're proving how the critics are wrong whether it's about Jesus's resurrection Jesus's death on the cross or whether it's doctor and I've always loved these type of things so it doesn't bother me to go listen to people try to come against brother Branham it doesn't bother me it doesn't sway my faith I enjoy it if it bothers you stay a million miles away from it because when there's doubt in your heart then there's not faith right and we've got to serve God with faith amen not everybody's built for that we know that but everybody is built to have an answer for the hope that we have within us and the church said so you should have some type of answer what about the cloud and see you at the end of this you can say an answer that you can say and it will be something like this you can say well the scientists have never approved what it is and the other side can't prove it was a thaw rocket so we believe it's a supernatural vindication of God opening the seven seals or you can just say we believe it's revelation ten one fulfilled because we know revelation ten seven the mystery of God has been finished amen we know that and no one can take that away from us we know all the New Testament mysteries have been finished they've been proved to be right in the Bible and God has revealed them to his people amen so let's understand the criticism so what I do is I go listen you know now they believe the sign group now they don't have a you they stop their YouTube page and now they do a blog and they do monthly recordings now so I just go and listen to what they say and I write down their ideas and and then and then I show how they're wrong or how we disagree with them now don't think this is wasted our time Church it's not what if you were living in the days of Paul and Paul said all of Asia has rejected me what if a whole company rejected the prophet of the hour and you were one of the ones who still believed it wouldn't you want to stand up for Paul wouldn't you want to stand up for brother Branham what you want to stand up for John the Baptist this is not a waste of our time this is us taking our side with God's prophet to this day and it's also contending that the scripture has been fulfilled we're trying to point people that the scriptures and the prophecy of revelation 10 7 and 10 1 through 7 are fulfilled and you and I are to finish the rest of the chapter named ahead that's what it's supposed to be for praise God I like how Lily's clapping they're a team and Lily I believe you believe that's true amen I believe with all my heart amen like the other day I think it was virtue is singing your love defends me really loud and then send a man after we read the text I like that let's get the children saying amen let's get them clapping and singing this is the truth of God amen we are surrounding the unadulterated Bible truth of God and we're happy to do it no matter who falls away we're happy to stand on the word of God so here are four criticisms from that group that's left there called believe the signs seeking the truth whatever you want to call them here's the four criticism first they say there was no prophecy the cloud and the details changed second they criticize and say the timing was wrong the cloud was photographed eight days before brother Branham was in Arizona the third criticism is the on the location they say the cloud was photographed 200 miles from where brother Branham was hunting and also that it was eight days after the photograph was taken and we'll go through each one so you have to write these down unless you want to or I can you know text you the oricon PDP dia or send you the PDF file if you like this powerpoint here and their fourth criticism is on the origin they claim the cloud was caused by a thor rocket and was not sent from God so we'll go through all these criticisms here's the source of the people believe the sign now they call themselves they're off the shelf and they're kind of mocking brother branham mother brother Bram said if you don't understand something put it on the shelf and so they're saying we're taking these thing all these things you'd understand taking them off the shelf and showing how brother Bram is not a prophet but he is a prophet I don't care what they say the word proves he's a prophet and now a lot of my things I'm going to show you is from the sermon that brother Chad lamb preached on August 8th 2014 he did a tremendous job of showing a lot of connections between the cloud and Scripture now if you want to know all the connections from the numbers he did a good study on the numbers and the numerix of the cloud then you need to watch that but it's like a two-and-a-half hour sermon it's a long sermon and I'm not going to preach much on that the numerous or the numeric parts of it I'm not going to preach much on that I'm going to answer those four criticisms and show you how it was from God but if you want a long teaching for example on February 28th the photograph was taken and it was seen for 28 minutes so brother Chad will take that number 28 and he'll show it all through the Bible how life you know life came on the 28th in Matthew 28 Jesus was resurrected acts 28 yeah Acts chapter 28 is the chapter where Paul he has some life life spreads I forget exact but life spreads through his ministry of opening he rented out a you were in that apartment and he brought people in and it was life to that area God started Church in that area Joel 2:28 was the prophecy of the Holy Ghost falling and the 28th speaks of life so and then the woman has a cycle of twenty eight days in 28 days she brings forth life so if you want to know all the Bible types of the number 28 and the number two and all the numbers you can listen to that but I didn't have time to go through that I just want to answer these four criticisms and show how they're wrong and you know when it comes down to it we just stand with the Word of God you know we're gonna stand with God's messenger who preached us say at the Lord but we do have all the answers to I believe I believe they're misunderstood so let's look at the first criticism the first criticism is there was no prophecy so they say there was no prophecy about the cloud but I say there was prophecy and I'm going to show you in the next few slides here now let me show what is let me say what is true though it is true brother Branham never said cloud before June 1919 1963 so that's what they say well brother Graham didn't call it a cloud in sirs as this the end time but he did say snow why angels and pyramid before February and June he said that in December of 1962 so they say oh brother I've never said cloud that's true he never said cloud but he said a snow white constellation of seven angels so you can't say that he didn't prophesy of something snow white in the in the in the heavens that was a pyramid of angels so see how slick Satan is there to try to get people to doubt now more about this also a vision is by definition prophetic let me know that just as Balaam's vision or trance about a star of Jacob it was a vision and also prophetic and member bheyl him was a man who went to hell yet he had a vision he fell into a trance and he saw a star Jacob and he just said I see a star Jacob he didn't say thus saith the Lord will be the Messiah he didn't say that he just said I see a star rising out of Jacob and then you know a thousand or 1500 years later you know the wise men see a star rise out of Jacob and they say that's the Messiah so see the vision is by nature by supernatural nature prophetic and so brother man's vision was prophetic how many understand and here's what I want you to know it was prophetic brother Branham said in the name of the Lord after selling the vision in December he said in the name of the Lord something's going to happen so he finishes telling his vision and then he talks about how this vision is to vindicate that there will be a seventh church age messenger and then he says in the name of the Lord something's gonna happen and then it was fulfilled within two and three months it was fulfilled alright now here's another criticism so was the prophetic yes it was prophetic because it was a vision they say well the details changed of the vision now brother Ram said critics oh no I'm sorry the critics say the first time brother branham's share this vision and reproach for the cause of the word brother Adam said he saw five angels a week later he said five to seven and then six months later he just said seven now that is true that part is true brother Branham the details did change brother Branham said he could not but this is why it's because he could not make out all the details because it happened so fast and remember brother Branham never said thus saith the Lord about the number of angels okay and here's why so the first time he tells it he just says five and then a week later he said maybe five to seven and then after it happened he said seven so people will criticize that but to me that doesn't shake my faith at all because he tells you he said I didn't have time to count he tells us he said it happened so fast those angels with the shaitaan' back wings traveling faster than the sound could travel they come from eternity in a split twinkling of an eye not enough to bat your eye just a twinkle there they were I didn't have time to count I didn't have no more than just look mighty ones great powerful angels snow white a wing set in heads and there they were whoo-whoo and when it did I was caught up in this pyramid eight constellations so brother Adam tells us he did not have time to count so just like like you would like I would we would just guess and say well maybe there was five and week later five to seven this doesn't prove him to be wrong because he never said thus saith the Lord there's five or thus the Lord there was only six or he never said that so it doesn't prove anything wrong it's ever understand now let's go to the number two so the prophecy I believe is is plain they're wrong about prophecy brother Branham had a vision of it he said it was snow white angels and he said it would form in the as a pyramid constellation in the sky and it happened and the church said it happened it was prophetic the second criticism they say is timing they say brother Branham said he was caught up in the cloud when it appeared on February 28th but there's no proof that he was I'm sorry but there is proof that he was in Texas not Arizona on February 28 1963 now here's my response but I respond brother branham's was caught up in the cloud but he never said it was in Arizona on February 28th so brother Branham was misunderstood okay so here's the actual timeline if you get you and you can go study there's all kinds of things you can study online the cloud actually appeared twice it first showed up on February 28th near Flagstaff in the evening brother Branham was not in Arizona during this time he was in Jeffersonville on February 28th on March 4th brother Branham preached in Texas because he was there he was pleading for the life of two teenagers that had murdered somebody to try to get them off the death sentence which God honored and they got a life sentence so he was trying to save life and he says in this sermon he says I'm driving back he said to tonight after the service he preached on a Sunday night service he preached the absolute and so he drove that night he probably got there on March 6 into Tucson and then he drove about 200 miles into the desert and then he either got his game on the seventh or eighth of March with gene Norman and Robert Roy Roberson okay so the timing there they're wrong there they're saying that brother Branham said I saw on February 28th brother Ram never said I saw it on February 28th he just connects that cloud and he said I was caught up into that cloud but they're adding that it was February 28th the brother Brad never said it was February 28th so see they're misunderstanding brother branham so there's the timing even where brother branham's daughter in 1992 wrote an article and the only believe only believed magazine that brother branham's hunting trip March 6 to March 8 March 8 even she says that so brother Branham was there and he had this experience either March 7th or 8th but that doesn't throw off anything about it it doesn't throw anything off about it cuz brother Brown never said thus saith the Lord I was there on February 28th he never said that he just said they took a picture of it and I was caught up into that and then they add we'll see he's saying he was there on February 8th brother Branham wasn't saying that you've got to be very careful not to add or take anything away even from what people say right okay so here is the next thing they say brother Branham was caught up in the cloud when it appeared on February 28th but there's proof he was in Texas not Arizona brother branham was caught up in the cloud on March 8th according to what his daughter says and Perry green says that when he was alive this does not contradict any part of the vision for the vision did not give a date the critics misunderstand the quote so hope you can understand that they're misunderstanding quotes and if you can show me any quote where brother Graham said I was there on February 8th I'll say I'm wrong but he never did people are just injecting their thoughts into this experience I want you to know this here after being caught up in the cloud on March 8th brother branham immediately drove back to Jeffersonville to preach the revelation of the seven seals as he was commissioned to do so by those seven angels and then he preached that March 17th to 24th so March 8th they had the experience he must have come back to Tucson March 9th and then from there he immediately left came back to Jeffersonville for the meetings now here's what he said in standing the gap where the RAM said it happens to be at least one of these men as present this morning he was standing there when it happened when he was caught up in that constellation on March 8th it actually shook the rocks off the mountain and we find out that during the time I saw seven angels in the form of a pyramid that swept down and picked me up and I was brought each to open the seven seals for God now look what he says next if you haven't got them if Jesus Terry's eye he said my great-grandchildren little Paul children that he says if I if Jesus Terry's that will still be the eternal truth of the Living God and I challenge anybody show me something wrong with brother branham's interpretation of the seven seals you will not find a thing wrong with that I'm not saying every word in the sermon I'm saying the revelation behind that sermon because remember brother man I made a mistake he called it seven hundred that had not bowed the knees and he kept saying it over he kept getting it wrong so it's not every word but it's the revelations of those seven seals that was infallible amen because he said it with thus saith the Lord and it goes back to the Word of God and history it ties the whole Bible together it's exactly right now now I got the same words up here now here's where I would say further on the timing of this cloud the cloud must have been seen multiple times then because brother an was not in Arizona on February 28th they have proof for that and privately it must have been publicly then privately to brother Branham on March 8th 1963 of course the men that were there Roy and the other gentlemen they they heard the blast her new blasts go off but that would not contradict anything brother Bram said about the vision alright so there's the first two so prophecy and timing as for prophecy we know it was prophetic bro brother Branham foretold it two months in advance and said in the name of the Lord something's going to happen and we know the timing the timing is something we learn later the timing is that the the pillar or the cloud appeared twice February 28th and March 8th it appeared twice now let's go to the third one location so here's the what the critics say the critics say well brother Graham said the vision would take place in Tucson but according to the testimony took place about 196 miles away at rattlesnake Mesa which is also called sunset mountain but the actual name of it is rattlesnake Mesa according to Google Maps okay now here's what I'm saying the vision was only giving the general location there's no desert in the City of Tucson and the vision said that he'd be in a desert right so also on a global scale rattlesnake Mesa is very close to Tucson there's a picture for you from Google Maps here's where the vision took place rattlesnake Mesa or sunset mountain Tucson is a hundred forty I'm sorry hundred forty five miles away but look it's even closer if you go right through the desert so it's less maybe 120 130 miles away so that's what the critics get all upset they get upset because brother branham in the vision said I was in Tucson so let's read it so you can see it here am said I was at Tucson Arizona in the vision for it made it so purpose that he didn't want me to fail to see where I was at I was picking a sanbir off of me from the desert so see you got to take the vision just showed him near Tucson and then the vision must have changed and showed him in a desert because he's in a desert picking a sand mer off his clothes and I said no no this is the vision I know that and I'm at Tucson and I know that they're little birds there represents something so see Church brother branham wasn't saying I had to be in the City of Tucson now brother Graham had the vision over here in Jeffersonville look how close rattlesnake fall or a rattlesnake Mesa is to Tucson Arizona is that close or far on a global scale that's very close so see critics will say well brother Graham said it had to be in Tucson brother Graham never said thus saith the Lord I was standing in the city he said I was in the desert and it was in near near Tucson so see that's a lot that's people being critical right so I hope you can understand that so the location to me when they when they criticize the location of brother Rams experience that doesn't that doesn't stumble me because on a on a global or even a national scale there are only about a hundred twenty some miles away and we know brother Ram from what he said he had to go to Tucson to before he could go up into the desert and have this experience so he was in Tucson then he went up to rattlesnake Mesa all right does everyone understand say Amen okay the fourth and final criticism is the origin and this is one of the most ridiculous that I've seen but I hope you can understand it the critics say the cloud originated as a result of a Thor rocket being detonated at forty four kilometres high or a hundred forty-four thousand feet On February 28 1963 it was launched from Vandenberg Air Force Base in California around 2 p.m. yeah this is where Chad lamb did a wonderful job by the grace of God to show how this could not have happened now first I still believe it was a supernatural cloud on February 28th then I believe God showed the same cloud privately to brother Branham on March 8th now here's what I respond Chad lamb wisely calculated that the cloud could not have been caused by the debris of a detonated Thor rocket all right man look at this now let me explain this here's Vandenberg Air Force Base and I just copied and pasted this from brother Chad sermon it's in California so the critics say the the Mill Air Force shot off of rocky here it exploded and then it traveled three hours and 48 minutes just because it had to appear here in Flagstaff at sunset so they said this cloud up above the clouds or this debris traveled 510 miles at a hundred thirty-five miles per hour and here's the proof here's the thing that proves it no one saw it for 510 miles no one saw this is that possible no that's impossible and here's why the cloud after it was seen here it was seen to be drifting and 80 people took at least 80 people took a picture of it from here to here in only 28 minutes so for five hours they say this detonated rocket moved all across here and there's Los Angeles and here's some other big cities San Jose Jose I kept nines not saying those eight it's one of big cities in California so it traveled 510 miles not one person took a picture in five hours but yet for 28 minutes right here 80 people took a picture of it are you kidding me that's impossible that's impossible and you're also telling me that when it exploded it never changed its shape for the whole time it never never changed shape it kept its shape for 510 miles and the ridiculous thing is this then once it started getting pictures taken of it now it suddenly changes direction so it goes at 135 miles per hour it goes northeast straight for five hours and ten minutes then all of a sudden for some reason it changes direction and goes southeast for only 28 minutes and 80 people photograph it so this is it's a scientific impossibility and to this day they still the scientists have never updated those writings they still don't know what it is they never release and said well we know what this was this was the Thor rocket they've never said that it remains a mystery to this day and it proves that God had this cloud here and he had it shown he was showing it in the heavens before he did something on earth amen that's right and that's exactly what happened and of course I'm open to anyone showing me any other proof or anything else like that but do you understand that no one saw for 510 miles and then thousands of people see it for 28 minutes 28 minutes not even half an hour and they get over 80 pictures sent to this doctor who studied it and that's how he calculated he was a he was he lives there in Tucson and he was a doctor his name's was James Patterson you can look up his obituary online and he was he was one of the he was the head of the University of studying clouds and everything and he got all these pictures and he he organized it by all of his trigonometry and he found it was fifty miles wide and thirty miles high this cloud which clouds can't be formed that high it's above where clouds can actually be formed and before he passed away you know he the last things he said about ESA's I don't know what it is science can't prove what this is amen now I'm not gonna play the Chad lamb audio I had about six minutes of him speaking but just for times sake I'm just gonna keep going by God's grace now Church this is not the first time God does this God lets the public experience supernatural things often remember in John 12 Jesus is on the earth and he said father glorify thy name and then he stops talking then came there a voice from heaven saying I both glorified it and will glorify it again the people therefore that stood by so there's people standing all around Jesus and all of a sudden they hear a voice they heard it and they said it thundered another said an angel spoke to him so the people just heard a thunder and then the other people say it was a angel it was not an angel it was God the Father but they didn't get the full experience they didn't have the revelation that Jesus had of it are you with me so they didn't get to experience all the supernatural that happened they were aware something supernatural is going around just like in Arizona in 63 they're aware something supernatural happened that's not a natural cloud but they didn't get the full benefit if they didn't follow God's prophet amen it's true in acts 9 remember Pau is traveling to Damascus with all these soldiers to arrest Christians and the Bible said the light shone and knocked him off his horse and the Bible said the men that were with him stood speechless hearing a voice but seeing no man so they're just standing there they didn't get knocked down by the light just Paul did so something supernatural happens and that and they don't experience the whole benefit but something supernatural happened there and the public had to witness it amen they heard a voice but they saw no man that means Paul must have seen Jesus hey hallelujah he must have seen the pillar of fire there but they didn't see any man and did it affect them no the Bible never says that these people the Bible never tells us well they left Judaism and came into Christianity the Bible never says that so see God does public things often some people believe some people won't some people enjoy the full benefit of that experience other people just get a little part of it and you know this one after Jesus resurrection some of the eleven worship while others doubted some of his closest followers still doubted is this real or not there is that you can point to the nail scars in his hands and his problems with his glorified body and still some of those eleven are doubting and remember the Bible said he appeared to 500 people at once and some people doubted still supernatural can happen and some people will believe and some people will doubt you see how you and I cannot prove to anybody how real God is it takes their own revelation from God amen they've got to be ordained to eternal life amen they've got a lunch of love God they've gotta want to know God thank God then it was in your heart to want to know God in this hour amen that you can get all the benefit from these supernatural experiences not just when I heard a thunder one day or I heard a voice one day or heard of Angel one day and then your life doesn't change we're supposed to take these experiences and let Christ change our lives to be just like Jesus amen hallelujah and that's what's happened to me the message has come and literally transformed my life and it's still doing it today amen because God is forming us from glory to glory from faith to faith shining more unto a perfect day amen hallelujah so all these 80 people that took pictures of the cloud all these things they were just witnesses to what God was doing something supernatural did they gain the bait the full benefit of it probably not but all the elect will amen now I got a blank slide there I'm not sure why he got that it was just showing me my I was just showing me my pause there now let's read the where brother Graham foretold this vision now he told it a week earlier on the reproach for the cause but I'm gonna read the one from is this the sign of the end time sir brother man have said it must have been 10 o'clock in the day when my wife was trying to get into the room when it happened I went to vision that morning so this was actually December 22nd so this is a eight days earlier now remember it was not a dream now in this vision as I was speaking I looked and I saw a strange thing now it seemed like that my little son Joseph was by my side I was talking to him now if you'll watch the vision real close you'll see why Joseph was there and I still don't know why Joseph was there so I I gotta keep reading and I looked and there was a big Bush so brother MCS a big Bush on this bush in a constellation of birds little bitty birds about a half an inch long and half an inch high they were little veterans they're little feathers was beaten down there was about two or three on the top limb six or eight on the next limb and 15 or 20 on the next limb coming down in the of appearance oh he sees birds in the shape of a pyramid and those little fellas little messengers and they were pretty near well worn out and they were watching eastward so the birds are all looking nice for this pyramid is looking eastward and how was that Tucson Arizona in the vision already read this one to you for it made it so purpose that he didn't want me to fail to see where I was that I was picking up a sambar off me from the desert and I said now I know this is a vision and I know that I'm at Tucson and I know that them little birds there represent something and they were watching eastward and all of a sudden they taken a notion to fly and there they went eastward so this pyramid is made up of birds the birds fly east so notice there's birds in the shape of a pyramid which is reminding us or getting us to think of the angel consolation in the shape of the pyramid right it's preparing us to understand that and looking eastward brother Rams Commission was to return East to open the seven seals for God and he was in Tucson Arizona so the fulfillment of the vision took place in Arizona in March of nineteen sixty three so all these things are part of the vision and as soon as they left a constellation of larger birds came they look like doves sharp pointed wings kind of a gray color little lighter color than what these first little messengers was and they were coming eastward swiftly and no sooner than they got out of my sight so he sees three groups which looks like the three poles first Bowl second Bowl third Pole that's what it looks like to me I turned again to look less word so he turns westward and there had happened there was a blast that actually shook the holler so he's looking west which would be Arizona he's looking to Arizona and there's a blast in Arizona which happened we know on March 8th 1963 now don't miss it and you on tape be sure you get this right see how the other group didn't get it right they're adding things they're they're guessing at things they're trying to make it say something that it doesn't first a blast and then I thought it sounded like a sound bearer every what you call it when planes crossed the sound and when the sound comes back to the earth and just shook like roared everything and then it could have been a great clap of thunder and lightning like I didn't see the lightning I just heard that great blast that went forth that sounded like it was south from me tore Mexico but it shook the earth and when it did I was still looking westward and way off in eternity I saw consolation of something coming it looked like that it might have been little dots there could have been no less than five and not more than seven but there in the shape of a pyramid like these messengers coming and when it did the power of all madding me Almighty God lifted me up to meet them so Bob Arum says there was a blast first then he sees the angels and then he's lifted up into the vision or the constellation and I can see it it's never left me eight days is gone and I can't forget it I never had anything to bother me like this my family will tell you he said I could see those angels those shaped black wings this one I read earlier and I'll just skip down here powerful angels snow white and when it did I was caught up into this pyramid a constellation now you might think that's crazy that a prophet could get caught up by the Holy Spirit into a vision but if you think that's crazy you haven't read The Book of Ezekiel Ezekiel 3 moreover he said to me son of man all my words and I shall speak under knee receive in thy heart and herewith on ears and go get knee to them of the captivity under the children of thy people and speaking of them and tell them thus saith the Lord God whether they will hear whether they will forbear amen so God is going to send Ezekiel to his people in captivity and give them thus saith the LORD that's what God did through brother Branham amen God sent him to his people back to his people and gave him thus saith the LORD these are the revelations of the church Ages and the seven seals and God did it by vision Amen he foretold in a vision then the Spirit took me up where'd he go up but RAM said I was caught up into the constellation or that supernatural vision he said the spirit took me up and I heard behind me a voice of a great rushing say blessed be the glory of the Lord from this place he said and I heard the noise of the wings of the living creatures that touch one another and the noise of the wheels over against them and noise the great rushing so he's hearing the throne of God Amen so is he was actually caught up higher than brother branham brother brand was caught up into the sky with the constellation but Ezekiel was caught up to the throne of God amen the seventh of the third heaven the seventh dimension so is it is it too hard of a thing for God to lift up a prophet into the sky it's not at all I think about it you and I are gonna be lifted up in the sky in the rapture amen he lifts up just not one prophet he's gonna lift up the dead in Christ and those who are alive and remain it'll lift us up to the sky so easily by the power of the Holy Spirit the spirits gonna lift us up amen hallelujah they said no is anything too hard for God nothing so the spirit lifted me up and took me away and I was in bitterness in the heat of my spirit but the hand Lord was strong upon me so I'm feeling bitter I'm feeling awful but God's with me he's lifted up by vision then I came to them on the captivity of Tel Aviv that dwelt by the river Chebar and I sat where they said and remain there astonished among them seven days now if I read this right now let me know sister Wendy and sister Connie and brother William those and sister let me know this is wrong but this looks like the same thing that happened to Philip with the eunuch it looks like God took up Ezekiel's physical body from where he was and took him to the people of captivity in Babylon now people will say amen to that but people that doubt the message say O God could not lift a man just off the earth into the sky God does more than that God can easily do that God sent Jesus after Jesus died God sent him to hell and then he came up to the earth then he went up to heaven then he came back down to earth a man then 40 days later he went back up to the heavenly Father amen God's Spirit can send a body anywhere he wants and people get so critical all I would God call somebody up in the constellation why would God call it zekiel up into the heavens and move his physical body from Israel all the way to Babylon why would God do that because he wanted to give him thus saith the Lord amen and God has given us not saith the Lord amen that's why God and if listen the way of a true prophet that was a blessing to me BAM said Amos you know was there he's all dusty and he's all small man rejected he's not a great man he said how could a must walk in this beautiful Samaria and prophesy against it he said it's easy because he had thus saith the Lord when you God does say the Lord you don't fear any man or woman because you know you're standing with the word of the Lord very men so there God picks him up from Israel takes him east to Babylon and he sits by the river Chebar seven days and then he gets thus saith the Lord well come on Ezekiel you say you just had a rapture event here come on he's just had a translation give me thus saith the Lord you have to wait you think prophets can just come up with us saith the Lord whatever they want no you've gotta wait on God that ought to be a lesson to teach us to always wait upon the Lord God said I'm sending you to give him thus saith the Lord but it didn't happen right away he had to wait seven days kind of like Noah had to wait seven days to the rain started falling remember Abraham told that experience brother and said God shut the door the family's like okay he's gonna rain dad he's like just wait he said the next day the daughter's like that is gonna rain the next brother said it went on for six days and then programs just dramatized innocent and he said his wife came up and said honey are you sure it's gonna rain and brother ma'am dramatizes like Noah gets kind of upset he's like honey it's going to rain it's dust saith the Lord it's gonna rain amen and then the next day the clio that The Fountains of the deep break open and then the layer of water about the earth breaks open and it starts raining and there Nora can stand there and say I told you it was going to rain it was the say at the Lord we just need more patience and that's what we need today patience to wait upon the Lord amen that's what we need patience that's what they needed at Ezekiel in his day that's what needing brother Bram's day that's what they needed Noah's day that's what we need patience the wait upon the Lord now in Chapter eight not only does God lift up Ezekiel he carries him by his hair and his must have not ripped out came to pass in the sixth year in the six-month and the fifth day of the month as I sat in my house and the elders of Judah sat before me that the hand of the God fell upon me there and behold and lo in likeness as the appearance of fire so an angel that looks like fire from the appearance of his loins even downward fire and from his loins even upward his appearance of brightness as the color of amber oh my and he put forth the form of a hand so fire below and then amber light above and took me by the lock of mine head and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and the heaven just like brother branham right being lifted up between Earth and heaven brother and was lifted up into that constellation so I don't believe that well then you don't believe the Bible God lifts up men all the time amen and the spirit lifted me up between the earth and heaven and brought me in the visions of God to Jerusalem so his body stayed there but then the vision he went to Jerusalem if you know this chapter this is the chapter where God shows him the four abominations in the temple and the next chapter is where the writer with the ink or goes out and seals all those in the city who signed cry for the abominations so Ezekiel never left his house he went to the temple in the vision and how do we know whether Raider how do we know on March 4th I'm sorry how do we know on February 28th that brother Ram didn't get caught up in the vision in jeffersonville how do we know we don't know all we know is that science can't explain it and God sent a prophet to tell us what it was and the word vindicates that it was genuine experience from God amen we don't know because he stayed it's just like when brother man went all crossover between the curtain of time he saw his body stay there but he went to the sixth dimension the same things happening here his body stays there but he has this this celestial body that's glorified or this theophany body and the theophany body gets carried by the hair all the way to the temple here you go look how look how look how loving God is kind of mind you those lines how the carry their their their babies you know and with the skin of their neck and they never cut them it kind of it never hurts and that kind of reminds me of this the Holy Spirit lifts them up by his hair never hurts him just brings him right over lets him see the Bhama Nations brings him back a man could God lift up William Branham in a vision in a consolation without any problem at all that's clearly in the Bible remember Philip was with the eunuch and he was found that as a test which is 34 miles away all of a sudden he's gone he banishes from after baptized in the eunuch and all of a sudden when next time he hears about him he was in a siddhis 34 miles away the Spirit of God lifted him up translated him right as a foretaste of glory divine and that's physically just like just like Ezekiel experience he physically rapture his body or translated his body and everything 34 miles away to do more work of the Lord hallelujah now here's now I injected those scriptures to show you if brother Graham said he was caught up in a vision in consolation I believe it because it's scriptural because I look at the fruits that it came after it the revelation of the seven seals now look I'm getting back to the same quote from services at the end time well it's been a terrific time since now you see where I stand I don't know what's happening I don't know what to say but now let me now from now on for the next about 15-20 minutes let me try to say something here now remember not one time has those visions ever failed did they fail no people just think they fail because they're inserting their own ideas the program never said those things and now I'm going to take the scriptures for a moment if you'll notice in Revelation the tenth chapter and now let me say this if the vision is scriptural it can only be interpreted by the scripture now that's just what I did for you I showed you how a God can lift up men he can he can leave their body there just lift up their theophanies or God can take their whole body and translate them all around the world because God is a great God amen he's all-powerful so every vision must be interpreted by Scripture now he takes the next few minutes well here let me uh he says now serves is this the sign of the end time where we live and what day is it as the weary wrestler through the night raising and turning on the clock to look and see what is turning up the light my prayer is God let us turn on the light I'm standing in an awful place if you knew it I'm sorry if you but knew it remember now here it is here's the prophecy right here brother damn did prophesy he said in the name of the Lord I've told you the truth something is fixing to happen and it happened two months later he tells the vision of being caught up and then the preach of the seven seals he says it's going to happen in the name of the Lord I don't know why now you want eight get that I don't know I'm going to try what came to me yesterday is sitting in my den room I don't know what I don't know I don't say that this is the truth it was only something moving in my heart where I've walked the floors now this is paragraph 241 so he took about twenty paragraphs and he teaches how the seventh church age messenger is the seventh angel of Revelation ten seven and then he shows all the mysteries that this messenger is to finish a man and I preached that sermon to you the 12 New Testament mysteries I preached that to you I mentioned it over and over again because brother Graham takes time after he says in the name of the Lord this is going to happen he takes all that time to show how the angel - leyla see in church is the seventh angel of revelation 10 7 now sounding for this messenger the seventh angel here is sounding forth his message to the latest in church notice this type of message now it wasn't the first angel wasn't given that second angel third 456 but it's the seventh angel that had this type of message what is it notice his type of message finishing all the mysteries of God that are written in the book amen the seventh angels winding up all the mysteries is laying loose and it all out through these organizations and denominations the seventh angel gathers them up and finishes the entire mystery that's what the Bible said finishes the mystery of the written book and the church said so the whole point of this vision is to get you to see that God had to lift up a prophet give him a commission to go back in open the seven seals that all the mysteries of gods could be finished that revelation 10 1 through 7 could be finished that the bride can then finish the Great Commission after that Amen that's right and I'll say humbly that's what brother Craig is doing in Japan so brother Simon's trying to in Thailand they're trying to finish the Great Commission by going into nations that don't have the message because the Bible said every people tongue nation and kindred must hear the word of God then Jesus said the end will come so we are in the middle of that right now we're trying to finish the Great Commission but there's so few laborers amongst us so let us pray that God send laborers into the field now I want you to remind you again brother Branham said the opening of the seven seals was thus saith the Lord I wouldn't abbreviate this that's how I was abbreviated thus saith the LORD t T or T STL program says in trying to gather service notice what is it then what can be done what is to be done let's consult the prophet in the Bible where we cannot add to it or take from it if we do God takes us from the book of life he said the Bible said in Malachi 4 what would happen today revelations 10 how the seven seals would be opened so did you catch that that means the seven thunders were about the opening of the seven seals everyone understand that that's what he's saying here and the reveal all the mysteries that's been hid through these reformers he said how we've done it's in the Bible thus saith the Lord listen we're not just you know that we're not just taking or guessing this is thus saith the Lord God has completely perfect perfectly identified that and vindicated to be the truth by the signs wonders in the heavens in the skies and everything else for these 33 years amen now if you don't know that the seven thunders when brother Adam preached the first seal that was the first Thunder brother BAM said the seven thunders sounded out seven times right in a row the second seal was the second thunder third 456 all the way to the seventh God and then remember a revelry let's go back to Revelation 10 surin let's go to read back to revelation 10 I'm trying to help you see that revelation 10 one through seven has already happened verse one and I saw I got more on verse one later but let me get to this i saw another mighty angel come down from heaven clothed with the cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and his feet as pillars of fire and he had in his hand a little book open now what book was that that was the book of chapter 5 Jesus everybody's crying there's nobody that can redeem us Jesus comes and takes the club's book and now the book is not closed anymore now it's open and it's brought down to earth alright he said and he set his right foot upon the sea and the left foot upon the earth and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roars and when he cried seven thunders uttered their voices now if you know Revelation I'm sorry if you know Amos 3:8 the Bible said that God roars through a prophet a lion is a prophet let me know that let me read it you stay there let me Amos 3:7 everything in here is scriptural John Amos Daniel Hosea Joel Amos bear with me here in a most 3/7 we've been given a thoroughly vindicated message the Bible said surely the Lord God will do nothing but he reveals the secret under servants the prophets so he said God doesn't do anything except he tells the Prophet first verse 8 the lion hath roared who will not fear the Lord has spoken who can but prophesy so the Bible connects a roaring lion to a prophet who's prophesying and that's exactly what God has done in this day amen a roaring lion is always referring to a prophet who is prophesying amen so now you can understand verse 3 in Revelation 10 and cried with a loud voice as when a lion roars that means God was using a prophet to utter the secrets of God oh and when he had cried seven thunders under their voices amen and that was in March of 1963 all the books open right the seals are been loosed and the lion roars and seven thunders under their voices seven days in a row amen Oh hallelujah oh it's rich verse four when the seven thunders are their voices I was about to write and I heard a voice from heaven saying to me see up those things which the seven thunders uttered and write them not and the angel which I saw stand upon the scene upon the earth lifted up his hand to heaven and swear by him that liveth for ever and ever who created heaven earth and the things that therein are and the earth and the things that therein are and the sea and the things that therein are that there should be time no longer now that word means delay the angel looks up and says there's going to be no more delay in other words these things are going to be done but in the day but in the days of the voice of the seventh angel when he should begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he hath declared to his servants the prophets amen so revelation 10 one two seven is fulfilled can everybody understand that that's the whole point of the cloud was to give brother Branham a commission to get the people ready for the third Exodus for the rapture day amen all right not only did brother Adam just talk about the Life magazine he talked about it but brother Branham first mentioned the Life magazine right here on the morning of June 23rd 1963 preaching standing in the gap at the end of a service a man named brother Wei passed out his wife a nurse died due to having no pulse and you could listen this on tape and brother Brandon's prayer after brother his prayer he came back to life and brother Graham couldn't feel a pulse either when he talks about it later that night so God raised someone from the dead at the end of that service in other words God brought life at the end of that service so see it seems God honored the article from Life magazine by showing how he can restore life amen program mentions the Life magazine the very first time you mentioned the Life magazine God shows up and back life to the people amen here's the here's where it happened beau Graham said let us pray now sister cries out you can hear it that's his wife someone faded just a minute since through everybody program leaves the pulping goes down the congee Heavenly Father let thy mercy and goodness be with brother Wei in the name of Jesus Christ may come back give him health I'll try to give him back Lord and give him strength in health so help me as heart starts beating again be still everybody and just pray there's my our Lord Jesus let thy goodness and mercy be with brother Wei in the name of Jesus Christ but ma'am sets over I stand here on this altar where funerals has been preached where I stand here were hundreds of people have prayed through to Christ I reached out his eyes was set his pulse was gone and no more than called the name of Jesus Christ and his paul started coming back again praise the Lord praise the Lord as a minister of the Cross I say that in the name of Jesus Christ amen isn't he wonderful a heart attack see I'm so thankful it happened just now instead of wait till we got away see the grace of God the Lord blessed now that night brother Aaron tell us a little more about it he said this morning I've seen our brother away sitting there right now but as he was sent right along there he was standing we were singing glory glory hallelujah shaking one another's hands I noticed him as it struck him his head went back he brother way isn't gonna like I'm sorry is given to things like anything like fainting or going like that and he I seen him fall backwards and I've seen his wife which is a registered nurse check his pulse and she screamed it was gone her sorry he was his pulse was gone so in the nee and the honor of Jesus Christ who it's the same God this morning I'd preached at length way over time tired of worn and there could be two things somebody have said it could have been two things either he got tired and passed out or I don't know if the shock of me saying that brother way taking it like that I might be rebuking him or something like that fell in this condition but the Lord Jesus brought him back so my man said he may have died for two reasons he may have just got tired his heart and a heart attack and died or bro Graham said he may have been shocked because brother BAM said brother Wei had a complex and maybe that shook him and made him made his heart stop now he says to think that the same God that great Saint Paul represented in his days that when he preached at length one night and a man fell and his life was gone out of him and Paul getting over the man by the grace of God said to the audience his life with us in him I think that proves to us if you've never seen him before that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever so brother Anderson he was preaching a little long and brother Wei died he prayed for him and brought him back and that's the same thing that Paul did when he preached all night and unica's fell out the window and Paul went and prayed for him and God brought him back to life Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen now just a few things about the life our article there's the picture of it now if you notice the dot-dot-dot this article is actually a continuation the previous page now I don't have the picture cuz I forgot to get it but I could look I could show you here after service it looks so old though I don't want to take out of the bag but I will if I have to if you want to see it but you'll see what I'm talking about the previous page is actually the beginning of the article the topic is about rainbows caused by boom or beams of light that are reflected from the moon not the Sun so in other words the the article Mike begins by showing how the moon will produce a rainbow in other words how the moon is shining forth the light of Christ the bride is shining forth the light of Christ and a rainbow has to accompany that light which is the Covenant of God amen so this article is about how there's a rainbow or our covenant from moon light from the light of Christ amen you love it doesn't the bride have a covenant from Jesus Christ it's his promise if I go away I will prepare a place for you and I will come back again for my bride amen there's a covenant that we have that he's coming back for his bride now the beautiful thing is if if you can if you take that picture right here and you put it up to the light the picture from the previous page shut through because they're on top of each other you have a rainbow over the head of this pyramid and the Bible said that God would be clothed with a cloud and a rainbow was upon his head and his face was as it were the Sun and remember this picture happened at sunset so it's really dark here but the thousands of people that saw it was like shining like the Sun the cloud was shining like the Sun at darkness because it was sunset and all these attribute fitna peat pillar fire I don't know that's brother brands pillar fire I don't know what that is but we already have proof for all four four of these a cloud rainbow on the head and Sun we have proof for all that it's shine like the Sun how many love little hard not to me that that's beautiful it's just like when the Bible said when John the Baptist would come all the high place all the mountains would be brought low and all the low places we brought I got you we have to let God interpret the word we would be looking for mountains and excavators and bulldozers we will be looking for that in John the Baptist but that's not how God interpreted his word well here you'll do the same thing you have to let God interpret his don't work for he's the only interpreter of his word and how do you know it's God's Word because it'll go back to what was the what was the voice of the side amen the cloud is the sign but what was the voice of the side and the voice the sign was thus saith the Lord get the bride ready for the rapture get her ready for her marriage with Jesus Christ that's the message behind the sign does everybody see that oh I love it now let's stand to our feet I'm just gonna I'm just gonna briefs this real quick if you are if you ever get flustered by the believe the sign articles reading like that let me know I made I wrote a whole article how many pages I got your eighth article or eight pages two four six eight I've done eight pages already disproving most of their videos I haven't got all of them I've done eight pages if you want to know why they're wrong so they have out of nearly 40 videos on their YouTube page only a handful actually deal with doctrine why do you think that is why do you think they don't attack by the Rams doctrine because the doctrine was infallible because you can't you can't you can't say well they never baptized the name of Lord Jesus Christ in the Bible you can't say that so they're not gonna they're not going to make a video on brother Rams baptism was wrong how come they never make a video about the Trinity because there's no scripture that says God is three individual gods come on Church they stay away from doctrine because that's what brother Branham was taught was to do to bring back the original doctrine of the saints amen that's why they don't touch doctrine most of their videos and and most of their podcasts are about testimonies of people who got mistreated the message or didn't like what brother Graham said about women or it's just their opinions and I don't doubt that some of them got hurt by message believers I don't doubt that at all but what I'm saying is that the word was never wrong the preachers might have been wrong what they said about the word but God's Word is infallible God's Word was always be true so the thing was they didn't pray long enough they didn't wait upon the Lord long enough and of there's really just three that go against doctrine most of them only cast doubt on brother Bam's experiences they mostly a lot of them attack brother Branham as well but the three that I've I preached on I preached on him here back in 2013 their first video their first pio says there are women angels in the Bible and there is no such a thing in the Bible they go to Zechariah chapter 5 and they say these must be women with wings picking up Israel and carrying her to Shinar but if you study the Bible women with wings in the Bible represent nations and so they and they only use one scripture to build a doctrine can you go to one scripture jesus said in the mouth of two or three witnesses that every word be established so the very first time they try to take dr. they try to prove that women can preach and women are angels and there ain't one scripture and there isn't one scripture in the Bible sorry for my ain't you will not you cannot prove in so I have made a whole video this disproving it I've had people say thank you that answered my question and all these things like that they can't touch the Word of God on doctrine they can't touch it the second is falling from grace they take one quote from brother Branham where he said a man a man that wears his hair like a woman has fallen from grace so he's he's talking about basically brother I'm talking about a woman or a man who's doing transgender jet dressing like a woman and brother Branham said if you try to do transgender and change your sex Butler BAM said you're you've fallen from grace and they say that's not right and I and I show when I preach us the Bible says you can fall away from grace the Bible says you can fail the grace of God the Bible said you can frustrate the grace of God and on top of all that they just took one court about brother Adams quotes about Grace and there's over 4,000 so they have no scripture to back it up and they take one quote out of 4,000 to say he was wrong they don't look at the other 3999 that's really unfair and that's not balancing the Word of God and they don't even have two or three witnesses from the scripture in the last which was probably the most detrimental was the one about marriage and divorce they basically say you could marry divorce as much as you want and brother mam came down and said there's only one cause for remarriage after divorce and that's fornication that's unconfessed and he said thus saith the Lord and this is one their most popular videos it's got almost over nine thousand views and I've got two videos on marriage and divorce on our website that it fully explains everything like that so what does it come down to it comes down to this we've got love our enemies they're our enemies in one way as far as they attack God's messenger and they sin they may attack us I don't know I don't know how much they attack message believers but I know they mock they may call brother Branham a liar they make fun of brother Branham they're mocking God's prophet and we're just trying to stand with God's prophet but the thing we need to do is love speak the truth and love and then love our enemies we're not supposed to them the Bible said love them bless them that curse you do good to them that hate you and pray for them which despitefully use you and persecute you that you may be the children of your father which is in heaven for make of the Sun to rise on the evil and on the good and sendeth rain on the just and the unjust alright we're done there by God's grace I mean love the Lord now if you have any questions on that like I said I I didn't go deep into the numerix of this cloud I just went into all their accusations and I tried to show how their accusations are wrong so if you need any questions let me know by the grace of God aren't you glad that we have a profit just like Ezekiel today we have a profit just like Moses today there's a sermon I'm gonna preach when these days Lord willing there's a meme somebody sent out how brother Branham was like John the Baptist brother Branham was like Daniel brother Branham was like Ezekiel brother Branham was like Moses all these prophets he was like every single pretty was even like Jesus how he discerned the thoughts intents of the heart God has not only sent us a prophet he sent us a prophet messenger to reveal the Word of God to us we should have full confidence in whom we have believed God we believed God and we believe God's prophet do you love the Lord Church oh my let's just bow our heads in word of Prayer here thank you Lord Heavenly Father Lord we just thank you for today Lord I believe we can see that revelation 10 1 through 7 is fulfilled dear God and I just today Lord I just felt burned to stand with your prophet and

wilderness make straight the way of the Lord as also saith the Prophet Isaiah's so here you have God prophesying 800 years later they the people still don't believe it but you have the very fulfillment saying this is me I'm the voice and they still turn him down the same thing happened today amen we know the Bible says this the godless in the seventh age messenger in the seventh age and all these things and he comes and says brother and says it's going to happen in the name of the Lord and most people don't receive it but you did amen oh it's the same thing God's prophet standing up
