[0:00] Then we'll read uh to the end of the
[0:01] chapter. Revelation 10:7 down through
[0:03] 11. Uh by God's grace.
[0:08] Sure was nice on Wednesday to have those
[0:09] visitors. You know, they were from
[0:11] Wisconsin
[0:12] and uh they they sure they they
[0:15] thoroughly enjoyed the the service and
[0:17] everything and they were just traveling
[0:18] and uh they're from Wisconsin. They go
[0:21] to message church. They were really
[0:23] blessed and they were just so happy
[0:24] about they're like, "Wow, your musicians
[0:26] are really good." I'm like, "Yeah, I had
[0:27] nothing to do with that." you know, so
[0:29] it was all God and of course their own
[0:30] hard work. But uh and then they wanted
[0:33] they both wanted copies of my two books.
[0:35] So they took those and I said, "Share it
[0:36] with your pastor, you know, see if he
[0:38] likes it." And I don't know, just kind
[0:39] of a mixed mixed bag about what's going
[0:41] to happen. But that was really special
[0:42] for uh Wednesday to have those visitors
[0:44] there uh by the grace of God.
[0:48] So it's good to be here in the house of
[0:50] the Lord today. And uh I try to preach
[0:52] maybe an hour because we have the Lord's
[0:53] supper. We'll kind of see how that goes
[0:56] uh by God's grace. So, Revelation 10 and
[0:59] uh we'll start at verse 7. We'll read to
[1:01] the end of the chapter here.
[1:07] And I Sister Naomi, I don't know if you
[1:08] heard me, but I like I don't want you to
[1:10] do the the tubs today of pouring the
[1:13] water in the tubs. Is that okay? So, I
[1:15] want you to just enjoy. No,
[1:18] I I asked Brother Chris and Brother Jose
[1:21] if he could do that so you could just
[1:22] enjoy the baby. That'd be okay by God's
[1:24] grace.
[1:26] We appreciate you and the family there
[1:28] by God's grace. Hallelujah. God is good
[1:30] to us. Revelation 10:7, very familiar to
[1:32] us. Um,
[1:35] and hopefully, you know, in this
[1:36] message, you know, as I was studying, I
[1:38] never know quite quite know what the
[1:39] Lord's going to give me as I'm
[1:40] preparing. So, the Lord kind of brought
[1:42] these thoughts about the third poll back
[1:44] into my my notes. So, we're going to
[1:46] kind of review the third poll a little
[1:48] bit today as well by God's grace. And
[1:50] all that is, church, is saying to this
[1:52] mountain, all that is is speaking the
[1:53] word of God. Jesus said, "If you say to
[1:56] this mountain and don't doubt in your
[1:57] heart, then what you say will come to
[1:59] pass." Hallelujah. But you got to be led
[2:01] to do it first. So, uh, as I was
[2:04] studying, these thoughts just came. So,
[2:05] I thought, "Well, that must be the Lord.
[2:06] I'm trying my best to yield to the Holy
[2:08] Spirit." It was also confirmed as I was
[2:10] studying, I reached out and I texted a
[2:12] brother yesterday and he said, "Brother,
[2:13] you texted me at right just the right
[2:15] time. For three days, I've been thinking
[2:16] about you non-stop, wanting to talk to
[2:18] you, and you reached out and texted me
[2:20] and we got to fellowship yesterday on
[2:21] the phone for about two hours. Uh so I
[2:24] just felt inspired of the Holy Spirit uh
[2:26] during that study time. So I trust this
[2:27] will be a blessing to you uh by the
[2:29] grace of God. How many enjoying the
[2:30] masterpiece so far? Praise God. Amazing.
[2:33] Uh brother Bam visited that masterpiece
[2:34] there and then got this sermon out of
[2:36] it. What a amazing uh thought there and
[2:39] how the Holy Spirit quickened that to
[2:41] him. And even in the sermon, brother
[2:43] Bram said there I could he said I could
[2:45] spend hours on this. He knew he could
[2:47] spend hours just looking to get the
[2:49] masterpiece and all the different things
[2:51] the life flowing through the church
[2:53] through the church ages.
[2:56] So, uh we'll spend a couple maybe an
[2:58] hour on that again today by God's grace.
[3:01] Revelation 10:7.
[3:05] Uh yeah, why don't we all read it
[3:07] together? That's just a few verses
[3:08] there. One, two, three, four, maybe five
[3:10] short verses we can all read together.
[3:11] If you get tired, just can just relax
[3:14] and listen to everybody else. Let's read
[3:15] all those verses together. Ready? One,
[3:17] two, 3. But in the days of the voice of
[3:20] the seventh angel, when he shall begin
[3:23] to sound, the mystery of God should be
[3:26] finished, as he hath declared to his
[3:29] servants the prophets. And the voice
[3:31] which I heard from heaven spake unto me
[3:34] again, and said, Go, and take the little
[3:37] book which is open in the hand of the
[3:40] angel, which standeth upon the sea, and
[3:44] upon the earth. And I went unto the
[3:46] angel, and said unto him, Give me the
[3:49] little book. And he said unto me, Take
[3:52] it, and eat it up, and it shall make thy
[3:56] belly bitter, but it shall be in thy
[3:58] mouth sweet as honey. And I took the
[4:02] little book out of the angel's hand, and
[4:05] ate it up. And it was in my mouth sweet
[4:08] as honey. And as soon as I had eaten it,
[4:11] my belly was bitter. And he said unto
[4:15] me, "Thou must prophesy again before
[4:18] many peoples and nations and tongues and
[4:22] kings." May God add his blessing to the
[4:24] reading of his word. You may be seated
[4:25] by God's grace. I have some uh visuals
[4:27] here. So, whenever you're ready.
[4:30] So, looking at part three today, I'll
[4:32] briefly review as I I promised. You
[4:33] know, I think I only preached 45 minutes
[4:34] on Wednesday, so that was a great
[4:36] victory in the love divine, I'll say.
[4:38] Hallelujah. Uh so, I'll just try to
[4:40] briefly review here. uh by God's grace
[4:46] and I need to give brother mercy a key
[4:48] to the church. Okay. I need to get you a
[4:50] key to the church. Okay. So, uh if I
[4:54] forget, could you remind me? I might
[4:56] forget. Okay. Um I need to get you a key
[4:59] to church, brother. I think that's the
[5:00] only person. Does anybody else need a
[5:01] key that doesn't a tithe pair and
[5:03] doesn't have a key? Anybody? Okay.
[5:09] And so, I hope this is okay. Hey, you
[5:11] know, I just felt led after that last uh
[5:13] incident there in the Michigan church. I
[5:14] just thought, let's protect our children
[5:16] more by God's grace. Hope that's okay.
[5:18] I'm just going to keep it locked. We
[5:20] locked it Wednesday night, too. So, just
[5:22] from now, just try to keep that in mind.
[5:23] Always have your key handy uh so you can
[5:25] get in or just knock. Somebody will be
[5:26] there to get the door for you by God's
[5:28] grace. Okay. So, let's quickly review
[5:30] the the the definition of masterpiece.
[5:33] It's a uh work done with extraordinary
[5:35] skill. It's supreme intell intell I'm
[5:39] sorry supreme intellectual or artistic
[5:41] achievement. So we'd say it's your best
[5:43] achievement or it's an amazing
[5:45] achievement that you put plenty of work
[5:48] in plenty of skill into it by God's
[5:51] grace. Brother's masterpiece is what
[5:53] we've been looking at here. Um and he
[5:55] said if this is the last message I'll
[5:57] ever preach. This is my masterpiece.
[6:00] Speaking of the wheat plant, and I don't
[6:02] know if you're familiar with the church
[6:03] age book, but brother Ram also said in
[6:05] the church age book, did you remember
[6:06] what he said? The wheat plant also
[6:08] represents something else. Does anybody
[6:09] remember? I'll give you a quick quiz.
[6:11] Anybody remember the book of life?
[6:14] Remember he said that also represents
[6:15] the book because you have part of the so
[6:18] you have you have a you have a le wheat
[6:19] plant. Part of it has life, right? The
[6:21] grain. That's the lamb's book of life,
[6:24] right? And the other parts had life,
[6:26] right? They had life, but some of the
[6:27] names are blotted out. So there's parts
[6:29] that die and there must be some record
[6:31] of every person that lives somewhere,
[6:33] right? There must be some record, but
[6:35] their names are not on the book of life.
[6:37] So, uh, that's another amazing
[6:39] illustration brother Ram used. Maybe
[6:40] that's a part four or five. We'll see. I
[6:42] don't know. By God's grace. But, uh, I
[6:44] finished I finished listening to this
[6:46] whole part yesterday on where brother
[6:47] Ram talked about his masterpiece. And
[6:49] so, there are just five as far as I
[6:51] understand. I could be wrong. I'm not
[6:52] making thus sayith the Lord. I would
[6:54] never do that. I'm not a prophet. But
[6:56] there's at least five principles
[6:57] included in Brother Ram's masterpiece.
[6:59] It's the anointed ones of the end time,
[7:01] and that's Matthew 24:24. Now, the red
[7:04] verses are the ones Brother Ram actually
[7:06] quotes in the sermon. Now, the black
[7:08] verses are ones I just added there for
[7:10] support.
[7:12] Um, so Matthew 24:24, the anointed ones
[7:14] of end time. Remember, the chaff was so
[7:16] close to the seed, but it's not the
[7:17] seed, right? And so, we got to be
[7:19] careful. Now, church, I believe for us.
[7:22] I believe for us. Now, just try to
[7:23] understand this. I believe for us, if
[7:25] we're born again, it's not going to be
[7:26] close to deceiving us because we're the
[7:28] elect.
[7:30] In other words, we could recognize
[7:31] easily uh a a chaff from a seed,
[7:35] right? But the foolish virgin, it might
[7:37] be so close that they might have trouble
[7:38] recognizing it, but I think if you got
[7:41] the Holy Ghost, you can easily recognize
[7:43] lies, right? You can easily recognize uh
[7:47] sin and so forth. Now it may head up
[7:48] where it might be so close. But in other
[7:50] words, the point I want to make is we
[7:52] have nothing to fear because the elect
[7:53] cannot be deceived. They have the spirit
[7:56] of truth.
[7:58] And brother Ram says now this this this
[8:00] masterpiece is also the church ages. Now
[8:02] brother Ram uses this of course in the
[8:04] 50s on the three works of grace but he
[8:05] didn't use Ezekiel 36 new heart new
[8:08] spirit my spirit. He didn't use that in
[8:10] this sermon from July 64 but that's what
[8:13] he uses in the 50s. Uh denominations are
[8:16] dead. Brother Ram used Revelation 22
[8:18] because they add to the word, they take
[8:20] away from the word. And it seemed like
[8:21] everybody understood that on Wednesday
[8:22] night by God's grace. But but Jesus
[8:25] said, "Anyone who adds traditions of
[8:27] men, their worship is in vain,
[8:30] right?" So, think of it today when the
[8:33] Baptists today or the Pentecostals when
[8:35] they pray to the Holy Trinity, that's in
[8:36] vain. God's not hearing that. Amen.
[8:39] Right? The Holy Trinity aspect of it,
[8:41] right? But now, if they're praying to
[8:42] Jesus and they pray for healing and God
[8:44] heals them, well, God will hear that.
[8:46] Right? Because because God promised, he
[8:48] said, "I'm the Lord thy God to heal all
[8:50] thy diseases." Right? To the saved uh to
[8:52] the Holy Ghost filled and also just the
[8:54] saved. We know we know God thinks both
[8:57] uh God remembers both of them because
[8:58] they're saved. Now, this is the part
[9:01] we're going to finish here today. I'm
[9:02] going to try to finish it because he
[9:03] mentions again Revelation 10:7.
[9:06] So the the the final part of this is
[9:08] that the seed the seed uh the seed of
[9:11] the wheat starts as a wheat seed but it
[9:12] grows up to the full process uh cycle of
[9:15] life and it comes back to the seed. And
[9:17] brother Ram says when it comes back to
[9:18] the seed that's supposed to be us. We're
[9:20] supposed to be like the original church.
[9:23] Hallelujah.
[9:25] Okay. And he quotes Malachi 45 and 6. We
[9:27] looked at that uh Wednesday last Sunday.
[9:30] Luke 17:30. Uh now that one I'm going to
[9:32] get to later. That's where Jesus said,
[9:34] "I'm alpha and omega. I'm first and the
[9:37] last." Now, that's a little bit deeper.
[9:38] But did everybody catch that? Jesus, the
[9:41] seed at the beginning is the seed at the
[9:43] end. Same life. Amen. Alpha, omega,
[9:46] seed, seed. Hallelujah. First is the
[9:49] seed, last is the seed. And the church
[9:51] said, it's a beautiful principle here.
[9:53] Now, that's one I might preach next
[9:55] because I haven't fully studied that
[9:56] out. It's a beautiful principle. And
[9:58] then I got to go through the Bible and
[9:59] see where the beginning came back. I'm
[10:01] sorry, where the end came back to the
[10:03] beginning and so forth. I got to see
[10:04] where a cycle where cycles happen in the
[10:06] scripture. And of course, Joel 2:23.
[10:08] We're going to read through that again.
[10:09] That's thus sayith the Lord. That's thus
[10:11] sayith the Lord. And that was uh
[10:13] interesting. On Wednesday, I had that
[10:14] sister read that. Sister uh what was
[10:16] their names? Uh Sandy and Kim. I had
[10:19] Sandy or Kim read that and they looked
[10:21] at each other laughing and they said
[10:22] they just heard a preacher say uh women
[10:24] shouldn't read uh in the message
[10:26] churches and they were talking how
[10:27] brother Brandham allowed it and that's
[10:29] exactly what I said on Wednesday. So,
[10:31] see how the Holy Spirit is a discerner
[10:32] of the thoughts, intents of the heart.
[10:33] They were just talking about in the car
[10:35] and they come in here and I have them
[10:36] read and I say, "Well, brother Brandham
[10:37] did it in the adoption series."
[10:40] So, God's always looking out for his
[10:41] children. Praise. In other words, God
[10:42] doesn't want them women to live under
[10:44] condemnation. And God doesn't want you
[10:46] to live under condemnation. Amen.
[10:48] Hallelujah. Now, brief review again.
[10:50] Michelangelo finished this around 1513
[10:52] or 1515. Uh,
[10:56] and the horns either either represent
[10:58] the glory of God or a misinterpretation
[11:00] of the Latin Vulgate, which was a
[11:02] different version of the Bible. It's a
[11:03] corrupt version of the Bible. Amazing
[11:05] details. How many believe that's a
[11:06] masterpiece? Praise God. Amen. Uh, and
[11:09] then apparently when Michelangelo
[11:11] finished, he smoteed it, said, "Why do
[11:12] why don't you speak? Why don't you
[11:14] speak?" Because the vision had become
[11:15] reality. And of course, that's the part
[11:17] looks like where he struck it with his
[11:18] hammer going down. And that was a uh
[11:21] that was a uh a type of what God did,
[11:25] right? God God created Jesus and then he
[11:28] smoteed him, right? But we saw that the
[11:30] order was opposite. First Jesus or God
[11:32] told Jesus speak and then he smoteed
[11:34] him, right? But the opposite was true
[11:36] with Michelangelo. Uh first he he told
[11:39] him to speak and then he smoteed him.
[11:40] Right? So it was a little opposite, but
[11:42] we get the point, right? Both men had
[11:44] masterpieces and both told them to
[11:45] speak, but only one could speak.
[11:47] Hallelujah. Amen. and the the son of
[11:49] God. He's the only one that can speak.
[11:52] Praise God. Now, and I had two mistakes
[11:54] on there on Wednesday. I don't know if
[11:55] you caught it last Sunday. I had two
[11:56] mistakes. I had it said chaff here and
[11:58] it and an arrow here. So, I don't know
[12:00] if you caught that on Sunday. I'm up
[12:01] here preaching. My mother-in-law was
[12:02] here and Gary was here and I need to He
[12:04] told me he would text me back. So, the
[12:06] ball's in his court. I was hoping to see
[12:07] him today, but uh the ball's in his
[12:09] court. He told me he would text me back,
[12:11] but I had two mistakes on there. But
[12:12] anyways, uh the Lutherans represent the
[12:14] stalk, the Methodists represent the
[12:16] head, the chaff is like the
[12:17] Pentecostals, and then the seed is the
[12:19] bride of Jesus Christ. Those who have
[12:21] the baptism of the Holy Ghost and have
[12:23] moved on into present truth. How many
[12:26] know that the Bible says that you must
[12:28] be in the present truth? There's a
[12:30] reason the Bible said that because the
[12:32] Bible talks about ages, right? And
[12:34] there's times of restoration. There are
[12:35] times of losing. There's times of
[12:37] restoring.
[12:38] So Peter said, "Be established in the
[12:41] present truth.
[12:42] Okay, Peter said that. I'm not gonna I
[12:44] don't have that in my notes today, but
[12:46] this is the one. And church, you know,
[12:48] God is my witness. When I wrote my 2021
[12:51] book, I used this for the baptism of the
[12:52] Holy Ghost. And God's my witness. I
[12:54] didn't even know Brother Ram used the
[12:56] wheat for the three stages of grace in
[12:58] this sermon. I didn't even know it
[12:59] because I'd forgotten it. And I just
[13:02] love it. I can write something and I
[13:04] know if I stay with the Bible, Brother
[13:05] Brandham's eventually going to say it
[13:06] somewhere. I I have that confidence as a
[13:09] Christian. Brother Random was a
[13:12] Biblebased prophet. Hallelujah. So what
[13:15] you must do, what you and I must do, we
[13:16] must listen to brother Brandham in our
[13:17] homes, right? In our vehicles, wherever
[13:19] you are, work, wherever you are, wash
[13:21] dishes like I do. Uh and then take some
[13:24] time and go look that up in the Bible.
[13:27] Hallelujah. Take everything. He said,
[13:29] "Prove all things." Because brother Ram
[13:31] said, "My opinion is just the same as
[13:33] anybody else's. But when it goes back to
[13:35] the Bible, then that's God speaking to
[13:37] us." Amen. Hallelujah. Okay.
[13:41] So, we can see the three works of grace,
[13:43] but there's also like a fourth that's
[13:44] really close. It's not actually a work
[13:45] of grace, but it's just like a fourth
[13:46] stage that we can see. Oh, there's
[13:48] something very spiritual about that.
[13:49] It's the Isuza Street revival. Okay. And
[13:52] then I turn it sideways. This is new on
[13:54] Wednesday for brother Chris there. You
[13:56] can see that this is what it represents.
[13:58] It represents a timeline when the
[14:00] Lutheran revival started, the Methodist
[14:02] revival started, the Zuza Street, and
[14:04] then the bride's revival. Now, that
[14:05] could be any age, any date. It doesn't
[14:07] have to be 1960. Some people might put
[14:09] 1963 up there. I I'd go for that because
[14:12] that's when the seals were uh revealed.
[14:14] Okay. And I'm trying to finish up my
[14:16] review. This is longer than I thought.
[14:18] But anyways, the whole point and this is
[14:19] what I'm going to this is what I'm going
[14:20] to end with. Church, the life is flowing
[14:24] through here, right? It's a process of
[14:27] life flowing through time.
[14:30] So, I'm going to close with that. Later,
[14:32] I'm going to get jump to my punch line,
[14:34] but are you letting the life of God flow
[14:36] through you? That's what I'm going to
[14:38] close with because we can see the life
[14:40] has to flow through the church ages. But
[14:42] we got to look at our lives and say, "Am
[14:43] I letting God's life flow through me?"
[14:46] Because I'm like a wheat plant. Doesn't
[14:48] the Bible say we're like grass? We're
[14:50] here today withered. Getting kind of
[14:52] withered, aren't I, Brother Patrick? You
[14:53] know, I'm getting a little bit of
[14:54] wrinkles here. Withering a little bit.
[14:58] And so the it's the life of the seed or
[15:01] it's the life of the pillar of fire,
[15:03] right? leading the people on right out
[15:06] of through the Red Sea, leading them
[15:07] through the wilderness, leading them to
[15:09] Canaan's land. All right, that's a good
[15:11] review. Everybody got that? Now, again,
[15:13] Brother Ram says there's only three
[15:15] stages, but he just brought out this
[15:16] fourth one, this chaff, because it it
[15:18] tied into Matthew 24:24, but he says it
[15:21] again. He said, "Then come out Wesley."
[15:23] He saw that big organization. And so he
[15:25] sounded a trumpet of sanctification,
[15:27] more of the word. When he did, out they
[15:30] moved right out of Luther right into
[15:31] Methodist. And when Pentecostal saw it,
[15:33] they sounded a trumpet. It's time for
[15:35] the return of the gifts. See what they
[15:36] did? They sounded a trumpet and off they
[15:38] come. Then they organized. But remember,
[15:41] after the husk, there's three stages we
[15:43] know of. There's nothing else left but
[15:45] the grain or the seed, right? Oh, God.
[15:48] And then the grain is put out of it all.
[15:50] So notice that the seed is put out of it
[15:53] all. That's why we're not in a
[15:54] denomination. We're not going to join a
[15:56] denomination. And we're not going to
[15:58] become a denomination
[16:00] because the life comes out of the chaff.
[16:03] Hallelujah. If we have the life, we'll
[16:06] never be in the chaff, right? We'll come
[16:07] out of that. We'll never make a a church
[16:10] creed or denomination. Our beliefs will
[16:12] only be the word of God. Hallelujah. I
[16:15] never set a timer. So, I just realized
[16:16] that. I'm like, how am I doing on my
[16:18] time?
[16:22] He says, "Now notice if the bridegroom,
[16:24] the beginning, the the bridegroom, this
[16:26] is the bride coming forth." He's talking
[16:27] about getting back to the original seed.
[16:29] The seed that started is going to
[16:30] produce another seed.
[16:32] Now, these are very familiar verses as
[16:34] we've shown. But said, "Now, how is the
[16:37] bride going to do this? Get back to the
[16:38] seed. Get back to the grain." How is the
[16:40] wheat going to do this? Malachi 4 said,
[16:42] "In the last days, it would be restored
[16:44] back. Restored back like the beginning.
[16:46] Take it back. I'll restore, sayeth the
[16:48] Lord, all the years of the Palmerworm
[16:50] and cankerworm and all these other
[16:51] things as Eden. I'll restore again.
[16:53] Malachi 4 said, "He will restore the
[16:55] hearts of the people and the faith of
[16:57] the people back to the original fathers
[16:58] again." See, we see this right before
[17:00] us, church. Where are we at
[17:03] now? Brother Ram quotes this. Now, in
[17:06] the church age book, Brother Ram said,
[17:08] "This was thus sayith the Lord that we
[17:10] will come right back to the book of
[17:12] Acts."
[17:14] So listen, uh, Patrick Claude and Haven,
[17:16] young ones, Victoria,
[17:19] listen, Brother Jesse may not live to
[17:21] see this fulfilled, but you might.
[17:25] Listen to me.
[17:27] It's thus sayeth the Lord. There's going
[17:29] to be a church that comes back to the
[17:30] book of Acts church. Hallelujah. Amen.
[17:33] Brother Ram said, we've seen a little
[17:34] bit of the apostolic days. He said, but
[17:36] we want to see them return in the
[17:37] fullness of it. Amen. Someone is going
[17:40] to see it. Haven might be you, Victoria
[17:44] Zion. It might be you. Like brother Ram
[17:46] said, I may not live to see it, but this
[17:48] message, he said, will introduce Jesus
[17:51] Christ to the world. Hallelujah. Amen.
[17:53] Glory. Praise God. So, no matter how
[17:56] cold things might get, brother said the
[17:58] church might slug along. No matter how
[18:00] great revivals might get, just be
[18:01] patient. Just wait on the Lord. God's
[18:03] timing is perfect. The rapture will not
[18:05] be one minute late. Hallelujah. Amen.
[18:08] Amen. Someone's going to see it
[18:12] church. They thought after brother Ram
[18:13] died, they thought the rapture was any
[18:14] day and then they especially thought it
[18:16] was in 77
[18:18] because brother Ram said 18 times. I
[18:20] predict he said not the Lord I predict
[18:21] based upon three math calculations. He
[18:24] just thought it was wow I've seen three.
[18:25] So he thought it but but it look it was
[18:29] a time and season of great revival and
[18:31] then it cools down and then it revives
[18:32] again and it cools down. It's a constant
[18:35] brother says a cycle of death and
[18:36] revival. We're going to have another
[18:38] revival. Praise God. I'm going to have
[18:41] another revival. I believe in my life.
[18:43] Now, will it be the final revival? Only
[18:45] God knows. But you should hang around
[18:47] and love God and love Jesus Christ so
[18:49] much that you'll live until the final
[18:51] revival. It's the moment twink of an eye
[18:54] when the bodies change and Jesus Christ
[18:56] returns to Harpazo to catch up his wife
[18:59] off the earth. Hallelujah.
[19:02] I may not see it, Patrick. Claude, I may
[19:05] not see it, but you might see it.
[19:07] You have to believe the prophecy, right?
[19:10] Because that's what brother Adam gave.
[19:11] He gave prophecy and it came to pass.
[19:13] Well, there's still prophecies that are
[19:15] waiting to be fulfilled.
[19:17] And it's not believing in a prophecy
[19:18] that's somebody's idea. It's actually
[19:20] prophecy that's in the Bible. Praise
[19:22] God. They've been waiting on this one. I
[19:24] think I think Joel was about 500 years
[19:26] before Christ, maybe. So, this one's
[19:28] about 2,500 years old, and it's still
[19:32] going to come to pass. Amen.
[19:35] Be glad then you children of Zion.
[19:36] Brother said Zion always represents the
[19:38] bride.
[19:39] Right. Zion and rejoice in the Lord your
[19:42] God. See, don't be discouraged coming to
[19:44] church. Rejoice. You don't feel like
[19:46] praising God. Forget about your
[19:47] feelings. Praise God. Hallelujah.
[19:50] Just be thankful for heath given you the
[19:53] former rain. Now, brother said that was
[19:54] his teaching ministry.
[19:56] Brother Ram. So n from 1947 we say to
[19:59] 65.
[20:01] and he will cause to come down for you
[20:03] the rain, the former rain, Brother Ram's
[20:04] ministry, and the latter rain. Brother
[20:06] Ram calls that rapturing faith. Now,
[20:09] church, let's be honest and say we're
[20:10] still enjoying the former reign. I'm
[20:12] still learning the message.
[20:15] I like brother Ram said, I'm not a
[20:17] masterpiece yet, but I'm going to be.
[20:19] Hallelujah.
[20:22] God's working on all of us still.
[20:25] Right? God's changing us, molding us,
[20:27] shaping us through the trials of life.
[20:29] We're becoming more like him all the
[20:31] time.
[20:33] That's right.
[20:35] And the floor shall be full of wheat.
[20:36] But there's coming a time in the latter
[20:38] rain when there's going to be wheat
[20:40] everywhere, food everywhere, and the fat
[20:42] shall overflow with wine and oil.
[20:45] There's coming a time when there's going
[20:46] to be stimulation and the baptism of the
[20:49] Holy Ghost and word all around us. Amen.
[20:52] Hallelujah. Amen. It's prophecy,
[20:55] right? And you know, God's going to get
[20:58] us ready. God is preparing us because he
[21:01] said, "I'll restore the years at the
[21:03] locust at the remember the locust is the
[21:04] antichrist spirit. It's the four stages
[21:06] of the same same bug, right? The
[21:09] caterpillar or it turns into the uh
[21:13] which one is it? The locust. Yeah, the
[21:14] locust is the adult stage. The locust,
[21:16] right? We see locust from time to time.
[21:20] So God said, "I'm going to restore all
[21:22] the years that the antichrist ate up.
[21:24] the canker, the caterpillar, uh the
[21:26] Palmer, in other words, the four horse
[21:27] riders. All that they took away, I'm
[21:30] gonna give it back. Hallelujah. My great
[21:32] army which I sent among you. Now, that
[21:35] was a judgment army. Actually, if you
[21:36] actually read the book of Joel, that
[21:39] those locusts were judgment upon Israel.
[21:41] And ye shall eat in plenty and be
[21:43] satisfied. So, look, church, there's
[21:44] going to come a time when you're going
[21:45] to eat plenty of the word of God. I hope
[21:47] you're doing it today. Amen. I can say
[21:49] that. I can say that. I've hardly ever
[21:52] ever I can't even remember now. maybe
[21:53] some guest ministers or maybe I didn't
[21:55] preach the best sermon I could have
[21:56] preached. But it seems like every time I
[21:58] leave church, I'm always full. I love
[21:59] the word of God. I enjoyed the word. I
[22:03] was blessed by the word. I ate a good
[22:05] solid meal. Praise God. You know what is
[22:07] you know what it's like to eat a partial
[22:08] meal? Well, you know what it's like.
[22:10] Can't say everybody here
[22:12] ate about four burgers yesterday. I
[22:14] said, "You are you feeling full?" Well,
[22:15] kind of. You know, I wish I was like
[22:17] that. Well, maybe I don't. Bless his
[22:20] heart. But the Bible says, I'm using a
[22:23] type. We should eat in plenty. If he's
[22:25] eating plenty, right? When you eat, you
[22:27] normally eat, you normally eat till you
[22:29] get filled up, unless you're fasting.
[22:32] But there's going to come a time during
[22:34] the latter rain when we're getting the
[22:35] final rapturing faith. There's going to
[22:37] be the Holy Ghost all around. There's
[22:39] going to be stimulation word all around.
[22:41] And we're going to eat in plenty. We're
[22:43] going to be so satisfied that we're
[22:45] Christians.
[22:47] Remember, Brother McBride preached
[22:48] satisfied for us. That would have been a
[22:49] good scripture for that message. I might
[22:51] share that with him if I remember.
[22:53] And we will praise the name of the Lord
[22:55] your God that have dealt wondrously with
[22:57] you and my people shall never be
[23:00] ashamed.
[23:01] This church is part of God's masterpiece
[23:04] that he gave to brother Brandon.
[23:07] It's thus sayaeth the Lord.
[23:10] Someone is going to see this. Now, we've
[23:12] had taste of it like in Napoleon, right,
[23:13] in 2023. We had taste of what that was
[23:16] like. It's like, wow, there's oil all
[23:18] around. There's simulation all around
[23:20] people. We saw people simulated. We
[23:22] never seen them simulate like that
[23:23] before because there's plenty of wine.
[23:26] There's plenty of oil. And the church
[23:27] said, "Maybe we'll have that next
[23:29] weekend, too." By God's grace, everybody
[23:31] can take a a big drink of spiritual
[23:33] wine. Hallelujah. A big uh plenty of
[23:36] oil, plenty of food, feasting on the
[23:38] word of God. Everybody can be satisfied.
[23:40] Everybody can be praising God rather
[23:41] than worried about your problems. You
[23:42] can praise God despite the problems.
[23:44] Hallelujah. Amen.
[23:47] But said, "What about the true seed
[23:49] again? This wheat seed. It will happen
[23:51] just as we have said. The people of God
[23:53] are being made ready by the word of
[23:55] truth from the messenger of this age."
[23:56] Just like Luther's day
[23:59] in her will be the fullness of
[24:00] Pentecost. For the spirit will bring the
[24:02] people right back to where they were at
[24:04] the beginning. That is thus sayith the
[24:06] Lord.
[24:08] It is thus sayith the Lord. For that is
[24:10] that is what Joel 22 23-26 says.
[24:15] So every child of God should be hungry
[24:17] for more food, thirsty for the wine,
[24:21] right? Hungry for the oil or we say
[24:22] whatever you want to say for that. Uh
[24:24] desires for the oil.
[24:26] Hallelujah. And that should be our
[24:29] desire. We want more of God. I want more
[24:31] of the word church. That's what we need.
[24:32] Less of the world, more of God. Amen.
[24:35] Amen. That's why we come to church. Then
[24:38] brother Ram says this again. A
[24:39] masterpiece. There is your stages again.
[24:41] One, two, three. See just exactly. He
[24:43] doesn't say four, three, because that's
[24:45] what the wheat has in the Bible, right?
[24:46] Jesus said, now look what he calls it.
[24:49] The word living and in action, the Bible
[24:52] bride. Not some man-made bride, the
[24:55] Bible bride, smitten and afflicted of
[24:58] God. In other words, as Jesus was
[25:00] smitten, we're going to have to go
[25:01] through, we ought to go through
[25:02] persecution,
[25:04] right? And this is a totally different
[25:06] thought, church. You'll see it later.
[25:07] Brother Ram talks about how the bride is
[25:09] smitten out of denominations.
[25:12] Okay? Okay. So, it's a different
[25:13] application to what he began with. You
[25:16] know, it's just just so you know, it's
[25:17] just a different application, but it's
[25:19] true, right? Because the uh the remnant
[25:21] is what's left after you take something
[25:23] out of the cloth, right? The remnant is
[25:25] what's left. So, the foolish virgin is
[25:27] the remnant, but the real piece of
[25:29] article God's using is the bride.
[25:31] Hallelujah. Amen. Glory to God. Thank
[25:34] you, Jesus.
[25:37] Brother said, "She stands alone like the
[25:39] bridegroom. rejected a man, despised and
[25:41] rejected the churches. The bride stands
[25:43] that way. What is it? It's his
[25:44] masterpiece. See, it's the word that he
[25:46] can work through, make manifest,
[25:48] rejecting. So all these verses, Malachi
[25:51] 4:5 and 6, Revelation 10:7, Luke 17:30,
[25:54] right? Joel 2:23, all these verses, the
[25:57] churches are rejecting, but we're
[25:59] receiving. Amen.
[26:02] And remember, just as a humble reminder,
[26:04] we're not there yet.
[26:06] But how many know you're more you're
[26:07] closer to Christ now than you were when
[26:09] you were in denomination or wherever you
[26:10] were. Hallelujah. I'm I'm I'm I'm light
[26:14] years ahead of where I was in
[26:15] denominations.
[26:17] Right, sister?
[26:19] Light years ahead. Hallelujah. I don't
[26:21] even like thinking back to my old old
[26:22] days.
[26:24] Now, this is remember his prayer at the
[26:25] end. Father of life, include us, Lord.
[26:28] If we've sinned, take it away from us
[26:29] and help us to let it go, too. Remember
[26:32] the Bible said, "Lay aside the weight
[26:33] that easily besets us."
[26:35] See, sometimes we hold on to sins and we
[26:37] just hold on to them. The Bible said,
[26:38] "Let it go. Let let it go. Just let let
[26:41] your grasp on and go, I don't need this.
[26:43] I just need to run the race for Jesus."
[26:46] Right? Just let it go. Like brother
[26:48] said, let it go. Walk away. Just ignore
[26:50] that serpent. Ignore that mamba.
[26:51] Whatever it is, ignore the whatever
[26:53] cobra. Just ignore let it go and walk
[26:56] away from it. Be free because he's
[26:58] called us to be free in Christ.
[26:59] Hallelujah.
[27:00] If we have sin, take it away from us. We
[27:02] don't want to be that way, Lord. It's
[27:04] not our intention. My intention is not
[27:06] to struggle.
[27:08] Your intention is not to struggle with
[27:09] sin. Your intention is to overcome sin.
[27:13] But we must let it go. And we realize
[27:16] we're living in such a dark, horrible
[27:18] way. As we said the beginning, we're
[27:20] walking up a mountain. Though rugged
[27:21] places, dim as the trail, but we're
[27:23] packing the light. May we see step by
[27:25] step as we go now, till we meet like
[27:27] pilgrims progress, till we finally catch
[27:29] the top of the hill. Guide us, oh
[27:32] shepherd, great Jehovah, lead us by thy
[27:34] spirit. And we know that we're close.
[27:37] No, we know that we're far
[27:41] from a masterpiece.
[27:43] But we're looking where we were hued
[27:45] from the real masterpiece. And in him we
[27:49] trust. Just take us to him, Lord. Grant
[27:52] it, Lord. Hallelujah. Church, where'd
[27:56] you come out of? You came out of the
[27:57] mind of Christ. So you're going to be a
[27:59] masterpiece. You're not where you want
[28:01] to be yet, but you're going to get
[28:02] there. Hallelujah.
[28:05] Now, here's where brother brings out
[28:07] Revelation 10:7 in this section. Now, at
[28:10] the harvest time, the seed is back to
[28:13] its original life. Back to the Bible.
[28:15] Glory. And someone, some dear person
[28:17] tried to tell me yesterday, "The word is
[28:18] not exactly the Bible." And trying to
[28:20] get me away from the Bible and accept
[28:21] things that are not in the Bible. I'm
[28:22] like, "Dear friend, we're just going to
[28:24] have to agree to disagree, but thank you
[28:25] for your time." Yes. I mean, I
[28:27] understand the Holy Ghost is the word,
[28:29] but he wrote his nature in the Bible for
[28:32] us. So, we would know his nature. Praise
[28:34] God. So, you're not to add one word, not
[28:36] to take one word away. It's the nature
[28:38] of the Holy Ghost on paper.
[28:43] Oh. Oh my. Must have all to be this way.
[28:46] It must have all the word, right?
[28:49] Michelangelo's Moses wasn't partially
[28:51] done. It was all the way done. So, we
[28:54] must believe all the word. I say like
[28:56] this. We must live all the word. Then
[28:59] we'll be the masterpiece of God.
[29:01] Now church, I'll just say like this.
[29:03] There may be a point right before the
[29:04] rapture when the church does get fully
[29:06] obedient.
[29:07] And maybe then that's the finished
[29:08] masterpiece. Maybe that's why Christ can
[29:10] resurrect her because she's got that
[29:12] latter rain anointing.
[29:14] Hallelujah. That that might be the point
[29:16] where finally then God can resurrect the
[29:18] church. But don't forget there's already
[29:20] going to be people resurrected at that
[29:21] time because the dead in Christ rise
[29:23] first. Those other masterpieces have to
[29:25] rise first. Hallelujah. Amen. That's
[29:28] right. Now, what did he say? Now, he's
[29:31] talking about you must have all the
[29:32] word. What did he say in Revelation 10
[29:34] that would take place? Why was the trip
[29:36] to Tucson? Brother Brand went out to
[29:38] Tucson before he preached the seven
[29:40] seals to open to the church in the days
[29:43] of the messenger, the seventh angel, the
[29:45] seventh angel message, the whole word of
[29:47] God would be made manifest.
[29:51] The seal that was that what all the
[29:54] stalk has left off. Oh why of why and
[29:57] all about it would be made manifest in
[29:58] this time. Is that what the word said?
[30:00] Congregation says good congregation.
[30:03] Then we see it then. Where are we at?
[30:05] See where are we at? There's only one
[30:07] thing. The harvest is here. She's dead
[30:09] ripe. But she's ready now for the
[30:11] coming. Notice now brother. Here we are
[30:12] 60 years later. Was the seed dead ripe
[30:15] yet? Not exactly. Still had to save me.
[30:18] Still had to still to save my children.
[30:20] Still to save brother Nia. Right. Still
[30:23] to save the Junction City Saints. Praise
[30:25] God. That's why I still believe the
[30:27] shout is still going out. Shout, voice,
[30:29] trump. Christ does all three as he's
[30:32] descending. So the anointing, see the
[30:34] latter rain is falling. I'm sorry. The
[30:36] former rains falling. Christ is
[30:38] descending. This anointing is descending
[30:39] upon us. So, so we see this happening
[30:42] here. The shout still going out. People
[30:44] are still hearing. Behold, trim your
[30:46] lamps. The bridegroom cometh. Make
[30:48] yourself ready. It's still happening
[30:50] today. Praise God. Oh man. Hallelujah.
[30:53] No wonder. Brother said, "This makes me
[30:55] the happiest person alive because I can
[30:58] see the life go through all the church
[31:00] organizations, but now the life is with
[31:02] us." Amen.
[31:04] Hallelujah. My I don't have no other way
[31:07] to react other than laugh, I guess. You
[31:08] know,
[31:13] now let me give you these five quotes.
[31:14] Again, some people don't think
[31:16] Revelation 10 is fulfilled. There's five
[31:19] quotes. Brother Ram says it's fulfilled.
[31:21] It's already happened.
[31:23] Revelation 10 is not for anybody else.
[31:26] Not for Israel, not for the tribulation.
[31:29] Revelation 10 was for the bride.
[31:33] Now, there's a picture that cloud was
[31:35] taken in March 28th, 1963.
[31:39] Brother Ram said a few days later after
[31:41] that, well, in one quote, he said he was
[31:43] under that. Now, we don't know if he got
[31:44] translated or if he meant uh seven or
[31:47] eight days later when he got there, the
[31:48] cloud reappeared. We don't know. But
[31:51] remember what was the cloud church? It
[31:52] was angels.
[31:54] So whether he met that official cloud
[31:56] there or whether that cloud went back
[31:58] into angel form and he met the angels,
[32:02] it's still a scriptural vision and it
[32:04] was still a prophecy in the name of the
[32:05] Lord. And the proof of that is that he
[32:08] said in the name of the Lord. And the
[32:10] second proof is that he gave us the
[32:12] revelation of the seven seals that was
[32:14] never preached by anybody else before
[32:16] that. And I proved it by God's grace. At
[32:18] least those three people they said that
[32:20] he he uh plagiarized it from. We proved
[32:23] it. It was a total brand new revelation
[32:25] of the seven seals that had not been
[32:27] preached by Clarence Larkin or Charles
[32:29] H. Russell or Uriah Smith. It was a
[32:32] fresh revelation from the Holy Ghost
[32:34] just like Brother Random said. All
[32:36] right.
[32:38] Now, this is the this is a week after he
[32:41] preaches seven seals. And he said, "Now
[32:43] look, church, the seven seals were what?
[32:45] Open. They're already open. But remember
[32:47] they have three parts. They have
[32:49] reality, symbol, and revelation. Some of
[32:52] them are not open. But brother just says
[32:54] in passing they're opened. The
[32:56] revelation is open of them.
[32:59] Remember the sounding of the seventh
[33:01] angel. The mysteries of God was
[33:02] finished. And there come
[33:05] an angel from heaven which was Christ
[33:07] and swore with his hands raised from
[33:09] heaven. Revelation 10 1-7 that time
[33:11] would be no more. Exactly right. The
[33:13] hour. So he says, "That's exactly right.
[33:17] This is the hour for it, not in the
[33:19] future. That was the hour." All right.
[33:22] Now, I don't want to lose everybody. So
[33:24] stay with me here. I don't want to don't
[33:25] want to lose you. I got 40 minutes left
[33:28] by God's grace. So I don't want to lose
[33:30] you now. I still got 40 minutes. I got a
[33:31] long way to go. But remember, this was
[33:34] foretold in the name of the Lord.
[33:37] Brother Ram saw the angels with the
[33:39] wings.
[33:40] Now, you might be familiar with this,
[33:42] might not be, but you can go back and
[33:43] listen to it.
[33:46] He says, "They're mighty ones, powerful
[33:48] angels, snow white, wi wings set, heads
[33:51] up." He says, "I was caught up into this
[33:53] pyramid, a constellation."
[33:56] Okay. Yeah. Snow White. Yeah. Snow White
[33:58] constellation.
[34:00] So, Brother doesn't call it a cloud when
[34:01] he told the vision because he didn't
[34:03] know it' be a cloud. He just knew it' be
[34:05] a Snow White constellation of angels.
[34:07] And that's what we got. Right? That's
[34:10] what we got. Right? Now, look. And
[34:13] notice here's here's the prophecy. It's
[34:14] about 10 minutes later. He says, "I'm
[34:16] standing in an awful place, but remember
[34:18] I tell you in the name of the Lord, I've
[34:20] told you the truth. Something is fixing
[34:21] to happen." And everything that was part
[34:24] of that vision happened, the explosion,
[34:27] right? The sword coming down in his
[34:29] hand, which I'm going to review that
[34:30] again today. All those things were
[34:32] foretold in the name of the Lord. Now,
[34:35] who talks like that? As I always say,
[34:36] nobody talks like that unless they're a
[34:38] prophet or a false prophet.
[34:41] And the fact that all these seals were
[34:43] revealed fresh proves he was a true
[34:45] prophet of God and it happened just the
[34:47] way the vision said.
[34:50] Okay.
[34:52] Now here's the second quote.
[34:54] Brother Ram quotes Revelation 10:7 talks
[34:56] about the Revelation 10:7. He broke
[34:58] forth those seven seals to reveal them.
[35:00] He showed the miraculous. He showed it
[35:02] first in the heavens. So that cloud was
[35:05] a commission of angels. go back and open
[35:07] the seven seals, which he did. So,
[35:09] there's the second one, and shalom. If
[35:11] you want to hear this, the biggest the
[35:13] biggest amount of quotes on it, listen
[35:15] to shalom, January 12th, 1964, where he
[35:18] talks about Revelation 10:7. It's the
[35:20] sermon with the most content about
[35:22] Revelation 10:7.
[35:24] He Now, look, here's where he says it
[35:25] later. He talks about the magazine. I
[35:26] showed it to you. He said they put it in
[35:29] Life magazine the opening of the seals
[35:31] of the revealing this age of the seventh
[35:33] angel in the days of his ministry. The
[35:34] seventh angel, the mysteries of God,
[35:36] which all the mysteries, everybody say
[35:37] all. Ready? All the mysteries has long
[35:40] has been along the ages should be
[35:42] revealed, made manifest. It should be at
[35:45] that time. And he did it. His words
[35:47] don't fail.
[35:49] Brother said he did it. He revealed the
[35:52] seven seals. He revealed all the
[35:53] mysteries that are called mysteries.
[35:58] This is the same the same sermon. He
[36:00] said, 'We heard that word say. He quotes
[36:02] Revelation 10:7.
[36:05] And then he says the seventh seal would
[36:06] be pulled back, right? We know what it
[36:08] is. What's the revelation of the seventh
[36:09] seal? It's the unknown day and hour of
[36:11] the rapture.
[36:14] It has to be because when the seven
[36:16] seals broken, there's silence in heaven.
[36:18] Why would there be silence in heaven?
[36:19] What's going to stop those cherubams
[36:20] from saying, "Holy, holy, holy." The
[36:22] only thing it could be is Jesus leaving
[36:24] the throne,
[36:26] going to meet his bride, to meet you in
[36:28] the air. Amen.
[36:30] The man said, "Oh, you know about it.
[36:31] It's on tape months before it happened."
[36:33] Then it happened. It appeared in the
[36:34] sky. Shalom. What is it? It's a changing
[36:36] of the beats. The symphony. It's the
[36:38] fulfillment of Bible prophecy.
[36:42] Then in marriage and divorce, brother
[36:43] Ram says he promised in the last days
[36:46] every hidden mystery. Every hidden
[36:48] mystery, right? The mysteries of God
[36:51] would be revealed. How many knows that?
[36:52] Revelation the 10th chapter.
[36:55] All these other hidden mysteries that's
[36:56] been would be revealed in the end time.
[36:58] Now you remember the voice said go to
[36:59] Tucson. Remember the mystic light in the
[37:01] sky, the seventh angel standing there.
[37:02] Come back and the opening of the seven
[37:03] seals. Watch what take place. That's
[37:05] true. The fifth quote. I'm trying to go
[37:08] faster for you guys. Then it's been
[37:10] Canon one morning like this while in
[37:12] prayer. I'm going to show you a picture.
[37:13] Somebody drew a beautiful picture of it.
[37:15] It's a nice beautiful Now to me it's a I
[37:16] don't know about my artist friends in
[37:17] here, my wife, but to me it's a very
[37:19] good artistic picture. I could be wrong.
[37:23] While in prayer, there had been a sword
[37:25] placed in my hand. This is the sword.
[37:26] The sword of the word. So when right
[37:29] right before brother met those angels, a
[37:31] sword, he was praying to God and a sword
[37:32] came into his hand and he sort he said,
[37:35] "It's a sword. What sword?" And the
[37:36] voice said, "It's the sword of the
[37:38] king." And brother Ram said, "That's the
[37:40] word that I live by."
[37:43] Because the word is the discerner of the
[37:45] thoughts and intents of the heart. And
[37:47] brother Ram said him getting the sword
[37:48] was a symbol. He's got the word. He's
[37:51] got the spoken word. He's got speak to
[37:53] this mountain and it'll come to pass.
[37:55] Praise God. He said that's my new
[37:57] commission to speak the word to open the
[38:00] mysteries. And I'm gonna show a few
[38:01] others here by God's grace.
[38:04] Later, the angels appeared as was
[38:07] prophesied. This was a prophecy. Snow
[38:10] White pyramid of angels. I'll get the
[38:12] sword in my hand. New commission. And
[38:14] then he says five times, it's already
[38:16] happened. Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[38:20] And church, I got videos on this, too.
[38:23] You could listen to this sermon if you
[38:24] don't understand it. Or we could have a
[38:26] Zoom Bible study. We could have those,
[38:27] too, by God's grace. If you want to slow
[38:29] it down, I'll slow it down. But you have
[38:32] to put time into it, too. You got to go
[38:33] read the quotes. And you got to study
[38:35] the scripture yourself. I can't do all
[38:37] your like brother Rod said, you got to
[38:39] want it. Brother Rod told me that. He
[38:40] said, he said, you just can't talk about
[38:41] things. If you want something, go get
[38:43] it. That's what the Bible says. If the
[38:45] violent uh the Bible said the violent
[38:47] take the kingdom of God by force. In
[38:49] other words, say Satan get behind me and
[38:51] you go obey the word of God. All right.
[38:57] Now, this is the same sermon. Yeah.
[38:58] Rising of the sun. Same sermon.
[39:01] He said he spoke to me and said the
[39:02] seven seals will be open. The seven
[39:04] mysteries, the sevenfold mystery of the
[39:05] Bible that's been closed up from the
[39:07] foundation of the world will be
[39:08] revealed. And we yet a humble little
[39:10] group compared with all the world. We've
[39:12] enjoyed these blessings of hearing these
[39:14] mysteries. marriage, divorce, serpent
[39:15] seed, all these different questions.
[39:19] The mystery of God should be finished.
[39:21] It means all the Bible mysteries will be
[39:23] finished.
[39:26] Has been has been. Now, look, church,
[39:27] has been. It's already in the past. It's
[39:29] been completely revealed to us, not by
[39:31] man, but by God himself that's open
[39:33] these seven mysteries.
[39:35] All right.
[39:37] Uh oh, yeah. Now, here he says, he says,
[39:39] "Turn that picture." And he says, "It's
[39:42] Christ." He says, "No, notice if you'll
[39:43] just turn that picture, that cloud
[39:45] picture," he said, "It's Christ.
[39:48] He's supreme judge. There's no other but
[39:50] him." That's a perfect identification
[39:52] again, a vindication that this message
[39:54] is the truth. This is the truth. It's
[39:56] true. And making him not a third person,
[39:59] but the only person.
[40:02] Hallelujah.
[40:04] Here's where he says alpha and omega,
[40:05] but I think that's a fifth one.
[40:09] I'm just going to skip ahead.
[40:12] Okay, now this is what is the attraction
[40:13] on the mountain. This is the clearest
[40:15] one. He talks about Revelation 10:7. And
[40:17] then he said three years ago, this
[40:19] mystery of his vision was a prophecy.
[40:21] Revelation 10:7. What is the time, sir?
[40:23] He preached that December 30th, 1962.
[40:26] But now it's history. It's passed. The
[40:29] promise is fulfilled. Let's all say
[40:30] fulfilled. Can we fulfilled? Revelation
[40:33] 10:1-7 is fulfilled. It's no longer
[40:35] prophecy. It's fulfilled.
[40:38] The promise is fulfilled. What time is
[40:40] it? What's this? What's this attraction?
[40:42] God fulfilling his word. He's the same
[40:44] yesterday, today, and forever. And and
[40:46] church, this is Brother Ram's
[40:47] masterpiece. Hallelujah.
[40:49] All the mysteries of the Bible
[40:51] fulfilled. Revelation 10 being
[40:53] fulfilled. This is Brother Ram's great
[40:55] work. He was trying to get the people to
[40:57] see in the end time. The seed has to
[41:00] become back to what it was at the
[41:01] beginning. The the end time bride's got
[41:04] to look just like the beginning book of
[41:06] Acts bride. Amen. Good. I'm glad for
[41:08] those amens. I appreciate that. I just
[41:11] church, I just want to know that my
[41:12] humble little church understands what
[41:14] I'm preaching. If I'm preaching too
[41:16] high, God forgive me. I want to make it
[41:17] so simple that even Zion can can catch
[41:19] it.
[41:21] Hallelujah.
[41:23] I don't want to make it strange or, you
[41:25] know, I don't want to be a fanatic. I
[41:26] just want to make it so simple, church,
[41:29] that that anybody could see it by the
[41:31] grace of God.
[41:34] Now, here here here's what brother said.
[41:36] the the magazine looks like this. He
[41:38] said, "But turn it to its side. It looks
[41:40] just like this. Look at that. It's like
[41:41] a pyramid shape,
[41:44] right? And then what the artist did
[41:45] later is they just put that in there
[41:48] with Photoshop." Okay? But there's
[41:51] there's no eyes or anything here.
[41:52] Brother Perry Green talks about that
[41:53] there was no eyes or nose in there. That
[41:55] was from a copy machine. That's the
[41:56] actual that's the best picture. That's
[41:58] the original. But see, brother said,
[42:00] "Look, it's it's Christ." He says,
[42:03] "He's coming down to visit." And church,
[42:06] I got a sermon I'm going to preach here
[42:07] pretty soon. God came numerous times as
[42:10] an angel to prophets because Revelation
[42:13] 10 is a mighty angel comes down. Who was
[42:15] the angel that met Moses in the burning
[42:17] bush? The Bible said an angel. And they
[42:19] said, "I am that I am." That wasn't just
[42:22] Gabriel or Michael or Wormwood. That was
[42:24] God. Hallelujah.
[42:26] That was an angel who said he was God.
[42:29] Amen. A mighty angel who was God come
[42:31] down to visit a prophet. Praise God.
[42:35] They did it other times, too. I'm going
[42:36] to preach a sermon on that Lord when I
[42:37] at least I got all these notes. I'm
[42:38] waiting for the right inspiration.
[42:39] Praise God. Waiting for the right time.
[42:42] But it's just amazing. There's every
[42:43] little thing of Sorry, brother Brandham.
[42:45] If you go back to the Bible, you're
[42:46] going to see something just like it in
[42:48] the Bible.
[42:51] Even this mighty angel. God did that
[42:52] numerous times before. Oh, yes. The
[42:54] other one's Abraham. The Bible said an
[42:56] angel come and talk to Abraham and he
[42:58] said, "I am the Lord your God. Walk
[43:01] before me. Be thou perfect." an angel,
[43:04] right? It's God in the form of an angel.
[43:07] Just like God in the form of angel come
[43:09] down and met Brother Brandham. Praise
[43:10] God.
[43:12] H I just wish more people could see it.
[43:15] Now, here's the beautiful picture,
[43:16] church. Here. Okay. So, here this is
[43:18] brother Brandon right here. Now, I I
[43:19] just made a larger view over here. He
[43:21] had this vision. Now, there I like see I
[43:23] like this. This is just really all the
[43:24] rocks. Remember the rock the explosion?
[43:26] There's rocks everywhere.
[43:29] Now, this person thought there were
[43:31] seven angels. One, two, three, four,
[43:32] five, six, seven. Okay. And that may be
[43:34] true, right? Brother said it was angels.
[43:37] But I'm just saying like the way they're
[43:38] dressed. I'm not I'm not saying it's
[43:39] like that. I'm just saying this is an
[43:40] artist idea.
[43:43] But see, he was he got the sword of the
[43:45] he's got the sword of the king, the
[43:46] word, the opening of the word. He was
[43:48] commissioned by God to go back with that
[43:49] sword and open the word of God with that
[43:52] sword and reveal the seven seals.
[43:54] Now, people have criticized brother Ram.
[43:57] Oh, there's people that mocked him and
[43:59] may God have mercy on that. like, "Oh,
[44:01] what kind of a a church you guys believe
[44:02] in where a prophet caught a sword in a
[44:04] vision?" Well, the same Bible that says
[44:07] a prophet said a cold touched his mouth
[44:11] with tongues.
[44:13] I washed tongues this week. There's
[44:16] heavenly tongues.
[44:18] And this prophet said, brother brother
[44:19] Christie had a vision where heavenly
[44:21] tongues come down and put a coal on his
[44:23] mouth. Well, that's really strange, but
[44:24] it's the Bible.
[44:26] Hallelujah.
[44:28] I tell you, a sword is probably more of
[44:30] a Bible symbol than even tongues,
[44:33] right?
[44:35] Because Jesus, a sword comes out of
[44:37] Jesus' mouth in Revelation 19 and his
[44:39] name is called the word of God.
[44:41] Hallelujah.
[44:43] And these these people that almost
[44:45] blasting the Holy Ghost say, "Oh, what
[44:47] kind of person do you believe in who has
[44:48] a vision of a sword?" Well, the same the
[44:51] same kind of person I believe in who had
[44:53] a vision that he was lifted up by his
[44:54] hair and carried. He was lifted by his
[44:57] hair and carried to Jerusalem. Trying to
[44:59] give you a real good visual here without
[45:00] pulling out all my hair. That's what
[45:02] Ezekiel said. And then in chapter 2 and
[45:04] three, God said, "Eat the roll." Can you
[45:06] imagine, church, just a piece of paper?
[45:09] Can you imagine a roll? And Ezekiel's
[45:11] like,
[45:13] "Okay, I'll eat it." And he eats it
[45:15] down. And you follow a prophet who said
[45:17] he ate a roll in a vision. Yes, I do. I
[45:21] follow a prophet who got the sword of
[45:23] the king because he preached with the
[45:25] Bible. He preached thus sayith the Lord
[45:26] out of the Bible. That's the kind of
[45:28] prophet I follow. Hallelujah. Amen.
[45:32] Just like Ezekiel, just like Isaiah. And
[45:34] what about Joshua? He was he was uh
[45:38] Zechariah saw a vision of Joshua, the
[45:40] high priest of those days in the days of
[45:41] Zerubel. And he saw a vision of a
[45:43] courtroom where where Joshua has all
[45:46] these dirty garments on. And Satan's
[45:47] trying to rebuke him. And the angel
[45:49] says, "Hold your peace, Satan."
[45:51] And the and the angel said, "Get him a
[45:53] new change of garments. I'm cleansing
[45:55] him. So Zechariah says sees a prophet
[45:58] taking off dirty clothes and get it on
[46:00] clean clothes. Oh, you follow a prophet
[46:02] that had that vision? Yes, I do. Because
[46:05] it's a Biblebased vision. Hallelujah.
[46:09] People say, "How how fanatical is that?
[46:11] How crazy is that?" It's not crazy. It's
[46:14] revelation. And it's not crazy. It's the
[46:16] word of God.
[46:20] And then John did the same thing, did he
[46:21] not? The voice said, "Go to the mighty
[46:24] angel, take the book, and eat it up."
[46:26] And he did.
[46:29] We don't serve, we don't serve a a a
[46:32] strange God. We serve the only true God.
[46:35] Amen. But he just does things that that
[46:38] carnal minds don't understand. Remember,
[46:40] the Bible said God would use the
[46:41] foolishness of preaching to save them
[46:43] that would believe.
[46:46] But church, guess what? We're not done.
[46:47] You got to eat this thing, too, because
[46:48] you represent John.
[46:51] So, you got a meal coming up here today.
[46:53] Eat this book. Hallelujah. Eat this
[46:55] word. In other words, believe all the
[46:57] Bible revelations. Brother Hannah,
[46:58] preach to us. Amen. You've got to eat it
[47:01] and prophesy it again. Can I say like
[47:03] this? Prophesy again to your family.
[47:05] Tell it to your family. Tell it to your
[47:07] friends. Tell it to your co-workers.
[47:08] Everybody who's ordained to hear it is
[47:10] going to hear it. Praise God.
[47:13] But you got to eat it up. You got to
[47:14] believe it. And then you got to share it
[47:16] with somebody else by God's grace. Is
[47:18] that clear? Amen.
[47:20] So, I think this is a very scriptural
[47:22] vision.
[47:24] I would say which one is the most
[47:25] outrageous? I mean, how about a coal in
[47:26] the mouth or how about being carried by
[47:28] your hair from uh was it Iran or Iraq
[47:31] all the way uh back to Jerusalem by your
[47:34] hair?
[47:36] That seems pretty uh outlandish or hard
[47:39] to believe to me, but yet it's thus
[47:41] sayith the Lord.
[47:44] But you know what mockers are going to
[47:46] mock? The Bible said there'll be
[47:47] scoffers at the end time. Where is the
[47:48] coming of the Lord? Where is the
[47:50] rapture? Brother Ram has been gone 60
[47:51] years. They're going to say all this
[47:53] scoffing and we're just going to wait on
[47:54] the Lord. And the Bible said as we wait,
[47:56] he renews our strength like the eagle.
[47:59] Okay, good. I got 20 uh got 30 minutes.
[48:03] 32 minutes left. Now, this let me give
[48:05] you another visual here. Now, is this
[48:07] helpful? The first poll was Now, that's
[48:10] not I think he's just praying for her
[48:12] and she's got her head bowed, but I I
[48:14] couldn't find a picture, brother. I saw
[48:15] one one time and I couldn't find it.
[48:16] There was three dots on brother Ram's
[48:18] hand. Like on this side, there was three
[48:20] dots. I saw a picture. I just couldn't
[48:21] find it. Somebody actually got a picture
[48:23] of it. You've seen it, too? Yeah. I just
[48:25] couldn't find it. I searched online. But
[48:27] there was dots and they would have
[48:29] different designs. There was three or
[48:30] four dots. And depending on what
[48:32] sickness they had, Brother Bam, they
[48:34] would hold Brother Bam's hand and those
[48:35] dots would form. Okay? But I'm just
[48:37] giving you a visual. The first pole was
[48:38] assign the hand. The second pole was
[48:40] discernment, telling her the thoughts
[48:41] and intents of her heart.
[48:43] The third poll, brother Ram, calls
[48:45] speaking the word.
[48:48] Okay, I'm going to try to make this I
[48:50] want to give you a visual so especially
[48:52] the young people remember it. I want
[48:54] Anna and Michelle to grow up and Patrick
[48:57] and Claw and say, "Praise God, I know
[48:59] what the three three poles are."
[49:02] It's important because God brought
[49:03] brother Brandham through a greater
[49:05] revelation. It's important for you
[49:06] because you need to speak the word, too.
[49:08] That's why it's important to us. He had
[49:11] to learn you can only speak when God
[49:12] inspires you to speak.
[49:15] Okay? Now, I want to make it even more
[49:17] clear. Now, look, I made these smaller
[49:20] so we could spend more time on the third
[49:21] pole.
[49:23] Brother Ram called this, he called it
[49:25] speaking the word or we would call it in
[49:27] the Bible, we would call it when you
[49:28] speak to the mountain or say to this
[49:30] mountain to be moved. Okay?
[49:34] It has at least one, two, three
[49:36] meanings. The third pole, there could be
[49:37] more, but I was just studying. I just
[49:39] want to rehearse and my brother called
[49:41] this my new commission,
[49:43] my new ministry to preach the word of
[49:45] God. Okay,
[49:48] all this is the same thing. Okay,
[49:51] everybody got that? So, it's speaking
[49:54] the word. And remember, uh he gave five,
[49:56] let me go to that one. He he gave five
[49:58] examples of that.
[50:00] Speaking the word. This was in 1958 or
[50:03] 1959. Brother Ran walked into Sunny
[50:05] Shims. We were there at the at the
[50:06] store, brother. And there's a testimony
[50:07] hanging up in the wall there in
[50:09] Jeffersonville.
[50:10] And brother Ram said, "There's five
[50:12] specialists said he was going to die."
[50:13] And brother Man said, "No, thus sayith
[50:15] the Lord, you'll sell me red hots again
[50:16] over the counter." Hallelujah.
[50:20] So healing, this is this is how it
[50:23] relates to you. If you can speak healing
[50:25] if God's calling you to do it, but only
[50:28] if God's calling you to do it. Now
[50:29] church, listen. You might not have the
[50:31] gift of healing. So then you might God
[50:32] might not call you to do that. Or you
[50:34] might do it one time and never again.
[50:37] Okay. But it's scriptural. Brother Rand
[50:40] also said creation. He spoke those
[50:42] squirrels into existence. Well, Moses
[50:44] did that too, right? Moses spoke things
[50:47] and they just came, right? It's the same
[50:50] power, same God. And the church said,
[50:52] "Oh, it's the same God all the time."
[50:54] Praise God. You can speak things and
[50:56] they they materially appeared. Praise
[50:58] God.
[51:01] The Bible said God or Moses spoke to the
[51:03] dust and the dust became was it lice?
[51:06] Dust became lice. Taking a little piece
[51:10] of dirt, dead dirt, change it into a
[51:13] living creature to crawl all over the
[51:15] Egyptians. God did that. That's creative
[51:18] power. Hallelujah.
[51:21] It just it just means God can create.
[51:23] God can multiply. God can change. He's
[51:25] going to change our atoms in the
[51:27] rapture. Praise God. Also
[51:31] this includes you could speak for
[51:32] somebody to be saved because had Wright
[51:35] did that. The greatest desire of my
[51:37] heart is what? Salvation of my two boys.
[51:40] He said I give them to you in the name
[51:41] of Jesus Christ.
[51:44] You can also speak to weather just like
[51:47] Jesus spoke to the storm. He said be
[51:49] still and and the winds and waves obeyed
[51:52] him.
[51:53] All that is is what Jesus said. If you
[51:56] say and don't doubt, you can have what
[51:58] you say. It's mature power. It's it's
[52:02] mature character with the power of the
[52:04] word.
[52:06] And again, healing. Uh Ma's uh Ma had
[52:09] that that cancer, that tumor, and
[52:11] brother Bam said before the doctor will
[52:12] touch it, it'll be vanish. And it did.
[52:15] And there was a there was two witnesses
[52:16] there, the doctor and sister Mita's
[52:18] friend. I can't remember her name right
[52:19] now. Okay.
[52:22] Now, these are just quotes that I just
[52:24] basically rehearsed to you.
[52:26] Okay. Now, brother Ram also says the
[52:28] third poll was the opening of the word
[52:30] or the mysteries revealed. So, see
[52:33] there's lots of elements of this. You
[52:34] can speak the word or you can preach the
[52:36] word. Amen. Hallelujah.
[52:40] Now, the one that's this I put a
[52:41] question mark because this is a little
[52:42] mysterious to me. Brother Ram said the
[52:45] third pole of Jesus ministry was
[52:46] preaching to the eternal lost in the
[52:47] heart of the earth. But to me, the
[52:49] reason I don't understand this is
[52:50] because Jesus had a ministry after that.
[52:52] He had a resurrection ministry. Well,
[52:54] that makes four poles, but there's only
[52:56] three poles. So, Brother Bam, you know,
[52:58] he never made this he never made this
[53:00] like a a absolute thus sayith the Lord
[53:02] doctrine. In fact, he called he called
[53:04] that sermon souls under prison now. He
[53:06] said, "This is the only time I've ever
[53:07] done a sermon of I'm presuming."
[53:11] He said, "But it'll be scriptural." But
[53:12] he also said, "I'll be presuming."
[53:15] Okay?
[53:17] Now, yes, Noah preached the eternal
[53:19] loss, right? Once the door was closed,
[53:21] he preached eternal loss. So there is
[53:22] some Bible foundation about this. But
[53:25] I'm just letting you know Jesus had a
[53:26] ministry church after he resurrected and
[53:28] the church said I just preached on the
[53:30] spirit of burning. He's walking and he
[53:32] preaches to Cleopus and his friend for
[53:34] three hours. He preaches about himself.
[53:36] This is me. This is me in Genesis,
[53:38] Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy.
[53:39] This is me all through the Bible. And
[53:41] they still don't recognize him. But he
[53:44] had a ministry. Praise God. And they
[53:46] told him, "Go wait 10 days in Jerusalem.
[53:48] Wait up there in the upper room until
[53:50] you're in due with power from on high.
[53:51] That's what we need today. We need some
[53:53] power from on high today. Praise God. We
[53:56] need the Holy Ghost to visit this
[53:57] church. Praise God. Amen. Hallelujah.
[54:01] How many want the visitation of the Holy
[54:03] Ghost? Absolutely.
[54:07] Now, let's read these quotes here. So,
[54:09] here third pole, first pole, healing.
[54:11] Second poll, prophesying or discernment.
[54:13] Third poll, the opening of the word, the
[54:15] mysteries revealed.
[54:17] So I just want you to see the third pole
[54:19] has numerous characteristics to it. It's
[54:22] not just speaking the word. It's
[54:24] actually revealing the meaning of the
[54:26] word.
[54:28] Okay. So does what does that mean? It
[54:29] means when brother preached the seven
[54:30] seals, that was the third poll.
[54:33] Right? Everybody got that? I haven't
[54:36] lost anybody. Everybody still Everybody
[54:39] still listening? Okay, good. I haven't
[54:41] lost you to uh to what you're doing
[54:43] after service. Okay. I haven't lost.
[54:45] Okay. All right. Let's focus on in here
[54:46] by God's grace. And remember, the third
[54:49] pole is the opening of them seven seals
[54:51] to reveal the hidden truth that's been
[54:52] sealed in the word. Do you see it? I see
[54:54] it. Amen, brother.
[54:57] Now, here's the one where he says the
[54:58] third pole was a third ministry
[55:00] preaching to the eternal lost. And
[55:01] brother also said Jesus preached after
[55:03] the resurrection. That was a ministry,
[55:04] too.
[55:07] Now, here's the here's where we feel
[55:10] that the third pole will have a special
[55:12] manifestation right before the rapture.
[55:14] Brother Ram says look away to Jesus. So
[55:17] I'm going to say something to you now I
[55:19] haven't said all along. And that is the
[55:20] thing we've been looked for for so long
[55:22] for at least many four or five years or
[55:24] maybe longer. The third pole has now
[55:25] been vindicated. And I'm sure you all
[55:27] know what it is. Yes, we do. It's
[55:29] speaking the word. It's the revelation
[55:31] of the word.
[55:33] Right at this now time, it's just
[55:35] happened. So you could identify its
[55:36] presence among you. See, but it will not
[55:38] be used in a great way until the council
[55:40] begins to tighten up. And when it does,
[55:43] the Pentecostals and so forth can almost
[55:45] impersonate anything can be done. But
[55:47] when you see that time comes when the
[55:49] squeeze comes down, in other words, when
[55:51] the the politicians start putting
[55:52] pressure that they're going to kill
[55:53] Christians,
[55:55] then you'll see what we've seen
[55:56] temporarily be manifest in the fullness
[55:59] of its power. See, so brother Abraham
[56:02] thought the third poll, he thought the
[56:04] Christians would be anointed with
[56:05] rapturing faith to speak the word right
[56:07] before the rapture because it's an
[56:10] anointing. Hallelujah.
[56:13] Now, we don't know all that they're
[56:14] going to speak, but brother Ram says
[56:15] it'll be used in a great way, but
[56:18] remember what man calls great, God calls
[56:20] foolish.
[56:21] Hallelujah.
[56:23] And brother Ram also said it won't be a
[56:24] public show, too.
[56:27] We won't be walking around before the
[56:28] rapture saying, "Look what I can do.
[56:29] Look what I can do. That's not how God
[56:30] operates.
[56:32] God's power is not a little uh magic
[56:34] wand you can wing around and do whatever
[56:36] you want. No sir. It's character with
[56:39] power. Hallelujah. It's Christlike
[56:41] character. It's not going to be a public
[56:43] show.
[56:47] And everyone knows as first as certain
[56:49] as the first poll was identified, so has
[56:51] the second been identified. If you'll
[56:53] think real closely, you who are
[56:54] spiritual, got any spiritual people in
[56:56] here today? As the Bible said, here's
[56:58] him that has wisdom. The third pole is
[57:00] properly identified. We know it is. See,
[57:02] the third pole is here. It's so sacred.
[57:04] I mustn't say much about it. I like this
[57:07] because it speaks for itself.
[57:10] Amen. Hallelujah. It speaks. This
[57:12] mountain has to move. Hallelujah. Oh my.
[57:15] Well, we just saw it move. So, it speaks
[57:17] for itself.
[57:19] The word operates. The word is the only
[57:21] thing that has life. The word is the
[57:23] only thing that defeats Satan.
[57:24] Hallelujah. Amen. It speaks for itself.
[57:28] When the word is spoken and it goes into
[57:30] into motion, that's the word. When a
[57:32] word is spoken and it's fulfilled,
[57:34] that's the word speaking for itself.
[57:37] All right, everybody getting it now? You
[57:40] see some nods there? Okay, heard a few
[57:42] amens. All right, I'll take that. Better
[57:44] than no amens.
[57:46] Now, look what brother says. I must lay
[57:49] quiet. What? The third pole is just
[57:51] operating, but I must lay quiet just for
[57:53] a little bit while now remember you
[57:56] who's listening to this tape like Bride
[57:57] of Christ Fellowship.
[58:00] You might see such a change in my
[58:01] ministry right away. Dropping back, not
[58:03] going up. Oh, not getting more powerful.
[58:07] Dropping back. We're right at the age
[58:09] now. It can't be can't go any further.
[58:11] We have to wait just a minute until this
[58:13] happens over here. In other words, the
[58:14] squeeze, the pressure, the political
[58:16] pressure has to come on in order for the
[58:18] latter rain to fall.
[58:20] Then the time comes, but it's thoroughly
[58:23] identified.
[58:25] When did the greatest miracles happen in
[58:27] brother Ram's ministry? Towards the
[58:28] beginning, right? Towards the beginning.
[58:31] Think about Congressman Upshaw, the
[58:33] pillar of fire picture.
[58:35] Uh so many great miracles.
[58:39] So, Brother Ram even says it here at the
[58:41] end of 1963. I'm not going to get
[58:43] greater and greater and greater. He
[58:45] said, I'm going to drop back. I'm not
[58:46] going to grow go up into greater greater
[58:48] miracles all the time because it has to
[58:51] catch up. Prophecy has to catch up.
[58:54] Okay?
[58:57] Now, look, brother uh was asked, "Is the
[58:59] third pole speaking the word?" He says,
[59:01] "Yes." You got a good statement there.
[59:02] So, it's speaking the word. And now, let
[59:05] me say this too for the young people.
[59:06] Now, young people, young girls and young
[59:08] boys, you can speak the word as well,
[59:10] but you have to have the anointing of
[59:12] God to do it. You might try it and it
[59:15] might fail. Well, that means you you
[59:16] didn't wait for God to tell you. So, you
[59:19] just say, "Lord, I'm sorry. Help me to
[59:21] wait and be more patient to the next
[59:23] time." But don't have to be just Brother
[59:25] Jesse or anybody else. It can be you.
[59:28] You can speak the word as well, but you
[59:30] better know it's God speaking through
[59:31] you.
[59:33] Which means you'll be so reverent, so
[59:35] obedient. You won't be prideful. You'll
[59:37] just believe God's word. Hallelujah.
[59:45] So church, what what is the third pole?
[59:46] It's basically Matthew 17. Verily I say
[59:50] unto you, if you have faith, the grain
[59:52] faith as a grain of mustard seed, you
[59:54] shall say to this mountain, remove hence
[59:55] the yonder place, and it shall remove,
[59:57] and nothing shall be impossible unto
[59:58] you. How be it this kind goeth not out
[1:00:01] by but by prayer and fasting. So
[1:00:03] sometimes you can speak the word.
[1:00:04] Sometimes you got to pray and fast. Now,
[1:00:07] that's the thing most Americans don't
[1:00:08] want to do. Pray and fast. Hallelujah.
[1:00:11] But if you want to see the power of God
[1:00:12] in your life, you have to pray and fast.
[1:00:16] Matthew 21:21, "Verily, truly I say to
[1:00:19] you, if you have faith and doubt not, ye
[1:00:20] shall not only do that which is done to
[1:00:22] this fig tree, curse the fig tree, but
[1:00:24] also if you shall say, this mountain, be
[1:00:26] thou removed, be thou cast in the sea,
[1:00:28] it shall be done.
[1:00:32] And all these things whatsoever you ask
[1:00:33] in prayer, believing, ye shall receive."
[1:00:36] And remember I told you story Brian
[1:00:37] Hawkins, right? He was here. I spoke to
[1:00:39] hips that can't regenerate and they
[1:00:41] regenerated.
[1:00:43] That's his testimony.
[1:00:45] Hallelujah.
[1:00:46] That's as simple as this. Just some just
[1:00:48] praying and speaking life, speaking
[1:00:50] God's power to move on somebody. It's so
[1:00:53] simple. It don't have to be something
[1:00:54] you think about. I wasn't planning on
[1:00:56] doing that. I went to that and Lyd and I
[1:00:57] even had McDonald's afterwards. Where's
[1:00:58] Lyd? I would didn't I didn't choose a
[1:01:00] healthy meal afterwards. But even after
[1:01:02] that, God still honored my words. God
[1:01:04] still honored my because it wasn't my
[1:01:05] word. It was his word. Praise God. I was
[1:01:08] just going there so Lydia could have
[1:01:09] some fellowship at a youth group. I
[1:01:10] didn't know I was going to go there and
[1:01:11] God was going to do a miracle and God
[1:01:13] was going to speak the word. But church,
[1:01:15] what do we just got to be ready at all
[1:01:16] time and season? Be instant in season
[1:01:19] and out of season. If somebody tells you
[1:01:22] something like really bad and you get
[1:01:23] moved by it, well that's God. That's God
[1:01:27] trying to get you to pray for that
[1:01:28] person.
[1:01:30] Hallelujah.
[1:01:32] Like last night, Zion burned his finger
[1:01:34] and he said, "Daddy, pray for me. He's
[1:01:36] like, "Daddy, pray Jesus will take this
[1:01:37] away." I prayed there. I prayed with
[1:01:39] tears. I was crying in his bed. And I I
[1:01:43] wanted God to do a literal miracle.
[1:01:44] Well, he went to bed and now he feels
[1:01:45] good today. So, God heard my humble
[1:01:48] prayer just because he went to bed.
[1:01:50] But it's just that moment like he's
[1:01:52] crying. Well, I need to feel that pain.
[1:01:53] Why don't I? So, I said, "God, help me
[1:01:55] to feel that pain." And I prayed until
[1:01:56] he fell asleep and I was crying asking
[1:01:58] God to heal him. But that's just an
[1:02:00] example. When you feel someone's in in
[1:02:02] trouble or needs help, stop right there
[1:02:03] and pray for them.
[1:02:05] Just that's just being sensitive to the
[1:02:07] Holy Spirit. You never know when God's
[1:02:08] going to do a miracle, but you got to be
[1:02:10] available so he can do a miracle.
[1:02:13] Remember he said it earlier because of
[1:02:15] their doubting. Remember Jesus said
[1:02:16] because their unbelief, miracles can't
[1:02:18] be done. So we got to confess our sins
[1:02:21] and get back into faith and then God can
[1:02:23] use us for miracles
[1:02:25] if God wants to do that. Hallelujah.
[1:02:31] And here's the one brother used the
[1:02:33] most. He always called it Mark 11. He
[1:02:34] said, "Mark 11 was always such a mystery
[1:02:36] to me until the Lord showed me what it
[1:02:38] was." Have faith in God. For verily I
[1:02:41] say unto you, that whosoever shall say
[1:02:42] of this mountain, "Be thou removed, and
[1:02:44] be thou cast in the sea," and shall not
[1:02:46] doubt in his heart, but shall believe
[1:02:48] that those things which he saith shall
[1:02:50] come to pass, he shall have whatsoever
[1:02:52] he saith.
[1:02:54] Therefore, I say unto you, what things
[1:02:55] soever you desire when you pray, believe
[1:02:57] that you receive them, and you shall
[1:02:59] have them. And when you stand praying,
[1:03:01] forgive. Now, here we get a good clue
[1:03:03] here. God's not going to do what we ask
[1:03:05] if we don't forgive other people.
[1:03:08] Right?
[1:03:10] We got and the only way we can have
[1:03:11] faith in God is if we forgive other
[1:03:13] people, right? Or confess our sins. If
[1:03:16] you have a against any that your father
[1:03:18] which also is in heaven may forgive you
[1:03:20] of your trespasses. But if you do not
[1:03:22] forgive, neither will your father which
[1:03:24] is in heaven forgive your trespasses.
[1:03:27] Hallelujah.
[1:03:30] Now, let's get back to the master
[1:03:31] masterpiece. Let me I'm gonna escape
[1:03:33] real quick to see how how long I got
[1:03:34] because what casea how long has it been
[1:03:36] on? I could always ask you how much
[1:03:37] time.
[1:03:39] Oh, I've already been an hour. Okay,
[1:03:41] that's surprising to me. All right, let
[1:03:44] me see. Um,
[1:03:46] thank you, brother. I appreciate your
[1:03:47] zeal.
[1:03:50] Uh,
[1:03:52] that that's good. Uh, since I'm over, I
[1:03:55] will finish up here. Okay. So, lock in
[1:03:57] here. Last last thought. Last thought.
[1:04:01] I'm learning, you know, with Mai get up
[1:04:02] early and Austin had one time had to get
[1:04:04] up early to go factory work. I'm
[1:04:06] learning to preach a little less by
[1:04:07] God's grace. Right, honey?
[1:04:11] Yeah. Trying.
[1:04:14] Okay. So,
[1:04:16] this masterpiece, the masterpiece is the
[1:04:18] wheat grain, the life flowing through
[1:04:21] the wheat. And now, church, you are a
[1:04:23] plant as well. The Bible said you're
[1:04:25] like a tree. There it is. Amen. Psalm
[1:04:27] one, you're like a tree planted by
[1:04:30] rivers of living water.
[1:04:32] Hallelujah.
[1:04:34] You are like a tree planted by living
[1:04:36] waters. In other words, the life of God
[1:04:39] has to flow through you,
[1:04:43] church. If if we have sins in our life,
[1:04:45] the life can't flow through us. And let
[1:04:48] me show you the visual here. This is the
[1:04:50] visual Brother used. Uh, and you've seen
[1:04:52] it before, but I'm just going to give
[1:04:54] you a visual. Brother Ram got the three.
[1:04:56] Here's the three parts of man. Okay, the
[1:04:57] tabernacle man. Body. Now, this is
[1:05:00] Larkin. L Clarence Larkin said the soul
[1:05:03] and then the spirit. But brother Bam
[1:05:04] switched them.
[1:05:06] The soul is the innermost part. But I
[1:05:09] want you to see down here. Look church.
[1:05:11] Look, there's there's five channels to
[1:05:13] get in here, right? Sight, smell,
[1:05:15] hearing, taste, touch. That's there's
[1:05:17] five channels to get into this body,
[1:05:19] right? To get this court. But there's
[1:05:22] five channels. Affection, reason,
[1:05:24] memory, conscious, imagination. There's
[1:05:25] also five channels to get down into your
[1:05:27] soul.
[1:05:29] In other words, for God to get into your
[1:05:31] soul so you can get saved or get filled
[1:05:34] with the Holy Ghost. These are channels.
[1:05:37] Brother Brandham calls the word flu.
[1:05:39] Where's the word?
[1:05:42] Flu. A flu is a pipe.
[1:05:46] Okay. So, at our school, we used to have
[1:05:47] flu or pipes that carried hot air in
[1:05:50] them because we we had a boiler. We have
[1:05:51] a boiler in the boiler room. It boils up
[1:05:53] all this water and then it shoots all
[1:05:55] this hot air out through the flu. Now,
[1:05:57] we got different heating now by God's
[1:06:00] grace, but that's the old style. The flu
[1:06:03] is just a pipe. Well, church, every now
[1:06:05] and then, we wouldn't get heat and
[1:06:07] there'd have to have to go check there's
[1:06:08] a little there's a clogging in the flu,
[1:06:12] right? Or the boiler's down. Thank
[1:06:13] goodness the boiler never went down.
[1:06:15] We'd be freezing in there. But every now
[1:06:17] and then there was a clogging up. one of
[1:06:20] the pipes got clogged up by something.
[1:06:22] Maybe it was buildup or dust or
[1:06:24] something like that, muck, and we
[1:06:27] weren't getting the heat. Well, that's
[1:06:29] the same way it is for you and I.
[1:06:31] Sometimes the praises, listen, church,
[1:06:33] sometimes we don't praise God as much
[1:06:34] because something's clogged up in our
[1:06:36] lives.
[1:06:38] So, see, it works both ways. Sometimes
[1:06:41] praise doesn't come out because it's
[1:06:42] clogged up. And sometimes we can't get
[1:06:44] revelation from God because things are
[1:06:46] clogged up. We can't get it in or out.
[1:06:50] Then people will come to church and and
[1:06:52] they'll just sit and listen the whole
[1:06:53] time and be distracted or something like
[1:06:55] that and then nothing ever comes in,
[1:06:57] nothing ever goes out. That's because
[1:06:59] flu are clogged up. And brother, why
[1:07:01] didn't brother preach this? In the
[1:07:03] greatest battle ever fought, it's the
[1:07:06] battlefield of your mind. Hallelujah.
[1:07:11] Brother Ram said, "God will heal you
[1:07:12] right now in this atmosphere of the Holy
[1:07:14] Ghost where he set you. God will give it
[1:07:15] to you. Just believe it." Amen. Open up
[1:07:17] them flues. So, see, some people can
[1:07:18] either clog them up or they can close
[1:07:20] them. Well, I'm not receiving nothing
[1:07:21] from God today. I don't I don't want to
[1:07:23] hear nothing the preacher says. I don't
[1:07:24] want to hear nothing. That's I don't
[1:07:26] want to hear any of those songs today.
[1:07:28] I'm not going to read my Bible today.
[1:07:30] They close up the flu. Brother says,
[1:07:33] "Open them up." Right? Open them up and
[1:07:37] let the love of God come down so that
[1:07:39] the love of God can go back up. Praise
[1:07:41] God. Hallelujah.
[1:07:44] And church, this happens to all of us,
[1:07:46] right? Affection is when we love
[1:07:47] something more than Christ, right?
[1:07:49] That's an idol. Affection means you're
[1:07:50] love. Reason is when you when you when
[1:07:52] you think of something that's uh a wrong
[1:07:54] reason, right? You give a wrong reason
[1:07:56] why you you should why you should do
[1:07:58] something or not do something, right?
[1:08:00] Memory, you get you let a bad memory get
[1:08:02] in your mind and it clogs up your worst.
[1:08:04] It you're thinking about that more than
[1:08:05] you're thinking about God.
[1:08:09] Uh conscience, you're you have a guilty
[1:08:11] conscience. Well, God will never forgive
[1:08:12] me. How could God ever forgive that?
[1:08:14] Because the blood was shed. That's how
[1:08:15] God could forgive you. But we let Satan
[1:08:17] beat up our conscience. Oh, then
[1:08:19] imagination. You're imagining the wrong
[1:08:21] things. Brother Ram says you're crossing
[1:08:23] bridges before you get to them. How do
[1:08:26] you know that's going to happen
[1:08:26] tomorrow? You haven't even been there
[1:08:28] yet. But I know the one who already has
[1:08:30] been there. Amen. Hallelujah. And Jesus
[1:08:33] can work it out. Jesus can change the
[1:08:35] situation. Amen. You don't have to
[1:08:38] figure out tomorrow.
[1:08:40] Now, it al also could be lustly
[1:08:42] imaginations or prideful imaginations.
[1:08:44] uh things, anything, any imagination and
[1:08:46] it clogs up the worship where the word
[1:08:48] of God can't get in and the praise of
[1:08:50] God cannot get out. What is it? It's
[1:08:53] life flowing.
[1:08:56] But a man's talking about a man who
[1:08:58] sinned with his old reasoning. Well, I'm
[1:08:59] I think he was talking about cigarettes.
[1:09:00] It's okay for me to smoke or drink
[1:09:02] because of this that I've gone through
[1:09:03] the war. I've gone through trouble. That
[1:09:05] man got done got away from this old
[1:09:07] reasoning. He done cleaned the flu out.
[1:09:10] Okay? Then he repents of that. See, he
[1:09:11] done cleaned it out. see his conscience.
[1:09:15] So in order to really praise God, you
[1:09:17] got to clean out all these channels.
[1:09:20] Hallelujah. Amen. Then the life of God
[1:09:22] can flow.
[1:09:24] I got a couple one more here. Preach.
[1:09:26] Remember these?
[1:09:27] Another way to call is a stronghold,
[1:09:30] right? You have a soul and you have your
[1:09:32] spirit.
[1:09:34] How many remember this? It's my last
[1:09:36] one, right? My last That's my last one.
[1:09:37] My last slide. Believe that or not?
[1:09:39] Believe it or not, my last one. So,
[1:09:41] another way to say it is praise can't
[1:09:44] get in if the devil's built up a
[1:09:46] stronghold in your memory. I just
[1:09:48] remember that person did that to me or
[1:09:50] that brother or that sister. Well, go to
[1:09:52] them. Go talk to them. That's what Jesus
[1:09:54] said. If somebody offends you, go talk
[1:09:55] to them one-on-one, right? And if that
[1:09:57] doesn't work, go take somebody else with
[1:09:58] you. I was telling that somebody on the
[1:09:59] phone yesterday was different problems
[1:10:01] in churches. And I'm like, do what math
[1:10:03] do what m do what Jesus said. If
[1:10:05] somebody hurts your feelings, go talk to
[1:10:06] them face to face, right?
[1:10:09] uh then get somebody else then take it
[1:10:10] to the church. That's all we got to do.
[1:10:14] But see now God can't get through here.
[1:10:16] This this pipe God can't get through
[1:10:18] this pipe because Satan has built
[1:10:19] something up there. And remember the
[1:10:21] same thing can be in all five of the
[1:10:24] channels. That's a really bad state when
[1:10:26] people can't get God can't flow through
[1:10:28] any of these.
[1:10:30] Right? And yet we know brother Random
[1:10:32] had a critical spirit. Right? So that
[1:10:34] might have be a reasoning. I'm not sure.
[1:10:37] But he would even preach with this one
[1:10:39] clogged up. Remember he said that he
[1:10:41] said, "I'm haunted." He said, "You pray
[1:10:42] for me. I've got a critical spirit."
[1:10:43] What's he he's admitting he's got a clog
[1:10:45] in his pipes. And the church said, "Now,
[1:10:47] you've all had pipes clogged up before
[1:10:49] at the sink." And the church said, "What
[1:10:51] do you got to do? Take it out or call
[1:10:54] the plumber." I just call the hanger. I
[1:10:56] take the hanger and pull it out there.
[1:10:58] That's what I do. Unless I can't get it,
[1:11:00] then I call the the plumber.
[1:11:03] But church, we all get sinks clogged up.
[1:11:06] We all get flu clogged up and so you
[1:11:08] have to unclog them. That's called
[1:11:10] repentance.
[1:11:12] And then the life you'll see, you'll
[1:11:13] feel the life flow down into you and
[1:11:16] then you'll see the praise of God, the
[1:11:17] worship, the prayer come right out of
[1:11:19] you. The life flowing through the temple
[1:11:22] of God and the church said, "Let's stand
[1:11:24] to our feet." I thought it'd be a good
[1:11:27] topic for communion today by God's
[1:11:29] grace.
[1:11:31] Musicians can
[1:11:36] How many love the word? How many love
[1:11:37] the message of the hour? Praise God. I
[1:11:39] love it. I love it. Amen. I love it.
