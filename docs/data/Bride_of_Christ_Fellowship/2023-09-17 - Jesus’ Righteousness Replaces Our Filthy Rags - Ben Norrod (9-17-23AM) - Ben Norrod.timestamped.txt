[0:01] Isaiah 64: 6 all right but we are all as
[0:07] unclean an unclean thing and our
[0:10] righteousness
[0:11] as filthy rags and our righteousness are
[0:15] as filthy rags and
[0:17] we all do Fade as a leaf and our
[0:21] iniquities like the wind have taken us
[0:24] away now listen to that again but we are
[0:26] all as an unclean thing and our
[0:30] righteousnesses notice that the plural
[0:32] part of that our righteousness is is
[0:37] plural are as filthy rags and we all do
[0:41] Fade as a leaf and our iniquities like
[0:43] the wind have taken us away now the uh
[0:46] the word that um Isaiah uses here for
[0:49] unclean is to be unclean both ethically
[0:54] which means humanly or within a human
[0:56] being and also religiously because you
[0:59] realize that
[1:00] Doctrine false Doctrine incorrect
[1:02] Doctrine can make you unclean before the
[1:04] Lord as well now listen to this in a
[1:06] message called God's covenant with
[1:08] Abraham brother says I haven't got
[1:11] nothing to offer my utmost righteousness
[1:13] to yours would be filthy rags in his
[1:16] sight right so I'm a sinner to begin
[1:18] with there's nothing that I could do
[1:20] about it but there's something that he
[1:21] could do he took his son's blood and
[1:25] covered it over me like that I love that
[1:27] statement so he sees me as a right ous
[1:30] man because his son's blood made me
[1:34] righteous let's pray together with the
[1:35] word thank you Heavenly Father we're so
[1:38] thankful for the opportunity to come
[1:39] into your house this morning Lord what a
[1:41] privilege it is to be your sons and your
[1:43] daughters father to be called by thy
[1:46] name and Lord as we come into this place
[1:48] we do so in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:50] asking you to not only take your word
[1:52] and speak to us but Lord you would Grant
[1:54] to us an audience with your presence
[1:56] that we might be able to go into the
[1:58] holy of holies and be able to commune
[2:00] with you face to face ear to ear mouth
[2:02] to mouth and so on and so forth then we
[2:05] pray Lord Jesus that you would not only
[2:07] take your word and speak to us this
[2:08] morning by it but use me Lord as an
[2:10] instrument to get out of the way that
[2:12] you might speak through me Lord open up
[2:15] the hearts and the minds and the lives
[2:17] and the ears of your children and so
[2:18] forth Lord that they might be able to
[2:20] receive that which you would Place Into
[2:23] the Heart of every single man woman Boy
[2:26] Child every who they might be Lord May
[2:28] the Holy Spirit speak to us Lord and
[2:31] give us of thy favor and thy unction as
[2:33] we look into the things of God as we
[2:34] commit this to you now Lord in the name
[2:36] of Jesus Christ we pray and all the
[2:39] saints said amen you may be seated may
[2:41] the Lord bless you really good and we
[2:44] sure appreciate the Lord and and his his
[2:46] Mercy to us and once again I'm just glad
[2:48] to be a Christian aren't you amen I'm
[2:51] glad to be a Christian now now sister
[2:53] and I'm using this right you got this
[2:54] all connected here you don't need any
[2:57] mic from me in any way just just this
[2:59] right here is okay unless you want it
[3:00] brother no I'm fine myself just I want
[3:02] to make sure I wasn't interrupt in your
[3:03] recording program all right you're good
[3:06] sh live stream there oh I got you okay
[3:08] hello everybody God bless you very much
[3:10] amen amen I um appreciate the Lord I
[3:14] want to just talk a little while the
[3:15] Lord will help me upon obtaining the
[3:17] favor of God and uh I've got a couple
[3:20] things if the Lord will help me get to
[3:21] it that um I want to talk about
[3:24] including humility and uh you know and
[3:27] inspiration of the Lord and a few of
[3:28] those kind of things but I I just want
[3:30] to lay a
[3:31] foundation uh for just a little bit upon
[3:34] uh my thoughts and the way that I want
[3:36] to try to project this about the uh
[3:39] righteousness of a human being and I
[3:41] think if I can kind of get this in at
[3:43] the beginning here all these other
[3:45] things that we're going to kind of carry
[3:46] on with we'll be able to really bring
[3:48] out a uh a solid understanding about
[3:51] humility what true humility looks like
[3:54] and then what it means to be humble and
[3:56] what that really is biblically speaking
[3:58] and then I want to try to carry the Lord
[4:00] uh helping me into uh a little thought
[4:02] about inspiration of the Lord so there
[4:05] there's there's the agenda there's the
[4:06] list everything you know and so I I I
[4:09] we'll see how it goes you know when you
[4:11] want to make God laugh you just tell him
[4:13] your plans ain't that right amen but
[4:15] anyways we're just going to try to
[4:17] follow the spirit of the Lord the best
[4:18] we can but I I do feel like it's
[4:20] important to kind of get some of these
[4:22] subjects in for us because I think as
[4:24] the people of God we've arrived at a
[4:26] place in time where quite honestly we we
[4:30] should know some of this material way
[4:32] more than we know it and I I say this
[4:35] almost to our shame in a way but really
[4:38] church people and uh people that follow
[4:40] the message of the hour you would think
[4:42] folks know their Bible better than what
[4:44] they do but they don't pray they don't
[4:45] read they don't study like they should
[4:47] and and preachers are all the time
[4:48] hitting up against brick walls trying to
[4:50] get people somewhere until after a while
[4:52] some preachers just throw their hand up
[4:53] and say you can't beat them join them
[4:55] and then everything just becomes some
[4:56] kind of fluffy sermon where everybody's
[4:58] saved and going to heaven and there's no
[5:00] reason to dig no reason to pray or labor
[5:02] but I think the real body of Christ I'm
[5:04] talking about the real ones now I think
[5:06] they want to know where they stand in
[5:08] terms of righteousness Holiness and
[5:09] everything don't you think so I believe
[5:11] as a child of God I want to know where
[5:13] my feet are I want to know exactly what
[5:16] calling that the Lord has called me to I
[5:18] don't want to be set in a position or in
[5:19] a place to where I don't know how I'm
[5:21] supposed to act behave or be pleasing to
[5:24] the Lord and I certainly want his favor
[5:26] don't you think so I want to know how
[5:28] that I can obtain that favor of God and
[5:30] as we read in this beginning scripture
[5:32] this opening text here Isaiah is really
[5:35] dragging us through the mud and I'm
[5:37] going to say this because I'm in a mixed
[5:39] audience this way he's really taking us
[5:41] through the uh through the dirt and the
[5:43] filth and the gum of what our
[5:44] righteousness really looks like in the
[5:47] eyes of God and when you look at the
[5:49] term filthy rags it's an unsanitary
[5:52] thing it's a thing that's repulsive it's
[5:54] a thing that's uh it's certainly not
[5:57] dinner conversation and it's certainly
[5:58] not conversation that people want to
[6:00] have uh of things that are done in the
[6:02] dark should never be spoke in the light
[6:04] that's what a filthy rag would be
[6:06] something that is so uh Gammy and
[6:09] ungodly and horrible that a human being
[6:12] would never even want to even discuss
[6:14] the thing much leave let's have a
[6:16] conversation about the whole thing and
[6:18] yet that's what the way God looks at
[6:20] self-made righteous self-made Holiness
[6:23] is that in the eyes of God and we want
[6:25] to understand that for you and I to be
[6:27] the right kind of people to be the right
[6:29] kind of Christians God is Not depending
[6:32] upon us to find some way to be holy
[6:34] within ourselves are you with me amen
[6:37] but he wants us to completely and solely
[6:40] depend upon the grace of God that takes
[6:43] away the sin of the world and not just
[6:45] the sin of this world but the sin of
[6:46] this world right here amen I want to be
[6:49] so dedicated I want to be so committed
[6:52] to him that when it comes to being
[6:54] righteous in his eyes I don't want to
[6:56] have to stand there and say well Lord
[6:58] you know you done that and I done that
[7:00] and us together we did such and such but
[7:02] I want to be able to say Lord Beyond any
[7:05] shadow of doubt in my mind whatsoever I
[7:07] wouldn't be the man that I am today had
[7:09] not it been for the grace and the mercy
[7:11] of God that his son's blood would cover
[7:14] me to make me righteous and clean in the
[7:17] eyes of God and I believe that when it
[7:19] comes to the favor of God having the
[7:22] favor of God is something that comes
[7:24] along with this act of God in your heart
[7:26] for example when the Lord first saves
[7:28] you and you come uh my repentance into
[7:30] the Christian church and now you're
[7:32] beginning to understand what it means to
[7:34] be saved and forgiven of all of your
[7:36] past sins amen the Lord will show grace
[7:39] to you and favor to you and give you
[7:41] opportunities to straighten out and
[7:43] correct and do things then as he brings
[7:45] you to the spot of sanctification it's
[7:47] not an action that we do I I wish folks
[7:50] around the church would get this idea
[7:51] out of their mind that true
[7:53] sanctification is when you decided to
[7:55] quit smoking or lusting or cussing or
[7:57] whatever you did that that's yourself
[7:59] made sanctification true sanctification
[8:01] of God is when the Holy Ghost went down
[8:04] in your spirit and cleaned you out and
[8:06] gave you a new spirit so that you could
[8:08] be agreeable with the word of God Amen
[8:10] that's what the Bible said I can't help
[8:11] that that's what the Bible said amen and
[8:14] no matter what message preacher tries to
[8:15] twist that around or what other kind of
[8:17] preacher tries to turn that around and
[8:19] make it just a believe the prophet or
[8:21] believe the message or come to church
[8:23] and be a good person and clean yourself
[8:25] up a little bit and you'll be Sanctified
[8:27] without the Holy Ghost sanctification
[8:29] that's one of the reasons we don't have
[8:31] the new birth here so much people right
[8:34] on putting before the and walk off and
[8:36] leave the whole thing amen and what do
[8:38] you do when you get a person like that
[8:40] you get a Pharisee right right you get a
[8:43] sadducee you get an actor I heard
[8:44] brother B say it this morning he was
[8:46] talking about enticing spirits and he
[8:48] said now we get uh actions and things in
[8:51] the body from these demons he said
[8:53] that's the powers and Supernatural
[8:54] Powers he said it's even proven to be a
[8:57] fourth dimension disease he said said
[8:59] all disease and things like that come
[9:00] from fourth dimension and he said and
[9:03] these Devils will move in the form of
[9:05] the physical cancers and things like
[9:07] that he said but then the human being
[9:09] has that in their soul he said but at
[9:11] the same time a person that has this in
[9:14] their soul he said you see there's never
[9:16] been a person that could ever genuinely
[9:19] be a li test he said the human being
[9:22] wasn't made to lie and he said they sit
[9:25] before that lie detector and it catches
[9:26] right quick in that subconscious that
[9:28] they're telling something that ain't
[9:29] true now we've had people down through
[9:32] the years that's learned how to beat a
[9:33] li test that's how Wicked and
[9:34] indifferent we' become in the last days
[9:37] to where they've seared their own
[9:38] conscience with such a hot iron that
[9:40] they don't even know when they're lying
[9:41] anymore deceived by the thing but human
[9:44] beings were not made to be that way and
[9:46] brother man said I heard him say it this
[9:47] morning if a person then would have all
[9:50] of that inside of him amen knowing that
[9:53] they they they they can't tell something
[9:55] wrong and then declare to be a Christian
[9:57] you said that heart will tell them
[9:58] you're you're just an actor you're not
[10:00] really genuinely Born Again of the Holy
[10:02] Spirit and in that regard amen this is
[10:05] exactly where sanctification comes in
[10:08] sanctification takes you to the level
[10:11] Amen to where you're no longer an
[10:13] actor but now you're genuinely moving on
[10:16] Lord I need to be right with you I need
[10:19] to be clean and set aside for service so
[10:22] you can fill me with the holy ghost real
[10:25] genuine sanctification in the Church of
[10:26] the Living God would change a lot of our
[10:28] people around here
[10:29] sure would it would take a lot of these
[10:31] young people been raised up in the
[10:32] message and and and and given all the
[10:35] instructions and the rules and the rule
[10:36] book and the list of things they're
[10:38] allowed to do and not do and so forth
[10:40] and it would take all of that and all
[10:42] that adherence that they've given to
[10:43] those things and it would make it
[10:45] genuine and make it real in their heart
[10:47] rather than just putting on the show
[10:48] because that's the way it is right amen
[10:51] listen I got girls of my own teenage
[10:54] girls and I told my babies the other day
[10:56] and I told a brother the other day we
[10:57] was talking about families and things I
[10:59] said look I said I'm not here to put the
[11:01] burden upon my girls to be bride I don't
[11:04] know if God's called them that way or
[11:05] not I can trust the Lord I can claim my
[11:08] inheritance but I don't know whether God
[11:09] made not one of my Youngs bride or not
[11:12] and I'm not going to put upon them the
[11:13] burden of being bride but I just want to
[11:15] see him saved amen I want to see God do
[11:18] something for him and wherever he
[11:19] carries him that's up to him not up to
[11:21] me but I don't want to try to make or
[11:24] force them to be someone that they're
[11:25] never going to be as I tell them they
[11:28] live in a my house you live under my
[11:30] rules the things that they when they
[11:32] break rules or whatever the thing might
[11:33] be I tell them this is not punishment
[11:35] this is
[11:37] protection because the idea is that we
[11:39] need to protect our loved ones keep them
[11:42] in an atmosphere where if they are a
[11:43] bride of Christ the Holy Ghost can
[11:46] regenerate that heart and bring them
[11:47] into the spot they need to be amen but I
[11:50] think what we've done is very pharc
[11:52] we've laid upon our churches and upon
[11:54] our families burdens that we ourselves
[11:56] are not willing to Bear up right sure we
[11:59] try to make people live right and do
[12:00] clean and act a certain Manner and all
[12:02] that kind of thing but at the end of the
[12:04] day there's not a preacher stands in the
[12:06] pull pit that can tow the line the way
[12:07] he preaches
[12:09] it oh you say well he shouldn't be
[12:11] preaching but I'm talking about the
[12:13] human side right no matter how much I
[12:16] might preach truth to you no matter how
[12:17] close I live to God there's still going
[12:20] to be an element in me in the eyes of
[12:22] God that's going to be like a filthy rag
[12:24] I'll never be able to come 100% that's
[12:26] why Jesus come for us folks amen that's
[12:29] why Jesus died cuz none of us could tow
[12:31] the line but God's grace provides for us
[12:35] a medium where we can step into the the
[12:38] river the flow of the River of Life and
[12:40] drink as of the Waters of the rivers of
[12:42] life amen and be able to thirst never
[12:46] again because our souls are being
[12:48] Satisfied by the great presence of
[12:51] almighty God the shik sh the indwelling
[12:54] presence of God God's bread that feeds
[12:56] our hungry Souls amen amen We Lay upon
[13:00] the church you got to be this you got to
[13:01] be that we've long forgotten the idea
[13:04] that none of us could be this or that
[13:05] right it's all being covered by the
[13:07] blood of Jesus Christ repenting and
[13:09] dying daily keeping our lives right
[13:11] before the Lord when we do something
[13:13] wrong go make that thing right and then
[13:15] keep throwing oursel on the mercies of
[13:16] God every day amen that's what brings
[13:19] the church
[13:20] along that's right that's what brings us
[13:23] into another statosphere amen and into
[13:26] another atmosphere not this idea of I
[13:28] will and God will and I will and you
[13:30] will and then God will do something but
[13:32] he said to Abraham I I know you can't do
[13:34] it that's right it's impossible for you
[13:37] to do it so I can't swear by you but
[13:39] I'll swear by
[13:41] myself you notice when he come to
[13:43] Abraham he just kept saying I'm looking
[13:44] here he said I will I will I will I will
[13:47] he never stopped and said Abraham what
[13:48] you going to offer he knew he couldn't
[13:50] offer anything he wasn't interested in
[13:52] what he could offer by the grace of God
[13:55] by faith are you saved not of works that
[13:57] any man could boast see there's the
[13:59] problem right there everybody wants to
[14:01] have a little boasting power folks want
[14:03] to say I got saved I came to the altar I
[14:05] done this before the Lord I was forgiven
[14:08] yeah but who's the one that did all that
[14:09] for you that's right amen not you done
[14:12] it within yourself but Christ done that
[14:14] for you amen my faith declares that he
[14:16] is that kind of God my faith declares
[14:19] that he is able to do those things my
[14:20] faith declares that his power is greater
[14:22] than I could ever imagine my faith
[14:24] declares he's the same yesterday today
[14:25] and forever my faith declares have he
[14:27] done it one time he can do it every
[14:29] single time my faith declares that if
[14:31] God's still calling amen the message of
[14:33] repentance is still alive and the Holy
[14:35] Ghost is still able to be received by
[14:37] all who receive it
[14:40] amen so he sees me as a righteous man
[14:43] not because of my own thing but because
[14:45] of what he's done amen you see trials
[14:48] and these type of things shape us into a
[14:51] thinking a mode of thinking a style of
[14:54] thinking an atmosphere of thinking it
[14:57] goes into our thought world
[14:59] and trials will steer us in a certain
[15:02] direction and where we get in the most
[15:04] trouble we could ever get into is when
[15:06] we start taking our own thought in the
[15:07] middle of a battle like that taking our
[15:10] own attitudes and our own thinking and
[15:11] saying well Lord I can figure this out
[15:13] but then he may he just turns up the
[15:15] heat degree by degree Crank by crank
[15:18] until finally you start yielding
[15:19] yourself over why does he do that not to
[15:22] be mean it's not punishment it's
[15:24] protection he's trying to give you a
[15:26] spot give you a place to where you can
[15:28] receive better character than what you
[15:29] were born with better character than
[15:31] what you were raised to have no matter
[15:33] how good your mom and dad might be I
[15:36] always think of when I think of good
[15:37] clean wholesome Godly families I always
[15:40] think of Jesse and Christen and I always
[15:42] think of how they've raised these kids
[15:43] to the glory of God you know and and if
[15:47] I was ever jealous or envious of
[15:48] anything it's that I would to God that I
[15:51] could be that kind of father be that
[15:54] kind of mother in our home Samantha and
[15:56] I would to God that we could do as good
[15:58] a job as was what I've seen in this
[15:59] little Church's family and I love what
[16:01] God's done for this little group right
[16:03] here and I think to myself Lord you know
[16:06] I I look at all of the traveling and all
[16:08] the mistakes I've made as a father and I
[16:10] think you know I I see this happen or
[16:12] that happen or certain things
[16:14] conversations come up and I've got good
[16:16] girls don't misunderstand me we got a
[16:18] good home that loves the Lord amen but
[16:20] we're not without the human side right
[16:23] and I think of all of that and I think
[16:25] God don't let the devil take him babies
[16:27] out there right and run them out into
[16:29] the world and things like that right but
[16:32] I also realize that as holy and as Godly
[16:34] as we can raise a family at the end of
[16:37] the day it's up to the Lord of where
[16:38] he's going to take them this way or that
[16:39] way all of our children including these
[16:42] kids all these young people sitting here
[16:44] amen all of them we all have a choice as
[16:47] adults we all have a choice mommies dads
[16:49] we all have a choice how we're going to
[16:51] serve the Lord or whether we're not
[16:53] going to serve the Lord would to God
[16:55] that every family in this message that
[16:56] follow brother bram's teachings and the
[16:58] things that was given in this last day I
[17:00] would to God that all the families would
[17:02] have the attitude of my house we will
[17:04] serve the Lord yes amen amen
[17:08] sure you see things happen but yet I
[17:10] think on the other side of it here come
[17:13] brother brandham from a drunkard home
[17:16] yes broken up every Wich
[17:18] away you know I imagine brother Braham
[17:20] had times in his life he' look back and
[17:22] said I would to God I would have had
[17:24] that Godly type home where we was raised
[17:27] reading the Bible and talking about
[17:28] Jesus at the dinner table right but you
[17:31] see predestination by the hand of God
[17:34] does not and I'm thankful for this does
[17:36] not grab us and put us in our position
[17:39] based upon the family atmosphere amen
[17:43] hallelujah the worst of the worst can
[17:44] become the best of the best and if we're
[17:47] not careful the best of the best can
[17:49] turn around become the worst of the
[17:50] worst and us not see it look at Judas
[17:52] Judas raised in the message we'd say
[17:54] Judas raised in a condition to where
[17:56] that he could do all things religious
[17:57] and every which way the Rich Young Ruler
[17:59] followed every commandment of God right
[18:01] to the letter right but you see in the
[18:04] heart of man no matter how well we've
[18:06] raised our families no matter how we've
[18:08] loved one another husbands and wives
[18:10] could have such a Godly relationship I
[18:12] I've heard people tell us all the time
[18:14] you know I wish we were like you and
[18:17] Sam I said well listen Samantha's one of
[18:19] the greatest women I've ever met in my
[18:21] entire life and we buddies her and I are
[18:24] just just Chums and I said that's my
[18:26] wing girl and I'm her Wing man amen amen
[18:30] and we we we like peas and carrots we
[18:32] stick together and we've always stuck
[18:34] together and fought together and cried
[18:36] together and laughed together and
[18:37] everything else and folks will say I
[18:39] wish I had a marriage like that and then
[18:41] I think to myself oh God all of the
[18:44] humanity of my own and all of her
[18:46] humanity and how we were raised as the
[18:48] babies of the family both of us stubborn
[18:50] and hard-headed always wanting our own
[18:52] ways and everything else it's a miracle
[18:55] in a way that we've even survived being
[18:57] as SPO old as we
[18:59] were but that's what I'm trying to tell
[19:01] you the grace of God Amen knows how to
[19:04] put things in its right place and its
[19:06] right position oh I don't mean that we
[19:07] should just throw caution to the wind
[19:09] and not serve the Lord and not raise our
[19:11] families right but I mean that there is
[19:13] a hope when you see flaws there is hope
[19:16] when you see errors there are there's
[19:19] hopes in our life are you with me
[19:20] there's hope laying there when things
[19:23] don't go the way that we think they
[19:24] should go God doesn't look at those
[19:26] things as being qualific ations of his
[19:29] mercy and his grace right we train our
[19:33] churches we train our people we train
[19:35] one another the Elder teaches the
[19:37] younger and so on so forth like that we
[19:40] do our very best to bring people into
[19:41] the right Spirit and the right attitude
[19:44] of Christianity but at the end of the
[19:46] day we can give them all the tools and
[19:48] all the abilities and tell them how to
[19:50] do things but God has to show mercy
[19:53] righten and anoint that which has been
[19:55] said amen as if he does an anointing
[19:58] bring it into your heart and you accept
[19:59] it freely that it's just laying there as
[20:02] a sounding brass and a tinkling symbol
[20:03] that's what Paul was talking about when
[20:05] he said I could have all of that I could
[20:06] be loaded up with all the tools and the
[20:08] goods and the understanding and the
[20:10] Mystery I could have been raised in a
[20:11] good home I could have come up in a good
[20:13] church could have had the best pastor
[20:15] had all of the best music in the world
[20:17] but that alone wasn't enough for me I
[20:19] needed the love of
[20:21] God hallelujah
[20:25] hallelujah I was raised in church
[20:28] raised here in brother Ram's name raised
[20:30] here in the name of Jesus Christ raised
[20:32] here in the Bible read and the message
[20:34] is played I come up here in all the
[20:37] Godly things as a boy
[20:39] myself but but for the grace of God I
[20:42] would have went to the world like
[20:43] everybody else would have went that's
[20:45] right and stayed in the world not just
[20:46] went there but stayed that's right amen
[20:49] no telling where I would have been had
[20:50] not God rescued me from the greatest
[20:53] rescue he could have rescued from me
[20:56] amen yes amen I said he rescued me from
[21:00] me yes that's the greatest rescue hell
[21:03] wasn't even a big a danger as I was the
[21:05] devil wasn't even a bigger threat as I
[21:07] was he rescued me from the greatest
[21:09] threat
[21:10] myself people live in the shadow of
[21:15] teaching and instruction from Ministry
[21:17] that will say you know the only thing
[21:20] you have to follow the message believe
[21:22] brother
[21:23] random believe on Jesus as your savior
[21:26] it's all good to say that and it's easy
[21:28] to make those statements right but if
[21:30] God doesn't Quicken it to you right and
[21:32] you can't receive that in your heart all
[21:35] you're doing is
[21:36] learning sir and never coming to the
[21:38] knowledge of the truth that's right how
[21:40] many friends do we have sitting in pews
[21:43] around the churches of this truth that
[21:45] are in that very same condition they sit
[21:48] around and hear all the great things of
[21:50] God even feel the spirit of God in
[21:51] Services time and time and time again
[21:53] and I love it when you come into
[21:55] anointed churches before your hand
[21:56] reaches the door knob you can feel the
[21:57] presence presence of God in the place I
[21:59] love being in atmospheres like that and
[22:02] I've seen many sit right there in that
[22:04] church and sit right there in those
[22:05] atmospheres like that and walk right out
[22:07] the door and it doesn't even affect them
[22:09] I used to wonder how could that be such
[22:11] a thing the prophet described it this
[22:13] way in Rising of the sun he said that
[22:14] when the sun rose all the sticks and the
[22:17] rocks and the dirt and all of that laid
[22:18] there and never even moved but that seed
[22:22] was able to catch on to what the light
[22:23] was bringing Hallelujah and there was an
[22:25] understanding created there one was was
[22:28] able to respond to the other and one was
[22:29] able to say Amen to the other and one
[22:31] was able to say yes Lord to the other
[22:33] Hallelujah and what did it produce It
[22:34] produced a new birth It produced the
[22:36] Holy Ghost It produced Christ in the
[22:38] human heart amen amen and what done that
[22:41] that little seed could have maybe looked
[22:42] at The Rock The Rock looked back at the
[22:44] seed what makes you so special the only
[22:46] thing he could say is how my Creator
[22:48] made me right yes me within myself I'm
[22:51] not special the only thing special about
[22:53] me is how my Creator made me and how he
[22:55] chose me amen amen not he that willth
[22:58] not he that runneth but God that shows
[23:00] Mercy that's right I want you to notice
[23:03] to find God's favor and to have the
[23:06] favor of God in our life we have to
[23:07] understand that God's favor doesn't come
[23:10] on conditions
[23:12] amen now I know some people will will
[23:15] will think in their mind well I get
[23:17] God's favor and then I lose God's favor
[23:19] that's not true once you obtain God's
[23:22] favor you always have his favor now that
[23:24] doesn't mean that at times he won't be
[23:26] angry with you right does it mean at
[23:29] times you won't be corrected right right
[23:31] that's right does it mean at times that
[23:33] he won't look down at you and say what
[23:36] in the world are you thinking boy right
[23:39] brother huh there might it might be
[23:42] times that God Almighty brother said it
[23:44] one time that God gets some mad at us he
[23:46] feels like kicking us sometimes right
[23:48] that's
[23:50] true Paul even said he was living in a
[23:53] place that he didn't frustrate the grace
[23:54] of God which tells me at some point he
[23:56] learned at some point he was frustrating
[23:59] the grace of God that may get frustrated
[24:02] with us but we never lose his favor
[24:06] amen now you understand that when the
[24:08] favor of God is placed on
[24:11] someone the idea that we have to
[24:13] understand about favor is the word favor
[24:15] is actually translated correctly saying
[24:18] grace yes 156 times you'll find favor
[24:22] mentioned in the New Testament and every
[24:24] time you read favor it means Grace yes
[24:27] amen and the grace of God and the favor
[24:29] of God goes like this that once the Lord
[24:32] has found favor in your life or you
[24:35] found favor with God I should say and
[24:37] he's put took his favor and he's placed
[24:39] it upon you that means god is allowing
[24:43] you to
[24:45] receive not only his
[24:48] best
[24:49] amen God's Not only allowing you to
[24:52] receive his heart amen his Blessing and
[24:55] all of that that comes with it
[24:58] but all of the worst that comes to
[25:00] Christianity is going to be right in
[25:01] there too right yes sir right yes sir
[25:04] you get God's worst and you get God's
[25:06] best right you say wait a minute now
[25:09] preacher God ain't God is worst hold on
[25:12] that ain't what brother Brenham said
[25:14] brother B said in why cist speak that
[25:15] when Faith looks at God's worst he
[25:19] esteems it better than all the devil
[25:20] could
[25:21] offer so there is a worst and a best
[25:24] that comes to Christianity none of us
[25:26] like trials and tribul ation right right
[25:29] and yet all of the worst that Humanity
[25:31] can throw into it and all of the things
[25:34] that happen in our lives once God has
[25:36] taken up favor with you you don't lose
[25:39] that because one day you're a bad boy or
[25:41] a bad girl or you get discouraged or you
[25:43] miss praying or you miss reading the
[25:44] Bible that day or you lost your temper
[25:47] on and on and on and on but the idea has
[25:50] been in order for me to be righteous and
[25:52] keep God's favor in my life I've got to
[25:54] walk this perfect sinful life and never
[25:56] make a mistake
[25:58] and yet that kind of life is just not
[26:01] humanly possible right right brother to
[26:05] be forgiven is a life of perfection yes
[26:08] amen that's what makes a person perfect
[26:10] is when they are forgiven of God when
[26:13] their sins are underneath the blood that
[26:14] brings them back to that perfect State
[26:17] and a person's got the right kind of
[26:18] feeling in their heart toward Christ
[26:20] they don't want to go out doing all
[26:21] kinds of things and wrong
[26:24] things cuz they've been changed amen as
[26:27] I said just ification makes a way for
[26:29] sanctification and sanctification cleans
[26:31] the heart up and puts a person in a
[26:33] condition to where they're ready to
[26:34] receive the Holy Ghost and then when
[26:36] they receive the Holy Ghost that's God's
[26:38] seal of approval that's his favor upon
[26:40] you to say I know that you'll make the
[26:42] journey and you can go right to the end
[26:43] of the journey and though the the the
[26:45] road may be rough though the the turns
[26:47] and the twists may be treacherous though
[26:49] there might be all kinds of things would
[26:51] befall you along the way I'm placing
[26:53] that seal upon your life cuz I know that
[26:55] you'll make it to the end of the journey
[26:57] amen hallelujah w beat anybody that
[27:00] tries to tamper with that seal right
[27:02] Hallelujah tries to work on your Holy
[27:04] Ghost and tell you you got to follow a
[27:06] bunch of Creeds or ideas of some man in
[27:08] order to get you right amen God will
[27:11] take exception to that but once we find
[27:13] the favor of God once his favor comes
[27:15] into our life the main thing in our our
[27:19] life would be to we would think in our
[27:22] mind to live in a manner where Lord I
[27:24] don't ever want to lose that but you
[27:26] can't right cuz God don't give and take
[27:28] away like that right
[27:31] amen amen I know that's hard to swallow
[27:34] but I'm going to let you work on it a
[27:36] little
[27:37] while because the idea of legalism is
[27:40] that if I can keep myself right on a
[27:42] daily basis well that's true we want to
[27:45] be right on a daily basis yes but
[27:47] there's just going to be times that
[27:49] we're just not able to cut the
[27:52] mustard hello somebody right there's
[27:55] just going to be days where we're going
[27:56] to fall short of the glory of God yes
[27:58] sir though you might try and try as you
[28:01] might you're going to fall short you're
[28:02] going to not be able to reach the goal
[28:04] that you wanted to reach for that day
[28:05] that's right there's going to be sick
[28:06] children around you there going to be
[28:07] troubled bosses and people at work with
[28:09] bad attitudes there's going to be all
[28:10] kinds of issues you're going to be
[28:12] unhealthy or some other things going to
[28:13] hit and there's going to be somewhere in
[28:15] your life that you're just not going to
[28:17] be able to tow the line like you want to
[28:19] that's right brother and what happens
[28:20] then do we fall out of favor with God
[28:23] absolutely not his favor is what places
[28:26] Us in the condition that while we're
[28:28] going through all of that he's standing
[28:30] right there making sure we come out on
[28:32] the other side amen I love that because
[28:36] he tells us Ephesians 4:30 Dre up the
[28:38] Seal of God for it will be there to the
[28:41] Redemption of your body good amen I'll
[28:43] never leave you never forsake you I'll
[28:45] be with you in the consummation the end
[28:46] of the world he'll always be with us yes
[28:49] and you say Amen he'll always be
[28:51] there notice the greatest thing in the
[28:53] world is to find favor with Goden and if
[28:56] I've got fav faor with God I can serve
[28:58] his people correctly yes that's true
[29:01] amen if I've got favor with God he'll
[29:03] give gifts into my life right but
[29:06] remember don't seek for the gifts seek
[29:08] for The Giver that's right follow after
[29:10] him follow on to know the Lord and all
[29:13] these things shall be added unto you
[29:15] seek ye first the kingdom of God and
[29:17] then all of this will be added unto you
[29:19] amen hallelujah makes sense when you go
[29:21] to thinking about how that if he is the
[29:23] giver gifts come with him right that's
[29:26] right never understood how people around
[29:28] the truth could say well we've got the
[29:30] giver got the giver got the giver you
[29:31] never see a gift anywhere right amen
[29:34] evidently he's got him on lay away
[29:36] somewhere or
[29:40] another right but if he's got
[29:42] gifts he's looking for someone that he
[29:45] can trust amen right not only with
[29:48] divine power Divine wisdom yes Divine
[29:51] ability he's looking for someone that is
[29:54] willing to Humble themsel to whatever
[29:57] God wants them to do they're willing to
[29:58] do it yes amen now turn me to Psalm 5:12
[30:04] let me let me read you a couple things
[30:05] here on the favor of God then we're
[30:07] going to jump into humility and if that
[30:09] clock will quit preaching so fast I may
[30:11] get to the end of this and start
[30:12] something new tonight but we we we'll
[30:14] see that clock is a faster preacher than
[30:16] I am amen I promise that Psalm
[30:21] 5:12 now I love this statement right
[30:25] here he says in Victory said now
[30:27] remember God has counted you worthy when
[30:29] you have a test he said I don't fail
[30:31] this when you have a trial or a test it
[30:33] shows the grace of God has found or you
[30:36] have found favor with God and God
[30:38] believes that you'll stand the test amen
[30:41] this is in Victor 63 in April 63 he said
[30:43] that God counts you worthy when you have
[30:45] a
[30:46] test you found favor with God job an
[30:51] upright man isth evil Satan said I'd get
[30:55] a hold of him you'd take your hand off
[30:56] him is said all right but don't you
[30:58] touch his life amen now why'd God do
[31:01] that CU he hated job got aggravated at
[31:05] Job thought he would put him through a
[31:06] little hard time give job a little
[31:08] Timeout on
[31:10] Earth or a little spanking on Earth it
[31:13] wasn't the idea of it no sir no sir not
[31:16] at all job had found favor with God Amen
[31:19] and God believed that he was able to
[31:21] stand the test but you know there's
[31:24] something that comes with
[31:25] trials sometimes
[31:27] when you start going through hard things
[31:29] like that if you're not careful you'll
[31:31] start working on that Human Side you get
[31:33] aggravated you get
[31:35] frustrated and just like job you come to
[31:38] the spot where you think oh well you
[31:40] know I I I I've done a pretty good job
[31:42] of dealing with all these problems and
[31:44] you know and i' I've got issues but I'm
[31:47] tough I can handle it you better be
[31:49] careful because it'll be about that time
[31:50] you'll hear a whirlwind speak out and
[31:52] say stand on your feet and talk like a
[31:54] man that's right right where was you
[31:56] when I laid the foundations of the world
[31:59] yes
[32:00] sir now watch him when it comes to Psalm
[32:03] 5:12 for thou Lord will bless the
[32:07] righteous with
[32:10] favor thou Compass him as with a shield
[32:16] Hallelujah so brother Jesse in other
[32:20] words if I am righteous not because of
[32:23] me now but because his son's blood has
[32:26] covered me amen
[32:27] and made me righteous isn't that a
[32:29] beautiful
[32:30] quotation he's taken his son's blood
[32:32] brother said and cover me if I'm covered
[32:35] in the righteousness of Jesus
[32:40] Christ when Satan comes to
[32:42] me or some evil thing comes toward me or
[32:47] even if I decide I think I'm going to
[32:49] step a little further than what I'm
[32:50] permitted to step right God's favor acts
[32:54] as a
[32:55] shield amen
[32:57] amen hallelujah am that not only keeps
[33:00] the devil out but keeps me inside
[33:03] [Music]
[33:06] amen
[33:08] glory his shield his favor his grace is
[33:13] what keeps you from going farther than
[33:15] what you would go
[33:18] yourself amen how many times have you as
[33:21] a child of God decided I'm done I quit
[33:24] it's over with all of a sudden you just
[33:25] feel like you're you're you're
[33:29] Bo I've had enough of the
[33:33] church his
[33:36] shield puts it around you and he
[33:38] protects you and keeps You There He
[33:39] blesses the righteous with favor
[33:41] compasses him with that favor as a
[33:45] shield favor which is grace of God Amen
[33:48] wonder how many times the devil has
[33:50] sought to take you out wonder how many
[33:52] times evil spirits have went to God and
[33:54] said if you just take your hand away
[33:56] I'll deal with that thing I I I'll work
[33:59] on them I I'll attack them with this and
[34:01] that and the other and God say wo
[34:02] they're not ready yet you just stay your
[34:05] hand and hold your peace until the hour
[34:07] arrived and then all of a sudden you
[34:08] come to that place in Christ where you
[34:10] can handle that battle and the next
[34:11] thing you know here it comes right you
[34:13] get discouraged you get upset you get
[34:15] worn out you feel like uh given up you
[34:17] go through all those human emotions and
[34:19] all those range of emotions and you do
[34:21] everything you can to regulate those
[34:23] feelings inside of you but let's be
[34:26] honest there's times that our mind and
[34:28] our spirit just can't keep up right
[34:30] stuff's moving so quick we can't keep up
[34:32] with it that's right and all of a sudden
[34:34] we come to that spot I think I'll just
[34:36] tell him I'll quit and here comes that
[34:39] Shield though he slay me yet I'll trust
[34:43] him it's a
[34:45] protection it's not punishment right
[34:48] Psalm
[34:49] 30:5 and we're talking about the favor
[34:51] of the Lord for just a little bit and
[34:52] I'm going to move on to humility God
[34:53] helping
[34:55] me Psalm chap
[34:58] 30:5 now now listen to these words these
[35:00] are important all the Bible's important
[35:02] but in terms of the thought today this
[35:04] is important to catch yes amen for his
[35:08] what anger for his anger now for those
[35:11] who don't think God gets angry right
[35:13] there you
[35:13] go oh he's a good god he's a just God
[35:16] he's a loving God he's all of that but
[35:18] sometimes he gets mad right where do you
[35:20] think you get it from right that's right
[35:23] uhhuh that's why the Bible said be angry
[35:24] and sin
[35:25] not there is a righteous anger that
[35:28] comes there is a a human response that
[35:30] all comes from God friends anger is the
[35:33] feeling according to the experts which I
[35:36] call them Eggheads not experts but
[35:38] anyways according to these people out
[35:40] here that think they're so
[35:42] smart compared to God ain't got a brain
[35:44] at all right they'll tell us that anger
[35:47] is the deep-seated feeling in the heart
[35:49] of wanting to see something change it's
[35:51] not
[35:53] changing you want it so badly that you
[35:55] get frustrated and that's what what
[35:56] triggers this emotion called anger is
[35:59] wanting to see change in it not
[36:01] happening though you try though you
[36:03] force it though you try to make it
[36:05] happen it just doesn't happen that's
[36:06] what anger is and it's all right to feel
[36:09] frustrated when you see something not
[36:11] going the way that it should you want it
[36:12] to go another way it's not it's okay to
[36:14] feel frustrated but just remember
[36:17] there's a line that you can't cross when
[36:18] you're
[36:19] angry cuz you will enter right into sin
[36:21] the Bible said be angry and sin not
[36:23] you'll enter right into a condition of
[36:25] unbelief and everything that goes with
[36:27] that yes so there is a
[36:30] range there is a degree that lay within
[36:34] anger now listen to
[36:36] me that you go so far and then you stop
[36:40] hallelujah amen and the Bible said his
[36:44] anger endureth but for a moment amen
[36:48] amen in other words God may get angry at
[36:51] us but he never crosses the line amen
[36:55] hallelujah he never crosses to that
[36:57] place to where I'm done with you you're
[36:59] going to cross the line that's it I'm
[37:00] done with you his anger endures but for
[37:03] a
[37:04] moment and in his favor is life his
[37:08] favor is what he puts Upon Our Lives and
[37:11] he sees us as being a certain type of
[37:14] people he knows that we're the right
[37:15] kind of kids and the right kind of
[37:17] children and he looks at us and sees us
[37:19] doing things or believing or acting or
[37:20] behaving in some way and God gets angry
[37:23] at us and say what is the matter with
[37:24] those
[37:25] kids
[37:27] I'm a Daddy too I love my young
[37:30] ons and and and I I I do anything for
[37:34] those girls within reason of course but
[37:35] I'd do anything for them if it was
[37:38] possible I'd be like the king with
[37:40] Esther I'd give up to half of the
[37:42] Kingdom if I thought they wouldn't turn
[37:43] around and spend it on shoes and
[37:47] purses and I I I love those
[37:50] onions but sometimes I get angry with
[37:52] them when I know that I've told them and
[37:53] taught them so do it this way and they
[37:56] don't do it I get angry with them
[37:58] sometimes I look down at him and I'll
[38:00] say girl I don't know how in the world
[38:03] was your brain working when you did such
[38:05] a thing what was you thinking when such
[38:08] and such happened and I make get so mad
[38:11] at I feel like shaking the tree out of
[38:14] them every leave just going on every way
[38:16] just shaking them like an old
[38:19] tree but they're my girls they're my
[38:22] blood amen my anger only endures for a
[38:25] moment
[38:27] and then I got to remember they're
[38:29] mine and if I remain angry at them I
[38:32] can't I can't help them progress if I
[38:34] remain angry at him I can't teach him to
[38:36] do better if I remain angry at him I
[38:38] can't encourage him to take the next
[38:40] steps right so the anger of God only
[38:42] endures for a moment CU after he
[38:45] realizes oh we've done this or done that
[38:47] or said this or said that his anger only
[38:48] endures long enough and then he comes
[38:50] back to himself so to speak and says but
[38:52] that's my boy that's my girl I got to go
[38:55] back remember his Mercy is knew every
[38:56] single morning amen so God may get mad
[39:00] but he don't get mad for Keeps
[39:02] hallelujah amen
[39:05] amen Joy look at this Joy comes in the
[39:10] morning hallelujah amen as God knows
[39:13] yeah okay all right speed bumping the
[39:15] road but tomorrow's a new
[39:18] day now look at this in Psalm chapter
[39:20] 30: 7 I love this statement he said
[39:24] Lord by thy favor
[39:27] thou Hast made my Mountain to stand
[39:29] strong thou didst hide thy face and I
[39:31] was troubled but thou has made my
[39:33] Mountain to stand strong now a mountain
[39:35] in the Bible symbolizes many different
[39:37] things one is
[39:40] inspiration we'll talk about that in a
[39:42] moment and if I don't get to it this
[39:43] morning I'll try to bring it in this
[39:44] evening this
[39:47] afternoon it'll bring inspiration to the
[39:49] child of God it is also the universal
[39:52] symbol of being near to
[39:54] God but a m in the Bible also symbolizes
[39:58] a place of a new
[40:00] beginning CU as a person walks through
[40:03] the
[40:04] valley David said it ye though I walk
[40:06] through the valley the shadow of death
[40:07] I'll fear no evil for thou art with me
[40:10] as we walk through the valley we come
[40:11] through that Valley and what do we see
[40:14] but the beginning of Another Mountain so
[40:17] a mountain represents a new
[40:20] beginning so not only does the favor of
[40:22] God Compass us like a shield protects us
[40:26] not only does God's favor bring joy
[40:31] after anger and
[40:33] defeat but he also offers to us his
[40:35] favor offers to us a new beginning yes
[40:38] amen
[40:40] amen in other
[40:42] words have you ever heard somebody say
[40:45] I've gone too far I can't go back you
[40:47] ever heard that messed up too bad and
[40:50] never be fixed maybe they're drawing
[40:52] something other and they did some kind
[40:53] of a mistake on the thing and and and oh
[40:56] ruined it it'll never be better well if
[40:57] their Bob what's his name with the big
[40:59] curly hair they just take it and turn it
[41:00] into seagulls or some other kind of
[41:02] thing why cuz he learned that you know
[41:05] every mistake is actually maybe a a
[41:07] great inspir inspired piece of art
[41:09] hiding in that
[41:11] mistake right same thing that God does
[41:14] with us though it looks like the failure
[41:17] is great he always offers us a new
[41:20] beginning that's what his favor does
[41:22] Amen but now think of it contris
[41:24] remember I preached to you last time
[41:25] about Judas and the nature of Judas and
[41:27] how he was remember when Judas come to
[41:29] that place of no return and that spot to
[41:31] where he was going to completely turn
[41:33] down Christ and Satan was going to enter
[41:35] into him there was no new beginning for
[41:38] Judas but Peter who was not only got mad
[41:42] and swore and denied and big tough guy
[41:46] right Jesus walking on the water he
[41:48] jumped out from say hey Lord I'll walk
[41:49] out
[41:51] there always the big mouth of the
[41:55] group and and yet whenever he failed and
[41:57] went out there and wept bitterly 10 days
[41:59] later Jesus was standing before him and
[42:01] said now go on up to Jerusalem and go
[42:03] ter up there until you're endued from
[42:05] power on high why the favor of God
[42:08] always gives you a new beginning
[42:11] amen should have rendered a bigger amen
[42:13] and what it God Amen goly right God
[42:16] always offers us a new start and a fresh
[42:20] beginning you've heard me say it before
[42:22] let me say it again yesterday ended last
[42:25] night yesterday is gone sweet Jesus help
[42:29] me one day at a time am now listen to
[42:34] this in uh Luke 1:30 the angel of the
[42:37] Lord said unto
[42:39] Mary thou Hast found favor with
[42:43] God
[42:44] Amen what did Mary
[42:48] do what' she
[42:51] do what what was different about her
[42:54] than the other 700 95,000 Marys in the
[42:59] world was she the only virgin in the
[43:02] world the only young girl in the world
[43:05] no what was different about her was
[43:09] quite simply the fact that God had chose
[43:11] her to be the incubator it wasn't
[43:14] anything she done right no way that she
[43:16] acted no way that she behaved right but
[43:19] God chose her to be the incubator of the
[43:22] created body of God himself
[43:25] amen
[43:26] well
[43:27] Mary do they feed you better than the
[43:29] rest of
[43:30] them do you have better quarters than
[43:32] the rest of them what makes that that
[43:34] slave out there so much different he
[43:35] said that boy out there knows he's a
[43:37] King's son and he behaves like a King's
[43:40] son that's the way she was she was God's
[43:43] daughter and God was going to choose her
[43:44] to be that way it was nothing within her
[43:47] that she done right God by his grace
[43:49] said that's the one that I'm going to
[43:51] choose
[43:53] amen what kind of favor did Mary have
[43:55] with God think about it they tried to
[43:58] kill Jesus all the days that they had a
[44:00] chance to kill
[44:03] him lied on her and told all kinds of
[44:05] stories and made it up that she had some
[44:07] kind of a secret relationship with a
[44:09] Roman soldier was trying to covered up
[44:11] some spiritual thing that's history now
[44:13] right it's authentic
[44:16] history tried to put all kinds of things
[44:19] together to make it sound like something
[44:21] that it really
[44:23] wasn't and yet while Jesus was hang on
[44:26] the cross 33 and 1/2 years later he said
[44:29] behold thy
[44:31] mother why' he tell him that she had
[44:34] favor right to the very end amen amen
[44:37] not only did she have favor of God to
[44:39] Bear the very creative body of of Jesus
[44:45] Christ but it was so strange to her now
[44:47] listen close don't miss this part it was
[44:51] so strange to her that when the angel
[44:54] brother come to her and said you found
[44:56] favor she jumped back and said wait a
[44:57] minute what kind of salutation is
[44:59] [Laughter]
[45:01] this in her mind she couldn't understand
[45:05] why anybody would say such words to her
[45:08] does anybody know what I'm talking about
[45:10] you come to Christ in such a way you
[45:12] think why me Lord out of all of the
[45:13] people in the world did you choose to
[45:15] put your grace and mercy in why me out
[45:18] of all of the peoples of the world there
[45:20] were much better that you could have
[45:21] pulled out of the sheep coat but you
[45:23] chose me am Hallelujah am she kind of
[45:27] jumped back and said she wondered the
[45:29] Bible said she wondered what kind of
[45:30] salutation is
[45:32] this it's about the way some of yall are
[45:34] in church when God goes to telling
[45:35] loving on you telling you how great you
[45:37] are some of you'll start putting your
[45:38] head down and looking around and this
[45:40] way and that I've seen people get
[45:41] nervous because it's hard for us as
[45:43] humans to accept that God feels that way
[45:45] about
[45:46] us but he does am sir right it's not
[45:49] what you done it's what he done amen
[45:52] it's not our own righteousness but it's
[45:54] his righteousness now watch this
[45:56] uh let's pick up
[45:58] um oh there's so many places I could go
[46:01] let's pick up Romans chap 10:3 for just
[46:03] a moment and then let's see and maybe I
[46:05] can maybe I can start over here on this
[46:08] about humility I got a little time here
[46:11] I can bring it
[46:13] in I sing to you for 20 minutes so
[46:16] technically you got to go backwards 20
[46:17] minutes for the preaching
[46:19] time
[46:21] sir amen Romans 10 and verse three for
[46:25] they be being ignorant of God's
[46:27] righteousness and going about to
[46:29] establish their own
[46:32] righteousness if that ain't what done
[46:34] around us what
[46:35] is moms will do it dads will do it right
[46:38] preachers will do it deacons will do it
[46:40] trustees will do it any kind of leader
[46:42] any kind of person that has the ability
[46:44] to interpret what they think Holiness
[46:46] looks like they'll do it almost every
[46:50] time my girls and I just for the for the
[46:53] fun of it we're getting ready to go back
[46:54] through brother Jesse's book on
[46:56] Holiness and we're going to go piece by
[46:58] piece and talk about a few
[47:00] things lately we had the question come
[47:03] up about what does hair and dress and
[47:05] these things mean and I made a statement
[47:07] brother Jesse like this I said hair as
[47:09] far as hair goes what does God care
[47:11] about hair hair is just as
[47:13] much uh calcium and potes like like any
[47:16] other part of our body but it's not the
[47:19] hair itself but it's the symbol of
[47:21] Holiness that it represents amen right
[47:24] what is the dress all about they had
[47:26] robes in one day they had other outfits
[47:28] and you hear girls in this day and age
[47:30] that are trying to find a reason not
[47:31] dress with the dresses and things like
[47:33] that they well that ain't the way they
[47:34] dressed back then when they were talking
[47:36] that way but it's a symbol of Holiness
[47:39] in this day and age amen there're
[47:41] symbols like baptism and communion and
[47:43] foot washing they're symbols of what
[47:45] they represent to us amen they represent
[47:48] a Godly life and a holy lifej you take a
[47:51] woman for example that's got cancer and
[47:53] she's got brain cancer and they got to
[47:54] work on her they may have to shave her
[47:57] head all the way in order to do that
[47:59] well then you know some critic will run
[48:00] over and say well you ain't even got
[48:02] long hair but in God's eyes because her
[48:04] heart is right and she wants to be holy
[48:06] before the Lord and she's trying to be
[48:08] as obedient as she knows how God don't
[48:10] look at the links and all those kind of
[48:11] things like that he looks at the
[48:13] attitude and the demonstration of how
[48:15] she's adhering to the word of God and
[48:17] it's a symbol of Holiness to almighty
[48:19] God right as far as that goes what is a
[48:22] hat or breaches or anything else what
[48:25] was walking behind That Old Testament
[48:26] what did uh what did one hat have any
[48:28] difference in another hat it was a
[48:31] symbol of Holiness before God they
[48:33] represented that they were walking in a
[48:35] way that they felt was pleasing to the
[48:37] Lord to the best of their ability yes
[48:39] sir that's why they didn't eat pork
[48:40] that's why they didn't combine their
[48:42] clothes with other types of synthetics
[48:43] and whatever else may have been
[48:45] available in that day course wasn't
[48:46] synthetics but you get my
[48:49] meaning amen but some man-made handmade
[48:52] thing you know that wasn't pleasing to
[48:54] the Lord some denominational Creed you
[48:55] put in there right good right they weren
[48:58] allowed to mix it what was it but
[49:00] symbols of Holiness and a standard
[49:02] before
[49:03] God but righteousness being established
[49:07] by
[49:08] man will always produce the same vomit
[49:12] filthy
[49:13] rags cage of foul unclean Birds foul
[49:18] birds will produce that much as it would
[49:21] The Bootlegger the prostitute or the
[49:24] whoever whoever whoever on the street
[49:26] right cuzz God does not look at
[49:28] self-made Holiness as being a righteous
[49:30] thing that's right right sure we had a
[49:34] young lady some years ago that started
[49:36] backsliding and she was a party girl in
[49:39] the world and ran with everything in the
[49:40] world and done with whoever was out
[49:42] there and and and just you name it she
[49:45] did it and put a list together of all
[49:47] the sin and the wrong a person could
[49:49] commit and put a title her name is right
[49:51] at the top of the list she wanted to be
[49:53] the first in line to do all of the bad
[49:55] things a person could do until she met
[49:57] the Lord and tried to get saved and
[49:58] tried to live right well then she
[49:59] started
[50:00] backsliding and I told this young woman
[50:02] I said the problem I'm seeing is that
[50:05] you're trying to live the same exact
[50:06] life that you lived out there but you're
[50:07] doing it this time with a dress
[50:09] on and in the eyes of God friends we
[50:13] cannot produce a
[50:15] Holiness like that Holiness has to be
[50:18] something produced inside the Heart by
[50:21] the Holy Ghost holy dressing comes from
[50:23] a holy attitude if it's correct
[50:26] right and from a holy Revelation amen I
[50:29] I like was it you Christen or one of you
[50:31] girls whenever you got that that bunch
[50:33] and they said oh some man made you do
[50:36] this and some man and somebody spoke up
[50:38] out of the little group up here you know
[50:40] and said no man taught me to do this and
[50:42] no man told me to do them things right
[50:45] what is it that's God placing true
[50:48] Holiness inside a heart hallelujah
[50:50] hallelujah I want to tell you something
[50:52] friends that's what we're missing around
[50:53] our truth the kind of attitude that came
[50:57] by God's own hand we have followed man
[50:59] and followed their ideas and followed
[51:01] their Creeds and followed their
[51:02] leadership long enough away with Men's
[51:06] Leadership back to the leadership of the
[51:08] Holy Ghost hlj amen they that are led by
[51:12] the spirit of God they are the sons and
[51:13] daughters of God hallelujah
[51:17] amen and he said they have not submitted
[51:19] them themselves under the righteousness
[51:21] of God this word Paul uses is a
[51:23] condition that is acceptable to
[51:26] God a lot of people they get tripped up
[51:29] on things let me just give you a couple
[51:31] examples we'll move on in Oklahoma many
[51:33] years ago there's a sister she'd never
[51:35] cut her hair out want she come into the
[51:37] truth and she got her hair accidentally
[51:40] rolled up into the seat Bel they tried
[51:42] every way in the world even tried to
[51:43] take the seat belt apart to get her hair
[51:45] loose and she said one of the most
[51:47] heartbreaking days of my life is when
[51:48] they had to take P of scissors and cut
[51:50] that thing out like
[51:51] that and there's a fellow standing by
[51:53] and say ahuh jez Bel
[51:56] Jezebel but I said it's a symbol of
[51:59] Holiness God knows what her heart was
[52:01] and knows what it represented and knows
[52:03] what the trouble was How could a God who
[52:06] is Holy and just and understandable hold
[52:09] something like that against a dear
[52:10] sister that was heartbroken over having
[52:13] to go in such a route right didn't seem
[52:16] as though any other Alternatives and one
[52:17] fell spoke up and said well I to cut the
[52:19] seat Bel first to stay right with God I
[52:21] said you're an idiot that's your
[52:23] problem that's right idiotic stupid and
[52:27] foolish selfmade Holiness is what that
[52:30] is right laying upon people burdens that
[52:33] they themsel would never lift up right
[52:35] it's a phical attitude that's right our
[52:37] God ain't that kind of God people
[52:39] hallelujah he don't judge us for the
[52:41] things that we stumble into come on
[52:44] somebody preach to me a little while he
[52:45] don't judge us and throw us in hell for
[52:47] things that we cannot help
[52:51] right holds our
[52:53] standard even when we can always keep it
[52:56] he holds our standard he keeps our
[52:59] mountains strong Hallelujah yes and he
[53:02] Shields us from ever going further than
[53:04] that hallelujah amen amen and Hallelujah
[53:08] amen amen I think of the lady in Alaska
[53:10] that perig green told the story
[53:12] about brother B met her somewhere
[53:15] outside the outreaches of where they
[53:16] were going to the meeting she's going to
[53:17] guide him back in and there she's on
[53:19] that horse in a pair of britches like
[53:20] that and Perry said I was waiting any
[53:22] moment for brother randam to lay it on
[53:24] her he said said with that discernment
[53:26] brother Ram turned around after a bit
[53:27] and said Perry look around here at the
[53:29] conditions in this place the only way
[53:31] she could have been decent was to have a
[53:34] pair of them riding things on like that
[53:36] said she's trying to keep from freezing
[53:37] to death said she's not doing it to be a
[53:39] sinner she's doing it because the
[53:41] conditions are putting her in a place
[53:42] like that I know a lot of people would
[53:44] throw her in hell and condemn her over
[53:46] that very same thing but let me try to
[53:47] tell you something God don't look at
[53:51] selfmade righteousness and Holiness
[53:54] that's right am
[53:56] yes maybe that was her decision at the
[53:58] moment maybe she felt bad about it later
[54:00] maybe she didn't but in the eyes of God
[54:04] he's not going to put a lightning bolt
[54:06] right smacking our forehead every time
[54:07] we do something that that people think
[54:09] ain't just exactly that way right
[54:12] getting a quiet Church on me but I'm
[54:13] telling you the truth anyhow self Bay
[54:16] righteousness will never take us to the
[54:18] throne of God that's
[54:20] right circumstances sometimes will
[54:23] dictate that things have to happen in a
[54:25] certain manner or something like that
[54:27] these are attributes of life that we
[54:29] can't always help we got to roll with
[54:32] the punches to the best of our ability
[54:33] and do we always make the right choices
[54:35] no but neither is it better to kick
[54:38] oursel in the head every single day
[54:40] because we're caught in a situation that
[54:42] we don't know what the answer out is
[54:44] right right the best way is to throw
[54:46] yourself into the mercy of God and say
[54:48] Lord help me figure out the appropriate
[54:50] way to approach this amen sure and I
[54:53] don't agree with a woman wearing pants
[54:54] either but if I was up there in the
[54:55] freezing cold of Alaska 25 below
[54:58] Fahrenheit I might put on a Prayer
[54:59] Brides too if I was
[55:00] her I don't
[55:03] know we don't endorse things like that
[55:05] in the normal that's right but not all
[55:08] things are expedient friends right
[55:11] sometimes things will come into a
[55:13] situation how do you think it is with a
[55:16] woman who has living with a sinner
[55:18] husband the Bible said if they're
[55:19] contented to live together could you
[55:21] imagine what a yo-yo and a seesaw that
[55:24] is
[55:25] living with a man that you got a desire
[55:27] to serve God and want to be the right
[55:28] kind of woman and everything else and
[55:30] he's nothing but a filthy hearted human
[55:32] being got his mind on football and
[55:35] sports and everything all day long never
[55:36] talks about God maybe cusses out of both
[55:39] sides of his mouth and there she is in a
[55:40] corner praying and reading her
[55:42] Bible he might make fun of her and put
[55:45] her down and the least little mistake
[55:46] bothers her because of the Holy Ghost
[55:48] and he could care less if he was to
[55:49] blaspheme God tonight not all things
[55:52] were expedient but selfmade Holiness
[55:55] will never bring us into a place that's
[55:57] why brother R when he was talking about
[55:59] those situations it used to be a
[56:00] teaching many years ago that those women
[56:02] like that would keep their love and
[56:04] their affection from their
[56:05] husbands and brother Ram advised him in
[56:08] the cood he said don't do that that's
[56:10] right show them love that's your husband
[56:12] show him love and grace and mercy amen
[56:15] what I'm trying to say to you is
[56:16] self-made Holiness will never get us
[56:18] there I told you just a few examples I
[56:21] know you'll tighten up on it because
[56:22] it's easier to say am man to the other
[56:23] kind of preaching that it is this kind
[56:25] of stuff but this is where we're living
[56:27] at
[56:28] church that's right I'll just say it
[56:31] this way our young people are having to
[56:33] make decisions every day I'll say it
[56:35] that way they're confronted with
[56:37] situations every day from Social Media
[56:40] stuff to technological things out there
[56:42] to educational choices to uh you know
[56:45] everything else out there in the world
[56:46] they're confronted with all kinds of
[56:48] things that you and me US middle-aged
[56:51] people we don't even know what these
[56:54] kids are going through in this day and
[56:55] age right right it took us 4 days back
[56:58] in my time to get gossip to come back
[57:00] around the Grapevine they can get it all
[57:02] around the school to 5,000 people in a
[57:04] matter of a post that's
[57:06] right the age has pushed the
[57:09] envelope pushed the envelope into the
[57:11] place where now it's almost
[57:15] impossible to even have good sanity in a
[57:17] public school system right I I don't
[57:20] mean every school like that but I mean
[57:22] on the whole right with without the Holy
[57:25] Ghost our children walk right into the
[57:27] gates of hell every single day our
[57:29] teachers walk right smack into the gates
[57:31] of hell every single day it takes God to
[57:34] lead him right in the middle of those
[57:35] things amen amen and
[57:40] sometimes you have to overlook one thing
[57:42] to be able to get to
[57:44] another in a list of problems you have
[57:47] to try to figure out which one is the
[57:48] best to solve first
[57:51] right and everybody's got
[57:53] problems that ain't solved just yet well
[57:57] then how do I get God's favor to help me
[57:59] get there I got to stop focusing on
[58:01] every little detail and constantly
[58:02] trying to be pleasing to God and
[58:04] constantly am I am I am I right Lord I
[58:07] mean that's okay to have that that
[58:08] feeling wanting to be right with the
[58:10] Lord all the time but some people will
[58:12] drive themselves crazy with it never
[58:15] have no peace of God wondering if
[58:18] they've made a mistake it he's going to
[58:19] throw them away that's what I'm trying
[58:21] to preach to you this morning the favor
[58:22] of God doesn't leave you amen no matter
[58:25] what valleys you may be walking through
[58:28] Hallelujah his grace is always there
[58:30] even he said to Paul about his eyes he
[58:32] said don't worry my grace is there amen
[58:34] amen
[58:36] good I like
[58:38] that notice this in Romans chapter 5
[58:41] verse 10 now going back from the 10th
[58:44] chapter the fifth chapter 10 and 11 I
[58:46] ain't going to get to humility I'll have
[58:47] to catch it this afternoon time's gone
[58:49] amen Romans 5: 10 and
[58:52] 11 I'm not trying to rush it I was just
[58:54] hoping to get it in that's right all
[58:57] right for if when we were enemies we
[58:59] were reconciled to God by the death of
[59:00] his son much more being reconciled we
[59:03] shall be saved by his life and not only
[59:06] so but we also joy in God through our
[59:09] Lord Jesus Christ by whom we have now
[59:12] received the atonement at one meant
[59:16] separate the word a little bit at one
[59:19] amen that's what atonement means to make
[59:21] us at one with God hallelujah when Paul
[59:24] uses this word in the Greek listen what
[59:26] this means atonement in the Greek means
[59:29] the restoration of the favor of God Amen
[59:33] at one time I was an enemy at one time I
[59:35] was an outcast at one time I was a far
[59:38] off but his grace and the baptism of the
[59:41] Holy Ghost and his mercy and Calvary and
[59:44] the resurrection has now restored his
[59:46] favor back to me amen and back to you as
[59:51] Sons and Daughters he's give us his
[59:52] favor back amen he couldn't give it to
[59:55] us when we wern't saved as God can't put
[59:57] his favor and his approval upon our life
[1:00:00] as being as we were Sinners born in sin
[1:00:03] and S my mother conceived me and I was
[1:00:05] shape in iniquity came to the world
[1:00:07] speaking lies right but then when I went
[1:00:09] through justification sanctification and
[1:00:11] then the glass was set aside for service
[1:00:13] and he poured the buttermilk
[1:00:16] in
[1:00:17] Hallelujah that hour arrived Glory I not
[1:00:21] only received his holy ghost but his
[1:00:23] favor came restoring
[1:00:27] don't forget friends we are in a
[1:00:28] restoration
[1:00:30] message behold I send you Elijah the
[1:00:33] prophet to do what restore us back
[1:00:36] amen amen hallelujah and that's what God
[1:00:39] done for me and you yes amen so how do I
[1:00:42] get his favor how do I get
[1:00:46] it I've got to let him put his
[1:00:49] righteousness in me amen yeah that's one
[1:00:52] right I got to let him be the shield of
[1:00:54] my life amen and when he's angry with me
[1:00:58] I got to remember it only goes for a
[1:01:00] moment amen when I go through trials as
[1:01:03] he's got confidence and I found favor
[1:01:05] with him he trusts me and believes I can
[1:01:06] make it through it and then finally he's
[1:01:08] going to make my Mountain to stand
[1:01:09] strong amen every day and every way and
[1:01:13] every situation every circumstance he's
[1:01:15] going to give me a new beginning Amen in
[1:01:18] everything that I
[1:01:20] do and then the final element of the
[1:01:22] whole thing is what will talk about this
[1:01:25] afternoon God willing restoration of his
[1:01:28] favor also brings humility cuz listen
[1:01:30] the first thing God does when he saves
[1:01:33] you is give you humility amen amen true

[1:14:09] favor my enemies have not triumphed over
[1:14:11] me yes that's the reason I don't fall

[1:14:46] Wednesday Perfection is forgiveness now
[1:14:49] I said it in a little different
[1:14:51] way remember I I said how the the Kings
[1:14:54] would throw like Hezekiah would say Lord
[1:14:56] I've served you with a perfect heart how
[1:14:58] could he do that how was he perfect
[1:15:00] through the blood through the sacrifice
[1:15:03] and I said you can say the same thing
[1:15:06] I've served you with a perfect heart
[1:15:07] because I've confessed my
[1:15:09] sins that's
[1:15:12] beautiful Perfection is
[1:15:14] [Music]
[1:15:18] forgiveness does that resonate with
[1:15:20] anybody my
[1:15:21] God beautiful
[1:15:24] beautiful that's why I said you can
[1:15:26] throw yourself to the wall you some
[1:15:28] awful happen say God I've served you
[1:15:30] with a perfect
[1:15:32] heart I've been baptized I've kept the
[1:15:35] symbols I love that thought what a good
[1:15:37] thought the communion we took a couple
