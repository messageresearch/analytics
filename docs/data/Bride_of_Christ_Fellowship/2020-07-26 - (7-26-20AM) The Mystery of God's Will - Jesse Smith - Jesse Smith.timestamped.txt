[40:01] and then the mystery of iniquity i still

[40:58] praying for him he sent me the memory
[40:59] verse for august so
[41:01] next sunday we'll read a memory verse
[41:03] for our brother
[41:06] okay so everything's blurry now so if
[41:07] you see me really leaning in now that's
[41:09] why
[41:10] okay so uh we kind of looked at this
[41:12] subject when we looked at the
[41:14] uh the purpose series how many remember
[41:15] that i was i kind of got inspired i read
[41:17] the book uh the purpose driven life by
[41:19] rick
[41:20] warren it's a fantastic book if you
[41:21] haven't read it i would encourage you to
[41:23] read it if you don't have nothing else
[41:24] to read
[41:26] it's a 40 chapter book i think it's 42
[41:28] chapters now
[41:29] it's abuse a beautiful scripture reed he
[41:32] gives lots of stories
[41:33] there's only two mistakes he believes in
[41:35] the trinity so i found two mistakes in
[41:36] there
[41:37] but amen he said god was not alone
[41:39] because he had two other people to
[41:40] fellowship with
[41:42] oh my but if that's all he misses praise
[41:46] god you know
[41:49] so we're thankful for the revelation of
[41:51] this hour to know that god
[41:53] doesn't have two other people he can
[41:54] talk to amen he's the holy one
[41:57] of israel he said there's none beside me
[42:00] he said i only am the one of israel the
[42:02] holy one of israel
[42:04] so uh but it's a great book if you don't
[42:06] if you don't have a devotional it's a
[42:07] beautiful beautiful book
[42:09] okay it kind of goes through how you
[42:10] know you're called you're god's purpose
[42:12] for your life
[42:13] and then it comes down to like your home
[42:15] church as a chapter on that you know
[42:16] your home church and
[42:17] your gifts it's a really really nice
[42:20] book
[42:21] i think you'd like it if you don't have
[42:22] a devotional or anything purpose
[42:25] you're reading right now it would help
[42:27] you it really helped me
[42:28] um but some of these things as we get
[42:31] started here will be
[42:32] maybe a little review but i think
[42:34] they'll be a blessing to you
[42:36] uh how many people know god's will for
[42:37] your life amen
[42:39] brother branham said it's god's mystery
[42:41] is is i'm sorry god's will is a mystery
[42:43] and every man
[42:45] must search it out for his life you know
[42:47] as my children get older
[42:48] what do they love they love like dramas
[42:51] right
[42:52] uh we do kind of books that have
[42:54] christian themes you know
[42:55] uh and my kids are just all into the
[42:58] fictional stories they like adventures
[43:00] in odyssey the lamplighter theater you
[43:03] know christian good christian stories
[43:04] but why do they love them because
[43:06] there's adventure right
[43:08] there's mystery in church i say like
[43:10] that you know if our kids love so much
[43:12] if they love reading so much about all
[43:14] the mystery and the tension the struggle
[43:16] how much greater uh should we enjoy
[43:19] our lives and finding god's will for our
[43:21] lives
[43:22] in other words if people will flock to
[43:24] movie theaters and spend billions of
[43:26] dollars a year
[43:27] at movie theater for a story an
[43:29] adventure if that's so valuable to the
[43:32] world
[43:32] how much more valuable is it for you to
[43:34] search out your salvation with fear and
[43:36] trembling praise god
[43:38] because that's what you're doing church
[43:39] you're finding god's will for your life
[43:41] it's a mystery and i've said it before
[43:44] we'll get to it again in a little bit
[43:45] but
[43:45] uh brother vang it's from glory to glory
[43:48] you know
[43:49] god's will for your life is from one
[43:50] revelation to the next revelation amen
[43:53] and i showed you that with brother
[43:54] ramsey's ministry he went from one thus
[43:56] saith the lord the first pole
[43:57] to the second pole to the third pole
[44:00] praise god
[44:00] and his almost his entire life was based
[44:03] upon that
[44:04] remember the seven seal he said the
[44:05] thing i've wondered my whole life
[44:07] has now been revealed to me the third
[44:09] pole the seventh seal he wondered
[44:11] why am i attracted to the west he had to
[44:13] go out west to separate himself from his
[44:15] brethren
[44:16] the ones that worshipped him right many
[44:19] of them worshiped him and he had to
[44:20] separate himself
[44:21] to get the the inspiration to go back
[44:24] preach his seals and then come back out
[44:26] he had to separate himself from the
[44:28] people there in jeffersonville and now
[44:30] we can see why right
[44:31] we know a few years after uh
[44:33] jeffersonville kicked out brother
[44:34] neville
[44:34] because they didn't want a preacher they
[44:36] just wanted tapes only and that spirit's
[44:38] still alive today
[44:40] my church don't be discouraged mother
[44:41] graham said the fivefold ministry
[44:43] he said will remain preaching until
[44:45] jesus comes amen amen
[44:47] amen said the highest he said the uh the
[44:50] highest
[44:51] order or office in the world is to be a
[44:53] minister of the gospel
[44:55] a preacher of the gospel we don't
[44:57] magnify ourselves in that but we realize
[44:59] if god said it in that order it's got to
[45:01] remain there
[45:03] and so you can see brother man kept you
[45:04] know looking and searching and
[45:06] and when he found the will of god he
[45:08] rejoiced and
[45:09] and it was a glorious thing to find the
[45:12] will of god
[45:13] hallelujah now i want to just say this
[45:16] you know everybody all the churches if
[45:17] you went to any church today they would
[45:19] say oh we want to know god's will
[45:21] but the reality of it is god's will
[45:23] generally speaking is holiness
[45:26] right so uh pull up case you pull up
[45:28] second timothy 1 9. i just want to go
[45:30] back over a few of these
[45:31] it's been about a year since i've
[45:32] preached on the purpose series if i'm
[45:34] not mistaken
[45:35] i just want to drill this down into my
[45:37] heart i want the holy spirit to ride it
[45:38] upon your heart
[45:39] god's will is holiness generally
[45:43] speaking
[45:44] right it's more than just abstaining
[45:48] from
[45:49] idolatry right like the foolish virgin
[45:50] she will abstain from idols
[45:52] no no she'll have no idols in her life
[45:54] thank god for that
[45:56] uh but the the wise virgin goes a step
[45:59] further
[46:00] and she walks holy to the lord amen
[46:04] hallelujah holy h-o-l-y and holy
[46:07] w-h-o-l-l-y
[46:10] amen holy but also holy to the lord amen
[46:14] i forgot to set my own timer here
[46:15] forgive me
[46:18] everything's still blurry see it's just
[46:19] in and out you know
[46:21] maybe i got one of them backwards maybe
[46:22] that's it ii timothy 1 9
[46:24] who hath saved us and called us with an
[46:27] holy calling
[46:30] not according to our works but according
[46:32] to his own purpose
[46:34] amen and grace amen
[46:37] so his great look at this church his
[46:39] grace called us to holiness amen
[46:43] grace his unmerited favor she calls you
[46:46] to be holy now what is holy the greek
[46:49] says
[46:49] sacred physically pure morally blameless
[46:53] amen see god's grace calls you to be
[46:57] morally pure
[46:58] his grace is asking you his grace is
[47:01] pleading with you
[47:02] to live a pure life amen make the right
[47:05] moral choices in other words build your
[47:07] character
[47:08] in christ's pattern praise god amen so
[47:11] nobody can ever say well god hasn't
[47:12] called me to holiness no he has he's
[47:14] called all of us to holiness
[47:16] and that's why there'll be no excuses on
[47:17] the day of judgment god's calling
[47:20] is holiness paul said as we just read it
[47:22] he made known to me
[47:24] the mystery of his will this is his will
[47:26] generally speaking is live a holy life
[47:29] amen see he loves you
[47:33] so much he gave you a purpose
[47:37] and it started before the world began uh
[47:40] ephesians 1 4
[47:41] acacia still waiting for the blurriness
[47:44] to clear up
[47:47] ephesians 1 4 according as he has chosen
[47:50] us
[47:50] in him yes before the foundation of the
[47:53] world that we should be
[47:54] holy and without blame before him in
[47:58] love well jesse how can i live a more
[48:01] moral life
[48:02] follow get back to your first love right
[48:04] because when
[48:05] when you're first saved you have all
[48:06] this love and you'll you throw out
[48:09] everything for jesus because you love
[48:10] him so much
[48:11] amen when i got saved part of my
[48:12] testimony i took down my jennifer lopez
[48:15] pictures i ripped them off the wall
[48:16] i hate to say that but that's just how
[48:18] it was uh kathy ireland some of you
[48:20] probably remember her swimsuit model
[48:22] they're all in the swimsuit
[48:23] i literally when i got home from that
[48:25] athlete's action conference
[48:27] i literally balled them up and threw
[48:28] them in the trash
[48:30] and then i took out my nirvana my snoop
[48:32] dogg and metallica
[48:34] and i put that in the trash literally
[48:37] and i did it because i love i love what
[48:39] god did for me
[48:40] at the conference amen amen what did he
[48:43] do
[48:44] i cast my burdens upon him and he took
[48:46] my sins
[48:47] and he threw him in the sea of
[48:48] forgetfulness
[48:50] see it's love love is what does this the
[48:53] bible says that
[48:54] chosen in love and then
[48:57] he by his grace he calls us to be holy
[49:02] remember there's only four conditions
[49:03] you can be in holy righteous
[49:05] unholy and unrighteous
[49:08] there's only four conditions a heart can
[49:10] be in because four is the number of
[49:12] earth
[49:12] four's an earthly number so there's only
[49:14] four conditions
[49:16] there's only four reactions to the
[49:17] gospel of christ
[49:19] praise god and so uh
[49:22] now we have it established god's purpose
[49:24] is love
[49:25] grace for us to be holy
[49:28] he's called us away from the world
[49:31] it's still blurry so forgive me all
[49:34] right uh
[49:36] now if you pull up first thessalonians 4
[49:38] 7 and 8.
[49:40] i brought my glasses too on purpose
[49:41] because i thought well if they don't
[49:42] work i'm going to get my glasses for
[49:43] second service
[49:45] first thessalonians 4 7 and 8 speaks of
[49:48] holiness and the will of god
[49:50] i love this he said we are not called to
[49:53] uncleanness
[49:54] but unto holiness for god has not called
[49:57] us to unclean this praise god amen
[50:00] amen he didn't cause to be sexually
[50:03] impure
[50:04] he didn't call us to be morally impure
[50:06] he called us to be holy praise god
[50:10] but unto holiness see he therefore that
[50:12] despises him if people despise me for
[50:14] preaching that
[50:15] they're not despising me brother amen
[50:17] they're despising god amen
[50:19] because it's god's the one who called us
[50:21] to this praise the lord
[50:23] amen who have also given to unto us his
[50:27] holy spirit thank the lord amen
[50:31] he's holy he calls us the holiness and
[50:34] he gives us his holy spirit to
[50:36] accomplish it
[50:37] but church whenever god does something
[50:39] we'll be just like peter remember peter
[50:41] he pulled the man the lame man up and
[50:43] the bible said all the people looked at
[50:45] peter like he was something he said
[50:47] he said don't look at me he said what i
[50:49] don't have any power or
[50:50] holiness to do this
[50:54] but brother amen was he filled with the
[50:55] holy ghost yes
[50:57] that means any person who's born again
[50:59] the holy ghost
[51:00] they're holy in god's sight but they
[51:02] don't take credit for it
[51:04] because they didn't pay for it christ
[51:06] paid for it amen
[51:07] amen he was filled with the holy ghost
[51:10] but peter said why what power
[51:12] he said it wasn't my power it wasn't my
[51:14] holiness it was god's holiness
[51:17] oh that's beautiful my it's a paradox
[51:20] sister wendy
[51:21] we are holy we possess holiness we're
[51:24] sealed with holiness but we don't get
[51:26] the credit for it praise god
[51:28] amen amen when god does something great
[51:30] or something wonderful
[51:32] we don't say it wasn't by our holiness
[51:33] it was by jesus
[51:35] oh my god i love the word of god it's so
[51:38] powerful
[51:40] praise god uh did we read eight as well
[51:42] honey
[51:43] okay thank you we did okay so see
[51:47] anyone that despises our church they
[51:49] despise god
[51:51] right just like i read this this week
[51:53] that's why samuel said
[51:55] he said don't upset or god told samuel
[51:57] don't be upset they didn't reject you
[51:59] they rejected me
[52:02] see when a person rejects our church
[52:04] brother bang and they're not rejecting
[52:05] us or mean
[52:06] they're rejecting god is that right
[52:09] and we have to look at it like that when
[52:11] they when they look down on us
[52:14] it's not really us it's the god that
[52:16] lives in us
[52:18] because they don't like the holiness
[52:19] they don't like the the righteousness
[52:21] that that the word of god says
[52:23] but we love it praise god amen we love
[52:26] it we love a holy calling amen
[52:28] we love we we're pressing on towards the
[52:31] higher calling in christ jesus
[52:33] amen eagles can just go higher than
[52:36] chickens
[52:38] right they could they can just go higher
