[1:46] john chapter
[1:48] 21
[1:49] and we're going to read verses
[1:51] 20 down to 25 basically finishing the
[1:54] the chapter here
[2:02] john 21 verse 20.
[2:13] i'll read 20 to 23 then we can all read
[2:16] 24 and 25 together
[2:19] then peter turning about seeth the
[2:21] disciple whom jesus loved following
[2:24] which also lean on his breast at supper
[2:26] and said lord which is he that betrayeth
[2:30] thee
[2:32] peter seeing him sayeth to jesus lord
[2:35] and what shall this man do
[2:38] jesus saith unto him if i will that he
[2:40] tarry
[2:42] till i come what is that to thee
[2:45] follow thou me
[2:47] just a side lesson here if we're more
[2:50] worried about other people's walks with
[2:52] the lord than our own then jesus is here
[2:55] to correct us today
[2:57] praise god here's a man who's going to
[2:58] be filled with the holy ghost he's the
[3:00] spokesman on the day of pentecost he has
[3:02] the keys to the kingdom he said what
[3:03] about this guy and jesus says what is
[3:06] that to you
[3:07] you're going to get distracted from your
[3:09] calling from my calling for your life
[3:11] peter if you don't just listen to my
[3:13] voice for your life
[3:15] don't get distracted by worrying about
[3:16] what's that brother doing what's that
[3:18] sister doing
[3:19] what's going on there with that church
[3:20] don't worry about that you follow christ
[3:23] amen
[3:27] verse 23 then went this saying abroad
[3:29] among the brethren look what it cost
[3:30] because of peter's
[3:32] human side can i say like that because
[3:33] of his human side
[3:35] what do you know what do you have in
[3:36] store for john you know what's john's
[3:38] life going to be all about because of
[3:40] that there went that the disciples
[3:42] should not die they went out of saying
[3:43] now this wasn't a true saying but a
[3:46] false idea went out because
[3:49] of someone's concern about someone else
[3:52] right
[3:54] yet jesus said not unto him he shall not
[3:57] die but if i will that he tarried till i
[3:59] come
[4:00] what is that to thee
[4:03] let's read verse 24 and 25 on 3 1 2 3
[4:07] this is the disciple which testifieth of
[4:10] these things and wrote these things and
[4:13] we know that his testimony is true
[4:16] and there are also many other things
[4:19] which jesus did the which if they should
[4:22] be written every one i suppose that even
[4:25] the world itself could not contain the
[4:28] books that should be written amen let's
[4:31] have a word of prayer if you haven't
[4:32] eaten on your heart just make anointing
[4:33] to god somehow
[4:34] we'll just trust the holy spirit here to
[4:36] speak to us

[4:39] we have sung your songs and we have
[4:41] gratitude today lord god we're we're

[5:59] and lord just bring joy restore joy to
[6:02] the salvation of your people
[6:03] in jesus christ's name and the saint
[6:05] said
[6:06] amen god bless you as you're being
[6:07] seated praise god
[6:18] so we'll look here to this thought here
[6:20] and uh i hope it would be a blessing to
[6:22] you you know
[6:23] i was telling my sister betsy i was
[6:25] messaging her this week and
[6:28] she was uh
[6:30] she was really blessed by the joshua
[6:31] series i said well you're not the only
[6:33] one i said i've been blessed by that
[6:34] series and
[6:35] she said it's meant a lot to her
[6:38] it's meant a lot to me too
[6:39] to just have a refreshing look at how
[6:42] more than a conqueror
[6:43] and i have the spiritual armor on and i
[6:46] can cast down anything that exalts
[6:47] itself against the word of god
[6:50] and be a conqueror in this day praise
[6:51] god and that's helped me out a lot in
[6:53] this last year of my life
[6:57] and so
[6:58] you know we were just talking and um and
[7:02] just
[7:03] trying to you know encourage one another
[7:05] and and i'm actually not sure where i
[7:07] was going with that story now that i
[7:08] think of that uh i can't think of it now
[7:10] i got kind of delayed there or
[7:12] sidetracked i'm hoping it'll come back
[7:14] later
[7:15] um
[7:18] but uh we do want to look at this and
[7:20] and like oh yeah oh yeah there it is now
[7:22] i was uh telling her how you know
[7:24] through the joshua series i got a lot of
[7:26] inspiration from brother branham and
[7:27] there's another preacher from colorado i
[7:29] was getting a lot of inspiration from
[7:31] and then just regular inspiration from
[7:32] the holy spirit just inspiration that no
[7:35] no man i didn't hear any man preach it i
[7:37] just heard the voice of god
[7:39] and uh
[7:40] and so with this thought i actually
[7:42] heard you know this may sound strange
[7:43] but when i was studying the the false
[7:45] prophets i was listening to some of the
[7:47] false prophets and i got i got this
[7:49] thought from one of them
[7:51] and so uh it's a bible thought
[7:54] right and that's how most false prophets
[7:56] or teachers operate they'll use part of
[7:57] the word of god
[7:59] uh
[8:01] but then they'll take away
[8:03] other important parts of the word of god
[8:05] okay
[8:06] so just you know i always like to
[8:08] reference where i got this thought i
[8:09] actually got this thought from
[8:11] a mega preacher i'm not going to name
[8:13] his name today but i can tell you after
[8:15] his church if you like but
[8:16] um and then i started studying it i
[8:18] found brother rams quotes and it just
[8:19] kind of all came together so i hope this
[8:21] will be a help to you it's been helping
[8:23] me
[8:25] again to see the love of god and this
[8:27] reminded me of that leah sermon leah
[8:29] loved of the lord a few years ago on
[8:31] mother's day so as i was driving to
[8:33] church i just played that you know on
[8:34] one and a half speed so i could finish
[8:36] the sermon you know before i got here
[8:38] and just was reminded again of the love
[8:40] of god for all of us praise god
[8:43] and uh kind of reminded me of that
[8:44] message but we'll we'll look to the lord
[8:46] here and uh you can switch over is it
[8:47] not working
[8:49] okay maybe i got the wrong
[8:51] maybe i didn't plug it in the right way
[8:54] i have some quotes and some scriptures i
[8:56] like to show
[9:01] okay there we go all right so you know
[9:03] this i found this picture you know and i
[9:05] whenever i find the picture online i
[9:06] want to find the most godly one
[9:08] and this was probably the most godly one
[9:10] i i could find here that and uh you know
[9:12] how
[9:13] uh
[9:15] as much as i hear it i just love to hear
[9:17] more how john loved jesus so much that
[9:20] he actually leaned on him you know he
[9:22] i remember in the bible days you know a
[9:24] relationship between a husband and wife
[9:26] was was very different in bible days
[9:29] uh
[9:30] you know like the bible said david had
[9:31] such a love for jonathan it surpassed
[9:33] women
[9:34] well that's because they they weren't
[9:36] born again in those days
[9:38] right
[9:39] uh and of course we know there was
[9:41] nothing sinful about that the world
[9:42] tries to make that a sinful relationship
[9:44] but it wasn't but the i the fact was in
[9:46] the society
[9:48] sisters were very separated from
[9:49] brothers
[9:50] right so brothers would spend most their
[9:52] time with brothers right sisters would
[9:54] spend most their time with sisters
[9:56] and no doubt that that
[9:58] that culture even
[10:00] flowed and continued into jesus day and
[10:02] beyond and finally today we're at a day
[10:05] where at least in america and some
[10:07] western civilizations and other
[10:08] civilizations a woman is now uh in her
[10:11] place as equal to a man because the
[10:13] bible said in christ there's neither
[10:15] male nor female
[10:17] right but in jesus day remember
[10:19] a woman couldn't even give a testimony
[10:21] in a court trial she wasn't even trusted
[10:23] enough
[10:24] a woman was so looked down upon right
[10:29] and you know through time you know the
[10:30] the saints have realized and given more
[10:32] revelation on the value of a woman and
[10:35] they can see the types and shadows in
[10:37] the the proverbs 31 chapters praise god
[10:39] and they can see some of those types and
[10:41] shadows and now they they can have the
[10:43] the rest the restored idea of a sister
[10:46] and her place and position in a christ
[10:47] in the family they can have that uh that
[10:50] full revelation now because the day's
[10:52] the day of restoration today's the day
[10:54] when the mystery of god is finished
[10:56] praise god
[10:57] and uh but i just you know you know
[11:00] thinking about that that that that
[11:01] culture that exists at that time i can
[11:03] see how john as a young man
[11:05] would want to lean upon christ
[11:08] and he would just kind of
[11:10] just imagine that like
[11:12] who who actually lays in your chest you
[11:13] know i mean like how many people
[11:15] actually lay in your chest you know that
[11:17] are not your children or your spouse you
[11:19] know just very few you know we'd say
[11:22] and then who who climbs into your who
[11:25] climbs into your chest can i say like
[11:27] john would you
[11:28] he'd just lean up and kind of squeeze up
[11:30] on the lord you know he just kind of hug
[11:32] him up
[11:34] uh this is the kind of love that john
[11:36] had for christ how many want that love
[11:38] praise god that's how i feel like when i
[11:39] go to prayer like jesus i really need
[11:41] you i really need your touch i need to
[11:43] hear from you today
[11:45] uh
[11:45] and this is john this is john
[11:48] who is a you know the fourth gospel
[11:50] which is the fourth anointing the eagle
[11:52] anointing
[11:53] he's no doubt a prophet saw the visions
[11:55] of the book of revelation a type of that
[11:58] fourth anointing
[11:59] uh the the challenger to the fourth
[12:02] horse rider death right so this is life
[12:04] amen this is spiritual life this is the
[12:06] anointing of eagle life amen
[12:08] hallelujah because the spirit of jesus
[12:11] christ is the spirit of prophecy and our
[12:12] lives are prophetic
[12:14] uh speaking of christ in the church
[12:17] praise god
[12:19] so we see john here as a as a man who
[12:23] loved the lord now uh we did our texts
[12:26] and there's five verses five is grace
[12:28] right there's five verses that call
[12:31] where john himself we believe calls
[12:34] himself love to the lord
[12:37] okay there's at least five i believe
[12:39] there's five so let's read these and
[12:41] we'll just make some comments and
[12:44] you know in john chapter 13 23
[12:48] this is right after jesus washed their
[12:50] feet
[12:51] right at the last supper or there and he
[12:53] said now there was leaning on jesus's
[12:55] bosom
[12:56] one of his disciples
[12:58] whom jesus loved
[13:02] and so of course we see john here at the
[13:04] last supper uh leaning upon christ and
[13:07] and laying in his
[13:09] his bosom or his most intimate area here
[13:12] because he loved his savior so much
[13:14] praise god
[13:15] just a beautiful picture of john's love
[13:17] for
[13:18] christ in chapter 19
[13:22] at the cross as jesus is dying i just i
[13:25] just love this thought you know brother
[13:26] branham brought out in different ones
[13:28] that brought out how
[13:31] in jesus's last moments he was still
[13:33] concerned about others he wasn't so much
[13:36] concerned for himself he'd already
[13:38] battled that battle in the garden of
[13:39] gethsemane
[13:41] that's where he said lord take it away
[13:42] from me if it's possible take it away
[13:45] but the holy spirit told him no he must
[13:47] take this cup right that great
[13:49] conference like brother van priest's
[13:50] conferences
[13:52] the holy spirit had a great conference
[13:53] with christ in the garden of gethsemane
[13:55] and settled the matter there that's
[13:56] where the real victory of the cross came
[13:58] was in prayer
[13:59] praise god how you know you get great
[14:01] victories in prayer amen how many have
[14:03] had victories in prayer amen hallelujah
[14:05] that means you're gonna have more
[14:06] victories in prayer
[14:07] remember jesus said pray that you don't
[14:09] enter into sin
[14:12] if you feel like a sin is coming on or
[14:13] there's a temptation coming on if you
[14:15] feel the temper coming on go to prayer
[14:18] and the tempter will have to move back
[14:21] because you have strength now
[14:23] you have spiritual strength to overcome
[14:25] the temptation because now the comforter
[14:28] has made his presence fresh in your life
[14:30] amen
[14:32] and you've been comforted where you
[14:33] don't have to you don't have to give in
[14:34] to the enemy's lies or or his trap you
[14:37] don't have to you don't have to go to
[14:38] the enemy to try to have some
[14:40] satisfaction or some type of whirly
[14:42] pleasure or something like that because
[14:44] now the pleasure of the lord is what
[14:46] you've received and you're holding on
[14:48] and jesus has become your pleasure amen
[14:51] and you will not enter into sin for a
[14:53] season praise god amen
[14:56] the bible said sin is a pleasure for a
[14:59] season
[15:00] that's quite a striking thought right
[15:03] we've all experienced as sinners we've
[15:04] all experienced the the spring season
[15:07] and the summer season of sin right most
[15:09] of us have
[15:11] where you just enjoyed sin
[15:14] there was a time where i just enjoyed
[15:15] doing all those evil things i just
[15:17] enjoyed it it was i stayed up late for
[15:19] it i get up early for it
[15:21] but there's a season where that ended
[15:23] amen thank god hallelujah thank god amen
[15:27] and then pretty soon out of fall season
[15:28] where
[15:29] that those desires were dying away right
[15:31] falling away
[15:33] then you come to the winter season where
[15:35] where it's like yesterday where i just
[15:37] hate being outside right we hate it
[15:39] because it's death death is overcome
[15:42] uh the season and thank god we got to
[15:45] that place amen brother austin just got
[15:46] to that place recently amen where sin
[15:49] was no longer a pleasure amen
[15:52] but it was a like a pig pen it was like
[15:54] a a freezing uh wilderness where there
[15:57] was no hope and there was there's
[15:58] nothing to attract him to the sin
[16:00] anymore so he cried out to god and he
[16:02] came home to god and god received him
[16:04] amen
[16:06] glory on jesus's cross he looks out like
[16:10] the disciple
[16:12] that he loved
[16:13] and said to him
[16:15] this woman is your
[16:17] mother
[16:19] and he said he said woman this boy is
[16:21] your son
[16:23] on the cross
[16:25] praise god what love jesus has for us
[16:29] praise god amazing love
[16:31] that he has for us even for his mother
[16:36] the second and third time are here
[16:39] after the resurrection uh she runeth and
[16:42] come to simon peter another disciple
[16:43] whom jesus loved
[16:45] and saith unto them they've taken away
[16:48] the lord out of the
[16:49] supper
[16:51] and we know not where they have laid him
[16:54] okay so they ran specifically and the
[16:56] bible specifically names simon and john
[17:00] peter and john as the ones the woman ran
[17:02] to to tell them the good news he's risen
[17:05] did they believe him or did they believe
[17:06] her not no not really not till later
[17:10] and then in chapter 21 verse 7 the bible
[17:13] said therefore the disciple whom jesus
[17:14] loved saith unto peter it is the lord
[17:17] now when simon peter heard there was a
[17:18] lord he gird about his fisher's coat
[17:20] unto him for he was naked so like in a
[17:22] swimming garment right swimming swimming
[17:23] clothes his undergarments on
[17:26] and he'd cast himself into the sea he
[17:28] wasn't ex he wasn't completely naked he
[17:30] just had that outer or i'm sorry that
[17:32] inner tunic like his underwear on right
[17:33] that's just his underwear he had that on
[17:37] and then uh the fifth time
[17:39] was what we read for our text
[17:43] where uh john is uh he's closing out the
[17:46] book
[17:47] and he he tells us that
[17:49] that peter wanted to know about his life
[17:51] and and his you know john's calling for
[17:54] his life and as we said it there in the
[17:56] uh
[17:56] at the beginning you know we got to be
[17:58] careful not to worry about other people
[18:00] so much
[18:01] now we're supposed to bear their burdens
[18:03] like recently i had a couple of people
[18:04] tell me thank you for bearing my burden
[18:07] i couldn't handle this burden so thank
[18:09] you for uh bearing that for me
[18:12] uh and that's what we're supposed to do
[18:14] as brothers and sisters
[18:15] but the fact that jesus rebuked peter
[18:18] it shows that peter must have had the
[18:20] wrong intention about this question
[18:22] right he wasn't born again yet
[18:25] he said well what do you what about john
[18:27] what do you do with john
[18:29] and jesus says what is that to you
[18:32] so that moment he was worried about
[18:33] something that he should not have been
[18:35] concerned about
[18:37] and that's what the devil likes to do he
[18:39] likes to make us worry about things we
[18:40] shouldn't even worry about
[18:42] why are we wasting our why are we
[18:43] wasting our energy on those kind of
[18:45] things
[18:48] if that is god's will
[18:49] you're wondering about god's will if it
[18:51] is god's will what is that to you
[18:54] in other words jesus is saying you're
[18:56] not going to really serve with john so
[18:57] much
[18:58] you have a different ministry remember
[19:00] it's peter peter spent most of his time
[19:02] right around jerusalem right
[19:04] establishing the church there
[19:06] john was
[19:07] ephesus right and then later to the isle
[19:10] of patmos uh
[19:11] boiled in oil but over
[19:13] they couldn't boil out the holy ghost
[19:15] out of them
[19:16] praise god amen my
[19:18] what a what a testimony these men had
[19:21] hallelujah
[19:23] such men of god
[19:25] so we we understand there's a there's a
[19:30] there's a desire that's wrong to want to
[19:32] know about other people's calling for
[19:33] their life so for us it would be why
[19:35] worry about the other
[19:36] churches you know
[19:40] now
[19:41] of course again balance that because
[19:42] there are times where god's going to use
[19:43] you to correct somebody
[19:45] god's going to use you to
[19:46] encourage somebody
[19:49] but this of course was not the right
[19:51] attitude because he gets rebuked by
[19:53] christ
[19:54] so five times we see
[19:56] that
[19:58] john calls himself the disciple whom
[20:00] jesus loved now this is a good thought i
[20:02] heard a preacher also just a different
[20:04] preacher i heard him from minnesota
[20:07] john piper john piper
[20:10] i listen i go into him because he's
[20:12] he
[20:13] they don't have everything right but
[20:14] he's a he's a student of the bible
[20:16] now he's really getting off on some
[20:18] things lately but of course that's my
[20:19] opinion but i believe it's right by the
[20:21] word of god
[20:22] but anyways i like to go to him because
[20:23] he has a lot of deep thoughts in the
[20:25] word and he brought out this point that
[20:27] jesus loved all his disciples
[20:29] and so he made the point you have to go
[20:31] through the whole book of john and see
[20:33] all the people that jesus loved
[20:36] so i just typed in the word love i did
[20:37] this study yesterday you know on the
[20:39] drive to the wedding
[20:41] and back
[20:42] and what did what did john say about the
[20:44] love of god
[20:45] right so we'd have to know
[20:47] is john saying jesus loved me more than
[20:49] you
[20:52] what was john saying i'll kind of save
[20:54] that for the end so i'll let you
[20:55] meditate on that for a few minutes
[21:02] let's look at what jesus said about love
[21:05] and john what john said about jesus love
[21:07] jesus john said that god so loved the
[21:09] world in fact this is jesus's words
[21:11] john's quoting jesus god so loved the
[21:13] world that he gave his only begotten son
[21:15] that's pretty good memory verse isn't it
[21:17] yes
[21:19] but now you have to balance this out
[21:20] with
[21:22] uh
[21:23] this idea this divine love that god
[21:25] gives everybody a chance to be saved
[21:26] because he loves him so much
[21:28] but if god knows a group won't repent
[21:30] anymore then god's going to have jesus
[21:32] not pray for them anymore
[21:34] because god's not going to waste jesus's
[21:36] time
[21:38] right because in john 17 9 jesus said i
[21:40] pray for my disciples i pray not for the
[21:43] world
[21:44] but for them which thou has given me for
[21:46] they are thine
[21:48] now we don't have that ability we don't
[21:50] know who's saved and who's not unless
[21:52] the holy spirit lets us know
[21:53] but i'll tell you this a lot of people i
[21:55] thought were holy ghost filled i found
[21:56] out later we're definitely not
[21:58] a lot of people i thought weren't filled
[22:00] with the holy ghost seem like they are
[22:02] praise god
[22:05] because we only have a small window into
[22:08] people's lives we only see a little bit
[22:10] about how they live and we think my
[22:12] that's
[22:13] brother's a real fine man of god find
[22:15] out later he wasn't
[22:17] or that sister or she's a real wonderful
[22:19] sister or she was an awful sister find
[22:21] out why she's pretty she's very
[22:23] sanctified i misunderstood it right i
[22:25] misunderstood the situation
[22:27] we have a very limited perspective so
[22:29] again it goes back to that idea don't
[22:31] worry about other people you just live
[22:32] for christ
