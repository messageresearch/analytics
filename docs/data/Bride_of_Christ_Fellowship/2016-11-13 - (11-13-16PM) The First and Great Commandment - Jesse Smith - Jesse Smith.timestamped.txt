[24:41] inspiration room for this message from
[24:43] dated Bible reading and I was just
[24:46] inspired so we'll get to that a little
[24:47] bit I want to preach a lot of Josiah
[24:49] tonight I looked up to assign the
[24:50] messenger brother Graham did say his
[24:52] name one time so I'll just be pulling
[24:53] scriptures I'm sure you'll see the
[24:56] scriptural truce you know through the
[24:57] other scriptures and things that brother
[24:58] has said I'm sure you'll see it tonight
[25:00] by God's grace okay so I want to start
[25:03] let's let's read all the others three
[25:05] texts here where Jesus or three parallel
[25:08] passages where Jesus is recorded quoting
[25:11] Deuteronomy 6 4 and 5 but let's let's
[25:13] start let's go back to Matthew 22 here
[25:16] if we can verse 34 Matthew 22 34 let's
[25:25] get the itch and every passage so we can
[25:28] get the full understanding of of this
[25:31] story here gives us a a good foundation
[25:34] to understand it in 20 to 34 when the
[25:40] Pharisees had heard that he had put the
[25:42] Sadducees to silence they were gathered
[25:45] together then one of them which was a
[25:48] lawyer asked him a question tempting him
[25:50] saying bannister which is the Great
[25:53] Commandment in the law it's quite a
[25:56] question one time I read there was 612
[25:58] laws in the Old Testament they said
[26:00] which one of the 612 which one is the
[26:03] great law what a question to ask and
[26:06] jesus answered verse 37 and Jesus said
[26:09] unto Him thou shalt love the Lord thy
[26:12] God with all thy heart and with all thy
[26:15] soul and with all thy but this is the
[26:20] first and Great Commandment and the
[26:24] second is like unto it thou shalt love
[26:26] thy neighbor as thyself on these two
[26:32] Commandments hang all the law and the
[26:34] prophets amen so that's a good a good
[26:39] quote there
[26:40] see that I want you to understand a few
[26:46] things here I want to relate these here
[26:47] by God's grace notice that Jesus
[26:53] identifies four things now this one just
[26:57] has three but the other portion has four
[26:59] things and I believe these four
[27:00] basically fall into the three parts of a
[27:03] man okay but let me bring that out he
[27:06] says all your heart that's your
[27:08] affections right is it obvious that your
[27:09] heart is deceitful above all things and
[27:11] when you get saved you have a heart of
[27:13] stone but then when you go after you're
[27:14] saying I a heart of flesh is that your
[27:17] affections the things you love so that
[27:19] your emotions will say like that that's
[27:21] your motion so love God with all your
[27:22] emotion and with all your soul and I
[27:26] Souls your nature right that's what a
[27:27] solo Souls the nature of the human
[27:28] spirit so love God with all the nature
[27:31] inside of you all your soul and with all
[27:35] your mind now that's the rest of the
[27:36] human sphere we'd say you're thinking
[27:38] right you're conscious your memory
[27:40] reason imagination so love God with all
[27:43] that now the other one we ready
[27:45] lieutenant says strength and that
[27:46] there's your body right there your
[27:48] physical strength love God other words
[27:50] love God with everything you have that's
[27:53] what Jesus said this is the greatest
[27:54] command to us Jesus says the first and
[27:59] Great Commandment auch about them about
[28:05] this morning you know loving ourselves
[28:07] should be secondarily right you should
[28:10] love what God told you to be but not
[28:12] love yourself to worship yourself or
[28:14] give yourself too much praise or be
[28:15] prideful but the real believer loves God
[28:19] with all their heart and then loves
[28:21] their neighbor right so that's that's
[28:23] how you that's how a Christian
[28:25] approaches life I love God with
[28:26] everything and this love I have for God
[28:28] causes me to love my neighbors amen
[28:31] remember the Bible said there were to be
[28:33] lovers of themselves more than lovers of
[28:35] God that's the look I love we want to
[28:36] stay away from the lover of self we
[28:39] don't to love ourselves like our flesh
[28:41] or you know we don't want to baby
[28:43] ourselves or make ourselves too
[28:45] comfortable we want to love the Lord
[28:47] Jesus Christ first and love of course we
[28:49] love what God called us to be as we
[28:50] mentioned this morning I just want to
[28:51] make sure I balance that out and say
[28:53] that we
[28:54] I put Christ first love Christ first
[28:56] amen and then love your neighbor as
[28:59] yourself now notice on these two
[29:01] Commandments and all the law and the
[29:04] prophets now a few these if you look up
[29:06] the word hang there it needs summarized
[29:09] so all the rest of the law everything in
[29:12] the Old Testament all the prophets are
[29:14] summarized by these two commands so God
[29:17] said all those profits can you imagine
[29:18] Haggai and Zechariah Malachi and Moses
[29:21] and Joshua and all these prophets of God
[29:24] said all of them are summarizing these
[29:26] two Commandments love God with all your
[29:28] heart and love your neighbors yourself
[29:30] amen they all hate me all depend upon
[29:33] those these two things loving God and
[29:36] loving others amen nor denominations
[29:39] pick that up sometimes and they got it
[29:41] right they got those words right you
[29:43] must love God and love neighbors right
[29:45] that's the first and Great Commandment
[29:47] but when it comes down to the word we
[29:50] got to make sure we keep all the word
[29:51] Amen loving God means hating sin let me
[29:54] know that I saw the way you know you
[29:56] love God in fear God as if you hate sin
[29:58] because God is holiness God is
[30:00] righteousness if you love god you'll
[30:02] hate evil because God is the Holy Spirit
[30:04] not the unholy spirit amen so let's keep
[30:09] that in our thinking here the heart your
[30:11] affections your soul their very nature
[30:13] of your being the seed inside of you
[30:15] need to love God love it with all you
[30:17] have strength is your body and your mind
[30:20] is your thoughts and these are the
[30:22] people Jesus says that inherit eternal
[30:24] life god gives eternal life to those who
[30:27] love God with everything they have I'm
[30:29] just as my let's just say like this our
[30:31] live city so consumed with the word of
[30:34] God amen how can I love God with more of
[30:37] my heart I can look out more of my mind
[30:39] Laura my strength what more can I do for
[30:42] the Lord amen and that's the kind of
[30:46] person Jesus says will inherit eternal
[30:48] life those who give their uh their
[30:50] feelings their thinking their soul and
[30:53] their body their strength give
[30:55] everything to god there's a kind against
[30:57] eternal life what a blessing that is I
[30:59] want you to know there's one person who
[31:02] did this without any fault and that was
[31:06] the Lord Jesus Christ amen
[31:08] Lord Jesus Christ the Lord Jesus Christ
[31:15] kept all these Commandments so Jesus
[31:19] fully lived this out Jesus loved the
[31:21] father with all his heart sold my body
[31:23] strength how many believe that
[31:25] hallelujah he kept all that and he loved
[31:28] everyone else as himself right he
[31:30] treated the others people's needs before
[31:32] his amen all right now want to read
[31:38] though this one of John chapter or 15
[31:40] here John 15 10 if we can read that how
[31:49] do we know Jesus love the father because
[31:51] he obeyed the father that's verse 10
[31:55] John 15 10 if you keep my Commandments
[31:58] he shall abide in my love even as I have
[32:00] kept my father's command it and by abide
[32:04] in his love praise God alright so that's
[32:08] how we know we're in the love of God we
[32:11] abide the love of God by keeping the
[32:14] commandments oh Jesus love God with all
[32:16] of his heart soul mind and strength and
[32:20] because of that he inherited eternal
[32:23] life amen praise God he sure did any of
[32:26] the Bible said he ever lives that never
[32:28] to die anymore praise the Lord he's the
[32:30] only one that kept all these all the
[32:32] time with on in his entire life of his
[32:35] heart soul mind and strength amen that's
[32:38] the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah so we
[32:43] want to love that we want to show the
[32:44] father we love him as well by keeping
[32:46] his commands loving in and then loving
[32:49] our neighbor praise God also now let's
[32:57] look at the next one mark 12 28 mark 12
[33:01] 28 same type of a story here same story
[33:07] with great Commandments
[33:15] and one of the scribes came in having
[33:17] heard them reasoning together receiving
[33:19] the heat and answered them well as to
[33:21] which is the first commandment of all
[33:23] and jesus answered him the first of all
[33:25] the commandments is hear o Israel the
[33:28] Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt
[33:32] love the Lord thy God with all thy heart
[33:33] with all thy soul with all thy mind and
[33:37] with all thy strength this is the first
[33:41] commandment amen and the second is like
[33:44] namely this thou shalt love thy neighbor
[33:46] as thyself there is none other
[33:48] commandment greater than these over here
[33:51] and the scribes that have been well
[33:53] master that has said the truth for there
[33:56] is one God and there is none other than
[33:58] he and to love him with all the heart
[34:01] and with all the understanding and with
[34:04] all the soul and with all the strength
[34:07] and the love his neighbors himself is
[34:08] more than all the whole burnt offerings
[34:11] and sacrifices Amen hallelujah and when
[34:15] Jesus other the answer discreetly he
[34:16] said unto Him thou art not far from the
[34:19] kingdom of God and don't mad after that
[34:21] Durst ask him any questions amen look
[34:25] how much God loves to be loved remember
[34:29] what brother man said he said God
[34:30] looking for one man or woman that he
[34:32] could just get fully in his hand and did
[34:35] Jesus says if you can love God would
[34:38] like that it's greater than any animal
[34:41] sacrifices and all the great amounts of
[34:43] sacrifices you can possibly give church
[34:46] that's why God had to send the Holy
[34:47] Ghost let me know that solvin how many
[34:50] how many thousands of offerings or me
[34:54] I'd like to go back and check I don't
[34:56] remember how many that was how many
[34:58] thousands of offering solid and gain at
[35:00] the dedication right of the temple that
[35:03] he built but yet later in his life what
[35:05] happened he fell away from the Lord he
[35:08] built altars unto false gods and his
[35:10] wives turned his heart away from serving
[35:12] God so those who show is not how many
[35:15] physical animal sacrifices you could
[35:17] give but it's how much you love them
[35:19] more praise God how much of your
[35:22] thinking you'll give to God how much of
[35:24] your heart how much of your
[35:26] understanding how much of your
[35:28] all and how much of your strength will
[35:29] give to god that's what God wants it's
[35:32] greater than all of the burnt offerings
[35:34] all the burn all the sacrifices you can
[35:37] possibly give God would take the love
[35:39] above all that amen that's my prayer
[35:42] lord help me to love you with all I have
[35:44] amen and he says you're not harm licking
[35:48] the guy what's the kingdom of God the
[35:50] baptismal Holy Ghost amen to say you're
[35:53] not far for being born again because you
[35:55] know to love God is the greatest thing
[35:58] we could possibly do or let's make sure
[36:02] we're watching what things we love amen
[36:05] let's make sure we're watching our words
[36:07] well I love this right I just love do
[36:08] that I'd love to travel i'd love to do
[36:10] this i love to buy that let's be careful
[36:12] what we say things that we love I us to
[36:17] love the Lord with all of our hearts all
[36:19] of our mind and our strength amen how
[36:24] many enjoy that by God's grace if we
[36:29] could let's go now to let's get down
[36:31] let's go to judges here if we can judges
[36:35] chapter 16 verse four judges 16 verse 4

[36:50] your being of course your your heart

[37:46] minus be bound to afflict Lee now we
[37:50] know Samson tells her something false
[37:52] but first few times and then she gets
[37:56] really desperate go down to verse 15 and
[38:01] she said a name how canst i'll say i
[38:04] love thee when thy heart is not with me
[38:06] i was locked me these three times and
[38:08] has not told me to wear by Greg strength
[38:10] Liath and it came to pass when she
[38:12] pressed him daily with her words and
[38:14] urged him said his soul was vexed unto
[38:17] death then he told her all his heart and
[38:20] said unto her there hath not come a
[38:22] razor Paul my head for I have been in as
[38:25] right unto God for my mother's womb if I
[38:29] be shave and then my strength will go
[38:31] from me and I shall become weak and be
[38:34] like any other man and when Delilah saw
[38:37] that he had told her all his heart she
[38:39] sent and called for the Lords of the
[38:40] phils to insane come up this once forget
[38:43] showed me all his heart and the Lords of
[38:45] the Philistines came up under her and
[38:47] brought money in their hand I look
[38:50] church can't you see this look how Satan
[38:52] tempts people it's every day right what
[38:55] you do every day she kept their Tyson
[38:57] look that's how we're supposed to be
[38:59] with God right jesus said we're supposed
[39:01] to come like a little woman and come
[39:02] a-knockin and bright every single day
[39:04] well look if you're not praying like
[39:06] what singing is going to do say it's
[39:07] gonna come knocking on your door every
[39:09] day right he's going to come knock and
[39:11] every day to try to get you to do the
[39:12] wrong thing deceive you a little bit and
[39:15] look he didn't shut her up he could have
[39:17] sent her away he could have done all
[39:18] these things and but he did it because
[39:21] he did
[39:22] give God all of his heart instead of
[39:25] giving God his heart he gave who his his
[39:29] lover his heart instead of Christ Jesus
[39:32] in other words the Holy Spirit we'd say
[39:35] and look if we're not constantly seeking
[39:38] God then what's going to happen then
[39:40] we're going to let Satan keep knocking
[39:42] on our hearts right and follow the
[39:45] temptation fall into struggles we've got
[39:48] to keep seeking God okay seeking God's
[39:51] will rather than uh you know letting
[39:54] temptations become stronger and stronger
[39:57] in our lives amen now I'm going to read
[40:03] this quote by the Barisan there's too
[40:05] many people like Samson today Samson
[40:08] gave god is strength but he wouldn't
[40:10] give him his heart God could use his
[40:13] strength but not his heart Samson was
[40:16] somewhat a ladies man you know and he
[40:17] just couldn't give him his heart he had
[40:20] to give that to Delilah but he gave his
[40:22] strength to God God use his strength but
[40:26] he couldn't use his heart he said so are
[40:29] many people today they say God yo uh he
[40:33] said done he said God I'll build you a
[40:34] big house I'll make you an organization
[40:36] out of this out of that they don't you
[40:38] don't you realize this that's the same
[40:40] thing came in it was rejected amen he's
[40:44] trying to find a man that will follow
[40:46] him he had one he had one then Abraham
[40:49] he was a perfect man whatever God said
[40:52] that was all right amen so can you see
[40:56] that here's a great example of someone
[40:59] that didn't love God with all their
[41:01] heart soul mind and strength he gave a
[41:04] strength to God right brother Brad said
[41:05] he was a shrimp he was a real shrimpy
[41:07] kind of man Samson he wasn't something
[41:09] big burly man he was a shrimpy man but
[41:11] he let God anointed but he gave got his
[41:13] strength he would physically pulled out
[41:15] gates and and you'll kill Brooke I'm
[41:17] lying apart all kinds of things like
[41:19] that but he didn't you got his heart
[41:21] he's God that's why your personal time
[41:25] what you do in your personal time when
[41:28] no one's around that's your real love
[41:29] right there only be then that's real
[41:33] love whatever you do when you're all
[41:35] alone and you have no free
[41:36] Todd no one's around what you do right
[41:38] there shows what you really love that's
[41:41] exactly right and Sampson and his free
[41:44] time going to be with Delilah you'll he
[41:47] he he was the wrong person I'm state
[41:51] like that he should not have been with
[41:52] Delilah because it led to his fall
[41:54] praise the Lord and he didn't give God
[41:56] his heart he just kidding you've got his
[41:59] strength that's what we got to be
[42:01] careful we gotta be careful yo just give
[42:03] you got our strength and coming to
[42:04] church right that's your giving God your
[42:06] strength tonight right you could be
[42:09] anywhere else you could be anywhere else
[42:11] you're working or doing something or
[42:12] resting or something like that you're
[42:14] giving God your strength tonight just
[42:16] like you gave this morning but not only
[42:18] should we give them our strength we got
[42:20] to give my heart to our affections they
[42:22] aren't our bind as well Lord build my
[42:26] fine let me fill my buyer with the
[42:28] thoughts of God I mean like that by
[42:30] God's grace amen that's beautiful
[42:34] librettist everybody's like that well
[42:36] Hobart Alberto will go to church what is
[42:39] this for gone what does that forgot but
[42:41] we got to give God every part of our
[42:42] being all of our thoughts all harm
[42:45] infections everything we love and all of
[42:46] our strength of our soul every part of
[42:49] it amen I hope you like that by God's
[42:52] grace that's a perfect example I didn't
[42:54] get to see people that give God part of
[42:56] it another one's Judas I didn't have any
[42:57] notes on this but we know Judas right he
[42:59] was sent out at the beginning you must
[43:01] have done good you must had a good mind
[43:03] right he was a preacher he's apostle uh
[43:06] he was must have had a good strength
[43:08] because he was SAT up two by two and
[43:10] they went to cities and prepared to
[43:12] weigh him for Jesus to come into the
[43:13] town and administer but at some point he
[43:16] musta gave his heart to Satan because
[43:18] the Bible said that Satan entered into
[43:21] his heart after the the past Oh remember
[43:24] that he entered into his heart and
[43:27] caused him to deceive or to betray our
[43:31] Lord amen so Judas is another example he
[43:34] didn't give God all of his feet praise
[43:36] God I said I just God what's all or
[43:39] nothing I say like that God was all or
[43:42] nothing we want to give God all programs
[43:44] said if you're not ready to sell out
[43:46] lock stock and barrel to Jesus he said
[43:48] don't come at all amen
[43:49] although we're ready we should sell out
[43:52] everything and serve the Lord Jesus
[43:54] Christ amen we must give God every part
[43:58] of our life now let me show a few quotes
[44:03] from other random angel the Lord 1951
[44:07] April 14 you better women I'm sorry and
[44:10] men and women you know where you stand
[44:12] tonight there's only one person knows
[44:14] its nose it that's God knows where you
[44:17] stand so if so if your hearts right with
[44:20] God really live for him be true to him
[44:24] love him so much that everything else
[44:26] becomes secondarily and then you'll love
[44:31] him with all your heart with all your
[44:32] strength with all your soul with all
[44:34] your mind God will lead you then amen he
[44:38] was that wonder of God which way like oh
[44:39] god lead me they can't buy the leading
[44:42] because they don't love God with all
[44:43] their hearts you have to love God with
[44:46] all your heart so much strength
[44:47] everything and then God will lead you in
[44:49] paths of righteousness amen and it says
[44:53] the footsteps of a righteous man is
[44:55] ordered by the Lord I'll alluvium our
[45:00] restore saith the Lord in New York on
[45:03] august 29 1954 program said so if you
[45:06] want to get closer to God just get close
[45:09] to love just love God with all your
[45:13] heart with all your soul with all your
[45:15] mind with all your strength just wrap
[45:17] yourself in a bundle of love Lori watch
[45:21] that man you said watch that man that
[45:25] you did like like you praise the Lord
[45:28] you can win people over with love let me
[45:30] know that and that rides but real love
[45:32] what I tried to bribe people to love us
[45:35] and like us we're trying to really love
[45:37] them hallelujah the man said you ever
[45:41] get around anybody you see nice people
[45:42] that you couldn't hardly stand to be
[45:44] around them now you know that's right
[45:46] isn't it I've seen people like that
[45:48] maybe they just love to be in their
[45:50] presence haven't you seen people like
[45:52] that do you realize that your sons of
[45:55] God the atmosphere and the air that you
[45:58] live in you create a situation around
[46:00] you and either drawers or push
[46:02] away so so think about your life today
[46:05] are you driving people away by your
[46:08] presence or you drawing that in amen
[46:10] that's what love does love is supposed
[46:14] to draw people into you praise the Lord
[46:16] and that's the kind of people that we
[46:19] want to be because then people want to
[46:21] be a rounded up say man hallelujah so we
[46:28] want to get close to God wrap yourself
[46:30] in a bundle of love he says what a good
[46:32] thought amen all right so let's uh now
[46:39] let's go to a second Kings 23 let's look
[46:42] at this here this was just was really
[46:46] blessed by this I'm hoping to blessing
[46:48] you church I really hope it is tonight
[46:49] by God's grace I've never preach on
[46:51] geoscience this be my first time ever
[46:52] preaching on jones i will just hit the
[46:56] highlights in his life i actually sort
[46:59] of chapter 22 I'm sorry I can see why I
[47:06] you know I know different ones that are
[47:08] named Josiah because he had such a
[47:09] powerful testimony in the Bible looks
[47:11] like only at the end of his life that he
[47:12] goes little stray you know or maybe make
[47:15] a bad decision about not he tried to do
[47:17] the skies and then you got killed in
[47:20] battle but look at verse 1 Josiah was
[47:24] eight years old when he began to rain
[47:25] and he reigned 30 and one years in
[47:28] Jerusalem and his mother's name was
[47:30] jadida the daughter of an ayah and boss
[47:36] cat and he did that which was right in
[47:39] the side the Lord and walked in all the
[47:41] way up David his father and turned that
[47:44] aside to the right hand or to the left
[47:48] now to just go through this a little
[47:50] quickly here by God's grace there was
[47:54] remember there's very few Kings that
[47:55] actually walked good before God he was
[47:58] one of them and it's interesting I don't
[48:01] know the answer this but the Bible says
[48:02] both Hezekiah and Josiah serve God with
[48:05] all their hearts and there wasn't a man
[48:06] like them before or after that that's
[48:09] what the Bible says about both I'm still
[48:11] waiting for the revelation on that I
[48:12] don't understand that but they are both
[48:14] the Bible says walked in
[48:16] updated their father and there was no
[48:17] one like that before no one liked him
[48:19] afterwards remember hold Hezekiah was
[48:22] before Josiah just so you know now when
[48:25] a Josiah turned turned 24 I'm sorry 2626
[48:32] because in the 18 years of ministry uh
[48:34] he started happening into the desire to
[48:37] rebuild the house of God amen I'm sorry
[48:41] 26 26 so what he did he started calling
[48:45] people to do work and he started
[48:47] repairing the doors and the breaches to
[48:49] the house of the Lord so spots were was
[48:52] broken he hired carpenters and builders
[48:55] and masons and timber wood and stone
[48:58] hewers and so forth and he started
[49:01] rebuilding the house of the Lord look
[49:03] God was merciful to him 18 years he
[49:05] served didn't even help the house of God
[49:07] and then all of a sudden of a 26
[49:09] something changed in his mind he said
[49:12] I'm going to start putting my focus for
[49:13] the house of god I hope your focus is
[49:15] toward the house of God I believe it is
[49:16] tonight it's god bless you for coming
[49:18] coming tonight by God's grace even if
[49:20] anyone else they'll come we want to come
[49:22] and hear the word of the Lord amen I
[49:24] never found anything greater that here
[49:26] is the word of God sitting at the feet
[49:28] of Jesus loving Jesus but look how his
[49:31] heart turns toward God he's 26 years old
[49:35] 18 years he's been on the throne he
[49:37] started at eight years old and finally
[49:40] starts let's put us with our focus let's
[49:42] put our attention on the Word of God
[49:44] let's put it on the house of God and
[49:47] look at verse 8 and he'll kiya the hype
[49:51] reset of the shape of the scribe I have
[49:53] found the book of the law of the house
[49:55] the Lord and he'll kiya gave the book to
[49:57] a fan and he read it now verse 10 shape
[50:02] it reads it before the king so
[50:05] apparently Josiah had not read most of
[50:08] the law or parts of the law because they
[50:11] find the law in the house of God and
[50:13] that's where you'll find the revelation
[50:15] church for your life is in the house of
[50:17] the Lord hey man glory hallelujah first
[50:21] 10 verse 11 and it came to pass when the
[50:24] King had heard the words of the book of
[50:26] law that he rent his clothes here's a
[50:28] man
[50:29] he had just not heard the Word of God
[50:31] before but as soon as he hears it it
[50:34] strikes him is so personal that he rents
[50:36] his clothes even that was a sign of
[50:39] repentance remember and Joel in the days
[50:44] of Joey got so common to write your
[50:45] clothes that God's old Joe he said tell
[50:48] the people don't rent her clothes he
[50:50] said rent your hearts amen how dare you
[50:53] it just became common people just they
[50:55] didn't act like it offers going to be
[50:57] sorrowful and they rent their clothes of
[50:59] course they had layers on you know
[51:00] Israelites always more layers they dread
[51:02] that outer garment or the outer mantle
[51:04] and I got tired of that player on
[51:06] renting your clothes he said rend your
[51:09] hearts amen well Josiah was sincere it
[51:12] really meant something so when he read
[51:14] his outer garment if that o God my
[51:16] heart's being torn out this word is
[51:19] burning me I have such a desire for this
[51:22] word in my life how many feel that way
[51:24] brings God hey man that's what Josiah
[51:27] Eddie read his clothes and repented and
[51:31] then he read this on Wednesday night
[51:33] then he sends all of his men to go to
[51:36] hold up the woman Providence wet now
[51:39] saved the Lord a member what she say
[51:41] there wouldn't be run out Wednesday
[51:42] night she basically said you'll be
[51:44] parted from the destruction in your
[51:46] lifetime Josiah but those after you
[51:48] won't have to suffer because of all the
[51:50] sins all the abominations that Israel's
[51:52] committed now go to chapter 23 in
[51:56] chapter 23 verse 2 and the king went up
[52:02] into the house the Lord and all the man
[52:03] of Judah and all the inhabitants of
[52:05] Jerusalem with him and the priests of
[52:06] the prophets and all the people both
[52:08] small great and he ran in their ears all
[52:10] the words of the book of this covenant
[52:11] which was found in the house the Lord so
[52:16] do you see this he got so burdened she
[52:19] was I started you know what to help
[52:20] God's house get better and while while
[52:23] ministering to God God had special
[52:26] revelations form out of the book aren't
[52:28] you glad we have an open book church is
[52:30] that what you could say brother banget
[52:32] each one of us could say while we were
[52:33] trying to serve God God brought us a new
[52:35] book oh hey man it's a present your
[52:39] Bible should become a brand new book
[52:41] because the opening of the Seventh Seal
[52:43] thing then if that's what I found him in
[52:45] a book was open to me praise God and
[52:48] then i repented of my sins and baptizing
[52:50] Jesus Christ's name Amen and that's what
[52:53] happened here by the grace of the Lord
[52:54] and then he got so stirred up then he
[52:59] went read this entire book to all the
[53:01] people and then he's diverse three and
[53:04] four of her street then he has all the
[53:06] people let's make a covenant let's make
[53:08] a province so I look at I look at you
[53:11] and the IE look at me not and let's all
[53:13] vow to God that we're going to keep the
[53:15] words of this book amen sounds pretty
[53:18] sincere doesn't it remember God said
[53:21] through hold of the prophetess God told
[53:24] Jose I action in verse 19 of chapter 22
[53:28] because thine heart was tender and I was
[53:32] humbled myself before the Lord and the
[53:37] Bible said and hazrath I clothes and
[53:39] went before me i have heard thee saith
[53:42] the lord and that beautiful that's good
[53:44] part of that that what I just wanted to
[53:46] go down here I'm sorry chapter 22 verse
[53:50] 19 in chapter 22 so see the rending of
[53:53] Josiah's clothes was him humbling
[53:56] himself and he just didn't rent his
[53:58] clothes he all fell down and cried about
[54:00] it church we need to sometimes cry about
[54:02] sins that we see since in our lives or
[54:05] sins in lives of others praise the Lord
[54:07] God said I heard you because you humbled
[54:11] yourself you cried before me you let Sid
[54:14] burden you so much that you cried about
[54:16] it and because of that I've heard your
[54:19] prayer amen now in chapter 23 let's
[54:29] start a course for me I could go to
[54:31] verse for your your weekend Joseph I did
[54:38] so stirred up church he gets so sure
[54:40] about this new book this revelation of a
[54:43] brand new book you didn't even know
[54:44] about it he get so stirred up he starts
[54:47] obeying everything that book says and
[54:50] whatever that book says like a childlike
[54:52] childlike faith he just starts doing it
[54:55] amen whatever jesus knows whatever jesus
[54:58] said do it amen whatever the Word of God
[55:01] says I just do it now verse 4 and the
[55:07] king commanded he'll Qaeda high priests
[55:09] in the priests of the second order and
[55:10] the keepers of the door to bring forth
[55:13] out of the temple the Lord all the
[55:14] vessels that were made for bail and for
[55:17] the grove and for all the hosts in
[55:18] heaven and he burned them without
[55:20] Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron and
[55:22] carried the ashes of them unto Bethel so
[55:25] what's he do he gets out all the vessels
[55:27] that were pagan vessels he gets all the
[55:30] bad vessels out of the church what's he
[55:33] doing he's cleaned out the church praise
[55:35] God first five and he put down the
[55:38] idolatrous priests so he takes out the
[55:40] boss creatures in the church he says I'm
[55:44] getting out all their vessels all their
[55:46] other pagan things and get out of those
[55:48] false prophets on the church as well now
[55:54] look at verse 7 look at this and he
[55:56] break down the houses of the sodomites
[55:58] that were by the house of the Lord where
[56:02] the woman won't headings for the grove
[56:05] this church was so back Siddhant they
[56:07] let homosexuals build up houses next to
[56:11] the house Lord and Josiah said i read in
[56:13] the law that that's wrong we're gonna
[56:15] burn down those houses amen look how Sid
[56:18] had buried in città basically moved our
[56:21] marriage at the church and they can't
[56:23] combine one isn't that what's happening
[56:25] right now pretty set by God's grace they
[56:27] are married together I know what
[56:29] happened to the fourth church age but
[56:30] it's even more so now they're marrying
[56:33] church and state pagan state with peg
[56:36] insurance that's exactly what's going on
[56:37] amen but Josiah said that the Bible said
[56:40] that's wrong I'm going to burn down
[56:42] their houses any man I'll break him down
[56:47] burn down wherever I got to do and every
[56:53] one of their holy places i'm just going
[56:55] to start paraphrasing up every one of
[56:57] their holy places he defiled them so he
[57:00] took their holy places into father
[57:02] because they're really unholy right he
[57:05] destroyed every grove every high place
[57:07] he would take their altar
[57:09] the vows that they would stomp on them
[57:11] and make them powder and then take the
[57:13] powder throat in the rivers they just
[57:16] removed everything that exhausts itself
[57:19] against the Word of God they got rid of
[57:21] it he got down to business with God how
[57:23] many want to get down to business with
[57:25] God he didn't this is what if you do
[57:27] what you want your heart and love of
[57:29] Jesus Christ get rid of everything and
[57:32] insulting sup against the Word of God
[57:35] but converse attendant even got rid of
[57:37] the abortion clinics was and he'd
[57:39] evolved tote TOFA which is in the valley
[57:42] of the children of him not that no man
[57:45] might make his son or daughter to pass
[57:47] through the fire tomalak now I'm not
[57:49] advocating burning abortion place that's
[57:51] wrong that's breaking the law but in the
[57:55] Christian but in the Christian round we
[57:57] should pray to keep people out of those
[57:59] abortion clinics amen this is what love
[58:03] for God did he was in love for God he
[58:06] was on fire for God amen now the rest of
[58:14] the chapter he does this he is a
[58:17] housecleaning time it's a church
[58:19] cleaning time he cleans out the entire
[58:21] church now look at verse 20 the last
[58:23] thing he does before the Passover and he
[58:26] stood all the priests of the high places
[58:28] so first he kicked out all the false
[58:30] prophets on the church and then they
[58:32] killed all the priests that were out
[58:35] there in the will of woods and all these
[58:37] little private secret sanctuaries he
[58:40] kill all them what is he doing he's
[58:43] purging sin out of God's land amen he's
[58:49] purging the land of God that he's
[58:51] purging the people of God by the word of
[58:54] the Lord amen look at verse 21 and the
[59:02] King command all the people saying keep
[59:03] the Passover to the Lord your God has
[59:05] written a book of this covenant surely
[59:08] there was not holding such a Passover
[59:10] for the days of the judges that judges
[59:12] real nor in all the days of the kings of
[59:14] Israel nor the kings of Judah when the
[59:18] 18th year of king josiah where this
[59:20] passover is holden to the Lord in
[59:21] Jerusalem
[59:23] now since the days of sin you know give
[59:26] me just a moment here okay Samuel was
[59:30] only get the year real quick because my
[59:32] Bible has dates in the days of Santa was
[59:37] about 10 63 so the bed about 450 years
[59:41] since they had since they had a real
[59:44] good Passover festival praise God now
[59:48] look what happens if you don't have a
[59:49] real good Holy Ghost Festival for a
[59:51] while what happens sin starts coming
[59:53] into the church praise God we don't have
[59:57] a real move of the Holy Ghost here
[59:58] what's going to happen sitting I trying
[1:00:00] to creep his way in we've got to keep
[1:00:02] the Feast of the Lord praise God we've
[1:00:04] got to keep the wood will of God the
[1:00:06] Word of God amen it must be kept by
[1:00:09] somebody amen now notice what was the
[1:00:15] Passover the Passover was remembering
[1:00:18] remember why they get the Passover to
[1:00:20] remember that they were slaves they were
[1:00:23] slaves in Egypt they were slaves to
[1:00:26] idolatry they were slaves to paganism
[1:00:29] and the Passover was to remind them that
[1:00:32] they came out of Egypt they came out of
[1:00:35] the world with a urgency praise God and
[1:00:39] they came out and they came out by the
[1:00:42] blood of the Lamb amen they came out
[1:00:45] that are supposed to be travelers
[1:00:47] they're supposed to be on fire they're
[1:00:49] supposed to be quick to obey the Word of
[1:00:50] God and this is what God is josiah's
[1:00:54] being led of God to do remember where
[1:00:58] you came from you came out of paganism
[1:01:00] look at that they came out of paganism
[1:01:02] and they let Peggy this and move right
[1:01:04] in isn't that exactly what happened to
[1:01:06] America amen she come out of anglican
[1:01:08] russian colada Catholic influence uh
[1:01:11] Edwin left and let that simple influence
[1:01:15] move right back in amen but Josiah said
[1:01:18] I'm cleaning it out hallelujah I'm
[1:01:20] cleaning out the house of God look at
[1:01:25] verse 24 moreover the workers with
[1:01:28] familiar spirits and the Wizards and the
[1:01:30] images and the items and all the
[1:01:32] abominations that were spy the land of
[1:01:33] Judah and Jerusalem did Josiah put away
[1:01:36] that he might perform
[1:01:37] heard the words of the law which were
[1:01:39] written in a book that he'll Qaeda the
[1:01:41] priests found in the house of the Lord
[1:01:44] so Jose I didn't want to talk about the
[1:01:46] message he wanted to live the message
[1:01:48] came n he 111 he wanted to perform I
[1:01:52] will perform I will carry out the word
[1:01:55] of god that's what I'm talking about
[1:01:57] with a church order if brother Graham
[1:01:59] says we should come early to pray and we
[1:02:00] should get into people and we should try
[1:02:02] to get the spirit how many want to
[1:02:04] perform that that's a whole other step
[1:02:06] of consecration with all 44 Beatty and
[1:02:08] baptized in jesus christ aid but whoever
[1:02:11] for those kind of law those kind of
[1:02:12] promises and if you invest in the Holy
[1:02:15] Spirit you'll see more of the spirit of
[1:02:16] a church amen glory I hope you're
[1:02:22] receiving the Word of God tonight now
[1:02:24] verse 25 is what gave me the inspiration
[1:02:26] for this whole message verse 25 and like
[1:02:31] unto him was there no King before him
[1:02:34] that turned to the Lord with what church
[1:02:37] all of his what heart and with all his
[1:02:41] soul and with all his might according to
[1:02:45] all the law of Moses neither after him a
[1:02:48] rooms there any like him in a beautiful
[1:02:54] hallelujah God said God looks out is
[1:02:58] that this is a king who turned with all
[1:03:00] his heart soul mind astray so how does
[1:03:03] that apply to us today we should get rid
[1:03:05] of everything sinful in our lives
[1:03:07] everything and now just talk about it
[1:03:11] but do it as we said if a brother can't
[1:03:14] handle both because of sexual images he
[1:03:16] should get rid of that phony men right
[1:03:19] if sisters can't handle certain apps or
[1:03:22] certain things or certain videos or
[1:03:24] whatever more they should delete those
[1:03:25] praise God get rid of the folder spend
[1:03:28] less time on the computer to everything
[1:03:30] we should do to stay away from sin
[1:03:32] praise God and not just talk about it
[1:03:36] but performant carry it out and watch
[1:03:40] God bless your life amen that's how you
[1:03:43] turn to God with all your heart soul
[1:03:45] mind and strength a church i type in all
[1:03:49] those words and
[1:03:51] is the only person recorded in the Bible
[1:03:53] that's recorded doing this Moses
[1:03:58] commanded Israel there's ten scriptures
[1:04:01] like this that all say heart soul mind
[1:04:02] and strength and love God there's the
[1:04:04] same scriptures like this Moses commands
[1:04:07] it one two three four five times Joshua
[1:04:11] command at one time in Joshua 22 verse 5
[1:04:14] and then jesus said it one two three
[1:04:16] four times but this is the only time at
[1:04:20] the entire Bible that I can find that
[1:04:22] the Bible record somebody is loving God
[1:04:24] with all their heart soul mind and
[1:04:26] strength under the law but it was
[1:04:29] because of a new mysterious book that
[1:04:32] became revealed to them in the house of
[1:04:34] God amen I think at one type of our day
[1:04:37] amen they left Egypt but the world who
[1:04:41] back in but it took somebody with a
[1:04:43] brand-new book and a brand new
[1:04:45] revelation to reinstitute the festival's
[1:04:48] of god the work of God the pleasing
[1:04:50] leadership of God amen go to first
[1:04:53] friendly chapter 5 let's see more about
[1:04:55] this feast but you know here's keeping
[1:04:57] the feast today did you know that you're
[1:04:59] keeping the beasts of the past summer
[1:05:00] how many do that we're keeping the
[1:05:02] spiritual Passover hallelujah first
[1:05:06] witness chapter 5 so my brother bang I
[1:05:11] don't know that book was in the house of
[1:05:12] God I know there was a book like I de
[1:05:15] Valence of God all the guys showed it to
[1:05:17] me in 2001 there's a beautiful boat full
[1:05:21] of mystery full of new revelation if
[1:05:22] it's lagging in the house of God and it
[1:05:24] caused brother Jesse because it is it
[1:05:27] caused a kingdom priest by the name of a
[1:05:28] Jesse spin to clean out his whole life
[1:05:31] and turn to God with all his heart soul
[1:05:33] mind and strength we got any more kings
[1:05:35] and priests out there you could we do
[1:05:37] the same thing we come to the house of
[1:05:39] God hear the word and see these
[1:05:42] revelations declare we make a promise in
[1:05:44] the Covenant and then we go to kicking
[1:05:46] everything out of our lives that doesn't
[1:05:48] agree with this brand new book amen
[1:05:50] ohana here hey man all right what did I
[1:05:56] say what scripture does your heart Lady
[1:05:59] Thank You garden you get extra piece of
[1:06:03] chicken to neck because you remembered
[1:06:05] something special remind me but I give
[1:06:09] all my children whatever i'll give her
[1:06:10] ah thank you Sam got such a good memory
[1:06:15] okay uh go to verse 7 first Guardians 57
[1:06:19] place your hair because i was saying
[1:06:23] you're supposed to keep the Passover tip
[1:06:24] I'm supposed to keep it our Passover
[1:06:27] just isn't in April it's every day of
[1:06:29] the year every day of the year because
[1:06:34] the past summer had what the token of
[1:06:36] the blood which rock types the baptism
[1:06:38] the Holy Ghost but it's oh so it's a
[1:06:40] life you live with the Holy Ghost first
[1:06:42] seven yep first seven purge out
[1:06:50] therefore the old leaven that he may be
[1:06:52] a new lump as you are unleavened now
[1:06:53] what was that lap in church it was a man
[1:06:55] living in sexual sin I remember that
[1:06:57] that was the leaven that got their
[1:06:59] church and nobody the church Lord about
[1:07:01] they weren't even sad about this some
[1:07:02] person in sexual sin Alyssa finished
[1:07:06] first senator for even Christ our
[1:07:08] Passover is sacrificed for us so Paul
[1:07:14] takes us back there sit in your church
[1:07:16] remember though Christ is our Passover
[1:07:18] and what was the Passover all about you
[1:07:20] had to keep all 11 out of the kitchen
[1:07:22] right it goes seven seven days on 11
[1:07:25] bred all these things you got to keep
[1:07:27] all the Levitt out and so Paul said you
[1:07:28] got to keep the spiritual Passover
[1:07:30] there's no leaven in Christ there's no
[1:07:33] sitting Christ Jesus keep the church
[1:07:35] cleaning that's what gifts are supposed
[1:07:36] to be for amen cost preaching and so for
[1:07:39] her sake therefore let us keep the feast
[1:07:43] that was all heaven neither with the
[1:07:47] leaven of malice and wickedness but with
[1:07:49] the unleavened bread of sincerity and
[1:07:52] truth and the church said amen so when
[1:07:55] we're born again we must keep the church
[1:07:57] free from sin free from 11 and then we
[1:08:00] must keep it with sincerity and truth we
[1:08:03] must be sincere when we come to the
[1:08:05] house of God we must know the truth when
[1:08:07] we come to the house of God is it right
[1:08:09] to this is it wrong to do that let's
[1:08:10] live godly lives let's keep the feast
[1:08:12] like Josiah did a man and God will honor
[1:08:15] our church even for a man
[1:08:18] that's beautiful and to me that just
[1:08:19] beat let's I just done all just fit tied
[1:08:22] together with the new tests and i think
[1:08:23] that's that's just beautiful and let me
[1:08:27] show you another one acts 739 i preached
[1:08:29] just a few months ago I don't remember
[1:08:30] when this should add more to it x 7 39
[1:08:34] now so this is that this is the opposite
[1:08:41] of what we should do so this is this is
[1:08:43] the side of backsliders okay somebody
[1:08:45] just show them scared good mankind so
[1:08:48] whom our fathers would not obey but
[1:08:49] thrust him from them and their hearts
[1:08:52] turn back again into Egypt so see when
[1:08:56] people won't obey the Holy Spirit they
[1:08:59] turned back to sin right cuz you can't
[1:09:01] serve cancer both masters points41
[1:09:03] master you're being led by somebody when
[1:09:06] people turn down the Holy Spirit and
[1:09:08] that the word says this if the Bible
[1:09:10] says is if the Holy Spirit is preaching
[1:09:11] this and they turn it down and the
[1:09:13] violence in their hearts turn back into
[1:09:15] a life of sin a life of lukewarmness can
[1:09:18] say hey verse 14 okay here's what they
[1:09:21] did say unto Aaron make us God's to go
[1:09:23] before us as for this Moses which
[1:09:26] brought us out of the land to Egypt we
[1:09:28] know not what's becoming is that what
[1:09:29] they doin brother Graham where's brother
[1:09:30] bran where's the god brother bran oh
[1:09:32] he's not here anymore let's just go back

[1:09:36] saying where is this visa I the Prophet
[1:09:38] where is he right versus teaching this
[1:09:40] all lies all these things like that let
[1:09:42] us go back into the world and so that's
[1:09:44] a hard that's backslidden I showed you a
[1:09:47] heart that's turned Josiah Josiah turn
[1:09:50] with all his heart kept every promise of
[1:09:52] God clean got everything in his house in
[1:09:54] the church he not the whole country
[1:09:56] ahead God said he turned with all his
[1:09:58] heart but Israel turned back in their
[1:10:01] hearts sort of simple life and they
[1:10:03] called their old gods won't remember
[1:10:04] this God for future I've never this
[1:10:06] thing I used to the world let's go do
[1:10:08] that again that'd be really fun and that
[1:10:10] was turning back to the world but our
[1:10:13] hearts are not supposed to turn back to
[1:10:15] the each of our hearts supposed to turn
[1:10:16] back to the faith of the fathers amen

[1:10:31] that's such a beautiful scripture name
[1:10:39] okay Malachi 4 5 & 6 Val kind of 45 the
[1:10:54] old I was sent you Elijah the Prophet
[1:10:56] before the coming of the Great and
[1:10:57] dreadful day of the Lord and he shall
[1:11:01] turn the heart of the father's to the
[1:11:02] children and the heart of the children
[1:11:06] to their fathers lest I come and smite
[1:11:10] the earth with the curse praise the Lord
[1:11:14] now let me read you a few things brother
[1:11:17] have said about this so you can
[1:11:19] understand it I got one right here I
[1:11:24] want to read to you here by God's grace
[1:11:35] he says this is the voice to sign 1964
[1:11:38] but in Malachi 4 he said just before the
[1:11:42] great and terrible day of the Lord shall
[1:11:43] come when the whole earth will burn like
[1:11:45] an oven and the righteous shall walk
[1:11:47] among the ashes of the wicked that's the
[1:11:50] Millennium I'll send a lie to the
[1:11:51] prophet and what will he do he will
[1:11:54] restore the faith of the children back
[1:11:55] to the Apostolic fathers back to the
[1:11:58] word he'll have to be a prophet I'll
[1:12:00] send him he'll be thoroughly identified
[1:12:02] his nature will be the same as the
[1:12:04] lodges was exactly his message will be
[1:12:06] right on that line he'll condemn and
[1:12:08] tear down no fellowship no cooperation
[1:12:10] no nothing but he'll have not save the
[1:12:13] Lord amen alleluia hope you saw that by
[1:12:19] God's grace let me show you another one
[1:12:23] here by the grace of the Lord our
[1:12:33] romance is this program says I deny upon
[1:12:37] the infallible evidence of the word that
[1:12:39] there is more than one major profit
[1:12:41] messenger who reveal the mysteries has
[1:12:43] contained in the word but Lauren I were
[1:12:45] just talking about that where we'd
[1:12:46] better at lunch I forgot about that
[1:12:47] brother Graham said there there will not
[1:12:50] be another prophet messenger with any
[1:12:51] mysteries he says only the seventh
[1:12:54] church a messenger and there's only one
[1:12:58] he says who has the ministry to turn the
[1:13:00] heart of the children to the father's he
[1:13:03] says thus saith the lord by his
[1:13:06] unfailing word stands and shouts can and
[1:13:08] be vindicated there's one prophet master
[1:13:12] to this age all right I want you to see
[1:13:15] that by the grace of the Lord okay well
[1:13:24] Gramps others
[1:13:24] that are imprisoned out there must be
[1:13:26] someone rise up that's got to come
[1:13:28] aboard thus at the Lord Malachi the
[1:13:30] fourth chapter that's exactly what he
[1:13:31] said would be the sign just before the
[1:13:33] coming of the Great and dreadful or
[1:13:35] terrible day of the Lord i'll send you
[1:13:36] elijah and what will he do turn the
[1:13:39] hearts of the children back to the
[1:13:40] doctrine of the father's back to the
[1:13:42] Bible out of these denominational
[1:13:45] difference and come back to the Bible
[1:13:46] back to god that's what he would do
[1:13:48] notice what a great time that we're
[1:13:51] living in amen praise the Lord all right

[1:16:37] didn't have time to research this but I
[1:16:40] know their scriptures in the book of
[1:16:41] solemn where david said i love the mall
[1:16:43] they even love the law now most people
[1:16:46] think your law was a harsh statement
[1:16:48] they even knew it was God's command so
[1:16:50] he loved it even under law even under of
[1:16:54] our unity anyway he could never keep it
[1:16:55] you can never be born again but yet he
[1:16:58] still loved the law of God because he
[1:17:00] loved God and God has his word and see
[1:17:04] at church I think it Roger ourselves I
[1:17:06] see in children all the time don't
[1:17:08] children love routine as a parent seen
[1:17:10] that they love to know what's going to
[1:17:12] happen next don't that I teach you the
[1:17:15] last 13 years I taught him they love
[1:17:17] routine they love they love consistency
[1:17:20] they love to know what's going to happen
[1:17:21] next and that's what the law was the law
[1:17:23] was just rules and you know what's going
[1:17:25] to happen you know what to expect you
[1:17:27] understand I'm trying to say that God's
[1:17:30] law is a blessing God's law was a
[1:17:33] blessing in the Old Testament as it was
[1:17:36] in the New Testament amen but now we
[1:17:37] have the law of the what the spirit now
[1:17:39] the spirit gives us a lot the spirit
[1:17:42] gives us the commands of God Almighty
[1:17:44] that we must work with I just want you
[1:17:47] to know that even the Old Testament
[1:17:48] people love the law people love
[1:17:50] Noah please God and what made God angry
[1:17:53] because they wanted to love God they
[1:17:55] wanted to show God they wanted to serve
[1:17:57] him with all their heart soul mind and
[1:17:58] strength because remember that was the
[1:18:00] command of God in the beginning let's
[1:18:02] close as we read that Deuteronomy 6
[1:18:04] first for me around me 6 verse for the
[1:18:09] member get ready Drago I already knocked
[1:18:11] at home while ago this is moses a
[1:18:14] reversing the story of Israel back to
[1:18:17] Israel before he died he's going over
[1:18:19] the law second time that's where you get
[1:18:21] Deuteronomy the two logs from he's going
[1:18:23] over it again and he hearses all that
[1:18:27] god had did for them Deuteronomy 6 verse
[1:18:31] 1 now these are the commandments the
[1:18:35] statutes and the judgments which the
[1:18:37] Lord your God commanded to teach you now
[1:18:40] you might do them in the land where are
[1:18:41] you going to possess it that thou
[1:18:44] mightest fear the Lord God to keep all
[1:18:45] the statutes and his commandments which
[1:18:47] I command thee thou and thy son and my
[1:18:50] son son all the days of my life that
[1:18:52] nine days maybe prolong not even want
[1:18:55] instead i'm going to give you lower life
[1:18:56] if you just keep the commands praise god
[1:19:00] verse 3 here therefore o Israel absurd
[1:19:03] to do it that it may be well with thee
[1:19:05] we want to wet we want to like to be
[1:19:07] well right amen and that he may increase
[1:19:11] my tally as the Lord God about your
[1:19:14] fathers had promised thee in the land it
[1:19:16] flows with milk and honey hear o Israel
[1:19:19] the Lord our God is one Lord and thou
[1:19:23] shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy
[1:19:25] heart with all thy soul and with all thy
[1:19:28] might and these words which I command
[1:19:31] thee this day shall be in thine heart
[1:19:33] and thou shalt teach them diligently
[1:19:35] unto thy children and shall talk of them
[1:19:37] without citizen night house and when
[1:19:39] that walkest by the way we're now lies
[1:19:41] down and when now rises up now the rest
[1:19:45] of the chapter he deals with how you
[1:19:47] must keep all these commands talk them
[1:19:49] in your home and if you keep these
[1:19:52] commands you'll cast out verse 19 to

[1:19:59] how you get victory I was hoping you

[1:20:20] itself again it's the plan of God this
[1:20:23] is the promise from God the number 23
