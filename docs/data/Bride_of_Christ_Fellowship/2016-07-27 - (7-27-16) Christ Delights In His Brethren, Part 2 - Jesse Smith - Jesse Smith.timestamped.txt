[52:02] thoughts let's go to first I'm sorry
[52:05] Samuel I'm sorry not Samuel Psalms 149
[52:09] pardon me Psalms
[52:15] 149 Christ Delights in his Brethren i'
[52:17] like to continue on that thought for a
[52:19] little bit by God's
[52:20] grace I started out this week trying to
[52:23] study different things but I just kept
[52:24] coming back to that so well inspired by
[52:37] that just think what kind of a life we
[52:39] live if we knew every day how much
[52:41] Christ loved us praise God you didn't
[52:43] see God as a like a maybe a mean old
[52:46] kind landlord or something like that
[52:48] didn't see him as a uh you know someone
[52:51] to torment us or a slave driver but we
[52:53] just saw him with as a loving father
[52:56] like the scripture says he he is what
[52:59] kind of a walk could we have with the
[53:00] Lord amen I believe he's revealing us uh
[53:04] those things to us and helping us to
[53:06] walk that way praise God he's really
[53:08] helped me a lot you know show me the
[53:09] word and show me about legalism and
[53:11] things and how legalism is something
[53:13] excessive outside the word but just
[53:15] keeping the word itself that's love and
[53:18] so I'm seeing him in a greater way
[53:19] praise God very thankful for that Psalms
[53:22] 149 verse4 we'll just read verse four
[53:25] because I want to let's get right to the
[53:27] scripture here I won't be dealing much
[53:29] with this chapter I think we spend a
[53:30] little bit time on that on Sunday
[53:33] night look at verse four let's read it
[53:36] together if we can ready one two three
[53:39] for the lord taketh pleasure in his
[53:41] people he will beautify the meek with
[53:44] salvation praise God let's have a word
[53:46] of prayer let's by our heads have a need
[53:48] on your heart just make it known un the
[53:49] Lord by raising your hand let's pray
[53:51] Heavenly Father we love you tonight
[53:52] thank you for your mercy and Grace Lord
[53:54] we're happy to be in your house Lord
[53:56] speak to us through Thy word though the
[53:58] way be thorny we'll Praise You Lord God
[54:00] Great Is Thy Faithfulness Lord thank you
[54:02] that we have the Holy Ghost keeping us
[54:04] alive in this hour Lord what a blessing
[54:06] thank you for your constant
[54:07] encouragement dear God and thank you
[54:09] that you take pleasure in your people
[54:12] you take pleasure in this Worship in
[54:14] this service tonight to the world no
[54:15] doubt it looks small maybe kind of quiet
[54:18] it maybe not uh something flashy maybe
[54:21] not up to dat we'd say in technology or
[54:25] or not Popular by any means Lord but
[54:28] Lord if we are worshiping you in you in
[54:31] spirit and in truth then truly you
[54:33] Delight in this Fellowship here tonight
[54:35] truly you Delight amongst us Lord God
[54:37] and you love us Lord one thing's for
[54:39] sure Lord as well we love you back you
[54:42] want to love you back the way you love
[54:43] us Lord help us Lord to see as a loving
[54:46] father as a husband as a friend as a
[54:49] brother Lord God help us to see that way
[54:51] as the scripture teaches in Jesus
[54:53] Christ's name the church said it amen
[54:56] God bless being see there praise
[55:01] God I guess I'll use the mic here by so
[55:05] I want to just quickly review a little
[55:06] bit on Sunday night we talked about how
[55:08] God takes pleasure in his people praise
[55:11] God Christ Delights in his brother uh we
[55:14] looked at how
[55:15] God takes pleasure in his
[55:18] people and we looked at how the Lord
[55:21] takes pleasure in them that fear Him
[55:22] remember in Psalms
[55:24] 147:10 so anyone that fears God God is
[55:28] very pleased with
[55:29] that uh the Bible says I was reading out
[55:33] of Proverbs 8 on Sunday night and the
[55:34] Bible says the fear of the Lord is to
[55:37] hate evil so when you see churches or
[55:40] anything or any message or not when you
[55:42] see any church that doesn't hate sin
[55:45] they're in some trouble they're in a
[55:46] backsliding condition they're in a it's
[55:48] an awful condition in a place where you
[55:51] don't hate sin anymore you don't hate
[55:53] evil uh sin should burden us sin should
[55:55] be hard sin should be hard to live with
[55:58] right there should be guilt we should be
[55:59] guilty if if in our hearts if we've made
[56:02] a mistake if we've sinned against the
[56:04] Lord the fear of God is to hate evil and
[56:07] God loves those who fear Him and then
[56:10] the Bible said I love them that love
[56:12] love
[56:13] me so so no doubt you know God the B the
[56:17] Bible say God has a love God so Lov the
[56:18] world he has a type of love and care for
[56:20] everything but he has a special kind of
[56:23] love for the elect or his Chosen and
[56:26] we'll get into that here
[56:27] tonight by the grace of the Lord God
[56:30] loves to be worshiped so much that he
[56:32] comes and dwells in the worship like
[56:34] tonight he comes and dwells in our
[56:35] Psalms that we sing he loves that he
[56:37] loves to be a part of that and then we
[56:39] showed how Christ rejoices over those
[56:41] who can receive the word the revelations
[56:43] that's in Luke 10 Jesus wept over his
[56:45] Earthly friend Lazarus uh he loved the
[56:48] Rich Young Ruler uh he loved to take
[56:51] children up in his arms and pray for
[56:52] them and bless them and hold them he
[56:54] loved those things we saw how God's love
[56:56] is greater than mother love so much so
[56:58] that he a mother might forget about
[57:00] their child a father might forget about
[57:02] his child but God will never forget
[57:03] about us because he wrote us on the
[57:05] palms of his hands praise God the cross
[57:08] speaking of the Cross and the cross
[57:10] proves he'll never leave us or forsake
[57:12] us because he died for us amen but then
[57:16] we uh spent most of our time on how the
[57:18] love of God if God loves you he's going
[57:19] to correct you brother B said not
[57:22] sometimes every time every time he's
[57:24] going to correct those he loves and that
[57:27] proves God loves us amen when he
[57:29] corrects us and we saw God expresses and
[57:32] tries to show us his love by giving us a
[57:34] type or an allegory of wedding so
[57:37] wedding shows us uh how how pure God's
[57:40] love
[57:41] is praise the Lord so uh we see a
[57:44] wedding will teach us that and Jesus
[57:46] gave The Parables of a wedding you know
[57:49] of having your lamps trimmed ready for
[57:50] the marriage and so forth and having to
[57:53] go out and have enough oil to go out and
[57:56] get in the wedding procession the other
[57:58] illustration Jesus gave was of having a
[58:00] wedding garment on you must have the
[58:02] right garment on you must be clothed uh
[58:04] with a spotless white wedding uh garment
[58:07] and then you're ready for the wedding
[58:09] praise God you must be clothed you must
[58:11] be have a special invitation you must be
[58:14] invited to come Hallelujah you've been
[58:16] invited here tonight amen to come and
[58:18] rejoice and worship and prepare for the
[58:20] marriage of the bridegroom Amen in
[58:24] Zephaniah 3 we saw in verse 17
[58:26] how the Bible said he'll Rejoice over
[58:29] thee with joy he will rest in his love
[58:32] he will Joy over thee with singing so
[58:34] God has the Angels Sing we know the
[58:36] Bible said they Rejoice whenever a
[58:37] sinner repents right the Angels Sing
[58:40] when we rejoice and no doubt Jesus loves
[58:43] our
[58:44] worship the Bible said in John 131 that
[58:47] Jesus loved his own to the very end
[58:50] praise
[58:51] God uh and if he loved his own disciples
[58:54] to the end if he's the same yesterday
[58:56] today and forever he has to love us to
[58:58] the end Proverbs 158 says the prayer of
[59:01] the upright is his
[59:03] delight and so what a blessing that is
[59:06] God Delights in our prayers here tonight
[59:08] amen he loves to hear us pray that's why
[59:10] even after service when we sing songs
[59:11] it's it's not a time to mentally check
[59:13] out say okay the preaching's done now I
[59:15] can just check out and you're ready to
[59:16] go it should be a time to pray and talk
[59:19] to him and apply what we've heard what
[59:22] have we heard uh the Lord spoke to me
[59:23] here the Lord spoke to me there now
[59:25] let's pray and make it right let's pray
[59:27] and worship him let's pray and thank him
[59:29] for what he's done what he's spoken to
[59:30] our lives because he Delights in that
[59:33] the prayer of the upright praise God I
[59:36] didn't have time to go through this like
[59:38] I like to but um I like to look at that
[59:41] here tonight let's go to Hebrews 2 let's
[59:43] go through these because we didn't have
[59:44] time I just mentioned them on Sunday
[59:46] night before communion when we prayed
[59:48] Hebrews 2 verse 9 let's go to Hebrews 2
[59:51] ver9
[59:57] but we see Jesus who is made a little
[59:59] lower than the angels for the suffering
[1:00:02] of death crowned with Glory and Honor
[1:00:04] that he might by the grace of God I'm
[1:00:06] sorry that he by the grace of God should
[1:00:08] taste death for every
[1:00:10] man for it became him who are all things
[1:00:14] and by whom are all things in bringing
[1:00:16] many sons unto glory to make the captain
[1:00:19] of their salvation perfect through
[1:00:22] sufferings how did Jesus get perfect
[1:00:25] through sufferings
[1:00:26] the things he suffered so if we want to
[1:00:28] be perfect if we want to be a complete
[1:00:29] Christian we have to go through
[1:00:31] sufferings as well and notice he tastes
[1:00:33] death for you which means this death is
[1:00:36] the death of course after you die
[1:00:38] physically but the death that separates
[1:00:40] you from God as far as the death that
[1:00:41] takes you uh to Hell we'd say or the
[1:00:44] grave it's also called the prison house
[1:00:46] right where all the lost souls go while
[1:00:48] they await judgment Jesus went to hell
[1:00:51] the Bible said right this is the death
[1:00:53] we talking about he tasted that he went
[1:00:55] to hell so we didn't have to that's love
[1:00:58] amen that's love he did the hard thing
[1:01:00] he did the awful thing he did the
[1:01:01] separation from God that we didn't have
[1:01:03] to amen so that's what that death is
[1:01:06] speaking of because because we know Paul
[1:01:08] died you know brother Randon died John
[1:01:10] died all the Matthew all the saints down
[1:01:13] Through the Ages you know polycarp and
[1:01:15] different ones down Through the Ages but
[1:01:17] he he tasted the death of going to hell
[1:01:20] and going uh uh amongst the souls that
[1:01:22] were lost the souls in prison he went to
[1:01:26] them and went that far thank God we
[1:01:28] don't have to go that far amen the blood
[1:01:30] of Jesus Christ cleanses us from all
[1:01:32] unrighteousness verse 11 for both he
[1:01:35] that
[1:01:36] Sanctified and they who are Sanctified
[1:01:38] are all of One amen for which cause he
[1:01:42] is not ashamed to call them Brethren so
[1:01:46] I just want to stop there that's what we
[1:01:47] ended on Sunday night because you let
[1:01:49] God sanctify your life and purify your
[1:01:52] life he can call you his Brethren he can
[1:01:55] call you
[1:01:56] uh he's my child she's my child she's my
[1:01:59] daughter uh and she he's not ashamed to
[1:02:01] do that amen kind like think about if
[1:02:04] you wash dishes or think about if you
[1:02:05] build something build something really
[1:02:07] nice when you get done with all those
[1:02:09] shiny dishes you're not ashamed to use
[1:02:10] them anymore are you my they're all
[1:02:13] cleaned out everything's nice or you
[1:02:14] build something my look oh it's all buil
[1:02:17] or like this room we painted this room
[1:02:18] cleaned out it was awful mess beforehand
[1:02:20] it was awfully dirty awfully uh just
[1:02:23] spiderwebs all over the place just aw
[1:02:26] place but when you're get done with it
[1:02:27] and it's all cleaned up and it's all
[1:02:29] shiny and it's it looks nice then you're
[1:02:31] not ashamed to be here are
[1:02:33] you right that's how Christ is the one
[1:02:36] who sanctifies and the ones that are
[1:02:38] Sanctified are one praise God they're
[1:02:40] one because they work together uh by
[1:02:44] God's grace so he's not ashamed to call
[1:02:46] them Brethren praise God saying verse 12
[1:02:49] saying I'll declare my I'm sorry I'll
[1:02:52] declare thy name unto my brethren in the
[1:02:56] midst of the church will I sing praise
[1:02:58] unto thee that's what Christ speaking of
[1:03:00] Christ that's a uh that's a prophecy
[1:03:03] from The Book of Psalms I believe
[1:03:05] chapter 22 if I'm not mistaken David
[1:03:07] wrote this uh and said in the midst of
[1:03:09] my brethren I will praise thee I'll
[1:03:11] declare thy name unto my brethren that
[1:03:13] was speaking of Christ Christ declared
[1:03:15] the name of God unto his Brethren unto
[1:03:18] the disciples unto the Believers praise
[1:03:21] God and so he's not ashamed to call them
[1:03:23] Brethren amen
[1:03:26] all right now let's uh let's keep going
[1:03:29] down I want to skip a few verses but
[1:03:30] let's go down to verse 14 for as much
[1:03:32] then as the children are partakers of
[1:03:33] Flesh and Blood he also himself likewise
[1:03:36] took part of the
[1:03:38] same that through death he might destroy
[1:03:41] him that had the power of death that is
[1:03:44] the devil now we looked at that I think
[1:03:46] over Easter too and showed how what
[1:03:49] Christ destroyed was this was Satan's
[1:03:51] influence on you that is what's
[1:03:53] destroyed right because he conquered
[1:03:56] death Hell In The Grave Satan cannot
[1:03:59] have any influence on US unless we allow
[1:04:01] it is that
[1:04:02] right but that's what he did the Bible
[1:04:04] said it's destroyed it's a past tense he
[1:04:07] already destroyed Satan right he
[1:04:09] destroyed Satan's influence Upon Our
[1:04:12] Lives praise God that's what he
[1:04:14] destroyed now if we if we uh Harbor evil
[1:04:17] thoughts if we Harbor lustful thoughts
[1:04:19] if we live the wrong way if we neglect
[1:04:22] the word of God if we neglect it yeah
[1:04:24] then we let Satan's influence back in
[1:04:26] but Jesus has destroyed that and if we
[1:04:28] hold the power of the blood if we hold
[1:04:30] the holy spirit in our thoughts and our
[1:04:32] heart and our minds it drives away
[1:04:34] Devils it drives away evil does it not
[1:04:37] it drives it away right out of your
[1:04:38] presence amen and that's what he
[1:04:41] destroyed he destroyed his influence
[1:04:42] Satan's influence on the life of a
[1:04:44] Christian praise God now let's go back
[1:04:48] to Hebrews 11 here let's go
[1:04:51] here Hebrews 11:13 let's read this one
[1:04:54] here so there's two places in scripture
[1:04:57] where the Bible said he's not ashamed to
[1:04:59] call us uh

[1:07:40] let's say I'm seeking a country ready
[1:07:42] I'm seeking a country whose Builder
[1:07:44] makers God ready whose Builder makers
[1:07:47] God that's what these men and women did

[1:07:55] here so much I like to serve God I love
[1:07:58] the people of God I love the ways of God
[1:08:00] but this Earth this Earthly Cosmos this
[1:08:03] Earthly system with Republican and
[1:08:05] Democrat and or dictator nationalism or
[1:08:08] or republicanism or whatever more
[1:08:10] Republic uh demo Dem democracy this
[1:08:13] world system is not our home amen but
[1:08:16] there's coming a Heavenly system
[1:08:18] Hallelujah that's coming to this earth
[1:08:20] amen and that's our home but this
[1:08:22] Earthly system is not our home we're
[1:08:24] pilgrims seeking for a city that is to
[1:08:28] come verse 15 and truly if they had been
[1:08:31] mindful of that country from when they
[1:08:33] came out they might have opportunity to
[1:08:35] return now look they weren't mindful
[1:08:38] Abraham wasn't mindful of going back to
[1:08:40] Shan he didn't want to go back to Shina
[1:08:43] Moses didn't want to go back to Egypt
[1:08:45] praise God we do not want to go back to
[1:08:48] denominationalism right or worldliness
[1:08:50] right we don't want to go back there
[1:08:52] that's what they were like they were not
[1:08:55] mindful so we can't let our mind think
[1:08:57] about the days of the past of our
[1:08:59] worldly life or of our denominational
[1:09:02] life we can't let our mind rest on those
[1:09:04] things we got to let our mind look
[1:09:06] forward to the city whose Builder maker
[1:09:08] God right set our affections on things
[1:09:11] above
[1:09:12] amen see they might have returned had
[1:09:15] they kept their mind on that but they
[1:09:16] weren't mindful of
[1:09:18] that verse 16 but now they desire a
[1:09:21] better country that is a Heavenly
[1:09:23] country would you like to live in a
[1:09:24] Heavenly country where Jesus is the
[1:09:27] king oh my where he makes the rules and
[1:09:30] he's got a rod of iron right to lay down
[1:09:32] the law i' like to live that amen how do
[1:09:35] I know I like to live that because I'm
[1:09:36] living the way that way right now I'm
[1:09:38] living on this earth like he's already
[1:09:40] here praise God now he is here by the
[1:09:42] Holy Spirit I'm talking about the
[1:09:43] Corporal body we're living now like his
[1:09:46] Corporal body is already here amen which
[1:09:49] means we're living according to his laws
[1:09:52] Hallelujah now let's finish verse 16
[1:09:54] wherefore
[1:09:57] God is not ashamed to be called their
[1:09:59] God so because you're Desiring a
[1:10:02] Heavenly country because you're not
[1:10:04] mindful of your old life you used to
[1:10:05] live in sin and denominationalism all
[1:10:08] these things like that because of that
[1:10:10] now God's not ashamed to be your God you
[1:10:13] see you have to our lives must match
[1:10:15] Abraham and Isaac uh and Enoch and Noah
[1:10:19] and Sarah Our Lives just match theirs we
[1:10:22] must do the same thing they did forsake
[1:10:24] all the worldly things and live for a
[1:10:26] country that is to come amen for he has
[1:10:29] prep prepared for them a city amen he's
[1:10:32] preparing us a city now he said
[1:10:35] Hallelujah
[1:10:38] now let's if we can let's look at uh I
[1:10:40] didn't get to go over that so I want to
[1:10:42] make sure I go over that so you saw that
[1:10:45] uh God here uh is not ashamed to call us
[1:10:49] Brethren now let's look at a few
[1:10:51] scriptures here uh let's go to Mark 8:38
[1:10:54] let's read that Mark 8
[1:11:12] 38 now this is right after Peter tells
[1:11:15] Jesus no you don't have to go to the
[1:11:16] cross and Jesus says get me behind
[1:11:18] behind me
[1:11:19] Satan now he talks about whoever will
[1:11:21] save his life must lose it but in verse
[1:11:23] 38 whosoever therefore shall be ashamed
[1:11:25] of me and my words in this adulterous
[1:11:28] and sinful generation of him also shall
[1:11:30] the son of man be ashamed when he cometh
[1:11:33] in the glory of his father with the Holy
[1:11:37] Angels
[1:11:38] amen hallelujah praise
[1:11:41] God see if we're ashamed here he'll be
[1:11:44] ashamed of us there but if we're not
[1:11:46] ashamed here he's not ashamed to call us
[1:11:48] Brethren praise God so it is our faith
[1:11:51] it is our life it is our choices and
[1:11:54] decisions that will get to I want to
[1:11:55] look at that in a little bit that prove
[1:11:57] that we love him and we know he loves us
[1:11:59] because he said so praise God now let's
[1:12:02] look at this quot I want look at this
[1:12:03] quote again I read this a few weeks ago
[1:12:06] adoption
[1:12:07] 1960 when did God choose us brother says
[1:12:10] when did God choose you that's got the
[1:12:11] Holy Ghost when did God choose you
[1:12:14] before the foundation of the world by
[1:12:16] his forign knowledge he foresaw you and
[1:12:19] know that you would love him amen now
[1:12:24] remember God gives us free more agency
[1:12:26] so God does not want to force anybody to
[1:12:29] love him and God will not force anybody
[1:12:31] to love him he wants people that will
[1:12:33] just choose to love him praise God so
[1:12:36] God the Bible said brother man said you
[1:12:38] know uh predestination looks back to
[1:12:40] forign knowledge for I looks back to
[1:12:42] Destiny and so for like that so God
[1:12:44] before the foundation of the world knew
[1:12:46] everything that would be knew all the
[1:12:48] people that would come upon the Earth
[1:12:49] and he knew which ones would love him so
[1:12:52] because of that for knowledge the Bible
[1:12:54] said he could pred predestinate so
[1:12:55] predestination looks back to forn
[1:12:57] knowledge right because he forew what
[1:13:00] you would choose he could predetermine
[1:13:03] what's going to happen in all of our
[1:13:04] Lives praise God that's right so see
[1:13:07] predestination looks back to for
[1:13:09] knowledge praise
[1:13:10] God and because he forew you he know
[1:13:15] that you would love him and before there
[1:13:17] was a foundational world he chose you
[1:13:19] and sent Jesus that he might be the
[1:13:21] propit of your sins to call you to
[1:13:24] reconcile ilation to himself to love oh
[1:13:28] he said wish we just had a few more
[1:13:30] minutes time we got a few minutes here
[1:13:31] tonight by God's grace Hallelujah so
[1:13:35] look the reason he he he uh he the
[1:13:39] reason he predestinated your life was
[1:13:41] because he knew you would love him now
[1:13:43] that's scripture as well so let's read 2
[1:13:44] Thessalonians 2:13 let's read that 2
[1:13:47] Thessalonians
[1:13:53] 21:13 and I remember reading this the
[1:13:56] first time with brother Simon I remember
[1:13:57] Simon showing me this in scripture I I
[1:14:00] just thought I never knew such glorious
[1:14:02] things I never knew the Bible said these
[1:14:04] things these things are precious amen as
[1:14:08] far as being saved before the or chosen
[1:14:10] before the foundational World your name
[1:14:11] was in the book of life before the
[1:14:13] foundation of the world you're chosen in
[1:14:15] Christ all these things I never knew
[1:14:16] these things as a Christian I went to
[1:14:18] church what two or three years you know
[1:14:19] trying to serve God before these things
[1:14:21] and just to see that the Bible says this
[1:14:23] what a what a what a rejoicing this is
[1:14:26] what a a privilege this is for us amen
[1:14:29] verse 13 to know that this is God's for
[1:14:32] know verse 13 but we are bound to give
[1:14:35] thanks all to God for you Brethren
[1:14:39] beloved of the Lord because God had from
[1:14:42] the beginning chosen you when did he
[1:14:46] choose you from the beginning to
[1:14:48] Salvation he chose you to be saved
[1:14:51] amen through what sanctification of the
[1:14:54] spirit and and belief of the truth
[1:14:57] hallelujah so by those two things he
[1:14:59] said that he chosen you before the
[1:15:01] foundation of the world he foresaw that
[1:15:04] he that we would let uh God sanctify us
[1:15:07] and he foresaw that you would believe
[1:15:09] the truth you wouldn't just go to any
[1:15:11] church or you wouldn't just go to any
[1:15:12] place or you just wouldn't believe just
[1:15:14] any old wies tale or any old Papa's tale
[1:15:17] or whatever more but you would want the
[1:15:19] absolute truth and Jesus said Thy word
[1:15:21] is truth amen now I want to look I want
[1:15:24] to look at this I want to kind of turn a
[1:15:25] corner here let's go to Deuteronomy 7
[1:15:30] here because last night Mal I at
[1:15:33] practice and the master you know he goes
[1:15:36] to church and don't over like that he
[1:15:37] looked around he said all the adults he
[1:15:39] said what's the very purpose of life and
[1:15:42] the first woman spoke up and said she
[1:15:43] said uh self-confidence being
[1:15:45] self-confident is the purpose of life be
[1:15:47] confident in
[1:15:48] yourself and I looked at another woman
[1:15:51] and the woman
[1:15:52] said she said oh to help others right
[1:15:55] Mal to serve others that's what this
[1:15:57] these two women said he looked at me and
[1:15:59] said Mr Smith what's the purpose of life
[1:16:02] I said to love God and keep his
[1:16:05] commands I thought my yeah that's
[1:16:07] exactly right and then they go on and
[1:16:10] and he even agreed with me later he said
[1:16:11] now Mr Smith he said he said Mr Smith
[1:16:13] was chosen he said we weren't all chosen
[1:16:15] to do what he was called to
[1:16:17] do remember that said that he said not
[1:16:20] everybody was chosen to do what he's
[1:16:21] called to do I thought my what a
[1:16:23] wonderful opportunity just to share with
[1:16:25] 10 or 11 people there that there is a
[1:16:28] purpose on this Earth and it's to love
[1:16:29] God love him love him right love him and
[1:16:33] keep his Commandments and Jesus said
[1:16:35] they said what's the greatest
[1:16:36] commandment to love the Lord your God to
[1:16:38] love him love with all your heart soul
[1:16:41] mind strength and body right like Jesus
[1:16:43] said that's the whole purpose of man and
[1:16:46] uh Solomon repeats at the end of
[1:16:47] Ecclesiastes they said the the whole end
[1:16:49] of man the whole duty of man is to fear
[1:16:51] God and keep his commands praise God but
[1:16:55] that's what this chapter is about
[1:16:56] Deuteronomy 7 is such a beautiful
[1:16:58] chapter I read the whole chapter today
[1:17:00] it's such a glorious chapter we'll just
[1:17:01] have to hit the highlights
[1:17:04] okay but God is telling them what they
[1:17:07] need to do once they get to the promised
[1:17:09] land and they kick out all these uh
[1:17:12] aliens we'd say in verse one it goes
[1:17:13] through all the aliens and in verse two
[1:17:16] it says don't deliver any of them kill
[1:17:18] every one of
[1:17:20] them uh verse three said don't make
[1:17:22] marriages with them
[1:17:25] verse four says uh if you do they'll
[1:17:27] turn your hearts away from serving God
[1:17:28] that's what happened to Solomon later on
[1:17:30] right it was kind of prophetic of
[1:17:32] that
[1:17:34] um and then in verse five it says
[1:17:36] destroy all their altars break down
[1:17:39] their images cut down their Groves and
[1:17:40] burn their grav and images with fire
[1:17:43] look at verse six verse six is where I
[1:17:45] want to pick up because we're talking
[1:17:46] about Christ the lights in US Christ
[1:17:48] Delights in
[1:17:50] US Christ could not Delight in the
[1:17:53] hivites right or the jebusites he could
[1:17:56] not Delight them because they wouldn't
[1:17:57] keep his word they wouldn't let his
[1:18:00] Spirit or his nature or his will be done
[1:18:03] and god is perfect and infinite so if
[1:18:06] God ever had a will it would be the best
[1:18:08] way right it would be the best thing but
[1:18:10] these return it down that's why uh God
[1:18:13] told Abraham they're going to dwell in
[1:18:15] Egypt 400 years and then come back and
[1:18:17] destroy the amorites because the cup of
[1:18:20] the amorites will be fulfilled in other
[1:18:21] words they won't repent for 400 more
[1:18:23] years I'll give them 400 more repent if
[1:18:25] they won't do it I'll destroy them and
[1:18:27] that's exactly what God did God always
[1:18:29] gives a space of repentance for
[1:18:31] everybody amen I believe that verse six
[1:18:34] for thou art and holy people unto the
[1:18:36] Lord thy God the Lord thy God had chosen
[1:18:38] thee to be a special people unto himself
[1:18:41] above all people that are upon the face
[1:18:43] of the earth look at verse seven the
[1:18:47] Lord did not set his love upon you nor
[1:18:50] choose you because you were more in
[1:18:52] number than any people for you were the
[1:18:54] fewest of of all people I like that
[1:18:56] God's not looking at numbers tonight
[1:18:58] amen God's love does not go to the
[1:19:00] biggest churches although I hope it some
[1:19:03] people are saved there right just like I
[1:19:06] hope you know I trust God has saved us
[1:19:08] amen by his grace and mercy it's not
[1:19:11] based upon number or anything it was
[1:19:13] based upon this look at verse eight why
[1:19:16] did God set his love upon Israel because
[1:19:18] of verse eight but because the Lord
[1:19:20] loved you amen and because he would keep
[1:19:23] the oath which he had sworn unto your
[1:19:25] fathers that the Lord brought you out
[1:19:27] with a mighty hand and redeemed you out
[1:19:29] of the house of the bondman from the
[1:19:31] hand of pharaoh king of Egypt so why did
[1:19:33] God love Israel because he swore he
[1:19:35] would to Abraham amen God swore I'll
[1:19:39] I'll love you and your seed just keep my
[1:19:42] word hallelujah you'll be my children
[1:19:46] and they say why did God set your love
[1:19:48] upon us because we are the Seed of
[1:19:50] Abraham and God loves us because the
[1:19:53] Lord loved you amen that's why you're a
[1:19:55] special people why are you special here
[1:19:57] tonight church because the lord loves
[1:19:59] you amen hallelujah and you're Abraham's
[1:20:03] seed and we'll get to a little bit how
[1:20:04] are you Abraham's seed because you
[1:20:06] believe Jesus Christ is the Messiah he's
[1:20:09] the Lamb of God he's the son of God who
[1:20:11] took away the sin of the world and he
[1:20:13] took your sin away when you repented and
[1:20:15] got baptized in his name amen that's how
[1:20:18] you are the Seed of Abraham
[1:20:22] amen he redeemed you he brought you back
[1:20:25] verse n know therefore that the Lord thy
[1:20:28] God he is God the what the faithful God
[1:20:30] he's faithful tonight amen which keepeth
[1:20:33] Covenant and mercy with them that what
[1:20:36] love him but he just got done saying
[1:20:39] because he loved you right but because
[1:20:42] the Lord loved you and now so see it's
[1:20:44] it's a give and take relationship God is
[1:20:46] not forcing you to love him you love him
[1:20:49] because it's just in your heart amen
[1:20:51] right it's in your heart you can't get
[1:20:53] away from it there's something in you
[1:20:55] that loves God Amen
[1:20:57] Hallelujah and so because of that he
[1:21:00] loves you back remember he loved you
[1:21:03] first right he loved you first amen
[1:21:06] Bible said he loved you first that's so
[1:21:08] he died for you while we are yet sinners
[1:21:10] Christ died for uh the unjust and the
[1:21:12] ungodly amen let's finish verse nine
[1:21:15] there he keeps Covenant and mercy with
[1:21:18] them that love him and keep his
[1:21:20] Commandments to a thousand Generations
[1:21:23] amen God so wants somebody God is
[1:21:26] searching brother the holy spirit is
[1:21:27] searching today for people that will
[1:21:29] love him he just wants somebody to love
[1:21:31] the word and people go to people go to
[1:21:34] churches and people people will condemn
[1:21:36] the Old Testament people will condemn
[1:21:38] the Abominations of the Old Testament
[1:21:39] and all kinds of things and it shows
[1:21:41] they don't love God they don't love the
[1:21:43] word we've got to love all the word and
[1:21:45] we got to keep all the commands of God
[1:21:48] now go on let's go down to a few more
[1:21:50] scriptures go to verse
[1:21:52] 12 wherefore shall come to pass if you
[1:21:55] hearken to these judgments and keep and
[1:21:56] do them that the Lord thy God shall keep
[1:21:58] unto thee the Covenant and the mercy
[1:21:59] which he swear to thy fathers verse 13
[1:22:02] and he will love thee Oh My and bless
[1:22:07] thee and multiply thee he also bless the
[1:22:10] fruit of thy womb and the fruit of thy
[1:22:12] lamb thy corn thy wine thine oil the
[1:22:14] increase of thy kind and the flocks of
[1:22:16] thy sheep in the land which he swear
[1:22:18] unto thy fathers to give to thee this is
[1:22:21] the Most Blessed promise how could you
[1:22:24] can you pick picture a better promise
[1:22:25] than this I can't if you just love God
[1:22:28] and keep his commands he's going to
[1:22:29] bless your family he's going to bless
[1:22:31] your job he's going to bless your home
[1:22:33] he's going to bless your land he's going
[1:22:34] to bless everything in church I'm a
[1:22:36] witness he has amen hallelujah if we
[1:22:39] just keep the word and love him just
[1:22:42] love his word just love him love his
[1:22:44] songs and love everything about him if
[1:22:46] we just love him he will love us back
[1:22:48] and bless us
[1:22:49] abundantly amen yes we'll go through
[1:22:52] trials yes we'll go through things that
[1:22:53] the trial faith and test us God allowed
[1:22:55] job to be tested but he always blessed
[1:22:58] us on the other end
[1:23:02] amen now I want to uh the rest of the
[1:23:06] chapter tells about how to how to love
[1:23:08] the Lord
[1:23:10] um in verse 17 and 18 how do how how
[1:23:14] will how will God kick out all these
[1:23:16] nations and God tells them to remember
[1:23:18] what God did before remember how God
[1:23:20] brought you out of Egypt in verse 17 and
[1:23:22] 18 so how am I going to defeat this how
[1:23:24] am I going to feed all these demons
[1:23:26] remember that God brought other people
[1:23:28] remember how far God's brought you out
[1:23:30] he's going to keep bringing you out now
[1:23:32] let me just stop right here remember
[1:23:34] this why am I reading this brother Jesse
[1:23:36] what does this mean brother brandom said
[1:23:38] this is a perfect type of the new New
[1:23:40] Testament
[1:23:41] Christian Israel taking the promised
[1:23:43] land is a type of you overcoming right
[1:23:46] now in the Holy Ghost
[1:23:47] baptism you overcoming this land right
[1:23:52] praise God it's a perfect type he says
[1:23:55] because uh Joshua is the first
[1:23:57] generation freshly Anointed The Holy
[1:23:59] Ghost freshly circumcised which type the
[1:24:01] baptism of the Holy Ghost the fresh ones
[1:24:03] that take the promised land and dwell
[1:24:04] there and live there that's a type of us
[1:24:07] getting baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:24:09] with a first it's a first fresh
[1:24:11] experience where the first generation to
[1:24:12] do it right and go and take the land
[1:24:17] amen did my children remember what did
[1:24:19] uh what did the cross in the Red Sea
[1:24:22] represent
[1:24:26] yes baptism in water praise the
[1:24:29] Lord amen that's what the Red Sea
[1:24:32] represented washing of water in water
[1:24:35] baptism praise God what the desert
[1:24:37] represent Malachi or you remember what's
[1:24:39] the desert represent if justification
[1:24:41] was uh Red Sea what's the desert
[1:24:44] represent sanctification the second step
[1:24:46] of Grace okay then what did cross and
[1:24:49] Jordan represent
[1:24:51] CA and circumcision did it what it
[1:24:53] represent justification sanctification
[1:24:55] or baptism of the Holy Ghost BM of the
[1:24:58] praise God Amen let's give that two
[1:25:00] claps amen that's right that's right
[1:25:03] that's a perfect type of this right here
[1:25:05] that's why we're reading it because we
[1:25:07] get the same results right here if we
[1:25:09] put God first church if we really love
[1:25:11] God God will drive out all of our
[1:25:13] troubles praise God you can live above
[1:25:16] all these things but God said it's not
[1:25:18] going to be right away it's gonna be
[1:25:19] little by little and that's where we
[1:25:21] sometimes get discouraged but like I
[1:25:23] said which one of us how many of us have
[1:25:25] have God delivered us from cussing or
[1:25:27] swearing or cursing people or gossiping
[1:25:30] right or watching evil things or bad
[1:25:33] habits how many of us have been
[1:25:34] delivered from some of these things or
[1:25:35] dressing the wrong way right or looking
[1:25:37] at the wrong thing or all these demons
[1:25:40] have been driven out amen they've been
[1:25:43] driven out yeah there's more to drive
[1:25:45] out but look what's been driven out if
[1:25:47] you just love God and stay with him
[1:25:49] little by little you'll possess the land
[1:25:51] amen that's called being a complete
[1:25:53] Christian amen when all is driven out
[1:25:56] and you got Victory and you can walk in
[1:25:58] love and walk in the spirit you know
[1:26:00] sometimes we get we shouldn't get
[1:26:01] discouraged if we don't see gifts moving
[1:26:03] in our lives the main thing you want to
[1:26:04] see moving in our life is love amen
[1:26:07] loving God and loving others you want to
[1:26:10] see love because you can move all
[1:26:11] mountains with faith but if you don't
[1:26:13] have love it don't profit you anything
[1:26:16] amen like the Bible said you can
[1:26:18] understand all the mysteries of God and
[1:26:19] I've done that I preached all the
[1:26:21] mysteries of God before right because
[1:26:23] there's 12 of them I just said it to
[1:26:25] amen there's 12 Bible New Testament
[1:26:28] Mysteries I can preach all those
[1:26:30] Mysteries but if I don't have love in my
[1:26:31] heart for The Sinner if I don't love in
[1:26:33] the heart for denominational people if I
[1:26:35] don't have love if I wouldn't shake
[1:26:36] their hand and just try to encourage
[1:26:38] them to get in the message then it
[1:26:39] profits you nothing to hear the
[1:26:41] preaching but if I can do that in love
[1:26:43] then I've got
[1:26:45] something and that's what I believe I've
[1:26:47] got amen hallelujah I spoke into uh I
[1:26:50] spoke into infertility and the mountains
[1:26:52] moved Hallelujah
[1:26:54] I've spoken to other uh I spoken to
[1:26:56] kidney stones and the mountain has moved
[1:26:59] amen hallelujah but it's all about love
[1:27:03] behind it that's fine churches can do
[1:27:05] that that's wonderful we all enjoy that
[1:27:07] but who's got the love of the word
[1:27:09] behind it we must love him and we must
[1:27:11] love his nature his character Hallelujah
[1:27:15] verse 26 I want to read that one this is
[1:27:16] one where most this is the one we need
[1:27:18] to watch out the most now that we come
[1:27:20] in the message verse 26 neither now let
[1:27:23] you got your Bible okay
[1:27:25] keep your Bibles handy I want you to
[1:27:26] read for me because I got a lot of
[1:27:27] scripture tonight I'll read this one
[1:27:30] Deuteronomy 7:26 neither shalt thou
[1:27:32] bring an Abomination into thy house lest
[1:27:35] thou be a cursed thing like it but Thou
[1:27:39] shalt utterly detested and thou shalt
[1:27:41] utterly adore it for it is a cursed
[1:27:44] thing so that's why we don't bring Evil
[1:27:46] movies in our house evil music uh
[1:27:49] lustful
[1:27:51] clothes uh evil apps on our phones and
[1:27:54] tablets don't bring anything that's an
[1:27:57] Abomination into our homes praise
[1:28:01] God because the Bible says that will
[1:28:05] that will bring uh that will make you
[1:28:07] like it it'll cause that spirit will get
[1:28:09] on you now church I've known many
[1:28:12] preachers and the preachers that I've
[1:28:14] seen left the message are the ones who
[1:28:17] let rock and roll let their children
[1:28:18] listen to rock and
[1:28:20] roll some of them are some a few of them
[1:28:22] have told me that well I'm sorry told me
[1:28:24] that preached that they've even preached
[1:28:25] it for example their children weren't
[1:28:27] serving God yet so they let their
[1:28:28] teenagers listen to rock and roll on
[1:28:30] headphones or rap or whatever it was in
[1:28:33] their house as long as no one else had
[1:28:35] to hear it and but brother brandom said
[1:28:37] don't let any Trash come in the house he
[1:28:40] said kick all that rock and roll out of
[1:28:41] the house and since that Pastor this
[1:28:44] world world known worldwide Pastor would
[1:28:46] travel around preach around the world
[1:28:47] he's left the message don't even believe
[1:28:49] brother R was a man of God anymore
[1:28:51] really see because they start
[1:28:54] compromising they let abominable things
[1:28:56] in their house then he let his daughters
[1:28:58] and wife start cutting their hair
[1:29:00] wearing makeup and look where he's at
[1:29:03] now right that's that's how it
[1:29:06] is so you see we cannot even compromise
[1:29:09] on the word of God why because it lets
[1:29:11] evil spirits in if you let one spirit in
[1:29:14] then they're going to find another if
[1:29:16] you compromise on one thing it's easier
[1:29:17] to compromise on another thing right
[1:29:20] just like when you uh cast out one devil
[1:29:23] it's easier toast pass another out when
[1:29:25] you get victory over one thing it's
[1:29:27] easier to get victory over another right
[1:29:30] like I was like AA was scared of like
[1:29:32] I'll just use her as example she was
[1:29:33] kind of nervous about being baptized in
[1:29:35] front of everybody right but then so
[1:29:38] that but once she got over that
[1:29:39] nervousness once she actually got out in
[1:29:40] the water she said I wasn't afraid
[1:29:42] anymore see that that's fear the fear
[1:29:44] was trying to get on you but once you
[1:29:46] acted on the word of God and obeyed the
[1:29:47] word of God that demon of fear had to
[1:29:50] leave right that's right it has to leave
[1:29:54] when you when you when you take one step
[1:29:55] to obey God will meet you there and it's
[1:29:58] easier to make the next step like Jesus
[1:30:00] told Nathaniel he said he said oh I just
[1:30:02] told you you're under a fig tree and you
[1:30:04] believe I'm the Messiah he said you'll
[1:30:06] see greater things than this just hang
[1:30:08] around amen if you believe just by that
[1:30:12] you believe on the Messiah I'll show you
[1:30:13] greater things than that
[1:30:16] Hallelujah that's what he keeps doing so
[1:30:18] that's why I read this part of this
[1:30:20] chapter because this is a type God will
[1:30:23] drive out all all the all the the the
[1:30:26] trials in our lives all the Temptations
[1:30:28] If we just love him and try to destroy
[1:30:31] it and we cast out all these Idols
[1:30:32] praise God there's something about God
[1:30:35] loves violent Victory or something like
[1:30:37] that but God God didn't want them just
[1:30:39] to take the the idols and just throw
[1:30:40] them out there the Bible said throw them
[1:30:42] down and stomp on them that's why people
[1:30:45] you know in the days of brother BR they
[1:30:46] they would say they would stomp on
[1:30:48] Devils they pretended they were stomping
[1:30:49] on Devils right I don't know if that's
[1:30:52] real or not but uh there something about
[1:30:54] it God wanted them to cast down those
[1:30:57] idols and Destroy them and remember even
[1:30:59] grind them into powder and throw the
[1:31:00] powder into the into the river the
[1:31:02] streams God wanted them to violently
[1:31:04] cast it down that's why sometimes people
[1:31:06] get Victory when they scream and
[1:31:08] shout and they sometimes you know uh we
[1:31:11] you've seen demons cast out and women or
[1:31:13] men will scream I've seen that my dad's
[1:31:15] seen it we've all seen it uh different
[1:31:17] churches we've gone to why will they
[1:31:19] scream because uh they're screaming
[1:31:22] because that demon has to leave
[1:31:24] praise God they're screaming because the
[1:31:26] demon has leave uh now sometimes other
[1:31:28] people scream because the holy spirit's
[1:31:30] presence is so holy right and they
[1:31:33] scream because of that that's a good
[1:31:34] thing too so they might scream if the
[1:31:36] Demon's leaving because the demon don't
[1:31:38] want to leave or they might scream
[1:31:39] because God's presence is so holy and so
[1:31:41] powerful and it's so filling and
[1:31:43] indwelling them that they have no other
[1:31:44] way just to express it other than
[1:31:47] scream amen right but he wants to
[1:31:51] possess your house and he wants to have
[1:31:54] full victory in our lives amen and we
[1:31:56] are a type or Israel is a type of what
[1:31:59] we are doing possessing this body
[1:32:01] possessing this life
[1:32:04] amen
[1:32:05] now we're already okay let's go to
[1:32:08] Deuteronomy chapter 10 now just turn a
[1:32:09] few pages I just got to turn one page in
[1:32:11] my Bible Deuteronomy 10:15 so are my
[1:32:14] children there ready to read
[1:32:18] okay um Malachi can you read Deuteronomy
[1:32:21] 1015 and 16
[1:32:24] only the Lord had a delight in thy
[1:32:27] fathers to love them and he chose their
[1:32:30] seed after them even you above all
[1:32:33] people as it is this day circumcise
[1:32:37] therefore the foreskin of your heart and
[1:32:39] be no
[1:32:41] more amen and just stop there and think
[1:32:45] about this God said to circumcise what
[1:32:48] their
[1:32:50] heart now they already had the law in
[1:32:52] Genesis 17 God told Abraham you and your
[1:32:55] seed all the males must be circumcised
[1:32:57] In the
[1:32:58] Flesh God is letting them know if you
[1:33:01] really want to follow me you got to have
[1:33:02] your heart circumcised praise God and
[1:33:06] circumcision is a cutting off of extra
[1:33:08] flesh that's not needed right it's not
[1:33:11] necessary it can be cut off and so
[1:33:14] that's what must be done to the heart
[1:33:15] all the fleshly desires of the heart
[1:33:17] must be cut off and done away with God's
[1:33:19] letting them know what is this
[1:33:22] ,500 years before before Christ came
[1:33:24] that the real circumcision comes by the
[1:33:26] Holy Ghost he's letting them know he
[1:33:29] knew they couldn't do it but he was
[1:33:30] saying you've got to have a circumcised
[1:33:33] heart because why because God was
[1:33:35] looking for not just a physical Nation
[1:33:38] he was looking for a spiritual Nation
[1:33:40] someone whose Spirit could be
[1:33:42] circumcised someone who would love him
[1:33:44] so much that they would want all
[1:33:45] anything contrary to God cut away
[1:33:47] removed from their life and then serving
[1:33:50] God in the beauty of Holiness I'll say
[1:33:52] like that okay now go to Gans 3:26 let's
[1:33:55] go there ldia can you help me on this
[1:33:58] one here's how we become Abraham's
[1:34:04] SE uh Lydia can you read 3 Galatians 3
[1:34:08] 26-
[1:34:14] 29
[1:34:16] sorry children of God by faith in Christ
[1:34:20] Jesus for as many of you have beened
[1:34:32] Nei M fale
[1:34:36] are
[1:34:39] andr
[1:34:42] AB amen how many Abraham seed
[1:34:44] tonight you are if you have this faith
[1:34:48] in Christ Jesus your Abraham's seed
[1:34:50] right and what did God promis to all the
[1:34:52] seed if you keep my word I'll drive out
[1:34:55] all the inhabitants right I'll bless you
[1:34:58] if you love me right I Will Bless You
[1:35:01] Hallelujah go to Romans 2:28 brother
[1:35:03] amen can you read this 28 and 29 and
[1:35:06] then Malachi I never read after that but
[1:35:08] Romans 2:28 and
[1:35:10] 29 I just had to show this because God
[1:35:13] God put his love upon Abraham's seed but
[1:35:16] now we're Abraham's spiritual seed I
[1:35:18] just want everybody to see it plainly
[1:35:20] the scripture okay brother 2829 for he
[1:35:23] is not a Jew which is one outwardly
[1:35:26] neither is that circumcision which is
[1:35:28] outward in the flesh but he is a Jew
[1:35:31] which is one and worthy and circumcision
[1:35:33] is that of the heart in the spirit and
[1:35:36] not of the letter whose praise is not of
[1:35:38] men but of them amen praise the Lord
[1:35:42] hallelujah so the Jews are not just
[1:35:44] outwardly you're not a real Jew
[1:35:45] outwardly it's a Jew you're real Jew
[1:35:47] you're you're one of God's children
[1:35:49] right if you're circumcised on the heart
[1:35:51] right that's just playing through the
[1:35:53] script
[1:35:54] scripture and then if you are
[1:35:56] circumcised the Bible said praise is of
[1:35:58] God God Praises you what does he say how
[1:36:00] does God praise you he says well done th
[1:36:02] good and faithful servant right that's
[1:36:04] how he that person gets a praise from
[1:36:06] God well done good and faithful servant
[1:36:08] you are faithful with little I'll make
[1:36:10] you rule over much
[1:36:13] amen now
[1:36:16] um there's something the scriptures
[1:36:18] Colossians chapter 2 now okay Colossians
[1:36:20] chapter 2
[1:36:28] let's go to verse 11 Colossians 2:11 now
[1:36:31] I read 11 and 12 please in whom also you
[1:36:35] are circumcised with the circumcision
[1:36:38] made without hands in putting off the
[1:36:40] body of the sins of the flesh by the
[1:36:43] Circ by the circumcision of Christ
[1:36:46] buried with him in baptism wherein also
[1:36:49] you are risen with him through the faith
[1:36:51] of the operation of God who has raised
[1:36:54] him from the dead amen so who
[1:36:58] circumcised you Christ did if you're in
[1:37:00] the Old Testament they had to go up to
[1:37:02] the priest and circum circumcise the
[1:37:04] baby on the Eighth Day right that's how
[1:37:07] their circumcision work but us when we
[1:37:09] believe in Jesus Christ and we get
[1:37:11] baptized we die to ourselves I'm not
[1:37:13] going to live for Jesse Smith anymore
[1:37:14] I'm not gonna live for daughters would
[1:37:16] say I'm not gonna live for Lydia I'm not
[1:37:17] live foration anymore I'm gonna live for
[1:37:19] Jesus that was your circumcision moment
[1:37:22] right when Christ circumcised the flesh
[1:37:25] away and you want to be a servant for
[1:37:27] God Almighty amen buried in baptism
[1:37:30] hallelujah amen I want to read verse 13
[1:37:33] and you being dead in your sins and the
[1:37:35] uncircumcision of your flesh hath he
[1:37:37] quickened together with him having
[1:37:39] forgiven you all your transgressions so
[1:37:41] it doesn't matter if somebody's not
[1:37:42] physically uh circumcised it must be the
[1:37:45] circumcision of Christ amen of the heart
[1:37:49] you're quickened by the word and he
[1:37:51] forgives you all your transgressions
[1:37:53] amen
[1:37:56] Hallelujah let's go to Jeremiah 9 I
[1:37:58] found this one day I just thought this
[1:37:59] was Glory glorious
[1:38:02] here Jeremiah
[1:38:14] 9:23 seemed like I I mean I've read this
[1:38:17] numerous times but seemed like it the
[1:38:18] first time I read it today I was like
[1:38:20] Wow praise the lord it's imp perfectly
[1:38:22] Jeremiah 9:23 thus sayith the Lord let
[1:38:24] not the wise man glory in his wisdom
[1:38:27] neither let the Mighty Man glory in his
[1:38:28] might let not the rich man glory in his
[1:38:31] riches but let him that glorieth glory
[1:38:35] in this so check these next words watch
[1:38:38] these next words so what should you
[1:38:39] glory in God God speaking through
[1:38:42] Jeremiah that he understandeth and
[1:38:45] knoweth me that I am the Lord which
[1:38:47] exercise loving kindness judgment and
[1:38:51] righteousness in the Earth for in these
[1:38:53] things I Delight sayeth the Lord amen
[1:38:58] hallelujah well that's beautiful Church
[1:39:00] what does God what does God want you to
[1:39:02] be glory in now the Bible says the New
[1:39:04] Testament we glory in the death of Jesus
[1:39:06] Christ in the cross but of course this
[1:39:08] ties in with it right because you only
[1:39:10] know him the Bible said glory in that
[1:39:12] you understand him and know him praise
[1:39:15] God and what is God Delight in loving
[1:39:18] kindness judgment and righteousness in
[1:39:21] the earth praise God
[1:39:23] that's what he Delights in now verse 25
[1:39:28] behold the days come I believe these
[1:39:29] days are right now because it's
[1:39:30] prophetic sayith the Lord that I will
[1:39:32] punish all them which are circumcised
[1:39:34] with the uncircumcised so God says
[1:39:36] there's going to come a day it don't
[1:39:37] matter if you're circumcised or
[1:39:39] uncircumcised verse 26 Egypt and Judah
[1:39:42] and Edom and the children of Ammon and
[1:39:43] Moab and all that are in the utmost
[1:39:45] Corners that dwell in the wilderness for
[1:39:47] all these nations are uncircumcised and
[1:39:48] all the house of Israel are
[1:39:50] uncircumcised in the what heart
[1:39:54] God said there's going to come a day
[1:39:55] where I'm going to judge everyone if
[1:39:56] they're not circumcised in the heart how
[1:39:58] do you get circumcised in the heart
[1:40:00] believe on Jesus Christ make him your
[1:40:02] savior amen serve the
[1:40:05] Lord and then get born again now acts
[1:40:08] seven you have to turn that act 7 verse
[1:40:10] 51 uh Stephen says ye stiff neck and
[1:40:13] uncircumcised in heart and ears you do
[1:40:16] always resist the Holy Ghost as your
[1:40:18] fathers did so do
[1:40:20] ye now notice when they heard these
[1:40:23] things in verse 54 they were cut to the
[1:40:25] heart and they nashed on him with their
[1:40:27] teeth now did you catch that Stephen
[1:40:30] said you're uncircumcising heart and ear
[1:40:32] but when he said that it cut their
[1:40:34] hearts so look they got cut but they
[1:40:37] didn't get cut all the way right other
[1:40:39] words they got convicted but they didn't
[1:40:41] let the conviction fully cut out and
[1:40:43] repent right that's I love that see when
[1:40:46] we speak the truth It Cuts Like a Knife
[1:40:49] and people get cut but you got to get
[1:40:51] circumcised all the way amen glory it
[1:40:54] ain't enough to get cut a little bit
[1:40:56] like they got cut to the heart it
[1:40:57] convicted them
[1:40:59] right but to be circumcised is to fully
[1:41:02] repent and say yes I'm wrong God forgive
[1:41:05] me and I'll change my ways I'll walk in
[1:41:08] the ways of the Lord praise God I
[1:41:10] believe that happened to our piano
[1:41:12] teacher that's what I believe with all
[1:41:13] my heart my piano teacher watch or our
[1:41:16] piano teacher watched my video on makeup
[1:41:18] in the Bible and when I made that video
[1:41:20] I was praying and fasting I was so meek
[1:41:22] and humble when I made that video and
[1:41:24] the piano teacher uh emailed me and said
[1:41:27] Jesse there's just something that I just
[1:41:29] felt while you were make while you were
[1:41:31] talking on that video there just
[1:41:32] something I felt I just can't explain it
[1:41:34] and I just don't like it and church I
[1:41:37] believe with all my heart it was
[1:41:38] conviction that she didn't like I
[1:41:40] believe it was so long since she
[1:41:42] actually been convicted by the real Holy
[1:41:44] Spirit preaching because they go to a a
[1:41:46] Presbyterian church and they they Don't
[1:41:47] Preach Holiness they can cut their hair
[1:41:50] wear makeup and go to movies and show
[1:41:52] show off their bodies and sexy clothing
[1:41:54] they can do whatever they want as long
[1:41:55] as they come to church and say I'm I I'm
[1:41:58] a Christian I believe Jesus Christ is
[1:42:00] the Son of God they can do whatever they
[1:42:01] want and so the first time she said I
[1:42:03] don't know what I felt but I just didn't
[1:42:05] like what I felt and I thought that's
[1:42:06] the conviction of the Holy Spirit that's
[1:42:08] being cut by the word right and I said
[1:42:11] well show me a Bible a place in the
[1:42:13] Bible where a person can wear makeup and
[1:42:15] they couldn't show nothing they just
[1:42:17] said oh we're all one in Christ Jesus
[1:42:19] male or female they actually quoted
[1:42:21] Galatians 3 there and I said well that's
[1:42:22] out of context that's not talking about
[1:42:24] face painting that's talking about being
[1:42:26] the body of Christ but I can show you
[1:42:28] three scriptures about face painting
[1:42:29] that condemn it right so see that they
[1:42:33] have no place to stand and they get cut
[1:42:36] but they won't be circumcised God help
[1:42:38] us to be circumcised amen cut out all
[1:42:41] the sin cut out all the flesh let's
[1:42:43] let's uh enjoy the cutting of the Holy
[1:42:46] Spirit I know it's hard to say but let
[1:42:48] us enjoy being cut right by the Holy
[1:42:50] Spirit let's get a real circumcision not
[1:42:52] just a cut because they were cut but
[1:42:54] then they end up killing him right they
[1:42:57] were convicted but they resisted the
[1:42:59] conviction of the Holy Spirit they
[1:43:00] resisted the Holy Ghost and they didn't
[1:43:02] take on that conviction they didn't let
[1:43:03] it work its way to repentance and they
[1:43:06] took the stones and stoned him
[1:43:09] right and I've always like this I've
[1:43:11] always We Are Spiritual Israel right
[1:43:14] because our hearts get circumcised we're
[1:43:17] the people of God I've always just want
[1:43:19] to I always want to remind you this type
[1:43:21] here when I preach on Esther a beautiful
[1:43:23] type when Esther married the king
[1:43:26] remember Mori said don't tell that
[1:43:28] you're a
[1:43:29] Jew huah I just love the to me this is a
[1:43:33] simulation of Revelation amen that's why
[1:43:35] I laugh and I just I just getting hold
[1:43:38] Heavenly places here God Mori said don't
[1:43:42] tell uh the king hueras that you're a
[1:43:45] Jew right don't tell him so she goes
[1:43:47] there and everybody thinks she's a
[1:43:48] gentile oh she's a gentile bride the
[1:43:51] King married a gentile bride put away as
[1:43:53] he and married a gentile Bride on the
[1:43:55] seventh day right and when it comes down
[1:43:58] to it when it all comes down to the
[1:43:59] persecution and politics are going to
[1:44:01] destroy all the Jews the bride the Bride
[1:44:03] of the King goes into the closet right
[1:44:06] puts on her clly or king or I'm sorry
[1:44:09] Royal garments right all the white
[1:44:10] garments fast and praise she comes out
[1:44:13] and comes before the king without a
[1:44:15] command right and she says I have one
[1:44:18] request he said say it I'll give you
[1:44:19] half my kingdom she said I want to make
[1:44:20] a banquet to the king and so they have
[1:44:23] one banquet and the hymon comes
[1:44:24] everybody comes remember that and then
[1:44:26] she says okay Queen what do you want
[1:44:28] Queen Esther I want one more
[1:44:30] banquet right and then at the banquet
[1:44:33] now at the second banquet they say queen
[1:44:34] what do you want please tell me what you
[1:44:35] want and uh uh the queen says uh that
[1:44:40] our people are going to be killed and uh
[1:44:44] the king said who would do this and uh
[1:44:46] she said it's hmon who's sitting here
[1:44:48] and hmon reaches over there and touches
[1:44:49] the queen right and uh the king
[1:44:52] immediately gets him and hangs him and
[1:44:53] so forth like that what the Ty of the
[1:44:55] Bride of Jesus Christ when the political
[1:44:58] persecution starts coming down she's
[1:45:00] going to come out of the closet and show
[1:45:02] everybody whose sh side she's on and
[1:45:04] she's gonna show you thought I was a
[1:45:06] gentile but really I'm a spiritual
[1:45:08] Jew Hallelujah I'm Abraham seed in other
[1:45:12] words amen are you with me everybody
[1:45:14] thought and church we are Jew by the
[1:45:15] Flesh and everybody thought she was a
[1:45:17] Jew but when it come down to it she
[1:45:19] turned out she was a Jew Hallelujah she
[1:45:21] was a spiritual Jew and that's what we
[1:45:23] Are Spiritual Jews
[1:45:26] amen
[1:45:27] hallelujah to me that's a little
[1:45:29] Revelation that lays there in the
[1:45:30] scripture they thought she was a gentile
[1:45:32] but she turns out to be a Jew that's us
[1:45:35] we were uh we're Gentile but we're Jew
[1:45:37] by the spirit we're circumcised of the
[1:45:40] heart all the fleshly desires are cut
[1:45:42] away and now we serve Jesus Christ
[1:45:45] amen all
[1:45:47] right not going qu quite a far on that
[1:45:50] but let's let's go to Acts chapter 10
[1:45:53] remember God Delights in all those who
[1:45:56] what fear Him let's go to acts 10:34
[1:45:59] brother amen If You Could Read 34 and
[1:46:05] 35 you
[1:46:07] ready Peter opened his mouth and said I
[1:46:11] perceive that God is no respectful of
[1:46:13] person but in every nation he has fear
[1:46:16] and work of righteousness is accept amen
[1:46:20] I believe that's right Peter preaches
[1:46:22] there on Corel say Housetop and he said
[1:46:24] now remember that the Holy Ghost hadn't
[1:46:25] gone to the Gentiles yet right and they
[1:46:27] thought well Gentiles are unclean
[1:46:29] they're not going to serve God they had
[1:46:30] these wrong ideas they didn't realize
[1:46:32] the prophecies in Hosea and Isaiah and
[1:46:34] different prophecies where God was going
[1:46:36] to reveal himself to the Gentiles and
[1:46:37] they're going to be part of the the one
[1:46:38] body the one family so Peter gets up
[1:46:41] there and the Holy Spirit led him up
[1:46:42] there by a vision and he starts
[1:46:43] preaching and he said no matter what
[1:46:45] nation as a person is in as long as they
[1:46:47] fear God God will accept that person
[1:46:50] praise God as why why will God accept
[1:46:53] anyone that fears him because God
[1:46:55] Delights in those who fear his word
[1:46:57] right that's what the scripture says God
[1:47:00] loves anybody that loves him amen anyone
[1:47:03] that wants to obey his word and respects
[1:47:05] God and knows they're God somewhere God
[1:47:07] will receive that person whether they're
[1:47:08] foolish or wise God will accept them
[1:47:12] amen because the fear of God is to hate
[1:47:14] sin and now notice they work
[1:47:17] righteousness so see their faith just
[1:47:18] doesn't say well I believe in God and
[1:47:20] they work evil but the Bible said they
[1:47:23] fear God and work righteous so they let
[1:47:25] their faith go to work God will accept
[1:47:27] anyone in any Nation who fears God and
[1:47:30] acts upon their faith and does good for
[1:47:32] other people
[1:47:34] amen and how does faith operate by
[1:47:38] love so see take it take it back they
[1:47:41] got the right works because they got
[1:47:42] faith and they got faith because they
[1:47:44] got love and they got love because they
[1:47:45] fear God if you take it all the way back
[1:47:50] we have to fear God we have to respect
[1:47:52] that God is in heaven he's above all he
[1:47:54] knows all he's in all he's allowed all
[1:47:56] this to happen he's allowed us to be
[1:47:58] here it's got to go all the way back to
[1:47:59] fearing him loving him that we have
[1:48:02] faith in him and our faith causes us to
[1:48:03] work for him hallelujah
[1:48:11] amen now let's go to
[1:48:14] uh 1st Samuel 15:22 this is a familiar
[1:48:17] scripture most of you know I'll read it
[1:48:19] and Samuel said hath the Lord has great
[1:48:21] Delight in burnt offerings and sacrifice
[1:48:23] as in obeying the voice of the
[1:48:26] Lord behold to obey is better than
[1:48:29] sacrifice and to hearken than the fat of
[1:48:34] rams so now we see another
[1:48:37] principle does God Delight as much in
[1:48:40] just religious works or obedience to
[1:48:43] what he said obedience so you must fear
[1:48:46] God and then you must obey his word
[1:48:49] exactly what he said and he'll Delight
[1:48:51] in that he gets light when you take his
[1:48:53] word say I want to obey all the word I
[1:48:55] want to make sure I'm obeying all the
[1:48:57] word now church this is not
[1:49:01] legalism because Jesus obeyed every word
[1:49:04] right and he wasn't a legalist right he
[1:49:07] wasn't a law he wasn't a law a person
[1:49:09] that added on to the law right he wasn't
[1:49:11] a lawyer or something like that he was
[1:49:13] just a son he was a beloved Son that
[1:49:16] loved the father and kept his
[1:49:19] word so see God has Delight in those who
[1:49:22] hear the voice of God remember Saul did
[1:49:24] most of what God Said remember Saul
[1:49:27] killed most of those I forget which
[1:49:29] country it was amorites I can't remember
[1:49:30] now which one I can't remember what was
[1:49:34] it Amit thank you he killed most of them
[1:49:37] but he kept the king and he kept all
[1:49:40] their good animals to sacrifice so he
[1:49:42] kept what about 80% 90% of the word God
[1:49:46] didn't Delight in that God wanted 100%
[1:49:48] of the word right obey my voice if I
[1:49:51] tell you this then it's got to be done
[1:49:54] see God's not leg remember legalism is
[1:49:57] excessive adherence to the to the
[1:49:59] Commandments of God so it's doing
[1:50:01] something excessive okay it's not it's
[1:50:04] it's going beyond what the word says
[1:50:06] it's adding to the word or taking away
[1:50:08] but if we just do what the word said
[1:50:10] then we are Delight unto God
[1:50:12] Amen brother BR said this and why Christ
[1:50:15] speak 1959 God had called Moses a
[1:50:18] special calling and when God calls a man
[1:50:20] and anoints him for a special Duty he
[1:50:23] expects that man to carry that out to
[1:50:25] the
[1:50:27] letter God doesn't want to give a man a
[1:50:29] commission and him hum hul around about
[1:50:32] it anybody been huming hum hul rounding
[1:50:35] about obeying the word of God a hum haul
[1:50:38] I don't know if I'll do it or not I
[1:50:40] don't know if I'll obey God's word today
[1:50:42] h i don't know if I'll do this like I
[1:50:43] told God I would H H I don't know if
[1:50:46] I'll do this what God told me to do you
[1:50:48] don't want to hum haul around and be
[1:50:50] kind of wishy-washy you want to obey
[1:50:53] what God Said right if Saul would have
[1:50:55] did that he would have been king forever
[1:50:57] God said so if he would obeyed the word
[1:50:59] of God he would have been king forever
[1:51:02] but because he only obeyed 90% God was
[1:51:06] displeasing and what does God have
[1:51:08] delighted a religious work 90% or
[1:51:11] obedience God Delights in full obedience
[1:51:13] to the word of God
[1:51:16] Amen brother brand said when he got a
[1:51:18] vision in South Africa in 1952 to go to
[1:51:21] deran South Africa

[1:51:25] God remember he let the ministers take
[1:51:28] him to places other than Duran and God
[1:51:30] let him get sick for eight months of his
[1:51:31] life he laid in a bed in 1952 you can
[1:51:34] look at it on the tapes there he doesn't
[1:51:35] have sermons for certain months because
[1:51:37] he disobeyed the voice of the Lord amen
[1:51:40] so God help us said I got to strictly
[1:51:43] obey the lord well we got to strictly
[1:51:44] obey but strictly doesn't mean legalism
[1:51:46] strictly just means obey all of it okay
[1:51:50] obey all of it
[1:51:54] it's not legalism it's not
[1:51:57] legalism it is O full obedience to the
[1:52:00] full word of God because Jesus said the
[1:52:02] Holy Ghost will guide you into some of
[1:52:04] the truth no all the truth in John

[1:52:57] back and if we love him we'll keep his
[1:53:01] commands let me read this what brother B

[1:57:10] often but I want to to show how the
[1:57:13] Bible says how you will Delight in the
[1:57:15] Lord the Bible says if you Delight in
[1:57:17] the Lord he'll give you desire of your
[1:57:18] heart well all of us have desires right

[1:57:47] jobs all these things the greatest thing
[1:57:49] you can desire is souls to be saved to

[1:59:50] God Delights Delights in fearing
[1:59:52] right if you fear him if you obey him
[1:59:54] God Delights in that but we have to
[1:59:57] Delight in the Lord we have to commit
[2:00:00] our way to God that means everything you
[2:00:03] do every decision you make about family
[2:00:05] every decision you make about church
[2:00:06] about God the job all these things your
[2:00:09] home commit every way to God and we
[2:00:12] can't commit something to God that's

[2:00:39] verse 23 later in the chapter it talks
[2:00:40] more about delighting in God the steps
[2:00:43] of a good man are ordered by the Lord

[2:00:57] filled with the Holy Ghost now filled
[2:00:58] with the Holy Ghost go towards adoption
[2:01:00] right order your steps in the word of
[2:01:03] God and God will Delight in your walk
[2:01:04] with the Lord hallelujah verse 24 though
[2:01:09] he fall anybody fall this week anybody
[2:01:11] make a mistake though he fall he shall
[2:01:15] not be utterly cast
[2:01:16] down even though if I fall I won't stay
[2:01:19] down I'll get back up I fall we all M
[2:01:22] sakes the righteous fall seven times the
[2:01:24] Lord lift him up right though you fall
[2:01:27] you're not utterly cast down for the
[2:01:29] Lord upholdeth him with his hand amen
[2:01:32] the hand of the Lord reaches down if you
[2:01:34] make the wrong step he'll pull you back
[2:01:36] amen but you got to just repent and get
[2:01:39] right back with the word right where he
[2:01:40] asked you to
[2:01:42] go
[2:01:44] amen H Allelujah
[2:01:48] now let me just read a few more
[2:01:50] scriptures here
[2:01:55] let's go to Isaiah 58 I thought this was
[2:01:57] a little bit uh I felt a little bit
[2:01:59] inspired by this this
[2:02:02] weekend some brother's been contact I
[2:02:04] told you a brother been emailing me
[2:02:05] about battling homosexuality from
[2:02:07] overseas and and he said he was fasting
[2:02:09] and praying yesterday and today I think
[2:02:10] for deliverance and I'm waiting to hear
[2:02:13] a report but he said uh pray for me so I
[2:02:16] sent the scripture I sent the whole
[2:02:17] chapter out Isaiah 58 Isaiah 58 is about
[2:02:21] getting your heart right with God and
[2:02:22] delighting yourself in the Lord and the
[2:02:24] way to do it is to do it the way God
[2:02:26] commanded through um turning from Evil
[2:02:30] and go turning unto God let's read verse
[2:02:33] one and two Isaiah 581 and2 cry aloud
[2:02:36] spare not now he's talking to Isaiah
[2:02:38] lift up thy voice like a trumpet and
[2:02:40] show my people their transgression in
[2:02:42] the house of Jacob their sins now stop
[2:02:43] right there does everybody like it when
[2:02:46] the preacher will come and Shout out the
[2:02:47] S you're battle with does anybody like
[2:02:49] that probably not right but that's what
[2:02:51] God told a prophet to do show them their
[2:02:53] sins that's why it's hard church when I
[2:02:55] know even even even if I know of even if
[2:02:58] I don't know people are sinning it's
[2:03:00] hard to tell them they're sinning and
[2:03:01] they're Sinners but God calls preachers
[2:03:04] to do that right show them where they're
[2:03:06] wrong that's what God told Isaiah show
[2:03:08] them where they're wrong so they can get
[2:03:10] right if they don't know where they're
[2:03:11] wrong how can they get right preachers
[2:03:14] have to show the people their
[2:03:15] transgressions it's not easy I hate to
[2:03:17] do it I hate to condemn makeup or people
[2:03:19] that cut their hair right when they're
[2:03:20] sitting right in service I hate to do
[2:03:22] that of myself but God con strains me to
[2:03:25] do it I have to do it it's the word I
[2:03:27] have to stay with the word because you
[2:03:30] hate to hurt people's feelings of your
[2:03:31] own human feelings right well ra said he
[2:03:33] wish You' have to preach these hard
[2:03:35] things but he had to because it's God's
[2:03:37] Commission Now verse two yet they seek
[2:03:39] me daily Delight to know my ways as a
[2:03:41] nation that did righteousness and
[2:03:43] forsook not the ordinance of their God
[2:03:45] they ask me of their ordinances of
[2:03:46] Justice they take Delight in approaching
[2:03:48] to god let's get down to verse 13
[2:03:52] God kind of rebukes them for not fasting
[2:03:54] the right way he kind of uh says they're
[2:03:57] they're fasting for selfish
[2:03:59] reasons now verse
[2:04:01] 13 if thou turn away thy foot from the
[2:04:04] Sabbath from doing thy pleasure on my
[2:04:05] holy
[2:04:06] day and call the Sabbath of delight the
[2:04:10] holy of the Lord honorable and shall
[2:04:12] honor him not doing thine own ways nor
[2:04:14] finding thine own pleasure nor speaking
[2:04:16] thine own words now look what they would
[2:04:17] do on the Sabbath remember the Sabbath
[2:04:19] day was to go was to rest from all your
[2:04:21] works and go to the the synagogue and
[2:04:23] hear the words of God but Israel was
[2:04:26] just going through the motions they were
[2:04:28] keeping the Sabbath but they were just
[2:04:29] saying what they wanted to say they were
[2:04:31] in other words the word wasn't having an
[2:04:32] impact on their lives it wasn't
[2:04:35] impacting them they would say what they
[2:04:36] would do what they want they would take
[2:04:38] pleasure in everything else except the
[2:04:40] the church
[2:04:41] service right that's exactly right every
[2:04:44] everything else was more pleasurable
[2:04:45] than the actual thing that was supposed
[2:04:47] to be pleasurable which was the word of
[2:04:49] God now verse 14 if they turn away then
[2:04:53] shalt thou Delight thyself in the Lord
[2:04:56] the Bible says delight yourself in the
[2:04:57] Lord how do you how do we Delight
[2:04:58] ourselves in the Lord take pleasure in
[2:05:01] what God takes pleasure in make God's
[2:05:04] word God's house God's songs make that
[2:05:06] your pleasure don't let anything else be
[2:05:09] more pleasurable than the things of God
[2:05:11] in other words make Church the highlight
[2:05:12] of your week praise God make Church the
[2:05:15] highlight of make this the time you look
[2:05:17] forward to make this your
[2:05:19] expectation listen to sermons to build

[2:05:25] highlight of your life delight yourself
[2:05:28] in him when you make God your number one
[2:05:31] then you're delighting yourself in the
[2:05:33] Lord you're saying his words you're
[2:05:35] praising him you're thanking him you his
[2:05:38] day is Holy the word of God is a holy
[2:05:39] thing it is a glorious thing honoring
[2:05:42] him verse 14 and I cause thee to ride
[2:05:44] upon the high places of the earth and
[2:05:46] feed thee with the heritage of Jacob thy
[2:05:49] father for the mouth of the Lord that's

[2:06:24] we if you Delight in him he'll give you
[2:06:26] the desires of your heart and what's our
[2:06:28] real desires to have eternal rewards

[2:07:53] now brother Brandon said
[2:07:56] this brother brandom said that Danny
[2:07:58] Henry after he preached this sermon if
[2:08:02] you some you know the story he's
[2:08:03] preaching in like a kitchen or a
[2:08:04] restaurant and Danny Henry was a a man
[2:08:07] who uh was related to a famous person I
[2:08:10] can't remember it now Danny Henry come
[2:08:12] up and laid his hands on brother Braham
[2:08:14] and said that was so beautiful he said
[2:08:16] he said that could be the 23rd chapter
[2:08:19] of Revelation and there's only 22
[2:08:20] chapters so basic was saying you just
[2:08:22] preach like you were a prophet and
[2:08:24] brother BR said Danny Henry spoke in an
[2:08:26] unknown
[2:08:28] tongue uh and then he said there was
[2:08:30] three people that gave interpretation of
[2:08:31] that unknown tongue and uh one of them
[2:08:35] was in French and there were a couple
[2:08:36] other ones he said in all three
[2:08:38] interpretations all said the same thing
[2:08:40] here's what it said because thou Hast
[2:08:43] chosen the Narrow Path remember David
[2:08:46] said I've chosen your precepts you have
[2:08:48] to make the choice to delight in God you
[2:08:50] have to choose to make God more
[2:08:52] delightful than other things in our
[2:08:55] lives the Holy Spirit told Brother BR
[2:08:57] because thou has chosen the Narrow Path
[2:09:00] the harder way thou Hast walked in your
[2:09:03] own choosing see well right now you're
[2:09:05] walking your own choices aren't you glad
[2:09:07] you chose to come to church tonight I'm
[2:09:09] glad I came I chose to come here you're
[2:09:12] walking you will we we will walk in our
[2:09:14] own choosing in other words we will uh
[2:09:17] reap the the fruits of our choices the
[2:09:19] seed the fruits of our seeds that we
[2:09:21] plant lives the Holy Spirit tells
[2:09:23] brother B thou has picked the correct
[2:09:25] and precise decision and it is my way
[2:09:29] because of this momentous decision a
[2:09:32] huge portion of Heaven awaits thee what
[2:09:34] a glorious decision thou has made this
[2:09:38] in itself is that which will give and
[2:09:42] make to come to pass the tremendous
[2:09:44] victory in the love
[2:09:46] divine amen hallelujah I want to close
[2:09:49] with that by God's grace
[2:09:51] chosen I chosen thy precepts and the
[2:09:55] Holy Spirit encouraged his brother
[2:09:56] brandom in 196 well I think it was
[2:09:58] earlier than that but encourage him
[2:10:00] you've chosen the right way but it's the
[2:10:01] harder way and because of that a huge
[2:10:04] portion of Heaven awaits
[2:10:08] you and because he chose this it will
[2:10:11] bring to pass a tremendous victory in
[2:10:13] what the love
[2:10:16] divine what is love divine the Holy
[2:10:18] Ghost what is the Holy Ghost it's Christ
[2:10:20] in US the hope of glory because brother
[2:10:23] Ram chose to walk the narrow road now

[2:10:27] in my
[2:10:28] life Hallelujah love divine should be
[2:10:31] getting a great victory in your life
