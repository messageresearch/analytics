[23:23] - is word race I'd like to continue on
[23:28] here tonight again by the grace of the
[23:31] Lord I want to look at the effects of
[23:34] beards now I will look at the effects of
[23:36] fear and hopefully we'll get on another
[23:38] angle and overcoming and I just want to
[23:41] look at that year God's grace I like to
[23:45] read out numbers 13 go there numbers 13
[23:53] [Music]
[24:15] now we know the story here this is where
[24:18] Israel's at Kadesh Barnea and I want to
[24:20] look at the effects of fear in this
[24:23] story now Sunday we had just a wonderful
[24:24] time looking at the seven nations that
[24:28] Joshua conquered by God's grace and they
[24:32] shared that with some brothers this week
[24:33] and they're really blessed by that I was
[24:34] just so burden I just I'm so thankful
[24:36] for I want to share with somebody so
[24:38] they enjoyed that and I hope you enjoyed
[24:40] it too as I can see myself battle those
[24:42] constantly amen and thank the Lord for
[24:44] the victory that we have but I want to
[24:47] remember this story here before they
[24:49] went over they had to spend 40 more
[24:51] years in the earnest because they let
[24:53] fear take ahold of the entire
[24:55] congregation I'm gonna skip down let's
[24:57] go to verse 27 just because of sake of
[25:02] time here I wanna make sure I'm very
[25:04] mindful of time verse 27 and they told
[25:07] him and said we came unto the land
[25:09] whither thou sent us us and surely it
[25:11] flows with milk and honey and this is
[25:13] the fruit of it nevertheless the people
[25:16] be strong that dwell in the land and the
[25:19] cities are walled
[25:20] and very great and moreover we saw the
[25:22] children of anak there I'm gonna skip
[25:25] ahead you know Caleb stills the people
[25:27] we taught it we taught that today in
[25:28] youth group before service let's go to
[25:30] verse 31 so caleb stills the people it
[25:34] gets everybody quiet and he gives them a
[25:35] word of faith but they turn from it they
[25:37] reject his word of faith they don't
[25:39] receive it verse 31 but the men that
[25:42] went up him said we be not able to go up
[25:44] against the people for they are stronger
[25:48] than we and they brought up an evil
[25:50] report of the land which they had
[25:52] searched under the turn of Israel saying
[25:54] the land which though I'm sorry through
[25:56] which we have gone to search it is a
[25:58] land that eateth up the inhabitants
[26:00] thereof and all the people that we saw
[26:02] in it are men of great stature and there
[26:05] we saw the Giants the sons of anak Enoch
[26:07] which come of the Giants and we were in
[26:10] our own sight as grasshoppers and so we
[26:13] were in their sight a man s power has a
[26:15] word of Prayer you have a need on your
[26:17] heart just money
[26:17] make it known unto God as we approach
[26:19] the word Heavenly Father we love you
[26:22] tonight again we thank you for the
[26:23] prayers and the songs come thou fount of
[26:27] every blessing come now sweet Holy
[26:29] Spirit Lord God as we're gathered we're
[26:31] calling upon the name of Jesus Christ
[26:33] may the holy spirit of Jesus Christ come
[26:35] now be with us lord give us every
[26:38] blessing we need for tonight Lord God I
[26:40] don't know who this is for no doubt for
[26:42] me Lord as I believe it's a timely
[26:44] message the Lord may it be for everyone
[26:47] Lord to be able to hear the Word of God
[26:49] we know this is your divine plan this is
[26:53] Lord the way to grow as a Christian is
[26:55] to hear the word because faith comes by
[26:57] hearing and hearing by the Word of God
[27:00] if we want to get closer to your Lord
[27:02] this is your divine plan to gather acept
[27:05] and assemble together to pray to worship
[27:07] to pull upon you Lord God may we pull
[27:10] out a blessing from your heart or as I
[27:12] know your heart is open Lord ready to
[27:14] give us blessings ready to give us your
[27:16] word your promise is Lord let us have
[27:19] faith to receive and Lord we thank you
[27:20] may you give us everything we have need
[27:22] of in Jesus Christ's name we mature said
[27:25] amen god bless you didn't see their
[27:27] praise god someone look at the effects
[27:32] of fear tonight by God's grace I 1 look
[27:34] at a few of them now like I said there's
[27:36] over I think 700 verses on fear I
[27:38] haven't gone over them all yet but I
[27:41] want to just bring out I think I have
[27:43] about 11 effects or maybe 10 effects
[27:45] that we can clearly see through
[27:47] Scripture that I think will be a
[27:48] blessing to us tonight by the grace of
[27:51] the Lord so the first one we saw is our
[27:54] first effective fear now recall that
[27:57] fear is a spirit and I like when our
[27:59] sister Marie gave a testimony she said I
[28:01] battled a certain thing for so many
[28:03] years but after we preached the spirit
[28:05] of fear she could identify what it was
[28:07] remember that when she testified she can
[28:09] now identify it and once you can
[28:10] identify something then you can overcome
[28:12] it praise God but see like brother
[28:14] Branham said that demons got to be what
[28:16] exposed and thank God that the word
[28:18] exposes every one of those demons amen
[28:20] that we battle that we face that we go
[28:22] through trials against Hill expose
[28:24] everyone we just got to trust in his
[28:26] word amen so we see that and we're
[28:29] thankful
[28:30] that we recognize the spirit of fears
[28:32] not from God God gives power love and a
[28:35] sound mind praise the Lord
[28:37] so the first thing we see through this
[28:39] story is that fear is contagious cuz
[28:41] caleb stills the people he tells
[28:44] everybody be quiet he gives him the
[28:46] promise that God gave to Moses right
[28:48] beforehand and it's not enough and fear
[28:52] spreads from ten to two million can you
[28:54] imagine that that's just like how social
[28:57] media works right you know somebody post
[28:59] something crazy it'll spread like
[29:00] wildfire whether it's good or good or
[29:02] bad it'll spread and so ten people are
[29:06] able to influence 2 million not but two
[29:10] people because they stay true to God
[29:11] what God does when God's gonna carry out
[29:13] his word he ignores the 2 million right
[29:17] allows all them to die in the wilderness
[29:19] and God raised up the next generation
[29:21] someone that will believe the Word of
[29:23] God amen God never forgot that little
[29:26] group that couple believers God never
[29:29] forgot them what God did was preserve
[29:31] them amen God preserved the few that
[29:34] actually believed even though everybody
[29:36] else fell away and unbelief and fear and
[29:38] they doubted God's promise God just did
[29:41] away with them and let some time go by
[29:43] he raised up those two along with a new
[29:46] generation and took him in the promised
[29:48] land amen God always honors faith aren't
[29:51] you glad hallelujah he always honors
[29:54] faith so fear is contagious fear also
[30:01] keeps people from their destiny or their
[30:05] their inheritance kind of say like that
[30:07] it keeps us from our inheritance it
[30:10] keeps us from the promises that God has
[30:12] for us and we preach on that last year
[30:15] about how you can lose rewards we're
[30:16] familiar with that how a saw lost the
[30:19] reward of having the kingdom forever
[30:21] as I mentioned numerous times but I want
[30:23] to bring that to us again it's
[30:24] contagious and then if it's so serious
[30:27] God's Word is so serious that if if we
[30:29] let fear get victory in the moment when
[30:31] we should have it at the wrong time it
[30:33] can keep someone from there I'm sorry
[30:36] from their divine destiny or divine
[30:38] inheritance amen
[30:40] praise the Lord next
[30:44] this is pretty striking let's go to
[30:45] Deuteronomy chapter 1 this is really
[30:47] striking to me God looks back later a
[30:52] few years after numbers 13 and has Moses
[30:55] right due to Romney remember Deuteronomy
[30:57] pne's two laws or the second time the
[30:59] law is preached Moses read everybody the
[31:01] law after Mount Sinai you know he got
[31:03] the Ten Commandments and so forth sorry
[31:06] he got the Ten Commandments and then
[31:08] towards the end of his life God had him
[31:10] rehearsed the law to the people that was
[31:12] the book of Deuteronomy it was a second
[31:14] time around amen
[31:15] a second time around the law let's go
[31:17] through this one more time let's
[31:19] rehearse where God's brought us and
[31:20] let's go over it that's what the book of
[31:22] Deuteronomy is so Deuteronomy 1 now
[31:25] verses 19 to 46 is Moses rehearsing what
[31:29] happened to the old generation at Kadesh
[31:32] Barnea but let's just go if we can
[31:35] diverse 29 so Deuteronomy 129 give me a
[31:39] minute as they get there you'd around me
[31:42] 129 I want to end at 32 that's the one I
[31:46] want to get to this is quite a thought
[31:50] here I want you to see this verse 29
[31:57] dude r129
[31:57] remember Moses at the end of his life
[31:59] he's rehearsing what happened at Kadesh
[32:02] Barnea years earlier then I said I knew
[32:04] you'd read not neither be afraid of them
[32:06] the Lord your God which goes before you
[32:08] he shall fight for you according to all
[32:11] that he did for you in Egypt before your
[32:13] eyes and in the wilderness where thou
[32:15] has seen how that the LORD thy God bare
[32:18] thee as a man doth bear a son in all the
[32:21] way that ye went until you came into
[32:22] this place yet in this thing he did not
[32:25] believe the Lord your God who went in
[32:28] the way before you to search you out a
[32:30] place to picture tension and fire by
[32:32] night to show you by what way he should
[32:35] go in a cloud by day and the Lord heard
[32:38] the voice of your words and was wroth
[32:40] and swear saying surely there shall not
[32:42] one of these men of this evil generation
[32:45] see the good land which I swear to give
[32:48] unto your father's save Caleb the son of
[32:50] Jephunneh he shall see it and to him
[32:53] will I give the land that he does I'm
[32:55] sorry that he hath trodden upon to his
[32:58] because yes wholly followed the Lord now
[33:02] 32 is what I wanted I was so striked
[33:04] when I heard this yeah and this thing
[33:06] you did not believe the Lord your God
[33:08] so Church fear shows a lack of faith
[33:13] praise the Lord
[33:14] very very simple but very powerful here
[33:17] the fact that they were scared of God of
[33:19] taking God's promise showed they didn't
[33:22] believe God to begin with praise the
[33:24] Lord Oh mine now many of these people
[33:27] they ended up dying in the wilderness
[33:28] right almost all of them except these
[33:30] two and then the new generation and
[33:31] remember the Bible said a mixed
[33:34] multitude left Egypt not and fear proved
[33:37] their fear at the very gates there we'd
[33:40] say the very the very doorway to go the
[33:43] promised land their fear right there
[33:44] show they never believed God in the
[33:47] first place I don't know about you but I
[33:48] want to have I want to show God my faith
[33:50] amen I don't want to be one who who
[33:52] shiza weigh in and then my fear shows I
[33:55] don't believe God I want to be one that
[33:57] can take a challenge upon because I know
[33:59] God's with me amen but if if we come to
[34:03] a spot and we you know people come to a
[34:06] spot and they can't overcome or they
[34:08] shrink away many times it's because they
[34:10] don't have faith to begin with they
[34:12] didn't believe in the first place we've
[34:14] all seen how many people come in here
[34:15] get baptized and a little you know they
[34:17] get a little persecution from their
[34:19] family or they get a little financial
[34:21] trial and they give up on God and that
[34:24] shows they didn't and then they fall
[34:25] away in the sin it shows they didn't
[34:27] believe in God in the first place right
[34:29] they never really had real faith or
[34:31] maybe he fell away like the seed fell by
[34:33] the wayside or fell upon the rocks they
[34:36] really didn't have the faith they didn't
[34:38] have the good heart like they needed to
[34:40] withstand and hold on to the faith I'll
[34:42] say like that the seed of God's Word so
[34:46] that's a very striking very important
[34:47] scriptures that you see that fears
[34:50] contagious fear keeps people from their
[34:52] destiny and fear shows they didn't
[34:55] believe in the first place many times
[34:57] especially in that case of Israel
[35:00] oh my important to see that next I want
[35:04] you to see another one I think
[35:09] also shows that someone is selfish many
[35:11] times they can be selfish they only
[35:15] think about themselves what a judge is
[35:16] seven let's go to judges seven here I
[35:18] think we can see that this is a selfish
[35:21] motive here instead of thinking about
[35:25] others fear makes us only think about
[35:28] ourselves in our own life and that's
[35:31] selfish because we all we think about is
[35:33] ourselves o'mine judges 7 verse 1 and
[35:42] remember the opposite of self selfish is
[35:45] selfless and that's the definition of
[35:46] love love think if not her own right
[35:49] first Corinthians 13 charity think it's
[35:51] not her own charity doesn't bond itself
[35:53] up charity serves other people hope saw
[35:56] and doers all right believes all charity
[35:59] is all about other people not just
[36:01] ourselves Amen now in verse two judges
[36:06] 72 and the Lord said unto Gideon the
[36:08] people that are with thee are too many
[36:10] for me to give the many nights in their
[36:12] hands lest Israel Vaught themselves
[36:14] against me saying mine own hand has
[36:16] saved me
[36:16] now therefore go to proclaim in the ears
[36:19] of the people say whosoever is fearful
[36:21] and afraid let him return and depart
[36:23] early from the mount gilead and their
[36:25] return to the people 20 and 2000 and
[36:27] they remained ten thousand so God says
[36:31] any one that God preaches through Gideon
[36:34] any one that's afraid leave right so it
[36:38] shows they were selfish they were
[36:40] thinking about themselves rather than
[36:41] the army praise God you ever see people
[36:44] like that they're not really in it for
[36:46] the cause of the group they're only in
[36:48] it for each other they're only in
[36:50] something for what they can get right
[36:52] they're only in it because well I'm
[36:54] going to get a reward at the end
[36:55] remember when those people follow Jesus
[36:57] member and they only went to foul Jesus
[37:00] because the food he gave him over that
[37:02] in John chapter 10 I believe it is the
[37:03] only when Jesus said you're only
[37:05] following me because of the food I'm
[37:07] giving you he said but the bread I'm
[37:09] giving you but he said I am the bread of
[37:11] life amen
[37:13] and Jesus cared about him he cared about
[37:15] their natural needs they were hungry he
[37:16] had compassion upon them but when it
[37:18] came down to it he knew they were only
[37:20] there for their own belly
[37:23] selfish instead of wanting to fight and
[37:26] die with the army
[37:27] well they say well I got a spare my life
[37:29] I need to I need to spare myself mine
[37:31] and it only thought about oneself now go
[37:36] to exodus for us again another example
[37:38] Moses in Exodus for all he could think
[37:41] about was himself so fear many times is
[37:45] selfish it keeps us from going into as
[37:48] we said our inheritance or we might say
[37:50] in more modern terms to get out of our
[37:52] comfort zone
[37:53] well I've only ever done this brother
[37:55] Jesse I can't go into something else or
[37:57] or brother sister so and so I could
[37:59] never do that I could never help you out
[38:01] because of this suit I couldn't help
[38:02] with the money or whatever I couldn't do
[38:05] this because I just I've never done that
[38:07] before and so it's selfish it actually
[38:10] limits what God wants to do through you
[38:12] amen
[38:13] we must be open to seeing what God wants
[38:15] more to do in us like I like I want to
[38:19] see what else God can do I see what God
[38:21] has done in me but I want to see what
[38:22] more you can do in me what else can he
[38:25] do praise God
[38:26] what else can I heal too so that God can
[38:28] use me I just don't do the same things
[38:30] over and over that's fine if they're
[38:31] good things but I want to see what more
[38:34] could God do amen
[38:35] what more does God want to use me for
[38:37] for his glory and I don't want to be
[38:39] selfish and say well I could never do
[38:40] that I could never have faith for that I
[38:42] want to be open to following the
[38:44] leadership of the Lord now in Exodus 4
[38:46] verse 10 let's go there you're familiar
[38:49] but let's look at it from this thought
[38:53] God had told him I'm gonna give you two
[38:55] signs but look at verse 10 and Moses
[38:57] sending the Lord
[38:58] oh my lord I'm not eloquent neither
[39:00] heretofore nor since thou has spoken
[39:03] unto thy servant but I'm slow of speech
[39:05] and of a slow tongue now Church God had
[39:08] just told him I'm gonna go with you plus
[39:10] I'm gonna give you two signs so he had
[39:13] three assurances already as if three
[39:16] wasn't enough three assurances I'm with
[39:20] you brother Adam and I'm giving you
[39:21] these two tools like I'm gonna do a job
[39:23] let's say we're into a job I'm with you
[39:25] Lydia and I'm gonna give you these two
[39:26] tools to do the job all that assurance
[39:29] and all she can think of is himself Oz
[39:33] he can think of he didn't even see how
[39:35] God had agree forgot
[39:36] got it equipped him and he looked at all
[39:38] just at himself we got a look at what
[39:41] God's equipped us with the Word of God
[39:43] had the message of the hour that's what
[39:45] God's equipped us with amen that's right
[39:48] so he looks at himself I'm slow speech
[39:51] I'm slow tongue and the Lord senator who
[39:53] hath made man's mouth I like that or who
[39:56] who make it the dumb or the deaf or the
[39:58] seeing or the blind have not I the Lord
[40:01] God made them this way now therefore go
[40:04] and I'll be with your mouth and teach
[40:06] the what now shout saying he said o my
[40:08] lord send I pray thee by the hand of him
[40:10] whom now will send and now God gets
[40:12] upset verse 14 he said law in other
[40:15] words just Lord just used whoever you
[40:17] want to send and gods aren't down like
[40:18] no I'm sending you not making excuse to
[40:22] stop being selfish stop looking at
[40:23] yourself look at the command I'm giving
[40:26] you praise God and the anger the Lord
[40:29] was kindled against Moses because he
[40:30] kept pushing off and say somebody else
[40:31] somebody else somebody else too selfish
[40:34] and he said is not hearing the Levite
[40:37] thy brother I know that he can speak
[40:38] well and also behold he cometh forth to
[40:40] meet thee and when he see at thee he
[40:42] will be glad in his heart okay and so
[40:45] God gives him Aaron because he's so
[40:47] afraid because he's so fearful God gives
[40:50] him Aaron to talk oh my look how look
[40:53] how look how wonderful God is look how
[40:56] he'll give us whatever we need to get
[40:57] the victory if God has a plan for our
[40:59] lives despite our fears my despite our
[41:03] excuses God is gonna get the job done
[41:05] amen
[41:06] despite our mistakes despite our fears
[41:08] despite our excuses despite how he
[41:10] equips us and yet we doubt it
[41:12] God is gonna get the job done that's a
[41:14] real encouragement amen hallelujah so we
[41:18] see that now fear can be selfish like
[41:20] with the 20 mm and Gideon's army or
[41:23] Moses all they can look at is themselves
[41:24] they can't look beyond themselves even
[41:27] to God's Bible we'd say or God's promise
[41:29] so we must not be selfish we must be
[41:31] selfless amen
[41:35] now we saw this already but I want to I
[41:39] want to go to this one again here fear
[41:44] makes a person useless in God's kingdom
[41:46] now we just saw it with judges 7 let's
[41:49] go to Matthew 20
[41:50] 525 I want to go back to this one at the
[41:53] 2525 fear makes people useless and God's
[41:57] kingdom I'm sure we'd all we all pressed
[42:01] out here on the Wednesday night I'm sure
[42:02] we'd all say Lord I want to be useful
[42:04] for your kingdom I want to be a useful
[42:06] tool that you can use Lord so if we want
[42:10] to be like that we got to be able to
[42:11] take we have to take the Word of God in
[42:14] our heart and act upon the Word of God
[42:16] like we like even tonight like example
[42:18] praying for Jose's friend there who's on
[42:20] who's off life support we just gotta we
[42:22] gotta take ahold of that we can't shriek
[42:24] back or try to say a prayer of faith we
[42:26] got to have faith amen we got to wake up
[42:29] the faith inside of us and use the faith
[42:30] that we have if God lets it come to pass
[42:32] praise the Lord but if not we can't back
[42:35] down in fear well I could never pray
[42:36] that prayer of faith we got to take God
[42:38] at His Word use the faith that we have
[42:41] now Matthew 25 25 and we're just want to
[42:45] rehearse this I think of course we're
[42:47] very familiar with it and you know I
[42:49] honestly don't know if this person is
[42:51] lost or not like I don't know if they go
[42:52] to hell or not because in other types
[42:55] brother branham uses or gnashing of
[42:58] teeth as the tribulation so I don't know
[43:00] if this is exactly person lost or not
[43:02] but remember this is where Jesus comes
[43:04] back and he asked the five talent man
[43:06] you know what are you done with my five
[43:08] talents the three talent man and now he
[43:10] comes to the one talent man now let's go
[43:13] up above that Malachi to verse 24 I'm
[43:17] sorry
[43:17] then he which had received the one
[43:19] talent came and said lord I knew that I
[43:21] knew thee that thou are in a hard man
[43:24] reaping where thou has not sown and
[43:27] gathering where thou has not straud I
[43:31] don't understand that because God is not
[43:33] a hard man I don't not sure about that I
[43:35] think this person had a misunderstanding
[43:36] of God to myself verse 25 and I was
[43:41] afraid and went and hid thy talent in
[43:43] the earth lo there thou hast that is
[43:47] thine so God gave him an amount of money
[43:51] and he was scared he was scared of the
[43:54] Lord for this reason he thought God
[43:58] reaped where he didn't sow so he thought
[44:00] God was unjust he thought God would just
[44:03] take from anybody
[44:04] and so he was scared to lose what God
[44:07] gave him right so he didn't invest in it
[44:09] he didn't go take it out and later Jesus
[44:11] says you at least should have took it to
[44:12] the bank to get interest you should at
[44:15] least got interest on this money he was
[44:17] too lazy or too scared to even do that
[44:20] right and so the Bible says later he hid
[44:26] god's talent now let me just stop here
[44:29] on my notes I put this
[44:30] some people will hide a desire to sing a
[44:33] song special and they'll never sing a
[44:34] song special some people will hide a
[44:37] desire to preach some people hide a
[44:40] desire to go witnessing even out on the
[44:43] streets like I was so encouraged brother
[44:44] Simon and brother Mike the guy in the
[44:46] wheelchair they went out in Toledo and
[44:48] sit on the corner and preached for two
[44:50] hours last Saturday night I was so
[44:52] encouraged by that I thought praise to
[44:53] the Lord there get there just so stirred
[44:56] up they got to do something I like that
[44:58] but some people instead of going to do
[45:01] that they'll hide that and they won't
[45:03] act upon what they know got if God give
[45:06] you ability let's say even financially
[45:08] God give you the money financially to
[45:09] help somebody out and they hide that say
[45:10] well if I give that I won't have
[45:12] anything else they hide the leading that
[45:16] God gives them can't understand what I'm
[45:17] saying
[45:18] they hide that leading you know what I
[45:21] heard a sermon and the examples some of
[45:23] the examples like people have a desire
[45:25] to teach Sunday school but they hide
[45:27] that talent
[45:28] see I couldn't I don't could never do
[45:30] that or I could never already have a
[45:32] tail I like to help the church out but
[45:34] I'm scared I'll mess up anything that
[45:38] God's called us to do if God's given us
[45:40] the word for then God will give us the
[45:42] ability to start it and finish it amen
[45:45] but we must not hide the talent God's
[45:50] given us the ability the desire he's
[45:53] he's got to do it I'll never forget when
[45:55] I first started to make videos for
[45:57] YouTube I was so scared what people are
[45:59] gonna think it was - that is our since
[46:03] 2006 brother Adam 2006 and I finally put
[46:06] out my first video in 2013 I was scared
[46:09] for most of those years for almost 6
[46:12] years but in 2012 when we were at
[46:14] Waterloo I started practicing videos and
[46:16] I started looking at how did the guy
[46:17] do this and how they and I was scared to
[46:19] stepping from the camera you can watch
[46:21] them some of my first videos I kind of
[46:22] look like I'm a little nervous because I
[46:24] was scared what would people say are
[46:25] they gonna drag my name in the dirt yeah
[46:27] I had a little bit of persecution but
[46:29] it's just very small and I was so scared
[46:33] what if I mess up on the video what if I
[46:35] mess up on the scriptures what if I mess
[46:37] up on this what if what are people gonna
[46:38] say I was so scared for numerous years I
[46:40] didn't do anything and finally I just
[46:42] said forget about it I've got to do
[46:43] something for God amen
[46:45] I just know I felt led to do this other
[46:47] people like brother Samuel here is here
[46:48] last time he said well Jesse I could
[46:50] never step in front of a camera I can
[46:52] never do that I'm thinking yeah you
[46:53] could now he might not be able to but in
[46:57] other words he recognized that it took
[46:59] some type of faith to do that and not
[47:01] only does it take faith it takes a lot
[47:02] of time to make those videos it takes a
[47:05] lot of time a lot of hours a lot of
[47:07] effort a lot of time that's why the
[47:08] Bible so you have to labor in the Word
[47:10] of God it's a work it's labor to sit
[47:13] there rightly divide and pray and say
[47:14] God lead me here or should I emphasize
[47:16] this or do that but God help me get out
[47:19] fear in 2013 and since then now we got
[47:22] almost 1,700 subscribers and a over 160
[47:27] thousand views praise God and that's
[47:29] just one example of where I was afraid
[47:30] to do it and but God gave me grace after
[47:33] prayer and waiting upon the Lord and
[47:35] taking a step and investing in something
[47:37] and God gave me and now I can see
[47:39] results from it Amen that's just a
[47:42] little testimony from my heart scared to
[47:44] do it and then did it all I was scared
[47:46] the first time I went preaching I
[47:47] remember I was so scared
[47:48] but I knew there's just I got to get up
[47:50] there and I'm glad I went by God's grace
[47:53] and other people are glad I've preached
[47:54] too because it's not me it's Christ in
[47:57] me with any gift any good because it's
[47:59] not my money it's his money it's not my
[48:02] preaching gift it's his preaching gift
[48:04] how you see that it's not me it's him
[48:06] Amen I just got to invest in that I've
[48:09] got to go work at it and I've got to put
[48:11] this money to use amen see it verse 27
[48:15] you oughta therefore to have put my
[48:17] money to the exchangers and then at my
[48:19] coming I should have received mine own
[48:21] with usury I could at least got some
[48:22] interest on that now take therefore the
[48:25] town for a man give it to the one with
[48:27] ten towns remember the Bible says if
[48:29] you're faithful little he'll make you
[48:30] ruler over
[48:32] he's going to take all the things all
[48:34] the rewards and other people lost all
[48:36] the responsibility right and the Bible
[48:39] said will rule over Nations remember
[48:40] that he's gonna take these nations away
[48:43] from these sinners and give it to the
[48:45] bride members and we are gonna rule over
[48:47] Nations I still can't get my head around
[48:49] that I still can't understand that but
[48:51] that's what Christ is gonna do if I'm
[48:54] faithful this little church and Jesus
[48:56] says well done well then I expect he'd
[48:58] make me ruler over something more
[48:59] because that's what His Word says we
[49:02] must be faithful and what God gives us
[49:04] and then he'll bless us at the end of it
[49:06] amen now okay there in his verse 30 and
[49:11] caste the unprofitable servant into
[49:13] outer darkness and there should be
[49:15] weeping and gnashing of teeth now he
[49:17] might just go through the I don't I
[49:19] don't know if he's saved or not it
[49:20] doesn't seem like a foolish virgin
[49:21] it seems really awful because of the way
[49:23] he talks way the way Christ talks about
[49:25] him it looks like he's lost but I would
[49:27] let you know there are scriptures where
[49:28] the tribulation talks about or the
[49:30] tribulation speaks of weeping and
[49:31] gnashing of teeth in the book of
[49:33] Revelation I know that because it's on
[49:34] one of the videos I'm gonna produce soon
[49:36] for the book of Revelation so I don't
[49:39] know if he saved her or not but let's
[49:41] say let's say he's lost right let's say
[49:45] he's lost that means someone can have a
[49:48] genuine gift of God as we know like
[49:50] Balaam and Judas and they can not invest
[49:53] in that gift and use it the right way if
[49:55] they misuse God's gift they can get to
[49:58] the spot where they're not even saved
[50:00] they never even receive salvation and
[50:02] what did that fear did that fear fear
[50:07] kept them from even getting saved fear
[50:09] kept them from even investing they hid
[50:12] the talent in the earth I remember what
[50:14] the earth represented carnality remember
[50:17] clay earth carnality met from sunday are
[50:20] you not yet carnal Paul said Envy
[50:22] strives divisions right exalting best
[50:25] preacher above that preacher that's
[50:27] carnal in the head and so he invest he
[50:30] takes his tail and he hides it in
[50:32] carnality he just lives a carnal life
[50:35] and just you know feeds his flesh and
[50:37] and meets the needs it just does what
[50:39] his body wants to do instead of what God
[50:41] called him to do amen we wonder what God
[50:44] called us to do
[50:45] now I want to look at a few more
[50:46] scriptures that go along with this now
[50:51] also remember I want to I got this one
[50:53] too but gifts of the Spirit
[50:55] you know like divine healing words of
[50:58] knowledge words of wisdom discernment
[50:59] right judging is the Spirit of God or
[51:02] not any of these gifts if they're buried
[51:04] in the earth that's the big time trouble
[51:06] you're getting in trouble of Jesus
[51:08] that's why we at some point we got to
[51:10] have gifts operating in the church you
[51:11] believe that I believe that vault my
[51:13] heart if we're all believers and we all
[51:15] got at least one gift or something like
[51:17] that then we want to see the operate at
[51:18] some time in the future by the grace of
[51:21] the Lord because we got to invest in
[51:23] that how do you mess in that gift pray
[51:25] about it
[51:25] amen pray about it pray about it and say
[51:28] God whatever gifts her in my life bring
[51:31] it out just let me live consecrated to
[51:33] you amen remember he said get duty said
[51:36] don't major on the gift major on getting
[51:38] love and then when you got love then God
[51:41] will automatically use your gifts so
[51:44] that's the thing we should just fall in
[51:45] love with Jesus more and more amen
[51:47] just find more ways to love and more
[51:50] reasons to love him and then God will
[51:51] begin using our gifts amen that's right
[51:54] that's right I believe that follow my
[51:56] heart now remember let's go to
[51:59] Revelation 21:8 let's read that one
[52:00] again so you're familiar with that one
[52:04] Revelation 21:8
[52:14] this was I meant me I mentioned this the
[52:15] first sermon but there will be people
[52:17] that will be lost all because of fear
[52:20] instead of having faith to be saved they
[52:23] chose to live a life of fear of God and
[52:26] this is the wrong fear and they'll be
[52:29] lost because lately they let fear rule
[52:31] their life instead of faith just like
[52:34] people will let adultery rule their
[52:36] lives instead of faith right they'll let
[52:39] money
[52:41] Mammon riches they'll let that rule
[52:43] their life instead of faith they'll
[52:45] never surrender to Christ and even have
[52:46] faith in Christ Jesus so this is one of
[52:49] them the very first one Jesus says this
[52:51] or the Bible says is but the fearful and
[52:53] unbelieving and abominable murderers
[52:55] whoremongers sorcerers and idolaters and
[52:57] all Liars shall have their part in the
[52:59] lake which burneth with fire and
[53:01] brimstone which is the second death now
[53:03] that sounds like weeping and burning and
[53:04] gnashing of teeth doesn't it oh my it
[53:08] sounds like that talent one talent man
[53:10] who had to get from God just hid it from
[53:13] everybody hid it from the world or hid
[53:15] it from the church he just put it in the
[53:16] world and was scared to use God's gift
[53:19] my so because of fear some people will
[53:25] go to hell that's right we can see that
[53:27] from the scripture so if I say like this
[53:29] fear not only is contagious but fear
[53:34] will destroy a man's soul right now what
[53:38] the scripture says the fearful fear
[53:40] being afraid of God and not surrendering
[53:43] to God and and not having any faith at
[53:45] all that will destroy a man so because
[53:47] it's unbelief amen
[53:48] it's unbelief in God's perfect plan the
[53:51] Bible said a fool shall not err in the
[53:54] way of salvation you remember that from
[53:55] Isaiah 35 a fool not err in that that's
[53:59] how wonderful this plan is that's how
[54:02] easy it is to understand the gospel amen
[54:04] even a fool can't get this wrong it's so
[54:08] easy to see Christ died for you trust in
[54:11] him believe in him one time I heard a
[54:13] man explain it like a parachute he said
[54:16] we're all in a plane the plane of the
[54:18] world and either this plane is going to
[54:21] crash or you can jump out but before you
[54:24] jump out what should you put on you
[54:26] better put on a parachute
[54:27] and that parachute is faith in Christ
[54:30] because the Bible said put you on the
[54:32] Lord Jesus Christ amen hallelujah but
[54:36] people won't put that on and then jump
[54:38] out and trust the Word of God that's
[54:40] been spoken but we can do that I jumped
[54:43] out a long time ago
[54:44] I jumped out about 18 years ago
[54:46] hallelujah I took my jacket my parachute
[54:48] of faith and I jumped out and some I'm
[54:50] leaving the things of the world I'm
[54:52] leaving this plane that's bomb for
[54:53] destruction and I'm gonna jump out and
[54:55] I'm gonna sail down in the skies of the
[54:58] grace of God and I'm gonna land softly
[55:00] in God's kingdom amen that's right I'm
[55:03] trusting in Christ my faith is in Christ
[55:06] he's locked around me in other words
[55:08] he's sealed in me I'll say it like that
[55:10] amen but see people will stay in the
[55:15] plane because they're scared the
[55:16] parachute won't work they're scared it
[55:19] won't come out did you ever jump out of
[55:20] a plane brother Adam no okay I never did
[55:22] it either
[55:23] my aunt has my tad sixties maybe I
[55:28] shouldn't say her age but my aunt's in
[55:30] her 60s and she's jumped out of planes I
[55:32] just haven't had the time or opportunity
[55:34] but I like to do that someday
[55:36] but yeah you have to have faith to do
[55:39] that you got to trust the parachute but
[55:42] see people in this natural case it's
[55:45] really easy to see people won't jump out
[55:46] because they're afraid now my mother
[55:49] lost a me when she was here she's dumped
[55:50] out of the plane but she had a
[55:52] specialist strapped to her back
[55:53] that's just like Jesus though she's got
[55:56] a person who's specially trained we've
[55:59] got somebody who's done it before amen
[56:01] glory because Christ took all of the
[56:03] father's words at his word and believed
[56:06] all the father's word amen and he jumped
[56:09] out so far hallelujah that he fell all
[56:11] the way down to hell and then came back
[56:12] up yeah by the grace of God by the
[56:16] promise of God amen
[56:18] that's right but those that are fearful
[56:21] are gonna stay in the play that's why
[56:22] our children you know we never know when
[56:24] a service will be when these children
[56:26] will give their hearts to the Lord and
[56:28] our faith should encourage their faith
[56:31] they should look over and be able to see
[56:32] us raise our hands or praying or
[56:34] worshiping God or a mending the Word of
[56:36] God and our love for Christ should be
[56:39] contagious to them
[56:41] hey man and they should be able to leave
[56:43] their fear and now I've talked to some
[56:44] of my little children they say well I'm
[56:46] scared if I get baptized everybody's
[56:47] gonna be looking at me right and we how
[56:51] many can relate to that I can relate to
[56:52] that when I first got saved children I
[56:54] was scared to raise my hands even I was
[56:57] so scared but as time went by I first I
[57:00] started like this then I could go a
[57:03] little higher and now I can go like this
[57:07] and praise the Lord you know just I'm
[57:10] just reading the spirit I know God loves
[57:12] me and I love him amen
[57:14] I don't do this for show I do it because
[57:15] I'm free and I have liberty in Christ
[57:18] Jesus and nobody can take my liberty
[57:20] amen
[57:21] I'm free in Christ but yordan even them
[57:25] our love for God should create such an
[57:27] atmosphere that they should want to fall
[57:29] into the love and then they won't be
[57:31] scared about God I believe that we never
[57:36] know we want to just be full of love and
[57:38] we want to be full of faith and cast out
[57:40] all the fear praise God that we can
[57:42] trust in the Word of God if we jump if
[57:45] we jump into Christ
[57:45] he's gonna open Amen he's gonna open to
[57:48] us he's gonna protect us amen now let's
[57:51] go to mark 5:15 here's another people
[57:57] that seem like they'll probably get the
[57:58] same destiny as this talent one town man
[58:00] here remember was the people of God the
[58:03] gadarenes remember this
[58:07] can you imagine mark 5:15 you imagine
[58:10] the the God and healer of heaven and
[58:14] earth comes down to your country and he
[58:17] casts out all the Legion of demons and
[58:20] does the greatest miracle probably this
[58:23] the city has ever seen and instead of
[58:25] rallying around this gift they get
[58:27] scared and say get out of here this is
[58:31] ass and Jesus said woe unto these cities
[58:36] now this is an example where fear will
[58:40] drive people to reject Christ and I
[58:42] believe if they didn't repent of course
[58:43] they would have went to hell this is a
[58:44] good example of the fearful they're
[58:47] scared of this power like brother
[58:49] Branham said I chopped it up a little
[58:52] bit but he said they'd rather have their
[58:54] they're dirty filthy stinking pigs
[58:56] they'd rather have the dirty filthy
[58:57] stinking pigs and have the Lord Jesus
[59:00] Christ and how many people say they'd
[59:02] rather have the dirty filthy stinking
[59:04] movies or drugs or alcohol right or
[59:06] gossip or money they'd rather have the
[59:08] dirty stinking money and all these
[59:09] things then have the purity of the Lord
[59:11] Jesus Christ
[59:12] bye and what did it fear did it
[59:16] fear let's read that mark 5:15 and they
[59:19] came to Jesus and see him that was
[59:21] possessed with the devil and had the
[59:23] Legion sitting and clothed and in his
[59:25] right mind and they were afraid right
[59:29] and what do they do next they sent him
[59:31] away they said get out of our land we'd
[59:33] rather have the pigs and the demons than
[59:35] we'd have the Lord Jesus Christ
[59:37] see how fear see how powerful fears fear
[59:40] will destroy people's souls that's why
[59:45] that's one of those examples the fearful
[59:47] will not inherit the kingdom of God my
[59:51] so fear destroys a man's soul fears
[59:56] contagious makes a person uses in the
[59:58] kingdom of God makes a person selfish
[1:00:01] and one of them too with the judges we
[1:00:04] could have said that to fear makes you
[1:00:06] isolated right because those soldiers
[1:00:08] left the rest of their army right it
[1:00:11] isolates them from the real army of God
[1:00:13] and what causes people to leave church
[1:00:15] many times fear well I wonder what
[1:00:17] they're well if I come back the brothers
[1:00:19] gonna preach on me well if I could if I
[1:00:22] come back everybody's gonna look down
[1:00:23] upon me I come back I've got a face
[1:00:26] brother so-and-so er I've gotta face
[1:00:28] this or so and so on and I don't want
[1:00:29] any confrontation what keeps them away
[1:00:32] from the army of God
[1:00:33] fear does fear isolates them well I
[1:00:35] could never face this person again or I
[1:00:37] could never trust this person again what
[1:00:39] does it fear does it not the effects of
[1:00:44] fear Church my goodness let's do it one
[1:00:49] more here Matthew 25:41 let's go there
[1:00:53] Matthew 25:41 this is familiar again but
[1:00:56] I just want to bring out these I'm just
[1:00:57] looking at different angles here tonight
[1:00:58] maybe nothing new I just want to bring
[1:01:01] this on a different angle Matthew 25:41
[1:01:04] this is of course this is the goats
[1:01:08] or the people likening the goats on the
[1:01:09] left hand of Jesus remember and we see
[1:01:14] here the reasons that they don't receive
[1:01:17] eternal life
[1:01:21] okay verse 41 then shall he say also
[1:01:23] unto them on the left hand depart from
[1:01:25] me you cursed into everlasting fire
[1:01:27] prepared for the devil and his angels
[1:01:29] for I was a hungered and he gave me no
[1:01:33] meat I was thirsty and you gave me no
[1:01:35] drink so as we go think about these
[1:01:38] giving somebody food giving them a drink
[1:01:41] number 43
[1:01:43] I was a stranger and he took me not in
[1:01:45] so shelter giving somebody shelter naked
[1:01:49] and he clothes me not giving somebody
[1:01:50] clothes sick and in prison and you
[1:01:54] visited me not so visiting the sick and
[1:01:56] those in prison just those five things
[1:01:59] Church just those five things and we
[1:02:02] know the story when did we when did we
[1:02:03] see you and they said well when you did
[1:02:05] it not to Lysa these my brother now I'm
[1:02:07] just bringing out the possibility fear
[1:02:09] could have kept these people from not
[1:02:11] doing these things especially in
[1:02:13] countries of the persecution right oh
[1:02:14] I'm a Muslim but if I do something nice
[1:02:16] for a Christian I'm fearful what they'll
[1:02:18] do to me
[1:02:19] see that see how fear could keep
[1:02:21] somebody from doing that if I if I
[1:02:23] invite somebody into my house Oh what
[1:02:25] could they do
[1:02:25] well they might do something bad or the
[1:02:27] angels of God might protect you right I
[1:02:30] mean right that's what we see here oh if
[1:02:32] I give my money if I give my clothes
[1:02:34] I want might not have anymore I'm scared
[1:02:36] I might not have anymore well there's
[1:02:38] fear and that's fear like cripples a
[1:02:42] man's soul right it cripples men and
[1:02:43] women's souls we know that there's
[1:02:48] another one it destroys the soul fear
[1:02:52] feeds other bad behaviors even racism go
[1:02:56] to Galatians 2:12 remember this one I
[1:03:00] preached on go I please preach the
[1:03:02] series on Galatians into in 2015 so most
[1:03:05] people probably remember but Galatians
[1:03:07] 2:12 I don't know if you did that I
[1:03:09] preached through the whole book remember
[1:03:11] Peter rebukes I'm sorry Paul rebukes
[1:03:15] Peter to the face why because Peter
[1:03:18] stopped eating with the Gentiles he
[1:03:21] showing a form of racism how many know
[1:03:23] racism's live and well today like with
[1:03:26] Charlottesville and all these evil
[1:03:27] things happening racism is alive and
[1:03:29] well in Peters case what fed his racism
[1:03:36] was fear he was scared look at the
[1:03:40] scripture for before that certain came
[1:03:43] from James he did eat with the Gentiles
[1:03:45] when they were come he withdrew and
[1:03:47] separated himself fearing them which
[1:03:49] were of the circumcision he was so
[1:03:51] scared of what the Jews what would the
[1:03:53] Jews think if I eat with the Gentiles he
[1:03:56] was so afraid he stopped eating with
[1:03:57] Christians who were all washed by the
[1:03:59] same blood of Jesus Christ so this is a
[1:04:03] form of racism right and what if people
[1:04:07] can have racism they I'm scared I I
[1:04:08] never talked to African American before
[1:04:11] I never talked to an Asian before I
[1:04:14] never talked to a Spaniard or Mexican I
[1:04:17] never I never ate with a Spanish person
[1:04:20] before I never and God's give us a nice
[1:04:23] good bouquet of Nations amen here so we
[1:04:26] appreciate that we love that but we
[1:04:28] shouldn't be scared to be with any
[1:04:30] believer now his was because of all you
[1:04:33] know they're unclean you know so maybe
[1:04:35] some carryover from the Old Testament
[1:04:37] but either way fear led his segregation
[1:04:42] right like just like we talked about so
[1:04:45] fear will lead to other behaviors that
[1:04:46] aren't maybe so evil on the outside
[1:04:48] Peter has already filled the Holy Ghost
[1:04:50] Church he wasn't gonna lose his soul but
[1:04:53] he was gonna lose his fellowship with
[1:04:55] the Saints and Paul rebuked him to his
[1:04:58] face and said you're to be blamed the
[1:05:00] body of Christ should have no division
[1:05:02] because of fear we should all be one
[1:05:04] body so feared Rome to say I can't eat
[1:05:07] with you I'm sorry can enough knew with
[1:05:09] you I'm scared with the other I'm Sarah
[1:05:11] with these other brothers are gonna say
[1:05:13] I'm gonna scared they're not gonna
[1:05:14] invite me back I'm scared they're gonna
[1:05:15] speak about me
[1:05:16] let him speak about you be full of love
[1:05:19] amen let's not be full of fear
[1:05:21] why did Pilate crucify Jesus because he
[1:05:24] feared the Jews the Bible says feared
[1:05:27] the Jews a member his wife was so scared
[1:05:30] member she sent through the messenger
[1:05:31] saying have nothing to do with him so
[1:05:33] that fear fed from his wife all the way
[1:05:35] to him so the Jews there and then pilots
[1:05:39] wife all fed and see how that fear is
[1:05:41] contagious led to some awful decisions
[1:05:43] we must never act by fear unless it's
[1:05:45] the right kind of fear reverence but let
[1:05:49] us not act by fear the evil spirit of
[1:05:52] fear now go to Titus 1:9 here's another
[1:05:58] one where preachers especially are
[1:06:02] supposed to be able to overcome fear in
[1:06:05] order to keep fear from spreading in the
[1:06:08] church so let me just read this so this
[1:06:11] is something I I should be expected to
[1:06:15] do if somebody comes in here with false
[1:06:17] doctrine somebody tries to spread false
[1:06:20] doctrine we should all try to help the
[1:06:23] person who's off the word but especially
[1:06:24] the preacher has to stand there and not
[1:06:27] be afraid and has to stand there maybe
[1:06:30] talk to the person and pull them out or
[1:06:32] something like that if whenever there's
[1:06:34] a false doctrine being taught okay
[1:06:41] look at verse 9 the speaking of elders
[1:06:44] or bishops which we know as pastors
[1:06:46] Bishop means overseer the pastor
[1:06:49] oversees the flock holding fast the
[1:06:52] faithful word as he has been taught that
[1:06:53] he may be able by sound doctrine both to
[1:06:55] exhort and convince the gainsayers so
[1:06:59] Evers gainsaying whoever's trying to
[1:07:01] draw people with false doctrine the
[1:07:04] pastor has to stand there and show how
[1:07:06] they're wrong and convinced him that
[1:07:08] they're wrong he can't be afraid and say
[1:07:10] well this person is the richest person
[1:07:12] we got in the church better not say
[1:07:13] anything against their faith he's the
[1:07:16] biggest type err she's the biggest tithe
[1:07:18] fair whoever is bringing the false word
[1:07:23] the pastor must stand there and speak
[1:07:25] against it verse 10 for there are many
[1:07:28] unruly and vain talkers and deceivers
[1:07:30] especially the circumcision in this case
[1:07:33] in this century was the Jews whose
[1:07:36] mouths must be stopped who subvert whole
[1:07:38] houses teaching things which they ought
[1:07:40] not for filthy lucre sake look at this
[1:07:43] look at this doctrine here look at the
[1:07:45] doctrine whose mouths must be stopped
[1:07:47] I'm sorry already pretty say that okay
[1:07:49] one of themselves even a prophet of
[1:07:51] their own said the cretians are always
[1:07:53] liars evil beasts and slow bellies and
[1:07:56] look what Paul says this witness is true
[1:07:59] did you catch that a prophet a prophet
[1:08:03] prophesied that these cretians those who
[1:08:06] live in Crete these Jews that live in
[1:08:08] Crete the Prophet said thus saith the
[1:08:09] Lord
[1:08:10] these are liars evil beasts and slow
[1:08:12] bellies and Paul said he was true see
[1:08:17] how the Holy Ghost will sometimes call
[1:08:18] some pretty harsh names right that's why
[1:08:21] we got to be humble but not too humble
[1:08:25] right Church
[1:08:26] this is apostolic and how many believe
[1:08:28] we got the faith of the Apostolic
[1:08:30] fathers sometimes preachers got to call
[1:08:32] things black and white right can't be
[1:08:37] scared and that's why I never by God's
[1:08:39] grace I never try to come up here and
[1:08:40] purposely preach on anybody or anything
[1:08:42] but if I'm under the anointing and I
[1:08:44] just feel out of the Lord and I've got
[1:08:45] such Liberty I may have to call off some
[1:08:47] certain things that I don't I don't know
[1:08:49] Mert necessarily wouldn't do but I
[1:08:51] believe if it's the right motivation
[1:08:53] it's the same spirit that did this that
[1:08:56] stood up to these sinners and stood
[1:08:58] against the false doctrine stood against
[1:09:01] the fleshly desires and had to call
[1:09:03] black black and white white the
[1:09:05] preachers have to do that they have to
[1:09:07] stand there brother cam last week had
[1:09:10] two people visit his church that are
[1:09:12] going around the nation now to all these
[1:09:14] message churches accusing any using all
[1:09:18] these people false doctrine and brother
[1:09:19] cam said he had to stand out there in
[1:09:22] the vestibule while everybody and
[1:09:23] visitors are watching and these brothers
[1:09:25] are telling cam and his family they're
[1:09:27] going to be lost
[1:09:28] and perish because of certain things we
[1:09:30] believe we believe the same things and
[1:09:33] brother cam had to stand there and with
[1:09:34] stand them and God it was a great
[1:09:37] testimony maybe cameltoe when he comes
[1:09:39] but cam was so humble but yet so firm
[1:09:41] he said if I'm wrong and I got the wrong
[1:09:43] spirit let's go in there and pray and
[1:09:44] you pray the devil off me that's the
[1:09:47] right spirit the brother said oh no no
[1:09:49] no no and so see that proof cam have the
[1:09:51] right spirit because if you had the
[1:09:52] wrong one he was willing to get it off
[1:09:54] and that's what a real Christian is if
[1:09:56] I'm wrong I want to know I'm wrong if
[1:10:00] I'm wrong in a sermon meat knock on my
[1:10:02] door after the service
[1:10:03] or meet me out there if I'm wrong I want
[1:10:05] to know I'm wrong like on Monday morning
[1:10:09] I had an email at 8 a.m. that said
[1:10:10] brother Jesse I didn't really agree with
[1:10:13] your teaching on the earrings on Sunday
[1:10:15] remember I taught on the earrings and
[1:10:17] it's not even a person in our church a
[1:10:18] wonderful godly person but I just had to
[1:10:22] watch that I just had to watch that and
[1:10:25] I had to explain to the dear person
[1:10:27] maybe they're watching tonight praise
[1:10:28] the Lord and then I explained a dear
[1:10:30] person my life and our life speak that
[1:10:36] we would never even wear clip-on
[1:10:38] earrings but if my example was if a
[1:10:41] woman came out of the world or a woman
[1:10:44] just came out of the denomination's it
[1:10:46] came to the church and she's wearing
[1:10:47] clip-on earrings
[1:10:48] I cannot condemn that by the Word of God
[1:10:50] because the Bible doesn't condemn that
[1:10:53] the Bible condemns when you make a mark
[1:10:55] on your body and bore holes in your ears
[1:10:58] that's what the Bible condemns praise
[1:11:00] the Lord that's the story I'm giving
[1:11:03] right and I'm trying to teach the Word
[1:11:07] of God what you see we have to be able
[1:11:11] to give answers praise God amen we have
[1:11:14] to be able to give answers but I said of
[1:11:16] course you know I believe brother
[1:11:17] branham's example you know we don't we
[1:11:20] don't wear we don't wear clip-ons and I
[1:11:22] would hope if a sister came in the
[1:11:24] church and she wore clip-ons for a while
[1:11:25] pretty soon she look at our sisters and
[1:11:27] she look at our sisters and see oh they
[1:11:29] don't wear earrings well I guess I don't
[1:11:31] have to either
[1:11:32] did you know brother hos they got me
[1:11:35] that generations book did you know Billy
[1:11:37] Paul branham's second wife Boyce she
[1:11:42] wore pants the whole time after she got
[1:11:44] saved and married to Billy Paul and
[1:11:45] brother Branham and his wife never
[1:11:47] rebuked them never starting every buked
[1:11:49] her until the Holy Spirit brought it to
[1:11:51] her attention one day and said huh and
[1:11:53] this is years after she been going to
[1:11:54] the tabernacle they never come out and
[1:11:57] said you Bob you Bominable woman and
[1:11:59] that's part of her testimony to read the
[1:12:01] testimony now brother Branham of course
[1:12:03] would blast it from the pulpit but in
[1:12:06] private he wouldn't just you know in a
[1:12:08] prideful way rebuke her he would just
[1:12:11] you know love her and just be kind and
[1:12:13] everything and she said that was what
[1:12:15] taught her so much about love
[1:12:17] you that's rebuke from the pulpit but if
[1:12:19] somebody doesn't know you have to feel
[1:12:21] led to go rebuke them right just don't
[1:12:24] go in different and rebuke anybody and
[1:12:25] put your finger under everybody's nose
[1:12:27] it's wrong and make yourself the Big
[1:12:29] Shot right you got to have wisdom on how
[1:12:31] to correct people and that's one example
[1:12:33] that's what I was using with the woman
[1:12:35] with if a woman who come in here with
[1:12:36] clip-ons I would let our love speak
[1:12:38] louder than our arrogance and God
[1:12:42] hopefully we don't by God's grace we
[1:12:43] don't have any arrogance separate I
[1:12:45] understand that by the grace of Lord a
[1:12:47] pastor has to rightly divide these
[1:12:48] things and stay with the Word of God
[1:12:50] stay with the word of truth
[1:12:52] hope that's understandable to you by the
[1:12:54] grace of Lord so see Titus basically
[1:12:56] shows that pastors can't be afraid
[1:12:58] they've got to be able to stand on the
[1:13:00] Word of God and tell the truth because
[1:13:04] the Word of God is unfailing the Word of
[1:13:07] God is forever settled in heaven amen
[1:13:10] okay let me get closing here I got okay
[1:13:13] 17 more minutes that'd be an hour okay
[1:13:18] so fear allow sin to spread if the
[1:13:20] pastor doesn't stop the false doctrine
[1:13:22] or doesn't stop it it'll spread because
[1:13:25] a little leaven leavens the whole lump
[1:13:27] so preachers should be able to stand up
[1:13:30] and give answers like that one time when
[1:13:32] we had a family leave the church and
[1:13:33] left the message I went over there and I
[1:13:35] took every question for three hours
[1:13:37] straight from a family that shot
[1:13:38] everything they had about brother
[1:13:39] Branham for three hours I just sat there
[1:13:41] and just took the questions and gave my
[1:13:43] answers gave the Bible gave the Bible
[1:13:45] now I left feeling like I won the debate
[1:13:47] by God's grace that's how I felt they
[1:13:49] might have felt different but see I'm
[1:13:52] standing there taking their hardest
[1:13:53] questions and their criticisms and stand
[1:13:55] there and hold the truth and not be
[1:13:57] afraid of that but be able to take it on
[1:13:59] and know that the Holy Spirit will give
[1:14:00] me the words to say in the hour that I
[1:14:02] need it amen now remember this one job
[1:14:09] let's go back to job the Bible said the
[1:14:12] thing that he feared came upon him and
[1:14:16] let me find that scripture real quick I
[1:14:18] didn't ever written down yeah job 3:25
[1:14:20] there it is job 325 and I want to read
[1:14:25] you the quote from perfect faith where
[1:14:27] brother BAM talks about this remember I
[1:14:29] used the words prophetic fears
[1:14:31] prophetic kind of because it's that idea
[1:14:33] of there's life and death in the power
[1:14:35] of the tongue whatever spirit your a
[1:14:37] little Creator whatever spirit you allow
[1:14:39] and say out loud that's what's gonna
[1:14:40] happen Branham says it plainly in
[1:14:44] perfect faith let's read the scripture
[1:14:46] again job 3:25 for the thing which I
[1:14:49] greatly feared has come upon me and that
[1:14:52] which I was afraid of is come up unto me
[1:14:56] all right so there's job all right now I
[1:15:05] went back to chapter one I don't know if
[1:15:11] chapter one is an example of fear but
[1:15:13] member job said this he said it may be
[1:15:15] that my sons have sinned and cursed God
[1:15:18] in their hearts thus did job continually
[1:15:19] I don't know if that's the fear I don't
[1:15:21] know if job said that in fear or just in
[1:15:23] love I don't know but the Bible said he
[1:15:28] feared it whatever happened to him
[1:15:30] losing his money losing his cattle
[1:15:32] you're losing his family whatever he
[1:15:34] feared it actually came upon him
[1:15:38] now here's what mother Bram said in the
[1:15:42] book of Job Brougham said it says here
[1:15:43] job feared and what he feared it
[1:15:45] actually happened what brought it
[1:15:49] brother Ram said his fear so stop right
[1:15:52] there what made that whirlwind come and
[1:15:55] it caused him to lose all of his cattle
[1:15:57] and all his family fear joel must had a
[1:16:00] fear in the back of his heart I'm gonna
[1:16:02] lose my job I'm gonna lose my money I'm
[1:16:05] gonna lose my home I'm gonna lose all my
[1:16:07] children he had that fear and mother and
[1:16:11] said it happened because of that
[1:16:13] remember remember I brought this out I
[1:16:15] just said this briefly I don't know if
[1:16:16] you remember remember when God saw it he
[1:16:19] said job's a perfect man because God
[1:16:22] always looks at our end condition God
[1:16:24] doesn't see our sin necessarily right he
[1:16:27] looks at our finished product because
[1:16:29] the Bible said whoever God is justified
[1:16:30] he's already glorified God sees us in
[1:16:33] our final condition so even though so
[1:16:36] it's quite a thought there kind of
[1:16:38] thought even though God's almas and
[1:16:41] condition in the in the in time and
[1:16:43] space
[1:16:44] allowed this to come to pass whatever
[1:16:47] Joe feared he allowed to come upon him
[1:16:49] as a test but it was his fear that
[1:16:52] brought it brother May I'm said but
[1:16:53] madam said that's what made it happen
[1:16:55] now listen this his faith would have
[1:16:58] kept him from it but his fear brought it
[1:17:01] to him his faith would have kept him
[1:17:07] from going through this but his fear
[1:17:11] brought this upon him Wow and Joe was a
[1:17:15] model he was the model example of what
[1:17:17] patience in the Bible so because he was
[1:17:21] he was weak in fear right he had the
[1:17:23] weakness of fear God allowed him to go
[1:17:26] through all these tests at the end of it
[1:17:28] God brought out a greater patience in
[1:17:30] his life by taking all the fear out of
[1:17:32] his life so what that tells us whatever
[1:17:36] weakness is in us God's gonna let it
[1:17:38] play out so it finally gets driven out
[1:17:40] of our lives right like the nation's
[1:17:42] being driven out of Canaan and then at
[1:17:44] the end we'll have a mighty testimony at
[1:17:46] the end of it just like Moses you know
[1:17:50] Moses had to get all of his fear driven
[1:17:52] out of him right and then now then when
[1:17:54] the Bible say he was the meekest man on
[1:17:56] the earth praise the Lord look at Joe
[1:18:00] look at no Moses they're different
[1:18:02] weaknesses but they all had to be driven
[1:18:05] out in order to produce the right kind
[1:18:07] of character Wow brother Ram said that
[1:18:10] his faith would have kept him from it so
[1:18:12] just Joe would have had a little more
[1:18:13] faith he went out a lost his children
[1:18:16] that way think of that church think of
[1:18:18] that right he was scared it was going to
[1:18:23] happen and it did happen brother branham
[1:18:25] said now if he'd been if he'd knowed it
[1:18:29] wouldn't have happened it wouldn't
[1:18:30] happen see what I mean Church I wonder
[1:18:34] how much has happened in our lives
[1:18:35] because we were scared of it I wonder
[1:18:38] and I wonder about other people I wonder
[1:18:40] how much they fear that's actually
[1:18:41] happened to them but I don't say the
[1:18:43] other side I wonder how much has it
[1:18:45] happened because of our faith I like to
[1:18:48] think about I wonder how much God has
[1:18:51] kept you and I from because we just
[1:18:53] believe God's Word amen glory just
[1:18:57] because
[1:18:58] believe his word and I'm not gonna be
[1:19:00] afraid I'm just gonna believe God's Word
[1:19:01] I wonder how much God has kept this from
[1:19:03] a man looking brother have said if
[1:19:07] you're afraid when you come by the
[1:19:08] prayer line maybe I just having out the
[1:19:10] faith it'll never happen he said don't
[1:19:12] worry it'll never happen but if you know
[1:19:15] it's going to happen it'll happen see
[1:19:18] it's a substance of something Jobe had a
[1:19:20] fear that these things would come upon
[1:19:22] him and they did if you have a fear that
[1:19:24] your disease is going to leave you it
[1:19:25] won't leave you but if you have faith it
[1:19:28] will leave you amen in that beautiful
[1:19:31] church
[1:19:31] - striking so in other words Jobe had
[1:19:36] already played that thought through oh
[1:19:38] this is what it's like this is what its
[1:19:41] gonna be like to lose all my money this
[1:19:42] sort of be it's gonna be like to lose my
[1:19:44] children and to lose my health I'm I've
[1:19:48] always been scared I'm gonna get boils
[1:19:49] you see that that's what he was thinking
[1:19:51] the whole time some of these times right
[1:19:53] I wonder I'm probably gonna get boils
[1:19:55] I'm probably gonna have this and then it
[1:19:57] actually happened there's another
[1:20:00] example
[1:20:00] Peter sank in the water because the
[1:20:03] Bible said he got afraid the very thing
[1:20:07] he feared was what happened and that
[1:20:11] powerful a simple but powerful Peters
[1:20:14] fear of sinking brought it upon him and
[1:20:17] made him sink right and motor Anderson
[1:20:20] you ask any metal medical doctor
[1:20:22] the first thing we'll try to get you to
[1:20:24] do is to have confidence in the medicine
[1:20:26] he's giving you if you haven't got no
[1:20:28] confidence in it you better leave it
[1:20:30] alone sure see what is it then it's
[1:20:32] faith that does the healing it's faith
[1:20:35] that does it all the time amen
[1:20:37] faith caused him to walk on water but
[1:20:39] then unbelief and fear caused him to
[1:20:41] sink it's faith that keeps us up on the
[1:20:46] water all the time amen I had a man one
[1:20:50] time tell me he said you said preaching
[1:20:53] that loud and preaching that much and
[1:20:54] clapping that loud he said you won't
[1:20:56] last one year bless his heart I've
[1:20:59] lasted thirteen years of preaching
[1:21:01] preaching that loud and being enthused
[1:21:04] about the Lord Jesus Christ he said you
[1:21:05] won't last one year he told me to my
[1:21:07] face I just laugh I just kind of chuckle
[1:21:09] I'd already been doing it like six or
[1:21:10] seven years
[1:21:12] see he's trying to plant fear in your
[1:21:14] life and he said your parents are gonna
[1:21:15] I'm sorry your children gonna hate you
[1:21:17] and they're not gonna love you for
[1:21:18] preaching that way and and I even walked
[1:21:20] out of church that night my children
[1:21:21] come up and give me all these hugs and
[1:21:23] tell me they love me what is that fear
[1:21:25] he's trying to get fear into my heart
[1:21:27] and say oh if you preach that hard
[1:21:30] everybody's gonna be every is gonna hate
[1:21:31] you and you won't meet you're gonna wear
[1:21:33] yourself out and none of its come to
[1:21:35] pass but what if I would accepted that
[1:21:37] box the rattlesnakes what if I took that
[1:21:40] box of rattlesnakes I might have get
[1:21:42] worn out I might have thought my
[1:21:44] children my children - are hating me but
[1:21:46] we must stand for God's Word and cast
[1:21:48] everything else aside and don't walk in
[1:21:51] fear walk in faith amen we have to walk
[1:21:54] in faith we gotta have confidence in
[1:21:56] what we're doing
[1:21:56] amen praise the Lord
[1:22:03] let me find a place to close here yeah
[1:22:04] I'm close here all right nine minutes I
[1:22:06] got all these different points I want to
[1:22:08] make this is probably I think I can
[1:22:12] bring this down right here let's close
[1:22:14] with David because if you want to know
[1:22:16] meekness you look at Moses is life if
[1:22:19] you know patience look at job's life
[1:22:21] right if you know everything look at
[1:22:24] Jesus's life but if you want to know
[1:22:26] faith conquering fear you can look at
[1:22:30] David's life so let's look at David just
[1:22:33] briefly as we close I know we've already
[1:22:34] heard this many many times but let's
[1:22:36] look at it from this angle
[1:22:39] David had to overcome fear and my last
[1:22:43] point is that fear paralyzes people
[1:22:46] remember I said that earlier fear will
[1:22:49] literally paralyze someone so they won't
[1:22:52] do anything for God's kind of like the
[1:22:53] man with the talent there's kind of
[1:22:55] another way to say that fear paralyze
[1:22:58] the army of Israel that they didn't do
[1:23:00] anything for 40 days can you imagine me
[1:23:03] on the battlefield I can't imagine this
[1:23:05] forty days and not doing anything forty
[1:23:09] days that's a month in 10 days right
[1:23:11] thirty days forty days doing nothing
[1:23:14] just paralyzed with fear I would think
[1:23:18] like once you ask yourself sometime am I
[1:23:19] even a soldier like what what am i doing
[1:23:22] I'm not
[1:23:22] I don't even fireman fought one person
[1:23:25] forty days in a battle and nothing
[1:23:27] happening and that's just what Satan
[1:23:29] wanted
[1:23:30] he just wanted an army that doesn't use
[1:23:32] their swords right but we're an army who
[1:23:35] uses the Word of God we have to use the
[1:23:39] Word of God
[1:23:40] that's just what Satan one don't quote
[1:23:41] the word for a whole month just sit back
[1:23:44] in and don't don't fight the battle for
[1:23:46] a whole month basically that's what he's
[1:23:48] saying
[1:23:49] forty days Goliath came two times a day
[1:23:52] for 40 days and paralyzed the people
[1:23:56] even paralyzed saw who was head and
[1:23:58] shoulders above everybody else now let's
[1:24:01] look at this here I just wanna look at a
[1:24:03] few so let's go to 1st Samuel 17 I just
[1:24:05] read a few scriptures here
[1:24:07] verse 11 first time in 1711 all right
[1:24:17] First Samuel 17 11 all right
[1:24:25] let's read that it says when Saul and
[1:24:27] all Israel heard those words of the
[1:24:29] Philistine they were dismayed and
[1:24:30] greatly afraid I remember when I
[1:24:33] preached on this if anybody should have
[1:24:36] stepped up to the plate he should have
[1:24:38] been saw he was head and shoulders above
[1:24:40] everybody he had had a lot of victories
[1:24:42] before this remember that when we
[1:24:44] preached I don't know if him or that
[1:24:45] when I went through the whole book of
[1:24:46] 1st Samuel ppreciate evil spirits upon
[1:24:53] him he couldn't even stand up to Goliath
[1:24:56] he already had evil spirits upon him
[1:24:57] with this disobeyed Samuel and again and
[1:25:01] hated David yet of course but he had he
[1:25:05] had disobeyed Samuel numerous times and
[1:25:07] God said told Samuel I'm taking the
[1:25:09] kingdom where I'm renting the kingdom
[1:25:11] away from you so you'd already
[1:25:12] disappointed God a few times and so here
[1:25:15] he's full of fear and said I'm full of
[1:25:17] faith and let's look at this here now
[1:25:21] let's look how David overcame fear now
[1:25:25] the first thing brother branham said was
[1:25:27] that David was a prophet and God showed
[1:25:30] him the revelation that he was gonna win
[1:25:32] this fight amen hallelujah that's why we
[1:25:35] say pray for Revelation more than
[1:25:37] anything else pretties the Lord
[1:25:39] revelation so David goes into the
[1:25:42] situation already knowing I'm gonna get
[1:25:44] the victory he must have seen a vision
[1:25:46] maybe had a dream I don't know but he
[1:25:48] goes in this situation as a prophet
[1:25:50] already knowing what's gonna happen amen
[1:25:55] so the first thing get a revelation
[1:25:59] that's what my RAM says speak the word
[1:26:01] until you get a revelation he said and
[1:26:03] works his faith Express speak God's word
[1:26:05] until you know it's real until you know
[1:26:07] it's a reality the second thing is David
[1:26:12] remembered God's past faithfulness
[1:26:14] because he said remember when he went
[1:26:17] before Saul he said I've already killed
[1:26:19] a bear and a lion he remembered God's
[1:26:22] faithfulness he wasn't going to be
[1:26:25] paralyzed by fear like everyone else
[1:26:30] notice a third thing
[1:26:32] David ignored the pressure from family
[1:26:35] and government and spiritual leaders
[1:26:38] like that who are the people that
[1:26:41] sometimes discouraged us the most family
[1:26:43] members right could be government could
[1:26:47] be our spiritual leaders right cuz Saul
[1:26:50] was both a spiritual leader and he was a
[1:26:52] government official because he was the
[1:26:54] king it was a theocracy right so the
[1:26:57] very people that should have been
[1:26:59] encouraging him were discouraging him so
[1:27:03] he had to have a revelation that's how
[1:27:04] he overcame fear he had to remember
[1:27:06] God's past faithfulness if we could do
[1:27:08] that church how much stronger would we
[1:27:10] be amen to remember God did this God did
[1:27:13] that God can do it again amen we must
[1:27:17] overcome the discouragement from family
[1:27:19] members if a church leader has the wrong
[1:27:21] spear and tries to discourage us
[1:27:23] hopefully I don't have the wrong spirit
[1:27:24] god help me I never want to have the
[1:27:25] wrong spirit I never wanted to
[1:27:27] discourage you from what you're called
[1:27:28] to do praise the Lord I never want to do
[1:27:30] that but let's say a church leader would
[1:27:33] we even got to go past that we got to be
[1:27:36] able to go past that accusation and
[1:27:38] David was willing to do that he was
[1:27:40] willing to stand in front of the king
[1:27:42] stand in front of his brothers and say
[1:27:43] I'm not naughty there's a cause I'm an
[1:27:46] overcomer and I will fight that giant
[1:27:50] the fourth thing
[1:27:53] David looked at God's promise and not
[1:27:56] Goliath
[1:27:57] David's perspective was only on God
[1:28:00] David only considered the Word of God he
[1:28:03] didn't consider his enemy amen I want
[1:28:08] you to see this David only mentioned
[1:28:11] Goliath three times
[1:28:13] anybody know how many times he mentioned
[1:28:15] God six so in other words he talked
[1:28:20] about God twice as much as he talked
[1:28:21] about the devil if we would testify
[1:28:24] twice as much as we honor doubt and
[1:28:26] confusion and unbelief or we'd be more
[1:28:29] like David Amen don't you believe that
[1:28:30] we already are but listen if we have to
[1:28:33] actively do that actively make sure we
[1:28:36] tell our testimony more and more and
[1:28:38] more praise God he talked about God
[1:28:41] twice as much as he talked about Goliath
[1:28:43] so look at that verse 26 and look at
[1:28:47] let's read verse 26 for Samuel 17 26
[1:28:50] look at the very first time he talks
[1:28:53] about Goliath and look what he says
[1:28:56] 17:26 I'm kind of turned Aaron my oh my
[1:29:00] digital Bible and David spake to the men
[1:29:02] that stood by him saying what should be
[1:29:04] done to the man that killed this
[1:29:05] Philistine this is that awesome the
[1:29:10] first thing he says about Goliath is
[1:29:12] he's gonna die basically that's the
[1:29:15] first thing he lets his mouth utter
[1:29:17] about this Philistine what's the reward
[1:29:20] gonna be for the person who kills this
[1:29:22] guy
[1:29:24] how about what's the first thing we say
[1:29:26] when someone has cancer what's the first
[1:29:29] thing we say when someone falls away
[1:29:30] from the church what's the first thing
[1:29:33] we say when we got a little and we maybe
[1:29:35] don't get the the deal he wanted right
[1:29:39] what's the first thing we say when a
[1:29:41] yeah a little trouble at work and the
[1:29:43] teacher doesn't like what you did the
[1:29:46] first thing we should say should be
[1:29:47] words of faith not words of doubt or
[1:29:51] words of discouragement like ones like I
[1:29:54] told that story when Haman heard her
[1:29:55] cheek there and the very first words out
[1:29:57] of Simon's mouth were words of faith he
[1:30:00] said oh it's not so bad and look God
[1:30:02] protected your eye Haven remember that
[1:30:04] the very first words out of our mouth
[1:30:07] we need to respond with faith let's let
[1:30:10] we have to put faith first let's give
[1:30:11] faith preeminence amen
[1:30:13] the first thing he says oh this guy's
[1:30:15] gonna die what's the reward for the
[1:30:17] person who kills this guy and members
[1:30:20] saw a member this saw didn't even keep
[1:30:21] his word Saul told everybody to get my
[1:30:23] firstborn daughter and Saul actually
[1:30:26] didn't give his firstborn daughter to
[1:30:27] david david want to know what do i get
[1:30:31] for killing this guy because god showed
[1:30:33] me he's going down yeah god showed it to
[1:30:36] me i got a revelation this man's gonna
[1:30:38] die this uncircumcised philistine he
[1:30:42] will not defy which means humiliate god
[1:30:45] will not let this man send there and
[1:30:47] humiliate the churches of the message
[1:30:49] amen
[1:30:50] glory hallelujah God will not let this
[1:30:54] sinner stand there and humiliate the
[1:30:56] bride and God's prophet God will not let
[1:30:58] him stand there what does the person get
[1:31:00] who defeats this enemy amen because I
[1:31:03] want to know what's the reward gonna be
[1:31:04] because I'm gonna be the one that's
[1:31:05] gonna take him down
[1:31:06] the very first thing he said about this
[1:31:09] well Ram said he said like a giant of
[1:31:12] cancer he said make it let's bring the
[1:31:14] life to our day what does Goliath a
[1:31:16] cancer right
[1:31:17] diabetes tuberculosis bankruptcy right a
[1:31:21] lost loved one a mother and father who
[1:31:24] doesn't serve God infertility like the
[1:31:27] woman I prayed for the job right I
[1:31:30] couldn't have a baby
[1:31:31] all these giants or all these mountains
[1:31:33] and our first words should be words of
[1:31:37] faith amen David did not consider losing
[1:31:41] because his first thing he said he
[1:31:43] talked about the death of this
[1:31:44] Philistine hallelujah that shows he
[1:31:47] didn't have any fear cause he had was
[1:31:49] faith amen his first words were on the
[1:31:53] prize like Paul said don't look on
[1:31:55] things to the pass set your sights on
[1:31:58] things in the front of you amen set your
[1:32:01] eyes on things above treasures in heaven
[1:32:02] set your press on toward the mark of the
[1:32:05] high calling in Christ Jesus amen
[1:32:08] like Romans 8:31 said if God is for us
[1:32:11] who can be against us David knew which
[1:32:14] army he was on AIM which side he was on
[1:32:16] he was on the Lord's side amen
[1:32:18] and the last thing that's into our feet
[1:32:20] I'll make sure
[1:32:21] my time already went off let's stand
[1:32:22] there it's already been an hour the last
[1:32:27] thing we see about David David did not
[1:32:30] procrastinate to get the fight on David
[1:32:35] didn't put it off because he wasn't
[1:32:36] afraid right so if we have a situation
[1:32:41] we don't that we have to deal with if
[1:32:43] we're afraid of it we might try to put
[1:32:46] it off and say well maybe next week I'll
[1:32:48] do this or maybe maybe it maybe next
[1:32:50] year but when you have faith you run to
[1:32:54] meet the battle the Bible said he
[1:32:56] literally ran to meet the battle right
[1:32:59] and he got five souls was his j esus and
[1:33:03] FAI Thu make sure he had faith in Jesus
[1:33:06] hallelujah and he ran to meet the
[1:33:10] Philistine and brother Ram said when you
[1:33:12] have the word of god Moni 21 Sunday
[1:33:14] he said you're like Joshua you're
[1:33:16] reckless with God's Word which means
[1:33:18] you're just ready to run through a wall
[1:33:20] God told you the answer you know what's
[1:33:22] gonna happen
[1:33:22] you got faith God is gonna God is gonna
[1:33:25] help you amen you're not gonna lose now
[1:33:33] let me close with one quote we are I
[1:33:34] just want to close with one quote
[1:33:43] because this is from as always with
[1:33:45] Moses now think about yourself think
[1:33:53] about you've been battling something I
[1:33:54] don't know here what if anyone's been
[1:33:56] battling something I don't know for
[1:33:58] those live-streaming using them badly
[1:33:59] something but this is a prayer brother
[1:34:01] branham gives at the end of as I was
[1:34:03] with Moses brother I was talking about
[1:34:05] how he needed to leave the wandering in
[1:34:08] the wood remember that from Sunday
[1:34:09] mother Graham said when he just did it a
[1:34:12] sermon night and night and night out
[1:34:14] twenty thirty times he'd say 50 or 20
[1:34:17] times to wear himself out he said he was
[1:34:20] focusing on the signpost instead of the
[1:34:22] Commission and he said he was wandering
[1:34:28] around in the second pole by letting
[1:34:30] people just stand there and letting
[1:34:32] people pull out visions until they got
[1:34:33] weak and tired he said he needed to
[1:34:36] leave the wilderness and possess the
[1:34:38] promised land with me I know that might
[1:34:41] seem a little bit striking but that's
[1:34:43] what he says he says but Lord I'm
[1:34:45] getting tired of tramping over the same
[1:34:48] ground like I said last night 40 years
[1:34:50] in the wilderness back and forth back
[1:34:51] and forth God is blessing yes raising
[1:34:55] sheep and children whatever mourn Fox
[1:34:56] and herds and all the more God you bless
[1:34:58] them but one day you said we've been on
[1:35:01] this mountain long enough going up north
[1:35:03] towards Jordan now look I've never said
[1:35:05] God I have you started this morning I'm
[1:35:07] leaving these signposts because it's
[1:35:10] pointing towards a better land look at
[1:35:12] this brother Brandon calls his second
[1:35:14] Pole the wilderness and he said
[1:35:16] wandering around the witness around the
[1:35:18] discernment long enough he said it's
[1:35:20] time to go to the third Pole and it was
[1:35:22] just in time for the third Bowl right
[1:35:24] because he preached the church ages in
[1:35:26] 1960 going into the word the opening of
[1:35:29] the word praise God
[1:35:31] okay there we go and then two years
[1:35:33] later into the seven seals hallelujah
[1:35:35] and then two years later in that
[1:35:37] marriage and divorce opening up these
[1:35:39] great mysteries of God mother and said
[1:35:42] I've a stumble I may go through the
[1:35:46] Amalekites praise God so you may have
[1:35:49] try us how do you want to press on and
[1:35:53] go deeper with the Lord and you may have
[1:35:55] trials it's hard fear my
[1:35:57] keep you from trying to step into what
[1:36:00] God has called you into you may stumble
[1:36:03] you met Vanessa you may battle the
[1:36:05] Amalekites no I didn't preach on that on
[1:36:08] something that wasn't one of the seven
[1:36:09] but programs is naming names
[1:36:11] you understand and now here he says I
[1:36:13] may go through the hit tights I'm gonna
[1:36:15] indict through the canaanites this is
[1:36:18] exact quote I may have to pass through
[1:36:20] my own criticizing Lord I'm not going to
[1:36:23] be criticized when I started YouTube
[1:36:25] videos criticized when I started
[1:36:26] pastoring got criticized all your church
[1:36:28] is so small all your church still does
[1:36:30] have any new people criticism oh maybe
[1:36:35] yeah maybe someday you'll grow and maybe
[1:36:37] someday criticism criticism but I had to
[1:36:42] do what God put on my heart brother man
[1:36:45] had to do what God put on his heart
[1:36:47] don't just let the people pull the
[1:36:49] disturbance out move on into the third
[1:36:51] pole use that when needed but don't lean
[1:36:54] upon that too much move on to the third
[1:36:57] pole he says I may have to pass through
[1:37:04] my own criticizing Lord I'll just keep
[1:37:07] moving on and I know there's a land
[1:37:09] yonder somewhere there somewhere some
[1:37:12] conditions some place we can get to
[1:37:14] where your answered prayer he says Amen
[1:37:17] and whatever he asks will be granted
[1:37:19] talking about the spoken word third Pole
[1:37:21] not ever not even cancer will stand
[1:37:24] before the prayer I don't have to be the
[1:37:26] truth that I believe and I wait for Lord
[1:37:29] and I commit myself to thee this morning
[1:37:31] for your service in the name of Jesus
[1:37:33] Christ I'm closing with that now think
[1:37:38] in your mind are you tired of being out
[1:37:40] of position certain position your life
[1:37:41] if you are then this message is for you
[1:37:45] praise the Lord because what may be
[1:37:48] keeping someone back may be fear now let
[1:37:52] me say like this if it's somebody
[1:37:53] waiting on the hand of God and wait
[1:37:55] because remember David had to wait
[1:37:57] behind the mulberry bush until he heard
[1:37:59] a rattling remember that that was before
[1:38:02] he was even King David said Lord I'm
[1:38:05] gonna wait here until I see her head
[1:38:09] when the wind blows
[1:38:11] and here the mulberry bushes shake then
[1:38:13] I'll go out and he waited and god lemon
[1:38:15] but that's different that's not what I'm
[1:38:18] scared to go do it God coffee dude
[1:38:19] that's waiting I want to see God's hand
[1:38:21] move first
[1:38:22] then I'm going everybody see the
[1:38:24] difference I'm not telling anybody here
[1:38:27] just to run through and just just
[1:38:28] because we're scared I'm saying get rid
[1:38:31] of the fear but then also make sure you
[1:38:33] have the leadership of the Holy Spirit
[1:38:35] right you may have to go through some
[1:38:40] Hittites you may have to go through some
[1:38:43] Canaanites he said but we've got to move
[1:38:48] on out yonder to some condition
[1:38:51] somewhere however you want to get to
[1:38:55] another condition man I want to get to a
[1:38:56] new place in Christ I use all my heart
[1:38:59] I've prayed for this we could keep
[1:39:01] praying I want to go higher with us some
[1:39:02] more of God want to do more of the Lord
[1:39:04] how do we do that you must be ready to
[1:39:07] face criticism and not be afraid we must
[1:39:11] overcome the effects of fear I'm going
[1:39:13] to overcome the effects of good let's
[1:39:15] pray together and that's God to take
[1:39:17] away any effects of fear yes we can wait
[1:39:20] for the spirit to go through the
[1:39:21] mulberry bushes that's totally different
[1:39:23] I'm not talking about that I'm saying if
[1:39:25] there's fear and we're scared to do
[1:39:27] something we know we ought to do let's
[1:39:30] pray against that and let's have love in
[1:39:33] our hearts that we might be able to
[1:39:35] overcome the effects of fear the only
[1:39:38] father we love you today who Norcom we
[1:39:40] preach your word when we looked at some
[1:39:42] of these common examples but Lord
[1:39:44] hopefully it was in a new light for the
[1:39:46] saints law of God a lot of these were a
[1:39:48] new light for me Lord God and I'm
[1:39:51] thankful nor we want to be like David we
[1:39:54] want to be like Joshua we want to be
[1:39:56] like your prophet we want to recognize
[1:39:58] that we want to go or we're called to a
[1:40:01] higher plane we're called to to lure in
[1:40:04] Christ we don't want to be fearful and
[1:40:08] make others afraid we don't want to be
[1:40:11] fearful and isolated we don't want to be
[1:40:13] fearful and selfish we don't want to be
[1:40:16] fearful and destroy our own salvation we
[1:40:20] want to be overcomers full of faith
[1:40:22] hallelujah
[1:40:23] and what we want to go from faith to
[1:40:25] faith from every place the soles of our
[1:40:29] feet will tread we want to go from place
[1:40:30] to place further and further taking more
[1:40:34] land all the time dear God Lord I ask
[1:40:37] for grace Lord I ask for the help of the
[1:40:39] Holy Spirit Lord God that this church

[1:40:49] them continue to drive out fear amen the
[1:40:52] drive out Lord I believe it is the
[1:40:56] hittite if I'm not mistaken for they're
[1:40:57] the sons of Heth to drive out the
[1:40:59] Hittites Lord to drive out fear that
[1:41:04] might keep us from doing what you want
[1:41:06] us to do with our one talent that you've
[1:41:08] given us more surely you've given every
[1:41:11] servant some tale the Bible says in Luke

[1:41:21] because you've given it to them so Lord
[1:41:25] men your Holy Spirit help us drive out
[1:41:27] of the fear Lord or another illustration
[1:41:28] to leave where we are been wandering
[1:41:31] around we're tired of being here Lord
