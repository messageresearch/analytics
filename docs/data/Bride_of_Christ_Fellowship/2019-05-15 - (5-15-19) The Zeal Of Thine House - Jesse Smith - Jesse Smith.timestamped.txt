[25:25] let's take our Bibles tonight let's go
[25:28] to John chapter 2
[25:33] verse 11
[25:37] John 2:11
[25:50] right to just look at a thought here
[25:54] about the zeal of thine house hath eaten
[25:57] me up what's called the zeal of mine
[25:59] house or thine house rather
[26:03] message kind of about the importance of
[26:05] the house of God and then deal with that
[26:07] quite a bit and I'd like to continue
[26:09] that this is kind of like a warm-up
[26:12] heading into the weekend at Michigan I
[26:14] just feel led to administer on this
[26:16] thought there so I doubt anybody there
[26:19] listens to our services so I don't have
[26:21] to worry about that
[26:23] I like to preach on it it's been
[26:26] seven years since I've preached some of
[26:28] these thoughts so it's been a while so
[26:30] for our church it's good I mean a lot of
[26:32] it is review but some of it will feel
[26:34] new by God's grace
[26:37] so john 2 verse 11 if you there say Amen
[26:42] this beginning of miracles did Jesus in
[26:45] Cana of Galilee and manifested
[26:47] forth his glory and his disciples
[26:50] believed on him verse 12 John 2:12 after
[26:55] this he went down to Capernaum he and
[26:57] his mother his brother and his disciples
[26:59] and they continued there are not many
[27:01] days and
[27:02] the Jews Passover was at hand and Jesus
[27:05] went up to Jerusalem and he found in the
[27:08] temple those that sold oxen and sheep
[27:10] and doves and the changers of money
[27:13] sitting
[27:14] and when he made a scourge of small
[27:17] cords he drove them all out of the
[27:20] temple and the sheep and the oxen and
[27:23] poured out the changers money and
[27:25] overthrew the tables and said unto them
[27:29] that sold doves take these things hence
[27:31] make not my father's house an House of
[27:34] merchandise and his disciples remember
[27:38] that it was written the zeal of thine
[27:39] house hath eaten me up
[27:43] then answered the Jews and said unto Him
[27:46] what sign show us that unto us seeing
[27:48] that thou doest these things she's
[27:51] answered and said of them destroy this
[27:53] temple in three days will I raise it up
[27:56] or amen that's my heads for one more
[27:59] word of Prayer Heavenly Father we've
[28:01] read your word we're so thankful for it
[28:03] Lord God the zeal of your house ate up
[28:05] your son and so father we just come
[28:07] reverently tonight we ask you to speak
[28:09] through your word Lord father we've been
[28:11] looking at this importance of the local
[28:13] church lately through this purpose
[28:15] series Lord God and the fusion series
[28:18] and I just pray God you'll minister to
[28:20] us tonight be with those here physically
[28:22] and those Lord livestreaming I pray give
[28:25] us a real spiritual feeding tonight in
[28:26] Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen
[28:29] god bless you mean to see the praise God
[28:34] so like to look at this thought here the
[28:36] zeal of thine house and like I said it's
[28:38] kind of like a warm-up for this weekend
[28:40] I'll probably administer that's how I've
[28:41] been feeling lead I'm probably
[28:43] ministered on this same thought on
[28:44] Sunday morning and Sunday night I'm not
[28:47] too sure I was thinking about doing the
[28:49] Statue perfect man with the young people
[28:51] there we'll see I'm just kind of had a
[28:54] kind of not sure yet on that one or may
[28:57] preach the waters of separation to them
[28:59] I'm not quite sure which direction I'll
[29:01] go or there's a message I preached years
[29:04] ago
[29:05] about the revival with the young people
[29:09] like looking at Hezekiah day he's a 25
[29:11] year old King and he had a great revival
[29:14] so I may look at that thought - not
[29:16] quite sure off to keep praying I
[29:18] definitely feel this thought to preach
[29:20] one of those services the zeal of thine
[29:22] house
[29:23] now notice in John - Christ goes up to
[29:28] Jerusalem he's freshly anointed he's
[29:31] freshly off his first miracle he turned
[29:35] water into wine amen
[29:39] and we were told this testimony and when
[29:42] we went to Jefferson movie where that
[29:44] testimony
[29:45] at one of the the
[29:48] communion services with brother Branham
[29:51] at the tabernacle they'd ran out of
[29:53] they ran out of communion wine brother
[29:56] Graham they were all gonna get nervous
[29:57] and mother Brown said let's just pray
[29:59] and bow our heads and I guess brother
[30:01] Neville was there and they prayed and as
[30:03] brother man prayed the empty cups filled
[30:05] up with wine
[30:07] amen and I believe that same ahead and
[30:09] brother Neville told about it and it was
[30:12] just broadcast all over and so we see
[30:15] that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday
[30:16] today and forever amen he changes water
[30:19] too wide or he can bring up wine he can
[30:23] create wine where there is no wine right
[30:25] you can create squirrels where there is
[30:26] no squirrels amen I believe that with
[30:28] all my heart because it just fits God's
[30:30] character it's the same thing he did
[30:32] with Isaac he may made a ram there where
[30:35] there was no RAM God provided the RAM
[30:37] God provided the squirrel God provided
[30:40] the wine God's the Jehovah Jireh so
[30:44] he comes up here
[30:46] and Jesus makes a cord so he takes a few
[30:50] cords and he wraps them together and
[30:53] then he starts whipping
[30:55] those cords around and driving people
[30:58] out and the Bible said not just some but
[31:02] all of them he drove out every
[31:06] animal every
[31:08] moneychanger he drove by the house of
[31:10] God and that was a natural type of what
[31:13] Jesus was doing in the spiritual right
[31:16] he was cleaning out the natural church
[31:18] but what he was really doing was showing
[31:20] that the spiritual condition the church
[31:22] needed cleaned out
[31:23] amen so he drove everything out and it
[31:27] was a good
[31:35] a fresh start praise God
[31:39] that's kind of what he did of course we
[31:41] know that like the when Jesus was
[31:43] crucified is like Passover right and
[31:45] then next day the feast of unleavened
[31:47] bread so it's kind of like cleaning out
[31:48] the leaven right it was a symbol of what
[31:50] he was going to do and they asked him
[31:53] it's in what authority do you have
[31:54] cleaning out the church and he said I'm
[31:57] gonna give you this sign destroy this
[31:59] temple and in three days I'll raise it
[32:01] up amen that was his sign that's the
[32:04] sign that I can do this I've got power
[32:06] over death so I've got authority to
[32:09] clean out my house my father's house
[32:11] hallelujah because the father has given
[32:14] me power over death so it's a little
[32:17] thing for me to clean out my father's
[32:18] house amen and his disciples when they
[32:22] watch it they thought my and I love this
[32:24] whenever we see Jesus moving what does
[32:27] it do whenever we see Jesus do anything
[32:28] it should remind us of the scripture
[32:30] praise God because jesus said the Holy
[32:33] Ghost will remind you of things it will
[32:36] bring all things to your remembrance is
[32:38] that right and I love that because it
[32:41] shows the Holy Spirit's working on the
[32:42] disciples to remind them of the
[32:45] scripture and that's what it always do
[32:47] it always point us to the Word of God he
[32:50] said the zeal of thine house hath eaten
[32:53] me up
[32:54] now zeal in the Greek and I don't have
[32:58] many slides here tonight I've been kind
[33:01] of working on
[33:03] something here or working on the notes
[33:05] for the the weekend but zeal means
[33:07] boiling-hot
[33:09] fervor of mind and zeal
[33:12] so the boiling hot nature of Jesus as
[33:17] was eating him up it was eating him up
[33:20] it was consuming him so he was just
[33:22] consumed with it and so you can picture
[33:25] Jesus angry right or he's very zealous
[33:29] he's got a lot of zeal and he's cleaning
[33:32] out the house house of God just driving
[33:35] it all out amen now for what I read in
[33:38] history they were only in the Gentile
[33:40] court you know they had a Gentile court
[33:42] and then the court of women and then the
[33:44] court of the men and then the priests
[33:45] the priests court so this is still the
[33:48] outer core this wasn't even the holy the
[33:50] holy part of the court and yet Jesus was
[33:54] still interested in keeping every part
[33:56] of the house of God clean amen that's
[33:59] what I say Jesus wants not just your
[34:02] soul in your mind he wants your body
[34:03] cook pure as well praise God the Bible
[34:06] said lift up holy hands that means your
[34:08] hands haven't touched cigarettes right
[34:10] or alcohol or hasn't held a cell phone
[34:14] that had a dirty picture on it right
[34:16] lift up holy hands into the Lord see he
[34:20] wants the whole thing cleaned out
[34:21] because members slowly you know if you
[34:24] study history you know the reason they
[34:26] brought animals in there was so the
[34:27] Israelites they wouldn't have to travel
[34:29] and drag along the animals as they
[34:31] traveled you know north to Jerusalem or
[34:33] south because you know Jew days in the
[34:35] southern part of Israel whether
[34:36] whichever way they were traveling it was
[34:38] just kind of like convenience it was
[34:39] just a convenience for them and
[34:42] but convenience cause them to backslide
[34:46] right cause evil spirits to come in
[34:48] because then the men started changing
[34:50] the the balances they could make a few
[34:52] extra bucks you know I made a good deal
[34:54] today at the house of God I certainly
[34:56] got those worshipers you know charged
[34:58] little extra tax on their I charged
[35:00] little extra fee and Jesus God knew it
[35:03] the whole time but God showed it to his
[35:05] son Jesus and he said that doesn't
[35:07] belong that kind of thing doesn't belong
[35:09] in other words your mind our minds need
[35:12] to be purely on worshiping God not upon
[35:16] a financial gain not upon
[35:19] the number of people are not upon
[35:22] anything physical but it needs to be on
[35:25] just worshiping God and so Jesus had
[35:28] seen their focus was off that and it was
[35:31] on money it was on financial gains and
[35:33] they they've gotten the wrong focus when
[35:36] they were at church and it need to get
[35:38] back on it so that's what Jesus did he
[35:41] came and the Bible said he was consumed
[35:44] with zeal he was consumed with boiling
[35:46] hot thoughts right he's boiling
[35:50] you ever been boiling mad at anybody
[35:53] all my children should be saying hey man
[35:56] dad no that's gonna
[35:59] yes of course I've been mad at people
[36:00] too and that's all you can think of
[36:03] right so you just can't get it off your
[36:05] mind that's kind of like what Jesus said
[36:07] he was consumed with the zeal of God
[36:09] God's house doesn't doesn't have
[36:12] anything to do with selfish motives it's
[36:15] all selfless all focus is on Almighty
[36:17] God
[36:18] amen now what's amazing church is that
[36:22] have you studied the Bible as I studied
[36:24] a few years ago he didn't just clean the
[36:26] temple one time he cleaned it twice so
[36:29] go to mark 11 you'll see the second time
[36:32] he cleans it and
[36:34] I like that he cleaned at the beginning
[36:37] of his ministry at the end of his
[36:38] ministry what a type a man of the seven
[36:41] churches hey he cleans that at the
[36:43] beginning they got their first love and
[36:45] he's got to clean it out at the end
[36:46] before he raptures it off the earth they
[36:48] met him yeah that's right he's got to
[36:52] bring them back member the fullness of
[36:54] Pentecost the fullness of the beginning
[36:56] will be in the bride amen so see a clean
[37:00] us at the beginning and a clean house at
[37:02] the end
[37:03] so see that's a type of the bride of
[37:06] Jesus Christ the church being cleaned
[37:09] out the beginning first love and clean
[37:11] out at the end first love mark 11:14 and
[37:14] Jesus answers said unto it Noah and eat
[37:16] the fruit thereafter forever and his
[37:19] disciples heard it remember this is the
[37:22] week before he was crucified
[37:24] so Jesus cleans it out right before he
[37:27] was crucified
[37:28] remember cuz he he he cursed it and then
[37:31] they come back out the next day they
[37:34] left and then they're to come back in
[37:35] the city
[37:36] right
[37:38] verse 15 and they come to Jerusalem and
[37:42] Jesus went into the temple and began to
[37:43] cast them out that sold and bought the
[37:45] temple and overthrew the tables of the
[37:47] moneychangers and the seats of them that
[37:48] sold doves and would not suffer that any
[37:51] man should carry any vessel through the
[37:53] temple Wow so you couldn't even carry
[37:56] something Jesus was so concerned not to
[37:58] work not to have any
[38:02] any other motive than just worship keep
[38:06] out any keep out any selfish motive or
[38:09] make this only about worshipping Christ
[38:13] that's what we need to make this you
[38:14] know we need to make coming to church
[38:16] it's not about who sees us it's not
[38:18] about what clothes we wear we should
[38:20] spend more time spraying for our
[38:22] spiritual clothing than our physical
[38:24] then spending on our physical clothing
[38:26] amen right I know I know I practice that
[38:31] I'll get up in the morning and you know
[38:32] 5:00 in Sunday morning I'll spend like
[38:34] till nine o'clock study and then a quick
[38:36] try to get dressed quick from 9:00 to
[38:37] 9:30 then try to get ready to leave at
[38:39] 9:50 to go to church to try to get ready
[38:42] as fast I can because I don't want it to
[38:45] be about look in the mirror and say does
[38:46] everything look good I want everybody to
[38:48] be impressed Jesus like you're not gonna
[38:51] carry don't even bring a vessel in here
[38:53] just come here to worship God and he had
[38:57] the zeal of God he had the boiling-hot
[39:00] thoughts of God this is what please God
[39:03] remember Jesus said it plainly I only do
[39:06] those things that what pleased the
[39:08] father
[39:09] and he said the only things I do is what
[39:12] the father shows me first glory so the
[39:16] father was showing him you need to do
[39:18] this you need to show the people it's
[39:20] not about money or popularity or women
[39:23] or relationships or anything physical
[39:25] it's all about glorifying the Father and
[39:28] I love it right here because he says my
[39:30] house is called a House of Prayer so
[39:32] anything that hinders our prayer church
[39:34] we need to get rid of
[39:36] and I'm speaking for us mostly our
[39:39] thoughts right anything that would
[39:41] hinder our thoughts and hinder our
[39:43] prayers at church should be cast aside
[39:47] okay because Jesus said this is a house
[39:49] of prayer that's why I don't mind you
[39:52] know if we spend a little more time on
[39:53] prayer and the song services come short
[39:55] a little bit I have no problem with that
[39:57] because this is a house of prayer I love
[39:59] when people pray before or after church
[40:01] the thing to do is remember that God
[40:03] wants to hear from us amen God wants us
[40:06] to talk to heaven as we saw on Sunday
[40:07] God wants us to reach up Iran sit and
[40:09] touch the throne of God amen
[40:13] verse
[40:15] 17 and he taught saying of them is it
[40:18] not written my house should be called of
[40:19] all Oh Nick
[40:22] the house of prayer but Yumi's uh-huh
[40:24] and the scribes the chief priests heard
[40:27] it and saw how they might destroy him
[40:28] for they feared him because all the
[40:30] people were astonished at his doctrine
[40:31] so a week before he dies he cleans out
[40:34] the house of God I notice look how fast
[40:37] a backsliding can take place within
[40:38] three and a half years now we know it
[40:40] can happen a lot faster than that right
[40:42] we've seen people and it's happened to
[40:43] them they can backside in a week I've
[40:45] seen people backside in one or two days
[40:48] right though government and I pray I
[40:50] pray with him here at the altar of this
[40:52] very altar they'll be on fire have a
[40:54] Bible study with him on Monday then
[40:55] backslide Tuesday don't even see him
[40:56] Wednesday at church I've had that before
[40:58] I'm a witness so does but look how fast
[41:02] Jerusalem backslidden Jesus preached
[41:06] three nine years so at the beginning he
[41:08] cleaned it out he comes back a week
[41:10] before his ministry is over cleans it
[41:12] out and they'd already backs then in
[41:13] three and a half years look how the
[41:15] devil likes to move back in slowly jesus
[41:18] said if you kick him out you better fill
[41:20] it with God's presence or else he's
[41:21] gonna bring seven more thieves into your
[41:23] house right because it's now it's a den
[41:26] of thieves a
[41:27] bunch of thieves looking around who can
[41:30] I make money off of I can't wait all
[41:33] maybe I can pull it I should know from
[41:35] other people yeah that's what it was can
[41:37] you imagine it pretending claiming to be
[41:40] Jews claiming to be worshipping God
[41:43] Almighty can you believe that and Jesus
[41:45] says you're a bunch of den of thieves
[41:46] now did you know brother answer this
[41:51] jesus said my man said Jesus went up in
[41:55] the temple looked upon the people with
[41:57] anger kicked over the sacrifices that
[41:59] Jehovah required and screamed out so but
[42:02] Ram said he didn't just go in there kind
[42:04] of upset he went there were angry with
[42:07] anger and screamed out it's written my
[42:09] father's house is made a house of prayer
[42:12] and you've made it a fees
[42:14] so see I'm not too far off Jesus when
[42:19] I'm yelling or screaming or preaching or
[42:21] pointing or clapping or spitting I'm not
[42:23] too far from where Jesus was and anybody
[42:26] that don't believe that or anybody that
[42:28] don't like that kind of preaching they
[42:29] sure went like Jesus too much right look
[42:33] over brother Adam says today this is a
[42:35] part in 1963 he says what would he do
[42:38] today if he come to our modern churches
[42:42] there would be some more table moving
[42:44] there would be some more pew jumping for
[42:48] he'd tear it to pieces I
[42:52] wonder what it would take for me to
[42:54] throw over some of these chairs here to
[42:56] give us a little illustration I know
[42:58] they're connected side kind of to
[42:59] disconnect him first and throw him over
[43:02] but Rodin said there were he'd tear it
[43:05] to pieces
[43:06] Jesus Christ if he was here today and
[43:09] saw how they're letting homosexuals
[43:11] preach the gospel or how they're doing
[43:14] prosperity sermons and
[43:16] don't and they take the blood of Jesus
[43:19] Christ away they become a den of thieves
[43:21] the preachers right and the people
[43:23] he said he dared to pieces it'd be the
[43:27] same thing don't you see Jesus is very
[43:29] scriptural he was the word he had not to
[43:33] write anything he was the word he was
[43:36] the Living Word and the people fail to
[43:38] recognize it amen
[43:41] so we'd have pew jumpers today if Jesus
[43:44] could get in all these churches think
[43:45] about all the churches we passed on the
[43:47] way to church children we saw some
[43:48] really nice big ones where they look
[43:49] fancy they got nice landscaping and real
[43:52] big beautiful
[43:53] they got big beautiful windows and it
[43:57] looks fine but if they're off the word
[43:59] and the hearts of those people are full
[44:03] of dead men's bones and they just
[44:05] outwardly they're beautiful but in word
[44:07] they're full of corruption Jesus would
[44:09] walk in those beautiful churches and
[44:11] throw the pews over and say my house is
[44:14] a house of prayer you need to preach the
[44:16] word and
[44:18] he'd look on them anger and scream at
[44:22] them so don't feel bad when your dad or
[44:24] the Evangelist screams at you because
[44:27] it's not us it's Christ in us and that's
[44:30] if we've done wrong if we done good then
[44:32] it's not to you and you say lord help
[44:34] those people but thank you for the truth
[44:36] of God amen now I
[44:39] want you to see that that's very
[44:41] important so he cleaned it out at the
[44:42] beginning and the end of his ministry
[44:47] now go back let's look at the Old
[44:50] Testament brother Brahim cause this the
[44:52] rapture text we'll go to Psalms 27 for
[45:02] so I'm 27 for so brother man teaches
[45:05] this for the rapture in 1965 he
[45:09] said one thing have I desired of the
[45:12] Lord that I will seek after that I may
[45:14] dwell in the house of the Lord all the
[45:16] days of my life to behold the beauty of
[45:18] the Lord and to enquire his temple and
[45:21] then verse 5 speaks must speak of the
[45:25] squeeze and the rapture for in the time
[45:27] of trouble he will hide me in his
[45:30] pavilion in the secret of his Tabernacle
[45:33] shall you hide me he shall set me up
[45:35] upon a rock
[45:38] so this is brother branham's text for
[45:41] the rapture
[45:42] amen
[45:45] so God has a pavilion or a secret of his
[45:50] tabernacle where he'll hide us
[45:53] what your course would have to be the
[45:56] meeting in the air or the marriage
[45:57] supper of the Lamb he shall set me on a
[46:00] rock but he uses the text that David
[46:04] desires one thing to dwell in the house
[46:07] of the Lord all the days of his life and
[46:09] we know David was a man after God's own
[46:12] heart
[46:14] raised the Lord so this tells us the
[46:16] heart of God is to dwell with God in his
[46:20] house every day and that's why Jesus
[46:24] said I that's why the Bible said he had
[46:27] the zeal of God to clean out the house
[46:29] of God because that is the heart of God
[46:32] amen so David had a love and a longing
[46:36] for God's house which we know is our
[46:39] physical gathering right but also it's a
[46:42] it's the true house of God because this
[46:45] place is going to burn but the the
[46:47] heavenly marriage supper of the Lamb
[46:50] that's not going to burn amen that's
[46:52] that's where we want to go that's where
[46:54] we have eternal bodies amen
[46:58] now it's like the sons of korah in
[47:00] psalms 42:1 you got your bible psalms
[47:02] 42:1
[47:05] now you remember the sons of Korah I
[47:07] think I hope you do
[47:10] Cora was I believe swallowed up in the
[47:14] earth and I'm not mistaken
[47:17] the sons of Korah I'm sorry the Korah
[47:20] and all those men tried to make their
[47:22] own censors right and they said all
[47:24] we're just as holy as Moses we can go
[47:26] into the holiest of Holies and
[47:27] I think they were swallowed up in the
[47:29] earth I'm not mistaken but their son the
[47:32] sons of Korah and the lineage of Korah
[47:35] actually came to be obedient
[47:39] servants of God look at verse
[47:42] Psalms 40
[47:44] sounds 42:1 yeah
[47:48] to the chief musician mastiha for the
[47:51] sons of Korah as the heart panted after
[47:54] the water Brooks so my so panteth my
[47:56] soul after thee O God my soul thirsts
[47:59] for thee for the Living God when I when
[48:01] shall I come and appear before my god
[48:03] so this is a song for the workers of the
[48:07] tabernacle the sons of Korah they didn't
[48:10] eat the bread like the sons of the
[48:13] Levites they didn't eat the bread all's
[48:15] they did brother and sister was cover up
[48:17] the pieces and carrier that's all they
[48:19] did they carried it from place to place
[48:21] they just they just took care of the
[48:24] outer parts of the tabernacle and yet
[48:28] the Bible said that their souls thirsted
[48:31] for God and they wanted to come and
[48:33] appear before God amen as
[48:36] a heart or a deer pants after the water
[48:39] so my soul pants after the Oh God so
[48:43] these weren't even the ones that can
[48:45] feel God's presence they couldn't even
[48:46] see God's presence they couldn't even
[48:48] eat God's bread or see the light of the
[48:51] of the menorah or the the candlestick
[48:54] they couldn't see that yet they longed
[48:56] to see it amen right amen they longed to
[49:00] see it and that's why brother bran tells
[49:03] us
[49:05] he says
[49:07] he said shin's will go through death to
[49:10] go to church they just got to get there
[49:13] it's their life if they don't they feel
[49:15] like they're perishing where did he get
[49:17] that idea brother have says if you don't
[49:19] go to church a real Christian feels like
[49:21] they're perishing where does he get that
[49:23] thought right here in Psalms 42 as the
[49:26] heart panteth for the water so my soul
[49:28] pants for thee an animal that's really
[49:32] thirsty feels like they're perishing if
[49:34] they don't have water a Christian that
[49:36] doesn't get to the house of God feels
[49:38] like they're perishing because they
[49:40] don't have the waters of God's Word they
[49:41] may
[49:42] see where does one get these thoughts he
[49:45] gets it right from the word
[49:50] go to Psalms 84 1
[49:56] this is where Bram gets these thoughts
[50:00] he gets it right from the scripture so I
[50:02] was 84 1 and 2 to the chief musician
[50:05] upon get getteth a song for the sons of
[50:09] korah how amiable are thy Tabernacles
[50:12] that's lovely how lovely are thy
[50:13] Tabernacles O Lord of Hosts my soul
[50:16] longeth yay even fainteth for the courts
[50:18] of the Lord my heart and my flesh cried
[50:21] out for the Living God
[50:23] so this was a place that the sons of
[50:26] korah felt like we can contact God amen
[50:29] God's gonna hear us when we go to the
[50:32] house of God and we crowd to God God's
[50:34] gonna hear me
[50:35] because I met his requirement I brought
[50:37] the sacrifice other priests sacrifice
[50:40] for me I confess my sins whether it was
[50:42] a trespass offering or a peace offering
[50:44] or a meal offering whichever offering
[50:47] you brought sin offering you you offered
[50:50] it you met God's requirement and you
[50:52] cried out to God my heart he said cries
[50:55] out for the Living God Oh God show
[50:57] yourself alive in my life amen
[51:00] like we seen on Sunday I talked to both
[51:03] the people we prayed for and both people
[51:06] were demon powers were working on them
[51:08] during the service and then I was
[51:09] wondering why I was preaching on demons
[51:11] you know I was quote brother branham I
[51:12] was wondering about that and I got to
[51:14] talk to both of matress and they both
[51:16] said afterwards it was all gone by God's
[51:18] grace that's what we that's what we're
[51:20] that's what we're here for to cry out
[51:23] living God come on the see bless your
[51:25] children deliver your children help your
[51:27] children and what does he knew he comes
[51:29] and does it amen if we can just believe
[51:33] God's Word and have confidence in God
[51:35] God will show up because he's a Living
[51:37] God amen hallelujah how beautiful are
[51:41] the Tabernacles of God and not because
[51:44] like oh this is beautiful sharp TV oh
[51:47] there's dustier not so beautiful anymore
[51:49] that's not that the beauty of coming
[51:52] here is not the people or the furniture
[51:56] it that God comes and answers prayer hey
[52:00] man that's the beauty Church
[52:05] now I'm gonna just skip down
[52:10] to some more scripture here
[52:12] now remember Jesus's custom in Luke 4:16
[52:16] we're not going to read it but as his
[52:18] custom was he went into the synagogue on
[52:20] the Sabbath day and stood up to read so
[52:23] you would find Jesus every Sabbath day
[52:25] in the synagogue and of course we know
[52:29] he read the scriptures when he said this
[52:31] day the Scriptures fulfilled there in
[52:32] Luke chapter 4 they even called him up
[52:34] to read so men had opportunities to read
[52:38] now remember Hebrews 10:24 2:25 said we
[52:42] must gather he said so much the more as
[52:45] you see that day approaching so as we
[52:48] see the day of Jesus Christ returning
[52:50] we've got to be together more I like
[52:52] that David I love that and
[52:55] those
[52:57] and those who do come and stay prove
[53:01] they're the true children of God that's
[53:04] one of the evidences why shouldn't they
[53:06] one of evidence maybe that's one of the
[53:08] proofs that you're a real child of God
[53:10] is when you continue with Holy Ghost
[53:11] field Christians that's in the first
[53:14] John 2:19 lady can you pull it up here
[53:15] first John 2:19 they went out from us
[53:19] because but they were not of us for if
[53:22] they'd been of us and they would no
[53:24] doubt have continued with us but they
[53:27] went out that they might be made
[53:28] manifest that they were not all of us
[53:32] so when people leave our church if they
[53:34] go to another church that still that's
[53:36] still I mean but if they leave our
[53:38] church and go out into the world that
[53:40] proves they were not of us they were not
[53:42] amongst real believers that's right
[53:46] brother Ram prays he I haven't read
[53:48] these in a while but man prays for new
[53:50] converts he said Lord may they find a
[53:52] good home a good church home and they
[53:55] remain faithful at the post of duty
[53:57] until death shall set them free from
[54:00] this earthly course
[54:02] amen brother have one to see people get
[54:05] saved find a home Church and stay there
[54:08] until they died or got raptured
[54:11] amen but man said every man ought to
[54:14] have a home church home
[54:16] you ought to have a place not just float
[54:18] from pillar to post but have somewhere
[54:20] where you go to church and call it your
[54:22] church all right now he says just before
[54:25] I pray for this sick he said
[54:30] he said if something's happened to you
[54:32] you got saved promise me you'll find a
[54:34] good gospel church somewhere a church
[54:37] that teaches the full gospel the power
[54:39] of God his resurrection joined up with
[54:41] those people make yourself a church home
[54:43] don't just stray around loose on the
[54:45] streets go get a good church somewhere
[54:47] of your choice where the gospel and the
[54:49] power of God has made known and the
[54:51] signs of eternal life is in there the
[54:53] signs that was in Christ
[54:55] he said promise me make me a vow vowed
[54:59] to God and to me that you just got saved
[55:02] and you'll find a home Church don't live
[55:04] out there and one around the world find
[55:06] God's house find the temple of God the
[55:09] beautiful amiable Tabernacles of God and
[55:12] stay there and hunger and thirst after
[55:15] the Living God
[55:17] promise me amen he said promise me
[55:20] you'll do that and again he says it in
[55:24] Washington he says mate Lord may they
[55:27] find a church home somewhere close to
[55:29] where they're living and be a faithful
[55:31] member of the body Christ until you call
[55:32] them home
[55:35] and that's something
[55:39] blind bartimaeus in Albert I'm sorry
[55:43] Edmonton Alberta I don't know if it's
[55:46] Alberta every person that st. ought to
[55:48] have a church home they ought to be in
[55:50] the church and there every time the
[55:51] church has a service
[55:55] now look what here this is important
[55:58] brother Branham said you're an heir if
[56:00] you don't have a home Church so think
[56:02] about that think about all the people we
[56:03] know they just you know do tape services
[56:05] in their homes or don't have a home
[56:07] church but RAM says this in explaining
[56:10] healing and Jarius in Illinois in 1954
[56:13] he says that many of these poor
[56:15] wandering straying children Strang
[56:18] around through the world tonight without
[56:19] a church home Granite Lord that they'll
[56:22] see their heir and come to the house of
[56:25] the Living God
[56:27] amen someone without a church homes in
[56:30] air
[56:31] because the church home is where God
[56:33] feeds his sheep amen this is where God
[56:37] feeds the flock of God
[56:41] all right and as you know brother
[56:44] Branham said in 1965 when Perry green
[56:46] started the church in Tucson Arizona he
[56:48] said this is my church
[56:55] he said I've been here three years
[56:57] having any many doors open to me
[57:00] he says this is our church
[57:04] so that was gonna be his home Church and
[57:07] we know his wife was attending there
[57:08] even before he passed away there in
[57:11] December 65 now let's go to Psalm 77 13
[57:15] this is always a blessing scripture for
[57:18] us so I'm seventy seven thirteen
[57:29] the Bible says thy way O God is in the
[57:34] sanctuary who is so great a God as our
[57:37] God
[57:38] so see the Bible said Jesus is the way
[57:41] the truth and the life so Jesus is in
[57:44] the sanctuary and Jesus is the way to be
[57:48] saved so why do we come to church
[57:50] because the way of God is in the house
[57:53] of God
[57:55] I'll go to Psalms 84 for
[58:01] so I'm 84 4 blessed are they that dwell
[58:05] in thy house they will be still which
[58:08] means persistently are continually
[58:10] praising thee Sayla
[58:12] so see when you come to church in your
[58:15] each week you're serving praising God
[58:17] then you're honoring God God says oh
[58:20] she's a continual worshipper oh look at
[58:23] him he continually worship he doesn't
[58:25] stop worshipping me he's a constant
[58:27] worshipper amen amen
[58:30] they will be
[58:32] continually praising God amen now
[58:37] let's go the
[58:40] psalm 73 16
[58:44] this is a great blessing you and I get
[58:47] understanding and guidance in the house
[58:50] of God we understand
[58:54] people's end when we come to the house
[58:56] of God so look at Psalm 73 16 when I
[58:59] thought to know this it was too painful
[59:01] for me until I went into the sanctuary
[59:03] of God then I understood there and now
[59:06] look at that sometimes people have such
[59:08] pains life causes them such pain well
[59:11] God why did this tragedy happen to God
[59:13] why how come it seems like nothing bad
[59:15] ever happens to so-and-so and they're a
[59:17] sinner and they don't believe in the
[59:19] message and all these things David said
[59:21] this is so paid for me or for me until I
[59:24] come to God's house and God gives me
[59:27] understanding amen see that's why people
[59:31] are hurting out there that's why you
[59:33] know I know I said this often but that's
[59:35] why people always ask me I had somebody
[59:36] ask me I think why are you so happy I
[59:38] had the drycleaner asked me why are you
[59:40] so happy mr. Smith
[59:41] I said well I love Jesus I said my
[59:44] wife's good to me I got beautiful
[59:46] wonderful children I said I love Jesus I
[59:50] people at work asked me that they said
[59:52] why are you so happy all the time in
[59:55] fact my principal told me last week he
[59:57] said he said we just appreciate you you
[59:59] always have such joy all that they used
[1:00:01] that word joy and I didn't ask for him
[1:00:04] to tell me like what do you see about me
[1:00:06] what do you like about me principal I
[1:00:07] didn't ask that he just he just brought
[1:00:09] it up he said why are you so joy when
[1:00:11] he's and now he's a Christian too
[1:00:12] denomination and he says but we know
[1:00:15] where that comes from he said
[1:00:17] so he knows where it comes from the joy
[1:00:19] of the Lord is your strength
[1:00:22] take the joy to your 4-h meetings right
[1:00:24] take the joy of the Lord there people
[1:00:26] wonder why he's so happy Lydia all the
[1:00:28] time okay so why are you so happy people
[1:00:31] ask you that and you tell them it's
[1:00:33] because of Jesus
[1:00:35] see then I understood well why aren't
[1:00:38] you bogged down with pain why aren't you
[1:00:40] depressed how do you make it through the
[1:00:41] day because I go to the house of God and
[1:00:44] God gives me understanding for my life
[1:00:46] that's scriptural
[1:00:48] now I wanted to go let's go to first
[1:00:51] timothy 3:15 here this is a scripture
[1:00:54] haven't maybe pointed out too much
[1:00:59] first timothy 3:15 you're probably
[1:01:02] familiar with first timothy 3:16 because
[1:01:04] that's a godhead and a scripture about
[1:01:09] such perform in
[1:01:11] so first two minute li 3:15 but if i
[1:01:14] tarry long that thou mayest know how
[1:01:15] thou oughtest to behave thyself in the
[1:01:18] house of God which is the Church of the
[1:01:22] Living God the pillar and ground
[1:01:25] of the truth amen so Paul says if I
[1:01:30] don't come back for a while you'll have
[1:01:32] this letter and it will show you how to
[1:01:34] behave in the house of God now you know
[1:01:38] you'd if you read earlier the chapter
[1:01:39] what he just do he gave qualifications
[1:01:43] for pastors and deacons and their wives
[1:01:46] and families and then if you read the
[1:01:48] previous chapter 2 he talks about women
[1:01:51] dressing modestly and men lifting up
[1:01:54] holy hands right verse 2 8
[1:01:57] so Paul is saying this is how you behave
[1:02:00] in the house of God dress modestly men
[1:02:04] or preachers rule your house as well
[1:02:06] deacons hold the older faith with a good
[1:02:09] conscience live pure before all men
[1:02:11] women don't gossip and live the right
[1:02:14] kind of life this is how you behave in
[1:02:16] the house of God because we are the
[1:02:18] pillar of truth we are holding up God's
[1:02:21] truth on this earth amen we're the
[1:02:24] foundational pillars the only
[1:02:27] foundational pillars this earth has of
[1:02:29] the truth of God
[1:02:31] think about that Church in Akron we're
[1:02:34] the only Church really with the full
[1:02:36] gospel that has thus saith the lord of
[1:02:38] the seals the marriage in Namur serpent
[1:02:40] seed all these things the Lord's as far
[1:02:42] as I know by there we're the only Church
[1:02:44] in Akron that's a pillar of the truth
[1:02:46] so I guess I could put a map up here I'd
[1:02:49] have a church in Akron Sheffield in the
[1:02:52] rain and each of us would be pillars
[1:02:54] holding up the Church of God amen amen
[1:02:58] there'd be a pillar here in Akron a
[1:03:00] pillar there in Sheffield Lorraine
[1:03:02] pillar over here in albia there's all
[1:03:04] these pillars and we're all holding up
[1:03:06] the truth of God's Word and think about
[1:03:09] when the rapture comes that's why jesus
[1:03:11] can allow the bombs to destroy America
[1:03:14] right the crater's because all these
[1:03:16] pillars are all taken away now there's
[1:03:19] no more house of God there's no more
[1:03:20] place of the Living God so he can pour
[1:03:22] out those vials right he can blow those
[1:03:25] trumpets through those message through
[1:03:27] the Ministry of the two prophets he can
[1:03:29] blow the trumpets and pour out the vials
[1:03:31] upon the earth because there's no more
[1:03:33] truth on the earth it's already been
[1:03:34] taken up and thank God that we believe
[1:03:37] the truth of God
[1:03:39] small number small church at night but
[1:03:42] we're great in God's eyes amen because
[1:03:44] we're holding up his truth hallelujah
[1:03:46] I'm not great like bragging but we're
[1:03:49] doing a great work we're doing the work
[1:03:50] of the gospel
[1:03:51] somewhere I'm not exalting myself or
[1:03:53] anyone else here we're not exalting
[1:03:55] ourselves but we are doing the work the
[1:03:57] Great Commission is what we're doing now
[1:03:59] verse 16 you know this and without
[1:04:02] controversy great is the mystery of
[1:04:03] godliness I remember before you read on
[1:04:08] he says I want you to behave in the
[1:04:09] house of God he just showed how a
[1:04:11] preacher has to meet all those
[1:04:13] qualifications a deacon has to meet
[1:04:15] those qualifications he wants you to be
[1:04:17] the pillar of God in truth he said
[1:04:18] without mystery or controversy that
[1:04:21] argument great is the mystery of
[1:04:24] godliness
[1:04:25] God was manifest in the flesh so this is
[1:04:28] the mystery how do people become godly
[1:04:30] they become godly because God was
[1:04:33] manifest in the flesh in other words God
[1:04:35] became flesh to show us how to have
[1:04:38] godliness amen so we look at Jesus
[1:04:42] Christ we said that's godliness and that
[1:04:44] he was the mystery of godliness God was
[1:04:47] hiding himself in a man haha hey men and
[1:04:51] now that's the mystery of how we become
[1:04:53] godly look at the life of Jesus Christ
[1:04:55] see God manifest in the flesh he
[1:04:58] justified him in the spirit he was seen
[1:05:00] of angels he was preach to the Gentiles
[1:05:02] but lead on the world and received up
[1:05:04] into glory amen now
[1:05:07] that just struck me here just a moment
[1:05:09] Lydia can you switch over to my slides I
[1:05:12] wanted to preach this on Sunday I didn't
[1:05:14] get to it and since brother Aaron's here
[1:05:17] and everybody's listening I like to
[1:05:19] preach this thought here real quick I'm
[1:05:22] switching over I never got to these
[1:05:23] notes on Sunday since I won't be here
[1:05:25] Sunday I'm just gonna preach it now okay
[1:05:28] we sing a song in Christ alone it says
[1:05:30] the fullness of God and helpless babe
[1:05:32] but if you notice we change the lyrics
[1:05:35] because it wasn't the fullness of God in
[1:05:38] a baby right because God had not entered
[1:05:42] into the baby yet
[1:05:44] but his nature was God's nature it was a
[1:05:47] word nature the baby's body and mind and
[1:05:52] spirit was all the word nature but yet
[1:05:55] God spirit wasn't dwelling in the baby
[1:05:57] is everybody with me
[1:05:58] so I don't know brother Aaron has heard
[1:06:02] these quotes I want to bring I'm gonna
[1:06:03] read them to you just in case you
[1:06:04] haven't heard him I don't know so the
[1:06:06] song says fullness of God but we change
[1:06:08] in Christ alone who took on flesh
[1:06:09] fullness of God in helpless babe so we
[1:06:13] change it to the fullness of word
[1:06:15] because the Bible said in Colossians 1
[1:06:18] that the fullness of the godhead dwelt
[1:06:20] bodily in Christ
[1:06:22] when did that phonus come it came at the
[1:06:24] River Jordan
[1:06:25] now were you aware that brother
[1:06:28] yes amen praise God hallelujah now
[1:06:33] here's the quote where he says it quite
[1:06:35] plainly it's pretty it's pretty pretty
[1:06:37] blood brother he was good at being blood
[1:06:39] which is good we like that he said look
[1:06:42] here Mary said your father and I have
[1:06:44] sought you for a day and night with
[1:06:45] tears she discredited her first
[1:06:47] testimony she called Joseph his father
[1:06:49] remember her first testimony is God is
[1:06:52] the father of this child and now she's
[1:06:55] saying Jesus your father and I have
[1:06:57] sought you with tears
[1:06:59] now look at this twelve-year-old boy not
[1:07:02] knowing what he said he was just a boy
[1:07:04] but he was the word see
[1:07:06] know ye not that I must be about my
[1:07:08] father's business see the word
[1:07:10] correcting the error didn't say God he
[1:07:13] said the word
[1:07:14] no look what he says next and the first
[1:07:17] time I read this and listen this I was
[1:07:19] about shocked for a couple of days she
[1:07:21] was given testimony after he was raised
[1:07:24] up it was all over now she said see your
[1:07:26] father and I have sought you going
[1:07:27] exactly what she said she hadn't
[1:07:29] conceived this child by the Holy Ghost
[1:07:31] then calling Joseph the father look what
[1:07:33] he says next and this little boy
[1:07:34] twelve-year-old child no wisdom at all I
[1:07:37] don't know if other man was exaggerating
[1:07:39] there or not but said Jesus had no
[1:07:41] wisdom at all why just a 12 year old boy
[1:07:43] the father didn't dwell in him at that
[1:07:46] time have you ever seen this quote
[1:07:47] before well good I thought so I thought
[1:07:50] when to make sure I read it while you
[1:07:52] were here but I may when I heard this
[1:07:54] this really did something for me it
[1:07:56] helped me to understand that God the
[1:07:58] spirit didn't come into Christ until he
[1:08:00] was thirty at the River Jordan
[1:08:02] because he come on the day when he
[1:08:05] baptized him he saw the Spirit of God
[1:08:08] coming down see and went in him but look
[1:08:11] this little twelve-year-old boy being
[1:08:13] the word he was born the Anointed One
[1:08:16] see to be anointed
[1:08:20] so when Jesus was born he wasn't
[1:08:23] anointed yet with the Spirit of God that
[1:08:25] didn't come to the dove flew down and
[1:08:28] rested on him and remained on him now
[1:08:31] does that help by God's grace cover I
[1:08:32] see that that's why he didn't do any
[1:08:35] miracles till he was after he was
[1:08:37] anointed he was just the word which now
[1:08:41] justice is probably not a good word to
[1:08:42] use but because we still respect the
[1:08:44] word he was only the word I'll say like
[1:08:47] that he was only the word and everything
[1:08:49] he said was the word the word he
[1:08:51] corrected his mom he corrected over it
[1:08:53] he was just the word he corrected those
[1:08:54] priests at the temple when he was 12
[1:08:56] years old see but the father didn't
[1:08:59] dwell on him yet
[1:09:01] that didn't come to the day that John
[1:09:04] baptized him when the Holy Ghost came
[1:09:05] down
[1:09:07] so that's why I always tell people that
[1:09:09] you know Jesus had to receive the Holy
[1:09:11] Ghost because remember
[1:09:13] James and John's mother remember they
[1:09:15] asked Jesus she said let my two sons sit
[1:09:19] by you on your right and left hand you
[1:09:21] remember that Salome was it slow yes low
[1:09:24] and
[1:09:25] Jesus said you don't know what you're
[1:09:27] asking about he said can you be baptized
[1:09:31] with the baptism I'm baptized with what
[1:09:34] was he talking he said can you drink of
[1:09:35] the cup that I drink of so the baptism
[1:09:39] was the baptism the Holy Ghost right
[1:09:40] Jesus was saying I've been baptized with
[1:09:42] the Holy Ghost can you be baptized with
[1:09:44] the baptism and baptize men hey that's
[1:09:48] what we desire we need that baptism to
[1:09:50] go in the rapture amen
[1:09:53] see so see that that right there and
[1:09:57] just if you if you need to know paradox
[1:10:00] what it would awake what a perfect
[1:10:02] serving to preach that hidden paradox
[1:10:04] so that song is wrong the fullness of
[1:10:08] God wasn't in the babe
[1:10:10] the fullness of the word was in the babe
[1:10:13] because that's what that's what the
[1:10:15] Bible teaches that's what by the RAM
[1:10:17] talk
[1:10:18] now brother I have spent a lot of time
[1:10:20] showing the difference between the word
[1:10:22] and the spirit so I got some of the
[1:10:24] scriptures on that notice they've
[1:10:26] indicated word in his body is his very
[1:10:28] victory and the reason of his death see
[1:10:30] the death not in the spirit when he died
[1:10:32] he only died in the flesh his spirit
[1:10:35] went to hell breech the souls in prison
[1:10:36] that's right his flesh only died and he
[1:10:38] raised up again and quickened it quicker
[1:10:40] means made alive his flesh which was his
[1:10:42] body and that's the word so the word
[1:10:45] died for you not so the letter of the
[1:10:47] word in a sense died the
[1:10:50] but you can't kill God's Spirit we
[1:10:53] wouldn't live - I can't nobody nobody
[1:10:56] can kill God's Spirit you can crucify
[1:10:58] the effects of the spirit brother
[1:11:00] Branham says in the indictment sermon
[1:11:01] the other words you can just resist the
[1:11:03] Holy Spirit I don't want we're not going
[1:11:05] to obey the holy people can crucify the
[1:11:07] effects of the Holy Spirit but you
[1:11:09] cannot kill the Spirit of God it's
[1:11:11] eternal life amen
[1:11:14] so my man spends many many sermons and
[1:11:17] if you just if you just type in spirit
[1:11:19] and word and look out for 1965 he
[1:11:22] touches on it all the time I just
[1:11:24] brought a few out
[1:11:26] he said it's just like your body here
[1:11:28] see your body is dead without the spirit
[1:11:29] and so is the word of God debt without
[1:11:31] the Holy Ghost look wick in it we all
[1:11:34] know a lot of churches tonight are
[1:11:35] reading this but it's not quicken to
[1:11:37] them
[1:11:38] they'll see fathers and Holy Ghost hope
[1:11:40] let's go let's go dip them in let's go
[1:11:42] sprinkle the babies and polishin only
[1:11:43] goes and it's not quickened to him but
[1:11:47] if they ever got quickened they see I
[1:11:48] I'm gonna dog I need to repent and be
[1:11:51] buried in water in the literal name of
[1:11:53] Jesus Christ and our see the Holy Ghost
[1:11:55] that's the revelation behind it then
[1:11:58] it's quickened
[1:12:02] he wasn't only the word but he was God
[1:12:05] himself the dynamics in the word so the
[1:12:07] Spirit came in the body of the word that
[1:12:10] made the body of Jesus cold stiffened
[1:12:12] dead in the grave shaken to life and
[1:12:14] rise again I
[1:12:16] mean he just says it over and over again
[1:12:18] the body is waiting for which is the
[1:12:20] word waiting for the life which is the
[1:12:21] spirit to confirm or make it alive
[1:12:23] that's what she is waiting for no other
[1:12:26] life will work in her she can't come to
[1:12:27] life any other way he's talked about the
[1:12:29] bride of Jesus Christ
[1:12:30] see the bodies which is the word is
[1:12:33] waiting for the life so we're the body
[1:12:35] of Christ that we're waiting for the
[1:12:37] life the anointing the latter rain
[1:12:39] rapturing faith we're waiting for more
[1:12:41] life to come and quicken us in the
[1:12:43] rapture
[1:12:45] he was sinless by nature that's the only
[1:12:47] thing that could protect this sinless
[1:12:49] god word the word being God so Jesus had
[1:12:54] a word nature right so when you and I
[1:12:57] when we see half-naked women as brothers
[1:13:00] we feel that temptation right romance
[1:13:03] doesn't run down you but when Jesus saw
[1:13:06] instantly he look away because he was
[1:13:08] the word and and so when Jove said I
[1:13:12] made a covenant with my eyes not to look
[1:13:14] on a mate Jesus might see a prostitute
[1:13:17] and he'll just turn his head like that
[1:13:18] because you know Turner said he just he
[1:13:20] was the word but we might you know you
[1:13:23] know you know we've got a rest so well
[1:13:27] do i you know god help me yeah but Jesus
[1:13:30] he just did it he just it was the word
[1:13:32] when someone said something wrong he
[1:13:34] corrected it because he was the word he
[1:13:37] never compromised and said well you know
[1:13:39] that's my mom and it's okay for her to
[1:13:41] say that Joseph is my real dad it's okay
[1:13:44] she's my mom you know she's a mother
[1:13:46] she's the mother of God you know he
[1:13:49] didn't say they said no he said don't
[1:13:50] you know I'm about my father's business
[1:13:52] mom woman woman
[1:13:56] he just he was the word he corrected it
[1:14:00] and so we got to be able to be rerouted
[1:14:03] but let the Holy Spirit use us and help
[1:14:06] to correct other people and we've got to
[1:14:08] manifest the word as well
[1:14:12] so I just thought I'd share these I
[1:14:14] never got to preach these on Sunday cuz
[1:14:16] you know it's going on I appreciate hour
[1:14:17] and a half on Sunday see his sinless
[1:14:20] nature express God's mercy he was the
[1:14:22] word so God expressed himself by that
[1:14:25] sinless nature
[1:14:26] - he had a word nature
[1:14:30] and therefore this one was so perfect
[1:14:34] with the father just the body that was
[1:14:36] here called the son that the word was
[1:14:38] him and the word was made flesh he was a
[1:14:43] walk Jesus was a walking Bible amen onca
[1:14:46] we need to be cherished amen to the best
[1:14:48] of our ability we can't we can't be all
[1:14:50] of it but Jesus was all this word
[1:14:53] he was just a walk in Scripture
[1:14:55] everything he said got filtered through
[1:14:57] the thinking man's filter the Word of
[1:14:59] God he filtered everything right through
[1:15:01] the word the Feres we used to say
[1:15:04] something should we give our money you
[1:15:06] know - to God or should we give our
[1:15:08] money - to Herod and it filtered it
[1:15:12] through the words that give two heroines
[1:15:14] Herod give to God what is God's if
[1:15:16] filter right through the word and then
[1:15:19] they finally errand they got so they got
[1:15:21] so upset they said they stop asking me
[1:15:22] questions I give up I can't handle this
[1:15:24] word Hey because you'll never check the
[1:15:28] learning they're never deceived away
[1:15:30] because the words forever settled in
[1:15:32] heaven amen
[1:15:33] in the beginning was the word the words
[1:15:35] with God the Word was God
[1:15:37] this is God's thoughts amen you'll never
[1:15:40] trick the word and pretty soon they gave
[1:15:41] up as a fire and I'm not asking him
[1:15:43] anything else and that's how that's how
[1:15:45] they do it like you and I will witness
[1:15:46] the people I'm pretty certain if if we
[1:15:48] they can't get us they'll just give up
[1:15:49] now I'm done talking to Jesse I'm done
[1:15:51] talking to Aaron they just give up
[1:15:53] because it's the word they're arguing
[1:15:55] with and they know they're wrong because
[1:15:57] every man has a conscience amen and they
[1:16:00] know they're wrong if they can't defeat
[1:16:02] this word
[1:16:03] that's right I
[1:16:06] think I got a couple more oh yeah I
[1:16:09] think I'm close to this one brother have
[1:16:10] said Jesus's body
[1:16:13] yeah God changed his dwelling place from
[1:16:15] a throne in the head the spaces yonder
[1:16:17] to the heart of his son Jesus Christ to
[1:16:19] live and reign forever God was in Christ
[1:16:21] he's the final resting place of the
[1:16:24] Spirit so the kids asked me a Bible Club
[1:16:25] are we ever to see God and I say well in
[1:16:27] one sense yeah you're gonna see them in
[1:16:29] Christ you'll never see in the visible
[1:16:32] spirit but you'll see God manifest in
[1:16:35] the flesh in christ
[1:16:37] jesus' body is the final resting place
[1:16:39] of God I'm not wonderful when we get to
[1:16:43] heaven and we see the nail-scarred hands
[1:16:44] the nail-scarred feet we can just hold
[1:16:46] those hands and say God is always gonna
[1:16:49] be in this body hey I can always touch
[1:16:52] God right here
[1:16:53] of course we'll have perfect bodies as
[1:16:55] well by His grace but just comforting to
[1:16:58] know the final place of God is the body
[1:17:00] of Jesus Christ all right now and I
[1:17:04] never got to that I'm gonna find a give
[1:17:07] me ten minutes I'll get a place to close
[1:17:09] here I'll do 15 okay you can switch off
[1:17:13] Liddy I'm not gonna preach out there
[1:17:14] anymore
[1:17:16] well you know what
[1:17:19] you know what let's go back there go
[1:17:22] back to it
[1:17:23] yeah I wish I could rather summers
[1:17:27] coming up I can go a lot longer in the
[1:17:29] summer I
[1:17:32] want to just go over these quotes real
[1:17:36] quick here oh yeah let's look at this
[1:17:37] one this is good
[1:17:39] now is listen to Mary's belief I
[1:17:41] preached it on Sunday but at the very
[1:17:43] beginning the first paragraph I
[1:17:45] understood let's bow for a word of
[1:17:47] Prayer Lord we're grateful to have this
[1:17:48] privilege of coming in the house of God
[1:17:50] I believe was written I was happy when
[1:17:52] they said to me let us go to the house
[1:17:53] of Lord and we know no greater privilege
[1:17:57] that we have
[1:18:00] than to come to thy house and worship
[1:18:03] thee
[1:18:05] no greater privilege so see children we
[1:18:08] have to and I'm in this too we're all in
[1:18:10] this we can't we can't make coming to
[1:18:13] church is something that something
[1:18:14] common we always have to remember this
[1:18:17] is the greatest privilege of our life
[1:18:19] because this is God's house God's Word
[1:18:22] his ways in the sanctuary right
[1:18:26] we can't let we can't ever let that
[1:18:29] become a common thing although we're
[1:18:31] just going to church again tonight it's
[1:18:33] Wednesday night it's so beautiful out
[1:18:35] there boy I'd like to go out there into
[1:18:36] the park we have to go in the park at
[1:18:38] another time because this is our time to
[1:18:40] hear from our Heavenly Father
[1:18:42] like Adam and Eve before sin God would
[1:18:46] come down and walk with them brother
[1:18:47] Graham said and fellowship with them in
[1:18:49] the cool of the evening well that's what
[1:18:50] we're doing here tonight we're
[1:18:52] fellowshiping with jesus hallelujah
[1:18:55] there's no greater privilege than to
[1:18:57] come to the house of God
[1:19:03] now let me
[1:19:05] I want to go to the responsibility yeah
[1:19:08] let's let's just review this here I
[1:19:10] don't know how much I've read on this
[1:19:13] but let's look at a responsibility again
[1:19:16] here
[1:19:22] well grams talking about the brothers
[1:19:24] Collins and Hickerson have they have
[1:19:26] gifts of tongues interpretation he said
[1:19:29] that's not the ministry brother never
[1:19:30] let some your ministry to the church I'm
[1:19:32] giving us as an example then you
[1:19:34] brethren should be just as interested in
[1:19:36] getting your ministry in the place in
[1:19:38] the house of God as the pastor is
[1:19:41] interested in getting his because it's
[1:19:43] just essential that you do it so it is
[1:19:47] absolutely essential that
[1:19:49] we get our gifts in their position in
[1:19:52] the house of God
[1:19:54] this is why I was such a burden for the
[1:19:56] home church and for people to come to
[1:19:58] house of God in faith in prayer already
[1:20:01] anointed right with the anointing
[1:20:03] because it's essential
[1:20:05] it's absolutely necessary for us to come
[1:20:08] to the house of God anointed of God
[1:20:11] ready to come and do what God has called
[1:20:14] us to do I'm glad I came ready ons I'm
[1:20:17] glad you came ready all winds earlier on
[1:20:18] Sunday because people got delivered Amen
[1:20:20] hallelujah
[1:20:22] it's so important that we do that
[1:20:26] yeah and this is well this is what I
[1:20:29] want to see in everybody's heart I want
[1:20:31] to see everybody interested in finding
[1:20:33] my place in the house of God where does
[1:20:36] God want me like brother have said even
[1:20:38] if I'm the doorkeeper at the house of
[1:20:39] the Lord which is a deacon right well at
[1:20:42] least deacons Otto brother man said the
[1:20:43] Deacons ought to open the door and say
[1:20:45] can I take show you to the cloakroom
[1:20:47] can I show you where to hang up your
[1:20:49] jacket can I find you a seat to sit in
[1:20:53] because the Bible says that I rather be
[1:20:55] the doorkeeper at the house of Lord than
[1:20:57] to dwell in the tents of the wicked I'd
[1:21:00] rather just just open the door for God's
[1:21:02] people it's such a blessing to open the
[1:21:04] door and we need to find our position
[1:21:07] the house of God now that just came to
[1:21:09] my mind here a quote
[1:21:15] yeah let me this one here let me just
[1:21:19] read it this is one of the fees in
[1:21:20] church age brother Branham said this is
[1:21:22] a far cry from Paul who said that when
[1:21:24] all came together all had the leading of
[1:21:27] the Spirit and all participated in
[1:21:28] spiritual worship
[1:21:31] so Saint Paul said we should come to
[1:21:33] church in 1st Corinthians 14 26 let's
[1:21:37] read that liddie can you switch well
[1:21:38] yeah I'll just pull it I
[1:21:43] hate to do that but
[1:21:46] brother Graham quotes 1st Corinthians 14
[1:21:49] 26
[1:21:52] let's just go there
[1:21:55] Bill Graham said everyone should come to
[1:21:57] church with a leading of the Holy Spirit
[1:22:03] alright we're getting to it oh boy it's
[1:22:06] so small
[1:22:10] there we go oh that's a little better is
[1:22:12] a little better all right no I already
[1:22:15] got highlighted okay I didn't actually
[1:22:16] prepare to do that but Paul says how is
[1:22:19] it then brethren when you come together
[1:22:20] every one of you hath the psalm so see
[1:22:23] some people are gonna come anointed to
[1:22:24] church with a song or a doctrine like
[1:22:27] Aaron and Hosea have shared good
[1:22:28] doctrines with me half a tongue hath a
[1:22:32] revelation
[1:22:32] half the interpretation that all things
[1:22:35] be done unto edifying so brother Branham
[1:22:38] says when all come together all had a
[1:22:41] leading of the Spirit and all
[1:22:42] participated in spiritual worship
[1:22:45] okay so everybody needs to be as
[1:22:47] interested as the pastor isn't getting
[1:22:49] ready for the service to have your gifts
[1:22:52] or your leading ready to go when you
[1:22:54] come to the house of God that's what
[1:22:56] brother Ram taught and that's why I
[1:22:57] think it's important that we teach that
[1:22:59] as well don't you don't you and so if if
[1:23:04] it's not there yet you know I'll be
[1:23:05] patient we'll all be patient but we want
[1:23:08] everybody to find you get to that place
[1:23:09] yes like we can see Amen he's kidding
[1:23:12] he's finding his place right you know
[1:23:13] he's being a blessing he's servant Mac I
[1:23:16] find this place you know Lydia's find a
[1:23:18] nice place back there everybody to find
[1:23:20] their place but this is where
[1:23:23] this is where we want everybody to be we
[1:23:27] want everybody to have like a revelation
[1:23:28] or and
[1:23:30] and edification something to build
[1:23:32] somebody up when they come to church a
[1:23:34] song a doctrine we want people to come
[1:23:37] to church with a leading of the Lord I
[1:23:39] just got this on my heart I just read
[1:23:41] this yesterday I just want to share this
[1:23:42] with you brother Aaron you know or
[1:23:43] something like that have a leading of
[1:23:46] the Lord cuz this is God's house this is
[1:23:49] where his ways here his truth is here
[1:23:52] his life is here Jesus is here amen amen
[1:23:56] now let me go back to the quotes here
[1:24:01] how's that
[1:24:04] now this is the one I read on Sunday
[1:24:06] brother have said a preacher can get the
[1:24:09] anointing but unless the congregation
[1:24:10] comes the same way it makes a difference
[1:24:14] congregation has to be ready to meet the
[1:24:16] Holy Spirit and then they'll weep their
[1:24:17] way to cut Christ amen and see you're
[1:24:20] just as a response woman and these
[1:24:22] ministers that's what I love about
[1:24:23] brother man's message it was a Bible
[1:24:25] message everybody is responsible for the
[1:24:28] service every person is just as
[1:24:31] important as me or Malachi or a Amen or
[1:24:35] brother harun or brother Jose anyone
[1:24:38] we're all equally responsible and
[1:24:41] important for the Holy Spirit to flow
[1:24:44] through the church
[1:24:45] everyone has a part and if all you can
[1:24:48] do is pray that's a great thing that's a
[1:24:51] great thing because prayer is what the
[1:24:54] most powerful weapon God ever gave to
[1:24:56] anybody
[1:25:01] remember there's going to day of
[1:25:03] reckoning the Bible actually calls your
[1:25:05] talents when God asks you about you what
[1:25:07] would you do with the talents I gave you
[1:25:08] the Jesus actually caught it a reckoning
[1:25:10] after a long time the Lord of those
[1:25:12] servants cometh and reckon it with him
[1:25:14] we got a day of reckoning God's gonna
[1:25:17] say what did you do at Bride of Christ
[1:25:19] fellowship he's gonna ask me right he's
[1:25:21] gonna ask you he's gonna ask the girls
[1:25:23] in the what did you do at by the Christ
[1:25:26] Fellowship or if God calls you different
[1:25:27] Church what'd you do there
[1:25:29] what'd you do with the talents that I
[1:25:31] gave you I'm so glad I'll be able to say
[1:25:34] well I sang the best I could I studied
[1:25:36] him preached and prayed as hard as I
[1:25:38] could I did everything I could Lord I
[1:25:40] gave all that I had to you and each one
[1:25:42] of us should be able to say Lord if you
[1:25:44] gave me a revelation I gave I gave me
[1:25:46] the edification whatever you gave me the
[1:25:48] tongue or the the prayers casting out
[1:25:50] demons whatever gave me I gave all I
[1:25:51] could to it
[1:25:53] amen
[1:25:54] and then I liked it jesus said if you
[1:25:57] gain ten pounds you get ten cities
[1:25:58] that's a pretty good trade-off
[1:26:01] amen ten pounds if you did ten times
[1:26:04] though you've multiplied your gift ten
[1:26:06] times I'll give you ten cities five
[1:26:07] times five cities one time or two times
[1:26:10] two cities
[1:26:12] it's fair
[1:26:14] now look I like these quotes I've never
[1:26:17] read these before these are brand not
[1:26:18] welcome brand new to us you met you buy
[1:26:20] heard him though brother brands in
[1:26:22] Prescott Arizona at the end of his life
[1:26:24] and he hears children singing I hear
[1:26:26] these little boys voices these boys you
[1:26:28] could be like an Elvis Presley selling
[1:26:30] your birthright but see you don't want
[1:26:32] that see it's a talent God gave you so
[1:26:35] the girls keep singing specials it's a
[1:26:38] talent God gave you you believe that
[1:26:42] caris you believe that
[1:26:45] it's a talent little little boys little
[1:26:48] girls too talent God gave me
[1:26:52] see it's a talent and you've got to
[1:26:54] choose where you're gonna use that
[1:26:55] talent twofer God or whether you're
[1:26:57] gonna use it for the devil see he said
[1:27:00] brother Leo here now Leo ended up he
[1:27:01] ended up turning out to be a homosexual
[1:27:04] but he started out good brother Ram was
[1:27:06] up he was at they started a church in
[1:27:08] Arizona and they started out good but
[1:27:10] the RAM said they were doing good but
[1:27:12] after brother Branham died they got back
[1:27:14] slidden they turned to me a homosexuals
[1:27:16] it's been proven people have people have
[1:27:19] known them like you can ask sister Karen
[1:27:20] bro loris about that
[1:27:22] brother Leo now look this is why this is
[1:27:24] so striking to see now he this man who
[1:27:28] turned out to be a homosexual later he
[1:27:31] had a talent to come and lead the people
[1:27:33] now that to be that blows my mind
[1:27:35] now if that's the case then God every
[1:27:39] leader has a talent to lead people
[1:27:42] so brother leo brother Jesse brother
[1:27:48] Samuel for the Brooks for the camp all
[1:27:50] have a talent to lead people some have
[1:27:53] more than others
[1:27:55] now what's he gonna do with it now the
[1:27:58] sad thing is we know what he did with it
[1:27:59] they started a little compound out there
[1:28:02] in Arizona like a cult and then they're
[1:28:05] sort of getting all kinds of bad reports
[1:28:07] and pretty soon abuse rose up you can
[1:28:10] ask Karen Karen and Horace button
[1:28:13] and so we know what they did with their
[1:28:16] talents out there we know it was the
[1:28:18] wrong thing
[1:28:19] is he going into a business and make
[1:28:21] himself a meaner or should he come out
[1:28:23] here and make a home or people that
[1:28:25] wants to come together and get all you
[1:28:26] little children see you have to choose
[1:28:28] what going to do
[1:28:29] each of us has to make a choice and it's
[1:28:32] confronted to us we're all confronted
[1:28:34] with this one thing what are we gonna do
[1:28:35] about eternal life we're going to live
[1:28:38] here after or not then we have to come
[1:28:40] to Jesus to get that the opportunity of
[1:28:42] choosing that's one thing God gave to us
[1:28:46] he don't force something on us he just
[1:28:49] lets us make our own choice he have to
[1:28:51] not be forced but just make your own
[1:28:54] choice
[1:28:58] now I told you if I'd never told my what
[1:29:02] my I never knew I'd be a pastor brother
[1:29:03] I never do that my wife knows that you
[1:29:06] know I in high school I was never
[1:29:07] thought well I'm gonna be a spiritual
[1:29:08] preacher you know I'm gonna be a
[1:29:09] spiritual person I never thought that
[1:29:11] but I do know I was a leader in sports
[1:29:15] the the the I can show you the the news
[1:29:18] articles they called me I was the game
[1:29:20] they called me Jesse's gang
[1:29:21] so I was the leader on the team I was a
[1:29:24] captain and things like that so I can
[1:29:26] see well if you got a talent to lead
[1:29:27] people see
[1:29:30] that whole time when I was younger I had
[1:29:32] a talent to lead
[1:29:34] but I didn't know it was for God
[1:29:36] until I got here I see oh he's got me to
[1:29:40] lead the people of God amen
[1:29:43] because athletics dies no one cares
[1:29:46] records are broken it's nonsense it's
[1:29:48] useless
[1:29:49] even even though the Book of Psalms says
[1:29:51] or the Book of Proverbs says it's vain
[1:29:54] to trust in the legs of man you ever see
[1:29:55] that scripture
[1:29:56] those basketball players are trusting
[1:29:59] their legs to Duncan you know they they
[1:30:02] trust in their legs and God said it's
[1:30:03] vain to trust in the legs of man or the
[1:30:06] legs of horses you trust in the Living
[1:30:08] God amen
[1:30:11] see that's a talent and then rogram
[1:30:15] tells them about the story of the
[1:30:17] brother who said you've chose my way
[1:30:20] he said thou do this than by your own
[1:30:22] choosing you picked the most the correct
[1:30:25] and precise decision and it's my way but
[1:30:28] the God said it's your choosing you
[1:30:30] chose the right way brother Branham and
[1:30:32] so a huge portion of heaven awaits you
[1:30:34] see was it a 10-10 city portion I'd
[1:30:38] imagined my ram is at least ten cities
[1:30:40] right that's the most Jesus gave anybody
[1:30:42] in the parable so I imagine he had ten I
[1:30:45] know Paul has ten for sure because he
[1:30:47] said I labored more than all of them we
[1:30:49] know Paul had ten
[1:30:51] all right
[1:30:53] now let me just find a little one more
[1:30:56] thing to close on here I
[1:30:58] think there was a to get to here
[1:31:02] at the bottom of my notes
[1:31:05] bear with me let's say to our feet no
[1:31:07] that way I know how to close soon here
[1:31:18] yes sir
[1:31:27] yeah Luka Burnham says in light and
[1:31:30] their eye in the resurrection life he
[1:31:31] says your pastors supposed to be a
[1:31:33] righteous man he said the congregation
[1:31:35] is supposed to be with him 100%
[1:31:38] you're supposed to be just a hundred
[1:31:41] percent together and in there if you're
[1:31:43] not then Satan's got a way to get in you
[1:31:46] said you got a loophole some we're going
[1:31:48] to have everything cleared out see we
[1:31:50] got to be United as a pastor in the
[1:31:52] congregation we got to be so United you
[1:31:55] and I had to be just so interested in
[1:31:58] getting into our place in the house of
[1:32:00] God and coming to church with the
[1:32:02] leading I thought interested in that
[1:32:04] then you've got to be interested that
[1:32:05] too we all got to find the leading of
[1:32:07] the Holy Ghost for each service that's
[1:32:09] right and I think that's so important
[1:32:11] don't you I think it's extremely
[1:32:13] important
[1:32:15] yeah what I'll do is I'll just I think I
[1:32:17] know what it is it's the scripture about
[1:32:18] the pillar
[1:32:20] yeah I mentioned this a few weeks ago
[1:32:22] let's just close with that thought
[1:32:24] there's my 15 minutes revelation 3:12
[1:32:27] him that overcometh will i make a pillar
[1:32:30] in the temple of my god and he should go
[1:32:32] out go no more out and I'll write upon
[1:32:36] him the name of my god in the name of
[1:32:37] the city of my god which is New
[1:32:39] Jerusalem which cometh down out of
[1:32:41] heaven from my god and I'll write upon
[1:32:43] him my new name so
[1:32:47] look at the reward of Christ now here's
[1:32:50] what I found striking David said I've
[1:32:53] got one desire to dwell in the house of
[1:32:55] God right all the days of my life
[1:32:58] so we if we're faithful to Jesus we
[1:33:02] actually get David's desire because not
[1:33:06] only are we in the house of God we're a
[1:33:08] pillar in the house of God amen which
[1:33:11] means we're right we're gonna be there
[1:33:12] the whole time
[1:33:13] we're not going anywhere we're part of
[1:33:15] that foundation the Bible says that in
[1:33:18] 1st Corinthians 3 we are part of the
[1:33:20] foundation with the Apostles in Jesus
[1:33:23] Christ Jesus Christ is the chief
[1:33:25] Cornerstone amen we are part of the
[1:33:28] pillar of the house of God
[1:33:32] so I love that dave was longing for that
[1:33:35] ah remember he's got a heart after the
[1:33:37] heart of God so what does God's heart
[1:33:39] God's heart is that I want to be with
[1:33:41] the case you forever I'm gonna make her
[1:33:43] a pillar in the house in my house right
[1:33:46] my heart God says I want Malachi to be
[1:33:49] in my house I want Liddy to be in my
[1:33:50] house all the days all the days of their
[1:33:53] life
[1:33:54] God said I'm gonna and David said I've
[1:33:56] got a heart after God's heart so David I
[1:33:59] want to be in the house of God I want to
[1:34:01] be where God's Word is I want to be we
[1:34:03] be where God's spirits pouring out all
[1:34:04] the time and that is the heart of God I
[1:34:08] want to be with my children want to be
