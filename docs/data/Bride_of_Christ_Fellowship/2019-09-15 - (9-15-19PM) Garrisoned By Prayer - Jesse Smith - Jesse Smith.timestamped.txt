[23:24] [Music]
[23:29] in spite of the store
[23:36] [Music]
[23:42] [Music]
[23:48] the race of gods could be back in the
[24:34] house of Lord with all the saints had a
[24:40] wonderful time this morning and
[24:42] appreciate everybody's patience you know
[24:44] we start a little later I try not to
[24:46] preach two hours tonight okay I got to
[24:49] crazy there's such a great wonderful
[24:51] presence of the Lord and so great to
[24:54] have such a wonderful time worshiping
[24:57] the Lord I trust the Lord spoke to your
[24:58] heart and trust he'll do the same for us
[25:01] here tonight I like to go to a strange
[25:04] text first chronicles 18 I like to
[25:08] preach a just a little maybe see a
[25:11] little thought but it's I haven't really
[25:14] had all the time I wanted to vote to it
[25:15] but I almost want to start it I want to
[25:19] preach on garrisoned by prayer I just
[25:22] want to look at prayer and fasting a
[25:23] little bit tonight by God's grace and
[25:27] I've got this you know from a quote from
[25:30] brother Branham in 1961 which I'll read
[25:32] in just a moment but years ago I
[25:35] preached this little thought how Joshua
[25:39] and Israel didn't possess all the land
[25:42] God had actually promised them and
[25:44] judges chapter 1 says because God was
[25:47] going to use
[25:48] the rows remaining inhabitants to prove
[25:50] Israel but then later some 800 years
[25:55] later David he finally through all of
[25:57] his victories he finally possesses the
[26:00] full land and when he does he sets up
[26:03] Garrison's and then brother Branham says
[26:06] these represent prayer so let's read
[26:10] first chronicles 18 verse 6 so we see
[26:24] David you know brother Branham said it
[26:25] types Christ
[26:26] you know David types Christ Salomon
[26:29] types the Millenium so here David is on
[26:33] such a role as far as such a string of
[26:37] victories because of his obedience to
[26:38] the Lord verse 6 then David put
[26:42] Garrison's in Syria Damascus and the
[26:45] Syrians became David's servants and
[26:47] brought gifts thus the Lord preserved
[26:50] David whithersoever he went so see how
[26:55] these Garrison's provided him protection
[26:58] praise God let's have a word of Prayer
[27:00] here mean on your heart just make it
[27:02] known unto God Heavenly Father Lord we
[27:04] just bow our heads one more time in your
[27:05] divine presence we wherever two or three
[27:08] gathered there you are in our midst
[27:09] we're thankful that you're here Lord
[27:11] here tonight my promise help us to
[27:13] recognize your presence Lord God yours
[27:15] revealed in simplicity help us to see
[27:17] the simplicity Lord of your word tonight
[27:20] and father list let your presence be
[27:23] felt that our hearts be change and Lord
[27:26] molded to be more like you fed strength
[27:28] and encouraged edified for the glory of
[27:31] God let your kingdom continue to grow in
[27:34] our arm it's Lord God in our lives and
[27:37] each person find their position Lord God
[27:39] as we've been laboring on these thoughts
[27:41] and father will give you all the glory
[27:43] in Jesus Christ name the church said
[27:46] Amen god bless should be in seated
[27:47] praise God I think I'll start with this
[27:55] quotation here and
[27:58] well then we'll move on from there by
[28:00] God's grace this is from Revelation
[28:02] chapter 4 part 3 it's a 1961 so he says
[28:12] he's I'd have to do a interpreter here
[28:14] tonight so I go a little faster here
[28:17] Jose did a great job brother thank you
[28:19] sir a great job
[28:20] appreciate you we'll see if this
[28:22] continues how we might be working
[28:23] together for a little bit here you don't
[28:27] know you're gonna resign a great job
[28:32] great job sir brother Branham says in
[28:35] 1961 he said and God he's praying as I
[28:40] go out yonder in the field to face the
[28:43] foe may I realize that I'm garrisoned
[28:48] every hour by prayer and I just struck
[28:52] me I have this I've had this quote
[28:53] laying in my notes for like years I want
[28:56] to preach on that one I want to preach
[28:57] on that one time and so I preached it up
[28:59] in Albion you know a few weeks ago at
[29:01] the Labor Day meetings and it was a real
[29:04] blessing and so I kind of want to bring
[29:05] it here you should I preached everything
[29:07] here first but I just kind of added it
[29:08] in there wasn't in my notes it just kind
[29:10] of was added in there the Holy Spirit
[29:11] kind of brought to my memory but I think
[29:14] I could spend a lot more time on it here
[29:16] of course he said oh he said may I
[29:20] realize I'm Garrison every hour by
[29:22] prayer oh how I depend on that garrison
[29:26] notice he depends upon it he's got to
[29:30] have this the enemy approaching but know
[29:35] that the garrison hold because mothers
[29:39] know so who he says here who's praying
[29:40] for him mothers and fathers and boys and
[29:45] girls Christians born-again with the
[29:49] experience heaven bound people is on
[29:52] their knees praying Oh God
[29:55] give deliverance amen beautiful huh in
[29:59] that glorious and father we pray we pray
[30:02] that you'll let us get out into the
[30:06] enemy's lines out yonder and
[30:11] conquer every precious soul he said
[30:14] that's waiting do Lord and bring them
[30:17] out of darkness into light for we ask it
[30:21] in Jesus name Amen in that beautiful
[30:23] quote when I first heard that years ago
[30:26] that just struck me as when I was
[30:27] preaching on the revelation seers well
[30:29] I'm still not done with it but I'm still
[30:30] on it but I just want to bring out a few
[30:32] things out of here
[30:33] how brother Graham likens Garrison's
[30:36] unto prayer now as I mentioned just
[30:39] briefly you you remember that where
[30:42] Joshua didn't possess everything because
[30:45] God had held him back and we know that
[30:48] Joshua crossing over into the promised
[30:51] land represents the the book of Acts
[30:54] church it represents believers today
[30:56] right we God saves us out of Egypt and
[31:00] we come through the waters of the Red
[31:02] Sea praise God and we see all of our
[31:04] addictions and all of our love for the
[31:06] world we see them all drowned in the
[31:08] blood of Christ amen and then we come
[31:12] out into the hot scorching wilderness of
[31:16] sanctification to prove us whether we
[31:18] will possess the land or not whether
[31:21] we'll believe it or not and then the
[31:24] leadership of the word the word goes
[31:26] before us right God leads us over Jordan
[31:29] and leads us to possess the promised
[31:32] land amen and we know bro BAM said that
[31:34] Joshua of course types out Ephesians
[31:38] right so it's the modern so our modern
[31:41] church is the the anti-type of Joshua
[31:45] praise God and there there's was of
[31:48] course a natural possession as well but
[31:50] it typed that what's what's going on
[31:52] spiritually today praise God and so
[31:56] knowing that I want to bring up a few
[31:59] more scriptures here I and I didn't
[32:01] really I guess I didn't have time to put
[32:02] them all together but what happened was
[32:07] they overcame Jericho right they
[32:09] defeated Jericho and then after that
[32:12] they went to AI and then you know the
[32:14] story Bri you know kind of vaguely how
[32:17] they spent years fighting and then after
[32:20] a while Caleb stood up and said it's
[32:22] time to possess the land praise God
[32:24] we
[32:24] been fighting we've been driving these
[32:25] guys out but now it's time for me I've
[32:29] been fighting for everybody else now
[32:30] it's time for me to possess the Promised
[32:32] Land and then he did that at 85 years
[32:36] old so if you get a little older don't
[32:38] feel bad you got victories ahead of you
[32:40] a man like Brendan was telling me her
[32:42] life's been changed amen so she's been
[32:45] seen a lot of great victories in her
[32:46] life by God's grace and that's what we
[32:48] all want to see we all want to see God
[32:50] helping us overcome praise God and then
[32:55] we know of course you know that they got
[32:56] established in Joshua and and then all
[32:59] the saints after that come out but
[33:03] finally pretty soon they got a prophet
[33:05] and a king right with Samuel and Saul
[33:07] and then they got a David praise got a
[33:09] man after God's own heart praise God and
[33:12] bro man that course symbolizes that with
[33:14] Christ and brother man talks about how
[33:18] you know David's mighty men knew he was
[33:20] coming into power praise God and how we
[33:22] know Christ is coming into power
[33:24] hallelujah amen of course it's not all
[33:27] it's not a perfect type you know but we
[33:31] just see that we see that the symbolism
[33:33] there in other words we're fighting for
[33:35] Jesus Christ amen
[33:37] his kingdom is going to expand to every
[33:41] last Soul as we saw in Wednesday night
[33:43] it's not gonna fill the earth in fact
[33:45] it's gonna get smaller and smaller the
[33:48] Roman Catholic Church and the daughters
[33:50] are gonna fill the earth there that's
[33:53] that grain of mustardseed
[33:55] parable Jesus told but ours is gonna
[33:58] grow in the sense that it's gonna get
[33:59] it's gonna go all the way around the
[34:01] world to get every last predestinated
[34:03] seed in other words every child of God
[34:05] is gonna possess his land every child of
[34:09] God is going to be born again and then
[34:12] when that happens
[34:13] then it's time for the transition over
[34:16] to Solomon over to the Golden Age praise
[34:19] God amen thank the Lord for that the
[34:22] Golden Age a time of peace praise God
[34:24] and Solomon did have peace as long as he
[34:26] loved the Lord of course that's where we
[34:29] know that after we started loving the
[34:30] women in his older days that's when he
[34:33] started falling away in building houses
[34:35] of idolatry so I just
[34:38] you to see a few things here let's go to
[34:41] proverbs 25 28 I just want to I just
[34:45] want to start with this because I feel
[34:47] like this is a message for mature
[34:49] Christians this isn't for beginners when
[34:53] we talk about prayer and fasting this
[34:55] isn't for beginners it's for mature
[34:57] Christians that are borned again and I
[35:01] think you'll see as we go along and look
[35:03] at some of these scriptures I think
[35:04] you'll see that that's true proverbs 25
[35:08] 28 Thank You Lydia wonderful he that
[35:12] hath no rule over his own spirit is like
[35:14] a city that is broken down and without
[35:18] walls now I just want you to see the
[35:21] symbolism here a city let's say
[35:24] Jerusalem right you know Nehemiah Ezra
[35:27] servable
[35:28] they had to rebuild the wall around the
[35:30] city of course that's not the same time
[35:33] as we're talking now but I'm just using
[35:34] it as an example when they came back the
[35:37] first thing they did was rebuild the
[35:38] house of God so they could sacrifice and
[35:40] it wasn't until years later that they
[35:42] finally built the wall right so so
[35:47] symbolically they got to build up
[35:49] christ-like character and here Solomon
[35:54] of all people of all people talking
[35:56] about self-control which he lost later
[36:00] on alive mercy of course he didn't have
[36:02] access to the Holy Ghost so I'm not I'm
[36:04] not degrading him or anything like that
[36:06] but just it's striking the person who
[36:08] wrote about it fell from it and in other
[36:11] words we want to live and practice what
[36:13] we preach we've got to be faithful we
[36:16] have we have more responsibility because
[36:18] those seals have been loosed we know and
[36:20] so he's likening unto a wall around a
[36:23] city as self-control and that's
[36:27] temperance which is on the Statue of a
[36:29] perfect man right faith virtue knowledge
[36:32] temperance it's a four step so the Bible
[36:36] likens when you can build a life of self
[36:39] control where you crucify the the
[36:42] passions of your flesh the Bible likens
[36:45] to that now your city has walls but but
[36:50] you still got a huge country
[36:52] Ezreal still had miles and miles and
[36:54] miles of country where enemies can seep
[36:58] in are you with me where invaders can
[37:02] slip through the backdoor right they can
[37:05] they can encroach upon the land and so
[37:08] that's what I want you to see this is
[37:10] what I mean by I think
[37:12] you again you you but that you're but
[37:14] you're going there you're building up a
[37:16] life of character where now you've got
[37:18] faith virtue and knowledge now you've
[37:20] got temperance now you've got
[37:22] self-control and it's like a wall around
[37:24] your home city or your capital right
[37:27] it's a wall around your your soul we'd
[37:30] say you know you got self-control
[37:34] because the Bible says if you can't rule
[37:36] over it it's like your walls are broken
[37:39] down praise God and if I like what the
[37:42] Bible says I like how the Bible picks it
[37:44] up in the Old Testament I forget which
[37:45] prophet it was but the Bible said that
[37:48] the God's Spirit would be like a fire a
[37:50] wall of fire around his people praise
[37:52] God amen hallelujah which represents a
[37:56] greater fortification a greater
[37:58] protection God's own spirit protecting
[38:01] his people praise God the fire of the
[38:03] Holy Ghost amen
[38:04] so there's a great sea I haven't really
[38:06] fully developed that thought I'd like to
[38:08] study on that a little more and so we
[38:12] see that that that a wall around the
[38:15] city is a great achievement remember the
[38:18] people rejoice and in Ezra's day in
[38:21] Nehemiah they rejoice they shouted some
[38:23] of them wet because you know that wasn't
[38:26] as big the temple wasn't as big but but
[38:28] when they got the wall built all the
[38:29] enemies were astonished mother did that
[38:31] quickly that's what we rejoice in when
[38:34] we see God do a great work amongst us
[38:36] praise God God will save somebody clean
[38:38] them up film what the Holy Ghost and
[38:40] just go like that what a great work of
[38:43] God amen maybe it took us no longer
[38:46] maybe took them a little shorter but it
[38:48] just goes to show how quickly God can
[38:50] get somebody's life in order praise God
[38:52] look at the Apostle Paul nah he was
[38:54] hating Christians the next week he's
[38:55] filled with the Holy Ghost my through I
[38:57] think was three days later when it
[38:58] because he was blind for three days
[39:00] praying and fasting and then he gets the
[39:03] Holy Ghost he said arise received thy
[39:05] sight be baptized and received the Holy
[39:07] Ghost not mine within four days we've
[39:10] three days three days afterwards he's
[39:12] already got the Holy Ghost God does a
[39:14] quick and mighty work amen B a short
[39:17] quick work we know for the rapture to
[39:19] thank the Lord but now if you are gonna
[39:22] expand your territory then
[39:26] take more battles more victory I think
[39:28] that's what we're singing our lives
[39:30] right as time goes on as the world gets
[39:32] darker we've got to be able to fight
[39:34] like brother Bram said that quote we've
[39:36] got to be able to fight to go out there
[39:37] and challenge the enemy to possess more
[39:41] land how many want to possess more of
[39:42] the land in your life like you feel like
[39:45] there's like I'm sure Jose feels that
[39:47] bang oh no no no you brothers sisters
[39:48] feel like there's more for me to do
[39:50] there's there's more to like we saw the
[39:52] quote last week life is more than just
[39:55] going to work and coming home it's even
[39:57] more than just coming to church and go
[39:58] back home there's greater things about
[40:00] it as far as saving souls seeing the
[40:03] sick healed
[40:04] let us sing God change people's hearts
[40:07] do great things amen
[40:08] there could be nothing greater than
[40:10] saving a soul praise God and that's what
[40:13] we want to see but we know of course you
[40:15] know Jesus had a few there be that find
[40:16] at the end time we know there be fewer
[40:18] and fewer but we can't let that
[40:19] discourage us we've still got to be able
[40:21] to be warriors and go out there and
[40:23] fight against the enemy praise God I
[40:25] like that quote that's why I think that
[40:27] was such a special quote let me just
[40:31] read that again real quick so it's all
[40:32] my mind you'll let us I pray you let us
[40:36] guard the enemy's lines and conquer
[40:38] every precious soul that's waiting amen
[40:42] hallelujah so now the garrison as you've
[40:46] seen the time of David now he sets them
[40:49] up so garrison symbolizes the protective
[40:53] favor or the hand of the Lord it's more
[40:58] than where I can control myself not to
[41:01] worry about you know lusting after this
[41:02] or struggle with that or my my mouth get
[41:05] me in trouble so much I mean you got
[41:07] that you know you yeah that's the wall
[41:09] around the city but this garrison
[41:11] represents you have protection on your
[41:14] entire borders praise God which Joshua
[41:18] didn't have that they didn't have the
[41:19] privilege of that right
[41:23] even in the life of some of the Saints
[41:25] here let me look at the Old Testament
[41:27] here even life of some of the old Saints
[41:29] it was a great thing when Jonathan
[41:33] started conquering the Philistines
[41:35] remember that
[41:36] let's read it us go to 1st Samuel 13
[41:38] verse 3 it was a great thing see the
[41:52] Philistines were kind of defeating the
[41:57] Israel right they were kind of they they
[42:00] were they were overpowering them right
[42:02] it was a great thing when Jonathan
[42:05] starts fighting for God in God's name
[42:09] right fighting for Israel and God's name
[42:10] and he starts getting victories by
[42:12] defeating Philistine Garrison's right
[42:17] because they were they would had moved
[42:19] in and encamped in on God's inheritance
[42:22] that land wasn't the Philistines that
[42:24] was the Israelites land amen in other
[42:28] words we can say like this your health
[42:31] is your land amen your good health
[42:34] that's part of your inheritance amen I
[42:36] mean so like this this is the most
[42:38] important one you're lost loved ones
[42:40] that's your inheritance ain't ahead
[42:42] hallelujah and the enemy will move in or
[42:45] maybe you're born that way that it was
[42:47] already moved in and it's our job by the
[42:51] grace of God to go out and push back to
[42:53] Garrison's right to increase the land or
[42:57] to possess all of our inheritance
[43:01] hey like my band prayed and souls that
[43:04] are in prison now remember he was
[43:05] praying and pleading with
[43:08] Lord expand your Hara Tori praise God
[43:11] and let us see our family serving the
[43:14] Lord hallelujah
[43:15] now I says Jonathan smoke the garrison
[43:18] of Philistines that was in chiba or giba
[43:20] and the Philistines heard of it and saw
[43:22] blew the trumpet throughout the land
[43:23] saying let the Hebrews hear
[43:26] praise God now he does this a a number
[43:28] of times
[43:34] here's another one let's go to chapter
[43:36] 14 verse 6 yeah this whole chapter is
[43:50] about this where he Jonathan sneaks in
[43:52] with his armor-bearer and they defeat
[43:54] some Garrison's of the Philistines and
[43:55] then Saul takes all the credit you know
[43:58] how he was he just saw he would he
[44:01] wanted the people happy you know or he
[44:03] wanted the love of the people instead of
[44:04] David a little bit of encouragement he
[44:08] was kind of jealous verse 6 and Jonathan
[44:11] said to the man that bear his armor come
[44:12] and let us go over unto the garrison
[44:14] these uncircumcised it may be that the
[44:16] Lord will work for us for there's no
[44:19] restraint I love this to the Lord to say
[44:22] by many or few Amen what a revelation
[44:24] this guy had he said we know we're call
[44:27] of God to fight against these
[44:29] Philistines and he said perhaps God will
[44:33] deliver us in or deliver them into our
[44:36] hand because it doesn't matter to God
[44:38] the numbers God's not looking at the
[44:40] natural numbers God's looking at his
[44:42] will amen
[44:43] God's looking at what is he doing right
[44:45] now amen
[44:47] and so we know he gets the victory
[44:48] praise the Lord hallelujah
[44:54] and he actually gets the revelation in
[44:57] verse 12 yeah the revelation comes there
[44:59] in verse 12 14 12 and the men of the
[45:01] garrison answered Jonathan his armor
[45:02] barbers had come up to us and we will
[45:04] show you a thing and Jonathan said in
[45:06] his armor armor bear come up after me
[45:08] for the LORD hath deliver them into the
[45:10] hand of Israel
[45:11] oh my in that glorious that's what we
[45:14] want to see we want to see the Lord
[45:16] deliver our loved ones from the enemy
[45:19] praise God
[45:20] we want to see oh it's God's will to
[45:22] save this loved one it's God's will to
[45:24] heal this sick one amen
[45:26] and we want to see the the land
[45:28] possessed because it's our possession
[45:31] it's our inheritance praise God and so
[45:34] that's where this is such a beautiful
[45:36] picture here of God's people starting to
[45:40] get to those outer realms and possessing
[45:43] all that God has for them
[45:45] amen amen now in other words like we
[45:49] said last Sunday that we can know God's
[45:51] will for our life and I only know it but
[45:53] do it because the anointed ones the end
[45:56] times in Matthew 7 they knew the will of
[45:58] God they just didn't do it and so Jesus
[46:00] says I never knew you so see the only
[46:03] way to know God is to know his
[46:05] possessions for you and actually achieve
[46:08] and and possess all that God has for you
[46:10] that's the only way you know God amen is
[46:12] to do his will praise God
[46:14] oh that's beautiful amen hallelujah
[46:21] yeah there's parallel passages here I'll
[46:25] just read them 2nd Samuel 8 6 I guess
[46:29] the day you can put it up there remember
[46:35] the Bible said church this Bible said
[46:37] how it's gonna go be encouraged
[46:40] he said step by step little by little
[46:43] you'll take the land amen brother bang
[46:46] we've been at this for 13 years let's
[46:47] keep going brother
[46:48] little by little we'll take this land
[46:50] right amen little by little ain't gonna
[46:54] be an easy thing but it's gonna be
[46:57] constant battles constant prayers right
[47:01] you some garrison my prayer amen
[47:03] I'm protected by prayers and what's
[47:07] keeping me what's keeping you is our
[47:09] prayers one for another praise God amen
[47:12] second Samuel 86 then Dave would put
[47:15] Garrison's in Syria of Damascus and the
[47:16] Syrians became servants to David and
[47:18] brought gifts and the Lord preserved
[47:21] David whithersoever he went now it
[47:25] repeats in verse 14 second samuel 8:14
[47:28] and he put Garrison's and eat them
[47:30] throughout all eat them see not look
[47:32] he's starting to possess the other land
[47:33] see
[47:34] Edom he's starting to drive out I mean
[47:37] starting to go into other territories
[47:39] possess those territories throughout all
[47:41] Edom put he Garrison's and all they have
[47:43] eaten became david servants and the Lord
[47:46] preserve David with herself with her
[47:48] server he went I Got News for if you
[47:50] don't know a church but right here is
[47:52] your Edom right here
[47:53] praise God don't you want to push out
[47:56] push out all the all the slavery of the
[48:00] flesh praise God and be truly devoted
[48:03] and say like this so your ministry your
[48:08] personal ministry as we pass out that
[48:09] paper whatever may be your personal
[48:12] ministry can reach its full it's the
[48:14] fullness of its fruitfulness can say
[48:16] like that so you can reach your
[48:18] fruitfulness remember the foolish virgin
[48:20] doesn't really produce any fruit for God
[48:23] it's only that last kind of heart and
[48:26] they'll produce thirtyfold sixtyfold or
[48:28] a hundredfold only those who are born
[48:31] again with honest and seer sincere
[48:34] hearts will bring forth fruit unto God
[48:36] hey man so see as the bride of Jesus
[48:39] Christ with the revelation of the word
[48:41] we should also seek God for the
[48:44] revelation of his will for our lives the
[48:47] ministries for our lives that we can do
[48:51] all that God has for us to praise God
[48:53] and we can see fruitfulness in our lives
[48:55] think about that as some of those
[48:58] scriptures that we are I put on the
[48:59] sheet here you remember when Tabitha
[49:02] died those women were so sad but they
[49:04] came up and going Peter look at these
[49:06] clothes he did what a testimony mine she
[49:09] just look at what a mighty testimony
[49:12] look how many look all the hours she
[49:15] invests in clothing the poor see even
[49:18] though she'd pass they're still
[49:19] testifying look at the memorials of her
[49:22] life praise God look at all the people
[49:24] this is just proof see she devotes she
[49:27] put her hands to work clothing people
[49:29] that didn't have any clothes and God
[49:31] thought so much that he said I'm gonna
[49:33] raise her from the dead Peter get them
[49:34] all out of here raise this woman from
[49:36] the dead he said get up Tabitha as he
[49:39] got up
[49:39] amen get up see she had she had more did
[49:44] she must have more to do for the kingdom
[49:45] of God and that was part of
[49:48] ministry now that the beautiful part of
[49:50] that too is that Peter had seen Jesus do
[49:52] that oh that's what good that's what's
[49:55] good for us if we see God do a miracle
[49:58] like like we've seen before if we've
[50:00] seen God do America that we should learn
[50:02] from it whether it's through us or not
[50:05] and then the next time it comes up we
[50:07] should be able to be victorious in that
[50:08] one that in that way like the one time I
[50:11] was in Guyana I was gonna go pray for
[50:13] this dear woman and she fell down before
[50:16] I could get to her and I was all
[50:17] confused she actually hit her head on a
[50:19] chair as she fell and I thought mine
[50:22] that doesn't seem to be the Lord but I
[50:24] didn't know better so I just everyone
[50:26] was rejoicing but I was like okay well I
[50:28] just go down and pray for anyway and as
[50:30] soon as I did she started fighting and
[50:31] pushing against me because that was a
[50:33] demon that did that the demon didn't
[50:35] want me to lay hands on her so I learned
[50:38] the next time so I learned from that I
[50:40] come back and preach at Albion a few
[50:43] years or a year or two after that and
[50:45] the same thing happened with a man John
[50:47] Graham was right there he could tell you
[50:48] about he was right there I went to lay
[50:50] my hands on this woman and pray for and
[50:52] she fell down and I thought oh I know
[50:53] that's that devil that's that trick of
[50:55] the devil I've seen that before and as
[50:58] soon as I went to I can still see you in
[51:01] my mind because I went to pray for her
[51:02] she was laying flat on her back she
[51:03] started kicking and punching like that
[51:05] but I just I just found a way to put my
[51:07] arm on her head on her shoulder
[51:09] something started praying and pretty
[51:11] soon it all passed by and she rose up
[51:13] happy and and that demon was cast out by
[51:16] God's grace was he learning from that
[51:19] learning from these situations is is
[51:22] what we need to do praise God so Peter
[51:24] learned from that how Jesus raised the
[51:26] person from the dead the Jairus daughter
[51:28] so he applied that now to Tabitha now
[51:31] that's what we need don't we we need to
[51:34] have experiences with God learn and then
[51:37] be able to work it out ourselves the
[51:39] next time in other words we need to grow
[51:42] in grace and knowledge of the Lord
[51:45] praise the Lord so hope that's a
[51:49] good example I always try to think of
[51:51] examples in my life where I've learned
[51:52] some of these things because I don't
[51:54] want to preach about things I don't know
[51:55] who I want to preach about things that I
[51:56] know praise God I know it's the literal
[51:59] truth of God all right
[52:02] so again we see the Lord is preserving
[52:05] David wherever he went so that's why I
[52:07] said when when we are establishing a
[52:10] very consistent prayer life then the
[52:14] Bible said it's God's preservation it's
[52:17] God's protection it's kind of the hedge
[52:19] that God put around job he must have
[52:22] been so faithful right all those memory
[52:25] you prayed for his children if something
[52:26] happened god forbid if anything would
[52:27] happen here's a sacrifice for them god
[52:29] if anything should happen and it's a
[52:32] good thing he did it too right and so
[52:36] see it was like a hedge and and because
[52:38] of his faithfulness got it honor that
[52:40] that faithfulness and he put a hedge
[52:42] around that well that's what we see
[52:44] garrison should be but a man realized
[52:46] the only success I have is because
[52:49] people are praying at Garrison's for me
[52:51] amen
[52:52] there's a garrison in Jeffersonville
[52:54] maybe there's a garrison in Arkansas
[52:56] there's a garrison not in Florida
[52:58] there's all these Garrison's and they're
[53:00] just their soldiers who at their posts
[53:03] of duty ready to fight off any enemy and
[53:06] ready to pray for the success of God's
[53:08] army amen hallelujah now the easiest way
[53:12] or the simplest way we can apply that is
[53:14] just to pray for our services pray for
[53:16] our the people here yes we want to
[53:18] extend that many a Wednesday night I'll
[53:20] pray for all the pastor's I know I'll
[53:22] pray for brother Brooks on a Wednesday
[53:24] night brother Jim schumake you know for
[53:26] the cam I'll pray for all the pastor's
[53:28] brother Samuel brother Randy I'll pray
[53:30] for all the pastor's I don't know why
[53:31] but on Wednesday night I always think of
[53:32] those brothers now what is it it's it's
[53:35] me and it's you as we pray together it's
[53:37] us at our outpost and our garrison spot
[53:40] and we have a duty to stand there and
[53:44] protect God's servants amen
[53:46] God's people praise the Lord so see this
[53:50] gear represents the favor the protection
[53:56] you might even say the hedge of the Lord
[53:58] brother Ram said he needed it every hour
[53:59] of his life amen
[54:03] praise God so see this garrison is more
[54:06] when we have a garrison a prayer it's
[54:08] more than just like well I don't smoke
[54:10] anymore
[54:10] I don't cuss anymore I don't do
[54:13] pornography anymore it's more than that
[54:15] that's just that's temperance that's a
[54:16] great thing that's a wall around the
[54:18] city but we're talking about expanding
[54:20] God's blessing over our lives so it
[54:24] reaches the very outskirts the very
[54:26] extent of our lives so we achieve all
[54:30] the fruitfulness amen that we achieve
[54:33] all that God wants us to achieve amen ha
[54:37] the news like I love what the Bible said
[54:38] that David did all the will of God for
[54:40] his generation amen except the one thing
[54:43] with Bathsheba and Uriah everything else
[54:45] he fulfilled all of it see because he
[54:50] was a man after God's own heart amen
[54:53] so now with Garrison's numb there's
[54:57] there's only 19 scriptures about
[54:59] Garrison's but that's the that's the
[55:01] main idea I want to get across is that
[55:04] they symbolize Israel reaching the but
[55:09] the God ordained boundaries for their
[55:11] lives gonna say like that like I
[55:14] wrestled with us all the time but I just
[55:15] trust God's gonna give me a revelation
[55:17] is is having a small church is that the
[55:20] is that the predestinated boundary of my
[55:22] life if it is I'm happy with that I've
[55:26] been here for 13 and a half years I'm
[55:27] happy there but I just wonder in my mind
[55:30] that's something I need to seek the Lord
[55:31] on Lord is this the boundary or is there
[55:34] a zero is there more for us now there
[55:36] can be more like spiritually but I just
[55:38] mean like more like bigger because
[55:40] that's how the American mind goes right
[55:43] and so see you probably wonder the same
[55:45] you know what is the extent of my life
[55:49] like brother Graham always had that
[55:50] desire right but the Jose to go out west
[55:52] you know you know there's just more to
[55:55] my life I just feel like there's more
[55:57] there's something more than I need to do
[55:59] in my life and eventually God's gracious
[56:01] hand let him out last amen to meet the
[56:05] angels send him back to preach the seals
[56:08] and then send him back out amen
[56:10] and he met his destiny in the West - to
[56:15] receive the king so
[56:16] the true revelation of God's Word amen
[56:19] and that he was given that not so you
[56:21] could just talk about it but he could
[56:22] live by it
[56:23] Amen he said this is the sword that I
[56:26] live by oh god help us to live by this
[56:29] sword amen
[56:31] see then he reached the extent or the
[56:34] fullness of God's assignment for him can
[56:38] I say like that
[56:39] it was so striking when he was telling
[56:40] me this - then at other churches that
[56:42] she's visited their preaching on being
[56:45] in your position right there preaching
[56:48] and I've been preaching on that for like
[56:49] six months well nine months actually
[56:51] nine months I started it on New Year's
[56:54] Eve night 2018 and I watched a sermon I
[56:58] watched a sermon this week I thought
[56:59] you'd be interested of her brother from
[57:01] Uganda remember I told you about the
[57:03] revival in Uganda brother Nathan
[57:04] Erickson told me about that remember
[57:05] that he said hundreds of thousands well
[57:08] I thought I forgot about it but I saw a
[57:10] preacher at Bissell church this week and
[57:12] he preached on God's purpose for your
[57:14] life I'm like huh I have to tell Mindy
[57:17] that
[57:18] hey so seem like got it but anyways he
[57:20] said God he's got you know a strong
[57:23] accent but it's really good English he
[57:25] said he is pastor we're not past but
[57:27] he's overseer of over a hundred churches
[57:29] like God has just take the message and
[57:32] it is exploding in Uganda right now a
[57:34] church here Church and then pretty soon
[57:36] it's just exploding out there amen
[57:38] oh the harvest is plentiful amen so you
[57:42] got to pray for those laborers amen you
[57:46] know we're hearing this we're listen now
[57:47] if you picture us spiritually we're in
[57:49] this barren wasteland you know where
[57:51] we're like that one little outpost
[57:52] garrison you know in this it's all just
[57:54] spiritual wasteland but over there I
[57:57] mean the fields are white or white with
[58:00] harvest and those brothers walk in there
[58:03] and brother amen they bring him in by
[58:04] the scores you know here's twenty songs
[58:06] here and he's now as an apostle over
[58:09] over a hundred churches and they and
[58:11] they do ministers meetings he was saying
[58:13] that and they teaching the message -
[58:14] they don't have any message book they're
[58:15] all you know Pentecostals or a former
[58:18] Pentecostals or Methodists in that
[58:21] amazing like God is God is doing all
[58:23] these great things thank God that we get
[58:26] to hear about it because it's an
[58:27] encouragement so over here like my is
[58:30] there any
[58:30] when is the rapture and they're like
[58:31] there's tons of souls that need to hear
[58:34] Christ before the rapture can happen
[58:35] they're like Maggie there's many more
[58:38] all out there we're like we're like when
[58:40] is he gonna come he might wait a while
[58:43] and see but we've got to be faithful and
[58:47] do our part praise God sound about you
[58:49] but I tell my wife this you know I tell
[58:52] my wife at some point I want to retire
[58:53] from teaching and just go out and preach
[58:54] you know I'm I always tell her I'm gonna
[58:56] take you with me honey I don't know how
[58:58] much you'll want to travel that's
[59:00] sometimes the conditions aren't so nice
[59:03] but I'd love to go I said I just feel
[59:06] better hey men like there's a poll out
[59:07] there I just feel there's more hey I'm
[59:11] gonna go do more for the kingdom of God
[59:13] but don't get me wrong this is a great
[59:15] thing
[59:15] pastoring is a great thing what if you
[59:18] didn't have sheep food right you be
[59:20] starving to death but we will thank God
[59:23] that we can be fed praise God thank God
[59:25] that we can be a garrison for the
[59:27] kingdom of God but see in our own lives
[59:32] we have to make sure that we're
[59:33] constantly praying for the ministry here
[59:36] in Akron of course and then also for
[59:38] missionaries because brother Adam as a
[59:41] missionary was trusting in the prayers
[59:43] of the people I need your prayers every
[59:47] hour right because I'm going out there
[59:50] and I'm fighting against the foe praise
[59:52] God and you and I fight against foes
[59:55] daily right uh-huh
[59:59] so see the power of dedicated prayer
[1:00:02] this is mature this is the mature Israel
[1:00:04] through David they got mature they got a
[1:00:07] prophet a king a priest they've got a
[1:00:08] maybe they've got it all set up now the
[1:00:11] ministry is all set up and now he's able
[1:00:15] to set Garrison's will you you faithful
[1:00:17] soldiers now let me read the dictionary
[1:00:19] calls it like this garrison is a station
[1:00:23] a place where one stands it's a military
[1:00:27] post and it's a it's a it could also be
[1:00:33] a pillar set to mark the Philistine
[1:00:36] conquest and it can also be a place to
[1:00:39] collect taxes right it said that about
[1:00:40] David right he got gifts there
[1:00:43] so it showed that this is their outer
[1:00:45] boundaries it also means to place
[1:00:49] fortified post I like that one a
[1:00:51] fortified post you know I like that
[1:00:53] because my bestest that's your post of
[1:00:54] duty a man this is our garrison praise
[1:00:57] God and the soldiers of God gathering
[1:01:00] here to watch right
[1:01:02] it's a watching station in case there
[1:01:05] any enemies that come in amongst us so
[1:01:08] brother an amen now it makes sense
[1:01:11] brothers and sisters now it makes sense
[1:01:12] to me why Jesus says watch and pray in
[1:01:17] other words he's telling them stay at
[1:01:18] your posts of duty stay at your garrison
[1:01:21] and you watch and pray from that
[1:01:23] garrison
[1:01:24] that's your post of duty and so see when
[1:01:28] people don't come to church but the hoes
[1:01:29] they see what happens they fall out they
[1:01:31] don't have protection they're not
[1:01:33] protecting or not protecting other
[1:01:35] people and that's what the Bible says
[1:01:36] they forsake the assembling they've
[1:01:38] abandoned their posts of duty and that's
[1:01:42] why it's such an awful thing to miss
[1:01:45] Church or to fall out of church because
[1:01:47] you leave your protection and you also
[1:01:49] leave your inheritance and it hinders
[1:01:53] other people's walk with the Lord when
[1:01:55] we're not at our posts of duty that's
[1:01:57] right because we're here to build up and
[1:01:59] edify the body of Christ and if you're
[1:02:01] not here to protect the body Christ help
[1:02:03] them then they're missing out praise God
[1:02:07] so see this is a place a garrison is a
[1:02:10] place of maturity it takes time to
[1:02:14] develop that habit of praying every
[1:02:15] morning right
[1:02:16] it takes time of develop that habit of
[1:02:19] reading your Bible every day and praying
[1:02:20] every night before you go to bed it
[1:02:24] takes time to develop that and this is
[1:02:27] what David eventually constructed he was
[1:02:30] the first one to do that
[1:02:31] Joshua can you imagine he could you can
[1:02:33] stand there and you could say Moses
[1:02:34] didn't do this Joshua didn't do this God
[1:02:37] called me to do this they could have but
[1:02:40] God kept it from him but I've got I get
[1:02:43] to actually walk in the fulfillment of
[1:02:45] the promise that's exactly what we've
[1:02:46] got today amen
[1:02:47] we've got revelation we got the Bible
[1:02:49] reveal the mysteries restored to us that
[1:02:52] the other prophets the Bible said the
[1:02:54] prophets longed to see this day but you
[1:02:56] and I get to experience it
[1:02:57] walking at Amen oh they could have but
[1:03:02] God saved something for us amen
[1:03:04] these 11th hour workers aren't you glad
[1:03:06] God save something for you Oh God saved
[1:03:09] you a little bit of work before the the
[1:03:12] workers are called in praise God oh my
[1:03:15] church he gave us a fortification he
[1:03:19] gave us a place of safety and protection
[1:03:22] where we're supposed to stand and he
[1:03:25] calls it up place of prayer hallelujah
[1:03:27] now this I'm just gonna bring this back
[1:03:30] up so you remember it and I'll look at a
[1:03:32] few more things here where's that
[1:03:35] thought okay yeah there's remember in
[1:03:41] season 6 after it lists the full armor
[1:03:44] of God what is the first thing that Paul
[1:03:47] mentions afterwards prayer for everyone
[1:03:51] sofie's in 6 I believe it's 18 Lydia if
[1:03:53] you can pull it up there what does a
[1:03:57] fully armored sister with the baptism of
[1:04:00] the Holy Ghost and the full armor of God
[1:04:02] what is her duty in life what is a
[1:04:05] brother who has the full armor of God on
[1:04:08] what is one of his greatest works
[1:04:10] it's the stand at his garrison at his
[1:04:13] post of duty and pray amen and be in
[1:04:18] contact with God praying always with all
[1:04:23] prayer and supplication in the spirit
[1:04:25] and watching see there just watch him
[1:04:28] pray see it is right there watch it
[1:04:30] watch it your post of duty state your
[1:04:32] garrison right kind of reminds me of the
[1:04:35] Watson what on the night men we were
[1:04:37] talking about that kind of reminds me of
[1:04:39] that watchman one of the night of course
[1:04:41] that was in the city wall but see that's
[1:04:45] why they built Garrison's so somebody
[1:04:47] could watch further than the city so
[1:04:50] God's inheritance could be protected
[1:04:52] someone's got to be on the outer realms
[1:04:54] in church where the outer realms because
[1:04:56] we're the highways and hedges that
[1:04:58] parable Jesus tells a parable
[1:05:00] and he starts by inviting all the people
[1:05:02] around him they reject it so he says go
[1:05:04] to the streets get the MAME the heart
[1:05:07] the withered the blind bring them in and
[1:05:10] he says we still got rooms
[1:05:11] she's had a great healing ministry right
[1:05:13] then he says fine then go out to the
[1:05:15] highways and hedges because my house my
[1:05:18] marriage banquet is going to be failed
[1:05:20] amen hallelujah it's going to be filled
[1:05:24] and so he says praying always with all
[1:05:26] prayer and supplication the spirit and
[1:05:29] watching thereunto with all perseverance
[1:05:31] and supplication for All Saints cause in
[1:05:35] their in their not all all prayer all
[1:05:39] perseverance and for all saints Oh God
[1:05:43] see that's why I say then praise the
[1:05:45] Lord this is a fully armored Christian
[1:05:48] and let me remind you this speaks to me
[1:05:51] still
[1:05:52] when David fell he was supposed to be
[1:05:56] out in battle see but it was the the
[1:06:01] Bible said it was the time or the Seas
[1:06:03] in a battle of springtime but instead of
[1:06:06] going deeper into battle or inside this
[1:06:08] deeper into prayer he took a little
[1:06:11] vacation from prayer and he fell into
[1:06:13] lust and then a murdering spirit and a
[1:06:15] lying spirit right lying
[1:06:18] Daltry lust and then murder all that but
[1:06:23] see thank God he had a little link God
[1:06:26] had enough honesty that when the Prophet
[1:06:27] said you're the one he said you're right
[1:06:30] god help us to be like that praise God
[1:06:32] if we get out of step a little bit we
[1:06:34] make a mistake we fall short of us to be
[1:06:36] honest enough to admit our mistakes then
[1:06:38] we can get back to where we should be oh
[1:06:40] yes praise God so see he left off the
[1:06:44] battle prayer is the battle praise God
[1:06:48] and remember the armor of God is
[1:06:52] connected to the rapture go to first
[1:06:53] Thessalonians 5 I like this red haven
[1:06:56] hallelujah 1st Thessalonians 5 the
[1:06:58] armour of God is completely connected to
[1:07:00] the rapture God's only gonna rapture
[1:07:03] fully armored soldiers because but man
[1:07:07] said Peter went on the day of Pentecost
[1:07:08] and put on the full armor of God on the
[1:07:10] day of Pentecost 1st Thessalonians 5 now
[1:07:13] this is right after the rapture in
[1:07:14] chapter 4 verse 16 and 17 verse 1 what
[1:07:20] are the times and seasons brethren you
[1:07:21] have no need that I ride in you for
[1:07:22] yourselves know perfectly that the day
[1:07:24] the Lord so cometh as a thief in the
[1:07:26] night all right so see he said I don't
[1:07:32] need to write to you about the time of
[1:07:34] the rapture because you know Christ is
[1:07:37] gonna come as a thief in the night you
[1:07:39] know it's gonna be surprised verse 3 for
[1:07:42] when they shall say peace and safety
[1:07:43] then sudden destruction cometh upon them
[1:07:45] as travail upon a woman with child and
[1:07:48] they shall not escape so the world now
[1:07:50] even her brother Paul LaFontaine
[1:07:52] preaching on this listen to his
[1:07:53] Wednesday sermon peace and safety that's
[1:07:56] what the world wants now just give us
[1:07:59] peace just give us safety all right they
[1:08:02] want to be protected from you know ar-15
[1:08:04] rifles in which who doesn't we all want
[1:08:06] to be protected from that but see
[1:08:08] they're so concerned about safety and
[1:08:10] then peace you know with with Iran and
[1:08:13] all the Middle Eastern countries there
[1:08:15] that are filled with hatred towards
[1:08:17] Israel they want it they want peace and
[1:08:20] safety that's what they'll be saying at
[1:08:23] the time of the rapture now he says
[1:08:26] you're not children of the the night
[1:08:28] you're children of the day go down to
[1:08:30] verse 8 but let us who are of the day be
[1:08:32] sober see we got to put on the
[1:08:35] breastplate of faith and love and for a
[1:08:37] helmet the hope of salvation praise God
[1:08:41] see we got to know we're safe we got no
[1:08:43] gods jesus is coming back for me praise
[1:08:45] God if you don't come back for anybody
[1:08:48] else he's coming back for me praise God
[1:08:49] I've got that hope I'm saved I'm
[1:08:52] delivered praise God verse 9 for God has
[1:08:54] not appointed us to wrath but to obtain
[1:08:57] salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:09:00] praise God now after this there's a
[1:09:04] beautiful scriptures about keeping the
[1:09:05] Holy Spirit mine these are just so
[1:09:07] beautiful but ya know notice add a 5
[1:09:12] verse 11 edify comfort yourselves
[1:09:14] together and if I one another see we
[1:09:16] should strengthen one another here at
[1:09:17] the church right let's go down to verse
[1:09:22] 14 now we exhort you brethren warn them
[1:09:25] their unruly comfort the feeble-minded
[1:09:27] support the weak be patient toward all
[1:09:29] men if we see somebody struggling let's
[1:09:31] be the ones that encourage them not
[1:09:34] rebuke them let's be the ones that
[1:09:36] encourage them
[1:09:38] you might be in line later on might be
[1:09:41] an order later on but let's be one to
[1:09:44] encourage them himself can we pray about
[1:09:45] it right now let's try to do that let's
[1:09:48] try to pray if you see a need let's pray
[1:09:49] right now let's pray buzz and so say
[1:09:52] well I'll pray for you later
[1:09:53] pray right now pray always for all men
[1:09:56] with all supplication praise God many
[1:10:00] times I find when I say that I'll pray
[1:10:01] for you later I forget then I got to
[1:10:04] write it on my phone which I thank God
[1:10:05] for technology but it's better to pray
[1:10:07] right now invite the presence of the
[1:10:09] Lord that's right now verse 16 rejoice
[1:10:14] evermore see you're a soldier you're
[1:10:15] praying all the time but he said rejoice
[1:10:17] evermore pray without ceasing there it
[1:10:19] is right there amen so see how that
[1:10:21] connects the fusion six it's the same
[1:10:22] writer same author same Holy Spirit same
[1:10:26] writer Paul - so see we were able to
[1:10:29] pray rejoice pray without ceasing
[1:10:31] verse 18 everything give thanks this is
[1:10:33] the will of God in Christ Jesus
[1:10:35] concerning you quench not the spirit
[1:10:38] despise that prophesy see look at that
[1:10:40] he's getting in the gifts like we said
[1:10:41] this morning let the Holy Spirit flow
[1:10:43] through you praise God
[1:10:45] if God's moving and open up your mouth
[1:10:47] and let him let him speak praise God and
[1:10:50] we shall show this morning how it works
[1:10:52] through us right it's been working
[1:10:55] through dreams you know it's been
[1:10:56] working through going to pray for people
[1:10:58] like most of those times that even
[1:11:00] happen in the church I think the only
[1:11:01] one was the tongue interpretation to
[1:11:03] happen in the church all the other ones
[1:11:05] were out in the home but see that proves
[1:11:07] we're walking with the armor of God not
[1:11:09] just a church everywhere we go amen
[1:11:12] we don't take the armor off when you
[1:11:13] leave Church you keep it on praise God
[1:11:14] you keep it buckled on hallelujah
[1:11:17] despise not prophesying all right
[1:11:23] wonderful so can everybody see this
[1:11:25] thought it's a real simple thought but
[1:11:26] can everybody see it I'm I'm protected
[1:11:29] you and I are protected and cake kept
[1:11:32] safe every hour through prayer if you
[1:11:35] don't feel safe if you don't feel
[1:11:36] something in that your life is right
[1:11:38] stop and pray it'll be a garrison to you
[1:11:42] Bill Graham said I'm garrison every hour
[1:11:45] by prayer now let me find a place to
[1:11:49] close I got I had all these other notes
[1:11:50] here
[1:11:52] and I've been reading this book it's a
[1:11:54] real good book shaping history through
[1:11:56] prayer and fasting I love this title and
[1:11:59] it's true I think about Daniel like
[1:12:01] Israel's history was shaped by prayer
[1:12:04] and fasting and it's just a beautiful
[1:12:07] book here I just started I kind of
[1:12:08] jumped ahead to chapter six so but I'll
[1:12:11] get back to chapter one I want to go
[1:12:13] right to the fasting and prayer it's a I
[1:12:16] can't wait to read it this man actually
[1:12:20] this man and the preachers their
[1:12:23] evangelical - I'm sorry they're
[1:12:24] charismatic and an evangelical they went
[1:12:26] and prayed for Ronald Reagan before he
[1:12:28] got shot Lincoln and so he was showing
[1:12:32] how the prayer and fasting of the just
[1:12:35] in their little way protected and saved
[1:12:37] his life that's powerful that's powerful
[1:12:41] I thought my oh we need to do that we
[1:12:45] need to pray for people like I told you
[1:12:48] a few weeks ago but I don't bang if I
[1:12:50] told you that I was praying and fasting
[1:12:52] for the abortions to stop well at least
[1:12:54] I got a little bit that one week in the
[1:12:56] same week Ohio defunded Planned
[1:12:58] Parenthood and then on the national
[1:13:03] level the federal government cut or I'm
[1:13:05] sorry
[1:13:06] Planned Parenthood rejected the
[1:13:08] government's 65 million dollars all in
[1:13:12] the same week out or the week after I
[1:13:13] prayed and fasted for that and we've
[1:13:16] done that off and on but to me that I
[1:13:17] mean they're so gonna do it but I just
[1:13:19] thought wow it's a step in the right
[1:13:20] direction we know the world we know
[1:13:24] America is gonna be lost we know all
[1:13:25] these things that'll never come back but
[1:13:27] if lives can be saved praise God then
[1:13:29] let's be about that praise God because
[1:13:31] the Bible said pray for those who rule
[1:13:34] pray for those in rule that are an
[1:13:36] authority over you pray for them that
[1:13:37] you might live a life and all godliness
[1:13:39] and peace praise God
[1:13:41] well that was such an encouragement to
[1:13:43] me and sister winning out we should tell
[1:13:44] your testimony sometime can I share a
[1:13:48] little bit okay sister Wendy was praying
[1:13:50] and fasting for the people in Hong Kong
[1:13:51] and right after praying and fasting they
[1:13:54] got some good victories then they
[1:13:56] did they shelf the law okay they were
[1:13:59] gonna add this law that they were gonna
[1:14:00] be able to take Hong Kong citizens to
[1:14:02] China right but they you know that you
[1:14:05] saw the protests my
[1:14:06] it might still be going on but they
[1:14:09] shelf that law and they were gonna send
[1:14:11] tanks China was gonna send tanks in but
[1:14:14] they decided not to do that and I
[1:14:18] appreciate that I don't think it's
[1:14:19] coincidental that those things didn't
[1:14:22] happen I think it's the hand of Almighty
[1:14:23] God because this in God just wants one
[1:14:27] person you did for his will God he just
[1:14:30] wants to remember the RAM said he just
[1:14:32] wants to get one man or woman in his own
[1:14:33] hand hey hallelujah amen the power
[1:14:37] praying faster than we forget this so
[1:14:39] I'm thankful the Holy Spirit's bringing
[1:14:41] it back to our remembrance garrison
[1:14:44] where garrisoned were protected by
[1:14:46] prayer and fasting and we'll also go out
[1:14:48] and possess more land through prayer and
[1:14:50] fasting now let me close with this
[1:14:53] thought this chapter six I just started
[1:14:55] to highlight and reading it it's it's
[1:14:56] it's called this fasting intensifies
[1:15:00] prayer so if your prayer life seems a
[1:15:02] little off you know we all go through it
[1:15:05] probably weekly monthly if it seems off
[1:15:08] then the way to get back to it is
[1:15:10] through fasting and of course fasting
[1:15:14] was a regular practice of the early
[1:15:16] church my there's so many good examples
[1:15:17] in here let me just find the one they go
[1:15:24] through Jesus's example and I think it'd
[1:15:26] be worth it to do that oh yeah let's
[1:15:30] yeah let me just close with this stuff
[1:15:31] let's go to Luke chapter 4 I think this
[1:15:32] is a good thought Luke 4 verse 1 Thank
[1:15:40] You Lydia
[1:15:48] so in the scripture Jesus being full of
[1:15:51] the Holy Ghost returned from Jordan and
[1:15:53] was led by the spirit into the
[1:15:54] wilderness and we know he fasted 40 days
[1:15:58] right so notice right after being born
[1:16:02] again where God sent him to a wilderness
[1:16:05] to learn how to fast and pray so
[1:16:09] obviously Jesus remember Jesus that I do
[1:16:12] nothing except the father shows me first
[1:16:16] so if he was gonna achieve all of God's
[1:16:21] ministry for him God was showing him
[1:16:23] you've got to begin you the way to enter
[1:16:26] into this ministry is through prayer and
[1:16:28] fasting I think you and I understand
[1:16:31] that you and I are not going to enter in
[1:16:32] a ministry unless we're praying and
[1:16:33] fasting as far as like finding our
[1:16:36] position in life if Christ had to do
[1:16:40] that I mean and he was a perfect man
[1:16:42] with he's tempted but he never gave in
[1:16:45] if he had experience if he had to learn
[1:16:48] to die to self through starving the
[1:16:50] flesh I think we need to learn that too
[1:16:52] because Paul does it the Apostles do it
[1:16:55] we don't have time maybe let next week
[1:16:56] Lord willing how many one enter in there
[1:16:59] they're there their ministry praise God
[1:17:02] I feel like and I you do you do too you
[1:17:06] probably have entered into it but you
[1:17:07] want to see a greater benefit of greater
[1:17:11] fruitfulness to it I do I know I do
[1:17:15] I believe I've entered in my ministry
[1:17:16] but like I said I still feel there's
[1:17:18] even there's more things for me to do
[1:17:20] for the glory of God but remember this
[1:17:23] is a great thing I'm not I'm not being
[1:17:24] any discontent brother I love this you
[1:17:26] know there's just you know you want to
[1:17:27] make sure you do I caused you to do and
[1:17:30] who would ever thought like you'd ask my
[1:17:31] wife I never thought I'd be a pastor you
[1:17:33] can ask her she knew me before I was a
[1:17:34] Christian I never thought I'd be a
[1:17:35] preacher preaching three sometimes five
[1:17:37] times a week but it's all to glorify
[1:17:40] Jesus Christ and we just want to do
[1:17:41] God's will now at the end of the chapter
[1:17:43] let's go to Luke not into the chapter
[1:17:44] but Luke 4:14 after this prayer and
[1:17:47] fasting Luke for 14 and Jesus returned
[1:17:51] in the power of the Spirit so he goes in
[1:17:55] the wilderness full hour of it in other
[1:17:58] words he knows how to yield to it
[1:18:00] amen
[1:18:01] and then what does he do he does the
[1:18:03] Merrick okay 'no can you imagine so just
[1:18:07] speak just pour that i'll just speak it
[1:18:09] it'll turn water into wine see he had
[1:18:11] preparation now he's in the power of the
[1:18:13] spirit he fasted he prayed he's been
[1:18:17] with god amen in other words God's hand
[1:18:19] upon him like we saw this morning amen
[1:18:21] God's hand was upon him and now I could
[1:18:24] do these things what a beautiful example
[1:18:28] and I remember Jesus puts that same
[1:18:30] thing on you and I see fasting was the
[1:18:34] final phase of preparation for Christ
[1:18:36] before he entered into his public
[1:18:38] ministry and we all want to see God do
[1:18:43] public things in our lives right we want
[1:18:44] to see soul saved we want to see people
[1:18:46] on the job being saved
[1:18:48] we won't you want to see your co-workers
[1:18:49] say don't you you want to see your
[1:18:51] family safe we'll see maybe it requires
[1:18:53] a little more consecration a little more
[1:18:57] consecration I feel that way too I mean
[1:19:01] I've always felt all these years that I
[1:19:03] there's somebody in Copley I need to win
[1:19:05] to the Lord and bring him in the message
[1:19:06] we've had a few visit but brother bang I
[1:19:08] feel like there's I honestly feel God
[1:19:10] didn't send me over there just to teach
[1:19:12] them ABCs I like ABCs I had enough of
[1:19:15] them sometimes I feel like it but I like
[1:19:19] to go to algebra sometimes at least
[1:19:21] algebra but I just feel like there's got
[1:19:27] to be a predestinate seat out there
[1:19:28] don't you feel like that I feel like the
[1:19:30] reason I'm out there is not just to
[1:19:31] teach ABCs I want to teach spiritual
[1:19:34] algebra out there you know there's got
[1:19:35] to be a soul I pray for I prayed him
[1:19:37] fasted I've wrote it down I've I've wept
[1:19:40] God's give us Souls out of coplete for
[1:19:42] the message of the hour so I'm just
[1:19:44] hanging on until God takes me out of
[1:19:46] there I just feel there's got to be more
[1:19:47] to me being up there
[1:19:49] it wouldn't be awesome to see that
[1:19:51] happen in six months or year would that
[1:19:53] be awesome to see somebody you becoming
[1:19:55] the message through copy
[1:19:55] I'm not prophesied I'm just saying I
[1:19:57] just want to see the further ment of my
[1:20:00] work praise God
[1:20:03] now Jesus exceeds the works that I do
[1:20:06] shall he do also
[1:20:10] so Jesus
[1:20:11] said that we can do the same thing as
[1:20:13] him right now Lydia pull-up John 13 16
[1:20:17] and let's stand I've got to get you
[1:20:18] standing there else I'll just pre keep
[1:20:19] reaching I stand all this is good this
[1:20:26] is rich praise God
[1:20:27] how they taste and see that the Lord is
[1:20:30] gracious isn't God gracious John 13 6
[1:20:39] verily verily I say unto you the servant
[1:20:41] is not greater than his Lord neither he
[1:20:45] that has sent greater than he that sent
[1:20:48] him now apply this now to Jesus's
[1:20:51] ministry and our ministry who's greater
[1:20:54] Jesus or the bride I hope you say Jesus
[1:20:57] if not you've got a idolatry spirit on
[1:21:01] you a selfish I - your spirit worshiping
[1:21:04] yourself Jesus Christ is greater than
[1:21:08] all of us and if he had to fast and pray
[1:21:11] and devote time to that to enter into
[1:21:13] his ministry we're not greater than him
[1:21:15] well I don't need to fast and pray no
[1:21:17] the reality is we need to fast and pray
[1:21:18] - it needs to become a greater part of
[1:21:21] our lives if we want to possess the land
[1:21:25] and if we want to set up Garrison's in
[1:21:27] our lives praise God hallelujah I
[1:21:31] believe God's done that sister Karen I
[1:21:33] believe that you know with you with your
[1:21:35] family moving in and praying and all the
[1:21:37] ones brother Jose God look at the
[1:21:39] protection God has placed around us the
[1:21:44] spirits we have had come in here they
[1:21:46] don't stay very long when Iced not to
[1:21:49] Pat us on the back ground that's to say
[1:21:50] thank God for His grace and you know
[1:21:57] sometimes people can hang her
[1:21:58] I mean people brother BAM said the some
[1:22:00] Satan will anoint someone with the wrong
[1:22:02] spirit and he'll torment the people in
[1:22:04] the church he or she I'm thankful that
[1:22:07] those that the wrong spirits that have
[1:22:10] come in here God has effectively and
[1:22:12] graciously moved them out and protected
[1:22:14] our lives so that we can continue
[1:22:17] serving the Lord right in the sweetness
[1:22:20] of the fellowship and grow in grace and
[1:22:23] knowledge of the Lord the
[1:22:25] thankful for that we are seeing
[1:22:27] protection we are protected by the
[1:22:29] prayers of the saints amen I believe
[1:22:32] that so that was John 13-6 the servant
[1:22:36] is not greater the Lord I want to read
[1:22:37] right out of here
[1:22:38] if fasting was a necessary part of
[1:22:40] Jesus's own preparation it must play a
[1:22:43] part in the disciples preparation
[1:22:46] because we're not more spiritual than
[1:22:48] Jesus and don't even try to think you
[1:22:50] are I don't think anybody does here but
[1:22:52] we can't ever think we're you know cuz
[1:22:55] we hear it all the time the brides the
[1:22:56] word she's the work she's the bride
[1:22:57] she's the word she's the word
[1:22:58] well yeah but you got to submit to the
[1:23:00] word your that's in your soul but your
[1:23:02] you got to get your mind and body to
[1:23:04] obey that word it doesn't do any good
[1:23:07] just say I'm the word on the word on the
[1:23:08] word you've got to live the word I've
[1:23:10] got to live the word we've got to become
[1:23:12] that word see we hear so much so
[1:23:15] sometimes we forget we've actually got
[1:23:16] to live that we've got to manifest that
[1:23:19] and become that musicians if you'll come
[1:23:21] here let's make the transition here are
