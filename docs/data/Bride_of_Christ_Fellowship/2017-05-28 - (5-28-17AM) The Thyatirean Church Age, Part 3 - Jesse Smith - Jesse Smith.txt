or grateful Lord God our hearts and minds your Lord as we walk after that Commandments we love you Lord that's this time the subpoena thy word let's just preaching now and our worship in Jesus Christ a man able to say your vows this morning by God's grace sold up to Revelation chapter 2 let's look at the liar tear in church age part 3 this morning even looking at that I've been tying in different thoughts you know those as movie streaming and what presence you know from tiny different thoughts in Wednesday then listen that watch it what other night bring you the chance of this with that by God's grace I think of your vessels art last Sunday night was Daniel chapter age of your inner prophetic things which divide off to be the Holy Spirit or tells us things group to look forward to go to that one needs and Persia and also the four beasts and so for like that I know you be blessed tonight we're looking at Daniel chapter 9 Daniel 70 weeks so revisit that tonight by the grace of the Lord how many think we're the Word of God a man raised a little very thankful I experienced Revelation chapter 2 this morning I've also read another portion of text I just want to read a couple scriptures you're going to tie it in with judgment must begin at house of God men of the tight end with that because that's where the Prophet takes it is the fires here in church age let's look to starts at verse 18 where you noted that especially the song specials in it let's just reverse 19 and 22 verses there Halloween I know that works and charity and service and faith and thy patience and thy work and the last be more than the first last time you preached on this we closed without a Christian increases their service to God when times get hard they don't decrease it they increase above that's what Jesus recognized we will be scared perchik we're just money notwithstanding evidence against thee because thou sufferest that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetess she said she'll give to teach and to seduce my servants to commit fornication and to eat things sacrificed that's right if you went to first Peter chapter verse 16 pray our expectation for today so we're going to see what the Holy Spirit is first beer for see if any man suffer as a Christian let him not be ashamed but let him glory glorify God on this behalf when you suffer doing the right thing verse 17 for the time has come that a judgment must begin at the house of God first begin at us what should be the end of them that obey not the gospel you know I never study what brother Ram said about that scripture till this morning I'm going to bring that thought I thought I was gonna preach Daniel 70 weeks this morning but the Holy Spirit James my thought for this movie so entrusting to be the will of God I was 18 and if the righteous air city say never I'm going to preach on that last year who is righteous locked no other they were too scarcely say I'm right if the righteous scarcity saves so they're talking about the Buddhist version where Sheila ungodly and the sinner of fear ungodly or those who sell out to make believers center would be someone never did believe like fair Wow verse 19 what air war let them that suffer according to the will of God commit the keeping of their souls to him in well-doing as into a personal trainer so there you see the context of this you're in the midst of being a Christian and you're suffering for doing right and when you suffer for doing right so remember judgment begins with the house of God and take courage because the Bible says you committed our souls in the Christ let's have one more end every not your mother's make another $2 we pray don't your habits you see how hearts that might not be doing anyone arms right here this world I teach and every believer Lord into more truth that's one evidences someone's born again guided into a deeper truth or they're able to be taught the Word of God by the Holy Spirit through the fivefold ministry which is the Holy Ghost Channel and dress wear for this hour thank you Lord for the promises in your word help us be faithful as I've said Lord I'm expecting you going to pray for this moment father guide me by the Holy Spirit got a hitch every heart of the soul Lord may we feel your presence in Jesus Christ I'm sure set got this it's good to be with you again by God's grace [Music] oh my hopes to make sure I've got all the announcements I forgot I think you should having us with home thank you okay I just I want to forget anything what we're looking at the thigh here in church age again God's grace this is part three I want to like to show the quotes again if you can whenever you're ready sir my two little quotations here this morning and I said I just didn't plan to preach this actually plan to preach this this evening but I just felt such a burden of the Holy Spirit as a preacher anyone with the gift knows when you have such a burden get away from it that's the leadership of the Holy Spirit and so just try to follow that by the grace of the Lord I happened when I was there when I'm and last time I had such a burden two freaks that a message Oh sister when you're there and I got a complexity we're just saying don't you preach on that flower but said the Holy Spirit get-together complete thought together thank the Lord for that you know people mostly for that all need for that and of and the person said now that the truth is going out how to say you cannot defeat a truth like that either I like that God's truth must be preached amen holiday distiller thankful let's go part three we said great a little bit architects I changed the texted it read all have we did that the first time and I'm going to go I'm taking this taught as from the Branham did in the church age book to charge will begin to the house of God that's where it will end up this morning so we're going to start off with just a fling quotes from the church all know as I said I listen read through both the church age both piratey run and listen to the whole sermon back to your church age nineteen sixty and I'm trying to blend life feel the most important things for our assembly is brother BAM said you can't preach all of it he said if you get a fifty sermons on a blunt shortage and so all you have to do is hit the highlights and that's God with us late so I'm doing the same thing I'm trying to hit the highlights I'm preaching like five or seven sermons on each Church age by God's very so thank the Lord for that and let's look at this here enough fire to the church range was six oh six to fifteen to twenty the messenger was Columba now one thing that's interesting about this age brother Graham was the Holy Spirit to choose Kalama he actually died ten years before the age started remember he said the Holy Spirit showed him before his messenger it was and so forth as we study history what's the part one his ministry was so powerful Columbia he was such a visionary so many signs wonders and miracles he would get twelve men the Holy Ghost twelve men and women and he would move into a land nearby other places and start a city and they would pray and seek God and so people would come to the city and feel the presence of got to get saved that was his way to missionary are to evangelize Scotland the whole nation of Scotland what a man of God amen so what I'm saying is that even though he died there ten years before his imprint upon the age was undeniable even arty turned an entire nation Scotland to Christianity kind of like st. Patrick did with Ireland I mean they led by God's grace Marty what a man of God is is thankful what a testimony that it is man so that's Columba and so we're looking at this whole church age Jesus is speaking to this whole church age remember as it got darker brother have said this was the darkest age it wasn't the most deceptive age that's our day well that makes a difference between dark and deception right but mansard is more dark because of the persecution the physical death upon the people and the corruption in the church was at an all-time high now we are in the most deceptive age remember preach God is evil age and said people think they're worse than Jesus Christ and they're actually worshipping Satan because they're worshipping bichri's in vain do they worship Him teaching for doctrines the commandments of men that's right but we all need to be on our toes it's right now that's right that's exactly right you must get our toes right now is this the age of deception not so much dark persecution because that was the dark ages death so I had a black horse rider death now the Prophet says now he's already said this agents called the darkest days because it was indeed the darkest period of all history was the age of Pope Innocent a third who claimed that he was the Vicar of Christ supreme sovereign over the church in the world who instituted that Inquisition which under his direction shed more blood than at any other time except the Reformation it was the age of or not her seat the rule of harlots that's somehow surgery is the third had a mistress and a fill the papal choir and paramours and bastard sons and returned the apple palace into demócratas anastasius the third was smothered by death or to death by mono Co who is the mistress to Sark sarah dias sorry jumped up singing Jonathan eleven was Mara zoa's illegitimate son Jonathan 12 was the grandson of Arizona and he violated widows emergen was killed while the act of adultery by the woman's enrage husband this is the condition the church was in now not the true church the false Church the true church will never be a neck addition Clemenza the Holy Ghost Wakeeney from adultery that's why is there to come for me amen exactly right look at this false church it was the age of papal schism part two lines opposed one ruling from having epic nun and the other Rome cursed and bought each other these Pope's were not only guilty of immoral sex acts father sort of illegitimate children committing sodomy etc but were guilty of selling priestly offices to the highest bidders it was the age when the light glowed ever so faintly yet the few believers labored more fervently and that's what Jesus said you got works you've got faith you've got love and you got works and the last are more than the first holiday and Jesus recognized even though it's the darkest hour you're so me with more service now that he did the beginning right he said on this a darkness increased up toward the end eh penny arose attempting reforms their Labor's were so further that they paved the way for our company Reformation therefore as the word says the sign that HR last end of the age works are more than new curse amen what a powerful testimony in the darkest H Christ got the most about a service see that's the anointing of the Holy special anointing will do the anointing will rise above when the enemy comes in like a flood it raises the standard against that anointing it's exactly right because it's a more powerful anointing the word guy or tear has various meanings one is continual sacrifice now it's interesting though Graham says it means continual sacrifice and then another time he says a dominating female which we get to that I'll kind of state that portion for later when you preach as well yeah so it must have various mean by many this is believed to be a prophecy concerning the use of the mass which is a continual presentation the sacrifice of Christ that is an excellent thought but it also might mean the continual sacrifice in lives and labors of the true believers of the Lord look at this next time surely these daughters your Saints were the cream of the crop right full of the Holy Ghost and faith created other good works showing board this praise holding not their lives here unto themselves but gladly giving their all as a sweet sacrifice unto the Lord you want to be cream of the crop of the latest in church age give yourself as a full sacrifice of attraction don't hold anything back give all you have to Jesus he's going to have a crop Weiner tears for Henry it's going to have a crowd and we want to be the wheat that it brings forth a hundredfold a net Lord now we get to the review here here's the review which I want to as I said brother man brings his thought of Jesus trying the reins of the heart and then brings it to judgment we can get into the house of God so I want to revisit that the last few four or five sermons I've been dealing a lot with the home church because we've all here laughing last year and be honest I'm pretty hurt sometimes you know I've gone through that and like my bear said about brother devil the pastor don't always tell you what's going on behind scenes right and so I just had to felt that like I got to deal with that I got a preset I've got to get that off my heart that's the same thing brother Brandon my brother branham was going to quit preaching in 1961 he shared with the people and that afterwards one of the men repented the men were saying oh we believed your Jesus Christ remember that in 1961 and buh-bam said those men are sitting right in the congregation today he said they said I they believed every word I said but and didn't believe every word I said so see he had done things that were on his heart can't really get to remember when we preach on a critical spirit brother Branham tells the congregation before he preaches he said I've got a critical spirit I haven't got rid of it but pray for me now get rid of it as I preach so preacher many times cannot be separated from the trials and sufferings of that he's going through he's just got a brief child word anyway and you know that too sometimes with the midst of a trial you can't really separate yourself in the trial then you can from the reg your life but what do you do you press clear up your best foot forward on the word of God and you serve God the best you can occupy so the rebuke is in verse 22 read that fro text program said one church was tolerating Jezebel one church would allow it will just allow this woman to it I don't rule over the church and another church was not even the false church was allowing I wanted to rule over them the true church was not allowed in a woman to rule over them the program takes his side here's what he says now with this first I want you to drop down to the 23rd and see the proof of a picture I've been bringing your attention on Bob that will kill her children with death and all the churches that was the thought right here churches shall know that I he would serve the reigns of the hearts so remember says I just been saying right along that there are actually two churches though the spirit speaks to both of them at each age as though they were but one here it is plainly stated that there are the churches and it states just as plainly that some of those churches evidently do not know that he is the one who searches the reigns and the hearts he's going to prove that this so so let's get the picture around six oh six or you can fast-forward to nine something AD 980 the false church was not convinced that God hears the secrets of their heart they thought they could go to church and like those Pope's and things do awful things and get away with sin everyone said their own work showed they didn't believe that God searched their hearts all the time never read that because if there's a leave that they would have been pissed away you see how important is for you to know when the Holy Spirit is searching your heart anything under that and that's why every service is so important that's what shows the diagram gives a quote he talks about a family said God will heal the baby he said but then he said they'll get a little more money he said pretty soon he said pretty soon so get a better car a better home and then all he says he'll they won't go to church anymore he said him pretty soon he said the get away from the Spirit of God and he said we must constantly say where the Spirit of God is being poured out day and night data and and he gotta give you saya as the example he got lifted up for out look I've got a little more money and in America of all places Church you and I I myself we've all got to be careful not to let the riches and cares of this world distract us from serving Christ you must stay where the Spirit of God is being poured out again if our Maps you'll get like use I'd Sara I don't care what the light says God blessed me look how much I've done in my life I can do whatever I want and go outside the word but every any believer any true believer knows that God searches our artena he knows what's in our hearts and we must not hide anything we must offer it to hitting them and because that's how I wrong so he greens Astana there's two churches what actually believes God serves their heart the other one actually thinks they can hide something from God how many know you can't hide anything little and I mean oh you make a mistake it's going to show up you're going to pay for I don't know to make a mistake father's going to spank you all right exactly right okay I said now then what churches will be those that do not know this truth what is true that that God is loser to the great part of course it's the fall fine because the true believers certainly know that judgment begins at the house of God and they've been god-fearing judge themselves that they be not judged remember the words of our Lord Jesus said judge yourselves that should be not judged praised or so I wanted to give this thought and this morning I was coming to cross this I was going to preachers to the human service and I thought my I've never studied what mother have said about judgment begins at the house of God so I went to did it and thankfully is a real short search it was one of those thousand and five hundred is actually like 26 I believe I'm not mistaken well or I can't that nothin wake it up in the morning I can do that so this is a good judgment muster so how is your Bible because the true Church of God is here and knew that God is going to start judging everybody right here for Akron Ohio in 2017 gums up or how many years we have in Akron Ohio when God judges the Laodicean Church age I'll say by this as you fast forward the white throne judgment when God always put the latest in church eggs for our generation we're going to stand there and God is going to begin by judging at the house of God in other words judgment will go forth from Most Holy Ghost built saints that are seasoning on the throne with Jesus himself judgment will begin at the house of God amen those who lives true in every hour will stand there as witnesses that the Word of God could be live that the Word of God was true amen and then it will never fail other than God and Jesus said I'll even raise up people from past generation if I can't find somebody to accuse them in this generation maybe with you know award a second life in their generation jesus said I'll race up the queen of sheet Lena and she'll come and she'll give a judgment against these Pharisees because a greater than Solomon is here amen let me say with all due respect me over the red but a greater than brother Brandon is here it is the Holy Ghost amen all due respect we never say that any like it at all we have to recognize that although probably leaves the scene God is still here in fact brother and use that and if God's with us where he's the miracles at the end of 1961 perhaps it did you notice Gideon after the mini Knights came in remember that story for the random set of provocated idioms and he left the scene about manager said see how God does it after the Prophet leaves all this left is the angel the Lord and that's how God wanted an Indian's day God's going to be angel the Lord the Holy Spirit ministering the Prophet left the scene a telephonic brush that's gone here to the Holy Spirit a Safian Church like I've had friends and and know you years ago I used to carpool to work and with three other women you know that they are all there the damage done within a few years and so we just start fold you know we were short on money and you know I just carpool and I see nothing wrong with that as far as to know that but let's not be as some of them you know shirt certainly appreciate those people but as we were talking to the car they would say you know in our church all they preach on there's a table in the Sun never free time the Holy Ghost I was like yes but at that time I just started preaching those two thousand four so I'm preaching in 2004 January 2004 and that was you know later on that far I believe I'm not mistaken at the end of 2004 I just got ordained to preach you know in August of 2010 against my brother Brooks you know and uh and I was so came up and I said that's where our church is all about the Holy Spirit you know I was trying to be aligning you know that we need more of the Holy Spirit but George if the Holy Spirit is going to bring the bride to a wrap up side up you know a physical body of Christ or brother branham physically being here we better have a good relationship with the Holy Ghost we better start getting more in tune what is the Holy Spirit trying to show me what is his voice saying today let us have ears to hear what the spirit can say to this church amen a good thing we better be we better know the leadership of the Holy Spirit brings God because that's what we're going to have to have hallelujah from the spirit and the bride say come on now I'm just going to go through the quotes like I said there was something didn't apply to it when a man is what's going it again I'm not emotion worked up not some enthusiasm not by putting his name on a church but not by joining the biggest church in the city but when he's actually cried through you've heard about breakthrough but the band also uses crying through then oh yeah seek as you died when the man's actually cried through his beg with tears in his eyes until God has forgiven his sins cleanse his soul from a life of sin and filled with the Holy Spirit with such love and godly till he takes the old tool tires back he stole from the neighbors it goes and makes up to these things and live godly before men will never have a revival til we have that what is that you see what he got saved under justification he went and paid back all the people he stole from and this is the burden you know of the church people get baptized but the problem is they never repented before they got baptized praise God they wonder why there's no power in their lives or no Holy Spirit leadership or don't deserve it or no correction or no gifts or no power anything like that well my question is have they done works meet for repentance have they really repented like brother Graham said if they cry through a bit big as a blue hoot and they prayed through have they done these things Church we must pay the same price as all the other ones painting there's not two ace against all he goes there's one way to get to all the ghosts and that's died be born again dynamique wicked they met so see what he's saying I get to the house of God judgment begin to the house of God by the word of God amen not a textbook with the Bible not about some Church teaches in their theology but what God says then you'll have a revival where great hours and wonders and signs and miracles and everything else will take place I wouldn't do that like I was really sorry you so I just like to preach the way and I just feel like to preach that's the way I see it and then this time speaking especially on this real tough or cutting part of the gospel not just up on that a minute God's will mean flow this way gospel means good news so go down so there's a hard rough cutting part two good news I believe that yeah it doesn't feel good like like a good wine right taste in the mouth which is bitter the some of the book tastes good the mouth but it's better in the belly so there's parts of the good news that are hard for what your flesh and sinful nature exactly writing this will program said but you know this is a house of judgment because judgment begins that we're all sewed up here's where judgment begins and what is judgey tells us the evil sphere or God sphere that's judging judging is another word for discernment I'm understand net judgment or discernment against now cigar so the house of God should have the Holy Ghost flowing through it so we've usually this is a second but this is a god other Turks if we went there to course and you would have a trial they got a book of all their they have to read this to find out what you're judged for and that's the way it is in the house of God we've got to take it from the Word of God coming up on that Smith rock and they need of anything they might derive after that the blessing and things they still member I'm going to bring us on now brother random surprisingly ibuffer Timmy's pricey Denis he brings up Kadesh Barnea about ten times with judgment begins at the house of God and brother brand lightens kadish Barnea to every home Church the church said Amen other day I never do that so I thought I was so burden strike the mic I've never heard this breach man listen to it but I missed it he said they come to the place called Katie's party I'm sorry they got a blessing thing but they still murmured or complain they come to the place called Kadesh Barnea i'm this for a minute hey this Bernie was a judgment seeing the world of that day that's fine that's mounted 13 checker now numbers hey go to the market the scriptures if you wish now in there was a judgment seat riga previous chapters in your study we just have to hit the high places milan three or four days your bible can't study at first by burst but here's what he said but it wasn't judgment seat there was a great well there at many little wells out from it that tributary are springs from this great huge spring hey - Park Nina if you look it up click ok - sure rivers your mind it's in Ezekiel hey dish was Noah grabbing a huge well and river system did the Word of God but answer that's a perfect type of the church Lord the church is the jug you see judgment begins at the house of God okay I never do this often today hey this bar here was ones the judgments of the world there's many great spring and the many little Springs late lead off from it which is a perfect type again Christ the big spring the church the little spring up from Christ the judgment seat judgment begins to the house of God here's where we are judged how many Bobbie like that there's one great as well in canis and that's night Christ but there are many other Wells and rivers that kind of flowed out from that screen all the little rivers and medals type this little church right here no church in Sheffield Oh church in Lorraine churches to the Lima and all their own little well scrubbing out and we must be the very end of that last River there because we're so smart we're in the venerian and that's okay I like to work anywhere our Jesus calls me and I didn't have to come back I didn't ask for the message God gave it to me no I totally accurate I just must be faithful my toasted indeed I didn't ask to get rich I never thought I'd be a preacher Amen God help me to this place here's where we are judged isn't it a pity when we see what we're wrong and doing the wrong thing living the wrong life associating wrong everything and we're just not big enough to walk up and say God I'm sorry I know one's wrong you're right not wrong you forgive me help me to do better the next time too sorry for Christians he's talking about the church it's Kadesh Barnea everybody see that and we're not big enough to walk of the same God he said if we just that that real about ourselves but we don't hear the gospel freaks and say oh well I don't believe it that way as a preacher that's hard I preached over the last few years of labor in the people's life I'm invested borne people's lives last years I never had it into the life told in the exact truth told them exactly what the Word of God is and so I can go somewhere else ready to go to church I can do whatever I want that's not what a real Christian does a real Christian recognizes the house of God is the courtroom we met it is the courtroom of God you go there to hear that your sins are forgiven not just was but you must keep walking in the line as he's in the line a better Church if you're honest sometimes you come to church condemned don't you buy diffic or I did that first wrong in that deal yesterday I did that wrong and you don't you don't mean to be but you come to church condemned that's a day where you've got to look at the judge that just says you're forgiven you confess it all the guilt has passed away from you a many that's why you need because something like you come you feel like you're the guilty one but Jesus say my blood can reach to the highest mountain and the lowest I'll be a penny it can reach down to the lowest estate if you feel guilty or if you are guilty the photo price is there to set you free amen the only must confess and say Lord hoping to be hung enough to admit I was wrong again but you don't find that much you find a lot of pride like Israel had a case money oh we can go get the land of us mm you know after we go - Michaela come back they denied it we can go up there they're all prideful help us to be humble necessary man after we have knowledge of the truth Lord what we ought to do and then we won't do it we can't go no farther with God until we do it see God just presents something to us that we should stop this type of life we should quit letting for the world and professionally Christian these people already professional be Christians and will continue right on the same thing then we can't go no farther with God I'm gonna go farther with God amen ever felt like you hit a wall in god well there must be something laying there there must be a must be okay - right they got the K - and they couldn't go any further until they address the issue let me understand that by God's grace they had to dress this issue can we possess it or not - we believe guy was able to take us to the lantern up we they had to trust that issue they weren't going any further and got it back they went backwards and around and around and around and never went forward into another generation rose up Church let's not put this off to another generation let's serve God with everything we have right now if you don't you'll regret that's the program said it you don't get also Christ out you'll regret it over there he said you've got one life to live let's split it off for Christ write it down yeah exactly right right he said the place that's been done revealed to us so we got to stop right there until we make that thing right and then go on with God for that is when we're back in the gray see I told the story my dad he's the 1983 these top we would almost got he was going on with God moving on with God but 1983 tells you the story all the time almost every time I'm there he's telling this story so I know it's true he stopped praying the clause he stopped reading his Bible he said since then he's had nothing but trials for the last thirty years he imagined him he's 67 he's 67 out of 30 years of his life taken away by the enemy because he will obey the Word of God and get right with the Word of God I look at that so I don't want to be like that I love him I'm trusting that I can pray them through like my dad said you pray for people and then you get Tel Aviv I'm Esther you can tell this he said I'm praying for you and you're going to go over all my prayers to God in order not to make it I'm an idiot all my friends are gone for God go from one pass all those predators in order not to make it so church we should believe that God will hear our prayer other nica's are from a pure sincere heart holiday we have tonight exactly right just wait on God remember patience let patience have a perfect work again and then you'll be perfect if you can just have patience saying that we'll see when we finally get to the spot where we can address whatever stopping us from moving on that's why we're back in Gracie get you man good that's why people feel like there's no more grace than that because they failed God it wasn't God it was them but once you address something went to address the kadish party of your life then you can move on in grace because the judgment of God boy judgment begins to the house of God the judgments of God are keeping you from moving on until you deal with it until you recognize it god help us to get back in grace again and move on with Christ amen yeah oh yeah right then we're back in Gracie see you got to have you got to have grace brothers hard being graced you got to have grace to forgive yourself you got a grace to forgive others or you are not walking in grace that's why people are condemned that if I'm the message because they let sins faster right now hold this against that hold that against that I have a secret thing in here like reset on the phones and and never games like that or this and we just family gets back this church against that church across the street that split up how is that possible it's because their only thing and the judgments of God remain upon them until they make it right then they're back in grace again I never said they were lost but in the current state where they are they're living in the judgments of God that's why they're convicted all the time that's why they make you like all the time but if you deal with it and confess it then you're walking in grace and lot of Jesus Christ again never understand that hey hey man I never do that to this money but heaven blueberry on the video then they're walking to Gracie in the beautiful type of KS cornea not glory they'll make a preacher happy to find something like that amen what a beautiful picture the church out on the desert everything had to come to K - to get water everything had to come to K - you get water therefore the one big strength but the other Springs that is a type of heaven that's a type of the judgment seat of God where that the judgment begins at the house of God and where this one great springfed and the other little springs run out from it means that heaven being the judgment seat of Christ and all the churches is giving life and the judgment seat wherever people comes to the church to be judged and the church said guess what if you come to Kay the church this is cater Sarnia preaching every one of us understand that but I said whatever church you go to the church is giving life the third preach is giving a slide if we receive it if not we can go on with God and the judges remain upon us and this human be building the shame and all these things because we want to dress something we must address it like hey - and move on in ox grace the other so hey - the one they found that are sprayed was a type of heaven glory and all these other streams and what else were types of little churches hallelujah the trouble is today people come to church and they're pat on the back and the thing is because they pay it on the collection plate because they become a deacon because it becomes something else in the church rather or can drive up in a better car or can wear better clothes or something like that you're respected and you're patted on the back rather what we did need today is some old fashioned preachers who call black black and white white like John the Baptist Laurie no matter how much you pay how much you don't pay god is romeo stay here we don't pet anybody on the back we look for the leadership of the holy spirit brother there's only one way to get to happen that's what the Christ Jesus being born again by the Holy Spirit set the baby born again I don't know why is there the kingdom said our Lord Jesus Christ what is it what it is I'm living it might change what a shaky guys always kind of haters Church god I'm always I don't say they'll all come to grammar school it'll see on the street I don't say though go to the Christian Church or whatever I say that God in every Church has dismembered a man I'm gonna say it again God in every Church has its member take a head so even this is one of the every even in this church God's got real members that are born again hey man he said he December's of the slightest or to get they're the ones who are true to God so every true Holy Ghost feel Christian will be true the word they're the ones who love the Lord Jesus with all their heart and all their soul don't find them reading their Bible and what prayer meetings well this week I've asked everybody to pray at your home if you didn't hear it on the email and that you heard it have prayer meetings in your home that's how I said you bring a revival some revival of your home you'll find them who the ones that are true to God reading their Bible prayer meetings doing everything they can for the kingdom of God that's right but the mixed multitude just overpowered and worldly trying to pull them back to the things of the world what we've got to have today is other Danish Barnea where judgment in so most people we don't need that program said we do need that right we need to see who's really going to take the promise of God who wants to go to the fullness of Pentecost that brother Ed Otis is the said the Lord who wants to go to that prophecy who wants to live out that prophecy who wants more of Christ we need a cash Barnea to see who really wants that amen cuz that's the prophecy of the Owlery then it's exactly right I don't understand that by God's grace let me go back to that bear with me just a moment preach that one in language go back maybe some of us forgot that prophecy but the prophecy is by Ram said the sale order all of the Pentecost will be in the prop should have plenty of meat just under wide plenty oils so rejoice aside or Savior I remember that yeah I'll be a motor I think that's important without a vision the people do us and vision means prophecy unless you know the prophecy for our day going to perish the prophecy we've got the prescient happy the fullness of Pentecost in the blood and you look at the Bible and that's what we should have praise God that's what we should be pressing on the upward way for alright here it is let me just review that number I'm a watch man number Wednesday a message on the west and I've got a Dagon what the word says yeah [Music] what about the truce you know just this will happen just as we have said the people of God is elated by the word of truth from the messenger Tuesday how would you be made right for the rapture in her will be the what fullness not a partial the fullness of what Pentecost not the denomination the experience for the spirits you have you got to be in touch with the holy spirit yes we believe father something oh the father is the holy spirit we know that I'm saying we've got to be in touch with God in us amen the Spirit will bring the people right back to where they were at the beginning in other words we'll go right back to Acts chapter 2:11 ornate that is the safe William Branham no shudder that is no safe Jesse Smith no sir that is thus saith the Lord amen how many like that by God's grace it's not me it's not vice not really random it's the Holy Spirit is going to take us back to Pentagon oh that serves me up at lures on a new young that is the cycle or that's what Joel - 23 to 26 sets how did Olivia that's where we're going that's the prophecy we're living under and so see we are making decisions at Kadesh Barnea either to believe this or not believe it actions are louder than our words are there yeah so your home in your prayer life and your reward with God either you are being made ready or you're not being ready your actions speak louder than anything you could possibly say on Sunday morning my life as well the former rain teaching ministry brother Brendan laterade fracturing faith Maghreb City and the floor should be full of wheat wheat makes bread well plenty of bread when we come to the house of God and the fast you overflow with white or white is about to I'm sorry oh those the batches Holy Ghost and why does the stimulation of the word exactly right and I'll restore to you the years of the locust disease okay there's that evil spirit right in the horse ages just like the poor horse riders so church we're living in our restoration I love the fact that I came out of the nominations of you were raised the message god bless your heart I wish I was Marie Sid but I was so what I'm saying is that I was raised the denomination coming to the message and I can see the restoration happening there understand what I'm saying although I saw his nomination was dollars five dollars for her more evil more evil but I look at my life now I look at the ministry no unity is other words the higher way more holiness more sanctification or of God's work or the Holy Spirit we are walking up the keys highway it's the way of holiness say that I could personally firsthand see the downward spiral but now I can see how God is restoring his church we all thank God for that if your life's not being restored to look of X and that's what this office for that's okay this party is for father there yet to give you a chance to say god I'm wrong God forgive me I'm doing this done wrong but that's it be big enough to admit you're wrong and then God can get you back in grace again don't you love that and he shall eat in plenty plenty of word food to eat romances or those tapes right you're starting to taste preaching the days watching one of the night on Wednesday night it's a tape start it up and be satisfied and praise the name of the Lord your God this is what this is what as a pastor this is my biggest burden I want to see people satisfied with just coming to church just coming to church just serving the Lord just being satisfied to be a Christian because we have all the week we have all the oil here ball the one you could possibly work what could be more satisfying than the Holy Ghost nothing so the thing is that people aren't satisfied with the Holy Ghost they're getting their set of extractions somewhere else and that's from the devil we must be satisfied from the Holy Ghost a.m. Alleluia judgment begins here at the house of God nuts out in your house necessarily or down at the Akron Arena it begins right here the house we got amen that's exactly right church and it's thus saith the Lord Jesus not me but Madison twice's thus saith the Lord and you're going to praise the name of God because you don't wonder she with you and you'll never be ashamed of the message tell me about that amen let's get back to my thought there it's funny I want you to see that church I'm not making that up I would never ever want to add anything to the message about yesterday about two times I saw painter at a craft show and I said did you paint you sign up always one of the side she said sure I can pages huh I said thank you the sign up says we don't change the message the message changes us she said well how do you want I said just get inspired and just get inspired me what everything going on there bring that here but okay you go in my room that said I was right there I said I saw that I'm brother cams desk one time at like just hitting like a ton of bricks that's my testimony I'm not changing what mother Adam says brother branham's words are changing me all right we don't change the message the message changes us hold it up to the amount that you see so I got two of them I got one for my house I got one for the church of my office there you guys like that by God's grace if you want what let me not get you'll make it out goes give out our blog that really blessed me and I'm not saying anything but man did say this is all what brother Branham said we've got to recognize the prophecy the hour and then press our way into it what John the Baptist say about the kingdom of God is it easily got into you said no the violent take it by force in other words the aggressive I know where I need to go I know what I need to do and I'm going to press my way into the kingdom of God and there's no demon that's going to pull me down or anybody trying to discourage me or undercut me or anything like that or blackmail me like that I'm going to press my way the people who've got is yours little flock it's God's good pleasure to give you the king of a man I know yeah and never very few we can be saved very few even go in the rapture brother ran out it exploded numerous times to say hopefully there's eight he said because that was the days of Noah and Jesus said as it was the days of Noah and then asked him is that crops he said no that's just my thought doctor do you think about that how many people do you know that want the force of Pentecost in their lives that's should be I say that's what we should be praying for that's what we should be living for for more of God in our lives hey man Zack you're right the world today America doesn't like the gospel they want entertain it they gotta have something to entertain them a lot of fancy music or something like that some kind of a party so quite a weenie roast which some things are alright outside the church but the church is where judgment ought to be preached in the power of the resurrection of the Lord Jesus and a warning watch more than I was that sermon about ones that it's my duty to warn the rest of the pastor must warn from the pulpit anything he sees he must warn the people I get he does it the souls on him the Bloods on him if I see sin if I see our church go visit sort of things that I don't preach against it it's shame on me woe to me if I don't preach the gospel it's exactly right there the watchman there the one who's called rest' he's responsible he said judgment begins those of God not parties judgment ah America people is entertained that's what they have to happen that leads the spirit that's in them be careful what you're feeding on right it shows what's in you whatever you feed on it's an entertainment spirit you have to entertain them god I don't entertain people he rebukes people well that's a tough hook to free sometimes he don't undertake you he wants to review you Jesus said as many as I love I rebuke and chasten and that's not for Philadelphia that's for you and I but as man that's the office later seeing Saints here by God's grace judgment begins at the house of God when it comes to time the church has to have soup suppers dances uncle games all kinds of nonsense of Roman sales to pay the preacher God have mercy yeah that's right so God don't come to entertain you now he'll bless you right if it would joy less your heart but he comes here to correct us right he comes to preview us and we got to have enough grace to know if God loves me he rebukes me we need the Holy Ghost and power and adoption that our ministry will speak out amen but the people when they go to see something they go to see a certain ministry here this pose got a certain ministry well they go over and say oh yeah that's pretty good huh that's ok well where we going tomorrow weather has photos making a point like people just get entertainment preachers instead of finding where the ministry God called him to set under they just go to be entertained by administer a little bit recognizing that spirit what was that 1960 even he saw well people's go to this church cuz they like that ministry it's fine if you like that ministry that supported for the RAM said with all your attendance and all your ties and make it your post of duty until you die or remember said or you go in the rapture other than via speak to this rock when they come to a place called Kadesh Barnea at one time I'm told as a great judgement seat it says a great spring or well there are many little whales a perfect type of church the church is the judgment seat we're having is the great judgment seat of God and the little widows represent the little churches all outta judgment begins the house of God see here's where the judgment begins here that's I don't see why so many people complain that I speak so too hard and try to make people straighten up and tell them the way they're living the way they're dressing and tell me I'm hurting my ministry when the judgment seat is the house of God he said I don't understand why they complain this is where you get judged this is where the Holy Spirit through the preaching says either that's wrong or that's right that's why you come here but see the Church of God how she God's become a entertainment house rather than a courthouse that's why I told so many ways how you dress up for church and I was trying to be real gentle I said you know brothers yeah I understand you I said come as you are I'm trying to be real diplomatic I said come as you are I said but we dress up because we know we're going to God's courtroom and you don't go be set before any Honorable Judge look in any old way because they'll see right through your laziness or your your disagreeable spirit right the fact that you're guilty but you come to the house of God it's business it is the judgments of God that are on our lives amen judging this is the right move this is the wrong move straighten up get back in line Jesus loves us when we're in line Amen hallelujah that's where you begin it right here where justice and righteousness and judgment of God is to go for for Blair the tape player the pulpit the pulpit is supposed to go from a living creature exactly right it's getting another sermon that noticed a a great famous Pentecostal preacher took me the room out a year ago and said brother grant let me lay hands upon you pray for you I said I'm not sick he said there's something wrong in your ministry you operate no wonder the preachers won't properly do it's the way you condemned them women he was just preaching on women living a holy life he said let me lay hands on you sir I'm not sick lover he said well people think they are they and you don't teach them spiritual things after they receive great spiritual blessings and things I said how can you teach the knowledge or they can be super ABCs they don't have the common decency to line up with the word of that long spiritual thing and they don't believe the earthly things how they going to believe how many things he said well you'll just you ruin your ministry and I said any ministry the Word of God will ruin it should be ruined oh come back to the word that's right a hard anymore you might like you all the way stay home on Wednesday nights and no come over here to church watching television other nights of church think you really say if you have to come to church you have to force yourself good because we think it's a law for you to do it so now is getting the people that you have to force themselves to come to church they don't love coming to church if you don't love it come to church by benches time you got to pray praise God I appreciate what - Wednesdays ago two Sundays ago if you don't love everybody here love coming out look out he said it's time to you about to praying because saint has objected you with some type of poison and it's hurt said that's what Christ to Mister God really just listen to this week he said you want to do it is I would do it if you don't love to do it why go to church on Wednesday night there's something wrong there's a Holy Spirit that makes you love to serve God what a quote that would be not to take that to all domestic churches that said before if you drive a live an hour and half I don't expect you to drive an hour and a half an hour on expect you do that but if you can be here and you're choosing not to and it's a your feel like you're forcing if you fit this quote and you feel like it's a force to go to church that you've missed something because the love of God makes you want to go to church not a duty but a love to God it supposed to duty but you keep the duty out of love anything though you hate it that you're right on beach the reason the Holy Spirit today we rebuke and tear down the church remember that is in church age as many as I love I rebuke as many as I love our group thank God for rebuking a real father who straightened us up and get us out brother having thanks God that's a real father that will straight you up so I got to straighten up Malachi in the Lydia and these different months I hate to do it but a real father does that and they always ask me daddy come in the store when you got spanked by your dad love here that day you never Eddie's thinking up to that you cannot because I'm in it but I just learned a lesson give the rod if you don't give the rod it spoils and makes a selfish shot I mean no that's the scripture to some degree out of this but you must give some physical pain or you spoil the child it's exactly right thank God for rebuking a real father he saw happen a medal day today you very much was upset at what I said the other night about widows it was not nice for persons do that absolutely up scripts you said I don't if I don't preach against sin are my ministry be ruined how many understand that because then you let the goats in and then it's no longer a Ministry of crisis and ministry to the Jezebel Church yeah any woman had a cut her hair of her head this I was earning husband the Bible said with her head and you can preach to them that lady met me outside she's let me tell you stuff right now preacher you're sure going to ruin your ministry I said any ministry the Word of God will ruin ought to be ruined exactly right she said well everybody walk away from you I said as long as he stays with me that's the main that you see let him say Amen that's my safe brochure says that's why these things are burning all the Arts for months and years in these things I'm just trying to stay with the word if I preach something wrong with ramps if we're duty obligated come talk to me about it privately and tell me I've had nobody to come to tell me I'm wrong on any major doctrine but see it's a pastor Bernstein I preach the truth I feed them the Word of God and people walk away what can you do just love them and pray for them and keep increasing your service for Jesus amen I thought you can't let it get discourage you to decrease your service or dedication to Christ it must inspire you to increase your service a bang is that the season of my life I might be I might be in the darkest season in my life right now how do I know I might be I might be in a fire tear of of Jesse Smith litem praise God the darkest hour where I feel like all of the low and everything you know you know how it is go go go through hard times and people say things against you know all things like this but what you have to do you just have to love them back and you have to increase your service to Christ how many other Lord in Adam in church I just thought I'd share this just let me ask you the morning the Bible said rebuke a dog let us send rebuked before everybody let me know that also that Timothy we've had three people well three individuals over the years I'm not going to name any time spirits and we're still friends on Facebook and I'm trying to reach out to all of my email and calls and they won't get back with me and some of these are from years ago some of them a little more recent but let me just share some of these one of them was a preacher that preached here and we sat in ministers meetings together something's I shared I mean let me just show you with this I'm sharing you with you this because I've given them warnings and they able to take heed to the warning to understand this creature I've tried to warn him on different things like this and different pause things he was saying and recently I saw him on Facebook and he had put a video of himself a dancing tour dozen roses at a wedding reception of his daughter drunk singing oh sweet child of mine sweet you know if you're in the world you remember that song MS song house in the world preach from this pulpit right here and the first thing they left meetings and then they sound even church this is one of the first days where's judgement begin Church at the house of God and this person was up to be a pastor of the church and was almost coated as pastor you see how slide that demonic satanic spirit can be he's the upside of this just like Judas all around for three and a half three half years undetected but Jesus detective the oligo slow detected amen and this brother was a minister regular set ministers meeting sheriff's of things told testimony about speaking in tongues and all these things and message camp meetings around the world that don't mean nothing to your current walk with God is what shows what you are your curva that's it never judge yourself out how many miracles but how much fruit you're currently producing a night I mean understand that wondered I tried to correct him on doctrine he would say my dad was too hard about marriage and divorce and name-calling all these things like that I said no sir you got to understand where he's coming from and now dancing the rock and roll and he has a bastard on he put a post recently said one leg of a servant so he cusses telling a sermon or pastor what a great sermon was a man that used to presa medicine right alongside me at church you see what happens when you don't take a warning you see how the judgments of God rest upon these people god help us to be sincere with the word of your hand help us to see that everything we do has an impact every little decision must be brought back to the Word of God if not you'll just fall one step further and says one step and then what is that earlier one step further see you got to deal with the K - and you got to get right with God and then you'll be back in God's grace again amen one of our founding members of this church warden a warning repeatedly called it sobbing on the phone begging them to come back now post up about a homosexual rights and loving homosexuality and post things about making love with people and all kinds of things like that and I've seen them dancing the spirit I've seen them fast I see them speak in tongues I've seen through all these things like that it doesn't matter how you start with God it's how you finish with God it man it's exactly right warning after warning after warning what will happen they stopped coming to the house of God they stopped here the judgments of God and so they left and now they're under what they're under judgment instead of under grace you see that I do have a brother Adam called out people he caught them by name Elvis Presley Pat boom boom he named some more he called JFK Jacqueline Kennedy he called it all these people out by name and the Bible said them to sin rebuke before all and I'm sharing these examples as warnings the next one is a brother had one allowance eight minutes I ever had in my church and I sure appreciate Amen Corner always what did they make mortar you understand I'm saying oh but I walked and then I was dealing with this person met with them emailed them text them to repent all these things and one day and I walk in the minister and help out and they're actually in the act they just got done with fornication I got to turn my eyes and see things like this let's send the message I've cried with them I prayed with them all these things like this a facet for them all the things and you see how we have this no matter what happens to the people the true life of God will be pure to God they'll stay with the word they'll love the Word of God they'll be here the house of God hearing that their sins are forgiven a net glory and they'll line their lives up with the word that is preached at this spring at this well at this river that gives for living waters of living rivers of life amen living waters of rivers of light on the Nubia you understand that those are three as I was praying here forty minutes before service they coming up honey you need to share that to warn one little step away one of those step away and take you another step and then another step these are all people I'm great with like I said seen God do great things through to understand so if I give you a warning right when i text people and hope you'll how you do a mission church today or by email and say what about this and what about that if i talk together servicer you know hate we talked about this or some like that it's done because it's the love of god so we understand it's the love of god I just got to get that off my heart here cuz up and just a rough here here my gosh we've had you know that not just a win just in certain ways you know this is her ways I just gotta preach this here my man said you're never afraid it's going to hurt anything when I got a breach against in or great people I should never be afraid he's going to hurt anything you might hurt sin but you'll never hurt righteousness by preaching righteous and that glory that's what I've got a hard time sometimes be like I'm hurt people's feelings things like that I got to have blinders on where all I see is Christ I don't see feelings I will see faces I just see what what is Christ what does the man of end of the balcony want me to say any minute what does he want me to say he's know what I've got to please he's going to gotta answer for for my ministry let me I shall answer for every word left reached I am sorry we're not dream I'm glad to know it's not my work Robin's words mouths word every Church has decadence running a primary doubt equip everybody else right the first thing I want to say my travels around the world as far as I know this is the one most spiritual places you feel the Spirit of God more in any of the church I know it's about granite ever now I had two other places in mind that used to be but so far we don't seem to see those places one of them is when the organization and the other has kind of followed see every church comes to a K - Barnea everybody see that brother Branham uses five three great churches where the Spirit of God moved all the time right but he said Reese just recently I found two churches that the Spirit of God doesn't move there anymore now whose fault is that but I said to the pastor or the congregation is fault or both their fault so we understand what I'm saying we are Church this is our little humble Bride of Christ fellowship we need to take a little more serious you don't when sometimes absolutely because we have welcome to Kadesh Barnea I want it aside with a men are we going into the promise of God are we going to hold back on God we can't do it we're not big enough our church is too small there's no way we can take rapture of faith oh come on Josh from Kate alert or Josh and Kayla get up there and testify I've been on that side I've seen rapture power I've seen healing power glory I've seen prophecy power I've seen all these things we're more than able to take the rapture amen sorry our church is going to cover that I understand that we're going to come to that bring a tabernacle Happy Valley Oh spoken word Tabernacle every Church is going to come the Kadish Barnea we've got to be able to say we're going to take that and then I actually got to back it up not doing less forgot it but do it and more for God however that looks for you it might just be praying at home and that is if that is praise God what a wonderful ministry that is prayer is the most powerful what we've got ever gained in the country okay for this church pay for the service pray for me pray for the musicians pray prayers most powerful thing you can do to help our church go into rapture in faith I understand that rather than I'm sure you do realize that as I made this remark about this being a spiritual place the branagh tabernacle it isn't the biggest place in the world it isn't what we have the most thing in the most screaming most holler of the most speaking and tons of things that isn't it but it's the quality of the sphere that operates here in this tabernacle and so far and I looked so far I don't know if it's there today now I'm not the pastor there that's all about the judges if I was passed so far I want to commend and thank mother Neville and you brother trustees because for what you have done in helping keeping this this way it's been a long prayer mind and desire since a boy to see the church put in order and kept it so you see every church has to come to Cadis corneum programs on to churches come to the Kay - and they turn it down one fell away the sin and one of them went to organization we're have to come to K - party aren't you glad you know aren't you glad God gives a warning before judgment hi there you from the house of judgment right let's go if you're sick tonight you've got to make a decision whether you're going to accept Christ as your healer honey you can't wishy-washy dilly-dally with it you got to say I believe it or I don't believe it I'm going to be where I can I got faith enough to be well you got to make your decision if you're a sinner tonight you got to make you say you're at Katie's party how you got to place the judgment seat I'll look good for divided healing you got to come - okay - every since you every try your life seems to be okay - are you good to take God's work am I going to take outward or not is this helping people by God's grace remember you can't move on with God until you deal with the K - the trial K - am I going to take this promise or not am I going to back away I'm going to be scared to take the progress we're going to go on with God am I going to obey God or just try to disobey God and try to get just get by with it for a while oh god help us help us to obey the Word of God that's what those little Springs or churches represented that when out where the judgment begins house of God Jesus said so - itself and judgment begins also God were in the house of God tonight and you've got to make your decision we've got to make your decision where they're going to come to Christ where they've been turned out every sinner is going to make that decision you either go out of that door a better man a woman that you come in or you'll go out worse than it was when you come in you can't stand mediocre tonight you've got to make it this was all my heart now it's on my heart now it's on your hands to this man that's that's what I said too I read these are this morning it's all about heart what I got to do I give it up I gotta give that to you I'm just saying what the Prophet said you've got to make your decision you have to maybe a good church member maybe voice long that you've wanted more of God how many can say that I slit I will or God you wanted to do some for God remember you're only mortal ones I said this quote earlier is I kind of took the endless stuff that's only one time you're going to be mortal and this might be the time you got to make your decision you either going to move up with God or stay where you're at you may have to make your decision tonight now look may this may be Arcada she's serving right now I don't know what I know what the prophecy says and I know how to preach God's Word and I know the rapture seemed to come and we know the tribulation is soon to come - we've got to make ready for it for the registry if it is your can - I pray you don't throw everything loose remember I don't care what it is if it's a job if it's your family put your loved ones if it's associates and fit your partners whatever it is turn loose of everything either puts his hand on the plow it even turns to look back is not worthy plowing he said that's right the Candace based on cash marnya which was a great judgment seat and it's supposed to be an oasis out there in the desert we're big wells and Springs and say that it and we can go to Tyson say that it's a throne of God at the little judgment seats the churches so we're just a little judgment seat this is a little open little judgement seat he says where judgment begins he's preaching tonight and he said I want you I want to kind of use it more like it was a room of the courtroom where and after all the Pope and the church is a courtroom the Bible says the judgment see that begins the house of God and this is like the throne at the jury the witnesses so forth and here today for my witness is God's Word and what do I have lay before me when we have before every service God's Word this will witness our lives with us we either believed it organic our actions always speak louder than our words understand that I'm closing with this so Oh give my word I love this this is the court I just came across the story thankful more well the man who said this is a judgment house and the judgment house is where you let your sins go and it was so perfect that brother Mike came here to give his testimony for the Mike is from from the cam Church he was a like a bottom Serb construction worker 270 pounds of all muscle and a police officer was called to shoot him because he was messing up the community they lived in and it's on and I got the video home I got a cop shot him 15 feet away in the back and for years he's been paralyzed for nine years and he was just ready to give up he bail from church to church and added Emmaline my cousin who was here in that sanctuary few months ago your ever remember that was Jason the Mars is here you guys remember my cousin Adam he left our church so on fire now he's since not you know he doesn't come to the churches yet but he left our church so on fire he went and he couldn't get this night guys out of his own wheelchair he shot by cop lost ability to walk and Mike's struggle with you know sin he struggled all these things never heard the message and but my because I was like I can't get Mike off my heart man I gotta share with my the message that Jesse and Simon bleed so he called him up Simon came and the brother Mike's like set it over right now he was searching he was really searching for God he says him over Simon goes over in the first Bible study their hearts got kindled together because they're both over there by one side of Hope pipefitters you know they're both of the trades and a preacher Kenneth and he started coming to camp search and a preacher came sandy beach and reach on to repentance and it was right before the court trial where they're going to condemn this cop he was gyah trying to kill brother might he was guilty of it and the sermon was all repentance and so for the mic was of course weeping and fighting out with true repentance is how is he going to go to court now condemn this man who shot him but the Bible says you have to forgive seventy times seven and so he goes to the courtroom and it's on tape I can show you the video if you want he goes to the courtroom and he holds up his King James Bible and he says I learned by true Christianity for the King James Bible that I must forgive this police officer please chop drop all the charges and it was news all over Toledo antenna and it was shared all over all kinds of stairs all over Facebook and all these things and so it was at that courtroom that brother Mike let the sin of anger of a man who shot him in the back he let that go in the courtroom and that man walked away scot-free where'd it happen at in the courtroom and that's a beautiful picture of what our life should look like every time we come to church if we're condemnation up if you're walking your fold all the O's will know will sense it somebody will sense it your feel the spirit go fire by your walk in the spirit will sense that when you go in here feeling guilty God's got away a piece of there's a great court system give up your sins to God and your sins will go before you your sins will be forgiven right here in God's courthouse and here's the scripture program uses for me some men's sins are open before him going before to judgment and some men they follow after some men's days go before them some men's sins follow after them to the judgement likewise also the good works of summer manifest beforehand and they that are otherwise cannot be hid the same are features a program says as we close I prayed for the church here that he's lovely that's they called in heavenly father now to us not just bring us to the house of correction and correction begins at the house of God judgment starts here some men's sins goes on before them some vowel if you go to the scripture I never had seen this before more let ours go before us as we confess them that they're wrong and may we have mercy grace from thy Son Jesus but the Bible say your sins either go before you they're going to follow you I don't want any sin follow me to the judgment to read with me Halon I hope you don't want your sins following you we've got to set our sins before us we're at the throne at the courtroom at the house of God how many like that by God's grace how many 1 that our reality in their life or let my sins go before me that they don't follow me I thought I could get away with this I thought I could cut it your orders here I thought I could kind of break the message here there you can't you can't God is the one who searches the hearts and so I just put this in this was for me it may be for some of you to the Rams I read this laugh a couple weeks ago it's hard to always be a servant isn't it but those who spend in our step for others will one day be seated with him in his throne but after what a lesson there's no ceasing of this gracious service of love unto the Lord but rather an increasing of service that is the secret to the Christian life we know the secret is more service more prayer more love more read your Bibles more spending time alone with God aren't you glad you know the secret a random says samson's see here was the prayer meetings his prayer times with God he could reach back inside to operating through hallelujah I can feel that covenant I can feel the power of God hey let the enemy attempt us for our service for the Lord our reply this will increase our service to God I'm not going to backside on God I'm not going to increase what I'm doing I'm going to increase it all so they'll be very gladly spend and be spent or you know the more abundantly I love you the less time you left parents can understand that I'm sure grandparents you try to love your children sometimes you try to love friends you trial of aunts and uncles the more you love them the less they love you Paul had to deal with that but guess what that's part of being a Christian the Bible said because of iniquity love of many shall wax but we should expect that this is what I'm trying to in my heart to try to wrap my mind around this constantly to fulfill this I will keep increasing my love for Christ I will not decrease it I'll keep increasing my love and if I can keep loving the less I'm loved that's fine as long as I know he loves hey man hey man I know the prophecy less love less Holy Spirit of people's lives but for us we can be different we can fall under the prophecy of the hour we want to do this stuff on us the first fruits the house is upon us they have addicted themselves to the Ministry of the saint where you going to Sunday afternoon where you going to spends day night I'm going to church I'm addicted to church I'm addicted to pray for my brothers and sisters where you go
