verses 1 to7 and then Psalms 149 verses 1 to6 tonight praise the Lord so I'll read that if you don't have your Bibles that's okay verse one Psalms 147 verse one praise ye the Lord for it is good to sing praises unto our God for it is pleasant and his praise is cly the Lord doth build up Jerusalem he gathered together the outcasts of Israel he Health the broken in heart and bindeth up their wounds he tell the number of the Stars he called them all by their names great is our Lord and of great power his understanding is infinite the Lord lifteth up the meek he casteth the wicked down to the ground sing unto the Lord with Thanksgiving sing praise unto the I'm sorry upon the harp of our God Amen let's go to Psalms 149 verses 1 to6 says Praise You the Lord sing unto the Lord and new song and his praise in the congregation of saints let Israel rejoice in him that made him let the children of Zion be joyful in their King let them praise His name in The Dance Let Them sing praises unto him with the timal and heart for the lord taketh pleasure in his people he will beautify the meat with salvation let the Saints be joyful in glory let them sing aloud upon their beds let the high Praises of God be in their mouth and a two-edged sword in their hand and the church said let's say it together amen praise God you may be seated before he comes here we I just want to introduce again brother Ashton's been a great friend to me tremendous example with his music as I was telling brother Austin here he's an aspiring musician I said you're in the right place tonight because you're gonna see a brother who is consecrated he gives his time and his efforts and supports fully supports the the the gifts and talents that God has given to him and they've been such a tremendous blessing in my life Austin as a young Christian his music was such a a key influence in my life and I really thank God for that and it continues to be a great blessing too so I know we can all gain a lot from tonight and praise is so wonderful so he's all the way from Lima so we're very appreciative of the travel he made if you don't have one of his two CDs let me know if you can't afford it I'll buy you one I bought the church on some about two three years ago so if you need some good Christian music that's it by God Grace you really like that so as our brother comes he's going to come and sing I think first with the mic got a little bit of adjusting to do with the sound and so forth like that let's give the Lord Round of Applause as it's very kind appreciate the introduction um I just thank you guys so much for the opportunity to uh come here tonight I'm G have to kind of stand probably over here with the soundtracks it's where the speakers are so you can actually hear the music so it's not like anybody's in the front row anyway but anyway just really appreciate the opportunity to come here tonight and and sing and be a blessing and I don't want this to be about me I want this to about the Lord the purpose is not to be seen or heard the purpose is to glorify the Lord so these uh these songs the Lord has given over over a process of time I probably started writing songs when I was the first album I did was back in 200 2007 I think it was so it was it I'd been writing songs before then but never really really did anything with them um but and i' I've looked back over the years and and my songwriting my style has definitely changed and I I feel like the songs that I'm writing currently are much more reflective of who I am whenever you see a song somebody who writes a song or even a minister what what what they are what they're bringing forth whether it be a sermon or a song that they're actually writing it's a reflection of who they are who they are their hearts and it's reflection of where they are with God it really really is so sometimes I I've struggled in the past with actually getting up and singing a song in front of people because I feel like I'm just totally laying my heart out on the table for everybody to see in a congregation um because there there's one of the songs here tonight that and I'll go into a little bit more um just it's it's reflective of where I am at that particular time in my life and what maybe situation I was going through different trial different circumstance whatever it was so sometimes you you struggle with being transparent in front of a bunch of people um and you know I'm sure pastors and ministers feel that way with sermons they feel like I'm just gonna totally offend everybody or totally um make people think of me poorly or or you know whatever it may be but the gifts and callings without repentance and they're not for ourselves they're for the body of Christ and they're ultimately for God so I just pray this is a blessing tonight I've got some cheat sheets in my pockets with words if anybody feels like singing in I know I know lot lot of the kids here know some of these songs so please feel free to sing along you can also then help me out the words and if I won't forget anything you can go ahead brother Jesse with first [Music] one this is the day that I will praise the Lord I will make known his mighty word this is the day that I'll ex his name I will shout his name throughout the Earth for this is the [Music] day this is the day that I will praise the Lord I will make know mighty words is the day I his I will shout his name throughout the Earth for this is the [Music] day Lord you are my salvation I will trust in you [Music] and Lord You Are My Strength and my song for I find true Joy when you are me this is the day that I will praise the Lord I will make know his mighty word is the day that I ex his I will shout his name through the Earth for this is the [Music] day Lord you are the stream of my life I draw water from your living well Lord you are the bread that I eat you satisfy my every need you satisfy my or yes today that I will praise the Lord I will make your my oh this the day I ex name I will shout his name throughout the Earth for this is the [Music] day this is the day this is the day that the Lord has made I will rej in this [Music] day amen it's one of my favorite songs it's just a praise and worship joyful song I won't tell you how that that song got written though I keep to myself um no actually I I wrote it after I got done watching a movie long story um so we we'll go to uh the next one this song is a an old old old song I can't remember how long I wrote this song but uh it's on my my first album which I look back at that first album and just want to shake my head sometimes but um could I have a little more mic if it's possible so anyway this is an old old song and hope it's a blessing to [Music] you when the burdens get too heavy and the load you cannot Bear for the trials all surround you and you feel like no one cares well there's a strength that's stronger than yours and that strength is the Lord for he's got a set of shoulders that are stronger yours so just cast your heavy bir cast them on the Lord for God will help you bear your load if you'll just trust his word why don't you cast your heavy bir cast them all the Lord for he's got a set of shoulders that a strongs amen you don't need to Bear your trials alone your trials God will bear if he sees a little Sparrow fall then for you you he surely cares God's counted every one of your hairs and he knows your beginning and end so just cast your burdens on him for you can depend on him why don't cast your heavy bir cast them on the Lord for God will help you be your load if you'll just trust his word why don't you cast your heavy bir cast them on the Lord for he's got a set of shoulders that stronger your well why don't you cast your heavy bird cast them on the Lord for God will help you bear your load if you'll just trust his word why don't you cast your heavy cast them on Lord he a of shoulders that are stronger than yours well he's a got a set shoulders stronger [Music] yours [Music] amen you know I think so often we do try to Bear our trials alone and and I like I like the one part of the song where it says he'll you know he'll bear our burdens if we'll just trust his word amen we got to trust his word that what he says that he will do but if we're not trusting his word then he's not obligated to to Bear our burdens for us and and I think so oftentimes we we try to Bear our burdens ourselves you know we try to be our own burden bear we try to be our own strongman our own ox but but we got to trust his word we absolutely have to trust his word um this next song is is also an old one it it goes back to um my brother at the time in his life he was trying to go through some this is been probably 10 years ago he was going through some decisions in his life and just kind of a turning point with what am I going to do with my career what am going to do with my future all that kind of stuff you know he was at the time he was at a marable marriageable age and looking to start his career going to college just had multiple decisions in his life that he was trying to to find what what is the best thing to do what should I do in this situation ETA so he went to uh brother Barry coffee and was talking with brother Barry coffee and asking him some questions about you know you know his future and and what's the best way to make this decision and and brother Barry just said just stop just enjoy the journey just enjoy the journey and I think so oftentimes we we get so focused on what do I do with this what do I do with this what am I going to do with this situation how do I make this decision and and really it just comes down to we're on a journey and the Lord is with us on that Journey he's never going to leave us or forsake us he stays with us he's never going to leave us so just enjoy the journey and just trust him that he is our guide he's never going to put anything in front of our paths that he doesn't know is going to it's already he's already planned it he already knows what's coming down the pike so to speak so nothing catches God by surprise Hallelujah he's got it all in control so just enjoy the journey okay just just rest just trust in him and and and if we keep taking things back and and and we do that when we say well what am I going to do about this what I going to do about that that's what worry and anxiety comes in is when we're trying to take the control ourselves but if we just enjoy the journey and just commit it to the Lord he will our gentle Shepherd will never lead us astray so that's that's where this song comes in [Music] are you worried about tomorrow does your future seem unclear are you facing many trials and overwhelmed by your [Music] fears just trust in Jesus for he can take your doubts away L to his gentle voice [Music] he's enjoy the journey for I've got a plan for you give me all your fears and I will see you through enjoy the journey and just let me lead the way yourest night will soon become the breaking of the [Music] day has the path become rough and have you lost your way are you trusting another guide and has he led you astray give the map to Jesus for he's been this way before relax and as he tells you just more enjoy the journey for I've got a plan for you give me all your fears and I will see you through enjoy the joury and just let me lead the way and your night will soon become the breaking of the day enjoy the journey for I've got a plan for you give me all your fears and I will see you [Music] through enjoy the journey and just let me leave the way and your darkest night will soon become the breaking of the day [Music] amen this next one um it's just been a few months ago can I have a little more with Mike a chance testing testing that it's better I don't know if it's too much though we'll see thank [Music] you there was a a situation of change in our lives and you know sometimes change is good and sometimes all all change is wonderful let's just put it that way because without change we would never grow right we would always stay stagnant we would never overcome who would never grow um and some but sometimes you know when God brings change into our lives the flesh doesn't like it very much right which is this was kind of the situation I was in was kind of in a situation where I was out of my completely out of my comfort zone completely out of my what I wanted in my flesh so to speak and was basically thrown into situation that I I knew as of God and knew I was walking with God and God was in it and he was ordaining all of it but my flesh didn't like it very much and I literally felt very very much alone and very much kind of like Elijah felt on the back side of the desert and there's there's been you know when Elijah was on the backside of the desert he he was a prophet and he had undergone a great moment in his life of inspiration we had a word from the Lord and he had came up to this big big peak so to speak in his ministry had this word from the Lord for the the current situation in his day and then right after that the inspiration left and he crashed so to speak he crashed emotionally physically he was exhausted and that happens a lot of times with inspiration is you you get this inspiration this word from the Lord and then you you have a very low time and he he felt at that point in time of his life that he was on the back side of the desert and was feeling very you know alone and very empty and worthless so to speak felt like he had no point in his life you know at that point in time you know why am I here why did I why did God just bring me to this why did God fead me in this and now just lead me to this you know all all of this was for nothing and and it was in that time when God spoke to him but didn't speak to them through the howling winds or the fire or you know great big loud noises or signs and wonders but it just spoke to him through a still Small Voice and and that was in and this this story in the Bible came to me and it it reminded me that when we're on the back side of the desert the word of God is our everything that that is what we have is is the word of God because it is our bread it is our food it is our drink it is all that we have need of is in the word of God so it's in those backside of the desert when that word of God comes forth and speaks to us and reminds us that we are not alone we are not in this situation for not that God is in this so this is that's kind of where this comes from [Music] so I'm on the backside of the desert it's a dry Wilderness empty be and broken void lifeless I sit under the juniper tree feeling worthless inside thirsty and hungry for bread to sustain my life I hear a still Small Voice M the howling winds his words Quicken my soul giving strength to rise [Music] again this word is life this word is hold this word is strength to help us C in this DT land it's a living Street it's the food we it's all that we need all that we are and will ever [Music] be is in the world this world is a baren desert there's a famine of the heart they're hungry not for food drink but for the word of the Lord they are full and lacking nothing get stared within alive but dead in the graves of sin like the woman of sarapath our cruise of oil is never dried we've got fresh Mana from Heaven that sustains our Liv this word is life this word is hope this word is strength to help us C in this desert land it's our living Street it's the food we eat it's all that we need all that we are and will ever be is in the word so I run to the word with my mouth open wide I am empty fill me you alone have the words of [Music] life this word is life this word is hope this word is strength to help us cold in this desert land it's our living street it's the food we eat it's all that we [Music] need all that we are and will ever be is in the [Music] world holy words long reserved for our walk in this world if you sing it if you know what sing it they ReSound with God's Own Heart oh let the word of God in heart words of Life words of hope they give us strength help us C in this world where we roam the word of God will

you let's just uh go to that state on you this is also an old one off my my my pre my first uh album it's been one of my [Music] [Music] favorites Within Me rise and storms or shadow in deep blue sky

life when I was experiencing a lot of anxiety and different things in my life were going on and and this this the lord gave me this song and it's always been there you know it's always sometimes when you have a gift you don't realize that or you need to reminded that the gift isn't for yourself all right you know it's other people but there are times when your gift comes along and blesses you when when God gives you something and it comes along and it actually blesses you and ministers to you at a time when you needed the most and that's kind of where this song has come in there's been other times throughout my life when I when I was really going through a tough time was really struggling was really battling and this song came back in and it just really ministered to me in a very very special way so um you are my refuge and and and I I I think in this day and age we need a refuge even more so than we ever needed a refuge ever before in our lives ever needed a refuge and I'm so glad that we have a hiding place covert from the storm a sanctuary a place that we can go we know that we are safe and and it's our own fault if we leave The Refuge that's our own fault you know we have to stay behind the Refuge behind that wall of the word but we have a refuge and I'm so so thankful for that Refuge so go ahead and [Music] Ames I can't find my way with the darkness surrounds and I am a the pathway is obscure and I all alone no one to be my guide me but you will lead me to a place you will guide me with your ey you will show me the way to a refuge in the night you are my refuge you

are [Music] Jes you are my [Music] refuge you are you are you [Music] [Music] are praise God hallelujah thank you Jesus thank you Hallelujah this next one I'm going to skip thater to the end brother Jesse go to further up and further in um this next one actually kind of a story behind it um it comes from the last battle by CS Lewis the the phrase the last battle the the phrase there's a phrase in the last battle by CS Lewis where all the animals are they've entered into the new Narnia they've entered into the new land the new world and um they one of them says I think it might be the Raven or I can't remember which one it says come further up come further in and uh that just always struck me and and how that this this world that we have is a shadow of of what we have to come it is just a shadow of what is of the reality that we have to come amen and and what I what I liked about that book was that it it showed that the reality is being just so much more crystal clear so much more real so much more beautiful so much more vibrant so many more colors um and and we and we have a reality that that is that is ahead of us yeah we just have to come further up and come further in in in the word and in Christ and then the uh now we see through a glass Darkly but then face to face so now we're looking through a glass Darkly so to speak we're we're in the flesh we're in these in these bodies of Flesh in this world that is so dark but then we shall know is even we are also as as we are known because then will be our reality um and so that that's kind of where this this song comes from is uh is is come further up come further and that's it I had I actually written this song years years years ago and and just and didn't like the version didn't like the way it was coming out so I just kind of put on the shelf and said I'm just going to wait and just give it to the Lord and let see what happens and at that time and then you know several years ago at the ministry change CER at BCF and and and that that song came back to me and and the song just totally changed itself under a different ministry under a different headship that I don't believe that could have ever been that way under the previous Ministry and and so it it definitely was much more what I wanted it to be so to speak so [Music] [Applause] [Music] there's darkness in the land it's black as night Satan's eeden is everywhere but we walk in the light we're called to live above the darkness of this Age come out and be separate the spirit and the bright [Music] say come further up come further in come up higher deeper in him he's calling us out come out of the world there's rapturing power in the revealed word come further up come [Music] further like an eagle sares above and lies to new heights it looks up to the heavens with Revelation in its eyes so we dwell above the world up where the Eagles Fly the bride looks up expecting her Redemption draweth now come further up come further in come up higher come deeper in him he's calling us out come out of the world there's rapturing power in the r word come further up come further [Music] in arise and shine for the light has come arise and fly come up higher little Bri [Music] come further up come further [Applause] in come up higher come deeper in him he's calling us out come out of the world world there's rapturing power in the revealed world come further up come further up come further out come [Music] further [Music] amen hallelujah praise [Music] let you can skip to [Music] um don't pull away from God there's a probably oh probably 10 years ago at the time our our church youth group had a uh a little prayer group so to speak a little prayer group that met on Mondays or Tuesday evenings every evening and it was just the youth it was mostly the older youth that would would meet and have a prayer meeting um and it was a really really nice time to that kind of bound the the youth together in a very very special way I know there's definitely some relationships and friendships that were forged in that time under you know under a good atmosphere under prayer that have definitely endured so you know so to speak because there was very special you had the group of core group of kids young people in their latter teens in early 20s that were really committed on fire for the Lord and were really trying to serve the Lord and we're and were there at the prayer meeting for the right reasons and it was led by you know the older youth um so anyway there was there was a young man who had started coming to the church for for a while and everybody had he had had an addiction with with pornography um and with some with some struggles in his life and he had actually lost his wife as a result of the his addictions and struggles and um he was trying to get his life back you know right with God and he was started coming to church and was was trying to do what was right and everybody was investing a lot in his life and praying for him and and really trying to encourage him and be a friend to him in a time when he really needed that most um and so the process of time went on and he was coming to church and he was coming to the youth prayer meetings and trying to do what was right and then all of a sudden he just kind of quit coming and just and just completely stopped and just pulled away from everybody wouldn't wouldn't return phone calls wouldn't you return texts quit coming to church quit quit coming to the the prayer meetings all of this and it just and everybody just was very very heartbroken because they had spent so much of their time and their energy and their emotions and prayers and into this young man and and to see him just basically you know withdraw from all of that and and it it was very very sad and very heartbreaking he ended up um he's not serving the lord as best I know now but he you know had had gone through this period of time of you know kind of Revival in his life and then just kind of pulled away from God and it and it's so typical of of human beings and it you it goes all the way back to the Garden of Eden when when and Eve sinned that rather than go to the one who could be their source of healing and Redemption and salvation they did what human beings are from the beginning of time they're going to pull away withdraw hide and and that's the last thing that any of us need to do when we're struggling the last thing we need to do is is to pull away and withdraw and isolate ourselves because when we isolate ourselves the devil then is able to work and is able to speak to us and is we're on his playing Ground so to speak you know when we isolate ourselves and withdraw from God and from other fellow Believers that is when the devil is able to to get in and and work and move and speak his lies and and and so I think so that's where this song came from it actually it came from this young man and um you know it's a very very sad situation but it's it's always this song has always meant a lot to me because it it it has a has a very dear memory it has a very special time in my life um when I was you know trying to witness to somebody and and and trying to be a blessing and and it was heart-wrenching it truly was heart-wrenching when you give all of yourself and your faith and what you hold the closest to you try to give that to somebody and they receive it and then they turn away from you and drop it and and and walk away from all of it it it is heart-wrenching because that's you have what they need you have life you have the words of life to give to them and and Christ is all that we need he is our everything he's completely all that we need um so that's that's where this song comes from there's it's it's just been a very special I remember I as I had written the song I I I and everybody had we were we were at the youth meeting at that time and I had just written the song and everybody was actually you know was was very devastated very hurt and I sang the song and people were crying because they they it resonated with their heart it resonated with who they were and and and the struggle that was going on in their lives at that time so this has always just been one of my my favorites and you go [Music] [Music] [Applause] ahead are you lost and lonely have you no desire to fight have you P into a corner and hidden from the light are you depressed and broken and searching for an inner [Music] peace let me tell you how you can find your Souls [Music] release don't fall away from God for you are the love of his he wants you to draw near and never be Tor apart oh he sees you and wants to hold you he needs you and wants to know you so don't P away from for he will not P away from you [Music] friend
