========================================

be here by God's grace uh greet the saints greet you Saints from the Saints back home and from Brother Jim sending us greetings I don't know whose Bible had I'll just set it down is this is this yours brother no okay I'll just say it there don't let him forget it he'll need it so Genesis chapter N9 starting in the uh verse eight I can't remember the last time I was here sorry I missed last week I wanted to come but I was could to see by the back uh I had to be at the home Church be at my post of Duty but uh I'm sure you sure you had a good service last week but uh it must have been what a month or so ago anyhow thank the Lord for getting us through uh the whoop cough you know that that's kind of a strange thing that uh I was battling that for a little bit in September and I just thank the Lord for his healing so if I'd get into a coughing fit my apologies I'm still trying to get over it but by God's grace we're still healed no matter what the symptoms say or anything but his word is true so uh let us start Genesis 9 uh verse 8 and it says and God SP akake unto Noah and to his sons with him saying and I beheld or excuse me and I behold I establish my Covenant with you and with your seed after you and with every living creature that is with you of the fowl of the cattle and of every beast of the Earth with you from all that go out of the Ark to every beast of the earth and I will establish my Covenant with you neither shall All Flesh be cut off anymore By the Waters of a flood neither shall there anymore be a flood to destroy the Earth and God said this is the token of the Covenant which I make between me and you and every living creature that is with you for Perpetual Generations I do set my bow in the cloud and it shall be for a token of a covenant between me and the Earth and it shall come to pass when I bring a cloud over the Earth that the bow shall be seen in the cloud and I will remember my Covenant which is between me and you and every living creature of All Flesh and the waters shall no more become a flood uh To Destroy All Flesh and the bow shall be in the cloud and pay attention to this part it says and the bow shall be in the cloud and I will look upon it this is the Lord speaking and I will look upon it that I may remember the Everlasting Covenant between God and every Liv every living creature of All Flesh that is upon the Earth and God said unto Noah this is the token of the Covenant which I have established between me and All Flesh that is upon the Earth let's look to the Lord in prayer heavenly father as we read this scripture Lord we know that you have set this Covenant uh in Noah's day but Lord we know we have a a different Covenant in in our day but uh but one thing that Rings true is that you always uh you always stay faithful to your Covenant Lord we know that it's man that breaks the the covenants that everyone that you've established but Lord I just thank you so much that we have this this Covenant in this day that that no man uh can make go away no man can erase it no man can make it disappear but Lord You've you've made that Everlasting Covenant with us with the with the uh the sacrifice of the Lord Jesus Christ and we thank you for that oh God for Lord the you are the unchangeable we are the ones that have to come changing unto your ways father we pray that you would be with us as we Minister this morning I pray that something would be said said to be a blessing and a help to my brothers and sisters here father we we just ask for for your spirit to take charge here this morning and take charge over my lips that I would speak what you had once spoken and nothing else father we ask all this and our trust is in you in Jesus Christ's name we pray amen amen may be seated excuse me I'm just going to get right settled right in here so I don't even know why we wear them out because we take them off but we know this you know presentability so we want to present ourselves as uh as a good Steward you know be presentable but uh what I'd like to speak on this morning is a focus upon the right object so we see as we read through Genesis that uh this Covenant uh is left with something that the natural could see we we see that he's talking about the bow the bow is in the sky we know the rainbow is of different colors right but this is this is something that man can look up in the clouds and and we can be in awe of you know because it's beautiful you know uh so we see an array of different colors and the way that it bends you know that's just the way that the natural happening is uh with with light and water droplets but this is something that man can see but as we read into the scripture it's also something that God will look upon so not just something that we could look upon but it's something that he can look upon as well so he's going to remember his promise but we know that every every promise that was broken was not by God but it was it was broken by man man has broken every Covenant throughout the scriptures why because of because of their own lust or they got distracted or because of their own uh greed or whatever it might be because man is a man is full of faults and failures right we're not perfect but we know that god is perfect so uh you know in order to see the rainbow you need like I said you need Water and Light so uh not necessarily rain yeah it's nice to see a rainbow after it rains and the Sun comes out that's generally when you see the rainbow but you don't always need that condition to see a rainbow all you need is is the water droplets and a in a certain amount of light so uh that's the mixture of what a rainbow is is uh uh Light and Water oh my so we know that that Jesus is the light of the world and it's by the the water washing of the water of the word so it's it's by God's power it's it's nothing that man has made man didn't make the rainbow God made the rainbow no matter how creative man could be to uh draw pictures and depict it as best as they can the uh painters have painted it for years they've Tred to get pictures of it you ever take a picture of something it just doesn't justify the situation at that point you just can't capture that Beauty on on a camera you you yeah a Nikon whatever with the best that you can get might take great pictures but it's not going to capture the actual reality of the beauty at that moment it does the best it can but we can never match what God could create amen so uh uh I know how the rainbows formed uh but to me uh we know that it's Water and Light to me it's just a majestic uh thing that happens you know who who can deny its beauty who doesn't run outside and and when somebody sees a rainbow hey come out and look at the rainbow you know because it's a beautiful site you know uh I don't know how many people go to a beach or to a setting just to see a Setting Sun a sunset I love sunsets I love sunrises some people don't wake up early enough to see a sunrise I wake up early enough to see a sunrise and I I'm going to tell people if you're not waking up early enough you're missing something truly beautiful you know but that's just the way that I am you can call me crazy you can call me wimpy or whatever but it's not going to change the fact that I love Sunrise sunsets you know I just love uh what God can set before our eyes right so uh you know a rainbow is a magnificent thing right so but what about a double rainbow that's that's kind of a rarity but it's it's it's also an awesome thing to go out and see but you know just because you see one rainbow and you see a double rainbow it's going to be an infinite amount of of rainbows right uh so it it's going to continue on it's just what we can see that that's all we can see with the naked eye but the more moisture you have and the more sunlight you have uh the more rainbows you're going to have and it's uh just a pretty awesome thing so uh I'm not an artist I'm not a scientist I'm not great with with colors they told me that I'm color blind but I could see the colors just fine you know but uh I I guess I'm I'm more color deficient but what colors I can see and I think I could see them all I just don't know what to call them all you know you kind of get into the into into the violets and in the uh the the what is it fuchsia or fascia I can't remember what it is but I don't know what those colors are I guess because I'm ignorant on those things I know red red white blue yellow and all those other colors the basic colors I could tell you what color it is but uh but again I absolutely love the sunsets I I could see the mauve I could see the rose color I could see see the the yellows the oranges the teals all in the sunset and it's just a beautiful thing I know I'm kind of getting off a little bit but I'm just trying to get a little comfortable so uh but uh I'll see uh getting back on the the double rainbow is uh when you get a double rainbow it it is a reflection of itself in an inverted pattern let see uh if if I remember right when you look at one rainbow if you see the double rainbow the colors are going to going to be in a different order if I remember right so I I could be wrong with that but I'm I'm pretty sure that's the way it goes so but it's a reflection of itself so uh but as I said I love to see those things but it's the representation of of what I enjoy probably the most of that it represents a a covenant between God and man so do we still live in that type of Co in a covenant that was a covenant for Noah but still it's a covenant as far as he won't destroy the Earth Earth with the flood right so again uh bear with me I'm I'm going to read some of this because I can't remember everything uh I know some people don't like when ministers read read the notes or whatever but if that's okay with you I'm just going to read some of it so now a rainbow consists of Water and Light that reflects through the water droplets much like a prism if if you know what a prism is uh light bends as it passes through a convex object a convex object is something that's slightly spherical you know like our our our lens is a a convex uh object it's it's spherical uh such as a a lens or water drop this is called refraction each color that you see has a different wavelength uh hence you hence the layered look okay so red doesn't bend very easily that's why it's at the top uh Violet uh Violet bends very easily and that's why it's a at the bottom because it could Bend more so uh it it's pretty neat of how we just think that we see we take it for granted that we could see but we don't understand why we see we just know that we're able to see kind of much like the scripture we can't explain why we understand certain scriptures and and sometimes it's hard to explain to somebody and they don't see what we see right and so that's where we we can't take our our sight not just our natural natural sight but our spiritual sight we can't take it for granted amen so we just appreciate we we thank the Lord for what he's given us and we thank him for the ability to see so because if we didn't have the the ability to see and I I feel bad for blind people you know deaf people and I I pray that nobody would ever have to go through that but uh they miss out on this on the beauty that we see but uh but they kind of make up for in other areas that they their senses are heightened in other areas right so uh see where we're weak in one area we should be getting strong in in in in other areas amen so that we can contact the Lord excuse me now each of us also has a limit to our bending amen so kind of like the Violet it bends more the red doesn't Bend as easily but same with people we don't bend we don't flex you you could say in the natural you I'm kind of older I don't flex the way that I used to flex and I'm getting a little bit heavier so now I have to hold my breath the time my shoes sometimes you know it's not like when I was a little bit lighter a little bit more flexible things are a little bit more difficult y'all just wait young ones so all I all I got to say is stay flexible keep stretching and and stay as flexible as you can but he will not uh but he did promise that we would bend so much that we wouldn't break see you see the rainbow in the sky it bends so much but it doesn't break right so the same thing with us in our lives God works in our lives we go through trials we go through Temptations we go through hard times but he bends us so much but he has a promise that we won't break right so uh for he is a propitiation of our sins he is the the appeasement of our sins he is our our peace right so we sing that song that he is our peace I like that song but uh but we get into the situations where it seems that that it gets so dark and and too dark that there's there's no way out you know sometimes uh yeah even as a Believer we get into situations where uh you get your mind off of something under the wrong thing and then it seems like you you you've kind of Fallen away and you can't come back you know but there's there's no you can't go so far to where God can't bring you back and and if and a Believer I I truly believe that believer can't go as far because you might be thinking in your mind that there is a sin unto death there is a sin that you can't come back back from and that's blasphemy and I truly believe that a that a a True Believer will not commit blasphemy because the Holy Ghost cannot speak against itself right so there's for a Believer there's there's a spot to where you can't go so far to where God can't bring you back so you might not be you might be in the on the Mountaintop right now but what about when it comes into the time of the valley so we've got to prep ourselves for the times of the valleys we got to prep ourselves for the time of of the hardships and but he is our way maker amen so see the the bow is there uh for God and Mankind as I said that as we read the scripture that he looks upon the bow and we look upon the bow but we so it's uh there for God to look upon it's there for us to look upon you know uh and kind of coming um everybody's looking for something right uh some are looking for better jobs some are just looking for jobs period some are looking for better jobs uh some are looking for better vehicles you know some might like Ford and some might like Chevy but I'm kind of a Toyota guy but uh because I've had Fords and never had a Chevy so I I've said some things about Chevys but uh I can't really say much because I've never had the experience in a Chevy but I have had an experience in a Toyota that is uh better than what I you what used to be my beloved Fords you know but uh but hey some people are just got to get something to get around right so uh I'm not here to float on anything so bear with me on that but my point is is somebody's uh somebody everybody's looking for something so some there might be some looking for husband wife some somebody might be looking for uh just a uh a future husband uh future wife whatever it might be somebody might be looking for uh wrong things somebody might be looking for uh the right things but in the wrong way you know um there was a man in the Bible uh his name was Simeon uh if you would turn with me to Luke Chapter 2 and 25 now see uh he was looking for something he was looking for the Messiah right so uh as we read here in the Luke 2 and 25 it says and behold there was a man in Jerusalem whose name was Simeon and the same man was just and devout waiting for the consolation of Israel and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it wait a second the Holy Ghost was upon him but Jesus was just born so where did the Holy Ghost come from see some people have it in their mind so much that the Holy Ghost is just a new testament thing the Holy Ghost is not just a new testament thing right the Holy Ghost always has been the same yesterday today and forever see the Holy Ghost has always been there the difference is is that when Jesus was ascended on high right so and then the magnification came to where he can indwell in people right so uh the Holy Ghost is not a a new thing as as as we read here that Jesus was just born in the flesh so uh and the Holy Ghost was upon him and it was revealed unto him by the holy ghost that he should not see death before he had seen the Lord's Christ and he came by the spirit into the temple and when the parents brought in the Child Jesus to do for him after the the custom of the law they took him up and then he then took he him that's a tongue twister then took he him up in his arms and blessed God and said Lord now let us thou thy servant depart in peace according to Thy word for mine eyes have seen thy salvation which thou has prepared before the face of all people a light to lighten the Gentiles now see we're the Gentiles so we're we're we're grateful we thank God for for the light to come under the Gentiles see and a light to lighten the Gentiles and the glory of thy People Israel the Covenant when he gave to Noah for the rainbow was for him between him and God and all the creatures in the earth that includes us so John the Baptist was another one let's turn to Matthew uh 11 verse one it says and it came to pass when Jesus had made an end of commanding his 12 disciples he departed then to to teach and to preach in their cities now when John had heard in the prison The Works of of Christ he sent two of his disciples and said unto him art thou uh he that should come or do we look for another see uh John the Baptist being in prison he started having his doubts when he should have known he knew but even even even a believer has a time where they get into a spot of doubt they get into a spot of uh does God really exist even though a True Believer so when you get into that don't think that you're that you're so lost I'm not saying that you'll get there but we pray that we never get into those situations but we always want to stay on the Mountaintop right but when you get into that situation don't lose heart don't think that there's there's no a point of no return for there is a point of return there is don't ever let the devil put that in your mind that you that you can't come to God just because you you thought of something wrong that you misunderstood a scripture somewhere right we don't all have the full understanding you because even in Corinthians uh in Corinthians it's talking about uh uh they they had their arguments about who who could speak in tongues Who had who could prophesy and who was better at this and who was better at that and we see that in in the in the same day of Pentecost when Pentecost came is that they thought they kept saying that the the evidence of the Holy Ghost was speaking in tongues which is the least of the gifts right amen excuse me verse three and but what happens is they get their mind off of God so much that they get lost they just have to find the road map to get back verse three and it says and said unto him art thou uh art thou he that should come or do we look look for another and Jesus answered and said unto them go and show John again those things which ye do hear and see go testify of what I've done for different people go and testify testifying has to do with speaking and showing because the word of God comes with power and demonstration right but sometimes we get into that uh I I can't I can't think of his name right off that right off the bat he was a judge but he was asking if if God be for us where are all the Miracles Gideon so sometimes we get into that if if if God Is A Healer where is my healing if God is my provider where's where's the money that I need you know we just get into those situations just like Gideon said if God before us where are all the Miracles where are all these promises that that the Lord has given but see is our Focus so much on the Miracle or the miracle maker but see we we get so lost because our Focus gets off the miracle maker that we're looking unto men for to do something and see if we have the gifts are are we praying for the gifts to be in the church or or are we saying hey so and so you you need to speak in tongues let's get this going learn a language so you can speak in tongues so people could think you I'm I'm telling you you know just because somebody speaks in tongues doesn't mean that it's a holy ghost because somebody could know another language I I know very little uh Spanish but I'm not able to tell you to to get up and and and say speak sentences in Spanish it's just not in me I could say different words I have an understanding of different words but I can't speak it fluently so if I was up here and the Holy Ghost moved in this service today and I started speaking in tongues I'm telling you that's going to be the Holy Ghost because I don't know I don't know another language fluently but you got to be careful with people who already know a fluent language is it the Holy Spirit or is it something in the flesh see that's where we can't look at carnality but we have to look look at the spiritual things behind it and isn't it something where the instruction is given don't have the high people or the Highly Educated people to make judgment because if those things happen you should have a judge in the church right but it it's not the high people or the high knowledgeable people it's not the best dressed person but it's the the least among the Brethren that is that they're called to to make the Judgment upon that right see it kind of takes the respect out of persons right out of the way amen amen sorry the little Sidetrack there verse five it says the blind receive their sight and the lame walk the lepers are cleansed and the deaf hear the dead are raised up and the poor have the gospel preached preached to them and blessed is he whosoever shall not be offended of me that's the Forgotten beatitude blessed is he who shall not be uh who shall not be offended in me you see that's that's where it lies is do I have the Holy Ghost or do I not when the word comes and it's preached and you you get all prickly inside and and you're resistant to the Holy Ghost the Holy Ghost isn't going to resist the Holy Ghost but the Holy Ghost is going to receive the Holy Ghost right and the things of the Holy Ghost see if you find that you're offended you know the question or people will make the statement uh if I was alive back in Jesus's day I I I would believe Jesus but the way you treat him today is the same way that you would have treated him back in that day right so however you view Christ today is the same way that you would have viewed him then and if you are offended to him you would have been right among the people that crucified him oh my let's turn to John Chapter 19 Verse verse 28 see even looking for Jesus because that's what the bride should be doing the the believer should be looking for Jesus is coming right but even the ones that pierced him are going to have to look upon him because the scripture says every knee every knee shall bow every every mouth shall confess so could you imagine being one of those people that were there on that day of the crucifixion the one shouting crucify him crucify him could you imagine having to be the one one of them and looking Upon Jesus later could you imagine the the feeling and the thoughts and the heartache that they would have once they realize what they did John chapter 28 says after this Jesus knowing that all things were now accomplished that the scripture might be fulfilled saith I thirst now there was a set there was a set a vessel uh of vinegar and they filled a sponged with vinegar and put it upon his up and put it to his mouth when Jesus therefore had received the vinegar he said it is finished and he bowed his head and gave up the ghost the Jews therefore because it was the preparation that the body should not remain upon the cross on the Sabbath day for the Sabbath day was a high day besought pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away then came the soldiers and break the legs of the first and of the other which was crucified with him but when they came to Jesus and saw that he was dead already they break not his legs but one of the soldiers with a spear pierced aside forth withth came there out blood and water and he that saw it bear record and his record is true and he knoweth that he saith and he knoweth that he saith true that you might believe for these things were done that the scripture should be fulfilled a bone of him should shall not be broken and again another scripture saith they shall look on him whom they pierce but see we see that the scripture was fulfilled right so the people knowing what the scripture says and then the situation is there they get to they were able to see what took what just took place and then mindful of the scripture so when we get into our into our wo is me State you know when we get so low just think of the scripture the scripture said this the scripture said this and you start feeling a little bit uh a little bit better a little bit encouraged a little bit more motivated well the scripture said I could be picked up again see the scripture says a righteous man follows seventh times but yet he gets back up right so we we look upon these things but imagine being there in that day when you see the scripture being fulfilled wait they didn't break his legs what did the I remember the scripture said a bone of a bone in his body wouldn't be broken they said that they were crucified one could you imagine the pain the anger anguish the despair that they would feel just looking Upon Jesus on that cross seeing scripture fulfilled and they were apart on the other side I couldn't imagine being in that position but someday they're going to have to look upon that someday they're going to have to face that now see some will look with with gladness where others will they would look with with sorrow and repent see some people might look on on on Christ what I mean by that is some people at that time might have looked upon Christ and saying good that Jew is dead you know he caused so many problems what problems did he cause besides healing people he might have been taking money from doctors he might have been taking money from lawyers but he was setting things in order he was doing Godly things but yet people can't accept the good things and the servant isn't above his master where we would have to do the same amen but some some people will look upon death with gladness some people look on it in sorrow amen do do I don't know if anybody's seen the movie passion but I remember when that movie The Passion uh came out uh with meel with Mel Gibson and uh or uh he directed it but after I I heard stories I I think I saw it on the news I can't remember read it in in newspaper articles but there was there was there were Tales of people leaving the movie theater crying and repenting because some of them realized they were they were screaming because they realized that he did that for me it was my sin that put him on that cross and those people might have never stepped into a church right but just the realization with when they had that Revelation they they realized that was me that I was the reason for that and it happened over 2,000 years ago so how could they how could they put themselves in that kind of in in that situation where that they did that for or he did that for me how could they even relate to something like that because even brother brand talked about and people have a hard time with this when he talked about uh George Washington Abraham Lincoln and and the different ones as Americans the representation was there see people have a hard time with it because they're saying oh he's saying he was back in time that he's making himself an eternal being that's not not what the brother was saying he was saying as an American I had I had representation back as an American when George Washington crossed the Delaware I have representation of and and I have to deal with all the heartache and all the Sorrows of what Americans did I have to take the good with the bad because when people look upon us As Americans they might know some of their history that's what that's what they're going to look upon so if if we had that representation as American citizen back then and that wasn't that far ago they these people realize the representation that they had over 2,000 years ago oh but see when Israel was in the wilderness their focus became uh distracted from God and then they spoke against God right but see people are looking for for healing if if God if God Is A Healer where is my healing and then they get upset because they don't get their healing they're looking at the wrong thing and then they start speaking evil against God saying well God doesn't exist and that's where you get people leaving the church because of some offense not that not that God doesn't exist anymore but something in in their in their life didn't line up something where they have a misconception or a misunderstanding and now they're upset and now they left God left the church and ultimately they leave God and then if you talk to anybody that's left church they end up speaking against God so it's the same thing with Israel right where they where they started performing their own lust and then they uh they started speaking evil against God and then God sent the serpents and then the people were becoming bitten by the serpents right and then there were a lot of people that died because they were bitten by the serpents but what did Moses do the Lord told Moses to raise up that brass serpent so John chapter 3 and verse verse 14 it says and as Moses lifted up The Serpent and the will Wilderness even so must a son of man be lifted up we know this right because we've read the scriptures we have that understanding but that whosoever believeth in him should not perish but have eternal life see it caused them to look and to focus on a certain object it wasn't the object that they were being that was that that gives the salvation but it was the Act of Faith when they focused their eyes upon the serpent and then they were able to be healed and that was according to what God spok Amen but they had to have the they had to now see uh a Christian can't say uh a Christian a true Christian can't make the statement uh I believe it because I see it if I see it I believe it that's a Thomas way out of it that's a doubting Thomas way out of it but a True Believer cannot make that kind of a statement because we walk by faith we see God by faith we don't see God through our carnal understanding so it wasn't if wasn't the brass serpent so much that's that's uh uh that saved the people but it was the Act of Faith when they looked upon it so the same with Christ when we look upon him and when we focus on him that's where salvation lies because he is the actual salvation amen see Focus what is focus when we hear the word focus our our minds to uh we might think of a camera or a telescope or something like that but there are several meanings of the word focus focus is the the center of Interest or activity an act of concentrating interest or activity on something the state or quality of having or producing clear visual definition of a person or their eyes they adapt to the prevailing level of light and become able to see clearly I kind of like that adapt to the prevailing level of light so whatever whatever level you are in Christ Jesus you could still see right because your your sight is going to adapt and you can't live any higher than what you're living what do you mean by that if you're not getting into the word you're not going to live any higher you know we we know brother brandom said you're not going to live any higher than your pastor so if your pastor's not teaching high things which I I believe he he is I believe he does but but the saying is still is you can only live as high as the pastor because if he's teaching false things if he's if he's not teaching ing you the true things if he just leaves out uh the education if he leaves out the whole word you're not going to live any higher right because you're not going to know the light is not revealed to you you're not going to see light not that brother Jesse could give you Revelation but he can introduce the word to help you see a little bit better amen see it's it's it's when we contact the word the Holy Spirit has to come and make it real to us right because the the holy spirit makes it live he quickens it to us but first we have to be able to hear it then we have to be able to believe it amen but God gives the increase he gives the understanding see Focus means pay particular attention to and it also means to concentrate so we all knew the the definition of Focus right so so if if you think of a camera let's look how uh a a camera lens works okay so bear with me for a few minutes if that's all right a camera's lens operates similarly uh to that of our eyes focusing a lens on one object shuts other things out of picture it blurs or obscures the the objects around the subject some photographers work hard to get the right blend of focus and blur to con uh to concentrate on the particular object y' y'all with me there so photographers actually looked for that kind of a ideal situation where they could focus on one thing and everything else is blurred or they blur the one thing to where everything else is in Focus you could do it either way it's it's all what you're focusing on It's all where you want to put your concentration see there are particular details that they try to capture for the viewer to see now see when you focus on something you tend to blur everything else out so but if you uh if you're looking past something then that's going to be blurred the children might like might like this kind of activity you ever see the double finger to where you can put your fingers together and look at past if you look at the wall you'll see a double finger and then you can bend it and it looks like a a a double-ended finger and you can bend it all which which go ahead you don't don't be embarrass you could try it that way you see what I'm talking about but if you focus on the wall it looks like you got a third finger there in the middle but if you focus on your two fingers you see two fingers and I'm seeing two sisters back there but I know that there's only one sister sitting in the back there but it's all where you put your focus of what you see and how clearly you see the object have you ever found yourself focusing on something so much that you're not paying attention to anything else around you you know somebody might be calling your name and and you don't hear your name you ever see a camera on autofocus you might have uh here here's a lens here somewhere you might have a little thread here on on this on this lens you know what it's going to focus on that one little fuzzy that just gets into the way and that it's constant trying to focus on that one little thing the same thing in our lives we we're focusing on that that one we can't get any further because we're Focus trying to focus on that one little sin in our lives or we're not cleaning our leg amen so that autofocus it's on what gets into the way it's what brings us down that gets into the way that where we can't see God clearly so on that autofocus it's whatever Target it finds it blurs the surrounding objects you try to get a clear picture of something but there's there's that one little nuisance object that I was talking about the the the little piece of fuzz you know those pesky little uh distractions see that's a distraction to that autofocus because and then you're getting frust focus on that but that's how we get in our lives I'm tired of focusing on this well you got to clean that there has to be a purging there has to be a cleaning take place before you could take a step further you you could get frustrated with that piece of fuzz all day long but until you wipe that clean until you bring it back under the blood of Jesus Christ you're not going to get any further amen you're not going to see God any clear no matter how hard you try because it's going to come right back to that one little piece so it behooves us if we just clear everything out see when you when you start focusing on on on on one thing other things become neglected you start focusing on the things of the world or symptoms in your life your vision of God becomes blurred see you try to get a clear picture of something but that there's that one little nuisance thing that that just gets in the way right see and then it takes our attention away from what's really important like I was talking about the tongues people start focusing on tongues that's not the focus people start focusing on healing that's not the focus these are minimal things but they they want to concentrate on the on the Healer and and I like how that situation when that young girl that blind girl came to brother Brandon she was looking for the healer is you the Healer he said no I'm not the Healer but Jesus Christ is the Healer now see people could say what I what they want to but I really appreciate how he put the Focus On Christ he took it completely off of him and he put it on Christ where do we stand in this day to where we're putting focus on men more than we are of God that ought not to be so our Focus ought to be clear Mark 16 go ye out into the world and preach the gospel amen not preach other men's ideology but go out into the world and preach the gospel that should be our Focus amen see when we get into those situations where we feel that we're all down we feel like kabad we know what kabad means right the glory of the Lord is departed so and then we just get further and further whoa was me who nobody cares about me yes somebody does care about you you just haven't read Stout you haven't cleaned your you haven't cleaned your lens you haven't cleaned to to reach the focal point your focal point got diverted to something else you might say your camera fell down to the ground it's time to pick it up and clean it off amen so you might find yourself calling upon God but he doesn't answer kind of like those those prophets with Elijah right and kind of Elijah was kind of poking fun are they on holiday you know are they on vacation call out louder he might hear you and he was kind of poking fun he was kind of mocking them right but sometimes we feel like that God where are you you know God are you on holiday so you won't oh my it depends on what you're looking at amen so you've got to you've got to look at the word at the right angle so to see the big picture right so here here's a statement uh you've got to look at it at the right angle so it becomes clearer to you see to see a rainbow see anybody can look out and see the rainbow but there's there's a certain way that you see a rainbow what you mean there there's a rule to that yep there there's a rule to that too I'm so tired of rules well that's what we live by yeah so that's just the way things are but anyhow to see a rainbow in the sky the sun has to be at a 42 degree angle or less so we have you have to look at the word at the right angle see you won't see truth if you're not looking at it correctly see light goes through the lens at getting back to the the the to the lens and and the focusing here the light goes through the lens as parallel light rays and remember how the light rays they they Bend you know uh as you see with the rainbow of of the different colors and how each one bends see these Rays uh uh they Bend at a certain angle and these Rays converge they come together to a single point Point called a focal point through all of this that's how you could see a huge object like a mountain see if if you were to stand right there real close to a mountain and you just look through uh a paper towel roll you know cardboard roll you're not going to get to see the whole thing right but if you have if you have a lens set in a certain way you're going to be able to see what's in front of you because it it bends the light and it makes it in a way that you could see a bigger image in a smaller way this is right here this is what brings God into Focus something so big so magnificent and yet we still can't explain them all because God Is So vast this is this is just a a minor part as men were moved by the Holy Ghost they they wrote it down for us you know the inspiration of the Holy Spirit see uh it brings big things into perspective the right amount of light exposure makes a clearer makes a clear Sharper Image the right amount of light exposure the more the more time that we spend with God the more time we read into the word and pray the sharper the image of God comes the light amen the more you abide in the vine the better your perspective the more you see God clearly when the right mixture and exposure to light is achieved All Things become clear it has to be the right atmosphere uh couple more things and uh just bear with me so focal length I'm not a camera expert by any means it's just I I did some research I'm not a scholar I just looked at at some things and I I thought it was pretty neat how a camera lens works because our eye our Natural Eye Works in a very similar way to a camera lens that I think that's how they developed it knowing how the the eye and the pupil and all that works uh so they were able to De develop something and you know through all their their work and and all their knowledge all their all their intellect they still can't make life they can clone they can they can pervert things they can copy things but they cannot create life they're still trying to find that that one little thing to create life they they just can't do it yet anyways but they're they're working hard at it I don't know if they'll ever get there I'm not a prophit to say they'll never do that I I don't know vocal length so we have focal point we have focal length focal length plays a huge part in viewing the object clearly focus is always on a certain distance from the sensor this is talking about the inner workings of of the camera uh the further you are away from God the less you see him as he as he is right so you don't see him moving in your life then you begin to wonder if he even exists but see when you're looking at a big object like the mountain it depends on the length of it and the capability of that lens see it's the capability of the vessel it's not the capability of God it's a capability of the vessel of what they are able to see the focal length but the light uh bends to bring things more into Focus it's all on on angles and light admission light transmission of what the the lens of how much light the lens allows to come in and it is kind of like a mirror and it's also inverted so if you if you didn't have the the inversion you would see everything upside down and that's what they used to see in the cameras until they got things figured out they would actually see people upside down when they look through the lens so knowing that does he not leave the 99 sheep just for the one no amen so God has uh uh a different perspective than what we have you know amen so as we read about uh uh focal point focal length you know the uh I'd already said this but I don't want to get redundant I don't want to be repetitive you know because in the time just ticks and then you're going to fall asleep on me you heard this already you know how it goes so on the other other other end of the spectrum the closer you are to God the clearer he becomes right so you've got to abide in the vine so you and the scripture said is if you abide in me I will abide in you so you remember that story about the little boy he was going to the Sunday school teacher to the pastor and and and the different ones into the church into the church have you ever seen God no I've never seen God and then he's just a lowly old I can't remember if he was a farmer but he was a fisherman they were out on a boat it was an older older gentleman know but just a different perspective I that this man had from all the I don't care what everybody else is saying out in the world it's all on how you view Christ it's all on how you view it's all what you're looking at but the man said I see I see God everywhere see it's all in the perspective of the viewer if you can't see God I get to ask and open your eyes youo I could say that uh is as as as harsh as I could well you need to just open your eyes do see God but it's up to God to give you the Revelation I can't make you see something I I was telling uh we we were talking about scripture uh at work one day and this guy was was arguing with me about uh you know uh because I knew somebody uh that had long hair and we said something about it and uh they said it doesn't say anything in the scripture about men having long hair I said yes it does and uh and I couldn't remember because I was a new believer at the time and I asked this this brother there uh he was a Baptist Minister said do you remember where the scripture talks about the hair and he knew where he knew right where it was said oh that's First Corinthians 11 so I showed it to the guy and I had him read it for himself he says oh that's that's talking about you know dressing like a woman and different things like that are you blind you just read it but it's not me that can give him the understanding even though he read it with his own eyes he still didn't have the understanding of it and it's just I said what do you have a and I I was wrong in my spirit because I what do you have a third grade reading education you know and and I shouldn't have been like that but I like I said I was still a new convert a new believer and I just didn't know so that's where we are blessed are our eyes that we can see blessed are our ears that we could hear and blessed is our understanding that we're not offended in him but we could come to him and that we could have that uh that he gives us that understanding see amen I'm just going to look for a spot to kind of close here excuse me ever have people just put you know deliberately put things in your way to try to make you stumble people set road blocks in our ways try to get us to slow down because people are watching us they they deliberately try to put situations in our lives to to get us to uh cuss or get angry or uh what's that word that I'm looking for re renounce or Den renounce Christ you know that that's what they try to do people set roadblocks at our way you know but that's why we press toward the mark of the High Calling we push forward we continue on because people are going to set that we're going to have roadblocks in our lives but we can't focus on that roadblock we have to focus past beyond that roadblock to look to to look keep Christ in view amen so like I was saying earlier when people are sick they they they want to look toward healing but that's that's just the natural way of man we we want to look toward healing so then they're looking for a doctor they're looking for something else there was a king uh I want to say it was ahaziah uh when he became sick he told his his uh his guards or would I guess you could say his peasants but uh he he sent somebody somebody in the court to to go uh seek other gods you know hey call upon such and such God and and see if I can have healing but I think it was Elijah uh is it he said he rebuked him said is there not a God in Israel so why are you looking somewhere else are we not belies so why do we look to some other entity or try to look at some other deity when we know the one and true deity see that's that's the problem is uh no wonder the scripture says seek ye first the kingdom of heaven and all these things shall be added unto you but if you first look to look to doctors you're look to uh incense and and uh seances and different things you get out the Ouija board and you're asking the spirits hey can I be healed and you know that that's a farce you don't want to get into those you don't want to get into dive into the evil stuff trust me stay out of the evil realm look unto God the author and finish of our faith and the one that that promised that said that he is the Healer of all of our diseases amen so I know he's more than capable to to heal us of of our diseases but like I said people focus so much on on on on healing than the Healer see when people are are financially broke they're trying to look for look they're trying to look for a handout instead of looking to Jehovah G you know Jehovah jyra he is the provider see when people need wisdom they they look to education they look to to different things uh other than God see the scripture says if any man lack wisdom go ask your neighbor no go ask the college professor he might help you in some things but if any man lack Wisdom ask of God Amen for that's where the wisdom wisdom lies see people look under the family and they they have a sense of belonging but they uh but they neglect the very father of us all you know uh I better get off of that uh but we're we're focused too much whether we're in a message church we we're we're focused uh so much on on uh being separated from from other churches that we want to be we want to be different you know we don't want to be denominational we don't want to be those things but we're so focused that I go to a message church I'm not saying that that this group does that but uh there are people out there well I go to a message church and it's just the same thing that brother brandom said when he asked are you a Christian well I'm a Baptist well I'm a Methodist that's not the question that was asked are you a Christian you know we have enough of that out in the world well I'm a message believer well how about just I'm a Believer in Christ because ultimately and and and brother Jesse's going to smack me for for getting into this but the message ultimately is Jesus Christ and I believe your p Pastor believes that same thing the message is Christ the message isn't one man the message isn't the 1500 sermons it's what's contained in all the those sermons it's what is preached it's not in healing it's not in tongues it's not in Prophecy But ultimately it comes down to Christ that's who that's the Gift Giver to make all those things possible to show that there is a God that's what the five-fold ministry is here for right to to show us to teach us all those different offices for the perfecting of the Saints that's what each one of us is forth because we're all apt to teach or we should be apt to teach and we all should be testifying right oh my you know something that I I like to say is you know Mark 16 go ye out into the world and preach the gospel use words if necessary I don't want to add to the word I don't want to take away but sometimes just by the life that we live will see well why why do they wear dresses why do they why don't you cut your hair these people are different there's just something different here and it makes people inquisitive that it makes people ask questions of uh why do you do such and such but just so you know I'm sure you know this already people will poke fun people will criticize and why what does what does anybody doing good what harm are they doing it's because they can't accept it I guess I I don't know why people come so hard against not just a message believer but a believer in in general you see we're going to have to go through the persecution but stand strong through that through those storms amen so so it's not just saying that we go to a message church but I am a believer I go to church I go and I go worship I go hear the word of God oh you think that's fun it may not be fun but it's what I need CU people want to all they want to do is go have fun there there was a uh there was a song years ago not that I want you to go listen to it stay away from it just trust me on this okay young ones trust me I've heard the song many times you've probably heard it in the story but stay away from it but the song goes Girls Just Want to Have Fun and that's pretty much what this day and age is is it's all about having fun you know because we need an entertain here we need an entertainment there I need a TV here to entertainment you're not even watching it well but I like the noise I like I just need something I need to hear the talk show what do you need to hear a talk show for they're talking about the same thing 24 hours seven days a week and it's redundant and it's a how can you listen to that all the time you know I used to look at the news I don't even I don't even like to look at the news anymore I I used to watch different things you know different headlines that would come up and it's just so depressing when you see it all the time it's well Democrats are doing this Republicans are doing this uh these people are doing this these people are doing that guns and First Amendment rights second amendment rights what about the Fourth Amendment rights what about the the freedom of religion but people are trying to take that one away too but nobody's nobody's raising up against that one oh my see when our rights start getting take it away we get a little get a little sticky we get a little defensive I'm a Christian first then I'm an American it it was hard for me to say that it was hard for I just had this realization I just had that thought come to me just a few weeks ago I was preaching out in Indiana and uh just that thought came to me because I like the flag I like my rights but I'm a Christian first Christ should be coming first in our Liv right everybody doing okay good all right uh Acts chapter 3 verse 11 it says and as the lame man which was healed held Peter and John all the people ran together unto them in the in the porch that is called Solomon's greatly wondering and when Peter saw it he answered unto the people ye men of Israel why Marvel ye at this or why look ye so earnestly on us as though by our own by our own power or Holiness we had made this man to walk see even they are saying why are you looking on us that we had this power but I like how they give the glory to God in this situation amen was it a marvelous thing was it a miracle absolutely it was a miracle but it wasn't by their own Accord verse 13 it says the god of Abraham and of Isaac and of Jacob the god of our fathers hath glorified his son Jesus whom ye delivered up and denied him in the presence of pilate when he was determined to let him go but ye denied the Holy One and the just and desired a murderer to be granted unto you see there hasn't been much that's changed people are looking for evil more than they are looking for good because evil is more entertaining e evil evil seems to be a little bit uh more fun know I don't want to abide by these rules but even evil has to abide by certain rules yep I I get on that a lot because I know kids I know kids I know people even adults they don't like rules they don't like so many rules but if we didn't have any rules how would we be a to operate and verse 15 and killed the Prince of Life whom God hath raised from the dead whereof we Are Witnesses and his name through faith in his name hath made this man strong whom ye see and know yay the faith which is by him hath given him this perfect soundness in the presence of you all the faith the Faith by him hath given him this perfect soundness like I said A True Believer can't say seeing is believing because seeing with your own eyes it could be uh it could be deceiving very much so if if you don't believe me go see an Illusionist sometime you know they used to be called magicians I guess they're they're using the word illusionists now so we saw one you know uh the hand is quicker than the eye so somebody can take something you know you see those people with those I can't even remember I don't even know what you call that thing keep your eye on this one keep your eye on this one then they can trade and you don't even know it you know so that you can't always believe what the natural eye sees for we walk by faith right and just a couple more we could have the musicians come see that that was looking upon men for something the people looked upon uh Peter and John because of the The Marvelous act that they had done but we know we just read that it wasn't them it wasn't of their power it wasn't of their own accord and that's that's what people get so distracted with as they're they're looking at at man because he might have done something marvelous you know like we said the the scripture is written or uh written by men as they were moved by the Holy Ghost not that they were scholarly uh but they had the ability to write as they were moved by the holy spirit so uh you can't say this is one man's writings because it's of many people it's of many men but they're saying the same thing why I could show you countless contradictions in the Bible you can't see a rainbow unless it's 42 unless the sun is at a 42 degree angle or less it's all in the angle that you could see it's all in what you're looking at and how you're looking at it if you're looking at it with doubt and dis unbelief you're not going to see it you're just going to read you're going to read the words like that man read read in First Corinthians 11 and he didn't have the understanding amen so but what we what's the bride to be doing the bride is to be looking for his coming we're supposed to be Focus F on him we're supposed to be focused of getting ourselves ready because that's Revelations the bride ha made herself ready and ready for what to be put on display so everybody could see the beautiful gown or or whatnot and see how wonderful life that we live no it's getting ready for his coming being pure in heart pure in mind you know we can't do that without the scripture we can't do that without the Holy Spirit if you would stand your feet I'm just going to read a couple scriptures uh I had a quote here but it's going to take a while and I don't I don't want you I think I you I think you get the point of what I was making so you know what is that Ecclesiastes much study makes the the flesh uh as a weariness to the flesh so I don't want to make you weary in your flesh because we got an evening service I'm going to cover the second I'm just kidding but depend on on on the Lord's will what we cover this evening I still don't know yet but uh Hebrews chapter 9 and verse 27 it says and as it is appointed unto men once to die but after this the Judgment so Christ was once offered to Bear the sins of many and unto them that look for him shall he appear the second time without sin unto salvation uh Philippians 3:20 says for our conversation is in heaven from whence also we look for the Savior the Lord Jesus Christ we're not looking for him to come up out of the ground because he's already risen right and the wonderful thing about that is that you know there was no God like him there there was nobody that died like him because the the grave that he was that he was buried in was a borrowed grave it was a temporary one he didn't plan on being there very long amen and you know the other thing about that grave I think I might have said this here before but the other thing about that grave as it was never a man l in see it had to be a pure spot amen so just just the wonderful I'm going to make up a new word the wonderfulness of Our Lord I don't know if that's a word or not but we're going to use it just the wonderfulness of our Lord and savior amen there so many different things that happen with him with Christ uh just in his life being on this Earth and In the Flesh just far passes everybody else you know there's there's nobody like him second Peter chapter 3 and verse 13 it says nevertheless we according to his promise look for new heavens and a new Earth wherein dwelleth righteousness where wherefore beloved seeing that ye look for such things be diligent that you may be found of him in peace without spot and blameless so you might have thought it was just me talking about this that we need to focus on him and look upon him but it says it several times in the scripture so uh let every let every word be established by two or three Witnesses well we just read three right so that's the testimony of true witness is that we had two three Witnesses right there saying the same thing and one more time or one more scripture excuse me two more is that okay I'm I'm greedy with the scripture so 2 Corinthians 4:18 it says why we look not at the things which are seen But at the things which are not seen for the things which are seen are temporal but the things which are not seen are Eternal because we don't see we can't see God because he's a spirit we can't can't see Spirit unless we're blessed you know uh like Elijah uh what was this servant's name gesi thank you uh even Elisha said hey open the Lord yeah he said unto the Lord open his eyes that he might see that and then he saw that there was more for them than there for those two than there was for the the whole Army right so unless we're able to see something like that we can't see God so unless he blesses us with with being able to see and one morning Colossians 3:2 remember I was talking about focusing focus on the right object it says set your affection on things above not on things on the earth let's bow our heads most gracious Heavenly Father we thank you for the day that you've given us we appreciate uh the the word that uh has come forth today we we thank you for the privilege to come to speak to my brothers and sisters Lord uh father I just pray that something would be said today that could help somebody through their struggles through their trials whatever they're going through I just pray that it would be a blessing and a help uh to my brothers and sisters father as this word was brought forth today I pray that it would take a stronghold uh in their hearts that it would be there uh to help them through their times of troubles oh God and uh even up on the mountain Lord sometimes we we think that we always need to be on the mountain but there are times and a hard time on the mountain because then we get complacent and then uh we we think that we don't need corrected uh Pride T tends to come when we're up on the mountain so long so Lord no wonder Peter said counted as gold the the fiery trials that we go through and uh Lord I just thank you for what you have coming our way and help us to have the understanding that things happen for a reason uh you might be trying to get us into a certain spot and uh Lord may we not be uh found fighting against a holy spirit but Lord may we open our eyes and open our ears that we could hear what the spirit sayith unto us oh god father may we be obedient unto your word may we be obedient to your spirit we love you we appreciate you oh God and uh just pray as we come here this evening to come and Minister your word one more time we just pray that the hearts would be made ready and uh and ready for worship Lord we appreciate your loving kindness and your grace the patience that you have for us and we just pray that you would uh give us the heart that we would have a forgiving heart and uh as we expect forgiveness that help us to uh be a forgiver also not just forgiven but also a forgiver lord just pray that you'd be in our hearts and in our minds that you would uh take away the the evil thoughts that might be plaguing us day to day Lord I know the struggles that we have for we know that the the the the strong battles in the mind so Lord we pray that you would help us in our minds that our thoughts would be that we would have pure thoughts oh God Lord that uh not so much be far from us that we would have evil thoughts when we look upon uh individuals Lord maybe May may they not be of malice may they not be of Envy but Lord may they be of compassion and love and uh to extend so much to to preach the gospel to them Lord father just pray that you would give us that that unction of the Holy Spirit to know what you want us to do father we ask all this in your precious name our Lord Jesus Christ help us to focus on the right object help us to focus on you and not be distracted by the things of the world the lust of the the eyes and the and the pride of life and the uh lust of the flesh Lord just pray that you would help us and guide us give us wisdom where we lack it oh God again we ask all this in your blessed name our Lord Jesus Christ amen and amen now you know you're going to have to help me out with the singing
