[15:58] Jesus praise the Lord Amen hallelujah
[16:06] let's take our Bibles here tonight by
[16:07] the grace of the Lord praise God
[16:09] like to look at this thought tonight as
[16:12] we had planned to look at the twelve New
[16:15] Testament mysteries so we'll start there
[16:18] by the grace of the Lord and I'd like to
[16:23] start with a little different scripture
[16:26] let's go to John 15:15 I like to start
[16:28] with this scripture tonight it's kind of
[16:31] the the background of what we're trying
[16:34] to look at here so John 15:15 like to
[16:42] greet everyone in the name of the Lord
[16:44] Jesus and all of our Saints with us
[16:46] today and our visitors we're so happy to
[16:51] have them by God's grace and I just
[16:55] posted it to Facebook that we're
[16:57] preaching this so hopefully there'll be
[16:58] a link on there hopefully somebody won't
[16:59] go on that link if not maybe later but
[17:03] we're so thankful for what God has done
[17:06] and we just got to get it out I just
[17:08] want to share with somebody who's never
[17:09] heard of before amen
[17:10] hallelujah and I know these mysteries
[17:13] have changed my life not just
[17:16] intellectually but literally changed my
[17:19] life change my heart changed my desires
[17:22] change the whole course of my life amen
[17:24] these mysteries that have been revealed
[17:26] by the grace of the Lord so John 15:15
[17:30] and this is kind of what my first point
[17:34] is going to be but as you'll see the
[17:37] secrets are revealed Jesus's secrets are
[17:39] revealed to his friends and that's
[17:43] that's the hole that says I was studying
[17:44] and preparing and prayer and studying
[17:46] that's the thought that came to me is
[17:48] that if we want to be Jesus's friends
[17:50] then we have to know his secrets right
[17:52] we want to know his secrets we want to
[17:54] know what's hidden to the loss we want
[17:57] to know we want to know we don't want to
[17:58] be lost we don't want to be strangers we
[18:00] want to be his friends and his friends
[18:02] he tells his friends everything that he
[18:04] does amen all right so
[18:08] 15:15 let's read that together I know
[18:11] it's a big long one but we can handle it
[18:13] let's Reena on three one two three
[18:15] henceforth I call you not servants for
[18:19] the servant knoweth not what his Lord
[18:21] doeth but I have called you friends for
[18:24] all things that I have heard of my
[18:26] father I have made known unto you let's
[18:30] have one more word of Prayer if you ever
[18:31] need on your heart just make a known
[18:32] into God here tonight father in heaven

[18:37] hearts to you or looking Lord as we
[18:38] heard this morning Lord we're looking to
[18:40] Jesus Christ all of our eyes are on the
[18:42] banner of love of Jesus Christ
[18:44] hallelujah
[18:45] we're one army marching Lord marching to
[18:49] the skies Lord but before we take that
[18:51] heavenly flight Lord this army of God

[19:11] of our hearts just let your Holy Ghost

[19:25] Lord so we like to welcome everybody
[19:30] here again we're happy to have everybody
[19:33] here by the grace of the Lord and this
[19:35] whole month we wanted to take some time
[19:38] and share our core beliefs our
[19:40] foundational beliefs that are straight
[19:42] out of the Bible by the grace of the
[19:44] Lord so we welcome you in the name of
[19:46] Jesus we sent out 2,500 of these and so
[19:50] far we've had two responses so that's
[19:52] good
[19:52] Lisa B's had some responses I'm I'm
[19:55] happy you know the Bible says few there
[19:58] be that find it so you know we know
[20:00] there's gonna be less and less as we go
[20:01] on but that's good I don't want to be
[20:03] discouraged by that I want to be
[20:04] encouraged I want to keep fishing I want
[20:06] to keep trying to win souls by the grace
[20:07] of the Lord so we sent the pillar of
[20:10] fire post cards out and we're grateful
[20:14] for the response we have we heard we
[20:16] have heard from amen so tonight you know
[20:19] as planned we're in look at the 12 New
[20:21] Testament mysteries
[20:22] by the grace of the Lord and then next
[20:25] week we'll look at the book of
[20:26] Revelation unveiled we'll just hit the
[20:29] highlights of the revelation next week
[20:31] by the grace of the Lord I've been
[20:33] preaching I think I'm at part 79 on the
[20:36] revelation series here at the church so
[20:37] we've been preaching a lot of sermons on
[20:39] that but I want to hit the highlights
[20:41] for those who've never heard it before
[20:43] by God's grace so we appreciate
[20:46] everybody again being here and
[20:47] supporting this let's start with these
[20:49] twelve New Testament mysteries but I
[20:51] want to start with that thought about
[20:55] the mysteries and Jesus rejoiced in the
[20:59] mysteries of God being hidden
[21:01] Jesus was rejoicing about that he wasn't
[21:04] sad about that he wasn't upset about it
[21:07] Oh some people don't see it like like
[21:09] others do that that's how we would feel
[21:11] and our human compassion but Jesus had
[21:14] the mind of God right and he rejoiced
[21:17] and he's rejoice that God hid it from
[21:20] the wise and the prudent but he revealed
[21:23] it to humble little children humble
[21:25] little children so at school and I was
[21:29] preaching on the mysteries to like our
[21:32] sixty kids there I said you know God
[21:35] likes a nice game of hide-and-seek
[21:36] coming I said how many children know
[21:37] that how many who likes I didn't seek
[21:39] out there's any of the kids like I
[21:40] didn't seek out there yeah God likes
[21:43] hide-and-seek God hides himself and then
[21:46] he wants us to come seek Him he hides
[21:49] himself and then he whispers and he
[21:50] shouts however he gets ahold of you and
[21:52] he draws you to himself because the
[21:55] Bible says the glory of God to conceal a
[21:58] thing but it's the honor of kings the
[22:02] bestir spent so god is the one who
[22:04] really likes hide and seek the best of
[22:06] all amen
[22:07] and I'm glad to seek Him praise the Lord
[22:09] I want to seek him and find him amen
[22:11] but remember Jesus said this he was
[22:14] speaking of course to his disciples his
[22:16] seventy that came back they were
[22:18] rejoicing oh we've got power to cast out
[22:19] demons and and Jesus said
[22:21] notwithstanding in this rejoice not that
[22:24] the spirits are subject unto you just
[22:26] don't get excited about being able to
[22:27] have some power over demon but rather
[22:30] rejoice because your names are written
[22:33] in heaven
[22:34] hey rejoice that God has recognized you
[22:38] as a true son or daughter of God that's
[22:41] what we need to get excited about is
[22:42] that God knows about you me at you and I
[22:44] in heaven a then and that we're accepted
[22:47] in the beloved praise God that's
[22:48] something more to get excited about than
[22:50] just having power temporary power here
[22:53] on earth in that hour Jesus rejoice in
[22:57] his spirit and said now remember he was
[22:59] a man of sorrows but here's one time he
[23:00] got excited he rejoiced and said I thank
[23:03] thee Lord O Father Lord of Heaven and
[23:05] Earth thou has hid these things from the
[23:08] wise and prudent and has to reveal them
[23:11] unto babes even so father for seemed
[23:13] good in thy sight in other words Jesus
[23:15] was saying Lord thank you that you saved
[23:19] these wonderful blessings and these
[23:20] powerful revelations for those who
[23:23] really want it amen and you're not gonna
[23:26] just you know cast your pearls before
[23:27] swine right he wasn't gonna do that
[23:31] Thank You Lord that only the people that
[23:34] really want to receive it will receive
[23:37] it amen that's what he was rejoicing
[23:40] over Lord you you're gonna you're gonna
[23:42] meet every person's need who's really
[23:44] hungry for you then you won't you won't
[23:46] lose one all those who want to know God
[23:48] can know God amen and Jesus rejoiced in
[23:52] that he said thank the Lord that you've
[23:54] revealed it unto these humble little
[23:56] followers amen
[23:59] now this is this is what struck me as I
[24:01] was preparing I believe I was studying a
[24:03] lot on this on Friday night Jesus uses
[24:07] the illustration of friendship to
[24:09] explain who knows the mysteries I hope
[24:13] this helps you now some churches know
[24:15] the mystery some
[24:15] don't but the churches that know the
[24:18] mysteries they're the Friends of God
[24:20] amen and we're not you know we're not
[24:23] trying to exalt others above but we have
[24:25] to look at a reality we had look at the
[24:27] the reality of it who really wants to
[24:29] know Jesus and know all about him those
[24:31] are the true Friends of God those who
[24:34] just want well I just want I just don't
[24:37] wanna go to hell I do want to be famous
[24:39] I want money I want popularity I'll go
[24:41] to God for that those aren't really
[24:43] Jesus's friends those real friends of
[24:46] Jesus or who are willing to take the
[24:48] good and the bad the blessings and the
[24:51] corrections they just want all of Jesus
[24:54] amen and they don't mind me and a
[24:56] partaker of his sufferings either amen
[24:59] because I want to know him in the powers
[25:01] resurrection and also want to be a
[25:03] partaker of his sufferings praise God so
[25:06] I can appreciate how he suffered in
[25:08] order to rule and reign over this
[25:09] universe amen
[25:11] but this is the illustration uses
[25:13] friendship because greater love then no
[25:16] no man I'm sorry hath no man than this
[25:19] that a man lay down his life for his
[25:21] friends ye are my friends and there's
[25:24] conditions if you want to be a friend of
[25:26] God you've got to meet the conditions if
[25:28] you do whatsoever I command see so if
[25:33] someone's not willing to to obey the
[25:35] Word of God they cannot be a friend of
[25:37] God they've got to obey the word and
[25:39] they've got to obey all the Word of God
[25:41] amen this Holy Word so see friendship is
[25:45] based upon conditions I can't I can't
[25:49] say I'm your friend if I talk evil of
[25:51] you or if I uh if I trash your car if I
[25:55] trash your home or if I trash your name
[25:58] you can't really consider me a friend
[25:59] but if I respect you and I try to do
[26:03] what you asked me to do then you can
[26:04] call me a friend and that's how it is
[26:06] with Jesus we've got to do what Jesus
[26:08] commands us and then we're called the
[26:11] Friends of God they meant now of course
[26:13] Jesus already knows who his friends are
[26:15] going to be right as we said earlier he
[26:17] knows the chosen seed he knows all those
[26:20] he has for known and then he's called
[26:22] them predestinated them and glorified
[26:24] them already so we know it's a finished
[26:26] work
[26:28] in this in this time-space continuum
[26:30] here we don't know for sure so God gives
[26:33] us this time to show and prove to
[26:35] everybody which side were on and I want
[26:38] to be on the side of I'm Jesus's friend
[26:40] hallelujah I'm gonna do whatsoever he
[26:42] commands and here's our text for tonight
[26:45] he said I'm not calling you servants
[26:46] anymore
[26:47] because a servant doesn't know what is
[26:49] Lord doeth but I've called you friends
[26:51] for all things that I've heard of my
[26:53] father I have made known unto you and
[26:55] that in that encouragement today all
[26:57] that God wants you to know you're
[26:59] supposed to know he's gonna let you know
[27:02] everything he wants to happen and go on
[27:05] he's not gonna hide anything from you
[27:06] you have full access to all of God's
[27:09] mind
[27:09] amen all God wants you to have you can
[27:12] have it because you're a friend of God
[27:14] oh that's beautiful
[27:17] jesus said search the Scriptures for in
[27:19] them you think you have eternal life and
[27:21] they are they which testify of me and
[27:24] look but here's here's the sad part with
[27:27] those religious Pharisees he said but
[27:29] you will not come to me in other words
[27:31] you will not be my friend that you might
[27:34] have life so we've got to come to Jesus
[27:36] we've got to come to the word if we want
[27:39] life amen Jesus invited of course come
[27:42] unto me all ye that Labour and are heavy
[27:43] laden and I will give you rest did the
[27:46] Pharisees ever come and say I'm burdened
[27:47] with all these laws and regulations and
[27:50] legalism did they ever do that no they
[27:53] never got tired of that they never got
[27:54] tired of the sin they never got tired of
[27:57] the hypocrisy but you and I did you and
[28:00] I got tired of all burdens of our own
[28:03] sin so he came to Jesus and he gave us a
[28:06] light burden amen he took away all of
[28:09] our burden and gave us a light burn our
[28:11] sin burden and he gave us a burden to
[28:13] minister for Jesus amen
[28:15] he said learn of me see you but in order
[28:19] to learn of Jesus in order to be Jesus
[28:20] friend you got to realize he's meek
[28:22] he's lowly and then you find rest so if
[28:26] if we're gonna learn from a humble one
[28:28] we've got to humble ourselves just like
[28:31] brother Branham said or just like we
[28:32] know any it's fact if you go to any
[28:35] classroom if you don't respect that
[28:36] teacher you're not gonna learn anything
[28:37] from them because you think you already
[28:40] know more about it than they do
[28:41] and that's how Jesus is you got to come
[28:44] humble you got to come and say I can
[28:46] learn today there's things I need to
[28:47] work on my life needs work I need more
[28:51] of God's grace I need more of God's love
[28:53] and we got to come a humble like that
[28:54] and not act like we know everything
[28:56] about God in the Bible we got to come
[28:59] home oh by the grace of the Lord Jesus
[29:01] said as many as I love I rebuke and
[29:03] chasten be zealous therefore repent
[29:05] behold I stand at the door and I'm
[29:07] knocking he's so gracious he says come
[29:09] to me but then he says I'm gonna come to
[29:11] your door knock isn't that isn't that
[29:13] the the best friend you could ever ask
[29:15] for
[29:16] he invites you to come but if you don't
[29:17] come he'll come to your door and he'll
[29:19] say how you get can I come in
[29:20] can I be your friend can I come eat with
[29:23] you can I come teach you can I come
[29:26] fellowship with you what a friend we
[29:28] have in Jesus and if any man hear my
[29:31] voice and open the door I'll come to him
[29:33] and he what's up with him and he with me
[29:34] Oh glory and member the Lord said shall
[29:38] I hide from Abraham that thing which I
[29:40] do and we know did God hide anything
[29:43] from Abraham no he revealed everything
[29:45] to Abraham God said for I know him that
[29:49] he will command his children in his
[29:50] household after him and they shall keep
[29:52] the way of the Lord to do justice and
[29:55] judgment so God is not gonna hide
[29:58] anything from those who are his friends
[30:00] he's gonna let them know what he's doing
[30:02] and I love this the secrets of God
[30:08] belong unto the Lord our God but those
[30:11] which are revealed belong to us and to
[30:14] our children forever that we may do all
[30:16] the words of this law in that beautiful
[30:18] church I have seven children I might not
[30:21] have much inheritance money to give to
[30:23] them but one thing I have to give to
[30:26] them is the will of God amen because
[30:29] they but the secrets of God the will of
[30:31] God belong to me and guess who else they
[30:33] belong to my children that's what the
[30:36] Bible says if I can't give them anything
[30:38] else one thing I can give them is the
[30:41] will of God the revelations of God and I
[30:43] can say these are the ways of God walk
[30:46] in them amen
[30:49] so the whole point and this is the whole
[30:51] point of this sermon today why why are
[30:54] the mysteries so important that you
[30:55] they do all the will of God that that's
[31:00] why the mysteries are so important why
[31:01] do you preach all mysteries why do you
[31:03] care about mysteries the mysteries are
[31:04] important because our Lord my friend
[31:07] tells me what he wants me to do and I'm
[31:10] gonna do it because I'm his friend and I
[31:13] care what my friend my lord my ruler my
[31:16] Creator I care what he thinks and I want
[31:18] to be his friend that's why the
[31:21] mysteries are so important so you can be
[31:23] a true friend to Christ remember Abraham
[31:27] the Bible said believe God and he was
[31:29] called the friend of God so if we are
[31:33] God's friend we've got to be like
[31:34] Abraham we've got to do all the will of
[31:36] God keep all the will of God that makes
[31:39] us the friend of God amen now and just
[31:43] remember this is this is interested you
[31:47] adulterers and adulteresses know ye not
[31:49] that the friendship of the world is
[31:51] enmity with God then we can't mean both
[31:54] friends with Jesus and the devil you
[31:56] can't be friends with both whosoever
[31:59] therefore will be a friend of the world
[32:01] is the enemy of God do you think that
[32:04] the scripture saith in vain the spear
[32:05] that dwelleth in US lusts to envy don't
[32:08] you know God's a jealous God let me know
[32:10] that God has done so much he's given us
[32:13] everything he really wants your worship
[32:15] he really wants your friendship amen
[32:18] he deserves your friendship he died for
[32:21] your friendship and we don't we
[32:24] shouldn't flirt with the world we
[32:26] shouldn't give our things ourselves to
[32:28] Satan and the things of the world we
[32:29] should just be solely friends to Jesus
[32:31] Christ because it's empty it's hatred
[32:35] with God if you love the things of the
[32:36] world then you actually hate God and the
[32:39] Bible said the word friendship there is
[32:41] philia which is not a gap a love it's
[32:43] philia so it's fondness all the world is
[32:46] so great or I remember when I used to
[32:48] get drunk or smoked and that was so
[32:50] great when we used to stay up and do
[32:52] these evil things if you have those
[32:54] feelings you need to cast those down as
[32:55] we are this morning cast out anything
[32:57] that exalts itself against the Word of
[32:59] God amen don't be frightened even lick
[33:05] them down and start stomping your foot
[33:07] and clapping the gospel song right get
[33:09] back
[33:09] in the spirit get yourself in the love
[33:11] of God get yourself back in friendship
[33:13] with Christ because this is M nity
[33:16] against God to have any fondness aw it
[33:19] was so great when I used to be able to
[33:20] do this in the world and so oh I felt so
[33:22] good no it didn't because the end of
[33:25] that is death that end of all sin is
[33:29] death I'm almost done with this intro
[33:32] love not the world neither the things
[33:35] are in the world
[33:35] If any man love the world the love of
[33:38] the father is not in him for all that's
[33:42] in the world the lust of the flesh the
[33:43] lust of the eyes and the pride of life
[33:44] is not of the Father but is of the world
[33:48] amen and the world passeth away in the
[33:52] lust thereof but he that doeth the will
[33:53] of God abideth for ever praise the Lord
[33:57] I'm gonna live forever
[33:58] okay well you know how to do it the Lord
[34:03] that's right you'll live forever do the
[34:05] will of God amen okay now I think
[34:08] already here so the conclusion is only
[34:11] Jesus's friends want to know the
[34:14] mysteries so the fact that you're here
[34:16] tonight it proves to some degree you
[34:19] want to know God's mysteries that gives
[34:21] you a good chance to be friends with
[34:23] Jesus because the rest of her all the
[34:26] others love the world more than they
[34:27] love Jesus they're lovers of pleasures
[34:29] more than lovers of God and so this
[34:33] proves that if you love the things of
[34:36] God and you want to know what God thinks
[34:37] about the word and what he thinks about
[34:39] your life that proves real a real good
[34:41] application err that you're a friend of
[34:43] God and you want to be on his side amen
[34:46] glory now let's start here I think we're
[34:49] starting here now this is a fresh
[34:51] thought I had to we're looking at the 12
[34:53] New Testament mysteries but I'm also
[34:55] going to cover the consequences of not
[34:57] knowing them because there's a
[35:00] consequence if you don't know the
[35:03] secrets of God there's consequences to
[35:05] that because he's inviting everybody to
[35:07] come I want to tell you some secrets I
[35:09] want to tell you how to live this life I
[35:11] want to tell you more about my kingdom
[35:12] so if you reject that invitation there
[35:14] has to be consequences right what if you
[35:17] reject the invitation to your court
[35:19] hearing you're gonna get fine
[35:22] right your there's consequences to every
[35:25] rejection of any higher power even in
[35:28] our natural world you have to suffer the
[35:30] consequences so the grace of God I just
[35:33] felt it was important for those who
[35:35] would be streaming this short service or
[35:36] listening this shorter service that we
[35:38] let them know that there are
[35:39] consequences to not being the friend of
[35:42] Christ so we don't want the consequences
[35:46] we want the rewards we want the
[35:49] blessings of being a friend of Christ
[35:51] amen all right now I didn't get a chance
[35:59] to I had a special order as I was you
[36:01] know praying in studying last few days I
[36:02] put these in a special order and it kind
[36:04] of builds its way to a real kind of
[36:07] climax in other words what I mean is I
[36:09] put these in a special order so that the
[36:11] 12th mystery was the very last mystery
[36:14] that was going to take place who knows
[36:15] the last mystery that's going to take
[36:16] place the rapture of all these mysteries
[36:20] which is the last ones going to take
[36:22] place the rapture and after that then
[36:24] God goes back to the Jews right so I
[36:27] Holy Spirit was working on me working
[36:29] with me to put him in an order but I
[36:31] don't it was actually after I made this
[36:33] outline so it was I don't have it in
[36:35] that order but I want you to know if you
[36:36] can place these by the leadership of the
[36:38] Spirit of God you can place these in the
[36:40] order that the mysteries keep building
[36:41] and building and building and the very
[36:43] last one is where Jesus I'm taking my
[36:45] wife before the before the tribulation
[36:47] sets in I'm gonna rescue her because
[36:49] she's mine Satan don't touch her Jezebel
[36:52] system don't touch her she's mine she's
[36:54] already washed she's already forgiven
[36:56] she's already perfected Satan get your
[36:58] hands off her she's mine it's time for
[37:00] the wedding ceremony and it's also time
[37:02] for the marriage reception praise God
[37:04] the wedding supper of the Lamb in the
[37:06] sky amen
[37:07] time for three and a half years with my
[37:09] sweetheart alright so let's look at
[37:12] these like I said these are not in the
[37:13] order I wanted to do it so when I did
[37:19] the outline I had you know the general
[37:21] mysteries first that dealt with the
[37:23] church and then I built them up in the
[37:26] middle was that your enemies the
[37:27] mysteries of your enemy you got four you
[37:28] have to know your enemy how many know
[37:29] you have to know your enemy any good
[37:32] athlete anybody knows you got a study
[37:33] tape of your enemy if you want to do
[37:35] good again
[37:35] your enemy you're not just gonna walk in
[37:37] there and beat up some team that you
[37:40] don't know anything nothing about
[37:41] usually you need to know their
[37:42] tendencies you have to take notes on
[37:44] them you got to know what they're gonna
[37:45] do and we know what Satan's gonna do
[37:47] he's gonna try to discredit God's Word
[37:49] and say God's Word doesn't mean what it
[37:51] says but you and I can say get thee
[37:53] behind me that devil every word of God
[37:55] is yay and amen hallelujah every word of
[37:58] God will come to pass hallelujah so the
[38:02] first mystery is Israel's blindness
[38:06] during the Gentile dispensation if you
[38:08] want to know where brother BAM preaches
[38:09] this it's in sirs this the end time it's
[38:12] December 30th 1962 yeah thank you
[38:17] brother I was gonna say yes thank you I
[38:19] needed that I got my year Simon listen
[38:21] to the 61 sermons Revelation chapter 5
[38:24] and so forth yes sir 62 now the main
[38:29] scripture is Romans 11:25 that's the
[38:31] main scripture so let's read that I'm
[38:34] gonna read it Romans 11:25
[38:36] and some of these I'm just gonna go kind
[38:37] of quickly because I'm gonna try to
[38:41] spend the most time on the ones that are
[38:43] most important to us but all these are
[38:47] necessary these are all secrets of Jesus
[38:51] and I hope somebody gets excited because
[38:53] I hope somebody gets cuts to the
[38:54] revelation that Jesus has been whispered
[38:56] all these secrets to me all these years
[38:58] and I didn't even know it he's been
[39:00] sharing all these seekers with me except
[39:05] for granite let's give thanks that God
[39:08] has whispered Christ has been whispering
[39:10] this is what I only tell my friends tell
[39:13] this to everybody I tell this to my
[39:14] closest friends Oh glory Romans 11:25
[39:19] thank you Jesus for I would not brethren
[39:22] that you should be ignorant of this
[39:23] mystery lest ye should be wise in your
[39:26] own conceits that blindness in part has
[39:28] happened to Israel until the fullness of
[39:31] the Gentiles come in amen
[39:35] so the mystery is this here's the
[39:38] revelation of the mystery Israel cannot
[39:41] recognize Jesus Christ as their Messiah
[39:44] until he is done saving the Gentiles yet
[39:49] God in His mercy will still save any
[39:51] faithful Jew who is true to the Jewish
[39:54] faith that's the mystery and where's all
[39:57] kinds of scripture on that like I said I
[39:59] had four scriptures on the it's for
[40:01] touch sake if there's any seed of God if
[40:04] there's any desire for anyone listening
[40:05] or here to be a friend of God you'll
[40:08] want to hear more of this that's how it
[40:09] was with me I heard one restore truth
[40:11] about the this two seeds in the Garden
[40:13] of Eden and I couldn't get enough I've
[40:15] been in it ever since I'm still
[40:16] listening looking for more revelation
[40:18] because I want to know the mind of God I
[40:22] want to be his friend glory that's the
[40:26] first one now that's here's the
[40:30] consequence
[40:31] I'm sorry here's another scripture the
[40:33] Bible actually said Paul and Barnabas
[40:35] they put a they put a lot in the sand
[40:37] they said okay since you're gonna blast
[40:38] him our gospel he said I'm putting a
[40:40] line in the sand from henceforth I'm
[40:42] only going to the Gentiles so he made an
[40:45] official proclamation we're done with
[40:47] the Jews were going to the Gentiles and
[40:49] you also know I don't think I had this
[40:51] one up here yeah I didn't get a chance
[40:52] but I want to put a charter timeline
[40:54] didn't have a chance to do that and I
[40:55] spelled that word wrong too so forgive
[40:56] me time alene but I want to show it to
[41:01] where Paul says I'm the minister to the
[41:04] uncircumcision so I'm the servant to the
[41:06] the Gentiles and Peter said I'm the
[41:08] minister to the circumcision the Jews
[41:10] but that's in Galatians chapter one and
[41:13] two all right there's our scripture
[41:16] jesus said this as well how many know of
[41:18] Jesus had this jesus said that Israel be
[41:20] trodden down of the Gentiles I'm sorry
[41:23] Jerusalem will be so the Muslims are
[41:26] going to have control of the Temple
[41:28] Mount until the times of the Gentiles be
[41:31] fulfilled
[41:33] once the Jews get that back they got
[41:37] control with Jerusalem oh my now you
[41:40] know the rapture if it didn't already
[41:41] take place it's going to happen soon
[41:43] because we don't know exactly well the
[41:45] temple be built before the rapture after
[41:47] we don't know it looks like after but
[41:50] jesus said they'll not have control of
[41:52] it until all the gentiles that come in
[41:54] so we want to pay attention to what our
[41:58] friend tells us we don't want to let
[42:00] that slip
[42:02] right next so what's the consequence of
[42:04] not knowing this mystery well some may
[42:06] be angry with Israel for rejecting their
[42:08] Messiah you know them they may condemn
[42:11] Israel they may be condemning people
[42:13] that are actually getting saved a church
[42:14] we don't want to condemn anybody that's
[42:16] gonna be saved others may curse them
[42:19] I forgot my s there others may curse
[42:21] them but God already promised to bless
[42:24] Israel so that's the consequence of not
[42:27] having this revelation you don't know or
[42:30] you might be against the very people God
[42:32] is trying to bless God has brought them
[42:34] back to Israel God's bringing them back
[42:36] after they were scattered all over the
[42:37] world they're trying to bring them back
[42:38] and people might sit there with with a
[42:40] bad attitude or an evil spirit towards
[42:42] God's own people and God said can I
[42:45] forget a mother may forget her babies he
[42:47] said but I can't forget Israel because
[42:48] she's itching the palm of my hand I died
[42:50] for hey I died for Israel
[42:53] so the concept and this is one of the
[42:56] the least of the consequences right
[42:57] maybe trying to curse whom God has
[43:00] blessed okay that's a pretty easy one
[43:02] let's keep going now this is the one I
[43:04] want to do last because I believe just
[43:08] kind of I just felt led of the Holy
[43:09] Spirit I believe actually build so that
[43:12] 12th one the 12th one will be the last
[43:14] one that'll be the rapture and that's
[43:16] the end of the mysteries but anyways the
[43:20] rapture is also called the catching away
[43:23] or the caught up experience where the
[43:26] dead in Christ rise first they meet
[43:29] Christ in the air and then we which are
[43:30] alive and remain our bodies are changed
[43:32] and we go to the sky so what is the
[43:35] revelation Jesus will resurrect the dead
[43:37] Saints first and then change the bodies
[43:40] of the living Saints and take them away
[43:41] to heaven before pouring out his wrath
[43:43] and judgment now we hear a lot of
[43:46] preaching about this so I'm keeping this
[43:48] one shorter and if you want to read that
[43:51] this is a beautiful chapter to read
[43:53] about how we're either going to be saved
[43:55] spared from the wrath or we're going to
[43:56] have to go through the wrath so what's
[44:00] the consequence of not going in the
[44:02] rapture not understanding the rapture
[44:04] mystery all those without the revelation
[44:06] will be left behind and we'll have to
[44:09] endure the hour of temptation which is
[44:11] the temptation to take the mark of the
[44:13] beast and the wrath of God during the
[44:16] church
[44:16] relation period that's an awful
[44:18] consequence they're going to make a
[44:20] decision do I die and let this
[44:22] government system kill me
[44:24] or did I take the mark of the beast and
[44:26] be separated from Christ eternally that
[44:28] they're gonna have that choice do I die
[44:30] or what do I do but the Bible said
[44:33] because you've kept my words Jesus said
[44:36] I will keep you from that hour
[44:37] temptation amen he's going to keep his
[44:40] friends from that hour temptation
[44:42] according to Revelation 3:10 because
[44:44] you've kept the Word of God Oh
[44:46] hallelujah
[44:48] so there's awful consequences to not
[44:50] knowing the revelation of the rapture
[44:52] you're left behind and you're left with
[44:54] this life-or-death decision do I want to
[44:57] die do I want to do I want to wander
[44:59] around do I run from the government or
[45:01] whatever or whatever happens during that
[45:03] Tribulation and do or do I take the mark
[45:06] of the beast
[45:06] Oh God keep us from that amen keep us
[45:09] from that okay number three this was a
[45:12] very general one I'm not going to spend
[45:14] much time on this but there's one body
[45:16] of elect use and Gentiles so before
[45:20] there was a mental wall partition
[45:22] only the Jews could be saved I remember
[45:24] that from Ephesians chapter 3 there we
[45:26] used to be a middle wall of partition
[45:27] separated the Jews from the Gentiles but
[45:30] the Bible said the blood of Jesus Christ
[45:31] knocked down that wall amen and all
[45:35] these scriptures prove it it was a
[45:36] mystery so the revelation is any Jew or
[45:40] Gentile with the baptism of the Holy
[45:43] Ghost is part of the family of God with
[45:45] the same benefits and inheritance amen
[45:48] it used to be us we used to be the ones
[45:50] who had no inheritance but now Jesus
[45:54] broke down that wall and now we inherit
[45:56] all the blessings of God you and I used
[45:58] to be kept out but now it wrought in
[46:01] ain't ahead they've always had all the
[46:04] blessings you know since Moses yeah they
[46:05] got all these blessings and we're the
[46:07] ones who want to get in and now we can
[46:09] come in and then I say thank you Jesus I
[46:12] want to come in I want to be a part of
[46:14] the family of God I want the blessings
[46:16] of God if I know their inheritance Jesus
[46:18] you're my inheritance
[46:19] you're my portion amen hallelujah so
[46:24] what's the consequence we saw this in
[46:25] the scripture there are consequences to
[46:27] not understand this mystery if you
[46:29] understand this you may see gait
[46:31] yourself from the opposite group just
[46:34] like Peter did Peter got so
[46:35] self-righteous he stopped hanging around
[46:37] with Gentiles cuz he didn't understand
[46:39] the mystery everyone understand that
[46:41] memory separate itself Paul went up to
[46:44] him said you're to be blamed he he
[46:48] buckled to the pressure and he kind of
[46:50] got he thought about what word Jews were
[46:52] a little bit better than these Gentiles
[46:53] for fear the Bible said because he
[46:56] didn't quite maybe he lost the
[46:57] revelation the mystery or maybe he
[46:58] forgot it or maybe he was just too much
[47:00] pressure but without this revelation
[47:03] you'll separate yourselves and so I
[47:05] can't have nothing to do with the other
[47:06] group also let's read this Romans 11 21
[47:11] this will be bless your heart if you're
[47:14] not careful you don't have this
[47:16] revelation you're and this is what we
[47:18] have to be very careful of in the
[47:20] message I think brother Brian will agree
[47:22] with me as a minister the gospel
[47:25] pride is one of our biggest hindrances
[47:27] in the message because we know we're not
[47:30] out in Babylon we know we're not worldly
[47:32] dressed in worldly you know doing all
[47:34] these kind of things but then we stop
[47:36] hunger after God and we can come to a
[47:39] stance in other words we can come to an
[47:40] antichrist denominational spirit and
[47:43] even though we're not a denomination we
[47:45] can get the spirit of a denomination and
[47:47] not hunger and thirst for more of God
[47:49] amen
[47:52] because look at the Bible said Romans 11
[47:54] 21 for if God spared not the natural
[47:56] branches take heed lest he also spare
[47:59] not thee so what's the Bible say you
[48:01] better not get prideful or God is gonna
[48:03] break it off that's what the Bible says
[48:05] Gentiles don't get prideful like you're
[48:08] so much better you're you're so much
[48:10] holier than the Jews God will break you
[48:12] off take heed be happy be thankful what
[48:15] you have rejoice in what you have do all
[48:17] that you can for the kingdom of God
[48:19] before the rapture take advantage of the
[48:23] blessings that we have and don't get
[48:25] caught up don't don't get exalted that's
[48:28] why I want to keep going fishing
[48:29] that's why I want to keep seeing salsa I
[48:31] don't try to get as many souls as we can
[48:33] say if I want to keep sending
[48:34] missionaries I just want to keep doing
[48:35] all for Jesus Christ because I don't
[48:37] want to get complacent because I know
[48:40] the spirit of complacency brother man
[48:42] said
[48:43] the Antichrist spirit sits right there
[48:44] on your chair next to you let me know
[48:47] that he's trying to cool you off oh you
[48:50] don't have to
[48:51] don't don't pull on the word don't
[48:53] hunger for more of God you're fine at
[48:55] least you're not a Catholic you know at
[48:56] least you're not a denominational person
[48:58] he tries to make you that proud Pharisee
[49:01] well thank God I'm not like them we
[49:03] don't want to be like that we must
[49:04] always remember that he saved us that we
[49:06] were old wretched in sand and porom
[49:09] blind and naked and we ought to be
[49:11] thankful that we have eyes to see so see
[49:14] that's a great application to this
[49:17] mystery that we cannot be prideful
[49:19] because God can break us off at any time
[49:23] and I know that's that's sobering isn't
[49:26] it Church time you say Amen that's
[49:27] sobering praise the Lord number four
[49:30] this great mystery the New Testament
[49:32] church is the Bride of Christ Paul said
[49:36] I speak a great mystery but I speak
[49:38] concerning Christ in the church so this
[49:42] is a mystery we're not just not we're
[49:43] just not like a church or a body of
[49:45] believers or we're not a business you
[49:47] know we are actually the wife of Jesus
[49:49] Christ so any Jew and here's what here's
[49:54] the reaction revelation any Jew or
[49:55] Gentile with the baptism the Holy Ghost
[49:57] is placed in the throne position as
[50:01] brother Brian preached this morning of
[50:02] bride or wife of Christ the husband and
[50:06] so because we know we will be placed
[50:09] around his throne throne we live our
[50:11] lives in a way that we judge everything
[50:14] now while we're on this earth we judge
[50:17] it either this is right or this is wrong
[50:18] because we know we're gonna be placed in
[50:21] a judgement seat so our lives judge
[50:23] everything now amen
[50:26] that's the revelation you ever ever feel
[50:29] like you're being watched does anybody
[50:31] ever feel like to be much I'm not
[50:32] talking about Big Brother I'm not
[50:34] talking about you know conspiracy theory
[50:36] but this week I was thinking about that
[50:38] like my everywhere I go I feel like I'm
[50:39] me and watch and the Bible says the eyes
[50:42] of the Lord run to and fro upon the
[50:45] earth watching all your actions that's
[50:48] what I want I always want to know that
[50:51] God is watching me so I can please him I
[50:53] never want to forget that he's around
[50:56] I want to oh yes Lord even if my if it's
[50:59] just meeting my children and I'm in the
[51:01] you know in the kitchen or if it's just
[51:03] the children I you know out in the
[51:05] garage I want to remember that Jesus
[51:06] Christ he's right there watching me and
[51:09] I've got to judge things they're like I
[51:12] would judge it if I was in heaven praise
[51:15] the Lord that's the revelation we need
[51:17] to judge things right now and if we
[51:20] can't like Paul said if we can't judge
[51:22] little problems in the church now how
[51:24] are we gonna judge angels later on how
[51:26] are we gonna judge demons if we can't
[51:28] judge the problems now oh yes so what's
[51:32] the consequence of not knowing that the
[51:33] church is the wife of Christ well some
[51:36] may understand their relationship to
[51:38] Christ as simply servant rather than
[51:40] spouse and here's what they do they miss
[51:42] out on the intimacy that Christ offers
[51:45] to all in other words they just have a
[51:47] church joining experience instead of a
[51:50] loving experience they don't have a
[51:52] romance with Christ
[51:54] they have like a duty yes sir yes sir no
[51:56] sir yes sir although there's part of
[51:58] that too don't get me wrong but that's
[52:02] what they do love and the care and the
[52:04] tender affections that Christ has for
[52:06] his people they see God just like stop
[52:10] it stop it stop it stop doing that stop
[52:12] it stop it that's all they know they
[52:14] don't know about God's mercy and his
[52:16] tender kindness his loving kindness is
[52:18] better than life so if they don't have
[52:22] the revelation they don't see God as a
[52:24] loving father and I have a call where
[52:26] brother Brahim said every Christian is
[52:29] like a child in the sight of God because
[52:32] when Abraham was 99 years old God came
[52:34] to Abraham he said I'm a lady I he said
[52:36] you need to rest from me or I'm sorry
[52:38] you need a nurse for me I'm the breasted
[52:40] one amen brother have said all of us are
[52:42] like children of God that need to just
[52:45] be a child and just lean in God's wisdom
[52:47] and just pull ups are just pulled upon
[52:50] His goodness and receive His goodness as
[52:52] humble little children hey amen and so
[52:58] with
[52:58] out without that revelation they will
[53:00] not be in the throne either I forgot to
[53:01] put that up there they will not be in
[53:03] the throne if they if they can't judge
[53:05] what's right and wrong now they won't
[53:07] judge it there either they can't be
[53:09] trusted with that type of responsibility
[53:11] how many want that kind of
[53:13] responsibility I do by God's grace I
[53:16] want to be able to judge it now
[53:17] judge it now if I judge it now there
[53:19] I'll judge it right there - because I'm
[53:22] judging by his Spirit praise the Lord
[53:23] all right number five the mystery of God
[53:26] in Christ the Godhead so the Bible
[53:29] literally calls this in Colossians 2 -
[53:31] the Bible literally calls the Godhead a
[53:34] mystery it says the mystery of God and
[53:36] of Christ so what's the revelation
[53:41] behind this God is one invisible person
[53:44] he is not three persons God in the
[53:49] fullness of his Godhead became visible
[53:52] in a human body named Jesus Christ that
[53:57] is the mystery that is the revelation of
[54:00] the mystery of who God is is God three
[54:02] people you know I disagree with the
[54:04] wonderful man Rick Warren although I
[54:06] think he leans a little bit towards
[54:07] economic a chemical movement but I've
[54:11] read his book and in his book he said
[54:13] God was not lonely in the beginning
[54:14] because he had three people to talk to
[54:17] not Church you know you and I know
[54:19] that's really wrong that's that's an
[54:22] awful understanding brother because
[54:24] brother Brandon tells us God was lonely
[54:27] Amen church so with the wrong doctrine
[54:32] you got the wrong understanding with the
[54:34] wrong doctrine you think God has just a
[54:36] group and he's talking in a group with
[54:37] three people all the time that's
[54:38] nonsense
[54:39] but God was all alone and he felt he
[54:42] knew there was something inside of him
[54:43] and he went to have fellowship with his
[54:45] seed that were inside of him oh thank
[54:48] you Lord amen now I went over this last
[54:51] week remember there's a father son Holy
[54:54] Ghost the son became flesh in a body of
[54:57] Jesus Christ but the Bible said it
[55:00] please the father that in Jesus should
[55:02] all the fullness dwell so all that was
[55:04] all that God was was in Christ for in
[55:08] him dwelleth all the fullness of the
[55:10] Godhead bodily
[55:12] so that means the father was in Jesus
[55:15] because the Bible says the father's in
[55:17] me the father that dwelleth in me he do
[55:20] the works the Holy Ghost was in Jesus
[55:23] because the Bible said the spirit abode
[55:26] on him and remained on him and God
[55:28] giveth him the spirit without measure
[55:30] under Jesus and the Bible said God
[55:33] anointed Jesus Christ with the Holy
[55:35] Ghost and with power so if you and I
[55:38] understand that God had right the father
[55:41] son Holy Ghost was all appearing in one
[55:44] body and that one body's name was the
[55:46] name of the Lord Jesus Christ can
[55:49] everybody see that by God's grace if you
[55:51] place all these scriptures together
[55:53] you're gonna find that it's a mystery
[55:55] but there's a revelation to it it's one
[55:57] God manifested in three different ways
[56:00] hey man one person and all that God was
[56:04] he poured into Christ amen hope
[56:06] everybody can see that by the grace of
[56:08] the Lord so what's the consequences of
[56:10] not knowing this you understand God as
[56:14] three gods and be guilty of idolatry or
[56:18] polytheism and last week we saw how the
[56:23] Beast I think Alice was here last week
[56:25] yeah that's right and she saw how the
[56:27] Beast was gonna the Antichrist spirit
[56:29] will blaspheme the name of God and they
[56:32] change God's name from Lord Jesus Christ
[56:34] and they change it to father son Holy
[56:36] Ghost and they blaspheme the name of God
[56:39] we don't want a blasting to God's name
[56:40] we want to exalt the name of God and
[56:42] that's the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[56:44] so si can everybody see how there's
[56:47] great consequences if you don't have the
[56:49] revelation of God it proves you don't
[56:51] want it
[56:52] you're really not a friend of God and
[56:54] you're guilty of all these other
[56:56] consequences because you haven't
[56:58] received God's will amen godly Luther
[57:05] halfway done ever take a deep breath
[57:07] okay
[57:08] everybody on the live stream take a deep
[57:10] breath here we're halfway through I know
[57:12] about you but this is more than life to
[57:13] me these mysteries just bring me to life
[57:16] I don't know I just to think that God
[57:18] would show me brother Brian of all
[57:20] people why would God show me why would
[57:22] he show like a millionaire or
[57:23] billionaire why would God pick up a
[57:25] little
[57:26] you know piece of trash a worm like me
[57:28] you know why would he do that it's
[57:29] because of his foreknowledge it's
[57:31] because of his love it's because his
[57:33] mercy because he foreknew that we were
[57:36] his children praise God now 1st Timothy
[57:41] 3:16 says that great is the mystery of
[57:44] godliness and then the scripture shows
[57:46] how God restored godliness he did it
[57:49] through sending Jesus Christ and we know
[57:52] godliness is restored to man through the
[57:55] stature of a perfect man faith virtue
[57:58] knowledge patience patience godliness I
[58:02] believe is next yeah patience godliness
[58:04] brotherly kindness charity so godliness
[58:06] is restored demand and then here the
[58:08] botton Ephesians 4 the Bible says that
[58:10] we must grow up into the stature of the
[58:14] fullness of Christ so the revelation is
[58:19] God makes you like himself by
[58:23] incrementally adding more of his
[58:25] character to your life before he seals
[58:29] that character into your soul amen
[58:31] hallelujah amen glory that's why every
[58:35] service is important that's why every
[58:36] day is important of a feasting on the
[58:38] Word of God it's God putting more
[58:40] character into your life he's adding
[58:42] faith and burnt you a knowledge he's
[58:44] giving you all this and then when it's a
[58:45] finished product then he seals it away
[58:47] and then all that godly character is
[58:49] living in you it's a part of you and now
[58:52] you can express it to everybody that you
[58:53] come in contact with it's a great
[58:57] mystery sister Connie ain't ahead that
[59:00] mystery of godliness amen and so this is
[59:03] how God does it he gives you faith you
[59:04] want to be baptized you get recast off
[59:07] your unbelief you want to get baptized
[59:08] you get faith then you get virtue and
[59:10] that's strength to live it publicly like
[59:12] Ruth that virtue to live before the
[59:14] people and then now is now you
[59:15] understand why you're living this way
[59:17] and then temperance now you can control
[59:19] your physical body and then it gives you
[59:20] patience to wait on God and wait for God
[59:23] and then it gives you godliness where
[59:24] you can be just like God you can love
[59:27] the unlovable you can be good to someone
[59:30] who curses you you can be good to them
[59:31] because you're a child of your father in
[59:33] heaven and the last thing God gives you
[59:36] before he gives you the Holy Ghost he
[59:38] makes sure he gives you brotherly
[59:39] kindness so
[59:40] treat the people in the church like you
[59:42] ought to treat them you're not going to
[59:44] mistreat your brother not gonna try to
[59:46] pull a false deal on brother vang your
[59:48] brother Briner you're not gonna try to
[59:50] post something fast on them you're gonna
[59:53] have kindness toward your brother and
[59:54] sister in Christ I love that amen
[1:00:01] and put off with divine love the baptism
[1:00:04] of the holy spirit that's right it's a
[1:00:06] great mystery so what's the consequence
[1:00:08] of not knowing this revelation well a
[1:00:11] church goer or whoever will become more
[1:00:13] like the world than Jesus Christ their
[1:00:17] lives will be ungodly right because they
[1:00:19] don't they do not have the revelation of
[1:00:21] godliness
[1:00:21] so they ultimately become ungodly and
[1:00:25] untamed to the gospel they don't get
[1:00:27] self-control you don't get temperance
[1:00:29] they're uh they can't control themselves
[1:00:31] why just can't overcome customer I can
[1:00:32] just can't overcome drinking I can't
[1:00:34] overcome lust and and pornography they
[1:00:36] can't overcome it because they're they
[1:00:38] won't receive what the character God's
[1:00:41] trying to add to their lives
[1:00:42] they don't understand the mystery they
[1:00:44] don't understand that God's trying to
[1:00:46] grow you up into a real living monument
[1:00:48] of Christianity Hey reliving Memorial of
[1:00:52] Christianity they don't understand that
[1:00:55] they don't want understand it because
[1:00:56] they love the things of the world more
[1:00:58] than love God oh my number seven now
[1:01:03] here we go start getting into our enemy
[1:01:05] the Bible says in 2nd Thessalonians
[1:01:07] chapter 2 verse 7 that we know the
[1:01:09] mystery of iniquity and brother Branham
[1:01:11] said the mystery of iniquity is the
[1:01:12] Antichrist spirit and eventually that
[1:01:16] Antichrist spirit will head up into one
[1:01:18] person called the Antichrist and we
[1:01:20] believe that person will be the Pope of
[1:01:22] Rome I know that's hard I know that's
[1:01:25] rough but it's the truth and we can
[1:01:28] prove it by the Bible if you read those
[1:01:29] scriptures you'll know that so what's
[1:01:34] the revelation the revelation is God
[1:01:36] makes you fully aware of your enemy so
[1:01:39] you're not ignorant of Satan's devices
[1:01:40] thus with the full armor of God you
[1:01:44] overcome all sin hallelujah so if you
[1:01:49] have the revelation of iniquity and you
[1:01:52] know what it is you'll be able to combat
[1:01:54] against it praise the Lord amen
[1:01:57] the Bible says we are not ignorant of
[1:02:00] Satan's devices we have to be aware how
[1:02:02] does God usually tempt me how does God
[1:02:04] usually try to get I'm sorry how does
[1:02:06] I'm sorry not God how does Satan usually
[1:02:08] try to tempt me how does he work on me
[1:02:10] does he wait till I'm tired does he send
[1:02:12] somebody in and try to get me round up
[1:02:14] and I got trying to get try to blow up
[1:02:16] my temper or something like that and
[1:02:18] then when we know that we can pray
[1:02:20] against that and ask God to give us the
[1:02:22] virtue that we need and over to cat in
[1:02:25] order to cast that temptation down the
[1:02:27] next time it comes upon us amen so
[1:02:31] that's the revelation now you're aware
[1:02:32] of your enemy no I was gonna work out
[1:02:34] Hanyu brother branham said he got moody
[1:02:36] whenever he got tired so bro damn new
[1:02:39] and I get tired
[1:02:40] Satan's really gonna come after me how
[1:02:41] many would raise your hand say Satan
[1:02:43] battles me when I get tired - absolutely
[1:02:46] so bro Ram knew and as soon as brother
[1:02:48] Rama had a way to a way to make Satan
[1:02:53] stop tempting him brother Ram said I
[1:02:54] would take that and I put it in their
[1:02:56] face I put it in the face of the devil
[1:02:58] but Ram said the devil tells me you have
[1:03:01] no friends and so brother man would
[1:03:02] watch his friends drive from Georgia to
[1:03:04] Jeffersonville for one service and
[1:03:05] brother hand where he would take that
[1:03:06] and say Satan I'm putting that in your
[1:03:08] face look at all these friends I got
[1:03:10] they drive 1,000 miles to hear me preach
[1:03:12] one time I got plenty of friends get
[1:03:14] behind me Satan that's what you and I
[1:03:16] can do yeah
[1:03:18] whatever lie is telling you find
[1:03:20] something that goes against that and put
[1:03:22] it right in Satan's face it'll be a
[1:03:24] while before he comes back on that one
[1:03:26] the way to you forget about that
[1:03:28] testimony and you guys say Lord remind
[1:03:30] me of that testimony that's right so
[1:03:33] what's the consequence of not knowing
[1:03:34] the mystery of iniquity churchgoers will
[1:03:36] be deceived into thinking their worship
[1:03:38] is acceptable but will actually be vain
[1:03:41] worship they may believe a lie and be
[1:03:45] damned by it
[1:03:45] according to 2nd Thessalonians 2:13 the
[1:03:50] Bible said God will give them up I've
[1:03:51] tried to give them truth I've tried to
[1:03:52] give them truth I've tried to be their
[1:03:53] friend but he said if you don't want the
[1:03:55] truth he said I'll give you a lie and
[1:03:56] you'll be damned by that lie because
[1:03:58] you'd rather have the lie than the truth
[1:04:00] you'd rather walk in iniquity and think
[1:04:03] you're doing the right thing then accept
[1:04:05] the truth of God
[1:04:07] don't want to be a blind person I don't
[1:04:08] want to be blind I want to have my eyes
[1:04:10] open I want to honestly see what I have
[1:04:13] what is my life is my life truly reflect
[1:04:15] Christ or not I want to know what the
[1:04:17] real condition of my spiritual life is I
[1:04:19] don't want to walk around here blind and
[1:04:21] and think I'm something when I'm nothing
[1:04:23] I mean I know I'm nothing but I want to
[1:04:25] be something with Christ so you
[1:04:26] understand I want to be something with
[1:04:28] Christ I know I'm nothing of my own self
[1:04:31] but with Christ I can be a more than a
[1:04:32] conqueror all right we're moving good
[1:04:35] now 8:00 all right this is beautiful I
[1:04:37] love this man the Bible said the mystery
[1:04:41] there's the mystery of the Seven Stars
[1:04:43] in Jesus's hand in Revelation chapter
[1:04:46] one so what's the revelation the
[1:04:50] revelation is that God helps you
[1:04:52] recognize the light or star for your age
[1:04:55] or time period that you may imitate that
[1:04:59] example and shine with the same radiance
[1:05:03] hey man in other words God has sent a
[1:05:06] star to every generation remember every
[1:05:07] time period and they're supposed to
[1:05:09] recognize they're supposed to hear the
[1:05:10] voice of that angel right for their day
[1:05:13] they're supposed to see how the power of
[1:05:15] God flows out to their life and they're
[1:05:17] supposed to imitate that life because
[1:05:19] that life is the closest thing to st.
[1:05:21] Paul's life amen
[1:05:24] and lord help me to imitate that life
[1:05:26] because that's a life that's worthy of
[1:05:28] the gospel so we know the lights we know
[1:05:31] who they were Paul was the greatest
[1:05:33] light he was the light I rainiest Martin
[1:05:35] these are stars of God Columbo Luther
[1:05:37] Wesley we know brother Branham is the
[1:05:39] seventh light here and so God gave us a
[1:05:42] star in the end time so we can see how
[1:05:45] did brother Branham handle temptation
[1:05:47] how did he handle money how did he
[1:05:49] handle his family how did he handle
[1:05:51] temptation how did he handle all these
[1:05:54] things we can look at his life and God
[1:05:56] thought thought so much of it that he
[1:05:57] gave us all of his thoughts on tape as
[1:05:59] well amen
[1:06:00] we're the first Asian ever have their
[1:06:01] thoughts are right on tape amen
[1:06:03] to hear the actual voice right didn't
[1:06:05] have to you know if we didn't live in
[1:06:07] his day we can still hear his literal
[1:06:09] voice Oh Oh how He loves you and me Oh
[1:06:13] how He loves his church so what's the
[1:06:16] consequence this is very dangerous
[1:06:18] churchgoers will reject the light or
[1:06:20] truth of their time
[1:06:21] and choose to walk in darkness and I've
[1:06:24] heard some of my friends even speak
[1:06:25] blasphemy about the light of our time in
[1:06:30] other words they've said well brother
[1:06:32] Branham was of the devil they've said
[1:06:34] things like that and can you imagine
[1:06:36] saying about that about Paul Paul's of
[1:06:38] the devil can you imagine saying that
[1:06:39] that's blasphemy so it's very important
[1:06:43] that we if we don't understand don't say
[1:06:47] anything bad against God's servants
[1:06:49] right touch not mine anointed and do my
[1:06:52] prophets no harm if you don't understand
[1:06:53] it just just don't say anything about it
[1:06:57] because you're rejecting the light for
[1:07:00] your day it's like saying there's no
[1:07:04] such thing as the Sun yet the sun's
[1:07:06] burning you know it's giving you a nice
[1:07:07] tan there there's no such thing as the
[1:07:09] Sun that's that's that's an evil thing
[1:07:10] that'd be ludicrous that'd be ridiculous
[1:07:14] you'd have to be insane and the same
[1:07:16] thing is true you have to be insane to
[1:07:17] say that the Ministry of brother Branham
[1:07:19] was not a Bible based holy ghost film
[1:07:22] ministry amen if you actually listen to
[1:07:25] it and study that light and look at that
[1:07:26] light and examine that light you'll see
[1:07:29] it was the true light of God hallelujah
[1:07:31] all right we're getting close
[1:07:34] getting close number nine Babylon
[1:07:36] Mystery Babylon all bye ah so the
[1:07:41] revelation of this is God reveals to you
[1:07:44] who is the first or Mother Church of
[1:07:46] impersonation so who's the first church
[1:07:49] of impersonation it's the Roman Catholic
[1:07:52] Church and then the revelation is once
[1:07:55] you know that now you can come out of
[1:07:57] her or her daughter's I didn't put that
[1:08:00] up there but we know that anything
[1:08:02] that's tied to the Roman Catholic Church
[1:08:03] you come out of it because it's a cage
[1:08:07] of unclean and hateful bird that's the
[1:08:11] Word of God now I have three videos on
[1:08:13] my YouTube page and it shows I think
[1:08:16] it's either 17 or 21 heirs of the Roman
[1:08:19] Catholic Church and it's very plain to
[1:08:21] see all the wrongs you know by the
[1:08:23] scripture the scripture proves so it's
[1:08:25] plain to see that and so we have the
[1:08:27] revelation how many got the revelation
[1:08:29] and tuck tail and run out of there as
[1:08:30] fast as they could I did and I had no
[1:08:34] more association with
[1:08:35] right because we know this it's the
[1:08:37] system we love the people but it's a
[1:08:39] system that is confused system Mystery
[1:08:42] Babylon mystery confusion it's a
[1:08:45] confused system they got the word all
[1:08:47] mixed up but you and I know the perfect
[1:08:49] interpretation the word because our
[1:08:51] friend Jesus told us amen
[1:08:52] glory and he gave us a thus saith the
[1:08:55] Lord to make sure we knew it was right
[1:08:57] hahaha that's right so what's the
[1:09:02] consequence of not knowing Mystery
[1:09:03] Babylon
[1:09:04] well they'll remain in an antichrist
[1:09:07] organizational system full of unclean
[1:09:09] spirits and because they don't come out
[1:09:12] of it
[1:09:12] they actually an eventually partake of
[1:09:15] the punishments because they won't stand
[1:09:18] up against it that means they they allow
[1:09:20] it they say it's acceptable and because
[1:09:22] they say it's acceptable they have to
[1:09:24] suffer the consequences that go along
[1:09:26] with that because in their lifetime they
[1:09:28] didn't stand up for Jesus in other words
[1:09:30] they were ashamed of the gospel and they
[1:09:33] have to suffer the consequences of not
[1:09:35] standing up for Jesus Christ the word is
[1:09:40] this helpful with anybody by God's grace
[1:09:41] tonight all right I thought it would be
[1:09:45] good to review I wanted to put this
[1:09:49] number 11 actually that's the that's the
[1:09:52] book I'm feeling lead to right next oh I
[1:09:54] don't know if I told sister Wendy but or
[1:09:56] Connie but my book went to the editor so
[1:09:58] it's with the editor another they're
[1:09:59] gonna write hell up and and I got good
[1:10:04] feedback she said you must have paid
[1:10:06] good attention in grammar class I said
[1:10:09] well maybe but my wife really helped me
[1:10:10] out the most because she's already wrote
[1:10:12] one book about essential oils but
[1:10:13] anyways I just want to encourage you
[1:10:15] that that's give me a lot of
[1:10:16] encouragement you know because I want to
[1:10:18] if Todd Terry's and I go to the grave I
[1:10:20] want to leave something behind where the
[1:10:22] people can say this points us closer to
[1:10:24] Jesus Christ
[1:10:25] I will leave something behind if I can
[1:10:27] the will of God the Bible said Paul said
[1:10:31] in Ephesians 1:9 that God has made known
[1:10:34] to us the mystery of his will in other
[1:10:38] words you and I if we're the Friends of
[1:10:39] God we know what God wants us to do
[1:10:42] we're not wandering around saying I
[1:10:44] wonder what God's got me do I wonder if
[1:10:46] what you know if God wants me to do
[1:10:47] anything today
[1:10:49] we know what God wants us to do its stay
[1:10:51] with the word and then he'll reveal the
[1:10:54] position our position for us whether
[1:10:56] we're farmer doctor preacher mother
[1:10:59] grandmother whatever he worker you are
[1:11:02] will he'll reveal your position to you
[1:11:05] and you've just got to stay in your
[1:11:07] position praise God those who do the
[1:11:12] will of God have wisely pleased him
[1:11:15] accomplishing their destiny and the
[1:11:18] revelation of that will be that Christ
[1:11:19] will say well done because you've been
[1:11:21] faithful with the little church in Akron
[1:11:23] I'll make you rule over much in the
[1:11:24] Millennium now that's what I'm hoping to
[1:11:26] hear everybody bear with me I'm just
[1:11:28] making that part up good because that's
[1:11:30] what Jesus says if you're faithful with
[1:11:32] a little I'll make you ruler over much
[1:11:34] you were faithful with the new your
[1:11:36] little family now I'm gonna make you
[1:11:37] ruler over a whole nation so we want to
[1:11:42] be faithful we want to do the will of
[1:11:43] God we want to know what God's called us
[1:11:46] to do that's the revelation so what's
[1:11:51] the consequence of not knowing the will
[1:11:53] of God well you choose not to the will
[1:11:56] of God and become a stranger to Christ
[1:11:58] walk in your own will which is
[1:12:00] ultimately selfish iniquities this one
[1:12:02] goes very closely with the mystery of
[1:12:04] iniquity if you don't walk in God's path
[1:12:07] and you're gonna walk in the wrong path
[1:12:09] you're gonna get off the beaten path but
[1:12:11] how many know the Bible said thy word is
[1:12:14] a lamp unto my feet and a light unto my
[1:12:18] path we're gonna walk in right ways when
[1:12:21] I'm walking godly ways we're doing what
[1:12:23] God's called us to do oh my almost done
[1:12:26] church bare with me or almost done I
[1:12:28] know you've heard it 10 times here I've
[1:12:30] heard me preach it 10 times but where
[1:12:32] with me or hope you're enjoying this
[1:12:33] here by God's grace amen mystery number
[1:12:36] 11 now this one's so long I can't get
[1:12:37] into this one but this is so long this
[1:12:39] this is a whole sermon of itself jesus
[1:12:42] said it is given to you to know the
[1:12:44] mysteries of the kingdom of heaven and
[1:12:47] then there are seven mysteries within
[1:12:49] this one mystery I me know that with
[1:12:51] Matthew chapter 13 and rogram says that
[1:12:54] as well there's seven kingdom mysteries
[1:12:57] it's in Matthew 13 3 250
[1:13:02] let me just read over them real quick
[1:13:03] here I'll jump out of this one I'll jump
[1:13:05] into this one because I preached a whole
[1:13:07] separate service honor
[1:13:10] so the first mystery is there are four
[1:13:13] kinds of grounds that the Word of God
[1:13:15] falls on which are four classes of
[1:13:17] people there's two kinds of saved and
[1:13:20] there's two kinds of lost that's the
[1:13:22] first mystery of the kingdom of God so
[1:13:24] you are gonna be one of these how many
[1:13:26] want to be a good ground will then be
[1:13:27] honest with God's church that's all we
[1:13:29] got to do just gotta be honest with God
[1:13:31] Oh God I had a hard day had a rough week
[1:13:32] all right whatever it is I fell short
[1:13:35] Lord forgive me be honest with God let's
[1:13:37] not hide anything from our friend amen
[1:13:40] you wouldn't hide anything from your
[1:13:41] friend if they're rid of your friend the
[1:13:43] second one is the wheat and the tares we
[1:13:47] know all about this there's two seeds
[1:13:48] right of course it goes back to Garden
[1:13:50] of Eden with the serpent seed but now
[1:13:52] it's a spiritual seed either your other
[1:13:55] of your father the devil or of your
[1:13:57] father the Heavenly Father the Lord
[1:13:58] Jesus Christ there's two kinds of seeds
[1:14:01] there's only two kinds the third one is
[1:14:03] the grain of mustard seed this has a
[1:14:04] two-fold application this has the
[1:14:07] application of faith because Jesus said
[1:14:09] faith is like a grain of mustard seed
[1:14:10] and if you just keep water in that faith
[1:14:12] it'll produce something good but also it
[1:14:14] has a second application brother Branham
[1:14:16] said it's a mustard seed he said it's
[1:14:20] like a denomination it's planted and
[1:14:21] then if that little if that little air
[1:14:24] of the domination grows up it'll house
[1:14:26] all the birds and he calls those unclean
[1:14:28] spirits in other words it's the
[1:14:30] Antichrist system so the third mystery
[1:14:32] cannot can be good but can also be bad
[1:14:35] it depends which side you're on how many
[1:14:37] are on the seat of the side of faith by
[1:14:39] God's grace how many got mustard seed
[1:14:42] faith tonight amen
[1:14:43] I know yeah and you can move mountains
[1:14:45] even with a grain of seed of a mustard
[1:14:48] seed faith you can still move a mountain
[1:14:49] hallelujah for the the leaven hid in
[1:14:53] three measures of meal this has one of
[1:14:56] three applications it could be the
[1:14:57] Father Son Holy Ghost false doctrine
[1:14:59] which was the three-cornered Club
[1:15:00] brother Branham saw or it could be the
[1:15:02] three unclean spirits like frogs in the
[1:15:04] sixth vow which it would be Satan the
[1:15:08] spirit of Rome and the Pope Antichrist
[1:15:09] or it could be the threefold blasphemy
[1:15:12] of the Beast which is blaspheming God's
[1:15:13] name God's tabernacle and God's saying
[1:15:16] it could be one any of those or it could
[1:15:18] be all three of those because there's
[1:15:20] three of them and this is a whole sermon
[1:15:23] I don't have time I know you're all
[1:15:24] staring they're like I'm gonna read that
[1:15:25] real fast you know but that's a whole
[1:15:27] sermon already and I got the link to it
[1:15:29] if you would listen to the link I could
[1:15:30] give it to you the treasure hid in the
[1:15:32] field that's the fifth one this parable
[1:15:36] seems very similar to the six parallel
[1:15:38] and brother branham liken humans unto
[1:15:40] the merchants and the one great pearl as
[1:15:43] Christ so we're supposed to sell out
[1:15:46] everything and go by and make sure we
[1:15:48] can have that field that has that one
[1:15:50] great pearl that one great person Jesus
[1:15:52] Christ amen
[1:15:54] brother branham called the pearl of
[1:15:56] great price
[1:15:57] I think I'm sorry I think I overlap that
[1:15:59] was the one I just said this is in the
[1:16:02] field and there's a great treasure in
[1:16:04] the field sorry so he gives two
[1:16:05] illustrations of the pearl of great
[1:16:07] price and brother Brahim said he found
[1:16:08] that pearl his mother said that he said
[1:16:13] when I receive the Holy Ghost my mother
[1:16:15] said that boys lost his mind I said but
[1:16:17] no matter what mother thought I'd found
[1:16:19] that pearl of great price so that for a
[1:16:21] great price is the baptism of the Holy
[1:16:22] Ghost
[1:16:23] I've sold out everything just give me
[1:16:25] that pearl just give me that valuable
[1:16:27] jewel that valuable gem Jesus Christ
[1:16:30] amen
[1:16:31] glory and the seventh one was the net
[1:16:35] cast of the sea and program told us what
[1:16:37] that was
[1:16:37] he said the gospel will attract all
[1:16:39] kinds of people good people but also
[1:16:41] tract tears as well snakes wiggle worms
[1:16:44] you name it you know brother man talks
[1:16:46] about wiggle tails Turtles the true the
[1:16:49] true fish will be kept but anything
[1:16:51] that's not a genuine rainbow trout will
[1:16:54] be cast back out into the water the guy
[1:16:57] the gospel attracts all kinds of people
[1:16:59] does that help by God's grace there's
[1:17:01] seven mysteries within that one mystery
[1:17:03] of the kingdom of heaven all right last
[1:17:05] one and this really this could be the
[1:17:08] last one too but this last mystery is so
[1:17:12] crucial it's that pro of great price
[1:17:14] Christ in you the hope of glory Paul
[1:17:17] said this mysteries been hidden from
[1:17:20] from nations I'm sorry from from keep
[1:17:22] from people's and from prophets this has
[1:17:24] been hit on down all through the ages
[1:17:26] and the mystery was that Christ just
[1:17:28] didn't want to be around you he wanted
[1:17:30] in you he just didn't want to be above
[1:17:32] you you didn't want to be with you he
[1:17:34] wanted more than that he wanted to be
[1:17:35] inside of you amen
[1:17:38] that's Colossians 1 25 to 27 so what's
[1:17:41] the revelation those who are born again
[1:17:43] or baptized with the Holy Ghost have the
[1:17:45] constant abiding presence of the Holy
[1:17:47] Ghost in their souls and they are sealed
[1:17:50] as God's eternal possession so that
[1:17:54] means there's no going back brother Jose
[1:17:56] there's nothing in me that wants to go
[1:17:57] back to the world all right and trade
[1:18:00] nothing for my journey now I'm gonna
[1:18:02] make the rapture somehow whether I got
[1:18:05] to go through like they say hell or high
[1:18:07] water if I got to go through torment or
[1:18:09] whatever like David said if I go down to
[1:18:10] hell now art with me there - amen
[1:18:13] no matter what I've got to go through
[1:18:14] I'm gonna make it somehow because he's
[1:18:17] promised that he sealed his presence
[1:18:19] inside of me he's done so much for me
[1:18:21] there's no desire in my heart to go back
[1:18:23] to the things of the world
[1:18:24] I'd say it's hard when you get hurt you
[1:18:26] know like David said I could have
[1:18:28] handled the battle if you know would
[1:18:29] have been an enemy that would have
[1:18:30] beaten me up he said but it hurt when it
[1:18:32] was one of my friends it hurts when you
[1:18:34] get it really hurts when you get hurt by
[1:18:37] somebody in the church I mean know what
[1:18:39] I'm talking about but we got to have
[1:18:41] what we got to have that brotherly
[1:18:42] kindness praise the Lord we got to be
[1:18:46] able to forgive and love people in the
[1:18:47] family of God amen glory so what's the
[1:18:53] consequences of not being born again
[1:18:55] those who reject the seal of God or the
[1:18:57] born-again experience do not belong to
[1:19:00] Christ because they're not sealed
[1:19:01] they're not a finished product and
[1:19:03] possess a corruptible soul and they have
[1:19:07] little chance of being saved because
[1:19:09] remember your soul is either
[1:19:10] incorruptible the Friends of God is
[1:19:13] their divinities they're in your soul or
[1:19:15] it's corruptible it can fade away it can
[1:19:18] be abolished right it can be it can have
[1:19:20] an ending point and here's a good point
[1:19:23] let's say to our feeder you know one of
[1:19:26] the one of the restored truth is that
[1:19:27] hell is not eternal hell does not last
[1:19:30] forever and think about this it's true
[1:19:35] because in order to to be in hell
[1:19:36] forever you'd have to have eternal life
[1:19:38] to burn eternally and what kind of God
[1:19:42] would make
[1:19:44] be punished for all eternity would that
[1:19:47] be a merciful God no God is merciful
[1:19:51] church and it's merciful that sinners
[1:19:54] have a corruptible soul that even if
[1:19:56] they reject his love at some point the
[1:19:59] suffering or punishment will stop just
[1:20:00] because he's so merciful
[1:20:01] does that help you by God's grace I
[1:20:04] heard that thought and I thought my
[1:20:05] that's beautiful
[1:20:06] it's so true what kind of God would
[1:20:09] punish somebody eternally without end
[1:20:12] just for a hundred years of disobedience
[1:20:13] let's say they live 100 years old but
[1:20:15] God is merciful he'll end that he gives
[1:20:18] him a corruptible soul
[1:20:22] God is so merciful to us so lastly just
[1:20:28] so and you and I know this we've all
[1:20:29] seen this these mysteries can be
[1:20:32] understood intellectually without having
[1:20:36] that love or that great for that pearl
[1:20:38] of great price because that's what the
[1:20:41] Bible says I can have all I can have to
[1:20:45] get the prophecy and understand all
[1:20:46] mysteries and all knowledge and though I
[1:20:48] have all face that I could remove
[1:20:49] mountains and have not charity I'm
[1:20:51] nothing the church you and I could have
[1:20:54] not and I believe it I believe I believe
[1:20:56] it and you could still not be God's
[1:20:58] friend but how many want to be his
[1:21:00] friend
[1:21:05] amen now how once you come here we'll
[1:21:07] close with that by God's grace do you
[1:21:11] appreciate that little message there
[1:21:12] does that help oh I just thank the Lord
[1:21:14] for that
[1:21:14] I think that's an I've already started
[1:21:16] the rough draft relieving this the next
[1:21:17] book I'm gonna start by God's grace just
[1:21:19] because I think the people need to know
[1:21:21] it don't you
[1:21:21] we already got a great book on wrote on
[1:21:23] the church ages we got a book on the
[1:21:24] seals I feel like we need a book on the
[1:21:26] mysteries if we can just borrow grams
[1:21:29] our revelation just put the scriptures
[1:21:31] in there and if it's a real seat of God
[1:21:33] they'll believe it if it's a real friend
[1:21:36] of Jesus they'll want to keep those
[1:21:38] commands because he's our friend that's
[1:21:41] just of our heads and might you just
[1:21:42] play what a friend we have in Jesus
[1:21:43] they're by God's grace
[1:21:46] in church odd I saw some you raise your
