[0:00] I'm thinking it's going to be a shorter
[0:01] sermon that might be hard for people to
[0:02] believe but I think it's shorter and
[0:04] then if that's the case then I'll just
[0:07] share some thoughts about uh the Deeds
[0:10] of nicadan and so forth like that so I
[0:12] appreciated brother Simon uh preaching
[0:14] that and I requested that because I I
[0:17] thought I'd be here and uh since I know
[0:19] that he he and cam have studied uh
[0:22] deeper in those topics I wanted to hear
[0:24] I want to hear like the fresh Revelation
[0:26] on it like any other fresh Revelation so
[0:29] I got to listen to it today by God's
[0:30] grace I was blessed and so um if there's
[0:33] a little time afterwards I'll uh just
[0:36] share a few thoughts on that by God's
[0:38] grace to just kind of add to it I wish I
[0:40] one thing I wish I wish I could have saw
[0:42] his pictures up here I was straining at
[0:43] the you know the YouTube screen I'm like
[0:45] I can't too blurry just just not enough
[0:47] pixels there so but uh thankful for
[0:50] God's grace here uh 1 Corinthians 10:15
[0:52] by God's grace I think this is part 14 I
[0:55] might have put 15 on the internet but
[0:57] we'll get that figured out here by God's
[0:58] grace I don't want to get too far from
[1:01] this series
[1:02] uh I could have kept going on the spirit
[1:04] of burning but I had to done a little
[1:06] more study um but i' studied on this one
[1:09] here so uh we'll look at this here
[1:12] tonight by God's grace 1 Corinthians
[1:15] 10:15 now we've uh preached uh chapter
[1:18] 10 here uh verses 1 to 15 but I'm going
[1:21] to start at 15 by God's
[1:26] grace so let's read this we'll just read
[1:28] one verse there and then have you be
[1:29] seated
[1:30] let's read that on three one two 3 I
[1:33] speak as to wise men judge ye what I say
[1:37] may God add his Blessing to the reading
[1:38] of his word you can be seated by God's
[1:40] grace we'll take uh I do think I have
[1:42] slides honey if you'd like to uh put
[1:45] them up there I'm going to set a timer
[1:46] here and see how as I was studying this
[1:49] I thought well I don't think I'll I
[1:51] don't think it'll take me too long to
[1:52] preach for this but you never know all
[1:54] the thoughts from all the other sermons
[1:55] you listen to you know they kind of come
[1:56] out sometimes and um we'll kind of see
[1:59] how this goes here by God's grace but we
[2:01] read our text now this chapter has three
[2:03] different topics according to CI
[2:05] scoffield uh we looked at uh the first
[2:08] Set uh a while back it would have been
[2:10] back in February Israel in the
[2:12] wilderness was a warning example I think
[2:14] there was four warnings uh there in
[2:16] chapter 10 uh remember one was uh
[2:19] fornication idolatry murmuring and I
[2:23] can't remember the last one um so let me
[2:27] go there by God's grace and then we'll
[2:29] look at that just a review that yes
[2:32] idolatry fornication oh tempting Christ
[2:34] tempting Christ and then uh murmuring
[2:38] against others or against God hallelujah
[2:42] so we don't want to complain we want to
[2:44] keep our bodies pure Hallelujah right we
[2:46] don't want any Idols in our life right
[2:48] nothing that we go to more than we go to
[2:50] Christ a lot of people go to the bottle
[2:52] or they go to the cigarette pack or
[2:54] whatever or they go to porn or whatever
[2:56] they go to they go to that for pleasure
[2:58] we got to go to Jesus Christ for all our
[2:59] pleasure Hallelujah that's the word of
[3:02] God
[3:03] hallelujah now we uh also saw then uh
[3:07] here now that we'll get to the next
[3:08] topic I think we can finish the chapter
[3:10] tonight uh by the help of the Lord if
[3:12] God would be gracious to us we'll look
[3:14] at fellowship at the Lord's table demand
[3:17] separation so Paul kind of starts
[3:18] getting down you know he mentioned this
[3:20] earlier in chapter 8 but now he's going
[3:21] to kind of get down to cutting it right
[3:23] here telling exactly what to do because
[3:25] remember there was people that were
[3:26] fresh they were fresh in the message
[3:28] right they're just coming into
[3:30] Christianity and they they get invited
[3:31] to this Temple you know Temple of uh
[3:34] Apollos or something Aphrodite and they
[3:37] know it's going to be after all the the
[3:39] false worship and and they're just going
[3:41] to go there and eat right and they just
[3:42] think well I'm just going there to eat
[3:44] I'm not going to partake in the worship
[3:45] I'm not going to partake in the
[3:46] prostitution but it's a free meal it's
[3:48] kind of an honor you know these guys got
[3:50] money and and I'm hungry right they
[3:53] didn't have two-day delivery like Amazon
[3:55] like we do right so you know they had
[3:57] they more Agricultural Society it was a
[3:58] lot of hard work to get some food you
[4:00] know wasn't eat you couldn't go just go
[4:01] buy some steak you know down a Chipotle
[4:04] but for whatever reason they just
[4:05] thought it was uh part of the you it was
[4:07] acceptable but uh Paul has to come down
[4:09] and right here in chapter 10 he kind of
[4:11] cuts it right there and you're going to
[4:12] see what he says here just lays it out
[4:15] uh
[4:16] precisely that's verses 16 to 22 and
[4:19] then in uh to end the chapter it's
[4:21] verses 23- 33 the law of love and how it
[4:25] relates to eating and drinking by God's
[4:28] grace okay so we've now we're into the
[4:31] uh the fifth section here we looked at
[4:32] the introduction standing in Grace now
[4:34] church if ever a church needed Grace it
[4:37] was this one now all of us do how many
[4:40] know our church needs Grace amen unmar
[4:43] favor which means we didn't earn it God
[4:45] just gave it right and then of course
[4:47] there's Mercy something different right
[4:49] Mercy is when you're you're guilty but
[4:51] God shows you Mercy Grace is just a gift
[4:54] but Mercy is when you deserve worse but
[4:56] you get less thank God for grace and and
[5:00] mercy but if any church in the Bible
[5:03] that we can read of in the New Testament
[5:05] needed Grace it was the
[5:07] Corinthians and then we saw how they
[5:09] were divided and uh God's helped us here
[5:12] to become United by God's grace because
[5:13] we've had to separate Le out of our
[5:15] church Hallelujah has to be done right
[5:18] if not like I told different different
[5:20] intervals if not then we become uh we
[5:23] became uh we come under the influence of
[5:25] evil spirits run the church instead of
[5:27] the Holy Ghost how
[5:30] Hallelujah right so we must be very
[5:33] careful uh not to be divided into
[5:35] factions and clicks people call them
[5:37] today clicks uh try to show love to
[5:39] everybody praise God so make sure you
[5:40] tell everybody God bless you when you
[5:41] see them hallelujah or as they're going
[5:43] make sure you tell everybody God bless
[5:44] you see how their weeks going and like
[5:46] we said a few weeks ago talk about Jesus
[5:48] hey say did you hey what you been
[5:50] reading your Bible lately so that'll
[5:52] make you more accountable too make sure
[5:53] you read your Bible make sure you got an
[5:56] answer ready I was going into that
[5:58] Fellowship on and I I told you remember
[6:00] I was I was going to that Fellowship
[6:01] last Sunday there or Saturday with my
[6:03] family and friends and I prayed before I
[6:05] went in and I got numerous opportunities
[6:07] to witness the word of God to people
[6:09] because I remember last Wednesday night
[6:10] I pray said God help me to remember this
[6:12] prayer when I go to that and I remember
[6:13] the prayer because God reminded me but I
[6:16] just saw it again before you walk into
[6:17] any uh Place have something you're ready
[6:20] to say by God's grace I also had answers
[6:23] to tell them why I was growing my hair
[6:24] long too by God's grace so but I was
[6:27] prepared to pray Hallelujah
[6:30] uh now and then after the division he
[6:33] had to get into how sexual immorality
[6:35] was actually being
[6:37] celebrated because they failed to repent
[6:39] of it uh the man sleeping with his
[6:41] stepmother which even the pagans
[6:43] wouldn't
[6:45] do and then uh we looked at the sanctity
[6:48] of body and marriage your body is the
[6:50] Temple of the Holy Ghost and then
[6:52] marriage there's only one cause now as
[6:54] we saw in 1 Corinthians 7 people can
[6:56] divorce for any reason but they cannot
[6:58] remarry
[7:00] and still be in the sight of God as
[7:01] being holy if they marry again they'll
[7:04] be adulterers
[7:06] Hallelujah and then last week when
[7:08] brother Rod was here now if you noticed
[7:09] when brother Rod's here what do I do I
[7:10] try to preach on brother brandom because
[7:13] he's starting to re he's starting to
[7:14] understand it more by God's grace he
[7:16] said every time I come I learn more
[7:17] about brother Brandon so if you notice I
[7:19] try to study I got two sermons ready
[7:21] when I know he's coming so if he comes I
[7:23] got it if not I can preach my regular
[7:24] messages because you all you can say
[7:27] Amen you've heard most of those things
[7:28] before but how enjoy reminders as well
[7:30] by God's grace I need them too I forget
[7:32] brother said that brother said that
[7:33] brother I forget all these things
[7:35] there's and brother was always pointing
[7:37] us back to the word of God hallelujah
[7:38] now I wasn't perfect but I mean the
[7:39] majority of the time I'm never claiming
[7:41] a man's perfect outside of Christ does
[7:43] everybody understand that so like last
[7:45] week I said everything brother brand
[7:46] preached was was from God now I didn't
[7:49] you know that was hyperbole you know
[7:50] everybody understands that right we're
[7:52] not worshiping brother brand I'm not
[7:53] going to join Joseph in that that group
[7:56] I'm not joining the tape Church movement
[7:57] but I'm just saying in general the the
[7:59] general theme of his life was to point
[8:01] us back to the scriptures Hallelujah
[8:03] that's what he said in the church age
[8:04] book his his goal was to restore a true
[8:08] relationship between God and man and
[8:10] that's what I've got how many got the
[8:12] same thing tonight you have a real
[8:14] relationship not with the
[8:17] domination right not with your uh not
[8:19] with a church Creed or or not with a
[8:21] church membership but you have a real
[8:23] relationship with Jesus Christ how do
[8:24] you know because he talks to you and you
[8:27] do what he says that's the way you know
[8:29] you obey what he said because Jesus said
[8:31] if you love me keep my commands
[8:35] Hallelujah quite an introduction here I
[8:37] didn't know I was going to do all
[8:39] this and then the fifth part was uh
[8:42] we're looking at tonight Christian
[8:43] Liberties and their warning so Paul says
[8:45] you I of all these Liberties so many new
[8:47] people remember Jesus said you have much
[8:48] people in this city there was many
[8:50] Believers in Corinth so it's going to be
[8:52] a lot of sin see the more people you got
[8:54] the more sin you got bigger Church
[8:55] bigger problems little church little
[8:58] problems
[9:00] amen hallelujah now verse 15 I speak as
[9:04] to wise men judge you what I say the cup
[9:06] of blessing which we bless so see that's
[9:08] why when we have communion I always
[9:10] bless the
[9:11] symbols it's a symbol it's a cup of
[9:13] blessing when you take communion it's a
[9:15] blessing I won't let PE some people take
[9:17] it because they're not obeying the word
[9:19] of God and I don't want them to
[9:21] suffer they could get sick and weakly or
[9:23] die if I let them take a cup of blessing
[9:26] when they're living in a in a a
[9:28] disobedient condition to the word of God
[9:31] hallelujah that's right is it not the
[9:34] communion of the blood of Christ
[9:36] Hallelujah the bread which we break is
[9:38] it not the communion of the body of
[9:40] Christ so Paul now returns now he gets
[9:43] back to eating and drinking because
[9:46] that's what he talked about in chapter
[9:47] eight right chapter nine was Paul saying
[9:50] this is how preachers live right
[9:51] preachers are allowed to take ties and
[9:53] offerings that's the way God set it up
[9:54] but then I I got also got to make sure
[9:57] uh that that I I constantly keep my body
[9:59] and be into subjection I live a life of
[10:01] of self-discipline Hallelujah and not
[10:03] just the preachers
[10:05] everybody everybody's got to remain
[10:07] discipline to the Holy Spirit or else
[10:10] Paul said I could be a cast away too
[10:11] people people could fall away we didn't
[10:13] expect it but it's going to happen if
[10:15] they don't if they don't keep the sin
[10:17] out of their lives they're going to fall
[10:18] away that's right so now he says now the
[10:22] communion cup is a blessing we see it's
[10:24] it's a cup of blessing and now Paul
[10:27] returns his whole point here is to to
[10:29] show the sin of trying to partake of
[10:31] both cups we're going to see an example
[10:34] brother gives here tonight uh in a story
[10:36] you've heard it before but I think it'd
[10:37] be a refreshing to you verse 17 for we
[10:40] being many are one bread so as a church
[10:42] we are bread right and that gets back
[10:45] I'm going to preach on this hopefully
[10:46] again soon I've been studying on this uh
[10:48] the seven feasts of Israel the Feast of
[10:50] Weeks is when they waved two loaves of
[10:52] bread before the Lord and they both had
[10:56] leaven in them it represent the Jew and
[10:58] the Gentile
[11:00] Hallelujah and that represent the day of
[11:01] Pentecost amen the Holy Ghost fell and
[11:04] now the Holy Ghost unites us all as one
[11:07] body together hallelujah we're one bread
[11:10] we're so intertwined right we're so
[11:13] intertwined but when leevan comes in
[11:14] what does the Holy Spirit do takes it
[11:16] out so we can be one bread again
[11:19] Hallelujah so we see that so we're
[11:21] supposed to be United like bread how
[11:22] many bread makers we got it there don't
[11:24] raise your hand if you don't if you feel
[11:25] embarrassed I know my wife can raise her
[11:27] hand on that one I know my daughters are
[11:28] trying to learn
[11:30] can you once you make that bread can you
[11:32] separate all those grains again and go
[11:33] back do you see individuals selfish
[11:36] individuals in there no you see a body
[11:39] living for each other and the church
[11:41] said Hallelujah you can't you can't go
[11:43] back and separate well this one that one
[11:45] it's one they're United we're a family
[11:48] Hallelujah that's right Glory one body
[11:51] and we're all partakers of that one
[11:54] bread speaking of the communion
[11:56] table behold Israel after the flesh are
[11:59] are they are not they which eat of the
[12:01] sacrifices partakers so the the priests
[12:05] which partakers means a partnership a
[12:08] fellowship an associate a companion of
[12:12] the altar so when Israel would partake
[12:15] uh a member Church in every they had
[12:17] five sacrifices in the four sacrifices
[12:19] they got to eat something but in the
[12:21] burn sacrifice they ate
[12:23] nothing so with the four other ones they
[12:26] would actually partake and eat some of
[12:28] their sacrifice whether it was wine
[12:30] right whether it was meat whether it was
[12:32] uh bread as well they got to partake of
[12:35] it so they were partaking with God they
[12:38] were feasting in the presence of God
[12:40] hallelujah amen they were eating and
[12:43] enjoying the benefits that God gave them
[12:45] with God and with God's servants
[12:47] Hallelujah they were one body so they
[12:50] had this Fellowship they had this
[12:53] Association at the Lord's table
[12:55] hallelujah thank
[12:57] God right so Paul shows that you need
[12:59] the body of Christ and how communion
[13:01] promotes this Unity that's why I want to
[13:04] do it now I think I do it every three
[13:05] months now or four months I can't
[13:06] remember I I I appreciate sister Emma
[13:08] getting me helping me do that you know
[13:09] she didn't recommend that but I was like
[13:10] well if you need know in advance I'm
[13:12] going to start doing that in advance
[13:14] something that uh meets our needs now
[13:16] when I was at brother brookses we did
[13:17] communion uh the first Sunday of every
[13:18] month every single month and that was
[13:21] fine okay but I just haven't felt led to
[13:23] do that I like to spread it out a little
[13:25] bit more by God's grace uh you know and
[13:27] then brother R says in the early church
[13:28] they communion every time they
[13:30] gathered because they were so uh just so
[13:34] captivated you know with uh the the the
[13:37] day of Pentecost look what happened on
[13:38] the day of Pentecost and look what
[13:39] happened days after that you know they
[13:40] were captivated uh they had their first
[13:43] love Hallelujah so it's really something
[13:46] now he says we Fellowship I'm sorry
[13:49] communion promotes the unity which he
[13:50] emphasizes in the next chapter we'll see
[13:53] and then we fellowship with Christ and
[13:54] his body through communion and we're
[13:56] cursed if we judge the body the wrong
[13:58] way
[14:00] so that's how you know always look at
[14:02] things long term people that disobey the
[14:05] word they're going to live in
[14:07] curses but people that obey the word
[14:09] they're going to live in obedience now
[14:12] doesn't mean they're not going to suffer
[14:13] like job they might suffer and suffer
[14:17] awful but see ultimately you know if we
[14:19] have the discernment of the Holy Spirit
[14:21] we should be able to know who's living
[14:22] right who's living
[14:24] wrong right because a tree is known by
[14:27] its fruit know by fruit
[14:31] Hallelujah and so see we fellowship with
[14:33] Christ okay through that and we're
[14:34] cursed yes we're cursed according to
[14:36] we'll get to that later in chapter 11 we
[14:37] read it every time at Communion but just
[14:39] a fresh reminder that there are
[14:40] temporary curses in the New
[14:43] Testament now will those fall on Holy
[14:45] Ghost filled Believers I don't believe
[14:47] that I believe it'll be just be the
[14:49] Justified and the Sanctified I cannot
[14:51] imagine a holy ghost filled believer
[14:53] would fall under a curse like that right
[14:56] because we don't see in the scripture we
[14:57] see Peter you know disassociating I had
[15:00] another one too I just forgot another
[15:01] one there's a couple examples New
[15:03] Testament where people get off the word
[15:05] of God there I think I had one or two
[15:06] other ones but we don't see Peter coming
[15:08] under a curse because of that but we see
[15:10] him getting rebuked and God help us to
[15:11] accept a
[15:12] rebuke
[15:14] Hallelujah if you really love God then
[15:17] when you get rebuked you'll love God
[15:19] more and the person who rebuked you
[15:22] Hallelujah that's right because that's
[15:23] what Proverbs says rebuke a wise man
[15:25] he'll love
[15:26] you now won't that doesn't mean it's not
[15:29] going to sting a little bit you know
[15:31] it's going to Sting the Flesh and the
[15:32] church said I'll say this you know it's
[15:35] going to Sting the pride as well the
[15:37] human spirit it's going to sting but in
[15:41] the end you love the person
[15:44] Hallelujah verse 19 what say I then that
[15:47] the that the idols anything or that
[15:50] which is offered and sacrificed to Idols
[15:52] is anything so notice if you remember in
[15:55] chapter 8 verse4 Paul said the idols
[15:56] were nothing so we know Idol
[15:59] are nothing we know witch doctors and
[16:02] witches it's nothing it's demon powers
[16:06] it's nothing right but here now he shows
[16:10] them that are that they're
[16:11] fellowshipping with the Devils when they
[16:13] eat with pagans in their temples so
[16:16] going on the devil's grounds means
[16:18] you're going to start fellowshipping
[16:20] with demons and church it's usually by a
[16:22] dirty joke or something to get your get
[16:24] your guard down make you laugh and feel
[16:26] comfortable usually something real small
[16:30] right so imagine they wouldn't they
[16:31] would not have thrown a prostitute right
[16:33] in the uh right in the presence of those
[16:35] Corinthians Believers it would have
[16:36] started with something dealing with the
[16:37] food like a little joke about making fun
[16:40] of Jesus or making fun of Paul or making
[16:42] fun of one of the other Christians and
[16:43] you laugh a little bit then then the
[16:46] devil's got your guard down that's that
[16:49] first step right in the Sin
[16:51] process right sin conceived I'm sorry
[16:54] sin enticed entices you to laugh or
[16:56] entices you to look just look a little
[16:58] bit something you shouldn't look at then
[17:00] it conceives then you do the sin then
[17:02] comes death now God always make help us
[17:05] repent before it gets to the four step
[17:07] right because we all sin some of us sin
[17:09] every day and the church say
[17:13] Amen verse 20 but I say that the things
[17:15] which the Gentiles sacrifice they
[17:17] sacrifice to devils and not to God and I
[17:20] would not that you should have
[17:21] fellowship with Devils so think of the
[17:23] bars think of the adult clubs what do
[17:26] they when they pay their money that's a
[17:27] form of sacrifice they're sacrificing to
[17:30] the gods of sports or the gods of
[17:32] alcohol or the gods of sexual morality
[17:34] and the church said they're sacrificing
[17:37] their time and money for that it's a
[17:41] form of worship
[17:43] Hallelujah and that's their fellowship
[17:45] with demon
[17:47] powers Hallelujah that could be like a
[17:49] could be like a comedian Club too
[17:51] anything like that it could be a theater
[17:53] right a movie theater same thing when
[17:55] you pay money and you accept that and
[17:57] you go in there and it's an evil thing
[17:59] you're actually fellowshipping with
[18:01] demons now not us I'm saying we but
[18:04] hopefully not us by God's grace now
[18:06] remember this story now this was
[18:08] something too it just came to me while I
[18:09] was praying here at the altar before
[18:10] service it seems like Christians can get
[18:13] possessed with demons if they're just
[18:16] Justified and they or they lose their
[18:19] sanctification that's what it seems like
[18:22] but a holy ghost filled Saint will never
[18:24] be possessed by a devil because Satan
[18:27] sealed out and and Christ is sealed in
[18:31] because I thought about this I'm like
[18:32] wow brother random cast The Demon out of
[18:34] this young lady here and I was like yes
[18:36] I've cast demons out of people to messed
[18:37] churches
[18:38] before at least six times I think so
[18:42] this is a fresh thought I haven't had
[18:43] this thought
[18:45] before so that was something
[18:47] interesting now and the the example
[18:49] would be Saul Saul was justified he was
[18:52] saved the the anointing came on Saul but
[18:56] it left him because he got jealous
[18:59] and then the evil spirit came on then
[19:01] David had to play like
[19:02] you and then the demon left and the
[19:06] church said so we got some good examples
[19:08] there's good couple examples by God's
[19:10] grace have to find some more now not
[19:13] full not not not fullblown out you know
[19:15] uh foaming at the mouth or like some
[19:17] people have said they've seen who was
[19:19] that told me that the other day one of
[19:20] these preachers told me the other day
[19:21] that they actually saw a a woman
[19:23] possessed with a demon crawl like a
[19:25] snake right in front of him brother R
[19:27] talked about it he's seen demons do that
[19:29] which preacher was that remember
[19:32] somebody was telling me that that
[19:33] they've seen that demons uh anoint women
[19:36] or men and they crawl like snakes right
[19:39] in front of them and then they pray to
[19:41] cast out the demons now I don't think a
[19:43] a a saved Christian I don't think that
[19:45] could happen to a saved
[19:47] Christian but look what happens when
[19:49] Nelly Sanders goes on the devil's
[19:52] grounds now watch watch this she became
[19:55] possessed with the Devil by dancing to
[19:57] worldly music so be careful what you
[19:58] pass your foot to church I've got to be
[20:00] careful too I lived in the world a long
[20:02] time I didn't like it I don't like that
[20:04] I did but I've got to be careful not to
[20:07] say those lyrics or you know start
[20:09] tapping my foot it just it's because
[20:11] it's sometimes it's just a human
[20:13] reaction everybody acting like they're
[20:15] perfect out there all the time you know
[20:17] I'm just
[20:18] kidding uh then this was the first time
[20:21] brother B cast a demon out of a person
[20:23] it's someone who is already a member of
[20:25] the church his
[20:26] church and it looked that evil spirit
[20:29] look like a bat now that's scriptural
[20:31] because of Revelation chapter 9 talks
[20:33] about that one of the Demons has hair
[20:36] like women on hanging down from its
[20:37] wings so picture that a bat-like demon
[20:40] and long hair hanging down on the wings
[20:43] of a bat or it looks like a wings of a
[20:46] bat okay so this was fellowship with
[20:48] Devils Now watch how it happens how many
[20:51] ever know Nelly Sanders I guess a whole
[20:53] lot of you well she said well you know
[20:55] what maybe if I walk the steps up there
[20:57] maybe I'll be able to testify to some of
[20:58] the them so she went to the she went by
[21:00] the dance club or we'd say like the bar
[21:03] today or uh I don't know what do they
[21:05] call dance clubs today
[21:07] clubs nightclub thanks it's not in my
[21:11] life anymore
[21:13] uh so she walks by one she hears music
[21:17] she's like oh maybe I'll go testify to
[21:20] them that's the wrong place to
[21:23] testify maybe now look there's another
[21:25] key word maybe if it's a if God ain't
[21:29] send you in there don't go in there it's
[21:32] not a maybe issue it's a it's got to be
[21:34] a thus sayith the Lord good because
[21:35] Jesus went into Sinners houses but he
[21:37] never sinned
[21:39] Hallelujah and a woman by herself that's
[21:41] usually not how God Saves
[21:44] people oh see you're right on the devil
[21:46] ground say of it shun the very
[21:48] appearance of evil she walked up top of
[21:50] the steps stood there for a few minutes
[21:51] first thing you know she's in a boy's
[21:53] arms on the floor doing the Chubby
[21:55] Checkers the twist or something who
[21:57] knows I don't know
[22:00] then she come to herself she was
[22:01] standing there crying going on oh I'm
[22:03] lost now for good so this is what demon
[22:06] possession will do it'll make you think
[22:08] you're lost crying laying on the floor
[22:11] and the church said think about it think
[22:14] about people's behavior think about
[22:15] people how they look how they act think
[22:17] about when they're emotional think about
[22:20] that it can be a form of being maybe
[22:22] being be maybe just being possessed with
[22:24] one demon in the story it's one demon
[22:26] she's possessed with now that remember
[22:28] uh uh Legion uh that was what 3,000 I
[22:32] forget the actual number I have to go
[22:33] look it up what was it 2,000 thank you
[22:36] you can look it up in the Lexicon but
[22:37] even that's not thus sayi the lord it's
[22:38] just somebody's best guess it's a
[22:41] lexicon um Mary Magdalene seven demons
[22:44] now she was living in adultery so a
[22:47] person that will sleep with many
[22:48] partners without repenting they have at
[22:50] least multiple demons we don't we don't
[22:53] know the exact number but she had seven
[22:56] by sleeping around
[22:58] and did you did you see that news uh
[23:00] there was some overseas in uh she
[23:03] slept with a 100 men in one day it was
[23:05] all over the news how many demons is she
[23:08] filled
[23:10] with I would say 700 7,000
[23:15] maybe my
[23:17] goodness he says uh oh I'm lost now for
[23:20] good I thought well I don't know much
[23:22] too too much about the Bible but I
[23:24] believe Jesus said in my name they shall
[23:25] cast out devils look at that just a
[23:28] brand new
[23:29] Christian and Wayne had sobered up and
[23:31] said was sitting there now this is in
[23:32] brother Ram's house watching now devil I
[23:34] don't know who you are brother Ram said
[23:35] but I'm telling you now this is my
[23:37] sister you ain't got no business withh
[23:38] holding her she didn't mean to do that
[23:40] she just stopped for a minute now look
[23:41] the devil leaves but she must have
[23:43] repented because you can't make a devil
[23:45] leave because the devil has uh legal
[23:47] rights unless the person
[23:50] repents Hallelujah so while she's crying
[23:53] there she must have repented when
[23:54] brother random uh goes to cast The Demon
[23:57] out
[23:59] right she must
[24:01] have or else it' be like Moses when
[24:04] Moses got in trouble for magnifying
[24:06] himself with his own
[24:07] gift praise God remember when he smoked
[24:10] The Rock he said God said speak no I'll
[24:13] smoke I'll Smite it and he got in
[24:15] trouble for that he never got into the
[24:16] baptism of the Holy Ghost for his day
[24:18] the
[24:20] type she just stopped for a minute
[24:23] that's where she made her mistake though
[24:24] see but you're going to have to come out
[24:26] of her you hear me that you hear me
[24:29] look at his Elementary way to talk to
[24:30] Demons now you don't have to say that
[24:32] you just have to say in the name of
[24:33] Jesus give it a few minutes give it a
[24:35] give it a second give it give it some
[24:36] time the Demon's going to move if if if
[24:38] if the legal rights have been met if
[24:40] that sin's been confessed the devil has
[24:42] to
[24:43] go has to go I'm talking about in your
[24:45] life too when you're rebuking Spirits
[24:47] trying to get in your mind just trying
[24:49] to tempt you and God so helped me God at
[24:52] the Judgment bar knows that screen door
[24:54] begin to open and shut so when the devil
[24:56] went out it opened and shut
[24:58] it's by itself plumpy plumpy there at
[25:00] the door pump K plump K plump I thought
[25:03] and she said bill look at there look at
[25:04] there I said yeah what is it she said I
[25:06] don't know I said neither do I the door
[25:08] wasn't pumpy Pump It shutting like that
[25:11] I thought what's the matter here what's
[25:12] the matter I looked again and I said
[25:13] leave her Satan in Jesus name come out
[25:16] of her when I said that it looked like a
[25:18] great big bat about this long rose up
[25:20] from behind her with long hair hanging
[25:22] down out of its wings and off its feet
[25:24] like that was going ooh started right
[25:26] towards me just as hard as it could come
[25:28] and I said Lord God the blood of Jesus
[25:30] Christ protect me from that church the
[25:33] only you got one protection that's the
[25:35] blood of Jesus Christ that's all you got
[25:37] and church that's all we need Hallelujah
[25:40] that's all you need remember when I cast
[25:42] out Devils the the first time I I said
[25:45] as soon as I said uh the sister wants to
[25:47] be forgiven as soon as I said the blood
[25:49] of Jesus Christ is against you that
[25:51] woman the devil started fighting through
[25:52] the woman it's the first time I cast out
[25:54] deves I brought the blood of Jesus
[25:56] Christ because blood paid the price for
[25:59] her Freedom amen so the the the de the
[26:03] demon has no more legal right to be
[26:05] there because Jesus Paid the price for
[26:07] her Freedom hallelujah amen Jesus died
[26:10] on the cross so she could be forgiven
[26:12] saved set free and so when the blood of
[26:15] Jesus Christ is spoken the demons have
[26:18] to flee hallelujah oh there's wonderful
[26:22] working Power in the Blood tonight
[26:24] Hallelujah there's wonderful working
[26:26] Power in the Blood Hallelujah
[26:30] and Wayne jumped up in the bed looked
[26:31] here it was a big Shadow circled around
[26:33] went around went down behind the bed out
[26:35] the bed went weighing next to room as
[26:37] hard as he could go I got Nelly took her
[26:39] home come back mom went in there shook
[26:41] the sheets and everything there wasn't
[26:42] nothing in the bed what was it a devil
[26:43] went out of her what happened she
[26:46] stopped for a moment brother knocks the
[26:48] pulpit two times that's all don't stop
[26:50] at all when God sinks his word in your
[26:53] heart just take the sword and start
[26:54] chopping and cutting
[26:56] Hallelujah all right right so see
[26:59] there's an example of going on the
[27:00] devil's grounds just like these
[27:02] Corinthians were going on the devil's
[27:03] grounds well no wonder they're suing
[27:05] each other no wonder they're sleeping
[27:08] around divisions in the church getting
[27:11] drunk at the Lord's table no wonder
[27:13] because they're fellowshipping with
[27:14] demons on demon grounds and so they get
[27:17] demons in their minds
[27:20] Hallelujah they get anointed with evil
[27:22] spirits Paul said neither give place to
[27:25] the devil don't give him a place
[27:28] Hallelujah now look here now he starts
[27:30] laying it down here he starts telling
[27:32] the truth now you cannot drink the cup
[27:34] of the Lord and the cup of
[27:36] devils you cannot be partakers of the
[27:38] Lord's table and of the table of devils
[27:40] that's why my wife and I we've seen all
[27:42] these people come to the message soon as
[27:43] they start dabbling with movies or as
[27:45] soon as they start dabbling with
[27:46] something where they go on the devil's
[27:49] grounds Sports you name it or whatever
[27:52] uh universities and certain clubs and
[27:54] universities as soon as they go on the
[27:56] devil grounds see you later
[27:58] they take demon powers we don't see them
[28:00] no more because they've been fully given
[28:03] over to those things they're going on
[28:05] the devil's grounds remember we said
[28:07] last week Jesus said come out of her my
[28:10] people hallelujah be not a partaker come
[28:12] out and be separ sayith the Lord and
[28:15] I'll receive you Hallelujah then I'll be
[28:18] a father unto you see because Satan's
[28:20] your father when you're on the devil's
[28:22] grounds
[28:25] Hallelujah cannot partake of the Lord's
[28:27] table end of the table Devils you can't
[28:29] do both right either love one hate the
[28:32] other or hate hate one love the other
[28:34] right do we provoke the Lord to jealousy
[28:37] the answer is no let me answer that for
[28:39] you no we're not supposed to provoke the
[28:41] Lord by flirting with the
[28:43] world are we stronger than he the answer
[28:46] is no no you're not stronger than God
[28:51] Paul's saying you cannot partake of both
[28:53] without consequences right balam
[28:55] remember balam partook of both cups
[28:58] sometimes you go for enchantments other
[29:00] times you go to God and what was his
[29:03] consequence hell was his
[29:05] consequence see the people that often do
[29:07] this if if they partake of both if they
[29:10] can't love the message but love the
[29:11] world they're on their way to Hell amen
[29:15] if they don't get delivered of that
[29:18] because you cannot do both he just said
[29:20] it right there thus say the word you
[29:21] cannot drink of both really you're only
[29:23] drinking of one and the church said so
[29:25] see when they come to church they a't
[29:26] get nothing out of it they're lives
[29:28] aren't changing They Don't Really Love
[29:29] Jesus they're just coming to church to
[29:31] make themselves uh uh not feel so much
[29:33] condemnation Hallelujah that's right
[29:36] church but really if they're partaking
[29:38] of the devil's cup they're serving
[29:40] Satan Hallelujah but how many enjoy the
[29:42] cup of the Lord hallelujah thank God we
[29:45] get to drink of the pure Waters of Life
[29:48] Living Waters and it gives us joy
[29:50] unspeakable and full of Glory
[29:53] Hallelujah oh thank you Lord
[29:59] remember balum went to hell the Bible
[30:01] said The Mist Of Darkness that's where
[30:03] he's going to spend millions of years
[30:05] not eternity but he's going to spend
[30:07] millions of years in a midst of darkness
[30:10] and then there's flames right we see it
[30:12] in Luke 16 and then there's torment and
[30:15] there's desire for just one drop of
[30:19] water and that's before the that's
[30:22] before the white Throne judgment that's
[30:23] not even the Lake of Fire that's just
[30:25] hell that's just shol
[30:29] right quite a sobering thought verse 23
[30:32] all things are lawful to me but all
[30:34] things are not expedient all things are
[30:36] lawful for me but all things edify not
[30:39] so Paul repeats what he said remember he
[30:41] said this in chapter 6 verse 9 by saying
[30:44] just just because something is lawful
[30:46] doesn't mean it's spiritually beneficial
[30:48] eating in Pagan temples doesn't build up
[30:50] anyone's
[30:51] Faith
[30:52] right and I'll say like this you got to
[30:54] be careful even with Applebees and
[30:56] places like that if it's like a sports
[30:58] bar something like that or they got a
[30:59] bar there you got to be real careful
[31:00] with that right not to get involved with
[31:03] that now for me especially someone who
[31:05] used to be in the sports if I go in a
[31:07] place like that we either gotta leave or
[31:08] I got to sit so I'm not looking at the
[31:10] TV
[31:10] screens because that's a that's a a
[31:12] quick Temptation oh who's the latest
[31:14] player what's the score just it's all
[31:17] the old things it's the old life but
[31:19] that guy is supposed to be dead
[31:20] Hallelujah right but Satan tries to
[31:22] resurrect the well the flesh the sinful
[31:24] nature is always there he tries to
[31:26] anoint that again AR fresh
[31:29] see eating in the Pagan temples doesn't
[31:30] build up anyone's Faith rather it's a
[31:32] sin against Christ and it's a wound to
[31:34] the believer's
[31:35] conscience if you go on the devil's
[31:37] grounds and someone see a weak Christian
[31:40] sees you do something and that they
[31:42] think they can do it or they get
[31:44] confused you've wounded their conscience
[31:47] you've hurt their walk with god oh is
[31:49] sister so and so really a Believer is
[31:52] brother so- and so really a believer
[31:53] that you just sinned against
[31:55] Christ because you did something
[31:57] publicly that should not be done praise
[32:00] God hallelujah let no man seek his own
[32:03] but every man another's wealth so in
[32:05] every choice we should be trying to
[32:06] serve other people what would help other
[32:09] people's Faith yes I've got Liberty yes
[32:11] I enjoy Liberty all these things but he
[32:14] says don't make your Liberty a stumbling
[32:16] block to younger
[32:17] Christians that's why church I just like
[32:20] going home I just want to go home go to
[32:23] bed early it's really all I want to
[32:26] do like I told even in the past
[32:28] sometimes I I've regretted going to
[32:30] certain sporting events I told you in
[32:31] the past I've regretted because I wasn't
[32:33] ready for what was going to be there the
[32:36] music and the cheerleaders I'll say like
[32:38] that I regretted it and so I avoid that
[32:42] I learned praise
[32:44] God that's
[32:46] right now verse 25 whatsoever is sold in
[32:49] the shambles which is the meat market or
[32:51] grocery store for us it actually says
[32:53] grocery store in the Greek surprising
[32:55] that eat asking no question for
[32:58] conscious sake so whatever you go to the
[32:59] market don't ask any questions it's okay
[33:01] you know it's not you know it's not
[33:03] there's nothing evil spirit that's going
[33:05] to get on you for the Earth is the
[33:06] Lord's and the fullness thereof so the
[33:09] location of where you get the food and
[33:11] where you eat it is important so he says
[33:14] if you go in the temple that's different
[33:16] that's different if you go in that Pagan
[33:18] Temple where there's prostitutes and the
[33:20] lights are down all these people that
[33:22] turn on their lights in church you
[33:23] better watch
[33:24] that that means something bad's going on
[33:28] right and we it's we've been seen it
[33:29] this these last few years all these
[33:30] preachers fall these last few years I'm
[33:32] talking about mega church uh preachers
[33:35] they just Fallen they're falling like
[33:37] flies because there are evil sins done
[33:39] in the dark behind the scenes so it's
[33:42] important where you get the food and
[33:44] where you eat the food it's important
[33:46] where you eat it and around who right
[33:49] you got to be very careful what you do
[33:51] Hallelujah so for us it's going to be
[33:53] which restaurant you go to be very
[33:56] careful which restaurant you go to and
[33:58] where you sit when you go there for
[34:00] brothers or who whoever might battle uh
[34:02] you know things for the past with TV
[34:04] screens and so forth or even
[34:06] music verse 27 if any of them that
[34:10] believe bid or I'm sorry believe not bid
[34:12] you to a feast and ye be disposed which
[34:14] means you wish to go or desire to go
[34:16] whatsoever set before you eat asking no
[34:18] questions for conscience sake but if any
[34:21] man say to you this is offered and
[34:22] sacrificed unto Idols eat not for his
[34:25] sake that showed it and for con ience
[34:28] sake so see be a light to The Sinner
[34:31] remember you got to live holy before
[34:33] them when are they ever going they're
[34:34] never going to go to church the only
[34:35] church they going to see is in
[34:36] you right and also for your conscious
[34:40] sake for the Earth is the Lord's and the
[34:42] fullness thereof
[34:48] Hallelujah so now now that we see okay
[34:50] now that we know now we're in we're
[34:51] mature Believers we know we don't need
[34:53] anything around a sin a sinful group of
[34:56] people where there's a lot of sin going
[34:58] on prostitution gambling all these
[35:00] things right dancing sinful dancing I me
[35:03] how many weddings have we left honey
[35:05] because uh it was time of the reception
[35:07] there's all this dirty music I'm like
[35:08] let's get out of here that's that's the
[35:10] sign it's our time to go I don't want to
[35:12] see them dance and rub their uh body
[35:15] parts against each other and immorality
[35:17] what a bunch of Filth hallelujah it's
[35:20] time for us to go see you later that's
[35:23] what you have to
[35:24] do conscious I say not thine own but of
[35:27] the other for why is my Liberty judge of
[35:29] another man's conscience so now he goes
[35:31] to the other side one side is just avoid
[35:33] it all but another side is wealth
[35:35] there's nothing going on there and there
[35:37] it's not offered to an idol and it's at
[35:40] a certain place maybe it's like a market
[35:42] or something but it's of course it's not
[35:43] the Temple of Apollos or Aphrodite then
[35:46] also don't let your Liberty be judged
[35:48] don't come under condemnation church we
[35:51] got to find the balance of the Holy
[35:52] Spirit I like what brother Simon said
[35:53] like David in every situation find the
[35:56] mind of Christ wasn't that great that's
[35:59] what I did after service I didn't know
[36:01] uh I was I was being asked are we going
[36:02] to have a second service you know what I
[36:04] did I was like I just heard the
[36:05] preaching I don't know let me get on my
[36:07] knees and pray I said if Simon's feeling
[36:09] good Lord then because remember his
[36:11] stomach hurt too after leaving that that
[36:13] that meal but his stomach's tougher than
[36:15] mine no doubt about it I'm just an old
[36:18] I'm just a young fell my sto my
[36:20] stomach's not tough enough but I just
[36:21] said Lord it's in your hands if he's
[36:23] feeling good then let them have service
[36:24] Simon's like ah we'll have service
[36:25] praise God I feel great
[36:28] so I thought well maybe people are tired
[36:30] I know people are tired you know maybe I
[36:32] know all these things but Lord I want it
[36:33] to be in your hands
[36:36] Hallelujah and there are a lot of good
[36:37] questions up there young people young
[36:39] people and even Zion forgot three
[36:41] questions that's okay if I only forget
[36:43] three things I'm pretty
[36:45] happy like you see if I only forget
[36:47] three song lyrics I'm I felt I did
[36:49] pretty good that
[36:51] day everybody's nice did not laugh at me
[36:53] thank
[36:55] you verse 30 first if I by Grace be a
[36:58] partaker why am I evil spoken of for
[37:01] that which I gave thanks see here's the
[37:03] other side don't let your Liberty be
[37:05] evil spoken
[37:07] of so see if first see if if there's any
[37:10] sinful things around avoid sin like the
[37:13] plague but if you're in a spot where
[37:15] there's no sin going on and somebody
[37:17] offers you some food there yeah you can
[37:19] have
[37:21] that so Paul strongly defends our
[37:23] Christian Liberties when we're not
[37:25] wounding the consciences of others like
[37:27] like in Colossians 2:16 And1 17 so if
[37:30] we're not wounding then we are to enjoy
[37:32] your Christian freedoms and the church
[37:34] said enjoy your freedoms just enjoy life
[37:37] just be thankful like Simon said all
[37:39] this Christian persecution there's
[37:41] hundreds of Christians being slaughtered
[37:42] all around the world yes we pray for
[37:45] them we should be sad but then you know
[37:46] after we prayed and we it's okay to
[37:48] enjoy life but we still should try to do
[37:50] something about those other groups
[37:52] praise God and that's what I need to
[37:53] learn I'm asking God to Lord show me
[37:56] what I can do by God's grace what can I
[37:58] what can I do for these people other
[37:59] than pray now if prayer is enough then
[38:01] then praise God I'll do
[38:05] that so if you're not wounding somebody
[38:07] enjoy your freedom but all but also
[38:09] always pay attention where you're eating
[38:11] and where what who the people that are
[38:13] around you be cautious of them verse 31
[38:17] whether therefore ye eat or drink I love
[38:19] this verse or whatsoever you do do all
[38:23] to the glory of God hallelujah so we
[38:26] glorify God while keeping the
[38:28] Commandments and also while enjoying our
[38:30] liberties because we have pure
[38:33] consciences
[38:36] Hallelujah all right so can everybody
[38:37] see the balance there Paul cuts it off
[38:40] he says you cannot drink both cups but
[38:43] if you're in a spot where it's not so
[38:44] much it's not obvious and there's no
[38:46] Pagan sin going around and there's no
[38:47] dirty stuff around and don't let also
[38:50] don't let your Liber to be
[38:52] judged right so just use the wisdom of
[38:54] the Holy Spirit verse 32 give none
[38:57] offense neither to the Jews nor the
[38:59] Gentiles nor to the Church of God even
[39:01] as I please all men in all things not
[39:03] seeking my own profit but the prophit of
[39:05] many that they may be saved so what does
[39:08] this all boil down to let's try to have
[39:10] some people saved praise God Jesus said
[39:12] few there be that find it there's going
[39:14] to be very few people save think about
[39:15] that all these people that claim to go
[39:17] to church and they put Jesus stuff there
[39:19] on their Facebook on Sunday or whatever
[39:20] their Twitter or ex or whatever they do
[39:22] not many of them are going to be saved
[39:25] very few are going to be saved that's
[39:27] why we should always think about what
[39:28] are we doing in public what do people
[39:30] see about our lives when I was on
[39:31] Facebook I was very careful what I put
[39:33] on there because I didn't want to cause
[39:35] people to stumble now are there always
[39:37] going to be haters yes someone's always
[39:39] drinking haterade always it's like it's
[39:42] on constant tap at their house they got
[39:44] water they got haterade right next to it
[39:46] so they they probably mix them up all
[39:48] day that's probably what they do you
[39:50] know you can't please evil spirits right
[39:53] so that's why you really got to know
[39:54] where you
[39:55] stand right like we talked about with
[39:58] holidays and Liberties you really got to
[40:00] know where you stand with Liberties
[40:02] praise God all right
[40:05] Hallelujah and we just want to see
[40:07] people saved I think when I was leaving
[40:09] Saturday Zion might have saw me I shook
[40:11] so many hands I talked to the people my
[40:13] my main thing was make sure you love
[40:14] Jesus Christ with all your heart God
[40:16] bless you uh I was telling the married
[40:18] couples there there's two people that
[40:19] are going to get married I went up there
[40:20] to the brothers I said Brothers Keep
[40:21] Jesus at the center of your life uh Keep
[40:24] Jesus at the center of your marriage you
[40:25] have a good marriage you can't do
[40:26] anything unless you put Jesus at the
[40:28] center of your marriage and they said
[40:29] okay brother okay brother okay I'm
[40:31] preaching Adam there so even though I
[40:33] didn't preach on Sunday I did preach
[40:34] Saturday praise God very short sermons
[40:36] though sometimes probably people wish I
[40:38] preach them short here
[40:41] too so we should focus on pleasing
[40:43] others so that they might be saved God
[40:46] may God save some people hallelujah
[40:48] that's all we want to see just some
[40:49] people saved by the grace of
[40:51] God okay
[40:53] now oh Glory now I would that was my
[40:56] previous is ending but okay all right
[41:00] I'm going to greet the live streamers
[41:02] love you all we're to call live stream
[41:03] God bless you all love you all that's 40
[41:05] minute sermon right there praise God I
[41:06] knew it was going to be short
