[37:23] so thank we the only one we're in love
[37:26] with today love with the world and Jesus
[37:28] we're just in love with Jesus praise God
[37:31] I forgot to do the tithes and offerings
[37:32] you're turning about when we pray for
[37:34] the word we also pray for tizen often so
[37:37] pardon me on that it's good to be now so
[37:42] Lord we sure appreciate the prayers of
[37:43] the saints
[37:44] appreciate everybody pressing out to the
[37:46] house of the Lord and let's go to
[37:49] Ecclesiastes chapter 3 I like to look at
[37:50] times and seasons I told you on
[37:53] Wednesday there's 150 quotes on times
[37:55] and seasons after report I'm on number
[37:58] 116 I think by God's grace
[38:01] so getting through there I was reminded
[38:06] by you know just talking with my wife I
[38:08] was reminded that some of the greatest
[38:10] times I've had in the Lord is where I've
[38:13] taken a few words and done key a key
[38:17] word search through brother Graham's
[38:18] quotes and just seen
[38:19] everything that he said about a topic
[38:21] those are some of the most blessed times
[38:23] because you see from the beginning to
[38:25] end if God changes revelation on it or
[38:28] was it the same revelation all the way
[38:29] then you see all the times he connects
[38:32] that same thought to different
[38:33] scriptures oh it's glorious
[38:36] it's like brother Ram said you know
[38:39] Moses wrote the old Paul wrote the new
[38:42] and then God had to send another prophet
[38:44] seventh angel out to the desert to get
[38:47] the revelation of both of them so it's
[38:49] so true is such a tremendous blessing to
[38:52] serve God in this message I see
[38:55] perfection praise the Lord that's the
[38:57] blood of Jesus Christ this is the
[38:59] beating word of the hour okay good thank
[39:01] you for getting that I do have quotes
[39:03] Malachi so after we read the text here
[39:06] you can switch over so Ecclesiastes
[39:11] chapter three verse one I did look at
[39:15] just this thought again I'd like to
[39:16] continue going through all these quotes
[39:18] from God's prophet at the end I'd like
[39:21] to do a little questions and answers
[39:22] I've had a couple inquiries this week
[39:25] about my just my conviction on a few
[39:29] topics I like to share those and then
[39:30] the service so I am going to try to set
[39:32] a timer to do 45 minutes of preaching
[39:33] and then maybe 15 minutes on questions
[39:35] and answers and if there's more
[39:37] questions answers after that we'll just
[39:38] do a separate service on that I always
[39:41] like questions and answers I sure
[39:42] appreciate them brother branham love to
[39:45] know what was on the people's hearts he
[39:47] really liked and I'd like to know that
[39:48] too what is on the people's minds and as
[39:50] usual you'll see our our questions this
[39:52] week are on sanctification again there
[39:55] are usually on sanctification they're
[39:57] really not on you know the Holy Ghost or
[39:59] the seals or usually just sanctification
[40:01] which that's a great thing because God
[40:03] is continually sanctifying us each and
[40:06] every day we never get done with
[40:08] complete sanctification Paul says you'll
[40:11] be sanctified and preserved blameless
[40:13] unto the coming of the Lord so it's a
[40:15] process we go through throughout our
[40:18] lives please ask these three one let's
[40:23] read verse one together one two three to
[40:25] everything there is a season and a time
[40:28] to every purpose under the heaven now I
[40:32] want to read one more scripture
[40:33] I want to go to Psalms chapter one this
[40:37] is a different thought I'd never heard
[40:39] before till I was studying this morning
[40:41] or the RAM takes Psalms chapter one and
[40:44] he applies it to the messenger of the
[40:47] age and he was showing how God brings
[40:51] forth his fruits or the the fresh word
[40:54] of God in their season and I'd never
[40:56] seen that thought before I became from
[40:59] spoken word his original seat I never
[41:01] really thought about that so let's read
[41:03] Psalms chapter one I'll read verses 1
[41:08] and 2 and let's read verse 3 together so
[41:10] let me read one into myself blessed is a
[41:12] man that walketh not in the counsel of
[41:14] the ungodly nor standeth in the way of
[41:16] sinners nor sitteth in the seat of the
[41:18] scornful but his delight is in the law
[41:21] of the Lord and in his law doth he
[41:23] meditate day and night now let's read
[41:25] verse 3 if we can together one two three
[41:28] and he shall be like a tree planted by
[41:31] the rivers of water that bringeth forth
[41:34] his fruit in his season his leaf also
[41:37] shall not wither and whatsoever he doeth
[41:40] shall prosper
[41:42] amen let's bow our heads one more time
[41:43] for the reading of the word if you have
[41:44] a need on your heart just make it known
[41:46] unto God Heavenly Father we've come
[41:48] before you we've read your word Lord and
[41:50] it's symbolic of the breaking of bread
[41:52] when Jesus was with Cleopas and his
[41:55] friend and and it was through that
[41:57] breaking of the bread that they knew
[41:58] this was the same Jesus Lord our prayer
[42:00] humbly this morning is that you would
[42:03] break your word and preach it to us in
[42:04] such a way that we would know that's the
[42:06] same Jesus who reviewing himself and has
[42:09] so often broken his bread broken his
[42:12] word through revelation to me in times
[42:14] past let it be you Lord God that it not
[42:16] be me use me I'm a yielded vessel I
[42:19] don't want any part of my own thought
[42:20] let it be your thoughts from your word
[42:22] Lord God and bless each and every person
[42:24] Lord we again we believe with all of our
[42:26] hearts we put all of our faith in divine
[42:28] healing for all these individuals that
[42:30] need a healing touch we believe and so
[42:33] we come against Satan with the armor of
[42:34] God and we chop away his unbelief and we
[42:37] just believe Lord you're going to touch
[42:38] these individuals and that there be
[42:40] victory and a shot of victory in the
[42:42] camp of the the Kings Camp Lord this
[42:44] morning
[42:45] and we'll give you all the glory and
[42:46] father be with these ties and offerings
[42:49] bless them Lord to thy thy service Lord
[42:51] God that they can do thy bidding on this
[42:53] earth Lord in our humble little ministry
[42:55] and we'll give you all the glory in
[42:56] Jesus Christ name the church said Amen
[43:00] god bless here's being seated praise the
[43:01] Lord so we like to look at this thought
[43:12] here of times and seasons like to
[43:16] continue on this by the grace of the
[43:19] Lord and as I said I think you'll
[43:20] probably understand you know one of the
[43:22] purposes behind this series this is part
[43:24] 11 yeah is so that everybody can see
[43:27] what time and season they're in and then
[43:29] they can know their purpose their gifts
[43:31] in life I have it on my heart I'm gonna
[43:34] just let it let you know now so you'll
[43:35] be ready I haven't done this yet but I
[43:38] want to make a spiritual list chart now
[43:40] they do this in denominations but we
[43:41] should do it too and put definitions of
[43:44] each of the nine gifts of the Spirit and
[43:46] then examples from our own lives and
[43:48] ministries and then that may give you an
[43:49] insight into what gifts are in your life
[43:52] and then brother Branham gives other he
[43:55] gives other kind of gifts things or
[43:57] callings he said some people were born
[43:59] to cast out Devils which that may be
[44:00] divine healing actually that be miracles
[44:02] he said some people were prayer warriors
[44:05] he said some are firebrands he says some
[44:08] are more scholarly like so you know
[44:10] within that those nine gifts of the
[44:11] Spirit we want to be able to find what
[44:13] what gifts we have how many one know
[44:15] what gifts you have in your life well
[44:17] look at that almost every hands up you
[44:18] know who doesn't want to know I mean
[44:19] don't you want to be faithful with what
[44:21] God's place in your lap who would want
[44:24] to you have to face Jesus and say well
[44:26] you gave me a gift but I was too afraid
[44:28] to know what it was he would say that
[44:30] that's wicked that's all that's awful I
[44:33] gave you a gift and you didn't want to
[44:35] invest in it and you buried it in the
[44:36] earth we don't want that Church we want
[44:39] to be faithful with the gifts God has
[44:40] given to us and so if you love the Lord
[44:44] I think you'll feel the same way because
[44:46] we love Jesus and we just want to please
[44:48] Jesus
[44:49] so let's um I just a little the slide
[44:54] for me let's look at our
[44:57] thoughts here these are quotes on
[44:59] brother branham's speaking about times
[45:01] and seasons there's 150 of them and I'm
[45:03] on 113 I just saw the slide earlier I'm
[45:05] on 113 so I just know it's a nice way to
[45:10] start it and God set the time and has a
[45:13] season or a purpose for everything that
[45:15] he does
[45:15] there's nothing happens just
[45:17] accidentally to those who love the Lord
[45:19] and are called according to his calling
[45:22] see we are predestinated and everything
[45:25] works just right for that because he
[45:27] cannot lie and he said that was so that
[45:29] everything has its time its season and
[45:31] it has its way and God is behind every
[45:35] move aren't you glad and sometimes you
[45:38] think that everything is going wrong
[45:39] it's up to us that those things are put
[45:42] upon us trials and wanderings it's
[45:45] testing to see how we will react on an
[45:48] action so again just be encouraged every
[45:51] trial that God allows in your life is
[45:55] God wants to see how you're gonna react
[45:57] how you gonna react to being sick are
[46:00] you gonna curse God you're gonna blame
[46:02] somebody else they're gonna get
[46:03] depressed how you gonna act if you lose
[46:05] your job like our brother Hosea here has
[46:07] lost his job God wants to see how he's
[46:10] gonna react
[46:10] how are you act if people leave the
[46:13] church well God wants to see how I'll
[46:14] act as a pastor as I've fed people
[46:16] faithfully for months and years and then
[46:18] to see them leave God wants to see how
[46:20] I'll respond will I have the right
[46:23] attitude or not right some people in
[46:27] your family come against you say evil
[46:29] things about you God wants to see how
[46:31] you're gonna react or maybe it's a good
[46:34] thing maybe get a victory in your life
[46:35] and God wants to see how are you gonna
[46:37] give me all the glory
[46:38] like the lepers that's had lepers are
[46:40] you gonna come back and give me glory or
[46:42] you're you're just gonna take all the
[46:43] glory yourself
[46:44] amen even in the blessing church even
[46:47] the blessings God wants to see how he
[46:49] gonna respond to his word to the trials
[46:52] to the blessings and we know that if we
[46:54] love God I mean love God
[46:55] there's no accidents this was that all
[46:58] these prayer requests are not an
[47:00] accident they're for the glory of God
[47:02] and just let me just think just give you
[47:05] a word of encouragement - I've already
[47:07] got some good testimonies back from
[47:09] people who've bought my books my
[47:11] schoolteacher from when I was in school
[47:13] she's 58 years old now she's reading my
[47:16] book and saying I've the light bulb is
[47:18] going off in so many ways I never
[47:19] thought about it before and I even
[47:21] warned her beforehand I said you know
[47:23] this book says a woman shouldn't cut her
[47:26] hair and we should have wear makeup
[47:27] because I know she cuts her hair and
[47:28] wears makeup
[47:28] and she's like well I like to be
[47:30] challenged she says I like to go in the
[47:31] unknown things oh my and I got another
[47:36] one just saying uh they were so excited
[47:38] to read it and and thankful and they're
[47:40] already already seeing that all these
[47:41] prophecies about the falling away are
[47:43] true so this is helping people see what
[47:46] time we are living in amen people that
[47:49] honestly I never physically couldn't
[47:51] reached my old school teacher because
[47:53] I'm physically not there they don't even
[47:55] live where I used to live but see this
[47:57] has already been using to promote people
[48:00] and I wrote it you know I wrote it
[48:02] knowing this it's not an accident I was
[48:04] writing that I felt led of the Holy
[48:05] Spirit to write that so I'm looking for
[48:08] the testimonies of Lord willing for them
[48:09] looking for the testimonies to roll in
[48:11] and even if not remember brother Graham
[48:14] said the reason God does these things
[48:15] God brings his word is that so men and
[48:18] women are without excuse on the day of
[48:20] judgment but ma'am said I just read it
[48:22] this small or listened to yesterday
[48:23] junction of Time 1956 by the Rams that
[48:26] God makes his word so simple whether
[48:28] through miracle or preaching God makes
[48:30] it so simple so that men and women are
[48:32] without excuse on the day of judgment it
[48:35] is so simple the truth of God is so
[48:37] simple we just can't overlook it we just
[48:39] can't put our nose up in the air and
[48:40] think we're oh we got it all figured out
[48:42] we've got to humble ourselves and
[48:44] meditate on the things of God now the
[48:48] first one I try to put them in Bible
[48:50] order because you know like I went
[48:51] through a hundred quotes this your
[48:53] yesterday and today because there's 150
[48:55] so tried to put him in order of the
[48:58] Bible but man talked about the time and
[49:00] season for Abraham and lot to separate
[49:03] and he says look at the junction between
[49:06] the separation of right and wrong with
[49:08] Abraham what a time Abraham seemed like
[49:11] that he'd got the raw deal it seems like
[49:13] tonight maybe because you're separating
[49:15] yourself from the things of the world
[49:16] that you got the raw deal right I think
[49:20] I'm Amen you know how he's been thrown
[49:22] out by his family literally kicked him
[49:24] out of the house and
[49:25] I seem like a raw deal but look what
[49:26] God's done since then amen glory and
[49:31] it's a pleasure for you to live with me
[49:32] brother let me just tell you that I love
[49:35] how you can live with me for a month or
[49:36] however long it was that was such a
[49:37] blessing it might look like the raw deal
[49:40] but it wasn't God knew all about it
[49:44] don't be weary in well-doing for a new
[49:46] season you shall reap he that endure to
[49:51] the end Jesus said the same shall be
[49:53] saved
[49:54] just keep looking on keep moving slowly
[49:56] God knows what he's doing well the only
[49:59] one that gets in a hurry boy I can say
[50:01] amen to that I get in the hurry I get I
[50:05] I get impatient I want it just to happen
[50:08] right now
[50:09] but brother ham says don't get in a
[50:11] hurry not him he let the Hebrew children
[50:14] walk right into the fiery furnace before
[50:16] he even turned to page over to write a
[50:18] new article brother Aaron describes this
[50:22] sure God's in no hurry
[50:25] he knows what he's going to do we don't
[50:28] but we believe it by faith because he
[50:30] said he'd do it now watch God moving to
[50:33] Abraham setting out there to old dry
[50:36] country member lot church moved lot
[50:39] moved toward the watered country right
[50:43] Sodom the Bible said was lush like the
[50:46] Garden of Eden so Abraham was stuck in
[50:49] the dry season now he still had a lot of
[50:52] cattle but it wasn't the ideal situation
[50:55] for him and brother Ram picks it up to
[50:58] see the time and season here he said the
[51:03] old dry country the cattle getting all
[51:05] poor Sarah the most beautiful in all the
[51:07] land there she was sending up their old
[51:09] now one hundred years old right out
[51:12] about it Abraham old sitting out there
[51:14] under tree just before the junction of
[51:16] time what taken place he says angels
[51:20] appeared on the earth
[51:21] haha amens they were in the form of men
[51:25] and God Himself appeared on earth with
[51:29] his angels oh I hope this don't go too
[51:31] far over you catch it
[51:33] now since this was preached what here in
[51:35] 56 brother Branham was just starting to
[51:38] see how
[51:38] his gift was the son of man that was
[51:41] just like the son of man that visited
[51:43] Abraham and Sarah so he goes off in a
[51:45] whole bunch of words I just cut off the
[51:46] quote because he's just he's not really
[51:48] hitting it yet it hadn't just been but
[51:50] he he sees that this has to happen
[51:52] before the end time and then later
[51:54] church six times brother Graham said
[51:56] thus saith the Lord this ministry is the
[51:58] last sign to the Gentiles before the
[52:00] rapture once it struck him in 1961 it's
[52:04] thus saith the Lord he announced it in
[52:06] Indiana in Ohio he announced it in
[52:10] California by almost the whole nation
[52:12] there got to hear it he said write this
[52:14] down in your Bible this is the last sign
[52:16] thus saith the Lord and it was because
[52:19] chapter 19 God destroyed Sodom and
[52:21] Gomorrah chapter 20 Abraham went down to
[52:23] the ger ear and there was no more signs
[52:26] God just had to correct Abimelech from
[52:28] taking the wrong woman
[52:30] even though Abraham lied God did it God
[52:33] was so merciful and then a lay it to his
[52:35] charge God never punished him for that
[52:38] and then 20 and then chapter 21 here
[52:42] comes Isaac on the scene amen that was
[52:45] the last sign God showed to Abraham and
[52:48] Sarah before Isaac arrived so see Church
[52:53] it all worked in time and season so God
[52:56] had to separate Abraham and lot lot
[53:00] seemed to get more rich he had more
[53:02] natural blessings and Abraham still had
[53:04] you know he was still wealthy man but he
[53:06] wasn't in the rich plush everything's
[53:08] easy his wife kept getting older so much
[53:12] show that she lied to God and laughed
[53:14] that God said Oh
[53:15] Sarah's gonna have a baby she was soul
[53:18] can I say I said she woke up on the
[53:20] wrong side of the bed that morning she
[53:23] was so out of her wits that she laughed
[53:25] Oh like God's gonna give me a body
[53:27] change like I'm gonna go in the rapture
[53:29] and we can do the same thing all like
[53:32] like the rapture could happen in 2019 it
[53:35] could happen in 2019 and if you laugh
[53:38] Sarah don't be discouraged God will
[53:40] change your laughing from doubt to
[53:42] laughing with laughing of joy amen
[53:45] because that's what Isaac means is
[53:47] laughter amen and so she's laughing at
[53:50] the end all praise God God
[53:52] that's my fault God look past my doubt
[53:54] and saw my desire amen
[53:57] God was true to the covenant that he
[53:59] gave me God kept his word God will give
[54:02] me a body change I might have doubted it
[54:04] in denomination I might have doubted at
[54:06] the beginning when I first came in the
[54:07] message but God's going to visit me and
[54:09] they can real so that we can produce the
[54:13] promised son amen oh you know he's going
[54:16] to do a church amen
[54:18] sometime he's going to change the doubt
[54:20] and saves heart to faith hallelujah and
[54:23] we'll see the body change gay men it has
[54:26] to happen someone's gonna have a pretty
[54:28] sin sister when he's somebody it's gonna
[54:30] catch that brother Jose somebody's going
[54:33] to catch the faith that it is me called
[54:35] to a body change because I recognize God
[54:38] in flesh discerning the thoughts intents
[54:41] of the heart
[54:41] I recognize God's last sign best save
[54:44] the Lord to us and will receive a body
[54:46] change amen boring
[54:49] other people can say he's a good man a
[54:51] good prophet a lot of miracles but they
[54:54] can't live what he preached from this
[54:56] holy book right here aren't you glad we
[54:57] can live from this holy book that's the
[55:00] whole point it was the message the word
[55:02] the absolute the word to get back to the
[55:04] word live the word amen that's why the
[55:06] seals were opened so we can live the
[55:08] full Word of God but it seemed like even
[55:13] though I've I've separated from the
[55:15] denominational Church or I've left that
[55:17] message church that was had no Holy
[55:18] Ghost there uh-huh or I've separated
[55:20] myself from my family that just our
[55:22] denominational it may seem like it's not
[55:26] the right season the church everything's
[55:28] gonna work out in God's timing season
[55:30] amen
[55:31] everything's gonna work out hallelujah
[55:35] hmm
[55:39] this kind thought kind of struck me that
[55:41] could be wrong on this but I believe
[55:44] that God in flesh in Genesis 18 was the
[55:47] former rain and then when he went God
[55:51] Himself came to visit her that would
[55:53] have been the latter rain that's right
[55:56] praise God
[55:57] the former rain was the teaching rain
[55:59] God in a man discerning the thoughts
[56:02] intents of the heart
[56:03] glory and he promised I'll visit you
[56:05] again hallelujah brother may have said
[56:08] this message will introduce Jesus Christ
[56:11] to the world amen how to do so he's got
[56:14] to come again he's got to be introduced
[56:16] again and it's going to be through the
[56:18] latter rain amen
[56:19] because the showdown is between Jesus
[56:21] Christ and denominations hallelujah well
[56:25] thank you Laura I didn't even study I
[56:26] had no thought of that that's fresh from
[56:28] the throne this morning amen oh thank
[56:30] you Lord amen
[56:31] the former aide in latter rain will take
[56:35] place hallelujah no program said lot and
[56:39] his family now watch when we see these
[56:45] things that Jesus said would take place
[56:47] look at him as I quoted last night as it
[56:50] was in the days of Sodom so shall be in
[56:51] the coming of the Son of man just before
[56:53] the destruction of Sodom Abraham the
[56:55] church called out spiritual I'm not
[56:56] quoted again here there was standing out
[56:58] there to themselves living hard but they
[57:00] were right with God keeping God first
[57:04] how many could say you're living in a
[57:06] hard time I don't know how I can get you
[57:09] I don't know how it can get much more
[57:11] harder but we know it is right
[57:15] spiritual difficulties trying to keep
[57:17] your fire burning right but that's just
[57:20] the nature that's just the nature of
[57:22] this age and when the enemy comes in
[57:24] like a flood god is gonna raise up a
[57:26] standard I was gonna raise up an
[57:28] anointing against this amen
[57:29] he promised to living hard but they were
[57:35] right with God so glad we can put God
[57:37] first this morning lot was enjoying
[57:41] since the program breaks into this and
[57:42] shows how lot because he was a foolish
[57:45] virgin he had to be enjoying some of the
[57:47] things in the city
[57:48] for example sitting in the gate of the
[57:50] city he realized that he was the mayor
[57:53] brother Rams
[57:53] now it might have not been called mayor
[57:56] but if you read the Bible anyone who sat
[57:58] in the gate of a city was an elder
[58:00] that's actually the word they use elders
[58:02] of the city so he had got to such a
[58:05] place where he enjoyed the people
[58:07] patting on the back how you doing there
[58:09] the church also that means anyone who
[58:12] came into the city had to come through
[58:14] him so think of the things that he saw
[58:18] coming in that city he had to see to
[58:20] homosexuals coming in that city now
[58:22] those things would have grieved him
[58:24] right because he he was eventually
[58:25] grieved but he enjoyed some of that
[58:29] that's why he and his wife were so
[58:31] agreed to go down there in the first
[58:33] place they both had a little love for
[58:34] sin isn't that the foolish version their
[58:38] little foolish right because they don't
[58:39] die out all the way they're not wise
[58:43] they don't die they're still a little
[58:44] foolish when it comes to the Holy Ghost
[58:46] they don't die out other way they still
[58:48] want to live a little more of their
[58:49] lusts and their desires for the world so
[58:52] they enjoy sin for a season like most of
[58:57] the people are today calling themselves
[58:59] Christian if you love the world or
[59:00] things of the world the love of God it's
[59:02] not even in you let me set my timer I
[59:04] forgot to remember the Bible says that
[59:07] this is what Moses did Moses rejected
[59:10] the pleasures of sin for a season but
[59:14] eventually lot got to the place where
[59:16] he's a righteous man he knew was wrong
[59:17] and everything he saw and heard he was
[59:20] vexed or tormented every day by what he
[59:22] saw in her but there's a little bit of
[59:24] him that enjoyed those things okay now
[59:29] it also proves it because later he got
[59:31] drunk and his daughter slept with him
[59:33] now what kind of man will get drunk a
[59:36] man who's not a wise virgin right Noah
[59:41] wasn't that he wasn't the type of Enoch
[59:42] he was righteous man but he still liked
[59:45] to drink alcohol and if you got the Holy
[59:47] Ghost you won't get drunk other than on
[59:50] the Holy Ghost see because that you know
[59:58] that's not the real drunkenness the real
[1:00:00] drunkenness is God's Spirit flowing
[1:00:02] through you in love enjoy and learn
[1:00:04] suffering in peace and
[1:00:06] mercy and truth empower that's the real
[1:00:09] drunkenness of the Holy Ghost so true so
[1:00:14] brother Adam picks it up
[1:00:15] the reason they separated yeah they're
[1:00:17] having no strife here but it manifested
[1:00:19] that lot it was the time of season for a
[1:00:23] lot to go have an easier richer life and
[1:00:25] enjoy some of the sins for season now
[1:00:30] Church all of you want to make more
[1:00:32] money right I want to make more money
[1:00:33] but not for worldly pleasures never
[1:00:38] understand I'm not going after a
[1:00:40] Mercedes Benz but when my 2005 car when
[1:00:44] it's not here it's at home when that 224
[1:00:46] oh I'm sorry a 2005 car with 150,000
[1:00:49] miles when that eventually tanks I just
[1:00:51] want to get a replacement car I'm not
[1:00:53] looking for a BMW to be backwards wmb
[1:00:57] where your matter
[1:00:57] I'm not although that's interesting but
[1:01:00] I'm not looking for a $60,000 I just
[1:01:03] want something that will drive and get
[1:01:05] me to work so see there's nothing wrong
[1:01:08] with one to get a pay raise or something
[1:01:10] like that
[1:01:10] it all depends on your motive and
[1:01:13] objective so if you get a bigger high
[1:01:17] paying job and then you don't pay your
[1:01:18] tithes and offerings something's wrong
[1:01:20] with that but if God's like God has led
[1:01:24] me every time I get a pay raise I
[1:01:25] increase my tithes and offerings because
[1:01:29] you realize I wouldn't even have this
[1:01:31] without Christ he's the one who lets me
[1:01:35] go to work he's the one that keeps me
[1:01:37] strong he's put a hedge about my enemies
[1:01:40] they may he's protected me he's the
[1:01:43] ruler of fire round about me hey man oh
[1:01:45] yeah he's a wolf Holy Ghost fire they
[1:01:49] can't get to me the Devils can't get to
[1:01:51] me because Christ is protecting me amen
[1:01:54] and it's not because of me it's because
[1:01:56] of God's grace amen but I must be
[1:01:59] faithful right we must be faithful in
[1:02:02] our decisions God's looking for a
[1:02:04] faithful wife hallelujah
[1:02:06] so let me just balance that just to say
[1:02:09] that Church there's nothing wrong with
[1:02:10] putting a little more money if you got
[1:02:12] bills to pay
[1:02:14] remember ultimately it's God we saw that
[1:02:17] in Cleese yesyes it's God who makes you
[1:02:19] rich it's
[1:02:20] who makes you poor right it's God behind
[1:02:24] it so we have to be faithful to God no
[1:02:26] matter which condition we find ourselves
[1:02:27] in there's a season to get and there's a
[1:02:30] season to lose how many can say amen to
[1:02:31] that now the next example brother visits
[1:02:36] us over and over again as I've gone
[1:02:38] through quotes is Naomi so we find that
[1:02:41] she begins alone to go back because they
[1:02:45] heard that a great revival had broke out
[1:02:48] why didn't they only leave because it
[1:02:50] was a drought and if you notice they
[1:02:53] only returned and barley season the
[1:02:55] Bible suggests at the time of the
[1:02:57] harvest in other words when there was a
[1:02:59] great revival going on
[1:03:01] spiritually applying it she returned
[1:03:04] just in that season oh there used to be
[1:03:11] a dried up there but now it's revival
[1:03:14] going on up there let's go back to the
[1:03:16] promised land
[1:03:17] let's go back to the word how did oh
[1:03:19] yeah let's go back there because there
[1:03:20] was a revival going on around that word
[1:03:25] did I skip one nope now when I pray that
[1:03:30] you'll be merciful to those who are sick
[1:03:31] and afflicted wait did I skip one no I
[1:03:35] didn't okay now look how great Lanham
[1:03:37] applies and they owe me going back to
[1:03:39] the promised land he applies it like
[1:03:41] this there are those here Lord who need
[1:03:43] the heat the healing touch Oh Lord you
[1:03:45] did restore Bethlehem to all her former
[1:03:47] glory you restore during the time of
[1:03:49] depression when she was sick you brought
[1:03:51] her right back and brought Naomi at
[1:03:53] barley season sober mmm types a drought
[1:03:57] in Bethlehem as a sickness enters into
[1:04:00] our bodies and God lets us recognize
[1:04:04] that we just like Naomi if we are if if
[1:04:08] we leave that land of heat of good
[1:04:10] health were allowed to go back to that
[1:04:12] land amen and now father we pray that
[1:04:17] you'll bring every Naomi glory we've got
[1:04:20] one this church might say we got more
[1:04:22] than one they owe me sitting over there
[1:04:23] with her wonderful children each and
[1:04:25] every one of us are now only brother Ram
[1:04:26] says in other words you can see how you
[1:04:29] need to be like Naomi in this part of
[1:04:32] your life
[1:04:34] you'll bring every Naomi and everyone
[1:04:36] that's in here that is in need so how
[1:04:39] many have needs this morning well your
[1:04:42] Naomi that's how brother man applied it
[1:04:45] see I pray oh God Oh Lord it's just body
[1:04:49] season this great body loaf that was
[1:04:51] seen coming rolling down the hill in the
[1:04:52] camp an enemy that was with Gideon a
[1:04:54] barley row so barley season represents
[1:04:57] harvest which represents revival I'll
[1:05:01] play God you will bring that great body
[1:05:02] loaf into this building now and that it

[1:05:58] different story I thought I'd bring it
[1:05:59] to you so you could see the time and
[1:06:01] season and now you know what the story
[1:06:04] came out what was it speaking of
[1:06:05] mike-mike ayah years had passed but the
[1:06:08] time had come that the word to be for
[1:06:10] that word to be fulfilled my Chi is
[1:06:12] prophecy about a.m. when the season
[1:06:14] rolls around don't you worry the crop
[1:06:17] will be there so my kinda said if you
[1:06:20] come back at all hey hab then the Lord
[1:06:23] never spoke to me and they have smacked
[1:06:25] him said smack that boy put him in a
[1:06:26] prison when he sat there for years
[1:06:28] brother Branham says but he said there
[1:06:31] came a time when a.m. was going to see
[1:06:33] that that was the Word of God and when
[1:06:36] that came to pass my Chi of course he be
[1:06:38] sad a have died but he would rejoice in
[1:06:40] the fact that God keeps his word the
[1:06:43] crop of the seed of prophecy that was
[1:06:45] planted would then be harvested
[1:06:48] and that's a larga to see when we start

[1:09:25] crop of it amen it's exactly right amen
[1:09:31] Zechariah is the priests program it
[1:09:33] Labor's on this one so then when I see
[1:09:38] their just before the end time come
[1:09:39] there was an honest man by the name of
[1:09:41] Zechariah who had prayed earnestly for a
[1:09:43] child that what happened a angel
[1:09:45] appeared on earth for the first time
[1:09:47] since Malachi hundreds of years and an
[1:09:51] angel appeared and told Zacharias
[1:09:53] America was going to take place and he
[1:09:56] believed it now look at this church he
[1:09:58] didn't believe it at first
[1:10:00] but God absolutely because it's so oh
[1:10:03] well he had Abraham Isaac and had Sarah
[1:10:05] and all them turn back there to believe
[1:10:07] and hand at the temple but he failed to
[1:10:09] see it now let me stop let me see it let
[1:10:14] me let me show you just real simply
[1:10:15] before the angel came Zacharias was
[1:10:19] praying Oh God give us a child did he
[1:10:23] believe it yes or no yes when the angel
[1:10:28] said you're gonna have a child that he
[1:10:29] believed it not at that moment so he
[1:10:31] believed it before in the friends that
[1:10:33] angel is like when is this gonna happen
[1:10:37] so the angel says you'll be dead or you
[1:10:40] you'll be dumb until he's born for a
[1:10:42] little season so a season can be nine
[1:10:44] months and then afterwards did he
[1:10:48] believe it yes he's the one that wrote
[1:10:50] John and the Bible said as soon as he
[1:10:52] wrote that the Holy Spirit struck him
[1:10:54] and he started praising God amen see he
[1:10:59] said the angel said it'll be failed in
[1:11:01] its season and you're going to be silent
[1:11:03] because you doubted in my presence he
[1:11:09] believed
[1:11:10] we prayed for it believed it doubted it
[1:11:13] but then God says well since you believe
[1:11:16] it at the beginning you're gonna believe
[1:11:18] it eventually amen
[1:11:20] in other words I'm gonna forgive your
[1:11:22] unbelief oh god help us to take that
[1:11:25] encouragement that if we believe in
[1:11:27] doubt it believe in doubt it
[1:11:28] God is gonna help us believe Amen God
[1:11:32] will help you believe hallelujah think
[1:11:38] about all those people that believe
[1:11:39] Abraham believes and didn't struggled
[1:11:42] and lied Sarah but laughed and believed
[1:11:44] try to interpret but eventually God
[1:11:46] brought it to passing in other words I
[1:11:50] believe said unbelief does not hinder
[1:11:52] God even believers even you're not
[1:11:57] unbelief does not hinder God let's let
[1:12:00] times and seasons go look for the season
[1:12:02] go another season
[1:12:03] and pretty soon God will bring the seas
[1:12:06] in the past when you and I believe it
[1:12:08] hey man oh that's such an encouragement
[1:12:12] to me see immediately after he wrote it
[1:12:16] his mouth was open and he started
[1:12:18] praising God oh praise the Lord
[1:12:20] I've never thought for nine months
[1:12:22] that's kind of like us sometimes I
[1:12:24] haven't been able to shout in church for
[1:12:25] nine months but now I can go for God
[1:12:28] amen
[1:12:31] I've been able to testify to my neighbor
[1:12:33] for nine months I mean now I can testify
[1:12:36] to the glory of God he's over my mouth
[1:12:38] he strengthened my faith and he praise
[1:12:44] the Lord so God's gonna get you to
[1:12:47] praise him from your lips
[1:12:49] he's gonna get it he said an angel and
[1:12:53] he couldn't even believe it in the
[1:12:54] presence of an angel mercy God is gonna
[1:13:02] get praised Church let me go back as I
[1:13:04] skipped a quote oh that was God a long
[1:13:07] time ago he can't do that today and then
[1:13:09] angel said I'm Gabriel who stands the
[1:13:11] Prince of God my words will be fulfilled
[1:13:13] in their season because that you doubted
[1:13:17] me
[1:13:17] you'll be dumb to the day the baby's
[1:13:18] born you'll cause named John amen the
[1:13:21] junction time had come
[1:13:23] amen Lori the time it go it's time to
[1:13:28] believe and even if your belief is a
[1:13:30] little weak he'll make sure you believe
[1:13:32] by the end of it that's true with Sara
[1:13:35] Abraham that's true with everybody no
[1:13:38] flesh shall glory in Christ's presence
[1:13:41] brother Branham won't take glory from
[1:13:43] Jesus John Wesley Paul no each of us are
[1:13:47] constantly continually struggling we
[1:13:50] fall short but no one will get glory but
[1:13:53] Jesus Christ in other words he's gonna
[1:13:55] help you believe amen
[1:13:57] it is hard and it is season hallelujah
[1:14:03] it just depends on the time for they men
[1:14:07] it just depends on the time you say I
[1:14:11] believe in the rapture but I just can't
[1:14:12] do this or that we'll just stay with God
[1:14:14] stay get through this season and wait
[1:14:16] for the next season wait for the next
[1:14:19] season to roll around because the the
[1:14:22] time of junction is going to come the
[1:14:25] time of change is going to come in our
[1:14:27] lives
[1:14:28] if we just hang on to faith hang on to
[1:14:31] God and we know those we know the same
[1:14:34] gods I'm really not hanging on to God
[1:14:36] God is holding on to me right we know
[1:14:38] that too
[1:14:39] but in we have at least we have some
[1:14:42] responsibility to hang on as well we
[1:14:44] have some of that ultimately it's God
[1:14:46] hanging on us but yes but you and I have
[1:14:48] a responsibility to hold on ourselves
[1:14:49] keep believing there's a delicate
[1:14:52] balance there now he says John the
[1:14:58] Baptist he came out of the wilderness
[1:14:59] jesus said this Elijah which was spoken
[1:15:01] to come restore all things and it made
[1:15:04] Elijah made John dressed like just like
[1:15:06] Elijah perhaps acted like him but John
[1:15:08] did no miracles and following John came
[1:15:10] Jesus not preaching too much not much of
[1:15:12] a preacher but was performing signs and
[1:15:15] wonders as a vindication that John's
[1:15:17] ministry was in season and have
[1:15:20] indicated so Jesus came after John's
[1:15:26] ministry with signs miracles and wonders
[1:15:28] to vindicate what John had already been
[1:15:31] doing and brother Branham said that he
[1:15:35] was that
[1:15:37] John he said now so remember what signs
[1:15:40] in America wonders did John do it was
[1:15:42] just the preaching of the word it was
[1:15:44] huge revival services of John say repent
[1:15:48] confess your sins
[1:15:50] stop follow those devil preachers down
[1:15:52] there and the church said like he used
[1:15:56] their Serpent's their generation of
[1:15:59] vipers come to God's Word
[1:16:01] repent of your sins and be baptized for
[1:16:04] six months that was a miracle the fact
[1:16:08] that he could stand up against all those
[1:16:10] unholy rulers and yet he was a holy man
[1:16:15] was a miracle and he had baptismal
[1:16:18] service after baptismal service after
[1:16:20] baptism of service amen and he paved the
[1:16:23] way for Christ to come and do all the
[1:16:25] miracles glory I have a quote let me
[1:16:30] show you both have said preaching me
[1:16:32] preaching the Holy Ghost today is
[1:16:33] America you thought well I thought well
[1:16:36] maybe but there's no miracle say a
[1:16:38] church me preaching the Holy Ghost is a
[1:16:39] miracle can I show it to you real quick
[1:16:42] I saved it under my Joseph Branham file
[1:16:44] now all due respect because they say
[1:16:47] there's no preaching I know it's really
[1:16:48] small but brother Aaron said its
[1:16:49] repeating again today when when man
[1:16:52] pounding away at the gospel the Lord
[1:16:53] Jesus Christ preaching the baptismal
[1:16:56] ghost getting the people ready for the
[1:16:58] coming judgments or shield from it and a
[1:17:00] modern church people are laughing and
[1:17:01] making fun saying there's nothing of it
[1:17:03] and the days of miracles pass it's a
[1:17:05] miracle
[1:17:05] a signpost we're at the junction hey
[1:17:08] hallelujah it's America brother says
[1:17:12] that men can still stand today in this
[1:17:15] wicked age and preached the baptism of
[1:17:17] the Holy Ghost God doing a miracle this
[1:17:20] morning amen
[1:17:22] then I won't compromise and say well as
[1:17:25] long as you believe God sent a prophet
[1:17:27] you've got the baptism Holy Ghost what a
[1:17:30] lie right even here believe John was a
[1:17:35] prophet
[1:17:36] Herod a man who made two women and
[1:17:39] doctor her even he could recognize that
[1:17:42] Elijah anointing that doesn't mean
[1:17:44] anything it means who will obey what
[1:17:47] Elijah said that's what that's the real
[1:17:49] question
[1:17:50] that's the real proof who will live by
[1:17:53] every word that proceeds out the mouth
[1:17:55] of God
[1:17:57] the little did you know America was
[1:17:59] taking place this morning I'm glad God
[1:18:01] can use me for a miracle
[1:18:03] because I'm the least and I'll take no
[1:18:05] glory in it it's all God's leadership by
[1:18:07] the Holy Ghost it's not me but it says
[1:18:11] God's miracle it's not me it's God's
[1:18:12] miracle that men will still preached the
[1:18:14] baptism all he goes today if you're not
[1:18:17] born again if you don't feel like you
[1:18:19] can serve God fully if you don't feel
[1:18:21] like crisis dwelling in your soul then
[1:18:23] you need to come right here I sit on
[1:18:25] your chair and cry and beg and call it
[1:18:28] to God until he fills you with power
[1:18:30] from on high
[1:18:30] well you know you'll never compromise
[1:18:32] where you're always fall in love with
[1:18:34] Jesus amen hallelujah we're not ashamed
[1:18:38] to be a Christian you're not ashamed to
[1:18:41] stand on the Word of God but instead
[1:18:44] your life pulsates it amen
[1:18:46] you're like this / made with the power
[1:18:49] love of Jesus Christ that no matter what
[1:18:53] season you're in when it's dry when it's
[1:18:56] rich and rainy no matter what season
[1:18:57] you're in you're living for Christ and
[1:19:00] you live by every word proceeds out of
[1:19:02] the mouth of God
[1:19:04] Brewery and that my friends was a
[1:19:07] miracle we just witnessed it that's what
[1:19:14] your prophet said did not believe it -
[1:19:15] it's maybe just a different kind of
[1:19:18] miracle than what we'd expect program
[1:19:21] said Jesus birth was in the right time
[1:19:23] in season now bro in this quote just
[1:19:27] focuses I didn't find any other quotes
[1:19:29] on this because I didn't have really
[1:19:30] time to look I was just trying to say in
[1:19:32] this channel brother and focuses on the
[1:19:34] on the evil people had to be there at
[1:19:37] this time in season when Jesus was born
[1:19:38] now as a birth of our Blessed Lord Jesus
[1:19:41] as most unnatural to see how God worked
[1:19:43] in this manner because no other time
[1:19:46] would have ever worked in all the
[1:19:47] history of the world is that striking
[1:19:49] Jesus could not have been born today in
[1:19:51] other words Jesus could not have been
[1:19:54] born in the days of Abraham northern a
[1:19:57] is America all those getting close real
[1:19:59] close or sir
[1:20:02] or Daniel and they are they don't want
[1:20:04] to see them aside no wonder the Messiah
[1:20:06] decoded the Nord ah David it David did
[1:20:08] so much he danced around the heart just
[1:20:10] lay no God send the blessings of God
[1:20:12] amen
[1:20:13] no no he would have loved it but it was
[1:20:17] a first time in season it could not have
[1:20:19] been in that time because my lamb says
[1:20:21] see and it had to be just exactly at
[1:20:23] this time the time Jesus was born he
[1:20:27] said and a few moments let's just look
[1:20:28] right at the season so I skipped a
[1:20:31] paragraph no this is next paragraph it
[1:20:33] was a time when it went ahead the
[1:20:35] murderer was king so God had to have a
[1:20:37] murderer as a ruler in order for Jesus
[1:20:42] to be born because that's what
[1:20:44] Revelation chapter 12 prophesied right
[1:20:47] it had to be this heartless man had to
[1:20:50] be king at that time for we're
[1:20:52] acquainted with the scriptures that said
[1:20:54] he slew all the children from 2 year-old
[1:20:55] down trying to find the Christ and it
[1:20:58] had to be just at that time now it seems
[1:21:00] like brother Aaron were pretty close
[1:21:01] right with all these abortion fanatics
[1:21:03] out there the infant decide where they
[1:21:05] call in where the damn Democrats not
[1:21:08] many of them and probably some
[1:21:09] Republicans tube of Democrats they
[1:21:11] weren't laws fast so they can kill the
[1:21:12] baby outside the womb that's what
[1:21:15] they're trying to get now think about
[1:21:16] that
[1:21:17] that's evil that's wicked that's from a
[1:21:20] hail that's that's from Satan that's a
[1:21:22] murdering demonic evil possessive spirit
[1:21:24] but look what they had in their day they
[1:21:28] had it where you could kill him two
[1:21:29] years old see that to see Jesus could
[1:21:34] not be born a day like today we've got
[1:21:37] too much respect for babies right I mean
[1:21:40] right he had to be born in a day when
[1:21:43] there was an even more wicked evil
[1:21:46] murderous person ruling and that was
[1:21:48] Herod he sue all the children from zero
[1:21:52] down trying to find Christ and it just
[1:21:54] had to be just at that time now that's
[1:21:57] the negative side God had to have evil
[1:21:58] murders God also has some faithful
[1:22:00] shepherds out there in the field that
[1:22:04] will be shipping their flocks faithfully
[1:22:05] at night while they're had given babies
[1:22:07] to or giving birth to their little
[1:22:08] babies and Shepherds out there that were
[1:22:10] praising God and Shepherds that would
[1:22:12] hear angels sing and say go
[1:22:15] let's go tell somebody about these
[1:22:17] angels amen oh yeah they're shepherds
[1:22:21] that weren't ashamed the angels sing and
[1:22:24] go back and tell everybody about it
[1:22:26] there's eight we saw angels tonight the
[1:22:28] Messiah is born the saviours born let's
[1:22:31] go come and see about him and then he
[1:22:33] had them shepherds that were so humble
[1:22:35] they believed the Angels and they would
[1:22:37] believe in the presence of the Angels
[1:22:39] Zacharias died in the presence of angels
[1:22:41] but God had to have shepherds and I hope
[1:22:43] I'm one of those shepherds cuz I'm a
[1:22:44] shepherd in the spiritual - god help me
[1:22:46] to be a shepherd that can see the angels
[1:22:48] and then tell everybody about it amen
[1:22:51] hallelujah they also had to have a
[1:22:54] virgin girl there Mary who would
[1:22:59] meditate on the word behold a virgin
[1:23:01] shall conceive she would hear that word
[1:23:03] preach and then be able to meditate in
[1:23:05] such a way where the angel could come
[1:23:07] and say Mary it's you you're gonna
[1:23:10] conceive the word in your heart and she
[1:23:12] would not know she would just say be
[1:23:13] done to me according to the prophecy of
[1:23:16] the hour amen see because she was there
[1:23:19] she was a believer at the right time in
[1:23:22] season God knew she believed so she had
[1:23:25] to be there at the right time
[1:23:26] God predestinated her to be there hey
[1:23:30] man what a what a consolation to us amen
[1:23:33] that we are right where God wants us to
[1:23:36] be we just got a raise higher in Christ
[1:23:38] that's right never would have worked in
[1:23:43] the other part of history Jesus being
[1:23:46] born ain't or Shepherds that would
[1:23:48] receive angels and never - worked this
[1:23:52] is the only time now Peter I got a few
[1:23:57] more minutes here he said well it might
[1:23:59] have been Simon November when they were
[1:24:01] testifying on the boat before the Jesus
[1:24:03] calm the waves and beam it be not afraid
[1:24:05] as I who knew something not those things
[1:24:08] - that raised up and said well that's
[1:24:10] very good job but what bothered me first
[1:24:12] was when Andrew come and told me there's
[1:24:13] a prophet down there well I could hardly
[1:24:15] believe that but I remember my daddy
[1:24:16] told me that when the Messiah come that
[1:24:19] he would be a prophet and when I looked
[1:24:24] there that day with Andrew I looked at
[1:24:25] him in the face and he looked at me and
[1:24:26] said your name is Simon you are the son
[1:24:29] of Jonas and that settled it forever for
[1:24:33] me I knew that that was him because
[1:24:35] we've had 400 years without this prophet
[1:24:37] and here he comes on the scene and I
[1:24:40] know it was season the time was right
[1:24:42] and that was bound to be him oh so there
[1:24:47] was something inside of Peter when he
[1:24:49] saw Jesus discern his heart this has got
[1:24:52] to be the Messiah my dad told me about
[1:24:53] that generations have told me the
[1:24:56] Messiah's going to come and when he
[1:24:57] comes hilde certain he'll be like unto
[1:24:59] Moses he'll discern the thoughts and
[1:25:01] intents of my heart and when it happened
[1:25:03] when the light and the ministry struck
[1:25:05] him he believed it ain't no same thing
[1:25:07] happened about the Amen when soon as he
[1:25:09] heard the message he believed in Amen ha
[1:25:12] ha same night I was a message I believed
[1:25:15] I could explain it but I believe it amen
[1:25:19] some people takes no longer I need a
[1:25:21] couple of more exposures to believe it
[1:25:23] but you'll see it if you're a child of
[1:25:26] God you'll see the message hallelujah
[1:25:30] the time was right that was bound to be
[1:25:32] him now remember Jesus didn't do it for
[1:25:34] four or five times he did it once and
[1:25:35] that said it they were ready they knew
[1:25:37] that that was he I love this one the
[1:25:40] woman at the well when the Samaritan
[1:25:44] went when that miracle was done it when
[1:25:46] Jesus told her found her fault and told
[1:25:48] her what her fault was see that's why
[1:25:50] people won't receive brother branham
[1:25:51] they won't let brother bran tell them
[1:25:53] they're wrong about cutting their hair
[1:25:54] about wear a makeup about being a real
[1:25:57] man and not going to movie shows and
[1:25:59] sleeping with women in lesson after
[1:26:00] Marilyn Monroe posters they're not mad
[1:26:02] enough to receive the message right they
[1:26:06] don't want to be told where they're
[1:26:07] wrong but if you can be told where
[1:26:09] you're wrong and still love that person
[1:26:11] you're getting in the way of wisdom now
[1:26:15] she never said she was he was reading
[1:26:17] her mind they knowed it was a time of
[1:26:19] season for that Messiah to come and the
[1:26:22] Messiah would do that how he knows that
[1:26:24] she said we know that when the Messiah
[1:26:26] cometh he will do this so brother amen
[1:26:30] there have been preaching not only to
[1:26:32] Jews the Messiah's gonna do this the
[1:26:34] Messiah he's coming he was they were
[1:26:35] getting ready generations before it not
[1:26:37] all
[1:26:37] wasn't Jews it was with Samaritan the
[1:26:41] whole world knew was coming the
[1:26:43] astrologers knew it was coming over
[1:26:45] there in Babylon because they traveled
[1:26:47] two years to get the Christ amen
[1:26:49] they knew it it was all around the world
[1:26:52] and so you know in 1995 which was what
[1:26:59] how many years ago about 25 years ago
[1:27:01] almost this major series book series
[1:27:05] came out called Left Behind how many
[1:27:07] remember that I was a freshman in high
[1:27:10] school and the first one came out in
[1:27:12] 1995 my freshman year church they sold
[1:27:16] 80 million copies and now it's there's
[1:27:19] three or four movies about it there's a
[1:27:22] cartoon about it there's all these
[1:27:23] things 80 million that's just books what
[1:27:29] about all the ebooks and I didn't get
[1:27:30] those numbers I was looking on Wikipedia
[1:27:32] getting information let's say a billion
[1:27:35] let's say a billion a billion people
[1:27:37] have been influenced by this book called
[1:27:41] Left Behind and in the plot it's about
[1:27:43] true believers who are raptured
[1:27:44] including the Pope right and then all
[1:27:51] these people are left behind they get
[1:27:53] saved they get born again which that's
[1:27:56] the Jew not not not Gentile and they
[1:27:59] start saving people get ready for the
[1:28:01] Antichrist to be revealed why is that
[1:28:04] popular now why didn't that come out
[1:28:06] earlier like 200 years ago because this
[1:28:09] is the season for the rapture this was
[1:28:13] never popular beforehand but now it's
[1:28:16] it's so it's so popular they can make
[1:28:18] movies of it and you know the one about
[1:28:20] the Dwayne Johnson The Rock was in that
[1:28:23] one about California sink in a few years
[1:28:24] ago remember that of course you never
[1:28:26] saw it hopefully you didn't see it but
[1:28:28] they're there they're making movies
[1:28:30] about California sinking hey man
[1:28:32] movies about me left behind what is it
[1:28:34] it's the season so if all this
[1:28:37] information is out there
[1:28:39] if this there's this awareness of the
[1:28:41] rapture there's got to be somebody who's
[1:28:43] going to receive the genuine revelation
[1:28:45] of it amen that somebody's going to be
[1:28:48] you and I hey by the grace of God amen
[1:28:53] why because he came looking for me I
[1:28:55] didn't go looking for him but man said
[1:29:02] you can know the season through Israel
[1:29:03] think I'll stop after this one because I
[1:29:04] yeah well there's my tent right there
[1:29:05] I'll just try to do five more minutes
[1:29:09] knowing the season there Israel by man
[1:29:11] says now remember this quote this
[1:29:13] scripture has got to be balanced with
[1:29:14] 1st Thessalonians 5 I preached this last
[1:29:16] Sunday night but at the times it seasons
[1:29:18] brethren you have no need so a holy
[1:29:21] gopher Christian doesn't need someone to
[1:29:24] come around and tell them oh it's the
[1:29:26] time it's the season because the Holy
[1:29:28] Ghost inside of them is already
[1:29:29] preparing them right because the bottoms
[1:29:32] of the Holy Ghost will guide you into
[1:29:34] he's your comforter he's your teacher
[1:29:36] he's your advocate and yes he teaches
[1:29:38] you through preachers his brother Mannis
[1:29:41] at all there's a question should we have
[1:29:42] preachers if the Holy Ghost our teacher
[1:29:44] but I said of course if not then you got
[1:29:46] to get rid of the Ephesians chapter 4
[1:29:48] which says the five gifts will perfect
[1:29:50] the bride of Jesus Christ so you can't
[1:29:53] have one scripture contradict another
[1:29:54] they all got to be in harmony together
[1:29:57] amen glory he said I want you to see
[1:30:06] what the day I'm sorry if you want to
[1:30:08] see the day of the month look on the
[1:30:09] calendar if you want to see what day and
[1:30:11] the season is coming in Lord watch where
[1:30:13] Israel setting that's God's timepiece
[1:30:17] there she is setting in her homeland the
[1:30:19] oldest flag in the world the six point
[1:30:21] Star of David the oldest flag in the
[1:30:22] world flies again for the first time for
[1:30:24] twenty or twenty five hundred years yes
[1:30:26] sir yes the ensign that was to be lifted
[1:30:28] up Israel Palestine blossoming as a rose
[1:30:31] you read the magazines and watch how
[1:30:32] they come back way down in Iran and so
[1:30:36] forth
[1:30:37] let me see on my quotes here let me
[1:30:40] slides rather yeah let's stand to our
[1:30:43] feet here I want to close with this
[1:30:44] thought here I heard Perry green
[1:30:47] mentioned this institute years ago I
[1:30:49] never really studied out to a few years
[1:30:50] ago there is this Institute in Jerusalem
[1:30:53] and they're called the Temple Mount
[1:30:54] faithful that's their nickname but
[1:30:56] they're also called the temple Institute
[1:30:59] and there are nonprofit organization and
[1:31:01] they have one mission their ultimate
[1:31:05] goal is to see Israel rebuild the holy
[1:31:08] temple on Mount Moriah in Jerusalem in
[1:31:11] accord with the biblical command now I
[1:31:16] was going through their news and their
[1:31:18] most recent news is they put out this
[1:31:20] beautiful book about how the Temple of
[1:31:23] Jerusalem must be built perfectly
[1:31:25] they've done all this research their
[1:31:27] most recent product is a book about
[1:31:31] restoring the temple makes me happy
[1:31:36] chairs amen that they are getting ready
[1:31:38] why are you happy because I know as soon
[1:31:41] as they start digging we're either going
[1:31:43] up or we're already going up amen
[1:31:46] because God won't deal with both at the
[1:31:49] same time God may let the moon but as
[1:31:52] soon as they start sacrificing worship
[1:31:54] and bread I believe we'll be out of here
[1:31:56] by God's grace their main goal this is
[1:32:04] all is their hole they're dedicated just
[1:32:05] to every aspect of the Holy Temple you
[1:32:07] can watch their leaders got this big old
[1:32:09] gray beard he's so Orthodox their women
[1:32:12] wear long skirts amen the men wear pants
[1:32:16] the women wear long skirts okay these
[1:32:19] are the ones that I believe are going to
[1:32:20] get the Holy Ghost because they have
[1:32:22] such a burden I believe these are some
[1:32:24] of the hundred forty-four thousand I
[1:32:25] could be wrong but I believe this group
[1:32:28] because they were there back they want
[1:32:29] to get back to the law get back to the
[1:32:31] word get back to building get our temple
[1:32:35] back get the worship of God back there
[1:32:38] website says they cry Church they cried
[1:32:41] the Western Wall and they write their
[1:32:42] prayers on paper and they go squeeze it
[1:32:45] in that temple there they squeeze it
[1:32:50] they praise they God build the temple
[1:32:51] and their website says they have prayed
[1:32:54] three times a day for over 50 years that
[1:32:58] God will rebuild that temple amen
[1:33:01] just like the Muslim play pray five
[1:33:03] times a day the Jews pray three times a
[1:33:05] day like Daniel only we could have that
[1:33:08] kind of dedication amen now we pray
[1:33:11] without ceasing don't get me wrong
[1:33:13] but like the dedication of getting down
[1:33:14] physically and praying three times a day
[1:33:16] do you do it well probably not we
[1:33:18] probably don't do it as much as we
[1:33:19] should our communion is constant right
[1:33:22] but I like the dedication of them bowing
[1:33:25] three times a day so for 50 years or
[1:33:29] since 1948 whatever is over that it's
[1:33:31] over 50 years then 70 years they prayed
[1:33:34] they push these papers in your God
[1:33:36] rebuild the church rebuild the church
[1:33:38] and God saying I will I just got to get
[1:33:41] a few more my broad members into the
[1:33:42] Holy Ghost there's a few more red
[1:33:45] members I still got to get dressed and

[1:35:08] hope you're encouraged searcher Abraham
[1:35:11] had to be separated the season to go
[1:35:13] through dry dry seasons but God visited
[1:35:15] him in the next season
[1:35:17] Zechariah believed at first but then had
[1:35:19] a spell of doubting but God caused him
[1:35:22] God raised his face we can believe
[1:35:25] you and I will be no different there's
[1:35:28] times we'll be so on fire they'll be
