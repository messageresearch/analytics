[3:41] the message that he he brought forth is
[3:44] it okay if I don't say say that every
[3:46] time I say a quote
[3:48] so uh
[3:51] so let's uh get started in Hebrews
[3:54] chapter 9 and and verse 28.
[3:58] it says so Christ was once offered to
[4:01] Bear the sins of many
[4:03] and unto them that look for him
[4:06] shall he appear the second time without
[4:08] sin unto salvation
[4:11] and in Matthew chapter 25
[4:15] we'll start at the first verse
[4:19] how many is looking for him how many is
[4:21] just waiting and watching and praying
[4:23] for that day to come
[4:25] I bet he's longing for that day amen
[4:29] so Matthew 25 starting in the first
[4:32] verse
[4:34] it says then shall the Kingdom of Heaven
[4:36] be likened unto ten virgins
[4:39] which took their lamps and went forth to
[4:41] meet the bridegroom
[4:42] and five of them were wise and five were
[4:45] foolish
[4:47] they that were Fullers took their lamps
[4:49] and took no oil with them now we know
[4:52] the oil represents the Holy Spirit right
[4:54] we know that
[4:56] so the lamp is a it's a symbol of body
[4:59] or the holder of the oil
[5:02] so also we could we could see that the
[5:05] lamp is God's word for did not David say
[5:08] Thy word is a lamp unto my feet and a
[5:11] light unto my path so
[5:14] many people might have the word they
[5:16] might carry the Bible with them they
[5:17] might claim that they're a Christian
[5:18] well we've got the word in this hour
[5:20] we've we've we've got the word and
[5:23] nobody else has the understanding that
[5:24] we do but a lot of times what happens is
[5:27] they might have the word but they don't
[5:28] have the Holy Spirit to go with the word
[5:30] those two are inseparable amen they have
[5:33] to go hand in hand you can't have the
[5:35] word you can't have the Revelation
[5:36] without the holy spirit amen so you have
[5:39] to have the holy spirit amen
[5:42] so let's continue in the sixth excuse me
[5:45] Fifth Fifth verse it says while the
[5:47] bridegroom tarried they all slumbered
[5:50] and slept and at midnight there was a
[5:53] cry mate behold the bridegroom cometh go
[5:56] ye out to meet him
[6:00] then all those virgins arose and trimmed
[6:02] their lamps and the Fuller said unto the
[6:05] wise give us of your of your oil for our
[6:08] lamps are gone out see people don't want
[6:10] to do the work that's necessary in this
[6:12] day they just want everything given to
[6:14] them they wanted every they want
[6:15] everything handed to them they don't
[6:16] want to put forth the effort that it
[6:18] takes
[6:20] hmm
[6:24] verse 9 it says but the wise answered
[6:26] saying not so lest there be not enough
[6:29] uh for us and you but go ye rather to
[6:33] them that sell and buy for yourselves
[6:35] and while they went to buy the
[6:37] bridegroom came
[6:39] and they that were ready
[6:41] what's that say they that were ready
[6:44] went in with him to the marriage and the
[6:47] door was shut afterward came also the
[6:50] the other virgin saying Lord Lord open
[6:53] to us
[6:54] but he answered and said verily I say
[6:56] unto you I know you not
[6:58] watch therefore for you know neither the
[7:01] day nor the hour and that's so very
[7:04] important
[7:05] you know you don't know you know neither
[7:08] the day nor the hour We're in the the
[7:11] son of man cometh Nobody Knows the day
[7:15] nor the hour so if somebody's coming and
[7:17] saying well the Lord's going to come
[7:18] back in in
[7:20] 2022 before the end of the year we know
[7:23] that that's that's not a that's not a
[7:25] true statement because who knows even
[7:27] Jesus In the Flesh when he was here in
[7:29] his flesh he didn't know
[7:31] what did he say but only the father
[7:33] knows
[7:34] so when a man comes and says this is
[7:36] when it's this is going to be the time
[7:38] of the end we know that that's a false
[7:40] statement amen let's look to the Lord in
[7:42] prayer
[7:44] most Graces heavenly father just thank
[7:46] you so much for the privilege to be able
[7:48] to come here and Minister your word one
[7:50] more time
[7:51] but Lord as I stand here as a I'm a
[7:54] nobody oh God I'm just a a vessel in
[7:56] your hands that you that I I open myself
[7:59] for you to use father I pray that you
[8:00] just speak to my brothers and sisters
[8:02] this morning and just help them and
[8:04] guide them and Lord God I just pray that
[8:05] something would be said that would that
[8:07] would be have a changing moment in their
[8:09] lives not to say that brother Brian said
[8:11] this but it's the Lord spoke to my heart
[8:13] about such and such Lord whatever might
[8:15] be said I just pray that nothing that
[8:17] would be spoken here that I pray that it
[8:19] would not be anything contrary to your
[8:22] word or to the teaching the Lord God or
[8:25] just pray that you would just be with me
[8:26] and protect my lips or guard my lips and
[8:29] protect their people protect their ears
[8:31] Lord God but father I just pray that the
[8:33] truth would come forth and uh again
[8:35] we're just wanting to make a difference
[8:37] in somebody's life Lord we ask all this
[8:40] in the name of Jesus Christ amen and
[8:42] amen you may be seated
[8:45] yeah
[8:48] just kind of like to
[8:50] uh I guess you could say like a little
[8:53] bible study
[8:56] but uh just a bible study on the
[8:59] Midnight Cry
[9:02] so first Thessalonians in chapter four
[9:06] uh everybody knows that that's a uh the
[9:10] Rapture scripture pretty much
[9:12] does the word rapture
[9:15] does it ever appear in the Bible no it
[9:18] does not but the uh it alludes to the
[9:22] Rapture just the definition of what
[9:25] Rapture means that's what's in the
[9:26] scripture is being caught up caught away
[9:28] and uh from from this earth into the
[9:31] presence of the Lord so first
[9:33] Thessalonians chapter four
[9:35] starting in the 13th verse it says but I
[9:38] would not have you to be ignorant
[9:40] Brethren see he wants to instruct people
[9:42] he wants to give them the truth and that
[9:44] that's what we we want to do in this day
[9:46] we don't want people to be ignorant amen
[9:48] we don't want people to be ignorant of
[9:49] God but we also don't want people to be
[9:51] ignorant of the adversary's devices
[9:53] either so we want to expose him as as
[9:55] much as we can
[9:57] but I would not have you to be ignorant
[9:59] Brethren concerning them which are
[10:01] asleep
[10:02] that ye sorrow not even as others which
[10:04] have no hope
[10:06] for if we believe that Jesus died and
[10:08] rose again we believe that right even so
[10:11] them also which sleep in Jesus will God
[10:14] bring with him
[10:16] for this we say unto you by the word of
[10:19] the Lord that we which are alive and
[10:22] remain unto the coming of the Lord shall
[10:24] not prevent them which are asleep for
[10:27] the Lord himself
[10:29] for the Lord himself shall descend from
[10:31] heaven with a shout with the voice of
[10:33] the Archangel and with the Trump of of
[10:36] God and the dead in Christ shall rise
[10:38] first
[10:39] then we which are alive and remain shall
[10:41] be caught up together and here's where
[10:43] it's the Rapture time caught up together
[10:45] with them in the clouds to meet the Lord
[10:47] in the air and so shall we ever be with
[10:50] the Lord that's where I long to be
[10:53] wherefore Comfort one another with these
[10:56] words
[10:57] and we go on and and just to read this
[11:00] quote he says I have a tape or well it's
[11:03] a movie film that was filmed in
[11:04] Jerusalem where we were asking the Jews
[11:06] when they were returning back from Iran
[11:09] and many places a few years ago about
[11:12] five years ago of course it's much
[11:13] longer than that for us packing their
[11:16] loved ones on their back and bringing
[11:17] them off off of ships
[11:20] and out of airplanes and so forth coming
[11:22] back ask them the question are you
[11:25] returning to the Homeland to die
[11:28] they said we are coming to see the
[11:30] Messiah
[11:33] when you see Israel that tree putting
[11:35] forth its buds it's a great enzyme so
[11:38] when the Jews are coming back and
[11:39] searching for the Messiah this was back
[11:41] in uh I can't remember the year but uh
[11:45] 65 and earlier when the Jews uh excuse
[11:49] me I think it was what 1947 1941 47 I'm
[11:52] sorry I can't remember it I always get
[11:54] those mixed up but when the Jews became
[11:57] in their own Nation once again they had
[11:59] their own currency they had their own
[12:00] government so that constituted them to
[12:02] have their own government again so when
[12:05] they when they were all coming back to
[12:07] Israel when they're looking for the
[12:08] Messiah you know the time of the
[12:10] Gentiles is almost done with so this is
[12:12] the stuff that we have to pay attention
[12:14] to because when he turns to them the
[12:16] Gentile dispensation is done
[12:18] so he says or they said we are coming to
[12:21] see the Messiah when you see Israel that
[12:23] tree putting forth its buds it's a great
[12:25] enzyme the time is at hand when Israel
[12:28] becomes a nation and she's a nation
[12:30] today we see things happening that uh to
[12:33] the world it's just as blind to them as
[12:36] it was in the days of Noah see they
[12:38] couldn't see the truth that Noah
[12:39] preached back in back in the into
[12:41] deluvian age they couldn't see that
[12:44] so the same today the people can't see
[12:47] the signs of the time so it's just as
[12:50] blind to them as it was in the days of
[12:52] Noah but to we who look for Christ who's
[12:56] looking for Christ
[12:57] but to we who look for Christ the second
[13:00] time it's an enzyme that he is soon
[13:03] coming we see something fixing to happen
[13:06] and depends on what you're looking at
[13:09] now Noah Knew by the word of God that
[13:12] there was coming a flood by faith he saw
[13:14] it he knew that he he knew that was
[13:17] going to be because God's word promised
[13:19] it now Noah himself by faith
[13:23] did he have something there a script to
[13:25] read off of he didn't have anything he
[13:27] didn't have the word like we have the
[13:28] word today so by faith that's what he
[13:32] that's all he had to go on was by faith
[13:35] and and so how easily we dismiss how
[13:38] important faith is in this day that's
[13:40] what we have to hold on to by faith are
[13:43] you saved amen
[13:45] see there's power in faith but we just
[13:48] so under use it
[13:50] that we don't see the the uh the
[13:54] potential that that the power of faith
[13:57] has amen so
[14:00] again now no one knew by the word of God
[14:02] that there was coming a flood by faith
[14:05] he sought he knew that was going to be
[14:07] because God's word promised it now Noah
[14:09] himself by faith saw what God's word
[14:11] said but the world could not see it
[14:13] because it could not be scientifically
[14:15] proven that there was water up in the
[14:18] sky but no one knew it was there because
[14:21] God said so
[14:23] foreign
[14:27] he says that's the church
[14:30] the bride that called out today knows
[14:32] that the coming of the Lord is at hand
[14:34] regardless of how much we've been able
[14:36] to go in in progress and so forth and
[14:38] succeed in splitting of an atom
[14:41] and sending a radar message to the Moon
[14:43] that means nothing to the believer
[14:46] only a sign that the coming of the Lord
[14:49] is at hand we see Nations breaking in
[14:51] the Nations coming falling apart and the
[14:54] world coming apart and the church move
[14:57] coming apart he even went so far to say
[15:00] in the church move is coming apart so
[15:03] where do we stand now are we staying
[15:05] together are we staying unified or are
[15:08] we coming apart what is it that we're
[15:10] looking at what is it that we're putting
[15:11] our effort toward him
[15:14] but we see Nations breaking in the
[15:15] Nations coming falling apart in the
[15:17] world coming apart and the church move
[15:18] coming apart then we are taught that we
[15:21] receive a kingdom which cannot be moved
[15:24] but as these things begin to happen the
[15:27] church binds itself together Tighter and
[15:29] Tighter by the word of God it's a great
[15:31] day that we're living in amen everybody
[15:34] is looking for something whether it's
[15:37] people out in the world looking for
[15:38] pleasure the things the the pleasure of
[15:40] this world of what it has to offer or or
[15:43] we're looking into the word and getting
[15:45] a closer relationship with him making
[15:48] sure that we're ready amen making a
[15:50] preparation for in Revelations it says
[15:52] the bride maketh herself ready right
[15:55] so you might be looking today to a time
[15:58] that you get home to eat your dinner
[16:00] there might be a picnic this afternoon
[16:02] that you that you're going to take your
[16:04] family to there might be something
[16:05] another next week that you're looking
[16:07] for a neighbor to come or some friend
[16:09] but everybody is looking for something
[16:13] and as a group of Believers today
[16:14] assembled together we want to fix our
[16:17] thoughts our principles and things upon
[16:19] the coming of the Lord is that right
[16:20] looking for Christ who shall appear the
[16:24] second time without sin unto salvation
[16:26] to those that believe and are looking
[16:28] for him to come God here by the writer
[16:31] is inviting us to view this and to look
[16:33] at it the writer says here that we look
[16:36] for Christ the second time to see him as
[16:40] he is
[16:41] and now we know that the word is Christ
[16:44] amen so in the beginning was the word
[16:46] and the Word was with God and the Word
[16:49] was God in Hebrews 13 8 13 8 says he's
[16:54] the same yesterday today and forever
[16:56] therefore it's the word that we look to
[16:59] then for it is the expression of what
[17:02] God is you ever wonder what well what is
[17:05] God how what are his attributes well if
[17:07] you read into the word it tells you what
[17:09] his attributes are but you've got to
[17:11] look at the right thing
[17:13] and when God came in Christ he was the
[17:15] expression of what God was and whatever
[17:17] he was he ever remains because he's
[17:20] Eternal and he cannot change
[17:25] now kind of like to turn your attention
[17:28] to three minutes to midnight anybody
[17:30] ever search the the message or listen to
[17:33] the messages and all of a sudden brother
[17:35] Brent will make this statement he wants
[17:36] three minutes to midnight
[17:38] does that sound familiar to anybody
[17:41] he says uh do you know it could be
[17:44] possible before we leave this building
[17:46] that this Earth could be blowed up
[17:49] scientific says it's midnight right now
[17:53] time for it to happen all scientists and
[17:56] everything is shaking everywhere and
[17:58] remember the church goes home before
[18:00] that takes place then how close is the
[18:03] coming of the Lord be ready be prepared
[18:05] for we don't know what minute or hour he
[18:08] may appear it might be at any time we're
[18:11] receiving our last sign to the church of
[18:13] his coming now it's later than we think
[18:15] right so
[18:18] again in Matthew 25 and verse 6 it says
[18:21] and at midnight there was a cry made
[18:23] behold the bridegroom cometh and going
[18:25] out to meet him everybody know what time
[18:27] midnight is right it's 12 a.m zero hour
[18:30] but in the scripture here it's not
[18:31] saying that it's the the hour of
[18:34] midnight now see that and it's awfully
[18:37] often perceived that it's going to be
[18:39] midnight you know 12 a.m that's not so
[18:42] because if if that if that was so then
[18:44] the other scripture that says no man
[18:46] knoweth the the day nor the hour so it's
[18:49] not a specific hour of midnight what
[18:51] midnight means is it's the midst of
[18:54] night it could be in the middle of the
[18:56] night
[18:56] so it's not a specific hour because
[18:59] again no men know at the hour except my
[19:01] father
[19:03] midnight also represents Darkness evil
[19:06] and destruction and we have so much evil
[19:09] and weakness wickedness and destruction
[19:10] in this day in this day this is the time
[19:13] of midnight because there's so much
[19:15] wickedness around us
[19:17] oh my it seems to be more evil than any
[19:20] other age of course in the medieval
[19:22] times they had their evil and they had
[19:24] their wickedness and they had all that
[19:26] other stuff back then but what is it in
[19:28] this day
[19:29] is it a different evil no it's the same
[19:31] evil it just seems like it's it it's
[19:34] more abundant
[19:38] so brother brother Branham mentions the
[19:40] the uh Minutes to Midnight he mentions
[19:44] that 70 different times
[19:46] so he believed what they were saying uh
[19:49] what is referring to is what the
[19:52] scientists were saying most of the time
[19:53] he says uh that there are three minutes
[19:55] to midnight
[19:57] uh there are places where he said that
[19:59] it was two minutes to midnight
[20:01] in a couple places he mentions that it
[20:03] was one minute but I I wrote I read a
[20:06] quote here uh just a couple minutes ago
[20:08] where he said it was midnight right now
[20:11] so a couple places he says it's midnight
[20:13] right now
[20:15] um I'm not going to say that he made a
[20:16] mistake but sometimes he he said it was
[20:19] three minutes sometimes two sometimes
[20:21] one and and sometimes right now so it
[20:24] varied
[20:27] which I am
[20:29] losing my voice already
[20:35] uh
[20:36] but I don't I don't know if you know
[20:38] what he's referring to when he says
[20:39] three minutes of midnight he's talking
[20:41] about
[20:42] uh with the scientists where the these
[20:45] people that get together in some kind of
[20:46] uh I don't know if club or I don't know
[20:51] what it is but it's a bunch of
[20:53] scientists or smart people that get
[20:54] together
[20:56] but uh
[20:57] it's a Doomsday Clock and this clock
[20:59] represents uh total obliteration by
[21:03] mankind
[21:05] uh it can go forward it could go
[21:07] backward depending on world events so it
[21:10] varies on what's going on in our day
[21:12] such as nuclear tension Global tension
[21:17] this Doom Doomsday Clock initially
[21:19] started in 1947 so you have all these
[21:23] you have the the top five world powers
[21:25] is uh the U.S China Russia uh Germany
[21:31] the UK so you have all the you have
[21:34] these five top powers and every one of
[21:37] them's competing to be the top power
[21:39] whether it's economic and or military
[21:42] weapons power they're all competing to
[21:44] be the top Nation
[21:46] so there is tensions we see that there's
[21:48] tension with with us and uh attention
[21:51] with Russia there seems our our
[21:53] relationship with Russia has been so up
[21:56] and down up and down we'll get along and
[21:58] then they argue they'll get along and
[21:59] then so uh there's there's nothing
[22:01] concrete as a as a true Ally with Russia
[22:04] because it don't make no mistake about
[22:06] it if they can get ahead and they'll lie
[22:09] steep steal cheat whatever it takes to
[22:11] get ahead and uh you know backbite
[22:14] whatever it takes uh to become the
[22:16] number one world power so we see that
[22:18] these uh the nations are competing
[22:20] against one another so the tensions are
[22:22] high you see right now with Russia and
[22:24] Ukraine tensions are high the U.S and
[22:26] China China tensions are really high
[22:29] right now
[22:30] well so you throw Iran in there and uh
[22:32] you know through the uh Afghan War and
[22:35] the war that we had for for years the
[22:37] tensions are still pretty high you know
[22:39] Al Qaeda and these different things
[22:40] tensions is still high uh
[22:44] North Korea you throw that into the mix
[22:47] too so we have all this going on because
[22:49] uh the the nuclear everybody wants
[22:52] nuclear weapons because they want to
[22:54] have the right to protect themselves uh
[22:56] if if the if the big nation starts
[22:59] picking on the little Nation what else
[23:00] does a little Nation have uh against a
[23:03] big nation so they want they want
[23:04] nuclear weapons too so they have a
[23:06] fighting chance for survival so the
[23:08] tensions are high but this this Doomsday
[23:11] Clock it started in 1947.
[23:14] uh initially so I have this thing here
[23:17] go I'm not going to read through because
[23:19] it's there's a lot of years but I'm just
[23:21] going to hit the the uh the Highlight so
[23:24] to speak
[23:25] oh now
[23:28] back in World War II we know that uh we
[23:32] we dropped a couple bombs uh on Japan
[23:36] um little boy and and fat man
[23:40] uh those were two two bombs that that uh
[23:43] pretty much started the the nuclear arms
[23:47] race because uh other nations saw the
[23:51] power that those bombs had and they
[23:52] wanted a part of it uh so that that kind
[23:55] of started a a a a lot you know brother
[23:58] Brandon talks about uh
[24:00] you know mankind has gotten so smart
[24:03] well I wonder what and they're able to
[24:05] uh split an atom and they made the
[24:07] atomic bomb and he says well I wonder
[24:09] what they're going to do with that well
[24:10] usually if it's in the hands of somebody
[24:12] of wickedness that's going to be used in
[24:15] a wicked way
[24:17] so kind of going through that 1947 we
[24:20] said initially started they said that it
[24:23] was Seven Minutes to Midnight
[24:25] uh
[24:26] and this was a couple years after uh
[24:30] after World War II
[24:32] and in 1949 they said it was three
[24:35] minutes to midnight the Soviet Union
[24:37] tested its first atomic bomb
[24:40] uh officially starting the the
[24:42] officially starting the nuclear arms
[24:44] race
[24:46] 1953 it went down it said uh Two Minutes
[24:50] to Midnight the United States uh tests
[24:54] its first thermonuclear device in
[24:56] November 1952 as part of Operation Ivy
[25:00] before the Soviet Union followed suit
[25:02] with the Joe 4 test in August this
[25:05] remained the clock's closest approach to
[25:07] midnight uh until 2020.
[25:14] so we fast forward a little bit to 1984.
[25:16] you know it it fluctuated
[25:19] uh the highest was was 12 minutes to to
[25:22] midnight that was 1963 1972 so we're
[25:26] going to fast forward to 1984.
[25:29] uh it was three minutes to midnight
[25:31] again uh further escalation of the
[25:34] tensions between the U.S and Soviet
[25:36] Union with the ongoing Soviet Afghan war
[25:39] intensifying the Cold War and so on and
[25:42] so on the Soviet Union and its allies
[25:45] uh except Romania they boycott the 1984
[25:48] Olympic Games in Los Angeles
[25:51] because the U.S boycotted in 1980.
[25:55] now the highest was uh 17 minutes to
[25:58] midnight which was in 1991. so I guess
[26:02] uh tensions weren't so tense at that
[26:04] time the United States and Soviet Union
[26:07] signed the first strategic arms
[26:09] reduction treaty and the Soviet Union
[26:12] dissolves
[26:13] on December 26th this is the furthest
[26:16] from Midnight the clock has been since
[26:18] its Inception
[26:23] kind of fluctuated a little bit 14.
[26:26] down to five minutes to six minutes
[26:29] and 2012 it was five minutes
[26:32] 2015. it's back to three minutes
[26:40] there it's uh
[26:42] concerns and amid continued lack of
[26:45] global political action to address
[26:47] global climate change the modernization
[26:49] of nuclear weapons in the United States
[26:51] and Russia see that's the same two
[26:54] parties that seem to be involved every
[26:56] time
[26:57] they're not brother Brandon say that
[26:59] Russia has has a bomb with our name on
[27:01] it
[27:02] so and the problem and the problem of
[27:05] nuclear waste
[27:08] now going to 2017. hope I'm not boring
[27:11] anybody so uh it went down to two and a
[27:14] half minutes
[27:16] so it's closer in in 2017 it's getting
[27:19] closer to midnight says United States
[27:22] President Donald Trump's comments over
[27:24] nuclear weapons the threat of a renewed
[27:26] arms race between the U.S and Russia
[27:28] again the same same parties involved and
[27:32] they expressed disbelief in the
[27:34] scientific consensus over climate change
[27:36] by the Trump Administration now we all
[27:39] know that there was a lot of tension
[27:41] with Trump being in office his
[27:43] administration being in office there was
[27:45] a lot of tension
[27:46] uh 2018. it went down to two minutes so
[27:50] we're getting closer
[27:51] 2018 the failure of world leaders to
[27:55] deal with looming threats of nuclear war
[27:57] and climate change this is the clock's
[27:59] second closest approach to midnight
[28:01] matching that of 1953 in 2019 the
[28:05] bulletin reaffirmed the Two Minutes to
[28:06] Midnight time citing continuing climate
[28:10] change and Trump administration's
[28:11] abandonment of U.S efforts to lead the
[28:14] world toward decarbonization
[28:18] U.S withdrawal from the Paris agreement
[28:20] The Joint comprehensive plan of action
[28:22] and the intermediate range nuclear
[28:24] forces treaty
[28:26] if anybody understands that stuff then
[28:28] good for you
[28:32] but U.S and Russian nuclear and
[28:34] modernization efforts information
[28:36] Warfare threats and other dangers from
[28:39] disruptive Technologies such as
[28:41] synthetic biology artificial
[28:44] intelligence and cyber warfare
[28:48] now 2020
[28:50] it's down to one and two-third minutes
[28:53] or a hundred seconds to midnight
[28:57] that is the closest we have ever been
[28:59] when brother Branham said that we're uh
[29:02] we were three minutes to midnight he
[29:04] didn't know what was going to be in this
[29:05] day but he he kind of had a foresight of
[29:08] or he knew it was going to be bad but he
[29:09] didn't know when he didn't know how bad
[29:11] it was going to be but he knew that
[29:13] there was going to be some kind of a
[29:14] destruction which I I think is imminent
[29:17] so at 2020 we're one in two-thirds
[29:20] minutes from midnight now this is due to
[29:23] failure of world leaders to deal with
[29:25] increased threats of nuclear war such as
[29:28] the end of the intermediate range
[29:30] nuclear forces treaty between the U.S
[29:33] and guess who
[29:34] Russia you guessed right as well as
[29:37] increased tensions between the U.S and
[29:39] Iran along with the continued neglect of
[29:42] climate change
[29:43] announced in units of seconds instead of
[29:46] minutes this is the clock's closest
[29:48] approach to midnight exceeding that of
[29:51] 1953 and 2018. the bulletin concluded by
[29:55] stating that the current issues causing
[29:57] the adjustment are the most dangerous
[29:59] situation that Humanity has ever faced
[30:03] now in 2021
[30:06] oh
[30:09] the bulletin reaffirmed the 100 seconds
[30:11] to midnight time setting
[30:15] again in 2021 the 100 seconds it deems
[30:19] to be the uh the same due to major
[30:22] events right
[30:24] so we have nuclear continues to be a
[30:26] threat U.S versus Russia North Korea
[30:29] testing and Iran wanting to get into the
[30:32] race as well and other nations are
[30:34] wanting to keep them from getting the
[30:36] nuclear weapons for uh apparent reasons
[30:39] of terroristic acts yo they just happen
[30:41] to be labeled as a terrorist country uh
[30:45] is everyone in Iran is every Iranian a
[30:48] terrorist no I don't believe that but
[30:50] you have your extremist groups you have
[30:52] them in the U.S you have them in the in
[30:53] in the UK you have them in Russia you
[30:55] have them in China uh One Bad Apple
[30:58] doesn't make the whole uh bunch of bad a
[31:01] bad Bunch right so uh I don't want
[31:04] anybody to think anything ill toward
[31:06] anybody uh
[31:09] so you know I don't I don't want anybody
[31:11] to look at our Iranians and look at them
[31:12] look at them bad I believe they're good
[31:14] people there too so there are people
[31:16] there that just want to live their lives
[31:17] and and you know enjoy their families
[31:19] just like what we want to do you know
[31:21] they they want to live uh in peace I'm
[31:24] sure they want to live in peace as well
[31:26] so it's not a good thing when there's
[31:28] war and you see uh friends family uh
[31:32] comrades falling because of of War
[31:37] but in 20 uh
[31:40] 2020 we also had the the the stolen
[31:44] election in 2021 January uh six uh of
[31:49] how they called that an Insurrection uh
[31:51] that it was a a deadly Riot now uh you
[31:55] could kind of take some of this you
[31:57] could take this info as as possibly
[31:59] biased uh so you gotta take account of
[32:03] who's writing it
[32:04] and where they stand because some people
[32:06] have a hard time separating uh their
[32:09] feelings from fact so they want to put
[32:11] their opinion into things so I don't
[32:14] think January 6th was quite the
[32:16] Insurrection that they're trying to say
[32:18] that it was uh because they call it a
[32:21] deadly Riot because there were five
[32:22] people that died this and that was the
[32:24] first time I heard that five people I
[32:26] knew that there was one person but I
[32:28] didn't keep close tabs with it either so
[32:30] if there were five people I mean it sure
[32:33] wasn't uh it sure wasn't
[32:36] as many deaths as it was in the The Chop
[32:39] zone or whatever they whatever they
[32:41] called that the summer of love you know
[32:43] when when there were several people that
[32:45] that died
[32:47] so
[32:48] that's the Doomsday Clock I don't know
[32:51] if anybody's heard of the Doomsday Clock
[32:52] or what it what it uh if you've looked
[32:54] at it if you knew what it represented or
[32:57] how they came to the conclusion of how
[33:00] we're uh 100 seconds to midnight but
[33:03] it's the closest that it's ever been and
[33:05] uh so we're just waiting to see his
[33:08] appearance the second time right
[33:10] so
[33:12] if you read back in Exodus we know the
[33:15] Pharaoh was given a a similar warning we
[33:18] see the signs of the time so we were
[33:19] given the warning uh before beforehand
[33:22] we read in the scripture we uh brother
[33:24] Brandon made his comments and just all
[33:27] the time we see the signs of the time
[33:28] that the that the uh not to be cliched
[33:32] because there were people back in the
[33:33] 70s 80s you know walking around with
[33:36] signs the end is near and people are
[33:37] kind of tired of hearing that the end is
[33:39] near because the end hasn't shown up yet
[33:41] as far as what they see so take that
[33:44] into account also because that's also in
[33:47] the scripture because people will ask
[33:48] well where is the coming of the Lord
[33:50] that you said that that is coming where
[33:52] is he
[33:53] so don't get into that condition just
[33:55] know that he's going to be coming and
[33:57] when's he going to be coming when people
[33:59] least expect him to be coming
[34:01] because people are going to get tired of
[34:03] waiting and then people are going to
[34:05] start dropping off they're going to not
[34:08] have so much interest in the word of God
[34:10] they're not going to have interest in in
[34:13] going to church so then they start
[34:14] dropping off because well the end was
[34:17] supposed to be near where is it they
[34:19] they've lost the patience to wait for
[34:22] the second coming but Jesus himself told
[34:24] us to continue to watch and pray for we
[34:27] know not what what hour we don't know
[34:30] what day we have no idea when he's going
[34:32] to be coming so it behooves us to be
[34:35] ready and just wake up every day
[34:37] expecting that day to be the day
[34:40] so again Pharaoh was given the same type
[34:43] of warning so I I kind of see it as
[34:45] being uh similar so let's turn to uh
[34:49] Exodus 11.
[35:00] I could see it uh
[35:02] kind of happening in the same see we
[35:04] were given we were given the warning
[35:06] that the Rapture is going to be coming
[35:07] and only the elect will be saved right
[35:11] so certain certain people are going to
[35:13] be saved and certain people will not
[35:14] because they were not ready and they
[35:17] ignored the warning so Exodus 11 in the
[35:20] first verse it says and the Lord said
[35:23] unto Moses yet will I bring one plague
[35:26] more upon pharaoh and upon Egypt
[35:27] afterwards he will let you go hence
[35:31] when he shall let you go he shall surely
[35:33] thrust you out hence altogether speak
[35:35] now in the ears of the people and let
[35:37] every man borrow of his neighbor and
[35:39] every woman
[35:40] of her neighbor jewels of silver and
[35:43] jewels of gold and the lord gave the
[35:45] people favor in the sight of the
[35:47] Egyptians moreover the man Moses was
[35:50] very great in the land of Egypt in the
[35:52] sight of Pharaoh's servants and in the
[35:54] sight of people of the people
[35:57] and Moses said thus saith the Lord about
[36:01] midnight
[36:03] about midnight will I go out into the
[36:06] midst of Egypt
[36:08] and all the firstborn in the land of
[36:10] Egypt shall die from the firstborn of
[36:12] pharaoh that sitteth upon his throne see
[36:14] there is no respecter of persons that he
[36:16] was even going to go to Pharaoh no
[36:17] matter what position he held and he was
[36:19] the highest in the land so it didn't
[36:21] matter how important he was he still
[36:24] fell into this same thing see God is no
[36:26] not a respecter of persons except those
[36:28] that love him
[36:29] from the firstborn of pharaoh that
[36:31] sitteth upon his throne even unto the
[36:33] firstborn of the maidservant so from the
[36:36] highest to the lowest from the the
[36:38] firstborn of the maidservant that is
[36:40] behind the mill and all the firstborn of
[36:43] beasts
[36:46] and there shall be a great cry
[36:48] throughout all the land of Egypt such as
[36:50] there was none like it nor shall be like
[36:54] it anymore but against any of the
[36:57] children of Israel which was the elect
[36:59] shall not a dog move his tongue against
[37:01] man or beast that ye may know how that
[37:04] the Lord doth put a difference between
[37:07] the Egyptians and Israel he puts a
[37:09] difference between the world and the
[37:11] elect he puts a difference from the
[37:13] nominal Christian those that say that
[37:15] believe but are a make-believer and the
[37:18] believer there is a distinct difference
[37:20] between the two
[37:22] so and in verse 8 it says and all these
[37:25] thy servants shall come down unto me and
[37:27] bow down themselves unto me saying get
[37:29] thee out and all the people that follow
[37:31] thee and after that I will go out and he
[37:34] went out from pharaoh and a great anger
[37:36] and the Lord said unto Moses Pharaoh
[37:39] shall not hearken unto you that my
[37:42] wonders may be multiplied in the land of
[37:44] Egypt say it's for my purpose I'm doing
[37:46] these things
[37:47] and Moses and Aaron did all these and
[37:49] and Moses was getting upset at it
[37:53] but don't be angry Moses this is the
[37:55] work that I'm this is my work this is my
[37:57] time to work right now you you just do
[37:59] what I tell you to do and and sit back
[38:01] and enjoy the ride pretty much
[38:05] and in verse 10 it says and Moses and
[38:07] Aaron did all these wonders before
[38:09] pharaoh and the Lord hardened Pharaoh's
[38:11] heart so that he would not let the
[38:13] children of Israel go
[38:15] out of his land and now see you we see
[38:18] the The Exodus Cry at midnight it shows
[38:21] an example of how the Rapture will take
[38:23] place
[38:24] because they're the people aren't going
[38:26] to know about it what's going to happen
[38:27] when all these people are gone there's
[38:29] going to be a cry like nobody's ever
[38:31] heard
[38:32] and see for the time of fulfillment had
[38:34] come the mistreatment of God's people
[38:36] had caused them to to groan and cry unto
[38:38] the father do you see so much wickedness
[38:41] are you not sitting shoulder and
[38:42] shoulder with the world are you not
[38:44] getting tired of these things are you
[38:46] not getting tired of all the wickedness
[38:48] and that you're surrounded in you just
[38:50] walk into Walmart you walk into Giant
[38:52] Eagle you walk into any store whatever
[38:53] it might be and what is it it's
[38:55] wickedness before your eyes there's this
[38:57] wickedness everywhere you just drive
[38:59] down the road and you see bulletin
[39:01] boards and you see half-naked women and
[39:03] you see all this evil that's there and
[39:05] you see this these these mockeries of
[39:07] God and you see all these different
[39:09] things out there we are surrounded by
[39:11] wickedness
[39:12] in order to grieve us to our souls amen
[39:17] but see the warning was given the
[39:19] warning was given to Pharaoh but we know
[39:20] that the Lord hardened Pharaoh's heart
[39:22] but he uh not know if we didn't know
[39:25] that we would see that Pharaoh was so
[39:27] angry at the children of Israel that he
[39:29] changed his mind
[39:30] he said no I'm not going to let them go
[39:33] and he went after them to kill them
[39:35] right
[39:36] so Pharaoh completely ignored the
[39:39] warning that was given because the Lord
[39:40] hardened his heart so he couldn't really
[39:43] change it so he lost his his eldest son
[39:46] and everybody that didn't make ready
[39:49] that didn't heed the warning if they
[39:51] didn't put the blood on the uh on the
[39:53] lint on the doorpost
[39:54] they would have lost their eldest as
[39:56] well
[39:57] so it was those that were looking for
[40:00] the promise it was those that made
[40:02] themselves ready that came according to
[40:04] the instructions that were given amen
[40:06] see the warning was given the
[40:07] instructions were given to God's people
[40:09] it was up to the people to get
[40:11] themselves ready it did not it's not up
[40:13] to your pastor it's not up to me as a
[40:15] visiting Minister it's not up to your
[40:17] brother and sister it's up to you
[40:19] yourself to get yourself ready see we
[40:22] read in Revelation that the bride maketh
[40:25] herself ready the word will come to pass
[40:28] God will not see his uh uh his word will
[40:32] not return unto him void amen
[40:35] see warnings have been given for decades
[40:37] and centuries but we are receiving more
[40:40] warnings now we're seeing it in this day
[40:42] now now if people knew the day in the
[40:44] hour
[40:45] if they knew the specific day in the
[40:47] hour what do you think what do you think
[40:49] what would happen
[40:51] they would live any kind of life that
[40:53] they would want to they would live in
[40:54] lasciviousness they would be they would
[40:56] have malice in their hearts they would
[40:58] just be so full of wickedness until the
[41:00] day of until the last minute but God
[41:04] doesn't want his elect living like that
[41:08] he wants us to be ready now he wants to
[41:10] show forth he wants us to show forth
[41:12] that we are a witness of what he's done
[41:14] amen for the work that he has done
[41:17] but we know how the people like to push
[41:19] the limits
[41:21] until they have to do something people
[41:23] will procrastinate until the last second
[41:25] how many in here in school knew that you
[41:28] had a report due on Monday and you had
[41:31] three weeks to do it and you just left
[41:33] the whole time until Sunday night 10
[41:36] o'clock at night
[41:39] I'm guilty
[41:42] but people just put things off so much
[41:44] until the last minute
[41:46] but we don't have that kind of Grace
[41:48] right now we don't have that kind of
[41:50] luxury to wait until the last minute we
[41:52] must get into the ark now
[41:54] we let's get into the promise now
[42:01] amen
[42:04] he says so will it be at the coming of
[42:06] the Lord there is many Restless people
[42:08] today that knows that something is
[42:11] fixing to happen but they'll never see
[42:13] him they know something's about to
[42:15] happen but they won't take the
[42:17] precautions to get into the ark so to
[42:19] speak this isn't Noah's no is our but
[42:21] you understand what I mean but it's time
[42:23] to get into the ark amen for he will
[42:25] come in the Stillness of the midnight
[42:28] not not a specific hour of midnight 12
[42:31] a.m just remember that I don't know how
[42:33] many realize that but when when people
[42:35] hear midnight they think 12 o'clock AM
[42:38] but it's not that specific hour let's
[42:41] see for he will come in the Stillness of
[42:43] the midnight to catch away the little
[42:46] church that's longing and waiting and
[42:48] expecting to see him that's the ones
[42:51] he'll come and catch away many of the
[42:53] world who is living on the glamors and
[42:55] feasting their souls upon the things of
[42:57] the world will never know what happened
[43:00] until the church is gone into glory amen
[43:02] they'll never know where we went
[43:06] for he will come as a thief in the night
[43:08] and catch them away so we can say we're
[43:11] back again to the same place now we find
[43:14] out that this this expectations that he
[43:17] always appears to those who were
[43:19] expecting him always to those who are
[43:21] wanting to see him and I'm sure that
[43:23] that's the hope that's on our hearts
[43:25] today amen
[43:27] that's the hope that's on my heart
[43:34] so there's a little bit on the three
[43:35] minutes to midnight
[43:37] now I kind of just want to shift here a
[43:39] little bit to the new Heaven and new
[43:40] earth
[43:42] let's turn to Second Peter chapter 3.
[43:48] as I said some some pastors get a little
[43:51] line easy when when somebody visiting
[43:53] will come and preach something like the
[44:03] I don't think brother Jesse would feel
[44:04] that easy
[44:06] unless I'm saying something wrong which
[44:08] I I pray not I'm sure he'll correct me
[44:11] and I'm open to correction if if I'd say
[44:13] anything incorrect
[44:15] II Peter chapter 3 starting in the first
[44:18] verse
[44:19] it says this Second Epistle beloved I
[44:22] now write unto you
[44:26] in both which I stir up your pure Minds
[44:30] by way of remembrance that ye may be
[44:32] mindful of The Words which were spoken
[44:34] before of the Holy prophets and of the
[44:37] Commandment of us
[44:38] the Apostles of the Lord and of the Lord
[44:41] and Savior knowing this first that there
[44:45] shall come in the last days scoffers
[44:47] walking after their own lusts and saying
[44:49] where is the promise of his coming see
[44:52] here it is and they're asking where is
[44:53] the promise of his coming for since the
[44:56] fathers fell asleep all things continue
[44:58] as they were from the beginning of the
[45:00] creation
[45:01] so everything is just the the same thing
[45:04] day in day out day in day out you know
[45:07] so they're not saying that anything that
[45:09] they're getting impatient where is he
[45:11] you said he was coming but where is he
[45:13] now see if if this gospel is such a myth
[45:17] then why did so many people die because
[45:20] of it
[45:21] why are so many afraid of it now
[45:25] if this Bible is such a myth then why do
[45:27] people fight against us so hard
[45:30] I've never heard of anyone burned at the
[45:32] stake for a little Miss Muffet
[45:35] anybody ever here did you know the
[45:37] nursery rhymes and and things like that
[45:39] I've never heard of anybody being burned
[45:40] into the steak for something so mythical
[45:42] is that so such fictional stuff I've
[45:45] never heard of anybody any beheading for
[45:47] Humpty Dumpty
[45:50] I've never heard of anybody being
[45:51] exhumed uh for wee willy winky you know
[45:54] these these little nursery rhymes those
[45:56] are as myth as can be
[45:59] you know the the Disney fictional
[46:01] characters where's the outcry for
[46:03] something like that
[46:05] but it's a lie it's something made up
[46:08] but people fight against the truth so
[46:10] hard
[46:11] because they don't want it exposed that
[46:14] they don't want it to have preeminence
[46:15] in people's lives
[46:18] but see it's it's only now that we see
[46:21] the offenses uh come
[46:24] of other things like Dr Seuss people are
[46:26] offended over Dr Seuss
[46:28] I never even gave a thought of stuff
[46:30] like that with Dr Seuss of what the it's
[46:32] so far reaching of of how they're
[46:34] offended over Dr Seuss
[46:36] it's fictional characters how can you
[46:38] how can you get upset over some cartoon
[46:40] that some man conjured up in his mind
[46:44] it's not even a real character
[46:48] and then we turn to Harry Potter
[46:53] a fictional thing
[46:55] something made up in somebody's mind
[46:58] and it's accepted worldwide
[47:01] and how nominal Christians nominal
[47:04] churches out there how they accept Harry
[47:06] Potter if whether they don't have the
[47:08] discernment to know that it's wickedness
[47:10] they shouldn't be accepting any kind of
[47:12] Witchcraft anything that's remotely
[47:14] related to Witchcraft they shouldn't
[47:16] allow that into the church and here they
[47:18] have they have movie Nights with Harry
[47:20] Potter are you kidding me
[47:23] this is the stuff you should be
[47:24] preaching against
[47:26] but they hail it as something good oh
[47:28] the kids enjoy it they they loved Harry
[47:30] Potter well they should be taught to
[47:32] hate Harry Potter
[47:34] because it goes against the very fabric
[47:36] of God's word
[47:42] either they can't discern the wickedness
[47:44] or they completely ignore it
[47:48] verse 5.
[47:50] it says for this they willingly are
[47:53] ignorant
[47:54] of that by the word of God the heavens
[47:56] were of old and the Earth standing out
[47:59] of the water and in the water whereby
[48:01] the world that what that then was being
[48:04] overflowed with water perished
[48:07] Noah right so verse 7 it says but the
[48:11] heavens and the Earth which are now by
[48:14] the same word are kept in store reserved
[48:17] unto fire against the day of judgment
[48:19] and Perdition of ungodly man
[48:22] see before
[48:24] it was destruction by water
[48:26] but in the future it's going to be
[48:28] destruction by fire
[48:31] oh my
[48:34] verse 8 it says but beloved
[48:37] just talking to you be not ignorant of
[48:39] this one thing that one day is with the
[48:42] Lord as a thousand years and a thousand
[48:44] years as one day the Lord is not slack
[48:47] concerning his promise amen as some men
[48:50] count slackness but is long-suffering to
[48:52] us word not willing that any should
[48:55] perish he doesn't want us to perish
[48:56] that's why he gives men warnings so they
[48:59] can get in shape and get raped
[49:03] that's how much he loves us amen
[49:07] but that all should come to repentance
[49:10] but the day of the Lord will come as a
[49:13] thief in the night right
[49:15] in the which the heavens shall pass away
[49:17] with great noise now pay attention to
[49:20] that where it says pass away in the
[49:22] which the heavens shall pass away with a
[49:25] great noise and the elements shall melt
[49:27] with fervent Heat
[49:29] the Earth also in the works that are
[49:33] therein shall be burned up the works the
[49:37] evil Deeds
[49:39] that's where that's what happened in the
[49:41] day of Noah right
[49:43] he abolished all wickedness he he killed
[49:45] it with the flood right
[49:47] so now this is going to come unto the
[49:50] fervent heat burned by fire and it's
[49:52] going to be the works that gets burned
[49:53] up
[49:54] it's going to be the evil that and the
[49:57] wickedness that's on this Earth that's
[49:58] what's going to be burned up
[50:00] with the Earth amen
[50:04] and the works that are therein shall be
[50:06] burned up verse 11 it says Sing then
[50:09] that all these things shall be dissolved
[50:11] what manner of persons ought ye to be in
[50:15] all holy conversation
[50:17] and godliness looking for
[50:21] looking for
[50:23] looking for and Hasting
[50:25] be Hasty for nothing don't make hasty
[50:28] decisions but in this one thing be Hasty
[50:30] it says looking for and Hasting unto the
[50:33] coming of the day of God we're in the
[50:35] heavens being on fire shall be dissolved
[50:38] and the elements shall melt with fervent
[50:40] Heat
[50:41] nevertheless we according to his promise
[50:44] we look for new heavens and a new Earth
[50:47] wherein dwelleth what righteousness no
[50:51] longer evil but we're in dwelleth
[50:53] righteousness that's the kind of
[50:55] atmosphere that's the kind of
[50:56] environment that we want to live in
[50:58] that's the kind of place where where a
[51:00] Godly person wants to be there's no more
[51:02] evil there's no more falling there's no
[51:04] more giving in to Temptation that's a
[51:07] place of paradise for the believer amen
[51:09] that's a place of righteousness amen
[51:12] praise be to God no wonder we're looking
[51:14] for a place to go because we're sick and
[51:16] tired of this old world
[51:18] verse 14 it says wherefore beloved
[51:21] seeing that you look for such things be
[51:24] diligent that you may be found of him in
[51:27] peace without spot and blameless every
[51:30] day being in Repentance every day being
[51:33] renewed in the Lord amen every day being
[51:35] renewed in your mind
[51:37] amen for it's in the mind that we serve
[51:40] Christ correct
[51:42] now see there are three stages of Grace
[51:46] I know this is kind of a tricky this is
[51:48] kind of a sticky sticky spot here
[51:50] because there are people that say that
[51:51] there are four works of Grace but I
[51:53] believe that there are three works of
[51:54] Grace three stages of Grace we know them
[51:56] as as justification sanctification and
[51:59] baptism of the Holy Ghost right so uh
[52:02] repentance what is what is repentance
[52:04] that's the justification right that's
[52:06] remitting past sins
[52:09] past sins if you sin this morning and
[52:11] you remember repented it's a past sin
[52:14] right it's not a present sin but it's a
[52:16] person it's now under the blood
[52:18] so that'll get us to uh sanctification
[52:21] sanctification I know this is kind of
[52:24] Elementary but bear with me here uh
[52:26] we're getting somewhere with this
[52:27] sanctification is cleaned and set aside
[52:30] for service right
[52:32] it sets our minds in order for holiness
[52:36] it allows us to accept the word it
[52:38] allows us to bask in the word it allows
[52:40] us to bask in his promise amen so the
[52:43] third one is baptism of the fire and
[52:45] holy ghost that God might dwell in us
[52:48] it's cleansed burnt out cleaned up and
[52:51] then put into service right
[52:53] so we know that in the natural we have a
[52:56] newborn baby a newborn baby a newborn is
[52:59] born in a water blood in the spirit
[53:03] right so the same thing in the spirit
[53:05] spiritual so we know the natural types
[53:07] of spiritual and the spiritual somebody
[53:09] being born again it's of being born
[53:12] again of water blood and spirit right
[53:16] so we have a a messages of of Luther
[53:19] Wesley Pentecost it's justification
[53:22] sanctification and baptism of the Holy
[53:24] Ghost there's no more ages to come it's
[53:27] the end time there's nothing else to
[53:29] look forward to except for the coming of
[53:31] Christ amen
[53:33] but the same method that is used for the
[53:36] world to be redeemed is is the same type
[53:39] of the natural of the of the newborn
[53:41] baby baby and the newborn uh born-again
[53:44] Christian the water blood in the spirit
[53:46] the the justification sanctification and
[53:49] uh the the burning of the Holy Fire
[53:52] so the world where the bride will live
[53:54] will be in the same way right because
[53:57] all wickedness Shall Perish oh
[53:59] wickedness no there will be no evil
[54:01] dwelling in the bride
[54:05] so again justification let's say enter
[54:07] deluvian World Noah it's repentance with
[54:10] and and with water right so the Earth
[54:12] with the was destroyed by the flood
[54:14] that's the water baptism uh
[54:17] sanctification Christ coming and
[54:19] shedding his blood that's the blood
[54:21] cleansing and claiming it as his own
[54:24] amen Satan tried to give it give it to
[54:26] him without the purchase of blood if he
[54:29] was to worship him right we know that
[54:30] that he he was given the ultimatum if
[54:32] you worship me I'll give you these
[54:34] things but little did he not even think
[54:36] of that it already belonged to him so it
[54:40] it was eventually going to be uh he was
[54:42] he was it was going to belong to him
[54:44] anyways so Jesus knew I'm not going to
[54:47] worship you because I'm I'm already
[54:48] heard of these things but see it had to
[54:51] be uh
[54:52] so we know Jesus said get thee behind me
[54:54] for it is written Thou shalt Worship the
[54:56] Lord thy God and him only shalt thou
[54:58] serve but it had to be bought right it
[55:01] wasn't going to be just given it had to
[55:03] be bought
[55:05] see Abraham purchased the land and they
[55:08] tried to give it to him uh they tried to
[55:10] give to him as a gift but he he refused
[55:13] it
[55:14] because why he said I will purchase it
[55:16] for it was an enzyme for of what was to
[55:18] come Satan tried to offer to Christ as
[55:21] as if if he did uh a certain thing but
[55:25] again it had to be bought Abraham
[55:27] refused to do it he said I'm not I'll
[55:30] not have it be a witness of you giving
[55:32] me things and I'm becoming rich because
[55:33] of what you've given to me but I'm going
[55:35] to take the step forward
[55:37] I'm going to show forth a witness of a
[55:39] true God Amen
[55:42] so we see which leads us to the baptism
[55:44] of fire we're already at water and blood
[55:48] uh the water in the purchase of blood
[55:50] amen so now we go to the baptism of fire
[55:53] to burn out all the filth it's the
[55:56] destruction of the world as it is now
[55:58] the defiled the evil and the unclean he
[56:01] says I will uh I will cleanse all germs
[56:04] all diseases all sickness even all
[56:07] spiritual things to make it ready for
[56:09] God to dwell in that's the new Earth
[56:11] that's the new spirit amen
[56:14] see the same Plan of Redemption is used
[56:16] to redeem both the world and the persons
[56:19] to live in it
[56:22] it's
[56:24] see Jesus Christ the same yesterday
[56:25] today and forever it's going to follow
[56:27] through with the same thing amen so the
[56:30] framework will remain
[56:33] excuse me the old framework was not
[56:35] destroyed by water it was only washed
[56:38] off see the Earth Still Remains it was
[56:40] just everything on the earth that was
[56:42] destroyed it was being washed off it was
[56:44] being baptized wickedness was destroyed
[56:47] see in the same time the framework shall
[56:50] remain though it be burnt by fire it
[56:53] only destroys the sin that's on it just
[56:55] like a born-again Spirit-filled believer
[56:57] your body wasn't destroyed naturally but
[57:01] the evil inside should be burned out
[57:03] with the Holy Ghost and Fire making it
[57:05] habitable where God can dwell amen he
[57:08] had to baptize us with fire in order to
[57:11] dwell in us not a dilation we're not
[57:13] annihilated we're still here walking
[57:15] with the spirit within us right
[57:17] so the same thing with the world though
[57:19] it's not going to explode into
[57:21] Smithereens it's not going to be
[57:22] Annihilation but it's going to be
[57:24] cleansed by Holy Ghost and Fire
[57:26] the meek shall inherit the earth right
[57:28] not a different Earth one that's renewed
[57:31] by cleansing passing uh passing from one
[57:35] thing to another changed Jesus said the
[57:38] meek shall inherit the earth right not a
[57:39] different Earth one that is renewed by
[57:41] cleansing but it's passing remember what
[57:44] we've read passing it shall pass away
[57:45] but it doesn't mean Annihilation it's
[57:48] passing from one thing to another change
[57:51] it's regenerated
[57:54] just as we are changed from sinner to
[57:56] Saint the Earth will be redeemed amen
[57:59] new Heaven and new earth just as we are
[58:01] a new creature of Christ the Earth the
[58:04] heavens and earth shall be new amen it
[58:06] shall be cleansed from all
[58:07] unrighteousness
[58:09] who
[58:15] let me get some
[58:20] in second Peter uh chapter 3 and verse
[58:23] 10 we've read it already but it says but
[58:25] the day of the Lord will come as a thief
[58:27] of the night right so the heavens and
[58:29] earth will be burned up uh with a great
[58:31] noise and we won't nobody will really
[58:33] know what's happening because it comes
[58:36] as a thief in the night
[58:38] so the heavens and earth will be burned
[58:40] up with great noise attributed to an
[58:42] explosion the Earth with fervent heat
[58:44] melting the elements nuclear and atomic
[58:47] heat are very intense and catastrophic
[58:51] up to the range of three thousand to
[58:53] four thousand degrees Celsius what is
[58:55] that in Fahrenheit you think 120 degrees
[58:57] Fahrenheit is hot desert hot how about
[59:01] 5432 to
[59:03] 7232 degrees Fahrenheit and that's going
[59:06] to melt the elements of the earth amen
[59:09] and is well able to do it at 7 000
[59:12] degrees over 7000 degrees we burn we we
[59:15] melt sand I work at a glass factory we
[59:17] melt sand at 3000 degrees that is hot
[59:20] you stand next to that furnace you're
[59:22] going to feel that heat
[59:24] if you were to fall in the furnace you'd
[59:26] disintegrate in a matter of seconds
[59:28] I think by the time you even hit hit the
[59:31] hit the batch in that furnace you'd be
[59:32] disintegrated
[59:35] so could you imagine five thousand to
[59:37] seven thousand degrees Fahrenheit what
[59:39] can nothing is going to be able to stand
[59:41] in that kind of a heat
[59:44] it will burn up so does that help you
[59:47] understand of how hot that's going to be
[59:49] people think hell's going to be hot oh
[59:52] it's going to be hot all right
[59:54] so Satan and all his that are going to
[59:56] be burned up in that Lake of Fire
[59:58] they're going to be burned up into
[59:59] Annihilation amen
[1:00:01] praise be to God
[1:00:04] II Peter 3 6 it says whereby the world
[1:00:07] that then was being overflowed with
[1:00:10] water in Paris right so that was Noah
[1:00:12] and in Noah's Day the Earth was was
[1:00:14] destroyed by flood but it was not
[1:00:16] annihilated for we're still dwelling in
[1:00:18] it I know I'm recapping some of the
[1:00:20] things but just kind of give you an idea
[1:00:22] Revelations 21 and verse 1.
[1:00:32] it says and I saw a new Heaven and a new
[1:00:35] Earth for the first Heaven and the first
[1:00:38] Earth were passed away and there was no
[1:00:40] more sea
[1:00:42] wow
[1:00:45] something that hot that's going to lick
[1:00:46] up all that water
[1:00:48] that fire is going to be thirsty
[1:00:51] and it won't be able to quench it
[1:00:54] all the water on this Earth it won't be
[1:00:56] able to quench that Holy Ghost and Fire
[1:00:58] amen
[1:00:59] now see this is not the Millennium the
[1:01:01] Millennium is the time of rest
[1:01:04] the seventh day
[1:01:06] this is where we build houses and
[1:01:08] inhabit
[1:01:10] this is the same time as the great white
[1:01:12] Throne judgment for the bride is judged
[1:01:15] already now these I'm getting these
[1:01:17] statements from from the message this is
[1:01:19] what what brother Brandon taught amen
[1:01:22] so
[1:01:23] for the bride is judged already the new
[1:01:26] Heaven and the new Earth will be the
[1:01:28] Eighth Day for we know that the Lord
[1:01:31] rested on the seventh day right so it's
[1:01:34] the Eighth Day it starts over it's a new
[1:01:37] beginning this is where he is already
[1:01:40] gone and prepared the place for us
[1:01:43] brother van you want to come we'll go
[1:01:45] ahead and close I know just when it
[1:01:47] starts seems to start getting good right
[1:01:49] laughs
[1:01:51] but right now this is a terrying Time
[1:01:57] Matthew 25 and verse 5 said while the
[1:01:59] bridegroom tarried they all slumbered
[1:02:02] and slept
[1:02:03] and it and this is a recap and verse 13
[1:02:06] it says watch therefore
[1:02:09] ye know neither the day nor the hour I
[1:02:12] just want to stress that so much that no
[1:02:15] man we don't know the hour nor the day
[1:02:18] so he says watch therefore for ye know
[1:02:20] neither the day nor the hour wherein the
[1:02:23] son of man cometh
[1:02:25] today people can't wait uh the scripture
[1:02:28] where it says the Lord delayeth is
[1:02:29] coming for the Holy Ghost to move
[1:02:31] so they manufacture to their own idea
[1:02:35] they have their own uh interpretation of
[1:02:39] the word whether whether the Lord the
[1:02:40] scripture means this the scripture means
[1:02:42] this it's going to be on such and such
[1:02:44] day it's going to be such and such year
[1:02:46] you know almost every there were so many
[1:02:48] people that were saying that it's going
[1:02:50] to be in this year and they specify a
[1:02:53] date in the year they no longer live
[1:02:56] they are no longer alive
[1:02:59] people that claim to be Elijah
[1:03:02] or or the two witnesses in this day and
[1:03:05] uh I think the last ones that I saw uh
[1:03:08] they're no longer alive
[1:03:11] so am I saying that it's a coincidence I
[1:03:14] I don't know what happened that's that's
[1:03:16] in God's hands
[1:03:18] so uh so are there still people alive
[1:03:21] that that have made those yeah there's
[1:03:22] still some people I've that have made
[1:03:24] those kinds of claims so
[1:03:28] it being far from us that we would try
[1:03:30] to make some kind of false claims like
[1:03:31] that we don't want to be found in that
[1:03:33] we don't want to make our own
[1:03:34] interpretation but we want to say what
[1:03:37] the word says no matter if if it hurts
[1:03:40] our feelings or not we want to accept
[1:03:42] what the word says it's the word that
[1:03:44] does the changing we're not trying to
[1:03:46] manufacture something and uh if we a
[1:03:49] sinner come in God's way
[1:03:52] he has every right to all of the
[1:03:54] reductive blessings amen if he comes the
[1:03:57] same way that you and I came they're
[1:03:58] they're they are able to receive all the
[1:04:01] Heavenly blessings amen oh again the the
[1:04:04] Lord is not a respecter of persons but
[1:04:07] he is a respecter of obedience
[1:04:10] he's a respecter of those that respect
[1:04:13] his word amen
[1:04:16] so if you would stand to your feet
[1:04:23] I'll say I know you're taught by a good
[1:04:25] teacher here
[1:04:28] and we know that the evidence of the
[1:04:29] Holy Ghost is not in tongues or in other
[1:04:31] gifts is that right
[1:04:34] but the evidence is when you could
[1:04:36] receive the word it's not some system
[1:04:39] that we enter in but like I said
[1:04:41] whatever the word says that's what we
[1:04:43] want to cleave to that's what we want to
[1:04:45] hold on to if you know what cleave means
[1:04:47] it means when you cleave on to something
[1:04:49] it means you're not letting go no matter
[1:04:51] what Tempest may come no matter what
[1:04:53] storm may come you're not going to let
[1:04:54] go whether it's the tornado is coming
[1:04:56] you're not letting go with every fiber
[1:04:59] of your being you're going to hold on
[1:05:00] until you're taken somewhere else
[1:05:03] you're going to hold on to it so hold on
[1:05:05] to the promise no matter what storms may
[1:05:07] come no matter what Temptations come
[1:05:09] stay on the track of the Lord amen
[1:05:14] hey man I got a couple more things but
[1:05:17] I'm just going to go ahead and close
[1:05:18] amen
[1:05:21] I hope this was a blessing to you I hope
[1:05:23] I hope you you learned something today
[1:05:26] and uh
[1:05:27] not that I'm a great teacher but I hope
[1:05:29] something that was said but uh
[1:05:32] help you in some some way
[1:05:35] let's look to the Lord in prayer
[1:05:38] most gracious Heavenly Father
[1:05:42] Lord

[1:05:46] forever
[1:05:47] [Music]
[1:05:48] and Lord when we're holding on to the
[1:05:52] promise that you were going to come for
[1:05:53] those that are looking for you to come

[1:05:58] that you would call those that are that
[1:06:02] are looking for you
[1:06:03] and take away those that are that are
[1:06:06] looking for your second coming but

[1:06:10] us are in that condition today that if
[1:06:13] the Rapture would I'm not going to say
[1:06:14] until tomorrow but I'm going to say
[1:06:16] today if the Rapture happens today for
[1:06:18] we have no idea what it is may we live
[1:06:20] our lives in such a way uh that if the
[1:06:24] Rapture would come today that we would
[1:06:25] be ready to go Lord not that we have
[1:06:28] time to get things ready in in our house
[1:06:30] in order tomorrow but Lord may all
[1:06:32] things be ready today so Lord if there's

[1:06:37] need in their life they see something in
[1:06:39] their in their life that they have to
[1:06:40] get ready Lord if the if the Rapture
[1:06:42] happen today Lord may they not be
[1:06:44] hindered by those things because they
[1:06:46] have made everything right today I just
[1:06:48] pray that you would just meet them here
[1:06:49] today Father I just pray that they would
[1:06:52] leave everything at the altar not to
[1:06:53] pick it up again to to live the same way
[1:06:56] that they were living tomorrow but Lord
[1:06:58] God I just pray that they would bring
[1:07:00] everything to the altar every
[1:07:01] uncleanliness and every Wicked thing
[1:07:03] Lord I pray that each and every one of
[1:07:05] us would leave it here at the altar and
[1:07:07] let it be annihilated by the Holy Ghost
[1:07:09] of fire not to be picked up again but
[1:07:12] Lord God we want to live in such a
[1:07:13] condition that we would live a life that
[1:07:16] would be pleasing unto You O Lord father
[1:07:18] I just pray that that your word just
[1:07:20] would take a place in our hearts that
[1:07:22] the word would be anchored in our lives
[1:07:24] that we would forsake all worldliness
[1:07:26] that our eyes wouldn't be averted to the
[1:07:28] things of the world but our eyes would
[1:07:29] stay focused that our eyes would just
[1:07:31] stay fixed upon you no matter what
[1:07:33] Tempest May blow no matter what storms
[1:07:35] may arise no matter what Temptations may
[1:07:37] come that we would stay steadfast and
[1:07:40] true for your word is a lamp unto our
[1:07:42] feet and a light onto our path and may
[1:07:44] we follow that path that you light up
[1:07:46] for us oh God may we follow the leading
[1:07:48] of the Holy Ghost and may we receive
[1:07:50] that Holy Ghost Lord if there's any here
[1:07:52] amongst us that does not have the Holy
[1:07:54] Ghost Lord God I pray that they would
[1:07:55] get themselves into that condition that
[1:07:57] they could receive it for Lord they can
[1:07:59] receive it if they would just come in
[1:08:01] the condition of repentance and just
[1:08:03] confess everything and come before you
[1:08:05] and say that I forsake everything of
[1:08:07] this world that I forsake everything and
[1:08:09] I just want to come to you for there's
[1:08:11] no other thing that I want besides your
[1:08:13] word and besides your Holy Spirit Lord
[1:08:15] may they come into that condition and
[1:08:17] may you meet them here today and that
[1:08:19] they will walk out filled with your Holy
[1:08:21] Spirit oh God that they would Mark out
[1:08:23] as a new creature in Christ then all
[1:08:25] things in the past would be would be
[1:08:27] faded away then all sins passed would be
[1:08:29] Annihilator to God not to be picked up
[1:08:32] anymore no matter what the accuser of
[1:08:34] the Brethren would try to do to us from
[1:08:35] day to day may we forsake those things
[1:08:37] may they be remembered no more oh God so
[1:08:40] father I pray that you would be with
[1:08:42] each and every person this morning that
[1:08:43] you would help them and guide them by
[1:08:45] your Holy Spirit and by Your Word every
[1:08:47] single day and may we look unto your
[1:08:49] promise until the time if you're coming
[1:08:51] to call us away oh god father may we be
[1:08:54] pleasing in your sight I ask all this in
[1:08:56] your blessed name our Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:58] amen
[1:09:00] and amen praise be to God
[1:09:04] amen if anybody has a need in their
[1:09:07] heart in their life I'd be happy to pray
[1:09:10] with you
[1:09:13] but if you have something don't wait
[1:09:15] don't don't put it off if you got
[1:09:17] something wrong uh and you got to make
[1:09:19] something right just pledge to the Lord
[1:09:21] and be careful of a vow unto the Lord
[1:09:23] because if you make a vow you better
[1:09:25] repent but if there's something if you
[1:09:27] say Lord I promise to make that right
[1:09:29] later on so I could be in the right
[1:09:31] condition today then then you do it that
[1:09:33] way so if we were to get yourself ready
[1:09:36] as if we were going to have communion
[1:09:38] tonight I'm not saying that we are but
[1:09:40] if we were or if the Rapture was to take
[1:09:42] place today or tomorrow that you would
[1:09:44] be ready amen
