importance of you know our prayers here in the service of want to preach on with one Accord in one place this will preach on that acts 2 verse 1 trust me a blessing to you today by God's grace this is what I thought I'm going to preach this morning then I believe like me like I said this one who the Holy Spirit kind of led me in that other direction it was really nice to see people searching seeking God praise God very happy about that so acts 2 verse 1 very major Scripture he's kind of one woman read that first verse let's all read that one three one two three and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord you want to play saving this is power heads from work prayer get on your heart not how many Father we're gathered in this place we're in one place enough Lord as we are many times are just our desire Lord our one desires to be in one Accord God being one harmonious nor to action in one harmonious mindset Lord God that we would all desire the same thing dear God that's to glorify you to see you in order to hear your voice more tonight great speak to us here Lord give me the inspiration Lord Jesus and appraises bless the message to the hearts of the people more we're grateful three six and we're standing on the battlefield for our Lord we're serving in the Lord loving to do it faithfully Lord that posted due to you given to us up was Jesus to be found faithful give you all the glory honor Jesus Christ god bless you Benson you're doing Malachi in switchover buddy I got some let's go to some hotel and share this is part 17 I just want to reiterate some things I was saying this morning just for the home Church continuing to pray and so forth there come can you pray asking God that he could make us more prayer warriors you know that's what they had next chapter 2 they had a prayer they were real prayer warriors so we want to believe if we preach the word and receive the word it will turn us into the word and I just want to preach on this with one Accord in one place I thought I'd preach out this morning but that people interaction so remember I just want to go this again I know I've gone over this numerous times with our vision without the vision we perish and that literally means in the Hebrew a divine prophecy without a divine prophecy we're going to perish like for example think of the foolish virgin or denomination they're all claiming different prophecies but which one is the one that they should be kind or claiming it's the one that we believe about the coming of the Lord in the rapture yet I don't churches that don't even believe in a preacher relation of action have to go through the tribulation and be saved because they're looking at the Jewish Scriptures or looking at the foolish virgins cursors so they're not even sure they think they have the right divided prophecy but we have the state the Lord on the right prophecy and that's again what I'm going to keep bringing this up with Joel 226 church the Spirit is going to bring us right back to where they were to be good right that's the state the Lord so the beginning was what we read in acts 2:1 they were praying they're all one Accord in one place you ever see that that's the beginning got to get back to everybody Prague in one Accord not worry about what sure many more where's or what but soon I got on today or what shoes you got on the day you don't come in here worried about anything else we just got one for right and that's to do the will of God brother Brandon said the same thing in the pick up your pen and write the last days the true church bride comes to the headstone will be the super church is that how we see ourselves right now super in some ways I can see myself I can see how I live compared to other people I can say my that's super was that by my works it's by Christ but in other ways I think well I like I believe we can do more I believe you know we can heal to God more as she nears the great headstone they will be much like him so much like him even they will be in his very image in the order to be united with him that's quite a statement church they will be one they will be the very manifestation of the word of the Living God so see now remember brother Han said the spear wrote this he to write this he said the spirit wrote it so we could go back again the particulars right back to the beginning one two four one place and would be so much like Christ will be in his very image and what was his image brother Graham tells us he had the mind of Christ in other words he never did anything that except to please the father and the Bible said that he did everything that please the father so we've got to come back to where all of our server services all of our songs everything we do please is the father I'm going to be that and I just kinda want to iterate that because really Church you know I hope I can say this the right way really um you know the this is this is a group right here that's going to be here the most right and so we have a responsibility if you come on a Sunday night you really gotta love God or have you know less children or something like that yeah uh because we're having a less Drive but then it was since money as the longest drive so she's putting her faith right out there in the front lines thank God for that but the point is the people that have come here every service you know and live stream every service or trying to watch every service they're the ones that are really going to help the church move forward everybody understand when upset and I just want to reiterate this again and just encourage you by God's grace that we have to be so much like it but we have to go back to the beginnings that's why we keep saying gotta go to keep focused on the Holy Ghost and the Pentecost and all these things and we got to be so much like it until we we do the very works of Christ now so I just want to get a few quotes I guess I'm trying to tie myself don't go too far cuz I didn't like this but I just keep losing track of time and having such good times huh I'm going to believe us now this 1950 how beautiful is that Holy Spirit are sustaining strength to carry the church on if they fail to eat manna they died and if we fail to eat on the Holy Ghost we die if we fail to break through daily all the time keep under the blood you'll wither up and die your Christian experience have you seen people do it of course unfortunately we have is the burdens and reminds there were programs on these poor people but they're the ones choosing to die they're choosing to wither up rather than walk in the light right stand in the light and our friends as well so they have better cost when our man was poured up while they were all gathered in one place is one according was it argue whether they were Methodists Baptists or Luther they were in one place and one Accord expecting God to keep his word now we can learn from that right we got to find which scriptures apply to us and then other and pray those scriptures like I said earlier with Joel chapter 2 in different ones or if it's a healing service we got to pray mark 16 like we prayed this morning by God's grace we got a gather and pray for that because they were expecting God to keep the promise that he'd given in Luke 24:49 this is the promise they are praying for Terry you for in the city of Jerusalem of here and do with power on high for when the Holy Ghost is come upon you you'll be witnesses unto me in Jerusalem Judea Samaria to other parts of the world so I just want you to see understand that there again I know you we know that I just want to remind us of that they were gathered praying and they were believing that this scripture they're pregnant sir and praying Lord bring it to pass and that's what we can do tonight as we can do every service Lord and if you have nothing to pray pray for remember the prophecies that we have for our day Lord restore our East or save the Lord restore the power Lord let your spear who lumps us bringing sinners back to repentance we always got things to bring for a man I think we just get in are we just going to bounce with the enemy we sometimes forget what to pray for but they had expectation they knew jesus promised it and then God blessed it and that's what we need to expectation and then Jesus will bless it amen a hundred twenty people I've gathered together upper room waiting for their sustaining straited and all of a sudden there came a south and heaven like a rushing mighty wind it filled all the house where they were sitting cloven tongues appeared upon them I went to the streets let me tell you something right now Virgin Mary and then was right among them that's right if God wouldn't respect the Holy Virgin Mary to get to heaven any other way besides her see the Holy Ghost woman he said what about you that's right you have to pay the same price which is neat sacrifice get the same experience have the same thing they had back here at the beginning where I tell you when the power of God begin to fall they lost all dignity and everything else I went to the street staggered like drunk men filled with the Holy Ghost Peter says the promises under you your children that lets afar off even Minneapolis Minnesota as many as the Lord our God shall call so even after in Ohio Amen brother I'm telling you very bad that will pay the price will step off for Christ has the right to see the baptism now something you make up an original like felt the beginning like the end of the day of Pentecost hallelujah he said you're going to call me a Holy Roller out so you might as well get used to them all right now the next one was from once more Lord he's closing the service and he prays for that same Holy Ghost out for him what's more lower we messed it up we've organised you broke up our Brotherhood we separate our fellowship we took a little group over there or fight with one another the devil sit back watch us whip one another down Lord is it possible that once more than all hundred and twenty of us to be one Accord in one place is it possible at their cover sound from heaven as a rushing mighty wind once more Lord once more he said less into our feet and say once more Lord once more Oh Lord God hear me Lord once more Lord once more sudden the spirit upon this camp meeting in power and in glory everybody I'm streaming this on the tape he's God it was the last time you screamed that when was last time I screamed that it's got to be a real hunger that's what I'm saying we got to pray to God to give us a real hunger for once more it's got to be a hunger you can hear him screaming in it closely with people shouting and screaming it really crying out to God it was good to hear our sister cry out you know this morning you know I'm here just real sincere don't you like that and all the ones that came up for prayer on where we lose everyone who's praying in their seats we appreciate that but it's got to be a one accord it's got to be the one desire of our hearts now I'm here I'm going to skip it to acts 4 where the Holy Ghost fell again I'm going to skip out of here they gathered with their people they all pray with one Accord and pray in the will of God and coated the scripture why do the heathen rage and the people imagine a vain thing that's from Acts chapter 4 when they prayed the Holy Ghost shook the place that's the kind of meeting we need can you say mid that that's what we have to get we've got to have brothers you got to have it we got to have it let's be fortified by the word of God by the Spirit of God by the power of God amen I can say I can just say honestly I've never heard on action rushing win I've never actually felt an actual shaking maybe some people have talk to people that said they've seen the pillar fire i person ever felt it or seen it but i felt such a holiness that i cried and wept and danced and screamed and shouted and and shook until i could hardly stand it anymore so what we're saying is we just got to get back to one more guy yes and that's what we need that's the kind of meeting we need that's what we got to have it we got to have it the truryde will have it now here's a few hinges I want to just read again but Madison if you have a resenting audience so someone that doesn't like the preacher right unfortunately I have to deal with that sometimes he said the Holy Spirit won't even reveal you've got to have something to work it together there won a place in one Accord and when there came a sound from heaven Russian no matter how much I pray I'll a day and I study pray before the Lord walk down here maybe don't you love me walk up here for that resentment it just grieves him right away he won't reveal nothing but when you walk down here under the anointing and fill your audience under the anointing that's what the Holy Spirit begins the work then and he begins to move and do great things for us so we see that so an endurance is resenting anybody and let me just say this church there's a lot behind us that maybe you're not aware of but that's one thing I think we all need to grow up with I myself if somebody's sinned against us or hurt us we need to go talk to them to their face as soon as possible I just think that's that's a mature Christian jesus said that's how you fix the problem go to them face to face I think you know just by talking and fellowship with different people different churches I think that's true for every church problems we got to take them right to the individual you know of course after prayer want the right spirit you know but see just a little resenting just a little resented of a person no matter how much anointing he had just a little resenting upset with somebody will cause the whole service to be messed up and remember the type is a to remember again I don't have the quotes up here but remember that's akin one man got out of order and it caused 30 people to die right and then they had to God had to swallow the family the earth notice awful things like that but my manager says we're responsible in the same way for that we're responsible so that's that's one thing I wanna pray for I'm right now a few things you can pray for IDN I'm going to try not to be long but just pray that we can do Matthew 18 because that's a real mature Christian I want to make this a little time of Prayer - all right yeah here's that quote I mentioned this morning well the man sent a few nice Phil in Phoenix I preached on a Sunday afternoon where there's divisions and men wouldn't hardly speak to another I seen around 200 ministers better walked out of the altar shake with those hands by over one other shoulders and say they never fuss or be different with one another get let that great Church of God take that attitude tonight and I'll show you the revival of sweetness nation and tear down every nest of Hell there is rather we can preach to our horse and I've done it I've done it you know my fault and our lungs fall out until the people make a move you'll never do nothing that's right we've got to make them move and believe it rather than do it tonight do it tonight stand up for the word stand up the Living Word of God God will manifested amen so we can never to understand that story people were holding grudges and the Holy Spirit wouldn't move until they started acting upon the word we've got to act upon the word and just in the littlest things and I just R this is my thought in the upper room the unity of the laity and the preachers conquered Satan I like that because they are full of II into the word and all passion about the same thing say it always wants to conquer the lady right but here at the day of Pentecost which is where we got to go back to the last image the preachers can conversate hey man I like that like I'm the Holy Spirit turn that around I never thought about that till yesterday or in our study we got to turn that around and we got a conquer Satan by being United in Christ amen here's a Greek word for a quart one Accord it's one night with one passion with one passion now those are going to say this I don't know that record I can't say that homo or homo foo my god I don't know is it come out of two words meaning to rush along and in unison the images of almost musical number of notes are sounded which modify harmonizing pitch in tone as your instruments of great concert under the direction of a concert master so the Holy Ghost blends together the lives of the members of Christ's Church amen so I try to study harmony yesterday on YouTube that was really hard so if I confuse you forgive me but I looked up melody and harmony melody is just like Bing Bing you know thing lardy's weather altogether Dean there are all different pitches and they're all together and that's what it is what a core we're all sounding out to God in other words wrong manifesting Christ at the same time so it's not well just you know our sisters are annoying going here but our brothers we've got evil spirits on us you know more we're upset it's got to be all of us together again that man with what all the same times what crying out to God or you know getting into the sphere worshiping praising God don't you love that feeling Internet I love I love during when I'm solely dirty when I'm not from something back there we have a song leader I love like an you can almost hear it like the people are just under expectation what a core don't you love that oh wow that's what about that's what the most hopefully you feel it in the world to know that these people are hungry and God is going to use you to minister to them oh this is what we desire this is what we want to always have the harmony all of us sounding out God's praises you know sounding out expectation sounding out faint at the same time amen nobody skip ahead a little bit I guess I want to try to keep it short I was comparing the Upper Room to brother Mannis little room on the third Pole but I'm going to skip past that yeah if some of this is a little bit repetitious but please bear with me leave it's important always want to respect one another honor one another and above all things honor God in his house this is what I've been saying the last few weeks you know as a pastor you see I see people come in and out in and out in and out in and out but those who really love God churches they're number one don't get me wrong they serve God at home too but they put the church and the worship above everything else and that's a program set honor God in his house but everything else amen I'll be honest I got six kids six kids they could make a lot of messes sometimes my house is in order when I come to church anyway I don't have time to clean up everything I do you know the children help me they do a great job they all kind of everybody they're such good workers they be so much force but what I'm saying is that some people could say well I would have to be late because I got to wash the dishes you know before I got I could say that - I got folded I didn't get time to this does happen every time but if I've got to make a decision is my house in order or I gonna get the church to study and pray I've gotta put God's house Christian got to do that and got to UM and then when I get home and I'll clean up yeah then I'll get to that and don't get me wrong we should be praying at home and studying I understand that that's what I'm saying but this is a boy this is what brother Han lived he just didn't preachy he left it but God's houses love everything that I want to remind you this like I said I don't know which brothers might be preachers in here would I don't know but this is the reality of the fivefold ministry God fortified I mean he strengthened his army with what himself in the form of prophets apostles Act teachers I'm fighting with them in their pastors what do you do what was God doing listen do everything with the officers of the churches it's God's dress inside dress and a possible profit for see before st. never gets to it doesn't own it what is it God dressed up in his church that's a very humbling thing to say but when I'm going to the Holy Spirit is God dressed up in me you believe that and any preacher for the Sanyo brother Brooks whoever it is and any preacher that's anointed by God God is dressed in them he had God stepping in our shoes you know figuratively he's really not salt you know but he but this is nice when remind us of this the fivefold ministry is so crucial to this art your your part in our church is so crucial everybody's part here is so crucial that we come friend come with one passion and if I'm preaching God's Word and God is with me now like this if that office denies any of this word then it's not God's dressing thing no that's a wolf in sheep's clothing and I don't want to be a wolf that's why I say if I ever make a mistake that's why I came out of those half sheets today please come correct me if I'm making a mistake if I ever make a mistake please come tell me I don't want to mislead God sugar amen I want them to be right with God just like I want to be right with God he said watch that fellow beware of a preacher that denies the word but remember when he just takes what the word says remember that's God does he speak in his word that's why I love to just preach God's Word because I know it's God even not me here's the one about the pastor Graham said get religious questions in your mind I bind you to ask your pastor not me that's because that's why in the past I've asked certain people I don't think anybody here in the in the past I've asked people you know please don't ask other pastors questions like when we go out to eat it's not time to act like with the guest Minister is that time to ask your mother Brooks all of our questions now if you have a question about a personal experience like you believe his gift might help yes ask it when you're asking them doctrine what do you believe about serpents eat or what you believe about this with that and if it's because you're disagree with me then that's not the right thing to do brother Brandon do that program respect to the local pastor I don't mean to make it sound like I'm asking everybody's respect but just the just the dignity just three spective got to have for everybody and the local church that's all I'm saying but like brother Brooks as hell people dream so if you have a dream and you want to interpret it you're praying and maybe ask them about that but if it's something natural let's you know for our home church you're supposed to you're supposed to ask me just have to say like that it'd be like this if you like my wife coming to brother Adam well my husband said we do this with our finances but what do you say that would hurt me I'm going to just tear me up I know my wife wouldn't do that but can you imagine that me Adam how should I treat my children you know my wife says it's fat what do you think you know or sister PO what do you think that's kind of the relationship that it is and we just got to have the respect my program said he's bringing respect to the Apostolic Church and he's the pastor's that you safely thus are trusted the rest of the way if he brought you up to be filled with God's fear and living the life and I trust you're living white rustic they'll be able to answer your questions that's that's all what that's all I want people to just be filled with God's fear a mint that's all we want so hope that helps by God's grace the importance of the fivefold ministry with this rapture like we said it's so crucial program put so much confidence in preachers now people today are saying we don't need a church display date they're putting no confidence in the preacher but brother Brandon put confidence in the preacher because he's the peace of God called man had it's confidence in God it's confidence in college Cooter's okay now here's a good one to perseverance we're going to talk about it's only the elect that will hear the gospel right now I believe that there's a church coming into that perfection that Ministry of perfection where the offices and he goes through the fivefold ministry and pastors and teachers and so forth will be so with the word until the whole thing will work right up to the coming of the Lord that's what he was bleeding the preachers are going to be so with the word I know Wendy get to travel a little few more special meetings but I'm sure she would say the preaching is getting more with the word it's not getting away from the word and you any other Gringo's have tried a little bit too it's been nice for them to travel to the places though God called preachers the words because it's more powerful it's more applicable right it's more right down to the truth that's what matters that would happen and that's what we are looking forward to my God's grace now let me try to find out about we we must do what God is calling us to do you want to learn to sacrifice clothing a light breakfast is kind when I see value around of people and the message I want to get to that let's just hit a few of these here I just hit a few these then we'll move on next one we must do what God's calling us to do now what am I saying God's calling us to sacrifice God's calling us to come here with expectation God's calling us to go back to the beginning and so I would ask would you please pray for me before Wednesday service if you would that would mean the world to me or pray for anyone's gonna sing a song special please because that's what God is calling us to do he's calling us to rally around each other amen and if we do that God bless this program said if we turn the gospel down God will raise up somebody else to do it see if we don't go back to the beginning and start praying and even more so I'm saying even more so you already do but we don't go back to the beginning like that and in one Accord in one place God's gonna raise up somebody else to do it that's that to me that that puts a lot of fear of God in other words I don't want God to push me aside and say oh I'm done with Jesse I want to be one that he can use and this is absolute scriptural there's two examples I thought of Psalm David and then Joshua because one because one person would take the Word of God God had to choose somebody else and here's you know Matt remember this was solved Samuel Colt's saw God would have established your kingdom forever you would've been King forever daughter family he's just okayed the word but because you were prideful because you sacrificed before I got there God's going to raise up somebody else in your place and I've never I don't have a scriptures for Joshua but you know the scriptures of Joshua Moses was supposed to take him in but because he got prideful right and he glorified himself rather he smoked the rock because he did that he got some leaving you in this generation there and raise up Joshua nothing so the same thing is true today if we don't do it God's gonna raise up somebody else going on and my mom and growing up my mom courted this to me all the time because I was you know I was faster than some people you know I would kept winning all these races you know my mom my mom would say Jesse you know people look up to you you need to live the right life I'm like I want to live in sin and everything like that but she always encouraged me to live a Christian life but she would always say this she said Jesse of whom much is given much is required I've never forgotten that you know my mom always kept me humble and that's what Jesus says for whom sever much is given of him shall much be required we have been given the whole message have we not so on the next slide I wrote this we've been given the finished mystery of God in English as we have everything at our disposal as most most languages don't have all the message what are we doing with it and should we be doing more with it amen so just we've been given much but much is required I don't and I know it's human nature it's my nature to get lazy it's my lecture go on it relaxed but we can't do that we got to stay on fire for the Lord okay I'm going to skip a step I don't think I need to read Emma okay here's on if we fail to preach it galleries at the Baptist he certainly will he's going to have a church there without spot or wrinkle there's no time to slack he said it'd be easy now let's start going for the kingdom of God if the minister's won't do it God will raise up businessman to do it to get them together so he sends it over and over and over now here's your's well like now you have a place in God and God has called and called and called never if you like that to go god it's called me I haven't done it yet but look he's so merciful he keeps calling amen he breeds it three times in threes perfection I was going to keep calling you keep calling keep on do you do it so let's surrender praise the Lord let's do that now you fail to take that place someone else will take your place that's why I don't care how hard it gets as a pastor or song leader I'm just going to do in my place amen as struck as I go through my battles and people disagree with me and you should see some believe emails I get sometimes you see some of the comments I get sometimes it can be used to find battles you know but no matter what anybody says I know I've got a place and I was going through my notes I was telling me this I was going through my notes from 2013 and I was writing you know just journaling the Lord to Easter should we end the church and go somewhere else I said Laura I just need one more soul you know that will allow me to stay here and brother God brought in brother amen and since their hula and for the Adam I asked for what a guy gave us three you know which was tremendous and that's before I even prayed that prayer I've heard that fair Jew but to me it just is wonderful to go back and see and remember what God has done for me he's kept us he's answered all of our prayers if we're just sincere about a church God will be with us amen but we got we got to keep our place and we can't fail upon what God God is call us to do now I mention this earlier can we learn to sacrifice athlete we can I believe we can we can learn to sacrifice more my manager said Jesus said come and learn of me take my yoke upon you and learn of me for I D meek and lowly and you'll find rest for your souls now isn't this quite an amazing scripture Jesus says if you want to learn from me I am already meek and lowly so if you're going to learn from somebody neat and lowly you can't be prideful if you're going to learn from some of these unique and lowly right he's already said listen I'm free humph I'm humble person so you basically saying I won't look you have to humble yourself a whole lot and then take my burden upon you well you got to have a bit in other words a week for us when we got to have a small church for a few years or maybe for the rapture yeah I might have a small Church in there heaven that's part of the yoke listen we don't want pretenders in here yes we don't want Judas's no we don't want no anything like that we've seen so many church but it seems like it it's painful it makes me cry makes it hurts me it makes me stay up from 1:00 to 4:00 in the morning a few nights ago I just couldn't sleep you don't think about different situations it's hard it's hard but we must humble ourselves and take his yoke upon it the RAM says this you know with divine healing yet to learn he says you begin to learn if you don't learn there's something wrong we've got to learn we got to learn how to accept God with what it really means like we're helping our sister pray through you know after the service and we try to help her learn where brother Branham said you can you can confess your sins all night he said but until you accept that you're forgiven you will never make any difference you have to accept okay I don't forgive it his word says how forgiving I accept that what do we try to do we try to help people learn to accept God and church that's what I wanna do I wanna learn to accept God for every promise for Supernatural for my family to be say which is the ultimate supernatural Cassady C solo state let me try to find out let me give me compliments that's just a few more and I'll stop right there I don't want to work you out I know I'm starting to feel a little worn out myself so I'm trying to feel that this morning I was if I really get this part of it it's time to hit any little bit a hidden life I love this quote that's what the church needs today is a hidden consecrated life you can't be diddle dabbling along with the world and impersonating and acting like that and hid with Christ because you're trying to fashion after the world you're trying to live like the next church you're trying to belong to better organizations wear better clothes do so and so that's not but that's not comply with Christianity created Christianity is a sacrifice life he didn't like God through Christ see about the Holy Ghost that's what the real Christian life consists of not of how well you can do this or how well you can say that's all right how will you can preach that's fine but that isn't it it's a hidden life consecrating man in other words for me I've got a thought about how I preach it's did I prepare to preach is my is my preparation for Christ is it just here like right before the service or is it at home all week came ahead I have a hidden life with Christ that's what I had God's grace he said the curtains dropped behind you you're dead buried your hidden God through Christ and sealed in there by the Holy Ghost and I read this one a few weeks ago and he said if you want gifts he said you see we want gifts in the supernatural said you're going to sacrifice not money you're going to sacrifice what some your own ideas you have to sacrifice some time you prick you're going to have to sacrifice Naevia stubborn will to break that if you notice you gotta be flexible you're going to have the whole Christian move is sacrificial there's the quote about you as I told you you can't nothing said he waits to the very last minute to kick you before he dies you can't teach a meal nothing but brother Graham's a pedigree Christian is so pedigreed that it can run right straight back to where the book of Acts and see where they came from where they come from they got one Accord that's where they came from and to go through you know the hard times of the crucifixion and the resurrection with and then wait and get one Accord one place one Accord one passion and then bore the same spirit of the same thing acting the same way so when you do this for me huh stenography in order just go to death I'll just close right there is it not miss Tokiko okay let's just pray and then you let me know before you go I'd like to pray a little more on the Sunday mornings and can you let me know if we want to try 10:30 prayer or just maybe start praying at 11:00 so I know some people battle to get here I know it's a battle to get here especially we travel long distance I like to know if we can do a little more group prayer I really feel like there's power in prayer there's power prayer because they had acts to had group prayer I really would like to try it I talked about I mention it for a year now you know I like to see what you prefer is really most chances are you this is a group that's going to be here you know most you guys live in Akron I think it except for Wendy and I appreciate it because I appreciate all the sacrifices you into here it means the world Oh Stella big list we got soul I'll be in a pastor I still love the church you know the God's given us it's a real blessing but if you just think about that as we pray for a few minutes would be better you know to create 10:30 right or 10:30 or 11:00 I can pray right away in the morning you know for that service okay and now let's close just s God help us to be mature and keep all the hitters out you know if there's any anything we have against anybody you know we just use Matthew 18 except talk to numerous fasteners and really seems like that's that's what you searched you know just to be if there's a problem or take care of it you know talk to somebody face-to-face you keep all the unbelief brotherbrother I've said any funny feelings you know keep all the funny feelings out and then God will be pleased with us so let's pray for that it will create I'll just pray together I can even the pottery prayers you know I really do some you write testimonies a member sister bowed out of the written testimonies God healed them and God provided all these things you know I believe in the power your prayers because it's it's sincere you know most people don't have that sincerity we have that we're very thankful for that such as prayed here Heavenly Father more eww tonight or I know it's a very simple topic the Lord your prophet said or your spirit said I need to pick up the pen I've got to go back to me and we got to go and become more like Christ I've got to do it in order the Father I'm not asking it to be immediate like tomorrow and sure be a blessing or God if you could all sacrifice so much more so fast but what I want to grow into this Morgan just like with a planet I can't plant a sermon seed and expect it automatically the next day to be in full fruition hold on but I want to plant these scriptures in the hearts of the church either always on those that live closed those here every service by choice by choice they sacrifice they're already sacrificing or they're already sacrificing this time for you that's what you're promising it's called it it takes prayer God in these sweet quiet moments will of God in these humble moments but I pray that these seeds we planted all of our hearts Lord to go back to the beginning to be in one Accord of the first request Lord was that we could be more mature more God myself on the first or if I've got a funny feeling I'll go talk to someone you're I'll call them nor that we can have a church nor that just so honest and sincere Lord so pure your God help me to your God I need your help I know the church is needed all right as I've talked to brothers or their so much it needs just Lord honest it is so there's so many we just all need to be honest I'm you can bless last any hindrance Lord we just ask to give us grace to overcome it dear God it was graced this church not trying to be like other churches except the book of Acts church or God trying to press anybody we're just trying to please you these people are here to be seen I'm not here to be seen of men nor from managed rewards we're here because we love you Jesus relaxing the power prayers in the power of Sunday night services where it rejuvenates my prayer life where is me strength and revelation or God I've seen the power of that Lord and we just asked to know that tonight these things we've heard what was the treatment that we give the or Christians that hidden up keep all this in out the church and secondly Lord give us the burden give us the wisdom on when to pray together I've talked about it I mentioned it many times we like that to become I like that no reality possible I believe in the power of our prayers of our Saints I believe I'm here to testimonies Lord odda and I thank you for that what I remember when they gave their testimonies of last year Lorna your brother bangs testimonies Lord God knowing that you answer is perhaps how much that means to me me or God or United prayers what we have Nina Morgana is great if you must wisdom we can come too early Lord of night you would have heard atha just to start with a little real prayer to call upon Jesus and harmony more God we can be that one Accord we could be that harmonizing cry or we all cry out Lord say Holy Spirit come grow with us today must be more sincere Lord as you told your problem I was to walk with you you are God that's my prayer here tonight know Jesus and I know you record on this walk out I know it's record on the computer I know you're recording in heaven that means Lord your answers of your God for what I'm asking this in faith I'm asking you to help us to be mature take care of all problems as homely and sweet me as we can right away it also Lord we could in church of prayer warriors parent lawyers Lord our church's name and prayer words could be in the same phrase Bride of Christ fellowship they're a bunch of prayer warriors that's what I was spider into and I want to be a prayer warrior I know these sins want to be prayer warriors mark up to bat on prayer or God like Daniel did here I think that's all of our hearts desire for choices normal chatter these Lord I think you will that's according to your word you said ask anything in my name I do it so we ask the Father these things in the name of Jesus Christ lord I don't know when you'll answer the moment I just pray that you'll enter these requests and Lord it will be part of bringing us back to the beginning what I've said it before without saying it we are the seed of Abraham we can wait 25 years for drums our waiting lord help us to give you glory as Abraham under God believing before we see the promise which is a true sign of thing true sign that we received in evidence Lord of substance it's real no more bless these things and I pray Lord earlier dear God I do love or your I thank you for their sacrifice to be here I think if I love them like I do tear it up for them must be just so much number tremendous I mean maybe I don't express it like I need to or but I which you'll appreciate them unite our hearts in order to fear you as we looked at last week II fear your name to hear what another going to respect one another all we want is to see that scripture the prophecy about us to be fulfilled Lord God that's all we want we just want to walk in the prophecy I was to pray the prophecy and in closing I'll pray that that our vets be full of oil full of wine may we have plenty of bread you are not they may the people of God rejoice invited Christ fellowship and never be ashamed of Jesus Christ that's prophecy when you restore all the years the Antichrist spirit has taken away or from the true church may you restore all of it in our church we pray it Jesus Christ every sin god bless your church you're dismissed over your name mission the Lord just letting you know if you can maybe or email me or text me or something like that let me know prefer maybe 11:30 prayer or 10:30 or left got messy [Music]
