one lord we worship you today we give you all the praise jesus and we're doing our little part with our little talent you gave us god and we're doing that lord to give you praise today so may you be magnified now as we approach the word in jesus christ's name saint said amen god bless you let's take our bibles here let's go to hebrews 11 here i think we'll start there in hebrews 11 by the grace of the lord we'll try to look at this thought i want to keep going in joshua hebrews 11 30. let's read that one hebrews 11 30. all right i'm gonna try to set a timer here i'll try to just preach an hour we'll see how the holy spirit moves but we want to just be sensitive to the time hebrews 11 30. let's read that one together can we on three one two three by faith the walls of jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days amen may goddess blessings of the remus word may be seated praise god i want to just pick up there where we left off and i don't have any slides i didn't have really time to prepare those um because there was so much going on um but i want to pick up there and preach on that uh about crossing over this morning uh but amen i'll just background a little bit for you buddy uh we basically looked at the iniquity of the amorites and we saw how uh 462 years before joshua and moses started driving them out god had given them all that time to repent god knew they were going to backslide into iniquity and uh god gave them all that time but leviticus chapters 18 19 and 20 detail all their sins the reason god spewed them out of the land was mostly sexual sins and then idolatry um there's all kinds of other ones here i should just look at my notes just trying to go off memory oh witchcraft abortion cursing parents and all all those all just any sin any abominable sin in you could imagine and so then we we looked at that we looked at amorites then we saw how the cup of america's iniquities filling up and we just looked at how brother branham said uh america's on a downward angle we saw her position in revelation 13. brother braham says thus saith the lord uh that the persecution from the days of pagan rome will be repeated when the mark of the beast is laid down he said it'll be repeated thus saith the lord uh in the united states that was in 1958 he said that then we saw some false prophets i went through sid roth i i respect the man but i really want him to repent but he's a false prophet you know he missed he false prophesied all those things about chronovirus trump and everything else well now he's predicting uh the greatest revival in history for 2021 where people will be they'll have to put masks back on because of the glory of god like moses that's what he's that's what he's already predicted that the lord told him that so what we found is that lying people just keep lying if they won't repent they just they go deeper into iniquity right just like the amorites if they won't repent they just go deeper and deeper iniquity but thank god we go from faith to faith from glory to glory praise god that's a real christian and so we're we're striving to go along that r that route and then i just ended with a little story from iowa and i probably won't go into too much detail because we're on live stream that maybe i'll share at the end but just about how god can heal god wants to get into our dark places of our lives and he wants his light to shine in there uh and bring healing so i just kind of generally speak it like that cause i don't like when the things are really personal i'm not trying to try to use it as much as i can if god would help me uh so we'll look here tonight let's look at uh across or the walls falling down because we saw that in hebrews 11 30. church what was the key word about the walls falling down by what by faith they fell down this is the faith chapter right and faith is in the greek it's defined as assurance or trust but we know it as a little deeper uh understanding we know it as revelation right because the reason you can trust and have assurance is because god has revealed to you what's going to happen right the reason they had faith the walls were going to come down was because the angel lord had told them the walls were going to come down and everything he'd said had already come to pass right they come through the the they come through the jordan river just like the angel said right they come through the red sea just like the angel said they got water from the rock just like the angel said so in other words we have to differentiate between faith and hope hope is what we think will happen but faith is what we know is going to happen amen and so a lot of times we just have to be honest and say we're operating by hope right because most of us don't go around all the time well i know thus saith the lord exactly what's going to happen well we don't know in many cases we don't know how long you know we're going to be sick or we don't know how long our lost loved one is going to be lost we don't know we don't know how long it's going to be till they're saved unless god will give us a revelation on that but we know those are few and far between right because to do that you have to be a prophet right you have to be a prophet but that's a special gift that gets uh used at special times okay but so let's just look at that thought now by faith the walls of jericho fell down after they were compassed about seven days when they fall down after the people acted upon the word right so we see remember from hebrews hebrews 10 the bible says we must be followers of them who inherit the promises right but first they must have patience and then they inherit the promise praise god so that that's always the order god gives us the word we show patience the word comes to pass amen amen so promise patience and then the fulfillment praise god that's exactly what happened with jericho that's exactly what happens in our lives and i told the testimony um my niece emma i saw her last week at cam church and she said i just want to tell you your dad hasn't smoked a cigarette for five days so brother that's like a that's a little victory for us because he's been smoking for over 50 years so i just want to i want to thank the lord for that praise god all these prayers and i've been praying since i was a boy so that was i've been praying over 30 years that god would help my dad to quit smoking so i'm i believe i'm saying i'm speaking the things that are not as though they are my dad doesn't smoke anymore i'm speaking those things that are not as though they are right my parents though their divorce my parents are getting back together god's going to heal their marriage now i don't have a revelation of that but i'm speaking it by hope right and i'm trusting that god my faith is god can do it i don't know that he's gonna do it but that's my confidence in god my hope in god that he will do it so i'm calling those things that i prayed for i'm calling those things that are not as though they are so i was a great testimony i was really encouraged by that because i've been praying for that over 30 years so i'm just going to trust that the lord will finish what he started so saints faith brings walls down faith will bring down every obstacle remember the bible says we overcome by faith the bible says praise god that's i believe in the book of uh first john uh our victory is even our faith yeah let me pull that up there uh so we can uh so we can read it right out of the scripture some of these i don't have memorized so bear with me i have to search them in the dictionary real quick here or the lexicon first john 5 4 for who i'm sorry for whatsoever is born of god overcometh the world and this is the victory that overcometh the world even our faith hallelujah so anyone who overcomes you know lust and adultery and and and bitterness and and uh lust and and greed all these temptations anyone who overcomes that overcomes by jesus's faith praise god hallelujah so that's an anointing right you are anointed with the faith of christ uh paul said i don't do this by my faith but he said this life i live i now live by the faith of the son of god who gave his life for me and died for me praise god we're living by jesus faith right now praise god i'm an overcomer in the satan's eden right now by jesus's faith praise god hallelujah that's how i'm overcoming the world is the faith of god because i'm born of god and through the the holy spirit in me i overcome the world praise god hallelujah now i want to read this one um for our brother mj and maybe for the children here so we go to john chapter 7. i just want to lay this thought in here that the old testament saints could not have the full baptism of the holy ghost until the blood of jesus was shed that shouldn't be a surprise to many of us and i don't know if it is to you or not but for example david david overcome goliath but then he fell into adultery that's because he didn't have the baptism of the holy ghost they got every the believers got the baptism of the holy ghost on the day of pentecost and then they didn't do those things they didn't you know you never see paul and peter committing adultery right or getting drunk like noah so while we can gain we can gain uh courage from the old testament saints but at some point we have to say we have access to more power than what they had yes right because david fell to adultery david was a murderer right but now that the holy ghost is here now we overcome the world because we're born of god amen hallelujah praise god that's right there had to be a difference between the old and new testament the difference was a new covenant he said i'll give you my spirit praise god hallelujah ezekiel 36 records it very well i'll give you a new heart a new spirit and then my spirit praise god the three works of grace justification same the baptism of the holy ghost let's read that here because that'll be a good help to us as we go along uh john 7 37 and i got any uh teenage readers back there notice i said teenagers my teenage children lydia and malachi lydia can you read uh 37 and 38 and then maokai read 39. wonderful let's stop right there this is before jesus is crucified right and he's already saying come to me and get the holy ghost but look at verse 39 he's giving them a little bit of a he's giving them an invitation early to let him know that they keep following him they will get the holy ghost they will get the living water right because look at verse 39 malachi could read that all right that's a great lesson most churches can't catch that brother mj i'm not sure how much you've heard about that but most people believe mj when you believe you fill with the power of god that's not true because when i first believed i didn't have hardly any power to do many things i couldn't overcome the cussing and the dirty magazines and the movies i couldn't overcome them yet because i didn't have enough power i was just saved but then as i got closer to god he gives you more and more anointings like peter said that's what that picture is over there by the mj he gives you anointing of faith and virtue the knowledge that's right on second peter chapter one he gives you all those powers and then charity is love and god is love and god is the holy ghost so that that last anointing is charity that's the baptism of the holy ghost so that's how we teach it here uh because when after i got saved i still smoked a little bit i still chewed a little bit of tobacco you know still said some words i should not have said but as i went along god gave me more and more power he was building me up in the grace of god amen and that's where most churches miss it they tell people oh you've got you'll do greater works than jesus that's that's impossible nobody can do greater works than jesus they just misunderstand the scripture right john 14 12 says greater works that will ye do because i go to my father he wasn't saying greater miracles he meant more miracles right if you can do a greater work than walk on water and heal people while you're walking on water do some and then create food while you're walking on water if you can do a greater miracle who's going to do that nobody can do that because that's not what jesus meant jesus met the holy ghost will be in every all these believer's souls so more miracles will be done praise god amen and don't be discouraged church the book of acts was written over 30 years so all those miracles are spread out over 30 years we read it like oh it's every day was a miracle every day was not a miracle right so don't be discouraged did you know on one of those days there was an argument between the the widow grecians remember that this day there was no miracles there was arguing well we're getting we're not getting as much daily bread as the jewish women what's wrong and so what they do they had a little meeting we got to have some deacons here right the preachers got to focus on prayer and the word but we got to have men that will give these grecian widows their daily bread they're not getting their daily portions so that day was no miracle other than the miracle of humbling them i guess you could kind of joke around and say it was a a miracle of humility but these are spread out over over 30 years right the book of acts church right there was great miracles but there's also learning just learning how to love one another learning that we need deacons right we need preachers we need prayer warriors amen we need people that will make clothes for people like tabitha dorcas right she made clothes we need people in the clothes ministry right clothing the the the naked or the poor we need people that'll feed the poor praise god we need all these ministries and that's where that book is spread out over 30 years so church let me say it like this we're a part of the book of acts church praise god there's healings we're helping the sick and praying for the sick helping the poor in our little ways that we do it we're building up we're teaching we're training we're people are getting the holy ghost amen people being filled with the holy ghost we're a part of that book of acts church so let's do our part well praise god all that god's calling us to do let's not shirk any responsibility let's meet every responsibility like i was telling the mj if we just seek to seek the lord first everything else will be added enough praise god that's all we have to do just put god first put him first every day and everything else he'll work it out he'll lead you and guide you praise god nothing to worry about there's no worry here praise god paul said don't be anxious for anything amen see that's why you can relax put god first relax the holy spirit's gonna just direct the rest of your day praise god that's what i've seen i've just been serving god now what 21 years so that's what i've seen in my 21 years is that the lord works out everything if we just put him first okay so i hope that helps oh yeah there it is very very saying to you he that believeth on me the works that i do shall you do also greater works than these shall he do because i go to my father nobody can do greater works than jesus i've still never seen anybody uh take mud rub them in a man who has no eyes and make eyes show me somebody that could ever do that they can't do that nobody can do greater than jesus it means more right means more now let's get back to jericho by faith the walls of jericho fell down so see church that their faith made them obey every command from the holy spirit then the walls finally came down can i say like this they had to wait a whole week until they saw the answer to their requests so let's not discourage let's not be discouraging if we have to wait a few days or a few weeks or a few years right let's not be discouraged let's have faith praise god they had to obey all the word until the walls came down they couldn't break it they couldn't they couldn't get tired on god amen they had to keep that word and then the walls came down praise god so remember let's go back to galatians 5 6. can you pull up there galatians 5 6. i just want to reiterate this faith will always follow the word or the directions of the word so this is such a beautiful scripture this has helped me so much in my walk with god when my works get cold i realize i've got to go renew my love because works flow out of faith but faith flows out of love so because the bible says faith works by love so the right order is love faith works that's the right order right if we really love god then our faith will be built up and then we'll want to work for god that's what paul says faith only works by love so our only motivation to work and help the poor give him clothes or give him money or praying fast the our only motivation for that is our love for god it's not fear it's love praise god amen right because god has not given us a spirit of fear but a power and love and a sound mind amen love is motivating us skipping meals right love motivates us to pray this pray for the sick and get the prayer cloth out love motivates because we love god and we know god loves us amen that's right see so by faith the walls of jericho went down to see because they loved god they had faith and then they went to work now history says they had to march 30 minutes around that jericho compound there's a 30-minute walk every day right and they were silent those first six days let's go let's read that now let's go to joshua 6. just to kind of get an idea beautiful story a church there's something walking around sometimes god will honor people's faith like this let me just while you're turning there let's let me tell this testimony when we were growing up my mom and dad were divorced you know that across the street was a bar and it was really loud especially on friday and saturday nights well we have church on sunday but mj my mom got she got so moved she's like she would call the cops and be like we're trying to get my teenagers to bed we have church in the morning and the bar would open up their doors and you can hear the rock and roll i remember i couldn't even sleep many times so my mom said i'm doing like a jericho march she she went around that bar and walked around that barf for weeks and weeks and they finally shut down the bar they broke some laws and so the the cops found out they broke some laws in the back they shut them down now they opened back up a year later my mom went around and then they and then the cops would come around and force them to shut the door so we could sleep so in other words it was no longer a problem because that's how my mom could pray you know she didn't have a husband so and i remember her i would physically see her walk out in the morning and walk around the barn just lay hands on the bar and pray and say this this bar is going to close this bar is going to close their door my children are going to get sleep that's a pretty good to me that was a great testimony just as a child oh yeah and then my mama my brother cam got hurt in track and field we were on the we were on the relay team the four by one we did the four by one his senior year he got hurt he tore his was it ace mcl mcl because it wasn't an acl mcl acl will knock you out for good you know at least for a year she had he had an mcl tear you know what my mom did cam really wanted to run his senior year i think he he heard it in uh november and so track was coming around he needed to be healed so he could run track his senior year usually they take like six to eight months my mom and him walked around the track in the snow praying like it was like a jericho march it's a 400 meter for a track is 400 meters so they would walk i forget how many laps they would do but cam and you could ask cam this day cam said while they were walking cam had shorts on by the way which we don't believe in shorts because they're immodest right they show off your your nakedness cam had shorts on he had a brace on and he said i felt the burning sensation of the holy ghost healing my leg and cam ran his senior year we set this we set the school record in the 4x1 because god healed his mcl early now don't tell me god don't honor faith church see that's two that's two examples of walking so there's something with praying and walking i'm not making a doctrine i'm just telling you people will take inspiration from the word of god in other words they just pray more can i just say like that hallelujah they just put some action to their faith praise god they just work based upon the faith praise god i heard a preacher tell a story and he said every time his dad would leave on a missionary trip the kids would get sick and he's like i'm tired of this every time i go my kids get sick he said he took his dad took all the kids around the perimeter of their uh estate and they walked and they just kept praying for healing healing healing he said after that i think they made like 10 trips to india he said after that not one child got sick before every time he leave there'd be sickness sickness sickness would strike the family and he said i got tired of it he said i need a victory over this jericho now come on church there's three examples right there the jericho of a loud bar the jericho of sickness every time god's servant's going to leave right and the jericho over knee injury amen our god is mighty and battle praise god amen see there's just three simple examples of someone looking at the word and say my if they got a victory i can get a victory i'm just going to take god at his word and really there's no miracle and walk the miracle doesn't come by walking the miracle comes by believing and praying praise god so you just pray while you walk right you're just praying you talk to god while you walk and then god can do great things how many believe that amen i've seen it three times in my life well i'm sorry i've seen it two times in my life the other one i didn't see i just heard that one preached okay so joshua chapter six i hope that's a blessing there joshua chapter six so see church if we want to see the jericho's come down in our lives we really have to obey the word of god now like i said some of them like abraham they might take it 25 years so i'm not promising you something's going to happen tomorrow it may it's all in god's hand i'm not the promise keeper jesus christ is the promised keeper praise god he's the promise giver and the promised keeper praise god so in other words we have to tap into his mind what's his mind what's his timeline for answering my prayers right and then you can be content like last week let me just tell this testimony last week we had a sister come up for prayer her husband left her 12 years ago and she said i just need to know yes or no is he coming back and i said sister i said listen i said don't put that right now i said god may not give you that right now i said you don't have to live in in fear and not knowing and i took i took that bible right there i said the bible says if you make your request unto god then the peace of god will keep your heart i said and i said you have great faith sister because she does she has great things she she actually wants her husband she's given adultery so many times he actually wants she actually wants him to repent and come back and be part of the family and be a father to the children they've had i said well that's one i said that's fine that's beautiful make your request known to god and we wept there and she cried and praised her hand and scream and praise the lord you know but the whole point was you have to wait until god shows you what he's going to do but while you're waiting the peace of god should rule your life amen right we shouldn't be anxious about anything there's no reason to be anxious if god's offering us peace right now praise god if you have the peace of god then you're not worried about the future praise god because you know he has it in his control praise god he's got the whole world in his hands amen we need to sing that song but that's a reality everything is ordered by the lord praise god the footsteps are right of the righteous our order of the lord we know that we know that we know that let's act like it praise god let's let's have the peace of god because we know god is in control of my life amen he's allowing this test to increase my faith that's what we saw with his sister and she was so happy afterwards you know i said sister i said i said now you watch the preaching i said you watch how your pastor preaches the next few weeks god might give you the answer is he coming home yes or no but i said while you're waiting the peace of god promises to be on you and if it don't come it's because you don't believe it right because the bible says if you request and give thanksgiving the peace of god comes it's a guarantee praise god amen absolute guarantee i appreciate a woman's faith like that that was great faith now joshua chapter six let me get since you're hopefully your turn there now now jericho was straightly shut up because the children of israel none went out none came in and the lord said unto joshua see i've given into thine hand jericho and the king thereof and the mighty men of valor now look it's past tense i've already given to you right that's how god is you already got the victory you're already going to overcome don't worry about the outcome you're gonna get the victory right verse three and you should compass the city all ye men of war and go about the city once thus shall thou do six days and seven priests shall bear before the ark now look where are they at they're before the ark so the priests with the horns are before the ark seven trumpets of rams horns and the seventh day you shall come to the city seven times and the priest shall blow with the trumpets and it should come to pass that when they make a long blast with the ram's horn and when you hear the sound of the trumpet all the people shall shout with a great shout and the wall of the city shall fall down flat and the people shall send up every man straight before him and joshua the son of nun called the priest and said to them take up the ark of the covenant and let seven priests bear seven trumpets of ram horns before the ark of the lord and he said to the people pass on encompass the city and let him that is armed pass on before the ark of the lord so you have the armed man with swords right and then you have the priests with the ram's horns then you have the ark okay so you have our men soldiers trumpet holders ram horns holders then you have the ark of the word see the order that's the order and that's why we do our church service the way we do right we should have prayer first those that are fighting with the the prayer on the battling right the full armor of god amen praying for the success of this day praise god praying for the success of the song service of the preaching of the word that the sick could be healed praise god that if we have anoint people with oil we can anoint them with oil and the prayer of the faith will save the sick praise god and then we have the rams horns or the singers the musicians right the armed men the musicians and then comes the preaching of the word amen then comes the ark the bloody word amen there's blood on the mercy seat above the word amen the bloody word then comes the word praise god amen so that's the order this is where we get the order of our church services soldiers who pray and fight with the word singing preaching of the word praise god verse 8 and it came to pass when joshua had spoken to the people that the seven priests bearing the seven trumpets of the ram's horns passed on before the lord and blew with the trumpets and the ark of the covenant of the lord follow them so see music and then the word see that's why music's so powerful hallelujah it just prepares the way for the word so you ought to come out of song service and preach to me amen give me the word of the lord amen i want it i'm saying to jesus i've worshiped him tell me what he says now give me his word preacher right give me give me thus saith the word praise god see that's how it goes now look at verse 9 the armed men went before the priest so see our men soldiers with swords go before the musicians that blew with the trumpets and the reword came after the ark the priest going on and the blowing of the trumpets and joshua commanded the people saying he shall not shout nor make any noise with your voice neither shall any word proceed out of your mouth until the day that i bid you shout then shall ye shout and so the ark of the lord compassed the city going about it once and they came into the camp and lodge in the camp and josh rose early in the morning and the priest took up the ark of the lord when did he rise up early he had specific directions from the lord see if you want a real victory you got to give god your best amen you got to seek god first praise god joshua didn't sleep in he woke up early now sometimes you do need to sleep in let me say that but if you're in battle and you're at a time where god's calling you to battle you have to get up early and seek the lord praise god jesus did it remember jesus david did it all the men of god did it abraham did it if you want that victory you got to get up and show god he's more important amen that's what people tell me they say how do you get up at 5am i say well i got a port appointment who's your appointment with jesus yes he's more important than my boss at school right right so i i can't miss that appointment so it's important to me i'm going to be there that's my time with the father and what's the reward being in his presence amen that's the reward praise god right it's not like i get chocolate or i get a egg mcmuffin out of it or no no the reward is just talking with god amen amen fellowshipping he said i'm knocking on the door and he said open with me i'll come in and stop with you and you with me my reward is eating with jesus hallelujah feasting on his word praise god enjoying his fellowship just talking just casting my cares upon the lord jesus i can't handle this you take this day has a lot lord you go before me i need you in this hour how many could say men in the hatch see we have all these we can be on time for work because we got an appointment we got to make some money but there's greater appointments than that yeah that's you mean you'll be on time for work for mammon but you won't be on time for spiritual riches something's wrong that's true church something's wrong now it's not it's not a legalistic thing but it's when when your heart has grown to love fellowship so much with god like joshua there's a time to seek the lord praise the lord i just want you to understand that i'm not trying to condemn anybody because sometimes i go i i sleep in those 5 30. sometimes i sleep into 6 or 6 30. you know but i want to put god first and i want to be sensitive to the holy spirit to remember that he he deserves first place above everything else see that so he wrote rises early in verse 12 the priest took up the ark of the lord and the seven priests bearing seven trumpets of ran horns before the ark of lord went on continually and blew with the trumpets and the r men went before them so see you have our men so can you just picture that soldier's going before you you have soldiers what what an army this is imagine what an army you have all these armed men going before you and after that you got the trumpet you got the music and then after that you got the word oh that sounds like a great church service to me praise god all these warriors walking in ready to pray and then we got the music and then we got the word coming this is god's army this is a joshua invincible army church praise god that's why we're still standing today is because we're invincible army when the word is first amen so true see we we learn these lessons see now verse 14 the second day they compass the city once returned the camp so they did six days and it came to pass on the seventh day that they rose early about the dawning of the day so right about when sun comes up encompass the city after the same manner seven times only on that day they compass the city seven times now i said i said it this morning god was like a silent assassin here right six days there's can you imagine the people looking over the walls you know they had armed men out there what are these people doing what are these people doing and god was making god was making them god was tormenting them because he was going to pour out his wrath upon them all the incense or i'm sorry all the incest they did all the murders all the adulteries all the all the rape they did god was going to destroy them he was bringing his wrath so he lets them shake there for six days but don't forget rahab had time to get saul saved amen see god had for anybody who wanted to save be saved god had a house where they could be saved amen god had a place of refuge amen even in the midst of a corrupt nation god always has a place of refuge amen there's always a hiding place oh there it is the secret place there's always a place in the cleft of the rock amen where god will hide the real believer praise god amen so while they were silent six days rahab's like get him in come on look get him in get him in that's what we see today we see the judgments of god are falling get in the ark get in the baptism of the holy ghost you children if you're not born again be born again praise god i don't know what brother mj has been been taught but if he's not born again i say be born again praise god i say it to our church all the time if we're not born again be born again get in that home where the scarlet cord is hanging because that home won't be touched by the wrath of god that home is a home of rest a home of mercy praise god the promise of god will stand and when judgment falls that home will be spared praise god because of the blood of jesus christ that's right thank god so that's the seventh day they rose up and they go about seven times now this is just this is just my thought i could be wrong but for but for six church ages there was no shout so six days there was no shout the shout only came on the seventh day because the rapture comes in the seventh church age that's just my thought okay because i'm typing this to the end of the world because paul said there's a shout voice trump at the rapture right so a shout means a stimulating cry it awakens you and it gives you a direction that's in the greek so see the shout was the ministry of brother william brown that was the shout it started a revival in 1947 it's still going on today amen hallelujah still going on today in us praise god in our sister churches and all those who love jesus christ with all their heart soul mind and strength amen still going on today it awakened the bride it awakened the people said trim your lamps make yourself ready go you got to meet him praise god there was no shout in the first six church ages only the seventh that's the way i can see it by god's grace i see it as a type now there has to be seven rounds seven cycles here in the in this on the seventh day so seven cycles on the seventh day now i don't know what that means i just think it means seven seals that's uh because the seven seal book is open in chapter six right and then that that book comes down in chapter 10 of revelation that open book the seven seals are now loose and it has to go to around the world right every nation people tongue so to me i'm just guessing but i think it's the seven seals because you have a seven on the seventh right seven revelations uh this case would be seven revolutions on the seventh day but it's it seems like it's very connected okay that's just a side note because that that's really not the the emphasis of the text okay so yeah i wanna make sure i just uh preach these thoughts here that i think are important now verse 16 it came to pass the seventh time when the tree when the priest blew the trumpets joshua said the people shout for the lord hath given you the city and all the city shall be accursed even it and all that are therein to the lord only rahab the harlot shall live and she and all look at that all that are within her that are with her in the house remember paul told that philippian jailer believe on the lord jesus christ and thy and thy house shall be saved in other words anyone who believes in your house will be saved praise god but they have to believe because she hid the messengers that we sent because she honored the word she's going to escape the wrath of god glory verse 18 and ye in any wise keep yourselves from the accursed thing lest you make yourselves a curse when you take of the accursed thing and make the camp of israel curse and trouble look that's a prophecy right because we knew aiken was going to take we know now aiken was going to take something now look at that 99.9 percent of the church obeyed right only one man disobeyed and it caused death 36 people died at the next battle because one church member disobeyed see how important is for us to come to church confess our sins right think about that are any of our unconfessed sin could be keeping one of these brothers from sisters from getting healed could be right we don't we don't know so we got to come to church and confess all of our sins remember paul said he said because you didn't judge the bodies and many are weak and sickly among you and many have died let's read that first corinthians 11. just for uh the sake here i don't know brother mj did you know that scripture brother okay that's a good one to read then thank you buddy first corinthians 11. this was and brothers a fresh revelation to me just this past year uh because i never i never really thought there was curses in the new testament but there are there are because this is a curse first corinthians 11. so starting in verse 23 is the communion order eating of the bread drinking of the cup now look at verse 27 whosoever i'm sorry wherefore whosoever shall eat this bread and drink this cup of the lord unworthily shall be guilty of the body and blood of the lord so people who go through communion and don't treat christians right they're going to be guilty right of mistreating christ verse 28 but let a man examine himself and so let him eat of that bread and drink of that cup for he that eateth and drinketh unworthy eateth and drink a damnation to himself not discerning the lord's body for this cause many are weak and sickly among you and many sleep many all because now we do it out here brother mj we get out i i usually make the communion bread and we already have wine that somebody made so we do it right here i pull we know we pull it out here and the bible said many people died in the corinthian church because they didn't examine themselves and treat the other people the right way and yet this church had lots of gifts they had so many tongue speakers he had to say just do three at the most remember that that's in chapter 14. they had so many prophecies and gifts but yet they had so many people die too because they weren't discerning the lord's body we need to be very careful how we treat one another with love mercy kindness and respect right because look just just mistreating someone in the body may cause you to get sick may cause you to to die by mistreating someone so let's be very careful how we treat one another amen praise god i want to show you that now back to joshua 6. i just thought i'd bring that out i hope that was a blessing there god warns them don't touch anything in here it's all it all needs to be destroyed okay verse 19 but all the silver gold vessels of brass and iron are consecrated unto the lord they shall come into the treasury of the lord so the people shouted when the priests blew with the trumpets and it came to pass when the people heard the sound of the trumpet the people shouted with a great shout that the wall fell down flat so the the people went up into the city every man straight before him and they took this city this reminds me of when paul was in prison and they sang at midnight and and everything shook and every and they were able to get out by the praises of god amen but notice in this day they had to hold it in for six days can you imagine not praying or not speaking the word for six days oh i imagine they just felt they were just ready to shout but he said you stay quiet for six days he said save that shout save that victory shout for the seventh day save it for the time you're really gonna get the victory praise god and they had it all bottled up it's like new wine glorious like elijah with that new wine he had to wait wait for job to get done wait for his three friends and then he let forth all that revelation there in the book of job new wine this is throwing up new one this is you in other words this is you and i waiting for the opportunity to witness to our loved ones can i say it like that this is you and i holding our words until we know that's when the holy spirit wants us to say it see and it may be a great battle maybe a great test but if we wait upon the lord if god's telling us to wait then we wait right i always i just i do like this when i'm talking to somebody i just say lord give me the opportunity lord let them ask you a question lord i'm ready to say it if you'll give me a chance most of the time i don't get the chance because they'll leave or something will happen but i love when i get the chance right i love when i get the chance now when on thursday when i met brother mj he's the one that he said oh i love your hat he said that jesus had on so that was god opening up that conversation and but when i put on that hat that morning i was ready i whenever i put it on i'm saying lord i'm ready to tell anybody about jesus if they say anything negative i'm going to tell them how could i say anything negative about jesus he healed my mom of cancer what are you going to say then most people love their mom you know right so i'm ready i'm always ready with that comeback oh you don't love your mom god heal my mom jesus gave my mom a cancer that's why i wear this hat i'm not ashamed of the gospel amen it's the power of god under salvation amen hallelujah amen so anyways he he made that statement and remember i said brother i said something like this said i said i love to i love jesus he healed my mom of cancer how could i not love jesus and then he started testifying to me about all god had done to him i remember that worker there was a worker right next to you she was listening over smiling looking at us so see there's a chance we got to witness the love of jesus to his co-worker now whether she repents or not or whatever she heard about at least two miracles god did in our lives praise god so just waiting for that right moment i'm glad you said that brother see that's what we have to do talk about jesus amen testify about jesus amen so people can hear the word of god it's a blessing to it's a any opportunity to get this speak the name of jesus is a privilege to us amen it's an absolute privilege now verse 21 they utterly destroyed all that was in the city both man and woman young and old ox and sheep and ass and the edge of the sword so in other words god was saying on this battle in particular i'm taking all the spoils this is mine in other words this is my first fruits this is for me now if you look at all the rest of the battles joshua got to fight all of them take all the spoils but not this one god said jericho's mind this big fight this big this big warrior i'm showing you that i'm going before you i'm showing you that i'm the captain of the host joshua you're not the captain i'm the captain amen and if you lean upon me i'll give you victory after victory you'll go from strength to strength from glory to glory from bible experience to bible experience amen hallelujah and i'm taking all the credit on this one i'm thinking i'm doing everything comes to me on this one you can have all the other ones but this one's mine the first is always god's always pay your tithes first that's right before you pay any bills pay your tithes god will bless you i'm a witness no doubt always pay i used to wait till saturday night on the day i get paid on thursday i pay on thursday now even before the funds are actually my bank account i just pay it early i want to be i want god to be first i know he's faithful now look everything goes to god but joshua said unto the two men that spout the old country verse 22 go into the hare's house bring out thence the woman and all that she had as she swearing to her and the young men that were spies went in and brought out rahab and her father and a mother and her brother and all that she had and they brought out all her kindred and left them without the camp of israel can you imagine rahab going out of there can you imagine she's probably screaming and shouting crying my whole family saved everybody else died and said it was slain but we're all saved i got all my family i got my my nieces my nephews i got my mom and my dad god saved all of us all because of grace all because i heard the word and believed amen let that be our testimony praise god i believe every word of god i'll hide the word of god in my heart praise god lord just save all my family that's my prayer amen everybody else was dead laying around all the destruction but just her and her family comes out we're the victors we're more than conquerors god spared us amen god kept his god keeps his word amen hallelujah the only family that made it out was rahab's family the harlots family oh hallelujah because the blood washes white as snow beautiful verse 24 they burnt the city with fire and all that was there and only the silver the gold the vessels of brass and of iron they put the treasury of the house lord and joshua saved rahab in the the heart of the lie look they're still calling her a harlot but like the preacher said one day in heaven she won't be rahab the harlot she'll be sister rahab because there we know heart that's there the harvest is destroyed in the lake of fire right there's no harness they're just forgiving saints there amen because we're all heartless spiritually right any friendship with the world is adultery with god so god forgive us we got and he will he will forgive us and i'm almost done i got 11 more minutes on my hour so bear with me here uh and her father's household verse 25 and all that she had and she dwelt in israel even unto this day because she hid the messengers which joshua sent to spy out jericho see see just hide the word in your heart and god will bless you that's all she did she just hid the word right my girls asked me this week was it okay to sin and i said well scripturally it's only okay to lie if you're hiding messengers scripturally right that's that's the one time god honored a lie right i mean can you think of another one you say okay yeah yeah me too i've always wondered about that how could god but god but that's the whole reason even hebrews records that that's her faith caused her to lie no so that's really something the bible said by faith rahab received the messengers and hid them from the guards so that's really it's just really something but that's the one time god allowed it where it seemed like it worked out for his glory oh let me share this too church even out of our worst decisions god can still bring redemption i cam or simon i heard simon preach this on wednesday so i'm preaching simon's thought here we remember lot being saved out of sodom right he was saved out of the homosexual community right he and his two daughters were saved well we know they did evil things what evil thing did they do incest right that was an awful thing but i just want you to show out of that came moab right and moab was always a thorn in israel's side but god was so gracious that even out of a cursed seed like moab god would call out a ruth hallelujah look out of incest god still offered their offspring grace and mercy and saved anyone that wanted to believe even ruth and he gave her so much grace she he he made her what grandmother to david and great great great great great grandmother to jesus christ our lord amen look so even out of evil situations god still delights in life amen god delights in mercy amen even out of an awful act so even like someone that would rape be raped and have a child they should keep protect that baby because god would use that baby for his glory right even out of something so awful as incest god could bring out a roof god could bring out a boaz right an obed a jesse a david all the way down so you get a godly the baby the baby jesus praise god the messiah the savior of the world now wrap your mind around that a little bit i have a hard time wrapping my mind around that sometimes out of incest god could bring out a ruth out of the lineage that speaks love to me god is a god full of compassion full of love that's beautiful thought i never thought that i heard simon say i'm like oh my goodness no wonder god uh god was merciful you know because he knew there'd be a ruth come out of there there probably wasn't many saved out of there but there was one that really believed faithful ruth hey amen got some of this virtuous roof amen because this whole city knows she's a virtuous woman amen such a godly woman that came out of there she said your god will be my god naomi is that right wherever you go i'll go because you've got holiness you've got that law you've got jehovah's on your side amen your god jehovah's my god amen i see the love of god in your life praise god i want to be like you so i'll go wherever you go and it letter into the lineage of the messiah amen amen oh my thank you lord beautiful story beautiful i can't do it justice in my in my backward preaching style i can't do it justice but anyways look what god can do out of a harlot's home he can bring salvation i wonder what other acts may have happened in that home but at the end it became a home a haven it became a haven of rest it became a house of deliverance praise god hallelujah that's what god he he's an expert in that he's an expert on taking awful things cleaning them up and making them so beautiful because that's what he did in my life my awful dirty life my my sin soaked life he cleaned me up he took spin me around right wash me with this blood and now i'm a sanctified holy ghost-filled saint amen hallelujah blameless the bible said we have blameless before the public praise god we should be blameless before one another amen you can say that about me as a sinner i had a lot of things you could blame me for but now by the blood of christ we're blameless amen yeah we fall short but we say we're sorry we're blameless it's under the blood all right let's finish this chapter then we'll be done here i still got six minutes on my hour so you've been a patient group you've been patient so i want to encourage the people like i preached this morning i don't know if you saw it but i preached this morning about falling asleep in church it's okay if it's you know i ate too much because then you can change that you can eat less next time right i can change that or i didn't get enough sleep last night i can change that well hopefully with our little kids sometimes it's hard right brother thank you sometimes especially my wife bless your heart uh so so there's things if we're sleepy they can change but we have to make sure we don't get the spiritual slumber of the comp the backsliding state of a back of a lukewarm christian because that will that that's a real demon spirit and the example i gave was we used to have people come to the church that they would sleep almost every service i was preaching now when a guest preacher would come in they were all shouting amen wow wow but when i preach for the bang every time they're sleeping and i knew their life they were up all night watching youtube netflix huh so they missed out think about all those nuggets they missed out on think about all the bread they missed out on think about all the drinks of living water they missed out on because that demon power they'd stay up all night to watch sin and they enjoyed that sin but then when it come to the real thing the real the real power of god that's changed our lives they're sleeping right through it and then church sometimes laugh about it laugh about sin that's how you know you're really backslidden when satan gets you to laugh at sin sin paul said should make us tremble right he said work out your own salvation with what fear and trembling paul said kick out that brother who's sleeping with his stepmom he said you should have mourned over this in other words you should have fear and trembling that this man was sleeping with his stepmother get him out of the church he shouldn't be in the church so see many times how people act during the preaching kind of shows their spiritual state i'm not talking about once in a while if you had a rough night i'm not talking about that i'm talking about if service after service people don't feed on the word and then they wonder why they don't have more god in their lives to me that proves beyond a shadow of a doubt they're in sanctification still because that's the attitude of israel after they rejected the promised land this morning they called the they called the manna light bread and they started loathing it right in other words they they didn't like coming to church anymore they'd rather stay up late and watch youtube now and they watch violence on there there's a killing on there there's evil words there's sexual scenes on there and say they got the holy ghost i'm sorry a holy ghost-filled saint eats on the real corn in the land the mature the mature meat of the word amen hallelujah praise god amen they enjoy the meat of the word discerning good and evil right growing in the things of god getting stronger in our faith not falling away but pressing on amen forgetting those things out of the past pressing on with the high mark of the high calling in christ jesus amen hallelujah so that proves to me beyond a shadow of a doubt they've made the word of god light bread i love this light bread broth ram talks about you should look it up he said his church members that don't enjoy coming to church anymore that proves beyond a shadow of doubt their attitude towards the word they are not born again because they're still in the wilderness you never saw joshua saying oh this is light we don't like this corn land oh they ate it all up brother sister they ate up all that corn and all the good corn and the meat of the land and the milk and honey they're they're feasting they're drinking milk and honey on the bread and oh my they're enjoying all the blessings of god that's what we get three times a week amen by the word of god feasting on milk and honey and the meat of the word hallelujah amen i've listened to other churches they don't preach the meat like we do right they preach the little bits of it here but not the meat like we get down into the deep things of god the mysteries of god they don't get down deep like we do they say oh as soon as you say a prayer just say a little prayer you're filled with the holy ghost and they got no power at all jesus said when you got the holy ghost he said power power to be a witness is coming upon you amen hallelujah and they get saved and they're i don't even know if i should be baptized well when they got the holy ghost when peter prayed for carnius and they got the holy ghost he said i command you to go be baptized and they said where's the water let's be baptized amen see they had power to be a witness praise god i'll publicly be buried in the name of the lord jesus christ because i've got power i'm a witness he's raised he's raised from the dead in my heart praise god amen the day star has risen in my heart praise god i've had a resurrection christ has raised in me amen glory i just feel like preaching now but i'll stop here in just a moment thank you jesus now we learn a few things here church god honors people that are faithful six days no shouting had to be on time right had to obey all the directions oh we got to keep our order oh don't let the ram horns go before the soldiers with the swords no no no they got to go first every detail had to be captured and remember paul said we obey all the commandments by what love so it's not hard it's easy just love jesus yes if you love jesus you'll love his children it's actually easier for us because love fulfills all the law see everybody had to be in the right order everybody had to be quiet they had to follow all the directions and they just went around and around and around around until it was time to be done sir doesn't that remind you of the potter's wheel just around the potter had to shape them to see he was shaping patients in them he was pouring water on them and six days he was molding their character just trust god you can trust me right just obey all my commands and he's shaping israel as a vessel unto honor praise god amen round and around and around he's molding their character just do this week after week now for us month after month year after year i'm molding your character i'm shaping you into an invincible army oh that's glorious amen glorious god's hands are all over us praise god remember i showed you that scripture last week he said i'll never leave you or forsake you amen you've never left god's hands he's had you the whole time he's just holding you there in his hands you go routine week after week month after month year after year he's just molding you in shaping you just like israel around jericho praise god time after time after time this is how god shapes us can you pop up a few scriptures real quick proverbs 10 verse 4 he becometh poor that dealth with a slack hand now that's natural but also spiritual if you're lazy in the spiritual things you'll have a poor christian experience right because paul said we preach the unsearchable riches right so if you're lazy you'll be a spiritually poor person you won't enjoy all the blessings right joy and peace and healing prophecy all all the blessings of god that we enjoy but the hand of the diligent maketh rich see if we can like they were diligent every day every day god made them rich in testimonies right rich and saving souls praise god let's go and stand we're gonna let's stand and get ready musicians can come i'm gonna read one more scripture this is our that's my hour already proverbs 12 24 the hand of the diligent shall bear rule so who is god gonna let rule his kingdom the diligent christians not the lazy ones right i'm sorry 24-10 honey i'm sorry i'm sorry 12 24 i'm sorry 12 24. yeah not 10 24 i'm sorry 12 24. the hand of the diligent shall bear rule so was joshua diligent or not oh yeah he was up early he told everybody what the lord told him he said thus saith the lord this is what the lord said if we do this it's going to happen did they get what they asked for absolutely christ came down broke down those walls he broke down the walls praise god they come in they spoil the city and the people are victors the people have overcome the world what a beautiful testimony how many want to be overcomers in this life amen praise god god honors those that pay attention to the details of their life praise god those that are those that silently obey even now what i mean by silent is not complain that's what i mean right we should be silent when it comes to complaining right we should bear our burdens and not complain this is what they did they silently obeyed day after day god's going to bring the victory god's going to bring the victory he told me to do this he told me to go around and around this potter's wheel i'm just going to keep being shaped by him i'm going to get the victory he's forming something in my life praise god i better stop right there i'll have some more scriptures but i think i'll stop right there let's bow our heads here for a moment this is a beautiful message church this is a beautiful not because i preach it but because it's the word of god church we all want victory don't we to get the victory must have love that motivates our faith to do the works of god hallelujah let's pray together church think about your jericho what are you facing now that seems to be insurmountable i want you to believe with all your heart that god's gonna bring you the victory he didn't say when now in this case in jericho he did but with us he doesn't always say when we've got to be diligent we've got to keep all the word that we know by love love motivates our faith faith motivates our works we are saved by grace through faith let's pray together heavenly father lord we enjoy your word tonight thank
