together with the spoken word books about the Branham I have adopted your statement of faith I wrote a statement of faith on my website remember that we believe I wrote out all our doctrines major

[Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] like I said I'm trying to nail snot wear myself out you know after about two years of leading all the solemn service of preaching I think I could finally wear myself out to actually numerous times but I really gotta watch it else if I could have any strength for work and things like that but God knows you can just pray to God a race of a solemn leader you know it can be here every service by God because I'd really appreciate that but God wants me to do it I'll do it - I'm not going to complain I just kind of much myself for example like brother Graham when he preached the Thyatira Church age if you listen to that from 1960 he cuts it short because he says his voice and a little hoarse he said breeches last night because my voice is a little hoarse so for probably to do that I think pastor duty that is madam this God loves always - amen amen so that's just that take our Bibles that's what a Daniel chapter 7 I kind of heading them praying and preparing kind of felt we go back to the Daniel series tonight by God's grace so this is a message of prophecy I like Bible prophecy hey man why the Bible prophecy never even said it's the pastor's job to tell you what's in the Bible so that a five job show you what's in the Bible I love this do that because I love to see what go grab stuff and take you right back to the Word of God and show you how it lines up on the road okay so Daniel chapter 7 liquid the screen the first few verses the grace of the Lord Daniel 8 is a real unfamiliar one to me so I'll have to take a lot of studying pad for that one God's graces a lot of history on that you know anything about you know the goat with the horn everything like that there's a lot of symbols in there that I'm really not too familiar with so I got a little bit of studying to do on that I should say a lot of study the end of 7 remember Church we have what's called the state the Lord's brother branham in other words he's almost busted the Lord the fourth beast is rolled thus saith the Lord he told us to throw the mark of the beast let's take the Lord on watching the the curtains all these things like that so we don't understand a few little things well we do understand the most important thing right we do understand that so we're very thankful for that by His grace of mercy so Daniel chapter 7 let's just go to the verses one two and three let's just read those what I read verses wanted to myself and then we'll read three together in the first year of Belshazzar king of Babylon Daniel had dream and visions of his head upon his bed then he wrote the dream and told the some of the matters Daniel spake and said I saw in my vision by night and behold the four winds of the heaven strove upon the grapes eat let's read three together ready one two three and four great beasts came up from the scene diverse phenomena eight minutes our heads and I work Greg never you know artists make it on to God God give me anything have to be related to this message I could inspire us to preach something else Elleni father we love you tonight Oregon our hearts and minds are clear Lord we pray you've saying your song we worship You Lord God our courage is risen Lord God and I just pray you give us strength tonight lord give me strength to preaching and to feed on your word also the Saints that have faithfully press the route to the house of God bless these faithful Souls those faithfully live streaming dear God we appreciate every saint who hungers and thirsts after righteousness and put you first in all things dear God thank you for faithful Saints and father just regulus race to continue to faithfully certain bless this preaching that are gonna need your grace and mercy and help me Lord God to be a faithful witness what your prophet has taught us father who we know North God we are not to add to what the prophets that are take away those things there in the scripture so we thank you for your mercy embrace Jesus Christ name sure set in and out as you can see here please good maybe that's what the quotes and pictures you looking for so hopefully this works that's crazy okay Harvey praise the Lord amen okay let's look at this here so the tonight's service is called the vision of the four Great beasts we're look at that tonight Daniel series part seven are enjoined Daniel I just had a pastor out of nowhere text me today and said he said we're living in the days then you know he starts talking about Daniel things I just preached them then brother Brooks is preaching on Sunday to see how the Holy Spirit's really try to get us focus on these things I can't I can't orchestrate that didn't tell brother Brooks allows Regina tell this pastor you know it's actually better any size just let you know real fine minister I don't tell these brothers well I'm pretty I'm sure they're not watching my videos you know I'm just gonna they're not you know so see it's the Holy Spirit trying to get us this is my boys look past the man and just see the word tonight that will hear from Christ you know we got accept that and believe it there's a nice little picture that's the most humble picture I could find on these four beats up no one really knows what the last one looks like that's just somebody's idea code looks like a dead stop but that's just an artist's idea the first three are clearly describing the shadow so let's begin here and we'll look at this here Chapter seven here's a bit of background Scofield and other another sword said Chapter seven took place in 556 BC the first year of Belshazzar's reign so in other words this dream did it happen in the order of of the chapters it's the orders kind of mixed up not chronological order and that's in chapter 7 verse 1 the first year in doubt shoot up this means it was 18 years before chapter 5 because in chapter 5 there were the handwriting on the wall member that that was in uh that was in 5:30 something so if you do 18 years you know matter 5:38 so this actually the vision actually took place before chapter 5 and how we know that revelation everything is not in chronological order understand that some of it is some of it is why is that well Graham says to hide it from the eyes of the wise and prudent and reveal it unto babes I trying to learn a vet so the lies get figured out with you go on somebody but it takes God's prophet to give us the interpretation and we can understand it because we're faithful to God's Word now so it's 18 years before chapter 5 in which Belshazzar was killed and Ares need to go verb a bond remember that it took place 18 years before that remember when he did that that was the piece of hose that was the silver chest of silver right and arms would show that very night they went from the head of gold and the chest of silver but then straight in Chapter said his vision on she took place 18 years ago cutter okay and this took place like I said the first year was rate remember Belshazzar they say was either the grandson or son of Nebuchadnezzar it says son by the historians say was actually granting said I don't know yeah I'm out of the store I just try to study what they sit now let's go to verses 1 to 7 this is the mission of the four beasts now the Rd read verses 1 to 3 that's kind of the background and but verse 2 I'm going to read that Daniel speaks that I saw in my vision by night and behold the four winds of the sea strove upon the great seat I mean oh it winds on what man told us what winds are anybody know lavance is now winds in the bible 1954 haven't got time to run the scripture for you but we can go to this if it isn't answered correctly I'll get us on time the wind the for the winds in the Bible means Wars and strife now think about this like in jokes I remember the winds came down and took the sun's remember that and you want to mean is trouble so wars and winds means strike wars and trouble so that means these four winds bring about these four beasts or these four kingdoms and what did every Kingdom have Church a powerful army see how that works out the Babylonians how they are they cog how did Nebuchadnezzar conquer anybody knows Nebuchadnezzar come in to Jerusalem and destroy the temple anybody knows that he did it by force you did it by power right you did it by military strength so the winds represent a war strife or trouble through violence we can see that okay so that's verse two so he sees these big winds and it's wars - a Wars are stirring people up and verse three four great beasts came up from the sea diverse from one another all right now verse three there are four and a four is the same number of beasts as in the sections I'm sorry has sections in the image of Daniel chapter 2 verse 31 249 so that image has four parts right gold silver brass and then iron and clay right has four parts will notice there's four beasts as well can we see that so we'd have the same number for now beasts are government or world powers or kingdoms started go to verse 23 the three decks I can show that to you a beast represents a government power or a world power or earthly Kingdom Daniel 7:23 then thus he said the fourth beast shall be the fourth one Kingdom so beast equals a human government or Kingdom everybody say Amen to that all right you can see that so these beasts are governments or kingdoms that rule the world now the seas it comes up out of the season the Bible thousands what seas represent waters represent multitudes of peoples and nations and tongues I'm going to read that revelation 17 15 I'm just going to turn there about God's grace I didn't have time to get that scripture on there a lot of scriptures on here about to get a chance to get down there revelation 17 15 all right the Virgin's no it has a little chapter I'm in the wrong each other okay I was in 80 chapter 17 verse 15 I'm sorry a little bit nervous and you saved them to be the waters which thou sawest where the sitteth are people's and multitudes and nations and tongues how many like to understand the Bible of symbols I'd love to understand that number in 2016 I preached about I think I preached 13 sermons on the symbols in the book of Revelation so it's really giving us a good foundation as we get into the church ages and eventually the rest of the book of Revelation okay now I'm going to give you a picture so I think you'll like this by God's grace so burst 4 speaks of the line which is the head of gold the babylonians verse 5 is the bear with three I forgot what the ribs represent brother Graham said it and it's in the history I just forgot to look that up so I'm sorry about that I think it was three great conquests that the Medes and Persians did they conquered three other nations I think that's what it was when I was statement see how he bit them he's got the bones in his mouth he conquered up see that that's the Medes and Persians that's the chest and arms of silver where six is the leopard which is the ancient Greeks Alexander the Great was in there okay and that's the loin there the thighs of brass now verse seven is this iron teeth teeth two beasts okay so see this this guy had an idea it's kind of like a you're like a lion or something like Panther maybe the other guys I look like a dinosaur they're just weak Nevadan tells it just says it talks about the horns it talks about iron teeth that's all that's all the definition that it gives you so this represents the Romans of the legs and then the feet the Roman Kingdom is that how high God's grace I'm going to show you exactly what brother have said that this is exactly right each of these beasts represent the previous Kingdom that was already described in Daniel chapter 2 now remember now we're to go to the next one these four beasts all come into one piece in Revelation 13 let me know that I preached on that before so let me show you that program tells us that these four beasts combined into the one beast in Revelation 13 verses 1 to 10 so there's the picture now so we did a nice Photoshop job there on Adobe Photoshop but they put here's the bear there's the leopard here's the line of course and the last one is the ten holders yes if you count up the horns you know it's got a seven heads and ten horns somebody did a nice job on the Photoshop here now what does that mean I remember we're to get to and show you but that means the same demons that were in every one of these the same demons that were the Babylonians and Persians and Greeks are now in the Roman system that's what that means just so you know that's important to notice you're going to get a little bit confused it looks that dry behind there that's Satan right that's Satan and with that building there that's the Vatican see how that works at all it's connected in Revelation 13 and 17 and 12 it's all connected so I wanted to show you this shrunk down the pictures this is Daniel 2 so you know Daniel 7 and this is Revelation 13 it's all those all three are connected all right you're all three connecting just the same four kingdoms is the same four beasts or save save more phases of the times of the Gentiles now I just this is I hold the slides to when I preached this last year I just pulled a few of the slides so now this is a beast out of the sea and this is verses three to ten revelation 13 was it is the current papal Rome or the holy or unholy roman empire you know what I'm saying you know and this took place verses three to ten revelation 13 took place during the Pergamos Church age which that we've already preached up emphasis summer nafferton ones who are decreasing on this and I read chapter five quotes on that so here's another picture if you want another one you probably member this one okay the head it represents that lion the chest and arms represent the bear the thighs of brass the long expressed represent the leopard yeah that should be up there and then the Roman Empire of course has two parts and then it divided now it's got the Protestants members of the Protestants and Catholics down there so it's really got four divisions now here's the prophets revelation here's what I've said about how those four beasts came into one beast here's what he told here's what he taught this is from 1954 now we got two things under consideration watch this beast it had four different characters in it if you'll take Daniel 7 you who are marking it down Daniel 7 Daniel saw the same vision as John 800 years before Saul the vision he saw those beasts separate from one another in the beginning of the Gentile ruling and here they are John sees in revelation 13 at the end of the Gentile ruling all four the Beast presented in one piece them same old Devils amen demons that possess each kingdom of the Romans down through the Greeks and so forth now to the Gentile dispensation has come right now and all that up in one beast does that help you by God's grace amen I hope it helps you by the grace of the Lord now sort of verse eight actually know it let's read verses four five and six let's read verses four you've ever read those yet let's go back to Daniel 7 verse four then you'll be real familiar with it at least for a while unless you forget you know you just tend to forget things over the years but it's good to review it and good to understand it now because you never know and there might be a preacher sitting in here maybe now Cotter have you never know and they need to know the Word of God sisters need to know - I'm just saying if you want to know really deep you got to study it amen and you'll find Malachi right if they never go up to be preacher you'll find you'll remember it more after you teach it and that's true about our sisters you know they teach the younger sisters or you know teach their children anything like that whenever you teach something yourself you'll remember it a lot longer that's what the Bible says teach these things to faithful men so how do I know I don't have a another preacher sit down here that might win souls to the kingdom of God how do I know so what I got to do I got teach them thankfully the Word of God that's exactly right I'm not going to just say it's your mighty I'm showing you our program says about it that's that's our desire stay with the message okay Daniel 7 verse 4 now the first was like a lion now Lydia Malachi knew brother have you guys get ready to read it that'd be ok I'm a reverse for first for the first was like a lion and had eagle's wings I beheld - the wings that were plucked and it was lifted up from the earth and they stand upon the feet as a man and a man's heart was given to it now some people think that refers to Nebuchadnezzar's remember how he started off he was remember he started off as a man got the heart of a beast and then got the heart of a man again so many people think that's what it refers to I'm not sure that's what people think now who would like to read the verse 5 we would like to write adam and then now kind of 6 and Lydia 7 that ok thank you but and people with another piece a second Lake to the beer and raised up itself on one side and had three ribs in the mouth event between the teeth of it and they said thus unto it arise and devour much flesh thank you sir that's the scripture about the bear program tells us that is the meats of Persians so Babylon is the lion like with eagle winks bears needs a Persian and you know what let me just tell you is not just brother Branham says that means a person's almost every historian I've read says that they all agree on that remember program did say those those four kingdoms are the state of the Lord he said Rome will rule until the end time when the stone has kind of mounted smashes that image at the feet it doesn't have the head the chest or the god it's the feet if the Catholics and Protestants amen that's right judging them for their unfaithful doctrines and life of sin and rejection of God's Word that's right okay so now Kai can you get verse six the leopard please sir after this I beheld and lo another like a leopard which had upon the back of it four wings of a fowl the Beast also had four heads in the minion was given to it yeah I don't know the symbols here I don't know what the wings is headstand poor off the look that up I get a chance to look at them okay Lydia verse 7 firstly stressful terrible and started seeing me and had great iron teeth it devoured and brake in pieces stands the residue with the feet of it and it was diverse from all the beasts that were before in head and alright thank you okay so now we got the definition or we got just the the understanding of that now don't forget that fourth beast I know we talked about a lot but the chapter ends up by going and just focusing on the fourth beast if you ever read Daniel chapter 7 he kind of takes a break in the middle takes us a knife-throwing judgment and then he goes back and he teaches us more about that fourth beast why because we need it in this hour not just Oscars not just the judge Osmond who else also needs that teaching the Jews because they're the ones that really have to fight it will get the very beginning of it as they change the laws right but that does the calculus of Protestants will change the walls break a squeeze upon us close our doors stop us from frigid that's what brother granite taught us but that we won't have a war against the Beast but I'll tell you the Jews are going to have a war against this peace that's exactly right that's the scripture and we'll look at that tonight if you've got the time okay verse eight let's read that I'll reverse eight and then maybe I'll have some other maybe those people read with me again verse 18 I consider the horns now we're look at the horns of this fourth beast and behold there came up among them another little horn so this is like an eleventh horn it's like an eleventh horn it comes up now what are the horns again ten keys and that's in revelation 17 now I believe those ten Kings program said it are ten kind of communist accrual errs at the end time that gives them power to roam for one hour but then they hate her after the hour and then they destroy her it's really quite striking so these horns are future well thank you so you know from what I understand but up comes a little horn and we know that little hornets you might know the Antichrist it's the person Antichrist it's the Pope so let's look at this year now here's the slide I'm going to show it to you so I just zoomed it up remember he just has ten horns I don't see little horn coming up on this one less I missed it did I miss it somebody three four five okay I don't see a little more coming up okay so I was trying to get the pictures are here now brother ran up top the little horn was a hold let me show you the quote next I believe it will be on us I'm saying now this is me I believe it will be on a future false prophet for the person the Antichrist okay now go to Revelation 19 25 gotcha by was it relations 19 already this one - I'll probably get there first so I don't where I'm going so late at night - each one now look we got all these symbols here and the Beast was taken and with him the false prophet that wrought miracles before him which he deceived I'm sorry which he deceived them that had to receive the mark of the beast and then they worshipped His image and they were these both were cast alive into the lake of fire burning with brimstone all right never see that you have two separate things here you have a beast and you have a false prophet who's the false prophet that works hand-in-hand with the beast that performs miracles that has to be the Pope because it's one man it's one false prophet the Beast for the RAM says is the demonic spear of wrong so there is one demonic power by that not know how to explain this to you and I really don't explain to know myself but there's like a demon there's one powerful demon and he is like this he's the spirit of Rome okay I don't know because that's that's what the Beast is because the beast and the false prophet are cast alive and like a fire and I got closer I can show your mother and said anyone knows the Beast is wrong okay so it's like a it's a demonic spirit of Rome some demon net is powering Rome and what's wrong do whatever it divides and conquers right just like the Nicolaitans doctor right it's a demonic sphere divided the church in Concord see that's what Saint wants to do you divide you other church right divide away from fellowship with don't fellowship with the Saints and that's what he does that's his tactic always is to separate the sheep from the flock and then the wolves can get it that's always say always watch it we can put around the message what 10 15 years as always we see that people come in for a while and Satan would pull them out and devour their lives but we got to stand strong you got to stand together praise God we Widow by the grace of the Lord I just want to show you that skirts for that proves the Beast is separate from the false prophet the false prophet is the person of the Pope the Antichrist the person but also you know there's a hand high Christ spirit right because John BIRT John and first John says we know that our many Anti Christ come out into the world already let me know that you have to make your words make sense right enough to make them make sense now here's the quote from 1916 this is actually right after he preaches the seven churches it's like a few days after in fact I'm sorry it's the weekend after he preached it because he preached a whole week of the church changes and then he preached the bird ten virgins on for four thousand mark of the beast' native on their program said now he's reading uh Daniel 7 verse eight let me go back to her just to make sure I got that right he's actually reading the actual scripture they considered I consider four horns yeah that's right yeah actually universe a so you got your Bibles amazing now in parentheses here we have his words that he injects his thoughts that he injects his interpretations I considered the horns and behold there get up on them a little horn before whom there were three or four those are three of the first horns plucked up by the roots I prepared said now we know were wrong there now see so Graham tells us that four beasts is Rome and behold at this horn were eyes of a man now remember this horn did not receive a crown it was a cunning thing the other horns turned to beasts he said this was a cunning it was a man Pope instead of pagan you see so see it was a pagan Rome like Julius Caesar and all them guys it was papal Rome see that so this little horn it comes up you have ten horns and got a little video or it comes up this is the end Oh yet pursue the Antichrist and a Bible said you had a mouth speaking great things okay so you can already see that how do you feel better now about Daniel said you feel better I feel that better by God's grace so now I know those four great beasts are actually the same four Gentile kingdoms that Daniel saw in the image of Nebuchadnezzar's dream which program calls the times of the Gentiles these kingdoms will rule over Jerusalem rule over Israel and rule over the whole world until Christ returns at the Mount or the showdown there to fill the 144,000 with the Holy Ghost glory all right so verses 9 to 14 brother Ram thought this portion of Scripture was the white throne judgment okay now the white throne judgment comes after the rapture right after Armageddon it comes after the Millennium after the Battle of Gog and a god then comes the white throne judgment every with me I thought I'd throw judgment then you have the future home the New Jerusalem are you a man thank you Jesus is happy about that David can't wait to get out of this sin cursed world I can't wait to get a new body pretty sure I don't want that don't we don't want that right away but I want to live as long as God wants me to live when I can't wait to hang out at us sickness my battles temptation why is my flesh - Wow I don't let this silly I can't wake up I see him and be like him amen now if we can let's read 9 - 14 maybe I get some help here Daniel 7:9 - 14 oh no I forgot my one great question I have about the Bible I got a few questions my wanted great questions in here and I think I'll share it to you after we read this ok I don't honestly know the answer ok but I think I got a pretty good idea ok now first night we start with Adam and then go Malachi Lydia okay when he reversed night and now Piper said I behold till the thrones were cast out and the Ancient of Days did sit whose garment was white as though and here on his head of the lake appear what pool his throne was length a very clean and Willis is burning fire amen I remember that who's this Ancient of Days that's the Lord Jesus Christ right and here's the revelation got a catch here's Revelation God the Father has never been seen or never will be seen I mean know that he's you know he's an invisible spirit so this first I could not be the father suffer from the Sun this has to be the Sun has see the image of the Sun because no man can see the father and this is how I was confused for quite a few years on this one and some people told me this and some people told me that another but that's why you can't take someone else's work you got to pray and find out with from God himself aim ahead and I'm not saying that God bless the Lord about you believe I got a good understanding okay so we see Christ on his throne remember this first reminds us of Revelation chapter 1 remember the Sevenfold blood of his person he's got hair like wool eyes a fire feet of grass after that you got the breastplate I'm sorry he's got that it's got a vesture over his chest you know I forget that extra words there forgive me but this is found the same thing in Revelation chapter 1 okay now Malachi 10 liddie 11 Malcom ointment a fiery stream issued and came forth from before him ten thousand minutes ten thousand thousands ministered unto them in ten thousand times ten thousand stood before the judgment was set in the books were opened it stop right there so again this is the white throne judgment books are open program tells that clearly is this isn't it strange can't you see how you need the Holy Spirit to interpret the Bible because the verses 1 through 8 you're thinking okay for Gentile kingdoms fortune cookies and all of a sudden God like skips out of there he skips the rapture he skips the millennium and he skips the battle Magog Hill goes right to the white drum judgment see God loves to hide himself but the Bible said it's the honor kings to search out a matter a man he approves you're a king and a priest when you love to search out the Bible and understand what the Bible mean again that's exactly right but see if you just try to do this kind of actually with your own human understanding you get all mixed up that's we that's why we thank God for a problem now verse 11 Lydia may be held because of the voice of a great word I beheld even till the beast was slain and quite destroyed and given to the great okay thank you now did you remember that with that little army so this little heart has a voice right the Bible said the voice of the great words which the horn spake so the year there's these ten horns then there's this little gobbler and he's the one speaking now we'll see later the chapter he speaks great things against Almighty God that's exactly what 2nd Thessalonians chapter 2 says my this this is teaching the boy Brendan tied the whole Bible together same day it's his side all of those things are tied together we know where we are we're know where we stand and we know where we're going praise God exactly right enough to wonder about these things a prophet is told us now in verse 11 let me just put this in here because I'm not I'm not sure it seems like the beast that was slain on that that beast there might be used for the Antichrist I don't know or it might be that spirit of Rome I'm not sure but I know there's some there's some overlapping a little bit with the words that are used because I you know I'm just because the Bata the Bible says his body was destroyed and given to the burning flame now it could be the could be the Antichrist it could be the spear because remember the demon even the demons are cast alive into that internal fire so even the bodies of demons have to be destroyed which our spiritual bodies it's a little deep I understand than me too but just so you understand but let's just go to verse well okay Lydia Jordan Rita okay back to me verse 12 as concerning the rest of the beast they have their dominion taken away see that so that lion that leopard that bear they're done for it's this last one the one with iron the roll that's the one that keeps ruling right yet their lives were prolonged for a season in time how are the lives of those beasts preserved because they're in that final business the life of the first three beasts are in the last piece right okay now verse 13 now here it is here 13 or 14 is what's BB for quite a few years and here's why in verse 9 at red we're told that the ancient days looks like right we're told he's got white hair looks like it looks like a man right here's where stumble being here's I'll tell you what when somebody told me we're going to see one life into the son of man coming to stand before him and somebody told me that this one like the son of man was the bride I thought no no no sound right uh but here's what stumble meet the one like the Son of Man seems like Jesus the body of Jesus I'm talking about the physical about the physical body that was crucified okay but here's what stumble me if you have the Ancient of Days like white wool right here like white wool so you have an image of a man on a throne and then you have the body of Jesus that makes it look like two persons that's why it stumbled me but here's my thought here we just hear this before we get here spice up I don't know I'll tell you if there is two there that would stumble me a little bit I'm just saying I wouldn't doubt God it's not one person I always believe that but I just wouldn't what I'm saying is I wouldn't understand it I wouldn't know how to explain that to somebody I would never I would never think God's do people or three people I would never add to the word I just wouldn't know how to explain but here's what I think would happen when the Son of Man comes and stands for the Ancient of Days the Ancient of Days goes back to being maybe a pillar of fire or something like that because in verse 13 14 the Bible doesn't say that Ancient of Days has a body it just says the Son of Man comes to stand before the Ancient of Days is that make sense what if I get confused as long as I see like two bodies I see all the white winged one and I see the body of Jesus Christ man and it makes it look like two verses but I know it's not because the Bible never says these two persons so I'm just letting you know that you got the revelation somebody tell me after circles okay that's alright that's a lot to save I'm saying I just want to be honest I don't know everything and I don't have all the answers I know one one person that does and will understand it better bye-bye amen but just listen if a Trinitarian brings us to you that's what you say well I would say I don't know but I know the Bible never says these two or three persons simmer understand that so the trinitarian bothers to me I'd say I don't know I just know God's out three people all right now verse 13 and I saw the night visions and behold one like the Son of Man I didn't say this on a man it just had one liken of the Son of Man right came with the clouds of heaven remember he when he when he went to heaven member when he left on the the Great Commission number in mark 16 he was on a mountain and the Bible's that he left on a cloud so this is Jesus ascending to the heavenly throne and they came to the eight I'm sorry and came to the Ancient of Days and they brought him near before him so now you have a him coming before him Richard but he's not two people he's not three people what would it be it might be manifestations it might be more than one manifestation can God have more than one manifestations absolutely at Jesus baptism manifestations were the three there's a body manifestation a voice manifestation and a dove manifestation that don't mean he's free persons that just means he can reveal himself in three ways at the same time because he never said I did god I'm free purchase with worship yes Trinity the word Trinity isn't even in the Bible program I said thus saith the Lord that trade Trinitarian doctrine three persons of the devil he says he said we can't hold back on it any longer because the coming of the Lord is here so I put it on my video of the seven problems of the Trinity and they sure didn't like that one I'll be what in light of that my brother have said they're not going to help he said they're just sincerely wrong you believe three persons Isaiah if you swallow that pause doctrine Maxwell's mother false doctrines and I go to hell thank God we're out of that it's just a name Adam because remember what's the mark of the beast in the head it's believing the doctrine of the of the Antichrist and what is the folk belief of the Godhead three persons so see you can get saved and believe that but you can't be filled with the Holy Ghost and believe that it's impossible no matter the greatest revelation the first revelation is the freak deity of Jesus Christ hey that's right amen that's why we get baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ all right so can everybody see my my I stumble or my lack of Revelation I'll say like that that's why I understand you have one life into him coming to him so he's coming to him now I see like this the Sun is coming to the Father that's why I believe that white-winged one change his manifestation I just leave you what back to you to Pillar five and then you have the body of Christ coming to the throne and the Ancient of Days now has a new form that's just what I believe Jessie can you prove that the Bible no but I can't prove to people I can't prove to persons either because I don't believe that you understand what I'm saying though it could be it could be the body of Christ before the glorified body of Christ but that's the theophany right that's a theophany that's a glorified body of Christ so I'm just letting you know if you have grown Jesse what does that mean I said I don't know that's what I I just gave him ideas now verse 14 proves that this is Christ the Son of man was Christ and there was given him Dominion and glory and a kingdom that all people nations and languages should serve him his Dominion is an everlasting Dominion which shall not pass away and his kingdom that which shall not be destroyed let me just say something here actually when he comes up to the Ancient of Days this might be after he raptures the hundred forty-four thousand - so let me just clarify that I don't know this is actually when he uh resurrected the first time I don't know if it's when he could bring him back 144,000 because it makes it sound like he's gonna rule all nations at this point okay so I I don't know I just said I just be honest and say don't now let me um go through this kind of quick come back let me set a timer so don't go over to I just see I get caught up in preaching you know I get all happy and everything I get stimulated by the Word of God and I'm not forget what time of this thing burn myself out now Daniel scriptures okay so six times the church age book brother random references the annual scriptures I just want to show them to you because twice two of them are Daniel 7 what we just read and then he connects those to the white throne judgment I just want to show that to you here is the sixth Scripture now you can you go oh I'm sorry I should say good I could count hopefully I can count so I want to say hopefully that counting right Daniel 2 is reference twice Daniel 7 well we just read this reference three times and the Daniel 12 is reference 1 so that's 5 plus 1 to 6 so 6 times brother branham mentions the Book of Daniel in the church age book and three times he references this is the white throne judgment I just want to show that to you ok now here's the first reference he referenced Daniel 7 what we just read it in Revelation 1:14 how his hairs is why to smell it but I had to just read it and I already preset we will preach on Daniel chapter 7 chapter 1 see now he's company the judge of all the earth will be crowned with wisdom that is what the white and glistening hair signifies see this in Daniel 7 1940 we just read so revelation 114 shows what's happening it shows how Christ looks in Daniel 7 9 to 14 okay so there it is danger solid white hair he was the judge opening the books and judging on them Daniel saw him coming to the clouds that's example John saw they both saw him exactly the same they saw him judge and his judgment girl over shoulder that's where was the girl standing pure and holy full of wisdom fully qualified to judge the world in righteousness hallelujah number two is Daniel or as the times of the Gentiles Daniel 2 verses 31 to 45 okay so just so you know that's Daniel jump into a party priest at you are depreciated chapter 2 are you read that to you the third reference the vision of Daniel okay so this is again Daniel chapter 2 he's talking about the last part of image the last world power was in the feet okay so yeah that's Daniel 2 again so the second third reference for Daniel chapter 2 the fourth reference of the church age book is Daniel 12:1 now this is going to help us later on so good that's three bottles let's go there Daniel 12:1 program this is the hundred and forty four thousand so I read that for me but it would like to be that for me okay thank you sir then if you read trouble it's a rather long verse would thank you sir and at that time shall Michael stand up and the Great Prince which stand for the turn of the people and there shall be a time of trouble such as never was since there was a nation even to that same time and that time now people shall be delivered every one that shall be found written in the book a minute thank you sir so Brandon says Daniel 12:1 refers to those hundred forty four thousand being sealed during the sixth seal and the time of the great tribulation or Jacob's trouble praise God alright so go ahead just read about the Tribulation Period the angel 12:1 in fact all of Daniel 12 is the tribute as all the time after the rapture it's all the time every rapture you know time to go through it but we'll go through it eventually lift god Terry hour on Chapter seven we got five more chapters ago actually four hundred you okay v reference is in Revelation twenty eleven through fifteen let's read that let's go to Revelation 20:11 this is the great white throne judgment Lydia and help me out here relation 2011 hey Lydia can you read I might read eleven and twelve I already though the rest of us when I saw a great white throne and him that sat on it from whose face the earth and the heaven fled away and there was found no place for it I saw the death at great small and great stand before God and the books were opened and another book was opened which is the book of life and the dead were judged out of those things which are written in the books according to the group's amen keep a Jeanette will be standing there but Donald Trump Bron James beyond say this I mean if we're really holy most of all Christians will be on the throne and they'll be standing for him before us a man and their works he judged are the most of their lives right so see on the Wednesday night I don't feel bad coming in here because I'm letting my life be judged right now I go through my tribulation right now don't worry amen if God comes in their lifetime don't you go to the tribulation we won't have to because we're going through right now amen the trials the persecution the struggles the battles our spiritual battles at one day physical as far as at least pressure some type of squeeze or pressure don't reach in and you can't have Church here anymore all these things like that if God tears now I'm going to read thirteen at the sea gave up the Dead which were in it at the death and he'll were delivered up the Dead which were in them and they were judged every man according to their works and death and he'll were cast the lake of fire this is the second death and who suffered on rip the book of life was cast in the lake of fire brother who says that there will be both the righteous and the unrighteous in this judgment it says so these righteous will not be in the bride with a bride sits with him in the judge me see the bride is with him in the throne as she is to touch the world she has to be sitting in the judgment with him that is exactly what Daniel saw and read Daniel 7 we just read Davis said so revelation 20:11 2:15 and Daniel 7 9 to 10 is the same thing but heaven sea is the same scene for a thousand thousands who are ministry to him are the bride ha ha ha for who ministers a dozen but the white I'm tired hungry youth who helps me out my wife who rubs my feet when I'm tired my wife who washes my clothes my wife phase-in who ministers to me my wife says amen that's the fifth reference the last one is again this white throne judgment but rancid but once the tears are found the rapture can take place and does so at the same as sometime between the binding and revelation and cry so raptures right between you have the binding of the tears with their political move you have that first then the rapture and then you have the remember revelation Antichrist then Satan comes out as well fully in the Pope then we'll come today when all said together the white drove judgment I've seen an angel seven thank you the king will be there with his bride and in front of them will be the multitudes who are to be judged yes all are there all the books are opened a final disposition of all is made the harvest is in need over the books once often are closed Hillary Clinton be staying there Bill Clinton think about that night we must judge our lives now we must have the right works now we must pray fast now and there must be faithful to God now must do all we can now there'll be no chance to do with them amen it's all finished and rip we must live godly now amen I'm very happy to do that amen now I'm done with that I just wanted to show you the six times in the church age book when brother Branham references the Book of Daniel because remember the church age books are very prophetic an important book as many has numerous about states of origin like about the bride and different things now let's go back to Daniel 7 can we go back here I'm going to try to finish up here I got it up ten minutes here want to stop at 8:30 yeah then you're 7 and I'm not I'm not going to able to finish all of data sevens and I just wanted to do a little bit more so the next time I preach I'll probably finish Daniel 7 up for a few minutes and then go into Daniel 8 and work with because I didn't get enough time I just come right out right outside they had such a busy meet these last few weeks I told my wife in all honesty I said honey time is going so fast I just I feel like it's just falling through my fingers as soon as I sit down to study seem like it's time to get up and go to work you know but God is good and it's almost summer time praise God amen Daniel 7:15 I Daniel was reading to my spear in the midst of my body and the visions of my troubleman I came here into one of them that stood by and asked him the truth of all this so he told me of a we know the interpretation of things so Daniel said in my angels imagine this extended by angels and angels given the interpretation of his dream remember he was just in his bed for that but right now God you just lay in his bed also he has these visions he wakes up he says an angel there but show me the interpretation I talk about a spiritual life is amended now no remember the physical stress that spiritual visions and dreams have upon prophets and anybody anybody that has that Holy Ghost really moved through them through spiritual dreams and visions or even divine healing pepper the Bible said virtue it out of Jesus and he felt weak when the woman with the blood is your question anytime there's a real powerful move of God your body gets weak that's true verse 17 18 now look here's interpretation these four great I'm sorry these great beasts which are four are four kings which shall arise out here now we already know their kingdoms right so see the word King and King kings and kingdoms can be interchanged see you have to understand that okay verse 18 but the Saints of the Most High shall take the kingdom and possess the kingdom forever even forever and ever not good up here Church the Saints which are mentioned five times in this chapter are most likely the 144,000 Jews motorcycle it could be the bride it could be but it's most likely the Jews because that's who we see this whole thing is about most of the legitimate Jews and the Jews or a bride will overcome the fourth Beast now either way you're right this is 144,000 overcome them the Beast and so the bride but the bride will have the full won't have a full tribulation right I'll have no tribulation right I won't have to defeat the beast as like in a war because there we know where she won't show vote for the war the war will be for the tribulation period okay verse 19 then I would know the truth of the fourth beast which was diverse from all the others exceeding dreadful whose teeth were of iron and his nails of brass which devoured break in pieces and stamped the residue with his feet so see the fourth beast is revisited for the the Ford peace let's get that okay forgive me guys get nineteen okay no okay no okay its first nineteen okay I'm sorry first one I got confusing first twenty and of the ten horns that were in his head and of the other which came up and before whom three fell even of that warned that had eyes and a mouth mistake very great things whose look was more style than his fellows here's some interesting and I don't know all the symbols here but the little horns are ten Kings you can look that up in Revelation 1710 I'm not going to take the time to go there but trust is there if you go read that now this little horn is more stout now the Hebrew word means great so this little horn is Lord great or is it captain or chief than the other horns which is strange because the little horn okay and I could not find no brother random quotes on this scripture I looked up style I looked up more style you know I couldn't find any quotes on the side I'm just telling what it means but we can see how clearly the Antichrist is more powerful than everybody else right never you understand that we know that because he exalts himself above God he has all of Satan he's fully and Carter was saying just like Judas was right and Judas was a pre figure of the Antichrist cuz he sells him out for money always after money now verse 21 I'll read that and I got my comments up here I beheld and the same horn made war with the Saints that prevailed against them now stop right there that's why I don't believe Saints means the bride because what war does the bride have to go through her have said Christ keeps his bride from tribulation you see that now it might be a spiritual I could be wrong but I'm just saying to me it seems like a little horn the Pope Antichrist prevails in a war against the Saints right this seems to be the death of 144,000 or perhaps is the death of the two witnesses revelation 11 Praxis that verse 22 so look he prevailed until verse 22 on TLA see Antichrist will prevail until who comes create two days until the Ancient of Days came and judgment was given to the Saints the most high sea and the time came that the Saints possessed the kingdom all right so verse 22 I'm sorry I'm still 21 look I'm selling 24/7 of Revelation on these chapters and sections have referred to the Tribulation Period revelation 11 refers to a war that's the two witnesses that's not right chapter that's Israel chapter chapter 12 brother family literally said chapter 12 is not as nothing to the bride it's all Israel and you have Wars of safety in Chapter 12 now revelation 13 you do have a little bit of brown in there but verse 4 is not the bride and verse 7 is not the bride that is a papal Rome before the United States ok so that's before the United States times that's not the bread for from what I could see I could be wrong at 17 14 makes war that's once the seven horns are already up that's the tribulation that's not the bride and these two wars are Armageddon glory of the Lord so see how is safe and rebelled against the bride when there's nothing written that safety prevails against you and I hey Ben there's nothing ready say that's no scripture where he prevails against the bride but the bride overcomes why because she's washed at the blood of the enemy bed and the blood of Jesus Christ always overcome Satan itself I hate men because that was the blood the blood of Christ shed is what bruised the head of the serpent that right is the Bible said he bruised him on Calvary amen hallelujah so she's under the blood so her life has bruised the head of safety amen now verse 22 I just read it I'm trying to finish you I got four minutes the energy of days the Lord Jesus Christ comes he stops the prevailing Antichrist later the cost was prevailing get victories Christ oxen then judgment comes and then the Saints possessed the kingdom numbers 23 thus he said the four beasts shall be the fourth Kingdom upon the earth which shall be diverse from all kingdoms and shall devour the whole earth and shall tread it down and break it in pieces how many know Trump's going to the Vatican pretty soon let me know that he's going to Saudi Arabia first then he's going up to Rome no Israel then he's going to the Vatican this year I think it's next look look at that church you see how they're coming to a union see that that's revelation 13 United States and rolling must work it's that beast that roots fear of Rome working the United States and I'm always going to have another Trump or not I don't know if I'm just saying it's really looking close but if it's not close well praise God will serve the Lord but we see it has to move to that because it's the state the Lord it's the word of the Lord okay now verse 29 24 yeah what 24 and the ten horns out of this kingdom the Rome are ten Kings that shall rise now that's specifically quoted I already showed you in revelation 17 now finishing verse 24 and another shall rise after them and he shall be diverse from the first and he shall subdue three kings alright so the ten horns or ten Kings are mentioned again I'm not sure who this other king is it rises and subdues three kings it might be the Antichrist I don't know might be the Pope and because I could not find a brother and quote about this annuity of the three kings I'm not sure I don't know anyone knows - fine - please show it because I love to know so what I like to do is make all these serpents I'm preaching out in two videos for you to the people only seem to enjoy them all right now verse 25 and that's actually my last verse that I had yeah okay and he shall speak great words I'm who this I believe this is a little horn or the Antichrist he should speak great words against the most high and shall wear out the Saints of the Most High and think to change times and laws okay now we're getting into now we're getting to some other things here government's right and they shall be given into his hand until a time and times and dividing of time now the other that rises this looks like the Antichrist is this other King now is called a little horn speaks evil words against God wears out the Saints and changes times and laws now the phrase time times and half a time seems to refer to the last three and half years of Daniel 70 weeks in other words just saw the Tribulation Period okay there's my time so I hope there you need five movements the same phrase using Revelation chapter 12 14 so here's what the phrase means time times and half the time but time is a year because remember Nebuchadnezzar was had the heart of a beast for seven times you remember that seven times seven years so this Antichrist here is going to do this until the time times and half a times are fulfilled okay so just kind of if you like the Bible prophecy that help you out all right naughty I'm sorry I'm just I'm just happy I'm just happy I'm happy I know it by God's good I was raised in the church that all they do is speak in tongues that's all they did I didn't know that about the Bible and now we got the keys that unlock the body wait a minute I'm just happy journeys come in ha I wish one understand the Bible and now we can by God's days now I just understand it but half that simple or here's the quote 64 questions answers programs in Revelation as well has nothing to do with the crime Revelation chapter 12 does not pertain to the bride relation chapter 12 I have looked up but I know it is the woman standing in the Sun with the moon under feet the moon represent the law who only represented Israel the Church of the 12 stars in reported was the 12 apostles 12 churches and so forth which is past and see the Sun was at her head which you see the moon is a shout of the Sun which was the law was a shout good things to come and that woman is Israel not the bride now look for that really fast because I'm going to preach on that later we haven't reached out that later you have to worry about that tonight I just want to show you that revelations well that's nothing to do with the product that is all Israel and that's the chapter that has the time times and half a time that woman that woman Israel has to hide for a time she's fed a time times and half a time what is she fed by the two propagated manipulations the letter n are we fed by the former reign of god's prophet amen breathe the holy spirit word that God gave to brother brand that's what we're fed by today it's exactly right now let's say to our feet we're going close because I didn't get time to look up wearing out the Saints and changing of laws and - but I know there's quotes I just ran out of time it took me a lot of and no numerous times here all these pictures everything put together so you love the Lord tonight amen amen so god bless you next time we'll go through 25 26 27 28 I'll show you how it floats on those two motors folks I preached on Israel I think right before I did the boat got merit it was right before they left I preached on Israel Rome and the Vatican I think I preaches two sermons on I know I did use I listen to a recent but it's been a while I can't I don't have memorized I need to go back and look at those and that's that okay praise God so hope you're blessed by that tonight the visions of the great for peace now Church the longer I go on and the more I feel like the Bible is more sinful all the time you feel that way amen we just needed God to send the Prophet and now we feast on that now enjoy that by the grace of life okay let's sing a song your every need you can take a great request hopefully this works out good I'm starting to get the routine amen praising them as we close here does anybody have any special prayer that they need a prayer okay I just put a reminder let's pray for missionary work again let me just share a few things before we go um you know I wanted to make them make everybody aware of this if people are kind of feeling led to go into that mailing out invitations because I'm seeing such good results you know overseas people are seem like they're enjoying the videos but let me say this if someone wants to do a ministry like that for example you would design a postcard maybe you work with my wife my wife's a art major something like that maybe you could share the images back and forth or something and if somebody would want to be in charge of printing those out and then taking the post office but you know the church will fund that in other words we'll pay for all the postage pay for all the printing if somebody has a burden to a ministry it could be a sister or brother because it has nothing to 3t it's just getting out invitations to invite people to either visit our website or come right here at church in terms we can send them to every home in this area coats and every business as well praise God would that be awesome to have give everybody a chance in this area to hear the word of God now just let's pray about that before we go if anybody has a desire like maybe if you said recently well I really want to do something the Lord what now you can do something else you've already you're already doing something every is are doing something for the Lord no either serving your husband or loving your wife or serving the church supporting services praying for the services you know you're already doing something for the Lord but it's going to do a little more I just saw my hard to share that I think I could use a little help with that all right God's grace so just think about that okay would and also you like to make copies of our our might be our videos you know the teaching videos if you like to make copies of that and package them up and so we can distribute them or mail those out that'd be a ministry - I would really I could really appreciate some help with that by God's grace I have the summer off so I can really help somebody get started doing that and like for example the church to buy some computers we used to have printers I remember when both well private members would first ah the church John would have the printer and we print out CDs of the services and we make our own DVDs and stuff like that but we got rid of them because we just ran out of time and I just don't wanna do something else but now it seems like we can do that again and have another ministry there to at least invite people to church how many know where brother Brian say which country needs missionaries of who knows America phrase the others to go America now I know the Rebbe said you're not going to get many souls but if you can't if you and I can't go overseas at least we can do submission her look here now here's my thumb I thought would be to put something on the cars invite them you know to hear about the message on their website but also write them to a Sunday night service and we'll caught like a Bible revelation series you know if you want to come learn about the Bible but see church war if nobody comes we're already here for our four o'clock service and we never pulled them away from their home church if they already have a home church because that's what brother Branham did brother Branham wouldn't go into the city and he would never have service on Sunday morning it'd always be between services would be like Sunday at one o'clock or Sunday too you can hear them on tape it's on tape he never pulled people in the church so I never want to pull people away from a church and that way if you happen let's say we have a howitzers at 4:00 p.m. sometime that way we're already here it doesn't make us we're worn out more like doesn't wear me out more head we're already going to be here and if some straggler comes in and hears the word and can say well boy and if they get saved churches and your name and my name is wrapped around that soul for alternative program says we have a connection that person for all eternity so let's just pray about that and you pray about with me we've saved up some church money we got funds and if we have a missionary count it's just missionary money I think right now there's 700 dollars in it we could easily pump a lot more in there print out some tracks mailing out you know put something on there and try to be a missionary in the US the band said try it he said every Christian sort of should hunger to win a soul well if you don't feel comfortable going to witness the people they can weekly spider by mail so let's just let's just pray about that anybody I don't have any the prayer requests by God's grace it's not afraid about this week that's kind of what I've had a burden for you know then we can go that route by God's grace and try to invite the missionary to people here now in the u.s. try to be a Jew submission your work our own country by God's grace okay all right let's bow our heads here we'll just be dismissed on this prayer just bring with me and I'll pray you onto that Ben golden maybe pray about it as well before going to bed it can heal there by your bed or however you do it maybe crown the couch or something Heavenly Father nor we're thankful for tonight or tonight focusing on prophecy of Scripture Lord I remember the Bible said Daniel was sealed up into the end time thank you Lord and now your prophets come and the book is no longer sealed to us sure we don't know every single detail but the major symbols Lord God we have with us say the Lord because you send it to us Lord I want to take a moment and say thank you lord I do not take these things lightly I was raised in church I went to church every Sunday of my life for 21 years and I heard the message I was in church every Sunday and Lord I never understood the Bible so I want to stand here tonight and just raise my hand and say thank you but I can understand this worthiness our it means so much to us Lord God and to have the backing have the authority of thus saith the Holy Spirit we're thankful for that Lord God always be thankful for your prophet whatever worship Him will only worship you the Lord Jesus Christ o Lord we do want to take a moment say thank you for the prophecy that we know and love and help us for God to do some missionary work Lord God perhaps it would be helping out the next mission that might come through here maybe brother Jason again or brother vendor rod as he does Angeles to work overseas or some other brothers Lord God like rain Lord if a saint has it on their heart Lord to do something for you Lord I pray Lord you put a real burden on their heart they couldn't get away from it they'd have to do something for you Lord how great or have your way Lord in our church it's just one thought I felt led to go on Lord it doesn't have to be this way it could be another way but Lord when you said that about brother Perry Green all those Saints in MoMA your prophet said Lord that of whom the world is not worthy they gave up their own money to get hotels they gave up their own money for TV advertisement or we get our own money or God for mail advertisement to invite people to hear the message of the album oh what a blessing and Nord I trust and I hope that you would say the same thing about us of those whom the world is not worthy help us have a burden for the lost help us remember this country needs missionaries more than any other country created Lord Jesus may these words remain on our hearts Lord even last Wednesday night's sermon kept staying on my heart just couldn't get away from Michigan missionary work my heart mine just kind of coming
