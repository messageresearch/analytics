[Music] [Applause] my fate yeah the last day of work before it went I made sure I went to my favorite Mexican restaurant eat my chimichanga that was my favorite meal I drank a baby I think it might be my last supper here America I didn't know what's gonna happen I was absolutely terrified flying out all the way there by myself to meet someone I've never met before there and then of course to be there we want my faith hungry the Lord blessed a space dining another trip in two more months we're heading the end of September back for a lot more work tremendously blessed from working my view some of the slides we gots gracing me in here here thank you thank you Jesus let's let's go to Scripture by God's grace we've been drinking Matthew 13 thank you Jesus 13 verse 18 now this is the interpretation of the parable that Jesus gave other 7 parables so just know this thought King me and why God you 7 parables 7 you deal with the Gentile as far as completion the Gentile Church ages but notice this is the very first one the very first parable and Jesus Christ is not given in parable form alone but he gives the interpretation so this is the key to being a highly productive fruitful Christian amen verse 18 Matthew 13 verse 18 he here you either they're more the perilous or when any one heareth the word of the kingdom and understandeth it not then cometh the wicked one to Kent and catcheth away that which was sown in his heart this is he which received seed by the way side but he receives a seed into stony places the same is he that heareth the word and anon with joy received it yeah he had not root in himself but who were for a while for what tribulation and persecution arises because of the word by and by he is offended and he also that received seed among the thorns is he that heareth the word and the cares of this world and the deceitfulness of riches and choke the word and become unfruitful he become unfruitful but he either receive a seed in the good ground as he hears the word and understandeth it which also beareth fruit bringeth forth some a hundredfold some sixty praise Lord just my lips for God ignored this is your work what we just love you so much CC God Jesus Christ put this parable first and it shows what how to be hey that doesn't matter about anything else then what bringing forth fruit in your life still alive that all gonna be doing was sowing seed what we do this so see their spiritual farmers each one of us has we go into the world all we do is submit amen look what Jesus John 6 John 6 verse 63 and he's just got done screeching drink of my blood am I very very hard servant he never explained his parables this whole thing Harold he never explained any of it but look what he says here in John 6:63 he says it is the spirit that quickeneth so we need this spirit to quicken things right yeah we go that takes the spiritual clicking the body for rapture he says the flesh profiteth nothing the words that I speak unto you they are spirit and they are life see so notice what the words are spirit and those words are the spirit that quickeneth and he speaking these things to the Pharisees and Sadducees early on the chapter but because there was nothing to quicken with in them he spoke the truer of God yes the Spirit of God speaking the words which was speared and it had the power every word he spoke at powered acquitted that's right and he was speaking these things but because he was speaking to the wrong seed there was actually nothing for these words the words carry the spirit that spirit to quicken absolutely nothing sorry but it put the disciples were the exact same word the same word that carried that spirit of Bob with it and it was able to hold that hey I don't think I understand this how they said with a heart sank and Peter said where else can we go for holes the words of eternal life so anyhow as we continue all here we have good time and now what is what is I'm trying to find my position I'll say like this in the body John [Applause] grams administered others you know finding your place I'm trying to find my position as well maybe this is a path I'm trying to go down amen so I wanted to go through this is this is what we're called to do things as we get ourselves clean or keep our hearts clean in that see that words the plan of their hearts continues to grow and prosper and bring forth fruit where to go what what did Jesus say he says in Matthew 28:18 Jesus came has picked them all power is given to me in heaven and earth no he therefore and teach all nations baptizing them in the name of the Father Son Holy Ghost so we know that is what the Lord Jesus Christ to me a mad where Jesus Christ may be reading you something here now if he says also teaching them to observe all things whatsoever commanded you and lo I'm with you always even unto the end of the world Amen that's right you bet but he says he said we must go he therefore and teach all nations teach and then baptized yeah then in mark 16:15 he says he said I'm going throughout the world and preach the gospel to every creature and if he that believeth and is baptized shall be saved a mad absolute so that's what we did I had nothing else to do I don't know what else to do I'm going only by faith twenty some hour flight from the Lord said he's already been there and then or that area you want to do by I guess he was by airport it's lovely this very nice yes very big but also as we go here to second Corinthians 15 5:18 says and all things are of God who has reconciled us to himself by Jesus Christ see so once we been reconciled to Jesus Christ he says that he has given to us the Ministry of reconciliation now the movement back joint backs for Jesus Christ he says now we have a ministry as well yes what does your ministry is to get others reconciled back to crime yeah thanks God to wit that God was in Christ he says reconciling the world unto himself not imputing their trespasses unto them and hath committed unto us the word of reconciliation what are you used for the reconciliation the Word of God the same seed that same a Bible text that same quote or however you want to bring it we use that and bring people to reconcile them back to Jesus Christ because what they're lost just like we were for some of us pregnant fornicators alcoholics and abusers and all these things he says now that we are ambassadors for Christ as though God did beseech you by us we pray you in Christ's stead be ye reconciled to God a head so I was we jumped on the plane by God's grace we started Detroit flew to Boston sat there for a couple hours and we headed out to Dubai and I arrived late one night and he I had no idea what I was going into I have no idea what I'm even doing I just ain't God I have no idea what I was doing okay I just flew out there I find myself amongst a group of believers here this is sister diamond wonderful tie sister there she was actually the lives in the house that we're living she's Pentecostal to the core sister Helen old school Pentecostal I mean old school and brother James he's Pentecostal as well now here I find myself your sister Esther hold of messages and now she's interpret over 10 or 11 by herself and push them out by the help of a church in Canada and she actually just started printing two more out and Thailand this month buy your own money she's interpreting the word for Thailand's God's just working too slow and then of course there's me my face okay so I find myself here its own that it's a pretty nice house decent decent areas a gated community thank God I'm sure the Lord had mercy on me knowing I was just the Nuvi rookie so there's brother James like we said good brother he's from Taiwan had the pasta and then there's sister Helen she's very Pentecostal so the Lord set me up to fly right into what I use it was used to back when I was in denominating right right and all these women these Pentecostal women that I know or that I got to meet here they all want to meet one of the ministers or our ministers and they like controlling everything that spirit of domination is on on these things absolutely and then when we had a couple rough issues will tell you about them and of course sister diamond as soon as I got there they wanted me to pray for her she's actually going through a separation with her husband her son's looking there and since I left healing she's had to move out of the house and go somewhere else by God's grace so keep them in the prayer of another all these names obviously dying sister diamond sister Esther sister Helen these are all just their English names okay that's that's their real names I couldn't pronounce their names so they just pick names and that's what we call them and then of course I want brother Ron downs here by the grace of God he's the brother that three years ago he was praying and he said her voice said have you considered my bride in Thailand and he's from Philippines he doesn't know tightly in language he doesn't know anything about time they had to be like what so he married a woman a sister chromatid from Philippines they live in Canada you marry one and they went for a two-week vacation they stayed a week in the Philippines and then for some reason he just said let's go to Thailand they went for Thailand for one week and somehow he made one connection with somebody and then he's been there twice before the third time and you invited me and about four months ago I just pulled my pastor I said man I'd love to go full-time ministry whatever and do something more for goddess that'd be a lolicon and the very next day the very next day for the rod text me says you want to come Tizen opens right [Music] so I said I told him I said brother I'll pray and Lord show with me Thailand in two weeks I'll go the first week he showed me tiling in twice but I got had that third one and then it was another whole other week and then on that Friday he showed me tiling twice then did the met that night he texts me said did you get the fourth third one I said brother I got four I'm going with here we are we're in the market here right the first party here now this is the native food is called Duran absolutely fruit it's not the best well my tissue so anyhow here's a little message team here brother Ron Albanian sister that's Kurt he's a lawyer we brother odd and we'll be able to speak every service one time and she had to do it twice the interpreter so by God's grace and of course anyone that knows me you know the Lord is not going to send me to Thailand without living with the dog oh that's the house dog right there the representation and the Lord sent me there and every night I get home from preaching you're teaching me whatever what we did and they have a son would let them out and I play with at home amen now here's some of the things we counter here this is a form of bathroom waste thing you actually stand on these and then you squat down and do business and then you take that and you scoop and put water in there I didn't think God I walked in I didn't know what I was looking at and I walked out it even know what it was I think and it explained to me by God's grace no going into our first meeting the sister Esther she was in the school of prophets Pentecostal prophets back in her earlier years so she had connections to almost every island minister there wasn't she has connections everywhere and we were able to preach and message searches no I'm sorry I know there's only one message urgently and I'm going to it and their way out way out but we went to all these were Pentecostal churches and these ministers let us speak just awful curve of knowing her and her testimony not even knowing what we were reading so we had to be very wise on what we probably it be very smooth the wise and the servant but channel is a tough yes sir so brother rise up here now teaching for the first time I can't remember this pastor thing we brought a couple things and then we took a little break we went and ate lunch and then they hadn't even come back into psychics interest so there I am teaching site of service in this loop this little house here there's mostly pretty much almost no a/c and also your you don't wear any shoes and anything buildings but the roads the streets are so filthy take your shoes off before you enter anything that's just common courtesy however and now this time I wanted to bring something with a little bit of deeper meat a little bit more something else and I wanted to catch their attention you know well I don't I don't want these people to think that we're just coming here throwing sprays some kind of weird doctor I want to bring it so looks professional like we made in the Word of God you know we're talking about and I was able to bring about a year ago for the Jesse or two years ago Jesse came upon a sermon and he brought a big chart and he had showed the four types of believers before off forward all the way through show this is this all the way through and I was able to draw that little chart out and he was and there was a couple ministers a couple of sisters they were all taking pictures in that charter so I was able to get a hold of their mind you know I really draw lamb in so but at the end and we were able to hit Malachi 4 because we don't want to just hit a little something we want to actually be able to like see who's going to receive I did about transfiguration Bible study showed them to that and at the end one of the his ministers underneath him went up and disagreed and drew a chalk drew on the whiteboard and showed his his scriptures showing that John the Baptist fulfilled Malachi 4:5 well I asked for a remodel can I have your bottle and they said absolutely so I went there and I did part of the mouth Transfiguration again showing that John the Baptist said he says he said the Pharisees asked him he says are you that Elijah and John the Baptist said no I am NOT that property men yeah but even though they were disagreement everything ended well and then just good spirited everything's fine so a good time that's the pastor right there by God's grace and of course over there if you're not a pastor you're pretty much a nobody so they had to introduce me in cast aside and just do Bible say all they did it pretty much Saints the first prime three or four services I just did Bible studies but what what's the difference between a Bible study and a preaching it's the same word it's the same seed and it carries what the Saints you're am sorry but it all depends on what round is going on yes cause we're doing is rolling out see I'm adding simple absolutely yeah we are and this is the brother that had a issue with us they're in the back wonderful brother sweetheart disagreement now this is our second meeting here went into one another of Pentecostal area this is the second floor of their building sister diamond was leading songs and worship for us and one thing about the Pentecostal sings they worship and the name brick whenever we're not teaching or preaching mister we were going to the Pentecostal prayer readings and the Pentecostal worship services and then we offer ours they know they don't have the word like we have things and where were the words were that was put on the word all they have pretty much to tell us you they have seen any worship and they pray every time we were left we had to say a prayer every time we came in and we say a prayer whenever there was a little tiny something went wrong or somebody this was that we said a prayer and that's where I think the message is very very liking I'm liking myself is that everything must be done in prayer hey they meant so they were leading here now worship and then brother Ryan goes up and teaches first on sister Esther's interpreting by God's grace and then I went up and talked now remember I didn't I didn't know all these pictures I don't even know where being taken they were sent to me after I got home I was like look I can actually I went through we started teaching continually teaching by the Word of God and at the end they wanted prayer you prayed over everyone pretty much everyone favors create over one wheel to pray over but something happened which I didn't understand a sister had come up to me to dispute something about the Godhead and I was able to bring her to three or four or five scriptures I said you let me see what you had so I don't have anything like that I said well you believe the Word of God are your gonna believe your own ideas and she says well do the Word of God so but then afterwards now we're sitting there English speaking afterwards she went up and grabbed the microphone I remember we're in the Pentecostal ranks she grabbed the microphone and started speaking in Thai and it's pretty much what from what we found out from suppressor that she went up and said these brothers are teaching false doctrine don't believe but anything they said they're false and done it is out of the DA and then she had had another one sister take a picture of her while she's up front she posted on Facebook it made it look like she was actually organizing the whole meeting and that she was the one greeting them service so there's a lot of things that went on a lot of issues those things God we spread the seed a mentor of God a bet but everything what ended well there's no hard feelings whatever so now by the grace of God we continued on there was one or two very interested in what we had to say and when we go back we'll be able to make contact with them by God's grace again and then as we went down back to the first floor there's a husband and wife right here that we're walking by and sister Esther started moving to see to that and we real to testify while Jesus Christ them and here's two of the books each one of these books has three message sermons in it the sister Esther interpreted and for the ron's church up in Canada paid five thousand dollars to have like two or three thousand copies made and that's what Ron brought from Canada and we're able to pass out to everyone everyone that's said in these meetings that we went through that's one or two of those so they're worth our excuse so wherever the witness this husband in this fight and even so then directly after this service just the diamond wanted me to go pray for her mother so he went in drove a long way sir I came here for long well don't this and everything so the Hanley's are so tight the cars and there's mopeds and bicycles everywhere weaving and bobbing you justice it's pretty insane to drive in there it's almost like there's no laws so we be able afraid over this sister here by God's grace maybe no specifically taken then a day or two later or however was we went to our meeting and this was a house meet and a lot of these women like to be ministers or want to be ministers or want to hear more about the Word of God they're always trying to find something so we're able to witness to a lot of sisters here by God's grace and then we really hit baptism and if you see this is right here her her and I believe her we're so intrigued by the what we were teaching that you'll see in about three or four more services maybe two or three more services you'll see that they actually drove this is like below Bangkok and then about an hour below Bangkok we drove in another service about two hours north and they drove from there all the way there to here is a second time a bed so and this is John really interested in baptism and that her office her mom or cantilever Robert discours true but she came to another service we're able to teach there I had a lot of questions everybody out of course one prayer events we pray or each one and they went sister with really really short here and come up to me and she healed right below me where I was sitting if I see him she's like brother Simon when I go in the cause and pray I get no peace I know my answers I got in prayer and I looked at her and I said I you have to be honest you know this is my only I'll ever beat at this location probably this sister right here I just I said since you got Laker air girl I I said I said you hit you have to have that glory shining down and I gave him the scripture in first Corinthians 11 or however and it's just like oh okay I'll read it so you just have to hit you get one shot I mean I realize you know of course in life the same thing but here it seems like it's over I was more over emphasized in my heart right I was serious it was all business when you got their vote on whether on teaching didn't have any problems in this one but they were thoroughly blessed by what we're bringing by God's grace I'm very well to share the Word of God now obviously when we're doing interpretation I will speak and then I have to wait for sister Esther to bring the interpretation so if you have to be the most efficient with your words and and and that little pause in between really helps you out because you're thinking okay what is the very most important thing I have to study right here sorry the thing okay so I say it and then she's like what's this so it was really a lot more simpler for me have a slower guy I pray God was able to use it not believe he did so yes you'll see the results later on by the grace of God so then one of our days off we we went to their prayer and worship service here and saints of God the power guy came down hit me while we were singing they have this song I never heard it before I mean I was singing it and they had an English like it scene and it was just now sister Dimond are they to find out her parents are very very wealthy they owned a huge plot of land way out in the rice paddy fields area which is pretty much everywhere but you go out about two and a half maybe maybe I want to half drive and we got lost for about an hour because she hasn't been up there for so long and this is one of her family's houses and these are Buddhists here and they actually work her fields so but she felt led to bring us to her workers and we got to a whip they never even heard about Jesus Christ before and also sister diamonds family are straight Buddhists we went to the her temple in fact she's like the first one to come out as a Christian they have I'm something they have to have probably a 2 or 3 million dollar I mean American money Buddhist temple they drove us right through the whole complex and this temple is is out in the middle of nowhere and it is huge and then she actually has her Prada land and she's part of her land she's gonna set up a church right I stood moot his temple so there could be a pray for her she may have some Wars but the Buddhists are very docile they're not like Muslims kill you they'll just okay listen to you be done so sister Esther wanted me to give my testimony this family that's the wife the husband and son and I was able to where did I bring that I bring doctrine no I brought about how my grandpa prayed over my grandma and raised from the dead my mom had cancer and God raised her up and healed her the things that God has done in my life and that's what I shared them because it's the gospel not a word but an action but indeed they bet absolutely so we're able to do that and as is right before I gave my testimony I had set my phone down because I just taking pictures of the house I set it down and it started recording and my entire testimony that I'm giving them I actually recorded on accident even my wife he was her witness or whatever later on so there we all were sitting there with no shoes on just be Reverend testimony and the husband did not receive it the child the son did not receive it but the wife wanted prayers she's like I've never heard this before I'd like to you guys that pray over me and she had a little in her leg and and I was going to lay my hands on her one of the Pentecostal sisters runs up in the front of me and she starts praying and shaking her old-school Pentecostal style and does your little thing and then she's okay pastor Simon now you've been praised so she wanted to get hers in first see so you see the dominating female spirit right and that's what we're dealing with it the entire time just a little here a little there had some issues but so we prayed over the sister and we're able to give her the books translated books by God's grace to her and she seemed very happy so we're driving through town and we hit a restroom break so we all have pull it she pulled over and they just when they do you terms think a lot of traffic they do whatever they just do your job no matter what there's like six lane highway and one car will just do a u-turn and everything stops and they let him go there's no road rage no nothing it's interesting we stopped and we all went to this little Mandy's these are all like shops teacher like garages for their shops we went to the back of the bathroom and sister Esther is a witnessing machine she went and actually started witnessing this Buddhist man the owner of the shop and he asked prayer for his business because it's slow so we're able to pray for him we're able to witness about Jesus Christ gave him the message books and just we just sowed seed you know there's something greater we have Jesus Christ from masters you can be reconciled in Jesus Christ right now we're able to tell them that sister Diana missus restroom to Tran reporters and then we had two sister Esther wants us to meet as many pastors and ministers as we could over there so we had another meeting with two ministers right here's a pastor and there's no pastor to get with them and just fellowship make friends because you never know if you get invitation or not so we will do that by God's grace we made friends but we don't so then after that I believe we went to another prayer meeting and of course it's woman let the women are very in charge over there and seek you many men ministers the bigger names are men but the women just easily have we went to another meeting and the woman was leading and I said right next to this lady she's are here over here she said pastor Simon what do you want to pray for because we all went around in a request and then we just about an hour 45 minute prayer me just pray just pray these people are sincere they they want God they want more although they just don't know who he really is and they don't have the truth so but when I she said she asked you what if she we pray for and I said sister we need to pray for revelation more than anything else well directly across me from it was a young sister and she was looking at me and then we prayed in reports on their prayers and directly after the head lady left this sister right there in the pain she comes right up to me says pastor Simon what is discrimination you're talking about but she speaks very good English and I said sister what and as I started breaking down baptism I start breaking down a couple of mysteries and she was so bubbly and getting me just like oh she said wow this is amazing this is tremendous wow I wish I could have some more so we continue to teach her food of course half an hour show her things and she's like how can we meet again I think we said absolutely so about a day later maybe day and a half later we're able to meet up with you again at McDonald's and we did another miniature Bible study with your and she was just like I've never heard this before but of all those people that rumor is practical people that look prayer room all those people that was the one that seed hit right there and we just by the word revelation so brother ride was able to have a third follow-up and what brother on the side he was English air hair dress Godhead serpents and now she's gonna wear skirts and dresses and all those things sister - is there done and as soon as we get back I guarantee I'm gonna that's my number right they're going after that girl right there she's Winston to her boyfriend now and trying to beat him to get rebaptised and that was our first a little strike a gold little gold nugget bomber digging through people so so now set their diamond she was the one that drove us everywhere but as she's hearing our doctrine going forward she kind of shied away from us and she didn't want to drive us anymore but the Lord Jesus Christ has a she's always got a way for us so sister Esther had another buddy named sister job and this is the precious lady right here she is so she's so responsible she's such a good witness to God God and those things that the Benny Hinn ministry actually gave her one of their vehicles so me and brother Ron and suggester Babel drive around many his vehicles the rest of the means amen so she actually works for one of the outreaches on the he provided the vehicle so her name is sister Chuck and she's a very very sweet lady and as now she has a student our services that she's driving driving us around and she uh she's hearing these things and and we went for a long drive and as to the next meeting that what I'm going to show you a place at least and and she kept asking sister Esther asked for assignment about the hair why you guys do here and she's seeing a difference between sister essence and sister Helen the Dominator they bed and she says my father are women about the preach and this his dress would shoot a question back to me the back seat and I turned my Bible and I give it up towards this rest area and then she said well why what this is dress and I think I've I wanna turn that scripture and she actually believes what we teach now hey I don't know if she's fully understands it but she says I believe you guys were right hey we're able to be a lighter her as well as and saints of God actually will quit this this is Pastor TJ's we drove two hours on the middle of nowhere to go sister Esther had arranged the meeting here between us and this passion I don't have a picture of him he's a little guy like me very energetic I mean he's just like Palestinian just speak tremendous English but as soon as we walked into his church I could tell his wife didn't like us right off and he wouldn't let us preach so he drove all that way perhaps our no reason so we did the prayer meeting we did the worship service with them and everything and that was it so we had to find a place to stay and he drove us out of the middle of the jungles and this is the jungle area there's wild elephants out here there's all kinds of stuff we lived we stayed out and well can't see but there's little little buildings down this way and it's almost like a jungle or waste this is one of the most beautiful places I've ever seen in my entire life if you want to see a better picture I probably add one of my other so anyhow she was not arrested was not satisfied with us not getting to preach so she arranged a fellowship that night there at night after school resort place with pastor TJ and so we're getting there and he's very suspicious of us which pastor ought to write I respect that respect important that even my sister Astros brother Simon give him your testimony so I even my testimony and this and this and one of my last things the lord digitally last year was he raised up that man that fell from that the scaffolding he's his fracture fractured saw blood on his brain and God raised him up that day and then the next day as well and here brother TJ the same thing had happened to him he had slipped on ceramic because all the floors over there all tile ceramic to keep clean and easy to keep clean he slipped slipped fell hit his head and fractured her skull and blood on his brain and God raised him up and when I need my testimony that I had the same wonders and works as he did he said man if I'd have known that on a heading preach a lady but now we have a imitation amen when we get back to now we are allowed to go back and preach in the church so we've got so sister Esther was labeled by the leading and lower court that helped a bad God is faithful here I want to put a little attention on this next year thinks of God these are we went at nighttime two minutes here this is in the ghettos of the slum area of Thailand of Bangkok okay well this year's pastor Rashad sorry I'm sweet but this is throwing you near right there this is his something that's his son-in-law there's two brothers there that married his daughters okay I've got a costal we're able to teach there are on top first I taught second I taught on wall Transfiguration Mountain introduces the Prophet here's a brother this is another brother ASEAN's son lost bird arrives sweet brother this boy is a keeper I wish I could connect fittings a piece of cut up yeah it's funny anyhow and then we were able to beat this brother right here brother Edward John he is a messy believer from Pakistan his master that was under very coffee he had to exceed the Muslims so ruthless only they threatened to kill him where was that so his pastor fled and brother Edward John took over the ministry he was printing out message books this and this and the Muslims one day come to his house and said we're gonna we're gonna kill and rape your wife and daughter if you don't quit stop these bring these messages he fled to Thailand and now he's a he is a illegal I mean you're any illegal you cannot work you cannot eat and if you get picked up by the police without a valid visa you'll get thrown the IBC attempted in the detention centre international attention on the river and now you're a prisoner these brothers now we got to meet him and and he was praying for two years or for six months or a year or two months to do whatever was Wow they got it was send a Canadian because Canadians can sponsor people from overseas and bring them to Manetti watching legal in the US and here brother Ron is a convenient and they're just the church now just started getting him working on suits called sponsorship they're trying now to pull him out of there get him creaking that talk Kyle and either language so he keeps praying but I think I believe real cherish your support yet but they live in the south it's very probably because they they cannot be exposed to the police no brother Rashad and there's two son walls Feroz and be near their wonderful brothers this is going to be news wife and daughter these are in detention center in prison for being Christians right now so those are in there that's whether rashan's daughter they're in prison brother feroz's wife and son child are in prison as well and here's four more of their church family that are going through them so that church family there were eight people in prison for being Christians because they're from Pakistan they got thrown in there so keep them in prayer they they are in here texting me almost every day so brothers please I'm praying to get God can't release my my wife and my child there's two or three there's two or three there are children in there now it says here as the system s truth report thousands of Pakistani Christians are forced to flee Pakistan due to religious persecution death threats often for refusing to convert to Islam or accusation of blasphemy and offense which carried the death penalty and can mean and can mean the victim is lynched by a Muslim law group ma long before goes to court so maybe this is the real real issue he says so they flee to time in because it's easy cutting tourist visas visas to travel there on arrival they sued Liu soon learn there are no help for them as they are viewed as simply illegal immigrant refugee is not a term that Thailand recognizes Pakistan Christians are prevented from working to support their families as a result they were going hungry due to the language barrier and lack of - they're being turned away when they see metal medical attention and treatment for the children their suffering this is it is not a living just a mere resistance beat down by unbearable stress but is still preferable to lives of persecution in Pakistan so there is actually no hope good things if they're sent to the IEDC the detention center or cough or whatever it's $1,600 a us to freedom and it's only a two-year release and he says and because the Pakistan government is so weary of the huge number of refugees raids are carried out at dawn very late in the night doors kicked in leaving Christians terrified to venture outside for any reason fearful of further raids they asked their friends to padlock them into their small cramped living spaces from the outside to give the appearance of places on ID type a very dangerous choice for these slum like buildings where the high risk for the fire is high risk for fires higher but they feel they feel content compelled to make that decision so it's very very right now they're over 2 for you Pakistani Christians including women and children in the IDC in Thailand their daily ration through his small bottle rice and cucumber soup boiled cucumber in water there is not even a quarter what that is not even a quarter with the small children need in order to survive some everyday things of God if you pray tonight when you pray tonight remember it too then there are bonds as all the wisdoms and then we suffer adversity of being yourselves also in the body why because it's going to come here you better be sowing seed pray for them because dumb brothers right there prank boss to have jobs they pray they make videos on YouTube post them and try to get the message they do everything they can trying to please God pieces for whether one member suffer all the members suffer with it or one member be honoured all members rejoice with the things of God we are so blessed I got a first taste I told my Ron maybe first thing first thing when we get back I want to go to the prison where we can meet their family and there's a fence and your a lot of creaks through the fence so we took a church offering up from our church and be able to send them some money and they sent back pictures of all the food they thought they were going to bring to the jail because a lot to bring food to the jail for them but they have to be careful how you distribute because other prisoners will go crazy they'll even take the food or milk from the children when we're dealing with with Satan's Kingdom now the only the best way I see they get released from prayer I'm sorry from the Peter therefore was kept in prison but freer was made without ceasing of the church bunch of God and we know that's how the first prison break took place was it was a bet he said when they were concerned the thing he came to the house of Mary John who's seen her surname was mark where many were gathered together there praying still even after he was released know what that was a too depressing but it's something they wanted to share it was a very important my heart changed my entire outlook of things and then one of our last services we drove about two hours I wanted to bangle in smaller Tigers way out there and we met this little patch through the pond a year before this she had a God gave him was billion while he's awake and segovia pastors Allen Bentley your obedience at the minute he went to started his pastor and the pastor out here he's a very small church very very good brother very humble we arrived late because I think he got lost a little bit and we found out there was his birthday I said Nepal I said what if you don't reverted you get something nice to eat or something this that he's a brother he desires nothing he says but you so Saturday night brother rod went up and just hard and talking the bestie good and he said brothers come back increase tomorrow morning Sunday service so notice how they got that gold curtain I mean our old church and our church means have a burger teacher didn't miss coat oh yeah they got a curtain when did Sunday second service the bond was joined everything we're saying a lot of questions being asked so after Ron's first service each of lunch and there's a roast I'm going to do we want you through the next sir so it's like right after kubu boom right together so I taught on a certain subject afterwards and they said brother Simon's now explained everything we wanted to baptism we wanted to all these things so I had to go in and explain the difference between proximately goes baptism or Jesus Christ and the parish agrees 45 minutes to get the people with we're even even all day this does this hot it I mean we got eight people they wanted everyone wanted prayer of course create over everyone listening to God there was eight people willing to baptize in the name of Jesus Christ that were previously baptized pop song viewers that's all the difference these all won in the prayer baptizing now this lady right here this is my new grandmother Jesus he's like 80 some years old had 11 or 12 children well that lady right there in the green is the mother of this lady and then that lady is the mother of this so we had three generations of women and they all got baptized husband it is like when you get baptized name of Jesus Christ is the only man to have bad times Lord so we finally struck a main vein of the seat of God all we did we did was so see that meeting way back before she showed up her mom and then this other sister and she and up getting baptized immediately as a vet Wow he's Lord so everybody's excited happy they saw the new revelation after the and then we had to find a place for baptism well there was another resort a third world country resort okay which it looks pretty nice and uh so we're praying and sister sister JA our driver was calling him talking lady and she said nope you guys but I do have a pond you know whatever could be up there and brilliant upon says the drivers come here quick we started praying and brother and sister Jaya's kept talking and I'm praying and by the end of the prayer five minutes the ladies is okay you can baptize it they said 50 bucks I said I'll pay for everybody they said no you're not they each wanted to pay for each one themselves saints of God that's not a beggar mentality so we got to do the bachelor side brother get baptized he come up rejoicing by the grace of God everybody was excited they seemed like they understand and now they know they had the promise of the baptism of the Holy Ghost hey and they were very pleased all and the one man that was baptized we're walking out there also we're soaked we're all walking out and the man who was baptized sees another man sitting at the table and a table nearby and they know each other they actually didn't work with them hooked other and from what I could hear if you the interpretation is the this brother right here well this okay but other than externally but he's told the brother the baptizing was I didn't know you were a Christian these are Buddhists this man this man Buddhist and their two wives of Buddhist as well and we got to lead them to repentance in the name of Jesus Christ we let him through the sinner's prayer we've told him about baptism I mean the husband wife all hold their hands together and pray that [Applause] [Music] went really well everybody's praying believing God and we stumbled their real reverent so we're going to lead them the Buddhist to repentance they want to accept Jesus Christ as our Savior I kept telling us he goes I don't want to go to hell because I don't want to go to hell visas and I don't want my wife to go to hell I don't my mother years ago though so he was actually pretty much all put them all on the spot [Music] Center about that was jumping back to River now these pictures I didn't even know any these are taken so last night receive these a meditation [Music] [Music] there you go you're good you're able to witness them Buddhist then their wives and they had children swimming in the pool as well because they're just they're entertaining of children who's able to get in there he was one of the cut-up kind of guys like me but I got an else over with them we got right in his face is that this can't be a joke and he's he's so look just like right now I'll look right and what kind of military on so you went down the name Jesus Christ his wife went down buried they know Jesus Christ as well bed the other buddies other body tattooed up he went down and they were Jews Christ absolutely wonderful and then his wife went down as well and as we got done with these four Buddhist converts to other ladies where they're watching by the pool and they said wow we're Christians too but we've never been baptized so they want to get baptized in the name of Jesus Christ we explained it to them as well so since I got in one day we had 14 baptisms hey Matt are you just out with thing and the Lord really bless we will to lead them off by the grace of going into this explain it to him they were all baptized and I just put this in here because all Philip did was that you just baptize them that was it that's right a bad didn't teach him anything else more to do this this he just went gonna baptize babies Christ because what not was promised now the rest of the workers on Jesus Christ amen yes now what's the strange thing to happen now is that that old grandma lady and her daughter and then her daughter it turns out that she's a doctor that's her daughter oh that's rude or she's a doctor that's her husband right next door and that's their granddaughter there they're a doctor she's a doctor I don't know he does but they live in a mansion they were so impressed by our teachings and blessed by the baptisms and they seen the movie hand of God move they invited us to come to their house and they there their house their living room is bigger than this building and it's about 12 12 15 feet up so we were able to witness them the husband was not able to come to meetings but he said he wanted to be baptized just to give you an idea that's their living room but they invite us over as when agreement they write us over because they want us to pray they're so wealthy they've built their own prayer building and their house is a mansion and you go down the steps on the side of our house there you go or Oh sidewalk then you go up the steps and there's their prayer building and their prayer green building is absolutely huge as well it's probably the building is quite half the size of this building with huge vaulted ceilings and everything I have a video of it actually that's the video of it goes down nominal so I won't pray so that was pretty much that was what we did by the grace of God the very last day they took us out and literally assumed your children pick up little things we left to faithful warriors behind sister Esther sister job fighting it out in the devil's Kingdom now Thailand is 99% Buddhist and there's less than 1% Christian so the fields are white for harvest right absolutely right and right now by playing those things that I'm gonna go as much as I can we're gonna just press on like that there's another brother that's no message that comes in swinging by the one that one sister Esther and he was able already to do a follow-up study with all all of our probably 10 or 12 people that believe this word so far sister Esther took pictures and they're all they're already feeding off the message again the Bible says what some some plant others water but they're just absolutely so it feels good to actually get out and do something weird actually trying to do something for the Lord and just put yourself in harm's way and in the way yes there's Chris right there I have explained in the pulse water but God gave you three so he did so then neither is he that planteth anything neither he the water but God that giveth the increase need the planet leave the water so thanks God I hope you keep this this ministry Italian in prayer please always keep them in the people in prison and prayer it's I'm sure it's rough for them we're leaving their polling right now to send $1,600 per version of their family which is eat eat time is hard but [Music] it's just me well they just mean I don't know what to do actually it's it really seemed like a hopeless situation of things outside things Jesus Christ all things change the government's policies anyhow this power has posed a blessing Saint said your honey father Lord Jesus we used up in order to think it over for this day God we hope here of the presented Lord just the way you allowed us to articulate would've ignored be a part you know there's so much going on or just we pray for those Pakistanis the ones that are the prison right now philia shines and daughter-in-laws veneers wife and child feroz's wife and child gown will please me with them door god yes or give them the Hope Road in order made the sir presence of God neither in episode means protecting God Lord head of your hand over the watchful and all power God always before God this norteña so do whatever you need new collagen so it's a freedom God or treating ordered when you set the captives free yeah that was really more when you came as descended yeah going once again your children or cushy life so later to see my house is here God ambassadors use Christ right here thank you God hope was a blessing yes but for me it just showed it a little Sunday School teachers can go and fly over that seems a God got you last before Dean back and I am I know it seems a God of feeling pushing your heart attack all to do anything the ministry just go because of God absolutely the fivefold ministry is just sowing the seed but Saints God each one of us has a ministry individually I only as souls that we want and witnessed to me them push harder than ever had right there's [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] nothing more important in winning souls there's [Music] something for us to do well there's a price to do what we can do right now is pray we can pray for the future trip opposed to make here we can pray for the families that have relatives in prison obvious things like I said we can't relate to that we can't relate to having a wife and a child in prison the kid was can't wait we can pray they can enter no burden seekers 13 said that we can adjourn and try to feel for them and then from here we can do something about the grace of trying to help them out perhaps the thing to offering or something like that it definitely want to help support mother Simon I don't want to help support the other side to make an impact you know I think it's so often in America we just get focused on ourselves when we have a presentation like this for able to see that we should be interested in other people should get our eyes off ourselves and say our problem very very small we have very small problems compared to these people overseas so I like

we can stand within the prayer we [Music] are also blessed to live here but we're more blessed to know Jesus Christ and we're so blessed Lord to be able to hear these words today Lord no doubt today
