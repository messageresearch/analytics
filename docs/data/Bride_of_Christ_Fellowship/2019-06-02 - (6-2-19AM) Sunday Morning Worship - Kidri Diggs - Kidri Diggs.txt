[Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] God's own son will be okay so we'll get there because God is leaving amen you know it's nothing that we are doing on our own it's all the grace of God you know and it's always a pleasure coming this way seeing all of you and pastor Smith we certainly appreciate him you know um you know they always talk about um big things but some of the most powerful meetings could be small gatherings because God he can do personal things you know so I chair it I cherish these moments you know and by God's grace we traveled all over the world but he's still the same God you know so we take and praise Him and we just covered your prayers and let's just have a word of Prayer and we'll get into the Word of God today that's pray Lord Jesus father here we are today and we know that we're here on the merits of your grace Lord there's nothing that we have done and Lord though we don't deserve your grace father you predestinated it unto us before the foundation of the world Lord you give your life for creation that was falling in sin the Lord you you came as Redeemer and you redeemed us Lord and you placed us on the solid foundation of who you are Lord and you are mercy you are grace you are peace you are love nor then we are now possessing all of those benefits that you've given us Lord Lord and we pray that you just bless this church today Lord and it's an every person that I hear at the sound of our voice or God that you would just move in the lives of your people Lord and encourage us Lord and whatever way we need and Lord will be careful to give you all the honor and glory and praise Lord we pray that you the supernatural God will become in this place today in Jesus Christ's name let the church say Amen hey man if you have your Bibles let's turn to the Book of Numbers the 14th chapter numbers 14 amen praise God numbers 14 and let's start reading at verse 26 if you have a saved man the Bible says and the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron saying how long shall I bear with this evil congregation which number against me I have heard the murmuring of the children of Israel which they mumble against me say unto them as truly as I live saith the LORD as you have spoken in my ears so will I do to you ma let's go to Psalms 19 look of Psalms chapter 19 a man let's um let's start reading at verse this is reverse um 14 Psalms 19 and 14 the Bible says let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart be acceptable in thy sight O Lord my strength and my Redeemer amen the Lord bless the reading of his word you can have your seats before I give you my title one thing I want to make clear today is that when it comes to God nothing is done by coincidence there is no such a thing as coincidence when it comes to God because God is all-knowing he's all see you know he's all-powerful so with God just he just doesn't happen to stumble upon something you know he doesn't work like that you know he has a purpose and everything he does and he knows you know the outcome the beginning and the end of everything about us so I want to say today that if you're here in the sound of my voice is not a coincidence that God preordained this meeting amongst us in this building before there was ever a world created now we have to believe God like that that he's a he's not just a a a a a a God that we can put in our finite mind but he's infinite you know he's all-powerful and his ways are to be understood or figured out by us through His grace and we'll never understand God without his help so what I'm saying today before I go forward is that I want you to get something out of the service you know don't just say well you may have had a thought well I feel like going to church today let me tell you something dad didn't come from the devil the devil didn't say oh why don't you go to church and hear the word of God this is not a question it's God who put that salt and that push in your life to put you in this place today this is not a coincidence Amen I'm not here by coincidence you're not here by coincidence but there's a purpose so I want you to say today as you're hearing the Word of God I want you to say Lord I want my portion I want that part of the word has been ordained from my life to take your man you know church today might my subject is the visitation of the spoken word amen now as we look in the Bible and as I read in the Book of Numbers you know God he began to deal with the children of Israel now for him to get to this place you know God has told Abraham he said that I'm a bless your seed I'm a blessed you know he's gonna be above the stars and his hands and so forth and I'm gonna put you in the promised land that was God's promise he spoke that unto Abraham now if God ever speak something he has to back it up he has to fulfill it God is not an Indian giver he can't say something one day and they say oh I didn't mean to say that i'ma change my mind and he could do that he couldn't be God he had to be like one of us you don't have to be a maturing of the mind God that God doesn't have to mature him at hand hariya he's perfect in all his ways dot doesn't have to grow hallelujah she's perfect in all his ways so you know Church when I when I when I look at this you know the children of Israel God made a promise to Abraham and he even told him that your sea was gonna come into some bondage but he he gave them a specific time that you'll deliver why because he spoke that word so that word had to come to pass hey man so God allowed the children of Israel to be in bondage and God did not come to respond to the people and today x4 let me tell you something if you want a visitation from God you got to speaking see God will only visit you by the power of the spoken word you know but I also want to talk about meditation the scripture reread that the words of my mouth the meditation in my heart be accepted in thy sight because what's in your heart can become action the Bible says out of the abundance of the heart does the mouth speak so what you're meditating on and what is speaking work hand in hand so I want to look at this you know choose of Israel you had a Bible says you didn't God came and he heard that cry hey man the children of Israel in bondage and God heard they cry and Gaza okay I have come down early he come down to deliver the people God says I'm coming to visit you but I'm going to visit you hungry yeah he Moses hallelujah amen God came down but he was veiled in Moses so a lot of Taiwan to say something to you now not lift me up but God could be visiting you this morning but using a different vessel Korea so church we can't get caught up in flesh we can't get caught in one another God does things holy that mind can't comprehend then a people actual visitation but I took a man of this very old what are they very own kind and God was gonna bring for the visitation them by the spoken word now they cried and he cried and he cried for the river and God came down through Moses to deliver and we know the story to make the story short God did my signs and wonders you know he he turned water into blood he he that fire come from heaven you know he do the spoken word of Moses mouth you know Psalms were created lifes were created you know Allah's creation came for what was it it was a visitation honey God was giving the people a visitation based upon what they act for they act for deliverance so Moses Oh hallelujah Moses didn't come down with healing ministry hallelujah why did he come for healing ministry because the visitation was based upon what the acts for the visitation was acts for God bring us delivers so Moses had to come through with a visitation of deliverance they expect deliverance so how are you and God visited he visited with a Ministry of deliverance not a Ministry of healing so Moses came down delivering the people with signs and wonders why did he say okay who have a prayer line all of that was included that God do his part you act and God will God will visit you according to what you explore the very words that comes out of your mouth but it has to be spoken word now when I say spoken word the word that God would have spoken himself God's not going to visit hurry up um carnality or or or or like like lady told Paul um they said not Barmes beliefs a you've gotten caught up in folly see fool God's not gonna visit who's hola send me a million dollars are you talking about that counselor we're talking about the word that God has already ordained for your life that's what God will visit hi oh yeah and you know Church if you look at how God came through he didn't come through like a John the Baptist at that time you know preach and repent no this visitation was based upon what they spoke and this visitation was deliverance so Moses didn't come down baptizing people no he came down with signs and wonders of deliverance that was the visitation courier that was the visitation what the people ask for in their day now we're going somewhere church we're coming up to something so you can see Moses came down with all this all this power he won't write up the Pharaoh say let my people go didn't have an army you have no weapons all he had was a stick what was this the only be needed for deliverance so God a crook the ministry with all it needed to give the people when they need for their visitation so God Moses comes down and and you know he wants to fail we know that Sarah had armies serento Kingdom but Moses was protected hallelujah he's protected why was he protected because God sent Moses God was in Mose honey this wasn't Malta doing it was it was God's doing God came down to visit the people according to what they say and the Bible says the people cried and cried for deliverance and God said he remembers his promise hallelujah well he said unto Abraham honey so God came down hariya to fulfill whether people needed but in the midst of all that deliverance they discarded that like I say it all the wonders and all these things but then the people begin to complain the worst thing you can do is let the wrong thing come out of your mouth words are that allows a parent you don't tell your children that they sorry there never be anything you just like your dad you just like your mama all this negative stuff no because words have power and those words will visit their spirit oh yeah so you have to build them up you have to tell them that you can be great early you know I I see my I give my daughter messages before you go to sue I say hey do great things today because you are great so somebody can come now you never be nice she say yes I will my daddy tell me all the time I'm great so those words how you continuously visit her in the time of need oh yeah so that's why you have to speak hurry up positive things all your life honey don't never wake up in the morning and say oh I'm just stupid I don't know what I do those words will create atmospheres around your life you know that's one thing I hate you know when somebody needs deliverance or say somebody who's who's who who's caught in some kind of diction maybe alcohol or drugs and you go to these anonymous centers in the first thing and what you do is come fast something that you're not the only way you can be an alcoholic if you confession simply that gives the devil power over you because the worse you're gonna be visited by spirits based upon the access that you've given them hurry cuz the devil can't do nothing to you but what God allows hurry up if you say Oh on the holiday the spirit of a closed alcoholism has a right path to you because you have invited in that's why the Bible says then the weak say I am strong it never says the Bible never says head too weak and weak it never she chokes we got the caster's like dissertation otherwise we speak the Bible never said that the lost Sam lo he says let the word of God oh you visit you why won't you speak Amen it never says let the bowels ambough he says that the bounce what are you speaking out of your mouth because the words that you speak out of your mouth will visit you host you know I feel the Holy Spirit moving in here but you know church as we look at these different things you know I just want to progress on up to where I want to get you know as God brought forth the Ministry of deliverance what they spoke there in this visitation holy God is visiting his people and he's in Moses directing him so much to God gave him a privilege cloud by day and a pillar of fire by night honey Moses lightning that cloud Moses went in that fire that visitation was all gone such as God was syndicating to his people that he was with them but because of their salts in their then that the meditation of the heart being trapped in Egypt so long they couldn't recognize the visitation they look Moses may begin to criticize they begin to say oh you ain't gonna hold it hold Moses we hungry Church let me say this in my time right now if God was to come do some supernatural things in my life the last thing I'd be taking be thinking about is what this flesh for a stay on my mind see coca-cola Pepsi create I think if God was to come and give me a supernatural visitation that I could not explain my god how do you supernaturally brought forth deliveries and they're there they're moving towards the delivers in the visitation of God by what they spoke hurry they spoke deliverance God gave them deliverance then they start speaking damnation in damnation began to be created so now they begin to say we're hungry Moses because there were no graves out here you know you brought us out here to die we had melons and cucumbers and all these things in Egypt so now there's going to be visited by famine there being visited by famine because of what they spoke they're going to be visited my first because of what they spoke researched it we just we that but one thing I want you to say I want you to understand you will never bring God to a common level in God's face is God ever started delivering holy place upon the spoken word he'll stay there to finish it well sometimes your journey can be prolonged by what's coming out of your mouth a lot we only we got a nanny so God you gotta stop the whole church just to feed some title people hurry when they will see a journey a journey me to tell me they couldn't pay in the visitation of God and they flesh is getting in the way now they come are they hungry so Gaga stopped whole church and feed people though he fed him the visitation was still supernatural hey once God start to visit you from that point so he finished everything will be a man look at a church he got hungry God ain't told you just a windy garden tell him go to the field and big grain no his visitation was supernatural how do you so you know what he did they got hungry because the visitation had already started gosh I gotta feed my people I'm already here so I gotta continue to be God holy he said they were hungry so you know what imma give them manna from heaven Church even though we complain gonna still visit us supernatural Hurley but I just want you know sometimes a journey will be held up by what's coming out of your mouth or by the meditation in your heart see what was holding him up even in that moment it wasn't where they were speaking it was where they were thinking claim launching they're going down they're thinking in the heart me with that plenty of food in Egypt we had plenty listen Egypt heroes for the words in a in a in a heart the meditation in a heart beginning a short journey and yeah I said God came down and gave them bread for Hannah from from Gaeta manna from heaven how are you let me tell you something this matter was already cooked and God ever stop to visit you man will never get any credit it'll all be the supernatural visitation hurry Oh God so now Church he stops the whole church just to continue to visit them with Great God gives him with and then he tells me say hey so don't pack none of this up amen don't nobody take none of this 10:18 don't do nothing cuz you know why God told him that because God want us to realize if he visit you once he can do it again we gotta give awesome testimony from 10 years ago he's still God today he hears you then healed you now Church I'm here as a witness a man 10 years ago they tried they try to tell me how diabetes and I said no no no I what you see is sweet tea from Wendy's he said police how can you speak like that because that spoken word had already visited me it visited me hallelujah some years prior when I told the enemy by stripes I'm here let visitation that visitation of healing it doesn't leave you it follows you wherever you go you just have to speak it by the spoken word you bring it back by what you speak oh yeah he bring the manifestation to your life by what comes out of your mouth you say you you and hearing closed that healing will follow you to read great so you know Church they say yeah I better not don't I say sweetie I said no no mr. Diggs I'm sorry sweetie don't move I see you say what you want to say sweetie and I want you to understand something I had all the symptoms of having it having diabetes but the words that came out of my mouth the meditation that was in my heart it was acceptable in his sight so God said as surely as now spoken so shall be you know what I walked out of it without diabetes after they did a test after they did a screening why did he come back negative because I spoke visitation like myself my stripes on he he still the same God so once that word oh my church listen the Bible says Isaiah things Isaiah 55 the Bible says yes how's everything from the Bible says and then the word marici identify verse 11 says so shall my word be that goes forth out of my mouth it shall not return unto me wrong Haley listen to that church if you speak the spoken word that word cannot return to God why he says but oh yeah it shall accomplish that which I please and it shall prosper in the scene wherein I sent it so I say God is a healer that word can't come back unless it does what it's supposed to do you say God is a savior that word take him back it's a God fulfilled in your life and he's the same you change the provider that one can't come back to God provides it has to accomplish what it lets hey why because it's God's Word he can't just change it once it goes out of your mouth once you say Lord you are you are a provider he's going out the word is going out well maybe your situation it looks real tough their word them go out and say oh that's too tough for me I'm going back no the Word of God doesn't do that the Word of God goes right to the very area you need you have needle and it goes there and that word wrasses on that situation then it breaks that situation up and it starts to do whatever you spoke calling you know I want y'all to pray for me I'm feeling real good for the past two weeks I was in um I was in Quebec Quebec Canada Italy weather crazy you know and I got hoarse like this thing and you know I started losing my voice and it happened after i apprec-- the message on worship i preached a message on worship at at our church back home and carolina it was like after I preached that message it's like the enemy started attacking me sound attacking my voice I've been preaching hard and screaming for over 20 years huh so why now why now is the enemy trying to steal my voice earlier but I want you to understand something he can't take was not he is [Applause] he can't take was overloading him and my boy blows it all my vocal cords belongs to God my washer belongs to top just body belongs to God so I buy and reboot every spirit that's trying to silence me huh so I will Georgina pray for me men you know and and you know the enemy he he's so crappy because you out preaching and worship now I was saying we have words up here and people don't even open a money back there we say my blood you know we say my Redemption all the things that God is and we sitting there like Church do we understand haruya that God his or his presence it merits praise it calls for praise on them hey do your body a mean if you can see God visible right now would you keep the same composure most of us here lose all my God has so why do that if we believe that his presidency and then we are - we are - yup just like we believe he's here cuz he is he you know as I preached on worship it's like my voice started getting lost love this house the song leader so you don't have started thing you know sometimes I used to sing it get hoarse like I'm getting right now and you know and you had to come back and close the service now I'm kind of hoarse and never like see you ain't opposed to be seen looking you don't lose your ball you lose you lose away so you know what I said I'll sit back then I was meditating I was thinking and then God comes to me speaks in my heart gave me station I know my Oliver voice I'm coming stopped any good salt huh that ties in with the word hurry that didn't come from the devil that's not just something I know that's not just uh Oh perhaps no that's God speaking to you honey so I'm sitting there I'm digging about my voice and how I just love to worship I love to words you know I'm thinking it gosh I got hoarse and enemy is saying is saying it he says look exposes on my face a look you're not horse you just gave your voice to me I was like guys so you know I got a horse and everything and watch the chocolate you know I tell the enemy I will not be silent he's been to good church he's been too good but we ought to do right now no matter what your life look like you need to put all your band in one hand and then put your good in one ain't and I guarantee your good will always outweigh your bad you're always outweigh no matter what if you wake up every day that's enough good to outweigh your bad but like I said the Lord healed me from diabetes and you know about was last year it was last year I went to renew my license and people told me I had to take physical cuz I gotta see you so I walk in the office and the people say you got diabetes I'm like do y'all really want to fight this fight again she says no matter what they say if God ever visits you no circumstances no situations can ever take that away nobody can never take away your experience so God ever visit you God ever got something in your life no situation no trial no tribulation can ever take that away so I knew he was gonna visit me I've been healed from cancer in my brain and you want me to back down over looks mix-up in my in my in my in my blood like we say back home God please take you down south for a quick cavities but you know Church I'm walking all over the ladies say you got that beat just a nurse hooking me up now remember cold you understand I said if God ever visits you he don't leave you stay with you he want to make sure huh that the reason why he visit you is accomplished huh you know Church so you know I'm sitting in there go ahead and visit me before possible healing in my life and now I'm sitting there and all the ladies say yeah diabetes I looked at her I said no I still got the same revelation let me tell you something if you ever get a visitation by the spoken word of storm or trial or tribulation doesn't change the seed if God gives you a revelation of tribulation or storm does not change that revelation that revelation of home honey you say you say ready we had a snowstorm up in in in Akron and it got so cold that trees broke off you know apples dried up but I guarantee you I guarantee you is that apple tree oh yeah wasn't uprooted honey and the storm passes on in the spring and summertime comes around like I always do that tree or produce apples like it always does so the storm doesn't change the life inside the child the tribulation doesn't change how I feel religious holiday so Church don't whine and complain because you're going through something amen that doesn't change what God put in you sometimes it takes death to bring out more of what you are let me tell you a testimony to power the spoken word you know some friends of mine in London you know the sister she planted a pantry her backyard and you know year after year the tree got of size but it was never produce past so uh maybe a couple of years later she looked at the tree she walked out and she she come to my somebody listen to me good just just lady I'm talking about she believes the same thing you believe she serves the same God you serve this is the same message you do the same Bible you do I read me so she's no different amen so she walks up to the tree tree never gave any fruit she was I to the tree she says you know what she's talking to the tree now huh you saying she had to be crazy no a scripture Jesus talked to a fig tree Church if you can find in the Bible it has to happen that way every time I hope somebody black to claim they visitation Church she walks up to the tree and she said to the tree you know what I planted you so-and-so the time ago and you know you've never gave me any fruit she said if you don't give me any fruit i'ma cut you down [Applause] last time I heard a tree doesn't have ears that's a my hair or tree doesn't have a mind to understand the voice but you know what with one screen came back around hallelujah the next following year in the church begin to testify now these are the best paths we ever had Wow because those paths will produce all of the spoken word and I talked I've been back several times since then but I talked to a couple weeks ago either I say sister I've told that testimony all over the world she said oh yeah she said well let me tell you say you know what something so strange the tree started producing so much fruit to the branches started breaking what was it what was it it was a fulfillment of the word broken because the Bible says that God can produce my exceedingly abundantly above all according to the power T whether the tape would do the tree have a visitation for go and it stopped producing so much earlier that oh my the Bible says it'll be pressed down shaken together what happened it was so much beer produce that the branches start to break why so new stronger branches can come out sometime we took these stuff and we broke down what is God trying to do he's trying to make you stronger he try to push out more like in church holy that visitation remains earlier every time the season comes around it pushes out fruit it never has a barren season why because once visited always listen you know like I said I'm in the doctor's office lazy eye diabetes you know I don't say yes you do i say no i don't so we better get an argument because she looking at me like i don't know what I'm talking about cuz she's a nurse not realizing that I got experience with this I'm dealing with Joe with your instruments you know scientific degrees I'm dealing with the Word of God and my visitation oh yeah I'm doing they cannot return to me more she chose you never realize that you are the spoken word and that whatever you cannot return them to you though and you speak as a God it's just as if God is speaking colors I hope somebody getting something I ain't about going out here today Mercedes five-bedroom house you're lying on my dad ain't you wanted not good if that's what you need her and if that's the will of God don't be afraid to speak now I'm one of them people hallelujah you know and I always be like this if my car breaking down I'm like lord I need another car ain't gonna go to God in prayer no I please beste me with a piece of car what do you not know yo God hurry why ask him for the lesson when he can do the greater I don't go to God oh god bless me with a fiesta oh no oh no I want my god to be great in my life oh yeah now I got testimony by even in those areas but you know church you know meaning nurse we going back and forth she she I can tell I made her upset cuz she's not using big words on me you know she start going into us schooling and you got glucose you know start name goes and we toasted West Coast all kind of coast she's all over the place you know I say what you want to say no I don't so I'm going to meet a man based upon she she started to help me after that color see when people don't believe what you believe they can't see what you see the proper God say when abraham endured he said he endured because he could see it before when you standing your ground you're enduring that means you can see god's word being fulfilled just like he changed he said he became now we can say bestrode insane why did he become stronger because he knew it was going to happen that's what we got to be Church it's time to stop doubting God and and look for your visitation sometimes we pray we just see their prey and we need to say God you say no you say by your stripes I'm here Lord you saying holy thing my eyes and see if you want the winds of heaven you say that so she sees a little upset with me now so she says um just just go another one she says you know I tell you use you in this room doing it and you gotta wait on the darkness she just going back just going back there I knew she was upset with me because I wouldn't accept what she was trying to get me Malka I wouldn't accept it I said no that don't belong to me I I don't want no visitation from diabetes close it what buddies why because it's not scriptural oh nothing in my life it's not scriptural cancer not Scripture not Scripture the passion I receive no visitation but nothing is not scriptural you got a right to cast it down cuz it's not Scripture receive either world and the world only hallo hey hey seemed like the more I shot the clear of my boy ski [Applause] Wow you know Church he says well we're wheels we'll see what the doctor say so everybody all right open going to long the doctor she found you I'm sitting in the room I'm waiting for the doctor come in doctor comes in she says hey mr. Diggs how you doing I say I'm doing good and this is the thing even when certain things have been pronounced in your life what's coming out of your mouth huh that's what the visitation is all about because either you're gonna let demons visit you or angels message and you know in that moment Harley I couldn't easily deduct the doctor came in and she said mr. G's how you doing it oh she then I got type T and you know what type to with a B in my body because I gave it a pathway let me break let me let me say something to you hurry no sickness no spirit can get in your body to once you accept it as I thought first this is like most of us we we're living here today we can be in here and say we we cast a free why because we don't have a thought that we got it amen so it can't live in your body so it takes a word to pronounce that over you for you to accept it in your body hold so that's what the Bible says cast down imagination that exhaust except a brother in the house of God she let your meditation be on the things of God get up and say I'm blessed today it's gonna be a good day in the Lord don't give up tomorrow is Monday I shall hate come to work the day will be a terrible day but you wake up cut I go to work you get up you say I'm a king I'm a queen hey man I'm the boss at my job you might not have the title but you got spirit huh see you can create an atmosphere around you honey that's what we have to do rather walk in an atmosphere so now the doctor comes in she says hey mr. Dees how you doing I'm doing good she said oh that's good today is good I say today's excellent lives just oh man diabetes but I'm worried about that cuz I had an experience with it before my god has come back all right she told me [Music] [Applause] [Laughter] [Applause] [Applause] so church she told me we're gonna examine I'm gonna bludgeon that's me welcome hallelujah thank you Jesus she won't like the room and I wanted to do a praise dance up in it because what she felt realized she was going to get come machine for the diagnosis but God was already there the spoken word was already there huh so I didn't have to wait on her and her machine to come back for me to know what was gonna happen next okay I've already received my visitation oh yeah I received it over 2,000 years ago and he's still visiting us my best where's my stripes you heal so she comes back in she goes back in and she gets the machine but let me back up before she comes back in you know I mean I'm just praising God you know I said but Lord I know what's going on see I'm the kind of person I visit the doctor for any reason I'm just gonna walk by there with a good checkup the devil want me to fight cuz you'll always be a fight you know so I prepared myself for that you know I mean they can come back and say you got blue hopeless kosis number 59 somebody never heard of you never do i'ma fall back on what God has already done we'll say Hebrew baby yellow here agree I got it [Music] somebody how can you say that behind the visitation I've already received a visitation of healing hallelujah correct so that's what I speak over my life every time I'm in that situation so she comes back in you know I'm sitting there you know before she comes back I am sitting there I said okay god I know what I'm fighting it's the spirit of diabetes trying to get in my body but I said in the name of Jesus Christ I bind you diabetes right now the power to bind and the power to use whatsoever you should bound in heaven shall be by whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven whatever you so much shall be loosed in heaven I give you one for your family whosoever seen you admit shall be with me whosoever fears he retained shall be retain you you catch me God has put the visitation now in us when we visit our families we visit them as God holy because God had changed Moses is deacon Moses is Lord I can't do this I can't man shut up stop I know I can't speak shop who made your mouth did and dee-dee-dee-dee gave Moses so much strength and he wasn't ready for he told Moses something by himself that he wasn't ready for he said Moses you'll be gone and then Aaron be your prophet Moses wasn't ready for that hurry but how's he gonna get out of that he'll know Lord ain't ready to be God if God visits you he will to see that you are him huh his life lives in you huh so now just let me finish this testimony for close now I'm sitting there she comes in my little machine say okay let's do the blood test I ain't even worried you don't prick my finger she pricked my finger the machine goes off she looks oh you're right you don't have diabetes you know I said I told you but Church you weren't over he went over she looked at me and she starts to ask me questions she says oh well what did you eat last night she said cuz the strange one test is positive and one test is negative she said what a treat last night and y'all know me I said well I had sweet tea and some chocolate chip cookies and he possessed you know what she said to me the doctor the doctor she said to me after that she says oh yeah tea and cookies will show up in your system like that so I says here the light came I got a revelation listen to me good church the light came on so if I'm talking to her and you see what you see like I said is eating cookies so like okay we agree so if his team cookies why are you trying to change the name and diabetes chocolate chip you wanna call it news eg you wanna call it teeth why are they change the name why because they're fighting demons in our lives no but these are got stress your stress is called Jo P no stress is called children buddies I got back pain back pain and tau Pepsi coca-cola Oh what you didn't lift up on the job we let the enemy speak these things in child life and we accept it can we get a visitation from demon powers who we are to speak the blessings of God during the visitation of angels I gotta close the church I'm gonna read you something for close listen my church this is what the process is he says I'm told then we could and we could pick up an instrument that could catch it then it man's voice my voice that I speak today 10,000 years from now could still be picked up in the air like dropping a petal in your middle Apollo and the the teeny little ways after the fall that you seen by the I can kill you all to hyster bank you know he's describing he just started like when you when you when you throw rocks in the water and that wave it just keeps going it keeps going to hit something and then it stops he's saying that's what a voice is you say your voice who carry as long as they can carry huh there's nothing that can per say stop your voice and to hit something and you know sound waves they Scout huh but this smoking out there you know go and go until it finds a resting place along the way now listen to me now hallelujah he said the voice continually travels around and around the world he therefore then our voice when we say hey we'll be out judgment when you speak out your mouth who be your judgment amen hey I'm saying today yeah whatever God is you make him you can make it my Savior you can make him a hero you can also make him a judge by the life you live but it seems that come out of your mouth remember the chosen Israel they kept saying oh you brought us out here to die oh we had this Tunisia we had that oh because with no graves out here you make great light and gauzy you know what I'm sick of the smoothie stand back he says truly and you have spoken in my ears so shall it be they asked for graded kept saying we're gonna be great we're gonna be dead we will be just until honey they got a visitation from death early and God said Jah will see the promised land and to all y'all caucuses out here like y'all spoke nation over themselves remember you got Jesus on one cross he got parabola someone earlier and they hanging in and the people say he's the UH the axis you know Jesus or Barabbas is he give us Jesus kill him we don't kill him crucify your crews fire you know you see people that Koopa give us give us Barabbas back Church he said what about Jesus they said this is Church look at the visitation they don't get they said peel the Jews spoke that they spoke that they spoke a visitation of death on innocent people huh then a man comes up hurry up name hit in the hurry up and he kills a little 48 48 million Jews innocent people why they spoke they spoken so that was the visitation they got honey they receive and then listen church they receive look at the life they received they received a murderer back onto them instead of a savior they lacked the same to be crucified and they received hurry a murderer so they couldn't help but get a visitation of death just be careful what your life yeah and listen he says the only thing that can stop the word and you speak the wrong way out of your mouth he said the only thing that can stop it is repentance other than that is what you saying what you didn't meet you at the judgement the only thing that can stop that word hurry is repentance he says because God has to catch up with that word so he speak earlier in the name of Jesus Christ I'm blessed that word has to catch up with you to produce a blessing because it has to find a resting place on my church over and over so many illustrations and examples you know maybe I maybe I give you some more examples this evening you know by the grace of God but church when we leave out of here walk out of here being positive don't walk on it you look oh my life's gonna get cut off the shoal is cuz you spoke it and everybody got to happen you spoke it if you won't God is real oh my listen lad he was here my brother wouldn't die you know he can't can you master I can just imagine honey you know Jesus he loves praise he can't resist praise because he's God

mother mother comes up to Jesus she say oh nothing today we gonna do she said if you've been here nothing wouldn't die so I can see Jesus a sail tell me a little bit more sail so Jesus Jesus they just go straight to the tomb he wanted a little bit more words you want a little bit more worship hallelujah so Jesus said your brother you know a romantic man my father saying even so long even now colors whatever you ask the Father you do it right now can you hear us and energy and Jesus no bit closer to us she grew in here don't like pains that can you imagine the author of praise is receiving praise oh yeah and she said even now Lord whatever you ask the Father he'll do it and she's like she already said you've been here he would've died and I should say but now that you hear if you ask God I know you do why don't we speak like that when it looks so bad her brother was dead harder for over three days huh corruption hadn't set in but praise stopped it the right the right words visitation stop Nazareth dead honey look Church and she gives you Jesus ammo and then she said Jesus a honey don't worry but he said he's a daughter don't worry about it don't brother raise again but my mother said yeah I know you gonna raise again and did she called him out her she put him in position honey she said no I know he will raise again in the day of the resurrection [Laughter] [Applause] [Music]
