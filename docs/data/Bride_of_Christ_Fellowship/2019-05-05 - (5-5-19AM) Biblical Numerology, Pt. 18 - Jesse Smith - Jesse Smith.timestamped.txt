[13:51] do - brother Keith ran off Vangelis he
[13:56] was in the Philippines I'm not sure if
[13:57] he's home or not yet but he did text me
[13:59] kind of strangely this morning and said
[14:02] can you please remember a special
[14:03] unspoken request so just seems like it's
[14:07] urgent need let's pray for brother Keith
[14:10] also a text brother bang and I said did
[14:13] the baby arrived yet and he said not yet

[15:31] pray with the faith of Jesus Christ the
[15:34] assurance that's what faith means

[27:49] [Music]
[28:02] [Music]
[28:11] let's invite our massive weights the
[28:14] word and won't sing one more song as if
[28:16] it shine on me Lord
[28:27] on me like me
[28:45] Lord Sai

[29:16] [Music]
[29:33] [Music]
[29:44] [Music]
[31:49] [Music]
[31:55] like to go to Leviticus here like to go
[32:00] back to the book I'm sorry the
[32:02] numerology series and so the video is 25
[32:05] we never finished the Jubilee so I'd
[32:07] like to finish the Jubilee by God's
[32:10] grace
[32:17] so Leviticus 25 verse 29
[32:20] I just want look at about about three
[32:22] scriptures here 25 29 Leviticus chapter
[32:39] 25 verse 29 and we looked at last time
[32:46] at the how the Jubilee operated on the
[32:50] fiftieth year every every slave could go
[32:53] free as a type of Christ freeing us from
[32:57] our sins and our slavery and and then
[32:59] I've just felt led to go with the
[33:02] thought of restoring and how that's one
[33:05] thing we can restore because we pulled
[33:08] out of here out of verse 28 we pulled
[33:11] out of here how a man he can restore his
[33:14] own his own property he can restore it
[33:16] he can go buy it back and the only time
[33:19] the Bible says for us to restore
[33:21] anything is our time we must use our
[33:23] time for the glory of God so I felt led
[33:26] to go that way not today we'll look at a
[33:28] little different thought and it's so
[33:31] church the neck they thought today is
[33:33] that we don't organize and die
[33:36] spiritually so that's the thought that's
[33:39] connected to Jubilee because you're
[33:41] either gonna go free and redeem the time
[33:44] or you're gonna die spiritually we don't
[33:47] want to die spiritually we want to be
[33:49] free amen
[33:50] or we don't want to die we want to live
[33:53] Leviticus 25 29 and if a man sell a
[33:57] dwelling-house in a walled city then he
[34:00] may redeem it within a whole year after
[34:03] it is sold within a full year may he
[34:07] redeem it and if it be not redeemed
[34:10] within the space of a year then the
[34:13] house that is in the walled city shall
[34:15] be established forever to him that
[34:17] bought it through his generations it
[34:20] shall not go out in the Jubilee look at
[34:23] that that just struck me you only have a
[34:26] certain amount of time to restore that
[34:29] and if not it's shut off forever
[34:33] and that's should remind us of the quote
[34:36] where brother Graham said there's a line
[34:38] between God's mercy and God's judgment
[34:40] we each have a certain little there's
[34:43] only a certain time you have to get that
[34:45] fire back to get that will to restore
[34:47] back what you were you lost because
[34:51] jesus said if you don't he said then
[34:53] those Devils will come back with seven
[34:55] more right and it'll be worse off than
[34:58] it was at the beginning so there's just
[35:00] a short there's a little time period
[35:02] that they had now verse 31 let's read
[35:08] verse 31 together on three one two three
[35:11] the houses of the villages which have no
[35:14] wall round about them shall be counted
[35:16] as the fields of the country they may be
[35:20] redeemed and shout oh how in the Jubilee
[35:23] may God as blessings read his word you
[35:25] may be seated and just so you know I'm
[35:27] taking this from brother Rams thoughts
[35:28] and the message returned in Jubilee 1962
[35:32] that he preached in Louisiana so I just
[35:37] want to give that kind of disclaimer
[35:39] that I didn't get these thoughts from
[35:40] myself I got them from God's prophet you
[35:43] know so Lydia do have some quotes here I
[35:46] like to look at today it's good to be in
[35:49] house Lord with everybody good to see
[35:50] the Saints today missed you last week
[35:51] but it seemed like everybody had a
[35:53] really good time in the Lord so very
[35:55] thankful for that we had a good time
[35:57] there and I was able to share a little
[35:59] bit about on Wednesday but just got the
[36:00] witness and try to share the light of
[36:03] God with so
[36:04] strangers and then some family members
[36:06] so it's very thankful for that
[36:10] so let's look here to the Word of God
[36:11] we're looking at part 18 and then we're
[36:14] looking at the Jubilee again we're
[36:16] looking at 50 and 50 is the Jubilee or
[36:20] Pentecost we looked at that about two
[36:23] weeks ago and I want to start with the
[36:27] other 50s I found in scripture as well
[36:29] just to kind of finish that thought of
[36:31] 50 because after this will go on I think
[36:33] the next number is 60 and then for that
[36:35] the next number biblically is 66 because
[36:38] there's 66 books of the Bible and then
[36:41] 70 then 75 and I think a hundred after
[36:45] that I'm just kind of going over my
[36:48] memory of the numbers then you get to
[36:50] 120 in 120 the upper room and you keep
[36:52] going and there's all kinds of numbers
[36:54] there that God shows but let's look at
[36:58] 50 here Genesis has 50 chapters and
[37:02] that's the gene chapter of the original
[37:04] chapter right of the Bible so it has 50
[37:07] and 50 represents write a new beginning
[37:09] so see God began his word with 50
[37:12] chapters very fitting the width of
[37:16] Noah's Ark was 50 cubits now and Noah's
[37:18] Ark you have three different numbers you
[37:20] have a 300 long you have a 30 tall and
[37:24] then you have 50 wide now 50 of courses
[37:28] in this case is jubilee deliverance
[37:31] didn't the difference come through the
[37:32] ark and didn't have to have a certain
[37:34] height of character 30 Jesus's ministry
[37:37] sovereignty was 30 years old now 300 is
[37:40] linked to deliverance - because getting
[37:41] to have 300 soldiers and they be the
[37:44] Midianites with 300 so these numbers all
[37:47] mean something I don't claim to know all
[37:49] these but it's interesting if you
[37:51] compare them to the scripture what
[37:52] you'll find but we see 50 is in Noah's
[37:55] Ark 50 cubits wide and now also notice
[38:02] next 50 years old was the age limit for
[38:05] priests working in the tabernacle so
[38:07] once you got to 50 you could finish your
[38:09] 50th year and then you no more work
[38:12] after that so that was the limit for
[38:14] workers also
[38:17] interesting I heard us on a on a
[38:20] witnessing video this week I was looking
[38:22] at you know how straight I was looking
[38:24] at Street Preachers and I really
[38:26] appreciate the faith of street preachers
[38:27] I told my wife of God terry's I want to
[38:29] go to this little school of theirs a
[38:31] school where you can learn the street
[38:32] priest now I would never you know
[38:34] organize but I like to learn some of
[38:36] their thoughts and how they how they
[38:39] overcome because maybe somebody I'd like
[38:40] to do that we've gone out a couple times
[38:42] and witness to people maybe four or five
[38:44] times went into parks by the Brooks and
[38:46] I had different places and and did some
[38:47] good witnessing I like to do that
[38:49] sometime because I really feel like it's
[38:51] a necessary thing to do and I just maybe
[38:54] sometime if God would lead me I'd like
[38:55] to do that but a man who laid with a
[38:59] virgin without betrothing her in
[39:01] courtship or promising her courtship had
[39:04] to marry her and pay fifty shekels of
[39:06] silver so fifty was a price for it to
[39:09] her father this would be can now this
[39:12] would be consensual fornication because
[39:15] the scripture would say if they be found
[39:17] now if you read though verses 22 to 27
[39:21] earlier in the chapter you'll find that
[39:24] God you know some sinners will say you
[39:28] know a man was allowed to rape a woman
[39:29] no a man never was allowed to rape a
[39:31] woman God would never put up with that
[39:33] this is speaking of consensual
[39:36] fornication because they were found they
[39:38] be found together
[39:40] this woman would not be screaming or
[39:42] trying to get away at something she just
[39:43] consented to maybe they both got caught
[39:45] in a moment of passion and we're
[39:47] definitely walking in flesh but rape is
[39:52] condemned by stoning in Deuteronomy 22
[39:56] verses 22 to 27 and just the man was
[40:00] stoned if the woman was crying out right
[40:04] if she was in a city or crying out but
[40:07] if she wasn't then they both were stoned
[40:11] and so God which would have been just
[40:14] fornication right just been playing
[40:15] fornication so we see God never puts up
[40:21] with sin it's it goes against God nature
[40:23] God hates sin God loves righteousness
[40:26] and so any fool I'd not say that
[40:29] atheists
[40:31] because that's what I mean by fool I'm
[40:32] not name column but Bible calls them
[40:33] fools any eighth is that would say oh
[40:35] the Bible says it's okay to to rape it's
[40:38] not it's not in the scripture and you
[40:40] just have to go back to the word and ask
[40:42] God for an understanding of his word
[40:44] amen so but her price though if he
[40:48] wanted to marry her I'm sorry the man
[40:52] took her but didn't go through the
[40:53] courtship process was fifty shekels of
[40:56] silver now this is interesting too David
[41:01] bought a threshing floor and oxen for
[41:04] fifty shekels of silver to build an
[41:07] altar to God after his sin and numbering
[41:10] the people you remember that if you read
[41:12] second Samuel the whole chapters about
[41:14] it
[41:14] Satan tricks David to number the people
[41:18] now it's interesting church there's a
[41:20] time and season a number of the people
[41:21] because Moses was told to number the
[41:24] people and they came out of history of
[41:26] Egypt right God told him number and God
[41:29] wrote a whole book on it called numbers
[41:32] but David is condemned for it because it
[41:37] was a thing of pride it was a thing of
[41:39] arrogance but Moses's was for records he
[41:42] was all for records to be able to show
[41:44] the lineage all the way up to Christ
[41:46] amen to see God and God was proving to
[41:49] Israel that no matter where you are I'm
[41:51] with you I'll never forsake you whether
[41:53] you're in your homeland free or if
[41:55] you're you're in bondage in Egypt I'll
[41:57] never forsake you I'll be with you I'll
[41:59] even multiply you in your slavery amen
[42:02] but a great promise of God oh how God
[42:05] loves us amen now after this offering
[42:09] though the pledge was made from Israel
[42:11] and but I love how David didn't have
[42:14] attributes like Abraham the man tried to
[42:16] give the threshing floor to Dave and oh
[42:18] just take it it's for the king and David
[42:20] said no I've got to pay a price for this
[42:23] if I if if God has called me to
[42:25] sacrifice it's not a sacrifice if
[42:28] they're if there's no pain involved if
[42:30] there's no loss involved right if
[42:32] somebody gives you a hundred dollars
[42:33] then you give it to the man on the
[42:36] street really you know like real quick
[42:37] like that or something like that that
[42:39] may not be a sacrifice that's between
[42:41] you and God but you see if it's if
[42:43] something's given
[42:45] then you quickly give it away is it
[42:47] really a sacrifice but when we when we
[42:50] labor for something and when we really
[42:52] understand and work for something and
[42:55] then sacrifice well I really could have
[42:57] used that hundred dollars or $100 was my
[42:59] last hundred dollars in my bank account
[43:01] now you're getting the sacrifice and you
[43:04] know where you're you don't know where
[43:05] your next hundred is coming from now
[43:09] like you got you know I got fifty
[43:10] thousand bank account somebody gave me
[43:12] ten hundred bucks on us I think thank
[43:14] you I'll give it to the widow you know
[43:16] it's not like that but David said I've
[43:19] got to sacrifice I have to know the pain
[43:21] of this to help me understand the pain
[43:23] that I caused Israel Church I think it
[43:26] was well over forty thousand people died
[43:28] because of his sin and numbering the
[43:29] people look what pride will do now we
[43:31] always we always preach on Aiken sixteen
[43:34] people died because Aiken but what about
[43:36] David what about David innocent Jew
[43:39] isn't Israelites Jews forty thousand
[43:42] died and plague and pestilence because
[43:45] of his pride lifted himself look what a
[43:46] great man of God I am now I can't
[43:48] explain why I got allowed that to happen
[43:49] I can't maybe those people were already
[43:52] in sin and weren't repenting as well I
[43:54] may because God works everything for his
[43:56] glory I don't understand that but one
[43:58] thing's for sure
[43:59] is that it was wrong of David to get
[44:01] lifted up and we've got to make sure we
[44:04] don't get lifted up as well but the
[44:05] price to pay was fifty interesting fifty
[44:09] and Abraham member he said well I need a
[44:13] cave and the the the men of Machpelah
[44:15] said you can have our cake just have it
[44:17] Great Father faith you know you're at
[44:19] your patriarch just have it and Abraham
[44:21] said no I'm gonna pay for it I'm not
[44:23] gonna let people say that man made me
[44:25] rich I want people to say that god bless
[44:27] me that's what we want to say today all
[44:30] of our testimonies it wasn't a men that
[44:32] did this for me or was it Jose that made
[44:34] me this or that but God did this for me
[44:36] although we appreciate amen and Jose's
[44:38] work or any blessing you get from a
[44:41] saint here I appreciate you know all of
[44:44] our sisters for all their blessings but
[44:46] we don't want it to be a man getting
[44:48] glory we want God to get all the glory
[44:51] so fifty somehow fifty is connected here
[44:54] now I think we're getting now back to
[44:56] yeah let's get back to the Jubilee now
[44:58] and this was ready to preach two weeks
[45:01] ago I never got to it because the other
[45:03] message took took up the whole time
[45:05] demon the time so this was ready to go
[45:08] two weeks ago I just added a few things
[45:10] here
[45:12] so in this thought of Jubilee that you
[45:15] can go free it wasn't just for everybody
[45:19] right like we saw like like we saw last
[45:22] time you know the the gospel trumpet
[45:25] sounds and you've got to respond to that
[45:28] you've actually got to leave your hoe or
[45:30] your rake behind if someone wants to
[45:33] remain enslaved to sin they can remain
[45:36] enslaved us in God's not gonna force
[45:38] anybody to serve Him
[45:40] right and so even with even with the
[45:43] great news of Jubilee humanity still has
[45:47] a choice to make you and I still have a
[45:49] choice to make how many can say amen to
[45:51] that God still gives us a choice in fact
[45:55] if I can just find that message yeah
[45:58] it's upon some quotes yesterday from
[45:59] leadership 1965 I don't have up here but
[46:02] I found Mother Ram saying this and I
[46:04] wrote it a copied and pasted it real
[46:05] quick here Bertram's talking about Elvis
[46:11] how he had a gift that God gave him he
[46:15] says see you don't want to do what Elvis
[46:17] did it's a talent God gave you and
[46:19] you've got to choose who and where
[46:22] you're going to use that talent for God
[46:24] or whether you're going to use it for
[46:26] the devil program said each
[46:30] he said see you have to choose what
[46:33] you're going to do now how many know the
[46:35] footsteps of the righteous sir order the
[46:37] Lord they are but that's our order based
[46:41] upon what he knows you're already going
[46:43] to choose he's not going to force you to
[46:45] go to heaven if you don't want to go to
[46:46] heaven he's not gonna force you to go to
[46:49] hell you don't want to go to hell right
[46:51] but I said each one of us has to make a
[46:54] choice and it's confronted to us but
[46:57] we're all confronted with this one thing
[46:59] what are we going to do about eternal
[47:00] life we're going to live here after or
[47:04] not that we have to come to Jesus to get
[47:06] that the opportunity of choosing that's
[47:09] one thing God gave us he
[47:11] force nothing on us did I read that
[47:15] again never he catch yet he don't force
[47:19] nothing on us brother Branham says he
[47:22] didn't force you to come to church today
[47:24] thank God that means you got the victory
[47:26] amen
[47:27] if you really came because you love God
[47:29] that means you got the victory I wanted
[47:31] to come Satan didn't drive me here and
[47:35] even God did it amen but it's God gave
[47:37] me that choice and God no God sees I
[47:39] want to be in his house he don't force
[47:43] nothing on us he just let us make our
[47:45] own choice so you have to not be forced
[47:49] but just make your own choice hallelujah
[47:54] so see and now I'm going back to that
[47:56] message I preached last year Christ and
[47:58] Mister God revealed
[47:59] I just preached four or five sermons off
[48:00] brother Graham's message and I want to
[48:02] read this again but Graham said he had
[48:05] to let put man on free more agency to
[48:08] fall so that he might be a savior to
[48:12] display what's in him his attribute of a
[48:15] savior all right no I think I misplaced
[48:21] my thought here let me see how getting
[48:22] on the right order he says he could not
[48:27] do it as great Jehovah covered all space
[48:29] and time he had to become a man he took
[48:31] kinship with the man that was lost to
[48:32] become man God made flesh amen
[48:37] he says but when he put man on
[48:39] partnership with him he said he had to
[48:44] let you get lost in other words he had
[48:46] to let you be a slave during the time of
[48:48] the Jubilee before the Jubilee
[48:50] he said you understand he had to let
[48:53] them sin put them on free more agency he
[48:56] could not make them sin and remain God
[48:59] and then punished them for something he
[49:01] made them do so I'm bringing out the
[49:04] free more agency thought again and tying
[49:07] it into the Jubilee everybody had the
[49:09] free choice you can either go free or
[49:11] you can remain a slave program says that
[49:14] about God he put men on partnership with
[49:17] him and let men act as a free more agent
[49:20] the same thing he's got you on today you
[49:22] act any way you want to you're a free
[49:24] moral agent
[49:25] so therefore if he put the first like
[49:28] that he has to put the second like that
[49:30] and put every one like that or he acted
[49:32] wrong in the first place
[49:35] hallelujah he said again he said God
[49:39] never just said well I'll choose this
[49:41] one I'll choose that one nobody he knew
[49:44] by his he could predestinate because
[49:47] he's infinite and so being infinite he
[49:50] knowed everything he knowed the end and
[49:52] could tell the beginning from the end
[49:56] because God knew what you'd choose he
[49:58] had to give you a free more agency or
[50:00] else you could stand there and say no
[50:02] you forced me to disbelieve God so you
[50:05] can't send me to hell because you forced
[50:07] me to do it no God will say I gave you
[50:09] free more agency because I knew what you
[50:11] would choose I ordained these things
[50:13] that happen here's here's how he's got
[50:16] his great remote control and he rewinds
[50:18] it back their lives he hears when the
[50:20] message came to you you turned it down
[50:22] you could have accepted it and look look
[50:24] here here's someone that you're Jessie
[50:26] received it but you turn it down amen
[50:29] I don't know yeah everyone had the same
[50:31] for you more ages that you and then you
[50:33] could hear fast-forward here
[50:34] a year later you could have received it
[50:36] they're here 10 years later see God
[50:38] gives us all these opportunities because
[50:40] of his love and he's waiting for you and
[50:43] I had to respond now he knows if you
[50:44] respond but I say let's respond with
[50:46] more love all the time to him let's go
[50:49] deeper with the things of God because
[50:51] that's where we're we're getting with
[50:52] this thought right here we've got to
[50:54] choose to go deeper in the things of the
[50:56] Lord and I know you want to because
[50:58] that's why you're here amen hallelujah
[51:02] let me get this here now let's look at
[51:05] this thought Jubilee and if a man sell a
[51:09] dwelling house in a walled city then he
[51:14] may redeem it within a whole year after
[51:15] it's sold within a full year he may
[51:17] redeem it so a man let's let's say the
[51:20] house of Levi you know in the Levite
[51:22] city it's walled in if he owns a house
[51:25] in there but you know he got came on
[51:26] hard times maybe his his crop wasn't
[51:30] good that well of course Levi didn't
[51:31] have crops so let's use let's use
[51:32] somebody else let's use a Manasseh
[51:36] Manasseh and it's
[51:38] for a good that year oh my I need to
[51:40] sell my little apartment there so I can
[51:43] pay off this other bill well once he
[51:46] sold that house in the Wold place he had
[51:48] one year to buy back the Bible said but
[51:52] verse 30 if it be not redeemed within
[51:55] the space of a full year then the house
[51:57] that is walled in the walled city shall
[51:59] be established forever to him that
[52:02] bought it throughout his generations it
[52:04] shall not go on the Jubilee
[52:06] so because it's walled in he says he's
[52:09] got one year if you don't pull it out
[52:11] and I'm sorry you don't we buy it back
[52:13] you're losing it because it's walled in
[52:16] all right now the next verse but the
[52:20] house of the villages was have no raw
[52:22] round about them shall be counted as the
[52:24] fields of the country that they may
[52:26] redeemed be redeemed and they shall go
[52:30] out in the Jubilee
[52:32] all right so if it was if your property
[52:35] was in a walled place you got one year
[52:37] to get that back because it's walled in
[52:39] it's it's private property I imagine but
[52:42] out there in the fields well you could
[52:45] leave it for you know forty-eight
[52:46] forty-nine years
[52:48] well that fiftieth year you get it back
[52:50] right you get it back but not inside of
[52:53] the walled city you can't get that back
[52:55] inside a wall denomination amen
[52:58] you see where everyone's going with this
[52:59] he said did you notice as you read it
[53:01] when you go home if you haven't then if
[53:03] a man brought property in the side of a
[53:05] walled city then he had one year to
[53:07] redeem it back if he sold it and if he
[53:10] did not redeem that back that property
[53:12] if it was inside of a wall I had to stay
[53:14] there they could not go free in the
[53:15] Jubilee it was bound to stay there they
[53:20] were over the wall they never heard that
[53:22] Jubilee the trumpet sounding they
[53:24] sounded the trumpet and it could not go
[53:26] free so a wall represented that that the
[53:30] sound of that trumpet would not get to
[53:32] them that wall represented the
[53:35] seperation between hearing God's Word
[53:37] and no longer hearing God's Word right
[53:40] and that's what the common slave
[53:42] represented with the all's in the ears
[53:43] right from Leviticus and Exodus before
[53:46] they even got there God said you tell
[53:48] though those Israelites if they don't
[53:50] want to go free that's fine
[53:52] they got to be taken down to the
[53:53] doorposts of the temple and they got to
[53:55] have an earring place in their ear so
[53:57] people can see right away are you a
[53:59] slave or are you free
[54:01] amen that's how God marks people today
[54:03] by the word that you're listening by the
[54:06] ministry you're setting under shows
[54:08] whether you're a slave to sin or whether
[54:10] you're free in the righteousness of
[54:11] Christ right it's seen in your hearing
[54:14] well I remember really feeding on these
[54:16] denominational things that I'm really
[54:18] feeding on this and oh brother man was
[54:20] not a prophet it shows you're marked in
[54:22] the ear hey man
[54:24] whether you're feeding on the word of
[54:26] the hour and the truth of God's Word and
[54:28] you're hearing the things of God and it
[54:30] shows you're free in Christ Jesus that's
[54:34] right and once it was sealed through the
[54:36] ear there was you can there's no more
[54:37] freedom you couldn't hear so this wall
[54:39] represents the same thing that's all and
[54:42] the ear represents right it represents
[54:46] the same thing one was on property and
[54:48] then one was on the physical body like I
[54:51] was even wrote in my book when you saw a
[54:54] Jewish woman you could tell right away
[54:55] if it was woman or man or if it was free
[54:57] or not the hair would be long on the
[55:00] woman uncut
[55:02] she'd have woman garments women had
[55:04] women's women's roles now all the way
[55:07] down to the ground they often dragged on
[55:09] the ground man kind of just went like to
[55:11] the the shin and that's proven me and
[55:15] all the almanacs in history women's
[55:17] garments were all the way down to the
[55:18] ground and that men had bigger belts or
[55:22] girdles because they had to carry their
[55:23] money purse there and their swords so
[55:28] the men had this big huge girdle whereas
[55:30] women didn't either he had a real narrow
[55:32] girdle or just had no girdle at all and
[55:34] there were special styles like I don't
[55:36] know the styles but let's say the
[55:38] women's were were more colorful styles
[55:40] of garments so you could tell right away
[55:42] maybe he was more plain so man you could
[55:46] tell right away a man had short hair of
[55:49] course he had a beard right man had a
[55:51] beard women didn't have a beard and then
[55:53] you could tell by looking at the ears so
[55:55] God had all these outward differences to
[55:58] show which gender they were God made it
[56:02] obvious because God's not the author of
[56:03] confusion right
[56:05] but the ears showed whether you were
[56:07] free or not whether you could hear the
[56:09] gospel trumpet or you couldn't Amen he
[56:15] says I'm so afraid that one of the
[56:16] things that we had in the beginning how
[56:18] the old-timers preach against organizing
[56:20] themselves together we turned around and
[56:23] done the very thing back fathers fought
[56:28] so hard to come out of and the walled
[56:31] city I'm afraid that too many of us
[56:33] today too many of our Pentecostal people
[56:36] has got walled into some denomination
[56:40] some organization somewhere and we'll
[56:43] never hear the sound of the jubilee and
[56:47] never come back to the inheritance so
[56:49] brother Aaron said that wall must have
[56:52] kind of hindered the noise of the
[56:53] trumpet so they couldn't hear it anymore
[56:57] right and so my dad says that wall
[56:59] represents building a wall between God's
[57:02] truth and man's idea so true worship and
[57:06] false worship amen now a couple of weeks
[57:12] ago I preached on the purpose series
[57:14] part 16 I just want to I thought
[57:16] strangely yesterday oh I just preached
[57:18] about walls and I remember cuz the
[57:20] walkers were here that was with my wife
[57:22] I think I had her I had her keys right
[57:25] yeah keys are in our car and I just want
[57:27] to review these real quick Church and I
[57:29] want to say this again brother Branham
[57:31] said you can't leave this service the
[57:33] same way you came you were either gonna
[57:36] build up the wall stronger and keep
[57:38] Satan out or let Satan knock down some
[57:41] of those bricks and for a lot of people
[57:44] especially in denominations or sinners
[57:46] all of God's bricks have been not now
[57:49] there's no more faith virtue and now
[57:51] Satan's build up walls in their lives as
[57:55] well see there's there's two walls you
[57:59] can build it's either a wall of godly
[58:00] character the stature perfect man right
[58:04] or you can do like this a wall of pride
[58:10] the Bible said the rich man's wealth is
[58:13] city and as in a high wall in his own
[58:15] conceit to a high wall of conceit of
[58:19] pride he's been up a wall of pride well
[58:22] look what I can do
[58:23] see how I'm protected from anything that
[58:25] could happen because of all my money
[58:27] because of how smart I am and how many
[58:29] jobs I can get and how good I am at
[58:31] earning money I'm such a wise
[58:35] businessman I'm I'm a sleuth see ya it's
[58:39] just a wall that's built up each day oh
[58:41] I'll get more and more smart look how
[58:43] great I am
[58:43] Omar with all this money that look how
[58:45] great I am but see the the Bible says
[58:50] laziness breaks down the spiritual wall
[58:53] now this is what we got a watch out for
[58:55] many times no not saying that we don't
[58:56] the watch out for pride I've got a
[58:58] battle pride you've got a battle pride
[59:00] but laziness slothful comes by the
[59:04] vineyard of a slothful person and it's
[59:06] all going over a thorn or cares to the
[59:08] world
[59:09] I also cover the face there up and the
[59:11] stone wall was broken down so a lazy
[59:14] Christian life causes your protection or
[59:17] your self-control to be broken down
[59:21] yeah I'm just reviewing real quick
[59:23] because my other bands had two habits or
[59:25] spirits so when you got a bad habit you
[59:27] know it's an evil spirit that's gotten
[59:29] to our life and God help each one of us
[59:31] amen because we're all susceptible we
[59:34] all we're all tempted daily right now
[59:38] either have no rule over his spirit is
[59:40] like a city that's broken down and
[59:42] without walls and that means
[59:44] self-control so rule means self-control
[59:47] so this is the faith virtue knowledge
[59:49] temperance
[59:49] this is the fourth step of the statute
[59:51] perform and if someone's broken down and
[59:54] doesn't have that then they just can't
[59:56] control the they might even go to church
[59:58] they might have been baptized in the
[59:59] name of Lord Jesus Christ they don't
[1:00:01] have a temperance then they're a lust
[1:00:03] Fein right they're a cigarette Fein
[1:00:05] they're an alcohol Fein and yet they
[1:00:07] might have been genuinely baptized in
[1:00:09] the name of Lord Jesus Christ
[1:00:10] how many have I seen like that
[1:00:12] especially Lima we baptize so many young
[1:00:14] people around 2001 2002 2003 and many of
[1:00:18] them were baptized and then they went
[1:00:20] out got drunk or smoked weed
[1:00:22] I know numerous people that did that so
[1:00:25] what does it show they might have got
[1:00:26] faith
[1:00:27] and knowledge or faith virtue knowledge
[1:00:30] but definitely by the time they got here
[1:00:32] they didn't get this and because of that
[1:00:35] all the other bricks got torn down and
[1:00:38] one brother in particular I know went to
[1:00:40] jail because he beat his family yet I
[1:00:41] saw him get baptized the name of Lord
[1:00:43] Jesus Christ try to serve God was
[1:00:45] faithful for a few months he got built
[1:00:47] up but then all knocked down because he
[1:00:51] failed to go on with God not a god help
[1:00:55] us Church so see that's part of your
[1:01:00] building part of your wall of protection
[1:01:04] is when you get more better habits amen
[1:01:07] I don't have that habit to do that
[1:01:09] anymore thank God amen
[1:01:13] he's not got to protect and we get bad
[1:01:16] habits it starts breaking that wall down
[1:01:18] I used to be so on I used to be so
[1:01:20] dedicated needs to be so disciplined
[1:01:22] what happened Satan's starting to
[1:01:24] knocking down your wall you came into a
[1:01:26] service and you didn't let God build up
[1:01:28] the wall instead you just heard it like
[1:01:30] a just like a lecture preaching became a
[1:01:33] lecture instead of a feeding amen glory
[1:01:36] this is not a lecture this is a
[1:01:39] supernatural feast on the things of
[1:01:41] God's great meat his great meaty feast
[1:01:45] I'd say his spiritual buffet and we're
[1:01:49] all carnivores here I hope yeah cuz
[1:01:54] spiritual meat is discernment between
[1:01:57] good and evil I'm trying to get you and
[1:02:00] myself to discern good and evil in our
[1:02:02] lives
[1:02:03] and if we do that programs it will be an
[1:02:05] invincible army which which we have been
[1:02:08] we've been invincible for all these
[1:02:09] years that God's out of church here
[1:02:10] Satan's not destroyed us he's not taking
[1:02:13] us in the creeds and dogmas we've been
[1:02:15] invincible not by our power but by the
[1:02:17] power of the Holy Ghost to let him
[1:02:20] continually build so we don't get cold
[1:02:21] on God and we don't start loving the
[1:02:23] things of the world but he had faith
[1:02:24] virtue now his patient separates God his
[1:02:26] brother kindness and then caps it off
[1:02:28] with charity amen
[1:02:29] and then he starts planting these seeds
[1:02:31] him the fruits of the spirit after years
[1:02:33] grow out and these great grapes of
[1:02:35] faithfulness and these great grapes of
[1:02:37] of love and faith are see and
[1:02:39] share with other people so people can
[1:02:41] see the fruit of God coming from our
[1:02:43] lives amen
[1:02:45] but with many church this happens the
[1:02:49] wall is broken down they no longer pray
[1:02:52] in the morning they never confess their
[1:02:54] sins to their husband or wife or they
[1:02:56] don't come up for prayer anymore they're
[1:02:58] brought it's broken down by bad habits
[1:03:01] but the RAM called it in the message
[1:03:03] that's ferment he called it a scrap heap
[1:03:05] of Ministers that have tried to climb
[1:03:07] this but have fallen off he said there's
[1:03:10] a scrap heap of Christians and ministers
[1:03:13] just laying by the side of this gospel
[1:03:16] highway but then saw one of them try to
[1:03:18] walk with high heels and what happened
[1:03:19] she fell off in the scrap heap right
[1:03:23] because you can't walk it exalt on your
[1:03:25] stuff like a sex object
[1:03:27] you can't walk that highway of holiness
[1:03:28] like that you'll fall off because you're
[1:03:31] causing brothers or you're calling it
[1:03:33] causing sinners to lust after you and
[1:03:35] those are demon lusts and that takes you
[1:03:37] off the path of righteousness and it put
[1:03:39] you on the path to hell that's right
[1:03:43] so mister briefly reviewing Nehemiah had
[1:03:47] one hand working with the stones the
[1:03:49] revelation and one hand speaking the
[1:03:52] Word of God with one hand he's building
[1:03:55] up the revelations of the law and the
[1:03:57] other hand he's speaking the word get
[1:03:59] behind me saying it's written now saith
[1:04:01] the Lord he puts this revelation upon
[1:04:02] that and he was working with both hands
[1:04:04] amen that's a we should be new and
[1:04:06] constantly building with revelations
[1:04:08] from every service I'm a witness every
[1:04:11] sermon I preached by God's grace
[1:04:13] something fresh comes out amen and you
[1:04:16] place that revelation on your character
[1:04:18] oh I can get closer to God here are you
[1:04:19] closer there and what Satan tries to
[1:04:21] come and say get behind me devil you're
[1:04:23] a liar you're brough out of you in Jesus
[1:04:25] Christ's name according to this word
[1:04:27] amen so you've got to have both it's a
[1:04:31] building process and yes we have to
[1:04:33] build and fight at the same time we
[1:04:37] don't get any breaks Church right we got
[1:04:41] to build and fight at the exact same
[1:04:43] time see
[1:04:48] the weapons of God pull down strongholds
[1:04:52] now there is this one case let me add
[1:04:54] this you can have a wall build up of
[1:04:56] keeping Satan out but then inside of
[1:04:59] your wall inside of your land you can
[1:05:01] build up a complex right his brother man
[1:05:02] was clearly sealed by the Holy Ghost
[1:05:04] yeah the stache former man but he build
[1:05:06] up a complex and almost decided to stop
[1:05:09] preaching because people want to hear
[1:05:12] his message and brother have said I had
[1:05:15] a complex and he said I build it up so
[1:05:18] even inside of his Holy Ghost character
[1:05:21] Satan had built up a complex against the
[1:05:23] people he said they want to hear my
[1:05:25] preaching well they won't have to I'll
[1:05:26] just quit preaching that's exactly what
[1:05:28] Satan wanted all that love how the
[1:05:30] weapons of God came down what was it he
[1:05:33] was just driving the car over a man
[1:05:35] that's how mighty God's weapons are
[1:05:37] they'll meet you in the church that meet
[1:05:39] you in the car they'll meet you anywhere
[1:05:41] they'll meet you on the job
[1:05:42] God's weapons are active and mighty and
[1:05:44] can conquer Satan anytime anyplace
[1:05:46] anywhere amen
[1:05:48] so God's weapons weren't working on
[1:05:50] brother branham as he and Billy power
[1:05:52] driving back from meetings and he
[1:05:55] finally got victory over that complex no
[1:05:57] I'm not gonna go out the wilderness and
[1:05:58] leave God's people
[1:05:59] I'll go preach them whether they reject
[1:06:01] me or not whether they accept me because
[1:06:02] I've got apostolic foundations I've got
[1:06:04] apostolic gifts amen oh thank you lord
[1:06:09] so see you can have this great wall but
[1:06:12] then Satan will try to get you off and
[1:06:14] he'll try to build up a stronghold of
[1:06:16] Complex in your life see so the word
[1:06:23] stronghold is when you got you got your
[1:06:25] own opinion you you're so opinionated
[1:06:27] and it's the wrong opinion now I can say
[1:06:30] the Amen of this - I've had I've had
[1:06:31] complexes right you've had complexes you
[1:06:34] think you're right you are so sure
[1:06:36] you're right
[1:06:37] the Ramblas were so sure they didn't
[1:06:40] want to hear his preaching but then
[1:06:42] there was people all around the world
[1:06:43] like you and I that had to hear it amen
[1:06:45] maybe we would love to hear it amen and
[1:06:48] so brother had to overcome that and get
[1:06:51] rid of his opinion and let God
[1:06:53] administer God's opinion to him see and
[1:06:59] then men
[1:07:00] Paul rebuked Peter for building again
[1:07:03] the complex that I use Peter used to
[1:07:05] have a complex toward Gentiles before he
[1:07:07] got filled with all the ghosts but then
[1:07:09] after Satan built that complex up again
[1:07:12] where he wouldn't even eat
[1:07:13] he was discriminating against the
[1:07:15] Gentiles and Paul said for if I build
[1:07:18] again the things which I destroyed I
[1:07:20] make myself a transgressor you can have
[1:07:23] this wall of a statue of man but then
[1:07:25] still transgress God's commandment by
[1:07:28] building up a dwelling place for Satan
[1:07:31] right the Bible said neither give place
[1:07:33] to the devil and that's in your mind
[1:07:35] don't give Satan a place in your mind
[1:07:37] amen no no is this helpful Church I hope
[1:07:42] it is Peter was building a great complex
[1:07:45] but see this is how you and I build we
[1:07:48] pray about things we pray about our
[1:07:52] complexes we pray about those who
[1:07:54] persecute us that speak evil things
[1:07:57] against us we pray for people that we
[1:08:00] don't see in church right we pray for
[1:08:03] them we pray for our loved ones that
[1:08:05] seem like they're never going to be safe
[1:08:06] we've got to pray and build up our faith
[1:08:09] in the Holy Ghost right well Satan will
[1:08:14] make us hopeless well they'll never be
[1:08:15] saved I'll never get the victory uh-oh
[1:08:18] that says that's a devil stronghold
[1:08:20] that's a devil castle and you're landing
[1:08:22] you got to catch that now by the weapons
[1:08:25] of God stewey bill
[1:08:28] our faith pray pray about it have you
[1:08:31] prayed about it right that's what I want
[1:08:32] ask myself the Holy Spirit last me have
[1:08:34] you prayed about have you build up a
[1:08:37] great protection against Satan have you
[1:08:39] built that up because remember the Bible
[1:08:42] says so building it up means to have
[1:08:45] constant increase so our prayers
[1:08:47] constantly increase our faith and
[1:08:51] remember he said I commend you Paul says
[1:08:53] he's leaving Ephesus and he says the
[1:08:56] word I commend you to God by the word of
[1:08:58] His grace which is able to build you up
[1:09:00] so see you hear the word of God here you
[1:09:03] take it home and you pray about it and
[1:09:05] it builds you up the rest of the week
[1:09:06] amen oh yeah right this word is able to
[1:09:11] build you up if you receive it and then
[1:09:14] be prayerful about it Lord you've led
[1:09:17] the pastor to preach on this so many
[1:09:18] times or numerous times Lord help help
[1:09:22] this to be built into my life brother
[1:09:25] preach to you put a half on job and a
[1:09:29] year and a half on the corruption I
[1:09:30] don't know if my long I don't think I
[1:09:32] heard pre-show Series that long maybe
[1:09:33] you're not even think so no some of the
[1:09:36] people got like brother and said they
[1:09:37] got little impatient with him Wednesday
[1:09:39] they got little impatient with job on
[1:09:41] the ash heap BAM you ever gonna get job
[1:09:43] out off the ash heap and though the Holy
[1:09:45] Spirit was leading him to get the people
[1:09:47] in desperation I'm in desperation I'm on
[1:09:50] the ash heap what hope is there for me
[1:09:52] and then he preached and he said I know
[1:09:54] my redeemer liveth amen and brother have
[1:09:57] said every seer in the church got saved
[1:09:59] so see there's a purpose for dwelling on
[1:10:02] something the purposes of set God's
[1:10:04] people free amen
[1:10:06] meditate on something dwell on it pray
[1:10:09] about it until the people's faith did
[1:10:11] build up and you can receive that
[1:10:12] promise that's why we take series on
[1:10:16] these things and we labor on them we go
[1:10:19] over them again so the people will have
[1:10:20] it on their minds they'll pray about it
[1:10:22] at home and they'll go I always say God
[1:10:25] build my faith up so I can receive this
[1:10:27] hey man that's right and I remember if
[1:10:32] believers being built up by God make up
[1:10:35] a building so you're part of two
[1:10:37] spiritual building processes right now
[1:10:39] you are being built up you are being
[1:10:41] built up and
[1:10:42] if you're getting built up you're part
[1:10:44] of God's building of the Bride of Christ
[1:10:46] hey man I'm a part of two building
[1:10:49] construction projects right now right
[1:10:52] usually got to get a permit and thank
[1:10:54] God on when I got saved I gave God the
[1:10:56] permit built on my land build my that's
[1:11:00] right we got a good permission to build
[1:11:02] on our house or something like that oh
[1:11:03] well I gave God full permission Billy
[1:11:05] whatever you want as much construction
[1:11:07] as you want break it over just build me
[1:11:10] into a real Christian you have my
[1:11:13] permission Lord
[1:11:15] uh-huh thank God I'm glad I gave
[1:11:18] permission sister Connie to build me up
[1:11:19] he sure has broken me down sometimes but
[1:11:22] he sure has built me up as well that
[1:11:26] Potter's hand we sang about amen call me
[1:11:29] break me Mommy shake me build me up in
[1:11:32] the stature of a real Christian okay now
[1:11:37] we're back so yeah I just wanna throw
[1:11:39] those this could remind you I thought my
[1:11:41] so strange the Holy Spirit had me preach
[1:11:42] on walls Oh three or four times
[1:11:45] levan said see if you say methodist
[1:11:48] that's just a blasphemous name he's
[1:11:51] talking about walled cities remember you
[1:11:53] have to redeem the walled have to redeem
[1:11:55] it if not you die you die inside that
[1:11:58] wall see he said that's just a
[1:12:01] blasphemous name we can say amen to that
[1:12:03] but brother let me ask you something
[1:12:05] what about Pentecost Church this is in
[1:12:07] November 1962 before the seals were open
[1:12:10] and notice brother Branham is applying
[1:12:12] the word to his day right he's not just
[1:12:17] hammering on Methodists or Baptists he's
[1:12:20] hammering on the message of his day
[1:12:23] right it's it's in his day it's in his
[1:12:27] time period his life time so what about
[1:12:29] the message churches that's why we've
[1:12:31] got to take everything brother Branham
[1:12:33] preaches and apply it to today right it
[1:12:38] has c.c. brother man was a true prophet
[1:12:40] he took the word all the old tell you
[1:12:43] takes the Old Testament scripture
[1:12:44] Leviticus 25 of all scriptures are 2225
[1:12:48] and he applies it to us here applied to
[1:12:53] them in the Pentecostal age before the
[1:12:55] message
[1:12:55] been given the seals right so we do the
[1:13:00] same thing today so I'm gonna finish
[1:13:01] this quote so here's what I already
[1:13:04] showed well Bram said if it's not a
[1:13:07] born-again experience it's still a
[1:13:11] blasphemous name patterned after the
[1:13:15] beginning so if the Baptist's are not
[1:13:20] trying to push people to be born again
[1:13:22] now not speaking tongues just be born
[1:13:24] again they might speak in tongues they
[1:13:26] might shout they might weep they might
[1:13:27] rejoice
[1:13:28] they might scream they might dance
[1:13:30] whatever you do something's gonna happen
[1:13:32] if you get the Holy Ghost if you get
[1:13:35] burned with fire something's gonna
[1:13:36] happen you're gonna feel it right like
[1:13:41] on the day of Pentecost they knew
[1:13:42] something happened there was fire so
[1:13:44] they run out rejoicing it was noise
[1:13:46] there was noise it was noised abroad the
[1:13:48] wonderful works of God they're saying
[1:13:50] God is that wonderful things and it got
[1:13:52] noised abroad they knew something
[1:13:54] happened those people they thought they
[1:13:55] were drunk right and so if if we are not
[1:14:00] patterning off a Pentecost
[1:14:03] it's a blasphemy so if message churches
[1:14:07] just like Pentecostal just like Lutheran
[1:14:09] Catholic if we're not trying to get
[1:14:12] people to be born again then we blast
[1:14:14] we're just a blasphemous name think
[1:14:17] about that Bride of Christ fellowship
[1:14:19] can be a blasphemy to God unless we're
[1:14:22] trying to get people to be born again
[1:14:23] the Holy Ghost amen amen
[1:14:27] that's a whole desire is to see people
[1:14:30] not just saying we appreciate you know
[1:14:32] water baptisms not just sanctified but
[1:14:35] filled with the Holy Ghost amen
[1:14:38] and now you and I know most people
[1:14:41] around the message they just get
[1:14:43] justified hardly holier anybody gets
[1:14:45] sanctified because if they were
[1:14:48] sanctified they wouldn't let no evil
[1:14:50] coming from their eyes right
[1:14:53] they'd have virtue knowledge temperance
[1:14:56] patience goddess and that people get so
[1:14:58] impatient with you that they'll blasting
[1:15:02] your name or they'll call you a call you
[1:15:07] a backslider you know when you're trying
[1:15:09] to stand on the
[1:15:09] right so they starts it most people
[1:15:12] start sanctification but don't finish
[1:15:15] and then how many fewer people actually
[1:15:17] get born again where the power of God is
[1:15:20] on their life and people can see it and
[1:15:23] then you're so dedicated so faithful to
[1:15:26] Christ people know you're just not like
[1:15:28] a wonder in the house of God you are a
[1:15:30] pillar in the house of God amen jesus
[1:15:34] said if you can overcome I'm gonna make
[1:15:36] you a pillar in the house of my god amen
[1:15:39] glory you won't hate going to church you
[1:15:43] won't be late for church you won't do
[1:15:44] all these things have you got a job and
[1:15:46] things we understand right but what I'm
[1:15:49] saying is that you will be sowing fire
[1:15:51] for God
[1:15:52] you'll love God you love everything
[1:15:53] about God you love his people you'll
[1:15:55] give to his people you'll foetus people
[1:15:58] you'll do anything you can because you
[1:16:00] love God and you love his church so he
[1:16:02] makes you a pillar they're amen amen
[1:16:06] never Peter said Peter said if judgment
[1:16:11] begins I hide the house of God he's not
[1:16:13] talking about heaven he's talking about
[1:16:15] a church but how much fewer people will
[1:16:19] be saved out there how scarce will be
[1:16:21] some people saved out that don't come to
[1:16:22] church mercy see they don't know another
[1:16:29] they don't know fellowship all they know
[1:16:30] is their Creed they're just settled down
[1:16:33] like some kind of Lodge like lodges now
[1:16:36] that's what we don't want to become we
[1:16:37] don't wanna become a lodge remember
[1:16:40] Abraham said they're stages to the
[1:16:41] Antichrist spirit so we should we have a
[1:16:43] look at our church and look at our lives
[1:16:45] and say as our church any of these three
[1:16:47] stages LeBaron says not three different
[1:16:49] I Christ spirits it's the one Antichrist
[1:16:52] spirit that works progressively just
[1:16:53] like God's Spirit works progressively
[1:16:57] see brother man said the deeds of
[1:16:59] Nicolaitans the doctrine of balaam
[1:17:01] teaching the false prophet Jezebel do
[1:17:03] not constitute three spirits or make
[1:17:04] three spiritual principles these three
[1:17:07] are but the various manifestations of
[1:17:09] the same spirit as it goes from depth to
[1:17:11] depth now catch this this is we're
[1:17:14] getting out here to the the main part
[1:17:16] here that was all warm up
[1:17:21] everybody feel warm everybody's sweating
[1:17:23] spiritually feeling good exercise your
[1:17:25] your faith muscles or exercise your
[1:17:27] buddy feeling good now I'm starting
[1:17:29] working out really for sure right here
[1:17:31] what is it all they had a Christ spirit
[1:17:33] an organization the various strangers
[1:17:35] once the clergy separated themselves
[1:17:37] that's the first thing the preacher
[1:17:40] separate themselves as more holy than
[1:17:42] everybody else and the people let him do
[1:17:46] it
[1:17:46] see so we can't put all the blame on the
[1:17:49] preachers because if a preacher
[1:17:51] separates himself I'm more holy than you
[1:17:53] then you got to vote them out so you
[1:17:57] have just as much you and I had just as
[1:17:59] much responsibility before God as anyone
[1:18:01] whether a preacher or not right there's
[1:18:04] just the leaders which means they're
[1:18:05] more responsibility more accountability
[1:18:07] on the day of judgment now look look
[1:18:12] what this Antichrist spirit produces
[1:18:14] that's why every service is so critical
[1:18:17] to be in the house of God ritual and
[1:18:19] ceremony was given an increasing part in
[1:18:22] worship so when the Antichrist spirit
[1:18:24] started progressing the preacher
[1:18:27] separated themselves they're too holy
[1:18:29] they have all the holiness they're the
[1:18:31] ones that turn the bread into the body
[1:18:33] of Christ the wine into the literal
[1:18:36] blood of Christ no nope and pretty soon
[1:18:41] it's all the same thing ritual say it's
[1:18:44] the same routine over and over again
[1:18:45] that's what the Antichrist spirit does
[1:18:48] and I'm not going to go much further on
[1:18:50] that quote but this is the one I would
[1:18:51] look at remind you again
[1:18:53] they're with me Satan stars with deeds
[1:18:57] of the Nicolaitans which program says
[1:18:59] these are harmless anti word traditions
[1:19:02] people just get a tradition they just
[1:19:05] start little traditions that aren't in
[1:19:07] the Word of God like the example of our
[1:19:08] RAM gave in those Church ages was with
[1:19:10] sprinkling babies that was never in the
[1:19:12] Word of God it was just one of these
[1:19:14] little small little anti word practices
[1:19:17] and now for us it might be well you
[1:19:21] believe God sent a prophet or you've
[1:19:24] already got the Holy Ghost you're
[1:19:26] already saved no that's not true anybody
[1:19:30] can recognize God sent a prophet demons
[1:19:32] recognize Jesus was the Christ the
[1:19:34] Messiah
[1:19:34] [Applause]
[1:19:36] Judah stood right there Peter said we
[1:19:38] all believe and assure you're the Christ
[1:19:40] you're the Messiah Judah saw Judas think
[1:19:43] of all the miracles Judah saw I was
[1:19:44] thinking about that this morning think
[1:19:46] of all the miracles he saw him to calm
[1:19:48] the sea Judah saw that he saw Jesus here
[1:19:52] the lepers he saw paralyzed people rise
[1:19:55] up so church that I'll encourage you if
[1:19:57] you haven't seen miracles like that yet
[1:19:59] you still believe blessed are you
[1:20:02] because jesus said blessed are you if
[1:20:04] you haven't seen yet you believe and
[1:20:09] he'd seen so much sister Karen he seen
[1:20:11] so much down through the years towards
[1:20:13] the end he's like he said Santa he
[1:20:17] 'tried let me get this straight if you
[1:20:19] give me 30 pieces of silver all's I got
[1:20:22] to do is tell you where Jesus at I can
[1:20:24] make a few bucks off Jesus I've carried
[1:20:28] you know a Treasury his Treasury is kind
[1:20:29] of low you don't have much money in
[1:20:30] there but I can make a little money on
[1:20:32] the side but I just compromise on the
[1:20:35] message a little bit I could I could
[1:20:36] make a pretty good deal here he'd seen
[1:20:39] so much supernatural that it became
[1:20:42] common to him and the church said think
[1:20:46] can you can you imagine that church he
[1:20:48] had have seen Lazarus raised from the
[1:20:50] dead he had to seen that they're all
[1:20:51] there and yet he still saw this
[1:20:56] attraction what was more popular what
[1:20:58] was more exciting in his eyes the
[1:20:59] preaching of Jesus or money can you can
[1:21:04] you imagine that and we've got to be
[1:21:06] careful and see that his anything
[1:21:07] happens today people will leave Church
[1:21:09] leaves a message just for a beautiful
[1:21:11] girl or a handsome guy with white teeth
[1:21:16] ching and a fancy haircut or money right
[1:21:22] a high paying job they'll leave the
[1:21:24] things of God or a bigger house or if
[1:21:27] you answer your car they'll leave God
[1:21:30] from that well God is you know these
[1:21:32] things are the same yesterday today and
[1:21:34] forever right all these things are the
[1:21:35] same so he starts by saying all the pre
[1:21:39] you can only have miracles if brother
[1:21:40] Jesse's really really anointed that's
[1:21:42] not true if I come in here and I'm
[1:21:44] fighting for my spiritual life and I've
[1:21:45] gone through hell and high water and I
[1:21:47] try to struggle you
[1:21:49] if you're anointed you can still go lay
[1:21:51] your hands on the sick and they shall
[1:21:52] recover they don't have to come through
[1:21:55] me Church it comes through any anointed
[1:21:57] part of the body of Jesus Christ unit
[1:22:01] you can't think that I can't think that
[1:22:03] I can't think well if people don't come
[1:22:06] up here that nothing happened I can't
[1:22:07] think that I've been guilty of that I'm
[1:22:10] honest I'll be my mother if they grow up
[1:22:13] nobody came up for prayer then God
[1:22:14] didn't move that's not true at all see
[1:22:17] God can move but see we can't make it a
[1:22:20] tradition right we can't let little
[1:22:23] traditions come in we've got to make
[1:22:25] sure everybody's got the holiness of God
[1:22:27] on them because the whole point of this
[1:22:30] is to do what kill them with spiritual
[1:22:32] death where it's all ritual I've been to
[1:22:34] a Catholic funeral couple months ago
[1:22:36] it's all ritual there's nothing
[1:22:38] spontaneous there's nothing supernatural
[1:22:40] there's nothing like that going on
[1:22:42] there's no excitement in there's no
[1:22:44] faith there's there's no other thing
[1:22:45] like that but we ought to have faith
[1:22:47] that God's here and all things are
[1:22:49] possible but if we let little traditions
[1:22:53] come in well there's no guest preacher I
[1:22:55] guess God's not going to move today or
[1:22:57] brother or sister so-and-so is out so it
[1:23:00] that's impossible for God to speak in a
[1:23:02] tongue or it's not we must remember that
[1:23:04] all things are possible we must look to
[1:23:06] God we must have expectation we must be
[1:23:09] built up in faith praying in the Holy
[1:23:10] Ghost now you see why this is important
[1:23:15] because Eve all we are Church goes
[1:23:16] through seasons every church goes
[1:23:18] through seasons writes that the sister
[1:23:19] Karen's laughing we I'm laughing too we
[1:23:23] are every Church goes through seasons
[1:23:25] are we building up building up our faith
[1:23:28] expecting God to move more are we
[1:23:31] getting traditional and ritualistic is
[1:23:35] the fire growing or is the fire are you
[1:23:38] trying to fan to get this thing alive
[1:23:40] come on somebody throws throws throw
[1:23:43] something in there anything or is it
[1:23:47] burning and you can feel the wood than
[1:23:49] the fire of God everybody loves God the
[1:23:51] glory go God can do great things today
[1:23:56] oh there yeah and this is the wall
[1:24:01] brother Rams talking about message
[1:24:03] churches can be blaspheming the name of
[1:24:05] God just as much as the Luther I'm not
[1:24:08] attacking message churches I love I love
[1:24:10] messenger you know I love them I love
[1:24:12] the message nothing I love more than the
[1:24:14] message but they they can be tempted and
[1:24:18] fall away just like any other Church
[1:24:20] it's the responsibility of not just the
[1:24:23] preacher because that that's an
[1:24:25] antichrist idea well it's all up to the
[1:24:27] pastor as long as the pastor's study
[1:24:28] we're gonna have a good service no you
[1:24:29] gotta study too
[1:24:30] the man said I can be just as a nought
[1:24:33] he said I can pray and build up my faith
[1:24:35] but if I come in there and the people
[1:24:37] haven't don't have the same anointing he
[1:24:38] said nothing's gonna happen and I wish I
[1:24:42] had that quote in front of me cuz I'd
[1:24:43] show it to you but just kind of came to
[1:24:45] me as a reminder the man said I can pray
[1:24:48] and get myself so anointed but if the
[1:24:49] people don't have the same anointing
[1:24:50] God's not gonna move thank you lord
[1:24:55] now what is it advance to after that
[1:24:57] Balaam was false unity oh where does all
[1:25:01] the message churches are all the same
[1:25:03] we're just all the same and the
[1:25:06] shittiest this member he let them commit
[1:25:08] fornication so that was oh it's okay to
[1:25:10] do this it's okay to act like this
[1:25:11] during courtship or it's okay to do this
[1:25:13] during marriage and that's okay you know
[1:25:15] you're not married you can do this you
[1:25:16] know sexual sins it's okay to marry
[1:25:18] twice three times four times see this is
[1:25:21] what it advances to it starts as small
[1:25:23] but then it gets greater evils greater
[1:25:27] false doctrine usually it's sexual sin
[1:25:29] it's not always starts as physical sin
[1:25:31] but then it gets into sexual because
[1:25:33] that was a very foreign a that was a
[1:25:35] fornication feast and then lastly turns
[1:25:39] into false prophecy people will listen
[1:25:40] to false prophets seducing spirits and
[1:25:43] death
[1:25:44] it ends with spiritual death they've
[1:25:46] crossed the line they haven't redeemed
[1:25:48] what was theirs amen
[1:25:50] they haven't bought it back they haven't
[1:25:52] redeemed it and we got to be careful now
[1:25:56] does everyone understand why that's so
[1:25:57] important because we're they're going to
[1:26:00] go
[1:26:01] really gonna go the way of the holy
[1:26:02] ghost bride and get more on fire for God
[1:26:05] or Satan's gonna try to cool this church
[1:26:07] off you know gotta pray you don't got to
[1:26:12] seek God you have to pull on the word of
[1:26:14] God but the RAM said that's saying SiC
[1:26:15] them to the devil you want the devil to
[1:26:18] be here or you want to get that devil up
[1:26:19] in the tree I'm gonna get that devil up
[1:26:22] in the tree so I cut the tree down and
[1:26:23] killed the devil amen
[1:26:25] you gotta back arkinson amen get away
[1:26:29] devil get away get away from us
[1:26:32] we want to be free we want God to reign
[1:26:34] in our church our God reigns amen
[1:26:37] see it's so critical and if we don't do
[1:26:40] that then Satan's gonna have a place
[1:26:43] right in the church so C but the RAM
[1:26:49] uses no no we see the personal walls
[1:26:52] that we build up but brother Branham is
[1:26:54] talking about the organizational wall
[1:26:55] that this represents it's got to be
[1:26:58] redeemed if it's behind that wall it's
[1:27:00] got to be redeemed or if not if you
[1:27:02] don't redeem it then it's gonna be
[1:27:03] organized organized and cut off let me
[1:27:06] go through some quotes here these are
[1:27:08] different quotes not about the Jubilee
[1:27:10] look brother when you drop down to the
[1:27:12] end of this life life journey you'll
[1:27:14] wish you had lived a wholly clean life
[1:27:16] when you face God be sure to remember
[1:27:18] that now about your church what you
[1:27:20] belong to that doesn't mean nothing to
[1:27:21] God it's what you are in your heart
[1:27:22] that's right God ain't gonna ask you
[1:27:24] whether what church you belong to it's
[1:27:26] what you are in your heart is what God
[1:27:28] is going to look at so it's what you are
[1:27:32] in your heart right now he said listen
[1:27:35] friends don't try to depend and seek
[1:27:36] sensations instead rely upon realities
[1:27:39] not sensation shoutings all right I love
[1:27:43] to shout I've shouted so much my throat
[1:27:44] hurts but that don't mean nothing
[1:27:47] speaking in tongues is all right praise
[1:27:48] the Lord's all right faith for miracles
[1:27:50] is all right all these things in those
[1:27:51] feelings sometimes say oh I felt it like
[1:27:53] a rushing mighty wind another one said I
[1:27:55] felt fire my soul what that doesn't make
[1:27:58] it right either way it's what you are
[1:28:00] after you've received it god bless for
[1:28:05] the vain good to see you sir
[1:28:06] hey Lily
[1:28:08] he said see that's what counts see so
[1:28:10] you can't pin it to any sensation
[1:28:12] relevant says that and serves as the
[1:28:13] endtime the Holy Ghost without sensation
[1:28:15] you can't make it one sensation you've
[1:28:17] got to speak in tongues you have got to
[1:28:20] shout like brother songs or scream like
[1:28:22] sister so if you don't scream like
[1:28:24] sisters don't you didn't get it it's not
[1:28:26] that you can't make it but you but
[1:28:28] rather later says you got to have a
[1:28:30] sensation but you can't make it one
[1:28:32] certain sensation whatever God wants to
[1:28:34] do when he feels you let God do it amen
[1:28:37] you'll know it because his spirits over
[1:28:40] it's running over you you feel so good
[1:28:41] you just yield to it and it'll take you
[1:28:43] every you need to go hey the reality of
[1:28:48] God comes after you say you got it watch
[1:28:53] the next week after you got it watch the
[1:28:55] next month after you got it watch the
[1:28:56] next year after you say you got it that
[1:28:58] will prove the reality of Jesus Christ
[1:29:01] in your daily life proves whether you
[1:29:04] receive them or not
[1:29:05] [Music]
[1:29:10] now if you want to speak an unknown
[1:29:12] tongue I think I'll let you do that
[1:29:13] but according to scripture you're still
[1:29:15] nothing until the Holy Spirit comes and
[1:29:16] I've asked God to speak in tongues and
[1:29:17] you won't let me so I said okay maybe in
[1:29:19] the future but see all that would do
[1:29:22] Church with it would just edify me I see
[1:29:25] people do it sometimes I mean that's so
[1:29:26] easy for them how do they do that but
[1:29:28] then they probably at me and say how do
[1:29:30] you preach up there like that right it's
[1:29:32] a gift I just get in the channel I pray
[1:29:35] fast in the channel and God preaches
[1:29:36] through me well they pray again the
[1:29:38] channel God speaks in tongues through
[1:29:39] them I should get jealous and say man I
[1:29:41] wish I'm gonna try really hard I just
[1:29:43] gotta I just got a stutter more pretty
[1:29:46] soon it'll come no no you got a draw
[1:29:51] draw nigh to God and God will draw nigh
[1:29:53] to you he said then after the Holy
[1:29:58] Spirit comes then you can speak in
[1:29:59] tongues God will just take the nature
[1:30:01] that you are and cut it off for you and
[1:30:03] make you the best servant you can be so
[1:30:08] after you the Holy Ghost God wants to
[1:30:09] make you a servant now my service is
[1:30:12] very easy for 13 years I've served the
[1:30:14] church whether I'm song leader prep
[1:30:16] pastor treasurer deacon summer
[1:30:20] sunday-school superintendent
[1:30:22] sunday-school teacher you name it I
[1:30:23] don't have enough fingers for all the
[1:30:24] roles I do here but that's a I just say
[1:30:27] that funny not exalt myself but it's
[1:30:29] just funny to me but I have to be a
[1:30:32] servant right so if God did fill me with
[1:30:34] the Holy Ghost my life afterwards proved
[1:30:37] did I serve God's purpose on this earth
[1:30:40] because he saved me for purpose he gave
[1:30:44] me power for a purpose and that's what
[1:30:46] you and I are say - he gives you power
[1:30:49] the Holy Ghost for a powerful ministry
[1:30:55] he might make you preach the gospel he
[1:30:59] might give you a gift of speaking in
[1:31:02] tongues he might make you a prophet he
[1:31:03] might give you spirit of prophecy it's
[1:31:05] hard telling what he'd do for you I love
[1:31:07] that or he might do all those things for
[1:31:10] you but the first thing to do is be sure
[1:31:12] that by one not sensation by one spirit
[1:31:15] we're all baptized in that body and then
[1:31:19] then the gifts come from that body
[1:31:22] speaking in tongues and everything now
[1:31:24] that's where I want to get to in the
[1:31:25] purpose series once I get done with
[1:31:26] these 14 seasons I want everybody to
[1:31:28] pray and we'll preach on it and then see
[1:31:31] God what gifts are my life because
[1:31:33] whatever gifts are in your life you're
[1:31:34] accountable for those gifts the gifts
[1:31:36] and callings of God were already there
[1:31:38] before you repented because the gifts
[1:31:40] and callings of God are without
[1:31:41] repentance and I want you and I to know
[1:31:45] we need to know what God's called us to
[1:31:48] do because that's a revelation of the
[1:31:50] will of God for our lives and I'd like
[1:31:54] you to tell me what your gift is that I
[1:31:56] can pray for you too and then you can
[1:31:57] pray for me
[1:31:58] praise God think about that let's say
[1:32:02] your gift is tongues and you you're kind
[1:32:04] of wondering whether it is and you've
[1:32:05] seen it opera think about if you devoted
[1:32:08] 30 minutes a day to praying God use my
[1:32:10] gift God use my gift God what could
[1:32:12] happen on Sunday morning after you pray
[1:32:14] seven days about that all right
[1:32:16] you got to get the wisdom god bless my
[1:32:19] bless this gift use this gift anoint me
[1:32:22] anoint me and you pray seven days up
[1:32:24] that's what I do for preaching God
[1:32:25] anoint me I don't you and then here you
[1:32:27] get to hear the word of God what what
[1:32:31] could God do if we are all dedicated and
[1:32:33] focused on doing what God's called us to
[1:32:35] I think see more of God don't you
[1:32:40] I do Church I do I'll be loved all my
[1:32:44] heart now but when this King is how
[1:32:48] about Uzziah God took place being such a
[1:32:51] great man and influencing Isaiah and the
[1:32:54] righteous of course of his kingdom he
[1:32:56] got to a place he got feeling self
[1:32:57] secured now this is something I gotta
[1:33:00] watch out because I've been here 13
[1:33:01] years I got to make sure I don't get
[1:33:02] secured all like nothing could touch me
[1:33:04] I always be the pastor here huh I don't
[1:33:07] have to worry so much about what I say I
[1:33:08] can't get like that that's pride and
[1:33:11] there's where you make your mistake
[1:33:13] there's where so many righteous men look
[1:33:15] at this bite the dust of shame like a
[1:33:19] surfer about eating dust right but ma'am
[1:33:22] said preachers will bite the dust of
[1:33:24] shame
[1:33:24] so the in other words they'll get
[1:33:27] they'll fall so low they'll be eating
[1:33:28] snakes food dust preacher used to be so
[1:33:32] exhausted so anointed but they make one
[1:33:34] mistake and they can be bite and dust
[1:33:36] right down there by Satan
[1:33:38] disgraced by the dust of defeat is
[1:33:45] because they begin to feel self secure
[1:33:48] you begin to think that you have lived
[1:33:50] so long for Christ no matter what he
[1:33:52] presents before you you'll take your
[1:33:54] choice whether you want it or not so God
[1:33:57] gives you a choice and God says you need
[1:33:59] to do this but you say it's okay I've
[1:34:01] been doing this long enough I can go
[1:34:02] this way
[1:34:03] I can do this it's okay I've sure got
[1:34:05] all these years I'm above that I'm a
[1:34:09] more message I'm more mature mastered
[1:34:11] believer then brother sister so and so I
[1:34:13] can do whatever I want
[1:34:15] that's not the right attitude to have he
[1:34:19] said you've got to continue to serve God
[1:34:20] no matter what you was back ten years
[1:34:22] ago it's what you are right now and the
[1:34:25] church said what were you 10 years ago
[1:34:28] something you weren't even saved thank
[1:34:30] god you're not what you used to be but
[1:34:32] for those of us have been long around I
[1:34:34] mean this year be 20 years I was saved
[1:34:39] you know eight
[1:34:41] years I've heard the message I got look
[1:34:43] at my life ten years ago what was my
[1:34:44] life ten years ago in 2009 well
[1:34:46] thankfully I can go back and listen what
[1:34:47] my life was ten years ago because we
[1:34:49] recorded all the sermons I always tell
[1:34:51] my stories you know and I've done that I
[1:34:54] would know some sermons from a few years
[1:34:55] ago trying to get thoughts about statue
[1:34:58] for man and I was like wow I was pretty
[1:35:01] zealous I preached hour forty-five
[1:35:02] minutes
[1:35:03] that's right when Karen and Laura
[1:35:05] started covered they love me they put up
[1:35:07] with me well not really well they love
[1:35:09] me but they love God more the reason
[1:35:10] they the reason they love me is because
[1:35:12] they love God but see we have to make
[1:35:16] sure we're not in a worse condition than
[1:35:18] we were ten years ago if we are if we
[1:35:24] are in a worse condition pride is
[1:35:26] entered certainly pride because there's
[1:35:28] no contention with unless pride the
[1:35:30] Bible said so when you if you have a
[1:35:33] contention against God what is it it's
[1:35:34] pride contention against a brother
[1:35:36] assistance church it's pride it's always
[1:35:38] pride my way my way
[1:35:39] my opinions are right so what kind of
[1:35:44] Christian were you this week about last
[1:35:46] night what kind of Christian were you
[1:35:48] last night
[1:35:49] because you and I can't live off what we
[1:35:52] were what are we right now if we don't
[1:35:56] check up every hour then we're gonna go
[1:35:59] down the road of cooling off and
[1:36:01] potentially could have you could fall
[1:36:03] off the statue of a perfect man that's
[1:36:05] scriptural Peter fell off he was so high
[1:36:08] up there ma he was being so good but he
[1:36:11] fell off right before Jesus he got
[1:36:13] knocked off all the way down
[1:36:14] he lost his virtue he couldn't stand up
[1:36:16] to a woman right a little maid girl at
[1:36:18] the the high priests house he couldn't
[1:36:20] have enough virtue to say I believe I
[1:36:22] know Jesus Christ he did I'm not virtue
[1:36:23] but Jesus said I prayed for you that
[1:36:25] your faith fail not amen
[1:36:28] Jesus one of that is faith get knocked
[1:36:30] away cuz then he'd be lost but Jesus and
[1:36:32] I prayed that your foundation will stand
[1:36:34] even though everything falls off you're
[1:36:36] wrong you'll have your foundation you're
[1:36:38] gonna be saved Peter a mad you just got
[1:36:41] to be humbled a little bit before the
[1:36:44] Holy Ghost can come right then he got
[1:36:47] built up with after 40 days of the
[1:36:49] resurrection for 50 days after the
[1:36:50] resurrection he got built back up where
[1:36:51] he could be capped off with the Holy
[1:36:52] Ghost see God can do a great word
[1:36:54] really fast uh uh and see Church are we
[1:37:01] seeking God for more of his spirit
[1:37:02] because you're either gonna get your
[1:37:04] either get closer to God or get further
[1:37:06] away from God today
[1:37:09] did you see God for today's Ministry of
[1:37:12] the Holy Ghost did you receive Lord I'm
[1:37:14] going there and this is a carnivore fest
[1:37:16] right this is a this is a meal at the
[1:37:19] house of God and Lord just prepare the
[1:37:21] meat that I want to feast on all of it
[1:37:23] help me to have a heart how many be
[1:37:25] hungry so I can feast on God's Word
[1:37:27] because 9 out of 10 chances are you woke
[1:37:30] up and the flesh just like I did how
[1:37:32] many people woke up in the flesh and
[1:37:33] didn't you know tired who didn't what
[1:37:36] we're thinking about God sometimes we do
[1:37:37] that and you've got to crucify that man
[1:37:42] right you got to die daily and choose
[1:37:46] the hunger and thirst for righteousness
[1:37:48] if not Satan's take some of those bricks
[1:37:51] away oh he didn't pray he didn't pray
[1:37:53] this morning about I could yeah he takes
[1:37:56] his crowbar out that I took away there's
[1:38:01] their temperance right that's what he
[1:38:02] does right it's so true and now when
[1:38:06] they get to church instead of having
[1:38:07] temperance or self-control I think I
[1:38:09] want to step out and go buy a burger
[1:38:11] real quick we're always preaching I'm
[1:38:12] really hungry
[1:38:13] you see I've ever gotten a man who
[1:38:17] smoked a little bit smoked here I have
[1:38:18] to finish the sermon now that's that's
[1:38:22] an extreme example but they do it we've
[1:38:25] had brothers and you know them they used
[1:38:26] to come here they used to step out and
[1:38:28] do some of things like that the saying
[1:38:31] that broke down all these he just tears
[1:38:35] down the Lord gets a sledgehammer all
[1:38:36] right 40 pounds
[1:38:40] there goes your virtue can you raise
[1:38:44] your hands to God because people looking
[1:38:48] at me don't want these people looking at
[1:38:49] me but if you really advert you you
[1:38:52] don't care who's here you know Christ is
[1:38:54] here
[1:38:55] you raise your hands of your creator
[1:38:57] because you know he gathers over two or
[1:39:00] three are gathered there I am in the
[1:39:01] midst of them yes so much virtue you
[1:39:04] don't care who's around but she got
[1:39:06] strength to live a godly life but see
[1:39:10] he's got a couple days go by what
[1:39:12] happens Satan's like he heat him
[1:39:15] fortified he didn't put any new bricks
[1:39:17] down there oh he does like glory to God
[1:39:19] we said go into Satan here we go oh he's
[1:39:24] all excited to tear down your wall and
[1:39:27] it happens either either way what
[1:39:29] everyday happens either one way or the
[1:39:31] other either you get more spiritual
[1:39:33] revelations oh that was glorious
[1:39:34] preaching day and we've had Aaron come
[1:39:37] in Aaron's he's young right he's new
[1:39:39] with us so Aaron will text me sometimes
[1:39:41] or that was a great chord about you know
[1:39:43] pastors and the oil line and see what is
[1:39:45] he doing he's bill he's putting stuff
[1:39:47] each revelation on there it's getting
[1:39:49] pretty high in it brother now you really
[1:39:52] like that right and so he's got a whip
[1:39:54] to deep noon that but that's I love
[1:39:55] about new people you can see they're
[1:39:57] they're they're they're wall building
[1:39:59] the more they feed on the word the more
[1:40:01] they come to church the more they pray
[1:40:02] pretty soon they got a real huh real
[1:40:04] high wall amen
[1:40:05] and there ain't no devil getting in
[1:40:07] there amen but you and I have to make
[1:40:11] sure we build the wall and fortify it
[1:40:13] through all the days of our life we've
[1:40:17] got to redeem that whatever you've lost
[1:40:19] you've got you better get it back don't
[1:40:22] let him don't let it go into nomination
[1:40:23] or hands ah don't let go into the
[1:40:26] Satan's Antichrist spirit hands you've
[1:40:28] got to redeem it get it back quick get
[1:40:32] it back quick remember Jesus told
[1:40:34] Ephesus you better get your first love
[1:40:36] back or I'm taking the candlestick out
[1:40:39] of here
[1:40:39] I better have said he did all the Holy
[1:40:42] Ghost preachers were out of there within
[1:40:43] 20 years after Paul left in acts 20 it
[1:40:48] wasn't about 20 years and the whole all
[1:40:50] the Christian population was gone out of
[1:40:51] Ephesus because they got they got lazy
[1:40:54] on God they didn't come to see God
[1:40:56] anymore in church services they just
[1:40:59] come you know because it's fun ritual
[1:41:01] you know we do this this is the
[1:41:05] highlight of our life should be coming
[1:41:06] to church it should be
[1:41:09] now let me try to close here just give
[1:41:12] me a minute let me see how many quotes I
[1:41:13] got here I want to find a logical or I
[1:41:15] should say a spirit-filled place to stop
[1:41:17] I shouldn't say logical oh why is this
[1:41:19] place to stop I got a couple more here
[1:41:21] four more okay
[1:41:24] and I've already preached about hour and
[1:41:26] ten minutes yeah let me set a timer here
[1:41:28] I'm gonna go ten more
[1:41:29] he said the King got the place where he
[1:41:31] thought himself he got lifted up his
[1:41:33] probably got in his heart and that's
[1:41:34] what happens us if you'll pardon this
[1:41:36] expression that's what happened to our
[1:41:37] churches throughout the country they're
[1:41:38] fine people in there some of the best in
[1:41:40] the world goes to church I think the
[1:41:41] best in the world goes to church but the
[1:41:43] thing of it is the organizational system
[1:41:45] gets lifted up that's what happened to
[1:41:47] the Methodists that's what happened to
[1:41:48] the Baptist that's what happened to the
[1:41:49] Nazarite Nazarene program holiness to
[1:41:52] the Pentecostal he's talking about his
[1:41:53] day and I kind of say like this that's
[1:41:56] what happens the message churches it can
[1:41:58] happen to us lift it up self-willed not
[1:42:01] God's will but self will happen that
[1:42:05] what I want to happen happens at church
[1:42:07] instead of what does God want to happen
[1:42:09] self-centered it's all about me it's not
[1:42:11] about God anymore it's all about what I
[1:42:12] want to happen pride that you can't they
[1:42:16] can't tell you nothing brother Jesse he
[1:42:18] cannot preach I've had people tell me
[1:42:20] this
[1:42:20] you don't preach anything new I've had
[1:42:22] it done tell it to my face you don't say
[1:42:24] anything new oh this is all old stuff
[1:42:26] and I'll even say to their face well
[1:42:28] this was new I never preached that and
[1:42:29] they'll change the subject you can't
[1:42:32] tell them nothing
[1:42:33] when pride gets them you can't they
[1:42:35] can't learn anymore from you because
[1:42:37] they're the they're the expert now
[1:42:40] that's what I love here in Aaron's
[1:42:42] revelation about the number 17 the bride
[1:42:44] I'd like to learn from God's people
[1:42:45] don't you I can learn I want to learn it
[1:42:48] Jose Abreu oh my a Briggs close to me
[1:42:50] all the time I'm constantly learning you
[1:42:52] know I didn't know that but see what
[1:42:55] some other pride you can't tell nothing
[1:42:57] they're going to tell you all what it's
[1:42:59] all about it's a so it's because they
[1:43:05] become so know-it-all
[1:43:07] he's ppreciate already I've already
[1:43:09] heard that it doesn't matter if you've
[1:43:11] heard it have you applied it right you
[1:43:16] can hear about your your your the one
[1:43:18] you're engaged to you can hear about the
[1:43:21] multi that's
[1:43:22] fine but have you married them do you
[1:43:23] know them right that's a rotor Hansen
[1:43:26] you got an oh Christ now I just hear
[1:43:28] about Christ you got to know him for
[1:43:30] yourself see nobody can tell them
[1:43:34] anything no more see message churches
[1:43:35] like Ivan I got a man I met a man who
[1:43:37] tell me who knew brother bread and he's
[1:43:39] passed on now but he got so cold on God
[1:43:41] from his own confession he said I've
[1:43:44] heard it all preached before and he's
[1:43:47] got so cold on God I've heard of seven
[1:43:50] thunders I hear the stuff he said I've
[1:43:51] heard it all and it was just like that
[1:43:55] they know you can't tell him anything am
[1:43:58] i building them self around reasoning
[1:44:00] they build themselves around their Creed
[1:44:01] and then they do they leave God in the
[1:44:03] back so what was that man's Crees a new
[1:44:05] brother branham the Creed is I've heard
[1:44:06] it all before I know it all so I don't
[1:44:08] need to pull on God's Word anymore I
[1:44:10] know it all it's not just who hearing
[1:44:13] it's not who about who hears the word
[1:44:15] it's about who lives the word and if
[1:44:17] you're living the word then life is
[1:44:18] exciting
[1:44:19] the Christian life is growing the
[1:44:22] Christian life is engaging the Christian
[1:44:24] life makes you want more and more not
[1:44:27] less and less right more and more I got
[1:44:31] four more that's what happens to doctors
[1:44:33] when they get so self-centered they
[1:44:34] don't need any help from God that's when
[1:44:36] I don't want what one fool with me thank
[1:44:39] God for Christian doctors right yes when
[1:44:43] you leave God or anything you I want you
[1:44:45] to leave me out see because you must
[1:44:47] because you must always remember that he
[1:44:48] got lifted up so many today you take a
[1:44:51] family of people start going to church
[1:44:53] and God will heal that little family
[1:44:55] he'll bless them and give them the Holy
[1:44:57] Spirit in their life the little children
[1:44:59] will pray around the table they'll pray
[1:45:00] before they go to bed let's say in our
[1:45:02] feet here mother and father will join
[1:45:04] hands and pray now look this this family
[1:45:07] starts out praying and serving God
[1:45:08] together and as long as they continue
[1:45:10] like that they'll stay a family so
[1:45:13] what's one of the secrets to being a
[1:45:14] Christian just faithful dedication
[1:45:16] sincere prayers in your home just pray
[1:45:19] for pray to for God to heal the home
[1:45:21] pray for God to minister in the home but
[1:45:24] Ram said oh you'll continue a family but
[1:45:26] the but you let them get the first thing
[1:45:28] you know they don't have nothing
[1:45:29] old junk car maybe riding around or
[1:45:32] maybe walking fine they'll get a good
[1:45:33] car better home and
[1:45:35] first thing you know then they want to
[1:45:37] get to what they the world cause a
[1:45:39] better class to associate with they move
[1:45:43] into a different neighborhood and in
[1:45:44] there they found out they become
[1:45:46] influenced by the wrong influence see
[1:45:50] the people you hang around with the
[1:45:52] people you associate shows what's inside
[1:45:54] your heart I'm glad to associate with
[1:45:56] you Church I'm glad I don't associate
[1:46:00] with other churches it's the church
[1:46:02] because we all believe the same thing
[1:46:05] right you must and then he he had this
[1:46:09] quote by saying you must always stay
[1:46:11] where the kingdom of God and where the
[1:46:15] glory of God is pouring out praise God
[1:46:22] stay where you can be spiritually fed
[1:46:24] day and night and the first thing you
[1:46:27] know separation come in the home
[1:46:29] wilderness and they get lifted up so see
[1:46:32] church did we feed last night did you
[1:46:33] read the Bible before you went to bed I
[1:46:35] hope we do our devotions every night I
[1:46:36] hope you do too how about this past week
[1:46:39] were you feeding on the Word of God see
[1:46:41] when was the last time God's Spirit got
[1:46:43] poured out on you see we got to stay
[1:46:46] it's our choice just like with the wall
[1:46:48] it's your choice redeeming get it back
[1:46:51] where choose where you want to be you
[1:46:53] want to be where the presence of God is
[1:46:55] constantly being pouring out and
[1:46:57] blessings and repenting and rejuvenating
[1:47:00] and strengthening and praying and
[1:47:01] building up and the Holy Ghost do we
[1:47:03] want to be in that yes but a lot of
[1:47:06] people want to be out and just in the
[1:47:08] world and they just don't they want to
[1:47:10] feed their hungry for worldly things we
[1:47:12] can't be like that we can't let church
[1:47:13] be a ritual it's got to be a feast amen

[1:48:05] more I just made that Holy Spirit rain
[1:48:11] down and I'll close with these lasts
[1:48:12] here we're back talking about how
[1:48:14] America is living off he said America's
[1:48:16] lit they're broke we're printing money
[1:48:18] that we don't have
[1:48:19] he said we're living also off a past
[1:48:21] reputation and then he says that's what
[1:48:23] the church is doing today not the bride
[1:48:25] Amen Church we can't live off a brother
[1:48:32] branham's reputation do we reference him
[1:48:34] yes so and we do that to raise our faith
[1:48:38] for right now if God healed his wife God
[1:48:41] can heal my wife God can heal my husband
[1:48:43] it's got to be raised for right now we
[1:48:47] can't live off what other churches did
[1:48:49] or what our church did ten years ago or
[1:48:51] 50 years we got a belief or God right
[1:48:53] now we got to see his power and his love
[1:48:56] pour out upon us now so we can have a
[1:49:00] testimony now Uzziah Hezekiah even wrote
[1:49:04] about Hezekiah this morning they serve
[1:49:05] God so well but got off right at the end
[1:49:07] right at the end and here we are right
[1:49:10] at the end before the rapture and we
[1:49:12] don't want to fall off and get hungry
[1:49:14] for the things of the world we want to
[1:49:15] stay hungry for the things of God how
[1:49:21] many sermons I have to preach on this as
[1:49:22] many as the Holy Spirit thinks we need
[1:49:25] so we can keep this fire burning keep
[1:49:28] the good atmosphere here keep people
[1:49:30] hungry to come to church love God and
[1:49:32] worship God keep building up that wall
[1:49:35] against Satan amen and not be walled
[1:49:41] into a organizational demonic Antichrist
[1:49:44] spirit that wants to put it all I'll
[1:49:46] just put it on brother Jesse he can do
[1:49:48] my praying for me
[1:49:51] I've got to pray for me I'll hadn't
[1:49:56] really just to do my Bible reading for
[1:49:58] me I can't read it for you you've got to
[1:50:00] read it for you you've got a hunger
[1:50:03] you've got a thirst I've got to do it
[1:50:05] too and that's the hour that we're
[1:50:09] living in church people don't want
[1:50:12] accountability they don't want to be
[1:50:14] accountable for their gifts but I
[1:50:15] believe now is the time where the Holy
[1:50:17] Spirit will help us to be accountable
[1:50:18] front I wonder maybe some of us have
[1:50:23] gone for years and haven't used the
[1:50:25] gifts that God has placed in our lives
[1:50:27] how many want to be used by God with
[1:50:30] your gifts you believe you got the Holy
[1:50:33] Ghost but maybe you just don't know what
[1:50:35] gifts are in your life the church we
[1:50:39] will find those by seeking God's face
[1:50:41] coming to church with expectation pray
[1:50:44] in your home reading your Bible saying
[1:50:46] God show me you've given me some talent
[1:50:52] I've got invest in this show me let's
[1:50:57] just pray Heavenly Father you saw the
[1:50:58] hands that were up Lord God there's
[1:51:02] something that every Christian wants to
[1:51:04] do and that's the will of God Lord today
[1:51:07] we've looked at these scriptures we
[1:51:09] don't want to get walled into a ritual
[1:51:11] because it's a blasphemous name dear God
[1:51:14] I don't care what names on the front if
[1:51:18] we're not seeking more of the Holy Ghost
[1:51:20] if we're not wanting more of God's book
[1:51:22] of acts power and Lord we we blaspheme
[1:51:25] the name of God Lord we don't want to do
[1:51:28] that in this church I don't care it's
[1:51:31] not about the number of people here it's
[1:51:32] about the quality of people here amen
[1:51:35] the beauty of the church is the
[1:51:38] character of the people the character
[1:51:40] that once more of God that wants to be
[1:51:42] used by God that wants to show the
[1:51:46] realities of Christ in their life after
[1:51:49] they get born again
[1:51:51] [Music]
[1:51:53] Lord we choose today as the hens are up
[1:51:56] Lord that you saw we choose today to
[1:51:58] stay where the presence of God is being
[1:52:00] poured out day and night we choose the
[1:52:02] feast on the things of God we choose to
[1:52:05] be interested in invest in the things of
[1:52:07] God Almighty I pray for your people in
[1:52:11] the name of Jesus Christ may you become
[1:52:14] such a reality in their life but you
[1:52:16] show them their gifts and their purposes
[1:52:18] on this earth Lord these series just
[1:52:20] kind of keep overlapping with numerology
[1:52:22] Lord and purpose but God I believe it's
[1:52:25] your will for this time that this church
[1:52:28] can really get a good hold on our
[1:52:31] purposes in life
[1:52:32] [Music]
[1:52:34] you've just been bringing it back to me
[1:52:36] more and more and more and showing me
[1:52:38] all these quotations and scriptures
[1:52:41] let's redeem the time whatever
[1:52:44] possessions you've given to us whatever
[1:52:47] inheritance we have Lord whether it's
[1:52:49] wisdom or tongues or knowledge or
[1:52:52] miracles or faith whatever in a heritage
[1:52:57] you've given us Lord may we redeem it
[1:52:59] back to your God before it's too late
[1:53:00] dear God oh don't let it be too late
[1:53:03] Lord God oh but just let your spirit
[1:53:07] pour out on the steer God oh let's just
[1:53:10] we don't want to dry out we want to be
[1:53:12] fresh Lord we want to be soaked with
[1:53:15] your anointing Lord God the Lord of
[1:53:19] you'd squeeze us our virtue could flow
[1:53:21] out of this Lord God and the people came
[1:53:24] by to get a blessing from us we could
[1:53:26] provide that blessing people could use
[1:53:29] our gift of with people could use our
[1:53:30] gift of knowledge we could pray for the
[1:53:33] sick and they would recover Oh God
[1:53:35] that's our prayer Lord today that's our
[1:53:37] prayer Lord God that we can be a living
[1:53:41] thriving growing fruit producing church
[1:53:44] Lord God we will not be walled in by
[1:53:47] trees and rituals I come against that
[1:53:49] ritualistic Creed spirit in the name of
[1:53:52] Jesus Christ saying it behind this
[1:53:54] church God let us be free Lord God
[1:53:58] free Christ Jesus redeeming every
[1:54:02] blessing redeeming every moment
