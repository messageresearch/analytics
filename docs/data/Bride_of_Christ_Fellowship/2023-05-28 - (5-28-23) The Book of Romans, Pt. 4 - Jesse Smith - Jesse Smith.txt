I'd like to uh start there and we'll just kind of see how far we can get by the grace of the Lord okay all right all right I got a text from Brother Brian Hawkins I thought he was coming to our church but he's actually free for Indiana he always tells me he says when I drive by your exit he said he said I always think about coming to Akron I don't know if he was visiting us today or not but he's he's preaching in Indiana Romans 2 Verse 6 we'll read 6 to 11 there I'll read six to nine and then we can read 10 and 11 together by God's grace who will render to every man according to his deeds God will pay back every man or woman for what they've done good or bad Hallelujah verse 7 to them by I'm sorry who by patient continuance in well-doing seek for Glory and Honor and immortality eternal life but unto them that are contentious and do not obey the truth but obey in righteousness indignation and wrath tribulation and anguish upon every soul of man that doeth evil of the Jew first and also the Gentile verse 10 and 11. let's read that together one two three but glory honor and peace to every man that worketh good to the Jew first and also to the Gentile for there is no respect of persons with God may God add his Blessing to dream of his word you may be seated here praise God so we'll take this thought here and by God's grace we'll work our way through this book here I know it'll be a blessing to you I really felt the presence of God as I was studying this morning so I was feeling really encouraged I just sometimes it comes as boldness you know sometimes it comes as kind of like crying and weeping and rejoicing but I felt the boldness of the Lord this morning so address the Lord to minister to you now at the end we want to have special prayer you know as I said there's a picture from yesterday oh I'm sorry I got slides today I forgot to tell you I haven't had slides the last few services that's not the picture from yesterday um as you can see I'm wearing the same shirt you know because I didn't sweat much yesterday but uh but we're so thankful for Lydia you know graduate there hard to believe then as we were leaving I just saw that cross up there I thought Lydia you're standing right under the cross I said let's get a picture right there and so we're very thankful you know 17 years I'm sorry 18 years of life you know and 12 years of schooling I want to thank my wife you know I couldn't have all this great Education Without hers I want to thank her and you know we'll rejoice when all of your little ones graduate you know we'll Rejoice the same way and have a prayer dedication but it just kind of marks a special spot for my wife and I as our first one is finished and just hard to believe but we're thankful for God's grace so I want to just uh you know as I Was preparing this message I thought about these certain quotes from Brother Branham I'm not sure how familiar you are with them so I'd like to just read these briefly but Ram said did you notice in the Bible Paul didn't have any trouble with the church of Ephesus he said they were Scholars they were men who understood but his trouble wasn't with the Roman Church which is what we're reading now and he exalted them before God and talks of their Faith remember chapter one their faith was heard around the world now Paul's right there now of course you know no church is perfect so we see that the Roman Church did have some issues right they had Jews and Gentiles and they didn't know they had trouble with circumcision as we'll see here in this at the end of this chapter uh you know they didn't they didn't know how to exactly rightly divide the Jew and Gentile uh dispensations right they're coming out of Judaism into the you know that was the Old Testament now they're coming into the new and Paul has to lay it out and that's what we're seeing here in these first three chapters um so you know every Church does have issues every Church does have needs but I like what brother random says he just emphasizes that some churches are more mature than others right but it all works out for God's glory praise God there's going to be a hundred full reward a 64 to 30 fold praise God we want to be the hundredfold by God's grace we want to just invest in everything God has given to us and and we know God will bless all of our investments praise God he says uh but the trouble he had was with with was with Corinth Corinth was the place that he had the trouble for they could not take the word everyone wanted a sensation said why why is it when I come among you one's got a tongue one's got a Solomon one's got this and that some kind of a little foolish sensation he says you're Believers but you're not established and so we gotta uh so we gotta understand from this praise God that uh that everything we have whether it's a dream whether it's a vision whatever it is it's all got to come back to God's word we've got to wait upon promises you know we've got to wait upon thus saith the Lord we've always got to say it might be thou say the Lord lest we know for sure we've got to be very balanced in that we've got to trust in the word of God take everything back to the word now you know Paul wouldn't have preached these things to the Corinthian Church and come back and preach the efficient Ephesian Church something else and the Church of the Thessalonians something else he preached the same gospel everywhere but that Ephesian church he could speak to them some of the great mysteries of God had revealed to him down in Arabia he could preach predestination to them he could preach that to the Corinthians I'm sorry he couldn't preach that to the Corinthian Church why he said they still had to if they didn't have oil running out of their hands or some kind of sensation or something another they wouldn't believe what the word said they had to have a tongue or a Psalm or some kind of little sign or something but Paul couldn't preach the solid doctor to them or we'd say the deeper Doctrine to them right Paul was preaching Doctrine to them right Doctrine about how to handle gifts right and how to even do church discipline right so Paul solid doctor to them but brother means deeper things predestination the mysteries of God hallelujah he says the Corinthians they just could believe anything but they didn't believe the right thing but now look do you believe that Ephesian Church spoke in tongues certainly do you believe they had signs of Wonders yes sir but they knowed how to place them their pastors know how to set them and put the church in order but the Corinthians didn't like remember that question sister Naomi asked you know it's related to family members that go to the the Pentecostal church that you know her family members go to those the pastor will say let's just all speak in unknown tongues and then they say if you don't then you're not spiritual you're not saved or you don't have the Holy Ghost and that's nonsense there's nothing in the scripture about praying in unknown tongues as a Church the opposite's true don't pray in unknown tongues unless you got an interpreter praise God and to see it's uh it's just people that would they lack understanding he said uh he says uh each one had to do this had to do that do this and that they had the gifts Paul said you've got great gifts I'm thankful for them but they didn't know how to use them that's the way it is in the church today and it's went on long enough to the Devils begin to slip in and give you some false signs and wonders could you imagine brother we need the Bible an old-fashioned Saint Paul's Revival and the Bible Holy Ghost the true spirit of God amen church I'm thankful when God does a miracle here when God answers a prayer here I'm so glad that we wait till it's something that's genuine praise God it's not something well I got a little feeling where I got this or I got a sensation I'm thankful that we wait till we know it's God praise God I'm thankful that imagine I'm thankful that no one's had to get up here and apologize I'm sorry I said thus said the Lord when it wasn't I'm glad I'm glad that this the devil's not deceived any of us where we've ever said oh this is God they'll say the Lord and we're in other words the devil hasn't deceited us where we're trying to be something that we're not amen thank God that we can just be what God made us to be hallelujah thank God we just wait till God vindicates it praise God amen it's a blessing now here a month later brother man I said now in the book of Corinthians the 10th chapter this book is a book of correction we should take the book of Corinthians it's only church in all the New Testament seemingly that the leaders had such trouble with but Corinthians was always in trouble Paul when he come among them one had a tongue one had a song one had a feeling and a sensation and he was always having trouble with these Corinthians keeping them straight if we notice he couldn't teach the Corinthians deep things they were just a baby fashioned a baby Church I don't want to be a baby church I want to be a mature Church they couldn't go to them great deep messages that he preached to the Ephesians and to the Romans ah look Jersey when we preach this Roman series we're in the deeper things of God we're enjoying the richness of God's depths of his mercy and his mind amen we're in the mind of Christ Hallelujah there's a place for uh signs wonders and miracles there's definitely a place for that praise God but the Corinthians were going too far on that they thought everything was a signed Wonder a miracle right like I just talked to your brother recently I'm just going to tell this story and he's recognizing problems in his home church but he even recognized I was part of the problem and here's his testimony I'm just going to share it I think it'd be a help to you there was a issue in their church about whether to play the new songs like Chris Tomlin and or a Hillsong song or something like that and he was so worked up about it he was praying and he said he said Lord he said if it's your will that we don't sing Chris Tomlin songs he I don't know why he called out Chris Tomlin I don't know why but I guess there was some debate in their church we should we play Chris Tomlin or not he said Lord if it's your will that we we shouldn't do Chris tomlin's songs he said then let the piano be broken and it did and he and so he reported to the pastor and so for a while that church didn't play Chris Thomas songs well later he learned it's not about the individual person you just have to balance you have to rightly divide every song If the lyrics are of God then you can sing it you take out any rock and roll and that's how we've always taught it here by God's grace and he says now I realized I was wrong I was just looking for a sensation and now he sings Chris Tomlin songs that's his testimony so think about that so see we've got to make sure now it's a good thing he didn't run up and say I've got thus saith the Lord that's a good thing because then he would have been a false prophet right so just you know see we got even something like that when we put God to the test we got to be really careful because he's apparently and he's humble he just said I put God to the test I thought God gave the answer but later I found out I was wrong I was just going off a sensation and the church said Hallelujah let's grow in maturity by God's grace amen hallelujah he said now they depended on little Sensations we said well just well praise the Lord I had a revelation come to me I just saw him out of Prophecy Paul said all these things will fail every one of them they just not to be trusted too much in other words you got to be careful each one's got to be tested by the word but what he's trying to get the church was the anchor where we have an anchor in Christ where we don't trust the bone Sensations we don't trust the bond we say Revelations outside the word right we don't trust these things we only trust Christ it's by faith that we move out there praise God now what is Faith Church Brothers says faith is a revelation so see even this we we do we do trust Bible revelations we don't trust fleshly Revelations because those are false Revelations everybody understand this is why every quote's got to be rightly divided too because faith is a revelation he's saying it's not don't trust Revelation but then he says trust Faith well faith is a revelation I see we're teaching some deep things today praise God Amen Hallelujah now let's get in the Book of Romans here now remember we are in the first section we're we read we preach the introduction and now we're on the whole world is guilty before God we'll get to part two maybe uh Wednesday we'll see by God's grace and then uh the beautiful just the sections here are just beautiful the way Paul or Schofield outlines Paul's uh letter here remember said this is that deep letter how many you enjoy the Deep things of God oh I do praise God now I want to I you know I just had this thought yes or this morning I thought I said I want to look up every time brother Branham said Romans Chapter 2 which verses did he use isn't that a good good thought and I said and I already preached Romans 1 I said let me go back and let me find every time brother random use Romans 1 well guess what he used them three times three times so here's the first one brother random cites Romans 2 29. now he's preaching the the church ages the Philadelphia Church age now I'm going to skip down here right to now now the first church age was taught by who Paul now let's go to Romans 2 29 and see what a Jew is so that you'll be sure to know it isn't my own thought of it I like that see brother Adam says I want you to know it's not my thought and when it's when it's not my thought I'll point you to the Bible praise God the Bible is God's thoughts hallelujah amen thank God he says Romans the second chapter he says all right here we are but he's a Jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not a man but of God in other words see Church men are not going to praise the people who have God's spiritual circumcision in other words if you're a real believer men are not going to praise you and Pat you on the back unless there's the devil trying to get him to do it right right but God will honor you praise God God will hear your prayers amen God will have respect unto your testimony praise God so don't look for praise for men don't look for praise from women don't look praise from this world but look for the praise that comes forth from God hallelujah where God will hear your prayer God will give you a testimony that just you and maybe one other person know about praise God a secret testimony pray something like that you know something that's not shared so much publicly but something that's a a secret where God uh God honors you like Jesus said when you pray and give and fashion secret God rewards you openly praise God and maybe just between one or two people praise God but God is going to pay you back he will render to every man and woman based upon the works that you did the faith that you expressed oh my this beautiful praise God that's what faith is Faith that's what works are works is your faith expressed praise God Save By Faith Save By Grace and then be as your appreciation to God for Grace you work for the kingdom of God then he says he says what does it do a spirit Holy Ghost filled Christian praise God I know that you're down here after that age of sanctification that say you that they've got the Holy Ghost but he said it I never they said they had the Holy Ghost without science following but he said they're liar these signs shall follow them that believe can't make him lie oh brother that binds you around and around oh my praise God see that's why Church says signs and wonders at times that follow our lives hallelujah it's God vindicating that you're a real child of God hallelujah and church we can't work them up we can't train them up all we can do is be consecrated and then God will do signs and wonders at the appointed time and place Hallelujah Abram had to wait 25 years until his body changed Hallelujah but God Vindicated him and Time After Time God would meet with him talk with him encourage him and say I will bring it to pass I'm giving you more details about the promise God will give you more details about the promises for your life Hallelujah amen praise God just stay faithful to God hallelujah have patience and well-doing before God hallelujah now here's the second time brother man uses Romans 2. that was the first time Romans 2 29. now he's going to reuse Romans uh see me Romans 2 3. we'll get to that in just a moment now in the church age book brother man I'm talking about the Sevenfold Glory of Jesus Christ in Revelation chapter one I preached on this years ago I think it was 2017 I preached on this I remember because Kevin are not arnott was still here and he was I really enjoyed that message brother some for some reason I just have these strange memories the sixth attribute of Jesus Christ is that a two-edged sword comes out of this mouth and out of his mouth went to Edge I want a sharp two-edged sword and this reminds us that Hebrews 4 12 for the word of God is quick and powerful and sharper than any two-edged sword piercing even the dividing asunder of Soul and Spirit and of the joints of marrow and is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart so here we see the Sevenfold Glory of Jesus and then brother Adam goes from that scripture to this scripture John 1 48 Nathanael saith unto him whence knoweth thou meme Jesus answered and said to him before that Philip called thee when I was under the Fig Tree I saw thee so when Jesus discerned your life and does something Supernatural it lets you know that the word of God is watching you praise God the word of God is is telling you things that only you and God know that's a sign that Jesus Christ is speaking to you it's a sign that you're in the presence of Jesus Hallelujah Hallelujah like we've had it over the weeks I know Lena's giving me some good testimonies where in other ones where I've just preached and it's exactly what you needed to hear it's exactly what you are going through in your life and church only Jesus is the author of that we just got to get into the channel or the the stream of his of his spirit and then when we're in that channel then God will discern our hearts amen it'll it just flows praise God as we get into the channel of the Holy Spirit praise God as we repent of our sins believe God walk in the spirit God's spirit will lead us hallelujah amen he said there it is when Jesus comes that word will come against all nations and all men and none will be able to stand against it it will reveal what was in every heart as he did with Nathanael think of that think of that Jesus is going to do a spiritual open-heart surgery brother Austin brother bang one day Jesus is going to open every spiritual heart and show what's inside of that heart we can't see it all the time we get Clues by people's words and actions but Jesus is going to surgically spiritually open every heart and pull out this this may God find good things in our hearts amen when God does the surgery on you and I may he bring out peace and joy and victory and repentance and humility praise God may you find good things sword in our hearts praise God Amen the word of God will show who did the will of God and who didn't it will make known the secret works of every man and why did them it will divide asunder oh my God this oh you know this let's say this celebrity gave a million dollars to Goodwill or not good will but the Red Cross or whatever well the the Jesus will show why he gave that million dollars was it just to ease his conscience because he already spent maybe 10 million on himself and the lust of his flesh and the toys that he bought you know the million dollar cars and everything we'll know why people did what they did we'll know why Russia invaded Ukraine right well no why we'll know about Joe Biden and Donald Trump and we'll know why Barack Obama did all these things we'll know why Hallelujah because the word will divide asunder everything that's in someone's heart may it find good things in our hearts praise God and in the same section brother Brown uses he goes to Romans 2 verse 3 which we already preached out on Wednesday and what thinketh thou oh man that judges them which do such things and do us the same that thou shalt escape the Judgment of God then it goes on to say this is a Romans 2 how God is going to judge men here it is in verses 5 to 17. now we read 6 through 11. but we are going to read today how Jesus Will judge all men and brother Ram wrote about this in the church age book he says the the hard impeditent heart will be judged The Works will be judged the motives will be judged there won't be any respect before God but all will be judged by that word no one escaping it those who hurt and wouldn't listen will be judged by what they heard those that rested and saying that they believed it but didn't live it will be judged now think about that all the people that heard the message but didn't live it will be judged every secret will come out in the open and be shouted from the housetops oh man we get all of our secrets under the blood Hallelujah get everything under the blood Hallelujah now look oh we will really understand history then now we church if anybody has a good start in world history it's the bride you know why because we got Daniel's revelation of that image we see the Demonic Powers right through Babylon meets the Persians the grecians and now it's in Babylon so we have a we have like a head start on world history and we know why each leader did all these things Alexander the Great it was saved and behind that Dima demons behind that now we know the leaders today America leaders are led by Satan Satan is in charge of every nation right but at the day of Judgment at the white Throne judgment we're going to get a complete history lesson from Jesus amen he's going to expose every heart why people did everything they did he said there won't be a mystery left from all the ages we'll know about the Crusades we'll know about September 11th right we'll know about JFK's assassination we'll know about all these Mysteries we'll know about everything 9 11. we'll know all about it because every man's motive will be exposed before everybody that's what the word does hallelujah now remember this I just thought I'd go over this because it tied in very neatly there there are Sevenfold Glory of Jesus Christ now brother man gets this from uh Clarence Larkin if you ever read Larkin's book Larkin taught the Sevenfold glory and then brother M kind of uh uses maybe his own scriptures but he gets this idea from Larkin which he said I'm using 20 times he said in the church ages I use historians notes 20 times so it's not like he didn't tell us he told us so Jesus first has a head and hairs white like wool and brother Adam tells us that this means the judge is crowned with wisdom you're not going to get we're not going to get anything by Jesus on the day of judgment not gonna be like these slick lawyers that can twist the truth and try to hide things no all of the evidence will be laid out before this wise judge so so here's the picture you got a man I don't know reaping I'm sorry repenting or dying I'm not even sure here because this is Revelation chapter 11. you have the Lord Jesus Christ and the Bible said John was in the spirit on the Lord's Day and program says the Lord's day is based at Armageddon when the so the Lord's day starts at Armageddon when man is no longer in charge of the Earth but now Jesus comes to Reign praise God the days of men are over the days of Russia and China and the U.S ruling all those days are over Jesus has returned Hallelujah and this is what he comes back like he comes back like this now of course not exact like that but with all these descriptions he comes back with these Sevenfold descriptions the first thing they mention is his wisdom isn't that interesting the first gift is wisdom isn't that interesting the same holy spirit that told the Corinthians wisdom is the first gift and you gotta have wisdom to recognize the mother Harlot the first thing the Holy Spirit describes about Jesus is his hair white hair Hallelujah is it interesting when a woman comes in the message the first thing she needs is long uncut hair right she's got a yeah learn to obey the word of God right Hallelujah man's got to cut his hair if he's got long hair like some guys that had mullets in college I don't know some guys had him I don't know the second Glory flame of fire and brothers says these are Angry Eyes of judgment without Mercy so there's no more Mercy a person will just be judged by exactly what was in their heart and think about a church it's going to be very easy for Jesus to judge the Lord showed I believe the Lord revealed to me while I Was preparing there's only two kinds of Hearts either have a heart of Flesh or a Heart of Stone it's very easy for Jesus to judge the word will show did you have did you and I have a soft heart of Flesh that could be uh that could be touched and written upon by the word of God in other words can God teach you to live a more holy life or not oh come on somebody either either the spirit of God can write on it or not right it's got to be a fleshly heart it's got to be a tender heart a heart that loves the word a heart that loves to worship that's the kind of heart that's a saved heart praise God it's gonna be very easy for Jesus show here's here's brother amen's heart of Flesh your sister who is heart of Flesh and here's a sinner's Heart of Stone to be very easy to show the difference and his eyes are eyes of fire our God is a consuming fire right so his eyes are like fire just it reveals it burns it burns out any questions right where's that and it clearly sees it's either flesh or stone so now he's got hair like wool eyes like fire the third Glory he has feet like undefined brass as if they were burned in a furnace and this represents untempered judgment right it's pure judgment it's true judgment it's not different for anybody it's it's the exact same judgment for everybody Hallelujah that's what brother says he says but this brass that describes his feet is more remarkable yet in that it has stood the test of the fiery furnace Hallelujah so that's what we see brass signifies Divine judgment Jesus suffered God's Wrath for us praise God he said it's a judgment that God has decreed and brought to pass Hallelujah so this represents Jesus walk through God's Divine judgment and now he can judge exactly right he'll judge without partiality praise God he won't have any favorites so now as we see his feet are is pure judgment crushing all enemies ah this is our Lord amen this is now when he was on Earth he was gentle Jesus at times right but then he would also get the uh the cord and whip out the money exchangers as well praise God Hallelujah but here he comes back and it's all judgment but thank God church when he comes back we won't be on the earth we'll be in the air behind him praise God oh thank God Amen we'll just be backing him up praise God that's all I'm doing today brother amen we're just backing up Jesus today praise God we're just backing up the message we're backing up the truth saying this is amen well God gave birth around this this is exactly right praise God we believe everything the Bible says we're backing up Jesus today praise God it ain't going to change much just our location is going to change sister sir just our location right now we're backing him up and we'll back him up at Armageddon as well praise God amen hallelujah thank God the fourth glory is his voice as the sound of many Waters the church your voice is in there do you know that program said that voice is all the voices of the Believers down Through the Ages it will bring condemnation the Bible said the Saints shall judge the Earth so when Jesus speaks there'll be times in the in the Judgment where Jesus speaks and our voices will join him in the judgment and and groups of people will be judged by the Christians who obey the word of God aren't you glad that you get to speak with Jesus his voice is as a sound of many Waters and Waters are peoples and multitudes praise God oh my God hallelujah all the generations will speak with Jesus they'll say exactly what he said because that's what we're doing right now amen we're just saying what Jesus says amen I'm just saying what the Bible says hallelujah thank God so now we got four parts hair eyes voice feet the fifth glory is Seven Stars in his hand brother and I said these are the messengers in his care and we've received the message of this hour Hallelujah so I don't have to spend much time on that but in other words brother Branham was in God's Loving Care so is Martin Luther John Wesley Paul iranius Martin Columba they were all in God's Tenors care Church how many can see God's Tender Care in your life as well Hallelujah clearly we can see god holds his Messengers in his care and no doubt the Bible said cast your care on him because he cares for you as well amen praise God but he's got Special Care for his seven Messengers praise God hallelujah just like that one time I was looking at you know I was making this video about Jim Jones again and brother Brandon Jim Jones LED 900 people to their desk brother Branham when he was younger tried to kill four or five boys with a shotgun and God wouldn't let the gun go off talk about predestination and then he tried to commit suicide and God spared him from that talk about Grace with Austin right talk about Grace amen Hallelujah that's God that's God's foreknowledge he saw brother M wanted to live right and he wouldn't want to be a murderer and he wouldn't want to commit suicide if his heart was in the right condition and because God had borne out he could predestinate God's Deliverance amen hallelujah he could show he cared for a servant and he wouldn't let his servant commit murder he cared for her son he wouldn't let his son commit suicide praise God that's because he cares so much and if he cared for Paul he cared for brother for him he cares for you and I too praise God oh my thank God Amen Hallelujah brother says now next is a sharp two-edged sword out of his mouth this is the word that will judge all this is what we read earlier so a word comes out and judges everybody the same a two-edged sword Hallelujah and last but not least the seven full Glory of Christ his countenance his face is as the son and this represents the power right like this morning I was praying at the Sunrise it was so bright out there on my deck it was so bright I had to position I had to sit where the sun was hiding behind the wooden post there on the bottom part of my deck there because it was so bright I couldn't even like focus it was so bright Lord have mercy the power of His countenance amen the power it's like the sun the power of his face now he's got eyes of fire in there too he's got white hair and the power of His countenance brother says this represents the power of his righteousness in other words when the Sun Shines on you you just gotta you just gotta absorb it and you gotta look away and so it is on the day of judgment when Jesus says Holiness strikes these Sinners they're going to say yes I do that yes I commit adultery yes I committed fornication yes yes I was a whoremonger yes I was yes I was a murderer all these things they will not be able to escape it it's too powerful they'll have to tell the truth that's the power of His countenance Hallelujah it shines it's righteousness shines like the sun praise God amen and look they have to look away from the Holiness and and recognize that they can't lie in the presence of Jesus Christ amen in church that's the Sevenfold Glory of his person how many appreciate the Lord that's a good review I haven't preached out in about six years so it feels good to preach it again amen hope that's a blessing by God's grace but with the with the sword the sword yeah that's where brother and places Romans chapter 2. where Paul shows he's going to judge everybody the same way Hallelujah now those are two quotes on Romans 2 and the whole message I could find I searched the three or four five different times different phrases I could find brother Raymond has one quote from Romans chapter one so this is kind of back going back to part one and part two Brothers preaching out of Revelation 3 the celebrity in church H or teaching in the book he said now God says they are naked is buying as well I'm talking about lukewarm church members not us we're not naked we're covered spiritually and naturally amen and we're not blind we can see we can see the Beast and we can see the bride of Christ how many thank God for that you are clothed and you have sight ah thank God Amen but George like we saw yesterday we got family members that are blind and naked sometimes naturally right blind and naked and don't even know it and yet we told them yet I put videos on the YouTube for them and Facebook and everything like that gave them my books and they know it right but then they don't know it because they're running from the truth in other words they won't obey it is what it means praise God he says brother said I cannot imagine anything as tragic as a man who's blind and naked and does not know it there's only one answer he's out of his mind right and romance said we're gonna he said thus saith the Lord we're coming to an insane age he is already deep and Oblivion his faculties are gone spiritual Amnesia said in what else can it mean can it mean that the Holy Spirit has taken his leave out of the last day Church could it mean that men have put God out of their minds to an extent that is happening even as stated in Romans 1 28 remember we preach on this and even as they did not like to retain God and their knowledge God gave them over to reprobate mind to do those things which are not convenient so brother man goes back to Romans 1 to show the state of the church in the end time in laodicea hallelujah what a blessing what an encouragement church we feel sad we mourn over people like this that have reprobate mind but you've got a sound mind let me tell you some good news God gives you the spirit of love power and a sound mind praise God you are not of this lukewarm group you're of the hot group praise God Amen you love Jesus why because you love to retain the word of God in your mind Hallelujah like I told Haven I said Haven you keep where's Haven I said you keep memorizing she was asking me daddy should I keep speaking the word before Bible or prayer time and bedtime I said absolutely that'll be the greatest blessing you can have is to quote God's word before you go to sleep praise God Hallelujah I said yeah honey that's well I'll produce some of the greatest blessings in your life quote the word of God memorize the word of God speak the word of God Amen hallelujah praise God so this scripture Romans 1 28 speaks of laodicea as well it spoke of the sinners in the Ephesian Church age right and when Paul wrote it and today it speaks of laodicean church members that are lukewarm that's right now brother man goes on to say this right after Romans 1 28 it surely appears that something like that has happened here's a people who say there of God and know God and have his Holy Spirit and yet they're naked and blind and don't know it like one of our family members yesterday they we went to their church and they talked about how they're filled with the holy spirit yet they let their women cut their hair wear pants and wear short shorts and wear sexy clothes they say they got they're filled with the spirit in other words we're saying we're filled with the Holy Spirit and they're saying they're filled with the Holy Spirit well somebody's right and somebody's wrong and the only way that you know is by the sharp sword of Jesus's mouth Hallelujah that's the only way you know is the word of God what does the word tell us the word tells us how to dress the world the word tells us how to have the Holy Spirit praise God and what a Holy Spirit-filled life will look like amen he says they are already deceived they have the wrong Spirit the elect cannot be deceived but is evident that these others are these are they who have become blind because they refuse the word of God these are they who have stripped themselves naked by leaving God's care and protection and sought to build their own way of Salvation their own Tower of Babel by organization right one Church gathering with other churches or we've got support of all the churches that's the biggest sign that you're under uh The Jezebel smear that I know of that you want to gather with Catholics and and you want to gather with lutherans and methodists and Baptists that you that your your strength is in communion with them our strength is in communion with Christ Hallelujah not a denomination because the denominations have kicked him out of the church but we welcome him this morning praise God we sang Praises this morning we said prayers this morning we welcome Jesus amen he's not knocking trying to get in Jesus is in Hallelujah amen and the church said amen he's not trying to get in our church he is in this church Hallelujah he's the foundation of the church and one day for the amen at the Rapture he'll be the Capstone of this church amen glory amen thank God Hallelujah now notice now I'm going to get more to verse by verse preaching here by God's grace in these first two chapters Paul is speaking to three groups the first group are Gentile pagans right these are the ones that don't like to retain God in their minds these are the homosexuals the murderers like Jim Jones this the first group is the Gentile pagans now Romans 2 1-16 is the second group Gentile moralists okay as we'll get to here in a little bit because later on Paul's going to say any Gentile that doesn't know the Jewish law or the Torah still has the law of God written in their hearts everybody with me so no doubt there were Gentile Nations they didn't have the Torah they didn't have Genesis exes Leviticus numbers and Deuteronomy they didn't have those but Paul said it doesn't matter they had God's word written their heart praise God Hallelujah now just so you know Paul says there is an advantage to having the Torah okay so the Jews had an advantage but most of them didn't take advantage of that advantage they didn't capitalize on that Advantage Church let's enjoy all the advantages we have what advantages do we got well we got no physical persecution right now we got Bibles on our phones we got paperback Bibles we've got all the sermons of brother random that we should listen to praise God we have all these advantages let's make the most of them praise God Hallelujah but Paul said even these Gentiles without the law they still had God's law written in their hearts and their minds in other words they knew right from wrong and the third group at the end of this chapter is the Jews that were legalistic and had the law of God and Paul says all these groups are condemned by their sin right unless they have what what's that f word they got to have Faith the five letter f word faith Hallelujah see where we have pure hearts and pure Minds praise God right there's one thing we're saved by grace through faith Hallelujah thank God now church and uh and uh I heard a preacher say this I liked it he said all of us can relate to these three conditions I I believe I can I I've been in I've been in these mine all three of these mindsets before so before I started serving God I was a gentile pagan and then you know there was times I was trying to be a good person and I wasn't following God I was just trying to be a good boy that's what that is here's like I don't care to be a good person here's like well I'll try to be I'm a good person and then here's where we get legalistic sometimes well if I do this and this and that then this has to happen well only if it's God's will right this this is if I keep all these requirements I'm going to get this this and that well there's some truth to that but you don't want to make it your righteousness you want it to be God's righteousness right you want to you you don't you don't want to try to make God do something you want to let God do what he wants to do so see all of us can relate to these three mindsets Hallelujah now let's pick up here here's where we left off on Wednesday so finally that was my that's my good background here 40 minute background but I put some new stuff or some fresh stuff and some review stuff in there in there to them by who by patient continuance in well doing so she just patiently served God it'll pay off for you what are you seeking when you're patient God's glory and honor and eternal life but unto them that are contentious now this is like a politician basically putting oneself forward so that's what Sinners do right they try to put themselves forward and do not obey the truth but obey on righteousness indignation which is passionate anger and wrath which is anger tribulation awaits for these who are electioneering for themselves they're they're only worried about themselves they're living for me I'm number one instead of Christ is number one he said tribulation which is distress or pressure and anguish extreme Affliction upon every soul of that man that doeth evil of the Jew first and also the Gentile okay so here's the moralist group here's the more or less Gentile right but he also says even Jews so look it's about doing evil or doing good because faith will produce one or the other right genuine faith will produce good but human faith will produce evil notice program said there's lots of kinds of faith there's either saving Faith or there's human Faith right the faith you have I'm going to go I'm gonna go turn on my car and I know it's going to start that's human faith anybody has that even demons believe there's a God that's just that's that's faith of that's faith of a angel right that's Angelic Faith they're not humans but they have faith they have an intellectual faith right and then there's you know there's there's uh the gift of faith was to speak to mountains and move mountains right uh there's there's other kinds of Faith as well there's the fruit of faith faith is the Fruit of the Spirit right there's lots of and faith is also the first anointing praise God the statue of man there's lots of different kinds of faith or measures of Faith verse 10 but glory honor and peace to every man that work is good to the Jew first and also to the Gentiles how many people want peace in their life if you want peace do good things like we said on Wednesday you reap what you sow amen Hallelujah and people are either going to see it in this life or the next I hope in our lives they see it in both praise God I hope your co-workers or your families and your friends and everybody in this church can see your good works now and then we'll see Jesus reward you for them later at the white Throne judgment amen Hallelujah that our good works will be displayed by Jesus they'll say Well done good and faithful servant Glory Romans 2 11 for there's the persons with God right we all got the same opportunity to serve God we all have breath in our lungs day to serve God we all got Bibles to read the Bible we all got access to God by prayer we can all pray right we can all ask God for the desires of our heart and God will hear everyone if they're sincere praise God there's no respect to persons with God so in other words as high as you want to get in Christ you can reach it don't brother said I would never get in the way of anybody that has a faith to be like Enoch that's a brother said program said I may not have the faith to do it and it wasn't God's timing for him to do it right God had to save you God had to save me God had to save a generation after brother Brown praise God maybe more we don't know but may everybody be encouraged you can go as high as you were in Christ today because God is not a respective person whatever you put in that's what you'll get out praise God amen verse 12. I had a brother uh just as an encouragement I had a brother a couple Brothers email me this week they said they said One Day in heaven he said I could just he said I listened to your sermons almost every day he said I can't wait to give you a hug in heaven I said well if I get to heaven I got at least one person that wants to hug me so that's a good sign I said thank you sir that means a lot to me praise God Hallelujah for as many of us have sinned without law Shall Perish without law and as many as I've sinned in the law shall be judged by the law so whether you had Moses law or didn't you're still judged right and why is that now I want to just stop here for a moment now this is why Jesus came without respect to persons or no partiality Jesus has no partiality that means he doesn't like men more than women so sisters be encouraged he likes you just as much as the brothers he's not partial children he likes you just as much as us older people my God or younger older people and he's going to say this you're either one of the other either you're doing well and working good or you're doing evil it's either one of the other it's so simple in his sight his fiery eyes right can tell right away either it's a good heart or an evil heart thank God we've got good Hearts amen that love Jesus praise God he sees our every desire he sees our every action that's why church when we see you know our sin in our members that's why Paul said when we see it rising up we got to crucify it praise God if you be risen with Christ crucify the lust of the reflection lessen the affections there I'll praise God if you've had a resurrection if you've had an Easter in your own life crucify the things of the flesh the desires of the flesh praise God Hallelujah Romans 2 13 for not the hearers of the law and so just because we come to church we're not justified we're Justified because we do we're doers of the law in other words God declares you righteous because you obey his word Hallelujah for when the Gentiles which had now here's the one where we talk about uh every tribe in the jungles that don't have Bibles and uncivilized communities or the Aborigines out in Australia here's a scripture that proves they'll all be judged by God for when the Gentiles which have not the law do by Nature the things contained in the law these having not the law are alone to themselves see so whatever laws they establish they'll be judged by those laws and a lot of them line up with God's laws right like brother man this is that one I couldn't remember in Africa brother and visited a tribe where a woman if she was caught having fornication before marriage she'd be stoned and brother man makes a kind of like a sad joke he says if they brought that to America how many young women we have left and what about the men that deserve it as well according to Jewish law the men deserve it as well how many young people would have left I know we have some here praise God thank God Amen by God's grace see but whatever laws they have established in their tribes it's a it's a it's a a testimony that God put right and wrong in their hearts already and notice what do they do they bear witness that God's laws in their hearts and their thoughts because they excuse or else excuse one another they either accuse others or they excuse others Hallelujah and that shows they have God's word written in their hearts they know right from wrong and they can accuse someone right or accuse someone wrong or they can excuse have mercy on someone or not have mercy on someone aren't you glad the Bible has all the answers oh it's a blessing and I use this verse all the time this is one of the greatest verses I think well it's hard to say that but this is one of the most important verses in the Bible because each one of our family members right we're seeing our family members today every one of them are going to be judged by Paul's gospel in that day when God shall judge the secrets of men by Jesus Christ according to my gospel like brother man preached that sermon the door and the doors May Church may we open every door in our heart and say Jesus Come into this city come into this room I don't want to I don't want to I don't want to keep any secrets from you I'm struggling with this help me Lord to overcome give me Grace Lord to have victory in this area of my life come in to every part of my thinking May the words of my mouth and the meditations of my heart be acceptable in thy sight oh God Grant it Lord Jesus Hallelujah behold Thou Art called a Jew and rest Us in the law and make us thy boasts of God and know us his will and approve is the things that are more excellent being instructed out of the law okay so now he breaks into this next group this is the the Jews the legalists here we'll get to here verse 19. and our confidence so the Jews were confident that thou thyself are to guide to the blind a light of them which are in darkness so the Jews that had the law of Moses they were confident were the guides we're lights for them who are blind and what does it show here legalists can become self-confident or prideful right we got to be careful Church we're supposed especially as ministers we're supposed to be leaders of men but we can't think that it's our own righteousness that does it it's God's righteousness we can't be confident ourselves we've got to be confident in the power of the cross the power of daily dying amen the power of every day taking up your cross and following Jesus that's the only one who's worthy to follow as a man is those who follow Jesus wholeheartedly praise God the Jews in verse 20 said they were instructor of the foolish a teacher of babes which has the form of knowledge and of the truth in the law so Paul's Paul's rebuking them you're so self-confident you're you're a guide everybody else is foolish does it sound familiar some message churches got this same attitude right like I was telling Emma there's some churches that they think nobody can get saved outside of the message what a bunch of nonsense that's exactly what they become they become this nobody can get saved outside of me like you're going to live forever like on this Earth like you're all-powerful no you're not you're just you're just one Pebble on the beach right Hallelujah you're one little Pebble on the beach see we've got to be careful this is the legalist attitude and it comes in to the message and here's how you know thou therefore which teaches another teaches thou not thyself thou that preachest a man should not steal Dost thou steal but see it all starts with the leaders the leaders are saying don't steal but are stealing that produces hypocrites all right that produces hypocrisy and then it works down to everybody else praise God oh God give us clean hearts Clean Hands Hallelujah let's live righteously before God and before the church thou says a man should not commit adultery Dost thou commit adultery thou Horus Idols thus thou commit sacrilege like we said people can make brother Branham an idol you can make the tapes an idol you can pronounce you can make a husband and wife he said a piano a car you can make anything an item right and Jesus said if you look on a woman and lust after her you've already committed adultery right and this is what leaders especially leaders but all of us have to make sure we're not living a a legalistic hypocritical life but each day we take up the cross and Die daily praise God amen I'm not gonna have any Idols in my life amen I'm going to have if your heart praise God I'm going to meditate on the things of God hallelujah thank God thou that maketh thy boasts of the law through breaking the law dishonor thou God so in one way they boast look at all that we do but then they break other parts of God's law now look the church this is serious look for the here's the danger of legalism and it's what that's what we got to watch for see George look at those other see those three areas Paul's talking to we're not going to be the heathens right we're not going to start saying oh homosexuality is okay we're never going to say that we're not going to be the moralists that leave out the word we're always going to have the word so this is the one that we've gotta we've got to watch for we've got to carefully examine Our Lives not to become legalists remember legalism is when you add anything to the word of God to promote your righteousness praise God so Paul says these men are saying don't commit adultery yet they do don't have Idols yet they do and Paul says when they do this the name of Jesus is blasphemed among the Gentiles through you as it is written look Church this is why all these message people are going to be judged harshly when they fall away and I'm talking about even the ones that stay in churches and claim to believe brother Branham and they're caught in money laundering schemes and adulteries and child molestation and all these things when the world hears about it about all these sins and message churches that makes the world blasphemy the name of Jesus and they're going to be guilty of that that's why I thank God we have a clean reputation here by God's grace hallelujah thank God I want to say thank you to everyone here that loves Jesus because we got a good reputation praise God there's come no smut upon our church our church has lived in the goodness of God Amen amen you've lived in the purity of this gospel and let's keep it that way praise God yeah we all fall short and we all make mistakes but by God's grace God's cut this from from from Big evil Wicked sins like that and we're just all of our Christian Soldiers marching to Victory praise God amen Hallelujah like I told you the biggest church in America a few years ago had a murder in it one of the members had a daughter who was insane and she took a shotgun and killed her father and he was like one of the main singers in the church and then they're the church that does that inner they're against interracial marriage so Seth look at that stain on the church the biggest church in Canada 20 years ago had a pastor who let sexual molestation go on his church and didn't report it to the authorities because it was in his family and look off and it brings such a reproach now I'm not saying it's blasphemy it could be I don't know it's up to God but look at that When sin is allowed and sin is petted oh may God help us to let the sword of the word be preached this morning amen ah thank God see at some point the real word of God wasn't being preached in those churches may God up our church to always preach the truth of God's word hallelujah and may you and I obey the word of God that's being preached not just here as well as a good sermon but let's do what the word of God says not do what brother Jesse does or do it though Jesse says do what the Bible says amen and that'll keep us walking the righteous of God well white robes on Amen the Bible said blameless amen hallelujah the Sons and Daughters of God hallelujah oh my God thank God I know I'm going almost had an hour here I got 55 minutes I can tell you're getting tired so bear with me here my voice is actually getting tired Hallelujah but see it's Hypocrites that cause God's name to be blasphemed and church that's what these people that leave the message that believe to sign people and they they love to see message churches get scandals because they do this they blaspheme brother random they blaspheme the message they speak evil which means blasphemy in this case it means speak evil against they just can't wait till some message church falls and then they can blaspheme against it well I'm glad that I'm glad that we haven't blasphemed amen I'm glad that our lives speak Holiness unto Jesus I'm going to be one we're gonna be one of those few churches that stand on the word of God hallelujah thank God Amen the Bible said we're blameless Hallelujah and we live an honest and good life before the people praise God thank God now this that scripture reminded me of this scripture so see it even goes to our home life we've got to honor Jesus Christ in our home life or else our neighbors will see our lives and they'll blaspheme the gospel if we're not living the right way right that's what the Bible says look at Titus the age women likewise are older sisters that they be in Behavior has becometh Holiness not false accusers not given to much wine teachers of good things now what are the elder sister is supposed to do teach the young women to be sober right not be silly to love their husbands to love their children to be discreet Chase keepers at home good obedient to their own husbands that the word of God be not blasphemed see so when a when a couple or when a family disobeys the word of God and let's say they let's say a family has let's just use a wife or husband let's say let's say there's a husband that abuses the wife and the neighbors found out on it the neighbors will blaspheme God because of that abuse or a wife that yells at and disrespects the husband the neighbors will hear about that and they'll blast him say look they go to church every Sunday they dress up and look that's they're just there's nothing to it and that blasting is the name of God see Church we're all responsible before God Hallelujah and of course God is the god of Mercy Hallelujah God's going to help us hallelujah he's here to strengthen us praise God he's here to give us our hearts desire and what greater desire can we be than to live a life that honors Jesus praise God and if you want a life that honors Jesus he'll help you do it praise God amen Dr Romans 2 I want to finish Romans 2 today I'm about at an hour okay so now he's getting to the legalistic Jews for circumcision barely profiteth if thou keep the law okay so this church struggled this is one of the struggles of the Roman Church the the Jews the Jewish Christians were saying well your your babies your boys aren't circumcised that's wrong when they're saying well I don't know if that's wrong or not right I don't know so Paul's to lay it out and says he says uh if you keep circumcision that's good if you keep the rest of the law but if you break the law your circumcision is made on circumcision so see if you obey one part of God's word you got to obey the rest praise God therefore if the UNS if the Jew if the Gentiles rather keep the righteousness of the law look shall not his uncircumcision be counted for circumcision in other words God is looking at the heart God's looking at the heart that's what wants to obey all the word of God we have to obey all the word of God here other scriptures came to my mind go to if you got the your Bible go to the New Testament here yeah that's right somebody was emailing me uh from another church and ask him about the law go to Matthew yeah 23 23 that should be familiar and this is the this is helpful as a Christian as well what I mean is church there's an hour what I mean is you know we want to come in the message and yes we want to repent we want to be buried in the name of Lord Jesus Christ we want to believe God sent brother Branham we want to know all these scriptures but we got to go more than that we got to keep going into the things of God praise God right that's the way to honor and glorify Jesus right to to continue to keep all the message amen we got to keep all the message the best we can right I'm sorry it was Matthew 23. Lydia I'm sorry graduation girl can you read that please yeah 23 23. amen thank you hun so Jesus said you should have done the tithes and offerings but you should have also shown judgment mercy and faith these are more weighty than even paying your ties and offerings how many know ties and offering is just the beginning that's that's an elementary that's an easy thing to do the church said ties and offering is easy that's a that's an elementary thing right but if you want to be more spiritual more mature say God give me a spirit of judgment or discernment help me to show Mercy and help me have faith in your promises now you're getting somewhere with God now you're going up that stature now you're being mature and if you're born again nah you're being real mature by God's grace now God can use you in a greater way so I thought this was just support I shared this with somebody they said oh Jesus never told people to obey the obey the he said you should have did that but you should have done more than that amen you left out some of it Hallelujah but Churchill we got the Holy Ghost it'll not leave out anything it'll guide us into all truth hallelujah John 16 13 amen thank God Glory now 27. Romans 2 27 and Shout Out Gentile which is uncircumcision which is by nature if it fulfill the law judge thee who buy the letter and circumcision dust transgress the law is that something Paul says a gentile that's not circumcised could judge a Jew who circumcised and yet who disobeys the law God would see a righteous obedient heart more than a heart that just obeyed that for the outward appearance of things God looks at the heart God doesn't look so much with the outward appearance God looks at our hearts today oh what a comfort to know that praise God what a comfort to know I'm almost done here by God's grace I think 29 might be the last verse thank the Lord Romans 2 28 for he is not a Jew which is one outwardly neither is that circumcision which is outward in the flesh now Church remember that Covenant with with circumcision from Genesis 17 that was super important if the males didn't have that they could not even be in the camp you couldn't even go to church in other words unless all the males were circumcised you couldn't even sacrifice right you could even be a part of Abraham's lineage unless you had this but Paul says this was all pointed to something Paul says this was a shadow praise God in other words that every man and every woman have a heart that circumcised that's the real point of this that the old life the old desires will be cut away permanently and there will be a permanent change that each person would be a new creature a new a new heart in Jesus Christ hallelujah oh my verse 29 but he is a Jew which is one inwardly and circumcision is that of the heart in the spirit and not in the letter whose praise is not a men but of God I just want to stop on there just for a moment here let me yeah let me show the definition here 's the definition of circumcision now this is the natural here's the spiritual this one applies to us here so a circumcision is is metaphoric of Christians separated from the unclean multitude and truly consecrated to God the extinction of Passions and the remu removal of spiritual impurity and the church said hallelujah how many want to be a real spiritual Jew praise God said it's a holy ghost thing praise God it's not that we're the 144 000 or or you are the tribe of Judah or you have I Asher you're Asher she has a brother named Asher oh I try to we're not trying to figure out our natural lineage of that's not what we're after we're just after that we are God's people praise God Amen that God is blind in Israel and now he's got a gentile bride amen now he's got a church praise God a bride that loves him who is totally dedicated to him and her heart is so holy completely sold out for Jesus amen I think thank you Jesus amen what is a circumcised Christian he or she's separated from the unclean multitude I think it was beautiful it was just fitting yesterday how our graduation ceremony now Emma would know best because she's been the she was at a a public school graduation recently right for her graduation so it's been a while since my wife and I have been to a public graduation ceremony but I'm sure without a doubt Lydia's graduation ceremony looked totally different than the public schools they had prayer numerous times we sang what three hymns Hallelujah I guess we saw a few uh immorally Dressed girls but not too many one too many but at the school at the worldly Public School there have been a lot of worldly dress people right it would have been the rock and roll and all kinds of things like that but what what a contrast and at Lydia's graduation we got the preaching of the word boy that preacher like he bought out uh critical race Theory homosexuality what else abortion transgenderism Catholic Church wow that's a pretty good that's amount of Grace right there five is Grace that's a pretty good portion of Grace it is a good sign that we are separated from the things of the world but I know that we go a lot deeper than that by God's grace we can go even deeper than that into the Seven Seals marriage and Navarre amen the serpent seed amen hallelujah the seven Thunders even the seven Church ages we go deep into the word of God the Deep things of God hallelujah thank God and we are Church by if if we have to be we're truly consecrated to God show me another group who's more consecrated God I'd like to see it but Ram said the denominations will outwork us because they have more money and they got more people he said another church age book he said that but he says it kind of in a joke he said but that's just like the mule outworking another like a like a lamb or something like that so we can't look at everybody's Works look at your spiritual condition praise God look at your heart praise God amen look at your nature do you have a word nature or denominational Works nature we got the nature of Jesus Christ praise God and yes we should do works and yes we do praise God and we need constant reminders how many need reminders to pray give alms in the fast how many reminders of that I do I do we all do I all get I get so busy sometimes I forget to pray I forget to fast I forget to give all homes you know you I get so focused on paying the bills and getting this done getting this done for the school and getting this sometimes I need reminders of that I thank God for that praise God but he's God's ultimately looking at whose heart is circumcised unto Christ who is truly separated from the unclean multitude and consecrated to Christ and my last thought about this uh I think my last thought about this is that it's a circumcision of the spirit so this this can mean both what's in the spirit the soul and the mind right we say the spirit is a human Spirit and the inside of that is the core of the spirit is the soul so this means church we need a circumcision in our soul you know all the unbelief in our soul that's got to get cut out when we get saved but our daily circumcision that's what it is it's a daily circumcision is in the mind in our thinking praise God we can't let evil thoughts creep into our minds and and help and and start making us think about passions of the world or lust of the eyes and pride of life and lust of the flesh those had to be circumcised out every single day because the circumcision is in the thinking as well we have to make sure our thinking stays with the word of God let's stand to our feet I'm gonna stop right there musicians can come I don't I don't want to go too far in chapter three I was ready to go a little bit further but let me stop right there how
