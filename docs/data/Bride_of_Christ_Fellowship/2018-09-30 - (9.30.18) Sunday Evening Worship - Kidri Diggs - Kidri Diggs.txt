the other Church of heat and the service situation remember that so we're thankful for God's gift that's another segment it's not the person it's the revelation from the foundation of knowing Christ and Christ just uses us in His mercy none of us have special greater than any why only one great one that's Jesus for Amy narrating she's now Johnny's who does rather let's call the gift of God this

[Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] Department says thou shall review all the way with the LORD thy God greatly he's four years in the wilderness nobody had to prove to know what was in my heart without risking his commandments Brno in heat Hungary and suffered two hundred and family with men on which thou knowest not my father's men that he might make you know that man left if I break alone but by every word that proceedeth [Music] it was faith but kind of Express tonight and let's unfold take a little bit boy you know we kind of talked about the foundation but let's understand the working of faith or no and who we talk about me you know I think a lot of times we can possessions jewel-like god bless me with a house god best with a car all these end up with believing for but the attribute of faith is more than just your natural possessions because the bible says you know without faith it is impossible to please so we can't just you know you know when we look at the christian was the whole christian journey is about believing in a god that you can't see what's on that side only have reaching into the unseen something that was standing on the say okay this is what I'm planting my faithful doing we look at that scripture you know just through my favorite if I can start I kind of wanna reflect either churches where but you know kind of came and said look we don't live by our works all these church he got something rose up in him he said no I'm not listen by the way you're doing come I say so what was he saying he was saying I'm living with your work means it means Romans suggestion about faith that were faint me moral commissioning me so when that faith is impossible to please God what is God saying without conviction [Music] this that word means it means moral conviction religious truth or the truthfulness of God when we say we're living my faith we're living by Morgan bishop or the truthfulness of God earlier so when you say I have convictions you live in my the truthfulness of God we are we happy [Music] [Music] and God knows who what is he oh yes sir look you told just in the book of Deuteronomy he promised me but he would challenge get convictions good came out all together Oh [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] troubles to encourage yes sir he doesn't come and keep you know pulling up God is a creator all right [Music] you know he was already oh he made a mistake how I believed everything my god come here just about life situation and finally my god you know for me you use your like turning trying about like tail or get me to make and God is like he cannot tell a lie so God leisure he says okay go ahead and it works out and you serve the Lord another day based upon your conviction of faith other trials come up hunting God shows himself to again hi so you keep watching funny in your completions of faith and now you're going through battle today that same God that led you here is the same God oh yeah and still with you today [Applause] [Applause] [Music] somebody's bleep God [Applause] turn your took Joe look at John we'll get George life and with a journalist back so angle will say he was you actually know is faith is faith is conviction will st. just grace that wasn't the kind of faith that was trying to fly right faith has to be a beet sugar be right in what yeah wicked people deserve the grace of God but let God washes where holy yeah [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] maybe the Bible whatever it is [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] mr. quarterly sees what God and what God was done oh but you start looking for what you pray [Music] [Laughter] [Applause] you see say see

[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] it was reality your brother wasn't some foot honors the religious thing it was the Jesus Christ I'm gonna say when we have received it in the truth of the revelation of the Holy Ghost things come off the shelf he's right a lot of judges into my juggling because I don't see God or the revelation I can see like this I know with all my heart I shall miss very I told you the one thing I know this abuse of Trumpets to be challenged me is the Holy Spirit you have working on why because it's a pastor and today and mr.
