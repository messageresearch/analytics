childlike faithful god for lord we must become like children with children childlike faith god to enter the kingdom of god so let us all be humble tonight lord we pray god you minister to our sister's request father anoint us god as we preach your word and that we can hear it and preach it god that you would be glorified thank you for your great love and lord i pray you speak to us through thy word in jesus christ's name saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated there praise god i'm going to show some slides here i'm going to just review real real briefly i'll just try to keep this real brief here i've preached two sermons on the book of colossians you know we just go verse by verse i felt inspired about five or six years ago if the saints be on the curtain of time are shouting we're resting on what paul preached and we need to know what paul preached and so i lord by god's grace i preached all the way through galatians ephesians philippians and now i'm in colossians by god's dreams that preached to those epistles of paul so we hope that if the lord terry said i don't know if the lord is going to tarry but he terrorists hope we can get through this one and then get back to romans and corinthians just be beautiful to delay in these scriptures and remember romans 2 16 says will be judged by the gospel that paul taught that's right by jesus christ so jesus christ will stand there he'll have paul's apost paul's uh paul's words right there that is the judgment standard so praise god how do we live up to that standard amen it's called the high calling in christ amen we're supposed to walk worthy of the high calling now god's not asking us for absolute perfection he knows we're going to sit every day but he asks us to die every day amen that's one thing we can do amen we have the choice to die to ourselves every single day praise god and walk in the spirit and then if we're walking the spirit then we are the sons and daughters of god hallelujah so i just want to briefly look at just remind us of a few things you know uh just for a map there just have an idea colossae was about uh what was it 11 miles how many miles was that oh it was about 100 miles east of ephesus and 12 miles from laodicea so there you have ephesus laodicea and then colossae so just to give you an idea there modern day turkey uh where it's at where it stands today it's that pile of dirt right there that's that's colossae right there the power dirt right it just ruins and it's unexcavated and it hasn't been rebuilt or anything after an earthquake history says it it collapsed between 60 and 62 a.d through an earthquake and it was never rebuilt it just kind of moved on as you can see they moved further uh east it looks like and built civilization there so they had less than a decade after receiving paul's letter to manifest christ to that city this was a city on a timer right there sound familiar this nation is on a timer right we preached a few weeks ago on the earth was filled with violence yeah i mean that's all it is now violence all it is in the news there's murders and all kinds and then uh these corrupt judges won't prosecute some of these people it's just it's becoming just like the days of noah more and more we thought it was even 20 30 years ago look at it today praise god it's getting worse and worse and worse thank god for grace and thank god for the saints of god that are holding back judgment praise god because we're here right because we're here all right grace is extended to this land amen right and god is still looking to get the last final souls amen the bible says the long suffering of god is salvation amen amen so while we're our hearts are burdened and we're we're uh we're grieved by the the violence and the destruction the perversion of sodomites and laodicea at the same time we know god is still winning souls amen amen god just sent us two souls last year praise god amen i'm sorry uh lena and brother austin praise god so god is still in the business of saving souls amen sure hallelujah and so we looked at that and i'm going to just i'll just background with that and then uh let's just read again verses one to eight here by god's grace just briefly paul an apostle of jesus christ by the will of god and timotheus to our brother to the saints and faithful brethren in christ with you at colossae grace be unto you and peace from god our father and the lord jesus christ we have thanks to god and the father of our lord jesus christ praying always for you so church if you can't remember something to pray for pray for a church because paul always prayed for the colossians true remember he told that to the philippians 2. he said i'm always praying you with all all prayer that's right so see that's one thing we must never forget we can't remember who to pray for uh we've already prayed for all of our needs let's pray for a church amen let's pray for the people to grow in in the knowledge of god as we'll see in just a moment here verse 4 since we heard of your faith in christ jesus and of the love which you have to all saints for the hope which is laid up for you in heaven whereof ye heard before in the word of the truth of your of the gospel which has come unto you as it is in all the world and bringeth forth fruit as it does also in you since the day you heard it and knew the grace of god in truth as he also learned of epiphrous our dear fellow servant who is for you a faithful minister of christ who also declared unto us your love in the spirit remember colossae was a church paul did not start epa fresh started the church his name means beloved god sent a beloved minister there amen that's what we all want to be ministers want to be a beloved minister amen one that god loves and that is true to god's word hallelujah but notice they didn't they didn't meet the prophet but they still enjoyed the prophet's word amen that's like us amen we didn't know the prophet we didn't see the prophet but we've got the prophet's word hallelujah right and he declared the love of them to paul they love paul's work they love paul's preaching they love the gospel of jesus christ because they knew it in truth aren't you glad church that god's rescued you out of denominational systems sure you are rescued out of there you know the grace of god and truth right they know the grace of god with air it's not real grace it's actually disgrace but you and i know it in a truth amen we've known the truth there's one faith one lord one baptism we know the truth god the word of god in truth praise god glory to god we're not getting a watered-down gospel we're not getting a gospel amen we're getting needy word of god something you can grow on something you can chew on something that will build up your spiritual muscles hallelujah amen that's exactly right church if not you already would have been too weak and you would have given up yeah you wouldn't be able to handle the pressures of life see your spiritual stronger amen your spiritual your spiritual muscles are exercised unto godliness amen amen i've been feeding on meat and milk just had a milk diet you wouldn't have been able to handle these waves of pressures that the devil is bringing in but because he brings them in god raises up strength against him hallelujah hallelujah thank god that proves you are eating on the meat of god's word and i am too because god doesn't let our enemies triumph over us i love that verse from the book of psalms ain't that hallelujah verse nine read that now look at verse nine it's a five-fold prayer i think that's beautiful five-fold prayer from a five-fold ministry that's right and there's a man that had all the five gifts of the holy s uh preaching i proved that a couple years ago by god's grace through the word of god and history he had all five gifts of the faithful ministry and here he gives a five-fold prayer for the saints now there it is but i'm just going to just skip ahead because i already preached it briefly now look at this saints god wants you to possess all that he has for you so look at here's the five things god paul prayed you would have knowledge of god's will in all wisdom remember wisdom is sound advice right it's what to do and how to do it right that's wisdom wisdom has built at her house again so wisdom knows how to get something done amen that's right true knowledge is just what you need to that's the materials to build the house but wisdom is how you do it amen it's how to do it when to do it when this per so so god god has paul prayed for you that we would know god's will with all wisdom and spiritual understanding what a prayer and church you can pray for me for that if you would amen pray that i'll have all the wisdom of god in spiritual understanding amen amen i'll pray amen bless the lord jesus because if church if we don't if you we don't choose wisdom what are we going to choose foolishness we're going to make a foolish mistake a foolish decision right wasting our time or wasting god's resources you know we're wasting we don't want to waste time we want to redeem time amen so second he prayed you would walk unto all pleasing so he wants you to have all wisdom he wants to have all pleasing you see the pattern here third he wants you fruitful and every good work or all works praise god it was everything you do to bring forth some type of fruit amen and he wants you increasing in the knowledge of god do you see any backsliding in here or any quitting or any any days off or do you see any of that in here no it's all increasing it's more wisdom more all-pleasing all works more knowledge of god this is a great prayer it's a prayer of a prophet amen and strengthened with what all might god want you to be as strong as you can possibly believe with all the might of god hallelujah unto us all patience with joy this is overwhelming this is this is concentrating truth brother how does a man get and how does a man get a vocabulary like this the only way he can get vocabulary like this is to see jesus christ face to face like he did in visions amen what what what kind of what kind of terminology is this this is divine oracles this is the mind of christ amen hallelujah all wisdom all pleasing all works more knowledge all night to all patients with joy amen i don't see any depression in there never nevermind i don't see any self-pity whoa it's me i've got it so hard i live in laodicea i don't like to see you much but god do we have to live in there to see him he chose the time we live amen this is his prayer that the saints would learn how to do this receive all of god's wisdom be all pleasing do every good work and have all the strength you need to have all the patience you need to have the joy a christian should have amen oh amen the church if paul would pray for it would would paul ever pray for something we can't possess no no so there's this this must be a way of life then for a christian praise god and since they only had 10 years to manifest it somebody in that church was going to manifest this prayer praise god does the bible say the prayers of the saints are stored up in vials glory that means this prayer amen was stored up in a vial praise god and it's going to be poured out someone's going to manifest this and let us say like this we can manifest it today because god said so amen you and i don't have to make foolish mistakes hallelujah we don't have to have works that are done in vain we don't have to be weak christians don't have to be complaining christians amen because paul prayed that we would have all of these spiritual needs amen everything we have need of god has it it just comes by foreign and prayer and believing and waiting and getting in the presence of god hallelujah what a prayer i just i can already wrap my reminder on that that prayer i'd have all the wisdom all the power i sound like superman after a while praise god like a spiritual like a spiritual superman like a statue of a man brother brandon says he said i'm here to make you spiritual powerhouses in your head that's what god is doing tonight he's making us powerhouses amen where we won't be weak we won't displease god we won't be foolish glory we won't decrease in our understanding of god our works won't be uh unprofitable but everything we do will please the lord [Music] now the bible say that we know all things work together for good yeah we can have all things that god promises and yeah and we know all things will work together to help that out right in other words everything's going to work together so i can be stronger then i can have all the mate everything's gonna work together so all my works can glorify god [Music] i don't have to make a bad choice and to bring shame on the church or bring shame on my family or i don't have to do that i can have the bible said all good works every good work amendment amen almighty unto all patients i can be patient with god i can have all the patience i need amen amen hallelujah this is a prayer and sometimes you might gloss over this trying to get ahead of what to the godhead part here in this chapter and these two mysteries in chapter one and two remember chapter one and two have two mysteries the baptism of the holy ghost and then the godhead there's two mysteries paul specifically calls them mysteries in the first two chapter we've got to be careful let's not skip over these beautiful prayers here by god's grace amen because he said i pray for you this i pray this for you every time all the time i'm always praying for them to be strong i'm always praying for them uh to have all the wisdom of god to do the will of god to be wise unto the things of god amen did not the bible say if god delivered jesus up for us all how should he not with him also freely give us all things [Music] so church if you need anybody need any of those things anyone need wisdom tonight or be pleasing to god or good works or knowledge or you need strength or patience or joy if you need it god's got it it's freely given praise god all you have to do is reject the reject the lie and accept the truth amen all you do is cast down evil imaginations and accept the word of god that's all you've got to do it's freely given amen open up the door of your house and let the word of god come in hallelujah feed the white dog tonight beat the white dog feed the white dog believe the word feed the white dog starve the black dog amen it's freely given to us so we can be spiritual powerhouses amen so see when ray and william are here is there such a more point i feel like i gotta scream and preach and start sweating you know one person makes a huge difference one person romans 8 37 name no in all these things we're more than conquerors amen through him that thank love he loves her so much he wants you to be all wise thank you lord he loves you so much he wants to give you all patience he loves you so much he wants everything you do to be fruitful he loves you so much he wants all these blessings poured out in your life so you can be a city on a hill so people can see what the works you've done and glorify god in heaven hallelujah church i get emails almost every day almost every day thanking me for our youtube ministry well that's you and i together every day people are saying thank you for this thank you for that thank you for that thank you for that thank you for that it's just a word we have a part in that glory people can see our works people can see our doctrine they can see our life and now you know from wednesday from sunday people are watching you from over 500 miles away and people love you 500 miles away don't ever forget that brother that's right don't forget that yeah satan tells you nobody loves you nobody cares about you people from chicago care about you people all over the nation care for you people in sheffield care for us amen people in live on iowa and pennsylvania people care for us all the time and god wants us to be strong in his mind hallelujah amen you're more than a conqueror verse romans 11 36 4 of him for of god or of christ through christ and to him are all things so everything we have need of is from him thanks god he's the one that's going to give us all things because of his love because this love here's another one i love this beautiful one with stats river man according to divine power given unto us how much all things that pertain unto life and godliness whatever we have need of in this life it's freely given to us amen church let me just say like this we have not because we there you go there you go there i go anything we need church is already laid out there bracelet it's like a table where where we just got a common feast on the children's bread amen it's like a feast and we just got to get up in the morning and go throughout the day and just feed on the things of god it's freely given nothing's holding us back except ourselves it's freely given all the strength all the power all the patience and it's possible because all things are possible to them that believe amen hallelujah anybody encourage you tonight praise god amen glory i am amen sure all things were given through the knowledge of him that hath called us to glory and virtue where is that i've never seen nature revert to you in eden and some of these bible names here glory exceeding great impressions these are exceedingly great and precious promises it's a promise that you could have all the patience you need that's a precious promise amen because your patience is going to be tested yes sure if it's not yet you just wait you just wait praise god you might wait a year five years ten twenty thirty and abraham seed said forty fifty it's gonna be tested but all patience is available to you praise god by divine and great and precious promise that by these you partake of the divine nature so when you say lord i'm going to be i'm going to accept your wisdom in this decision i'm going to follow your word you have just enjoyed and partaken and tasted of divine nature amen [Music] the divine nature of god you've tasted it you've experienced it praise god we're not like those in hebrews 6 that just partake of it and then after a while you know they uh they give up on the promise of god and paul says it's impossible for them to ever ever come back you know we're not like those we're ones that keep partaking amen we eat from the table and we come back wednesday we eat again we come back sunday we eat again we are continually partaking of the life of god of the food of god this divine nature and we become more like christ all the time amen hallelujah thank you jesus yes glory hallelujah you are tasting on the divine nature sure like i'll just share that little testimony from yesterday with your friend i'm going to try to be very general there's a friend that our daughters had who was contemplating suicide and so our girls actually got to see her yesterday it was all their day to god and they just waited on the lord right wink wink they just waited on the lord for the right time they could tell the person was really struggling this this girl and one by one they went up and hugged her and said i just want to tell you i love you right and then there was two or three or right bugs in a row praise god amos that's it that is not human nature that's god's nature yeah that's right that's right is that right cherry is god's nature that's love amen it bears all things it holds all things eternal life is living for others and showing others love praise god and when you show love you make a sacrifice and you show love what is this showing it's showing you are partaking you are feasting at the king's table you're eating his bread you're drinking his water you're his life is being lived through you hallelujah thank god praise the lord hallelujah or when you stay up texting somebody pleading with them not to commit suicide oh and praying for them by god yeah that's partaking of the divine nature you're out here man because we know the other nature we've heard stories from people like yeah just end your life and you're like yeah i've heard stories about that there's been on the news and things like what an awful wicked yeah spirit of death but that's the human nature that's the animal nature we are not of that nature we have better promises amen we have great and precious promises to express eternal life and charity and love and we are partakers of that tonight hallelujah [Music] so according to verse 11 god wants to give you strength to manifest all patience and every good gift i have a hard time this is such a deep scripture it's like god is in every area when we're walking to obedience god is in everything that we do so sister is using the meal you put on the table that's right did you want laundry you did sure sure is that building patients when you have to do laundry load after laundry level am i preaching down to the level of the system those hard days sure all right brother's got to go out there and mow the grass [Music] got to go to work one more time do some extra overtime to pay off the bill you know wash your broken i gotta work a little more you know it just it's this desire that that in every area of our life we can grow to be more of a servant we can be more humble we can become more like christ hallelujah amen every good gift every word always increasing in the knowledge of god so that's what my question is how many services or how much time is needed to receive the full strength of patience if i'm supposed to have all the might of god how many is that going to take well it's probably not going to take a number of services probably just a daily life that you live each day you choose to accept god's grace each day you walk and strafe like i had a brother i was at that i was at the graduation party for my niece and i had a man call me up and he said i don't know what is it about you but you were so happy there he said i was ashamed of myself i wanted to be happy like you or something along those lines he's like you were just going up to everybody it's like you had to talk to every person now sometimes that's not a good thing but he said now in my heart life you know i wasn't happy about everything in my heart life but i knew there was people there that didn't have much faith and i had to make sure i go i tried to condescend to the ones that people weren't going to on purpose the holy spirit put that on my heart and i prayed with my uncle and nobody was around him and i just tried to show him some love and he's going to have surgery i just try to increase his faith and say god is with you let me pray for you i join hands with my aunt uncle pray for them he's like okay might as well try it i'm like well god can do great things if you just believe right trying to rebuke that spirit off him pray that spirit often by god's grace but even a man will call me up and say why are you so happy and why can't i i want to be like that it's the love of god amen it's an everyday thing where you you want to all your work you want to magnify jesus you want to show the love of jesus christ because he first loved you praise god amen hallelujah it's a lifestyle so see we should receive all the strength and might on two not unto can mean two or until so we can receive all the strength until we have all patience with long suffering and joy that is that's that's the core of his prayer god give me more strength until i have all the strength to be patient and joyful so when god doesn't answer my prayer in the prayer line right away i can still come on wednesday and give god glory because i know he heard my prayer and i've gotten stronger now i can be joyful i can be patient waiting on god amen amen and i'm putting myself in there too high prayer requests that i pray for i'm still waiting on them sure years years later sure they are yeah and remember we're abraham's seed yeah right sarah what does she do she receives strength that's how she that's how we'll do it that's how she did it we'll receive strength to conceive seed hallelujah to receive the promise of god amen that's right church so verse 12. here we get some new reading first of all giving thanks unto the father so now that we've got our fivefold prayer here from the fivefold minister who had all five gifts now he's one of the i wants to give thanks here's the prayer i pray for he tells us he tells us i always pray for you here's here's how i pray for you that you'll manifest all these things and then he says i'm going to give thanks to the father because he's made us meet which is equipped with adequate power to perform duties so god father has made us equipped to be partakers in other words he's he's rendered a spit to be partakers or to have a portion or share of the inheritance of the saints in light amen oh that's written these i mean if you really write these down we just skim over these right i gotta read my chapter these are thick and rich and meaty praise god think about that i'm giving thanks to god he made you adequate to have a share of the heavenly inheritance of this age amen we couldn't do it ourselves we couldn't earn heavenly inheritance no if if we could we wouldn't need jesus right but jesus made a way that we could have something up in heaven amen in other words he defeated death he defeated satan he defeated all these demon powers so that we can overcome amen and that we can get a few victories out here by god's grace and then have some portion of inheritance up in amen he equipped us for that praise god he said i'm gonna i have all this i have this eternal amount of glory and i'm gonna give sister lena a share of that i'm to give lydia a share of that inheritance i've got a real small share for brother jesse thank god i just want a little share praise god that's what we all we just want we just want to share yeah glory and so we just thank god he's equipped us to have a portion he's made us with uh the ability to have a share of this inheritance thank you lord in other words there's a mansion for you over yonder america i go to prepare a place for you sure if it wasn't so i would have told you praise god very bad but i go to prepare a place that where i am you may be awesome what's he saying i want to be in eternity with your sister who that's what jesus is saying i want to be with you all throughout eternity that's what he's saying to all of us amen i want to be with you for eternity amen that's the love of god hallelujah and i equipped you so you can have that place with me for eternity god help me to see this help me to remember this when i go through trials like that he made me equipped oh i have some heavenly inheritance in other words i couldn't have any inheritance unless he gave me the power to get it [Applause] yeah it's just like a farm if you if we're farmers god gave us the god gave us he gave us the seed he gave us the the gardening tools he gave us the ground he gave us the soil it's just a perfect example of that that's how it is god gave us the ability he gave us the physical strength we can walk we can see he give us the nice weather the sunlight he gives us the rain he gives us everything everything we have is from him he equipped us to have a portion of heaven hallelujah oh god that's what brother man was told by the holy spirit a man spoke in tongues and interpreted i kept maybe a sister spoke in tongues and a man interpreted and brother i wrote it down it said because you picked the correct and precise decision sounds like all wisdom to me like paul's prayer i pray that you have all wisdom it is my way bless god's my way said because of this momentous decision a huge portion of heaven awaits thee hallelujah so because brother graham chose the harder way not the way with the nominations not the way with

christ amen praise god and there's a large portion of heaven awaiting him i believe that by god's grace verse 13. now here's the part i like i like this part here i'm going to smile during this part here what did jesus do he delivered us from the power of darkness amen oh hallelujah and he's translated us into the kingdom of his dear son so first he equipped us first he gave us the equipment that we needed to have a heavenly home praise god then he comes around and he rescues us from the power of darkness that's right you and i had got stuck in sin you and i got ourselves in sin we were trapped in sin and jesus christ came and rescued you from your sin addiction amen he rescued you from the power of hell and he transferred or changed your situation or place he picked you up out of that muck and he placed you in a good location amen and plan two by streams of rivers of living water praise god hallelujah that's what colossians 1 says amen you were in a dark spiritual place but then god gave you the tools he gave you everything you need and then he picks you up out of the awful place and then he sets you down in a place of light he set you down in a place where you can use those tools where god can use you when you can be all wise you can have all power all patience god did that god rescued you praise god god rescued me church god certainly rescued austin that's for

who's actually got some singing talent because i don't know but it's hunting the rock in whom in jesus we have redemption so when jesus come and picked you up and rescued you he was actually releasing a payment for your ransom that's what colossians says he paid a price to pick you up take you out of the power of darkness he paid the price and then now you're purchased now there's no debt on your account now you belong to him so he can do with you whatever he wants and i'll say jesus do with me whatever you want to do with me praise god place me wherever you want to place me plant me wherever

is all about rescue stories i thought i saw that word rescue i'm like there's got to be rescues in the bible abraham hears that his nephew's taken over and he says all right what was it 316 300 what was it 318 i'm off by two all right there that's he's my second i remember he's like get up boys get up come on it's time to go get a lot back he's lost everything he's a prisoner he can't save himself praise god let's go save him let's go rescue him praise god and so a bunch of shepherds with shepherd staffs go against five kings amen and they whip up praise god they were mighty men why because the mighty way the mighty one was in them praise god and god rescues them out of their slavery right because that's what god is he's a rescuer he's a savior amen he's the deliverer praise god 318 men whip five kings was it four might have been four games i've been four i think it was four because of the i typed into the four horse riders and the four insects i think that's why it's my second memory later rehab needed rescued it's all right she's going to die everybody's going to die and so god knew there was a little gentile pride in there lived an awful life but god said if there's just one person that's going to believe i'm going to rescue you that's how it is today church the world's getting awful awful but if there's some more left god is going to rescue the righteous souls amen hallelujah so he rescues them he rescues her with a scarlet core with a token glory the token has rescued you say like that the baptism of the holy ghost brings your rescuing just apply the tokens just apply the token apply the blood hang and hang it out publicly let the world see you're a real believer and you'll be rescued amen amen it's the word of god amen god specializes in rescuing people that's right and the bible said he already did rescue you yes so why [Music] hallelujah thank god yes they even rescued his entire family ziklin yeah and all the mighty men were going to kill him remember that all right they said how could you do this you're the one that caught us away from our families and now they're all taken let's kill him and so what does he do he goes out of a pity

right there jesus hallelujah thank you lord amen four thousand years hallelujah well that's just a few stories of rescue here's what he rescued you from george he rescued you from the wrong course you and i were walking the wrong path you were in that pit when you were going the wrong way you were going totally away from god you were on the wrong path and the bible said why are you doing it you are obeying the spirit of satan yes in disobedience no i'm going to obey the preacher no i don't want nothing to do with the bible right i don't want to hear that message i don't know don't talk about john 3 16 i want to live my life i'm going to do what i want to do you used to walk in that course right the bible said all ever say already raised the message i don't care if you're raised in jerusalem right i don't care if you were raising bread i'm tabernacle right all of us walked to the chorus of this world amen hallelujah and you were just making everything every decision by the lust of your flesh why this would feel good all right i desire this my mind desires this lust and you were by nature the children of wrath which means god's anger you were a child of god's anger that's what the bible says and then in that condition where you're fighting against god you're i don't want to obey in that condition the goodness of god comes to you you hear a preacher for me it was i heard a song ffh one of these days i'm going to see the hands that took the nails from me i heard that and then all of a sudden it starts changing my heart and he comes and rescues me and pulls me back all the other way and sets me positionally in this kingdom of god that's what i was rescued from wonderful and young people listen to me that's what you're gonna get rescued from too yes right hallelujah true if you haven't been yet already glory i've got a couple that haven't been baptized yet but they're coming up my gospels give a few more years to the friends of the lord you know my gospel we can create the atmosphere very man grace this is what i was rescued from hallelujah he's delivered me from the power of darkness he's rescued me and transferred me changed me into the kingdom of light [Music] but god was rich in mercy so i was course of the power of the air the wicked god's rich mercy with his great love when i was dead in sins he quickened us together with christ great love hallelujah grace ye are saved god's love is matches he and he brought me into the marvelous light amen hallelujah [Music] hallelujah how do you do it by his great love that's how he did it amen it's great love rescued me now we're getting chapter one here colossians one i'm going somewhere with this so just bear with me here about halfway through the sermon here we go verse 15 who is the image christ is the image of the invisible god yes he is the firstborn of every now look every creature yeah sure that means angel right jesus was the firstborn the first creature yeah created right it was this visible spirit yeah the spirit just took on a visible form that's good jesus that's good right yeah because god's invisible you can never and will never be able to see god right so jesus spirit is only god's spirit now made visible praise god we call this the logos or the word the visible spirit was the firstborn of every creature or creation right right so before there was uh molecules or before there was uh atoms or before there was planets or seas or stars there was jesus that's right there was the love of god amen out of darkness came light yeah for by him all things were created that means jesus created you yeah i'm one of all things jesus created me sure in heaven and earth visible and invisible whether they be thrones or dominions principalities powers all things were created by him and for i was made for jesus jesus made me for him amen sure he needed a real simple kind of flighty preacher not very smart spit a lot and so he chose me for him does not get to be what i need to be for him now now you describe yourself how would you describe yourself i'm the most handsome i'm the most i'm the prettiest ever was i'm the greatest of all time you were created by him for him glory and he is before all things and by him all things consist or stay set in their place in other words you're here tonight because god is consisting you god is keeping you here praise god amen hallelujah you're staying in the faith because god positioned you in the face amen the devil can't take you out because god placed you in amen no i'm consistent i'm staying in place i'm strong i'm more than a conqueror because he placed me there amen glory it was not jesus flesh it was his spirit that was before all things that's right right and his spirit keeps everything right in place yeah praise god when you felt like quitting felt like giving up what kept you in place it was jesus amen sure sure you felt like you're a failure who kept you in the faith oh yeah he said i made you jess i'm not gonna let you fail i'm not gonna those thoughts those aren't my thoughts those are the devil's thoughts you're right just cast those down right he made you for it he made you and he made you for him praise god amen you're gonna make it through just keep just keep going just keep praying keep repent you're gonna make it through i'm with you i'm for you there's nothing there's no weapon that's formed against you will prosper against you amen you're gonna make it through praise god hallelujah that's right he's consisting us he's making us consist stay in our position has he not kept brother william in the message for was it 40 years brother how have you consisted how have we consisted it's been god's grace all right i remember right past 40 years 40 years of the message a few years ago i was preaching on that one night and he said i said how many years was it brother he said 40 years that's what i was preaching on number four remember that let's reach out to the number 40. i asked you how many years spent the message you said yeah god knows what he's doing praise god see god's going to keep you in your place amen now these are uh old old quotes i preached from years ago but brother ham said god he's the only person that can be immortal god changing himself into a person okay the bible says jesus is the king of kings he's the only one with immortality yeah and he dwells in the light yeah which no man can approach unto you right no man have seen it nor can see so the light is the logos the holy spirit but god is inside of that right praise god that's why jesus is god yeah because the spirit of jesus is the spirit of god praise god amen but the light is a separate manifestation that can be seen you can't see the father but you can see the sun glory that's right he's eternal immortal invisible the only wise god so god is the spirit he's invisible no man's ever seen him ever will and god's spirit dwelled in the body of jesus for the body is the visible image of the invisible god so god the father the spirit was made visible in jesus body for jesus said when you see me using the father sure jesus is the express image or the exact reproduction of the person of god so he's not a second person he's the visible image of the one person amen amen hey man no it's interesting i had somebody had a thought with me i don't know who it was when the serpent was lying to adam would when sermon was lying to eve he said if you take this fruit you'll be like gods well if if they thought that that was going to make three gods right because there was only one god he says if you sin now you're gonna now you're gonna be gods now they're gonna have a trinity and that that's something i just thought that was somebody shared that with me like that's a pretty good thought right there satan was deceiving them until they could be like some type of a trinity or something like that like they could actually get higher than the way god already made them they couldn't they're already perfect they already were lowercase gods right they're already lowercase anointed ones that's what it means messiahs gods is probably not a good word to use because god means object to worship so i don't know i don't use that word very much i use messiahs we're little anointed ones amen now for time's sake here loretta said let's take a trip back to the beginning a hundred million years before there ever was a star moon or anything there was a time when there wasn't nothing here it was all forever in eternity and all ever eternity was god he was there in the beginning let's go out here on the edge of the banister and look over and see these things happen yeah so paul's writing in colossians 1 about jesus jesus created all things he was before all things and all things were made for him so my man said let's go look over the banister and see what happened no man has seen the father in any time no man can see god in the body form because god's in not in bodily form god's a spirit sure no man has seen god at any time but the son hath declared him right when you've seen jesus you've seen the father right [Applause] he said there's no light no dark there's nothing it seems nothing there's a great supernatural being jehovah god he covered all space in all places of time he was from everlasting everlasting he's the beginning of the creation that's god can't see nothing can't hear nothing not a move of adam yet god was there he said that was god the father so before even day one of creation before time and days and what could be seen in the human dimensions that's what we're looking at now what happened before day one that's right yeah after a while we're gonna see a little sacred light begin to form yeah like a little halo or something yeah you can only see it by spiritual eyes to look now he said we're standing on the great big banister right so before day one there's that filler of fire sure there's that halo right this and then this pillar of fire makes everything this is the sun therefore you cannot have life time or days without first having the sun so this is a spiritual light and this made the natural sunlight see no one has seen god next by spiritual looking we see a little white light forming out there what is it it's called the logos the anointing the anointing the part of god began to develop into something so human beings could have some type of idea what it was it was a little light moving that was the word of god hey man so that little light has a lot of different names everybody say five names actually there might be six here yeah logos word anointing theophany of god son of god a visible form of the holy spirit sorry six names you could really call logos though the word because that's what the word logos means word a word utterly right so at least five names is going to be technical it's all the same thing yeah the beginning was the anointing lord and the anointing was with god [Applause] thank you jesus i love what the program says god gave himself birth to this god gives himself birth to this god births his own son why because god is both feminine and especially yeah right because again when god made an image of himself he made adam both male and female yeah god has masculine parts that's right got his feminine parts yeah right god can help himself can he not right god can be submissive can he not yeah he let's say do all this stuff on the earth right he's very personal of course he doesn't let it happen without his consent but he still lets it happen this is where jesus talked about glorifying me with the glory we had amen amen that light that logos light had glory with the invisible god inside of them amen hallelujah amen that's right the bible jesus said father you love me for the foundation of the world that's right father and son were there before the foundation of the world amen member church he made you and loved you he loved you so he could use you very man you're made for his purpose that's right so before day one it was already there yeah we already had the logos the logos the great light made this lesser light yeah then the logos made heavens to divide the waters and the logos made the land sea plant life all made by jesus all right day four sun moon stars not like the sun the sun wasn't even there we're gonna look at that just a moment it's good day five jesus made the water animals and the birds and then on day six he finally made us the height of his creation is that right the height of it i listened to a preacher the other day and he said when the eyeballs are actually formed in the in the womb there's 100 million there's i'm sorry there's a million nerves on one side of the eye and there's and then there's a million on the other side and i think this is in the first month of a month after conception in the womb or maybe it's like two months i don't quote me on that i don't know anyways there's a million nerves and they each have an opposite pair they have to connect with in order for the eye to work the eye is the most complex body part in the entire universe yeah the eye but that's why the bible says the lord form the eye hallelujah amen and by some miraculous way some intelligence hallelujah jesus made you church amen by jesus intelligence all million of those can find their matching pair in order so that you don't see bad you see light you see perfect you see color you see clear a million different opposites all interweave together find the right match and they all do it so you can see lightning [Applause] [Music] blessed be the lord hallelujah all his wisdom amen what he made you for his sake he made you for a purpose sure sure he did i'm gonna skip past this i preached those before so i'm going to close to this all things were created by him amen and for him amen the bible said by the word of the lord were the heavens made and all the host of them by the breath of his mouth what wait what every star every planet earth water air oxygen bees turtles doves lambs americans africans europeans all made by what the breath of god just the breath all right what does your breath do i mean i'm sure it does something but his breath made all the entire universe even just his breath amen that's why the bible says if he want to come down brother william he could melt the mountains with his presence if he wanted to because his breath breathed out the sun brother what was it 100 it was 10 000 degrees fahrenheit on the surface of the sun that just came out of his mouth now our breath gets pretty hot you know but god is so hot he can breathe out a sun and not just one out of trillions one out of trillions amen and we can't if we were any closer to the south we die and that's just one of them can you feel god's love a little bit tonight not his hands his breath now think about it also he said when i saved you lord when i rescued you he said i just rescued my breath he said i'll put you on my shoulders [Music] the strongest part of the man is his shoulders amen and when he rescued us church he picked us up and places on his shoulders and brought us back to the full brother's eye the key held our father into the kingdom of the lord amen thank you lord thank you father we had a good time he wanted to preach some things to me so he preached he wrote all his notes out and preached to me for about two hours it's pretty good i like i said amen to most of it it was good but he also wanted me to watch this video so i watched most of you don't watch all of it but i'm gonna show it to you tonight just so you can see again you've probably seen it before just two minute clip my battery's really good okay now let's just look at the size of just the let's look at some the size of the planets and the stars real quick okay there's mercury the smallest of the ones in our galaxy now remember church the bible said he what he breathed these out of his mouth mercury then he goes and we'll get later he's going to go venus earth you just all come out of his mouth put your head out front and just go like just blow on your hand that's what god did he made his son what does yours do nothing actually does give carbon dioxide to the plants if we want to be tempted that's about all does or torments people with our bad breath but not god when god's breath goes out it creates silence holidays we say like this it also creates sons and daughters amen and great sons and daughters who love jesus christ and the kingdom of life [Applause] that's hallelujah jesus went and breathed on him he said receive you the holy ghost receive you the holy ghost receive you the holy ghost he breathes on us the same breath that breathed out and and fire would breathe out spiritual fire amen fill them with the holy ghost of the day of pentecost amen hallelujah glory hallelujah let's see how big let's see how big we are let's see how small we are you gonna play here sorry i didn't mean to rewind that i was better with this i fast forward now this guy's a nice guy but i liked him for a while but then he went and kissed the pope's ring and you can watch it on youtube you know okay there that mercury so god breathed out mars then he breathed out venus he probably did it all at one time actually then he there they breathe out us now look we're bigger than those three but now look here god brings out neptune then he breathes out saturn then he breathes out now really you can see earth there but in real life you wouldn't be able to say see earth did you know almost a million earths fit inside one sun there's like 900 000 some earths can fit into one side and god did all this by going and that's the god that made you for his purpose because it is love for you amen god loves amen it's the god we serve yeah so great all right lori a million first get fit inside now who's the big guy who's the greatest of all time who even cares who the greatest of all time is at this point the greatest of all time on the earth is so tidy compared to one son and god has trillions come on now trillions of sons that's why the bible says god will not share his glory with anybody hallelujah just trying to keep us humble trying to stay humble hallelujah now even bigger than the sun so a millionaire spit in here serious it's almost two sons i'm here to go pollux none of these i can't tell you anything other than their names look at this arcturus can anybody see us anymore are we even in the picture if you look at the whole thing of the universe we're hardly even in the picture i'll tell you like this you're still in the mind of god amen glory in this great big creation god never forget about you praise god you only put life on one little planet and that's where he said he was chosen you in him before the foundation of the world hallelujah when all these were breathing out he said there's going to be a bride in the last days they're going to be a bride for ephesus a ride for smyrna pergamos thyrotira glory sardis philadelphia and there's going to be a large bride amen i made her for me and by me and she will be raptured she's what i've done she's what i made to be raptured and this last day i'm finishing the church with her hallelujah amen beetlejuice antares i think this is the last one no move stuffy west cefi this is the biggest one they found but they keep they keep searching for more okay that's the end let's get back to that scripture let's read that again now a little more understanding of how great god is did anybody see earth anymore by that last name when you see earth anywhere we are so small yeah we're so tiny insignificant of what we think yeah but god loved us so much he sent a rescue before amen he loved us so much he said i'm going to rescue them with my son hallelujah thank you jesus i'm going to send a rescuer to that player of [Applause] to rescue my people amen amen said thank you by god's foreknowledge he knew you'd love him and because he knew you'd love him he made a probituation for you he made a payment to pay for your sins hallelujah amen glory i love that quote praise god hallelujah and all the host of them were by the breath of his mouth let there be a venus earth who did that jesus the god we're singing to tonight church amen god we're trying to we're trying to understand colossians his bible tonight god breathed all that out bless the lord bless his holy name beetlejuice hallelujah canis majoris the biggest one the scientists abound so far and we are not even like a tip of a little pen clothespin compared to that one and yet god sent his word to you it's beautiful yes at church he heals the broken in heart he bindeth up their wounds yes he does he tells the number of the stars scientists can't even count the number right now sure and he calls them all by names you know we have eight kids sometimes it was hard to find out a name i was running out of names this one's been used that one's been used sometimes we were really nervous but god never runs out of names amen great is our lord and greatest power his understanding is infinite now church if god can create innumerable numbers of stars he can certainly heal us of our finite little natural problems or spiritual problems that's the kind the context is he heals everything because he can number he names all the stars if he can handle all the stars names he can handle your your trouble thus saith the lord he said i said lord i was giving up i've made the earth and i created man upon it yeah i even my hands have stretched out the

great is the son of amen if his stars are so great and their names are so great how great are his thoughts about you when the stars can't even be redeemed the stars can't repent they can't sin they can't i mean they're going to praise god just because but they don't have a soul how important are we to god the only planet of all those stars the only place where there's life is that one little that one tiny one that fits in a million of the other one and that one probably is like a million of the other big wood if i should count all god's thoughts about lydia they are more number than the sand when i awake i am still with me praise god hallelujah hallelujah amen i already believe the bible today see this is such a it's such a beautiful chapter blessed is the man that maketh the lord
