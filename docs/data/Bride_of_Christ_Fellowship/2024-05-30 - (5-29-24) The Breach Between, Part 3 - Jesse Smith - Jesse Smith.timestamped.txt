[0:00] part three Revelation chapter 5 verse
[0:03] one by God's grace Revelation 5 verse
[0:26] one Revelation 5
[0:28] verse1 I've been in contact with brother
[0:30] McBride so we're looking forward to
[0:32] having him come and he'll be here on the
[0:34] weekend of the 22nd and 23rd we'll
[0:36] probably have like I said just a couple
[0:38] special prayer meetings in there and in
[0:40] preparation for our brother coming it's
[0:41] our 18th anniversary Services by God's
[0:44] grace to me might not mean much to you
[0:46] but it means a lot to me because I think
[0:48] back in WoW God's carried me for 18
[0:50] years Hallelujah he's held me steady so
[0:52] I wouldn't
[0:53] fall just another one of those Miracles
[0:56] hallelujah hallelujah the Bible said to
[0:58] him is who is able to keep you from
[1:00] falling hallelujah thank God for his
[1:02] grace and mercy Hallelujah so Revelation
[1:04] chapter 5 uh
[1:06] verse one by God's grace I'm going to
[1:10] start with a thought brother Paul
[1:11] preached and I got
[1:13] uh I got a message from the east or I'm
[1:16] sorry yeah the West Coast rather um a
[1:19] person who listened in and was just
[1:21] blessed by that sermon uh Sunday morning
[1:25] and then I'm sure we're all blessed by
[1:27] the Sunday evening service but uh that
[1:29] brother brother was he said it brought
[1:31] him such joy to hear about the New
[1:32] Covenant just the Simplicity of it and
[1:35] he was so happy he sang me a song on
[1:37] there he was clapping and singing I'm
[1:39] like Glory you're making me happy you
[1:40] know but just amazing to see you know
[1:43] can preach it here in Ohio they can get
[1:44] it out there on the west coast and send
[1:46] it back to me encourage me on a
[1:48] Wednesday morning you know so uh it's a
[1:50] blessing to see how God uses technology
[1:53] and also to how he spreads the word of
[1:55] God
[1:56] hallelujah so Revelation 5 vers1
[2:00] we'll just read verses one and two by
[2:02] God's grace when brother R preached this
[2:04] you know he spent uh quite a while just
[2:06] on the first verse as we're as we're
[2:08] looking at these last few weeks with
[2:10] Revelation 10 and the Book of Ruth um
[2:13] and Jeremiah you know brother Ram talked
[2:15] all that on verse one that was all on
[2:17] verse one so he spends the majority on
[2:20] verse one and then he spends the rest of
[2:22] the time on verse two down through the
[2:25] end believe it's uh
[2:27] 14 so let's read verse 1 and 2 together
[2:30] one 2 3 and I saw in the right hand of
[2:34] him that sat upon the throne a book
[2:37] written within and on the backside
[2:40] sealed with Seven Seals and I saw a
[2:43] strong angel proclaiming with a loud
[2:46] voice who is worthy to open the book and
[2:50] to lose the seals thereof amen sounds
[2:52] good with all these voices in here
[2:53] hallelujah let's have a word of prayer
[2:55] if you have any need on your heart let's
[2:56] make it known unto God here father God
[2:57] we thank you for tonight Lord God we're
[2:59] thankful Lord God that we can cast our
[3:00] cares on you we can count our blessings
[3:02] because you care for us Lord God we're
[3:04] thankful for your love your mercy thank
[3:06] you for providing all things Lord thank
[3:08] you for taking our uh weights Lord of
[3:11] burdens Lord thank you God that we can
[3:13] cast them on you because you care for us
[3:15] Lord God hallelujah so Lord just take
[3:17] this word here tonight that we've read
[3:18] Lord and just break it to your people as
[3:20] we bring out the truth of the scripture
[3:22] and father I know we'll be bless when we
[3:24] leave this place father so we thank you
[3:25] for your mercy and Grace in Jesus
[3:27] Christ's name everybody said amen God
[3:29] bless bless you you being seated praise
[3:34] God all right so I'm going just briefly
[3:36] review um last week you know we had the
[3:39] next weekend there um last week we
[3:42] looked at how brother Brandon brought
[3:43] out the idea of serpent seed out of
[3:45] chapter 5 and the idea that reveals the
[3:49] serpent seed is that uh no man was
[3:52] worthy to even look upon the book no man
[3:54] at all and so uh and then we know of
[3:57] course the story how a lamb comes forth
[3:59] and we know that lamb was Jesus Christ
[4:01] he was born of a virgin so brother BR
[4:03] brings this out that it had to been the
[4:05] seed of the woman it could not been a
[4:07] seed of a man had been the seed of a
[4:09] woman which is the Holy Ghost giving the
[4:11] woman a seed right Mary Allelujah the
[4:14] Holy Ghost gave Mary the seed of Jesus
[4:17] right uh nothing to do with Joseph and
[4:19] Mary it was all God hallelujah it's
[4:21] called the Immaculate Conception
[4:23] hallelujah amen and so brother BR says
[4:25] serpent seed is in plain view in chapter
[4:29] 5 because Jesus Jesus is the only virgin
[4:31] born uh man person Hallelujah he's the
[4:34] Divine person the sinless one Hallelujah
[4:36] the Son of God hallelujah the son of man
[4:38] son of David Hallelujah and so we looked
[4:41] at that as element of it and we saw how
[4:43] sin came in the world through lust so
[4:46] second Peter 1:4 tells us that that's
[4:48] how sin entered the world of course it
[4:50] was Eve's lust uh we'd say of the
[4:54] adulterous act with the serpent now
[4:56] brother Bram said that's the killer that
[4:58] Doctrine is the killer that one was
[4:59] separate almost all Fellowship unless
[5:01] people got a lot of Grace in their heart
[5:03] right uh but that's okay because we know
[5:06] the scriptures praise God we know that
[5:08] eating an apple doesn't cause anybody to
[5:09] know they're naked right and we know all
[5:12] of God's we know those nine proofs don't
[5:13] we Hallelujah we know uh every time
[5:17] every uh consequence was in
[5:20] reproduction right so God doesn't just
[5:22] give consequences unless there's a
[5:24] meaning to them so Eve sinned with her
[5:26] reproductive organs that's why God uh
[5:29] gave the consequ is there Hallelujah and
[5:31] that's why here in Revelation 5 only one
[5:34] person's worthy it had to be someone who
[5:36] was not born of the seat of a man had to
[5:38] be born the seed of God hallelujah God
[5:41] gave it to the woman right God gave it
[5:43] to Eve Hallelujah so it's beautiful
[5:45] thought there I never you know I it's
[5:47] been it's been a while since I listened
[5:48] to the sermon and I told you for the
[5:51] last maybe 10 years or so I put that
[5:53] thought on the Shelf brother Ram would
[5:54] say when when the Seven Seals were loose
[5:57] the serpent seed was revealed and
[5:59] brother William I scratched my head for
[6:01] 10 years I don't get it I'm just putting
[6:03] that up on the shelf and then two Sunday
[6:05] mornings ago God gave me the
[6:06] understanding as I'm driving to church
[6:08] amen that we see the serpent seed in
[6:10] chapter five it was a virgin born Christ
[6:13] Hallelujah it couldn't have been born of
[6:15] a man a woman had to been a virgin uh
[6:18] virgin born and so uh beautiful how you
[6:21] just lay things up on the shelf and God
[6:22] will answer in his time and season
[6:24] Hallelujah so we're thankful for that
[6:26] and then we saw how God purchased the
[6:28] church uh with his creative blood and
[6:30] that's what we saw in Revelation 5 a
[6:32] lamb that's bloody as it had been slain
[6:35] and we saw that's not Jewish blood
[6:37] that's not Gentile blood that's the
[6:38] creative blood of God hallelujah that's
[6:41] according to acts 20: 28 and then we
[6:44] looked at Jeremiah Hallelujah this is a
[6:45] beautiful double type here in
[6:48] Jeremiah of how uh the Scrolls had to be
[6:52] uh they had to have evidences of the
[6:54] purchase so the land had to be purchased
[6:56] from uh Jeremiah's uncle
[7:00] if I'm not mistaken I could be wrong on
[7:02] that one maybe it's uncle's son but uh
[7:05] there had to be an Evidence of the
[7:06] purchase and then the evidence had to be
[7:08] sealed until a later time that it could
[7:11] be possessed at a later time and brother
[7:14] Bram said that spoke of Christ
[7:16] Hallelujah Christ had to pay the price
[7:18] he had to die Hallelujah and then he had
[7:20] to be buried away amen for three days
[7:22] amen hallelujah then he had to rise and
[7:25] then the The Possession could be could
[7:28] could be possessed right then the
[7:29] promises the the the Revelation could be
[7:31] revealed on the day of Pentecost amen 50
[7:34] days later Hallelujah on the day of
[7:36] Pentecost uh we we say the Revelation
[7:38] was made known and then the Believers
[7:40] could possess the promises Hallelujah
[7:42] now the other type is for our day let me
[7:45] say it like this this this might be a
[7:47] little uh new to you but the Bible had
[7:50] to be written John had to write the Book
[7:52] of Revelation and then it had to just
[7:55] lay dormant for a while right we never
[7:57] had thus sayith the Lord on the Book of
[7:58] Revelation or the S con seals had to lay
[8:00] dormant for almost 2,000 years until God
[8:04] brought that back up and gave the
[8:06] Revelation to brother brandham brother
[8:07] Ram gives us the Revelation says that's
[8:09] thus sayith the Lord and now we can
[8:11] possess the promises of God hallelujah
[8:13] amen my glory that's beautiful see it's
[8:16] a double uh compound prophecy Hallelujah
[8:19] that's Jeremiah 3214 and 15 pardon me
[8:22] are the main verses I think it's 6
[8:24] through 15 so it's just a beautiful type
[8:27] there of
[8:28] Pentecost uh and then also the opening
[8:30] of The Seven seal book in Revelation
[8:32] chapter 5 six and then it goes to 8 and
[8:36] 10 we see this book open praise God oh
[8:39] what a beautiful Revelation my that all
[8:41] make us happy tonight Hallelujah and
[8:43] then we ended with brother R's Story how
[8:44] the lion roaring you know John looked
[8:46] and saw he looked for a lion but he seen
[8:48] a lamb and brother R said that's God
[8:50] hiding himself in Simplicity there's a
[8:53] little bloody lamb there with seven
[8:55] horns and seven eyes and God says that's
[8:57] a lion hallelujah amen other words
[8:59] there's power there's boldness in the
[9:01] Lamb of God
[9:03] hallelujah right didn't Jesus say all
[9:05] power and authority is given unto me
[9:07] hallelujah amen so he looks weak like a
[9:10] lamb like a lamb that's been slain but
[9:12] he's got the mighty power of God he's
[9:13] got Authority Hallelujah and if Jesus
[9:15] tells us one word then all all all
[9:18] creation will have to to submit itself
[9:20] to that word nothing can stop that word
[9:22] that word cannot return void hallelujah
[9:25] amen see that boness behind the lamb see
[9:27] the lion behind the lamb Hall
[9:30] right oh it's beautiful praise God and
[9:32] brother BR said uh he said that's what
[9:34] happens he told that story of going out
[9:35] in the African jungles and all the
[9:37] animals were squealing and and all the
[9:40] bugs were making noises but as soon as
[9:41] that line roared everything shut up and
[9:44] brother bam said that's when
[9:45] denominations and doubts fall to the
[9:47] ground when we get thus sayeth the Lord
[9:49] from the Bible hallelujah amen brother
[9:52] bam said thus sayith the Lord if you
[9:54] haven't been baptized in the name of the
[9:55] Lord Jesus Christ be re-baptized he said
[9:58] because the father son holy ghost is a
[9:59] false baptism thus sayith the Lord
[10:03] hallelujah because we got five Bible
[10:04] examples in the book of Acts Hallelujah
[10:06] where they only use the name of the Lord
[10:08] the Lord Jesus Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[10:11] so it's the Revelation that's the name
[10:13] of God there is one name to the father
[10:15] son Holy Ghost that's the Lord Jesus
[10:17] Christ Hallelujah and what can the
[10:19] denomination say nothing those say I'll
[10:20] just take Jesus word they can't give you
[10:22] a verse to prove you wrong because
[10:25] nobody can say anything to the lion
[10:27] hallelujah amen everything's shuts up to
[10:29] the line everything bows to the line
[10:31] Hallelujah everything bows to this word
[10:33] we've been given Hallelujah I know
[10:35] that's bold but we should be bold as the
[10:36] righteous are B is a line Hallelujah
[10:39] right amen hallelujah thank God now
[10:42] that's what we want in our lives church
[10:43] we want to receive a word from God don't
[10:45] you you and I want to receive a word
[10:47] from God when we need it and then
[10:49] everything else in our life will will
[10:51] calm down right all the doubts will calm
[10:55] down Glory all the threats will calm
[10:58] down Amen brother says all the threats
[11:01] all the lies uh all the mocking right
[11:05] all the criticism it will all silence
[11:07] because God's given us thus sayith the
[11:09] Lord hallelujah amen such a blessing
[11:12] Hallelujah now that's a short little
[11:14] review there Hallelujah I used to do
[11:16] longer reviews in that but I'm gonna I'm
[11:17] going to stop right there uh I want to
[11:20] bring out this thought brother Paul
[11:21] preached such amazing
[11:23] Revelation and uh I agree there's eight
[11:26] covenants in fact I wrote in my book in
[11:27] 2021 so here he comes three years later
[11:29] later and you'd be surprised most people
[11:31] say there's only seven covenants but I
[11:33] was different than everybody I read
[11:34] online I think there's eight and here
[11:36] Paul comes and says there's eight you
[11:38] know covenants not that he's God or
[11:40] anything but I just what a nice
[11:41] Vindication there that we can see it but
[11:43] he brought out this amazing thought that
[11:46] all these covenants that were given were
[11:48] given by God and they still maintain to
[11:50] today right unless they were broken but
[11:53] there's a spiritual application to them
[11:55] for us in the New Covenant and church
[11:58] that was one of those mind-blowing
[11:59] moments that was another great
[12:01] Revelation there i' never seen it like
[12:03] that before so get your Bibles handy um
[12:05] in case you get get get your uh fingers
[12:07] handy on the keyboard uh Matthew
[12:10] 6:33 the first Covenant is the Eden
[12:12] Covenant or we call it edenic Covenant
[12:15] if you know if you're a reader uh
[12:17] reading the preachers and so forth of uh
[12:19] you know
[12:21] commentaries and of course it's not in
[12:22] Matthew 633 but the Eden Covenant was
[12:25] given to Adam and Eve before any sin had
[12:27] entered and remember what they given in
[12:29] Genesis 1
[12:31] Dominion that means rule you rule the
[12:34] Earth because we know Satan was there
[12:36] Satan was kicked out of heaven Michael
[12:38] kicked him out right a third of the
[12:40] Angels lost to the two-thirds of the
[12:41] angels yet the Bible says there's
[12:42] innumerable Angels so that's an
[12:45] innumerable 2third Hallelujah you can't
[12:48] number that
[12:49] two-thirds Hallelujah but they were
[12:51] given dominion and then Adam was
[12:54] overcome Adam and Eve were both overcome
[12:56] but Adam knew what he was doing Eve was
[12:58] deceived in the transgression Adam
[13:00] willingly gave it over and the Bible
[13:03] said because he did that whoever you
[13:05] overcome by you become enslaved to in
[13:07] second Peter chapter 2 and so Adam and
[13:10] all Humanity became slaves to sin
[13:13] Hallelujah but Jesus came and he paid
[13:16] the price for all of our
[13:19] sins Hallelujah and he took back all
[13:22] that Adam lost Jesus had full control he
[13:27] said I could call 12 Legions of of
[13:29] angels but I got to wait for the father
[13:31] that's right he said I don't do anything
[13:33] except the father shows me first amen
[13:35] what should we do amen we should only do
[13:37] what the father shows us first
[13:39] Hallelujah God help us all amen God help
[13:42] me amen that's what I need Hallelujah to
[13:44] wait on God to see what to do first
[13:45] about it
[13:48] Hallelujah but Adam lost that and Jesus
[13:51] got it back
[13:53] Hallelujah and then he says the works
[13:55] that I do in John 14:12 you shall do
[13:58] also
[13:59] amen Glory
[14:01] Hallelujah maybe this summer Lord I want
[14:03] to preach some more sermons on raising
[14:04] our faith Hallelujah might have to break
[14:07] out that Mighty Man
[14:08] series we need some mighty men and women
[14:11] don't we Hallelujah to come against the
[14:13] battles and trials that we Face amen
[14:15] because when we really face him I won't
[14:17] be laughing Hallelujah you won't be
[14:18] laughing when you really got a real a
[14:20] real trial Hallelujah I wasn't laughing
[14:22] you know when I go through these trials
[14:26] Hallelujah but the point I want to bring
[14:28] out is Jesus brought it back because he
[14:30] lived obedient life to every word of God
[14:32] and so he had the fullness of sunship
[14:34] back that Adam lost and then he said
[14:37] what I do you're going to do I'm giving
[14:39] you the keys to the kingdom amen
[14:42] hallelujah so we got Dominion back the
[14:43] Bible said Matthew 6:33 seek ye first
[14:46] the kingdom of God so every day we got
[14:49] to seek the Dominion
[14:51] back Glory we got to seek the rulership
[14:55] of the kingdom of God
[14:56] back Lord let it be present in my life
[15:00] help me to rule over sin help me to rule
[15:03] over Temptations help me to cast down
[15:05] anything that exalts itself against the
[15:07] word of
[15:09] God and then uh you know Luke 17:21
[15:12] Jesus says the kingdom of God is within
[15:14] you that's why Jesus came to bring us a
[15:17] portion of this Ed inate Covenant back
[15:19] into our
[15:21] lives
[15:22] Hallelujah the Bible says we can have
[15:25] peace that passes all understanding
[15:26] Jesus even said I'm leaving you my
[15:29] peace not like a a not like a portion of
[15:33] Peace but the peace of God hallelujah
[15:36] what a blessing amen that he's willing
[15:38] to leave this for us but he says this
[15:40] kingdom is within you this Dominion is
[15:43] within you amen and church and then we
[15:45] saw you know uh in Mark 11:23 Casa uh
[15:49] Jesus said if you speak to that mountain
[15:51] if you don't doubt in your heart that
[15:52] mountain will move amen hallelujah right
[15:56] but we found out this ain't speaking of
[15:57] natural mountains right it's speaking of
[16:00] just any obstacles in your
[16:02] life
[16:04] Hallelujah see whoever shall say this
[16:07] mountain be thou removed and be cast in
[16:09] the sea and shall not doubt in his heart
[16:11] but Shall Believe those things which
[16:12] shall he say it shall come to pass he
[16:13] shall have whatsoever he
[16:15] saith and you know just apply this to
[16:18] the book of Acts I just read it this
[16:19] morning Peter said such as I have Silver
[16:21] and Gold Have I None such as I have give
[16:24] I Thee rise up in the name of Jesus
[16:26] Christ see the mountain of Paralis had
[16:29] to move
[16:30] Hallelujah the mountain of not being
[16:32] able to walk has to move now how many
[16:33] want to see God move like that
[16:35] Hallelujah we got to draw closer to God
[16:37] draw closer to God he'll draw closer to
[16:39] us amen
[16:41] glory see he moved the mountain of of of
[16:45] a paralyzed body Hallelujah now
[16:48] Zechariah 4:7 is a little more
[16:49] applicable maybe to us because remember
[16:51] church God gave the apostles many the
[16:53] most Mighty signs and wonders and
[16:54] miracles they were given to the apostles
[16:56] the Bible's Plain on that in the book of
[16:57] Acts that doesn't we still can't have
[16:59] them we can have them Hallelujah but
[17:02] it's got to be ordained of God right
[17:04] like I just saw that picture from 2020
[17:06] it was July what 18 2020 well that would
[17:09] have been A's birthday but anyways that
[17:12] was when brother

[17:20] on the way home didn't we Lydia believe
[17:22] that can you believe that poisoned
[17:24] ourselves that's the last time we
[17:26] poisoned ourselves like that I'm getting
[17:29] that bad look
[17:31] there sorry Dar I thought I told you but
[17:34] anyways at that meeting you know brother
[17:36] Brian and I were talking I'm like
[17:37] brother how you doing he's like you know

[17:50] upset I don't know lyd and I must have
[17:52] been in the spirit I don't know what
[17:53] were we singing we must have been
[17:55] singing some Hallelujah songs on the way
[17:56] to church Hallelujah cuz if it was even
[17:59] before the
[18:00] preaching even before the preaching

[18:21] children have double hip replacement
[18:24] surgery and I'm like brother I said it

[18:30] Z's dad there for that portion it's
[18:32] right after that I said brother you

[18:36] have to do that I said brother let's
[18:39] pray I said I want to speak life unto
[18:41] you something like that I I can't
[18:43] remember all the details that doesn't
[18:44] matter the details well the major point
[18:46] is that God healed him Hallelujah I said
[18:49] get your pastor I said brother Jim you
[18:50] know brother Jim he likes to preach
[18:53] about dancing Hallelujah we found that
[18:55] out didn't we last yeah last year we
[18:57] found that out he likes to preach about
[18:59] dancing
[19:00] Glory uh I said brother I said do you
[19:04] have any sins you need to confess he
[19:05] said no I said well let's pray I just
[19:07] met we were both crying it a simple I
[19:09] said I speak life into those hips in the
[19:11] name of Jesus Christ three days later uh
[19:14] four days later on the Tuesday I'm out
[19:15] pulling weeds for my dear wife on The
[19:17] Garden which I don't do much anymore but
[19:19] I used
[19:20] to and uh I'm listening to brother Ram
[19:22] tell talk about my new ministry and
[19:24] brother Brian texts me and says we just
[19:25] got new scans my hips have healed
[19:28] themselves the doctor said this has
[19:29] never happened
[19:31] before that wasn't me speaking life that
[19:33] was God that's a
[19:36] mountain that had to move Hallelujah so
[19:40] I just Rejoice we put on Facebook and
[19:43] hallelujah amen it's it's not my word
[19:46] it's God's word
[19:48] hallelujah and that's just a great
[19:49] example now a more practical might be uh
[19:52] Zechariah
[19:53] 47 we read this a few weeks ago this was
[19:55] a great Revelation to me who who art
[19:58] thou oh great mountain now what was the
[20:01] mount the mountain was 16 years of
[20:02] inactivity they hadn't finished the
[20:04] temple they built the altar first they
[20:07] started building the Temple they they
[20:08] got afraid by some political
[20:10] threats right so they stopped for 16
[20:13] years and God says this is a
[20:16] mountain but what is a mountain compared
[20:19] to God Amen what is a mountain what is
[20:23] the obstacle what is man's politics and
[20:26] man's government compared to the
[20:27] Heavenly government amen it's nothing
[20:30] it's just a small it's just a mountain
[20:33] and so God says speak to that mountain
[20:35] zable hallelujah it's not by might not
[20:38] by power but by the Holy Spirit sayeth
[20:40] the
[20:41] Lord it's still on the Eden it Covenant
[20:44] so I'm probably going to have a part
[20:44] four here by God's grace just can't get
[20:47] past this series amen hallelujah but you
[20:49] understand this is a church building
[20:51] that's not finished and God calls it a
[20:53] mountain and those mountains can move by
[20:56] the Holy Spirit hallelujah amen amen so
[21:00] let's remember that by God's grace this
[21:01] week or heading in the next week and
[21:03] seemed like you know like I said with
[21:04] Simon's text there about threats and so
[21:06] for it seems like God is always
[21:08] preparing us for what we got to go
[21:09] through if I say like this just let me
[21:12] say it real humble if we're listening
[21:14] we'll hear it God will prepare us I I
[21:17] believe that God will prepare us if
[21:19] we're listening you see I wasn't what
[21:21] I'm saying is I wasn't listening like I
[21:22] ought to have been I was just going
[21:24] about life but now I can look back and
[21:26] see yes God was gracious he was being
[21:28] kind to me Hallelujah all right so there
[21:31] we go now can you see how the Dominion
[21:33] is brought back in the New Testament
[21:36] very plain right very plain now I'm
[21:39] going to go a little faster hopefully
[21:40] the Adam Covenant or adamic Covenant
[21:43] remember what was that after the fall
[21:45] God gave adam a covenant and Eve
[21:49] right Adam uh of course well I'm going
[21:52] to focus on Eve here because this one
[21:54] applies to
[21:55] us God told Eve your desire is going to
[21:58] be for your husband well that means that
[22:01] her desire wasn't for her husband before
[22:03] it's for the serpent
[22:06] right and the Bible said and now they're
[22:09] to be married right and bring forth and
[22:11] reproduce and everything fruitful
[22:13] multiply Hallelujah that's where we're
[22:14] trying to get to but Romans 7:4 says we
[22:17] were married to the law of death but the
[22:20] Bible said that's D the law is dead to
[22:23] you now you ought to be married to
[22:25] Christ amen hallelujah so see
[22:29] the adamant Covenant speaks of marriage
[22:31] and fruitfulness and now the Bible says
[22:33] we're married to him we should bring
[22:35] forth fruit unto God there it is amen
[22:37] hallelujah isn't that beautiful my I
[22:40] just never seen it till Paul preached it
[22:42] there the edate Covenant has a type for
[22:45] us the adamant Covenant has a type for
[22:48] us Glory Hallelujah is that
[22:52] beautiful and of course we don't have to
[22:53] read it but Ephesians chapter 5 husbands
[22:55] love your wives as Christ loved the
[22:57] church and wives you submit to your
[22:59] husbands in everything in the
[23:02] Lord as long as it's fit in the Lord
[23:05] hallelujah husbands cherish your wives
[23:07] wash them in the watering of the word
[23:10] amen see husbands we ought to do
[23:11] everything we can to improve the
[23:13] spiritual condition of our wives amen
[23:16] hallelujah and Wise you ought to do
[23:18] everything you can do to obey your
[23:19] husbands in the word of God hallelujah
[23:22] that's right amen that's what Christians
[23:25] do now the third one is the Noah
[23:28] Covenant or I can't even say that one
[23:29] Noah I can't even say that one I don't
[23:32] even know if that's a word or not but
[23:33] this was the this was the one that
[23:35] really blew my mind too I like I never
[23:36] thought about that there's an element to
[23:38] that that carries over to the New
[23:40] Testament Luke 17:26 if you got your
[23:50] Bible very familiar to us remember Luke
[23:52] 20 or 1721 was the kingdom of God within
[23:54] you remember that this is a beautiful
[23:55] chapter I've been making note of these
[23:56] some of these chapters they're power
[23:58] packed chapters
[23:59] Hallelujah all verse 26 so here we get
[24:03] this element of the noic Covenant to our
[24:07] day as it was in the days of Noah so
[24:09] shall be in the days of the son of
[24:12] man Hallelujah they did eat they drank
[24:15] they married wives they were given in
[24:17] marriage until the day that Noah entered
[24:19] into the ark and the flood came and
[24:21] destroyed them all so they just kept
[24:23] living life till destruction came they
[24:27] didn't recognize the prophet of God
[24:29] hallelujah my amen
[24:31] glory they they didn't recognize the man
[24:35] the Bible said Noah found Grace in the
[24:37] sight of God no one else found Grace
[24:40] because Noah is a preacher of
[24:41] righteousness hallelujah oh thank God
[24:44] that we found Grace hallelujah how many
[24:47] found it tonight by God's grace by God's
[24:49] grace you found God's grace amen
[24:53] hallelujah so we see this here everybody
[24:55] else was carried away they missed the
[24:58] signs of the end of the world because
[25:00] they're eating drinking and remember
[25:02] they were inter mearing too between
[25:04] Believers and
[25:05] unbelievers the sons of God saw those
[25:07] pretty Daughters of men but they were
[25:09] serpent seed Hallelujah now today it
[25:11] don't matter the natural seed it's the
[25:13] spiritual serpent seed your natural
[25:15] lineage and bloodline doesn't matter
[25:16] anything yeah you'll have some inherited
[25:18] traits and things you have to battle and
[25:20] so forth but that doesn't determine your
[25:22] Soul's destination the Soul's
[25:24] destination is you choose this day whom
[25:27] you will serve amen and all that the
[25:29] father has given me will come to me
[25:31] hallelujah amen all those that were
[25:34] predestinated for known chosen in Christ
[25:37] before the foundation world every one of
[25:39] those will be there on that day
[25:41] hallelujah how many believe you're one
[25:43] of them oh yeah I believe that
[25:45] Hallelujah I believe Jesus Christ wrote
[25:48] my name on the Lamb's Book of Life
[25:50] before the foundation of the world
[25:51] hallelujah amen glory amen I believe
[25:55] that praise God why brother R says
[25:57] because you will hear the word of God
[25:58] you obey the word of God hallelujah
[26:01] other people just goes right over
[26:02] brother said if you don't obey in these
[26:04] little things everything else is going
[26:05] to go right over the top of your head
[26:07] and he's talking about little things
[26:08] like not wearing makeup and and brothers
[26:10] not growing your hair out and sisters
[26:12] not cutting your hair just the simple
[26:13] things in the Bible women not preaching
[26:15] just simple things if you miss it in the
[26:17] simple things you're going to miss the
[26:19] Rapture right of
[26:22] course to be to to go in Noah's day to
[26:25] be saved in Noah's day you had to get
[26:27] inside you had to get inside the safety
[26:29] zone amen oh we got a safety zone it's
[26:33] in Christ hallelujah amen the only place
[26:36] where Sav tonight is in Jesus Christ
[26:38] hallelujah amen brother said not a
[26:41] church brother Bron said if I've been
[26:43] given a message he said listen uh God
[26:45] provide a place of worship 1965 if God's
[26:47] giv me a message to call you out I got
[26:49] to have some place to point you he said
[26:51] I'm not going to point you to bradam
[26:52] Tabernacle he said that's just as bad as
[26:54] the rest of them he said but there is
[26:57] one place I can point you where you'll
[26:59] be safe and protected that's in Jesus
[27:01] Christ amen oh my and church you can I
[27:04] we and I you and I can be pointed to
[27:06] Christ Jesus tonight too Hallelujah
[27:08] because he's the same yesterday today
[27:10] and forever
[27:13] Hallelujah well
[27:16] Glory so so what do we learn we got to
[27:20] make sure we marry the right person
[27:21] thank God Hallelujah so young people
[27:24] really listen up these next few
[27:26] years I know Lydia's listening real well
[27:28] I know Malachi's listening real well
[27:30] pretty soon we'll have some other
[27:31] teenagers they got to start listening
[27:33] real
[27:34] well Hallelujah because that that's part
[27:37] of it the days of Noah they missed on
[27:39] the marriage they married an unbeliever
[27:42] and then they got too busy eating and
[27:44] drinking and all those other cares of
[27:46] life and they forgot about judgment that
[27:48] was coming they forgot about the Holy
[27:51] Holiness
[27:52] preacher amen they forgot about the
[27:54] Holiness and the righteousness preacher
[27:56] Hallelujah Noah amen
[27:59] Glory verse 28 likewise also in the days
[28:02] of lot so it's a duel it's a dual
[28:05] Condition it's like Noah and
[28:08] lot right so Noah's day was immoral
[28:12] marriages between Believers and
[28:13] unbelievers lot's day was
[28:16] homosexuality right overtaking the land
[28:18] or the city rather likewise also was the
[28:21] days of lot so what is it
[28:23] perversion
[28:25] right they did eat they drank they
[28:27] bought they sold they planted they build
[28:29] it so again remember lot remember uh
[28:32] remember lot he needed a place to go and
[28:34] the Bible said his eyes caught Sodom and
[28:37] first he pinched his tent toward Sodom
[28:39] and then he sat then he lived in sodom's
[28:40] gate and then he became a leader in the
[28:43] gate so he lived right inside the city
[28:45] so this was a very prosperous City he
[28:48] let the prosperity of money pull him
[28:50] away from Abraham's seed and the
[28:52] promised son brother Ram says he forgot
[28:55] about the promised son because a
[28:57] building it says they bought they sold
[28:59] making a profit planting and all these
[29:02] things eating and drinking he forgot
[29:04] about the promised son Hallelujah same
[29:08] same thing so isn't that beautiful we
[29:10] see this Noah Covenant giving us a
[29:12] spiritual element in our day oh it's
[29:16] beautiful I I never saw that
[29:17] before verse 29 but the same day that
[29:20] lot went out of Sodom it rained fire and
[29:22] brimstone from heaven and Destroy them
[29:24] all even thus sh be in the day when the
[29:27] son of man is revealed now we believe
[29:28] that son of man was brother bram's
[29:30] prophetic Ministry that's what we
[29:32] believe Hallelujah because the son of
[29:34] man was already revealed to the Jews and
[29:37] the Samaritans in the Book of John
[29:38] Jesus's Earthly Ministry but that son of
[29:41] man Ministry never went to the Gentiles
[29:43] so God had to send it at the end time
[29:46] Hallelujah verse 31 in that day he which
[29:49] shall be upon the Housetop and his stuff
[29:51] in the house let him not come down to
[29:53] take it away and he that is in the field
[29:54] let him likewise not return back
[29:56] remember lot's wife whosoever shall seek
[30:00] to save his life shall lose it and
[30:02] whosoever shall lose his life shall
[30:04] preserve it now I believe he's talking
[30:05] there I believe Jesus is talking to the
[30:06] foolish virgin remember Lot's
[30:09] wife right because Abraham wasn't even
[30:11] around Lot's
[30:13] wife how many Abraham seed we got here
[30:15] tonight Glory I am I got faith in Christ
[30:18] Hallelujah I believe the promise amen
[30:20] I'm circumcised by the Holy Ghost
[30:21] Hallelujah right he Abraham had the the
[30:24] Seal of circumcision we got the Holy
[30:26] Ghost circumcision
[30:28] we're Abraham's seed so this remember
[30:30] Lot's wife is for the foolish virgin
[30:33] don't get tempted to look back and say
[30:36] oh I you know I miss those things of the
[30:38] world and no just leave it in the past
[30:42] leave the sin things behind you leave
[30:44] that behind press on toward the mark of
[30:46] the High Calling of God Amen like Jesus
[30:49] said any man that takes the plow and
[30:51] looks back is not ready to work in the
[30:53] field is that right Glory don't look
[30:57] back at the pl life and say well maybe I
[30:59] should have not came out no you're free
[31:02] thank I'm so glad Jesus Set Me Free
[31:04] Hallelujah I'm redeemed I'm already
[31:07] purchased out of the slave market I'm
[31:09] glad I'm out of the slave market amen
[31:11] but Mrs lot like I wonder if I should go
[31:13] back right brother now brother
[31:16] dramatized said maybe she was looking
[31:17] back at some of her children and
[31:19] grandchildren screaming and crying you
[31:21] know wouldn't that be difficult of
[31:23] course that'd be extremely difficult but
[31:26] the the the command was don't look back
[31:28] back right come out of
[31:31] it right and Jesus says this is what
[31:34] it'll be like at the end
[31:36] time and so see we've got to do that now
[31:39] here where we get the Rapture verse 34 I
[31:42] tell you in that night there shall be
[31:43] two men in one bed the one should be
[31:45] taken and the other shall be left verse
[31:48] 35 two women shall be grinding together
[31:50] the one should be taken the other left
[31:51] so see the Rapture is a universal thing
[31:53] it could be while you're sleeping could
[31:54] be while you're working right verse 36
[31:57] two men should be in the field one
[31:58] should be taken and the other
[32:00] left now friends that has to be the
[32:02] Rapture because that doesn't apply to
[32:04] the tribulation period that don't even
[32:06] apply to sodom's day you didn't have you
[32:08] didn't have two people there and one was
[32:09] taken and one was left if you're in the
[32:11] city you got destroyed right so this has
[32:14] to be the Gentile Rapture Hallelujah it
[32:17] doesn't fit any other uh any other
[32:20] description now verse 37 is where we get
[32:22] the Eagles Gathering here and they
[32:24] answered and said to him where Lord and
[32:26] he said to them where so the body is
[32:28] thither will the Eagles be gathered he's
[32:31] talking about the end time he's talking
[32:32] about the son of man Hallelujah at the
[32:34] end time at Jesus coming the second
[32:36] coming he's talking about the Rapture
[32:38] and he says where is this going to
[32:39] happen Lord where the Eagles are
[32:41] gathered is where the carcass is the
[32:43] word of God the food of God we gather
[32:46] around the word we're eating the true
[32:48] word of God we're not eating Lutheran
[32:49] bread or Methodist bed bread or Baptist
[32:52] bread or CMA bread or Assembly of God
[32:55] bread or you know what I'm talking about
[32:56] we're not or or uh
[32:58] Apostolic bread or something like that
[32:59] we're eating the bread of the word of
[33:01] God hallelujah amen hallelujah now
[33:04] that's why my brother R I said Assembly
[33:06] of God because that's what I was raised
[33:07] in okay so no no offense to you buddy
[33:10] just so you know and uh you know and
[33:12] every church is different right so our
[33:14] church had that I was raised in had
[33:15] numerous false doctrines okay so that's
[33:18] why I bring that out by God's grace
[33:19] because that's that's what I was raised
[33:21] in but see I had to come out of that
[33:22] because they were trying to get me to
[33:24] speak in tongues to say that's the
[33:25] evidence now my opinion is that's not
[33:27] the evidence because I know lots of
[33:29] people that speak in tongues and they
[33:30] live contrary to the word of God openly
[33:32] right Hallelujah and on the day of
[33:35] Pentecost everybody understood their
[33:37] tongues right that's the great
[33:38] difference today Hallelujah so that's
[33:40] the church you know that's what I was
[33:41] raised in so I'm saying that for me
[33:42] Hallelujah that's what I was Raising
[33:44] like uh some of you went to the CMA
[33:46] Hallelujah right that's why I'm using
[33:47] those all right good now remember Jesus
[33:51] said just like it was the days of Noah
[33:53] he said few there be that find the
[33:55] narrow road Matthew 7:14
[33:58] few just like Noah how many remember who
[34:00] how many got saved in Noah's day
[34:03] eight
[34:05] eight eight people got saved out of the
[34:07] whole
[34:10] world we got way more than eight here
[34:12] tonight we got double eight here
[34:16] tonight eight people made it eight
[34:18] people heard the preacher of
[34:20] righteousness eight people escaped uh
[34:23] the temptation to marry the wrong person
[34:25] the eating the drinking and the building
[34:27] eight people people escaped that thank
[34:28] God we're among those that have escaped
[34:31] Hallelujah the spirit of Sodom and the
[34:33] spirit of of of Noah's day thank God
[34:37] we've escaped that Hallelujah remember
[34:39] Noah day what what did the Bible say
[34:41] their thoughts were only evil
[34:43] continually all day long how many are
[34:45] thankful for a clean mind that you have
[34:48] that throughout the day while you're
[34:49] making pizza or while you're cooking you
[34:50] know you make good pizza by the
[34:53] way while you're making pizza while
[34:55] you're serving people while you're
[34:56] teaching children to drink ra or right
[34:59] like me you can actually think good
[35:02] thoughts how you actually have a good
[35:03] heart how can I help this person Lord
[35:06] give me a word to say or Lord G lead me
[35:09] to try to point this person to
[35:11] Christ how many glad that all day you
[35:13] just don't think about evil things all
[35:15] day long how can I take that or how can
[35:18] I how can I pull this trick here how can
[35:20] I do that aren't you glad you got a Pure
[35:21] Heart church what a difference between
[35:25] the Noah and the other group all all the
[35:27] Sinners did in Noah's day is think evil
[35:29] thoughts thank God we can think on the
[35:30] word of God oh Jesus how you going to
[35:32] save my mom how you going to save my dad

[35:36] me in this tough situation Lord how you
[35:38] going to do it I don't know how but
[35:39] you'll do it again Hallelujah you can
[35:42] actually think good thoughts
[35:45] Hallelujah but that was the world
[35:47] compared to Noah Noah had good thoughts
[35:49] preacher thoughts of righteousness
[35:51] living holy living right and the world
[35:53] had only evil thoughts continually
[36:00] Hallelujah now boy
[36:03] good the next Covenant remember was the
[36:06] abrahamic Covenant and the one that
[36:08] really applies us spiritually is Genesis
[36:10] 22:17 in case sure if you want to read
[36:12] that one thank you H you're doing a
[36:13] great job tonight as
[36:21] always that in blessing I Will Bless
[36:23] thee and multiplying I multiply thy seed
[36:25] as the stars of Heaven and the as the
[36:27] sand which is upon the seashore and thy
[36:29] seed shall possess the Gate of his
[36:33] enemies all right now I believe that
[36:35] literally applied to the founding
[36:37] fathers of America because they
[36:39] possessed a land that wasn't theirs and
[36:41] church we've been reading through their
[36:42] history these most these founding
[36:44] fathers were quoting the word every
[36:47] time they were comparing their freedom
[36:49] from Great Britain to Israel's freedom
[36:51] from Pharaoh in Egypt that was their
[36:53] rling
[36:55] cry that was their cry and that was
[36:58] their cry to end slavery in America in
[37:00] the
[37:00] 1800s 1863 the Emancipation Emancipation
[37:04] Proclamation sorry that was they were
[37:07] using scripture amen hallelujah they
[37:10] were finding themselves in the word of
[37:11] God hallelujah so I believe there is a
[37:14] natural element at least to the United
[37:16] States of America the founding of
[37:18] that now I'm not telling you to go down
[37:20] and claim that nice mansion that just
[37:22] got built down the road I'm not I'm not
[37:23] telling you that don't don't go that far

[1:02:47] Hebrews 12:27 and this word yet once
[1:02:50] more signify the removing of those
[1:02:51] things which are shaken as of things
[1:02:53] that are made that those things which
[1:02:55] which cannot be shaken May remain now
[1:02:58] think about David's think about David's
[1:03:00] lineage did the Kings get shaken did
[1:03:02] they get taken away yes they got carried
[1:03:04] away
[1:03:05] Church some of them got chained up and

[1:03:11] Nebuchadnezzar kill his sons can you
[1:03:12] imagine

[1:03:23] he allowed the idol worship the sexual
[1:03:25] immorality they allowed all this
[1:03:27] wickedness all these Idols so he got
[1:03:30] carried away his kingdom got shaken and
[1:03:32] it fell but the Bible says if we got the

[1:03:39] cannot be shaken our kingdom cannot be
