[23:16] p.m. so 350 I sent that and then she
[23:19] said today before taking a nap I put on
[23:21] one of my healing CDs because it was
[23:23] about 4 p.m. when I figured the church
[23:25] would be starting to make there would be
[23:28] starting to make this short for the

[37:39] [Applause]
[37:39] [Music]
[37:44] [Applause]
[37:45] [Music]
[37:53] [Music]
[38:13] [Music]
[38:21] tonight by the grace of the Lord I'd
[38:23] like to look back again at biblical
[38:25] numerology tonight and preach on this by
[38:29] the grace of God I really never finished
[38:30] part I'm sorry the number six so this
[38:32] will actually be part six of the series
[38:35] and will probably finish number six and
[38:36] begin looking at number seven and if the
[38:40] Lord is willing let me get you a
[38:42] starting spot we'll just start in
[38:44] Genesis 4 verse 17 let's start there
[38:47] [Music]
[38:55] there's nowhere
[38:57] I'd rather be than in the house of God
[38:58] tonight amen I know the angels of God
[39:01] are here I know Christ is here by his
[39:03] promise and so I'm looking forward to
[39:06] who God will deliver our amen
[39:10] so Genesis 4:17 I'm gonna start with the
[39:15] number six here and and this is just a
[39:17] just a starting spot but this is where
[39:21] polygamy starts it starts in the sixth
[39:23] generation of Cain's descendants the
[39:27] sixth one so this is a type of fallen
[39:30] man so let's read Genesis 4:17 just a
[39:34] moment while I get there and I hope
[39:39] you're seeing numbers in your life you
[39:41] know and I forgot to tell about that one
[39:43] remember I told you about the five five
[39:45] five on my when we got our van fixed so
[39:48] I forgot to tell you that was actually a
[39:49] free service I didn't have to pay one
[39:51] cent for all that work so not only was
[39:54] it on time and just when we needed it to
[39:56] come to church and go on our little
[39:58] vacation air the vacation was free now I
[40:00] like that but all the work was free by
[40:02] God's grace so triple grace or perfect
[40:05] grace and I just thought I forgot no I
[40:08] forgot to tell you that so I want to
[40:09] make sure I told you that because it was
[40:11] all under warranty so everything that
[40:12] was broken was fixed for free so anyway
[40:15] he's just interesting to see the numbers
[40:17] of God here Genesis 4:17 if you're there
[40:23] say Amen
[40:24] we'll try to read for down to 20 I'm
[40:27] sorry 17 rather down to 23 and Cain knew
[40:32] his wife and she conceived and bare
[40:33] Enoch and he builded a city and called
[40:37] the name of the city after the name of
[40:38] his son Enoch did that striking Cain how
[40:41] to Enoch first before Adam had to Enoch
[40:44] so it sounds it seems like the
[40:46] personation Satan trying to impersonate
[40:48] and use that name doesn't that name mean
[40:52] dedicated is that right I thought it
[40:53] means dedicated or devoted I'll look
[40:55] that up isn't that something the serpent
[40:58] seed named his son Enoch verse 18 so
[41:03] that's the second generation and
[41:06] Enoch was born I'm sorry and unto Enoch
[41:09] was born irad and irad begat me who Jael
[41:14] and may who GL began with thews Al and
[41:16] Mithu CL begat lamech and Lamech took
[41:20] unto Him two wives and the name of the
[41:24] one was Adah and the name of the other
[41:26] was Zilla and ADA bear jaybo he was the
[41:29] father such as dwell in tents and of
[41:32] such as have cattle and his brother's
[41:34] name was Jubal and he was the father of
[41:36] all such as handle the harp and organ
[41:38] and Zilla she also bear two ball cane an
[41:41] instructor of every artificer in brass
[41:44] and iron and the sister of tubal-cain
[41:46] was Naamah and lame exceda's wives Adah
[41:51] and Zillah hear my voice he wives of
[41:52] Lamech hearken unto my speech rive slain
[41:55] a man to my wounding and a young man to
[41:58] my hurt

[42:02] heart just making known unto God here as

[42:36] Jesus Christ state and the church said
[42:38] Amen god bless your being seated praise
[42:41] the Lord
[42:45] so like
[42:47] look at this year again tonight part six
[42:51] and we look at number six and seven
[42:53] seven is such a massive number there's
[42:57] over 800 sevens in the entire Bible so I
[43:00] haven't I just went through revelation
[43:02] on number seven there's 56 sevens in
[43:04] Revelation I just made it through those
[43:06] and Malachi again switch over when
[43:08] you're ready buddy for the slides so
[43:11] I've got a lot to study and do on
[43:13] Saturday on number seven and just trying
[43:16] to scratch the surface a little bit look
[43:18] at number seven but we'll look at number
[43:20] six or willing tonight finish six and
[43:22] then we'll go to number seven now
[43:26] remember couples that of course beast
[43:31] was made on the sixth day and you know
[43:33] be the beasts was the one who tempted
[43:35] Eve the serpent who Satan entered into
[43:39] the serpent and caused the serpent to
[43:42] fall as well and then of course fallen a
[43:44] man as we see how men men fell sin came
[43:48] through man but it also represents the
[43:50] anointed man and that's the kind of man
[43:51] that you and I want to be praise God
[43:53] under the anointing of the Holy Spirit
[43:55] in fact that's when we're actually truly
[43:57] human is when we're anointed by the Holy
[44:00] Spirit and we'll see tonight that six
[44:03] measures man's time as well and also
[44:06] measurements so remember brother Branham
[44:09] said six is the man's day course man's
[44:12] day seven is his day of redemption
[44:15] that's from Revelation chapter five so
[44:18] here's how time and matter is measured
[44:20] in sixes a foot equals twelve inches or
[44:23] two sixes we see also this 2 and 6 with
[44:27] the ephod stones on the high priests
[44:29] with shewbread two stacks of six and the
[44:33] stairs of solomon's temple there are six
[44:35] stairs and there's six lines on this
[44:37] side six lines on this side so we see
[44:40] it's it's a number God uses often and of
[44:43] course the common measurements allow for
[44:45] increments of six you have you know of
[44:47] course six inches 12 inches 18 24 36 or
[44:52] 30 36 and then of course 36 is 6 squared
[44:55] but there's all kinds of sixes in
[44:58] measurements time of course has 24 hours
[45:01] there's there's six or six fours or four
[45:05] sixes rather and then of course day and
[45:07] night each having twelve hours which can
[45:08] be divided into two groups of six as
[45:10] well and of course there's 12 months
[45:12] which is six times two as far as two
[45:15] groups of six so isn't it interesting
[45:17] God uses sixes with measurements and
[45:19] time very interesting and then of course
[45:22] time you know has hours have 60 minutes
[45:24] which is six times ten and then minutes
[45:26] are into 60 seconds which are six times
[45:29] ten again so there's all these sixes to
[45:31] remind man of time and brother man have
[45:34] said every time you hear a siren he says
[45:36] it's a reminder that death is coming for
[45:39] man right every time you see a gray hair
[45:41] on your head it's a reminder that you
[45:44] have a meeting and raba have said it's a
[45:45] me reminder that you have a meeting with
[45:47] the Almighty God and the thing to do is
[45:50] take that reminder not feel bad like oh
[45:51] I'm getting older oh I'm feeling but to
[45:53] take that and say Lord let me redeem the
[45:55] time help me to be ready I want to be
[45:57] ready to meet you at any time
[45:58] amen so that's why God gives us these
[46:01] sixes of man and men remember that men's
[46:03] time is temporal men's time is fleeting
[46:05] and we measure our our time and lives in
[46:09] sixes because six is the number of man
[46:11] now let's look at a few more as we saw
[46:13] with fallen man polygamy started in the
[46:15] sixth generation said Cain Enoch IRAD me
[46:19] who Jael Mathu ZL and Lamech and then he
[46:23] course took two wives and then had sons
[46:25] with both wives I don't know if you
[46:28] remember this but this was a good good
[46:30] for me a faith I'm sorry Ethel ayah a
[46:34] Hammond Jezebel's daughter reigned six
[46:36] years before Josh ascended to the throne
[46:39] amen and brother Branham liking that
[46:41] unto the Roman Catholic Church in the
[46:43] church age book remember when we
[46:44] preached on that I don't know if you
[46:45] remember we preached on that but he
[46:46] likened unto that under six the six
[46:48] church ages but in the seventh the
[46:50] mystery of God is finished it's restored
[46:53] right and the word is brought to its
[46:55] proper place and I think you and I know
[46:56] that the rapture is going to take place
[46:58] in the seven church age is that right
[47:01] Amen so we thank God for that so it's a
[47:05] type there of how the in the seventh
[47:07] church age the rulership changes right
[47:10] Christ
[47:10] finds is is his
[47:12] place here in the church and the church
[47:14] is raptured in the seventh church age
[47:17] Amen now look at this one let's go to
[47:20] our Bibles let's go to Nehemiah chapter
[47:22] 2 I never saw this before I preached the
[47:25] whole series on Esther Nehemiah and Ezra
[47:28] I preached through all those sermons all
[47:29] those scriptures numerous sermons I
[47:32] think did 18 sermons on that series and
[47:36] I still got it if you want I think I put
[47:37] it on that computer over there if you
[47:39] want all the sermons well let's go to
[47:40] Nehemiah just to read some of these they
[47:42] face six opposition's when they were
[47:45] building the temple so Ezra Nehemiah
[47:47] Esther as Renea Maya sir
[47:52] right before job all right so Nehemiah
[48:00] 2:10 will read these here
[48:02] just to kind of give us a glimpse now
[48:04] Church and I just want to say this if
[48:07] they could have such courage while
[48:10] building a natural wall how much courage
[48:12] should we have building a spiritual wall
[48:14] praise God program said that God is
[48:17] turning a corner right brother branham
[48:20] said that it takes it takes a man who
[48:22] knows how to turn a corner it takes a
[48:24] prophet to turn a corner and do a new
[48:26] thing and we're gonna know get a new
[48:30] thing in this channel send us proud to
[48:32] do a new thing not just all the old
[48:33] reformer reformer reformer but it's
[48:35] prophet amen and God has done a new
[48:38] thing and so let's take courage from
[48:40] these scriptures here and I think you
[48:44] will as you we read him here so Nehemiah
[48:46] 2:10 sorry it's just taken me a while to
[48:48] get there this is their first opposition
[48:51] now remember Nehemiah was after
[48:53] zerubabbel had already come back this
[48:55] was years after a zoo rule came back in
[48:58] fact there was there was a 16 year gap
[49:00] between zerubabbel they built for a
[49:02] couple a little while and then that the
[49:04] the government forced them shut him down
[49:05] for 16 years and then God anointed
[49:08] Zechariah and Haggai to prophesy and the
[49:10] Bible said the prophecy lifted the
[49:13] spirits of the people it's like the two
[49:15] prophets preaching them resurrected
[49:17] their faith and that was a foreshadowing
[49:18] of the two prophets in revelation 11
[49:20] Amen that their prophecy will give life
[49:23] to the church and bring life back
[49:26] and what man has destroyed God will
[49:32] raise up again and he does it through
[49:34] prophecy that's why when we preach you
[49:36] know many times I know I read those same
[49:38] prophecies you know Joel - about the
[49:40] latter rain you know many times you'll
[49:42] hear me read those again church why am i
[49:44] reading them again I'm reading them
[49:46] again because I know God has always
[49:47] brought life to the church through
[49:49] reading the prophecy and recognizing
[49:52] your day in its message amen
[49:53] at some time somebody's going to catch
[49:56] that revelation of the latter rain and
[49:57] the bride is going to be satisfied with
[49:59] the bread satisfied with the corn the
[50:01] why and the oil and they'll not be
[50:04] ashamed at some point when reading those
[50:06] scriptures somebody's going to catch
[50:07] that revelation and they're going to
[50:09] fulfill the scriptures for the latter
[50:10] rain amen and so we want to fall under
[50:13] the anointing of the prophecy of this
[50:16] day praise God
[50:17] just as they fell under their anointing
[50:19] we want to fall under the anointing for
[50:21] our day that's why prophecy is so
[50:23] important the Spirit of Jesus Christ is
[50:25] the spirit of prophecy amen
[50:28] Nehemiah 2:10 when Sam bout the horror
[50:32] night and told by the servant an
[50:33] ammonite heard of it agree them
[50:35] exceedingly that there was come a man to
[50:37] seek the welfare of the children of
[50:40] Israel so first the enemies are grieved
[50:42] so the very fact that they hear Oh what
[50:44] there's message believers coming back
[50:46] and they're trying to restore boundaries
[50:48] they're trying to separate you know
[50:49] sinners from from from the holy places
[50:52] of Jerusalem it grieve them that's what
[50:55] I want my testimony be I want my
[50:57] testimony to grieve Satan the trouble is
[51:01] you know we get in the flesh and we
[51:02] grieve the wrong we read the Holy Spirit
[51:04] we don't want to grieve him we want to
[51:06] grieve the devil hey I live in a
[51:08] victorious life by adding more to the
[51:11] church we're adding more of our strength
[51:12] to the church we want to grieve the
[51:14] devil we don't want to grieve the Holy
[51:15] Spirit we want to please the Holy Spirit
[51:17] now after their greed after they get
[51:21] grieved they decide okay we'll just go
[51:22] confront them face-to-face and we'll
[51:25] start laughing in their face and mocking
[51:27] them I'm sorry laughing and scorning
[51:30] them and despising them to their face so
[51:32] - 19 - 19 when sambel the night
[51:36] and told by the server and the ammonite
[51:38] and gchem the arabian heard
[51:40] laughter scorn and despises and so what
[51:43] is this thing that you do will you rebel
[51:45] against the king then answer die them
[51:48] instead of them the God of heaven he
[51:50] will prosper us therefore we his
[51:52] servants will arise and build but you
[51:54] have no portion all right no memorial in
[51:57] Jerusalem
[51:58] I like nehemiah's revelation don't you
[52:01] people can laugh in his face and say oh
[52:03] you're just a worthless bunch of Jews
[52:05] you're never gonna do anything for God
[52:07] huh you're ridiculous you're funny and
[52:10] he doesn't look at himself he doesn't
[52:12] look at the circumstances he look where
[52:13] the promise of God came from amen he
[52:16] knew that God had already noted a King
[52:19] Cyrus to bring back Giroux Bible and
[52:23] Ezra he knew that he was living and he
[52:25] knew God had already started this work
[52:27] so if God was able to start something
[52:29] supernaturally God was able to finish it
[52:31] hallelujah and church God has already
[52:33] started something supernaturally because
[52:35] a brother branham came now we actually
[52:37] have what can be a book of Acts Church
[52:39] because now we have little message
[52:40] churches all over the world so if God
[52:42] started this movement the message he's
[52:44] surely going to finish it amen so we
[52:47] need not be discouraged and remember
[52:49] that God in heaven started this move
[52:50] that God of heaven restored this Bible
[52:52] the god of heaven sent us a prophet so
[52:54] we must fall in the line with the
[52:56] prophecy of this day and do our part and
[52:58] let the holy spirit build up a wall
[53:00] between us in the world amen so we can
[53:04] dwell in security what does the wall
[53:06] represent a wall represents security it
[53:08] represents separation and that's what
[53:11] the Holy Spirit's doing it's building up
[53:12] a separation between us in the world
[53:15] every day we should see our lives being
[53:17] more separate from the things of the
[53:18] world amen
[53:20] that because that's the that's the
[53:22] prophecy of the hour
[53:24] remember there was three people that
[53:25] came to finish this guru Bible Ezra and
[53:28] Nehemiah it was completed in threes amen
[53:32] right Luther Wesley Branham is completed
[53:35] in threes God is going to have this wall
[53:37] built up and God is going to fully get
[53:40] this bride ready and and we know God is
[53:42] going to do it it's prophecy and we see
[53:44] the type brother Branham even typed his
[53:46] ministry with that of of Nehemiah and
[53:49] Zerubbabel that's in the message of
[53:51] grace if one listen to that I can't
[53:52] remember that so I'm not gonna I'm gonna
[53:53] stop
[53:54] I can't remember all the ties but look
[53:56] they're laughing huh you're one of those
[53:58] mess you believe william branham was a
[54:00] prophet that's hilarious
[54:02] and he said the god of heavens started
[54:04] this and we don't need your help at all
[54:06] he said God's gonna prosper this church
[54:08] amen
[54:09] God started this church God's the one
[54:12] that started 12 years ago he's gonna
[54:14] prosper laughs if you will abandon if
[54:16] you one mark make fun of if you want
[54:18] God's gonna prosperous because we're not
[54:20] looking for natural prosperity we're
[54:22] looking for spiritual prosperity we're
[54:24] looking to be more like Jesus Christ not
[54:26] like the world glory look at chapter
[54:30] four verse one see the world's looking
[54:34] for spiritual prosperity and numbers and
[54:36] big buildings and money and all kinds of
[54:38] things brother Branham said let me tell
[54:39] you my poor blind friend God does not
[54:41] save the world by money he saves it
[54:43] through the blood of Jesus Christ
[54:45] he sounds us to that this weekend the
[54:47] seals I think goes this last week I was
[54:49] listen to the fourth seal this morning
[54:50] but I'm trying to get the seals under in
[54:52] my mind again and get them all stirred
[54:54] up again but he says my poor blind
[54:56] friend it's not about money we should
[54:57] say oh we just had money more money we
[54:59] could do something we need to have more
[55:01] of a contact with God we just need to be
[55:04] more faithful to God more in love with
[55:05] God more worship more obedience to God
[55:07] and then God will do in our lives all
[55:09] that he's determined to do in our lives
[55:11] hallelujah for one now first they grieve
[55:15] then they laugh and now they're mocking
[55:17] with wrath and Ignatian so starting to
[55:19] get a little more serious this is fall
[55:22] man attacking the anointed Jews but it
[55:26] came to pass that when San Mao heard
[55:28] that we build the wall he was wroth and
[55:29] took great indignation and mocked the
[55:31] Jews now they're not laughing now
[55:32] they're mocking them well making fun and
[55:35] he spake before his brother in the army
[55:37] of Samaria and said what do these feeble
[55:39] Jews will they fortify themselves with a
[55:41] sacrifice where they make an end in the
[55:43] day will they revive the stones out of
[55:45] the heaps of the rubbish which are
[55:46] burned
[55:46] Naoto by the ammonite was by him and he
[55:49] said even that which they build if a fox
[55:51] go up he shall even break down their
[55:53] stone wall here o our God for we are
[55:56] despised and turn their reproach upon
[55:58] their own head and give them for a prey
[56:00] in the land of captivity amen now look
[56:05] all these questions was what God was
[56:06] going to do
[56:07] the questions were what do the of will
[56:09] they fortify themselves yes they were
[56:12] gonna fortify themselves but they're
[56:13] mocking oh you think you're gonna
[56:14] protect yourself yes God was gonna help
[56:17] them be protected will they sacrifice
[56:18] yes they're gonna get back to
[56:20] sacrificing amen will they make an end
[56:22] of the day yes will they revive the
[56:25] stones yes it was a revival praise God
[56:28] and they said over Fox go up they'll
[56:32] break down the wall and a stone wall see
[56:34] even a little Fox even a little of the
[56:37] Bob said little foxes spoil the vine
[56:39] right so they said oh just a little
[56:41] thing I'll knock that down now there's
[56:43] some truth in that in the spiritual a
[56:45] little Fox will knock down your wall but
[56:49] they're mocking the natural wall oh if a
[56:51] fox jumps on that wall the whole wall is
[56:53] gonna fall down all the stone all the
[56:55] mortar all that it's just there there
[56:58] its shoddy masonry work you know it's
[56:59] really it's really not good masonry work
[57:02] and they're just mocking it but the
[57:04] spiritual type is true if we don't keep
[57:07] little lying little stealing little
[57:09] dishonesty little little Envy little
[57:11] jealousy a little green little fear
[57:14] little us if we don't keep those little
[57:16] things out of our lives it'll tear down
[57:17] our defenses
[57:18] we've got to keep the little foxes from
[57:21] spoiling the sweet tenderness that we
[57:23] feel toward Jesus don't you have to come
[57:25] to church and you feel like it's just
[57:26] all new again the tenderness of worship
[57:29] the little foxes will spoil that
[57:31] tenderness of worship a little sin that
[57:34] comes in will hinder that tender
[57:37] relationship we have with God I think at
[57:39] verse 7 8 now this now it's going beyond
[57:41] laughing now it's a it's about time to
[57:44] fight by verse 7 but it came to pass
[57:48] that when Sam Batlin told by and the
[57:50] Arabians and the ammonites and the ash
[57:52] Knights heard that the walls of
[57:53] Jerusalem were made up and that the
[57:55] breaches began to be stopped that they
[57:56] were very rough and conspired all of
[57:58] them together or together to come and
[58:00] fight against Jerusalem and they hinder
[58:02] it nevertheless we made our prayer unto
[58:03] our God and set a watch against them day
[58:06] and night because of them amen so now
[58:09] it's gone from there just grieved
[58:10] they're laughing now it's then mocking
[58:13] and now it's we are gonna fight you
[58:15] we're gonna physically hurt you and what
[58:18] did this drive them to do it drove them
[58:20] to prayer
[58:21] what should all of our trials new church
[58:23] it should drive us to pray drive us to
[58:30] it should drive us to fight off the
[58:31] devil in prayer amen hallelujah but see
[58:35] it gets more and more serious all the
[58:37] time now to spare time we're just going
[58:39] to read these now they have a conference
[58:42] to meet together they invite Nehemiah to
[58:45] conference in Nehemiah says I'm not
[58:47] gathering with you anywhere and then
[58:50] lastly then Samuel hires some other
[58:53] friends of Nehemiah and says let's have
[58:56] a meeting at the house of God and this
[58:58] is just like Satan transforming himself
[58:59] into an angel of light look how look how
[59:02] it's slick Satan is first he starts off
[59:05] a little bit of laughing now it's
[59:07] physical and now he's like well let's
[59:09] let's go meet in the church and let's
[59:11] see if I can talk them out of it in the
[59:13] house of God the house of God is where
[59:15] we have the most shrank praise God we
[59:17] should have no compromising in the
[59:19] pulpit no compromising in the pew and
[59:21] then the Satan nothing of Satan can
[59:23] stand before a Church of the Living God
[59:24] that's walking in the Holy Spirit amen
[59:27] that's an invincible army but he's like
[59:30] God maybe I get them to to compromise in
[59:31] the church and as long as we confess our
[59:34] sins as long as we pull on the Word of
[59:36] God as long as we worship the Holy
[59:37] Spirit we can expect there to be no
[59:39] compromise in this church amen
[59:41] hallelujah without what's Satan's tactic
[59:44] maybe I can just get one more trick and
[59:46] I could try to trick him in the house of
[59:47] God oh my that's why we said on Sunday
[59:51] that's why we take everything back to
[59:52] the word because we know groups now that
[59:55] don't take everything back to the word
[59:56] and where do they get to see they get to
[59:58] see right in the house of God preachers
[1:00:00] will preach something and it's wrong
[1:00:01] right in the house of God so you got to
[1:00:03] be very careful to say with all the
[1:00:05] truth of God amen now let's go to the
[1:00:08] New Testament there's some there's some
[1:00:09] fallen men and the New Testament six
[1:00:12] times Jesus was charged with having a
[1:00:14] devil in the New Testament the first
[1:00:17] time by the scribes he hath Beelzebub
[1:00:20] and by the Prince of Devil's cast as out
[1:00:21] he devils after the people were amazed
[1:00:24] and started saying is not this the son
[1:00:25] of David so the people who start come
[1:00:29] it's updated its rise up and say oh he's
[1:00:32] Beelzebub because they don't want him
[1:00:34] being
[1:00:35] as as Ally a leader of Israel we'd say
[1:00:39] then in John 7:20 the people in the
[1:00:41] temple say thou hast a devil after he
[1:00:44] discerns the desires to kill him mocking
[1:00:46] him saying this man never learned so
[1:00:48] they're mocking him this man never
[1:00:49] learned so jesus discerns and said you
[1:00:51] want to kill me they said you've got a
[1:00:53] devil so jesus discerns him and they
[1:00:55] realize it and the devil says you've got
[1:00:57] a devil that's that's the devil's last
[1:01:00] that's his last escape to call the real
[1:01:02] believer a devil the last thing he could
[1:01:04] do other than his physically hurt Jesus
[1:01:06] he just call him a devil the devil
[1:01:07] calling God the devil so be careful who
[1:01:11] we call a devil right and also watch who
[1:01:13] people call a devil that's why we don't
[1:01:16] call our friends Devils right unless we
[1:01:18] know for sure there's a devil on them
[1:01:20] because the devil is the one who calls
[1:01:23] other people Devils interesting John
[1:01:30] well after Jesus told them they cannot
[1:01:32] hear God's words because they were not
[1:01:34] of God so again Jesus says you're not of
[1:01:37] God because you can't hear the message
[1:01:38] of the hour and he says you're of the
[1:01:40] devil the devil calling God of the devil
[1:01:44] trying to deceive the people in John 8
[1:01:48] 52 they say now we know that that was
[1:01:50] the devil after Jesus said if a man keep
[1:01:53] my saying he shall never see death amen
[1:01:56] Jesus says my word has the power if you
[1:01:58] keep my word you'll have eternal life as
[1:02:00] they say now we know you've got a devil
[1:02:02] saying that you have eternal life and
[1:02:05] then Jesus was preaching on the Good
[1:02:07] Shepherd and how no man can take his
[1:02:09] life from him but he would lay it down
[1:02:11] he says he this man hath a devil and
[1:02:13] he's crazy he's gonna nobody can take
[1:02:16] this man's life nobody can kill this man
[1:02:18] this man's crazy he's got a devil and
[1:02:20] the sixth and final time is when Jesus
[1:02:23] casts out a dumb spear and the people
[1:02:25] wondered and they said he casts out the
[1:02:27] devils by Beelzebub by six times they
[1:02:31] say he had a devil that's the Fallen man
[1:02:33] can buddy see that amen now six times
[1:02:37] they asked him for a sign and I got one
[1:02:39] overlap actually have seven in here so
[1:02:41] one overlap so bear with me in Matthew
[1:02:44] 12 38 after jesus healed a blind and
[1:02:47] dumb man
[1:02:48] jesus said an eat they asked him for a
[1:02:50] sign the Pharisees asked and scribes
[1:02:51] asked for a sign he said an evil and
[1:02:53] adulterous generation seeketh after side
[1:02:55] and there's to be no sign giving it but
[1:02:57] the sign of the Prophet Jonas he just
[1:03:00] healed a blind man and he gave the man
[1:03:03] the building to talk he was blind and
[1:03:05] deaf Jesus did a double miracle and they
[1:03:07] say give us some more sign what greater
[1:03:08] sign could he give he said fine I'm not
[1:03:11] gonna give me any sign I'll give you the
[1:03:13] sign of my resurrection though if this
[1:03:15] ain't enough for you I'll raise from the
[1:03:17] dead hallelujah
[1:03:19] see because they they just they were
[1:03:20] just playing with him well it was just
[1:03:22] like Pilate Oh give me a sign show me a
[1:03:24] sign maybe I'll do a miracle but the man
[1:03:26] said God don't come for nobody this
[1:03:29] blind man that wanted to be he must had
[1:03:31] a deep desire he must have wanted to be
[1:03:33] healed he must have believed that God
[1:03:35] could heal he must have had a deep
[1:03:36] calling for divine healing but all the
[1:03:38] other people just want to make a cloud
[1:03:40] out of God but that man really believes
[1:03:42] so that man really got healed by God
[1:03:43] amen Jesus truly sends his faith and a
[1:03:47] beat unto him according to his faith in
[1:03:50] God's Word amen
[1:03:52] so that's a fall man give me a sign and
[1:03:55] he'd already give him a blind and deaf
[1:03:57] man saw and talked and heard the
[1:04:01] pharisees sadducees again he said oh you
[1:04:04] hypocrites you can discern the face of
[1:04:06] the sky but you can discern the signs of
[1:04:08] the times he said give us give us a sign
[1:04:10] he says you can understand the weather
[1:04:12] but you can't understand the spiritual
[1:04:14] weather the disciples had three requests
[1:04:17] in mark 24 and brother Branham teaches
[1:04:19] on this in the I believe it's the sixth
[1:04:21] seal if I'm not mistaken it's either the
[1:04:23] six or questions and answers I think
[1:04:25] it's the sixth seal they asked three
[1:04:28] questions even his disciples asked him
[1:04:30] for sign so don't feel bad Church if you
[1:04:32] ask God for signs getting ask God for
[1:04:33] signs God gave the signs he said when
[1:04:37] shall these things be done when one
[1:04:38] stone is not left upon another
[1:04:40] that's when Titus came brother Branham
[1:04:41] said when all the stones the temple
[1:04:43] would not be stacked one upon another
[1:04:45] that was Titus about 40 years later what
[1:04:49] shall be the sign of that coming that
[1:04:51] was where Jesus said there'll be two in
[1:04:52] a field one will be taken two in a bed
[1:04:54] during the grinding mill one will be
[1:04:55] taken one will be left that was a sign
[1:04:57] of the coming of the rapture and the
[1:04:59] sign of the end of the world were the
[1:05:01] other side
[1:05:02] the end of the world Armageddon when
[1:05:04] Jesus would come back amen
[1:05:05] and that'd be the end of man's day then
[1:05:08] they enter into the Lord's Day praise
[1:05:10] God
[1:05:11] now here's the overlapping one I think
[1:05:13] yeah the others tempting in Sodom a sign
[1:05:15] from heaven now I love this one let's go
[1:05:17] to mark 8:11 this is beautiful I just I
[1:05:20] love to see Jesus's emotions don't you
[1:05:23] Mark 8:11 this is beautiful in church it
[1:05:29] makes us encouraged because he was human
[1:05:31] he was fully human just like you and I
[1:05:33] are for you fully human on a night like
[1:05:36] tonight you might sigh deeply in your
[1:05:37] spirit to Luke 8 11 12 Luke 8:11 I'm
[1:05:45] sorry no it's the mark 8 11 12 I'm sorry
[1:05:47] forgive me I went - Luke - sorry mark 8
[1:05:51] 11 12 mark 8 11 12 and the Pharisees
[1:05:57] came forth and began to question him
[1:05:59] seeking a sign from heaven tempting him
[1:06:01] and he sighed deeply in his spear and
[1:06:03] said why does this generation seek after
[1:06:06] a sign
[1:06:07] very nice any of there shall no sign be
[1:06:09] given unto this generation don't you
[1:06:12] love that even Jesus got tired of their
[1:06:15] questions even Jesus got little
[1:06:17] frustration this generation is asking
[1:06:22] for a sign I'm not giving one right I
[1:06:25] heard brother Graham say yes sir doesn't
[1:06:27] seem to the 3rd Exodus and program was
[1:06:32] talking about that the picture of the
[1:06:33] cloud and he said he was going to take
[1:06:36] that picture to all those scientists in
[1:06:39] Arizona and brotherman said no the Holy
[1:06:41] Spirit said no they're just gonna laugh
[1:06:42] at it don't give your pearls don't cast
[1:06:45] your pearls before swine amen
[1:06:48] he said the ask the Lord the Holy Spirit
[1:06:50] told him no don't take it they're just
[1:06:52] gonna laugh on it in that striking and
[1:06:55] so yo we would think Oh everybody needs
[1:06:58] to hear everybody well I guess not
[1:07:01] everybody does somehow God has already
[1:07:04] worked on their heart or maybe they
[1:07:05] crossed the line between mercy and
[1:07:07] judgment who knows but God said don't
[1:07:08] take it down there just like Jesus said
[1:07:10] let the blind lead the blind now if
[1:07:13] you've got a leaning to go get soap so
[1:07:15] help some
[1:07:16] a witness somebody of course you go do
[1:07:17] it I'm not giving you a license not to
[1:07:19] witness what I'm saying is we've got to
[1:07:21] follow the leadership with the Holy
[1:07:22] Spirit and at least brother Branham
[1:07:24] asked Lord you want me to take you to
[1:07:25] them at least he asked we need to ask to
[1:07:27] Lord want me to take it to my neighbor
[1:07:29] amen can we take the message to my
[1:07:31] friend when we take the message to my
[1:07:33] mother father my my family we need to
[1:07:35] ask God God do you want me to take it
[1:07:37] there and then we need to hear his voice
[1:07:38] as well amen
[1:07:40] I like that he sighed deeply it's just
[1:07:43] like when Jesus rejoice in spirit I
[1:07:45] thank you Lord that you hid these things
[1:07:47] from the wise and prudent and revealed
[1:07:49] them unto babes amen
[1:07:51] we might get sad thing Oh God hasn't
[1:07:54] revealed to them but Jesus like thank
[1:07:56] you no hard rejoicing thank you Lord
[1:07:59] that's given to the babes those who
[1:08:01] humble themselves t just hardcore
[1:08:04] sometimes we think everybody's as humble
[1:08:06] as us and we're not trying to be proud
[1:08:07] like that but the reality of it is if we
[1:08:10] repent of our sins it shows we have a
[1:08:11] measure of humility amen and church said
[1:08:15] but Jesus rejoice thank you God it's not
[1:08:19] given to the wise and prudent and here
[1:08:22] deeply sighing why does this generation
[1:08:25] seek after sigh I'm not gonna give them
[1:08:28] one all right I love this one this is
[1:08:31] John 2:18 they asked Jesus for a sign
[1:08:34] how are you taking this this rope and
[1:08:36] whipping us out of the temple he says
[1:08:39] well he said I'm gonna give you a sign
[1:08:40] in three days
[1:08:42] this temple be destroyed in three days
[1:08:44] I'll raise it up that's my sign that
[1:08:47] will be the sign that I had the
[1:08:49] authority to clean out the church amen
[1:08:51] I like this one the people again in John
[1:08:54] 6:30 they say show us the sign he said
[1:08:57] for the bread of God is he which comes
[1:09:00] down from heaven and gives life unto the
[1:09:02] world I am the sign because I'm the
[1:09:05] bread of God I've come down to earth and
[1:09:07] I'm gonna give life to the people amen
[1:09:10] they asked six times for a sign fallen
[1:09:12] man asked for signs and sometimes Jesus
[1:09:15] gave them sometimes he didn't praise God
[1:09:16] but we know he gave the greatest sign
[1:09:18] the greatest sign was his resurrection
[1:09:20] praise God hallelujah
[1:09:23] now these let's read these six times
[1:09:27] people bore witness to Jesus innocent
[1:09:29] before he died Theo is fallen man fallen
[1:09:33] man had to give a witness all humanity
[1:09:36] had to witness the sinner had to witness
[1:09:37] the religious man had to witness right
[1:09:40] they all had to witness that Jesus was
[1:09:43] innocent all the world has to say that
[1:09:46] he's innocent now isn't it striking
[1:09:48] Pilate and Herod and Judas all say he's
[1:09:50] innocent they go to hell we don't know
[1:09:52] what happened here but this thief got
[1:09:54] saved so see anybody can say Jesus was
[1:09:57] innocent but you've got to accept Jesus
[1:09:59] say God I'm the guilty one you died for
[1:10:01] me you died for me and now you forgive
[1:10:05] me by your blood and I accept it I want
[1:10:07] to be with you in heaven right I want to
[1:10:09] live my life in such a way that I can
[1:10:11] meet with you in heaven amen it takes
[1:10:14] that kind of faith we don't know what
[1:10:15] happened the Roman centurion he said
[1:10:17] truly this man was the son of God he was
[1:10:18] an innocent man praise God yeah we know
[1:10:23] Pilate Herod were lost program talks
[1:10:24] about the blue water
[1:10:26] remember when Pilate died there was blue
[1:10:28] water where he died and it rushes out I
[1:10:31] guess every year I know I haven't seen
[1:10:33] any evidence on that but that's what he
[1:10:35] said he said he'd read that in a book
[1:10:36] one time that that blue water rushed out
[1:10:38] when he when he drowned
[1:10:40] it came out every year as a witness that
[1:10:43] he should not have crucified the Lord
[1:10:46] now six times they bore witness of his
[1:10:50] innocence actually let's just skip those
[1:10:51] because I don't if I don't get started
[1:10:52] on seven I don't think I'm gonna finish
[1:10:54] on Sunday because it's so big brother
[1:10:56] branham said there were six over comers
[1:10:59] in John the Baptist day and he also said
[1:11:01] there are six over comers and every day
[1:11:02] why would he say 6 because 6 is the
[1:11:05] number of anointed man I'll read you the
[1:11:08] quote here in a minute brother Branham
[1:11:10] said Joseph and Mary were overcomers
[1:11:13] Zacharias and Elizabeth were overcomers
[1:11:15] and Simeon and Anna in the temple were
[1:11:18] over comers notice in John the Baptist
[1:11:22] time program said there was found six
[1:11:25] that had overcome all ages they had over
[1:11:28] comers and John time they had six that
[1:11:30] was Joseph and Mary Zacharias and
[1:11:32] Elizabeth Simeon an end
[1:11:33] a man and a woman a man a woman a man
[1:11:35] and woman see type of Christ the church
[1:11:38] Christ the church Christ the church
[1:11:39] Christ the church so the Bible names
[1:11:42] those six the
[1:11:43] give us a type of The Anointed men and
[1:11:45] woman and The Anointed spouse the
[1:11:47] husband and wife Jesus Christ and his
[1:11:49] bride amen hallelujah
[1:11:51] he said notice it starts from the
[1:11:54] natural men now look at this this is a
[1:11:55] great type Joseph the natural man what
[1:11:59] was he a carpenter then the priest so
[1:12:02] went from a carpenter to a priest which
[1:12:04] was a minister in the house Lord
[1:12:06] Zacharias and from that simeon a prophet
[1:12:09] and a prophetess see that's the type of
[1:12:11] justification sanctification and baptism
[1:12:14] of the Holy Ghost that's deeper than I
[1:12:17] can explain I can't I can't explain that
[1:12:19] but it goes the cow is so beautiful
[1:12:21] natural to priests to prophet amen
[1:12:24] he said don't you see it perfectly
[1:12:26] cynics overcome all the pressing they
[1:12:29] offer their sacrifice and everything but
[1:12:31] these were elected they overcame amen
[1:12:34] beautiful all right now I've only found
[1:12:38] one meaning for seven so far and that's
[1:12:42] completion I've only found one meaning
[1:12:44] so if I find more I'll let you know but
[1:12:46] I've only found one completion
[1:12:49] everything's in threes there's the there
[1:12:52] are three is a perfect number five is a
[1:12:54] number of gray seven completion twelve
[1:12:56] worship twenty-four or 40s temptation
[1:12:59] 50s a Jubilee the very word Pentecost
[1:13:01] means Jubilee or 50 now God in his
[1:13:04] numerals he's perfect in his numerals
[1:13:06] he's perfect in his word he's perfect in
[1:13:08] his action he's perfect and everything
[1:13:10] because he's a perfect God amen
[1:13:13] spoken word the original seat now the
[1:13:16] Old Testament I'm sorry has 607 sevens
[1:13:19] or eights I'm sorry I said eight hundred
[1:13:20] it was 607 so I want to try to go over
[1:13:23] those on Saturday before I preach Sunday
[1:13:25] Lord willing now I just thought I'd do a
[1:13:28] couple just came up to my mind and I was
[1:13:30] reading a little bit Joshua's army
[1:13:32] marched around Jericho seven times on
[1:13:34] the seventh day with seven priests
[1:13:37] bearing seven trumpets of ram horns
[1:13:40] going before the ark lots of sevens and
[1:13:42] remember this is interesting because it
[1:13:45] contained a shout and a trump because he
[1:13:48] said shout on the seventh day at the
[1:13:50] sound of the Trump so all's we need is a
[1:13:52] voice shout voice Trump
[1:13:55] so it's interesting it seems like it's a
[1:13:57] tie
[1:13:57] of the rapture but I'm not for sure
[1:14:00] because it doesn't say literal voice in
[1:14:01] there but it's interesting all those
[1:14:03] sevens and then it has a shout and a
[1:14:05] trump 7,000 men did not bother need to
[1:14:09] bail in the days of Elijah name and the
[1:14:12] leper had to dip seven times in the
[1:14:13] Jordan River to be cleansed amen
[1:14:19] now there's 53 hits on seven this is in
[1:14:24] oh yeah I didn't get to these yet
[1:14:26] there's 53 hits in the New Testament I'm
[1:14:29] sorry yeah I think the New Testament
[1:14:31] I'm sorry got little mixed up there now
[1:14:33] every I have to remember to add to the
[1:14:35] list that the sixes and sevens go well
[1:14:38] because there were six waterpots Jesus
[1:14:40] changed but Christ was the seventh water
[1:14:42] pot the woman at the well had six
[1:14:45] husband Jesus was her real true husband
[1:14:47] and there were six barley sheaves given
[1:14:49] from Boaz to Ruth
[1:14:50] but Christ was the real Boaz amen all
[1:14:53] right now let's go through the book of
[1:14:55] Revelation and I think I'm finished with
[1:14:56] this by God's grace alright so remember
[1:15:00] it's the book of Revelation or the book
[1:15:02] of completion it's the finishing up of
[1:15:05] the entire Bible there are seven angels
[1:15:08] to seven churches there are seven
[1:15:11] candlesticks there are seven spirits of
[1:15:14] God are seven lamps before the throne of
[1:15:16] God there are seven stars in the hand of
[1:15:19] Christ they're seven seals around the
[1:15:22] book that are loose there are seven
[1:15:24] thunders that utter on the earth when
[1:15:26] the book is open there are seven angels
[1:15:29] holding seven trumpets in the
[1:15:30] tribulation there are seven angels
[1:15:33] having the seven last plagues in
[1:15:35] Revelation 15 and 21 there's seven
[1:15:38] golden vials full of the wrath of God
[1:15:40] given to the seven angels by the four
[1:15:43] beasts isn't that interesting the four
[1:15:45] beasts that representing the four
[1:15:47] anointings for the Gentile dispensation
[1:15:49] they handed over the seven golden vials
[1:15:51] it's interesting like perhaps they they
[1:15:54] they were there they were the anointing
[1:15:56] that it took to bring up all these
[1:15:58] prayers and they bring all these vials
[1:16:00] over there to the seven angels so
[1:16:02] interesting it seems like it's connected
[1:16:04] somehow
[1:16:05] the the the two prophets minister for
[1:16:08] forty-two months which is six
[1:16:11] sevens six sevens the Ministry of two
[1:16:14] profits 7,000 men are killed by an
[1:16:17] earthquake during the second whoa
[1:16:18] immediately after the sixth and final
[1:16:21] rapture of revelation 1113 of course we
[1:16:25] love this one the seventh angel finishes
[1:16:27] the mystery of God in Revelation 10
[1:16:30] seven Amen the completion by the seventh
[1:16:32] angel praise the Lord Christ the bloody
[1:16:36] lamb has seven horns and seven eyes
[1:16:39] which are the seven spirits of God sent
[1:16:42] forth into all the earth let's read that
[1:16:45] from Revelation 5:6 I think opening mix
[1:16:52] that one up here Revelation 5:6
[1:17:00] okay yeah that was right I was thinking
[1:17:03] the one that was full of eyes that was
[1:17:04] the beast in heaven right yeah that was
[1:17:05] the Beast never were full of eyes but
[1:17:07] Christ had seven eyes verse six and I
[1:17:11] beheld lo in the midst of the throne of
[1:17:12] the four beasts in the midst of the
[1:17:14] elders stood a lamb as it been slain
[1:17:16] having seven horns and seven eyes which
[1:17:19] are the seven spirits of God sent forth
[1:17:21] into all the earth praise God's that's
[1:17:24] right
[1:17:24] I thought I'd mix that up I thought
[1:17:26] Jesus was full of eyes but no that's the
[1:17:28] that's the four cherubims in heaven
[1:17:30] alright thank you
[1:17:31] now in Revelation 1 I'm gonna jump back
[1:17:34] up to revelation 1 there's the Sevenfold
[1:17:36] glory of Christ person and I preached
[1:17:40] this a couple years ago so I'll just
[1:17:41] show you the picture here the Bible said
[1:17:44] he had the face as the countenance of
[1:17:45] the son this represents the power of
[1:17:47] righteousness or light in his face he
[1:17:51] had the hair of white hair which
[1:17:53] represents a crown of wisdom and this is
[1:17:56] all from the church age book he had eyes
[1:17:58] of fire which are angry eyes that see
[1:18:01] the motives of hearts because remember
[1:18:02] this is Jesus a Sevenfold glory when he
[1:18:05] returns on the Lord's Day so this is him
[1:18:08] how he looks when he's riding the white
[1:18:10] horse coming down for the Battle of
[1:18:12] Armageddon
[1:18:12] his voice is mighty waters which his
[1:18:17] multitudes of voices rogram said
[1:18:19] speaking out condemnation against all
[1:18:21] the ungodly and sinners
[1:18:24] his feet are like a furnace of fire
[1:18:26] because he has untempered judgment
[1:18:30] crushing all his enemies under his feet
[1:18:32] amen he's crushing all the enemies under
[1:18:34] his feet aren't you glad though that the
[1:18:36] Bible says now that Satan will like
[1:18:39] Christ will bruise Satan shortly under
[1:18:40] your feet amen
[1:18:43] I like some furnace a hot fire or feet
[1:18:46] myself wouldn't you I like my feet to
[1:18:48] have that fire too I want to put Satan
[1:18:49] under my feet amen
[1:18:51] it's the fires of judgment God has
[1:18:53] judged that already and it's under my
[1:18:55] feet and I'm living above that
[1:18:57] temptation I'm living above that trial
[1:18:59] amen crushing all enemies under on the
[1:19:02] feet hallelujah and of course the sword
[1:19:06] of the Spirit which is the word of God
[1:19:08] but a man who said that judges everyone
[1:19:10] and judges everything hallelujah because
[1:19:13] as no no respecter persons and the stars
[1:19:16] represent the messengers in his loving
[1:19:19] care and power the Sevenfold glory of
[1:19:22] Christ person on the Lord's Day and that
[1:19:25] beautiful oh my
[1:19:27] high praise thorn thank God now let's
[1:19:31] keep going here in the book of
[1:19:32] Revelation I think I'm almost done here
[1:19:34] I didn't read as much as I normally do
[1:19:37] if it's a little shorter that might be
[1:19:39] good because I'm actually exhausted this
[1:19:41] week I could use a little rest here but
[1:19:43] I'm trying to get press through and
[1:19:45] preach as hard as I can
[1:19:46] now the Sevenfold worship this is
[1:19:48] something I never saw before or just
[1:19:51] read this of Christ by the voice of the
[1:19:53] many angels round about the throne so
[1:19:55] they're the angels worship him twice in
[1:19:57] Revelation 5 and revelation 7 and they
[1:20:01] say he's worthy to receive power in
[1:20:03] Revelation 5 he also says power in
[1:20:06] revelation 7 all these angels he says
[1:20:08] riches but he actually in Chapter 7 he
[1:20:11] says Thanksgiving or might and he says
[1:20:14] wisdom and wisdom is again repeated so
[1:20:16] five things are repeated interesting not
[1:20:18] sure why then they says strength which
[1:20:21] strength would be your Thanksgiving and
[1:20:23] might below honor both say honor both
[1:20:26] say glory and both say blessing unto our
[1:20:30] God for ever and ever amen
[1:20:32] and that beautiful God lets the Angels
[1:20:35] give out seven blessings to God
[1:20:38] right some of the Angels the chair the
[1:20:40] beasts say holy holy holy
[1:20:42] but the angels are the regular angels
[1:20:44] we'd say they cry out a seven full
[1:20:46] worship of God the Bible said they fall
[1:20:48] down and worship and say power riches
[1:20:51] wisdom strength honor glory and blessing
[1:20:54] I think we need to praise God some more
[1:20:56] don't see who Amen we just sing a few
[1:20:59] songs and you know worship the Lord I
[1:21:01] think it's good to get coffee and
[1:21:03] worship don't you and give God a
[1:21:04] Sevenfold worship hey man hey thank you
[1:21:07] Jesus glory glory glory glory glory
[1:21:10] glory glory amen
[1:21:12] all these blessings and these are from
[1:21:14] holy perfect creatures too that are not
[1:21:17] even under the blood but were under the
[1:21:19] blood we know what grace is we ought to
[1:21:21] give them a seven for worship as well
[1:21:23] hallelujah let's say power to say power
[1:21:26] Eddie power let's say riches let's say
[1:21:30] wisdom let's say strength let's say
[1:21:33] honor let's say glory and let's shout
[1:21:36] blessing blessing
[1:21:37] amen hallelujah if angels can do that
[1:21:40] what about you and I oh thank you Jesus
[1:21:43] I love that they're not limited just
[1:21:46] glory and then they can they leave
[1:21:49] Church they got so much glory stored up
[1:21:52] in them they just give seven fold
[1:21:54] worship a complete worship to God
[1:21:56] Almighty amen
[1:21:59] they don't do it one time they do it
[1:22:01] twice and no doubt they do it all
[1:22:04] throughout eternity
[1:22:05] I like that God is God is wanting us to
[1:22:08] see this is what complete worship is oh
[1:22:10] lord thank you for your power in my life
[1:22:13] you saved me from the power of darkness
[1:22:15] I used to be under the power of darkness
[1:22:17] lord thank you for the spiritual riches
[1:22:19] you've given me and all so natural we
[1:22:22] have a lot of natural riches rightness
[1:22:23] in this country thank you for the wisdom
[1:22:26] you've given to me not to walk in
[1:22:28] foolishness but to walk in wisdom I'm
[1:22:31] not a fool I know what the Holy Ghost is
[1:22:33] I know what the Holy Ghost telling me to
[1:22:34] do I follow the Holy Ghost now you're
[1:22:36] walking to wisdom thank you Lord for the
[1:22:39] strength you give me to fight another
[1:22:40] day you deserve all the honor all the
[1:22:43] glory and all the blessings
[1:22:45] bless you bless you Jesus I know you're
[1:22:48] all honor to Jesus this is true worship
[1:22:51] from perfect angels in heaven oh what a
[1:22:56] worship service that's going to be to
[1:22:58] have in church and now with that then
[1:23:00] the 24 angels they fall down and they
[1:23:02] throw their crowns down at the feet of
[1:23:03] Jesus Oh mine the Sevenfold blessing all
[1:23:07] this worship of the worthy king the
[1:23:10] worthy lamb oh I'm looking forward to be
[1:23:12] a part of that praise God amen I'm
[1:23:16] closing with this I think I only got two
[1:23:17] or three more it's gonna be one of my
[1:23:18] shorter sermons - lets go or let's just
[1:23:21] really just finish up here
[1:23:23] this is striking Balaam requested a
[1:23:27] Balak after after he already once said I
[1:23:31] can't curse Israel Balak says well let's
[1:23:34] go change location that's how carnal
[1:23:36] this man was maybe we're too close to
[1:23:39] Israel maybe we need to move somewhere
[1:23:40] else and maybe I can curse Israel from
[1:23:42] some other place that's how carnal he
[1:23:45] was he thought maybe maybe this is its
[1:23:48] kind of people today well I just can't
[1:23:49] worship God in this place I need to go
[1:23:51] someplace else
[1:23:52] well I just can't pray in my closet or I
[1:23:54] just can't seem to pray at church
[1:23:55] that's nonsense you can contact God
[1:23:57] anywhere you want amen but you need a
[1:23:59] humble heart you need to confess your
[1:24:01] sin and you need a pure heart of sincere
[1:24:03] worship before God but this guy thought
[1:24:06] oh it's just something I can just maybe
[1:24:08] I can go somewhere else and curse Israel
[1:24:10] that's how carnal he was so bailet now
[1:24:12] look how carnal Balaam is baylin's like
[1:24:14] well give me seven sacrifice to the
[1:24:16] bullocks seven Rams seven altars now he
[1:24:20] should have known once you can't curse
[1:24:21] God here
[1:24:22] you can't curse I'm sorry you can't
[1:24:24] curse Israel here you can't curse Israel
[1:24:25] there why I didn't know that but what
[1:24:29] was he he was money hungry that's what
[1:24:32] he was the Bible said the wages of
[1:24:34] unrighteousness so see it with all those
[1:24:38] dollar bills flashing before him he
[1:24:40] thought well I guess we can try it I
[1:24:42] guess we can give it a try to try to
[1:24:44] curse God's people and then he realized
[1:24:46] he was so Baxter than even that say he
[1:24:48] didn't realize you can't curse God's
[1:24:50] people and church they can't curse us
[1:24:52] either
[1:24:53] how can you curse what God is blessed
[1:24:56] how can you curse what God's already
[1:24:57] saved amen how can you curse what God's
[1:25:00] already anointed amen how many know he
[1:25:02] did of God austenite to this week praise
[1:25:04] God
[1:25:05] I needed I have five sermons to preach
[1:25:08] this week so I was a Monday night I was
[1:25:10] praying for my sermon for yesterday
[1:25:12] morning at the middle school and just
[1:25:14] came to me I was on vision and I was
[1:25:18] listening lord I really need a minute I
[1:25:19] don't really have a thought for tomorrow
[1:25:20] morning I got thirty middle schoolers
[1:25:22] coming to preach to I don't have a
[1:25:24] thought and the Lord just dropped a
[1:25:25] little thought down and he said Judas as
[1:25:30] I said Paul kept his eyes on the vision
[1:25:32] despite being whipped and Jesus kept his
[1:25:35] eyes on the vision so much so that even
[1:25:37] Peter tried to talk about him out of it
[1:25:38] he said get behind me Satan and then the
[1:25:41] scripture said he set his face as a
[1:25:43] stone towards Jerusalem and the Bible
[1:25:46] said that the meetings didn't go well
[1:25:47] the Bible says this because his face was
[1:25:49] set toward Jerusalem and the disciples
[1:25:52] got mad and said these meetings aren't
[1:25:53] as good this revivals not really
[1:25:55] happening do you want us to call fire
[1:25:56] down from heaven and Jesus says you
[1:25:57] don't know what spirits you're of you
[1:26:00] want to judge these people he said and
[1:26:03] it was it was showing us that Jesus was
[1:26:05] so focused on Calvary that he was
[1:26:07] starting to not give as much attention
[1:26:09] to the meetings because he had one goal
[1:26:11] in mind he had to do the Father's will
[1:26:13] church listen we can't do everything can
[1:26:16] we we can't do everything but we must do
[1:26:19] what God is anointing us to do praise
[1:26:22] God we must find the season of our lives
[1:26:24] the season were in and do what God has
[1:26:27] called us to do and so I preached that
[1:26:30] and a brother come up every said mine he
[1:26:31] said God was speaking to me on both
[1:26:33] levels he called me up today to tell me
[1:26:34] again that really spoke to me it spoke
[1:26:37] to me on different levels we've got to
[1:26:38] keep our eyes on the vision so both
[1:26:41] Balaam and Judas got their eyes off the
[1:26:43] vision of the word and put it on money
[1:26:45] how sad is that
[1:26:46] now what's striking Church is 400 years
[1:26:49] later
[1:26:49] remember David sacrificed every six
[1:26:52] steps we saw that we saw that last week
[1:26:54] I think Wednesday night I preached out
[1:26:55] at my house every six steps David would
[1:26:58] stop and sacrifice and this is what he
[1:27:00] sacrificed he did the same exact
[1:27:03] sacrifice as Balaam did so see God as
[1:27:07] God loves a7 right God loves seven God
[1:27:10] love and look I say like this God loves
[1:27:12] a complete sacrifice from you and I God
[1:27:15] likes when we come to church and we
[1:27:16] don't give half of our effort we give
[1:27:18] all of our effort
[1:27:19] he likes the seven which for us doesn't
[1:27:22] mean well I think we got to sing seven
[1:27:23] songs it doesn't mean that we've got to
[1:27:25] completely yield ourselves to the holy
[1:27:27] spirit right pray with all of our hearts
[1:27:30] sing with all of our hearts worship say
[1:27:32] Amen with all of our hearts be fully
[1:27:34] into it give him a complete sacrifice
[1:27:36] and he's well pleased with a complete
[1:27:38] sacrifice Oh glory but see Balaam knew
[1:27:42] that's how you get to God you got to
[1:27:43] give a complete sacrifice and remember
[1:27:45] God spoke to him and said don't you
[1:27:47] can't curse him he said can I go up can
[1:27:50] I go can I go with Balak he said fine
[1:27:51] just go but you're only gonna say what I
[1:27:53] tell you to say so Satan that Satan's
[1:27:57] imitation of seven because behind all of
[1:27:59] that Balaam had the heart to teach them
[1:28:02] fornication and 24,000 died because he
[1:28:06] taught him to fornicate so behind all
[1:28:08] that that's her brother barren tells us
[1:28:10] he said Moses was the real one and
[1:28:12] Balaam was the impersonator and he tried
[1:28:14] to copy him he said Balaam was right a
[1:28:16] hundred percent fundamentally now what
[1:28:18] does that tell us about the message in
[1:28:20] this our people are gonna be
[1:28:21] fundamentally right preaching water
[1:28:23] baptism the Godhead they're not gonna
[1:28:25] believe in three persons that's how
[1:28:27] close they're gonna be they're gonna be
[1:28:28] so fundamentally close but where's the
[1:28:32] pillar of fire Amen hallelujah
[1:28:34] we must have the pillar of fire with us
[1:28:36] amen because we must have the power the
[1:28:39] pillar of fire we must have that because
[1:28:41] that's what Moses had amen we must have
[1:28:44] more than just the anointing where
[1:28:46] Balaam had we've got to have God's
[1:28:48] presence with us how many want his
[1:28:49] presence oh it's always been in humility
[1:28:52] it's always in sincerity praise God it's
[1:28:55] not as it's not pride that brings God's
[1:28:57] power its sincerity that brings God's
[1:28:59] power if we can just be more sincere if
[1:29:02] we can just give a complete sacrifice
[1:29:05] unto God amen
[1:29:07] so seven represents his complete
[1:29:10] sacrifice unto God now isn't this
[1:29:14] striking this about blew me out of my
[1:29:15] seat I was setting last night and saw
[1:29:16] what no word I don't remember reading
[1:29:18] that Satan has come as a red dragon he
[1:29:21] tries to devour the Christ child in
[1:29:23] Revelation 12 remember the woman with
[1:29:26] the crown with twelve stars which
[1:29:27] represented Israel and how many has it
[1:29:29] Satan have seven sad
[1:29:32] in Satan takes on a seven to try to
[1:29:36] impersonate God in that just like the
[1:29:38] devil he's so so trying to be like God
[1:29:42] that he appears as a dragon with seven
[1:29:45] heads with seven Crown's on them
[1:29:48] obviously those crowns won't last right
[1:29:51] those crowns will get cast down and
[1:29:53] thoughts of those are false crowns but
[1:29:56] we know Jesus has the real crown praise
[1:29:58] God he's got the real crown he's got the
[1:30:00] real authority Satan just trying to
[1:30:02] person him I'll give myself seven
[1:30:04] Crown's I'll be the complete King I'll
[1:30:06] be the complete Dragon the complete
[1:30:07] power but it's all impersonation he's
[1:30:10] imitating the true Christ the Beast out
[1:30:15] of the sea has seven heads and the
[1:30:20] scarlet coloured Beast so is it's the
[1:30:22] same beast has seven heads in revelation
[1:30:24] 17 whom the mother harlot row
[1:30:26] representing seven mountains on which
[1:30:28] the woman sat so seven heads on that
[1:30:31] scarlet coloured Beast representing the
[1:30:33] seven mountains there it is again Rome
[1:30:36] trying to personate the New Jerusalem
[1:30:39] right that's exactly right representing
[1:30:43] seven mountains on which the woman said
[1:30:45] now seven kings in Revelation 1710 but
[1:30:49] the Beast is the eight now this is gonna
[1:30:50] be a number we can use in the for the
[1:30:52] eight here's Satan impersonating the
[1:30:54] eighth now I don't know what this seven
[1:30:56] kings represents in revelation 17 there
[1:30:58] are seven kings but the beast is the
[1:31:00] eight and he comes out of the seventh
[1:31:02] some people have said it's the seventh
[1:31:03] Pope after you know one of the other
[1:31:06] popes I'm not sure I'm not kind of that
[1:31:08] but one thing's for sure that beast or
[1:31:10] the Antichrist comes out of that seventh
[1:31:13] king and he's the 8th King so I'm not
[1:31:16] sure how that works out but that's what
[1:31:17] the scripture says and I'm done let's
[1:31:20] stand to our feet by God's grace I'm at
[1:31:21] the close right there
[1:31:22] that's one of my shortest sermons in a
[1:31:24] long time not as short as Sunday night
[1:31:25] but pretty short how many know God's
[1:31:29] perfect in sevens praise God hallelujah
[1:31:38] I think the one that speaks to us the
[1:31:39] most is the worship with a complete
[1:31:41] heart to worship with completion to give
[1:31:46] God praise to give God a complete
[1:31:48] worship by God's grace man I come here
[1:31:52] so let's just do that let's worship the
[1:31:54] Lord here with the complete worship
[1:31:57] let's give him glory honor and praise
[1:32:00] praise the Lord amen I seen a song
