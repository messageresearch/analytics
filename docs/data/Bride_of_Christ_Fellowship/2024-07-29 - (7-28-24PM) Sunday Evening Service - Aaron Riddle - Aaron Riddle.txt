TRANSCRIPT
========================================
amen will you may be seated for a moment I just wanted to take a a moment to thank brother Jesse and his wife and the church for the fellowship that we've had um and the hospitality that was extended to us um you know it's it we're very grateful and we've had a blessed time amen um so so thank you for for opening up your church and your home for Fellowship um it to to us it feels like a family reunion you know we just we just feel right at home right here um and I guess Brother Paul's snuck out for a moment but I wanted to commend brother Paul for yielding himself this morning to the Holy Spirit um we were all certainly very very blessed this morning amen praise God um so uh let's just uh stand for a word of prayer and reading of scripture Heavenly Father Lord we are so thankful to be in your house this evening we thank you for being with us in the worship and the pr praise and the Thanksgiving Lord God and Lord I just I know I have a few notes written down I just pray that uh I would yield myself to you that you would speak this evening that you would bless your people father Lord we we give you praise and thanksgiving and commit the service and the word into your hands Lord Jesus we ask these things in the Lord Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen so um I'm so thankful how the holy spirit moves and and works um I had uh I had um been praying about what to to bring as we knew about the trip you know a couple months ago um and we were looking forward to coming and and uh the Lord had just put on my heart to bring back a message that I had preached in December um uh gold tried in the fire um so you know that that stuck on my heart and I didn't open it up to study or anything like that um I had trips and things that I was doing and I was getting around to it you know probably within the last week or so um and then um brother Paul had told me what he was studying on and we were you know he was preaching on the revelation of Jesus Christ last week and I knew he was going to be getting into ephes and I'm wondering well how's my message going to tie in um and then when I opened up uh my message to to to study I had forgotten the scripture so the scripture that we'll be reading from is revelation 3 that's right so he preached on Revelation 2 this morning I'm preaching out of Revelation 3 so it looks like it's planned but it's been planned by the holy spirit amen so we're going to start on Revelation 3 and verse [Music] 14 so he started in Ephesus and I'm going to come tonight with Le oosa so we had Alpha this morning and tonight we're going to have omega am amen so Revelation 3 verse1 14 it says and unto the angel of the Church of the leans write these things saith the amen the faithful and true true witness the beginning of the creation of God I Know Thy works that thou art neither cold nor hot I would that thou were cold or hot so then because Thou Art lukewarm and neither cold nor hot I will spew thee out of my mouth because thou sayest I am rich and increase with goods and have need of nothing and knoweth not that thou are wretched miserable and poor and blind and naked verse 18 I counsel thee to buy of me gold old tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich and in white rment that thou mayest be clothed and that the shame of thy naked nakedness do not appear and anoint thine eyes with isab that thou mayest see and as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be zealous therefore and repent that's a powerful statement right there right zealous means fervent without hesitation yes right and he's saying that he loves you right and he wants us to be zealous to repent and some people say they have nothing to repent for but here it's telling us to be zealous about it amen amen behold I stand at the door and knock and if any man hear my voice and open the door I will come in to him and I will s with him and he with me to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne even as uh even as I also overcame and am set down with my father in his throne he that hath an ear let him hear what the scripture saith unto the churches amen you may be seated Spirit say to the churches all right so what is lukewarm it's not hot it's hot in here tonight but it's not lukewarm what does it mean to be lukewarm I mean on the service we you know it it sounds like you know someone that's complacent right where you have enough salvation you have enough of Jesus to have salvation but he's not Lord okay that's very commonly how uh we think of being lukewarm but in uh the exposition on the church ages from the leosan church it brother brand goes a little bit further and he was definitely very intimately involved in the writing of this as we are going to look at this carefully it says that this layout and this is just for a background this says that the leian church age group is lukewarm this lukewarmness Demands a penalty from God the penalty is that they will be spewed out of his mouth um here is where we do not want to go astray as a lot of folks do and here he says he's talking to the church furthermore if you will just keep the word in mind you will recall that nowhere does it say that we are in the mouth of God we are engraved in his PO Ms we are carried in his bosom way back in the unknown ages before time we were in his mind we are his Sheepfold and in his PES but never in his mouth but what is in the mouth of the Lord the word is in his mouth amen Matthew 4:4 but he uh answered and saith it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God so what is wrong with these people people of the last day they have gotten away from the word amen they are no longer fervent about it they are lukewarm about it so what does that mean and and I'm kind this is going to kind of be a little bit of a recap of what brother Paul already spoke this morning and he goes into the Baptist saying the Baptists have their Creeds and dogmas based on the word right and you can't shake them they say the apostolic days of Miracles are over and there's no baptism with the Holy GES subsequent to believing right when you believe you got it that's not just Baptist that's also some people in the message as well but the devil believes and he trembles right um here it says uh uh subsequent to believing the method to say based on the word there is no water baptism sprinkling is not baptism and that sanctification is the baptism of the Holy Ghost so they're saying their works is what proves that they have the Holy Ghost the Church of Christ majors in regeneration or baptism and in all too many cases they go down dry Sinners and come up wet ones says yet they claim their Doctrine is word-based go right down the line and come to the Pentecostals do they have the word give them the word test and see yes they will sell out the word for a sensation just about every time that's right if you can produce a manifestation like oil and blood and tongues and other signs whether in the word or not or whether properly interpreted from the word the majority of it will fall for it exactly what brother Paul was preaching this morning but what has happened to the word the word has been put aside that's right so God says I'm going against you all and I will spew you out of my mouth this is the end for the SE for seven out of Seven Ages I have seen nothing but men esteeming their word above mine so that's that's what it means to be lukewarm prise God says so at the End of the Age I am spewing you out of my mouth it is all over I'm going to speak all right yes I'm here in the midst of the church yes the amen of God the faithful and true will reveal himself and it will be my Prophet oh yes that is so Revelation 10:7 says in the last days of the voice of the seventh messenger when he shall begin to sound the mystery of God should be finished as he had declared to his servants the prophets there it is he is sending sending a Vindicated prophet and it's to those that have a revelation it's just obvious right like you you read it it speaks to your heart and it's alive he is sending a Propet after almost 2,000 years he is sending someone who is so far from the organization education and the world of religion that is John the Baptist and Elijah of old he will hear only from God and he will have thus sayith the Lord and speak for God hallelujah he will be God's mouthpiece amen and he as it is declared in Malachi 4:6 will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers yes he will bring back the elect of the last day and they will hear a Vindicated Prophet give the exact truth as it was with Paul amen what we heard this morning he will restore the truth as they had it and those elect with him in in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the Lord and be his body and be his voice and perform his Works amen hallelujah do you see it yes amen he says a a momentary consideration so I'm still just doing background here a momentary consideration of church history will prove how accurate this thought is in the Dark Ages the word was almost entirely lost right but then God sent Luther with the word the Lutheran spoke for God at the time but then they organized right then God sent Wesley and and his voice with the word for his day and then they organized and that's where the Methodist failed right but he says yes sir the church is no longer the mouthpiece of God it's its own mouthpiece exactly amen so that's how you define who is luk warm when the church is its own mouthpiece so amen so God is turning on her he will confound her through the prophet and the bride for the voice of God will be in her says yes it is for it says in the last chapter of Revelation verse 17 the spirit and the bride say come once more the world will hear direct from God as at Pentecost amen so how do we get back to that right um now he has cried out to this last age you have the word you have more Bibles than ever but you are not doing anything about the word except dividing and hacking it into pieces praise God taking what you want and leaving out what you don't want yes says you're not interested in living it but debating it that's right amen this is the prophet's words right so if you want to know who's lukewarm well if that's what's happening where you're arguing over it instead of living it well if the shoe fits right amen hallelujah amen praise God I would sooner you were cold or hot if you were cold and rejected it I could stand that if you would get white hot to know its truth and live it I would praise you for that but when you simply take my word and don't honor it I in return must refuse to honor you I will spew you out um for you nauseate me amen praise God so it said in the last days as was declared by Malachi 46 I will will turn the hearts of the children back to the fathers right and he will bring back the elect of the last days and they will hear a Vindicated Prophet which we're so thankful forj amen the exact truth as it was with Paul so I know that I have the word of the revealed word of the Lord as Jesus revealed it amen right so what they were performing in the book of Acts if I want the same thing I know that I have it because the prophet brought back the same word amen praise God he will restore the truth as they had it and those elect with him in that day will be the ones who truly manifest the Lord and be his body his voice and perform his works so how do we make sure we're part of that body voice and have his works right so we'll go back to uh Verse 18 how do we escape in this day I counsel thee to buy me gold tried in the fire yeah if we want to escape we have to be gold tried in the fire right because if when we're gold tried in the fire it says then we may be rich right we won't think we're rich like the ones that are spewed out of his mouth we will be rich because we're gold tried in the fire and we will have white rment so in order for me to have a white rment in this time I must be gold tried in the fire amen I want to get ahead of myself I get get excited about it I get excited because you can't politicize this right you you can't say think a certain way do a certain thing because gold tried and fire is character right it's not you're not got to be putting on heirs right it's something that is forged by God right amen hallelujah and this is such a a beautiful statement it's not only said in Revelation there's other scriptures that I'll get to he says as many as I love I rebuke and chasen amen so the Lord showed his love to us this morning right we should rejoice when we get rebuked and Chas him by the Lord because that shows that he loves us amen praise God Amen to him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my Throne what a blessing hallelujah amen so overcome in this day we must be gold tried in the fire to have white rment and I'm joyful for his rebukes and his chastising amen and that only could happen when I open my heart fully to him amenallah so what does it mean to be gold tried and fire right if we want to know how to have white rment we really need to understand the process of gold tried in the fire we need to know what the process is and how to stand without wavering through it amen because if we don't understand the full process of gold tried in the fire the devil can shake us amen Jesus said in St John 12 and verse 23 he says Jesus answered them saying The Hours come that the son of man should be glorified verily verily I say unto you except a corn of wheat fall into the ground and die it abideth alone but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit so the only way we can bring forth fruit is if we die amen praise God in the seven Church ages brother Bram says a man can't join church or get emotional worked up or anything else and become a Christian it's got to be a solid birth of the spirit sincerity dying out crying out laying there he's dead twice prise God remember life can only come out of death amen it says in the midst of corruption Comes The Germ of life that gives it life and produces more so the only way we're able to produce fruit or produce more is if we die right Hallelujah so what are we producing right and I'm I'm saying stuff that you know right what are we producing what is the fruit right Galatians 5 says in verse 22 but the fruit of the spirit is love joy peace longsuffering gentleness goodness Faith meekness Temperance against such there is no law and they that are Christ have crucified the flesh with the affections of the lust and if we live in the spirit let us also walk in the spirit so I god is perfect he knows what he's doing right because I can't manufacture fruit right I may understand it intellectually I might I may understand the definition of patience but because I read what patience is doesn't mean I have it right the only way that I can experience patience is to go through something that's going to require patience amen praise God so fruit is character and character is forged by experience amen amen in the lamb and the dove he says a sheep was never asked to manufacture manufactur wool he was asked to Bear wool and so it is with the church the Christian church we are never asked to manufacture fruits we are asked to bear fruit Galatians 5 the fruit of the spirit he says these are not to be manufactured there to be Products that come from the inside out the outside life that we live prove what's on the inside amen amen now we have tried to manufacture this to manufacture the fruits of the spirit it always turns out to be hypocrisy right like when you mentally understand something but you have no patience or Temperance right you claim to have Temperance right then all of a sudden you get into that situation that rears its ugly head and yes now you living in hypocrisy yes sir amen good amen Christianity it's an experience by a spirit that lives in you and bears fruit of itself you cannot you cannot Manu manufacture it we have tried to educate it we have tried to denominate it and we we do uh when we do we turn out hypocrisy and failure that's right amen it's uh not done as God intended the spirit inside us bearing fruits of its presence that's God's program and it could never be changed amen praise Goden thank you Lord so we need we need to be willing to Die the death of a corn of wheat to be able to bear fruit of the spirit right where we forfeit our own rights right Jesus where Jesus is not just my savior but he's my Lord amen I have to be willing like a lamb amen where all I have I give to God right where I forfeit My Wo he says when we're willing to Forfeit our ideas to follow God right and in here I like this cuz I'm an American and this is a true statement he says uh we're Americans and Americans can't be led so if you stay in your American Spirit you know we we like to be out front right we we like to lead he says um uh we know all about it and we know how to lead so the dove can't lead us right that's where we become Christians we become pilgrims and strangers and I'm no longer an American I'm a citizen of Heaven amen praise God when we've got that kind of attitude why we can't be led we've got to when we say we've got to lead the people but God's the one leader uh from his for his church right he's the holy spirit is the leader amen Matthew 16 uh verse 24 says then Jesus said unto his disciples If any man will come after me let him deny himself yeah and take up his cross and follow me amen that's where Jesus becomes my Lord and not just my savior praise God hallelujah amen right this is where where brother Paul had had on hit on this this morning as well he says we must welcome him Lord come into my house if there's anything if there's anything in there that you want help yourself right the great king the creator of heavens and earth has knocked at my door and I want him to come in right this is what we were doing this morning any bad thing that's in me discover every secret that's in my my heart go in every door search me out amen I want you here and I welcome you in to be my Lord amen right just not my savior but my Lord including all the doors to my heart even where it's called my private life right this is from door to door amen I turn it all over to Christ amen so if we want to display fruit of the spirit what are we trying to die then too right what do we want to have burnt out of us so what is the opposite of the fruit of the spirit 1 Peter 2 verse uh 1 and 2 wherefore laying aside all malice and all guile and all hypocrisies and envies and all evil speaking as newborn babes desire the sincere milk of the word that ye may grow thereby so what is malice right malice is the desire to cause pain or distress to someone else right when someone else kind of ticks you off right and you want to get back at them well that's that's malice or guile uh guile is deceitful cunning when I'm not being completely truthful of my intentions hypocrisy we talked about that already right where I say one thing and I do another exactly um Envy Envy is the resentful awareness of an advantage enjoyed by someone else I want what they have right Pride that's a good one sometimes that's hard to recognize CU pride is the exaggerated self-esteem right like it's good to have confidence but if I'm prideful and I exaggerate my abilities or I I could do it on my own or I don't need God or I don't need help um being prideful temper right proness to anger right so these are the things that we need to die too in order to be able to display the fruits of the spirit amen Hebrews 12 verse one and and two wherefore seeing we uh we also are compassed about with so great a cloud of witnesses let us lay aside every weight and sin which doth easily beset us and let us run with patience the race that is set before us looking unto Jesus the author and finisher of our faith who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross always struggle with that and another scripture that I'll get too it ISS uh who for the joy that was set before him endured the cross right and there's another scripture that talks about you know count it all joy when you fall into diverse Temptations amen right am I supposed to be joyful by hard trials amen well we'll get to that praise the Lord amen so now that we've surrendered our heart to him we want him to be Lord and not just savior right and we know that we cannot manufacture the fruits of the spirit right so it's nothing that you're going to do on your own right I'm not going to intellectually as I mentioned display longsuffering or meekness right that's that's not possible so it said the Lord chastises those he loves amen right right we all he's asking us to do is surrender to him right so what is this process what is the biblical process uh for this right that comes by experience right going back to Revelation 3 where it says I counsel thee to buy of me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich so we know we need to be tried in the fire as gold and that's what's going to make us rich yes right and this is where I was just referring to James 1 feels like a contradiction where James 1 and verse2 says my brethren count it all joy when you fall fall into diverse Temptations and without understanding that just feels wrong almost right like why should I be joyful when I'm going to go through pain I'm going to go through a trial I'm going to go through a test no but James 1 is saying count it all joy right why knowing this that the trying of your faith worketh patience oh there's a fruit of the spirit but let patience have her perfect work that ye may be perfect mature that you may be mature entire wanting nothing and if any man lack wisdom let him ask of God that giveth to all men liberally and abrath not and it shall be given see I knew I was on the beam this morning brother Tony amen amen wow amen so does this mean I need to be happy through my pain no but it's us having understanding that what I'm going through is for my benefit amen praise God right Hebrews 12 and verse 5 says and ye have forgotten the exhortation which speaketh unto you as unto children my son wow despise not that the chastening of the Lord nor faint when thou art rebuked of him right it's it's a natural inclination to to feel shame when we get rebuked right because something's being exposed right but it's saying despise not that right for the Lord loveth uh the for whom the Lord loveth he chasen so when you get rebuked or when that gets exposed in your life you should count it Joy because that's showing you God loves you right otherwise he would you don't even have to pay attention to you but the fact that that's happening is the love of God to you prise God Amen and gorgeous every son whom he receiveth right so the reason I'm getting chastised is because I'm his son I have the privilege to be the son of the of Jehovah God Amen praise God if you endure chastening God dealth with you as with sons so that's how I could count it Joy right when I'm going through diverse Temptations and trials and tests because that proves that I'm his son amen amen so that tell the devil that next time he tries to make you feel bad for something that you're going through amen well I'm a Son of God Amen praise God verse 10 says for they ver for they verily for a few days chasen us after their own Pleasures but he for our profit that we might be partakers of his Holiness now no chastening for the present seem to be joyous right so doesn't mean you have to be happy when it when it's happening but but Grievous nevertheless afterward it yieldeth the Peaceable fruit of righteousness unto them which are exercised thereof so I know that it's going to produce fruit yes it is amen praise God so this is where I wanted to get to so that's my background we know we're going to go through trials we know we're going to go to through Temptations but count it Joy because that means you are a child of God you are a son and daughter of God Amen but what is this process like there are many scriptures in the Bible that type it to gold trid and fire Proverbs 17:3 it says the fining pot is for silver and the furnace for gold but the Lord trith the hearts Isaiah 48:10 says behold I have refined thee but not with silver I have chosen thee in the furnace of Affliction wow amen uh 1 Peter 1 uh starting with verse three says blessed be the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which Accord according to His abundant Mercy hath begotten us again unto Lively Hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead all right so showing us his grace and mercy to us for what to an inheritance Incorruptible glory and undefiled and that fadeth not away reserved in heaven for me for you amen who are kept by the power of God through faith yes so you are kept by the power of God God through faith unto salvation ready to be revealed in the last time wherein you greatly Rejoice though now for a season if need be you are in heaviness through manifold temptations that the trial of your faith being much more precious than gold that perish though it be tried with fire it is might be found unto praise and honor and Glory at the appearing of Jesus Christ right so that should be my prayer is God try me like gold right amen so what are the stages of being tried as gold in the fire I mean because it's an ancient practice so I think to truly overcome we need to understand each stage of the process right stage one breaking up kind of had this this morning what is the first step of the refiner of gold the refiner Begins by breaking up rough ore and rock this is so that the precious metal can be exposed to the heat of the fire right Jeremiah 2329 says is not my word like as a fire sayeth the Lord and like a hammer that breakthe to yourselves in righteousness reap in Mercy break up your fellow ground amen so that's the first step is him breaking up our fow ground so that the precious metal the fruits of the spirit Spirit can be exposed stage two the refiner puts crushed and broken ore into The Crucible the definition of Crucible is a situation of severe trial in which different elements interact leading to the creation of something new and in Crucible in the old times is a pot that can withstand heavy fire and The Rock gets put into The Crucible it's a fireproof Melting Pot able to withstand extreme heat amen so Zechariah 13 verse 9 says and I will bring the third part through the fire and will refine them as silver is refined and I will try them as gold is tried they shall call on my name and I will hear them I will say it is my people and they shall say the Lord is my God Amen so things that I've talked about many of us already understand right we understand that we need to go through severe trials we know that our ground needs to be broken up and we know that we need to go through the heat for the for the precious metal to be exposed but I think many Christians don't understand the next parts of the process and and when we're going through these tests and trials and this is where the devil likes to discourage you and and trip you up if you don't understand the following steps to the refining process amen so let's let's talk about that stage three the dross the purpose of placing the ore in The Crucible in the furnace is to remove dross dross what is dross the scum or unwanted materials that forms on the surface impurities right so we have impurities malice and temper and anger and envies and hypocrisies right so that draw is within us and as we go through these trials those impurities come to the surface amen so as the ore melts in The Crucible under the watchful eye of the refiner a layer of impurities called dross eventually forms on the surface so this is where a typical Christian without experience tends to stumble because all of a sudden these things are exposed in their life and they think they failed the purpose of the refining pot The Crucible is to bring it to life to bring it to the surface so that it can be cleaned hallelujah amen praise God hallelujah amen amen amen so it is is a good thing when it is exposed amen praise God and this is where the devil tries to beat you up over it because now this has been exposed and I didn't know this was I didn't know I still had this or you know in my nature but this trial has kind of exposed it now I can deal with it amen praise God where the refiner can now skim that dross off of the gold amen praise God Proverbs 25 says take away the draw from the silver and there shall come forth a vessel for the refiner praise God Isaiah 1 and 125 says and I will turn my hand upon thee and purely Purge away thy dross and take away all thy tin and I will restore thy judges as at the first and thy counselors as at the beginning afterwards Thou shalt be called the city of righteousness a faithful City so when the Lord deals with you and that draw comes to the surface and he's able to skim that out of your life Hallelujah he will call you a faithful City amen a city of righteousness amen is it over unfortunately it is not over amen stage four the heat the refiner raises the Heat to higher degrees oh Lord I just made it through this amen you're going to raise the heat after the refiner painstakingly skims off of these impurities he then turns up the heat and places The Crucible back into the blistering furnace again and again up to seven times we are told in historical literature impurities rise to the surface why because a refiner knows that only certain certain impurities can be released at certain temperatures yeah right so only certain specially designed trials and things will bring out certain things and God will do it at the right time right so don't don't beat yourself up right like oh i' I've I've I've been walking with the Lord for 15 years and now all of a sudden in I'm in a trial and this comes to the surface I thought I dealt with that a long time ago well the Lord knew that you weren't able to deal with it properly until now amen praise God right because certain impurities are only released at certain temperatures Psalms 12 and: 6 says the words of the Lord are pure words as silver tried in a furnace of Earth purified seven times Hallelujah Thou shalt keep them oh Lord Thou shalt preserve them from this generation forever so don't fear right it's talking about being in the furnace seven times and it says very next line Thou shalt keep them oh Lord hallelujah the Lord is going to keep you amen he is the refiner praise God I believe this is from time Testament morals he says there's a memorial to the death of Christ that's his church some people don't want to live it some people will it's a testing time God is testing people today for his memorials blessed be the name of the Lord for temptation when I am weak then I am strong said Paul every son that cometh to God must first be tried and tested amen until the beater sees his reflection in the gold amen that's the way God does his church he gives you trial after trial test after test trial after trial test after test until the Life of Christ is reflected in your life Hallelujah until you become peaceful sober Hallelujah meek gentle humble ready submissive willing to turn your head on the things of the world and looking straight to Calvary it sounds like fruits of the spirit to me amen many times you think it's strange because of fiery trials and sickness and persecution it's only done to test you to get the dirt out of you Amen to get the dross away amen praise God to get the slowness out of you to wake you up to a place where you can look and see the reflection or man can see the reflection of Christ in you amen praise God right where I'm not reflecting my word I'm going to reflect his word praise God it's only strengthens you every trial and testing it only loosens The Roots so that you they can grow deeper and get a better hold amen uh so you can get down and get a better hold on the Eternal Rock of God's unmovable word praise God stage five the purification the refiner continues to remove the impurities each time with the utmost skill and patience the refiner removes the dross leaving behind gleaming gold and shimmering silver purer and more precious than before to gauge his process the refiner looks for his own reflection on the surface amen hallelujah praise God glory the more drops removed the less distorted his reflection amen the Bible says our refiner sits over the refining process to purify us so this is Malachi 3 1-3 he says behold I will send my messenger and he shall prepare the way before thee and the Lord whom you seek shall suddenly come to his Temple amen even the messenger of the Covenant whom ye Delight in behold he shall come sayeth the Lord of hosts but who may abide the day of his coming and who shall stand when he appear for he is like a Refiner's Fire and like a fuller soap and he shall sit as a refiner and purifier of the silver and he shall purify the sons of Levi and purge them as gold and silver amen so the refiner has to show great care and watch over The Crucible as it's in the fire and I'm just going to read some a few things from Spurgeon that I I thought were really uh well said he's he's well written on how he lays things out um and here he was talking talking about um the refiner he says the grandest thing that God himself can do in the purpose of his love is to purify us into his own glorious Holiness he says now notice carefully the attitude of the refiner he shall sit yes sitting looks like the attitude of indifference right says um there is uh a mental um there is the metal vexed with the white heat here in the refiner sitting down there is the child of God upon the bed of pain and he cries my Lord come and help me and there the refiner sits looks on but does not stir a hand I know we've all been there in that where you're crying out to God and you're wondering why he's not answering you in your trial and of course the question comes to your mind carest thou not that we perish yes right says the refiner sits still why should he be flurried he knows what he's at he's not hurting the silver but doing it a lasting service he's not even putting it through the a needless process right sometimes it feels like a needless process as we cry out and we don't hear a response right this is what I like he says he's taking the shortest way of working when he seems to be the longest to us right Glory he moves at the pace of perfection right because God is perfect he knows all things right so when I'm going through a trial that I don't understand right and I'm crying out to him and he's not feels like he's not responding to me but he knows what's good for me he knows what I need right and he's sitting with care over me working at the pace of perfection amen he is resolved steadily to watch The Crucible he will not go away or leave it even for a moment right he says he will never leave us or forsake us amen given up on all other cares just to sit there and watch his treasure he's determined that his servants shall be purified amen the Lord watches each one of his people as intensely as if he had not another right because God is omnipotent he knows all things so he can watch me just as much as he can watch you intently like there's nobody else amen because God is the center he's everywhere Jesus watches each one Yan obviously it's a Spurgeon right Yan me 50,000 others all of them his chosen ones that are undergoing the purifying process he is sitting down his sitting down is not because he forgets but it's because he remembers amen amen the this metal may need to be purified in a furnace of Earth seven times but I I am setting I am set upon the perfecting of the work and therefore here I place myself the Lord has had boundless patience with some of us already amen for we required a whole world of purifying and we have been very slow to receive it that's right how many sermons have we heard and yet how little have we been purified by the word I've been there how of often has the spirit striven with with us and yet every thought is not yet brought into captivity amen how often have we had near the True Fellowship with Christ and yet have again forsaken him how frequently have we had to endure the furnace of Affliction and yet our draws and Tin are not removed the refiner the refiner still preserves with a settled resolve and ceaseless love he will not give up on his gracious task here then Faith sees Divine attention and settled patience where unbelief dares to suspect unfulfilling indifference amen final stage stage six the reflection the refiner sees a clear image of himself praise God only when the refiner investigates The Crucible and sees a clear reflection of himself is the process complete finally the silver or gold attains the highest degree of Purity 2 Corinthians uh um 2 Corinthians chapter 3 and verse1 17 says now the Lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the Lord there is Liberty but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the Lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the Lord amen and in Romans 8 and16 the spirit itself Bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God and if we are children then heirs Heirs of God and Joint heirs with Christ if so be that we suffer with him that we Al we may be also glorified together for I reckon that the suffering of this present time are not worthy to be compared with the glory which shall be revealed in us why because this is what we're waiting for right here for the earnest expectation of the creature waiteth for the manifestations of the sons of God and the only way that's going to happen is gold tried in the fire to receive the white Remnant amen praise God almost done here that's power praise God this is from uh hear you him says the trees and the animal life everything is waiting for the manifestation of the sons of God the church has got to get ready right now he's talking about tutoring he says now notice as we go a little farther now if the sun was kind of a renegade boy and he did not obey the father why the tutor blushed and why the father never could give him anything but what if he was a good boy and when the father said how is my son progressing oh the tutor says father you know what your boy is just exactly like you he's about your business he does it just the way you would do it why the whole kingdom here can see your reflection right in that boy oh my that's what we want that's it reflections of Jesus Christ Hallelujah in the old world they used to take the gold and the beater would beat it and beat the draw out of it and and how he know he had it all out when his own reflection come into the gold he had all the dirt out of it and the dross out of it and that's the way God does his church he beats uh it with the power of the Gospel wow telling them telling them over give them over on this side and that side and beating out all the world and all the doubt amen right because as you go through this refining process you get more faith by experience right like like David with the bear the lion and then he was able to take on Goliath right so going through this process as you go further and higher heat right well I know I can stand the higher heat because I've been through this already and I know it's for my benefit to get the draw out praise God Amen praise God God Amen till we can see the reflection the church moving in the power of God just like Jesus was here on Earth his reflecting himself in the church now how the Holy Spirit uh how the Holy Spirit go up and say oh that church why the signs and wonders and reflections of your life is perfect they are performing everything that you did just like you said amen there's someone that's got real character amen amen that's cuzz that's what it comes down to to be able to be a reflection of Jesus Christ I have to have real character which I cannot manufacture no sir it has to be forged by the trying of my faith amen amen there's someone that's got real character that's what the Bible wants us to do that's what God wants us to do that's what the Holy Spirit wants us to do amen praise God thank you Lord getting ready to close here praise God amen so going back to James 1 my brethren count it all joy right we I can count it all joy I can honestly identify with that scripture now right where I can count it all joy when I'm going through the different Temptations and tests and trials right knowing that it's going to work my faith and and patience right where I could let patience have her perfect work uh within me right and jumping down I think this is verse 12 says blessed is the man that endureth Temptation for when he is true tried he shall receive the crown of life amen praise God hallelujah and then going back to our scripture I counsel thee to buy me gold tried in the fire that thou mayest be rich right if I want to be rich because God's economy is completely different than ours right I mean yes he can bless me he can bless my business he can bless my family like that's part of the Hebrew laws and so forth but once that hedge of protection is taken away like it was with job because the devil challenged God which he's going to do with you right right God's economy so I I completely changed my outlook on how I judge whether I'm successful or not right I'm not looking at what I have or what I could provide or or anything like that or even just the the the the circumstances and situations that I'm going through or that my children going going through just because it's a hard trial does it mean oh my gosh what's going on right I'm looking at God's currency amen his currency is character right and if I know that the trying of it is going to produce gold in a reflection of Jesus Christ well I can count at joy for for what I'm going through praise God so this is where you can tell Satan right that I'm his son right because I'm going through this I'm a Son of God right you want to confound the devil and frustrate him as you go through hard trial he's not going to know what to do with you right right cuz if if it if you're going through a Mountaintop well you're rejoicing right right all of a sudden now you're in a valley and you're still rejoicing right what do I got to do right you're going to confuse the Devil by saying well I counted all joy right because he counts me as a son I'd be worried if I wasn't going through a trial or a Temptation right because I want that character to be developed Within Me amen praise God so know that as a son and daughter of Christ Jesus sits as the refiner over you working at the pace of perfection in your life right you don't have to worry about will I make it right amen because he's working at the pace of perfection in your life to bring out the character that is needed amen so you can have confidence you could have trust in the Lord knowing that he sits over you right even even though it may not feel like he's walking with you he's sitting and watching over you at the pace of perfection right knowing that it's to bring out the reflection of Jesus Christ in my life amen and never get frustrated when the dross is exposed yes good good don't like Rejoice again then you're going to confound the devil when you do that as well like Hallelujah that was exposed now I can zealously repent as it says in Revelation right so that I can be tried as gold and have white rment right because he counts me as a son and daughter of God so I hope this helps you and better equips you as you go on Monday and Tuesday and no matter what you face know that he sits and he's with you and he's working at the pace of perfection amen so I
