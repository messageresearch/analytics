comes to minister god's word and we're thankful for god's grace you know today's palm sunday you know the the christian world kind of supports uh you know they get the kids some palms and nothing wrong with that no doubt the bible says hosanna blessed is he who comes in the name of the lord many of those people were rejoicing over lazarus raising from the dead that's why the bible said many of them came but the sad part was within one week they'd all turned on him and saying crucify him crucify him we don't want to be we don't want to be moved like that do we we want our palms to always praise jesus praise god and we want to crucify the sin that's within us praise god and so i just always remember that that's always i love palm sunday the fact that they were rejoicing but uh i want my palms i want my hands to always praise the lord and i want to be instant in season odysseys and i want to be faithful i want to be diligent i want to be a true servant of jesus christ and not be swayed by the winds of doctrine of this world so god bless you as we come into palm sunday and you know the world calls it holy week but every week for us is holy after this after this next week

don't go back to that praise god we go deeper into the word of god but brother man does say he said i've marked easter as the greatest week of the year and he said i've marked that in my heart as the greatest week of the year so that's why we do want to pray on wednesday night and then have service on good friday i love good friday services i just love coming i just love remembering jesus's cross

years ago i got to pray with my high school coach right before he passed and i just asked him are you trusting in the catholic church i said are you trusting in the blood of jesus christ he said i'm

word of god be in our lips in our hearts lord god in our memories stir up our minds by way of remembrance we pray and lord bless your people today in jesus christ's name saint said [Music] here so i just want to give a small testimony yes and for some reason but the prayer request was touching my heart because what was the chance you pray and why do you ask that's pretty much what my testimony has to be a few months ago a sister from my country because they have a financial problem so when she went to spain to work over there and in spain she got sick and she went to the hospital and they found that she had cancer the cancer was very advanced uh she kept this and the doctors and the doctors told him you better go back to your country because you're going to fight this move it's too expensive for you and your family to pay you from here take it back to your country so she went back to nicaragua and i didn't know this i just knew it yesterday but like two or three weeks ago maybe i feel in my heart to send a prayer class that i get programmed with or not and i couldn't like ever i send them i do believe there is anointing on those players because i've been getting healed because i cared in one moment and one of them went to this brother he his brother he preached and for almost four he said for over 30 years he tried to get a prayer closer and he got it now when i sent it to him and that's that week the sister came back from spain and thirdly he went to pray for her because she has an appointment friday to check the cancer and he prayed for her friday she came to the hospital and they take the test i have the testimony and now the doctor the cancer is not there [Applause] is doing you know i think we don't deserve it but his grace his mercy is so big and i don't know how to explain this yes god put in my heart to send those prayer claws they believe that the anointing is there because uh that just remind me about what the anger taught also brother brahma you are sincere when you pray nothing can stand against your prayer not even the cancer and i i do believe brother branham was insane when he prayed for and when brother steve asked about his supervisor when i hear the other two i do believe the anointing still taught those prayers and maybe i hope that we can pray for for them you know i i do believe that god is the god of me thank you so [Music] so [Music] [Music] um [Music] oh [Music] you [Music] [Music] you [Music] so [Music] happy [Music] just [Music] for me [Music] [Applause] [Music] me [Music] [Music] god [Music] [Applause]

amen let's stand and take our bibles here this morning by god's grace to be in the house of lord today appreciate the songs and the songs special there and that wonderful testimony brother jose beautiful testimony i remember when you told me you're going to send those prayer cloths brother i remember that so thank the lord we appreciate your faith that's a great example of just following the leading of the lord right making a little sacrifice no doubt it costs a little extra to mail things right just these small little sacrifices and what great results come out of just humble acts of faith praise god appreciate that brother what a beautiful testimony praise god you know we got some more prayer cloths you gave me so we might want to after service maybe pray and maybe send it with our brother uh stephen there you know if the lord would allow it and just see what the lord does if it's his will so if i forget that please remind me brother we'd like to do that by god's grace let's go to joshua chapter two we want to look uh on this series on joshua i'm gonna keep going here by the grace of the lord i'm just having a great time a jubilee time imagine i just i know every time i leave church i have to preach on joshua i feel strong i feel good in the lord and it's keeping me stronger and uh we see a lot of beautiful applications to this book it's just a tremendous book and so we're thankful for uh the word of god that we heard today we appreciate the saints that were able to come to the fellowship yesterday i appreciate everybody that could make it and we had a wonderful time we just ate a little bit and did a little bible study on esther and different questions and had some play time at the park and got to see adam and bo that was nice to see adam and bo and their two little kids there so nice to see them by god's grace so we certainly appreciate the fellowship you know we were we've been talking for a while you know how can we get more fellowship you know some people work second i work first you know how can we get more fellowship so right now the only way to do that is on saturday so that's why we do that by god's grace um and so we're thankful for the fellowship yesterday let's go to uh joshua chapter 2 verse 1. actually if you would let's go to verse nine joshua two nine yeah i think we'll just skip ahead joshua two nine i think i wanna pick up right where we left off there last sunday joshua two nine brother brown points out her faith she says i know the lord has given you the land so she had a revelation of this she had great faith uh so let's read verse nine together ready one two three and she said unto the men i know that the lord hath given you the land and that your terror is fallen upon us and that all the inhabitants of the land faith because of you amen let's go to ecclesiastes 12 1. read our monthly memory verse here ecclesiastes 12 verse 1. and then tonight lord willing we'll do another little bible study and i think i'll probably we we need to finish uh the makeup one we'll finish makeup tonight and then uh i might just start that little uh teaching i was talking about amen about about like false teachers you know just to be careful of them you know i'll start outside the message and then i'll probably go into the message in a few weeks i'm not ready today to go into that but i think i'll start outside and then work my way in ecclesiastes 12 verse 1. let's remember this children praise god let's remember this ecclesiastes 12 verse 1 let's read it on three one two three remember now thy creator in the days of thy youth while the evil days come not nor the years draw nigh when thou shalt say i have no pleasure in them let's have one more word of prayer if you ever need on your heart let's just make a known unto god heavenly father lord we just bow our heads in humility lord you see the needs on the hearts we prayed for a few lord but now lord each one of us have certain needs and we see even last week lord how you just discern situations and encourage us lord and the things we need encouraging in lord god through the word just the simple word and father we know that because the bible says the word is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart lord it discerns our hearts so let us know how near you are how much you care lord god so lord just again show us how much you care today speak to our hearts and lives use me i'm nothing lord none of us or anything apart from you we can do nothing lord god so we're fully completely depending on the holy spirit today the spirit of christ we thank you for the testimony from our brother lord you still hear heal cancer lord god when we can believe lord god so help us to believe raise our faith today and father we pray again for these needs lord the brain cancer lord the skin situation the teenager with cancer god you're more than a healer lord god you're uh lord you're a great deliverer a mighty warrior lord god a man of war so we just pray god you'd guide us lord to do our part lord so you can minister to the needs i pray in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you ezra being seated praise god you can switch over i do have a few quotes i'd like to share and i just want to share a couple maps you know by god's grace i want to say too it's good to see the blinds today by god's grace let's give them round applause good to see them by god's grace praise the lord thankful for god's love and his mercy so let's ask the holy spirit here and let's let the holy spirit preach for us here today i'll try to get out of god's way uh that's our only hope is that the holy spirit can come and help us praise god we're all we're all in desperate need of i'm in more need of the holy spirit all the time so we uh we're looking at joshua again and we'll start here and we're looking at part seven and uh you know it's it's palm sunday today but i was thinking about the real palm uh is when the bible says we all get to heaven there's a great multitude which no man can number of all nations of kindreds people's tongues stood before the throne and before the lamb and the bible says they got white robes on and palms in their hands amen and they cry with a loud voice were they saying salvation to our god which sitteth upon the throne and unto the lamb now this group is uh i believe this is the bride now there's one time brother random calls it the foolish virgin he calls it the foolish version and the seventh seal but i have seven other times he calls it the bride so i think it's the bride those seven i think seven is greater than one so and some of them are after the seals too so some people you know are curious about that but uh there's the one time he called it the bride so i need to look up and see if he got that from larkin because i've been studying larkin the last two weeks and brother and pulled numerous times of course from larkin he admitted it but i'd like to see if that one in particular is from larkin now this is the future home i believe it's the future hope the bible says as they're standing there waving the palms the bible said they'll hunger no more they'll thirst no more no nor shall the sun light on them remember the bible said in revelation 22 5 once we're in that future home we don't need the sun anymore because jesus christ is the light amen so thank god for that so i believe that's what it'll be like in the future home and imagine that time we're all gathered together every tribe nation kindred tongue that loved jesus christ that was forgiven by christ they're all in white robes a sea of what can you imagine that a sea of why all the way from the palm saying salvation to our god who sits upon the throne i believe there's a seat for me there amen there's a place for me to stand there i might be in the way back but i'm going to be standing there by god's grace oh that's the palm i want to wave right there amen oh that's just a great it's a great hope that we have is the bride of jesus christ praise god as we've been looking at the the mystery of the church is the bride that's our hope to be in that number right there it's a great number praise god thank the lord for that now let's pick up a chapter two now here's a few visuals here now uh we're looking at right before they take over jericho so the israel is camped on this side of the jordan here's the jordan there's a mediterranean sea there's the northern parts of israel and so they send the spies over you know to jericho and so we see it where they're talking there to rahab and then they're going to come back and then eventually go to gilgal before they go to jericho some people think gilgal is a little bit further south but that just gives you a little picture of the spies they you know they had to swim across jordan right they had they'd be good swimmers they needed some fit men to be spies because you know the lord didn't park the waters yet he only did that when they all went over jordan so they had to swim over and then they had a 13 mile walk imagine that a 13 mile walk to get to jericho and they had to slip in when the gates were open you know at the right time and the lord led them right to a harlot named rahab just what uh what a story isn't it story here's another picture just so you get to see how close jericho was bethlehem very close you know to jericho uh that's 13 miles i imagine you know probably like 20 or 30. um just kind of gives you an idea of the picture i don't know about you but i like to see it on the map i like to see it on a picture to kind of see what where were they at what were they doing i think i got one more oh no just two okay i i couldn't find one that i liked so i had to put a couple up there now we left off here last sunday how did she know the lord had given uh israel the land it was by revelation and we'll prove that by the bible the bible says numerous times rahab had faith so rahab had a revelation of the will of god how many know that's real faith real faith is a revelation of the will of god a lot of times church you know we operate and we have to a lot of times we have to operate in hope like we are this morning like with the brain tumor and you know the skin condition and the the cancer many of these situations we've got to operate in hope because we don't know god's perfect will for the outcome right but once god if he would by his grace make it known then we would have a revelation of god's will in other words a prophecy about what he's going to do praise god that's a great thing to have right that's amazing to have if you've got faith a revelation of god's will then you know undoubtedly what god is going to do so we've got to humble ourselves and admit many times we just have hope right we have faith we have a revelation we know god can do it but we don't know exactly is he going to do it praise god so there's nothing wrong with that because the bible said when you have real hope it maketh not ashamed amen hallelujah there is such a thing as real divine hope praise god you're unashamed of the gospel praise god you've got a hope you've got a confidence you've got something that you know is going to happen right you've got you know god's a good god you know he's faithful you know he's merciful you know he's a loving creator praise god you know he's the great physician amen amen i don't know so we've got great hope in god and we keep that hope until it's revealed by faith amen the will of god how many know you're saved today you got real faith we're not hoping we're saved we know we're saved amen because we've seen it cross over from death to life amen right we're witnesses of that we in our own lives we've seen that uh you know we we've got that confidence we've got faith and no it's a reality praise god amen and so it was revealed to her mother says this uh now in brother brahm's story he just he draws a picture he even admits it might not be right we know she was a prostitute she said we don't have much history on her let's let's imagine she was raised in a real poor house uh and she became ill fame a prostitute she's beautiful though she went to the streets to make her mother and father a living no way for her to work only sell the morals of her body right but i can imagine all the time she knew that was wrong there was something in her said now that's not right to do that she knew it wasn't so see every person has a conscience right everyone the bible said you have a a conscience uh conscious memory reason affection imagination everybody has these and god reveals himself in the conscience so rahab knew it's not right uh but i've got to do it i feel like i've got to do it and look how god was merciful because she knew it was wrong she didn't want to live in it god eventually sent her messengers amen messengers of deliverance amen glory praise god because she wanted that she knew it wasn't right she didn't want to be a part of it uh but god brought her out of it brother ramsey said one day she heard god was a movement her heart began to tremble she found a messenger from a great move told her that was going to take place what'd she say now joshua had signs joshua the same signs moses had exactly rahab didn't ask to see joshua's signs look at this so now remember brother man's talking about his his signs and his ministry right that's the whole point of this sermon is to show that we've got to move beyond the signs and look at the commission right so he said she didn't ask me show me one of joshua's signs he said a type of the church she just heard a type of the true church that's been pulled out of prostitution what a good type that is that's awesome we were in denominations and they're prostitutes to god work to god's word right they're claiming to be married to christ but they're unfaithful to the word amen so that's the beautiful type of rahab that's you and i we many of us were thank god if you weren't but many of us were in prostitute churches right claiming to be christians but not really living the life and and uh i'll say like this flirting with the world right making love to the world idolatry right but brother adam says she just heard uh uh he said i'm a baptist today methodist presbyterian but she pulled away out of i'm sorry pulled away in prostitution so rahab was caught in this and then she heard the word and she believed god's word amen but man said all of a sudden the little preacher enters the city now look he calls preacher another place he calls it a tape player a tape boy right another place he calls it a pastor i have the quotes on that brother says sometimes these two spies are pastors right so we can't just say oh it's a tape church you know he was just and he laughs after that when he says that in the token message so we got to be very careful with our types we remember that last week right be very careful with how you type and said there's a god that lives that lived yesterday it's the same today his power's the same he does the same works he did when he was on earth his agents are on the road amen thank god he's still got preachers today that know that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever amen now she knew was a harlot type of the believer the real believer she didn't say no i hear joshua can do signs because he's the successor i like to see some of those signs now in other words for for me it'd be like this well i know brother brown was a prophet uh i need to see that discernment operate in my life then i'll believe that was that's not what rahab said right rahab just said i believe amen i believe god's going to do something here amen she would say i've got to see a sign to believe she just looked at the commission praise god he said if i could see those signs no he absolutely didn't have to show those signs because she believed it anyhow she wasn't a thomas she believed it now remember church don't get down on thomas because many of us are that way we we wouldn't believe unless we have a sign but probably i'm talking about real faith here amen right brother talking about real genuine faith that doesn't need a sign amen although many of us could be thomas right many of the brothers could be thomas the gideon was a thomas right he had to see it to believe it which we can understand that but rahab didn't believe it just like mary amen just like mary he just she just said be it unto me according to the word hallelujah she believed it now he said now moses when he had signs he went down and performed the signs but the sign isn't the thing that took them to the promised land it wasn't the signs so so moses is signing his hand that wasn't what took them to the promised land the holy spirit the pillar of fire took them to the promised land amen right the leadership of god the leaders the daily leadership of the holy spirit following him every day is what took them to the promised land amen that's right the signs was the vindication of the commission and raya believed it without seeing anything she said we're all trembling like brother jack told me from albion the first time i preached there i said you know we preached we had a wonderful service and he come up he said brother he said i want to tell you he said he said you're a better believer than i am and i said brother no way i said you were sat in brother man's meetings and he said well i've got scripture brother no i love brother jack i'm not saying i'm saying all good things about him but you know him i'm just kind of like talking like him as a joke he said well i've got scripture to prove it i said well brother we'll share it but brother i'm no better than you he said well he said jesus told thomas blessed oh he said he said you're more blessed than i am that's what he said and he said jesus said blessed are those who haven't seen yet have believed he said i saw brother branham's gift he said and i believe but you haven't seen it and you believe so you're more blessed than i am and i started laughing i said well you got me on that one buddy but i don't believe that really in other words i'm saying god has blessed him tremendously praise god and i want to always uh humble myself i never want to exalt myself i always want to humble myself by god's grace now do i believe i'm blessed absolutely praise god and i believe i believe that's true what jesus said but i've seen god heal cancer my mom was healed right i've seen god do great things and so i never want to exalt myself or anything like that but i appreciate what he's saying he's he's and that's kind of what brother i'm saying here rahab didn't need anything she just heard and she just believed amen we don't know what happened maybe she had a dream maybe she saw an angel like mary right mary did have a supernatural experience to go back on right so sometimes we we got to balance that out too well she did see an angel how many of us have seen a physical angel right or a spiritual angel i never have but she had that but she believed what the angel said but rahab somehow didn't need a sign she just believed praise god now here's what i got here's kind of what i ended with last week too she didn't have to see a sign that joshua could do this with his hand or the stick she believed she said i heard i believe now i'm asking for mercy amen that's what you and i got to come asking for we got to ask for mercy he said oh how he could put a lesson right here i'm asking for mercy for me and my house ah that's the way to approach god amen i know god's a great god i know judgments on this road but i'm asking mercy for me and for my house i want to be on god's side i don't want to be against him i want to be invited to his side amen he said look at that roman that night now he talks about the philippian jailer uh remember he's going to kill himself and paul said do yourself no harm what what can i do to be saved believe and thy in thy house shall be saved he said certainly thou shalt be say why if you've got enough faith to have yourself saved you can have enough faith for your family to be saved he said die in thy house amen he said look at rahab have mercy about me here i love this quote she in other words she said spare me spies i don't want to die with these unbelievers i don't want to die as an animal i want to die in the arms of jehovah i believe you're god because he's both god of heaven and earth he does visible things he makes things real i've never seen him do it but i but i believe it now and that's how it is today you know even if we haven't seen anything yes let's say we're new to faith or we've never seen a miracle we should still say i don't want to die in the tribulation period right i don't want to die with these sinners i don't want anything to do with sin i love the sinners but i hate their sin i don't want anything to do with them i want to serve god i want god's mercy upon my life amen i want to be delivered from the oncoming wrath of god the bible said we're appointed to be delivered from the wrath of god hallelujah and that's all she said just have mercy i don't want to be a part of this this society i know jericho is all evil and we all know judgment's coming i don't want to be a part of that have mercy may god have mercy on me what can you tell me that will that will convince me god has mercy and they said we give you our word and we give you a red cord token amen oh that's what we need today the token tells us it's a sign right it's a sign that we'll be saved amen that's what they asked for she said i want god's favor who doesn't want god's grace i want god's grace amen that's what she's saying i've got some brethren i've got they're old and crippled i want to have faith for them how do we know she had genuine faith by her works right as soon as you have faith the bible said you receive it as a gift of god in fact it's jesus's own faith so if you have a part of jesus faith it's going to do the works of jesus hallelujah and so what the bible says see this proves that when she said i know it was a different kind of no than all the other sinners all the other the bible said their hearts melted all the other people in the city were so scared oh we're all gonna die they're on high alert you know uh they're all gonna die but she knew in a different way she knew that the god could deliver her the god that was coming and gonna pour out his wrath she also knew that god is a god of mercy and she wanted favor from that god she knew that god was loving amen she knew her society was immoral right but she also had faith and the bible said she had faith she didn't perish with them that believed not because she was a believer amen aren't you glad you're a believer this morning you won't perish with the world you're a believer praise god amen amen that's that's the confidence we have in god right and how did she have her faith she showed her faith by her works she received the spies with peace in other words she didn't battle the preachers like they're doing today oh my she didn't degrade the preachers like they did like they're doing today she received peace right so receiving god's messenger is the same as receiving god right jesus says this you gotta define your life you gotta lose it he that receives you receives me and he that receives me receives him that sent me there's that chain of command amen right there's a chain of command the believer to the preacher to christ to god amen just like god christ man woman praise god right it starts the order goes up that chain of command with authority praise god amen i don't have any authority the holy spirit's the one that's got authority praise god that's why god honors our prayers here the pulpit represents the authority of god's word but god has a man a glacier in an office and if you respect this office then you'll get fed by the office amen if you respect the office then god will honor your faith because it works in a chain of command right you've got to receive the ones jesus said because they were hand picked by him and that means they were handpicked by god the father praise god right because christ is the image of the invisible god he's the human manifestation of the invisible almighty god we know there's a reward for receiving a prophet hallelujah but abraham said it just comes in handy he said a prophet i've always always wondered what's the prophet's reward he said just comes in handy sometimes i believe it's more than that too i believe it's we get the prophecy of the prophet and that gives us wisdom in this life right we look at all the world events and who was telling me that yesterday somebody was telling me that yesterday oh brother adam i was talking about that and he was talking about all these people that you know they're all so nervous he said but while they're nervous we can just rest in christ because we have the reward of a prophet we believe the prophecy we believe thus saith the lord amen right so we get many rewards from the prophet for receiving a prophet in the name of a prophet right like i always tell you about my friends i have these preacher friends that are in denomination and all of them all of them have heirs in their life or they they jump on certain bandwagons that if they knew the message they wouldn't have done that right but because they don't accept the prophet they don't get the prophet's reward for example is they go after all these false prophets that prophesied trump is going to win and and then they follow their teachings and they get in their lifestyle they start doing the things they do like my one friend he followed joyce meyer and she always picks a word for the year like you know prosperity or health or and then he starts doing that and and and then he's then they start worshiping the way they do uh and and then they and then they start and he still believes in this day my good friend he still believes that there's going to be a national american revival but if he would accept the word of god for our day he'd know there's just a bride's revival going on and then he could be a part of it praise god you see what i'm saying but you and i saw that and we accepted it and now we're a part of it amen amen and no one's going to take me out because i've been revived i've been made alive amen and if i leave this i leave life but i'm saying with this because i know this is life amen i know what it's like to be dead right brother we know it's like being dead in churches but we know what life is like as well this is life the life of christ amen oh hallelujah the life of christ that he still heals cancer just simple humble prayers over cloths the churches say the cloth has power the cloth has no power the cloth represents the one uh who who heals praise god it represents there's anointing on that man on brother branham and those prayer claws if you don't know come from jeffersonville but they put him on brother branham's pulpit when they prayed for him because i don't have confidence in the men that prayed for them but i've got confidence in that man that preach at that pulpit 60 years ago yeah amen and that's what our confidence is in the reward of the prophet amen hallelujah god entered brother god honored brother ham's prayers god will still honor those that believe his message amen that's right and the bible said if you give a drink of water in the name of a disciple then you shall certainly have a roar nobody can take that reward from you now who are jesus disciples today any learner is a disciple so if you give a cup of water in the name of brother bang i give this in the name of brother vang in other words to honor a believer if you do if you give a something to honor somebody else's faith then the bible said you'll have a reward the love offering thomas from the church you're giving an offering in the name of the disciple right and so there's going to be a reward for that because who you associate with is very important birds of a feather flock together how can two walk together except they be agreed amen and we agree on this that jesus christ is the risen son of god amen he's finished the mysteries of god through his prophet william and we are echoing those prophecies again and may the internet take them around the world amen until simon can go again and brother craig can go again until brother ben narada can go again right they can't go now but may god use the internet so we can finish going around the world we've got to keep doing that that's the commission for today take this revelation around the world revelation 10 11. do you know that she's mentioned another time in the new testament see then how that by works a man is justified and not by faith only likewise also was not rahab the harlot justified by works now we know it's justification by faith in other words her faith went to work she acted upon what she believed works in his saver work so showed she was saved and then god did save her body right so god saved her soul first and then she worked from that salvation of the soul and she worked and then god saved her body too oh glory was not she justified by works when she received the messengers and sent them out another way for as the body without the spirit is dead so faith without works is that also this is the same chapter if you see someone cold and you don't give them a coat or you don't tell room right or they're hungry and we don't give them food the bible said how can there be faith in our hearts and the church said amen so if we see a need our faith should move us to try to help out in some way like that last time but stephen you remember that last time those people said they had car trouble i knew they didn't have car trouble i knew that woman she looked down and she said oh look how dirty his pants were he's been working on this tire all day and i thought hurt his pants weren't even dirty and that's what they do to try to get you in those drug addicts they just want you to instantly give you the money just quick right away i've worked with them before but you know what i thought my heart there i'm gonna let them use me i'm gonna let them use me i want money a little bit of money their camera's there that's right that's right whenever the cam was here last time and i pray later uh and they text me later and i say well i don't feel led to give right now because i don't know about your sincerity they never text me back that was like a week later but i gave them a bible i gave them my book i gave them the church age book i gave them all these books they're like so they're they're accountable but the bible says we've got to let ourselves be you sometimes praise god jesus said pray for them who despitefully use you amen i knew that wasn't i knew they weren't having guard trouble you can see it on their faces right they probably just go from one church to another but see but even as a christian we want to help out somehow so that's why i felt the lord leave me to go get the bibles go get the books right go get go get those first at least maybe they'll repent right i don't know why i put that in there but that's important it just came to me faith works by love rahab loved god and protected his messengers amen now verse 10 and 11 the bible says these people all have the spirit of fear their hearts melted and so that that spirit of fear is unbelief to condemnation right everybody in the city had fear even rahab was afraid right until she got the token amen because the bible said some people will go to hell because of fear which is unbelief right because you have faith or unbelief either saved or lost well most of the people in that city had the spirit of fear they were filled with demonic power of fear they rejected faith they they were fearful right and that's a type of today most of the world today is full of fear right scared someone's going to think i'm a racist or scared of the coronavirus or scared of violence or scared of all these things we should be like esther if i perish i perish because i know where i'm going i'm going to heaven to be with jesus amen i mean what are you going to do live in fear your whole life forever or what do you do we need to be children of faith praise god confidence strong only be strong and very courageous amen like boston if i die it's a blessing for me but he said i'm proud to stay for you guys to help you out right that's what philippians said he said be lot better if i died i could go be with jesus when i'm absent from the body i'm present with the lord he said but for your sakes i'll probably stay and he did he did say a few more years right it's all it's easier to get out of here right it's easier it's harder to stay and keep fighting the good fight of faith right it's harder thing to do paul says that right but the bible said they're going to say give me peace give me safety right peace and safety the antichrist is going to be satan superman the pope he's going to give them everything they want they're fearful so they're saying give me peace give me safety and we're saying the same thing you can have peace and safety in the holy ghost amen but they're offering it through you know things of the world right finances and all these things we're offering it through the holy spirit amen the love the joy the peace the long suffering the patience the holy the godliness the fruits of the spirit we're offering peace and safety so kind amen amen hallelujah see people today are going to be so willing to take the mark of the beast because they have these their hearts are melted with the spirit of fear what if i get kicked off on facebook what if i get kicked off on twitter well good their loss right it's their loss i've left all those things willingly but i still got youtube because i want to let everybody know i'm leaving but even if i get shut off tomorrow that's their loss i'm a light we're lights amen we're lights in the lost let them cancel i thought my salvation is not in technology my salvation is not in money my salvation is in the blood of jesus amen that's where my salvation is i've got faith in that praise god but they're they've got spirits of fear and they just want my money and buying i just want to be able to have money and buy things i'll sell out anything for that oh what a bunch of compromisers and they'll crucify the holy spirit word of god so they can have what they want to buy and access to their money but we sing take this whole world give me jesus amen you can take this whole world just give me jesus that's right you can take whatever you want it's all going to come and go it's all going to burn anyway take whatever you want just give me jesus but i have said the true bride of christ amen is interested in spiritual transactions amen the world is interested in natural transactions but we're interested in transacting with the holy ghost amen in other words we pray he answers we pray he answers we pray we receive amen glory and then in verses 12 and 13 she said you boys i saved your life now look at her talk like that i saved your life give me a token you promised me i saved you no eye for not i was good to you you give me something good but man said the preachers he said yes we're going to take the land if you want to get saved get them in the house right if you believe it go get them in here for will not be responsible if they're in the streets but if you'll just get them in the house we'll be responsible where that little red cord was to hang down the window we'll be responsible if you put them in the house so god's army was going to honor and respect anything that was associated with the red torch with the red accord the red token praise god in other words heaven and the true church of god will always honor the baptism of the holy ghost oh that's right church amen god will always honor our church because we preach the real blame that the blood that saves the blood that cleanses you the blood that makes way so you can get born again amen hallelujah most churches don't have that they don't have the red torches but we got the red token amen and it's on public display it's hanging right out of our lives amen it's hanging just hanging publicly everybody can see something different about that house it's a it's a connected that red blood that blood of jesus type of thing amen that holy roller type of religion yeah that's me praise god i gotta hang it right there publicly so everybody can see it especially your sisters they really see it with users right your holy your holy hair your holy modesty and all that yeah they really see that red token hanging there you just keep letting hanging sisters just keep let it hang and it's my sign that jesus has has come in this house praise god oh it's your side that god's mercy god's favor is with you amen god's favor has extended to you and he's given you the token of his deliverance let it hang there bill brandon said to the sisters wear it like a crown of thorns my wife did uh one of my daughter's hair and that crown braid is that what it's called yeah havens it reminded me of the crown of thorns jesus war but i said just wear it like a crown of thorns all right it's your crucifixion right it's your depth of self but through that there'll be many great victories amen hallelujah brethren if there ever was a time we ought to get our loved ones in the house it's today the household of faith get them in for there's a time coming when there's a shaken only our fathers brothers and other sisters are only safe in the house because god's power and it is and only the household of faith will be saved amen that's true because in that parable jesus gave of the wedding supper of the the king for his son he came down one last time remember that he came down one more time to make sure everybody had the garments on he found one that didn't have it all right he found that judas he said how did you get in here he said um he had nothing to say he had no testimony he had no overcoming testimony everybody else could say well i came in the provided way glory i came in the kings provided way i got washed they washed my feet i changed my garments now i've got the king's garments on i'm dressed in white i come in god for by the way thank god we've got god's provided way today amen but when he asked that judas he had nothing to say yeah no testimony but we overcome by the word of our testimony oh some of you ought to have a word of a testimony today amen of what god's done for you he's giving you new right robes praise god amen he's giving you his righteousness i used to be dirty i dirty clothes dirty life but he's giving me his righteousness of robes that's my testimony the king gave me new robes he's got to come down one last time to make sure there are no mortgages amongst us may god hasten the day for that can i get amen that there's no more judaism amongst us praise god that's only god's children left amen only god's children are sitting right here our robe just waiting for that wedding to start praise god amen hallelujah god hasten the day for that we know he's really narrowing it down don't we yeah we've seen over the last 15 years of this church he's really narrowing it down he's really finding those who have the white garments and those who don't oh thank god for his mercy that we can have him the preacher said i'm not responsible unless you get them in the house and she made them swear they would not destroy her family he said if you'll get them in they'll be safe she let them down out of the place and a way they went so look she had something to do she had some work to do how many got some work to do today i've still got to get some people in the house praise god i'm writing them letters i'm calling them i'm texting them i'm praying for them i'm doing everything i can to try to get them in the house making videos i'm sending texts and scriptures i'm dreaming about it you know you're dreaming about it you know we're all these things just trying to get them in the house and may god give you the grace to eventually get them in the house that would be god's grace god's favor remember church some houses saw everyone save like the philippian jailers others did not jesus said many of you your greatest enemies are going to be in your house he didn't promise to save every person in your family he just said if you can get them in that's a big if but i've got a big god behind that big if praise god right i've got a great god that can take that if and if i believe it and if i can apply it if i can pray and if i can believe perhaps god will bring everybody in amen but it's all an if because remember he can't force him to come in right yeah so what do we got to do like rahab seek god for his will the best thing you can do jesus said i sanctify myself for their sakes if we want to see our family members say the way to do it is clean out our lives amen clean out our houses amen amen and then you invite your family in love and sincerity jesus said all the father has given me shall come to me that's why i said i went in i think i turned off the live stream and i named a certain person in my family and i said i've written letters to them i've text them i've called them we've talked about it i've begged them i've cried with them i pray with them i've done all i know how to do and if they eventually don't accept the message i can have peace in my heart because i know i tried i tried to get them to come in the house amen i begged them to come in the house i wrote them a letter will you please get in the house amen i said her a church age book too and my book i've done all i know how to do to get that soul in the house and so i can have peace and i know god will never let me down god will never fail me praise god god will never disappoint me if i'm disappointed it's my fault not god's fault amen and god will save all those who want to be saved amen amen all those who want to be in that house can be there amen there's plenty of room amen there's plenty of room and we just do our part i told you that before i'll talk to you again a couple years ago when we had victoria was born i took a personal day because i could have three personal days from work throughout the year i want any personal business so i took one of those business days and i came here to the church and i filled out a manila envelope uh eight by twelve no it would have been nine by eleven nine by twelve right those manila brown envelopes and i put a letter from my family in there just saying we all got a new baby victoria and then i put a church age book in there and some seal or some message books in there and i sent it to everybody in my family i only heard back from two people one one my aunt said oh it's beautiful uh beautiful tracks i said well praise the lord you know and then my cousin i said are you gonna read it he said yeah i'm gonna read it but he was being sarcastic i never heard back from anybody else but i know in my heart i invited them to come in i gave them the church age book if they're going to get invited in they're going to get invited into that church book right right that one day out of all my day oh my three days i took that day and i invited my family on my mom's side to come into the to the house well keep believing though we'll keep asking we'll keep praying but church i know before god i've tried to get them to come in the house am i done trying absolutely not i'm going to keep trying where the lord will leave me but he said if you can get them in the house they won't be destroyed with the rest so may god help me i'll say this i can do all things through christ if he just strengthens me amen so if god gives me strength i'll keep asking people to come in the house amen and if you want to do that i'll provide the books for you i'll provide the postage for you you just gotta take a day off from work or day off or whatever you want and you gotta get the addresses right but if you wanna do that i'll pay for all the materials if you wanna send out to your house because we've got to invite them in right who's going to invite them to come well the holy spirit is but holy spirit through you right the spirit and the bride how many in the bride how many bride members we got today amen i'm not the false church i'm not a foolish merchant church i'm a bride church amen i believe all the word praises i'm not perfect but i believe all of it praise god i try to preach all of it i'm a bride member church i'm a part of that bride well then i've got to say come if you're thirsty come the thing is most people aren't thirsty because they're getting quenched by the things of the world but if they could only listen to that holy thirst oh they'd be like you and i they come here and they couldn't get enough of it amen because it's the thing that satisfies the thirsty soul amen this word this holy spirit word is satisfies the thirsty soul sat in churches on my whole life but when i heard this message it satisfied something i never heard before amen it satisfied that deep thirst and i'm never long to go anywhere else after 21 years of going to dead churches and uh foolish virgin churches one time i hear the bride message and i can't stay away amen because i know this word is right i know the men are liars but every word of god is yea and amen this message makes the word of god live amen it makes it alive amen we're grateful for that it's just god's grace right it's god's favor to raheb she wasn't nothing she was just a prostitute she was just a prostitute church member but god's grace extended to her oh because she said i don't want to die with this world i want to die in the arms of jehovah i'm going to give my life as a sacrifice to god almighty amen i don't want to give my youth i'm thank god i gave my life to lord at a young age i don't want to give my youth and my strength to the world i want to give it to god hallelujah so before i get old and all arthritis i don't want to speak it but let's say i will get arthritis you know i don't want to speak it but if i get old i'm cranked over and i got to walk with a cane like brother said one i still live everything in there and i'll be able to hand this bible off to the next holy ghost-filled preacher that will preach it uh uh uncompromising and he'll try to get everybody in houses with red corps amen hallelujah thank you jesus no happy to give our lives bring a sweet smelling savor unto god no it's our privileged church it's our privilege to serve jesus but abraham said it was god's love for rahab god's love in other words god went looking right just like he went looking like jesus looking for that woman at the well right i've got a need to go by samaria see jesus had a need to send joshua by jericho it was for rahab and her family hey man yeah that was the needy he had i love that woman i know she don't want to do that i know she'll believe me i know she's going to make a good mother someday would make a good mother someday if she was just given the chance oh god just give us the chance amen just give us the chance to do what's right and we'll do it praise god she didn't have a chance right she was trapped in this i got to make money somehow the only way we can do in this massive city is to sell myself she was trapped into it just like you were trapped in the sin oh my but once god showed you the way out the holy spirit came and it brought you new life it quickened you right so now you you can't enjoy the old life now you've got a new life amen with new desires new tastes what about a new appetite you can't eat the old rotting crop or the old rotting carry-on you got to have something fresh something i need something fresh from god amen it was god's love oh but there's one woman in there which woman is it is it the is it the the queen of jericho oh it's got to be the queen maybe it's one of the princesses one of the daughters of the king no it was a slow down low immoral supposedly apparently she wasn't that immoral this low down woman and god said she's a believer and i'm willing to save her before i destroy it all i'll have mercy on church you better believe before god destroys this world the tribulation he's going to have mercy on all those who want mercy amen hallelujah if he saved that one he'll save anyone who believes amen he got all he could get out of sodom before he destroyed it the eight people that wanted to get out i'm sorry that was eight that was noah's day sorry uh three three out of side i'm sorry and one of them they got four but one of them turned back at the last moment and jesus said remember that woman don't look back amen don't look back don't look back to the things of the world don't look back if the phone's got something bad on it right don't look back to all those were great days no they weren't uh this is the day living today's the day of salvation and today's mercies are new today amen don't look back to sinful things look to christ now brother said that's the greatest message you can ever give to anybody he said he said the greatest message was given on easter and the message was go tell my disciples that he's alive he's not dead he's alive amen the greatest message we ever today is that god is alive he's living in his word and the spirit is speaking through her i feel like he's speaking to us this morning don't you yeah praise the lord his love for rahab that prostitute church member oh i just see myself all over this praise god prostitute church member this great isn't that strange it almost seems like an oxymoron the great heart but he's not talking about awful he's talking about the faithful harlot in other words the great testimony of this woman became a believer i took her history she was considered and brought into the faith because of her belief in god she was brought into israel israelite faith across the light she courted a general in the army of the israelite army watch what god did for that woman watch what god did for this prostitute who just said i don't want to be a part of sodom and gomorrah i don't want to be a part of this filthy uh stinking dirty world i just want to do what's right i want to be on god's side lord said watch what god will do for one believer amen let's say like this look what god's done for you has god done anything for you oh yeah he's done great things for me amen praise god i thought i'd get a little more amen than that look what god's done for you has he shown you how much he loves you bro amen he's healed our sick where's brother we're sister who there she is healed our sick healed the sick ones praise god provided everything we have need of we can come to church and we have to wear a mask you know i watch preachers on church even the message they still wear masks that's fine if they don't do that that's fine but church we got enough understanding where that mask we're gonna do nothing is that right that mask ain't gonna do nothing unless you've got like a hundred layered mask or something like that but then you can't breathe so sorry about that then you'll die anyway so you won't have to worry about chronovirus but i mean there's understand i'm not criticizing them but what i'm saying is that some people are so caught up in that we've only had one person ever wear a mask in our church this whole time and look nobody's got sick right i'm not saying it won't happen perhaps it will i'm just saying look look at the blessing look how god has been merciful to us amen amen look at his blessings look at his his grace to us amen i just i i always want to be this way i want to choose to see god's grace and his blessings in my life amen instead of pointing out what i don't have or what i don't i want to i just want to emphasize look how good god has been to us amen he's been so good so faithful watch what god did for that woman they moved up into bethlehem that his son oh so this prostitute who used to go in with the men okay yeah you can come in one day she got saved went out got sprinkled with the water separation let's just say like this a year later she only went in with one man her husband and she came out with a son which was the greatest blessing now that's a different society then right but was the greatest blessing for the israelite race she used to come in and out just got money for going in and out with these men but one time she got married she went in she come out holding a sun he's going to carry on god's army amen oh this is this wasn't a normal son this was a special son praise god boaz rahab brought forth boaz and the church said why did god honor her because she just believed she heard the word she believed it oh my there's a rapture coming and a bride is going to escape the tribulation i believe it amen and i just want to be have mercy on me lord i just want to escape the tribulation i believe it amen i want to be in that number praise god i feel like rahab this morning on the good side the good side of her life amen watch what god will do when someone believes with that kind of simplicity so she married sam or solomon she just comes into the church you know she feels so she probably was humble but she ought to she's probably happy too she just saw all those the america of all that fault and she profess and praise jehovah by offering up every sacrifice she could you know maybe she had any money left over i don't know you know she was awful she would use everything everything she could do and all of a sudden a man said oh sister rahab i just feel led of jehovah to ask your hand in marriage would would you be interested in courting and marrying me and her whole life that's all she she just wanted one man hey man she didn't want a bunch of men in and out she didn't want all that she her whole life she just wanted to have a husband and have a child and the god who saved her body and the god who saved her soul is the god who saved her desires her dreams for the future oh god's gonna take care of your future church amen if you've got a desire it's a holy desire the bible said god will give you the desires of your heart amen can you imagine how she felt an officer brother said was officer not just i mean not like me a common man you know or like us brothers like a real officer of the army i'd like to ask your hand in marriage rahab would you guard me please uh me me a harlot me yeah i imagine yeah that's okay and she starts going making ready for the wedding they have the hoopa you know the like the face of tabernacles and they sitting there and a year later we'll say she brings forth the sun boaz lord of the harvest my look at this hallelujah the lord of the harvest that's his nickname now that's not what his name means but that's his nickname because he was over the harvest and because of his great harvest he had room for ruth oh my watch church watch what god will do for somebody who's got faith just watch it amen watch what god will do for someone who has faith in his word oh thank god i'm one of them amen they i just feel happy today thank god i'm one of them amen just watch what god will do for you and do for us if we believe amen and then boaz we got obed oh bad begat jesse i like that name that's a good name i just just kidding and jesse begat a david a man after god's own heart so salmon married rahab gentile harlot oh if the if the waters of separation can wash a harlot oh my goodness if the waters of a red heifer if ashes and water from a dead red heifer can cleanse a prostitute and bring forth a child that will eventually be in the lineage of jesus christ what will the blood do today what will the blood of jesus what will the blood of jesus do today that's why we that's why we bless our children right sorry in the name of jesus we bless them in the name of jesus let the blessing of jesus christ be upon them let the blood of jesus christ bless their lives guide their lives lead their lives anoint their lives fill their lives amen what is god going to do for somebody that believes hallelujah he'll do much more than exceedingly abundantly above all that we could ask or think the hard part is waiting but let's just stay in the presence of god so we'll forget about how hard it is let's just sit on that good singing brother amen that's why i like coming to church lydia malkin let's just get good singing that'll drive away all those doubts and the church said that music is meant there to drive away all the doubts all the fears and help you remember god is going to do something great for you because you believe amen you didn't see brother branham but you believe it amen hallelujah nobody's got to do a special miracle for you to believe you believe in it no matter what i have to have an angel come and tell me i'm going to rapture i believe it praise god i might be hope but one of these days will be faith i'm not going to have to die praise god right we have to see that we just believe and now we gotta work like it amen hallelujah god help us amen now we just gotta work like it by his grace because faith will produce genuine faith produces the works of god so after this prostitute brought forth bow ass let me ask those women to cry out right they would rachel would cry out you know joseph and benj she cried bononi but jacob changed it to benjamin right son of the blessing boaz grew up and he married a moabite now i know a lot of people say i see it's just in the family right yeah boaz he just marries a gentile heart just like you're a gentile widow just like you know his dad married her but little did they know god was god was weaving together a story of grace amen that god was gonna bring jew and gentile together into one family amen which paul preaches in genesis or ephesians chapter two and three it was the mystery of two separate people becoming one through the messiah and god foretells it so let's never look down on what god is doing touch not mine anointed these anointed saints do my servants no harm amen and then boaz and ruth brought forth obed obed brought forth jesse jesse brought forth david out of david and bathsheba adultery that was forgiven god brought forth nathan 36 generations later jesus was born david's great-great-grandmother was rahab look what god will do for someone who believes the word god rescued her out of the destruction the worldwide the city-wide destruction the national destruction god rescued her out of there gave her a godly husband and blessed her seed and her children so much so that out of them would come forth the promised messiah could you have a better family lineage than that church so roo god honors ray have faith and brings that brings her into the we'd say the most prestigious family in the message the family of the messiah amen yeah i'll show you what god will do for someone that loves him someone that believes him he'll bring them right into his own family i am a friend of god he calls me friend oh hallelujah david could say they could say david where'd you get your faith well it's from the lord but my great-grandma was rahab don't you know that how could you go face goliath well it was kind of built into me you know my my great grandma faced the whole destruction and she overcame she overcome by the the red cord i overcome by a sling right but it wasn't the sling it was god behind the sling it wasn't the cord it was god behind the cord amen it's the fate behind the product amen it's the faith behind our works amen it just kind of built into me that's why i could defeat goliath it was just kind of like a family thing you know aren't you glad you got that family thing going for you why are you such a christian why do you act like this i'm just part of the family and i just kind of runs in the family praise god my great grandma was rahab my grandma was ruth she left everything to follow jehovah david how do you do it how do you follow god so closely well my great grandma found her so closely my grandma found her so closely it's just kind of runs in the family people might wonder about that but that's actually scriptural paul looked at timothy and said he said i've got one son in the gospel timothy but timothy in you i see the faith that was in your mother and your grandmother think about sister sarah's was it your grandpa singing those songs is that who it was yeah look at that look how the faith gets passed down my grandpa prayed and raised my grandma from the dead my dad prayed and cast out the cancer out of my mom what what could be in me church hallelujah brother man you put that prayer cloth on there and god brought your dad almost back from the dead what could be in james and lily so see we better take care of these children hallelujah amen look at johnny's face sister look at look at the faith in that man all those testimonies now that faith that's in you is going to come down into children but you've got the bible said train them in the holy scripture train them up when they're old they won't depart from the faith right david where'd you get that faith um notice he didn't say great he didn't say grandpa he said great grandma huh a woman yeah god can use women oh yeah god can use women too yeah oh yeah yeah they're weaker vessels in some way but some way they got strengths that our brothers need right i need my wife to complete me i'm only half complete adam was only half of himself his other half was eve oh hallelujah i'm already over an hour aren't i yeah that's good i didn't preach very long last week so i got to preach a little bit longer today timothy where did you get such faith you follow the prophet paul so well my mom my mom taught me the word timothy you preached and you cast out devil and you prayed for the sick they recovered how did you do that well my grandma did my grandma prayed for me you know david could say the same thing how did you beat goliath well my great-grandma beat the whole nation of jericho praise the lord my grandma she took down the whole nation the great grandma took down the whole nation by faith amen by applying the token oh that's the token be applied to our lives amen apply it to your family apply to your children your home your car apply to this church let the blood be applied to everything amen she just applied the token she was trusted in the holy spirit she just believed god's promise that's all she did and that same faith is in you oh hallelujah you know my aunt wrote a whole book about my grandpa's faith now they changed the names of it i need to read it but my grandpa had just tremendous faith tremendous faith the one time raising the dead one time he ran over his daughter she slipped out of the car he was in a hurry ran over her she was dead my aunt the option is their name she don't want me to stare at him they prayed for in the car driving the doctor by the time they got to the doctor the doctor was like nothing's wrong with her she's totally well she still had the mark of the car tire across her coat and dress that's a true story true story so church why do we why did joshua build up those 12 stones to remember amen to remember what god has done to let us know he's still the same if he did that for them in the 1950s he can do it for us in the 2020s amen because he's never changed the world changes but god never changes amen he's the same today now we don't want to see anybody get run over we don't see anyone get cancer but when these things happen may god raise up faith in our midst that the faith that was in our fathers and our grandmothers and our mothers will be used in us as well because some of this somehow this is passed down god's election amen god's election i just want to close with this now let me set my timer for closing here give me 10 minutes to close all right i don't want to worry about but i'm having a good time today pretty good today every place is yours if you'll fight for it now i'm preaching to myself because i i know i need to fight better right i have days where i'm discouraged don't feel real spiritual but that's what this is for praise god that's what this is for it's the romance is a hospital you come to church to get healed come to church to get encouraged amen corrected right helped out healed the bible said every place every not some every place where you step your foot any place you feel led to go the bible said i've given it to you not some every now i'm going to balance this out i'm not preaching prosperity gospel although i do believe in spiritual prosperity and the bible says if you believe the prophets you'll prosper so there's i guess there's a message or there's a real prosperity gospel that's that's a true gospel not the way they're teaching it everybody's a millionaire if you don't have a private jet you're not you know you don't have faith that's a bunch of nonsense that's from hell but i'm talking about every place because the bible says we are blessed with not some church we're blessed with all amen spiritual blessings in christ jesus let that sink in for a little bit god wants to give you a blessing in every area of your life remember don't forget god still has martyrs in all this right stephen was a martyr yeah he had all spiritual blessings so that we can never forget that but all spiritual blessings are offered to us wherever you place your foot wherever you say this is mine this is mine this is mine we should get our bibles out right and go this is mine this is mine amen this is mine and i can't keep my balance this is mine every place where we place our foot every blood you want to see in our lives we can say this is mine if it be god's will if the bible said we're given all spiritual blessings see up in the heavenlies in spiritual places in heavenly places in christ jesus peter said god has given us all things that god has to say i'm not going to answer that because that's not going to make you godly glory but everything that will make us walk in god's life and will make us more godly i've given you all them but they're all given by promise in other words if you want it i promise it to you you're not going to get it right away but you're going to get it eventually it's a promise i promise i'll do this i promise i'll give you every good thing that will make you more godly how many how many people appreciate that promise i'm giving you every promise that you need for your life to make you more godly sometimes it's hard promises right sometimes it's hard road to get to that promise but god said i'm doing all of it to make you more godly look at brother brown what was his last major battle the complex right he had to get to a spot where he wasn't upset with the people rejecting him anymore so god had to send an angel to correct him he said if you do go up in the mountains your wife will leave you so he finally reached i said this he finally reached the promise of contentment despite being rejected he was a people pleaser he even said it you don't like to you like to please the people i read it to you out of it as it was with moses that's why he let them pull the gifts and do all the gifts rather than praying for all the thousands i'm that way some of it many of us are that way right we just want people to be happy sometimes we make mistakes but by the end he learned contentment and he would go to any church right and preach to any size crowd because he was content he wasn't going to run from the commission he was going to fulfill the commission something he had to learn it was a blessing it was a spiritual promise but it was a battle where he almost gave up a battle against the complex well if they won't hear my preaching then they don't have to hear me preach i'll just quit right but instead of giving up thank god god in his mercy sent the angel amen to correct him god will always send his children correction as many as i love i rebuke and jason thank you if you really want to be righteous church if you and i really want godliness god will bring it to us but it's going to come through a promise see we're partakers of the divine nature through the precious promises paul said he's freely given us all things that pertain unto life and godliness in other words god will not let something happen to you unless it's going to help you be more godly praise the lord amen now this is just telling us we are not lazy christians hallelujah but we follow them who through faith and patience inherited the promises praise god that should be our prayer today right because we all have promises we want i could list you about 20 promises give me five minutes i can probably list about 50 of them rapture mom save dad save you know full-time pastor i could listen to about 50 things probably within five minutes but the bible says between getting the promise now some of those i got to make sure those god's promised or not right is that god did god promise me that i might be hoping for that like we said earlier but is god promising me that that's the difference that's a great difference see we are not lazy but we are going to follow those who showed faith and patience and if you've got faith you're going to have what works like abraham abraham called those things not as though they were because he had a revelation of god's will for his life don't throw away your confidence don't give up on god how many can say amen to that amen that's all say i'm not giving up on god ready i'm not giving up on god let's say it again ready i'm not giving up on god i've got confidence in god's word he's given a promise i'm believing it i'm going to be patient until he brings it to pass but ye bride of christ fellowship have need of patience that after you've done the will of god with your works you might receive the promise brother ram says every promise is yours but god will never give it to you if you lay back on bed of ease that's why we got to keep fasting and praying right we got to keep coming to church and reading our bibles and fighting against any worldly laziness right you'll fight for every inch you get he told joshua every place to sow your foot treads i've given you footprints footprints mean victory it's the same tonight if you're paralyzed and can't wiggle fingers say god i want to wiggle finger that's right you promised me i could do it i'll lay there and wiggle it till i do wiggle it that's right god made the promise me i could put my foot on the floor here it comes here comes yes lord it's coming just keep your keep on till you put your foot on the floor fight for every inch things is handed to you that's what the matter with the american people tonight got everything handed to you well fed fattened clothed everything else you don't have no need of nothing but you don't realize you're miserable wretched and bright blind that's not us right that's not we're not miserable wretched and blind we're full of faith we've got eyes that can see right we've got ears that can hear we got that eye salve on praise god we've got garments of white amen we've got gold right we got gold jesus christ like character amen we've got it but we need reminders to not get lazy then poor heathens over yonder don't have a change of clothes coming in the meeting tens of thousands perfectly nude let them set the word see the works of the holy spirit god's word made manifest they'll believe with all their heart and accept it they will accept it in virgin soil they accept in their heart because they believe it i believe that's the end let's stand to our feet musicians if you can come church we can't imagine what god will do for someone that has faith in his word what is god going to do if he tarries what is god again gonna do in the next five years if he terry's ten years imagine what god will do in the next ten years those that love him praise god so what's our duty be patient be patient keep your confidence in god how many want to do that today let's bow our heads here as we think about rahab's faith how many thankful for the holy spirit preaching to us this morning amen i truly felt it was the holy spirit wasn't me it was the holy spirit lord i say that humbly i'm nothing i i'm a failure i'm a sinner saved by grace lord today
