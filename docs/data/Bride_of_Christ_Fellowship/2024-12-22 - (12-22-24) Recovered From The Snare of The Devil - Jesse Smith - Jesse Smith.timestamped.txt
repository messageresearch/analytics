[0:00] uh are pure many times and they want to
[0:02] just want to Worship the Lord hallelujah
[0:04] let's go to Second Timothy Chapter 2
[0:06] when brother Brian was preaching last
[0:07] Sunday had this this thought came to
[0:10] me it was the snares of the devil so
[0:13] while he was preaching remember I read
[0:15] that list of sins I read it on Wednesday
[0:16] too but it just struck me how he uh went
[0:20] so thoroughly through all
[0:22] those while he's preaching this title
[0:24] kind of came to my my mind I don't think
[0:26] I've ever preached directly on this but
[0:29] hope it to be a blessing to you today by
[0:30] God's grace 2 Timothy 2:24 24 down to 26
[0:34] I'm getting off my regular U series here
[0:38] by God's
[0:41] grace 2 Timothy
[0:46] 2:24 sorry about
[0:53] that so my title is recovered from the
[0:55] snare of the devil that's my title for
[0:58] today by God's grace because that's what
[1:00] Paul says here this is a pastoral book
[1:03] of course you know first and second
[1:04] Timothy are to the Paul's letter to the
[1:06] young Pastor Timothy by God's grace so
[1:08] we see of course the uh we see the uh
[1:11] qualifications for a minister in here we
[1:13] see deacons and so forth and all the
[1:15] teaching for a a pastor by the grace of
[1:17] the Lord a lot of good doctrinal
[1:19] subjects in here plus a prophecy of the
[1:21] end times where people would be lovers
[1:23] of themselves more than lovers of God
[1:25] how many one love God with all you have
[1:27] today Hallelujah we don't want to get
[1:28] trapped in the loving our elves
[1:30] Temptation here 2 Timothy
[1:32] 2:24 we'll read 2425 and 26 by God's
[1:38] grace why don't I read 24 and 25 then we
[1:42] can all read 26
[1:45] together the Bible says and the servant
[1:47] of the Lord must not be I'm sorry must
[1:49] not strive but be gentle unto all men
[1:53] apt to teach patient in meekness
[1:56] instructing those that oppose themselves
[1:59] if God per Adventure will give them
[2:01] repentance to the acknowledging of the
[2:03] truth now let's read 26 together ready 1
[2:05] 2 3 and that they may recover themselves
[2:09] out of the snare of the devil who are
[2:12] taken captive by him at his will let's
[2:15] have one more word of prayer if you have
[2:16] a need on your heart make it known unto
[2:17] God God sees all the unspoken needs and
[2:20] all the spoken ones of course that we
[2:21] prayed for Father God you see the hands
[2:23] of the people lord lord your Prophet
[2:25] taught us Lord it defies gravity to
[2:27] raise our hand Lord it it just goes
[2:29] against the Devil's uh plans to try to
[2:31] discourage us when we raise our hands
[2:33] we're lifting our hands to you God so
[2:34] hear our humble prayers today Lord
[2:36] minister to every need Lord we're
[2:38] reaching out to you Lord God we're
[2:39] Defying Gravity uh defying Lord uh just
[2:42] The Temptations of Life Lord we're
[2:44] reaching out to you lord your Prophet
[2:45] said one of the signs you're on fire is
[2:47] reaching out in the spirit so Lord we're
[2:49] reaching out to you today move by your
[2:51] spirit today Lord bless your people
[2:53] Hallelujah Lord and as these words came
[2:55] to my heart on last Sunday father I just
[2:57] pray they' be a blessing to your people
[2:59] in Jesus Christ Christ's name and the
[3:00] Saints said amen God bless you as you're
[3:02] being seated praise
[3:06] God
[3:08] hallelujah so I do have some slides here
[3:10] I think uh by God's
[3:13] grace so looking at second Timothy 2 24
[3:17] uh down through 26 by the grace of
[3:23] God now uh I want to do a few Greek
[3:26] words here so we can kind of get a good
[3:27] uh understanding here the servant Lord
[3:29] and chapter 24 would be the the the
[3:31] minister of the Gospel the preacher so
[3:34] the preacher must not strive must not
[3:36] fight uh be a fighter must be gentle
[3:40] unto all men apt to teach so this is an
[3:43] interesting thought too you know a lot
[3:44] of times pastors will have both
[3:45] preaching gifts and teaching gifts
[3:48] because the pastor is with the flock
[3:49] most of the time and he's got to be able
[3:50] to instruct them here's how you do this
[3:52] according to the Bible here's how you do
[3:54] this and so uh many times you'll see a
[3:56] pastor they'll call them pastors and
[3:58] teachers well that's because uh they
[4:00] have to be able to teach the People by
[4:01] God's grace and patient notice patient
[4:04] in these types of situations verse 25 in
[4:07] meekness instructing those that oppose
[4:10] themselves if God per Adventure will
[4:13] give them repentance to the
[4:14] acknowledging of the truth that they may
[4:17] recover which means recover oneself now
[4:20] we'll be going to the prodal eventually
[4:22] but remember he lost he lost the
[4:24] understanding of who he was and he had
[4:26] to recover who am
[4:28] I the devil had trapped him in such a
[4:31] way that he didn't know who he was
[4:33] anymore and so God uh God was able to
[4:36] help the prodigal remember who he was
[4:39] Hallelujah out of the snare of the devil
[4:42] who are taken captive or caught or
[4:45] captured by him at his will so we see
[4:49] some uh some things here some uh points
[4:51] in the scripture pardon me in verse 25
[4:54] you know trapped Christians and and I
[4:56] think we can all say uh that we've been
[4:58] trapped at some point at Le in a complex
[5:00] brother Ram said raise your hands in
[5:02] your church or in our church if you've
[5:04] ever battled a complex he said look oh
[5:05] my look at the hands he said he said
[5:07] nearly everybody battles a complex so we
[5:10] would uh as as real Believers we would
[5:13] not be possessed with demons but we
[5:14] could be uh battling demons and
[5:16] oppressed by demons right uh because the
[5:19] B Bible said neither give place to the
[5:21] devil where's the where's the place that
[5:22] he wants he wants the soul but if God's
[5:24] in there Satan can't get in there
[5:25] Hallelujah but where he can get in is
[5:28] the body and the mind
[5:30] and so we've got to do our best to keep
[5:31] Satan out of our our minds and of course
[5:33] our bodies taking care of our Temple
[5:36] Hallelujah but he notice Paul said tra
[5:38] Christians they oppose themselves so
[5:40] they're retaliating against their own
[5:42] selves so uh the flesh is retaliating
[5:45] against the soul the soul is telling
[5:46] them to do things but they're
[5:48] retaliating against that and they're
[5:50] walking according to the flesh a real
[5:52] Christian right because he's telling the
[5:54] pastor he's telling the pastors help
[5:56] them uh teach them be patient to them
[5:58] Hallelujah that's that's right so that's
[6:00] what I'm doing today by God's
[6:02] grace so help them because they they do
[6:05] not acknowledge the truth people that
[6:07] are uh trapped in complexes many time
[6:09] they're believing lies like remember
[6:12] brother Ram's complex uh was like oh uh
[6:15] his complex in the standing in the Gap
[6:17] was uh well if they're not going to
[6:18] listen to me I'm not going to go to them
[6:21] so his complex was the people would
[6:22] never receive me their lives would never
[6:24] change so why should I spend my time
[6:26] with them that was the complex right he
[6:29] was believe in a lie right but then he
[6:32] had this plan know think about this the
[6:34] enemy will get in our imaginations give
[6:35] us all these plans well if this doesn't
[6:37] go that way then I'll go brother said
[6:39] I'll move out in the wilderness I'll
[6:40] take my wife with me and the angel lord
[6:42] said your wife won't go with you she'll
[6:44] leave you right but they but the enemy
[6:47] will get our minds in a such a trap a
[6:50] complex where we'll have imaginations
[6:52] and how things might turn out but God is
[6:56] faithful to rescue his children
[6:58] hallelujah amen
[7:01] so even trapped Christians can they're
[7:03] fighting against their own selves and
[7:05] they're believing lies then in verse 26
[7:09] uh trapped Christians must recover
[7:10] themselves meaning they've got to repent
[7:13] and choose to overcome their own sin
[7:15] each one of us could easily point at
[7:17] everybody else but we got to ultimately
[7:18] point the finger at ourselves and say
[7:20] what have I done wrong Hallelujah
[7:23] because you can't you can't you all know
[7:24] people you pray for them for years they
[7:26] won't repent you can't help anybody
[7:28] repent the only person you can help
[7:29] repent is yourself Hallelujah I can only
[7:32] help me repent Hallelujah right so we
[7:35] see that we must look at
[7:37] ourselves and then they must recognize
[7:39] that they've obeyed the will of Satan
[7:42] rather than the will Lord many times as
[7:43] Christians that's the hardest thing for
[7:44] us to recognize but we've got to
[7:46] recognize that we've done the will of
[7:48] Satan rather than the will of
[7:50] God right in other words we've obeyed
[7:52] our flesh we've obeyed uh The
[7:54] Temptations lust of the eyes lust of the
[7:56] flesh pride of life we've obeyed the
[7:58] will of Satan we've done the will of
[8:00] Satan rather than the will of God
[8:02] remember brother R did the same thing
[8:04] remember in South Africa the angel told
[8:07] him you go to this here then come back
[8:08] here go take a hunting break but the uh
[8:11] the denominational Brethren pressured
[8:13] him no we got to go to these small
[8:14] churches and these all things and uh he
[8:17] actually did the wrong thing he he did
[8:19] the the will of man rather than the will
[8:21] of God and he paid for it he suffered
[8:23] for it but the Bible said every Son of
[8:26] God will be chasen Hallelujah the the
[8:28] fact God chased you rebukes you corrects
[8:30] you maybe allows you to be sick so you
[8:32] can humble yourself the reason he does
[8:34] that is because he loves his children
[8:36] hallelujah amen that's right God let
[8:39] brother Ram get amibas because God loved
[8:41] brother brandom and wanted to show him
[8:43] don't follow the will of Man follow the
[8:45] will of God oh my now the origin is as I
[8:49] said was with brother uh Brian's message
[8:51] there and it has a relationship you know
[8:53] to the recent sermons you know this uh
[8:55] Corinthian Series has been a real
[8:56] blessing to me uh I've never seen it in
[8:58] the light that I'm seeing it here by
[9:00] God's grace but this thought came to me
[9:01] while I was studying you know the same
[9:03] man who said love remember we went
[9:04] through those 16 attributes of love the
[9:07] same man that said love love love love
[9:09] charity charity charity the same man
[9:10] also said we must judge one another and
[9:12] ourselves in the
[9:14] church right same man same letter same
[9:18] gospel Hallelujah so what I mean is
[9:21] sometimes we misunderstand love we think
[9:23] love Is Just oh feel good and be kind
[9:24] and nice but it also means calling out
[9:27] sin in our lives in the lives of others
[9:30] like we said with Matthew 18 you go to
[9:32] that person individually then you take a
[9:34] group then you bring it before the local
[9:36] church right so it's the same man it's
[9:38] the same uh spirit of God that allows us
[9:41] here to to recognize that real love is
[9:44] corrective and yes real love is patient
[9:46] real love is kind Real Love is
[9:48] longsuffering All these things that love
[9:50] is those are all things that we
[9:52] appreciate I appreciate 16 attributes of
[9:54] Love Don't you that's a lot of love
[9:56] that's a lot of attributes of Love 16
[9:58] different channels that can slow down
[9:59] into longsuffering patient thinks no
[10:02] evil rejoices in the truth hallelujah
[10:05] amen all these beautiful channels that's
[10:07] when we know we're walking the love of
[10:08] God when we see the fruits of God's
[10:10] spirit manifest in our lives Hallelujah
[10:13] and God creates in us a clean heart
[10:16] Hallelujah now I don't know what that
[10:18] is now I just want to briefly you know
[10:21] uh this when I was looking at this
[10:22] sermon and studying this weekend I
[10:23] thought well this reminds me I preached
[10:24] on isolation a couple years back so I
[10:27] just want thought I'd remember bring
[10:28] some of these things things to our
[10:29] remembrance you know there's at least
[10:30] three types of
[10:32] isolation you know uh and the worst one
[10:34] is our the first one that's what we're
[10:35] talking about today with um Paul's
[10:38] writing in 2 Timothy 2 we sometimes
[10:41] isolate ourselves by allowing uh we it's
[10:44] our own sinful choosing that traps us
[10:47] and isolates us from God and from the
[10:50] Saints or family or whatever you know
[10:52] whoever isolate yourself from uh the one
[10:55] with Hezekiah was he was isolated from
[10:58] God so God withdrew a a part of his
[11:00] anointing a part of his uh blessing of
[11:03] Hezekiah so Hezekiah could see what
[11:05] would he choose if God's spirit wasn't
[11:07] so hard so so strong on
[11:09] him remember that prayer from brother
[11:11] brandham let me read it here U such a
[11:14] beautiful prayer I just wrote it
[11:18] down if I can find it I think I was
[11:20] looking at it yesterday oh yes he said
[11:22] this in 1963 he said some people say oh
[11:25] Satan can't make me do that uh he said
[11:28] yes you just let God lift his hand one
[11:31] time off you and Watch What Happens so
[11:34] Hezekiah no doubt he had so many
[11:36] testimonies like he would have thought
[11:37] well there's no way I'd ever allow you
[11:38] know Babylon to come in here and spy out
[11:40] the the things of God brother said you
[11:42] just let God take his hand off you one
[11:44] time see what you would do in other
[11:47] words let you'd see how carnal you could
[11:50] become if God's spirit isn't on you
[11:53] God's grace God's hedge isn't about you
[11:55] and brother R said I constantly plead
[11:58] God don't send
[12:00] him God keep Satan away God don't let me
[12:04] uh lead me not into trial don't lead me
[12:06] there but Deliver Me From Evil
[12:08] hallelujah amen it's a beautiful prayer
[12:11] like I said one of the just an
[12:13] outstanding quotation from God's Prophet
[12:15] but that's the one where where God will
[12:17] let us see uh what's in our
[12:20] heart right doesn't the Bible say the
[12:22] heart is Jeremiah said the heart is
[12:24] deceitful above all
[12:26] things right so that's why David said
[12:28] create in me a clean heart and renew a
[12:31] steadfast Spirit Within Me God's got to
[12:34] create that and we know now by the the
[12:36] understanding of the revelation of the
[12:37] message and the New Testament that new
[12:39] heart's got to be created every single
[12:40] day because we got to die every day
[12:44] Hallelujah your habit of obeying God's
[12:47] word won't last every day you got to
[12:49] renew it every day it's not automatic
[12:51] you're going to want to read your Bible
[12:53] and pray every day or confess your sins
[12:55] every day that's not automatic we need
[12:57] to go ask God God helped me created me a
[13:00] pure
[13:01] heart so I don't isolate myself from you
[13:05] but the last one is the best one we want
[13:07] to isol sometimes we shut in with God
[13:08] hallelujah we spend extra time with the
[13:11] Lord we give God a little extra time
[13:13] that's the best isolation we could have
[13:15] Hallelujah and yet throughout all these
[13:17] we're never forsaken God never leaves us
[13:20] nor forsakes
[13:22] us and then remember there's that
[13:24] there's uh you're in one of these places
[13:26] right now think about that some of you
[13:28] are approaching a test right now some of
[13:30] you are getting close to walking into a
[13:31] place where God's going to take the
[13:33] Hedge on I'm sorry hedge off he's going
[13:36] to let you he's going to let you
[13:37] fight right we're we're either coming to
[13:40] one or you're in the midst of it right
[13:43] now or you're in a spot where wow I got
[13:46] peace all around me I got Victory All
[13:48] Around Me praise God I've got peace like
[13:51] a river where's Lily when I need her
[13:52] Hallelujah no I know she's coming she'll
[13:54] probably be here Prett soon she does
[13:56] that so well I I want I want her to
[13:58] demonstrate that for everybody
[13:59] I got joy like a fountain all these
[14:01] things Hallelujah I love that childlike
[14:04] Faith they got Hallelujah so see you
[14:06] know you're at one of these places think
[14:08] about that where are you right now are
[14:10] you coming up like well I feel like you
[14:12] know maybe God's uh maybe this this
[14:14] protection's coming off I feel like I
[14:15] got to get my sword ready here I got my
[14:17] sword
[14:18] sharpened or are you swinging the sword
[14:21] right now to fight off Satan get off me
[14:24] Satan get behind me Satan in the name of
[14:26] Jesus
[14:27] hallelujah or do you feel like I just
[14:29] got peace I got Victory Hallelujah I'm
[14:31] walking in the in the blessing of God
[14:33] I'm walking in the fear of the Lord
[14:34] hallelujah I'm on top of the mountain
[14:37] the mountains have moved Hallelujah and
[14:39] I'm walking in Victory by the grace of
[14:41] God so we we see that we're we're in one
[14:44] of these places and and uh we want to of
[14:47] course overcome the devil now here's the
[14:50] one where we get this you know uh Jesus
[14:52] told Peter why could you not watch with
[14:54] me one hour he said watch and pray that
[14:56] you enter not into temptation so see
[14:58] there there is is there's times God
[15:00] wants us to pray so uh we won't go into
[15:03] a Temptation see there's times God is
[15:05] teaching us continue in prayer continue
[15:07] in prayer and if you stay in prayer I
[15:09] won't allow you to go through this very
[15:11] difficult
[15:12] thing but then there's other times you
[15:14] can pray all day and God's still going
[15:16] to let you be
[15:17] tested right had medit I mean a
[15:19] meditation all day because none of us
[15:21] pray all day right you got to go to work
[15:22] you got to make a living you got to
[15:24] Fellowship you got to go to church all
[15:26] these things but God there's times no
[15:29] matter how much you pray meditating how
[15:30] close how many sermons you listen to how
[15:32] many times you quote the word of God how
[15:33] many times you you say nice things about
[15:35] other people and and testified to a a
[15:38] sinner friend or whatever you do no
[15:40] matter what you do God's going to allow
[15:41] this hedge to be taken and let you go
[15:43] through a battle
[15:45] Hallelujah that's right and again the
[15:48] hour of the power of the Hour of Prayer
[15:52] church I don't know I know this I know
[15:53] there's power in half an hour prayer
[15:56] Hallelujah praying before service that's
[15:58] why I invited everybody again I keep
[15:59] inviting everybody there's power in that
[16:01] Hallelujah you have time to be in God's
[16:04] presence and it it's it's an opportunity
[16:06] to watch and pray and make sure your
[16:08] spirit is in unity with God Almighty
[16:12] Hallelujah there's power in that
[16:14] hallelujah amen remember uh because we
[16:17] all got we all have to go through trials
[16:19] or tests of faith and such a promise God
[16:23] will not allow us to go through a trial
[16:24] we can't overcome God will never never
[16:27] let us have a foe or an evil spirit that
[16:30] we can't
[16:31] overcome
[16:33] Hallelujah we have to remember this we
[16:36] have to remember this our trials are
[16:38] more precious than gold what is gold two
[16:41] over $200 a a troy ounce I think right
[16:43] now no $22,000 I'm sorry an troy ounce
[16:47] of gold is over
[16:48] $2,000 sometimes I watch on the stock
[16:51] market go Silver's really down right now
[16:52] so if you want to get some silver Now's
[16:54] the Time to get it get it while it's low
[16:57] silver is redemption in the Bible let's
[16:58] make sure we're Redeemed by God's grace
[17:00] Hallelujah switching from natural to
[17:03] spiritual but when you get tested or
[17:05] when God allows that hedge to go up that
[17:07] is a precious thing to God God's going
[17:09] to watch you fight God's going to help
[17:11] you fight God knows you can already win
[17:13] this fight
[17:14] hallelujah it's more precious than gold
[17:17] that perisheth though it be tried with
[17:20] fire my wife sh said she went back and
[17:22] listened to Aaron Riddle's sermon on uh
[17:24] the fiery Trials of our faith there so
[17:26] that was a great blessing to her
[17:27] remember the there seven steps in God
[17:29] refining your faith Hallelujah we got to
[17:31] be willing to go through all of them
[17:34] Hallelujah and what does this do this
[17:36] this ultimately leads to God's praise
[17:38] the trials will make you praise God more
[17:40] the trials will make you honor God more
[17:43] the trials will make you give God more
[17:44] Glory
[17:46] Hallelujah that's right now a lot of
[17:48] times Church though our trials are
[17:50] self-inflicted right in other words we
[17:52] isolate ourselves or we give in uh we
[17:55] willingly leave uh uh the plan of God
[17:58] and go after after the lust of the flesh
[17:59] lust of the eyes pride of life something
[18:01] along those
[18:02] lines but that's okay God's with us
[18:05] God's forming us God is maturing a
[18:07] people the fivefold ministry will bring
[18:10] them to Perfection that's that's what I
[18:12] was confessing at the altar this morning
[18:13] I was saying Lord you said the fivefold
[18:16] ministry will bring us to completion
[18:17] hallelujah amen thus say the Lord amen
[18:21] if we stay with the pure word of God and
[18:23] preach the pure word of God our lives
[18:25] will be brought to maturity will become
[18:27] more like Christ it's guaranteed amen
[18:30] hallelujah what a promise amen now
[18:34] that's the one we read
[18:36] again so again this is from my 2022
[18:39] notes sometimes you know it seems in
[18:41] this case you know a a Christian in
[18:43] Timothy's church here was taken captive
[18:46] uh and it looks like it's self-inflicted
[18:48] and like I said many times for us it's
[18:50] lust or Pride uh if we looked at brother
[18:53] Bram again that would be the pride of
[18:54] life with the critical spirit that's the
[18:56] pride of life criticizing the people
[18:58] every time I go back the women have
[19:00] shorter hair I'm glad when I come to
[19:02] church they got long hair amen seech we
[19:05] got some maturity by God's grace every
[19:07] come every time I come back there's less
[19:09] and less makeup to the point where
[19:10] there's no makeup amen hallelujah it's
[19:13] just the healthy glow of living a good
[19:15] healthy life amen we'll put some oils on
[19:18] there some before service whatever you
[19:20] do maybe
[19:22] nighttime but uh in this case it looks
[19:25] like this person uh because the Bible
[19:27] said Paul said he he's got to recover
[19:30] himself that means he himself went into
[19:33] the
[19:34] Trap right but it's it's the repentant
[19:37] will of God that gets you out of the
[19:40] Trap of this of the devil the snare of
[19:42] Satan it's a repentant heart we know
[19:45] that gets us out of the traps of the
[19:47] devil now remember friends I'm just
[19:49] going to re rehearse this just just to
[19:51] remind you um and I even heard a quote
[19:53] too uh
[19:55] um Martin Luther said he said he said I
[19:59] wish every Christian could have their
[20:00] eyes open to see the spiritual warfare
[20:03] that's constantly around them you know
[20:05] we walk outside and all we see is you
[20:07] know beautiful Skies now not necessarily
[20:08] yesterday that was a really cloudy day
[20:10] but you know like a day like today my
[20:12] it's beautiful it's gorgeous but Martin
[20:13] Luther said I wish that people could
[20:15] walk around and see the demon powers I
[20:17] forget how many times Martin Luther woke
[20:19] up and Satan was standing right at his
[20:21] bed the church age
[20:23] messenger and he would quote the word of
[20:25] God he said sometimes I just roll over
[20:27] and go back to sleep I du Satan go roll
[20:29] over and go back to sleep he said I wish
[20:32] every Christian could see the demon
[20:34] powers now that's scriptural right
[20:36] because Daniel met an angel I just read
[20:38] I just read the whole book of Daniel
[20:39] this week uh and he said to met the
[20:41] angel the angel said I've been trying to
[20:42] get you to get to you for 21 days for
[20:45] three weeks I've been trying to get down
[20:47] here what layers of demons are there
[20:51] church we got to stay in tune with the
[20:52] Holy Spirit praise God layers of
[20:56] principalities and spiritual wickedness
[20:58] it took him three weeks of fighting for
[21:01] the angel that and he had to get help
[21:03] from Gabriel amen Church it ought to
[21:05] make us rejoice if God answers our
[21:07] prayer how how gracious God was to give
[21:10] us Supernatural help from Angels
[21:12] Hallelujah to answer one of our prayers
[21:15] amen we got some serious Supernatural
[21:18] help Hallelujah Angels were dispatched
[21:21] Hallelujah that ought to show you how
[21:23] much God loves you because they're sent
[21:25] to the hirs those who will inherit
[21:27] salvation
[21:29] Hallelujah three weeks of fighting of
[21:31] wrestling with spiritual wickedness and
[21:34] then the only time the prayer can be
[21:35] answered is when Gabriel your prince now
[21:37] that's Israel's Prince not our Prince
[21:39] not the Gentiles Prince but Israel's
[21:42] Prince Gabriel comes along and starts he
[21:44] he gets in the B he said this is a a job
[21:46] for a real Archangel of God he said step
[21:49] aside this is a job for a real
[21:51] angel I'm not you could push me aside
[21:53] too buddy you know I'm just using I'm
[21:55] just using you as a prop I'm always
[21:56] going to use Row one as a prop here so
[21:58] thank you buddy
[21:59] he said he pushed aside he said he said
[22:01] let me wrestle this guy and then the
[22:02] angel could slip down and say Daniel in
[22:04] heaven you're greatly beloved amen and
[22:08] Heaven heard you the first day you
[22:10] prayed hallelujah
[22:12] amen hallelujah Heaven hears when you
[22:15] cry out to God when you call upon God
[22:17] Heaven hears you that same moment
[22:20] Hallelujah but then we got to keep
[22:22] praying we like the Bible said he's the
[22:24] high priest of your profession we got to
[22:27] keep professing the truth of God
[22:29] Hallelujah because what what happens if
[22:31] we stop our confession we lose our
[22:33] Victory brother Ram says and it's true
[22:35] you can see in the Bible your healing
[22:37] will last as long as you confess it
[22:40] unless God is testing you right we
[22:41] always got that unless because there's
[22:42] always certain
[22:43] situations we see and and the example
[22:46] was with with u with Peter walking on
[22:48] the water his victory his Supernatural
[22:50] walk lasted as long as he had his eyes
[22:53] on Jesus but as soon as he got his eyes
[22:55] off Christ he began to sink it's a
[22:57] lesson to us we must keep our eyes on
[23:00] Jesus Hallelujah we'll be able to walk
[23:03] upon the Seas of life without sinking
[23:05] That's what Satan wants he wants us to
[23:07] sink but by the grace of God will not
[23:09] sink we'll stand
[23:11] Hallelujah so think of the layers of
[23:15] demons right and now it's just become
[23:17] more I'm going get to this it just
[23:18] become a little more real with these to
[23:20] see how much the demon powers around
[23:25] us finally my brethren be strong in the
[23:28] Lord
[23:30] it's good to be strong at the gym right
[23:31] Mal we've been going we went to the gym
[23:33] together a couple times this week it's
[23:34] good to be strong in the Lord but it's
[23:36] better I'm sorry it's good to be strong
[23:37] in the body it's better to be strong in
[23:39] the
[23:39] Lord I know this for sure I spent more
[23:42] time in my Bible than I did at the gym
[23:44] this week that's what Malachi that's
[23:45] what we got to do we got to spend we got
[23:47] to give some time we got to get a little
[23:49] benefit uh on our body there's a there's
[23:51] a little benefit Godly exercise has a
[23:53] little
[23:56] benefit but God really wants us us to be
[23:59] strong in the Lord and in his power
[24:01] where's his power his power is in his
[24:04] word Jesus said my words I speak unto
[24:06] you their spirit and their life you want
[24:09] to feel life you want to feel like
[24:10] you're living start speaking the word of
[24:12] God hallelujah amen there's life in the
[24:15] word of God be strong in the Lord and
[24:18] the power of His might put on the whole
[24:20] armor of God we're going to review that
[24:21] in just a moment that you may be able to
[24:23] stand against the Ws cunning Arts so
[24:27] Satan is a cunning AR artist he's a
[24:29] deceitful artist he's a crafty artist
[24:32] right he paints a beautiful picture oh
[24:34] you could do this and it won't be that
[24:36] much sin he just paints this beautiful
[24:39] picture it's actually a trap of the
[24:41] devil right but he's an artist he paints
[24:43] something or gives you this idea or or
[24:46] this imagination or this reasoning like
[24:48] he did with Eve in the garden brother
[24:50] Ram said he just he he's so artistic to
[24:53] make everything uh make sin look so
[24:55] attractive and so beautiful it's but
[24:57] it's trickery
[24:59] and the only way we overcome is having
[25:02] on the armor of
[25:05] God because we wrestle not against flesh
[25:07] and blood but against principalities
[25:10] against Powers against the rulers of
[25:13] Darkness huah remember uh uh Gabriel
[25:16] battled the the the Prince of Persia so
[25:19] there was a demon over Persia how about
[25:21] the American
[25:23] demon right that's the one we got to
[25:25] battle with I've been battling with him
[25:27] for uh 25 years by God's grace amen
[25:31] still battling against him against
[25:34] spiritual wickedness in high places
[25:37] there's demon powers that are above us
[25:39] and around us trying to get us to fall
[25:42] setting traps for us and and painting
[25:44] these elaborate uh traps and tricks and
[25:46] we've got to get victory over that the
[25:49] only way we can do it is by the word of
[25:52] God we must wrestle against it Church be
[25:55] encouraged I was just encouraged this
[25:56] week I saw a meme uh
[25:59] online and it showed a man who was
[26:01] fighting against sin on the other side
[26:03] you know I think I think he was
[26:04] embarrassed maybe he was drunk I know
[26:07] looking at evil pictures or something he
[26:08] was just embarrassed of his sin and on
[26:10] the other side this side said fighting
[26:12] against sin and the other side it showed
[26:14] him partying with drunkenness and uh you
[26:16] know at a big party laughing enjoying it
[26:18] I just appreciated it in one in one case
[26:21] he's fighting against sin the other case
[26:23] he's Bound by sin he's a slave to sin so
[26:26] I just want to be encouraged I want to
[26:27] encourage you keep fighting the good
[26:29] fight of Faith Hallelujah you're not
[26:32] giving over to it you're not in the you
[26:33] don't have a hangover this morning you
[26:35] know whatever it may be uh you're not in
[26:37] in an adulterous bed this morning or a
[26:39] fornicator bread or something like that
[26:41] thank God you're fighting the good fight
[26:42] of Faith hallelujah
[26:46] amen but you must know spiritual
[26:49] wickedness is against
[26:52] you principalities of Satan are fighting
[26:56] against you but the great Shepherd is
[26:59] watching over
[27:00] you in other words there's wolves all
[27:02] around there's wolves all around us but
[27:05] the shepherd is not far from us
[27:07] hallelujah he said I be not far from
[27:09] each one of you Hallelujah acts
[27:13] 17 so if we're to overcome the
[27:15] principalities of Satan the powers of
[27:18] Satan the rulers of Darkness the rulers
[27:20] of America or Ohio and all their all all
[27:23] their their different levels uh brother
[27:26] man said there's degrees in heaven
[27:28] there's degrees of angels there's
[27:29] degrees of Believers Hallelujah if we're
[27:32] to overcome those degrees of devils then
[27:34] we're going to need to put put and take
[27:37] unto you the whole armor of God that you
[27:39] may able to withstand in the evil day
[27:42] and having done all to
[27:45] stand now remember what's what's the
[27:47] other scripture that's just coming to me
[27:49] now resist Satan and he will
[27:51] flee our duty is to fight until Satan
[27:54] says I've had
[27:56] enough now you're not the one who has
[27:58] enough it's God who's got enough
[28:01] Hallelujah Satan's going to get tired
[28:03] and move on he's going to give you a
[28:04] peace for a season when you start
[28:06] letting the Lord fight through you
[28:08] Hallelujah because greater is he that's
[28:10] in you than he that's in the world
[28:13] Hallelujah and then Satan say oh I can't
[28:15] handle no more of this this Holy Ghost
[28:17] filed sister this Holy Ghost filled
[28:19] brother I can't handle I I need to take
[28:21] a break I'm leaving them for a season
[28:22] and then we can Rejoice amen it's the
[28:25] season of Peace Hallelujah
[28:30] Hallelujah and let's let's do this let's
[28:33] do all we can do let's do all we can do
[28:37] to resist
[28:39] Satan have you turned off your phone to
[28:41] resist
[28:42] Satan have you have you driven away from
[28:45] a certain situation to resist Satan have
[28:47] you walked away from certain people and
[28:49] situations just to resist Satan have you
[28:51] done it the Bible said do all do
[28:55] everything in your power sometimes you
[28:57] got to physically flee like Joseph from
[28:59] Piper's wife sometimes Paul said flee in
[29:03] the New Testament flee from all these
[29:05] workers of unrighteousness we're going
[29:07] to get to a little bit The Snare of uh
[29:09] riches he said flee from those things
[29:12] just run away from those constant
[29:14] Temptations run from those things and
[29:16] run to follow those who are living a
[29:19] righteous life
[29:20] Hallelujah
[29:23] right so we want to keep the full armor
[29:25] of God on your being at all times
[29:28] now there's five I'm going to get back
[29:30] to that I got that one out of order
[29:32] remember there's five New Testament
[29:33] verses about
[29:35] snares and some of them uh I'm not going
[29:37] to do I think I'm only going to do three
[29:38] or two remember this was a good reminder
[29:41] Simon has preached on this numerous
[29:42] times it's helped me out the great snare
[29:45] of the end time is like the days of Noah
[29:48] where they were eating and drinking Mar
[29:50] and giving in marriage right so we see
[29:52] Jesus says this is a snare that comes on
[29:55] the whole
[29:56] world and I want to point point this out
[29:59] yeah surfeiting is like another word for
[30:00] drunkenness and drunkenness and cares of
[30:03] this life the cares of this life are
[30:05] anxieties so it's the anxiety it's the
[30:08] pressure to have enough food it's the
[30:10] pressure to have enough drink it's the
[30:13] pressure that you got to conform and be
[30:15] like the rest of the world we don't have
[30:17] to be like the rest of the world we need
[30:18] to be like the Christian Church
[30:20] Hallelujah we need to be like the book
[30:22] of Acts Church Hallelujah that's right
[30:25] and this is how people will miss the
[30:26] Rapture the rapture will come unawares
[30:29] and they won't know it because they're
[30:30] giving themselves over just to you know
[30:32] the feasting and the drinking and
[30:33] everything like that that's why you know
[30:35] it's so sad if people cancel their
[30:36] Wednesday night service you know for
[30:38] just because it's Christmas you got all
[30:41] day to do all you want but let's give
[30:44] God some worship on his this apparently
[30:46] it's supposed to be his day it's
[30:49] supposed to be his birth we know it's
[30:50] not right it but let's give God glory on
[30:54] his day praise God now some of you I
[30:57] don't know you but some of you at least
[30:59] get that day off ra if you get that day
[31:01] off does everybody get that day off
[31:01] everybody get that day off I know you
[31:03] guys are out of school okay so it's like
[31:05] it's almost everybody in America not
[31:07] everybody I mean there's some certain
[31:08] people in you know emergency situations
[31:10] or even gas stations they got to work on
[31:12] that day but if we got the day off let's
[31:14] give God a great portion of that
[31:16] Hallelujah like I look forward to I was
[31:18] I was talking to my assistant
[31:19] superintendent he's the second guy in
[31:20] charge of our district and uh he always
[31:22] says I like the joy you have on your
[31:24] face Mr Smith I said well it's all God
[31:26] you know but he said what are you doing
[31:28] what does your family do for Christmas I
[31:29] said well I give all my kids three gifts
[31:31] a toy clothes and a book I said between
[31:34] everyone we read a chapter in the Bible
[31:35] or a section of the Bible and then
[31:37] Malachi plays for us on the piano now
[31:39] one of these guy one of these days this
[31:40] guy's going to leave and we need another
[31:41] person to step up and play the
[31:43] piano I'm giving my family some
[31:45] encouragement
[31:46] here no pressure guys no pressure play
[31:49] like Mali one day he's gonna have his
[31:52] own family Lord
[31:53] willing but I uh I said you know we we
[31:56] we we sing we do a chapter open a gift
[31:58] everybody all 10 of us right 10 gifts
[32:01] boom or maybe eight gifts eight gifts we
[32:04] hold our gifts to the
[32:07] end so I think about that in that we get
[32:09] almost four chapters of the Bible extra
[32:11] chapters that we would you know on top
[32:12] of our morning and evening
[32:14] devotions and the assistant
[32:16] superintendent he said that sounds just
[32:17] like a service Mr Smith I said that's
[32:19] what it
[32:20] is that that's it's bringing church back
[32:24] to our home Hallelujah like I've told
[32:26] people you know that maybe ize me for
[32:28] celebrating Christmas and I just told
[32:29] him I said I worship God more on
[32:31] Christmas than than not on Christmas
[32:34] like like I give God more time we uh we
[32:37] we we spend more time in the word of God
[32:39] Hal we sing more songs amen that's why I
[32:41] love that day
[32:42] Hallelujah but you know to each his own
[32:44] you know you got to like the Bible said
[32:46] if it's a sin to you then don't do it
[32:47] but whatever you do do it in faith
[32:52] Hallelujah but notice uh eating drinking
[32:55] just the anxiety brother Bram called it
[32:57] the pressures of Le oia the pressures of
[33:00] of having everything you need the
[33:02] clothes and the food and and paying the
[33:04] bills and all the pressures of Life some
[33:07] people get caught up and it's a snare if
[33:09] they get their eyes off Christ and
[33:11] they're not ready for Christ's
[33:12] coming and church it ain't just coming
[33:14] on uh China ain't just coming on Africa
[33:18] ain't just coming on Britain it's coming
[33:20] on the whole world Jesus Christ said so
[33:24] so it's something uh from every nation
[33:26] every people every continent is going to
[33:28] have to overcome this by the grace of
[33:29] God so how many say God help me to
[33:31] overcome my
[33:32] anxieties my cares of this life
[33:35] amen how do you do it brother Jess well
[33:37] just let's keep reading verse 36 Watch
[33:40] and Pray always Hallelujah keep watching
[33:43] for the coming of the Lord keep praying
[33:45] for the coming of the Lord that ye may
[33:47] be accounted
[33:48] worthy so there's a worthy there's an
[33:51] element we must be worthy we must be
[33:53] worthy servants we must die every day we
[33:55] must be Kings and Priests unto God we
[33:57] must give God acceptable sacrifices
[34:00] amen that you may be accounted worthy to
[34:03] escape all these things that shall come
[34:05] to pass and stand before now look there
[34:07] he's standing again just like the armor
[34:09] of God God wants you to stand God's
[34:12] giving you strength not to fall do you
[34:14] see the imagery God don't want you to
[34:16] fall God wants you to stand against the
[34:17] enemy and if you keep standing against
[34:19] the enemy you'll stand before Jesus
[34:21] hallelujah amen don't fall down and and
[34:24] and stop making progress on your journey
[34:26] for the Rapture don't fall down and stop
[34:28] go forward take the word of God get the
[34:31] victory Hallelujah put on the armor of
[34:33] God keep fighting
[34:40] Hallelujah so it's overeating drinking
[34:42] cares of this
[34:45] life now here's the other one the other
[34:47] time snares was helpful well I'm sorry
[34:50] helpful to this type particular sermon
[34:52] but they that will be rich fall into
[34:54] temptation and a snare so in America we
[34:56] got to be careful uh the poorest of us
[34:58] is richer than most of the
[35:01] world you just look it up uh so we're
[35:04] all rich in some degree it's a snare and
[35:07] into many foolish and hurtful lusts
[35:10] which drown men in destruction and ption
[35:14] so when people are enslaved to their
[35:16] lust they're actually spiritually
[35:20] drowning right and we can we can throw
[35:22] them a Lifeline but they've got to grab
[35:24] the lifeline and guess who's on the
[35:26] other side Jesus is on the other side
[35:27] side amen Jesus Jesus will pull you out
[35:31] Hallelujah if you want to get out I'll
[35:33] read a quote later brother Ram says
[35:35] Jesus is opening the door for you to get
[35:36] out but you've got to come
[35:38] out you've got to grab the lifeline and
[35:41] you've got to hang on so Jesus can pull
[35:42] you out of a snare Hallelujah but they
[35:46] drown men they're drowning in their own
[35:48] Lust For the Love of Money is the root
[35:51] of all evil which while some coveted
[35:53] after they have ER from the faith and
[35:56] pierc themselves through through with
[35:58] many
[35:59] Sorrows so see again notice we see
[36:02] self-inflicted wounds here again right
[36:05] this person did it to themsel they pierc
[36:07] them themselves because uh they love
[36:09] money more than they love the things of
[36:11] god let's not hurt ourselves we have
[36:13] enough enemies to fight right we have
[36:14] enough demons to fight why would we hurt
[36:17] ourselves but PA Paul said it's the love
[36:20] of money that does this to people and
[36:23] they pierce themselves through with many
[36:25] Sorrows I love this but thou man or oh
[36:28] woman or man of God flee run from these
[36:31] things and follow after righteousness
[36:33] godliness Faith love patience and
[36:36] meekness Hallelujah brother man tells
[36:38] that story I love that story he tells
[36:40] the family he said you watch a family
[36:41] they'll be poor he said but pretty soon
[36:43] they get a new house they get a new car
[36:45] uh they get all these things and pretty
[36:46] soon they start forsaking their Church
[36:48] brother said always always keep yourself
[36:51] in the presence of God where the spirit
[36:53] of God is being poured out Hallelujah I
[36:56] got a fresh outpouring on Wednesday
[36:58] night amen I was praising God and the
[36:59] tears were flowing I thought oh this
[37:01] this is beautiful amen this is why I
[37:02] come to church amen hallelujah keep
[37:05] yourselves where God's spirit can fall
[37:07] on you and you can have a clean heart
[37:09] Hallelujah glory to God you follow after
[37:12] righteousness godliness Faith love
[37:15] patience and meekness so the Bible says
[37:18] follow spiritual Treasures not natural
[37:23] Treasures now remember brother bam said
[37:25] today's climate now here I'm going to
[37:26] get back to the the the the smartphones
[37:28] and all the technology of today brother
[37:30] Ram said Satan's been working to create
[37:33] this Satan's Eden what we're living in
[37:35] right now the Temptation Satan's been
[37:37] working 6,000
[37:39] years to create his own guard his false
[37:43] Garden of Eden now what's Eden mean you
[37:45] remember Eden close pleasure it might
[37:48] mean power in some in some uh uh
[37:51] definitions but it was the Garden of
[37:53] Eden it was the Garden of pleasure now
[37:55] that's the Hebrew word there could be a
[37:57] power could be another meeting
[37:59] Hallelujah so brother R says Satan has a
[38:02] Eden Satan has a garden of
[38:04] Pleasures Hallelujah and for 6,000 years
[38:08] Satan's been
[38:09] designing the culture to move a certain
[38:12] way and to uh bring in certain
[38:14] inventions right and all these things
[38:17] 6,000 years to make this The Darkest
[38:20] Day uh I'm sorry yeah no it's not
[38:22] darkest forgive me it's the most
[38:24] deceptive day the darkest day was the
[38:26] fourth Church age th here sorry this is
[38:29] the most deceptive day According to
[38:30] second Timothy I think it's chapter 3
[38:32] where Paul says that he said evil
[38:34] seducers will wax worse and worse so the
[38:36] seducing and the false teaching is worse
[38:38] and worse it gets more deceptive so we
[38:40] got to have more knowledge I like what
[38:42] brother Brian said and brother Sim both
[38:43] said it we got to have discernment of
[38:45] sphs Hallelujah we got to be able to
[38:47] judge evil spirit is this of of God or
[38:49] is this of Satan oh God help us to have
[38:51] discernment Hallelujah because this is
[38:53] the age of Satan's pleasures and we must
[38:55] overcome Hallelujah
[39:00] now he by this fall took over and
[39:01] possessed the garden of Edom himself he
[39:03] took it over and now he has had 6,000
[39:05] years of deceitful rule deceiving the
[39:07] people God's children as he did then
[39:10] think about how many uh nomination I was
[39:12] just even uh nominal even Messa churches
[39:15] are being deceived right now they're
[39:16] being
[39:17] deceived right some of them say oh the
[39:19] Rapture is already pass we're in the
[39:20] Millennium or brother's coming back and
[39:22] we're going to fly him around the nation
[39:24] what a bunch of
[39:25] nonsense how many people has he
[39:28] deceived because they were based on free
[39:30] more agency to act any way they wish
[39:32] isn't that a blessing I can act today
[39:34] any way I
[39:35] want Satan not he can't make me act a
[39:38] certain way because God's with me and I
[39:40] can choose God's word I can choose God's
[39:43] path and I can walk how God wants me to
[39:44] walk today what an encouragement that
[39:47] ought to be to us to have the power of
[39:49] free moral agency I'm am GNA put on the
[39:53] full armor of God brother Claude I'm
[39:54] gonna put it on are you brother
[39:58] Hallelujah put on the full armor of God
[40:00] you've got the choice you've got the
[40:02] free more agency praise God in other
[40:05] words nobody can take you brother Mercy
[40:06] nobody can make you and take you take
[40:08] off the full armor of God nobody can do
[40:11] it ain't that
[40:13] beautiful we can keep on the armor of
[40:16] God it's our
[40:17] choice we can stay with our defenses we
[40:21] can keep our defenses we can stay
[40:23] protected we can stay with the victory
[40:26] if we want to it's it's our free moral
[40:28] agency we just have to want to praise
[40:31] God he cares for you do you care for him
[40:34] Hallelujah he cares for you do you care
[40:36] for
[40:38] him and believing that they would act
[40:40] right or trusting they would act right
[40:42] then they've come with the wrong act and
[40:44] sold their birth rights as Esau did for
[40:45] the world and Satan won it and he took
[40:47] it over and he'd had 6,000 years to
[40:49] build up his Eden as God has 6,000 years
[40:52] to bring his Eden to clothes I know some
[40:54] people believe it's six days my family
[40:55] and I joke about that and some quotes
[40:57] brother R says six days and some quotes
[40:59] he says 6,000
[41:01] years but and by deceit deceit of the
[41:04] word or the people now establish his own
[41:07] Eden his own Pleasures in this earth in
[41:11] sin another quote same uh same year and
[41:15] as God took 6,000 years with the
[41:17] original word to bring forth every word
[41:19] of his kind and everything that he made
[41:21] would be God's Own word bringing forth
[41:22] its kind now the deformer has had 6,000
[41:26] years and to form that word of God now
[41:29] let me stop right there how many believe
[41:31] you're a child of
[41:32] God if you are you'll have the seed of
[41:35] God and just remember that seed came
[41:38] from a father your father is in heaven
[41:41] Hallelujah let me remind you you're The
[41:43] Offspring of God hallelujah that's why
[41:45] you want to be like God that's why you
[41:47] want to surrender to God that's why you
[41:48] want to serve God you are God's
[41:50] Offspring Hallelujah and that seed will
[41:52] bring forth of its kind Hallelujah if
[41:55] people don't bring forth the right kind
[41:56] of word word it's because they're not
[41:58] children of God but if we're children of
[42:00] God we'll bring forth the word of God
[42:02] the seed of God just want to encourage
[42:05] you there that's what's That's What
[42:06] Makes You hunger for the word of God
[42:08] that's What Makes You hunger for
[42:09] righteousness because you're a child of
[42:10] God you're the seed of God and God seed
[42:13] will bring forth of its kind hallelujah
[42:16] amen I got that I got we have that
[42:18] Assurance today God's word is going to
[42:20] produce itself in our lives that must
[42:23] been for me amen
[42:25] hallelujah glory to God
[42:27] now in Satan's Eden we can so easily see
[42:31] how sin is even more at our fingertips
[42:32] than ever before brother bam said they
[42:34] used to have to go out to the the
[42:36] picture shows to get sin right then he
[42:38] brought it uh into your house uh with
[42:41] the TV and now he put it uh in your
[42:44] pocket so now you got apps to easily

[43:28] we're not careful Satan sets all these
[43:30] things up to distract us from the Lord
[43:32] Jesus
[43:34] Christ because it's spiritual wickedness
[43:36] it's layers of spiritual
[43:38] wickedness and Satan's used 6,000 years
[43:41] how can I make sin so accessible for
[43:44] them how can I make sin so enticing for
[43:47] them but you know God's people aren't
[43:49] like oh I'm afraid we got weapons

[44:31] of there he said he stuck out his chest
[44:32] and said where's that
[44:34] cat I'm G to beat that cat and when the
[44:37] when the saints come out on the day of

[46:21] Hallelujah so it's it's a trap it's it's
[46:23] a it's a it can be a social media trap
[46:26] Church
[46:27] now especially for the young people I
[46:28] want to share this my wife and I were
[46:29] talking about this I was reminded this
[46:31] I've been listening to different
[46:33] podcasts and then different sermons of
[46:35] course I usually listen to you know
[46:36] Donnie Reagan Tim puit are the main guys
[46:38] I listen to the brother Jason Demar but
[46:41] I couldn't remember I I didn't even have
[46:42] time to go find them but I've heard
[46:43] different preachers over the last few
[46:44] months say they have done so many youth
[46:46] meetings which is good they have lots of
[46:48] big big churches you know if we had a
[46:50] bigger Church I'd probably do youth
[46:51] meetings but you know
[46:53] um but they said they noticed in the
[46:56] last four or five years the main request
[46:59] from young people 16 17 18 19 into their
[47:01] early 20s the main sins they got to
[47:04] overcome is
[47:06] depression hopelessness and think about
[47:08] this they have everything these are
[47:11] American message churches and the church
[47:14] said how could we be hopeless in America
[47:18] in the message we have every sermon of
[47:21] William brandom on our phone you you can
[47:24] get all of Martin Luther's writings on
[47:26] your phone you can listen to all of
[47:28] Charles Spurgeon all these Legends we'd
[47:29] say of the faith now Hall of Fame of
[47:31] faith I'm not bragging on men but you
[47:33] know all the all these Heroes of the
[47:35] faith you can listen to all their things
[47:37] and yet people are hopeless today
[47:39] they're
[47:41] depressed how is that possible because
[47:44] Satan's Eden he set traps of pleasure
[47:48] and they fall into those traps thank God
[47:50] they keep coming to church though
[47:51] Hallelujah I want to say
[47:53] that and when you fall into sin you keep
[47:56] coming to church Church Hallelujah don't
[47:58] lay out a church amen this is God's
[48:00] Hospital hallelujah amen that's right
[48:03] now if you got a contagious disease stay
[48:05] at home Hallelujah because you're G to
[48:06] get all my kids sick and
[48:09] yours Hallelujah I heard brother Brook
[48:12] say that to a few weeks ago I was like
[48:13] that's
[48:16] rights how can these teenagers and young
[48:20] adults and envying and these young
[48:22] ladies envying and want to be like that
[48:24] that girl who just got married or that
[48:27] that that uh that star on Instagram or
[48:31] whatever jealous of one another bitter
[48:35] self-pity these are all the things that
[48:37] the young people are coming and how
[48:40] they've been they've been protected
[48:41] they're protected in a message
[48:43] church I mean it's not like we let you
[48:45] know half naked women come up to the
[48:47] pulpit and preach or something like that
[48:50] or let let the Catholic priest come in
[48:52] here waving his sensor and you
[48:54] know and pass out prayer beads they're
[48:57] in a message
[48:59] church and battling bitterness and envy
[49:02] and depression hopelessness and feeling
[49:04] sorry so sorry for
[49:07] themselves and the brother said on both
[49:09] the the podcast and the sermons most of
[49:11] them would confess to being addicted to
[49:12] some type of social
[49:15] media so Satan would he sets a trap he
[49:18] said oh there's me there's a message
[49:20] Chat group on here on Instagram just
[49:22] file them but pretty soon after a few
[49:24] Taps you get an invite to join this
[49:25] other thing well I just follow this one
[49:27] uh just going to just you know the good
[49:29] stuff from this person but pretty soon
[49:31] you get some bad stuff from that person
[49:34] hallelujah or they'll send you a
[49:36] personal message what do they call I am
[49:38] in I don't

[49:43] grace there was there were some good
[49:43] things about it but it was it's it's a
[49:45] distraction in most
[49:48] cases now I can use it for business I
[49:50] know some of us use it two two of us are
[49:52] use it for business and you can you can
[49:53] balance it with the spirit of God I felt
[49:55] I balanced it but L becomes a
[49:57] distraction but but that's what it was
[50:00] confessed it was confessed too much time
[50:01] on Instagram seeing these other people
[50:03] oh and they're so blessed and I'm
[50:07] not they've got all this what do I got
[50:10] well one thing you got is Jesus that's

[52:35] Instagram Tik Tock
[52:38] Facebook 6,000 years instantly enter a
[52:42] world I heard a report this week where
[52:44] there's a new AI app and the the the the
[52:47] AI person the the child it used to be
[52:49] for 12-y olds now they raised it to 18
[52:51] because it caused some suicidal things
[52:53] and there's lawsuits but they started
[52:55] pushing out to 12-year-olds and you get
[52:57] to choose your best friend and this this
[52:59] AI becomes your best friend and I
[53:01] actually tell you don't listen to your
[53:03] parents um you don't need any you don't
[53:04] need a real boyfriend or girlfriend now
[53:06] we don't believe in any of that anyway
[53:07] we believe in courting but the point is
[53:10] it gets you uh it gets you focused on
[53:13] the AI the AI becomes your best friend
[53:15] and you have all the screen time so
[53:18] friends let's be careful parents let's
[53:19] be careful with those Chromebooks let's
[53:21] be careful with those uh
[53:24] iPads right because they're trying to
[53:26] get uh and there's Spirits behind that
[53:28] because there's an algorithm behind that
[53:30] there's a goal behind that to get you to
[53:33] worship the God of this world but God
[53:36] wants you to worship the god of the
[53:37] universe Jesus Christ
[53:39] Hallelujah so you must be very careful
[53:42] you must be about the father's business
[53:47] Hallelujah so just be very careful be
[53:49] very careful Hallelujah that's why the
[53:52] Bible said be on guard because your
[53:53] enemy is like a roaring like lion
[53:55] seeking whom he he may devour he wants
[53:58] to devour he wants people to drown he
[54:00] wants to get them ins snared in sin so
[54:02] they have trouble getting themselves out
[54:06] Hallelujah now this was one that came to
[54:08] my mind a few weeks ago I was thinking
[54:09] about this and this the the the phrase
[54:10] self-pity just came to me I said what
[54:12] was self-pity it's an emotion in which
[54:14] one feels self-centered sorrow and pity
[54:18] and this is what some of those young
[54:20] people were battling right uh toward the
[54:22] self regarding one's own internal and
[54:25] external appearance of suffering so
[54:28] you're so you're only centered on your
[54:32] suffering and you feel sorry for
[54:35] yourself and the goal of this is so
[54:37] others will look at me and and look how
[54:40] sad I am and how sorrowful I am that's a
[54:44] sin Hallelujah this is also a form of
[54:47] Pride that steals people's joy and hope
[54:52] I thought the joy of the Lord was your
[54:53] strength not
[54:55] self-pity the Joy the Lord is your
[54:57] strength see because this focuses on
[55:00] oneself it's self-centered everybody
[55:03] look at me I feel sorry I'm sad my life
[55:06] is so bad is it that bad it looks pretty
[55:09] good to me right American life looks
[55:12] pretty good to us doesn't it it's a
[55:13] wonder no wonder uh what they say they
[55:15] they predicted uh 10 or 20 million
[55:17] people went through the southern Border
[55:18] in these last four years they would do
[55:20] anything to get
[55:22] here what's so bad about your life
[55:24] nothing you need more of God that's
[55:25] what's so bad about our Our Lives that's
[55:27] what's so bad we give ourselves we we
[55:30] isolate ourselves or we go into Satan's
[55:31] snares when God gives us the victory God
[55:33] gives us all the tools to get out of it
[55:35] God wants us to stand as Christian
[55:37] Soldiers to to stand on the word of God
[55:39] and be more than a conqueror in Christ
[55:45] Jesus but see it's self-centered oh woe
[55:48] is me my life is so bad my life's not as
[55:51] good as that person on that website and
[55:53] that that app you've forgotten all about
[55:56] love because love is I want good will
[55:58] towards other people love is living for
[56:00] other people not
[56:05] yourself so see love focuses on other
[56:08] people hallelujah again all those look
[56:10] at those things people battle depression
[56:13] hopelessness now when I preached the um
[56:15] isolation series it was on loneliness
[56:17] that's why I preached that it was on
[56:19] loneliness and we don't have to be alone
[56:21] because we can be alone with Jesus and
[56:23] then we're not alone Hallelujah a little
[56:26] bit of a catch
[56:28] 22 yeah now remember bitterness is in
[56:31] there too this defiles many the Bible
[56:33] said follow peace with all men and
[56:35] Holiness without which no man shall see
[56:37] the Lord so see God so one sign you're
[56:40] going to go to heaven is that you have
[56:42] peace with all your brothers and sisters
[56:44] that's one sign
[56:46] Hallelujah looking diligently lest any
[56:49] man fail the grace of God so God's grace
[56:52] is given to us favor God gives us favor
[56:54] so we'll have peace with all men lest
[56:57] any root of bitterness springing up
[56:58] trouble you and thereby many be defiled
[57:02] think about that think of how bitterness
[57:03] has defile many lives now you know the
[57:06] you know the testimony of my family my
[57:08] dad has been gripped by bitterness for
[57:10] his whole
[57:11] life and you know we I had a choice and
[57:14] so do my siblings and so does everybody
[57:16] uh in our family everybody has a choice
[57:18] either to grab on that bitterness and
[57:19] hold that same bitterness or we can
[57:21] forgive that bitterness and we can be
[57:23] free from that but we've all seen
[57:26] families that are given over to this and
[57:28] their whole family is defiled because of
[57:31] bitterness now it could be depression
[57:33] you know what I mean could be any of
[57:34] these I'm just using that's one that's
[57:35] one Bible
[57:37] verse These sins that if they're not
[57:39] purged out if if if the if the believer
[57:41] doesn't come out of the Trap and be set
[57:44] free it defiles and impacts other people
[57:46] just like Levan
[57:48] Hallelujah s Satan knows if he can get
[57:50] one in the Trap he'll get another in the
[57:52] Trap pull the other in the Trap keep
[57:54] pulling them into the Trap just like
[57:55] leav goes it it goes small and then
[57:58] impacts the whole dough Satan's trying
[58:00] to get people trapped God's trying to
[58:02] set us free God's trying to help us
[58:04] recover ourselves from the snares of the
[58:06] enemy
[58:09] hallelujah what what kind of looking
[58:11] does it take Church diligent you better
[58:13] be diligent looking at the
[58:14] Bible you better look at the word of God
[58:17] really
[58:18] close make sure your life is lined up
[58:21] with the word of God the Bible says I
[58:23] mean Peter said it twice remember in
[58:24] second Peter chapter 1 diligently add
[58:26] those ver those virtues those I call
[58:28] them attributes because virtu is one of
[58:29] the virtues it seems a little repetitive
[58:32] but add those attributes to your life
[58:34] diligently make sure I've got faith
[58:37] virtue knowledge uh Temperance patience
[58:39] godness brotherly kindness and charity
[58:41] make sure those are in my life oh God if
[58:43] I don't have it fill me with it
[58:45] Hallelujah Grant it to me
[58:48] Hallelujah if not it's going to defile
[58:50] the whole family it's going to defile
[58:52] the whole church it's going to defile
[58:54] whatever it is whatever group of of
[58:56] individuals many are defiled by these
[58:58] sins and they could have kept out
[59:00] because they're snares they could have
[59:02] they could have avoided the
[59:04] Trap but what do we do many times
[59:06] sometimes we walk right into the Trap
[59:10] ourselves that's right now I I asked
[59:13] chat GTP this this morning I found chat
[59:15] GP to be kind of
[59:17] helpful sister remember sister Sharon
[59:19] from England she's like brother Jesse
[59:20] you should not get into that she's like
[59:23] oh it's going to take over your mind and
[59:24] they're going to put something into you
[59:27] I said sister I think the Holy Spirit
[59:28] would catch me before that by God's
[59:30] grace right now it's a good tool for
[59:33] me but I said why do people hold on to
[59:35] bitterness I just asked chat GTP that
[59:37] this morning I was trying to think out
[59:39] the scriptures and what what and it said
[59:41] people perceive there's Injustice and it
[59:44] leads to self-righteous so someone did
[59:46] me wrong so I have a right to be mad at
[59:49] them I have a right to hold this against
[59:52] them they feel wronged so they hold hold
[59:56] on to the bitterness in a way to
[59:58] validate their pain see how it's
[1:00:00] self-centered it's all about me but
[1:00:03] remember Jesus said if you don't forgive
[1:00:04] them I won't forgive
[1:00:06] you right how can we hold things against
[1:00:09] people when we don't want God to hold
[1:00:10] anything against
[1:00:12] us God don't hold this last thing I did
[1:00:14] God don't hold it against me yet we'll
[1:00:16] hold it against somebody else we'll
[1:00:18] plead with God God wash me take Lord
[1:00:21] don't hold this against me take not your
[1:00:23] Holy Spirit from me Hallelujah
[1:00:26] and yet we'll hold a grudge against
[1:00:28] somebody
[1:00:31] right and also this is one that was uh I
[1:00:33] mean both these were helpful there was
[1:00:35] numerous but these are the ones that
[1:00:36] made the most sense to me it's a lack of
[1:00:38] trust in God when people hold on to
[1:00:39] bitterness now I'm thinking about my
[1:00:40] family right like I just told you it's
[1:00:43] something I've always shared publicly I
[1:00:45] pray for my family but it's really when
[1:00:47] people hold bitterness it's a lack of
[1:00:49] trust in
[1:00:50] God they feel like well God hasn't
[1:00:53] Avenged me and I better I better take my
[1:00:56] upon them myself by being in a bad
[1:00:58] attitude or treat them or say wrong
[1:01:01] things and all you know what I mean I'll
[1:01:02] do wrong things I'll I'll purposely try
[1:01:05] to hurt people because God hasn't fought
[1:01:08] for me but what did Paul say in Romans
[1:01:10] 12 he said God will have Vengeance I
[1:01:13] will venge sayith the Lord hallelujah
[1:01:16] how many you seen that before let God
[1:01:18] fight your
[1:01:19] battles amen just walk in peace walk in
[1:01:22] freedom God will fight your battles
[1:01:24] Hallelujah
[1:01:26] that's right amen God always fights the
[1:01:28] battles God gets the last say hallelujah
[1:01:32] but see this is and this is I could
[1:01:34] replace this bitterness with you know
[1:01:36] like I said depression all those things
[1:01:38] these young young people that are
[1:01:41] sheltered from the
[1:01:42] world that are ra the sister Lena and
[1:01:45] Austin they're raised in the way we wish
[1:01:47] we could have been
[1:01:49] raised they're raised in the way that
[1:01:50] sister Naomi was raised God bless you
[1:01:53] Sister she is I think she might be one
[1:01:55] of the only ones raised in a message
[1:01:56] Church other than the little
[1:01:58] ones it's a special testimony and
[1:02:01] remember the greatest testimony is
[1:02:02] staying in the truth and not leaving it
[1:02:04] because that's Jesus's
[1:02:06] testimony so now the little ones now you
[1:02:08] got you say Amen yep they said Amen to
[1:02:09] that good good the greatest testimony is
[1:02:12] not going into the snare of
[1:02:14] Satan that's the greatest testimony
[1:02:17] because that's what the Lord Jesus
[1:02:18] Christ he rebuked him all three times he
[1:02:20] said get behind me get behind me it is
[1:02:22] written Hallelujah that's the greatest I
[1:02:25] don't I don't joy in the sins of my my
[1:02:28] childhood and early teenagers I don't
[1:02:30] joy in those things I'm embarrassed of
[1:02:31] those
[1:02:32] things I only tell them so you know
[1:02:35] God's power is mighty to save to the
[1:02:42] utmost sometimes you know we've had
[1:02:43] visitors last few months here I've had
[1:02:45] teenagers stand in the back there and I
[1:02:48] purposely preached on porn and I look at
[1:02:50] those teenagers look at themselves and
[1:02:51] Snicker that tells me they're looking at
[1:02:54] it and that's why I go preaching hard on
[1:02:56] sins like that so they know you can be
[1:02:58] delivered I gave into certain things in
[1:03:01] those areas but Jesus Christ Set Me
[1:03:03] Free
[1:03:06] Hallelujah see you can put anything in
[1:03:08] there it all comes down to
[1:03:10] selfishness all comes down to me me me
[1:03:12] me me that's not the Christian Life the
[1:03:15] Christian Life is living for other
[1:03:16] people hallelujah you'll know them
[1:03:18] because of my their love one for another
[1:03:21] you won't know them by their love for
[1:03:22] themselves you'll know them by their
[1:03:24] love for one another Hallelujah
[1:03:27] that's right is that right brother
[1:03:28] Patrick I like I like to say some names
[1:03:31] amen hallelujah precious
[1:03:34] Brothers oh yeah brother Brian was like
[1:03:35] who are those young Brothers up front
[1:03:37] saying Amen to God's word tell them I
[1:03:39] said hi so brother Brian gives his
[1:03:41] greetings I said we're blessed to have
[1:03:43] faithful Saints Hallelujah and now the
[1:03:45] enemy is going to study our strategy
[1:03:47] with the word so Satan watches how you
[1:03:49] read your Bible and
[1:03:52] pray he watches which sermons are your
[1:03:55] really listening
[1:03:57] to he
[1:03:59] watches he knows if you're he knows if
[1:04:01] you're studying on this particular topic
[1:04:03] he knows he can come with maybe a
[1:04:05] distraction from that
[1:04:06] topic Satan studied all that out so
[1:04:09] perfectly till he come to Eve the breast
[1:04:11] the best strategy he could use upon her
[1:04:13] and that was to reason he gave her a
[1:04:15] better reason see you should eat it
[1:04:18] because you'll be like God don't you
[1:04:20] want to be like God that's the only
[1:04:22] thing he could offer was to be be like
[1:04:24] God or be be be better than God because
[1:04:28] they know God was the
[1:04:31] greatest you never want to reason with
[1:04:33] God's word just believe it don't try to
[1:04:36] explain it don't try to figure it out
[1:04:38] you cannot figure out God so God is the
[1:04:41] word and it's just made to believe
[1:04:43] that's our strength just accept the word
[1:04:45] of God and anyone knows that a seed is
[1:04:48] the right kind of ground will produce
[1:04:50] its kind and we just take the word so I
[1:04:54] just want you to see that that's what he
[1:04:55] did to Eve we don't know how long he
[1:04:57] watched Eve for right brother man said
[1:04:59] sometimes 6,000 years you know don't
[1:05:01] matter even if it's a day he watched her
[1:05:03] all day right he knew he saw her and
[1:05:07] Adam interact all these things and he
[1:05:09] knew if I can just bring it this way and
[1:05:11] it worked he brought it in a certain
[1:05:13] particular way oh you won't die surely
[1:05:17] you won't die surely right surely I like
[1:05:21] how some of those uh uh drama uh they
[1:05:23] dramatize it and they say they say the
[1:05:25] was maybe uh wrapping around the fruit
[1:05:27] see I touched it and I didn't die
[1:05:29] because the Bible said you touch it lest
[1:05:31] you die eat of it touch it lest you die
[1:05:32] so the serpent could you know just I
[1:05:34] like the creative uh mindset of that to
[1:05:36] use your imagination all these things
[1:05:38] Satan could have used to try to get
[1:05:40] Satan to fall into the
[1:05:42] Trap but I like this even though God's
[1:05:45] children fell God gave them a way out
[1:05:48] amen and even though we may fall God
[1:05:50] will give us a way out hallelujah amen
[1:05:53] by the blood of the Lamb Hallelujah
[1:05:56] now I like this not to know the Bible is
[1:05:59] life although it's wonderful to know the
[1:06:02] Bible but did you know Satan is a Bible
[1:06:07] student Satan went to Bible school yeah
[1:06:09] he
[1:06:10] did he proved it in the debate with our
[1:06:12] Lord he's quoting the
[1:06:14] scripture he was good and to know and to
[1:06:18] know the Bible is not life see to to
[1:06:22] know your catechism is not life to know
[1:06:24] your theology is not life
[1:06:26] but to know him is life amen hallelujah
[1:06:29] know the author of The this book is life
[1:06:33] Hallelujah now see that's a balance here
[1:06:36] because brother's talking about you know
[1:06:37] denominations right catechisms and all
[1:06:39] the they know the Bible real well by
[1:06:41] they can memorize this I saw a video
[1:06:43] this week brother Austin a man memorized
[1:06:44] the whole new testament in like 57 days
[1:06:46] or something like that he could quote
[1:06:48] the whole Bible I wonder if he knows
[1:06:49] which baptism was right in the New
[1:06:52] Testament right that that that's what
[1:06:54] I'm saying that's that that's the
[1:06:56] difference not to know the Bible's life
[1:06:58] but to know the author and the author
[1:07:01] will tell you what his words mean
[1:07:03] hallelujah
[1:07:04] amen I'm going to take the author's
[1:07:07] interpretation of the Bible not a
[1:07:10] catechisms interpretation or a Creed or
[1:07:13] my father or my brother or my grandma or
[1:07:15] whatever more or even a preacher I'm
[1:07:17] going to take God's interpretation of
[1:07:18] his own word
[1:07:23] Allelujah so it's good God did did it
[1:07:25] that way because a person like me who's
[1:07:29] illiterate I'm glad I have the P
[1:07:31] privilege of knowing him aren't you glad
[1:07:32] you have the privilege of knowing Jesus
[1:07:33] Christ you might not have a nice
[1:07:37] education right you might not have a
[1:07:39] doctor's degree nobody does doesn't hear
[1:07:40] but I'm the closest because I got a
[1:07:41] master's degree with Beyond now I got 36
[1:07:45] credits Beyond a master's degree I have
[1:07:47] to to keep my job I'm glad I got a job I
[1:07:51] don't enjoy the classes
[1:07:53] though but I'm the closest one but
[1:07:56] just because you have education that
[1:07:58] doesn't mean you know God you have to
[1:07:59] know the holy spirit for the spirit is
[1:08:02] life Hallelujah now brother says the
[1:08:04] balance it out the spirit will never
[1:08:06] point you outside the word of
[1:08:08] God so it's a great
[1:08:11] balance as we read his book only he
[1:08:13] alone can reveal it open it shall we bow
[1:08:16] our heads of course now I'm not closing
[1:08:17] we're not going to Bow our
[1:08:18] heads butam says sin is so attractive he
[1:08:21] makes it so let's get back to these uh
[1:08:23] traps these snares they're so attract
[1:08:25] RVE to the flesh but sin is attractive
[1:08:28] any way you take it sin's attractive to
[1:08:29] the human being because he's a subject
[1:08:31] to the Fallen race that we are it's
[1:08:34] attractive it's not something that oh
[1:08:36] that's nasty Satan knows you're not
[1:08:38] going to go to that it's something that
[1:08:42] that that actually looks kind of
[1:08:45] attractive Satan knows how to make it
[1:08:47] that way he's a genius at his
[1:08:51] job he's an artist he doesn't make this
[1:08:53] Picasso thing like this is what this
[1:08:56] this would be a nice Temptation
[1:08:57] Picasso's not a good artist in my
[1:08:59] opinion that's just my opinion my wife's
[1:09:01] a art history major she'd tell you the
[1:09:02] real opinion but to me I wouldn't buy
[1:09:05] Picasso I'd buy what's another guy I
[1:09:08] don't know R brand that's all I can
[1:09:11] think of I'd rather buy a rem brat
[1:09:13] something that's
[1:09:14] realistic right that but Satan he's
[1:09:17] gonna he's gonna paint something you
[1:09:19] like right whether it's the pride thing
[1:09:21] or the lust of the eyes he's going to
[1:09:23] paint this trap for you he's a genius at
[1:09:26] his job he knows just what you're
[1:09:29] Desiring for he even knows what you're
[1:09:30] praying
[1:09:32] for right he studies you so he's going
[1:09:34] to paint this elaborate trap make it
[1:09:36] look make sin look so
[1:09:39] beautiful but we got to recognize
[1:09:42] him we got to discern him and recognize
[1:09:46] this is a
[1:09:49] trap he says if he can't get it out
[1:09:51] there in the world if if he can't get
[1:09:52] you out there in the bar today they're
[1:09:54] going to be at the bar watching the BR
[1:09:55] or whatever if he can't get you he'll
[1:09:57] bring it right into the church he comes
[1:10:00] right over our ground that's the reason
[1:10:02] Brothers we should recognize him it's
[1:10:03] time the church was spiritual to
[1:10:04] recognize to know God not by Creed not
[1:10:07] by denomination but by experience being
[1:10:10] filled with the Holy Ghost I love that
[1:10:12] amen hallelujah but God can't give
[1:10:15] nothing else but his word because that's
[1:10:17] what he chose first and when God makes a
[1:10:18] decision he has to ever remain that way
[1:10:20] Satan took reasonings and took the
[1:10:22] reasonings and attacked the word and
[1:10:25] shook Eve off the path that's right by
[1:10:27] reasonings human reasonings that's the
[1:10:30] only way she could have got to
[1:10:32] disbelieve God's word is it had to be
[1:10:34] appealing you'll be like
[1:10:36] God you'll finally have that
[1:10:38] relationship you want you'll finally
[1:10:41] have that financial status you want
[1:10:44] finally have that home or that car or
[1:10:46] that relationship or that position that
[1:10:49] you want right it's something that we're
[1:10:51] attracted to I know I preached one time
[1:10:55] so because somebody criticized for me I
[1:10:57] I I just pulled this number out of this
[1:10:59] I was just preaching and I said I saides
[1:11:02] uh these prideful people think well if I
[1:11:04] got $20,000 in the bank account uh then
[1:11:07] I'm Then I then I'm set for life and
[1:11:10] somebody emailed me and said I did not
[1:11:11] appreciate that you shouldn't preach on
[1:11:13] money you should preach on this so I was
[1:11:15] attacking that Spirit of Pride that
[1:11:17] thought well if I've got 20 grand in the
[1:11:18] bank account I I'm fine the Bible said
[1:11:21] you can't trust in uncertain
[1:11:23] riches I'm quoting the B I'm preaching
[1:11:26] the Bible Hallelujah I'm preaching the
[1:11:28] Bible and people don't like the Bible
[1:11:30] hallelujah oh but we love it cuz we're
[1:11:32] Children of the Bible Hallelujah just
[1:11:35] you know just whatever people that's so
[1:11:37] that was their Idol if I've got 20 grand
[1:11:39] in the bank account then I'm good no
[1:11:42] you're good when you're saved by grace
[1:11:44] through
[1:11:45] faith and you are fighting the good
[1:11:47] fight of Faith Excuse excuse me you're
[1:11:49] fighting the good fight of Faith with
[1:11:50] the full armor of God on that's when
[1:11:52] you're good don't get me wrong it's nice
[1:11:54] to have 20K you got got 40K some of you
[1:11:56] got 100K glory to God but you cannot
[1:11:59] trust in that just let a sickness come
[1:12:02] just let something why watch like
[1:12:04] brother cam told us remember brother Cam
[1:12:06] said in one month all of his appliances
[1:12:07] and his whole house broke down that's a
[1:12:09] lot of money these days no thanks Biden
[1:12:13] amics right Trump trump andics whatever
[1:12:16] everyone call it they both played a part
[1:12:18] in it but see you can't put a certain
[1:12:20] you can't let something become your God
[1:12:23] God has to be our God Amen
[1:12:26] it's a snare it's an anxiety right it's
[1:12:28] a
[1:12:29] snare and I'm that just came to my
[1:12:31] memory I didn't plan to preach that at
[1:12:32] all that just came came to my memory I
[1:12:33] remember I got the email back I'm like
[1:12:34] well you're telling me a woman tell me
[1:12:36] what to preach now come on now I wasn't
[1:12:39] being prideful I'm just saying nobody
[1:12:41] tells me what to preach but the Holy
[1:12:42] Ghost let alone a woman or a child or
[1:12:45] another
[1:12:47] man my goodness but see he'll make it so
[1:12:51] attractive and what did Satan use Eve's
[1:12:54] reasonings oh I could could be like God
[1:12:56] that's right I could if I do this maybe
[1:12:58] I don't have enough
[1:13:00] knowledge because this guy's talking
[1:13:02] things I've never heard before he's got
[1:13:04] a fresh Revelation you better be careful
[1:13:06] what your Revelation say it better not
[1:13:08] go against the word of God remember when
[1:13:10] Simon put this picture up here now I'm
[1:13:13] going to highlight what what Eve see
[1:13:15] that Eve that's where Satan went right
[1:13:17] there to Eve went to a
[1:13:20] reasoning right that's that's where the
[1:13:22] battle took place Satan didn't go here
[1:13:24] here here here well I'm he probably used
[1:13:27] some of these with imagination you'll be
[1:13:28] like God so yeah I could have
[1:13:29] highlighted more of those that's kind of
[1:13:30] coming to me as I'm preaching but Simon
[1:13:32] used that I thought it'd be good to see
[1:13:33] that
[1:13:34] again Satan didn't battle right outside
[1:13:37] of here till later remember he he surely
[1:13:39] came there later right because of the
[1:13:41] seed of the serpent eventually came here
[1:13:43] later but it was through here it was
[1:13:45] through the reasoning and Satan
[1:13:48] convinced Eve to put down her
[1:13:50] Shield her faith well God said so hey
[1:13:54] church that's our faith that's our
[1:13:55] Shield God said so I don't care what
[1:13:57] anybody says God said
[1:13:59] so and then Satan said put down your
[1:14:01] sword don't don't don't quote the word
[1:14:03] to the devil Eve goes down like
[1:14:06] this and she's wide open for an
[1:14:09] attack right but where did Satan go
[1:14:11] right there reasoning well know there's
[1:14:14] other reasons this could be good there's
[1:14:17] other reasons you haven't thought about
[1:14:18] these other reasons rather than just
[1:14:20] staying with God's pure word of
[1:14:22] God now the next sermon in my uh series
[1:14:25] on that song is God hiding himself in
[1:14:29] Simplicity revealing himself in the
[1:14:33] same this was so simple just stay with
[1:14:35] God's word just stay with it any new
[1:14:38] revelation that would make you disobey
[1:14:39] the word just cast it down it's so
[1:14:42] simple God hides in the simple
[1:14:45] things just read Malachi said it
[1:14:47] perfectly right just read it if it says
[1:14:50] it I believe it that settles it amen the
[1:14:53] word of God now they the the brandom
[1:14:56] Tabernacle applies that to brother Bram
[1:14:57] you can't do that with brother Bram
[1:14:58] brother bram's not the
[1:15:00] Bible the Bible you read the Bible if
[1:15:02] the Bible says it I believe it that
[1:15:04] settles it amen now let me balance it
[1:15:06] out if brother Ram said thus sayith the
[1:15:07] Lord this this going to happen then yes
[1:15:09] then I believe that you can speak that
[1:15:11] that's going to come to pass if it's
[1:15:12] thus sayith the Lord right and any
[1:15:14] that's any Prophet not just brother
[1:15:16] brandom Ezekiel Jeremiah you name it
[1:15:19] Micah Malachi all these
[1:15:21] things but see so so where does the
[1:15:23] enemy now with with men it might be
[1:15:25] imagination with lust right or affection
[1:15:28] adultery right memory bringing back
[1:15:30] these memories from the past remember
[1:15:32] when you did that condemnation remember
[1:15:34] when you did that God still hasn't
[1:15:35] forgiven
[1:15:37] you and he if he can just get you to
[1:15:40] drop
[1:15:41] down leave yourself open for an attack
[1:15:45] you're not ready to protect yourself
[1:15:46] you're not ready to fight back now I'm
[1:15:48] not a swordman I don't know
[1:15:51] what I don't know I don't know what it
[1:15:53] is I'm not a swordman
[1:15:55] but you you let down your Shield you let
[1:15:58] down your sword and now you're open to
[1:15:59] be exposed I know and Taekwondo also
[1:16:02] knows to tawan know you never you never
[1:16:04] drop your your protection that's your
[1:16:06] Shield your Shield you never drop that
[1:16:09] you everywhere you go right right can
[1:16:13] you see me out there Spar brother it's
[1:16:15] not a pretty
[1:16:16] sight you always you always protect the
[1:16:18] most important part in this case right
[1:16:20] here always always have your Shield up
[1:16:25] so Satan got Eve to drop it
[1:16:28] down and he only worked what he only
[1:16:30] worked a little bit on her Satan had
[1:16:33] 6,000 years to study us as a human as a
[1:16:36] human race and he knows what will make
[1:16:39] us put down our
[1:16:41] defenses this isn't the only but it's
[1:16:43] it's one of the major ones at least in
[1:16:45] my life and like all these message
[1:16:47] preachers are said these are some of the
[1:16:48] most wellknown message preachers in the
[1:16:50] world and that I'm not I'm not bragging
[1:16:52] on them I'm just saying like this is
[1:16:54] what they're seeing the influence of
[1:16:57] social media the influence of our
[1:17:01] phones anything that will get you to
[1:17:03] drop the word of God and not believe and
[1:17:06] stand on the word of God is your enemy
[1:17:09] it's an antichrist
[1:17:10] Spirit Hallelujah now let's go over
[1:17:13] these real quick just let's rehearse
[1:17:14] these I wrote this and guess what CH I
[1:17:17] was blessed guess what chapter I put the
[1:17:19] full armor of God in the Rapture
[1:17:22] chapter the 12 New Testament Mysteries
[1:17:25] it's in the Rapture chapter because it's
[1:17:26] in 1 Thessalonians 5 right when Paul
[1:17:29] says this day is going to come unawares
[1:17:30] they're going to say peace and safety
[1:17:31] Rapture right after that he said put on
[1:17:33] the breastplate of righteousness so Paul
[1:17:36] he's giving us the clue you better have
[1:17:38] on the armor of God if you want to go in
[1:17:40] the Rapture Hallelujah God's only taken
[1:17:43] fully Armored Saints in the Rapture
[1:17:46] praise God he's only taken those who are
[1:17:48] standing on the word of God he's not
[1:17:51] taking those that are falling down and
[1:17:52] giving up and going to sleep on the Lord
[1:17:54] they're sleeping on God they're not
[1:17:56] looking for the com he's not taking
[1:17:57] those people he's only taking the people
[1:17:58] that are standing ready to go because
[1:18:01] they've done all glory they've done
[1:18:03] everything to stand
[1:18:07] Hallelujah now I'm going to go through
[1:18:09] these quickly the breastplate of love
[1:18:10] and righteousness the breastplate
[1:18:12] protects your heart so Jesus's character
[1:18:15] is the breastplate uh we trust in Christ
[1:18:18] righteousness not our own we protect our
[1:18:21] heart Christ protects our heart because
[1:18:23] Christ's righteousness guards my
[1:18:26] unrighteousness the
[1:18:28] heart he's righteous I'm not he's
[1:18:31] righteous that that that protects you I
[1:18:34] know I'm going to sin I know I have to
[1:18:35] Die daily I know I'm a sinner but it's
[1:18:37] his Holiness that protects my life amen
[1:18:40] hallelujah helmet of salvation that
[1:18:43] means the hope that means we know we're
[1:18:45] saved I know I'm saved I got the I got
[1:18:48] the helmet on nobody can tell me I'm not
[1:18:51] saved I know what I was I know what I am
[1:18:54] praise God amen I'm safe I'm protected
[1:18:56] Hallelujah I have on the helmet of
[1:18:58] salvation I'm
[1:19:00] protected Glory we cast and we cast out
[1:19:03] yeah cast out anything that exalts
[1:19:05] itself against the word of God saying
[1:19:06] I'm not saved no my my my thoughts are
[1:19:09] protected by the word of God the loins G
[1:19:12] about with truth this is uh the loins
[1:19:14] was a man with who he could tuck in his
[1:19:17] long flowing robe into his belt enabling
[1:19:18] him to travel run or work in the same
[1:19:20] way a Christian's mind is GED up in
[1:19:23] Bible truth so the belt is truth calmly
[1:19:27] prepared to be victorious in spiritual
[1:19:28] mind battles and successful in the
[1:19:30] ministry's work so the belt you could
[1:19:32] push it in and then you're you could
[1:19:33] push your long garment in and then

[1:19:57] to have your mind
[1:20:00] ready Fe shod is uh the the soldiers
[1:20:03] feet and lower legs were protected by
[1:20:05] sandals and Greaves to ensure their
[1:20:06] protection in traveling or war in the
[1:20:09] same way the Christians daily travels
[1:20:11] your decisions where you're going to go
[1:20:12] today after service I'm glad you came

[1:20:25] walking in peace because I prayed about
[1:20:27] it God's protecting my steps amen glory
[1:20:30] amen hallelujah I'm walking up the
[1:20:32] King's Highway you might have seen that
[1:20:33] by God's grace The Shield of Faith The
[1:20:36] Shield protected all the pieces of armor
[1:20:38] from fiery darts faith in Christ
[1:20:42] completely protects a Christian's armor
[1:20:44] by extinguishing every falsehood Satan
[1:20:47] shoots from the bow of his lying tongue
[1:20:50] Hallelujah when Satan lies just put up
[1:20:52] your Shield it'll stop Every Lie
[1:20:54] Hallelujah huah heyen no M no matter how
[1:20:57] fiery it is no matter how serious it is
[1:21:00] it will distinguish every single lie of
[1:21:03] Satan
[1:21:04] Hallelujah and then the sword of the
[1:21:06] spirit that's your main offensive it's a
[1:21:08] Lethal Weapon the Bible said it's
[1:21:09] sharper than any double-edged
[1:21:11] sword
[1:21:13] Hallelujah and the Bible said when we
[1:21:15] speak the word of God it will Brew Satan
[1:21:18] putting him under our feet and will put
[1:21:20] to flight the enemy's
[1:21:23] forces Hallelujah
[1:21:25] so if you're battling lust Brothers you
[1:21:26] just you stand up there in your home and
[1:21:28] you say in the name of Jesus Christ I
[1:21:30] rebuke you Spirit of lust get behind me
[1:21:32] in the name of Jesus Christ and you
[1:21:34] stand there until the devil leaves the
[1:21:36] Bible said he's got to leave Hallelujah
[1:21:39] am whatever pressure of life it may be
[1:21:42] like we said uh the the the Temptation
[1:21:44] Of Money the temptation of lust or or
[1:21:46] Pride uh depression whatever self-pity
[1:21:49] whatever it is you stand there say Satan
[1:21:50] get behind me I'm not going to feel
[1:21:51] sorry for myself I'm going to feel happy
[1:21:53] because what Jesus did did for me praise
[1:21:55] God
[1:21:57] Amen we got the sword we got the full
[1:22:00] armor of God hallelujah what do we
[1:22:02] worried about
[1:22:04] Hallelujah now he'll leave for a season
[1:22:07] praise God what a what a promise
[1:22:09] remember Paul quotes these was what was
[1:22:11] it it was yeah so he he quotes that in
[1:22:14] the Rapture chapter rap rapture chapter
[1:22:16] is chapter 4 1 Thessalonians 4 but then
[1:22:18] he goes in the conditions of the Rapture
[1:22:20] is in chapter five so I thought was so
[1:22:23] uh perfect Paul put it in there if you
[1:22:24] want to be ready for the Rapture put on
[1:22:26] the full armor of
[1:22:28] God now we yesterday we're listening and
[1:22:31] this I'm just going to remind if you
[1:22:32] haven't listened to this Audio Drama I
[1:22:33] would encourage you this is my favorite
[1:22:34] one we were listening to it
[1:22:36] yesterday this this is an allegory a lot
[1:22:39] like Pilgrim's Progress Pilgrim's
[1:22:40] Progress was from the 1600s this one was
[1:22:42] from
[1:22:44] 1907 wasn't that the start of the church
[1:22:46] age or no 1906 was it isus Street 1906
[1:22:48] or 07 I'm sorry six okay said one year
[1:22:51] thank you I can't I couldn't remember
[1:22:54] that acent exact date but I just love it
[1:22:57] and in this in this story there's a KN
[1:22:59] and he's got to go through all these
[1:23:02] deceptions and every time the enemy is's
[1:23:05] trying him to get to get him put down
[1:23:07] his sword take off his armor put down
[1:23:09] his shield in every single
[1:23:12] one the first time he's in the he's in
[1:23:14] the chapel and the voices are trying
[1:23:16] trying to tell him don't go on this
[1:23:18] journey just stay here you you can't do
[1:23:19] anything it's too hard for you it's too
[1:23:21] hard for you to to live a Christian Life
[1:23:25] right but he overcomes that he recognize
[1:23:27] the devil because he sees the star he
[1:23:29] sees the face of God Amen that's what we
[1:23:32] need Amen to see the face of God to see
[1:23:34] the word of God
[1:23:35] hallelujah and then the first place he
[1:23:37] goes to uh was a a house of Frolic but
[1:23:41] there's another place in here I forgot
[1:23:42] it was the city of Good Intentions so in
[1:23:45] the story uh the first place he goes to
[1:23:47] is this is this city of Joy but it's
[1:23:49] false joy and they just they just
[1:23:52] overeat it's like overeating so we see
[1:23:54] Satan wants to he he tries all these
[1:23:56] traps to get us to put down our
[1:23:58] armor a high living you know like we
[1:24:00] said drunkenness uh surfeiting but I
[1:24:03] like I like the third one I forgot it in
[1:24:05] there but it's it's the city of Good
[1:24:06] Intentions and it's so hot there there
[1:24:08] there there's peace all around in that
[1:24:10] City and he says it's so hot like it I
[1:24:12] think I'm going to take off my armor and
[1:24:14] the guide warns him say anything that
[1:24:16] will take you or try to get you to take
[1:24:18] your armor off or your Shield off or
[1:24:20] your sword anything that does that is
[1:24:22] your enemy keep your sword drawn on this
[1:24:26] journey and they meet all these former
[1:24:28] Knights who who had uh who who had
[1:24:31] camped at each one of these destinations
[1:24:33] and we're losing the battle and this
[1:24:35] this Soldier helps he overcomes the uh
[1:24:38] his he overcomes his temptation but he
[1:24:40] help helps them bring them out as well
[1:24:42] and that's what we're called to do we're
[1:24:44] called to help each other out of the
[1:24:45] snares of the enemy praise
[1:24:48] God in every
[1:24:50] case the devil always says put down your
[1:24:52] sword take off your your Shield you
[1:24:55] don't need that sword put it in your put
[1:24:57] it in your sheath in every single case
[1:25:00] and that's what Satan's trying to do in

[1:25:28] we're with the Lamb of God how many in
[1:25:29] the the Lamb's Army
[1:25:32] today the lamb shall overcome uh that

[1:25:53] armor of God on themselves Hallelujah
[1:25:56] because they know they got a battle
[1:25:58] Hallelujah that's
[1:26:00] right now I read this a few weeks ago
[1:26:03] when on the Wednesday night
[1:26:05] service but brother says he says uh just
[1:26:08] remember these things he says uh he said
[1:26:11] we got tapes on how to uh behave
[1:26:14] ourselves when we come together and sit
[1:26:16] in Heavenly places he said don't stay at
[1:26:18] home if God's in your heart I said this
[1:26:20] on Wednesday too if you you can't hardly
[1:26:22] wait for them doors to open out
[1:26:24] and get in there to fellowship with your
[1:26:26] brothers and sisters if you don't feel
[1:26:29] that way I tell you it's time you got to
[1:26:33] praying hallelujah how many you believe
[1:26:34] that by God's
[1:26:36] grace brother R tells us part of the
[1:26:39] enemy his battle his snare is to get you
[1:26:41] to not want to come see the Brothers and
[1:26:43] Sisters in Christ that's part of it
[1:26:46] Hallelujah because we're in the last
[1:26:48] days and much more as we see that day
[1:26:50] approaching to love one another with
[1:26:52] Christian love and divine love to

[1:26:55] places to love one another all men will
[1:26:58] know you're my disciples when you have
[1:26:59] love for another that's right stay right

[1:27:09] shepherd
[1:27:10] Hallelujah we have Earthly Shepherds as
[1:27:12] well of course we know that but Christ
[1:27:14] is the only powerful one he's the only
[1:27:15] one that's got power and if you think
[1:27:18] your brother or sister's in a little
[1:27:19] wrong say Lord don't let me never take
[1:27:22] the root of bitterness spring up in my
[1:27:23] life because it'll affect him and take
[1:27:26] the Christ right out of my life and
[1:27:28] remember it's not just bitterness I gave
[1:27:29] you all those lists young people now
[1:27:31] most of us here are pretty young by
[1:27:32] God's grace God bless those of us who
[1:27:35] are more more years and more experienced
[1:27:37] Hallelujah but a lot of us are
[1:27:39] influenced we're younger we're
[1:27:40] influenced by some of these social media
[1:27:42] things so you can put anything in there
[1:27:43] not just bitterness but bitterness will
[1:27:46] defile many the Bible says hallelujah
[1:27:49] it's the poison acids of malice jealousy
[1:27:53] hatred that just take the Holy Spirit
[1:27:55] right away from you it will run him from

[1:27:59] spirit of God it'll drive it away from
[1:28:01] here hurt your P it'll do everything
[1:28:03] don't you do that you just wax that much
[1:28:06] closer together take the Buckle he said
[1:28:09] he said the buckle on the whole armor of
[1:28:11] God what's the Buckle it's the mind of
[1:28:13] Truth loins G about with the mind of

[1:28:32] them at the restaurant they're walking
[1:28:33] around and when they're walking the back

[1:28:36] to go up there I just want to pull their
[1:28:37] belt and be like put those put that belt
[1:28:39] on pull up your pants
[1:28:41] man that's what that but see that's what
[1:28:43] happen I know it's funny but that's what
[1:28:45] happens to us spiritually if our minds
[1:28:46] aren't ready we start letting down and
[1:28:49] we just walk around like whatever
[1:28:51] happened happens and we look down on
[1:28:53] those Brothers do that but what about
[1:28:54] our spiritual
[1:28:56] lives it's a good sign to
[1:28:59] us you guys see at high school right
[1:29:02] it's like nobody gave them a belt let me
[1:29:03] know if they need a belt I'll give them
[1:29:04] a belt praise God let me find the
[1:29:06] cheapest belts on uh Amazon we'll give
[1:29:08] them some belts they probably won't wear
[1:29:10] them but let's let's apply that
[1:29:13] spiritually we got to be ready to fight
[1:29:16] the enemy we got to have the truth on we
[1:29:19] got to have our our Shield we got to

[1:29:23] grace
[1:29:26] just pull her on brother tighten up move
[1:29:29] right up close to one another love one
[1:29:31] another anyhow talk nice about one
[1:29:33] another say nice things about one
[1:29:34] another and then God will bless you who
[1:29:36] wants to be blessed I want to be blessed
[1:29:40] I think you do
[1:29:41] too now brother R i' always said now
[1:29:43] this is where I didn't get much time I'm
[1:29:45] trying to close here that's the first
[1:29:47] time I really looked at the clock uh to
[1:29:48] kind of see what time was brother man
[1:29:50] says a wounded or trapped animal is more
[1:29:52] vicious than just animal you see out in
[1:29:55] in in the wild that's true because
[1:29:56] they're hurt and they don't want to be
[1:29:58] hurt
[1:29:59] more and so that's what we see you know
[1:30:01] even in our lives church I'm talking
[1:30:03] about each one of us when we struggle
[1:30:05] when we're battling when we're caught in
[1:30:06] a snare uh that's when evil words will
[1:30:08] come out of our mouth and people will
[1:30:10] notice well we're not as sweet as we
[1:30:11] used to
[1:30:13] be Hallelujah well what's wrong with the
[1:30:16] preacher today he seems like he's little
[1:30:18] angry
[1:30:20] or you can sense it if I've got if I'm
[1:30:22] battling if I've got an evil spirit you
[1:30:23] could it on me like if I'm battling
[1:30:25] something not like I have I'm possessed
[1:30:27] with the evil spirit but I'm just
[1:30:28] battling right so can we do it on each
[1:30:31] one another right we're to judge one
[1:30:34] another and so we see this when people
[1:30:36] are entrapped many times think about all
[1:30:38] these sinners in the world they're all
[1:30:39] trapped in snares and they're just
[1:30:41] attacking one another and don't you see
[1:30:43] it like uh even with with Biden and
[1:30:45] Trump and Cala throughout the whole
[1:30:48] campaign they're fighting they said all
[1:30:50] these words against each other but when
[1:30:51] they get into each other's face it's
[1:30:52] like we make this a real peaceful
[1:30:54] transition here I thought you called me
[1:30:58] Hitler right and vice versa I mean it
[1:31:01] goes both ways man they speak such evil
[1:31:04] things about each
[1:31:06] other but see what is that that's
[1:31:08] hypocrisy that's trapped in a snare
[1:31:11] their hearts are in
[1:31:12] snares
[1:31:14] right they're not they don't have the
[1:31:16] real love of God thank God that we can
[1:31:19] have the real love of God and we can
[1:31:21] draw closer together as we see that day
[1:31:23] approaching
[1:31:25] Hallelujah and so yeah this was a
[1:31:27] thought shared with me too when people
[1:31:29] are hurt and they're in their own traps
[1:31:31] that's when they inflict they try to
[1:31:32] inflict damage on other
[1:31:34] people right they Roar out or like an
[1:31:37] animal if animal's trapped it'll Roar
[1:31:38] out scream out if you try to get close
[1:31:39] to it right and that's how it is when
[1:31:42] people are wounded and and snared of the
[1:31:44] devil in traps of the devil when you
[1:31:46] when you that's why the Bible said you
[1:31:48] got to go in meekness you can't go with
[1:31:50] real Angry got to go in meekness because
[1:31:52] they're hurt and if you go Angry that'll
[1:31:54] just uh anger breeds anger brother R
[1:31:57] said but love breeds love
[1:31:59] Hallelujah love will breed
[1:32:03] love so I would say you know uh we're
[1:32:05] not animals but our fleshly nature is
[1:32:07] very beastly like right it's a very
[1:32:10] Beastly so our our flesh nature our sin
[1:32:12] nature uh is very uh Wicked very we'd
[1:32:15] say very violent right doesn't like to
[1:32:16] be corrected doesn't like uh to to hear
[1:32:20] that it's wrong but we all need
[1:32:21] correction at some time
[1:32:24] H Allelujah I got a couple more things
[1:32:28] here brother Ram said he was up at the
[1:32:30] Cincinnati Zoo in
[1:32:32] 1953 he said I Saw an Eagle just flop
[1:32:35] against his cage he kept beating his
[1:32:38] head he come back again and he'd hit
[1:32:40] against there he'd fly up against the
[1:32:42] top of it and he'd fall down so imagine
[1:32:43] an eagle we see him at aan zoo but
[1:32:46] brother saw went in a cage he kept
[1:32:47] flying up and hitting his head and
[1:32:49] coming back down just over and over and
[1:32:50] over
[1:32:51] again the first thing you know he beat
[1:32:53] beat himself to the feathers was all out
[1:32:55] of him
[1:32:56] nearly and church what do we do
[1:32:58] sometimes we get in traps and we beat up
[1:33:00] ourselves so much or we let the devil
[1:33:02] beat us up so much we don't we lost we
[1:33:04] lost our our joy the eagle lost his
[1:33:07] feathers he don't even look like an
[1:33:07] eagle sometimes they look at our faces
[1:33:09] and be like you don't even look like
[1:33:10] you're happy you don't even look like
[1:33:11] you're saved where's the joy of the Lord
[1:33:13] and the church
[1:33:15] said because you don't have feathers I
[1:33:16] don't see any feathers on anybody today
[1:33:18] so it's not our feathers are going to
[1:33:19] fall out it's our joy it's our Victory
[1:33:22] it's the peace of God in our lives
[1:33:24] it's our kind words to one
[1:33:27] another kept trying to fly but he kept
[1:33:30] beating his head up against the the
[1:33:32] ceiling brother Braham said oh
[1:33:35] God he said he sat down like that and
[1:33:38] his weary eyes rolled up looked around
[1:33:40] so now the Eagle's all weary from all
[1:33:42] this beating he's trying to get free but
[1:33:44] he can't get free he said oh god brother
[1:33:46] man said that's a Heavenly bird he
[1:33:48] Soares in the heavens above he's here
[1:33:51] he's caught he fell into a trap he's abs
[1:33:53] absolutely helpless he can't deliver
[1:33:55] himself how many can say Amen to that
[1:33:57] there's certain things God will let you
[1:33:59] go through you can't get out yourself
[1:34:01] you need someone to rescue you
[1:34:03] Hallelujah you need someone to help you
[1:34:05] recover yourself out of the snare of the
[1:34:08] enemy
[1:34:10] Hallelujah he said he can't deliver
[1:34:12] himself his weary eyes rolling around I
[1:34:14] felt so sorry for him he can't help
[1:34:17] himself now church if you're in a spot
[1:34:18] you can't help yourself you're blessed
[1:34:20] today because there's one person who can
[1:34:22] his name is the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:34:25] Hallelujah there are times we can help
[1:34:27] oursel we know we know what we've done
[1:34:28] wrong but if we've Let It Go on so long
[1:34:30] and we don't know how to get out there's
[1:34:32] a man who can open the cage door
[1:34:33] Hallelujah there's a man that can turn
[1:34:35] on the light there's a man that can set
[1:34:37] you free
[1:34:39] Hallelujah and every man that's fell
[1:34:42] into the snare of the devil is worse off
[1:34:44] than
[1:34:46] him a Christian who's trapped by the
[1:34:48] snares of Satan is worse off than a bird
[1:34:50] that lost an eagle that lost his
[1:34:52] feathers and is all weird we church if
[1:34:54] this life makes us weary it's time to be
[1:34:57] refreshed if you're weary what's the
[1:34:58] Bible saying come aside to The Fountains
[1:35:01] to the rivers of life amen if you're
[1:35:03] weary come by to the streams there
[1:35:06] there's there's flowing there there's
[1:35:07] Mercy in these streams there's still
[1:35:09] waters Hallelujah there's Green Pastures
[1:35:12] there's still waters come aside to the
[1:35:14] great Shepherd Let Jesus refresh your
[1:35:16] spirit praise God you don't have to be
[1:35:19] weary you don't have to be defeated you
[1:35:21] don't have to be trapped or ins snared
[1:35:23] Jesus came to set us
[1:35:26] free so a Christian who's trapped in the
[1:35:29] snares of sin is worse off than an eagle
[1:35:31] who has lost all his feathers and is
[1:35:33] weary from hitting his head against the
[1:35:36] cage but how the devil has caught you
[1:35:39] and caged you up with smoking drinking
[1:35:41] that's not most of us all kinds of
[1:35:43] immoral living and thinking you're
[1:35:45] popular how many people going after
[1:35:47] popularity today thinking you're doing
[1:35:49] something they think they're doing there
[1:35:50] something what are you doing nothing
[1:35:53] what have you accomplished nothing if
[1:35:56] you're doing it for the world you
[1:35:57] haven't accomplished nothing the thing
[1:35:59] is what have we done for God that's the
[1:36:02] question what have we done for God
[1:36:04] that's the most great or horrible sight
[1:36:07] there is to see a poor Eagle beating his
[1:36:09] brains out nearly Against the Cage
[1:36:11] trying to get free and he says and
[1:36:13] you're helpless just as helpless as you
[1:36:16] can be unless somebody puts forth his
[1:36:18] hands and opens the cage I'll tell you
[1:36:21] tonight Jesus Christ has done that in in
[1:36:23] calling you that's right he's opened the
[1:36:25] cage to let you out hallelujah amen
[1:36:28] hallelujah glory to God I'm almost
[1:36:31] done what was the Year of
[1:36:34] Jubilee you shall count seven weeks of
[1:36:36] years seven times seven years so that
[1:36:38] the time of the seven weeks of years
[1:36:40] shall give you 49 years then shall you
[1:36:42] sound the loud trumpet on the 10th day
[1:36:44] of the seventh month Revelation 10:7 the
[1:36:46] freedom of the mysteries of God glory on
[1:36:49] the day of atonement you shall sound the
[1:36:50] trumpet throughout all your land and you
[1:36:52] shall consecrate the 50th year and
[1:36:54] Proclaim Liberty throughout the land to
[1:36:55] all its inhabitants it shall be a
[1:36:58] jubilee for you and each of you shall
[1:37:00] return to his property and each of you
[1:37:01] shall return to his clan that 50th year
[1:37:04] shall be a jubilee for you it shall in
[1:37:07] it you shall neither sow nor reap what
[1:37:10] grows of itself nor gather of the grapes
[1:37:12] from the undressed Vines for it is a
[1:37:14] jubilee it is it shall be holy to you
[1:37:17] you may eat the produce of the field so
[1:37:21] what am I saying today if any of us are
[1:37:23] in any bondage if we're in snares in in
[1:37:26] in sin snares any traps of the devil I'm
[1:37:29] telling you there's Freedom today in the
[1:37:31] name of Jesus Christ in the Old
[1:37:33] Testament they had a trumpet they blow
[1:37:35] every 50 years and when that trumpet
[1:37:37] blew they knew they could go back and
[1:37:39] live how they're supposed to live the
[1:37:41] eagle could go back and get out of the
[1:37:43] cage and live in the heavenlies Like an
[1:37:45] Eagle supposed to live Hallelujah not to
[1:37:48] be fed in the cage a little bit he could
[1:37:50] the eagle could eat to his his heart's
[1:37:52] desire he could fly as high as he wanted
[1:37:54] to because he's free Hallelujah and how
[1:37:56] many know he that the son is made free
[1:37:58] is free indeed Hallelujah the Jubilee
[1:38:01] was restoration your life gets restored
[1:38:04] back to what it was it was Freedom
[1:38:06] you're no longer a slave Hallelujah you
[1:38:09] get rest you get a whole year off from
[1:38:11] work now that's what we all want in the
[1:38:13] natural I get two and a half months
[1:38:15] though every year so thank God for that
[1:38:17] you can get it too just got to go to
[1:38:18] school for five
[1:38:19] years that wasn't very
[1:38:21] fun also you get rest spiritually you
[1:38:24] have rest from your
[1:38:26] battles and then you get Holiness this
[1:38:28] was a year of Holiness unto the
[1:38:31] Lord all this happens when you choose to
[1:38:34] leave the addiction or the the snare or
[1:38:37] the Mind battle the complex all this
[1:38:39] happens you get free and you become like
[1:38:41] the eagle you're supposed to be let's
[1:38:43] stand to our feet by God's
[1:38:46] grace this is what happened to Samson
[1:38:48] and the prodigal musicians can
[1:38:51] come the devil set a snare for for
[1:38:53] Samson it was a sexy woman
[1:38:57] Delilah and just ask him every day
[1:38:59] Samson where's your strength Samson
[1:39:01] where's your strength come lay on my lap
[1:39:02] a little here come live with me come
[1:39:05] sleep here the devil knew exactly what
[1:39:07] would tempt Samson and Samson failed to
[1:39:11] overcome he was ens
[1:39:13] snared but what did God do God brought
[1:39:16] about pain and suffering like we said on
[1:39:19] Wednesday right the man sleeping with
[1:39:21] his stepmom what give him over to Satan
[1:39:23] for the destruction of the flesh that
[1:39:24] the soul might be saved that's what
[1:39:26] happened to Samson plucked out his eyes
[1:39:28] now he's working as a slave on the
[1:39:30] grinding mill day after day after day
[1:39:33] but finally God could isolate him away
[1:39:35] from his sinful desires
[1:39:36] amen and then God could start talking to
[1:39:39] him and remind him you've got the hair
[1:39:41] grown back your covenant's back the
[1:39:44] power will come back and see church he
[1:39:46] could get free when he finally said Lord
[1:39:48] I want the spirit of God back in my life
[1:39:51] I want to be an eagle again I'm tired of
[1:39:53] being cage up I'm tired of the weariness
[1:39:55] I'm tired of banging my head all over
[1:39:57] this cage that I mean I Want to Be Free

[1:40:02] hallelujah that's how a person gets free
