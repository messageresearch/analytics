end this series tonight if possible and kind of see how gideon's life ended so i like to call this uh lessons from gideon's life some lessons that we can learn from gideon's life here tonight okay so now my wife just said is the live stream going to start seeing so yeah you're really just a little behind tonight they had that construction out there whatever happened we saw about three or four car

many great lessons here in the bible don't you just love just combing through the bible just scripture by scripture i just i'm just so blessed by that brother ray said he laurae said sunday's message was the best mother's day message he ever heard that was encouraging to us you know just thankful that uh god could bless each one you know and minister thank you for your prayers for one another too that was really beautiful is everybody praying for one another and loving god and worshiping god and thank you for praying for our mothers and trying to be encouragement to them praise god and the fathers and the soon-to-be mothers by god's grace little ones when they grow up they might be mothers you know so just what a great time in the lord and uh so thankful for god's amazing grace judges chapter eight so as we go into judges eight we start seeing gideon's downfall into what we would we would call a maybe a backslidden condition you would see up to now this man has been just a model of faith but here beginning in verse one we start seeing in verse two and three you start seeing his downfall remember we can learn lessons from even mistakes right how many ever learn lessons from your mistakes yeah even that nature vote as high as i can go to yes we constantly learn oh like next time when this comes again the next time i'll overcome it next time by god's grace and that's what we see in gideon's life remember these people couldn't have the baptism holy ghost like you and i could have so while we while we can understand a little bit about them having struggles we should live a life that's a higher spiritual life than them because remember the least in the kingdom of heaven jesus said is greater than john the baptist that's relationship that's by blood praise god so it's the blood of jesus christ that washes away all our sins takes us out of the power of darkness into the power of god's light in his love judges eight verse one let's just read verse one just for time's sake it's already seven 15. hopefully the live streamers now got it on there by the grace of the world okay yeah my wife just got it hopefully stephanie gets it there soon i just got the email okay all right we'll be looking at the phone hopefully much more unless i got notes on there let's read first one together this first one then we'll have a little word of prayer all three one two three and the man of ephraim said unto him why hast thou served us thus that thou called us us not when thou went us to fight with the midianites and they did chide with him sharply so as soon as he gets this major victory the victory we would think would be impossible as soon as he gets the victory he starts getting rebuked by his brother ever sound familiar god does something in your life god blesses you and then all of a sudden adversity comes right away just had a great testimony now there's adversity the very next moment right yeah that's the life of a believer but you know god's called you this life and how many are going to overcome in this life amen we should expect blessings also expect trials yes and say god give me the grace to go through my trials help me to have the right testimonies let's buy our heads for one more word of prayer if you ever need on your heart let's just make another to the lord i have needs here tonight i'm sure we have many many sick and afflicted out there you know in families and then also just our friends around this nation and even some parts of the world let's remember them father god has come again in the mighty name of jesus we just sang jesus you're greater you're stronger you're a healer hallelujah you're our god hallelujah so lord we know your wisdom is working in every one of these situations we come by the blood of jesus christ tonight forgive our sins or forgive our evil thoughts any evil words any evil actions lord god we are constantly fighting the sinful nature and thank you for the victory that each one could be in the house of god tonight what a victory lord god what a blessing so lord just take our thoughts away from maybe things that wouldn't benefit us here now lord god maybe vain things or things that will take care of themselves tomorrow the lord help us to be caught in the moment here now what the holy spirit is saying to the church help me to get out of your way help me not to put any carnal uh just human thoughts in lord help me to be a yielded surrendered vessel to you god help me to be lord humble and lord each person lord receive a portion of the holy spirit tonight as they pull on the word bless our livestreamers the lord god especially stephanie lord and those we love those in the church livestreaming perhaps brother amen and my wife and maybe brother bang lord god maybe brother jose lord be with him in a special way as he he's on the mend lord god just restore him fully lord with full strength he can be back where he was lord god and father we'll give you all the thanks and praise we surely need your help we surely need your direction guide us now by the holy spirit this night it's important to you lord god this night this service is important so are minister to us in jesus christ's name and everybody said amen amen god bless you your being praise god everybody believe they can learn some good lessons from gideon's life amen you're gonna see you're gonna you might be a little shocked here some other things if you haven't heard gideon's life in a while might be a little shocked to look at some of the things from his life here tonight but i'm sure be a blessing to you so we begin chapter 8 and we see now gideon gets some criticism from his brothers in the lord this is the tribe of ephraim right so now he begins getting criticized every got criticized by another christian oh yeah yeah we all do it right we all get criticized and sometimes if we're honest we criticize other people too we're all guilty another brand member that's the one thing about the brother man battle was a critical spirit and i could say too i battle that also we're just human right sometimes we forget where we come from sometimes we forget what we used to struggle with and also how long we struggled with it right hallelujah yeah you know as austin and i talked about getting the holy ghost i said i got to remind austin you know but awesome it took me almost two and a half three years to get the holy ghost and then my mind goes back all the trials i went through and all the hard times and all the all the doubts and everything i went through and how come god didn't send me america how come god never gave me an angel but i'd be frustrated sometimes how come brother brown got to see angels and i don't i'm praying for him you know just things like just human mind battles you know yeah that we would face and i want to see visions you know i want to i want to hear that i just love to hear the voice of god sometimes that would frustrate me because i hear brother branham oh he got to hear the voice of god you know i didn't get to but you know i i had to learn that the just doesn't live by experiences the just lives by faith amen hallelujah now we thank god for experiences and then we have to have a bible-based experience but the just the righteous ones the ones that love god live by their faith which is the revealed will of god so how many living by that tonight praise god in other words whether i feel it or not i know god's word is true praise god amen and i will act in obedience to the word of god that he's revealed to me amen amen right that's that's this is coming to me right now so maybe this would be fresh here i don't know you know different times we hear people say you got to get baptism after baptism of the holy ghost the different ones we love and then there's other brothers on the internet that say that you get one holy ghost baptism but then many fillings but i just think that's i think that's exalting experience too much because the bible never says that the bible says you get a transformed mind every day and that's the refilling that they're really talking about but some of them actually believe your soul gets a refilling like your soul can leak out the holy spirit imagine that how could your soul have a leak in it it's sealed amen to the day of redemption amen now seals you know that we that men make can leak right they can break but do you think god's seal can break impossible amen hallelujah now the mystery is we have to feed our souls still brother or david says my soul thirsts for the living god so that's that's a little mystery there you know still working on that one by god's grace meditating on that one but the reality of it is is that a believer is sealed and uh he's got to he's got to get uh he's got to have a real we'd say a fresh experience every day so what i mean by that also is that some people will only expect god to move at a big service when a guest preacher's there or you visit another church and they have a special meeting which we love special meetings i love special meetings i'm trying to tell my children not to take that attitude like god can only move at a special meeting god can move tonight praise god we see that a few months ago god can move on wednesday night he could answer prayer the next day amen lord it's just all about god's timing really it's really about god's timing because god doesn't move when we want him to move god moves when he knows it's the best time to move amen that's the point i'm making is that some people live by experience which thank god for experiences they keep us they keep us encouraged as i was praying earlier lord encourage us you know and move them out and encourage it but at the same time i know god is faithful god knows the end from the beginning and so i shouldn't doubt him he's worthy of my song we try to sing that song he's worthy my song no matter whether it's in the good time or the hard time whether he says yes or no or wait he's still worthy of him amen so i gotta i gotta be humble enough to wait make my requests on the goblin and wait and see what god will do about it praise god okay so i just want to lay that i just thought i'd lay it in there i wasn't really expecting to say that but you know let's quickly go over the positives first of gideon's life just brief i'm just going to go real fast be like a machine gun here god often uses the least to do his will so if you if you feel like you're nothing then you're a prime candidate for god to use you amen god shows up david was the least amen gideon was the least in this house hallelujah hallelujah leah was the was not the beloved one right but she had more children than rachel amen she built the house of god right you know just think of that different ones moses had a stuttering problem amen right and god used him to speak those plays and miracles how they speak the word to the people of god amen god often uses those that are despised gideon was brother anderson was a scriptural man he was asking where the miracles were now church we can do that same thing with respect lord i'm in this message lord you've moved before but i want to see more miracles where where's more miracles what that does is it creates a hunger for god it'll make you come to church with more expectation praise god that's the scriptural question right we want to see god move so where's where's scott where the miracles you can ask that respectfully because remember elisha did right he said where's the god of elijah amen hallelujah in other words it's like romans that's calling jesus on the scene of your life how do you want jesus on the scene of your life amen i got five miracles we need right here i want jesus on the scene of our lives amen actually now there's six or seven now with my cousin having kidney cancer and all these things we need jesus on the scene of our lives amen that's why i got to pray even if i don't feel like it i got to pray and be more desperate praise god so i got to get this guy and his feelings and get his thoughts away and i got to get into the channel the mind of god amen also i want to say we have to rid our houses of idols great lessons here we must do that if we want to see all the victories we've got to rid our houses of idols it's a process also you see when you make a sacrifice to confirm something many times god will answer you because he made a sacrifice and asked god that angel to wait so for that sacrifice to be consumed so when you make a sacrifice wait for god to see uh wait wait for god to answer that praise god amen like church many times for me it's giving a sacrifice of money to somebody i know it's going to return sisterhood but i don't know when it's going to return sometimes it returns faster than other times right but it's a sacrifice and i know i'm waiting for god to vindicate right i think we can all relate to that one yeah we help out people financially but we don't always know when the blessing is going to come we don't know what the vindication it might be years down the road years down the road and then finally just at that moment you're not expecting it there it is there it shows up amen how do you praise god so if you make a sacrifice expect god some point he'll back it up and it's okay we learned to prove god's word or test god with a respect because that's what gideon did prove his word in other words go to him in prayer ask him god show me a sign right you did that on numerous occasions at least three occasions he asked god for a sign he tested the lord and he did it now i'm not going to i just kind of slow down i'm not doing that machine gun so i gotta go faster here i just said i was going to do machine gun i didn't do machine gun okay uh we learned god will sometimes break his natural laws to help us learn spiritual laws like the wet and dry fleece god will break a natural log to show you a spiritual law if you ask god you shall receive amen amen hallelujah then god says with faith and the quality of faith not the quantity of people right and we also learned that god doesn't want people to be prideful when he does a miracle right right or else he'll hold off on it or he won't do it or he'll use somebody lesser to do it that's a lesson from gideon god will use a smaller group that's humble than a bigger group that's prideful all right then we also learn faith battles fear and fear remains there but faith will ultimately overcome that hallelujah getting their faith all the way to the same night the same night that he went against the minions he had fear all the way but faith finally got the victory in church don't you know perfect love will cast out all fear praise god hallelujah then we learn god's word as a sword when he speaks like he spoke to those many knights with a dream about gideon and then we also know that our our mouths are a sword as well when we speak god's word amen we saw last week how brokenness makes our life shine praise god being broken before the lord crying before the lord worshiping the lord trusting god in the midst of your hardest tribes that brokenness shines the light of god and it drives the enemy away can you say amen it drives the enemy of discouragement away amen it drives the enemy of fear away it drives the enemy of doubt away praise god amen it drives an enemy of strife that's what minnie and i mean strife division competition criticism it drives that enemy away when you're broken and you're shining your life for jesus and you're standing there with the word saying i'm going to overcome that enemy i'm going to get victory over safety i'm here to fight and i'm here to win by the grace of god amen amen all right now let's look at some lessons here in chapter eight okay i'll try to go faster all right verse one the men of ephraim look at the pride that these men come in god just got rid of the pride with all those what was it uh did you have thirty two thousand you have twenty start with or 30. you start with 32. so with those 31 000 let me do my subtraction 700. there's either fear pride and now the very first thing right after the victim rather than testimony is now pride starting to get back in yeah they say why didn't you call us now the right what would the right answer be for this can anybody know what's the what what should gideon's answer been to this why didn't you call us when you went up against the midnight what would the answer be what's anyone know the answer yeah because god said there's not going to be that many how many gods say 300. wouldn't that be the right answer why don't you call us well god never told me to call you that the right answer but what is gideon answer gideon doesn't answer that so here is we see the first step gideon starts moving out of the will of god at church this applies to all of us when we forget what god has told us to do when we forget what the word says when we just get go back to instead of being real strong in faith we just get back to regular everyday talk we lose we lose that influence that we were under right so he starts losing the influence of the spirit that he's under they tied with them sharply they rebuke why did you call us look at verse 2 he said to them what have i done now in comparison of you is not the gleaning of the grapes of ephraim better than the vintage of ebenezer in other words he's saying weren't you aren't you isn't your tribe way better than my tribe that has nothing to do with it that's not the reason that gideon did that that's not the reason that gideon didn't call them was because your tribe is is greater you guys are way greater we just wanted something to do that's not why so here we see gideon's first step away from walking faithfully with the lord bless you verse 3. now look what he goes on to say god has delivered into your hands the princes of midian orban seed and what was i able to do with the comparison of you see god deliver those princes what could i do in comparison to you you're so great your tribe is so great he's missing the whole point of this he starts matt gideon starts magnifying them pride church what's the first thing that comes in that usually it's pride right you maybe it's not a lust of the flesh thus the eyes just pride so to get these guys calmed down he says you're so great that's called flattery the church said if somebody's mad at you oh just start praising them oh you're so much stronger than me you're so much greater than me that's not the right answer there's none great but god amen amen jesus said there's nobody greater but god now gideon starts pumping them up to get him to calm down that's the wrong thing he did and it was not the right thing to do why didn't you call us well you're so great we just need we're just a little try we just we just needed a little something to do the size of the tribe has nothing to do with it the size of the church has nothing to do with it it's the size of the faith amen [Music] it's the size of dedication it's the size of love it's a sign of humility amen we must be big in humility praise god amen then their anger was well abated toward him in verse three when he had said that oh so when somebody rebukes you flatter them and pump them up and then that will calm them down that's the way to handle it that's not the way to get that right because you're just lying through your teeth church look how quickly we lose the anointing notice i said we because we all fall short of the glory of god amen he just saw he just broke those you know he just jesus broke those pots and the sword of the lord and gideon then he got a couple victories of the sword and then here he forgets all about that and the anointing has left him now we're going to see a lot of the anointing leaves him a lot of the anointing leaves getting in this chapter and let me just say like this church this is why after gideon there was no more rest until i think if i'm not mistaken david's time hundreds years so in other words gideon was god's last chance can i get another leader like joshua god was trying to find another joshua caleb somebody with a heart that had a different spirit somebody that wanted to follow god all the way praise god this was god's last chance before david can i find somebody that will obey everything i say i'll make sure i make sure i give them all the signs they need he gave him 12 signs jersey he gave him twelve thousand lords in other words i'm trying to raise up another justice my last try let me see let me of course god knew but he was given getting that opportunity i'm giving you one more try and let's see if we can turn this people back to their fathers there back to their atmospheric fathers hallelujah amen give him one more try remember he's the fourth judge out of 12. so after him was going to be eight judges that were even worse than getting now what i mean by that gideon was good but you'll see the end of his life was pretty pretty sad if you read the rest of the chapter the end of his life is pretty sad but i say like this he was kind of like a foolish virgin i'll say it like that because in his day who was the real real ones that dedicated and served god with all their hearts joshua who just lived a few hundred years before him right look at verse 4. and gideon came to jordan and passed over he and the 300 men that were with him faint yet pursuing them now you're going to see later there's still about i think it was how many thousands i think it was 12 thousand no there's still fifteen thousand men left a hundred twenty thousand men have already died because of that uh the lights they put up and the shouting and they attacked each other and then gideon's battles 120 000 are already dead there's about 15 000 left and gideon's still going after them yet he's faint he's tired verse 5 and he said unto the men i'm sorry i skipped no i'm sorry verse 5. he said to the men of suck off give i pray you loaves of bread unto the people that follow me for they be faint and i am pursuing after ziba and zao muna kings of minion all right let me see there all right verse 6 and the prince of succoth said are the hands of ziba and zamunda now in thine hand that we should give bread unto thine army in other words we we're not going to give you bread until those guys are dead why because these these guys were jews as well they knew as long as they're still alive they might get the victory and then they might punish us for supporting you right so we've got some jews that are afraid to stand with god's people which is no surprise they're a bunch of idolaters right just like eden's dead israel was filled with idolaters verse seven and gideon said therefore when the lord hath delivered now here's a little prophecy here you still got a little bit of anointing on it had delivered ziva and salva muna into my hand then will i tear your flesh with the thorns of the wilderness and with briars how about that all because they wouldn't give them a little bread does that sound fair no it doesn't remember one time dave was going to do that remember that remember dave was going to kill those men that didn't help him and his people right before he met abigail remember that he said i'm going to go kill him who stopped him abigail and david said my the lord hath kept me from doing a wickedness a great sin in other words gideon starts getting this angry spirit about getting revenge he starts getting really mad like i'm gonna get revenge on them they wouldn't give me any food they wouldn't give me any bread when i come back i'm gonna get the briars out the thorns out and i'm gonna rip your flesh up with him that's what this guy says guess what he does it does that remind you of elisha with the she-bears god's true servant but when they get in the flesh what happens they can make a lot of mistakes right god help us to stay in the spirit praise god god help us to do good to bless those who curse us hallelujah to do good to those who speak evil against us hallelujah pray for those who despitefully use us amen but get him done do that gideon says you mistreat me i'm gonna i'm gonna tear you up when i get back i'm gonna put no look he instead of letting the lord have revenge gideon started getting revenge but the bible says avenge not your sins they said let god avenge you hallelujah amen let god fight your battles amen he can spend all that time and energy praising the lord or doing sacrifice or doing something for the kingdom of god in his day but instead he wanted revenge i'm going to get them back what do you mean you said that about me i'm getting you back that mean he was just fired up like he had anything to do with the victory anyway like it was right like 300 guys really were strong enough to defeat 120 000. see what happens um see what happens when people get a little bit of power see what happens when people some people get a few testimonies that are really powerful if they're not careful they get puffed up like well god must be with me more than everybody else i'll just start prophesying and i'm not i think i know what's right now church notice in this chapter do you ever see gideon get the fleece out again do you ever see gideon go into prayer real sincere prayer the rest of this chapter go ahead and read it you're not going to find it where's all that lord i want to see miracles and lord give me a sign i need i got some fear i said he's got some revenge he said he's got some anger i can't say it like this you got a rage monster can i say it like that he knows what i'm talking about rage monster verse eight and then he went up thence to penuel another group of jews and speaking of them likewise and the men of anyone answered him as the men of suckle off that answer now to his brethren has said we're not giving you any foods and he speak also unto the men of penul saying when i come down in peace i will break down this tower they does more than break down their tower they must have a beautiful tower you know watchmen be on the tower watch them what other night they must have a beautiful tower well gideon does a lot more than break down the tower he kills every man in the city is that is that fair punishment would any judge ever say yes because he didn't give you food yes you can kill go ahead and kill all the men in the city that's not fair at all that's that's called murder but remember didn't it uh didn't saul do the same thing right king saul and they had a three-year family because of that yeah well see that's why god gave them no more rest until david because gideon had this perfect i mean it was laid out perfectly this was the perfect opportunity you defeated 120 000 i mean uh this is national or this is the best tent for a national revival you got a leader who really obeys god and he cut down all the uh his name's hugher i mean of all names he cuts down idols and he cuts down idly uh uh idolatrous grows this is the guy yeah but then his humanity comes back in so fast rather than seeking god and asking god for more than i said lord he never you never see him ask god for anything else in this chapter verse 10. now zeba and zamunda were in car corps and their hosts with them about fifteen thousand men all that were left of the host of the children of the east so see there's only fifteen thousand left for their fellow hundred and twenty thousand men that drew the sword they'd already had a hundred and twenty thousand casualties how many was in akron but last time what was the population factor what was it again 190 190 000 okay so a little less than the city of akron casualties from god's victory not gideon's victory god's victory and giving went up by the way of them that dwell in tents on the east of nova and jog bihay and smoke the host for the host was secure so see now we're now we're seeing gideon's sword right the sword of the lord and now we're seeing what the sword of gideon can this guy fight yes he can fight now he's got confidence i'm a fighter but he takes it too far he doesn't uh he doesn't deal justly with these two groups the men of sukkoth and the man of pen you well it doesn't deal with them justly it's not it's not fair to kill someone if they won't give you some bread yeah right right that's not fair verse 12 and when ziva and zamunda fled he pursued after them and took the two kings and a midian zebra zamunda and just discomforted all the hosts and getting the son of joash returned from battle before the sun was up and caught a young man of the men of sup cloth now remember that first place that returned him down the first place that turned him down he caught one of their young men and inquired of him and he described unto him the princes of so-called and the elders of even three score and seventy men so he finds that man said what are the names of all the leaders in that city and he gave him the names of 70 men so now look church he's got a hit list he's got a list he's going to kill then that's not for me hit list that's what does that sound like it's god any god just because you didn't give me bread just because you're a little afraid now look they were afraid like he was afraid there it is they both were afraid amen at one point like he couldn't see he couldn't have patience with somebody who was battling fear when he used to battle fear ah there it is right there that wasn't my notes see you can people when we get we could become a stuffed shirt brother we become a stuffed shirt we think we're so great but yeah we forget how little we were how humble we were how weak we were without all that god did for us and now we look down on people because they don't have the faith like we have let's not look down on them instead of looking down why don't we raise them up church instead of pushing them down why don't we raise them up praise god can i pray for you can i help you can i do something to raise your faith instead of pushing them down how about can i help you out can i pray for you anything i can do to help you out yeah not at this time though this man was he was starting to lose that he was power starting to go to his head all this power all these victories he started thinking he was really somebody now church remember this man is still in the hall of fame of faith and the church said amen samson's the hall of fame of fame i can't wait to preach on that guy right goodness oh boy i have to like just go go over some of the stories and not be able to read all the stories but it's a reality he's getting victories now with his own sword he's taking the names of the people that wouldn't give him bread because he's going to go kill them he's going to go on a murdering rampage he becomes what we see you you would call this you call him an executioner right let's execute these 40. i got a list though they're all going down today because they wouldn't give us bread because they were just unsure you know who's going to win and didn't join didn't support me see that's like people today if you don't support our church if you don't come to our church you're going to hell that's what people say that's nonsense jesus said if they're not against us they're for us amen by that's what jesus said i say like this we got more people for us than against us amen hallelujah i don't talk about the world i'm talking about the churches you know there's probably more churches for us that are against us praise god amen unless they're hiding something they could be not they could be hiding something from me but the people i come in contact with they don't seem to be against me so much they seem to be for me [Music] now look at that greece four so he gets a list in verse 14. verse 15 and he came unto the men of sukkoth and said behold ziba and zamunda with whom he did upgrade me saying are the hands of sevens i'm going to know thy hand that we should give bread unto thy men that are weary and he took the hours of the city and thorns of the wilderness and briars and with them he taught the men of sukkoth and he beat down the tower of penuel and slew the men of the city he did exactly what he said he was going to do he took the thorns and tore those men up and the one and then the other one he slew does that sound like a we caught a real man of faith that was the manaface failures failure yeah look at verse 18. then said he unto zeba and zamunda what manner of men were they whom he slew at tabor and they answered as thou art so were they each one resembled the children of a king these are really royal men these are really royal men that he slew and he said they were my brethren even the sons of my mother as the lord liveth if he had saved them alive i would not slay you in other words he just wanted to he would have done anything to slay those guys he was so enraged he said if you were to save them alive i would not have killed you this guy was on a murdering murder murdering rampage verse 20 and he said unto jephthah his firstborn up in slavery now look gideon's first born son he says slay these two men right ziva and salmuna but the youth drew not a sword for he feared because he was yet of you see everybody was battling fear praise god everybody was battling fear they've been in slavery seven years amen oppressed seven years then ziva and zalmuda said rise down and phone us for as the man is so is his strength now look they're rebuking gideon to his face by basically mocking his son saying as a man is in other words as gideon is so is his son in other words they're saying they're saying uh gideon is weak like his son because his son won't kill us so what does gideon do he kills him and getting a rose and slew zebra took away the ornaments that were on the camel's necks now that's straight that's interesting right there church camels the camels these midi knights had these ornaments on them that was an ornament of a king that was a rich person's ornament like you're only if you have rich can you decorate your animals you know they have gold on them jewels all these things hanging on their camels well gideon he kills him he's like you know what i'm going to take some spoils of war here did god tell him to do that no but he starts saying look what i've done i deserve some of these you're gonna see later i deserve some of these treatments like i'm somebody special he starts taking things so in other words this is like taking somebody's money right now we never see god forbidding him to do that either but you're going to start singing remember he was prideful with the ephraim you can start seeing some of his mistakes now he's in a rage murdering people and now he starts taking these valuables from the slain kings verse 22 then the men of israel said in the gideon ruled out over us both thou and thy son and thy son's son also for thou has delivered us from the hand of the many nights did you check that out who delivered them huh who delivered them god did yeah but these prideful men are saying you delivered us and gideon never stops them right he believes i did it that'd be like someone was saying well i'm the one that healed your dad when he was sick it was well it was jose's prayer it was it was brother jesse's faith or it was it was your faith it was bang's faith it's god who did it praise god but be a king over us now this is the one time union does make a good statement in this chapter verse 23 gideon said to them i will not rule over here neither shall my son rule over you the lord shall rule you that's the best thing he says in the chat he will not take kingship over them but he does live like a king not church that's what we have to deal with in laodicea right because if not we're if we're not careful we'll get rich and increase with goods have need of nothing and then what then we forget about god right see how this ties i mean this ties in beautifully with our day we can go from one victory to being prideful the next day thinking like we had something to do with it i heard a preacher make an illustration he's like he's like all we are is just tools in god's hand right alls gideon was was like a rake and then the people want to glorify this rank look what the rake did look at my harvest look at these tomatoes i did look look at these celery look at all this broccoli let's make this this rake let's pave it with gold and let's hang it up let's make a memorial to this ring it's not the rake it's the man who used the rake it's not gideon it's god amen hallelujah all god wanted was somebody humble he started out humble but then he got prideful he started flattering the brothers well you're so much greater than that i didn't call you because you're so great and you know you guys do a lot of good stuff you don't have to do anything okay okay i believe that that wasn't it at all just a string of bad decisions one after another isn't it church don't you know when you make one sin if you don't repent it's easier to sin the next time right and then when you're instant you think i can quit are we talking about that i can quit i can quit uh i could quit something but then when you try to quit it's not easy oh i could give this up well it's not always that actually very hard because your your flesh has a dependence on it but also there's spirits in there as well there's spirits controlling you the bible says that's the one good thing he says i will not rule over you but now here's where he makes a very awful mistake verse 24 he takes their money and he doesn't take it for himself but he takes it either to set up some type of religious thing or some type of a memorial or some type of some type of spiritual memorial i guess maybe the best way to say it this is where it makes a big-time mistake it might be a trophy verse 24 and gideon said to them i would desire a request of you that ye would give me every man the earrings of his prey for they had golden earrings because they were ishmaelites and they answered we will willingly give them and they spread a garment and did cast there on every man the earrings of his prey and the weight of the gold earrings that he requested was a thousand and seven hundred shekels of gold beside ornaments and collars and the purple raiment that was on the kings of the midian and beside the chains that were about the camel's neck so look what gideon got gideon got a lot of things here now one one preacher said this was 40 pounds of gold 40 pounds ago how much does that work plus all these purple garments remember lydia was a worker of purple those were royalty oh now you got these nice babylonian garments here all given to who get in what you gonna do with that kid let's see verse 27 and gideon made an e father of and put it in a city even in ophra and all israel went through a whoring after it which thing became a snare unto gideon and to his house now let me say like this church this did not joshua this did not moses this is what aaron did and the church said aaron said where's they said where's moses we don't know where he's at we get bring your earrings any money made he made a gold calf so we have the same thing give me just give me what you got and we'll just make uh e5 e5 was that garment that went on the outside of the high priest and on the e5 they put the urim and thumb this was a very special garment this was the garment of one person the high priest this is the person nature that when they want to know what god wanted they would take that in the prince of god and if the light shined on that then they knew that they got their answer from god in other words this is the person that hears from god so gideon says let's make a ephod now we don't know what he used it for we don't know if he tried to be a priest we don't know but all we know is this became a snare this became a trap of idolatry for gideon and his family did you catch that your sins as parents will ultimately affect your children it just didn't hurt get in and hurt his children as well you're gonna see in the next chapter i will probably preach it but the next chapter one of his sons i think comes along and kills all of his other sons i mean this the effects of these decisions went on for generations church that's why we never put idols in our lives for some reason you want to make this ephod this ephod became an idol and all israel went up a whoring after it kind of like the brass serpent yeah right at one time the bride servant was a health but then it became an idol afterwards oh we worship that worship that where's your back well i'm not really worse but i'm just praying to it but i still worship right still worship just pray to god amen so it almost it seems like it may it also it might be a trophy that he built there in the city or it might be him wanting to be into the priesthood he's associating himself well i'm not i don't want to be a king but you know if you look to me like i'm a judge and like some now he was a judge which means he judged the people but maybe you can look at me a little more like you know i hear the voice of god more than other people everybody see that yeah god did not like that this was the last chance this was the last chance god was going to get pride before david to find a man that could come close to joshua moses in their dedication to god and he just starts faintly one after another afternoon i appreciate getting the victory over faith but then gideon had some failures after that he had some failures see we're all shouting last week when he was getting the victory of the midnights and now we're all thinking god help me not to fall we're all thinking real hard lord help me not to exalt myself help me to let you take vengeance upon my enemies help me not to fight my battles because the battle belongs to the world we're thinking real deep don't you love the word of god this is amazing this is amazing a man who's in the hall of fame of faith it's over samson right as we said samson was in all families what did he do he subdued a nation the bible said yeah he defeated an entire nation with just 299 men then right afterwards he starts letting this victory go to his head well i must be somebody special my goodness god did a miracle through me i kind of deserve that money don't you think man i'm gonna get back at all those people who bad-mouth me on youtube you know i'm gonna get back again i'm gonna condemn them all i'm gonna put a curse on them you know that's kind of like equivalent to today no let god fight our mouths verse 28 thus was midian subdued before the children of israel so that they lifted up their heads no more like lifting up oh god deliver us they finally had peace and the country was in quietness 40 years in the days of gideon so because of the faith that he had they gave them a generation what's 40 years a generation because of his faithfulness in that battle and in those battles god gave them 40 years without bondage and oppression verse 29 and drew about let's get in the son of joash went and dwelt in his own house now here's where we see look at look at look at gideon's behavior now verse 30. and gideon had three score and ten sons of his body begotten did you get how many sons did you have 70 sons do you think that was just one wife that did that she'd have to have lots of triplets no this means before you had what many wives yeah does that remind you of somebody uh david 500 how about solomon see this is before the kings but he was already acting like a king he said i don't want to be a king but he was living like the king i can have as many wives as i want i'm going to take vantage on all my enemies i'm going to kill every one of them yeah i'm going to set up my own e5 i'm going to set up my own worship you know church the bible said it was shiloh you're supposed to worship he set up in his city ophra he set up this ephod so there's something there that he did he caused the people to get their eyes off the priesthood and get it on his city may our worship always be directed towards jesus christ not a preacher not a church not anybody else as great americans as i know in brother brooks's life or sister karen saunders or brother simon has some tremendous miracles the tremendous miracles we've seen here as great as those are none of us deserve any of the credit amen because jesus said without me you can do what not without god getting to do so gideon didn't deliver israel god delivered israel but then gideon started believing it he never corrected them yeah it might have been me it might have been it's a very sobering story isn't it yeah so now he takes now look at verse 31. and it's concubine that was in sheechum she bare him a son whose name he called abimelech now let me look at that name real quick here verse 31. you know what this means father of the king abimelech means father of the king so gideon had many wives and he had a concubine up in sheechum bear him a son he said let's call the son he's the son of the king can you see it he's living like a king although he said the beginning i'm not your king but he's living like one that's like saying i'm not full of pride but they're living in a prideful life i'm not i'm nobody's special but then living like you're the most special person in here i can have as many wives yeah that thought just came back to me remember when they tested for the the 300 remember that what was the test one one one group was sensual they just jumped in the water the other group was more vigilant just watching well the gideon was in the good group well now he's in the central group and the church said the man that cut down the groves is now setting up an ephod and the church said amen but see we can sing that song things i used to do i do them no more things i used to do i do them no more all the things i used to do i do them no more it was a glad day when i was born again hallelujah but gideon could say the things i used to do i do again the things my dad used to do i do it yeah sure there's something about the precious power of the blood of jesus christ there's something about that spirit there's something about that power that will keep you from iniquity amen it'll keep you from going back it'll protect you amen it'll say the hedge about you brother austin amen hallelujah where you won't go back because of god's grace yes amen because we have access to greater promises greater power greater promises amen but austin you'll know i've officially backslid when you see me rushing out of church to go watch the super bowl you'll know i've officially backstage because that's what i used to do when i was a singer but the things i used to do oh i do them no more glory you see me get a cigarette out or a tin out cussing swearing again then you'll know the things that i used to do i'm doing it again but if i don't that means jesus has said a hedge about me praise god and i am more than a conqueror in christ jesus my lord so far it's been going on 20-something years things i used to do i do them no more thank god the things i used to do i do them no more it was a glad day when i was born again let's say praise the lord can we raise them amen that's the difference gideon went back he stopped living his life the name of his name his name was cutting down idols now he started putting them up at least one and all of israel went after that they bowed down and said oh this is where gideon got the victory thank you again for giving us the victory right he didn't stop him it was a snare for him and his family church of you that's what i said lord lord keep me from sinning publicly if i'm in a sin let it just be between me and you lord and maybe a couple other people you know let it be a small group praise god because getting to this public thing and it caused the whole nation to become a to god you imagine they just got delivered from seven years of oppression now history says they started putting up now uh history says we'll get to this history says they basically put up zeus after getting died they put up the statue of zeus which had a different name it was baal something it says it here in the chapter but before that they were secretly worshiping this ephod on gideon's watch but yet god was so gracious he gave him 40 years with no oppression no slavery all because of that those moments those we'd say weeks or months of dedication that gideon had let me know god is very gracious god is so gracious so he calls his son from the concubine abimelech the son of a king his dad wasn't a king but his dad was acting like a king verse 32 and gideon the son of joash died in good old age and was buried in the sepulcher of joash's father in ophra of the abbey israelites and as and it came to pass as soon as his gaze was dead that the children of israel turned again and went ahory after balaam and made baal beareth their god the modern day version of this is zeus and zeus was the father of all the gods he's the one that controls lightning you ever seen a picture of him he's got lightning and got a shirt off and he's just this tough guy well according to the legends he went and had all these adulterous affairs with all these other women gods and now has all these children you know what you know what the marks of his festivals were athletic contests and human sacrifice in other words sports and abortion they have found human skulls and all kinds of remains near altars dedicated to zeus and as soon as gideon died they went out and they set up instead of instead of worshiping god instead of worshiping the real god who delivered them from the midianites they set up idols let me read the baal barath in other words zeus we're going to worship this strong god who controls lightning and we're going to do our sports games and we're going to get up we're going to have abortions and child sacrifice and murders again and they forgot so quickly about the god who delivered them from the midnights and church what does this show us this is how a people lives without joshua this is how people tries to be christians without the baptism of the holy ghost don't you know in churches they let some women have abortions don't you know that they tell it's okay to have abortion bills that's basically abortion birth control for this i didn't read that quote on sunday about mother's day but brother ramsey said birth control is the shame of this nation because he knew it killed babies yeah birth control is the shame and disgrace of america program said yeah that's the real shame and so what am i like oh yeah easter where my wife and i were driving back from church or driving to church remember it's a beautiful day on easter or something i don't know almost been the week after mother's day anyways we saw all these guys on the golf course and we're like it's easter it's it's jesus's resurrection it's mother's day and they're out there golfing with all the guys i'm like what this is the this is the altar of zeus sports i can hit a ball into a little hole and i'm gonna i'm gonna spend four hours doing it and get drunk while i'm doing it and that's gonna be a great time of worship and they're like oh you're such a good golfer it's worship i want to be like tiger woods that'll be like jack nicholas whatever they are it's worship they're they worship at that instead of coming here to worship jesus christ or another church see that so can you see we have a lot of baal berries today athletic worship and human sacrifice worship they're literally fighting for it right they're literally picketing at people's houses for the right to murder right did you see that meme that i don't know if i put that i should think i shared that with austin did i share that meme with you but yeah yeah these people are so they're wicked for the vaccines they said if it saves one life get back vaccinated and now they're like i'll kill you and everyone if i can't murder and take this life i thought the lies were so important see they're just contradicting themselves they're hypocrites amen hypocrites if it just saves one life and yet i thought black lives matter then why are all these black babies getting aborted the fact is all lives matter and if all lives matter why these white babies get aborted see the thing is they love death they love these wicked demon spirits but thank god for the holy spirit that's here today that's rescued us amen that's called us out of darkness and caught us into the kingdom of god's dear son the lord jesus christ amen hallelujah verse 34 and the children of israel remember not the lord their god who had delivered them out of the hands of all their enemies on every side they forgot about that victory over 135 000 midianites they just forgot it oh our our worship should go to athletics our worship should go to these gods of lightning and thunder and war instead of the god who actually delivered them from it verse 35 neither showed they kindness to the house of dru but jupiterville namely gideon according to all the goodness which he had showed unto israel kind of a rough sermon tonight after all those four sermons in a row what faith and now we see how this guy turned out it's tough it's tough to hear that isn't it it's tough to see that i want to start with starts with flattery and pride my goodness see church we've seen this chapter in his violence and in his sensuality he's no longer serving the lord he's serving himself he's not asking god for signs of wisdom he's carrying out his own agenda see but if he would have been faithful he would ask god lord what do you want me to do what do you want me to do with these people that want to make me king what do you want me to do instead of just saying well let's make an e5 all right in each situation church that's what we have to learn to do we have to ask the lord what he wants us to do in each situation this screws church anointing for gifts and miracles does not prove anybody's going the rapture right yeah that's right and on top of this we just got to read matthew 24 put up matthew 24 24. one of the brother rams major revelations in fact one of the greatest revelations i believe brother man ever preached outside of the seals you know he calls that his regular commission there shall rise false anointed ones and false prophets and shall show great signs wonders in so much if it were possible they shall see the very very left anointing just proves god gave that person a gift and they actually followed the directions that god gave them and so god moved that doesn't mean the person is stable right that doesn't mean they're going to be a faithful christian all their days that just means for that one moment they obeyed god but what about the next moment right well what about the next week what about the next year right are they gonna start bending the rules so i can be more sensual or i can flatter people or i can get a little money here i can i can live better than other people so anointings for gifts and miracles doesn't prove right anyone's faithfulness over the long term it only proves what they did in that moment so real success is having the anointing every day of your life for every decision of your life and the church said amen amen that's real anointing church amen the anointing that doesn't leave amen that's the real anointing amen how many miracles did john the baptist do did he have the anointing oh you better believe the other night yeah the spirit of elijah [Music] hallelujah to turn the hearts of the fathers to the children amen to prepare a people for the lord and jesus said there's nothing greater than him outside of outside john the baptist he's the greatest ever born amen yet he's at least in the kingdom of heaven hallelujah isn't that beautiful not the wrath said the anointing just proves god was there not that he approves a person's lifestyle and the greatest example is bailey that guy had the anointing visions dreams all these prophecies right right right right but then he taught you it's okay to commit fornication and if i can't curse them maybe i can get them to fall that was worthy of hell for that he went to hell for that remember remember a few weeks ago other times he would go seek out necromancers and devil worshipers so sometimes he'd pray and seek god other times you get out the candles and make the upside down cross and you know they need to start calling on demons close let's finally close this sermon hebrews 11 32 can we close this thing already brother justice get real intense in here here's 11 32. and what shall i more say for the time with family to tell of gideon and a bear and of samson and of jephthah remember jeff knows one that said if god if you give me this victory whatever i see first i'm going to sacrifice his daughter some people think he did some people think she was just a virgin her whole life she just sacrificed her willingness or her ability to marry and have children i don't know but the fact remains made a very foolish vow to god yeah and of david also and samuel the prophets who through face of new kingdoms so how to get into through faith he subdued kingdoms wrought righteousness obtain promises stop the mouth of lions let's stand to our feet musician can come thanks lydia for taking the kill fever tonight thank you thank you god bless just give a round of applause [Applause] how many love the word of god amen it's phenomenal it is absolutely shocking to see how quickly somebody can go from anointed supernatural to sensual prideful off the word church what did brother ann tell us probably told us when you were under the blood of the sacrifice and you obeyed your covenant brother branham said like abraham god forgave you and then god would write about you and say abraham staggered not at the promise of god through unbelief and the church said amen said that was for every believer right ever so sometime in gideon's life he must at the end after having all those 70 boys how many girls have you had this guy was sensual sometime at the end he said lord you forgive me i have done wrong i have brought this upon the nation i brought this shame upon my family because look he's in the hall of fame of faith how could he be there if he was a murderer the only way he could be there with all that murder was to be forgiven just like moses was a murderer right just like david murdered uriah hallelujah how could they be there but austin how could that man be in the hall of fame of faith because of blood because we have an atonement through the blood but churches don't ever think you're too far that god can't forgive you amen don't ever know don't ever let the devil tell you that god will look at you and you if you say sorry god look and say jesse never staggered the promise of god i'll say hallelujah i remember sometimes i did but the blood doesn't let god remember amen hallelujah i said abraham's staggered nut well yet we can see where he staggered there staggered there sticking there but that's the beauty of forgiveness that's the beauty of grace god doesn't see my mistakes when i confess and say lord you forgive me a church in our day we don't murder people with our swords and guns but sometimes we murder them with our words yeah right amen said that sometimes we don't commit physical adultery or physical fornication but we can commit it right up here yeah jesus said it's the same thing so how many need god's grace in their life amen anger lustful things we all need a church every single person here tonight needs god's grace and guess what just like you did you can one day be in the hall of fame of faith as well and praise god as far as heavenly father we just want to worship you for a few moments lord with this sobering message dear god as i listened this week and read i just couldn't hardly believe what i was reading how can this man i so revere i was gaining so much strength and then lord to see this i was saddened but lord i'm also reminded he lived under a different covenant he lived in a different time so lord we don't look down on him we appreciate the faith that he received to subdue kingdoms and fathers you told us through your son jesus you said remember lot's wife you told us to remember examples when people fell so we're looking back here today to remember lord help us not to flatter people help us not to be prideful help us not to take credit for your victories help us to just say like brother branham i was just there when he did it amen thank you jesus we're just there when you do something and we stand in all what you did lord may we not build again the things that we've destroyed may we not develop bad habits after we've already gotten rid of those habits dear god may we not go back to the beggarly and weak elements as the scripture says [Music] lord thank you for speaking to our hearts tonight lord it's always good to be in the house of the lord and lord let our names one day be in the hall of fame of faith in the new testament even if it's the last one let it be us dear god help us to stagger not at the promise of god help us to confess our sins and keep moving on and growing and appreciating your love and your forgiveness more thank you for the blood of jesus christ that forgives every transgression we thank you for that victory

oh [Music] [Applause] is [Music] [Applause] let us glorify god in our bodies and our spirits which are gods however we'll do it this week amen how many will finish this week and say lord help me to glorify you in my body and in my spirit for they are yours god [Music] let's have a word of prayer here heavenly father we thank you for the victories in our life god thank you for the anointing lord
