TRANSCRIPT
========================================
uh hearty amen ready amen praise god let's take our bibles tonight praise god god bless you let's go to joshua chapter 15 i like to go to the joshua series tonight uh we just had such a wonderful joshua sermon on friday night so i just like to kind of just pick up where i left off here joshua 15 and i think my text is verse 20 if i'm not mistaken here joshua 15 yeah 15 verse 20. hallelujah so i just like to speak on unique boundaries and ministries tonight related to joshua just a real simple thought but i think it'd be helpful and trust me a blessing to you [Music] brother amen you know come up after service on sunday and he's like brother diggs just he hit everything i was praying for you know so i was really thankful to hear the testimonies in church and if you heard a word from god on uh any time the weekend let's keep believing it praise god let's keep confessing it i'm going to keep confessing that that akron is going to know that jesus christ is the same yesterday today and forever praise god hallelujah that's why i still feel like there might be more time until the rapture because this city needs to know praise god and i'll say like this every city needs to know but the message people got to let them know if they got the truth if they got the the mystery of god finished it's their job to let them know so i'm just trusting god to give me time here of course i know the long suffering of lord is salvation the longer goes the more people being saved i know it's getting smaller too but there's still people being saved so we can rejoice in that praise god joshua 15 verse 20 and then we'll read verse 63 15 20 and 63. just give me a moment as i get there here joshua 15 verse 20. so we kind of ended with uh caleb last time and afternoon possessing all the gates of the enemies i believe there was 112 cities mentioned in this chapter and every city had a gate and we saw how each one of us can gates in our lives we went through how paul possessed every gate regate every gate as well praise god and uh just like uh on sunday brother william and i were praying before we went to the both churches we prayed in and we said no man shall stand before us all the days of our life that's got to be our motto now amen whenever we face any obstacle just quote that amen there will shall no man or woman stand before us all the days of our life praise god and that's true no no one has amen so we thank the lord for his word it's his word that overcomes word in us because greater is his word in us than he that's in the world praise god joshua 15 verse 20 and i do apologize stephen did give me a memory verse so i will turn to that briefly as you're at your spot there i've just got so many texts here kind of you know how they get buried and so this one got buried there it is okay okay so let's read joshua 15 verse 20. let's read this together just a very short verse let's read it one two three this is the inheritance of the tribe of the children of judah according to their families now go to verse 63 let's read that one too because i basically preached up to verse 62 is basically what i did i didn't really mention 63 and i realized i didn't mention that but i was listening to the chapter today while driving i'm like oh that's right i didn't preach verse 63 i got to preach that one it's an important chapter i'm sorry important verse rather all right so let's read verse 63 one two three as for the jebusites the inhabitants of jerusalem the children of judah could not drive them out but the jebusites dwell with the children of judah at jerusalem unto this day now we just saw a hundred and twelve gates were were possessed but not every one the majority judah captured the majority of the gates but they did not capture jerusalem if you know your bible if you studied it maybe you remember it maybe you forgot it i forgot it david was the one who actually overcame jerusalem that's why it's called the city of david joshua never conquered jerusalem because it wasn't given to him it was given to the tribe of judah but they never conquered it right until david came 400 years later so it's just amazing to see they possess much of the land but not all of it praise god and there's a purpose for that philippians two verses two and three i thought this was a good one uh this would be steven's memory verse and we'll probably run this for let's see it's already september 8th so probably run this for september maybe october too and then i believe we're at the blands but then the brands may i don't know when they're going back to pennsylvania so i'm not sure so i'll talk to brother johnny about that then for that we're going to our teenagers they're going to give us a memory verse praise god hallelujah if they're baptized filled with the holy ghost then they need to have a scripture on their heart praise god amen they ought to rejoice in that philippians 2 now what's interesting sister naomi is that that he he mentioned stephen mentioned the verses you did last year philippians 4 verses 6 and 7. and he said if that one's already been done he said do this other one i said well yeah that was last year so let's just try a different one so philippians 2 verses 2 and 3. just some beautiful scriptures verse two and verse three let's read this on three what a nice nice portion of scripture here on three one two three fulfill ye my joy that ye be like-minded having the same love being of one accord of one mind let nothing be done through strife or vain glory but in lowliness of mind let each esteem other better than themselves let's have one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's make another unto god let's pray to the god who hears hallelujah he is the god that hears our prayers tonight heavenly father we love you we've read your word lord this word is forever settled in heaven it's the same yesterday today and forever it's yea and amen hallelujah it's unchanging it's unmovable i pray lord god in jesus christ and anoint us tonight let these words be quickened as they were this past weekend bless brother diggs again renew his strength o god thank you lord for the sacrifice he could come surely we heard from heaven lord and we're grateful for the word of god that we heard now lord add to our faith add to our virtue lord whatever whatever lord anointing we're in need of give us further of that lord god in our minds lord for we know if our souls are sealed it's sealed to the day of our redemption but lord our minds need to renew day by day so lord uh inspire our thoughts lord god speak to us tonight and direct us by the holy ghost bless those all that have pressed their way out to the house of god made the sacrifices hallelujah bless them i pray abundantly bless those live-streaming as well lord and we give you all the thanks and praise in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated i'll try to go 45 minutes here see how that goes tonight so we're just inspired and for our live streamers i just want to encourage you you know as we had a prayer meeting before we went live and just showed how the supreme court did uphold texas is a anti-abortion law and so it's been over a week now so think about that over 700 babies likely have been saved maybe eight days now maybe eight days so in the summer there's hundreds of babies now that have been saved because we're praying and not just us some people have been praying for decades church some of those evangelical christians have been praying since the 70s because it was in 1972 when abortion became legal by a five to four vote brother fi it wasn't even unanimous five to four they paid these people off probably to to murder 62 million babies what a shame but the prayer of the saints availeth much praise god remember god can't force anybody to do anything right he can't force these people but when he hears when when our hearts all line up with the will of god god can move mountains praise god when we find ourselves in the will of god so let's keep praying let's keep believing uh uh it's our god wants to hear our voices as a witness against the wickedness praise god he wants to hear our voices and they'll be recorded on that day that we were the ones signing and crying how many know the scripture ezekiel 9 right first peter chapter 2 judgment begins at the house of god amen he begins first here he wants to hear your voice he wants to hear my voice crying out against all the wickedness and god will use that on the day of judgment amen praise god they could switch over i got some slides not a whole lot didn't get a whole lot of uh well i guess i did get i have some leftover i guess from last time so uh so we'll look at this now so let's look at unique boundaries and ministries you know we uh we we didn't get quite to this two sundays ago when we were together here so i'd like to continue uh with some thoughts and i trust there'll be a blessing here to you so we read our text here and we're finishing chapter 15. now look at uh chapter 15 verse 63 again as for the jebusites the inhabitants of jerusalem the children of judah could not drive them out think about that the walls of jericho came down five years earlier right the five kings were defeated by joshua they had these amazing victories ai was defeated by the ambush the mighty ambush right all these mighty victories but for some reason judah could not drive out the jebusites praise god and the bible said that the jebusites then dwelled with them at with the children of jew to add jerusalem unto that day so we know that this falls in in line with three more agency right we let's go back and just rehearse a little bit remember god told joshua god the bible records that joshua did everything god told him to do right now we know that's uh that's not every single thing in joshua's life for example joshua still sinned every day just like you do right and fell short of the glory of god is that right so god kind of summarizes it like like abraham right he staggered not at the promise of god but did abraham stagger yes but the blood forgives him for the staggering amen praise god so we understand josh and remember josh had at least two mistakes right ai he didn't pray before going up and then gibeon he got deceived there so he at least two mistakes so god when he says joshua was obedient in all and drove out all we understand that's for through forgiveness right because not every uh every day did he live sinless wouldn't that be awesome to go a whole day without sinning oh what a what a peace we could have if we could lay down at the end of the day and say thank you lord i didn't think one evil thing all day i didn't say one evil thing i i didn't get i was patient all day oh my that'd be a that'd be a victory for me especially at school with all those a million questions every day and people spilling things all over me and hitting me and knocking things on me you know how silly things are but so we see that's you know kind of like through grace in other words joshua did everything through grace just like david kept all the commands except the one about bathsheba right and uriah of course we know he's sinned constantly right he was constantly sinning but constantly going for grace so did abraham constantly sin he was a man who who was under sin nature right so we see why god allowed this type to be this way israel was never going to drive out all the sin nature can i say like that amen you and i will never drive out all this to nature praise god but the majority of it should be driven out praise god amen it's impossible to drive out all of it right because that would have to be the lord's day then right you need a new land amen you need a new body amen right the lord's day is when man's day is over armageddon so there won't be the lord's day there won't be total dominion until the fire of god comes down amen the total uh fire of god volcanic ash or the atomic fire whatever god uses holy fire to burn all the uh the the outside of the earth right not destroy it but renovate it praise god amen and then we walk out on the ashes of the wicked praise god amen and think even after that there's going to be heathens that are left over there's gonna but they're not gonna sin because there's no tempter amen hallelujah praise god amen what a type so just like judah couldn't drive out everybody church so it is for you and i we can't quite drive out all of our enemies but we thank god for the great victories he's given us and we won't stop fighting until we drive out everything that's possible praise god so god can look at our lives and say williams stagger not at the promise of god amen so god can look at your life in my life in all of our lives and say they didn't stagger they had faith in god they never gave up they were under the blood they were children of faith amen hallelujah just like abraham amen i'll be honest i staggered at the promise of god about abortion right because i just thought well now this never happened well here i stand corrected amen right but by the blood the bible says i staggered none amen because now i'm rejoicing and praying more amen and even tonight we're sighing and crying i was maybe some of you or to praise the lord if not you will sometime right you're sighing and crying for the abominations on the city and that's the sign that the mark of god is on you oh my thank god amen it's so true so it's a beautiful type even judah even praise right judah represents praise right and judah was the ruler the bible remember they prophesied uh israel prophesied over his sons and judah would be the ruler he'd rule over the rest because of christ so judah represents the praise and represents ruling and ultimately the messiah to come so even even judah this great massive tribe with the lion they had the lion banner amen even the lion anointing saints right even them they even not even them couldn't get every single victory paul said i want to do good but evil is right there so and then i do what i hate right he said but thanks be to god who gives us the victory he said oh wretched man i am but thanks god thanks be to god who gives us the victory through our lord jesus christ amen he was looking for a new body he was looking for a more strength he was looking for him he was looking for eternal peace with god amen he's looking for the final victory amen and that victory was death amen hallelujah because death had no sting praise god amen jesus had taken the sting of death right and death was just a doorway to the total victory amen that's right church so we see here it's a beautiful type that many victories will be won in our lives but not all of them like brotherhood says satan will always have a punch on you right but it was even said brother william i'm sure you're aware of this that at 88 years old john wesley said i suffered none of the effects of old age at 88 years old and that reminded me of caleb at 85. church that there so that that proves and we proved that last year when we preached on blessings and cursings remember that all the blessings and curses of the old testament carry over to the new right if you let sin in your house evil is going to happen right if you murder evil things are going to be cursed right if you lie you're going to be cursed and the same thing was true look at that an old testament example caleb he followed god with all of his heart praise god and he was still strong in 85 and here we have john wesley he traveled over 40 000 miles by horse preached thousands and thousands of sermons and here he is with the baptism of the holy ghost at 88 he's just as strong as he was when he was 40 amen because the blessing of god rested on his life and you remember his last words he was dying and he was passing over in the net the next dimension and his last words he said it twice he said the best part of all is god is with us he said it one more time it was as he slipped into death the best part of all is that god is with us amen thank god we just visited the methodist church right and now we know god's with us amen the best part is god is with the revelation of the amen god left the methodist church shortly after that right because they denominated and died 150 years later azusa street revival they had god with them well then the two denominations rose up trinity and oneness right that rose up i'm sorry not trinity it was already there oneness and tongues as evidence rose up after that and then god moved on shortly after that to the ministry of brother branham 1906 and then 1933 both rams started pastoring and 46 he went in the worldwide revival so just look at that you know we'd say about 30 years after right 30 40 years after that initial revival god moved out of those denominations he gave them space to repent but they repented not and then god went into the prophetic ministry of brother branham and here we are today the life of god is with us we've seen it we're witnesses of it right we've seen seven churches the life of god is here as we saw on the weekend the word of god is preaching faith and power the people have genuine joy they have genuine excitement they have genuine trust and genuine faith in god almighty and we have the prince of god with us thank god the best part is christ is here amen hallelujah maybe next time i'll take a video because i can show you that christ is not in some of these denominations he's not in any of them amen uh but the best part is that if we're obedient the blessings of god will follow our lives naturally and spiritually amen that's what he was saying that's what brother dicks were saying on on the weekend god could bless you with a house or a car or something like that but even if he doesn't he'll bless you spiritually for sure because he said every spiritual blessing is given to you and i in christ jesus amen hallelujah and i'll be honest for me i'd rather have the abortion than a bigger house and a nice car right i give me that give me the victory of abortion any day i'll take that praise god but it just depends what you need right and what god has called you to have at that time right so we thank god for his word we thank god for the grace of god now i want you to see this here uh every person makes mistakes right paul we saw it we saw it from scripture paul said i finished my course i've accomplished everything god has asked me to do by grace right but we know he still made some mistakes i found a quote today from 1951 brother and brother bran was giving his life story and he at the end he says oh how many souls did i miss because i didn't go out with the those original invitations from the pentecostals because of his mother-in-law right and remember i showed you as i was with moses in 1958 brotherhood said how many thousands of people did i not pray for because i was misusing my gift see no one's going to be perfect on that day you should say amen to that none of us are going to be able to say you know we did it perfectly or we drove out all the inhabitants but we can say i was more than a conqueror i overcame many obstacles and by the grace of god he helped me to do as much as i could do and i thank god for how he helped me and he gave me grace and i give back to jesus all the glory because of all the strength he gave me praise god amen i believe brother bran is a five-town preacher i believe he doubled his talent praise god because he's the star for the age but yet he looked at his own life and could say i failed and thousands were impacted but think of the millions that were blessed don't forget that they're still being blessed today hallelujah every time you put on a sermon from brother braham and get a blessing hallelujah look we're still getting blessed today amen the truth is still marching on amen hallelujah so see we have to understand that that we're all going to fall short of the glory of god and we're not going to drive out absolutely everything in our lives we're still going to have battles okay but i want to remind you too that there was three kinds of christians remember that chart i showed you there were some that were a 30-fold so they multiplied times 30. there were some that were 60 fold they multiplied times 60 or there are some that were 100 fold they multiplied times a hundred we saw this year we planted some uh potatoes and man there was a major harvest we had 90 pounds of potatoes at our house talk about mashed potatoes coming up brother we're gonna have some mashed potatoes we invite you guys over i have to talk to my wife about that but last year we planted them we didn't get that kind of return see every siege is a little different praise god and also like the brother said it depends on what kind of conditions you put it in depends if it gets enough water right sometimes the season so that's how our lives are right if we invest in and we really treat that seed word of god if we really water that seed amen and keep it in the sunlight of god's knowledge it will produce graciously amen it'll multiply abundantly but part of the part of it is dna part of it is the c dna and then part of it is the conditions praise god that nature versus nurture argument right but it needs both in church the word of god needs both of ours the bible said we must mix the word with faith amen israel couldn't inherit many blessings because they didn't mix it with faith they didn't have the human element god help us to surrender the human element to be diligent with the word to water the word with praise and see a multiplication of blessings amen hallelujah thank the lord that's what i think we'll see through the book brother if we can get that book to enough people think about the multiplication of just solid rock foundation it would do to them right think about what to do it would it would uh get out all it would keep them from false doctrines like on the seals or on the return ministry or all kinds of things like that it would take him away from that and it will point them right to thus saith the lord praise god oh church remember brother said many times we don't know the impact of our testimony we may not know it till over there ah help us to labor for the master from the dawn till setting sun amen and talk of all his wondrous love and care amen and when the rose called up yonder we'll be there praise god amen so see we must labor but everyone's going to fall short no one's going to possess all the land but remember church like i want to mention this too can i say it like this but thank god we're in the land there was a there was two and a half tribes that purposely chose to stay out of the land because they like the land outside on the uh the the north the east of the river jordan they liked that land better than the promised land it was safer less battles oh but that wasn't the faith of caleb amen that wasn't the face of joshua praise god in fact church those two and a half tribes type out the foolish virgin don't they they went in the land they fought they helped out the bride but they chose to live outside on purpose hallelujah didn't remember when 12 spies went in the land they went in the land that's like what paul said but paul said they tasted of it but then they didn't stay in it amen oh but thank god church we may fail we may not drive out everybody but thank god we're living in the word of god amen the word for this day hallelujah that we have crossed over in to the baptism of the holy ghost we're not staying in sanctification we've got a place we've got a permanent residence in christ amen in christ the word praise god that's where we have a permanent residence and god always gives you your choice i've heard this said before that you can have anything in life you want but not everything that's true you can have anything in life but you can't have everything so what do we have to choose we've got to choose christ choose the thing in other words say the thing i want most is to know i'm born again and living in the land and overcoming and fighting this battle in the army of the lord that's what i want most in life so that's what i want to get amen if you miss everything else that's fine you got the most important thing amen you had your priorities first you sought first the kingdom of god and his righteousness and now everything else will be added unto you amen so we have to choose church to be in the promised land praise god it's a choice all those people that will come up as foolish version of the white or white throne judgment they're all going it's gonna be played before him on a screen how they had a chance to hear it those preachers we visited they're gonna have a chance they're gonna they're gonna show it if the brothers even opened it or just threw it away they're gonna show it we're gonna watch it brother they're going to show us right there singing and praising the lord and turning down their communion because they were you should have saw they had communion they're just they're just all laughing just like brother man talked about they were all laughing going up to take communion this should be the most sacred thing in the church and they're like you guys want to go i'm like no no thanks nothing and i whispered at brother william i said it's just not it's just not sincere i said it's just like brother branham said popping chewing gum going up to the altar laughing and joking that's what it was i saw them laughing going up to take communion church that's not how we take communion communion is fellowship communion is examining yourself and talking to god saying god have mercy on me and help me god to live the blessing of this help me to really represent a christian amen it's not a joke it's not a comedy club that's sometimes what churches feel like it's not a comedy club but it's a judgment seat it's a courtroom praise god amen where you get the right judgment you hear the the judgments of the king of kings amen you like brother dick said the advocate he reminded us of the advocate he's a helper she does something we can't do we get to hear the decisions of the advocate amen what jesus says about us what jesus promises to us amen how he fights for us and he's our high priest he's our mediator he's the one standing in the gap for us he will lead us all the way amen oh glory now i got numerous thoughts here she got about half hour let me uh let me start with this here and i don't think i have a slide on this no i don't think i do yeah i you know let me uh let's see maybe i'll just get into paul's life here let me see i had so many different thoughts i wasn't quite sure which direction i like to take it okay yeah let's go with paul's life here okay we'll just yeah we'll try to look at paul here tonight by god's grace okay chapter 16. now here's the outline the church we're not going to read most of this okay it's a very short chapter chapter 16 is a very short chapter verses one to four show the general borders of the sons of joseph ephraim and manasseh the ones that were inside the promised land not the the two and a half that were out right and then verses five to nine is the borders of the ephraimites now look at verse 10 go to 16 verse 10. this directly applies with what we were just preaching earlier that we're not going to be able to possess everything right we'll never we still have to live in this pest house brother branham says right uh joshua 16 10. do you see a pattern here church i hope you're seeing a pattern oh look look every tribe there's no tribe that possessed every part of the land there's no holy ghost christian who gets everything perfect in life let me say that again there's no message believer who gets everything perfect in life that ought to make somebody happy right joshua 16 verse 10 and they drave not out ephraimites and they drained that out the canaanites that dwell in gazir but the canaanites dwell among the ephraimites unto this day and serve under tribute so sometimes brother william we allow sin in our lives to make because it gives us a little bit of monetary gain right sometimes holy ghost-filled people will make certain deals or live a little more comfortable than they should they should drive out that selfishness they should possess the gate of selfishness and give more alms and the church said but they let that little selfishness hang in there because it's a financial gain they hear about the brother who needs something but they just oh well god will provide somehow well that was you that was supposed to provide you should have drove out the canaanites praise god so see everyone it goes and now you'll see this pattern all through the rest of the book of joshua through chapter 24. it lists all the tribes but then it always says they failed to drive out this they failed to drive out that as much as you love our church and as much as my children i love our church we're not perfect i'm not perfect i'm going to fall short of the glory sometime i'm going to miss you every day i fall short of the glory you're going to look at me and say well he probably made the wrong decision there you're probably right i'm not going to be perfect i'm not going to drive everything out but i'm hoping at some point i can drive out the major things the most important things i can drive them out and be more than a conqueror and be a real victor a real warrior in the army of god amen i know already there's many things god has helped me to drive out of my life that i see other christians don't drive out i could name a few things here but like sports right or entertainment god has helped me drive out those temptations right money as well riches and things like that god has helped me to drive out selfishness amen and you know the ones that you've driven out that you can see message people maybe haven't driven that out so the thing is not to be critical but to realize lord i'm gonna need your help to drive out more out of my life i'll never have it totally gone until i get a new land hey hallelujah i get a new body praise god but help me to drive out help me to possess all the promises of god for they are yes and amen hallelujah now that's verse 10. so see church remember they had all this land but the the green was not yet possessed but this was all theirs this was all theirs but they didn't possess everything they had so much land there there was so much potential can i say this there's so much potential for you amen children there's so much potential in your lives amen if you really get a warrior's mindset amen if you really get dedicated to the lord god you'll drive out so much land or so many enemies out of your land you'll possess so many gates praise god you have such victory people want to be like you amen hallelujah thank god but it's it's all up to you we're going to see that later in chapter 18. there's a powerful story where the manasseh comes up one of joseph's sons and they're like give us more land and josh was like why don't wh what do you mean you already have all this land he said i know but he said a lot of them have iron chariots on it and joshua's like drive him out right so they're see they got comfortable they've been in the land five or seven years and they got comfortable and they didn't want to fight like they did at the beginning amen god help us to fight no like we did when we first got the holy ghost amen not not quit and not make excuses but if it's ours to possess let's do something about it let's be conquerors let's have some victories let's bring a testimony to church amen hallelujah and i shared with you my testimony tonight praise god amen god has to encourage me and god is faithful to hear our prayers amen remember you don't have to do whatever you say church that's what i was trying to balance out remember on sunday when i came up here you can speak whatever you want but you better make sure it's god's word first whether you're speaking a house or car children health whatever you're speaking make sure it's god's word first because if not it's just your hopes that's okay hope is good hope faith are good but charity is better love of god is better the love of god the will of god is best amen so make sure we're speaking by revelation amen all right so see we we see the unique borders in verses one through nine and in verse 10 as i already said we see the type of enjoying financial gains of compromise you knew you should have given but i'll let that one stay so i can get some some financial blessing off that one most of all the thing i think it is is mostly offerings and alms most people pay their tithes in the message or else we wouldn't have churches right but the sin i see amongst people is they don't pay any offerings and they don't pay or they don't give alms to the poor they just say oh they're not believers i'm not going to worry about them no you should worry about them you should do anything you can to help out a poor person that's what the bible says if you see them and meet them and don't do anything for them your faith is really struggling james will he might even argue and say your faith is dead i think that's what he would say right because that's what the bible says so see i believe holy ghost filled message people can do that too they can compromise for financial gain because they're trusting in some money rather than the word of god i think we've all seen that i think if we're honest with ourselves now so verses 1 to 10 are the unique borders and it's the borders of ephraim let's just look at verse six okay let's just for an example verse six sixteen verse six and the border went out toward the sea to mitch metha on the north side but and the border went out eastward unto tai nath shiloh and passed it on the east by uh jan ha genoha and it went down from genoha to atorath and to nara and come to jericho and out to jordan so see it chases it from the sea over to jericho so here if we can get there from the sea over to jericho ah where's jericho every map changes a little bit there's jericho okay he's giving us the the land here of the e for mines so it's showing their borders and notice everyone was a little different right every border was unique there was no cookie-cutter borders so you could have holy ghost-filled people in the land but everybody's ministry was a little unique none of the borders were exactly the same because god likes variety amen hallelujah praise god amen that's why aren't you glad there's different kinds of preachers aren't you glad they're not all like me oh man we'd be really sad thank god there's some like brother diggs and brother cam and brother brooks and all the brothers that brother randy each one has a different gift right each one has a unique kind of ministry but they're all needed they're all part of the land they're all victors they all give us strength they all feed our souls they all edify us strengthen us and they establish us in the faith that's what the bible said paul went around brother establishing them that means making them stronger amen i come here tonight to make you guys stronger amen i'm here tonight and you're going to make me stronger right because we we encourage each other in love so while i strengthen you you strengthen me we're here to get stronger not to die get weaker not to give up and compromise but to keep driving out the canaanites amen praise god that's what real soldiers of the cross do praise god they strengthen them so they can go back to the battle and say hey you know what i am i'm not done fighting that i'm going to go back to that i'm not going to quit amen i've got more strength i've got more encouragement praise god i'm going to go back and say i'm sorry amen and i'm going to drive out that guilt amen i'm going to drive out that unbelief or that fear that i had i'm going to go back and humble myself and that's really winning the victory praise god not letting that devil of guilt right and fear am i going to lose a reward or what's going to happen on judgment day oh no i'm going to take the sword of the word of god and cut through every enemy until i get back to my sincerity amen praise god i'm not going to retreat and sit at home and do nothing about it i'm going to fight the enemy off see church this is a great a great beautiful type that we have here in the scripture now so let's see these you know these unique rather unique borders type the unique ministries of the new testament saints and there's none better to start with than saint paul because if anybody had the holy ghost it was that guy he used to blaspheme jesus he used to put his word for people to be martyred uh for jesus he tried to get people to to lie and defy jesus but then he comes on the other side now he's begging them to accept jesus amen and then he gives his life for jesus amen hallelujah he said i'm willing to be bound think about that brother william he never even he never even fought against the chains i'm willing to go bound to jerusalem to die for i'm sorry to rome to die for the one who died for me amen hallelujah that's a real man of god right there saint paul everybody knew he was a a resurrected believer he was dead but now he's alive he did not fear death hallelujah now let's look at paul here tonight i think it'd be good just to look at paul now church paul had all preaching gifts i believe i can prove this by the bible and the message i believe i can i believe he had all five preaching gifts that wouldn't surprise anybody because brother branham said martin luther had all nine gifts of the spirit right so if you can have all nine gifts the gifts couldn't you have all five preaching gifts yes because there's a thing called times and seasons hallelujah there's this thing in scripture called a time a convenient season there's a time glory for everything under the sun amen for every need there's some time of your life for that need to be played out and for that need to be met praise god under the sun there's a time for everything there's a time to overcome there's a time to be humbled there's a time to be strengthened there's a time to be victorious right there's a time to fail there's a time to do all these there's time to do outreach there's time to raise the children amen there's a time for everything if you just place everything in those nail scarred hands he'll make sure he lines up everything to make sure you can do all or you've done all that god's called you to do amen remember there's people that lose their reward well that means there's people that don't lose their reward right jesus said to the church ages he said be careful that no man take your crime well that means somebody could take your crown if you don't take your responsibility somebody could take yours but it also means i can take mine and i can do what god's called me to do and i can rule as a kingdom priest when others don't i can be a king and priest praise god i can fulfill my role as as christ has called me to do and i can and i can win the crown when the battle is over we'll wear a crown in the new jerusalem praise god i didn't lose the crown but i gained it hallelujah by obeying what the holy spirit told me to do in church i'll say it like this i'll go to heaven like this i've never heard a voice of the holy spirit audible and i may have to go to heaven as that that type of witness but i heard the holy spirit in here like moses the bible said it came upon moses's heart he felt it upon his heart to visit the children of israel amen how did of course he saw visions and he saw he heard the voice of god he speak he spoke lift the ear with god but also that leaves room for you and i if we don't hear visions if we don't see these things that's fine as long as we hear the word in our souls amen that's the most important thing that still small voice amen surrendering to that leading of the holy spirit praise god amen i'll go to heaven as a witness to that i never had jesus visit me in a physical body although i love that i pray that many times this week i was looking out the windows looking i wonder i think i was on sunday night i was like lord i would love to see an angel tonight that was really sincere i was like lord i'm up washing dishes a little late you know i don't know that i'm saturday night that's certainly i said lord i'd love to see an angel so i'm just keeping out there i keep looking out there but maybe if i never see it that's fine because i've heard it in here i've heard the voice of god in here the pull i felt the pull praise god amen uh the bible said you got the unction from the holy one there it is amen how did you felt the unction you felt the leading you felt the inspiration to follow god's word amen and that makes all the difference for every time and every season of your life now let me try to prove this to you that paul had all five preaching gifts and you you can frequently rotate between them now this was true for brother branham brother brand thought he was the old testament prophet remember the holy spirit corrected him and said no you're an apostolic prophet and you have many gifts that angel told him and that's what you can see in brother adam's life he transitioned from pastor to evangelists but yet he was prophet all throughout that time too when he would speak thus saith the lord and prophesy now he step in the prophet roll and then he said now i'm going to teach on the church ages amen now i'm going to sit down and teach on the seven seals that's what he said praise god and then he was missionary going overseas to where there was no message churches right preaching the gospel showing the signs wonders and miracles so you can easily see it through brother branham's ministry if we just look and humble ourselves a little bit right and then look to the scripture to see how paul did it okay get your bibles here we'll probably just spend our time got about 10 minutes on this here let's see how many of these do i have one two three that first thessalonians four no okay we don't have to do that yeah well maybe we will okay lydia malcolm got your bible in case you can you read something okay paul was truly an apostle and the church said now he says both he says to this struck me years ago i'm like paul had to have more than one gift people people use the quotes from brother branham where they say oh you can only have one gift and don't don't leave your gift well they also forget the other quotes that brother brahm said he was constantly learning as well right where he said martin luther could have all nine gifts of the holy spirit abraham said women can have any of the nine gifts of the holy spirit any so this one verse has two of the five in it so you can't say you can only have one gift you can't say that whereunto i am ordained a preacher an apostle i speak the truth in christ and lie not a what a teacher of the gentiles so he's an apostle but once he got new converse what do you got to do to babies you got to teach him got to feed him right got to nurse him gotta give him food solids eventually once you get new converse now you're no longer apostle now you're the teacher amen praise god i teach the gentiles i instruct them in the truth of god now here's where paul is the uh the evangelist right here acts 15 36 do i have that up there yeah evangelist acts 15 36 uh lydia get first thessalonians 4 15 through 18. that's where he's prophet but let's read this one acts 15 36 and after some days paul said unto barnabas let us go again there it is again they're already believers and visit our brethren every city where we have preached the word of god and see how they do they weren't they weren't going to win new souls and now they might but that wasn't their goal their goal was to visit again the believers and stir them up the bible said in one verse he had actually established them in the faith paul went around establishing the churches that means strengthening let's look that up i got my uh concordance here real quick he and if you guys find it just shout it out here where's the scripture where in acts he established the saints i'll find it pretty soon here i just want you to see it so you got it yeah 16 verse 5 acts 16 verse 5. verse 4 says as they went through the cities they delivered the decrees for them to keep and were ordained that were ordained of the apostles and elders which were jerusalem and so the churches were established in the faith and increased in number daily amen how many believe apostle paul was an evangelist as well that's what the bible says he did the actual work of an evangelist he went back to establish churches and edified them or he established them in the truth all right now lydia do the a prophet one uh the rapture paul foretold the rapture not only here but also in first corinthians 15 right so lydia thursday amen remember verse 15 what does it say this we speak by the word of paul no this we speak by the word of the lord and this is it shall happen shout voice trump it shall this is foretelling the future this is prophecy this is thus saith the lord you'd be surprised some of the preachers that left the message they don't believe paul was a prophet like are you serious and they think they're so smart and they mock brother branham and you can't see a prophecy in the rapture then you're stone blind right then you now have received the reprobate mind because he foretold that event he foretold the falling away he throwed the deception he foretold the antichrist oh here comes amen this prophet just pouring out all these prophecy after prophecy because he was a prophet he foretold the future in the name of the lord so we know he's an apostle prophet teacher evangelist as well what's the last one well i'm sorry here's another one i'm sorry here's another one for evangelist and he went through the syrian sicilia confirming the churches that means to establish strengthen more to render more firms right making them stronger in the faith that's why he went to the church you ever seen a tree that's kind of like not strong it's getting blown over by the wind we see that at our house all the time what do you got to do you got to put a stake in the ground and then tie that tree up that's what paul was doing paul was going around putting stakes here promises in the word you just hang on to this promise amen hallelujah i'm gonna tie your soul to the promise of god amen and i'll make you stronger it'll strengthen you so you don't get blown over your life doesn't get you're not a castaway you're not left behind but you get stronger in the faith amen that was part of an evangelist ministry to make them more strong more firm in the faith praise god now here's the pastor scripture right yeah uh 20 acts 20 verse 31 and i got a quote for this so people can't say that there's no quote so i've got scripture for the four and i got a quote for the fifth and i'll say like this i believe i have scripture for the fifth as well therefore watch and remember that by the space of three years i cease not to warn everyone night and day with tears now remember earlier in this chapter what was he saying he was saying feed the flock of god right because there's wolves going to come in that are not going to they're not going to they're not gonna care they're gonna scatter the flock and men of perverse minds will rise up among you right so what is he concerned he's concerned about the sheep the shepherd is concerned for the sheep amen for three years he fed their souls for 15 years god has had me feed the souls of these people it's been a blessing we've been feeding on sheep food amen growing stronger maturing drinking from still waters eating from green pastures amen hallelujah and we're not getting weaker compromising you know believing in return ministry or the joseph ministry or something like that or polygamy or something like that we're not compromising we're actually getting stronger in the word of god we're not compromising and if you think i'm compromising then come talk to me and tell me what you want to talk about so i can prepare my quotes and scriptures amen because we're going to have a scriptural debate hey man which is good it's a kind that's a kind thing to do you've seen me do it i can do it with a smile i can debate with a smile it's gotta fast and pray now that's already eight o'clock so let me try to finish here now here's where brother adam says an apostle is higher than a prophet now how many message believers believe this brother william very few because they say who's who's got more authority than brother branham right i understand what they're saying but they they don't understand the scripture there's no higher authority than thus saith the lord but in the makeup of the fivefold ministry the apostle has a higher calling than a prophet why can't they understand that because they're idol worshipers many of them brother ram's the highest nobody's higher than a prophet no well nobody's hiring the prophet for interpreting the word with thus saith the lord or prophesying with us saith the lord but in the apostolic church one person's higher the man who leaves everything behind and jesus said if you left family or mother or father or children or wife for my sake you have a hundred fold in this life and in the world to come amen amen and amen that apostle may never prophesy one thing but yet he's got a higher calling than the prophet but as far as thus saith the lord of course no one has a higher word than a prophet but in local order of the church nobody's higher than the apostle as the fightful ministry does everybody understand he's talking about judas right we ridicule judas we say he's filthy bad guy he's not fit for no place or no society isn't fit for heaven why he sold his lord after the opportunity to even be a disciple to be an apostle the highest calling in the bible higher than what higher than a they can't swallow that one they'll just say oh i just believe every words thus saith the lord because that's what they tell me they have no answer for that one but that's what the prophet said and that's how the prophet believed it the apostle has the highest calling in the bible and the prophet is shortly after that right that's the right could be yep that's what we're saying if there's a major prophet like the seven church age messengers that's so they have thus saith the lord for that generation that age right and that thus saith the lord is above all right that's right but the highest calling right in the local i'm sorry the fivefold ministry on earth would be the apostle now what's interesting is a lot of these guys were apostles right paul was an apostle and prophet brother branham was an apostle and prophet and prophet so you have to kind of look at each one that's a great statement you have to look at each situation right but see people can't ex people can't swallow this because they've got their own man-made con ideas and doctrines but you and i believe the word paul was a pastor in a season of his life remember apollos was also a pastor in ephesus and brother branham said timothy was pastor in ephesus after paul left that's what brother branham said the first church a started around 53 a.d when paul established the church in ephesus so he established that means he's the apostle on his missionary journey established church of ephesus the ephesian church and was the pastor of it until he was beheaded in 66 making him about 22 years the pastor of the ephesian church well now the bible said he was there three years so i don't know i'm not sure but the bible says three years so see see how they'll fight the death he was there 22 years because the prophet said it well the bible said he was only there three years so who are you going to believe well the bible because brother abraham said take everything i say back to the word he said prove all things by the word he said be very careful what you're listening at and if i get something wrong he said look in the bible amen oh yes yes yes that's it here it is brother so he says this in the series in december 60 but then the church age book he corrects it paul who found the true faith of the city pastored here only about three years oh no no it's 22. it's thus saith the lord you liar what's the bible say the bible says three years amen so there's a small season of life three years he could sit down and every sunday can you imagine brother sitting under the apostle paul every sunday for three years and say no thank god feed my soul pastor thank you that's grand and then sometimes he's slipping that profit roll and he said don't be discouraged let me comfort you there should come a day when the bible says there will become a shout voice and trump and the dead in christ shall rise first amen and sometimes he'd warn him about the antichrist he'd say thus saith the lord the antichrist will sit in the jewish temple of god claiming that he is god thus saith the lord and they slip back into pastor mode now little children be tender hearted grieve not the holy spirit of god whereby your seal to the day of your redemption he break down into each role praise and then after maybe maybe after three years he'd say well i'll go on a little evangelist trip now i'm gonna go back and see all the other churches that we were at i'll be right back praise god see he would rotate back and forth right between different ministries with different people now we'll get to this one next time we'll look at the sisters sisters have a very unique their borders are so unique most people just think they're cut and dry sister has to stay at home right sister can't say anything about the word to a man no that's only her husband when her husband has disobeyed the word right but then the bible says sarah told abraham what to do and abraham went back lord is that right yes hearken to sarah see oh such unique borders it's not all cut and dry like every like some people make it out to be we must diligently search the scriptures and we must really find the new testament borders that we're supposed to live under and make sure we drive out all the inhabitants of the land let me close with this see paul had all five preaching gifts each ministry was unique for a time and season of life see church pastors can evangelize for a season but they ought not to collect ties if they're going to be out for a long season because they're not feeding the local church anymore right that's exactly what the word of god says there's times and seasons for three years right pastor how long would it take paul to travel all the churches he visited maybe six months a year there's a season for that but you have to recognize when god is changing the season church i hope there's a season where i can go out and be a evangelist i hope there's a season but we need a pastor first and god will raise them up at the right time i trust i'm not saying there will be but i hope oh there's a season where i can be a missionary full-time that would be awesome my wife and i are traveling on planes together all the kids are growing up and malachi and eye hunter preaching or something like that i'm just joking but no pressure all the guys get the pressure for preaching anyway but i'm hoping by god's grace i can have seasons in my life because i desire to do something like that and church i want you to notice this too paul possessed all the spiritual land for his life he was faithful in his preaching he was faithful in his singleness his relationships he never married he said i have the gift not to burn can you imagine that the gift not to burn so he's faithful with the word faithful with relationships he was faithful with his occupation of making tents i imagine nobody made a tent like paul and i hope it's said about me there's nobody that teaches first grade like mr smith i hope it can be said like that nobody's quite like him he's got a unique ministry he really a unique gift oh i hope it can be said like that and i believe it could by god's grace not that i'm better than anybody but i just have a different way to do it that helps the kids and then what else would think all the other things he was faithful with so job relationship ministry in each area he was faithful with all of those so when he come to the end of this road he said i know there's a crown waiting for me i know he's going to say well done i finished my course and church look at that he finished remember in the last few years of his life remember from 64 to 66 he wrote philippians and then ii timothy isn't it amazing brother william in brother brahms last two years of his life glory in paul's last two years of his life he finished all the things that he had to do amen in brother branham's last two years of his life he preaches the seals marriage and divorce anoint the ones in the end times he nails down these major revelations and says thus saith the lord amen and he could go to heaven knowing he finished the mysteries of god amen in the last two years look at that isn't that beautiful the alpha and omega prophets in the last two years of their life finish everything and they can go to heaven saying i fought a good fight i finished the course let's stand to our feet hallelujah musicians can come here maybe lord willing on sunday i want to get into adoption and we'll look at the sisters as well how many know romans 8 15 says if you're born again you already have the spirit of adoption how many know the bible says that you can stop the livestream here god bless all the livestreamers my family we pray for you tonight be healed in jesus name
