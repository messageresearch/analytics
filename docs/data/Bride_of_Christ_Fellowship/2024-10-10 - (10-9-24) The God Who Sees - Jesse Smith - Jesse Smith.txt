========================================

preaches a general uh brother ram calls him an Evangelical sermon here tonight Genesis 16 verse three we'll just read one verse have you be seated tonight just want to try to give a word of encouragement as we go through trials as we see the world in Trials the world in shambles we know it's birth pains you know a precious friend texted me today and said are we in the beginning of the tribulation I said no we're not uh these are birth pains getting ready for the tribulation uh the Bible said there the tribulation will be such a time there's never been like it and never will be there's been hurricanes before there's been earthquakes before much more devastating uh but these are birth pains they seem to be happening more right just like with birth more as that time approaches but God is faithful God is gracious Hallelujah so Genesis 16 verse 13 Genesis 1613 of course we're going to look at we start with Hagar here tonight and then we'll look at a few other thoughts here by God's grace I'd like to preach on the God who sees the God who sees Hallelujah let's read that together if we could ready one two three and she called the name of the Lord that spake unto her thou God seest me for she said have I also here looked after him that seeth me let's have one more word of prayer if you have a eat on your heart let's make it known to God father God we thank you for tonight Lord we thank you for your love and compassion Lord God we're thankful that you're holding us Lord God each one of us can look down through life we can see Mountain Toops where we were just so elated and so Victorious but we can also see valleys where we know you had to walk with us through those valleys Lord God in each Place Lord God you saw us you were with us Lord God you were strengthening us you were guiding us you were holding us Lord God in every situation so Lord we want to thank you for your mercy and love Lord in our lives you've planned out our whole lives you're the author and finisher of our faith you're the Alpha and Omega Hallelujah you're in control Lord here tonight so father God have your way Lord let your spirit guide me guide the people Lord God to pull upon Lord the word of God and Lord God we just trust Lord that you'll hear our humble prayers Lord God we know Lord God only two or three are required Lord God and if they would call upon the name of the Lord they shall be heard Lord God so we're reminded of your precious promises Lord God we're humbled by Your Word we're humbled by your presence and Lord we're humbled by your power Lord so let your flow and your mercy and Grace and your spirit flow tonight God For Your Glory that needs might be met Lord God that prayers might be answer Lord we humbly ask it by the grace of God trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ and your righteousness alone we ask that these things could be done in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God hallelujah so I just want to look at this verse just for a brief moment you know this verse uh said she speaking of Hagar called the name of the Lord that spake to her thou God seest me Hallelujah she said thou God that's the uh Hebrew word God is L right which means the almighty uh the powerful one the strong one is another way to say that she said uh the strong one sees me now the Greek word there is Roy El Roy and this is uh uh the God who sees the strong God who sees Hallelujah so we want to look at this thought here just briefly here with the God who sees praise the Lord you know just briefly looking at the life of uh Hagar uh you know we first learn about here here in Genesis 16 she's introduced as an Egyptian maid servant uh to to Sarai uh wife of Abram uh and we remember that Sarah is baren and uh she takes upon herself to try to bring this promise to pass so she says uh husband uh take our our servant take our slave or I say servant would be a better one take our servant here and know her so that I can bring forth a child that would be a customary thing of those days if if the wife couldn't bring forth the child uh she would have uh a maid servant uh lie with her husband and and then and then the wife would would raise that child as it was her own so this was the custom of the time and of course this wasn't the will of God this was uh their own thinking they went against the the will of God they tried to bring a a promise to God to pass by their own selves and each time that happens it's always trouble praise God any time we try to make the word of God come to pass or uh I'll just say like this we try to be presumptuous and try to make things happen on our timetable instead of God's it always causes trouble or as you'll know later it always causes a wild thing to happen right because what came out of this a wild man an ishma right right an ishma came out and uh as you know you know all all the different uh Israelite tribes have all intermarried and moved and gone around so there there there's no real there's no really one nation that we would say are all Israelites um but the Nations that probably contain the most Israelites would be Saudi Arabia Jordan Yemen or Yemen I never say that right but really Church anyone who attacks Israel would be the ishmaelites right the wise men I'm sorry the wild men not wise men the the foolish men uh it'd be the wild men who are attacking uh the Bible say they persecuted uh the promise the the the children of the Bond woman persecuted the child of the promise right so anyone persecuting the Jews today so we know Hamas would be the Wild Man Group right uh anyone that's against Israel Iran and different nations that are uh constantly attacking Israel those are the wild men of today thank God that we're not wild thank God that we're tamed down thank God that we can learn cons control can I say like this self-control we can learn Temperance by the Holy Spirit praise God that we don't fight against one another another we love and encourage one another right that's how Israelites were known they would fight against other people we'd been looking at you know Wars and and you know in the churches right stripes and things like that that's not the nature of a Christian the nature of a Christian is peace that passes all understanding Hallelujah but we see this is you know where uh ishmail gets the start Hallelujah and uh and and then you know she gets pregnant she brings forth the ishmail and then after she brings forth ishmail Sarah begins to despise Hagar and mistreats her and uh Sarah confronts Abraham or Abram with Hagar's attitude and and Abram gives her permission do whatever you want with her right in Genesis 16 and and uh s Sarah really mistreats Hagar harshly so look at this even a person in the Hall of Fame of Faith could have troubles and and human frailties to mistreat people so don't be discouraged you ever mistreated somebody just look for more grace Hallelujah because Sarah that that's what the Bible records about her right she wasn't perfect neither was Abram we went through Abraham's mistakes last year right we had a whole a whole list of them all the good but all the bad too amen and so we can see that that she gets upset and then whatever treatment this was we're not told what it was maybe you know they we've we've seen dramas where she maybe slapped Hagar or whatever whatever she did it caused her to Hagar to run away in the wilderness I don't know what would cause you to run from your home but probably physical abuse right and goes out alone in the wilderness right this causes her to do such a a thing to leave uh where she was and to flee in the wilderness but then graciously the angel of the Lord finds Hagar by a spring in the desert and tells her to return to Sarai and to submit to her Authority so see we can see that Hagar wasn't completely sweet and submissive right so it wasn't like she was helping Sarah you know with uh being so sweet and tender all the time cuz the angel says you have to submit yourself right so we can see there's wrongs on both sides usually that's how it is right if you're amongst Believers now Hagar became a believer in the Lord I don't we don't know to the extent she continued to be a believer but she certainly heard from God as we'll see and then the in Genesis 1610 through2 you know the angel Lord also made a promise to Hagar that her descendants would be numerous and she'd bear a son who'd be called ishmail God hears and but he's prophesied to be a a wild man and he would have conflict with others right especially uh the true seed of God the true seed of Israel Hallelujah and uh then Hagar names a place where she meets this Angel she meets an angel and she calls us uh beer la la Hoy R Ria I say that wrong every time but I'm trying my best and it means The Well of him that liveth and seeth me acknowledging God's awareness of her situation so she's all by herself in the wilderness uh she she feels like she has nowhere to go and God shows up and God shows Mercy to her Hallelujah ever been that ever been in that place where you feel like maybe you've been rejected you've been mistreated by even church members even uh even the elect you've been mistreated by the elect And yet when you're all alone look at this church even when you feel like you're alone you're never alone hallelujah amen you might feel like you're forsaken but you're not forsaken Hallelujah because God sees Hallelujah we see this plainly that that in Genesis uh 16 Hallelujah I think I read the wrong yes no 1613 yes that even in 1613 she said it's God uh who's seen me she's been all alone but she says God has seen me right now look Church even when you're mistreated God sees you but see God let you go through the mistreatment why to teach you to trust in him Hallelujah and church let's not forget many times we have to suffer so we learn obedience it's hard for us to remember that but we have to remember that even Jesus had to suffer to learn to obey Hallelujah now he never disobeyed that that's the that's the difference with him he was holy he was blameless he was harmless amen the Son of God hallelujah but we're not holy all the time we're not harmless all the time and the church said hallelujah we're not harmless all the time we want to be we we try to be Lambs gentle like Lambs wise as serpents harmless as doves we try to be that but we're not always that way sometimes we mistreat others but still Church even in in in in the midst of our trials God sees us and the point I want to make here God even sees uh the Bond woman look at that she wasn't the the the the woman of Promise Sarah was the promised woman and if God sees the Bond woman surely God sees you hallelujah how many believe you're a child of the promise the promise of Jesus Christ the Messiah right and the Rapture and all and the and the Millennium and the future home we believe we're children of that promise we're not going to be the children of the of we're not going to be the children that are left behind in the rapture we want to go in the Rapture praise God we're not going to be the people that miss the Millennium right we want to be a part of the people that rule in the Millennium praise God even if we're the least of those in the Millennium that we want to be one of those Hallelujah God help us to be just the very least if not whatever whatever God has God help us just to be there praise God never exalting ourselves or trusting in ourselves but trusting in the grace of God we're aware that we uh as the message Believers following God's Prophet brother brandham we've been given a special Revelation I was raised in the Pentecostal Church some of God I never heard anything like what I heard when I come to hear God's Prophet brother bradam so I know and I'm sure you do if you're raised in denomination you know we're a special blessed people by the grace of God hallelujah not by our works but by the call of God hallelujah like when I was in denomination I never heard hell was not Eternal right but it makes no sense how can a person live eternally unless they have eternal life it doesn't make any sense in denomination I never heard God was one person but that's what the Bible says God is one person Jesus is the express image of God's person Hallelujah I never even heard about the Millennium or the future home uh for 18 or 19 years growing up I never heard about that I've heard about the power of God thank God I'm thankful for what I heard about but when we came to the message we heard greater things I never heard about the wise and foolish virgins until I heard brother the random the anointed on to the end times amen and that's what brother Irvin asked me in the car he said brother Jesse what does that mean false Christ it means they're false seed in other words they're lost but they have the genuine anointing at times like balum ba the Bible said balum went to hell but he also had the genuine anointing at times to prophesy about the Star of David Caiaphas probably went to hell right but he had the right anointing to say one man must die for the whole nation Hallelujah and then those in Matthew 7 uh they cast out Devils they healed the sick they did all these things but Jesus said I never knew you he never denied that they didn't do the Miracles and Judas Judas did all those uh uh he healed the lepers raised the Dead cast out Devils every demon Spirit was subject to judas's scari but he was lost a son of predition and so Jesus said there be many false christs so see Church what we need is we need the Christ and we need a true Christ amen we need a TR true anointed one we need people that are saved we need to be saved and we need to have the right anointing as well Hallelujah that's what we need today Hallelujah That's What attracted me to this message the the anoint the ones in the end time uh the serpent seed uh the true water baptism in the name of Jesus Christ not titles father Son and Holy Ghost amen but that there's one name to the father son Holy Ghost that's the name Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah right now we see it we we're just we're blessed Children of the promise so we got to be uh we got to be faithful to what God's called us to be at the end of Genesis 16 Hagar returns to Abram's household and gives birth to ishmail when Abram's 86 years old ishmail grows up in Abram's house for about 13 years or so and then in chapter 17 God get renews the Covenant with Abram tells him it's going to come through Sarah but she's going to change her name to Sarah right but finally in Genesis 21 Sarah or SAR Bears Isaac and the Bible said they laughed because God made them to laugh they laughed at the beginning with unbelief but God makes them laugh with joy at the end that's what God does right God will give you a promise it might seem impossible you might laugh at it say oh it's impossible but God will make you believe it if it's his word hallelujah hallelujah praise God Amen and uh she was 90 Sarah is 90 Abram was 100 then in Genesis 21 uh you know Isaac is made fun of by ishma and uh Sarah kicks him out I'm sorry kicks her out and uh God Abram Abraham goes to God and God says listen to what Sarah says right that's the time Brothers you know sometimes God will tell you listen listen to what your wife is telling you to do right Hallelujah but the man's ultimate leader right but there are times where God will give the direction the right move to the wife praise God there are times but the man is the head Hallelujah no no problems there by God's grace the trouble is if the woman's making all the decisions all the time that's that person's probably off the word of God right that man's not leading like a man should lead Hallelujah right so Abraham gets distressed but he God says listen to Sarah Sarah kicks him out and Abram gives them little Provisions right and they begin wandering off into the Wilderness in Genesis 21 and then haggar's in despair remember the story he's probably 13 14 year old boy and she can't she can't stand to see her son die of thirst of dehydration so she puts him under a bush walks away church I just want you to be uh mindful again God cries out uh uh God hears the cries of ishmail Hallelujah and the angel Lord calls to Hagar from heaven and Comforts her and reiterates the promise and says Israel be become a great nation and then the Bible said God opens her eyes to see the water I like that amen sure sometimes it's it's sometimes the problems with us we're not seeing things the way we need to see things praise God God may have something right there for us but we got to have our eyes open so we can see the promise of God church we can trust God hallelujah how many are encouraged that the God who sees saw Hagar twice see that she was all alone we'd say all deserted seemed like life was over seemed like there was no hope but who saw her God saw her both times Hallelujah and she wasn't even in the promise and if God sees someone who's not in the promise God will surely see you and I in the promise say amen that's why I'm bringing that out it's the God who sees he sees each person Hallelujah the Bible said God would that that no man be lost God would that all men be saved now we know very few will find it but it's God's desire that each would receive it praise God hallelujah so Hagar twice is given this this Revelation she sees that God sees me if God ever makes a promise God will bring it to pass hallelujah amen God Watches Over Us Church uh and if God saw Hagar then certainly he'd see Abraham Abraham's seed right Abraham Isaac Jacob he protected them right down to Moses Joshua Samuel David Solomon Esther Daniel Ezra Nehemiah Malachi John the Baptist he saw them through all the time God never took his eye off the promised seed did they have struggles yes but who they have they had the God who sees Hallelujah they had El uh Roy amen El Roy they knew they had God the strong one who sees me and church we can say God sees us because we're in the promise amen oh didn't acts 2:39 say This Promise is unto you and your children all them that are far off even as many as the Lord Our God shall call Hallelujah who's the youngest one baptized is it is it Victoria anybody younger than Victoria been baptized Hallelujah so even Victoria at 8 years old God sees her as part of the promise she's been baptized how many know her sins are remitted and she shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost amen for This Promise she's a child of the promise Hallelujah she's a child of the the promise of the Covenant praise God and if God sees Hagar twice outside of the Covenant God will surely see us inside the Covenant Hallelujah just be encouraged El Roy amen El Roy the God who sees God is watching us tonight Hallelujah he's always watched over his promised seed amen he can't take his eyes off his chosen people how many believe that tonight Hallelujah doesn't always seem like it but his eyes are upon us praise God now we know Ishmael grows up later becomes uh a great Archer Hagar gets a wife for him from the Egypt Egypt land so of course she wasn't you know wasn't say she wasn't part of the promise you know um and ishmael's descendants are listening the Bible said they were great in number and so they are today right millions and billions of Israelites we'd say Arabs right that are against the Jews millions of them but we learned these great points about Hagar God cares for the outcast Hallelujah if you felt Outcast or deserted God's watching you remember brother Austin let's not forget Austin's testimony Austin would sometimes sleep at the parking deck at akan University he'd sometimes sleep in little Fe s down there and did God ever take his eye off him absolutely not and look look at him today look at him when he comes up and sings Psalms see church God has his eye on you and I hallelujah praise God as far as he was gone he's not here but you know his testimony he shared it on podcast as far as he went in drugs and different decisions he made God's eye was never off him because God knew someday he's going to come back and he's going to be worshiping in the house of the Lord hallelujah he couldn't get out of God's eyes cuz he's part of the Covenant he's part of the promise let's don't let's not forget you and I are part of that Promise Too hallelujah amen see and look at she obeyed God in such a little way she just obeyed the angel and went back and submitted herself see church sometimes it's just hard for us to submit to what God wants us to do but look what she did she humbled herself a little woman who really didn't even have a husband she probably felt like her husband abandoned her right right but it wasn't like the full legitimate marriage of a husband but see God honored her obedience and so when she was in great need God came and helped her out because God saw her Hallelujah so see obey God cares for the outcast God o God honors your obedience God honors your faith and then God kept his promise to ishmail and then of course God showed us that God helps us survive and God gives us strength God opens our eyes when we don't see how it's going to work out God opens our eyes so we can see Hallelujah is that right God had to open her eyes so she could see the water to give to her son that her son's life would be spared Hallelujah church I want to look let's look at this verse here's another verse to see how God looks at our problems uh Exodus 14:24 would you pull that up there hun this just blessed me as I Was preparing this scripture just come to me I was reading it a couple weeks ago so Israel had already come out of uh Egypt church and they were coming to the Red Sea and I want I want you to see what the Bible says it came to pass that in the morning watch the Lord looked unto the host of the Egyptians through the pillar of fire in the cloud and troubled the host of the Egyptians Church they had that Pillar of Fire going before them but what was God doing it's like God's eyes was in that Pillar of Fire and God in other words God saying I'm staring down your enemies I see your enemies and I'm going to give them trouble Hallelujah but they had the wait for the right time God's our deliverer if we'll follow the pillar of fire amen are you with me Church follow the pillar of fire if we follow the pillar of fire God will look through that Pillar of Fire he'll look at our enemies he'll stare down our enemies and he'll say this mountain is H has to move hallelujah it's going to move and didn't he move them Church did he move them or not they had to wait they got a real uncomfortable situation but God had to uh Moses Cried Out wh uh Lord what's happening and God said why cry speak and go forward amen another time he said stand still and see the salvation of God hallelujah sometimes God has you stand still right brother Rod he'll just have you stand still and wait other times God will say speak the word that's why church when we come to church we got to see what the holy spirit's prompting us to do it won't always be speak the word sometimes God wants you to wait and suffer a little more so you learn to obey Hallelujah right you know like I told you before we've had people say brother Jer speak the word this brother J why don't you speak the word right I can't speak the word unless God's telling me to speak the word and then when people say that they're the ones that they don't speak the word when they go through trials well how can God be telling you to tell me to speak through trials when you never speak through trials it's kind of like you still got a moat in your eye you got to pick out of there right you're trying to tell me how to overcome my trials when you have all these other trials and you don't overcome them the way you should oh I love it amen but see God is looking at our enemies God is the one who has he is his eyes on the whole situation God was watching them even when uh uh the brick making got hard God was watching them the Bible said God heard their prayers their cries for 400 years God heard their cries and God waited 400 years so again I preached that a few months ago church God may let us suffer God may let us die we don't know what's going to happen but no doubt God hears every prayer we pray Hallelujah right to say that he doesn't would be to doubt him would be to doubt his infinite power but we know God is all powerful amen he's Elroy God sees me praise God but God has a plan and God's going to bring a certain generation at a certain time to do a certain work we hope it's us that we get to miss death and go to meet Jesus in the air but we don't know but God sees us anyhow praise God hallelujah we hope and pray we're that generation who gets to skip death but we don't know but El Roy is still alive and well today Hallelujah because El Roy became the Lord Jesus Christ that's right amen El Roy put on flesh amen that's right Hallelujah now let's look here I don't think I'll be too terribly long long tonight here we'll see I don't know you never know uh let's look at a few things here I want you to see here let's look at Matthew 24 verse 5 6 7 and 8 Jesus was constantly watching people so when Al Roy uh left the pillar of fire and he came behind flesh then the spirit of God was in Christ remember the fullness of the godhead dwelt in Christ bodily God was in Christ reconciling the world to himself how many can say Amen to that God came and dwelt in Christ to reconcile himself unto God hallelujah so Matthew 245 we put up five for many shall come in my name saying I am Christ and shall deceive many is that the right one no it's 23 I'm sorry H not my my fault yeah I wrote down the wrong one I'm so sorry I wrote down the wrong chapter it's 23 four five six S8 forgive me hun that's it's just being in a hurry but all their Works they do to be seen of men see now what religion people listen church God help us God help us religious people just want other people to see them but real Christians just want God to see them real Christians like I don't care what anybody else sees I want God to see me that's what Jesus tells about these religious people the only reason they do religious works is so other people will see them so they don't have a real private secret life with Christ it's only just coming to church or going out public and people can praise them oh look at you did look you're you're such a great person they just want the praise of men they don't want the Praises of God so notice and Jesus watch Jesus is watching this he would go in the markets he'd watch the Pharisees the Sadducees herodians uh he'd watch all of them they make broad their fies and enlarge the B borders of their garments and love the uppermost rooms at feasts and the chief seats in the synagogues and the greetings in the market and to be called of men Rabbi Rabbi or teacher teacher but be not be not called Rabbi for one is your master even Christ and all ye are Brethren so I want you to see this Jesus watches why we're doing the things we do why do we pay tithes why do we pay offerings why do we go to church why do we pray why do we fast why do we give alms why do we do all these things Jesus is watching and he he's watching us the God who sees he sees why we're doing it may our motives and objectives be pure because these guys got to a spot where alls they did did was Works to be seen of men not for God to see them they just wanted to be greeted out in public or in the church they didn't really want to be seen by God because if they wanted to see by God they would have kept some some of these things a secret okay so Jesus was watching where they sat when they went to fellowships right what they wore the greetings that they would get he would watch how they greeted one another oh there's my great Pastor there's my the great preacher there's the great don't call anybody great there's only one great that's God God you've seen it right guest preachers come in everybody shake their hand a certain way now it's okay to show honor respect but then another preacher maybe not as popular come in and nobody just really talks to him because he's maybe older maybe he's not as handsome as the older guy you know maybe he's not as rich as the other guy right you've seen a brother Rod right you know but people just it's all about the outward appearance but God is looking at the heart Hallelujah God's looking at the Heart Church I like this one in Mark chapter 2 uh go to verse three this is where uh it's a beautiful story where uh they're in Peter's house Jesus and Peter's house and they can't get in so that they have to pull or drop a man down through the ceiling I want you to see this and they come unto him bringing one sick of paly which was born of four he was one of four children and when they could not come nigh unto him for the Press they uncovered the roof where he was and when they broken up they let down the bed whereever the sick of the py lay verse 5 when Jesus saw their faith he said unto the sick of the py son thy sins be forgiven thee so just leave that up there for a moment I just love this Jesus was standing there he was just standing there sitting there the whole time he was just letting them manifest their faith their sick friend was was was in awful condition and Jesus just let them God was in him so God just moved him to just watch and just watch what people do when people are sick God's watching how we treat the sick Hallelujah everybody see that Jesus is watching do we help the sick do we help the poor and if we do what does Jesus see he sees our faith because faith is your works and your love of God expressed right Faith Works by love so love Faith Works if you have love it'll give you faith faith will produce works so see this is El Roy praise God he sees our works Hallelujah he sees our our religious actions he sees us uh if we're in the promise if we're not in the promise God sees us everywhere Hallelujah and God wants to minister to our needs but we got to be faithful to him Hallelujah now here's the one I love I love this one Luke 21 verse1 this I love this story and he looked up and saw the rich men casting their gifts in the treasury verse two and he saw also certain poor Widow casting in thither too much I just leave that up there a widow right so not exactly Hagar but very similar she don't have a husband right and Hagar her husband wasn't with her right you know Abram it just wasn't exactly a full marriage more like a concubine situation but see God is there God in flesh is looking at the woman he sees her he lets all the rich people give their offering but then God sits there and lets this poor Widow who remember has no source of income that's any substantial income if she does I I need to go through that through the Bible and see what widows did for money how did they were they just they uh I know Paul told them to take care of widows who are widows indeed who are praying and fasting and and so forth uh they had to be proven now think of that church think let's apply that to today if there was some sister in our church that didn't have a husband right she's a widow if we apply that today I'd have to look at that sister if she needed help I'd have to say are you praying and fasting before I can help you now which on of us would really think about that that's what Paul said they have to be widows indeed and he said not the women that will run out there and try to get married real real fast a young man or something like that so just look at that there are requirements for people to get financial help in the church widows right look at that but I love this Jesus he just he lifs lifts up his head and he watches people give their offerings and he sees this Widow two mites if I'm not mistaken that was two fifths of one penny but I could be wrong on that I feel I feel like that's what I remember from my studies okay verse three and he said of a truth I say unto you this poor Widow hath cast in more than they all verse four why because all these have of their abundance or their extra money cast in under the offerings of God but she of her penury hath cast in all the living that she had so she gave all of her income the rich people just gave a very small percentage of it and look at that church Jesus let her do it Jesus didn't stop and say no sister no sister you keep your last two pennies no Jesus let her do that why because the Bible tells us the Bible tells us God loves a cheerful Giver Hallelujah God loves that and no doubt God was going to pay her back in Proverbs the Bible says if we lend to the Lord the Lord will pay us back well her she was poor already you know if we give to the poor we're lending to the Lord and the Lord will pay us back well how much more will Jesus pay her back Hallelujah with some some great blessing praise God and Jesus just stood there and he saw and he let her Express her faith amen Church don't you know sometimes your trials are are are allowed so God can help you and God can watch you and watch if you express your faith or not do you have faith that in your darkest trials you'll still give your tithes and offerings and I'm not preaching on money tonight I'm just that's just the example right in your deepest trial will you still be faithful to God's word if your marriage is on the rocks will you still be faithful to your husband or your wife if your child's uh run running sinful or or things like that will you curse them and call them serpent seed or will you pray and intercede and try to bring them to Christ Hallelujah you know just in your darkest hour God will sometimes step back and just watch I'm just watching my daughter here manifest the word of God I'm just watching my son here manifest the faith that's in his heart hallelujah praise God that's what Jesus did he just stepped back and let this woman Express her faith I know God's in control I know God owns the cattle of a thousand hills and if I get my last two dollars God will pour out a blessing upon me praise God that's Faith El Roy the God who sees he sees your religious acts he sees your giving right Hallelujah he sees your faith praying for the the sick Jesus would stand back and just watch them what are they going to do Hallelujah that's what's happening now right God's watching what we're going to do when our friends are in hurricanes right or people we know are suffering don't have money don't have food or clothing or water something we hear about it God's watching what are we going to do with our faith I think one of our children said boy we're really thankful to live in Ohio and I said Amen to that but that doesn't mean we should we should stop our and and and and close up our vows of compassions the Bible says

tonight God's watching me tonight he's El Roy the God who sees Hallelujah and God will bring his word to pass Hallelujah God sees us now let me uh look at a few verses now I'm just going to kind of go real fast here uh like a machine gun here I should say like that God is completely watchful of Our Lives he sees every detail of Our Lives Psalms 121:3 says he will not suffer thy foot to be moved so in other words if your foot gets moved God allowed it he that keepeth the will not Slumber God doesn't go to sleep on you behold he that keepeth Israel shall not neither sleep nor slumber nor sleep I'm sorry slumber nor sleep so God's not sleeping when you're going through tough times God's watching you all of us got to fall asleep sometimes and we can't be faithful like we like to right but not God hallelujah God doesn't take a break amen Psalms 139 verse1 oh Lord thou has searched me and known me thou knowest my downsitting and my Uprising thou understandest my thought a far off thou Compass my my path and my lying down and art acquainted with all my ways see God knows how you work God knows how you sleep God knows how you rest God knows what you're doing on your phone right God knows what you're watching God knows everything he's watching everything Church Hallelujah Matthew 10: 29 are not Two Sparrows two birds sold for a farthing and one of them shall not fall on the ground without your father our children found some dead birds recently right out in the yard God knew about each one of them of those we lost a deer chicken this week God knew about that chicken God saw all of it he says but the very hairs of your head are all numbered fear ye not therefore ye are of more value than many sparrows hallelujah amen Don't Be Afraid amen your hairs are numbered God sees when you stand up God sees when you sit down your steps are are are are protected by the grace of God I'll never forget this remember when we move the church from uh up on uh it was near kago falls down to M drive one of your friends was operating the U-Haul truck and it moved this this uh U-Haul this metal piece up and down I don't know if you remember this but one of the one of his friends thought he could operate this and my foot was right between uh this this uh steel plate that raised and uh and uh the boy was playing with it and I didn't see it and my foot was in there and he started it it and it was about to crush my foot in half but then he stopped it and I quickly pulled it out and he didn't even see it and then he kept then he cranked it back up so it's like he went fast slow down and up and didn't even know and church that was God keeping my feet right there God would not suffer my foot to be crushed that was God's grace to me we were moving the church I mean I was sacrificing a Saturday to move the church and get everything in there and God just in a natural way kept my foot not to slip how about about when we went on that hike remember that hike with Josh the barber God did not let our foot slip there was a lot of dangerous moments I would not have went on that hike if I'd have known how dangerous it was going to be that's another example of how God kept our feet right Genevie God kept our feet with the Rushing Waters and the uh and the hills and the rocks and everything like that it was God's grace to us just in the simple ways Hallelujah Jeremiah 1 verse5 before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee God already knew you before you were conceived talk about forign knowledge and before thou camest forth out of the womb I sanctify thee that means set apart or a purpose already ordained for him and I ordain thee a prophet unto the Nations see whatever you were ever going to be God already knew about it praise God you know one person a dear person they uh emailed me and said has my life just been a waste and I said of course not how could your life be a waste the only way it could be a was is if you lost all your reward and the only way you lose all your reward is to be like lot you know losing all as a reward or King Saul to sell out the word of God if you're trying to obey the word of God God has a rich reward for you praise God because it's not how much you give as far as the number it's how much you give of what you have Hallelujah with a widow woman is that right I mean my goodness our lives are not a waste in other words God knew what he called called us to be remember he determined the bounds of our habitation and we're just supposed to keep oh God help us to be like in one way like Hagar God open our eyes where what he wants us to do Hallelujah open our eyes so we can see God's provision for our lives amen before God formed Us in the womb he knew us already Hallelujah we were known already the God he already saw us amen glory he already saw us before we were conceived in the womb Hallelujah my goodness Proverbs 15:3 the eyes of the Lord are in every place beholding the evil and the good see God's watching you how many let's all say the word every can we every God's in this place right now his eyes are on you his eyes are on me remember his eyes were going out through the pillar of fire

akan Hallelujah God's eyes are going through kyoga falls down in Florida amen and Tennessee and Georgia all all these places is affected you know Alabama whe whoever is affected North Carolina South Carolina God's eyes are looking for someone whose heart is perfect Hallelujah who's confessed all their sins and they just want to serve God remember church this goes with John 4:23 God is seeking the father is seeking for worshippers who worship Him in spirit and truth I taught that at the middle school Bible club and I walked by every middle school middle school and I said you know God's going to stop right here I said God's going to stop at this table and say is anybody worshiping me today and then I went by the other table I said is anybody the Lord said is anybody to worship me at this table and then went to the next table is any G anybody going to worship me at this table because God's looking I'm looking for a worshipper right he went to I went to every table and you should have saw these these were 10 12 11 13 years you should have saw as soon as I said that they started praising God Saints what is it childlike Faith he's seeking people to worship him right he's seeking for someone that will trust in God even though my trials are are are are so tremendous even though it doesn't seem like there's any hope I will trust in God I will worship God when times are tough Hallelujah I'm the God who sees God says I'm El Roy Hallelujah Psalm 34:15 the eyes of the Lord are upon the righteous and his ears are open unto their cry job 31:4 doth not he see my ways and count all my steps not only does God got your hairs counted he's got your steps counted amen that's why one reason I bought a smartwatch so it could count my steps but that that's just that's copying God God started that way before the watch company did Hallelujah Glory he's already counting your steps he's already count all the hairs each night I lose about five or six get out of the shower there's maybe there's 10 hairs I don't know you brother I don't know I don't not can ask brother R like how how come my hairs are leaving me but brother R said wherever they're wherever I got them that's where I'm going to get them back Hallelujah wherever they were before I got them that's where I'm going to go get them I never lost one of them amen that's right doesn't he see all my steps doesn't he see he's Al Roy Hallelujah he's Jehovah Gyra amen Jehovah Rafa Jehovah sha Jehovah tisu he's the Lord Jesus Christ amen the God who sees Glory 1 Peter 5:7 Church let's keep this in mind casting all your care on him because God cares for you Satan wants to make you feel like God doesn't care he doesn't see he doesn't he but the Bible just says he cares he knows every step he's seeking after you his eyes are constantly watching you amen he won't let your one he won't let one foot be slipped Hallelujah he'll keep you right when uh when you feel like you're going to stumble he'll keep you from stumbling praise God that's a God we can worship Hallelujah that's a God we can trust let's remember these precious promises how many enjoying the promises amen now that's like that's what I call a machine gun bang bang bang bang bang okay now slow down a little bit I'll finish up here by God's grace El Roy how we love him church I think we see such compassion in Jesus uh I want to leave this one uh up here uh in times like this you know when people are asking me is this a tribulation things let's remember John 14:27 let's remember this all I still got a little bit more to go here peace I leave with you my peace I give unto you not as the world giveth now most people to get peace today they got to go get drunk or get on marijuana or get some Vapor that's how they get peace but Jesus said I'm not leaving you that I'm leaving you my peace not as the word World gives give I unto you let not your let don't let your heart be troubled don't let it be afraid so if Jesus is telling us that we shouldn't do this then he must have power to help us to do it right and he does it's called the holy spirit amen it's called the Holy Ghost amen I know a ghost amen I know the Holy Ghost Hallelujah that's right I know the Holy Spirit and he says not to fear I'm with you even in you to the End of the Age Hallelujah he sees us and he leaves us his peace you know as I'm coming down here to a close I talked to a friend today like I said and uh she said she had high school friends and different ones that 92 year old he's just going to stay so we'll pray for him but she also said I had numerous high school friends they tried to leave but couldn't because all the gas in Florida is in that area it's all up it's all used up and if they leave they run out of gas and she said she saw on her news and the apps and Facebook so some of her friends can't leave because it's like there's cars just stranded all along certain highways because they can only make it so far and she said there's numerous families with children just walking along the road she said it looks like it's a it's a a war zone so what do you do in those moments remember God sees doesn't that sound like Hagar all I got a child Hallelujah yeah what do you do it's God all you can do is call on God and church we think we got hard times now we do have some hard times but think about how hard that would be she said would you pray for them yes I'll pray for them Hallelujah we'll pray for them by God's grace see there's people going through difficult times right in the midst of us and we have to remember that God sees them and it's our duty to pray for them Hallelujah that's why we're here that why do we have it better because God wants us to pray sometimes we might not have it better for our whole lives we don't know but while we got it better we better pray for them Hallelujah like the Bible says remember if you remember the part of the body that's suffering then if a part's suffering everybody should suffer with it if everyone's rejoicing let's Rejoice with them let's remember them Hallelujah as they go through their struggles like I said a dear precious friend said are we in the tri I said certainly not we're not even close to the tribul I mean these conditions are not even close to the tribulation uh let's read Revelation 8 let's look at just the first trumpet Church verse eight uh chapter 8 verse 6 verse 7 let's go to 87 to save time the first Angel sounded and there foued hail and fire mingled with blood when have we ever seen that hail fire and blood falling from the sky and they were cast upon the Earth who seen blood rained down from heaven we're not in the tribulation yet church it's going to be the most awful time R said do everything you can do to miss the tribulation period in other words trust in God live true to God love God repent of your sins serve God and the third part of trees was burned up a third of all the trees on the Earth are burned up and and all green grass all the green grass was burned up so you get two-thirds of the trees left all the grass is gone that's never happened right this has never happened some people do you know some people believe this has already happened what world are they living in brother Rod what what fantasy are they living in verse eight and then the second Angel sounded and as it were a great Mountain burning with fire was cast into the sea a fiery Mountain was cast into the sea and the third part of the sea became blood a you would think we'd see that on on the social media if the third part of the sea was blood wouldn't we see that wouldn't somebody catch that on their phone of course this hasn't happened yet what are we going through the we're going through the birth pains Jesus said Wars rumors of wars pestilences earthquakes in diverse places all these are the beginning of Sorrows boy we're really getting some birth pains right now aren't we the two Wars and the hurricanes and then that my friend told me in Idaho there's a bunch of wildfires people are losing their houses there and yeah why W thank you I got the wrong State there I can't remember everything but just you know she's like and she's just in distress and then they got the election coming up uh and she says is this all part of the election I said it might be we don't know but one thing we know there's a greater election amen that's the election where you were elected to Salvation before the foundation of the world Amen that's the election we're trusting in Hallelujah brother BR said I only voted once that was for Jesus Christ he said and I only get one vote I vote for Christ Hallelujah Glory see Church you know we got to just pray for these people we got to understand the time and season that we're in Hallelujah let me close with this Psalm 461 oh it's perfect time okay yeah just got about an hour I never realized I was just going to use verse 13 but let's read the whole chapter to the chief musician for the sons of Kora a song upon alamoth Hallelujah and this was our memory verse in Bible club last month God is our refuge and strength God is your Fortress now I heard Martin Luther wrote A Mighty Fortress Is Our God based upon this verse that's been a classic hymn down through the years we need to sing it do we have do you know Malachi we'll have to practice that one Mighty Fortress Is Our God I can't remember the rest of the words there but I've heard it before it's a beautiful song who is your who's your Refuge who's your Tower God is who's your strength God a very present help in time of trouble that means vem holy speedily he's a speedy help in the time of trouble hallelujah amen therefore will not we fear though the Earth be removed and though the mountains be carried into the midst of the sea didn't we just talk about that my goodness we just read where the second Trump trumpet sounded even in that God says Don't Fear because God is in control now God forbid let me say this God forbid if any of us would have to live through the tribulation which means we're not born again we wouldn't have to fear because God would still take care of us somehow I know God cuts off the Gentiles right but he that's holy is Holy still he that's righteous is righteous still and God will not allow the righteous to suffer with the wicked so I believe we'd be gone by that time or we would not be affected or like the Bible does say remember this the Bible does say some of those in the tribulation will actually live through Armageddon and then they'll walk out in the ashes of the wicked as well in other words they'll be hiding in such a spot where all the the terrible trumpet and woes and vows won't harm them and they'll be able to walk out into the Millennium the Bible says that Zechariah those that are left of the remenant who make it through the battle of Armageddon they will be saved they'll go into the Millennium Hallelujah that's right God is rich in Mercy Church Glory verse three though the waters thereof Roar and be troubled look at the waters look at the Hurricanes though the mountains shake with the swelling thereof saah what saah mean it means pause it means suspension of music stop the music and pause right you've heard it said it probably means meditate so Church would you meditate on that God is your strength would you just pause for a moment though the waters Roar the mountains Shake pause remember God's your strength that's what this world doesn't want us to do wants to get notification on the next thing on the next thing but God said pause I'm your Fortress I'm your strength in the times of trouble how many believe the Holy Spirit wrote this letter this I'm sorry the song the letters are New Testament this is a song the Holy Spirit wrote this song verse four there is a river and streams whereof shall make glad the city of God and the Holy place of the Tabernacles of the most high Jerusalem God is in the midst of her and she shall not be moved God shall keep her and that right early Hallelujah God will protect his people verse six the Heathen raged the kingdoms were moved he uttered his voice and the Earth melted the Lord of hosts is with us see Angel armies the god of Jacob is our refuge sa La so again stop who's your Refuge where's your place of safety God's your place of safety brother baham just liking it like this he said he said when if there's he said if there's atomic bombs he said I'm going to go Nestle up under the wings of Jehovah he said that's my nuclear shelter amen hallelujah praise God right because Jesus said oh how often I would hover you as a hen do her brood brother said let's find a place amen hallelujah under the wings of Jehovah Hallelujah let's find a place there my we can find a place under the Mighty Wings of Jehovah he's our resting place God is with us God sees what we're going through praise God I'm not alone You Are Not Alone those in Florida are not alone and even if God takes a mem it's like that the tower Jesus said the Tower of I can't remember the exact name of it Jesus said that would have just that was just their time to go those people that died were no more wicked than anyone else right some people die in plane crashes motorcycle accidents uh brother Bram died result of a car accident we don't get the choice how we go but the one thing that we know is that we're going to be with Jesus let me say this I heard brother say it this week I think it was I've heard but now I see brother random said if your parents went to so much effort to make sure you had a good place when you arrived as a baby think of all the effort they went to my wife went and bought the boy clothes from Al and we had to wait a little while to the next boy but we're grateful for every one of them but think of all the effort you know I never did this yeah I'm not much of a worker but I remember Betsy and Dustin Dustin went in that room and he he painted it all he got trains on there for Asher you know is his only son you know he's got all these he painted man they just really made ready for Asher he's our only boy I just heard brother R say this if your natural parents made so much effort in preparation for your coming brother Ram said how much more is Jesus making preparation for your entrance into heaven hallelujah amen if all these preparations were made for you to get here Caris how much more if let's say we die in a car acent or we die in a plane crash or die or something like some accident how much more has God already made preparations that will when we die then we be present with the Lord hallelujah though we're absent from the body we're present with Christ hallelujah how much more oh my goodness right we'd have a home I'd start making I'm sorry my wife would would help me to start making everything ready I wouldn't make everything ready my wife would say get the pool ready get that ready let's go by that let's go by that if we went to all that effort how much more is Jesus making effort if we should happen to pass away on this side how how much more are those angels ready to pack our souls up to Glory come on servant of God come on uh you're a child of God brother Jesse if you pass on we're going to take you to the presence of God I'll say Glory he took our little little Le with him to Heaven this week amen hallelujah we believe that God has our pets there in heaven we're just believing that Bible said wherever the spirit whenever the spirit dies it goes back to the Creator by God's grace look at that say so pause on that God is he's the Lord of hosts he's the God of Angel Armies amen like I love that song Chris tomin sings that song the God of Angel Armies he's always by my side Hallelujah verse where we stop verse 8 come Behold The Works of the Lord what desolations he hath made in the earth he maketh Wars to cease under the ends of Earth so see he could stop the Russian war he could stop the Hamas war with Israel he could stop that at any moment but he lets it go on he says he breakthe bow and cutteth the spear and Sunder he burneth The Chariot in the fire and verse 10 this was what I was just going to preach but I didn't realize look at all that's in this chapter pause God's your Refuge God your Hiding Place Hallelujah God could stop anything he could stop any problem but if he allows it Church he's trying to get us to obey the word of God trying to teach us a a good lesson I'm not going to ask you raise your hands but how many of you sometimes feel like you're hard-headed don't raise your hands don't don't say Amen I'll say Amen to myself amen sometimes I just think I got to figure it out but God said no I'm going to let you suffer till you learn the lesson see he says be still and know that I am God remember I'm God of Angel Armies that means idle be still means be idle stop moving around stop rushing around trying to solve everything be still be idle and trust in God know that I'm God I can stop every war I can move any mountain I can stop any water I'm the one in charge of this game Hallelujah this this world Hallelujah this is my world Amen I will be exalted among the Heathen and I'll be exalted in the Earth the Lord of hosts is with who us the Lord of hosts is with us let's sing that one Lord of hosts you're with us with us in the fire we'll sing that one the god of Jacob is our refuge three times you cat that church what is three three is perfection three times he said I'm your Refuge I'm I'm your strength I'm your Fortress run into me and you'll be safe Hallelujah I'm the
