[0:02] We're gonna keep clapping, brother, till
[0:04] you come every service. Okay. That's a
[0:06] joke, brother. That's a joke. No, we
[0:09] love you, brother. God bless you,
[0:10] Richly. Appreciate you, brother Rod.
[0:12] Thank you, sir. Hallelujah.
[0:16] Any updates on the house sale, brother?
[0:17] Anything about that?
[0:18] &gt;&gt; It's off tomorrow.
[0:19] &gt;&gt; Okay, it's off tomorrow. Okay, brother.
[0:20] All right. Well, praise the Lord. That's
[0:22] one answer to prayer.
[0:26] &gt;&gt; Praise the Lord. Amen. And we're looking
[0:28] forward to our brother's testimony on
[0:30] Sunday night 3 o'clock by God's grace.
[0:33] So looking forward to that. Now one
[0:35] thing you know uh why I had Adam and
[0:37] then you know I felt led to have brother
[0:38] Rod just uh Adam's testimony for our
[0:41] brothers and just for any I mean all for
[0:43] hope for everybody but especially for
[0:45] the brothers and I love brother Rod's
[0:47] testimony. I love his character
[0:49] especially for our brothers here. I'm
[0:51] inspired by brother Rod. Brother Rod his
[0:54] love for the Lord his dedication for the
[0:55] Lord. I just I just get inspired every
[0:57] time I talk to him or get a voice
[0:59] message. I like the voice messages. I
[1:01] love that. I love that I can hear
[1:03] somebody's voice and how they feel and
[1:05] you know what how they're saying it, you
[1:07] know. Um but then just to hear all these
[1:10] testimonies, I think it'll be a great
[1:11] blessing to you on Sunday night. Then we
[1:13] have that brother from uh Kentucky
[1:15] coming uh in November. He was
[1:18] supernaturally healed of numerous u you
[1:21] know diseases and and and troubles. And
[1:23] this guy's on fire. He waves a
[1:26] handkerchief at the services. He's doing
[1:28] outreach. They're went to city hall and
[1:30] had held a service. He's putting
[1:32] together packets uh to give out to
[1:35] people that don't know the gospel. I
[1:36] mean, he's got a YouTube channel. He's
[1:38] not a preacher, but it's like he's
[1:40] testifying. He's on fire, you know. So,
[1:42] I these testimonies have inspired me.
[1:44] Like I told you, since Adam came, I've
[1:46] had so much victory in my life. Just
[1:48] just so blessed. I I just there's
[1:50] something happened to me and something
[1:52] happened to him, too. Amen. But uh I'm
[1:54] looking forward to the same with brother
[1:55] Rod's testimony. How many looking
[1:56] forward to that? Praise God. Amen. Just
[1:59] it's so wonderful to have God send our
[2:01] brothers in like this and uh God knows
[2:03] how to do it. Praise God. Looking
[2:05] forward to Sunday night, brother Rod.
[2:07] God bless you. Love you, brother.
[2:10] Hallelujah. So, Genesis 22:15. I'm 16.
[2:13] Sorry to hold you so long not saying my
[2:15] text, but I want to preach the angel of
[2:17] the Lord part two. We looked at part one
[2:19] on Sunday. I got some nice feedback from
[2:21] that online. So, I hope you were blessed
[2:23] on Sunday by the grace of the Lord. I've
[2:26] been growing in this area of angels. You
[2:27] know, I did I'm not I've not spent a
[2:29] time a lot of time on it. So, it's kind
[2:31] of like a fresh topic to me. Like I told
[2:33] you, I've always been drawn to doctrine
[2:35] and um you know, certain topics, but
[2:38] it's been a while. It's been five years
[2:39] since I looked at angels. So, a lot of
[2:41] this has been fresh to me. It's been a
[2:43] nice review.
[2:44] So um the angel lord again as we said on
[2:47] Sunday is God taking on an angel form
[2:52] but then when you know brother Brandham
[2:53] had the angel Lord come to him it wasn't
[2:55] God it was just his we'd say guarding
[2:57] angel or ministering spirit is another
[3:00] way to say that by God's grace. So we'll
[3:03] look at part two here tonight. So
[3:05] Genesis 22:15-6. Thank you. Wonderful
[3:07] job there. Okay let's read the Psalm
[3:09] three. Ready? One two three. And the
[3:11] angel of the Lord called unto Abraham,
[3:14] out of heaven the second time, and said,
[3:17] By myself have I sworn, saeth the Lord.
[3:22] For because thou hast done this thing,
[3:24] and has not withheld thy son, thine only
[3:28] son. May God add his blessing to Reema's
[3:31] word. You may be seated.
[3:34] I'll just do a really short review here.
[3:36] uh by God's grace.
[3:38] Uh this is this is the thought that
[3:40] really struck me was the angel of the
[3:42] Lord that there's numerous times where
[3:44] God would come down and he would put on
[3:46] an angel form.
[3:48] Uh and then uh as I said now I think
[3:50] there's at least eight types of angels.
[3:52] Now no doubt there's probably more uh no
[3:55] doubt about that. But just it's just
[3:56] been refreshing to see the angel of the
[3:58] Lord. Um archangels.
[4:01] Let me just get to my list here so I
[4:02] don't forget any. I hate to say there's
[4:04] eight and then not be able to name them.
[4:06] Cherub, third kind, saraphim, guardian
[4:09] angel, which we would call a ministering
[4:11] spirit in the King James version
[4:12] language. And then there's watcher
[4:15] angels, which was totally new to me in
[4:16] Daniel chapter 4. I', you know, of
[4:18] course I've read the Bible numerous
[4:19] times, but just never stuck out like,
[4:21] oh, that's a special type of angel. Um,
[4:24] and then of course very familiar with
[4:26] destroying angels. And then eight is
[4:28] sealing angels with the baptism of the
[4:31] Holy Ghost. So, uh, that's quite a
[4:33] wonderful thought there. By God's grace.
[4:35] So, there's at least eight, and I'm sure
[4:36] as I study this, I'll get to some more
[4:38] here. Uh, by God's grace, we're making
[4:40] really good time. All right. I might be
[4:41] able to preach 45 minutes tonight.
[4:43] Praise God. Hallelujah. That'd be
[4:44] wonderful. So, uh, uh, we we looked uh,
[4:48] Sunday at how the angel of the Lord,
[4:50] when it's God, he he went to believers
[4:53] that were involved with the covenant,
[4:55] right? With the covenant he'd made. Now
[4:57] we know there's the Edenic covenant um
[5:00] uh the first covenant the garden of Eden
[5:02] and then after that was the Adamic
[5:04] covenant or Adam covenant right and then
[5:07] there was the Noic covenant or Noah's
[5:09] covenant and then uh the Abrahamic
[5:12] covenant. So we see the angel Lord
[5:14] connected to uh Abraham there in Genesis
[5:17] 22:15 and 16. So we see God connecting
[5:20] to the covenant of Abraham uh that he
[5:23] gave him and that's still in effect
[5:24] today. How many know God's covenants are
[5:25] still in effect today? It's like God
[5:27] just adds on to that, right? Because we
[5:29] look outside, we saw a rainbow
[5:30] yesterday, right? That's the Noah
[5:31] covenant, right? Right. Still in effect.
[5:34] Um, now what's interesting is brother
[5:36] Billy Paul had a testimony. Now, I
[5:38] didn't I didn't agree with any of his
[5:39] doctrine. But his testimony was when
[5:42] brother Brandham was met by the angel
[5:45] and the angel let Billy Paul see him.
[5:47] Billy Paul's testimony was when the
[5:49] angel left there was a rainbow on the
[5:50] floor for like half an hour afterwards.
[5:53] So now every time I see an angel, I'm
[5:55] thinking I'm sorry. Now, every time I
[5:56] see a rainbow, I'm thinking, was there
[5:57] an angel?
[5:59] Uh, which is really interesting, real
[6:00] phenomenal, uh, by God's grace. But
[6:04] something to keep in mind, you know, uh,
[6:05] and I'll read some quotes, too,
[6:06] hopefully at the end here if we have
[6:07] enough time where brother specifically
[6:09] talks about angels being in the service
[6:11] and then the effects that that had on
[6:13] the people because remember every time
[6:15] they saw an angel in the Bible, usually,
[6:16] not every time, but usually it says how
[6:18] fearful they were,
[6:20] &gt;&gt; right? In most cases, now not every
[6:21] case, uh, but most cases, right? Because
[6:25] the Bible says you can entertain then
[6:26] unawares.
[6:28] Well, if you're not aware, then there
[6:29] wouldn't be the fear of the Lord, right?
[6:31] But if you're aware and there's fear
[6:32] instantly, then then that would that
[6:35] would cause the the angel the prince of
[6:37] God to bring this great fear upon you.
[6:39] So unawares there might not be that
[6:41] powerful presence. But if it was a
[6:43] powerful presence, then that would of
[6:44] course be the sign of an angel. But it
[6:47] just gives the idea you, in other words,
[6:48] the Bible says you always want to be
[6:49] ready. Hallelujah.
[6:50] &gt;&gt; Be instant in season, out of season. you
[6:53] might be entertaining angels and the
[6:55] Bible mainly the times that they would
[6:57] get entertained was uh related to births
[7:00] as well. I noticed that as well uh with
[7:03] Noah I'm sorry with Samson um and
[7:06] different ones that slipping my mind now
[7:08] but oh yeah Mary you know uh what's
[7:12] &gt;&gt; Yeah.
[7:14] &gt;&gt; John the Baptist. Yes. John the B that's
[7:15] right brother John the Baptist. So often
[7:17] angels are connected to birth the Lord
[7:19] Jesus as we said Chris.
[7:29] &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Hallelujah.
[7:32] &gt;&gt; Yeah. Yeah. Let's do that after service,
[7:34] brother. That's awesome. Hallelujah.
[7:37] Amen. Proof of God. Just like the
[7:39] picture of pillar of fire and the
[7:40] picture of the cloud. By God's grace,
[7:42] God sometimes gives supernatural
[7:43] vindications. There's that one message
[7:46] believer, a sister down there in
[7:47] Louisiana. She has a scan like this and
[7:49] you can see the cancer. Uh the next time
[7:51] she goes back, the cancer has vanished.
[7:53] I love stuff like that. You know,
[7:55] science science has to prove it. They
[7:56] have no other explanation. That's right.
[7:59] &gt;&gt; Right. And church, guess what song was
[8:00] singing when she got the healing? Uh
[8:02] leaning on the everlasting arms. That
[8:04] was a song. What a fellowship. What a
[8:08] joy. And the angel of the Lord come down
[8:10] and touched her. And that cancer
[8:13] vanished. church. You just never know.
[8:15] You just always want to be ready.
[8:16] Instant e in season, out of season. You
[8:18] want to be serving the Lord. Praise God.
[8:19] God, forgive me of any evil thoughts or
[8:21] any evil deeds. Lord, I just want to be
[8:22] ready for your presence. Hallelujah.
[8:24] &gt;&gt; Because you never know when the angel of
[8:26] God may manifest something. Hallelujah.
[8:28] And as I said, you know, last Sunday,
[8:30] the moment right after I heard Charlie
[8:31] Kirk was shot, I'm driving home and a
[8:33] car swerves in front of me. I honk and
[8:35] it swerved right out of the way. So, I
[8:37] death was right there. Right after he uh
[8:39] met death, death was right there, but
[8:41] God spared me by God's grace. Uh, and
[8:44] again, we don't know why God God knows
[8:46] all things. Why God took Charlie Kirk or
[8:48] God took Brother Brandon at 56? 56 he
[8:50] was taken off the scene. How long did
[8:51] brother Angley live? 90.
[8:53] &gt;&gt; Almost.
[8:54] &gt;&gt; Oh, almost under. Praise God.
[8:56] &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. Let that be my
[8:59] testimony, your testimony. We all want
[9:01] that one. But God's got different plans,
[9:03] of course, but that's our desire, you
[9:04] know, of course, to stay with our loved
[9:06] ones as long as we can. But we saw
[9:08] Abram, Abraham with the covenant. Jacob
[9:10] also had the covenant because God told
[9:12] him uh I'm the God of Abraham and Isaac,
[9:16] right? And of course, Jacob, we saw it
[9:18] then with uh Moses. He was we brought a
[9:21] covenant, the Mosaic covenant. And we
[9:23] saw it with Joshua. Now, he was he was
[9:26] maintaining the Mosaic covenant in the
[9:28] promised land. Uh and also, yeah, that's
[9:30] right. He reinstated the covenant of
[9:32] circumcision. That's right. Good. So,
[9:34] thank you, Lord. And then we saw it with
[9:36] brother Brandham in Revelation 10.
[9:37] Brother Brham said, "Thus sayith the
[9:38] Lord." Revelation 10 was his ministry
[9:40] that was going to be fulfilled in his
[9:42] day. And of course, he's just restoring
[9:45] the truths of the new covenant that were
[9:47] lost down through the church ages that
[9:49] God had to restore through Martin Luther
[9:51] Seymour and brother Brandham. So we see
[9:53] brother Ram connected with the covenant.
[9:55] Brother Brham said, "I'm not bringing a
[9:56] different gospel. I'm restoring the
[9:58] original gospel."
[10:00] &gt;&gt; Brother Bham said, "I'm not preaching a
[10:01] different baptism of the Holy Ghost. I'm
[10:02] preaching the same Holy Ghost from the
[10:04] day of Pentecost."
[10:05] &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Ram said, "Thus sayith the
[10:08] Lord, the fullness of Pentecost will be
[10:10] back in the bride."
[10:11] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So, it's not nothing
[10:13] different. It's the same Holy Ghost.
[10:15] Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah.
[10:18] &gt;&gt; Now, new for tonight. Uh I went
[10:21] searching again with Angel Lord. Now, I
[10:22] find numerous ones. We're not going to
[10:24] read all these, but let's go uh to at
[10:25] least one here. It seems like the angel
[10:28] of the Lord went to Hagar. So, Genesis
[10:31] 16:10,
[10:32] uh you might be familiar with this one.
[10:35] Uh the angel actually spoke to Hagar at
[10:37] least twice. Seems like twice from the
[10:39] scripture. Uh first when she was
[10:42] pregnant with Ishmael and then uh after
[10:45] she had Ishmael and she was uh rejected
[10:48] by the free woman, right? Kicked out by
[10:50] the free woman. Okay, but notice here's
[10:52] why I think this is the angel of the
[10:54] Lord. Uh but we can still get lessons
[10:56] from this, right? He says uh and the
[10:59] angel Lord said unto her, I will
[11:01] multiply thy seed exceedingly. So, we
[11:03] know angels, you know, aren't creators,
[11:05] right? Uh that it shall not be numbered
[11:07] for multitude.
[11:10] So, again, this looks like the Lord
[11:11] saying, "I'm going to multiply your
[11:14] seed."
[11:15] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Now, it could be just a
[11:16] regular angel, but again, it looks like
[11:18] to me it would be the angel Lord. Um and
[11:21] uh you know, she would be connected to
[11:23] the covenant because she was a concubine
[11:25] of Abraham, right? So, and Abraham had
[11:29] the covenant, right? So, there is some
[11:31] connection there. But we take courage
[11:32] from this. I preached this many times.
[11:34] But if God cared so much about the
[11:36] natural seed of Abraham, then church, he
[11:38] surely cares about the spiritual seed of
[11:39] Abraham.
[11:40] &gt;&gt; In other words, God, remember later the
[11:42] second time she called that place the
[11:45] God who sees.
[11:48] &gt;&gt; Uh beer laoya. I can never say that.
[11:50] That's quite a tongue twister.
[11:54] &gt;&gt; Thank you, brother. Whatever he said.
[11:58] But that that's that's the revelation
[11:59] that struck her heart in this moment. My
[12:01] child's going to die. I'm gonna die of
[12:02] thirst. Yet God sees me.
[12:05] &gt;&gt; So church, that's where angels often
[12:07] come in. Now, none of us, and my wife
[12:08] and I have talked about this, none of us
[12:09] want to have spots where we need like
[12:11] where someone might get close to death
[12:12] and we need a miracle. Like, right? No
[12:14] one none of us want to get cancer and
[12:15] then have a miracle, right? Uh but
[12:18] oftentimes that's when the angels show
[12:19] up is in moments of great distress,
[12:22] &gt;&gt; right? Deep trials, very difficult
[12:24] situations. Here they're near death. And
[12:27] who shows up? God shows up. Amen.
[12:30] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But if you would have asked
[12:32] Hagar, would you like to be almost dead
[12:34] for the angel of God probably said,
[12:35] "Well, no, thank you.
[12:37] &gt;&gt; You I don't want to have to see my child
[12:38] suffer." Which parents want to see their
[12:39] children suffer? Starving and crying,
[12:42] you know, or
[12:44] you know, not having water and almost
[12:45] dying. No one wants to see that. But God
[12:48] in his mercy allows what he allows.
[12:51] &gt;&gt; And we got to trust God, right? He's
[12:53] perfect in all of his ways. And the
[12:55] church said,
[12:55] &gt;&gt; "Amen."
[12:56] So, we see the this one seems like it is
[12:58] the Lord. Now, in Haggar's second
[13:00] appearance, it's kind of uncertain.
[13:02] Genesis 21, uh, one verse says, "For God
[13:06] hath heard thy voice." So, that would be
[13:08] God speaking in was that second person
[13:10] or third person? Uh, I'm not sure. For
[13:13] God heard thy voice. But then, but then
[13:15] the voice says, I will make of him a
[13:17] great nation. So, again, you have the I
[13:19] will. So, it looks like God partially.
[13:22] So, it could have been God in both of
[13:23] them. I'm not certain. I'm just bringing
[13:25] these out because I want everybody to
[13:26] see that there is the angel Lord where
[13:28] it's God himself.
[13:31] Think about that. That's what that's
[13:32] what brother Brennan shared with me on t
[13:34] or Monday night. Uh he shared the verse
[13:36] out of Psalm chapter 8 where it says,
[13:38] "What is man that thou art mindful of
[13:41] him?"
[13:42] &gt;&gt; I mean, what are we that God himself?
[13:45] Now, think about this. Wouldn't send
[13:46] just an angel. He would come himself. I
[13:49] mean what the God of the heaven, the God
[13:51] of the universe would come down to
[13:53] little old Hagar.
[13:55] &gt;&gt; Church, if he do that for her, he'd do
[13:57] it for us. Praise God.
[13:59] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:01] &gt;&gt; Because the Bible said in one numerous
[14:03] cases it the voice of the Lord came out
[14:05] of heaven,
[14:06] &gt;&gt; right? And we know heaven's not far
[14:08] away. It's just in a dimension that's
[14:10] much faster than this dimension.
[14:13] &gt;&gt; It's not far away. The Bible said he's
[14:15] not far away. Right? That's what it says
[14:16] in Acts chapter 17. though he be not far
[14:19] from each one of us. Praise God. Think
[14:21] about that. The heavenly councils and uh
[14:23] oh my, the cloud of witnesses, Hebrews
[14:25] 11, is not far from us. Hallelujah.
[14:28] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[14:28] &gt;&gt; God is not far from us. Amen. It ought
[14:31] to encourage us. Praise God. That God
[14:33] can call out of heaven as an angel and
[14:35] we could hear his voice and he could
[14:37] say, "Rod, Rod." Or, "Samuel, Samuel."
[14:40] Right? Or Chris, Chris, Christopher,
[14:42] Christopher. Or Jesse, Jesse. You know,
[14:45] put your name in there. Each one of us.
[14:46] He could call out of heaven trying to
[14:49] bring some communication, trying to
[14:50] bring some encouragement, trying to
[14:52] bring some strength to his people.
[14:55] &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, with the issue of Balum, this
[14:58] could be u the angel of the Lord as far
[15:01] as it could be God, but it's hard to
[15:03] tell
[15:05] because in numbers 22, we're not going
[15:06] to read all of it. Uh 20 verses 22
[15:09] through35,
[15:10] uh the angel says, "Thy way is perverse
[15:13] before me."
[15:15] Okay. So again, I mean this could be a
[15:17] regular angel like a ministering spirit
[15:19] or it could be the Lord. Uh now in the
[15:22] other cases it was very easy to see like
[15:24] with Joshua. It's very easy to see. He
[15:26] bows down and he worships. And the Bible
[15:28] said the angel didn't stop him from
[15:29] worshiping. Well, that have to be God
[15:31] because angels won't take worship. You
[15:34] see it in the book of Revelation. You
[15:35] see other places in the Bible. An angel
[15:37] will not accept worship.
[15:39] &gt;&gt; Right? So uh in this case it's a little
[15:41] difficult to see. Uh but again I just
[15:43] want you to see how the angel of the
[15:45] Lord came to Balum to try to bring some
[15:48] sense into him.
[15:49] &gt;&gt; Right? I mean church what's amazing too.
[15:52] This is even amazing when the angel of
[15:54] the Lord came the angel of the Lord uh
[15:57] still tried to show him his way was
[15:59] wrong. But when Balam asked what did the
[16:02] angel say? The angel said go ahead and
[16:04] go.
[16:06] So again, the angel must have known from
[16:07] God that he still wanted to go and make
[16:10] the money and try to try to uh cause
[16:13] Israel to stumble.
[16:14] &gt;&gt; So again, it's it's again God's God's
[16:17] mercy. God told him the right way. He
[16:19] turn he wanted but then he wouldn't know
[16:20] a second word. So God gave him over to
[16:22] permissive will. God sends a warning
[16:24] through an angel. Not only an angel, a
[16:26] donkey,
[16:27] right? A donkey speaking trying to show
[16:30] him this is really unusual. And church,
[16:32] we got to look at in our lives. If God
[16:34] does unusual things and and we're not
[16:36] sure on the direction we're going, let's
[16:38] not go that direction. Right.
[16:40] &gt;&gt; Right. There was pain involved. There
[16:41] was animal involved. I mean, all these
[16:43] signs that this was the wrong way to go.
[16:46] &gt;&gt; Right. So, look at supernatural things
[16:49] in your life when they would happen and
[16:51] look at your walk to make sure it's the
[16:53] right walk that you're walking in.
[16:56] &gt;&gt; Okay? Because God here, God sends an
[16:57] angel. Look at this. God sends an angel.
[16:59] And if he would have obeyed, he would
[17:01] not have been slaughtered later on by
[17:02] Moses's army.
[17:04] &gt;&gt; He would have lived longer.
[17:07] &gt;&gt; So, he just missed the warning from the
[17:09] angel of the Lord.
[17:11] All right. Now, Gideon, it looks like
[17:14] Gideon maybe met God in Judges 6:es
[17:17] 11-23
[17:19] because the Bible said, "The Lord said,
[17:21] "Have not I sent thee?"
[17:23] &gt;&gt; Now, Gideon is not connected to any
[17:25] covenant. That's why I'm not sure. So, I
[17:27] don't know if there's always, you know,
[17:28] the angel Lord, God always has to be
[17:30] connected with someone in the covenant
[17:31] or if it could just be outside of the
[17:33] covenant or just part of the covenant,
[17:35] right? But not actually like bringing
[17:37] forth a new covenant uh or something
[17:39] along those lines.
[17:42] Uh and so, yes, and then the Bible says
[17:44] in Judges 6 uh 11 that it says an a an
[17:48] angel, not the angel, an angel of the
[17:50] Lord.
[17:51] &gt;&gt; Okay. And then uh yeah, and then we see
[17:55] that in verse 11 and verse 22. An angel
[17:57] of the Lord, not the angel, the Lord,
[18:00] right? Because there's a great
[18:01] difference between an angel and the
[18:03] angel.
[18:04] &gt;&gt; God as an angel. Okay. Now, Samson's
[18:07] parents, it was likely an angel uh and
[18:09] not God. If you go to Judges 13:16, hun,
[18:13] we can pull that up there. There.
[18:15] And this is why because the angel says,
[18:17] "You must offer this sacrifice unto the
[18:20] Lord." or not, he doesn't say to me.
[18:23] Okay? And the angel lord said unto
[18:24] Monoah, "Though thou detain me, I will
[18:26] not eat of thy bread. And if thou wil
[18:28] offer a burnt offering, thou must offer
[18:30] it unto the Lord." For Monoah knew not
[18:33] that he was an an angel of the Lord.
[18:37] Okay? And so again, there's no covenant
[18:39] coming in here. Uh but Samson was going
[18:41] to be uh to begin getting victory over
[18:45] the Philistines, which David would
[18:47] finish. Hallelujah. Amen. Hallelujah.
[18:51] Um, now the reason I don't think it's
[18:53] actually God because of verse 22. So
[18:56] pull up verse 22. My hardworking
[18:57] daughter
[19:00] because Mo Man Monoah says something
[19:01] that's a little wrong here, right? Uh,
[19:03] just like Eve said something wrong, too.
[19:05] Eve said, "I've gotten a man from the
[19:07] Lord." Well, depends how you take that.
[19:10] He was seed of the serpent, right? But
[19:13] his life had to come from God. But what
[19:15] did Eve think? Eve probably thought Eve
[19:16] probably didn't Eve didn't know he was
[19:18] going to murder the the brother,
[19:21] right? So, she was just saying the best
[19:23] that she knew at that time. I got a man
[19:25] from the Lord. Well, his life was, but
[19:27] his seed was not. I'm talking about his
[19:29] natural seed. And I guess you'd say even
[19:32] a spiritual seed. And Manoah said unto
[19:34] his wife, we shall surely die because
[19:36] we've seen God. Now, did they die,
[19:37] church? No, they didn't die. And can any
[19:40] man see God's invisible spirit? No. You
[19:43] can see a manifestation of God, but you
[19:45] cannot see God,
[19:47] &gt;&gt; right? Okay.
[19:50] And then uh Elijah
[19:54] uh talks to the angel of the Lord in 2
[19:56] Kings 1:3. So let's read that one. And
[19:59] then and then that's as far as I've got
[20:01] as far as searching on the angel of the
[20:03] Lord. That's 2 Kings 1:3.
[20:06] But the angel of the Lord said unto
[20:07] Elijah the Tishbite, "Arise, go up to
[20:08] the meet the messengers of the king of
[20:10] Samaria and say to them,"Is it not
[20:12] because there's not a God in Israel that
[20:14] ye go to inquire of Beaelub, the God of
[20:17] Ech." Think how think how sad this
[20:19] spiritual situation was. The king had
[20:21] fallen sick and instead of going to God
[20:24] and getting his life straightened out,
[20:25] he tries to go to demons to get healing.
[20:27] I mean, how
[20:29] and with your religious heritage, you
[20:32] still choose to go to demons.
[20:34] I mean, just incredibly backslant,
[20:36] incredibly wicked kings, right?
[20:39] &gt;&gt; Even with such a godly heritage, their
[20:41] first choice, oh, I'll try the witch
[20:42] doctor before God. And so God sends the
[20:46] prophet with thus sayith the Lord to
[20:47] tell them what's going to happen. Okay.
[20:49] Now, go down to verse 15, hunt, if you
[20:51] would. Now, I don't see any evidence in
[20:55] this text that this is God himself. So,
[20:57] it just might be uh his angel like
[20:59] brother Ram had his angel. And the angel
[21:02] of the Lord said unto Elijah, "Go down
[21:03] with him. Be not afraid." And he arose
[21:05] and went down with him unto the king. So
[21:07] again, I don't see much evidence where,
[21:08] you know, Elijah's bowing down to
[21:10] worshiping or something like that or
[21:12] God's making a promise. I'll do this.
[21:13] He's talking first person. So again,
[21:16] just a good review there. Okay.
[21:21] Now, how many appreciate that? By God's
[21:22] grace. Now, that's the angel of the
[21:24] Lord. Now, let's review though uh what
[21:27] we just finished with on Sunday because
[21:28] I think I went kind of fast, but let's
[21:30] just pull these up. Uh Psalm 34:7.
[21:33] That was my text for Sunday. The angel
[21:35] of the Lord encampeth round about them
[21:38] that fear him and deliver them.
[21:41] Hallelujah.
[21:42] &gt;&gt; So, anytime you've been delivered, now
[21:44] it could be spirit, it could be
[21:46] spiritual or physically, it was likely
[21:48] an angel, Lord, if not God himself.
[21:51] &gt;&gt; Okay? Anytime you've been delivered. So,
[21:53] I'm looking forward to hear how brother
[21:54] Rod's been delivered on Sunday night.
[21:56] Amen. I've heard some good ones, but I
[21:58] want to hear all of them. Hallelujah.
[22:00] Amen.
[22:02] But anytime, if there's no physical
[22:04] explanation for it, it had to been the
[22:06] angel of the Lord. And angel of the
[22:09] Lord.
[22:10] Uh Psalm 91 11-2, for he shall give his
[22:14] angels charge over thee to keep thee in
[22:17] all thy ways. I love that. What a
[22:19] promise. Amen. In all thy ways. The
[22:22] angel of God is going to be there to
[22:24] protect me unless God's testing me.
[22:27] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. They shall bear thee up in
[22:30] their hands, lest thou dash thy foot
[22:33] against a stone. Amen.
[22:35] &gt;&gt; Now, we've all seen people go through
[22:36] accidents, right? Car says, "And you
[22:38] would think they would die or get
[22:40] injured, but yet they walk out with
[22:41] barely a scrape or anything."
[22:43] &gt;&gt; There's that scripture being fulfilled.
[22:45] Praise God.
[22:47] &gt;&gt; The angels will bear you up and protect
[22:49] you, right? because it's God's promise.
[22:52] Until it's your time to go or be tested,
[22:54] the angels of God are going to step in
[22:56] and deliver you because they've got a
[22:58] charge from God to take care of my
[23:00] children. Praise God. These are the
[23:02] heirs of salvation. These people are
[23:04] coming to heaven. So angels, protect
[23:06] sister. Hallelujah. Amen. Protect sister
[23:08] Naomi. These are my children.
[23:10] Hallelujah.
[23:11] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's right.
[23:14] That's why God sends his angels. Now, uh
[23:17] before the child is born, the angel's
[23:20] waiting to be dispatched right at the
[23:23] birth. Because brother said, the angel,
[23:24] my angel came at my birth.
[23:27] Okay. Uh Matthew 18:10.
[23:30] Take heed that you despise not one of
[23:32] these little ones. For I say unto you
[23:34] that in heaven their angels do always,
[23:36] behold the face of my father which is in
[23:38] heaven. And in first kings the Bible
[23:41] said the whole host of heaven is on the
[23:43] right hand of God and the left hand of
[23:45] God. innumerable angels. Satan only got
[23:47] a third, but God's got twothirds of
[23:50] innumerable angels. Hallelujah. If that
[23:52] if that makes sense. Hallelujah. I'm
[23:54] just using Bible language. Hallelujah.
[23:56] Twothirds of an innumerable number.
[23:59] Well, how can you have two-thirds of
[24:00] innumerable?
[24:01] But you understand. Praise God.
[24:05] And I love this one. This is one I
[24:06] didn't get to, but this refers now here
[24:08] to marriage. So, God ordained the person
[24:11] you'd marry. Okay. So go to uh Genesis
[24:14] 24:7 of course with uh Isaac and
[24:17] Rebecca. Hallelujah. And this is why
[24:21] Eleaser could be so successful and this
[24:23] is why Rebecca acted the way she did
[24:25] because ver verse seven says he shall
[24:28] send his angel before thee. So I thank
[24:30] God God sent an angel so I'd find my
[24:32] wife in a sand pit long jumping in 1998.
[24:38] Hallelujah. God sent his angel before
[24:40] thee, and thou shalt take a wife unto my
[24:43] son from then. In other words, the
[24:44] angel's going to guide you and pick out
[24:46] that special woman or special man. You
[24:49] sisters. Hallelujah. So, God even has
[24:54] angels guiding people for their spouses
[24:57] because God's got to bring about a
[24:59] certain type of child. Amen. With our
[25:01] news from the Larams. Amen. God's got to
[25:03] bring out a certain type of child. God
[25:05] had to bring my wife and I together to
[25:07] produce a song leader. I'm sorry. Well,
[25:09] song leader and musician for our church
[25:11] and drummer, right, Victoria? And organ
[25:14] player, right, Lydia? God's got to put
[25:15] two certain people together because he's
[25:17] got to produce something like that. Or
[25:18] my parents, God to bring my parents
[25:20] together to produce a pastor. Praise
[25:22] God. Hallelujah. Or what? Whatever gifts
[25:25] you have in your life, God put those
[25:27] people together to produce a Christlike
[25:30] character.
[25:32] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:35] Glory.
[25:36] So we can see how all your ways are
[25:40] protected by the angel of the Lord.
[25:43] Hallelujah. And he just don't hang
[25:45] around once in a while. He camps around
[25:47] us.
[25:47] &gt;&gt; Amen.
[25:48] &gt;&gt; And as that one testimony said, he said
[25:50] the brother of the preacher a couple
[25:51] years ago saw the angel step out into a
[25:53] church service and he had his arms
[25:55] crossed. He was watching a preacher to
[25:56] make sure he preached the right thing.
[25:58] And there was a great deliverance
[25:59] afterwards and prayer, repentance, all
[26:01] these things. But the angel stands
[26:03] there. So I wonder if there's an angel
[26:04] watching me tonight. So, I want to be as
[26:06] sincere as I can be by God's grace. I
[26:08] don't want to grieve the Holy Spirit
[26:09] whereby I'm sealed into the day of my
[26:11] redemption.
[26:13] &gt;&gt; I want to accomplish what God wants me
[26:14] to accomplish for this service here
[26:16] tonight.
[26:17] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[26:19] &gt;&gt; All right. Good. Good. On time. Now,
[26:23] let's since we got a few moments here,
[26:24] let because I I kind of know where I
[26:26] want to close, but let's go through a
[26:27] few quotes where brother talks about the
[26:29] angels of God and how people emotionally
[26:32] react to an angel of God. So, this is
[26:34] not where they come unawares. This is
[26:36] when brother notices they're there. Now,
[26:40] we know the Bible says fear. I'm sorry,
[26:42] I'm having trouble seeing some of you.
[26:43] Um, the Bible says fear, but I also want
[26:46] you to know know what other other types
[26:48] of feeling it produces.
[26:50] Hallelujah. Brother man says in 1953 in
[26:53] in Palm Beach, Florida, West Palm Beach
[26:55] rather, he said, "While you're standing
[26:58] here, many of you weeping." So he's in a
[27:01] altar call, "While with tears rolling
[27:03] down your cheeks, that's the Holy
[27:05] Spirit. That's him on you right now just
[27:07] wanting to fill your life." Now
[27:08] remember, there's godly sorrow and
[27:10] worldly sorrow
[27:12] &gt;&gt; because I've seen people cry alligator
[27:14] tears, but it's worldly sorrow. They're
[27:16] sorry they got caught. They got no plans
[27:18] to change. Yeah.
[27:20] &gt;&gt; I'm not talking about those type of
[27:21] tears. I'm talking about real tears like
[27:23] I'm going to be different.
[27:26] &gt;&gt; My life is going to look different after
[27:28] this.
[27:29] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[27:31] &gt;&gt; That's the Holy Spirit. That's him on
[27:33] you right now. So the Holy Spirit
[27:36] anoints somebody's human spirit or maybe
[27:37] their soul and they start weeping.
[27:41] He just wants to fill your life. If the
[27:43] audience back there can only see these
[27:45] who's standing here, these young ladies,
[27:46] young men, elderly people, tears just
[27:49] rolling down their cheeks. The Holy
[27:50] Spirit is hovered here. Here's an angel
[27:53] of God standing right here. It isn't
[27:55] five feet above their head right now.
[27:57] The very angel you see on the picture
[27:59] standing right here above them right
[28:00] now, just ready to pour himself into
[28:03] every believer. Praise God.
[28:05] &gt;&gt; He said, "I see him. He's five feet." So
[28:08] what's five feet? One, two, three, four,
[28:11] five. So the angel would be here,
[28:12] brother Ram would be here. He's five
[28:14] feet away, right here. And he's making
[28:17] everybody cry
[28:20] &gt;&gt; because of his holy presence. And the
[28:21] church said,
[28:23] &gt;&gt; "So see the church, that's why, you
[28:25] know, we don't major on emotion." But if
[28:27] we don't see emotion for a while,
[28:28] something's wrong because the angels of
[28:30] God are here to change our hearts, to
[28:32] deliver us. Amen.
[28:36] And that's why, you know, I look back
[28:37] now and I look at where God sent my wife
[28:39] and I, he sent us to brother Brooks's
[28:40] church. Of all the churches in that
[28:42] area, that was the one that welcomed
[28:44] emotion the most. Now, emotion doesn't
[28:47] always prove it's God. But when God
[28:50] comes, there's emotion. Hallelujah.
[28:52] That's what Brother Ham says, right?
[28:54] &gt;&gt; He said, "Don't look for emotion, but
[28:55] emotion's going to come with it."
[28:58] Hallelujah.
[29:02] He said, 'N now just believe it. Ask him
[29:04] and just accept it. Say, 'Lord, I
[29:05] believe you. And then you'll know when
[29:07] it comes, you'll feel the spirit of God
[29:09] pouring into your heart. And what what
[29:10] are they doing? They're crying. Oh,
[29:12] something's on me. Some Something's
[29:14] poured on me. That's why I'm crying.
[29:15] Something's happening to me. I'm feeling
[29:18] something. He says, then when you do
[29:20] when you feel that and you're crying,
[29:22] then he says, raise your hands and thank
[29:24] him for it. Amen. So, if you're crying
[29:26] and something's happening on the inside,
[29:28] you feel like you're breaking up or
[29:29] being filled up, just raise your hand
[29:31] and say, "Thank you, God. Thank you,
[29:32] God. You're wonderful." Like the day of
[29:34] Pentecost. Oh, God, you do wonderful
[29:36] works. Hallelujah.
[29:38] &gt;&gt; That's the angel of the Lord.
[29:39] Hallelujah.
[29:41] &gt;&gt; Say, "Thank you, Jesus. I'm so grateful
[29:43] that you give me the baptism of the Holy
[29:45] Ghost." And you'll feel the power of God
[29:48] surge through your body. You'll be a
[29:50] different person from that time on.
[29:53] Amen. How could you get in the presence
[29:55] of an angel and not be changed? The only
[29:57] way that'd be is a balum experience.
[29:59] &gt;&gt; Because he got in the presence of angel
[30:01] without being changed.
[30:03] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[30:04] &gt;&gt; In other words, he basically fought
[30:06] through the angel. Say, I'll just do
[30:07] what I want to do. I want to get paid.
[30:10] How sad is that? Goodness gracious.
[30:14] In 1955, Brother Ram says, "Have faith
[30:17] in God. Little lady sitting out there a
[30:20] weeping kind of heavy set looking
[30:22] towards me." Now that's the angel Lord
[30:24] standing over her. So she's in sitting
[30:26] down and an angel standing right over
[30:28] her.
[30:32] Can't you see that audience? Here's a
[30:34] prophet saying, "Can't you see that? Uh
[30:36] if I'm not a prophet, I don't know if I
[30:38] can see that." But for brother, it was
[30:40] just so so common and so supernatural.
[30:42] Can't you see that? Goodness. I wish I
[30:44] could. Amen. Look, standing right here.
[30:46] Can't you see that light hanging over
[30:48] her? Right over here. Now, the woman
[30:50] came. I can't heal her, but she has
[30:52] gallbladder trouble that she wants to be
[30:54] healed of. That's right, isn't it? And
[30:56] if you believe you can be healed. That's
[30:57] right. God bless you, sir. So, an angel
[31:00] comes and stands right over top of you
[31:02] and you're weeping and crying, saying,
[31:04] "God, I need my gallbladder healed." Or,
[31:06] "God, I need to heal from this. I need
[31:07] heal from that." An angel will come and
[31:09] stand right there to bring you
[31:11] deliverance. And you just got to say,
[31:12] "Thank you, Lord, for it."
[31:14] &gt;&gt; See, don't doubt it. Say, "This
[31:16] emotion's coming because God's doing
[31:17] something for me. God's here. God wants
[31:20] to deliver me. Praise God.
[31:23] &gt;&gt; That's what they're sent for. For those
[31:25] that would be heirs of salvation, to
[31:28] minister to your need at that time.
[31:31] &gt;&gt; So, hold Well, yeah. Take your Bibles.
[31:33] Hebrews 1, I think. He Hebrews 1:7, if
[31:35] I'm not mistaken, let's just review
[31:36] that.
[31:41] Twice in this chapter. It calls them
[31:43] ministering spirits. Hebrews 1:7. and of
[31:46] his angels he saith who maketh his
[31:48] angels spirits and his ministers a flame
[31:51] of fire. That's why brother Ram said,
[31:53] "See that pillar of fire? It was above
[31:55] the heavy set woman and it turned into
[31:57] an angel." Hallelujah. Standing there.
[32:00] Hallelujah. And that's what Billy Paul
[32:02] said. Billy Billy Paul said he saw the
[32:04] man sitting there 200 lb, black hair
[32:06] down. Uh and then he said he vanished
[32:09] out of like he dissolved and then there
[32:11] was the rainbow there for half an hour
[32:12] afterwards.
[32:15] So you see they can change form of
[32:16] course. Okay. Now verse uh 14, he says,
[32:21] "Are they not all ministering?" Why
[32:24] would God send you the angel to minister
[32:26] to your need?
[32:28] &gt;&gt; Church, God, don't leave us alone. God
[32:31] God's not trying to give man's help.
[32:32] God's trying to give supernatural help.
[32:35] &gt;&gt; Amen. That's why they're sent, the angel
[32:37] of God is sent to give help to his
[32:40] people. Hallelujah.
[32:42] He says, "They're sent forth to minister
[32:45] for them who shall be heirs of
[32:47] salvation." So, thank you, Lord, for
[32:49] protecting me from the car accident.
[32:51] That's just another proof that I'm going
[32:53] to be saved. Hallelujah. Amen. And you
[32:55] put your testimony in there. Thank God.
[32:57] That's just another proof I'm a child of
[32:59] God. Hallelujah.
[33:01] &gt;&gt; Amen. Then if you don't deliver me,
[33:04] well, then the Lord gives and the Lord
[33:05] takes away. Blessed be the name of the
[33:07] Lord. Praise God.
[33:10] Next in 55 again. Do you believe,
[33:12] sister? Do you believe that God would
[33:14] heal you? Sitting there weeping. You had
[33:17] ulcers, but the Lord Jesus made you well
[33:19] right then. Isn't that it? Stand up on
[33:20] your feet. This lady sitting right over
[33:22] here with her white coat on. An angel of
[33:24] God was around where she was at, and
[33:27] you're healed now. Your ulcers won't
[33:29] bother you no more. It doesn't remind
[33:32] you of of the waters that was troubled
[33:34] by the angel in John chapter 5. Doesn't
[33:36] it remind you of that? The angel's there
[33:38] troubling you. But I'll say like this.
[33:40] It's troubling your spirit. Amen. It
[33:42] might not trouble the waters, but it's
[33:44] changing your awareness and you're
[33:46] getting emotional. And brother said,
[33:48] "That's your sign. Believe it. Thank God
[33:50] for it. The angel's healed to heal you,
[33:52] heal you, and deliver you. Praise God.
[33:55] &gt;&gt; From ulcers."
[33:57] &gt;&gt; So gallbladder trouble, ulcers, the
[34:00] angel of God comes down to give you a
[34:02] touch and a deliverance.
[34:05] Hallelujah.
[34:09] Brother Brandon talks about the next
[34:10] person. This was an elderly women woman
[34:13] all crippled up. He says, "And she was
[34:17] down there at front at the altar.
[34:20] She was the last of the cot cases."
[34:23] Brothers and sisters, you can see
[34:24] pictures. Brother had all the people in
[34:26] CS right up in the front row. Now, not
[34:28] everybody got healed, just like with
[34:30] Jesus. Jesus didn't heal everybody all
[34:31] the time. Now, sometimes he did, but not
[34:33] all the time. But this woman was in a
[34:34] cot.
[34:37] He says, "Uh, last night when the
[34:38] service started, she'd been sitting
[34:40] there for a few nights watching me. She
[34:41] was weeping and crying. And I turned to
[34:43] her and I said, I seen where her trouble
[34:46] was and what it started. The thing but
[34:48] the thing of her accepting enough faith.
[34:50] So the woman wouldn't accept the faith.
[34:53] Brother said, "She's crying, but she
[34:55] wouldn't accept it." The angel Lord
[34:58] settled down on her, but then she would
[35:00] think, "Oh, I'm too bad."
[35:02] So God's trying to heal her of
[35:04] arthritis, but she won't accept it. Oh,
[35:06] this couldn't happen to me. I'm just a
[35:08] bad person.
[35:10] And Ram said it went on for multiple
[35:12] nights. Talk about mercy. Hallelujah.
[35:15] Talk about God's grace. God God so
[35:18] determined to deliver his children.
[35:20] Praise God.
[35:21] &gt;&gt; He won't give up if you don't accept it
[35:23] the first night of the service or the
[35:25] first week or whatever. He'll keep
[35:27] dealing with you because God is love.
[35:29] Hallelujah. Amen.
[35:31] &gt;&gt; She said, "I'm too bad." And he said it
[35:33] would move up again. So the angel, I'll
[35:35] just use you. The angel would go down
[35:38] and she wouldn't accept it. And the
[35:40] angel would come down again the next
[35:41] night and she wouldn't accept it. Just
[35:43] coming back and forth. My parents said,
[35:45] "I told you to accept it." He says,
[35:50] "And the angel would settle down and
[35:51] then she would think, oh, I'm too bad.
[35:52] Move out again." I couldn't call her
[35:54] because it just wasn't time to call her.
[35:56] I spoke to her two or three times. Then
[35:58] after a while, the meeting had a journ.
[36:00] Now listen, everybody leaves the meeting
[36:02] and she's still there on the cot
[36:07] and had been standing here for a few
[36:09] minutes. So she got arthritis standing
[36:10] there at the altar. She said she felt
[36:12] something real warm or tingling through
[36:15] her body. She gets up out of her
[36:17] wheelchair and goes on home, pushing her
[36:19] wheelchair home last night. Thanks be to
[36:22] the Lord Jesus who gives us the victory
[36:24] through our Lord Jesus Christ. We're
[36:25] grateful for that, aren't we? and we
[36:27] thank him. So, I like that she she's
[36:30] just stayed there praying and then
[36:32] finally she's able to accept it. So, I
[36:34] wonder if there was evil spirits in the
[36:35] congregation that wouldn't let her
[36:36] accept it or if it was just her mind
[36:38] battle, right? Because because of
[36:40] unbelief, many people can't get healed.
[36:43] &gt;&gt; But after everybody's adjourned, she
[36:45] stays there, keeps waiting on God, God
[36:47] heals her, and then she pushes her own
[36:49] wheelchair out of the service. Amen.
[36:51] Thank God for the power of God, church.
[36:53] Let's believe in the supernatural
[36:55] workings of God. Amen.
[36:59] Now here brother man says in 1956
[37:04] he says uh he says look on us like Peter
[37:06] and John said you know that's just
[37:08] giving me your attention just a moment
[37:09] cuz you're standing there weeping and I
[37:12] don't want you to weep but you can't
[37:13] help it just now because you feel a real
[37:16] meek humble feeling for the angel of God
[37:20] he says is not here by me it's over by
[37:24] you
[37:26] say brother I'm trying not to her to cry
[37:28] so much and just realize that it's the
[37:30] presence of the angel trying to heal her
[37:33] and that's the reason you're feeling
[37:35] that way. So, she's weeping and crying,
[37:38] feeling real humble, like humble like
[37:40] I'm nothing. I'm nobody. Oh, who am I?
[37:43] Look how great God is. How many know we
[37:45] need to feel that some more by God's
[37:46] grace?
[37:47] &gt;&gt; Not how great, how strong, how talented,
[37:49] how handsome or pretty I am, but just
[37:51] humble. I'm nothing. I'm trusting in
[37:53] God. Only God could do this. And the
[37:55] angel leaves brother Brandham and goes
[37:57] stands by the woman so God can heal her.
[38:00] Hallelujah.
[38:02] &gt;&gt; But it's a real meek, humble feeling and
[38:05] made her cry.
[38:08] &gt;&gt; Church, that's what we got to learn,
[38:09] especially if we're young believers. We
[38:10] got to learn how to yield our emotions
[38:12] to the Holy Spirit.
[38:15] &gt;&gt; And church, you know this. The reason
[38:16] many times we can't give God emotions,
[38:18] we're giving emotions to other things,
[38:21] &gt;&gt; right? The reason you're not hungry when
[38:23] you're when you get home and your wife's
[38:24] got a good meal is because you ate
[38:26] before you got home.
[38:27] &gt;&gt; Right.
[38:30] &gt;&gt; But if you hunger and thirst for
[38:32] righteousness, you shall be filled. I
[38:34] saw a good meme. Maybe I'll send it to
[38:35] the church, but I saw a good meme. It
[38:36] says, "The reason you don't crave more
[38:38] of God is because you're too busy
[38:40] enjoying yourself and enjoying and
[38:42] loving yourself, enjoying everything
[38:44] about yourself.
[38:46] You crave things for yourself." But the
[38:48] Bible said we should crave the things of
[38:50] God. Blessed are those who hunger and
[38:52] thirst for after righteousness. They
[38:54] shall be filled.
[38:56] &gt;&gt; Now, I didn't read that exact. I didn't
[38:57] quote that exactly right, but maybe I'll
[38:59] send that to the church. You might like
[39:01] that.
[39:03] 1956 again,
[39:06] he says, "I want everyone with their
[39:08] heads bowed." Now, I'm not saying that
[39:09] myself. That's what brother said.
[39:12] Won't you just come up here and stand
[39:13] here at the altar?
[39:15] Let's while we pray, while the love of
[39:17] God is right around here moving around
[39:19] this building. What an atmosphere. This
[39:20] is an atmosphere that I wish I could
[39:22] live in forever. The sweet humble
[39:23] feeling. How many could say amen to
[39:25] that?
[39:25] &gt;&gt; So, some services you never want to
[39:27] leave. It's just like, why is this got
[39:28] to end? Oh, I just feel like I'm in
[39:30] heaven. I feel like there's no trials
[39:32] here. It's the angels of God that are
[39:34] with us.
[39:35] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. It's a heavenly
[39:38] atmosphere. We're seated in heavenly
[39:40] places in Christ Jesus.
[39:44] &gt;&gt; Oh, I wish I could live here forever.
[39:45] The sweet humble feeling. What is it?
[39:47] Angels are walking up and down the
[39:49] aisles all around these posts around
[39:51] this tent on the outside. Angels are
[39:53] moving their great wings spread. That's
[39:55] what makes you feel that way. You don't
[39:58] like this. I'm sorry. You don't feel
[39:59] like this all the time. You don't see
[40:01] nothing. And you're different from when
[40:03] you walked in here a while ago, but I
[40:05] feel it. I'm conscious of it.
[40:08] &gt;&gt; So man could see angels walking up and
[40:11] down the aisles. He saw their wings
[40:13] spread. Hallelujah. And people are
[40:17] visibly meek, humble spirit, not like,
[40:21] "Oh, what am I going to do after church?
[40:24] Oh, how can I pull that deal off
[40:25] tomorrow?
[40:26] &gt;&gt; Oh, we're not going to watch that
[40:27] tomorrow. Am I going to get on a chance
[40:29] to watch that tomorrow?" It's no, it's
[40:32] like heaven is here. Praise God. Amen.
[40:34] God Spear's here and I'm fully
[40:36] interested in what God is doing here
[40:38] tonight. Praise God.
[40:42] &gt;&gt; It's a humble feeling.
[40:45] Now, uh, next one. 57. I don't mean to
[40:49] be a baby, brother said, to weep. So,
[40:50] brother would cry numerous times on the
[40:52] tapes. But just something about the Holy
[40:53] Spirit that makes you not weep for
[40:56] sorrows, but for joy.
[40:58] Just something springs forth. Think how
[41:00] the angels must be rejoicing now. How
[41:03] many feels real, real good in your soul?
[41:05] Would you just raise your hands to God?
[41:06] Oh my. I wonder if we could just sing
[41:08] once more as we did last night. I will
[41:10] praise him. I will praise him. So, the
[41:11] Holy Spirit made them weep for joy. And
[41:13] brother said, "I know the angels are
[41:15] rejoicing when people get saved." The
[41:17] Bible said the angels re there's
[41:19] rejoicing in the presence of angels when
[41:21] one sinner repents.
[41:26] Hallelujah.
[41:28] What says in 1963,
[41:31] he says,
[41:33] he says, "And the things that you don't
[41:35] know nothing about now, you see it
[41:37] plainly when you cross over there."
[41:39] Talking about into heaven. You don't
[41:41] understand it now because you're bumping
[41:43] into us. And brother says, "We bump into
[41:45] heaven." In other words, angels come and
[41:48] visit us. We bump into certain feelings.
[41:51] We bump into meekness. We bump into
[41:53] emotions sometimes. And oh my, it's just
[41:55] so holy. Uh it's just so I'm
[41:58] overwhelmed. Brother said, "We just bump
[42:00] into Aren't you glad God bumps into you
[42:02] sometimes?"
[42:04] Praise God. Amen.
[42:07] He said, "You just bump into it. You
[42:10] haven't got that sense. You say, "I feel
[42:13] a strange feeling here tonight. Looks to
[42:15] me like I just want to cry or shout or
[42:19] something." It's the angels of the Lord.
[42:23] &gt;&gt; So when you feel like crying, when you
[42:25] feel like shouting, when you feel really
[42:27] humble, really meek, it's the angels of
[42:30] God that are here to bring deliverance.
[42:33] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah.
[42:36] And we could go for some. You know, this
[42:37] year I haven't been writing down as many
[42:39] testimonies I've had in years past. I'm
[42:41] not sounding the red alarms, but I'm
[42:43] just saying we're due for a a
[42:45] supernatural miracle. Praise God.
[42:47] &gt;&gt; We're due for a visit of the angels, but
[42:50] we also got to be living in a way that
[42:52] the angels can visit us. Hallelujah.
[42:55] &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. That's right.
[42:58] Okay, now I'm about time. I got to get
[42:59] closing here. By God's grace, I'll save
[43:02] this one. That's a really good quote for
[43:04] uh
[43:06] uh for Sunday. Lord willing. Lord
[43:08] willing. We'll see. Okay. Okay. Put up
[43:10] uh First Kings 19:1. I'm going to close
[43:12] with Elijah. I just love this story.
[43:14] Many preachers have used it, of course.
[43:15] Many, many, many, many preachers. Not
[43:17] sure how often I've used it. So, maybe
[43:19] it'll feel fresh to you tonight. I trust
[43:21] the angels will make it feel fresh.
[43:22] Hallelujah. And Ahab told Jezebel all
[43:25] that Elijah had done on Mount Carmel.
[43:27] And with all how he had slain all the
[43:29] prophets with the sword, all those
[43:31] antichrist prophets, he killed him.
[43:35] Then Jezebel sent a messenger to Elijah,
[43:36] saying, "So let the gods do to me and
[43:39] even more also if I make not thy life as
[43:42] a life of one of them by tomorrow about
[43:45] this time." He just slayed. Some people
[43:46] say 450, some say over 600 because
[43:49] there's two different numbers like 400
[43:50] and 450. Some say 850,
[43:53] but uh at the least 400, at the medium
[43:57] 450.
[43:58] They slew 450 false prophets. And Elijah
[44:02] saw fire down from heaven. And he saw
[44:04] all this in advance like a prophecy. He
[44:08] saw future declared before him and then
[44:10] saw it come to pass.
[44:12] &gt;&gt; And from the threat of one woman,
[44:16] he wants to die.
[44:20] Now, don't raise your hands, but can
[44:21] anybody relate to that? Going from being
[44:23] on a mountaintop so confident, so
[44:26] victorious
[44:28] to being afraid, and wanting to die in
[44:30] this life to end. I wish it was over,
[44:32] Brother Jess.
[44:34] Well, didn't you have a great testimony
[44:35] last week? Now, you can say the same
[44:37] thing about me.
[44:39] Same thing. Going from mountaintop
[44:41] straight down to the valley.
[44:44] No wonder some people don't like roller
[44:46] coasters.
[44:48] Elijah Elijah was on a roller coaster as
[44:51] high as you could go. Thus sayith the
[44:52] Lord, this come to pass fire from
[44:54] heaven, burn up a watery sacrifice
[44:56] straight down to the valley.
[44:59] How How can I exit here? Where where's
[45:01] the exit uh room here? I need to leave
[45:03] this life.
[45:05] And when he saw that, he arose and went
[45:07] for his life. I'm running for my life.
[45:10] Wait, wait. God just set fire, killed
[45:13] 450 men, and you're afraid of one woman.
[45:16] Of course, she's got she's got soldiers,
[45:18] right? But he just saw God stand up and
[45:22] say, "I'm the God of Elijah.
[45:25] I vindicate my prophets with fire." But
[45:28] the one threat, one threat for his life
[45:32] caused him to want to die.
[45:36] He went to Beersa, which belonged to
[45:39] Judah, and left his servant there. But
[45:40] he himself went a day's journey into the
[45:42] wilderness and came and sat down under a
[45:43] juniper tree and he requested for
[45:45] himself that he might die. So before
[45:47] he's got thus sayith the Lord today is
[45:48] like Lord can I please die.
[45:53] Would you please take me home? Now the
[45:55] whole army's hunting me down. She swore
[45:58] she's going to do this. God, please take
[46:00] me home. I'm hiding out. Think about
[46:02] that. I'm hiding out in the wilderness
[46:04] trying to get off the grid.
[46:07] People try to do that today.
[46:10] and said, "It is enough. I've had enough
[46:12] of this life. I I've I've seen enough. I
[46:14] just want to go home.
[46:18] Oh, now Lord, take away my life for I'm
[46:21] not better than my fathers." Now, he
[46:23] gets real humble.
[46:25] Um, right? He got real humble after a
[46:27] threat about his life. He finds this. I
[46:31] I just want it to be over. How can this
[46:33] be over? Lord, you take my life.
[46:36] Verse five. And as he lay and slept
[46:40] under a juniper tree, behold, then an
[46:42] angel touched him and said unto him,
[46:44] "Arise and eat." Church, this is about
[46:47] as low as Elijah ever got.
[46:50] All the miracles, you know, for three
[46:51] and a half years, you know, he had he
[46:53] was fed by ravens and then he was there
[46:55] with the woman with the the cruise of
[46:56] oil and the flower just kept multiplying
[46:59] miracle after miracle after miracle
[47:02] seeing Mount Carmel. But here's as low
[47:05] as he possibly can get. In his moment of
[47:07] distress, what does God send? God sends
[47:09] a ministering spirit to strengthen his
[47:12] servant in his darkest hour. Amen.
[47:15] Because Elijah would be an heir of
[47:17] salvation. Hallelujah. Praise God.
[47:20] Elijah would be uh uh he would be the
[47:23] man that God would say, and brother says
[47:25] it, I love his obedient spirit so much,
[47:28] I'm going to use it four more times.
[47:31] &gt;&gt; Imagine that. You live such a life
[47:32] before God. God said, "I'm gonna have
[47:34] four more people live just like you
[47:36] because of your obedience to my word."
[47:39] &gt;&gt; And that obedient man said, "Lord, I'd
[47:41] like to I'd like this to be over. This
[47:44] is enough of the life that we're this is
[47:46] enough of Leodysia. Can I say it like
[47:47] that? I've had enough of Leodysia.
[47:50] &gt;&gt; I'd have enough of the government. I've
[47:51] had enough of all these things. Lord,
[47:52] this is enough."
[47:54] And instead of that, God sends him an
[47:56] angel to touch him.
[47:59] Hallelujah.
[48:01] And he looked, and behold, there was a
[48:03] cake, not a birthday cake, children.
[48:05] Bacon on the coals. God will only give
[48:08] him a healthy cake. Hallelujah. And a
[48:10] cruise of water at his head. So he wakes
[48:12] up. There's a cake of bread. Bread and
[48:14] water.
[48:16] Hallelujah.
[48:18] And he did eat and drink and laid him
[48:20] down again. Now church, God's not done
[48:23] yet. That's this is this is why it's so
[48:25] awesome. God touches him, gives him
[48:27] food, and said, "You know, you've slept
[48:29] once. I'm gonna give you a second nap.
[48:32] Isn't that God's grace? Talk about
[48:33] grace. Grace. Amen. Hallelujah. With the
[48:35] headstone, it comes out with grace.
[48:37] Grace unto it. God doesn't give him one
[48:40] nap in a meal. God said, "You need a
[48:42] double nap and a double meal."
[48:46] Hallelujah. Brother Ram said he Brother
[48:47] Ram said he looked at all the angels
[48:49] said, "Who's got the softest hands?" Can
[48:50] I feel your hands, brother? Who's got
[48:52] the softest hands? Oh, there's a few
[48:53] calluses there. Okay, those are pretty
[48:56] soft, brother. How about you? You got
[48:59] the softest hands. God said, "I'm
[49:01] sending you. My servant is now." God's
[49:04] not serious like me, but God's like, "My
[49:06] servant wants to die. You with the
[49:08] softest hands. You go touch my servant.
[49:11] He's got more work to do. His ministry
[49:13] is not over. He's He's got a furtherment
[49:15] of his ministry." That's what God told
[49:17] Brother. "Your ministry is not over.
[49:19] You're not going to die. You've got a
[49:20] further work. Go touch my servant. Lay
[49:23] your hand on him and he'll receive
[49:25] strength."
[49:27] He says, "Yes, Lord." He goes down
[49:30] there. He touches Elijah. Elijah wakes
[49:33] up.
[49:35] Oh, I'm tired again. I need another nap.
[49:41] Sound like a good day off, don't it,
[49:42] brothers and sisters?
[49:44] But this is a supernatural day.
[49:48] And verse seven, this is what I love
[49:49] about God. And the angel Lord came again
[49:51] the second time and touched him and
[49:53] said, "Arise and eat, because the
[49:55] journey is too great for thee." And he
[49:58] arose and did eat and drink and went the
[50:00] strength of that meat 40 days and 40
[50:04] nights unto Horeb, the mount of God.
[50:08] Hallelujah. So we see he gets touched
[50:11] twice. Hallelujah. And the church said,
[50:14] &gt;&gt; "God just had God had more than one
[50:16] blessing, brother Rod." Amen. God's got
[50:18] more than one experience for you. God's
[50:20] got more than you need. Hallelujah.
[50:23] &gt;&gt; And God proves here whatever you have
[50:25] need of in the time of your distress, if
[50:27] it's God's plan, he'll touch you. He'll
[50:29] strengthen you to get through that. And
[50:31] he'll give you whatever else you need to
[50:34] last you for the remainder part of the
[50:36] next season of your life. Hallelujah.
[50:39] &gt;&gt; It doesn't have to be the end. It
[50:41] doesn't have to be fear about the
[50:42] future.
[50:44] In this case, look what he does. He goes
[50:45] and gets alone with God. Hallelujah. You
[50:47] got just like uh just like numerous
[50:49] people in the Bible, go get alone with
[50:51] God. Spend time alone with God and then
[50:54] God will touch you and he'll give you a
[50:56] spiritual touch that you need to get you
[50:58] through the next season of your life.
[51:00] And God gives him a double blessing
[51:02] because he's an obedient spirit.
[51:04] &gt;&gt; So church, the question is your guardian
[51:07] angel is here tonight. If you need a
[51:09] touch from God, how many need a touch
[51:11] from God? Hallelujah. Let's stand to our
[51:13] feet. Musicians can come. Let's see the
[51:16] great physician now is near the
[51:17] sympathizing Jesus.
[51:20] Brother Ram said God always sends his
[51:22] warnings just before the coming of
[51:23] Jesus. He sent an angel down out of
[51:25] heaven by the name of Gabriel. Now minor
[51:27] angels comes. Yes, you see angels.
[51:30] Everyone has a guardian angel according
[51:32] to the scripture. Jesus said there are
[51:34] angels always beholds my father's face
[51:37] which is in heaven. Huh? Everybody.
[51:39] Let's say everybody. Ready? Everybody.
[51:42] Everybody here has an angel. that is set
[51:46] to help you
[51:47] to deliver you. Hallelujah. To deliver
[51:50] you when you need a deliverance. In this
[51:53] case, he needed a spiritual deliverance,
[51:55] right? And physical. He didn't want to
[51:57] die. But his spirit was so defeated. He
[52:00] thought, "This is enough. I'm no better
[52:02] than my father's. I want to die. Lord,
[52:04] can you take me home?"
[52:07] Yet God in his fatherly hallelujah. His
[52:10] heavenly father love says it's says,
[52:11] "It's not the end, Elijah. you got more
[52:14] work to do for the kingdom of God.
[52:16] &gt;&gt; And church, if you feel like your
[52:17] strength is weak, don't be discouraged.
[52:19] Cry out to God and say, "God, I need
[52:21] spiritual strength for my journey."
[52:25] And church, you remember you run uh you
[52:27] run this through the text. God gave him
[52:29] great supernatural strength even in
[52:30] physical running, right? He ran he
[52:33] outran chariots, church. He runs out of
[52:36] a wilderness and then outruns chariots.
[52:39] A man outrunning horses. Hallelujah.
[52:41] Praise God. It's the strength of
[52:43] almighty God. So if God has all that,
[52:46] can he get you through the next couple
[52:47] weeks or the next month? Can he get you
[52:49] through the next year?
[52:51] &gt;&gt; How about the next 10 years? Could God
[52:52] get you through another decade?
[52:54] &gt;&gt; If the Lord carries,
[52:58] &gt;&gt; God can do it. And church, his angels
[53:00] are here to do it. Praise God. His
[53:02] angels are here to do it. We can't do it
[53:05] of ourselves, but God's angels are here
[53:07] to deliver his people. Let's pray.
[53:10] Father God, thank you, Lord, for these
[53:12] scriptures promising your faithfulness,
[53:14] Lord God. Lord, it was such an
[53:16] encouragement when I heard that preached
[53:17] and I went and read it myself.
[53:20] You just didn't give him a little bit.
[53:22] Yes, you did. But then you let him get a
[53:23] rest. You woke Elijah up again, says,
[53:26] "Now, I'm going to give you a double
[53:27] portion. But this portion is going to
[53:30] give you such strength. It will keep you
[53:32] for quite a long time in your next
[53:35] season of ministry."
[53:37] Hallelujah. Lord, we can't do it on our
[53:40] own. Lord God, Elijah couldn't do it on
[53:42] his own. Oh God, he had to have the
[53:45] supernatural strength of your angel
[53:48] because an angel brings the presence of
[53:50] the Lord. According to Isaiah, the angel
[53:53] of his presence,
[53:56] Father, your people didn't come here in
[53:58] vain tonight, Lord. I don't know who
[53:59] needs deliverance. I don't know who
[54:00] needs courage or strength, but Lord,
[54:03] your angel is here. And Lord, I pray the
[54:05] angels would walk around us. Lord God,
[54:07] let us know. maybe stand over us, Lord
[54:09] God. Stand right over us. And Lord, at
[54:11] that moment, we wouldn't say, "Oh, I'm
[54:13] too bad of a person or I messed up or
[54:15] I'm Lord, may we confess our sins and
[54:16] just say, "Thank you, Lord Jesus. Let
[54:18] your spirit fill me. Let your spirit
[54:20] anoint me. Let your I receive the
[54:22] strength. Thank you for your strength."
[54:24] Amen. Thank you for your power. Thank
[54:26] you for your your new vision. Thank you
[54:28] for a renewed mind. Hallelujah. May we
[54:31] have that type of understanding here
[54:32] tonight, Lord. Some may be more
[54:35] emotional than others. I call myself a
[54:36] crybaby. But Lord, we see from the
[54:40] scripture clearly when the angels are
[54:42] recognized, humans have emotions. Lord,
[54:45] we are emotional to the presence of God.
[54:48] Hallelujah. Praise God. The Bible said
[54:51] they spoke in tongues and magnified the
[54:53] Lord. Hallelujah. They had great
[54:55] boldness. The Bible says when the Holy
[54:57] Ghost fell in the book of Acts, Lord
[54:59] God. So we know do the same today. that
[55:02] elderly wal arthritis, she had boldness
[55:05] to push her wheelchair out of the
[55:07] congregation. Hallelujah.
[55:09] And say, "I'm healed. I'm healed." The
[55:11] angel of God was standing by me. He came
[55:14] to me night after night until I was
[55:16] ready to receive it. Thank God for the
[55:18] mercy of God that we feel in our lives,
[55:20] Lord Jesus.
[55:23] Lord, we know you're here. The great
[55:24] physician now is near, the sympathizing
[55:27] Jesus. Father, forgive our sins, Lord
[55:30] God. Lord, that we won't have to say,
[55:32] "Well, I'm too bad or I don't deserve a
[55:34] touch or I don't deserve a deliverance."
[55:35] Who does? No one does. Lord God, Elijah
[55:38] didn't deserve it. He wanted to die. He
[55:41] wanted to be over. He's running from a
[55:43] woman. We'd say, running from a
[55:46] government,
[55:48] but yet, Lord, you were merciful to him.
[55:50] You have pity upon your children, Lord
[55:52] God. So, Father, may we recognize your
[55:54] presence here tonight. We thank you for
[55:57] your mercy and love, Lord. Now I pray
[55:59] you'd meet your people's needs. These
[56:01] Lord I look I would lift my hands to
[56:03] these. These are the heirs of salvation.
[56:06] These are the saved and accurate Lord
[56:07] that we would believe Lord God. No doubt
[56:10] there's more but these are the heirs of
[56:12] salvation that's when within the voice
[56:15] or the sound of the voice here tonight
[56:17] in this service Lord God. And that
[56:19] believe in a deeper life of the Holy
[56:21] Ghost. Not just justification, not just
[56:24] sanctification, not just gifts of the
[56:26] Holy Spirit, but the person of Jesus
[56:28] Christ in the full baptism of the Holy
[56:30] Ghost like they had on the day of
[56:31] Pentecost. Lord God, hallelujah. Here
[56:35] are the heirs of your salvation. Lord, I
[56:37] pray you'd meet their needs in Jesus
[56:39] Christ's
