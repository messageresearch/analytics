[0:00] you know in america we stand for the
[0:02] pledge of allegiance
[0:04] we stand for the national land for the
[0:06] singing of the national
[0:07] anthem and i believe we can truly stand
[0:09] for the reading of the word of the lord
[0:10] amen
[0:12] amen it has way more importance to me
[0:14] than a flag
[0:16] amen genesis the third chapter of the
[0:18] 15th verse
[0:19] then also we're going to read from
[0:21] matthew the 13th chapter
[0:23] i want to just just get a little
[0:25] scriptural foundation this morning for
[0:27] the message i'd like to speak upon
[0:29] genesis the third chapter verse 15
[0:33] and i will put enmity between thee and
[0:35] the woman
[0:37] and between thy seed and her sea
[0:40] and it shall bruise thy head and thou
[0:42] shalt bruise
[0:44] his heel now let's turn to matthew the
[0:46] 13th chapter
[0:52] matthew 13 verses 24 to 30.
[1:04] another parable put he forth unto them
[1:06] saying the kingdom of heaven is like
[1:08] unto a man which sowed good seed in his
[1:10] field
[1:11] but while men slept his enemy came and
[1:14] sowed tares
[1:14] among the wheat and went his way but
[1:18] when the blade was sprung up and brought
[1:20] forth fruit
[1:20] there appeared the tares also so the
[1:23] servants of the household came and said
[1:25] unto him
[1:26] sir did shall not sow good seed in thy
[1:28] field from whence then hath it tears
[1:31] and he said unto them an enemy hath done
[1:34] this
[1:35] and the servant said unto him wilt thou
[1:37] then that we go
[1:38] and gather them up but he said nay lest
[1:41] while you gather up the tares you root
[1:42] up also the wheat with them
[1:45] let both grow together until the harvest
[1:47] and in the time of the harvest i will
[1:49] say to the reapers gather you together
[1:51] first the tares
[1:52] and bind them into bundles to burn them
[1:55] but gather the wheat
[1:56] into my barn shall we just bow hearts to
[1:58] the lord today
[2:00] heavenly father as we have come here
[2:02] this morning for one purpose and that is
[2:05] that we might
[2:05] hear from you and receive from you lord
[2:08] god we just
[2:09] ask that you would take the scriptures
[2:10] that i've read this morning father
[2:12] god that you just open up to our hearts
[2:14] today lord
[2:15] knowing that we can come and every one
[2:18] of us that has an education and the
[2:19] ability to read
[2:20] father we can read the word but lord we
[2:23] realize that it will take the holy
[2:25] spirit to
[2:26] to illuminate light upon it father that
[2:28] we might understand what lays there
[2:30] but lord we know that jesus told the
[2:32] disciples blessed are your eyes for they
[2:34] see and blessed are your ears for they
[2:36] hear
[2:37] lord we we asked this morning god that
[2:39] you would so bless us this morning
[2:41] father that our eyes would be opened to
[2:43] your word lord
[2:44] and god that we would hear lord more
[2:46] than just an a voice god more than just
[2:49] a sound
[2:50] but lord that we would hear from you
[2:52] this morning father
[2:53] i pray that you just meet every need of
[2:55] every person that's here
[2:56] lord minister to your people this
[2:58] morning god lord i pray that you just so
[3:00] open our minds our hearts today god help
[3:03] each of us father that we would just be
[3:05] so
[3:05] lord attentive to your word this morning
[3:07] god i just pray that you would anoint me
[3:09] your servant this morning father
[3:11] that i would be obedient to your voice
[3:13] speak what you would have us to hear
[3:14] this morning for we ask it in the name
[3:16] of jesus christ as we commit this
[3:18] service into thy hands for thy glory
[3:20] in jesus name amen you may be seated
[3:23] this morning
[3:25] i'd like to speak to you this morning on
[3:27] a subject as
[3:28] brother makely had mentioned we i he had
[3:31] asked me some time back i was over at
[3:34] with isaiah brooks's church over in lima
[3:37] and he had mentioned to me sometime
[3:38] about coming by and i just
[3:41] and here over the last couple of weeks
[3:43] or so i just kind of felt to
[3:45] to to get in contact with him to come
[3:48] and the lord had just laid a few things
[3:49] upon my heart and as he
[3:51] gave testimony you see how the mind of
[3:53] god is
[3:54] because god doesn't just do something on
[3:56] one side but
[3:57] but we know that three is a confirmation
[3:59] and here you have
[4:00] brother makely receiving something
[4:02] another brother receiving something and
[4:04] then i myself
[4:05] something that god has laid upon my
[4:06] heart to come minister to you today
[4:08] and i hope you have your bibles with you
[4:11] because we're going to be looking at
[4:12] quite a bit of scriptures if you take
[4:15] notes it might be
[4:16] be wise to write a lot of the scriptures
[4:18] down so that you may can go back and
[4:20] look at them again and
[4:21] i always encourage people don't just
[4:23] take my word for it but go home and
[4:25] study for yourselves
[4:26] because each person is the study to show
[4:28] themselves approved in the lord and so
[4:31] i want to just if i may lay a little
[4:33] foundation this morning and just
[4:35] something to lead into the actual
[4:38] subject that i want to minister upon and
[4:40] and we'll be speaking this morning and
[4:42] tonight upon this
[4:44] and so it'd be valuable not to miss
[4:46] either part of it because it's a
[4:48] it's not it's a whole sermon but it
[4:50] comes in two parts you know it's like
[4:52] the main course in dessert so you don't
[4:55] want to just leave without getting the
[4:56] dessert
[4:57] so amen by god's grace but i'd like to
[5:00] speak on a thought on the seed of the
[5:02] antichrist
[5:04] and within this study i want to to try
[5:07] and show
[5:10] within the word of god a truth that will
[5:13] help us
[5:14] understand a lot of what's going on in
[5:16] the world and how
[5:17] a lot of people respond to the gospel
[5:21] but i want to begin by saying that most
[5:23] of the people in the world today have a
[5:25] misconception of what christianity and
[5:27] church is all about
[5:30] there and and the reason is because we
[5:33] find that satan has so
[5:35] has actually moved right into the church
[5:38] and has perverted it so much until the
[5:40] majority of the beliefs that people
[5:43] hold and because ev every one of us this
[5:47] morning we have beliefs
[5:48] if i were to sit down with you this
[5:50] morning and asked you to explain the
[5:52] word of god to me
[5:54] every one of us would have a belief that
[5:56] we hold within the word of god
[5:58] if we went to another church down the
[6:00] street and we went in we sat down with
[6:01] their pastor and
[6:03] and the people within the congregation
[6:04] we would begin to ask them
[6:06] would you please explain to me your
[6:08] beliefs
[6:09] we find that that that every person has
[6:12] a belief
[6:13] but when we speak on beliefs we find
[6:15] that a lot of people get real touchy
[6:17] when you start
[6:18] when you start actually dealing with
[6:20] beliefs because every person believes
[6:23] that their belief of the word of god is
[6:25] right there's not going to be one person
[6:27] that i would speak to today whether it's
[6:29] here in this church or
[6:30] a church down the street or a church in
[6:32] johnson city tennessee from where i'm
[6:34] from
[6:35] that if i begin to deal with them upon
[6:37] what they believe in the word of god
[6:39] every one of them is going to believe
[6:42] that their belief is right
[6:44] but what i want to just to to inject
[6:46] into your mind and i
[6:48] i have a few points that i want to make
[6:50] that i really want you to kind of
[6:51] hold as a very weighty as we move
[6:54] through this
[6:55] but beliefs are pre-arranged organized
[6:59] filters to our perception of the word
[7:02] i want to define beliefs for you again
[7:05] it is
[7:06] uh it is pre-arranged organized filters
[7:09] to our perception of the word
[7:11] in other words we only view the word of
[7:15] god
[7:15] through our beliefs now let me ask this
[7:19] question
[7:20] where does our beliefs come from or
[7:24] does our beliefs come from the word of
[7:26] god
[7:27] now we when we when we're looking at
[7:29] this at a belief as being a filter we
[7:32] find that
[7:33] that we will actually filter the word
[7:35] through a conglomeration of beliefs
[7:38] and thus we only view it in light of
[7:41] these beliefs and are quick to reject
[7:43] anything that does not come to our
[7:46] belief filter
[7:48] now when when we look at this belief i
[7:50] want to just
[7:51] i'm going to constantly be asking you
[7:53] this question this morning
[7:55] where does our beliefs come from
[7:58] the things that you hold as truth this
[8:01] morning
[8:02] the things that that when you look at
[8:04] the word of god and and you envision
[8:06] what the word of god means and what the
[8:08] word of god
[8:09] says where does that belief come from
[8:11] because
[8:12] the beliefs we have fostered them from
[8:15] somewhere
[8:16] but the question is is my does my belief
[8:19] come from the word of god or does it
[8:20] come
[8:21] from something that somebody has just
[8:23] taught me
[8:24] and because they have taught it to me i
[8:26] just accepted it as my belief
[8:28] and that is what i simply believe
[8:32] so we find that the majority of all
[8:34] beliefs is a result of what we have been
[8:37] taught from a child
[8:39] and have learned to filter the word of
[8:41] god
[8:42] from what we have been taught now i want
[8:45] you to notice a few things that i make a
[8:47] few points and as i said i'm just trying
[8:49] to
[8:50] to inject something before i actually
[8:52] enter into our thought
[8:54] this morning but so just bear with me a
[8:56] minute
[8:57] now you take a child that is born in a
[8:59] catholic home
[9:00] and has been raised in catholicism and
[9:03] has been taught the doctrine of the
[9:04] catholic church
[9:06] he he will foster those beliefs
[9:09] as they their filter by which they will
[9:12] view the word of god and
[9:13] christianity we find that the bible
[9:17] and a christian life has one meaning to
[9:19] them
[9:20] and another meaning to someone else who
[9:22] was who was raised in a baptist home
[9:25] you see you take a child that has been
[9:27] raised in catholicism
[9:29] and he will view and his whole belief
[9:32] structure
[9:33] of how he accepts this bible it's based
[9:37] upon
[9:37] the kind of rearing that he has had as
[9:39] he was coming up
[9:41] and to him you asked him what is
[9:43] christianity all about
[9:45] well it's about a rosary and it's about
[9:47] hail mary's and it's about
[9:49] this saint and that saint and say and in
[9:52] purgatory and all of these things
[9:54] but within his mind if you ask him is
[9:56] that what you believe he's going to tell
[9:58] you
[9:59] that his beliefs are right because that
[10:02] has what
[10:02] that is what he has fostered from a
[10:04] child
[10:05] and so he is growing with these beliefs
[10:08] in his mind
[10:09] but then you take a child that is raised
[10:11] in a baptist home
[10:13] to above this the word of god and
[10:15] christianity has a totally different
[10:17] meaning
[10:18] to a person that was raised within
[10:20] within a column of catholicism
[10:22] but you know when we think about baptist
[10:25] for just a moment
[10:26] there are a number of facets under the
[10:29] heading i am baptist when you would ask
[10:31] somebody say oh you're a baptist
[10:33] it's more than i'm baptist but we find
[10:36] that i am
[10:36] southern baptist or i am first baptist
[10:39] i'm missionary baptist or i am calvary
[10:41] baptist
[10:42] and the interesting thing about each of
[10:45] these facets from the southern baptist
[10:47] ii
[10:47] to the first baptist to the missionary
[10:49] baptist to the catholic
[10:51] to the calvary baptist is that even
[10:53] though every one of them will tell you
[10:55] that they are baptist
[10:57] if you go to their churches and look at
[11:00] their doctrines of beliefs you will find
[11:02] out that every one of those facets hold
[11:06] beliefs that are
[11:07] somewhat alike but the reason one is the
[11:10] calvary baptist and the other one is the
[11:12] first baptist
[11:13] it's because they have beliefs that are
[11:15] contrary one to the other
[11:17] but yet they all say i am a baptist and
[11:20] what i want you to try to understand
[11:22] this morning is
[11:24] is that here we have a world today
[11:27] that there are so many people so many
[11:30] churches
[11:31] we can go to a town and there'll be 13
[11:33] or 14 or 20 or 30
[11:35] churches in one town and every one of
[11:38] them will
[11:39] foster beliefs of the word that are
[11:41] contrary one to the other
[11:45] and every one every one of those
[11:48] churches
[11:48] will believe that what they believe is
[11:51] right
[11:55] now notice they will you know they'll
[11:57] both tell you
[11:59] that i am a baptist but they have
[12:01] different beliefs when it comes to
[12:03] viewing the word of god
[12:05] each one will argue the word based upon
[12:07] their beliefs which
[12:08] comes from the source by which they have
[12:11] been taught
[12:12] and each one will filter new revelation
[12:15] through their very own filter which is
[12:18] based
[12:19] upon those beliefs that they have been
[12:21] taught from a child
[12:22] for instance if if you were to take
[12:24] something here
[12:25] here and uh under the the atmosphere
[12:28] that we was in this morning of
[12:30] with the holy spirit moving amongst the
[12:32] people and the people entering
[12:34] into a a fellowship of worship
[12:37] if you were trying to take this belief
[12:40] concept
[12:41] of how that we have a freedom of worship
[12:44] and we can enter into the presence of
[12:45] god and the baptism of the holy ghost
[12:48] and speaking in tongues now if you were
[12:50] to take what you believed this morning
[12:53] down to the baptist church which would
[12:55] be no revelation to them
[12:57] they are going to view what you're
[12:59] telling them through their
[13:00] system of beliefs
[13:06] you will find that this system of
[13:08] viewing the word of god through belief
[13:10] filters
[13:10] also extends into the pentecostal
[13:14] churches
[13:15] there is the church of god there are the
[13:17] assemblies of god you have the united
[13:19] pentecostal church
[13:21] and last but not least you have also the
[13:24] independent pentecostal churches
[13:26] and each of these movements has their
[13:29] own system of beliefs
[13:31] by which they view and perceive the word
[13:34] of god
[13:35] now if you was a raised with you
[13:37] israel's assembly of god
[13:39] you will see the word by an assembly of
[13:43] god
[13:43] standard now just follow me now
[13:47] so your beliefs will be be after the
[13:50] pattern that the church elders have set
[13:53] forth
[13:54] and and that is what the preachers
[13:56] preach and if they preach
[13:57] anything that is contrary to the
[14:00] guidelines of that organization they're
[14:03] ousted out
[14:06] so notice again that each of these
[14:08] groups will tell you
[14:09] that i am pentecostal but they have
[14:12] different beliefs when it comes to
[14:15] believing the word
[14:16] of god now i want to ask you something
[14:18] why is that
[14:19] this morning you take a hundred
[14:21] pentecostal churches
[14:23] that may be within a 50-mile radius of
[14:26] this place
[14:27] and you go in and you sit down with them
[14:29] and
[14:30] every one of them are going to foster
[14:33] certain beliefs and that is what they're
[14:36] going to
[14:36] actually filter the word of god and
[14:39] where the separation comes is
[14:41] based not upon the word but upon what
[14:44] they believed the word of god says
[14:50] you know you take this group believes in
[14:52] father son holy ghost baptism this group
[14:54] believes in jesus name baptism
[14:57] this group believes in this and this
[14:59] group believes in that this one is here
[15:01] and this one is there
[15:02] now where is all of these beliefs coming
[15:04] from
[15:07] now i i'm trying to awaken your minds is
[15:11] what i'm trying to do just a moment
[15:14] now when someone says i believe
[15:16] something or i
[15:17] don't believe they are actually saying
[15:20] that the new things that they are
[15:22] hearing do not
[15:23] correlate with their pre-arranged
[15:26] beliefs
[15:27] and most people try and rationalize the
[15:30] word
[15:31] by their childhood beliefs
[15:34] but i want you to catch something that
[15:36] is very valuable to your walk with god
[15:39] this morning
[15:40] we are not supposed to put the word of
[15:43] god through the filter
[15:45] through a church filter of our beliefs
[15:47] but our beliefs
[15:49] are to be filtered through the word of
[15:51] god
[15:52] it's not about saying this is what i
[15:54] believe it's what does the word
[15:56] say amen
[16:00] so our beliefs are to be filtered
[16:02] through the word
[16:03] not the word filtered through our
[16:05] beliefs there's a big difference in that
[16:09] and so this morning what i what i want
[16:11] to try to do is show you
[16:13] that not all of our beliefs that we have
[16:16] been taught from a child is right
[16:21] now i want to just give you a very brief
[16:23] example before i enter into
[16:25] the actual thought this morning i hope
[16:27] this is all right with you
[16:30] and it's a belief that has been adopted
[16:32] into the church
[16:34] as a divine truth that will never
[16:37] make it through god's filter the word
[16:40] but
[16:40] yet it has been received as truth and
[16:43] parents have taught it to their children
[16:46] ministers have stood in the pulpit they
[16:48] have preached it they have projected
[16:50] it to the people and it is a flat out
[16:52] lie when it comes to the word of god
[16:57] are you ready we have been taught from a
[17:01] child
[17:03] that the wise men found jesus
[17:07] in a manger wrapped in swaddling clothes
[17:11] with sheep and dung and all of these
[17:13] things around him
[17:14] now let me ask you something is that the
[17:17] truth of god or not
[17:19] do you believe well we when we go down
[17:21] to the courthouse here we see
[17:23] the the manger scene and the wise men
[17:26] and the shepherds are there together
[17:29] with
[17:29] with jesus in a manger wrapped in
[17:32] swaddling claws
[17:33] and this is a belief that has been
[17:35] projected
[17:36] that does not even it's not even in the
[17:38] bible at all
[17:40] you say brother chris that's what i've
[17:42] been taught all my life you've been
[17:43] taught a lot
[17:47] i'm not just saying these things to be
[17:48] saying let's turn to luke the second
[17:50] chapter that's why i hope you got your
[17:51] bibles with you
[17:52] because what i want you to understand is
[17:54] that everything that you've always been
[17:56] taught does not necessarily line up with
[17:58] the word of god
[18:01] luke the second chapter i want to read
[18:04] verses 8 and 6 8 to 16
[18:06] this is the account of whence of which
[18:08] the shepherds came in contact with
[18:10] christ
[18:12] notice now luke chapter 2 beginning with
[18:14] the eighth verse
[18:16] and there were in the same country
[18:18] shepherds abiding in the field keeping
[18:20] watch over their flock by night
[18:22] and lo the angel of the lord came upon
[18:24] them in the glory of the lord shone
[18:26] round about them
[18:27] and they were so afraid and the angel
[18:29] said unto them fear not for behold i
[18:32] bring you good tidings of great joy
[18:34] which shall be to all people for unto
[18:37] you is born this day
[18:39] in the city of david a savior which is
[18:41] christ the lord
[18:43] and this shall be a sign unto you and
[18:45] you shall find the babe wrapped in
[18:47] swaddling clothes
[18:48] lying in a manger and suddenly there
[18:51] were the angels a multitude of heavenly
[18:53] hosts praising god and saying
[18:56] glory to god in the highest and on earth
[18:58] peace and good will to the word men
[19:00] and it came to pass as the angels were
[19:02] going away from them
[19:04] into heaven the shepherds said one to
[19:06] another let us go now unto bethlehem
[19:09] and see this thing which has come to
[19:11] pass which the lord hath made known
[19:13] unto us and they came with haste and
[19:15] found mary
[19:16] and joseph and the babe lying in a
[19:19] manger
[19:21] now notice the wording of these
[19:23] scriptures when speaking concerning
[19:26] jesus now this
[19:27] is the account of the shepherds
[19:30] not the wise men this is the shepherds
[19:33] notice in verse 12 and this shall be a
[19:36] sign unto you
[19:37] and ye shall find and if you want to
[19:39] underline this in your bible to keep it
[19:41] in your mind
[19:42] you shall find the babe be a b
[19:45] you shall find the bay wrapped in
[19:48] swaddling clothes
[19:49] lying in a manger then in verse in
[19:52] verse 16 and they came with haste and
[19:54] found mary and joseph
[19:56] and the babe lying in a manger
[20:00] so it's plain and clear without a doubt
[20:03] without a question
[20:04] that the shepherds found jesus just
[20:07] after he was born
[20:09] in a manger and he was a baby right
[20:12] so the bible said i believe that i hope
[20:14] you do as well
[20:15] but now let's turn to matthew the second
[20:18] chapter
[20:20] don't take my word for it now take your
[20:22] beliefs filter them through the word of
[20:23] god
[20:24] see if they line up with the word or not
[20:28] matthew the second chapter i want to
[20:29] begin reading here the first verse this
[20:31] is the account in which now
[20:33] the wise men are going to come in
[20:35] contact with jesus
[20:36] now when jesus was born in bethlehem of
[20:39] judea in the days of herod the king
[20:41] behold
[20:42] there came wise men from the east to
[20:44] jerusalem saying
[20:45] where is he that is born king of the
[20:47] jews for we have seen a star in the east
[20:49] and had come to worship him when herod
[20:52] the king had heard these things he was
[20:54] troubled
[20:54] and all jerusalem with him and when he
[20:57] had gathered all the chief priests and
[20:59] scribes of the people together
[21:00] he demanded them where christ should be
[21:03] born and they said unto him in bethlehem
[21:05] of judea for thus it is written by
[21:07] the prophet and thou betham in the land
[21:10] of judah
[21:11] are not the least among the princes of
[21:13] judah out of these shall come a governor
[21:16] that shall rule my people israel now
[21:18] notice
[21:19] verse 7 just a moment now as i read
[21:21] through this and hold it in your mind
[21:23] then herod when he had privately called
[21:25] the wise men
[21:27] inquired of them diligently what
[21:30] time the star appeared now notice herod
[21:33] is
[21:34] asking them when did you first
[21:37] see the star let's read on now
[21:41] and he sent them to bethlehem and said
[21:43] go and search diligently for
[21:45] notice now verse 8 the young
[21:48] what child not babe
[21:54] when the when the shepherds found him it
[21:57] was
[21:57] the babe the babe lying in a manger
[22:00] and notice here now when they heard the
[22:02] king they departed in low
[22:04] with the storm and someone before them
[22:06] till they come to and stood over where
[22:08] the young
[22:09] child what's the next word
[22:12] was not is
[22:15] but where he was past
[22:19] tense now notice now when they saw the
[22:22] star they rejoiced with exceeding great
[22:24] joy
[22:24] and when they were come notice now into
[22:27] the what
[22:31] now where did they find him at
[22:35] not in a manger not in a stable
[22:39] not with dung around him not with not
[22:42] with sheep and oxen and all of these
[22:44] things
[22:44] but when the wise man found jesus he was
[22:48] in a house
[22:49] that's right praise god not in a not in
[22:51] a
[22:52] stable but yet we have been taught
[22:55] from childhood that the wise men found
[22:59] jesus in a stable wrapped in swaddling
[23:03] claws
[23:04] but yet the word of god said when they
[23:06] were coming to the
[23:08] house they saw the young child
[23:12] not baby let's continue reading on down
[23:16] and and with mary's mother and fell down
[23:18] and worshipped him and when they had
[23:20] opened their treasures
[23:21] they presented unto him gifts gold and
[23:23] frankincense and myrrh
[23:24] and being warned of god in a dream that
[23:26] they should not return to error they
[23:28] departed unto their own country another
[23:30] way
[23:30] and when they were departed behold the
[23:32] angel the lord appeared to joseph in a
[23:34] dream saying arise
[23:35] take the young child not they
[23:39] take the young child and his mother and
[23:41] flee into egypt
[23:42] and be thou there until i bring the word
[23:45] for herod will seek the young child to
[23:47] destroy him
[23:48] and when he rose he took the young child
[23:52] and his mother by night and departed
[23:53] into egypt notice verse 16 now
[23:56] then herod when he saw that he was
[23:58] mocked of the wise men
[24:00] was exceeded rough and sent forth and
[24:02] slew
[24:03] all of the children that were in
[24:05] bethlehem and in all of the coasts there
[24:07] have noticed this part now
[24:09] from two years old and under according
[24:13] to the time
[24:16] which he had diligently inquired
[24:19] of the wise man
[24:23] now here herod just killed all of the
[24:25] children two years old and under why
[24:27] because he knew at what time it was that
[24:30] the wise men had asked him
[24:32] about the baby and he had sent him forth
[24:34] and it was when jesus when the wise men
[24:36] found
[24:37] jesus he was not a babe he was not in
[24:40] swaddling clothes
[24:41] he was not in a manger in fact he was
[24:43] two years old
[24:47] and in a house
[24:50] now that's what the word of god says now
[24:54] i don't know about you this morning but
[24:56] if my belief that i've always been
[25:00] taught from a child it's contrary to
[25:02] what the bible said
[25:04] then it would be important for me to get
[25:07] rid of my beliefs
[25:10] and go to the word of god and find what
[25:14] the bible says
[25:16] now i want to just make a few more
[25:17] points and it's very valuable point if
[25:20] it's all right with you
[25:22] now in galatians the first chapter i
[25:25] want you to read something with me
[25:26] because
[25:27] now i want to just bring this down just
[25:29] a little bit more
[25:30] serious to us because people say well
[25:33] brother chris what
[25:34] is what is me believing whether or not
[25:36] the wise man was at the mains or in the
[25:38] house
[25:38] what has it got to do with my salvation
[25:40] i don't know what it might have to do
[25:42] but what i want to say to you is this
[25:43] if in such a minor area
[25:47] something that is so minor is that if
[25:50] you have been taught
[25:51] that wrong what other things
[25:55] what other things that you have been
[25:57] taught in your beliefs that you have
[26:00] right now
[26:00] the things that you hold as truth what
[26:02] other things
[26:04] may be wrong because you've failed to
[26:07] simply
[26:08] go to the word of god or not and to see
[26:10] if your belief lines up with the word
[26:14] amen galatians the first chapter
[26:23] i want to begin with the sixth verse
[26:25] notice now paul begins into something
[26:27] and paul brings this down to a very
[26:30] serious matter now
[26:32] he said i marvel that you're so removed
[26:35] from him that has called you
[26:37] into the grace of christ notice what he
[26:39] says now
[26:40] unto another gospel
[26:44] moved into another gospel which is not
[26:46] another but there be
[26:48] some that trouble you and would pervert
[26:51] the gospel of christ but though we
[26:54] are an angel from heaven preach any
[26:56] other gospel unto you
[26:57] then that which we have preached unto
[26:59] you let him be a curse
[27:01] as we said before so say i now again
[27:04] if any man preach another gospel unto
[27:07] you
[27:08] then that you have received let him be
[27:11] accursed notice that paul is speaking of
[27:15] another gospel being preached
[27:17] and those that have believed it he has
[27:20] said
[27:20] they are removed from the faith
[27:25] i want to just place this in your mind
[27:27] the reason
[27:28] it is important that we believe what the
[27:31] word says and not just what we've been
[27:33] taught from a
[27:34] child it's because to believe one simple
[27:37] thing
[27:38] that is contrary to the word of god even
[27:40] the wise men of
[27:42] being at the manger scene will remove
[27:45] you
[27:45] out of the gospel of christ and place
[27:47] you into another gospel
[27:50] that's not my words that's the apostle
[27:52] paul if you believe the word of god or
[27:54] not
[27:55] that's why it is so important for us not
[27:58] just to take beliefs
[28:00] not just to take what well my mama
[28:02] taught me that
[28:03] and i was raised in the church and
[28:05] that's what i've been taught all of my
[28:07] life and that's what i believe
[28:09] i don't want it just to be based upon
[28:10] what my mother and my father has taught
[28:13] me
[28:13] but i want it to be based upon the word
[28:16] of god
[28:17] because my mom and dad could be wrong in
[28:19] fact i'll tell you this much
[28:21] my mother and my father did teach me
[28:23] wrong
[28:27] my mom always told me the wise man was
[28:29] at the um
[28:30] manger i don't know about yours but
[28:33] that's what my mom and dad taught me
[28:35] and i found out right quick that i
[28:37] better come to a point in my life
[28:39] to take everything that mom and dad has
[28:41] always injected instilled inside of me
[28:43] to make sure it lines up with the word
[28:45] of god or not
[28:47] because it's not you're not going to get
[28:49] in on mom and daddy anyhow
[28:51] it's got to be an individual affair you
[28:54] and god alone
[29:00] so paul he says here he said but though
[29:02] we are an angel from heaven preaching
[29:04] another gospel unto you
[29:05] then that which we have preached unto
[29:06] you let him be accursed as we have said
[29:08] before so say now i again
[29:10] if any man preach another gospel unto
[29:12] you that that you have received let him
[29:14] be a curse now this might hurt just a
[29:17] little bit but i'm going to say it
[29:18] anyhow
[29:19] amen any system whether it is methodist
[29:22] catholic baptist pentecostal
[29:25] that teach anything that is contrary to
[29:27] the word of god according to paul is
[29:30] cursed
[29:31] and those that believe based their
[29:33] beliefs
[29:34] upon the things the system has taught is
[29:37] cursed with it
[29:40] amen becomes a little bit more serious
[29:43] now
[29:46] so if those who have taught you have
[29:48] misrepresented the word in such a minor
[29:50] way
[29:52] as the wise man being at the manger
[29:53] scene how many other areas of the word
[29:56] have they misled you to believe as well
[30:00] now i want to just look at this subject
[30:02] this morning because
[30:03] it is important for me to lay that out
[30:05] because what i want you to realize is
[30:07] that maybe a lot of the things that
[30:08] we've been taught
[30:10] isn't always right because if we would
[30:13] go to the word of god we just might see
[30:14] things a little bit differently
[30:17] now i want to look as i said on the
[30:19] subject i'm just going to lay a
[30:21] foundation this morning and so tonight
[30:23] we're going to
[30:24] to pick up back up wherever i don't get
[30:27] finished with this morning so
[30:29] now in genesis 3 15
[30:33] as we go i want you to turn with me and
[30:35] read all of these scriptures for
[30:36] yourself because as
[30:37] i said i don't want you just to take my
[30:39] word fart
[30:41] because i don't want to just foster some
[30:44] beliefs into your mind
[30:45] but i want to try to project to you the
[30:48] same gospel that paul preached
[30:50] which is the word of god and the truth
[30:52] of god that which lays within the word
[30:55] now we will find that through studying
[30:57] the scripture that the bible depicts
[30:59] that there are two
[31:00] seeds and here in genesis 3 15
[31:04] it speaks now he said and i will put
[31:06] enmity between
[31:07] thee and the woman and between now if
[31:10] you want to underline it you can
[31:12] between thy seed which is one seed and
[31:15] her seed which is another seed
[31:19] so there it speaks of thy seed and
[31:22] heresy
[31:23] then we read in matthew the 13th chapter
[31:26] verses 24 to 30
[31:27] and laying our scriptural foundation in
[31:30] which that
[31:31] jesus called the two seeds the tares
[31:35] and the wheat and the two seeds what we
[31:38] will find according to what jesus taught
[31:41] in matthew 13
[31:43] that the two seeds are on earth at the
[31:46] same time
[31:48] now as we study these two seeds we will
[31:51] find
[31:52] that there is a conflict in natures
[31:55] between them in genesis 3 15 it declares
[31:59] that there is enmity between
[32:02] the two seeds for he said i will put
[32:06] enmity between thy seed and her seed
[32:10] now this word enmity comes from the root
[32:13] word
[32:14] or from the word hatred in other words i
[32:16] will put
[32:17] hatred between thy seed and her seed
[32:20] you'll never get along you'll never be
[32:22] able to exist together in peace
[32:25] but there is going to be two seeds and
[32:28] there is going to be enmity between the
[32:30] two seeds
[32:32] now as we take a farther look at these
[32:34] two seeds we will find
[32:36] that there is one group that is cursed
[32:39] while another group
[32:40] is blessed one group is under judgment
[32:45] while another group is under mercy now i
[32:48] want you to turn with me now to matthew
[32:50] the 13th chapter
[32:51] and i want to look at the cursed seed
[32:54] just a moment
[32:55] matthew chapter 13 verse 42.
[32:58] we're going to be covering a lot of
[32:59] scriptures so be prepared to turn and
[33:01] read with me
[33:02] matthew 13 verse 42 notice what the
[33:05] scripture says now
[33:07] and shall cast them into the furnace of
[33:10] fire
[33:11] and there shall be weeping and there
[33:13] shall be welling and gnashing of
[33:15] teeth so notice now the seed of the
[33:19] enemy is cast into the furnace of fire
[33:23] and the reason why we know this is the
[33:25] seed of the enemy is because of
[33:27] this is the latter part of what we read
[33:30] in in matthew chapter 13 verses 24 to 30
[33:33] in which the son of man sowed his seed
[33:35] into the field and then the bible said
[33:37] while he slept
[33:38] an enemy came in and sowed seed also
[33:41] and now we come and look at the seed
[33:43] that was sown by the enemy
[33:45] and it is that seed that was sown by the
[33:48] enemy that is to be
[33:49] cast into the furnace of fire
[33:53] now go to luke the 19th chapter verse
[33:56] 27.
[33:58] luke 19 verse 27.
[34:06] notice the scripture now but those
[34:09] mine enemies which would not that i
[34:12] should reign
[34:13] over them bring hither and slay them
[34:16] before me notice now there is judgment
[34:20] to the enemy and christ tells here
[34:23] that he has an enemy
[34:27] and those that are his enemy he says to
[34:30] them
[34:31] he says he says bring them and slay them
[34:34] before me
[34:35] now notice now matthew 25 verse 41.
[34:41] matthew 25 41 we're going to lay a lot
[34:44] of scripture and then i'm going to just
[34:45] bring them all together
[34:47] chapter 25 verse 41 notice what he says
[34:50] now
[34:51] then shall he say also unto them on
[34:54] the left hand depart for me notice the
[34:57] word next now
[34:59] depart from me ye cursed
[35:02] ye cursed into everlasting fire prepared
[35:06] for the devil
[35:07] and his angels so jesus speaks to a
[35:11] people here
[35:12] that was cursed a people that was not
[35:16] blessed
[35:17] and the cursed people was on the left
[35:20] hand of god
[35:21] now if there is a left hand then there
[35:24] must be a right hand right
[35:26] so those on the left hand were cursed
[35:30] and those on the right hand were not
[35:33] cursed
[35:34] what we are seeing is the two seeds of
[35:37] genesis 3
[35:38] 15 in which he said i will put enmity
[35:41] between
[35:42] thy seed and her seed one will be
[35:45] cursed the other one will be blessed one
[35:47] will receive mercy the other one will
[35:49] receive
[35:50] judgment
[35:54] now i want to ask this question who are
[35:57] the cursed children
[35:58] turn them into genesis 3 17 who are the
[36:01] cursed children
[36:03] because genesis is the book of begin of
[36:05] beginnings
[36:06] and if there is a curse seed
[36:10] it had to begin in genesis because
[36:12] everything
[36:13] began in genesis
[36:17] now notice now genesis 3 17 you'll find
[36:21] out that
[36:22] adam was not cursed for he said in
[36:25] genesis
[36:26] 3 17 and unto adam he said because thou
[36:29] hast hearken unto the voice of thy wife
[36:31] and has be eaten of the tree of which i
[36:33] commandeth thee saying thou shalt not
[36:35] eat of it
[36:36] curse it is the ground for thy sake
[36:40] notice now the ground was cursed
[36:43] but not adam god
[36:46] did not curse adam but he cursed the
[36:49] ground on
[36:50] adam for adam's stake now notice also
[36:53] now in the 16th verse
[36:55] and you'll find that eve was not cursed
[36:58] for it said
[36:59] unto the woman he said i will greatly
[37:01] multiply thy sorrow
[37:03] and thy conception in sorrow thou shalt
[37:05] bring forth children
[37:06] and thy desire shall be to thy husband
[37:08] and he shall rule
[37:10] over thee notice what he said he said
[37:12] that he would greatly multiply our
[37:14] sorrow and conception
[37:16] but nowhere does he say that eve was
[37:20] cursed
[37:22] when you look at genesis the 3rd chapter
[37:24] and the 14th verse
[37:26] you will find that the serpent was
[37:29] cursed for he said in the lord god said
[37:32] unto the serpent because thou hast
[37:36] done this thou art cursed
[37:41] notice also now in genesis the 4th
[37:44] chapter and the 11th verse
[37:46] we will find out that cain was also
[37:50] cursed amen genesis 4
[37:53] 11. and now speaking of
[37:56] cain for in verse 9 the lord said unto
[37:58] cain then in verse 11 continuing the
[38:01] conversation
[38:02] he said and now art thou cursed
[38:06] so the judgment of matthew 25 41
[38:10] we find that the multitudes at the end
[38:13] time their curse the judgment where he
[38:16] said to those on his left hand
[38:18] ye cursed children of him and we find
[38:21] that the cursed children
[38:22] started in genesis and moved all the way
[38:25] down
[38:26] to the end time
[38:30] for he said in ii peter the second
[38:32] chapter verse 14 turn with me there if
[38:34] you will
[38:35] ii peter 2 14 and i know you think of
[38:37] brother chris where is all of this
[38:38] sleeping hang on and you'll find out
[38:41] ii peter chapter 2 verse 14 what i want
[38:45] to establish in your
[38:46] minds this morning is that there are two
[38:48] seeds
[38:49] within the scripture in ii peter 2 14
[38:53] having eyes full of adultery and cannot
[38:56] cease from sin
[38:57] beguiling unstable souls and heart they
[39:01] have exercised with coveted practice
[39:04] cursed children notice now the bible
[39:08] speaks
[39:09] of cursed children now
[39:12] what we are looking at is that only the
[39:15] seed
[39:16] of the serpent which had to be cain
[39:19] was cursed because
[39:23] adam was not cursed eve was not cursed
[39:26] but the serpent was cursed and cain was
[39:29] cursed
[39:30] and then you come to the end time and in
[39:33] second peter 2 14
[39:35] he speaks again of cursed
[39:40] children
[39:42] let me say it to you like this no seed
[39:44] of god is cursed
[39:46] only those on the left hand where
[39:52] it is impossible for the seed of god to
[39:54] be cursed you see
[39:56] a wheat cannot be a tear
[40:00] when you go back to matthew 13 verses 24
[40:04] to 30 you'll find out
[40:06] that there was one seed sown and there
[40:08] was another seed
[40:10] sown and each of them was of different
[40:12] seeds
[40:13] and a wheat no matter how much a tear
[40:16] would desire to be a wheat
[40:18] it cannot be because the curse was
[40:22] on the seed and god set a law and order
[40:26] that said the seed must bring forth of
[40:29] its kind
[40:32] is that what he said genesis 1 11 and
[40:34] 12.
[40:35] genesis 1 11 and 12 here's the law of
[40:37] god god set into order
[40:39] and god said let the earth bring forth
[40:41] grasp the herd building seed
[40:42] and the fruit tree yielding fruit after
[40:44] its kind whose seed is in itself upon
[40:46] the earth and it was so
[40:48] and the earth brought forth grass and
[40:49] the herb yielding seed after his kind
[40:52] and the tree yielding fruit whose seed
[40:53] was in itself after its kind
[40:56] and god saw that it was good notice what
[40:58] he is saying now
[40:59] here is the law of god god set right
[41:01] into nature
[41:02] that whatever life is in that seed that
[41:05] is the only life that it can produce
[41:08] so each seed had to produce the life
[41:10] that was in it whether it was a tear
[41:13] or a wheat whether it was a good seed or
[41:15] whether
[41:16] it was an evil seed so the enemy is the
[41:19] enemy and a son of god is a son of god
[41:25] you take an apple seed and that apple
[41:27] seed might want to be an orange seed but
[41:29] it can never do it
[41:31] if how if it's going to be an apple tree
[41:34] it had to have apple tree life in
[41:37] it halfway through its life it can't
[41:41] change
[41:44] that's the law of god that's the law of
[41:46] genesis
[41:47] neither we believe the word of god or do
[41:49] we not that's the question to ask
[41:50] yourself
[41:52] so we have the wicked seed and we have
[41:55] the righteous seed one is cursed
[41:59] the other one isn't cursed one is born
[42:03] of god
[42:03] the other one is born of satan
[42:07] because in matthew 13 verses 24 and 25
[42:11] we find that the son of man sowed watch
[42:14] this now
[42:15] good speed
[42:17] [Music]
[42:18] let's just look at it turn with me
[42:20] matthew chapter 13 verses 24 i want you
[42:23] to see it for yourself
[42:25] matthew 13 verses 24 and 25 and a pair
[42:28] by putting forth on them saying
[42:30] the kingdom of heaven is likened unto a
[42:32] man which sold good
[42:33] seed in his field but while men slept
[42:37] his enemy came
[42:38] and sowed tares among the wheat
[42:42] and went his way now notice
[42:45] these two seeds that was sown was
[42:48] later translated by jesus in verse
[42:52] 38 as the field is the world
[42:55] and the good seed are the children of
[42:57] the kingdom
[42:59] and the tares are the children of
[43:02] the wicked one
[43:05] right one born of god one born of satan
[43:09] one the seed of god one the seed of
[43:11] satan one are the children of the
[43:13] kingdom the other one are the children
[43:14] of the wicked one and they were what
[43:15] they were because of the seed that was
[43:17] sown
[43:20] now i want you to look at this god takes
[43:23] care
[43:24] of his seed the cursed
[43:27] children are punished
[43:30] they are not the seed of god
[43:34] now you say brother chris but god loves
[43:36] everybody
[43:38] then explain to me why he said jacob i
[43:39] have loved and esau have hated me
[43:44] now do you believe the word of god or do
[43:46] you not believe the word of god
[43:47] jacob i've loved esau i've hated that's
[43:50] in wrong
[43:51] in your bible if you want to look it up
[43:54] so we find that god has a special
[43:57] attention
[43:59] not to all of the world just say but
[44:02] brother chris
[44:02] he died for all the world but yet look
[44:04] at the parable he said also
[44:06] the prayer that he found a treasure in a
[44:08] field and he went and bought the field
[44:10] but he didn't take the field he took the
[44:12] treasure out of the field
[44:14] that was why he came not for the whole
[44:17] world but he come because
[44:19] there was a treasure in the field
[44:25] john 17 9
[44:28] because some of you thinking that i'm
[44:30] just saying this may be on my own
[44:33] john 17 9 let's look what jesus says now
[44:35] here here is jesus
[44:38] and he's praying notice his prayer now
[44:42] i pray for them
[44:47] i pray not
[44:51] for the what world
[44:55] i pray for them i pray
[44:59] not for the world but for them which
[45:02] thou
[45:02] hast given me for they are
[45:06] thine here jesus prayed for his
[45:10] faith he was not praying for the world
[45:15] he was not praying for everyone he was
[45:18] praying for those
[45:19] that was on the right hand of god he was
[45:22] not praying for the cursed
[45:24] children
[45:28] it's the word of god that's what i
[45:30] believe
[45:32] god it's first john the third chapter
[45:34] now
[45:38] first john chapter 3 verses 10 to 15.
[45:42] i know i'm probably shaking a little bit
[45:44] of your beliefs
[45:46] but that's what i wanted to do because
[45:49] always i believe isn't always right
[45:53] first john third chapter begin with the
[45:55] tenth verse
[45:57] in this the children of god
[46:00] calls his own works were evil and his
[46:03] brothers
[46:04] righteous marvel not my brethren notice
[46:07] here comes this word world again
[46:09] marvel not my brethren if the world
[46:12] hates you now remember what jesus said
[46:16] all the way back yonder in genesis 3 15
[46:19] he said i will put enmity the word
[46:22] enmity there is hatred
[46:24] i will put hatred between thy seed and
[46:27] her shed
[46:28] and here he comes and said marvel not my
[46:31] brethren
[46:32] if the world hate you
[46:35] what is he doing he is identifying that
[46:38] the world that jesus said that he would
[46:41] not pray for
[46:42] was that wicked seed it was those that
[46:45] was going to be at
[46:46] enmity with the children of god
[46:51] he said we know that we have passed from
[46:53] death unto life because we love the
[46:55] brethren
[46:55] he that loveth not his brother abideth
[46:57] and death whosoever hateth his brother
[46:59] is a murder
[47:00] and you know that no murder hath eternal
[47:02] life abiding in him
[47:06] notice verse 13 it tells us that the
[47:08] world is the cursed seat
[47:11] that was born of the wicked one
[47:15] for he said marvel not my brethren if
[47:17] the world
[47:18] hates you genesis 4 11 tells us that
[47:21] cain was cursed
[47:22] here in first john 3 12 we find that
[47:25] cain was of that wicked one
[47:27] and he hated abel so what the bible said
[47:31] notice
[47:31] not as cain who was of that wicked one
[47:34] remember
[47:34] that it was it was a wicked one in
[47:36] matthew 13
[47:38] verses verse 38 he said that he said the
[47:41] the good seed
[47:42] were the children of the kingdom the bad
[47:45] seed were the children
[47:46] of the wicked one and here he's
[47:49] identifying now
[47:50] john under inspiration he said brother
[47:52] chris what is this holy men of old
[47:54] as they were moved upon by the holy
[47:56] spirit they wrote the word of god
[47:58] and here john comes under inspiration
[48:00] and said not as cain
[48:02] who was of that wicked one and slew his
[48:05] brother and wherefore slewing him
[48:08] because his works were evil and his
[48:11] brothers were
[48:12] righteous amen the cursed
[48:16] children had to be the world
[48:19] cain was a tear yes sir
[48:23] cain was a terror because he was of the
[48:26] wicked one
[48:28] what the bible says now now let's go to
[48:31] ephesians 1 just a minute
[48:44] ephesians 1.
[48:51] i want to read verses 4 to 7 now
[48:56] notice this now because what i want to
[48:58] show you is that
[48:59] redemption comes only to the children of
[49:02] god
[49:03] but notice what he said now in verse 4
[49:06] according as he has chosen
[49:09] us in him before
[49:13] the foundation of the world
[49:19] now i don't know about you but
[49:22] if that's what it says it says then i
[49:25] was actually
[49:26] a seed of god before i was even born
[49:31] because according as he has chosen us
[49:33] before
[49:35] the foundation of the world
[49:38] that we should be holy without blame
[49:40] before him in love
[49:42] having predestinated us unto the
[49:44] adoption
[49:45] of children by jesus christ to himself
[49:48] according to the good pleasure of his
[49:50] will
[49:51] to the praise of his glory of his grace
[49:53] wherein he hath made us accept it in the
[49:54] beloved notice verse 7 now
[49:56] in whom we have redemption through the
[50:00] blood
[50:02] the forgiveness of sins according to the
[50:05] riches of his grace
[50:07] now i want to ask you a question in
[50:09] verse 7
[50:10] who is the we
[50:13] because he said in whom we have
[50:16] redemption through the blood the
[50:17] forgiveness of sin i'll tell you who it
[50:18] is
[50:18] it's the us in verse four when he said
[50:22] according to his chosen us
[50:23] in him the only those that have been
[50:27] chosen in god before the foundation of
[50:29] the world
[50:30] has redemption through the blood of
[50:32] jesus christ and the forgiveness of sin
[50:36] you see brother chris you mean
[50:37] everybody's not going to be saved that's
[50:39] right
[50:42] i mean i would love for everybody to
[50:44] make but the fact of it is not
[50:45] everybody's going to make it
[50:48] because only those that was chosen in
[50:50] god before the foundation of the world
[50:52] is god has forgiveness of sins through
[50:54] the blood of
[50:56] jesus christ you see saints of god
[50:59] some are ordained to life
[51:03] and some to death
[51:06] and redemption don't come to the cursed
[51:09] children because matthew 25 41
[51:13] tells of the judgment he said to those
[51:15] on the left and get cursed
[51:17] into everlasting fire when we get all
[51:20] the way to the end time and the judgment
[51:22] time
[51:23] the cursed children is still standing
[51:26] there
[51:28] under the judgment of god so redemption
[51:31] is only to those on the right hand of
[51:32] god turn them into acts 13 verse 48.
[51:44] acts 13 verse 48 notice the scripture
[51:46] now
[51:47] here's a story of paul and barnabas
[51:50] they was coming into the city that was
[51:52] coming to to minister the word of the
[51:54] lord and notice what it says in verse 48
[51:57] and when the gentiles heard this
[52:00] they were glad and glorified the word of
[52:03] the lord
[52:03] and as many as were
[52:07] ordained to what to eternal life
[52:11] believed now here
[52:15] is paul in acts telling us that there
[52:18] are people that are ordained to
[52:20] eternal life and it is only those that
[52:24] was ordained to eternal life that
[52:26] believed what they was preaching
[52:28] now notice in verse 44 because it's
[52:30] important to see this
[52:32] verse because in verse 44 it said and
[52:34] the next sabbath day
[52:36] came almost the whole city together to
[52:40] hear the word of god
[52:42] now when we look at the broad picture
[52:44] nearly everyone
[52:46] in the city came out to hear paul and
[52:49] barnabas preach
[52:52] but not everyone that came out to hear
[52:54] them preach was ordained to eternal life
[52:57] and the only ones that believed what
[52:59] they were saying was those that was
[53:01] ordained to eternal life then that makes
[53:03] an interesting point of
[53:05] only the true seed of god those who are
[53:07] not the cursed children
[53:08] is going to believe the word of god in
[53:10] his pureness
[53:12] they're not just going to sit around and
[53:13] foster some beliefs
[53:15] but the true bread of christ is going to
[53:18] believe all of the word
[53:24] now why did those believe that believe
[53:29] question right second 10 second
[53:30] thessalonians
[53:33] because almost the whole city came out
[53:35] to hear the word of god but not all of
[53:37] those that came out to here believed it
[53:38] was only those that was ordained to
[53:39] eternal life
[53:40] so then we come to second thessalonians
[53:42] because why did those that believed
[53:44] believed
[53:45] well in second thessalonians chapter 2
[53:47] verse 13 the bible says
[53:48] but we are bound to give thanks always
[53:51] to god for you brethren beloved of the
[53:53] lord
[53:53] because god hath from the beginning
[53:56] chosen you to salvation
[53:58] that is the same thing that paul said
[54:00] over under in
[54:01] in ephesians 1 and 4 when he said
[54:03] according as he was chosen
[54:05] us in him before the foundation of the
[54:07] world now here he comes back again
[54:10] because god from the beginning chosen
[54:12] you to salvation
[54:13] through sanctification of the spirit and
[54:16] belief
[54:17] in the truth the reason why those that
[54:19] came out
[54:20] that received eternal life could believe
[54:22] was because they was chosen to believe
[54:25] right but notice in jude
[54:30] jude the fourth verse there's only one
[54:32] chapter so jude the fourth verse notice
[54:34] what it says here now
[54:37] jude the fourth verse for there are
[54:40] certain men crypt and unawares who were
[54:43] before
[54:44] all ordained
[54:47] to this condemnation
[54:51] now in the same bible we find
[54:55] one group of people that are ordained to
[54:58] lie
[54:59] we find another group of people that
[55:01] joel jude says
[55:02] that before over ordained a condemnation
[55:05] we find the right hand of god and a left
[55:08] hand of god
[55:09] we find cursed children and we find
[55:11] blessed children
[55:14] now does your bible say that that's what
[55:16] vine says
[55:18] now notice just now we start seeing
[55:22] these two seeds coming into
[55:25] form now one is blind
[55:28] the other one can see one is death
[55:33] the other one can hear one is ordained
[55:36] to eternal life
[55:38] one is ordained to condemnation that's
[55:41] why
[55:41] jesus said in matthew 13 that described
[55:44] that the disciples asked jesus
[55:46] a question they said why do you speak to
[55:48] them in parables
[55:49] he said because it's not given unto them
[55:51] he said but it's given unto you to know
[55:52] the mysteries of the kingdom
[55:54] now here jesus was telling the disciples
[55:56] that one group that's given to know the
[55:58] mysteries and one group that's not given
[55:59] to know the mysteries
[56:00] and then he said in matthew 13 16 he
[56:02] said blessed are your eyes for they see
[56:04] and your ears foreign they hear what is
[56:06] he telling
[56:07] not everybody can see and hear what
[56:09] you're seeing and hear it
[56:12] and you're blessed because why can't i
[56:14] believe because before all he was chosen
[56:17] to salvation to believe this gospel
[56:21] so notice the characteristics of the two
[56:23] seeds one can see one can't see one can
[56:26] hear one can't hear
[56:28] thus we can see why one is cursed and
[56:31] the other one is not cursed let's go
[56:32] back to first john
[56:34] the third chapter i'm going to come to a
[56:35] place to stop hopefully by the grace of
[56:37] god
[56:39] you'll give me just maybe a few more
[56:41] moments and then i'll pick up tonight
[56:43] where we don't finish up
[56:45] first john chapter 3 beginning with
[56:47] verse 8 now
[56:49] he that committeth sin is of the devil
[56:52] for the devil
[56:54] sinneth from the beginning for this
[56:56] purpose the son of god was manifested
[56:58] that he might destroy the works of the
[56:59] devil
[57:00] whosoever is born of god does not commit
[57:02] sin for his seed remaineth in him
[57:04] and he cannot sin because he is born of
[57:07] god
[57:08] in this the children of god are
[57:10] manifested and the children of the devil
[57:12] whosoever doeth not righteous and not of
[57:14] god neither he that loveth not
[57:16] his brother notice this now
[57:19] in verse 8 it tells us that sin
[57:23] originated with satan for it said in
[57:26] verse 8
[57:27] he that committed sinners of the devil
[57:29] for the devil
[57:30] sinneth from the beginning sin did not
[57:34] start on earth but sin started in heaven
[57:37] because in revelations chapter 12 verses
[57:39] 7 to 9
[57:40] you'll find out that there was war in
[57:42] heaven and michael and his angels fought
[57:44] against
[57:45] lucifer and his angels and the reason
[57:47] was because
[57:48] in isaiah told us why that he exalted
[57:51] his will above the will of god
[57:53] and when satan exalted his will above
[57:55] the will of god there was a war in
[57:57] heaven and satan was cast out to earth
[58:01] and in ezekiel 28 13 we're not going to
[58:04] read it but i want you to hold this for
[58:05] later use
[58:06] in ezekiel 28 13 the bible speaking
[58:09] concerning satan
[58:10] said thou hast been in eden the garden
[58:13] of god
[58:14] here sin originates with satan in heaven
[58:17] but now we find satan coming down to
[58:20] earth
[58:21] then in verse 9 it tells us that god has
[58:24] a seed
[58:25] and his seed produces his nature
[58:28] for he said whosoever is born of god
[58:31] doth not commit
[58:32] sin for his seed remain remaineth in him
[58:36] and he cannot sin because he is born of
[58:39] god
[58:43] the reason they can't sin is because his
[58:46] seed
[58:48] his seed is in them
[58:51] now if god's children produce his nature
[58:55] then the curse shall reproduce the
[58:56] nature of him
[58:58] that holds his seed
[59:02] now notice this now satan was a deceiver
[59:06] because in revelation 12 and 9 the bible
[59:09] said this
[59:10] and the great dragon was cast out the
[59:13] old serpent
[59:14] called the devil and satan now notice
[59:17] this wording now
[59:19] which deceiveth the whole
[59:22] world
[59:25] satan deceiveth the whole
[59:29] world now remember that
[59:32] jesus said i pray for them
[59:36] but not the world
[59:39] and here he said in revelation 12 9
[59:43] that the devil deceiveth the whole world
[59:46] why because the seed of god was not
[59:50] in them
[59:58] they're blind they cannot see
[1:00:01] blessed are your eyes for they see
[1:00:02] blessed are your ears for they hear
[1:00:05] but guess what the children of god
[1:00:07] cannot be deceived because they
[1:00:09] are not the world
[1:00:14] seed of god the elected of god those of
[1:00:16] ephesians one and four according to his
[1:00:18] chosen us in them
[1:00:19] before the foundation of the world they
[1:00:21] cannot be deceived
[1:00:24] don't you understand that that is why
[1:00:26] god is so gracious
[1:00:28] to allow us to cast our beliefs aside
[1:00:31] and accept the word of god
[1:00:36] because the elect of god cannot be
[1:00:38] deceived
[1:00:40] in first john 3 12 it tells us that
[1:00:42] cain's worked for evil while abel's was
[1:00:44] righteous
[1:00:45] right first john 3 12.
[1:00:48] let's read the scripture he said not as
[1:00:50] cain was of that wicked one and slew his
[1:00:52] brother and wherefore slew him because
[1:00:54] his own works were evil and his brothers
[1:00:56] were righteous what was what are we
[1:00:57] seeing here
[1:00:58] we're seeing each seed producing after
[1:01:01] its kind
[1:01:01] the tear can only be a tear because his
[1:01:04] that's a seed life that is in it
[1:01:06] the wheat can only be weak because
[1:01:07] that's a seed life that is in it and
[1:01:09] here cain worked with evil abel's works
[1:01:10] was righteous
[1:01:11] because of the seed that was in them
[1:01:20] in hebrews 11 and 4 you don't have to
[1:01:21] turn to that one but it says by faith
[1:01:23] abel offered unto god a more excellent
[1:01:24] sacrifice than
[1:01:25] cain did by which he obtained witness
[1:01:27] that he was righteous god testifying of
[1:01:29] his gift
[1:01:29] and it by it being yet dead yet speaking
[1:01:32] i want you to understand something
[1:01:34] here we are now blessed are your eyes
[1:01:35] for they see blessed are your ears for
[1:01:37] this here father why do you speak unto
[1:01:38] them in parables because it's not given
[1:01:39] unto them to know the mysteries of the
[1:01:41] kingdom
[1:01:41] accuracy a blessing now when it comes
[1:01:44] time for these two boys cain and abel to
[1:01:45] come
[1:01:46] and to try to find a relationship and
[1:01:47] fellowship back with god
[1:01:49] here both boys come both are bringing
[1:01:50] their sacrifice to god
[1:01:52] because both of them want to enter back
[1:01:53] into relationship and fellowship with
[1:01:55] god
[1:01:55] but notice when they come to present
[1:01:57] their sacrifices their sacrifices
[1:01:59] is on two ends of the spectrum
[1:02:04] one is blood the other one is the fruit
[1:02:06] of the ground
[1:02:08] and cain offered the very thing that god
[1:02:10] cursed remember he told adam he said
[1:02:12] adam you're not cursed he said but
[1:02:13] cursed is the ground for thy sake
[1:02:16] but able by revelation
[1:02:19] saw something that his brother could not
[1:02:22] see
[1:02:23] and he looked into the mind of god and
[1:02:25] he knew that it was a lamb slain before
[1:02:27] the foundation of the world
[1:02:29] and by faith he offered god a lamb
[1:02:31] knowing that he saw something that cain
[1:02:33] couldn't see
[1:02:40] notice now first john 3 9.
[1:02:44] first john 3 9 i'm going to come to a
[1:02:46] stopping place in just a moment just
[1:02:47] give me a few more moments
[1:02:49] first john 3 9 whosoever is born of god
[1:02:54] doth not commit sin for his
[1:02:57] seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin
[1:02:59] because he
[1:03:00] is not is now born of god
[1:03:05] this phrase born of god means proceeded
[1:03:08] forth
[1:03:09] and came from god a child
[1:03:12] comes from a seed
[1:03:16] a child i want you to grab that now a
[1:03:19] child
[1:03:19] comes from a seed and the seed is in the
[1:03:23] loins of the father
[1:03:26] the thing that constitutes a child is it
[1:03:29] first
[1:03:30] had to be a seed
[1:03:35] the only reason you're here today is
[1:03:37] because of the seed that was in your
[1:03:38] father's lawn
[1:03:40] and so the to the thing that comes
[1:03:41] through the child is you had to be a
[1:03:42] seed and the life of the child
[1:03:44] comes from the father so if i am a child
[1:03:47] of god
[1:03:48] when did i become his child
[1:03:52] this is an important question well
[1:03:53] brother chris i was you know i went to
[1:03:55] the altar on such and such a date is
[1:03:56] that when i become a child of god no
[1:04:01] that's when you only come to the
[1:04:02] recognition of who you really was in god
[1:04:05] amen because see turn with hebrews 7 and
[1:04:08] 9
[1:04:10] because as i said i'm not just saying
[1:04:12] these things these are things that are
[1:04:13] in the word of god and the problem with
[1:04:15] of it is is because we have failed to go
[1:04:18] to the word of god to see what the bible
[1:04:19] says and we've just accepted our child
[1:04:21] as beliefs as being right
[1:04:25] and i don't want to do that because if i
[1:04:26] take beliefs that are contrary to the
[1:04:27] word of god according to paul he said
[1:04:29] that i'm cursed and i am removed from
[1:04:30] the gospel of christ
[1:04:34] hebrews 7 and 9. and as i may say
[1:04:37] or as i may so say leave thy also
[1:04:42] who receiveth tithe paid tithes
[1:04:46] in abraham now notice this now
[1:04:50] levi also who receiveth ties
[1:04:54] paid tithes in abraham now
[1:04:57] if you are versed in the scripture
[1:04:59] you'll know
[1:05:00] that abraham is levi's great great
[1:05:04] grandfather
[1:05:05] and when levi was born abraham was
[1:05:08] already gone
[1:05:11] but yet levi paid tithes
[1:05:16] while in the loins of abraham
[1:05:19] god recognized levi generations before
[1:05:23] he
[1:05:23] ever came forth upon the earth
[1:05:27] god looked at the street line
[1:05:30] and because abraham paid tithes and
[1:05:33] levi was part of his seed he was
[1:05:36] accounted for paying tithes also
[1:05:42] i hope you see that so when does god
[1:05:45] recognize us as his children
[1:05:47] ephesians 1 4 again according as he has
[1:05:49] chosen us
[1:05:50] in him not when we're born
[1:05:54] not when you just come to the altar but
[1:05:57] god recognizes you because
[1:05:59] of a seed line a seedline
[1:06:03] and based upon the seedline god
[1:06:06] recognizes you as his children or not
[1:06:08] his children
[1:06:15] when was our name put on the book of
[1:06:17] life
[1:06:22] go ahead well brother chris i went to
[1:06:24] the altar and god wrote my name in his
[1:06:26] book no he didn't
[1:06:33] i know what the bible says let's read
[1:06:35] the bible revelation 13 8
[1:06:37] 13 7-8
[1:06:43] revelations chapter 13 verse 7 and 8.
[1:06:48] and it was given unto them to make war
[1:06:50] with the saints and to overcome them
[1:06:52] and power was given him over all
[1:06:54] kindreds and tongues and nations
[1:06:56] and all that dwell upon the earth shall
[1:06:58] worship him notice now
[1:06:59] whose names are not written in the book
[1:07:02] of life
[1:07:03] of the lamb slain from the foundation of
[1:07:07] the world
[1:07:09] so when i come to the altar and give my
[1:07:11] heart to the lord that wasn't when god
[1:07:13] wrote my name down
[1:07:14] the reason i was able to come to the
[1:07:16] altar was because my name was already in
[1:07:18] the book
[1:07:20] because as levi paid tithes in the loins
[1:07:23] of
[1:07:24] abraham god recognized me generations
[1:07:27] and
[1:07:28] way back before the foundation of the
[1:07:30] world
[1:07:32] i was in the loins of god
[1:07:35] and god placed my name in the book
[1:07:38] before there was even a world
[1:07:45] so only the only names in the lamb's
[1:07:48] book is the children of god that was
[1:07:49] chosen in him before the foundation of
[1:07:51] the world now remember some ordained to
[1:07:55] some more life to death some's name was
[1:07:57] in the book
[1:07:58] some's names wasn't in the book these
[1:08:01] before
[1:08:02] old were ordained to condemnation
[1:08:06] because they was not in the seedling
[1:08:10] abraham they wasn't in his loins as levi
[1:08:13] was so to speak
[1:08:15] amen so those whose names are not
[1:08:19] in the book cannot be god sees
[1:08:22] they are of that cursed seed
[1:08:25] notice again in first john first john 3
[1:08:30] 9 whosoever is born of god whosoever is
[1:08:34] born of god doth not commit sin for his
[1:08:39] seed remaineth in him and he cannot sin
[1:08:41] because
[1:08:41] he is born of god then he said in second
[1:08:45] timothy the second chapter verse 19
[1:08:48] he said the lord knoweth them that are
[1:08:51] his the lord
[1:08:54] knoweth them that are his so let me say
[1:08:58] this to you
[1:08:59] a father knows who his children
[1:09:02] are now with this in mind let's turn to
[1:09:06] matthew 7.
[1:09:14] i'll make these last points and then
[1:09:16] we'll pick up tonight
[1:09:19] matthew chapter 7 verse 17 to 23
[1:09:23] even so every good tree bringeth forth
[1:09:26] good fruit
[1:09:28] but a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil
[1:09:32] fruit i want you to listen to the word
[1:09:34] hear jesus speaking now
[1:09:36] even so every good tree bringeth
[1:09:39] forth good fruit but a corrupt tree
[1:09:44] bringeth forth evil fruit and a good
[1:09:48] tree cannot bring forth
[1:09:50] evil fruit neither can a corrupt tree
[1:09:53] bring forth
[1:09:54] good fruit every tree that bringeth not
[1:09:58] forth good fruit is tuned down and cast
[1:10:00] into the fire wherefore by their fruit
[1:10:04] you shall know them not everyone that
[1:10:07] saith unto me lord shall enter into the
[1:10:09] kingdom of heaven
[1:10:10] but he that doeth the will of my
[1:10:13] father which is in heaven many will say
[1:10:16] of me in that day lord lord have we not
[1:10:17] prophesied in your name
[1:10:19] and in thy name cast out devils and in
[1:10:21] thy name done many wonderful works
[1:10:23] and then i will profess unto them i
[1:10:26] never knew you
[1:10:31] now paul to timothy said the lord
[1:10:34] knoweth
[1:10:34] them that are kids
[1:10:39] and now jesus speaking he said in that
[1:10:42] day there's going to be people that's
[1:10:43] going to come they're going to say
[1:10:44] lord did we not prophesy did not cast
[1:10:46] out devils in your name and he's going
[1:10:48] to say unto them
[1:10:49] depart from me you worship in the truth
[1:10:51] i never
[1:10:52] knew you
[1:10:56] now here we find jesus speaking of two
[1:10:59] trees one is called
[1:11:02] the good tree the other
[1:11:06] is called the corrupt tree and in verse
[1:11:09] 18 he tells us
[1:11:11] that the good tree can't produce evil
[1:11:14] fruit
[1:11:16] i want you to get this now because it's
[1:11:18] important for when we pick up tonight
[1:11:20] he tells us that the good tree can't
[1:11:23] produce
[1:11:24] evil fruit and the corrupt tree
[1:11:28] can't produce or he said the good tree
[1:11:30] can't produce evil fruit in the corrupt
[1:11:32] tree can't produce
[1:11:33] good fruit because it's only it can only
[1:11:36] produce
[1:11:37] what's in the sea
[1:11:41] good tree good fruit evil tree evil
[1:11:44] fruit
[1:11:46] then in verse 19 he tells us that the
[1:11:49] corrupt
[1:11:50] tree or the cursed
[1:11:55] what he tells us they are because notice
[1:11:56] what he says and every tree that
[1:11:57] bringeth forth not good fruit and shoot
[1:11:58] down and cast into the fire remember
[1:12:00] matthew chapter 25 41
[1:12:01] he said those on the left hand you curse
[1:12:04] children
[1:12:05] curse he said unto everlasting fire
[1:12:09] when you start putting the bible
[1:12:10] together you see the pictures starting
[1:12:11] coming together there is a good tree
[1:12:13] there's a corrupt tree the good tree
[1:12:15] brings forth seed life
[1:12:18] passes seed you take an apple tree it'll
[1:12:20] bear forth fruit
[1:12:21] cut the apple open the seed in it take
[1:12:23] that seed planted into the ground what
[1:12:24] are you going to get
[1:12:26] another apple you're not going to get
[1:12:27] something contract so the life that is
[1:12:29] within the tree is the only life that it
[1:12:31] can produce
[1:12:32] so a good tree can only produce good
[1:12:34] fruit it cannot produce something
[1:12:36] evil a good tree cannot produce
[1:12:38] something evil
[1:12:39] a cursed tree can produce a cursed
[1:12:42] product though right verses 21 to 23
[1:12:46] depicts a group of religious people that
[1:12:47] worship god but their worship was in
[1:12:49] vain
[1:12:50] because in verse 23 declares to them
[1:12:51] that he did not know them
[1:12:53] now remember that according to second
[1:12:54] timothy 2 19 the lord knoweth them that
[1:12:57] are his because they were born of him
[1:12:59] and came from him
[1:13:00] cain was just as religious as abel was
[1:13:05] right they both offered sacrifices to
[1:13:07] god
[1:13:08] and verse 20 says that you will know
[1:13:10] them by the type of fruit
[1:13:12] it produces abel offered a lamb cain
[1:13:15] offered that which was cursed
[1:13:20] amen let's stand
[1:13:25] tonight we'll pick up on this go a
[1:13:26] little bit further with it
[1:13:30] just slay these things into your hearts
[1:13:32] to your minds
[1:13:34] because it's important that we don't
[1:13:38] just
[1:13:38] take beliefs things that
[1:13:43] that's just been fostered to us
[1:13:46] that my mom's taught me my dad's taught
[1:13:48] me the church has always taught me
[1:13:51] the saints of god we've got to be
[1:13:52] careful that the only ones that's going
[1:13:55] to make it
[1:13:56] is those that believe this whole word of
[1:13:57] god everything else
[1:14:01] paul said will remove you from the
[1:14:03] gospel of christ
[1:14:05] and he said if any man come preaching
[1:14:07] any other gospel than what this bible
[1:14:08] says he said let that man be accursed
[1:14:10] and those that believe that cursed word
[1:14:12] are cursed right with it
[1:14:14] but you know what the amazing thing
[1:14:15] about it is the elect of god cannot be
[1:14:17] deceived because satan can only deceive
[1:14:19] the world
[1:14:20] and jesus said speaking to the elect he
[1:14:22] said i pray for them
[1:14:24] what was he praying for he was praying
[1:14:25] that we would not be deceived that we
[1:14:27] would come to the full revelation of his
[1:14:28] word
[1:14:30] i pray for them but i don't pray for the
[1:14:32] world
[1:14:34] i'm glad to this morning because i know
[1:14:36] of an assurance
[1:14:37] within my heart that i'm part of them
[1:14:39] that jesus prayed for
[1:14:41] i know of assurance that i'm one of
[1:14:43] those that was chosen god before the
[1:14:44] foundation of the world
[1:14:46] and he placed my name on the book then
[1:14:47] when i came to hear the word of god
[1:14:49] i believe i didn't just take some man's
[1:14:52] ideas for it
[1:14:53] i didn't just take what somebody taught
[1:14:55] me but i wanted to know what the bible
[1:14:57] had to say
[1:14:58] amen let's just bow our hearts to the
[1:15:00] lord this morning
[1:15:02] heavenly father we're just
[1:15:05] lord so in awe at your word god
[1:15:08] realizing that
[1:15:10] lord that heaven and earth have passed
[1:15:12] away
[1:15:13] but your word won't god we realize that
[1:15:17] even as we close with the scripture
[1:15:19] father no we'll pick up on it again
[1:15:20] tonight
[1:15:22] but in matthew 7 there was people lord
[1:15:24] that came
[1:15:25] lord they had prophecy they had signs
[1:15:29] they had wonders they had miracles
[1:15:32] but there was something that they didn't
[1:15:35] have
[1:15:37] and lord whatever they lacked that's
[1:15:39] what i want
[1:15:41] because god i realize that the fruit of
[1:15:43] the believer because you said in matthew
[1:15:44] 7 and 20
[1:15:45] wherefore by their fruits you shall know
[1:15:47] them lord by simply looking at the word
[1:15:50] i realize and i know
[1:15:51] that the fruit of a believer is not sign
[1:15:54] wonders and miracles
[1:15:55] the fruit of the believer isn't whether
[1:15:57] a person prophesies it isn't whether
[1:15:58] they speak in tongues it isn't whether
[1:16:00] they run up and down the aisles
[1:16:02] because father we know that according to
[1:16:04] the word there's going to be a lot of
[1:16:05] people that's going to do
[1:16:06] that that you're going to still even
[1:16:07] declare i never knew you
[1:16:10] you didn't come for me you didn't
[1:16:12] proceed from me
[1:16:14] and but father i want to be accounted as
[1:16:16] those that you declare
[1:16:17] welcome my good and faithful servant
[1:16:19] lord not just someone that
[1:16:21] that fostered beliefs that was contrary
[1:16:23] to the word of god
[1:16:24] but lord i want to be one of those that
[1:16:26] was so humble myself
[1:16:28] god that i won't try to take things and
[1:16:30] filter it through my beliefs
[1:16:32] but god i'll take your word for what it
[1:16:34] says lord knowing
[1:16:35] god that when everything else fails and
[1:16:37] everything else passes away
[1:16:39] it's your word that's going to remain
[1:16:41] and lord it's going to be those that are
[1:16:43] standing and are founded within your
[1:16:46] unadulterated word
[1:16:48] god that is going to be accounted as a
[1:16:49] seed of the righteous
[1:16:51] we just asked it lord that you take what
[1:16:53] we've read the things we've spoken this
[1:16:54] morning
[1:16:56] god knowing we've covered a lot of
[1:16:57] scripture maybe even brought a lot of
[1:16:59] things out that maybe the people hasn't
[1:17:01] looked at
[1:17:02] but lord it's in your word and that's
[1:17:04] what i believe
[1:17:05] father help us this morning god that we
[1:17:07] won't reject your truth
[1:17:09] god that we won't just turn it down
[1:17:10] because it's contrary to what
[1:17:12] our parents have taught us god is
[1:17:14] contrary to what
[1:17:16] maybe the church that we was raised in
[1:17:17] has taught us but god let us so humble
[1:17:19] ourselves that we'll say lord
[1:17:21] i was taught wrong and today i accept
[1:17:24] your word as the truth of god
[1:17:25] we just commit our lives into your hands
[1:17:28] for your glory
[1:17:29] in jesus christ's name we pray amen
