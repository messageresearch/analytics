[33:20] heaven as you told us to do Lord God so
[33:23] we thank you God for this day bless us
[33:25] now in Jesus Christ's name and the saint
[33:26] said amen God bless you as you're being
[33:29] seated praise the Lord
[33:33] we'll take this thought here today oh I
[33:35] just got to text from Brother bang he
[33:36] said James is sick
[33:38] he's been got a stomach flu
[33:41] and so forth so we'll have to pray for
[33:43] him at the end of service so
[33:46] James the birthday was on Friday so we
[33:48] have to do something I missed that one
[33:49] so I told the kids yesterday I said we
[33:51] got to make up for that we gotta maybe
[33:53] we can do that today I don't know we'll
[33:54] see
[33:55] today's supposed to be mom's day Monday
[33:58] we gotta
[34:00] maybe I can do that tomorrow
[34:04] so we thank God for his grace amen thank
[34:06] God for his Mercy
[34:08] so you want to look at this thought just
[34:09] a simple thought on Mary highly favored
[34:12] of the Lord praise God so we uh we look
[34:14] at this scripture here and we see we see
[34:16] this was about bc7
[34:19] uh
[34:21] so if you study the scripture and you
[34:22] study history you know Jesus was born
[34:24] before it switched over from BC to A.D
[34:27] um
[34:28] so we we see here that the Lord Jesus
[34:30] here his mother was being prepared here
[34:34] by the angel of the Lord Gabriel and I
[34:37] just heard brother Adam say this week
[34:38] you know there's lots of minor angels He
[34:40] said but when God wants to do something
[34:42] great he sends a major Angel he'll send
[34:45] Gabriel he'll send Michael wormwood you
[34:48] know there's other of course numerous
[34:50] angels that we know by name
[34:52] but here God is going to do something
[34:54] major and think about a church you know
[34:56] uh the world the world had been waiting
[34:58] for messiah for 4 000 years
[35:01] they'd heard about him since the Garden
[35:02] of Eden there's going to come one that's
[35:05] going to bruise the head of the serpent
[35:06] he's eventually going to come one and
[35:09] and for four thousand years they'd
[35:11] waited and waited and waited and even
[35:13] 800 years before this Isaiah had
[35:15] prophesied that a virgin would conceive
[35:18] and think about I mean all the different
[35:20] interpretations that that could have
[35:21] come out of that over 800 years well I
[35:24] just think it means a a spiritual
[35:26] version to the word of God and it has to
[35:29] mean that it's been 800 years and this
[35:31] couldn't happen and
[35:33] no no doubt people had wondered about it
[35:35] for hundreds and hundreds and no doubt
[35:37] thousands of years until finally
[35:40] an angel came and finds a virgin here
[35:43] we'd say a teenage girl brother Brandon
[35:46] says a teenage girl and I like I like
[35:48] the the drama brother Bradham gives he
[35:50] said he says every Saturday after
[35:53] synagogue Joseph and Mary they were
[35:55] espoused you know and they would go home
[35:57] to to one of their family's house and
[36:00] just talk about what the the minister
[36:02] said and brother random said one
[36:04] Saturday uh
[36:06] they went home and talked about that
[36:08] Isaiah scripture that a virgin would
[36:10] conceive and they thought my what an
[36:12] amazing thing this would be well wow God
[36:15] is so great someday there's going to
[36:17] come a woman who's going to conceive the
[36:19] Christ child and brother Adam said the
[36:21] reason God could come to them was
[36:24] because the word meant so much to them
[36:26] that they spoke about it when they went
[36:28] home
[36:29] right they were they were both thinking
[36:31] about the word of God so often and they
[36:33] would go home and they would they would
[36:35] just not go to church and say well it
[36:37] was a nice service but which we all
[36:39] thank God for nice services but they
[36:41] would go home and meditate they would
[36:43] take what they heard and then discuss it
[36:46] when they got home
[36:47] now remember church this is also in the
[36:49] Book of Malachi let's go to Malachi it
[36:51] says just a few paper a few turns of the
[36:53] paper over before Matthew there
[36:56] brings to thought this scripture
[37:00] Malachi chapter 2 I believe it is about
[37:02] about those that think about the Lord
[37:04] and meditate on the things of God
[37:13] yeah this just come to came to my mind
[37:15] here let me see if I can find anybody
[37:16] find that one about uh
[37:18] there's a book of remembrance yeah
[37:19] there's I'm sorry chapter 3 verse 16.
[37:21] yeah I'm sorry 316. my friend Jacob all
[37:24] about preached on this recently at the
[37:25] middle school Bible Club so it was fresh
[37:27] on my mind the Malachi 3 16. then they
[37:31] that feared the Lord spake often one to
[37:34] another
[37:35] and the Lord hearken now look at that
[37:37] you see it's a cause and effect the more
[37:40] we talk about God the more God will
[37:43] hearken to our desires
[37:45] you have to make sure we fill our
[37:47] conversations with the Lord
[37:49] and all that God has spoken all that God
[37:51] is doing all that God is going to do
[37:53] praise God testifying about what he has
[37:55] done
[37:56] see they when you when they When We Fear
[37:58] God the Bible says we fear God we speak
[38:01] often one to another about God and the
[38:03] Lord hearkens and he hears it now that's
[38:05] exactly what happened with Joseph and
[38:07] Mary Amen brother man said they were
[38:09] just talking about the things of God
[38:10] talking about God fulfilling his word
[38:13] and the anticipation of a messiah coming
[38:17] and then the Bible said a book of
[38:19] remembrance was written before him
[38:21] speaking of the Lord for them that
[38:23] feared the Lord
[38:24] and that thought upon his name now this
[38:26] must be a book of remembrance for
[38:28] rewards right like the angel told
[38:31] Cornelius he said there's a memorial up
[38:34] in heaven for all your praying you're
[38:36] fasting and you're giving of alms there
[38:38] must be some book of remembrance that's
[38:39] a memorial as well
[38:41] and and the more we talk about God here
[38:44] the more we testify about God here the
[38:46] Bible said God has a book that's written
[38:49] right before him not not our names on
[38:51] the Lamb's Book of Life that's different
[38:53] this is a book of remembrance praise God
[38:55] just like Mary and Joseph talking about
[38:57] the things of God and pretty soon God
[38:59] hearkens to their requests oh my God
[39:01] Amen thank God Hallelujah God hears our
[39:04] prayers amen no and beyond that God
[39:06] here's our conversations praise God
[39:09] God wants to testify in our
[39:11] conversations about his promises and how
[39:13] Faithful Is I admire Mike McCloskey that
[39:16] man has testified for 14 years I believe
[39:18] that God's going to heal him and raise
[39:19] him up out of that wheelchair he still
[39:21] says it he still says I'm already healed
[39:23] I'm just waiting on the manifestation of
[39:25] it
[39:26] just a beautiful testimony now church I
[39:28] believe God's writing that down the
[39:30] Bible said that the more we talk about
[39:31] it God writes it down in heaven amen
[39:34] Hallelujah for them that fear God and
[39:37] that thought upon his name
[39:40] Hallelujah verse 17 and they shall be
[39:42] mine saith the Lord of hosts in that day
[39:45] when I make up my jewels and I will
[39:47] spare them as a man's Spirit his son his
[39:51] own son that serveth him now look here
[39:54] God calls you one of his jewels praise
[39:56] God
[39:58] Hallelujah he doesn't call you his trash
[40:01] amen he calls you his jewels amen his
[40:05] valuable stones don't the bible say that
[40:07] we're Lively Stones Hallelujah
[40:09] we're living stones amen we're not a
[40:12] deadstone or we're most stones are dead
[40:14] but not us we're living stones
[40:16] Hallelujah we've got we're stones that
[40:18] have life Hallelujah we have the life of
[40:20] God in us amen
[40:22] so we're solid like a stone we have
[40:23] these attributes like a stone we're part
[40:25] of a foundation we're part of a building
[40:27] but we're not dead we are alive
[40:29] hallelujah oh thank God
[40:32] then he calls us jewels
[40:35] Hallelujah by jewels and I will spare
[40:38] them as a man spareth his own son so
[40:40] here we even see God's mercy to those
[40:42] that talk about him uh God's Mercy is to
[40:44] his his people his jewels his living
[40:46] stones praise God
[40:49] Verse 18 then shall ye return and
[40:51] discern between the righteous and the
[40:53] wicked now of course the beginning of
[40:54] Israel but I believe there are some
[40:55] spiritual type Force as well
[40:58] so the ye shall return
[41:00] he and and the Bible says between him
[41:03] that serveth God and him that servth him
[41:06] not
[41:07] so so God is speaking of a faithful
[41:09] remnant of Jews here
[41:11] that because they talk about God all the
[41:13] time they Fellowship about God all the
[41:15] time God's right God right down God
[41:18] writes down their names rather sorry and
[41:20] they make up his jewels and then they
[41:23] will have the ability to discern good
[41:24] and evil Hallelujah like I told virtue I
[41:27] think on should come up for prayer on
[41:28] Wednesday night and and uh
[41:31] I said well her prayer request related
[41:34] to you know being a mature Christian I
[41:36] said remember what the Bible says
[41:38] I said are we going to be milk drinkers
[41:40] are we going to be meat eaters
[41:42] I said and she said the right answer she
[41:44] said we want to eat meat and that's what
[41:46] we want we want to be mature Christians
[41:48] and what is meaning though it's
[41:49] Discerning between Good and Evil
[41:52] in church I'll tell you there's many god
[41:53] let's just go through trials where
[41:55] sometimes we don't know right and wrong
[41:57] sometimes the truth is so close or
[42:00] sometimes a lie is so close to the truth
[42:03] but God allows that because he wants us
[42:06] to go through tests he wants us in the
[42:08] midst of our questions the crowd to him
[42:10] for the answers amen he wants us to
[42:12] learn to lean upon him and every
[42:14] question recognize there is an answer
[42:16] God Is The Answer amen
[42:18] amen hallelujah and that he's writing
[42:20] down all those that talk about God all
[42:23] those that think about that thought upon
[42:25] his name did you ever just do that just
[42:27] think about the name of Jesus
[42:29] Jesus Hallelujah Jesus just think about
[42:32] his name amen and the Bible said he's
[42:34] writing down your name in a book
[42:36] Hallelujah
[42:37] oh thank God
[42:39] and he will remember and then he'll
[42:41] hearken to repress let's do that today
[42:43] praise God on this Mother's Day amen
[42:44] let's let's think about god let's talk
[42:47] about God and let's expect God to
[42:49] hearken to our requests amen
[42:51] God is faithful God does love me God God
[42:54] answers prayer God has answered so many
[42:56] prayers before however God's been
[42:58] gracious to me Hallelujah and I know
[42:59] that I know that he's writing down he's
[43:01] seeing what's going on now he sees my
[43:03] heart praise God and I know he's going
[43:05] to answer my request Hallelujah oh my
[43:08] what a blessing what a great scripture
[43:10] here
[43:11] now regret regarding the the the I want
[43:14] to get to this the highly favored here
[43:17] it just means uh just we I say just
[43:19] means because the Catholic Church makes
[43:21] this uh a scripture of worship of Mary
[43:25] um
[43:26] but it just means that that the Bible or
[43:29] the the concordance says one who's
[43:31] received Grace from the Lord one who's a
[43:34] blessed uh to a certain degree above the
[43:38] Lord and church we just have to you know
[43:40] start you have just have to think about
[43:42] it a little bit that that God has called
[43:44] some people to hire callings than others
[43:47] some people have five talents some
[43:48] people have two or one now that's just
[43:50] the general uh this is General
[43:52] description Jesus gives but we also know
[43:54] there's nine gifts of the Spirit
[43:57] there's five preaching gifts and so
[43:59] people can have a mixture of those
[44:01] and we have to we just have to trust
[44:03] that that like the parable says God knew
[44:06] which or God knew how many talents each
[44:09] worker could handle
[44:10] because the Bible said he gives us
[44:12] talents according to his to his ability
[44:15] the Bible says
[44:17] Hallelujah and so whatever God gives us
[44:20] we ought to be thankful and then we
[44:22] ought to invest in it as much as we can
[44:23] praise God
[44:25] right I mean that's that's just what the
[44:27] parable tells us he gives each one all
[44:30] that according to their ability so think
[44:32] about that you know God God gave uh
[44:34] brother random or God gave John the
[44:36] Baptist and and and Jeremiah and Enoch
[44:40] and and Moses and Joshua these prophets
[44:42] of God he gave them the most amount of
[44:46] responsibility
[44:48] right we we get we have to remember not
[44:51] to be uh not to be discouraged maybe if
[44:54] God didn't make us a prophet which all
[44:55] of us can say amen I mean God didn't
[44:57] make us all prophets if we did we would
[44:59] be having visions from from just a young
[45:02] child
[45:03] because their form from their mother's
[45:05] womb praise God
[45:07] a prophet is formed a prophet is built
[45:10] designed from his mother's womb praise
[45:12] God
[45:14] and so we can all we can all just have
[45:17] confidence that whatever God made us to
[45:18] be that that you know as as long as we
[45:21] yield to God God is going to bring out
[45:23] all that's in our lives and God's going
[45:25] to help us to fulfill uh what he's
[45:28] called us to do
[45:30] like I was talking to Brother John last
[45:31] you know last Saturday brother John
[45:33] grahaman and we're talking about being
[45:34] fulfilled now Church which one of us
[45:37] which one of us wants to be fulfilled
[45:39] like we want to live a life of
[45:40] fulfillment like you know as we go
[45:43] through the years like I thank God I see
[45:45] what God's doing in my life how many
[45:46] want to see what God's doing in your
[45:47] life
[45:48] I mean I think that's one of the
[45:49] greatest blessings we could have is in
[45:51] other words that we know we're in the
[45:53] will of God
[45:55] we feel we feel fulfilled and the best
[45:58] way to do that is to obey the word of
[46:00] God hallelujah and to keep to keep the
[46:03] commands of God hallelujah
[46:05] to be fulfilled and so Mary
[46:09] you know she that scripture and think
[46:12] about that the scripture meant so much
[46:13] sir from Isaiah about a virgin shall
[46:15] conceive because she was the one that
[46:16] was going to do it
[46:18] got it ordained her that scripture now
[46:20] which scriptures mean a lot to you amen
[46:22] hallelujah I believe there's some key in
[46:24] there there's some key to your life in
[46:26] there Hallelujah the verses that mean so
[46:29] much to you
[46:30] now we all look at the Rapture verses
[46:31] that means a lot to us hallelujah
[46:33] it does mean a lot to us that's why
[46:35] we're living like we're leaving amen
[46:38] praise God we should live our lives like
[46:40] we're going to leave this place behind
[46:42] amen
[46:43] because here we have no continuing City
[46:45] but there we go to a city whose Builder
[46:48] and maker is God hallelujah amen and
[46:50] it's a kingdom it's a city that cannot
[46:52] be moved Hallelujah
[46:54] that's where we're going praise God
[46:57] and we see you know this scripture about
[47:00] highly favored
[47:02] you know there's think about that
[47:03] there's going to be no other woman like
[47:05] Mary a virgin that would conceive
[47:09] there was no other uh
[47:11] interesting there's I mean there's only
[47:14] two men that never died
[47:16] you're not gonna Elijah
[47:18] there's no other places
[47:19] until the the bride of Christ praise God
[47:22] who's changing a moment a drinking of an
[47:24] eye amen there's just a few that are
[47:26] chosen in these things
[47:29] you know and and those people that have
[47:31] chosen are highly favored but it's not
[47:34] all a bed of roses
[47:36] we do got some roses out there everybody
[47:38] let it be a reminder that it's not all
[47:40] the better roses there's some thorns on
[47:42] the Roses
[47:44] as we'll see here with Mary
[47:49] you know I I just flipped over my Bible
[47:51] and I was looking at the wrong chapter
[47:53] and it went right to the chapter I I
[47:55] actually would like to read uh so we go
[47:57] to Luke 11 here I thought was really
[48:00] really something Luke 11 27 and 28. I
[48:04] was looking for Luke 1 28 I went to Luke
[48:06] 11 28 by accident but it turned out to
[48:09] actually work really good
[48:10] Luke 11 27 and it came to pass as he
[48:13] spake these things a certain woman of
[48:14] the company lifted up her voice and say
[48:16] on him blessed is the womb that barely
[48:18] suck and the paps which thou has sucked
[48:21] now look again here's this Mary worship
[48:24] right
[48:26] so I'm blessing the woman that brought
[48:29] forth the Christ child blessed is she
[48:32] now no doubt she was blessed we just
[48:34] read it the Bible said she was highly
[48:36] favored
[48:38] but in this case the person has has put
[48:41] the wrong influence the wrong uh Honor
[48:45] on Mary
[48:47] in this sin in this situation the honor
[48:49] wasn't supposed to go to Mary
[48:51] the honor Jesus directs where the honor
[48:54] goes it is a great blessing for Mary to
[48:57] have brought forth the Christ child it
[49:00] was a great blessing for Enoch and
[49:01] Elijah not to die but God Jesus plainly
[49:04] tells us there's greater blessings than
[49:06] that praise God in other words the the
[49:08] main blessing we should seek for is to
[49:11] keep the word of God hallelujah
[49:14] amen
[49:16] not to we don't want to get on the the
[49:19] side of you know worshiping someone or
[49:20] giving someone too much honor like they
[49:23] do to brother Bradham
[49:24] right like they do some people do to uh
[49:27] to John Wesley right or Martin Luther
[49:29] they give them too much honor
[49:32] right we we must honor all God's
[49:34] servants and Mary and we must honor the
[49:36] Bible says to do that
[49:38] the Bible said there are a cloud of
[49:40] witnesses up in heaven praise God
[49:44] but we can't we don't want to go too far
[49:46] because Jesus says blessed are they
[49:48] rather that hear the word of God and
[49:51] keep it praise God oh it's a great
[49:53] blessing for us to hear the word of God
[49:56] and keep it
[49:57] and remember that great scripture Jesus
[49:59] told uh Thomas
[50:02] he said you're more blessed to have not
[50:05] seen a miracle and still believed well
[50:08] in our minds we think well I've been
[50:09] seen America I'm not blessed but Jesus
[50:10] said you're more blessed if you believe
[50:12] when you haven't seen amen
[50:15] amen so see our thinking is often
[50:16] opposite of what gods is
[50:19] right because we just we get carnal
[50:20] we're prone to wonder Lord I feel it
[50:23] praise God prone to leave the God I love
[50:27] so what we need is the right meditations
[50:29] upon the word of God in other words be
[50:32] thankful for what God's done in our life
[50:34] be thankful for the favor God has given
[50:37] to us amen because what does favor mean
[50:39] favor means Grace
[50:42] if you actually look at the definition
[50:43] of Grace it means favored
[50:47] and you're saved by what God's grace
[50:50] you're saved by God's favor and it was
[50:53] not any work of your own
[50:55] it was not a work of I wasn't saved by
[50:57] my grace or my favor I was saved by
[51:00] God's grace and favor Hallelujah not by
[51:02] my works by God's works
[51:06] so I just want to start with that that
[51:07] Luke
[51:08] one there what a beautiful scripture
[51:10] here and I'll be good I'll be getting
[51:11] that back to that in a moment but I just
[51:13] want to say how what brother Brandon
[51:14] said here about mothers I want to read
[51:15] this I and I'm not sure I read this
[51:17] every year but Brother Brad says quote
[51:19] mayor I'm sorry mother is so great
[51:23] now this is not worship right let's
[51:25] let's make sure we say we're not worse
[51:27] been married today and we're not
[51:28] worshiping our moms
[51:30] because they're not worthy of worship
[51:32] but they are worthy of honor
[51:36] mother's so great you know the first one
[51:38] that receives you in this life is your
[51:40] mother
[51:42] no one can touch you because you're
[51:44] conceived and she Bears you under her
[51:46] heart
[51:47] she's the first one to know you the
[51:50] first two in this life to hold you
[51:54] then when you're born she's the one
[51:56] she's the first hands that touch you and
[51:58] wipes back the tears out of your eye
[52:00] she's the first one to Pat you and to
[52:03] love you
[52:04] and to coo over you I've seen it eight
[52:06] times
[52:08] Kristen's really good at cooing
[52:10] in this in this life is your mother now
[52:13] I think that there is not enough honor
[52:15] that we could give to a mother
[52:19] mother is the first with the child and
[52:21] she's a great responsibility of what
[52:24] that child will be will be based upon
[52:26] the way that mother starts that child on
[52:28] the path that it must travel
[52:31] mother has a responsibility from God to
[52:33] place that child on the right Road and I
[52:35] think that's why mothers has a special
[52:37] little touch
[52:40] think about you know Brotherhood talks
[52:43] about Jacob bed being jacobed
[52:46] you know guided Moses's life she told
[52:49] him there's a prophecy on your life
[52:52] you're meant to be a deliverer you were
[52:54] drawn out of water you should you know
[52:56] according to the world you should have
[52:57] been killed but God rescued you and God
[53:00] exalted you
[53:01] and he never forgot that at 40 years old
[53:04] it came into his heart and he tried to
[53:06] fulfill that promise with his own power
[53:08] but he found out I could only kill one
[53:11] Egyptian I can kill one stink in
[53:13] Egyptian with my own power but with
[53:14] God's power all things are possible with
[53:16] God's power amen
[53:18] and all the credit of Moses like brother
[53:20] rabbit says he said give that credit to
[53:22] jochebed
[53:24] who formed his character
[53:26] think about John the Baptist John the
[53:29] Baptist and think about Samson these men
[53:31] couldn't they were nazarites they could
[53:33] not achieved their purpose unless their
[53:35] moms had kept them from the wine
[53:38] and Samson from cutting his hair
[53:40] think about that Samson never would have
[53:42] had a gate a massive two-ton gate or
[53:45] whatever on his shoulders Samson never
[53:47] would have ripped the line apart unless
[53:49] the mom obeyed the word of God oh
[53:51] mothers amen
[53:52] may God encourage our mothers today amen
[53:55] keep the word of God hallelujah honor
[53:58] God's word train your children up in the
[54:00] ways of God God will use them and bless
[54:02] them beyond our wildest thoughts amen
[54:05] like my mom I was texting my mom today
[54:08] telling her how much I loved her happy
[54:10] Mother's Day and
[54:13] probably be better if I just read it
[54:15] I'll probably chop it up
[54:20] she said my dear son you and your
[54:22] siblings have made me say it was worth
[54:24] all the hardship and suffering we went
[54:26] through together
[54:27] in Christ Jesus our lord
[54:30] Hallelujah
[54:32] amen it was worth it all
[54:34] to see children that love the Lord and
[54:37] want to serve God hallelujah
[54:41] she's got three preachers out of all
[54:42] that suffering too praise God hallelujah
[54:46] thank the Lord for that
[54:48] she said I'm so thankful for children
[54:50] that are serving their Lord and Master
[54:53] the Lord Jesus Christ have a wonderful
[54:55] day with your precious family
[54:57] I think that's a special praise God
[55:03] but you know brother man said the same
[55:05] thing about uh Abraham Lincoln you know
[55:08] he only had a few books growing up one
[55:10] of them was the Bible
[55:12] and brother Adam said that I don't know
[55:13] if this is true but he said Abe Lincoln
[55:14] said if there could be any good thing
[55:17] found in me it's because of a Godly
[55:19] mother that reared me to serve the Lord
[55:21] I don't know if Abe Lincoln said that
[55:23] but brother Ram said he did
[55:25] now I don't know if that's right or not
[55:27] all I know is that I if he did say that
[55:30] I agree with it
[55:32] because my life was formed mainly by my
[55:35] mother
[55:36] right
[55:38] and so that's why I like that I like the
[55:40] man he says not sure if this is oh yeah
[55:43] he said uh
[55:44] if there's any good found in me praise
[55:47] God let it be because of the influences
[55:49] that were upon me praise God
[55:51] and church don't you know God he
[55:53] orchestrated all those influences to be
[55:55] around you as a child so you'd raise up
[55:58] and you become the person the
[56:00] christ-loving person that you are today
[56:01] praise God Amen Hallelujah
[56:06] even though even in some of the darkest
[56:08] testimonies like we've heard brother
[56:09] Austin say his childhood you know even
[56:11] in some of the darkest cases God was
[56:14] still in that God was still forming a
[56:17] testimony from that
[56:19] right because now Austin will he will
[56:22] change the cycle praise God he will he
[56:25] will overcome the curse praise God
[56:27] because he's been on that side of it so
[56:29] even in our pain God's with us in the
[56:31] pay just like he's with us on the
[56:33] Mountaintop praise God
[56:36] like my uncle told me who passed away
[56:37] you know the reason your dad left you is
[56:39] so you'll never leave your children and
[56:40] I agree I agree I know what it's like to
[56:43] be left
[56:44] but it's a lesson I learned but I also
[56:47] learned that Jesus never left me praise
[56:49] God and all that amen
[56:51] and I can handle it because he was with
[56:53] me praise God
[56:55] and he promised he would not give me
[56:57] anything he would not give you anything
[56:58] that you and I could not handle
[57:01] right temptation is common to all men
[57:03] praise God but with every Temptation he
[57:06] makes a way of Escape Hallelujah ah
[57:08] there's always an exit door there's
[57:10] always a way out and God always shows us
[57:12] the way out and God makes us more than a
[57:14] conqueror in Christ Jesus
[57:16] Hallelujah I just want to encourage you
[57:18] brother Adam says he says Mother's Day
[57:21] He says they make a lot of money out of
[57:22] off of Flowers and Things
[57:25] but Mother's Day should be every day not
[57:27] send her a bunch of flowers on mother
[57:28] day but love her and care for her 365
[57:31] days and nights through the year
[57:35] but of course the commercial world has
[57:37] got a great hold on in these things like
[57:39] this and it depreciates the mother look
[57:42] so Mother's Day depreciates if you only
[57:44] do nice things for her on Mother's Day
[57:48] it actually decreases her value well
[57:51] she's she's only valuable one day out of
[57:53] the year that's why every day's got to
[57:55] be Thanksgiving Every Day's got to be
[57:57] Mother's Day every day's got to be
[57:58] Christmas
[58:00] let me say this every day ought to be
[58:01] Father's Day
[58:04] no I'm just kidding
[58:06] every day is Father's day because you
[58:07] all love me so well my family my wife
[58:09] loves me so well
[58:10] every day is Father's day I'm just glad
[58:12] I got a Heavenly Father praise God
[58:14] that's that because that's all that
[58:15] really matters I'll fail as a father
[58:17] every every father mother Earthly mother
[58:19] father will fail we honor them but God
[58:22] is the ultimate mother and father
[58:24] we thank God for his grace today
[58:26] Hallelujah
[58:27] brother says
[58:29] oh he's talking about a sinner oh well
[58:31] last Mother's Day I sent her a bunch of
[58:33] flowers brother Brandon said she'd
[58:34] appreciate a whole lot more if you just
[58:37] sat down and talked to her just a little
[58:39] bit
[58:40] he says write her a line which might be
[58:43] a
[58:44] telegram what do they call those
[58:46] what was it was it telegram the
[58:48] old-fashioned text messages
[58:50] that cost a lot of money
[58:52] to send one
[58:54] he said or Pat her on the shoulder
[58:57] so today you might want to Pat your mom
[58:58] on the shoulder
[59:00] kiss her on the cheek
[59:03] tell her you love her
[59:06] he said it'll go a lot further than all
[59:09] the flowers that you can buy from the
[59:11] florist
[59:15] so let's remember that today and like I
[59:17] said I know there's harder situations
[59:18] than others you know we talked about
[59:19] that
[59:20] but even in the midst of the trials
[59:22] that's an opportunity to express the
[59:24] Divine Love Of Christ
[59:28] I thank God for our family members our
[59:31] brothers who do that like guys our
[59:32] sisters who do that it's not always easy
[59:35] but God's grace overcomes Hallelujah
[59:41] now brother bam even says in what was
[59:42] the Holy Ghost given for 1959
[59:45] he talks about a
[59:48] uh he said he's talking about a young
[59:50] young lady he said you might be the best
[59:52] dressed woman in the country you might
[59:53] be the prettiest you might be the best
[59:55] built you might be a idol to your
[59:57] husband you might be all these things
[59:59] which that's wonderful now of course
[1:00:03] it doesn't mean it's actually wonderful
[1:00:04] if you're an idol you say in other words
[1:00:06] you might you might look pretty he says
[1:00:08] but that's wonderful but sister unless
[1:00:10] you have the Holy Ghost in you which is
[1:00:13] eternal life at the end of this road
[1:00:15] you're finished
[1:00:17] right so no matter what natural
[1:00:19] blessings we do or don't get the the end
[1:00:22] of the road is what we're looking for we
[1:00:24] want a life that that tells everybody at
[1:00:26] the End of the Road God gave me eternal
[1:00:29] life amen
[1:00:31] all of our life is fleeting all of our
[1:00:34] our good looks or whatever our our happy
[1:00:37] whatever whatever we have you know
[1:00:39] whatever we have naturally it's just
[1:00:41] it's just carnal there's going to come
[1:00:43] to an end to it but there is no end to
[1:00:45] the Life of Christ amen
[1:00:47] there's no end to eternal life there's
[1:00:49] no end to the love of Jesus Hallelujah
[1:00:52] and brother Adam tells us so see we want
[1:00:53] to honor our our wives and mothers
[1:00:56] without worshiping them just like
[1:00:59] but I said you can't hardly honor mom
[1:01:01] enough
[1:01:02] right because of all that she does
[1:01:04] think about that in this age of abortion
[1:01:06] where over 65 some million babies have
[1:01:09] been aborted that's just on record out
[1:01:11] of all those that lost their lives Your
[1:01:14] Mother by God's grace kept you for those
[1:01:16] nine months
[1:01:19] right and she'd she'd rub you there
[1:01:21] she'd sing to you there I don't know
[1:01:23] what to do
[1:01:25] she'd feel your kicks hey stop kicking
[1:01:27] like that honey
[1:01:29] but she took care of you she carried you
[1:01:31] for all those nine months she suffered
[1:01:33] all those through nine months and now
[1:01:35] look what you are today praise God
[1:01:37] so there's honor that can be given
[1:01:42] and we see the same thing with uh as we
[1:01:44] said with Prophets
[1:01:46] brother Ram said this last day Prophet
[1:01:48] Messenger will have such power before
[1:01:50] the Lord Jesus that there will be those
[1:01:52] who mistake him for the Lord Jesus he
[1:01:54] said there will be a spirit in the world
[1:01:56] at the end time that will seduce some of
[1:01:58] them
[1:01:59] to believe this because Matthew 24 says
[1:02:02] for there shall rise false Christ and
[1:02:04] false prophets and shall show great
[1:02:06] signs and wonders in so much that ever
[1:02:08] were possible they shall deceive the
[1:02:09] very left
[1:02:11] he said behold I've told you before
[1:02:13] wherefore if they shall say to them
[1:02:15] behold he's in the desert going out
[1:02:17] forth behold he's in the secret Chambers
[1:02:18] believe him not
[1:02:20] brother says don't you believe it the
[1:02:22] the last day Prophet messenger is not
[1:02:25] Jesus Christ he's not the Son of God he
[1:02:28] is one of the Brethren a prophet a
[1:02:30] messenger a servant of God he needs no
[1:02:33] greater honor bestowed upon him than
[1:02:35] that which John received which he was
[1:02:37] the voice that cried I am not he but he
[1:02:40] is coming after me praise God think
[1:02:42] about the honor that men of God got in
[1:02:44] the Bible if I'm not mistaken when Moses
[1:02:47] died I Think They Mourn for a whole
[1:02:48] month if I'm not mistaken either him or
[1:02:51] Aaron no matter which one Moses might
[1:02:52] have been longer than a month
[1:02:55] now the longest
[1:02:56] funeral I've ever been to is
[1:02:59] just a few hours
[1:03:01] they'd spend a whole month in the
[1:03:04] funeral service for one one man
[1:03:06] one man that's a great honor
[1:03:10] so this is the point we're making it's
[1:03:12] okay to honor someone there's an old
[1:03:14] saying that we always they always play
[1:03:16] at uh
[1:03:17] the Veterans Day assembly
[1:03:21] it takes uh I'm sorry it takes a moment
[1:03:23] to acknowledge someone it takes an hour
[1:03:27] um just show someone you love them it
[1:03:30] takes a whole day to say you appreciate
[1:03:31] them but it takes a lifetime to forget
[1:03:33] them
[1:03:35] I thought was a nice I I mix it up I
[1:03:37] mean we could I could go on go and look
[1:03:39] it up real quick but
[1:03:40] there's this idea that you know if you
[1:03:42] really want to honor somebody it takes
[1:03:43] more time each time
[1:03:46] and then when someone passes
[1:03:48] like we've experienced family loss you
[1:03:50] know this this year then it takes a
[1:03:52] whole lifetime to forget that person
[1:03:54] because of the great love they poured
[1:03:56] out
[1:03:57] because of the care they showed
[1:03:59] because they provided for us because
[1:04:02] they loved us praise God
[1:04:05] and so this is a great it's a great
[1:04:07] thing Church to honor one another as
[1:04:09] long as it's not worship it's a great
[1:04:10] thing
[1:04:11] we see it all through the scripture
[1:04:14] and so we want to make sure we do that
[1:04:15] by God's grace I think it's a great
[1:04:17] thing to do
[1:04:18] that's why I try to build build honor
[1:04:20] into honoring my wife every week
[1:04:24] a couple times a week by the grace of
[1:04:26] God how can I honor my wife in a way
[1:04:29] that's uh
[1:04:31] that strengthens her how can I do that
[1:04:34] and so I Seek You know I seek to find
[1:04:35] more ways to do that by the grace of God
[1:04:39] by God's grace amen now I want to go
[1:04:42] back to Luke 1 28 praise God
[1:04:46] I'm gonna go back to Luke 1 20. okay
[1:04:47] here we go
[1:04:51] so church I encourage you to do that as
[1:04:53] well you know honor your husband honor
[1:04:54] your wife
[1:04:55] honor your mother honor your father find
[1:04:57] ways to do it
[1:04:59] now I've had this one on my calendar for
[1:05:00] a couple years my mom was here to cancer
[1:05:02] on August 17th so I want to find a way
[1:05:04] to honor my mom on August 17th I haven't
[1:05:07] got to it this year but I thought
[1:05:08] wouldn't it be good just take a just
[1:05:10] take a morning and honor the fact that
[1:05:11] God healed it's kind of that thought of
[1:05:13] memorials you know well there's nothing
[1:05:16] wrong with that we ought to take some
[1:05:17] time hopefully this year I can get it by
[1:05:19] God's grace because it's coming up we're
[1:05:21] almost there
[1:05:22] it's May June July August I only got
[1:05:24] three months away to August I got three
[1:05:25] months away till the next school year
[1:05:27] starts
[1:05:29] oh I'm dreading that right now
[1:05:31] we'll make it by God's grace
[1:05:35] um
[1:05:37] and so it's a good thing it's a good
[1:05:39] thing to do these things
[1:05:41] now Luke 1 28 going back here it says
[1:05:43] and the angel came into her and said
[1:05:45] hail now hail just means peace be with
[1:05:48] you or Joy be with you doesn't mean like
[1:05:49] hail like hail Hitler or something like
[1:05:51] that
[1:05:52] it just means God's peace be with you or
[1:05:55] Joy be to you peace be on you
[1:06:01] and then the Bible says
[1:06:04] here uh she was trouble I'm sorry no
[1:06:06] yeah hail Thou Art highly favored
[1:06:11] which means uh graciously accepted or
[1:06:14] much grace so God has accepted you in
[1:06:17] heaven
[1:06:18] and also God has given you much favor
[1:06:22] hallelujah praise God church we ought to
[1:06:24] be thankful whatever favor we've got
[1:06:26] from God we ought to be thankful for
[1:06:27] that
[1:06:28] because what if that favor wasn't there
[1:06:32] if you didn't have what what's the
[1:06:34] opposite of favor if you don't have
[1:06:35] God's favor what do you have you have
[1:06:37] God's punishment
[1:06:38] he's either for you God he's either for
[1:06:41] you or against you we ought to say
[1:06:43] praise God that he's for us hallelujah
[1:06:45] thank God I have some favor with God
[1:06:47] hallelujah
[1:06:48] whatever portion that is no matter how
[1:06:51] much or how little praise God
[1:06:53] want to be thankful that God has given
[1:06:55] me some favor God has given me some
[1:06:57] Grace Hallelujah people have confidence
[1:06:59] in my prayers or people people like the
[1:07:02] fellowship with me people like what I
[1:07:04] say about the Lord
[1:07:05] we ought to we ought to appreciate that
[1:07:07] and church I believe this I believe each
[1:07:09] one of us are highly favored praise God
[1:07:11] I'm just going to try to get to my main
[1:07:13] point here I'm gonna have to jump ahead
[1:07:14] my punch line
[1:07:16] that's the point I'm making as my title
[1:07:19] is Mary highly favor the Lord each one
[1:07:21] of us are highly favored of God in some
[1:07:23] way
[1:07:24] Glory
[1:07:27] hail Thou Art highly favored now I like
[1:07:31] what Albert Barnes the uh I think he was
[1:07:33] a Baptist preacher if not mistaken from
[1:07:35] the 1800s before this Eagle age came in
[1:07:37] he was under the man age he had the
[1:07:39] right anointing
[1:07:40] he said now by being mother of the long
[1:07:43] expected Messiah Mary was highly favored
[1:07:45] the mother of the Redeemer of mankind
[1:07:49] think about that
[1:07:50] long had he been predicted long had the
[1:07:53] eyes of the nation been turned to him
[1:07:54] and long had his coming but an object of
[1:07:57] intense desire
[1:07:59] to be reckoned even among Jesus's
[1:08:01] ancestors was accounted a sufficient
[1:08:04] honor for even Abraham and David
[1:08:06] just being in his family lineage meant a
[1:08:09] lot
[1:08:10] I mean don't people take advantage of
[1:08:12] that today well I'm the descendant of
[1:08:14] George Washington or you know I I mean
[1:08:17] it's an honor I I met someone a few
[1:08:19] years ago I can't remember who it was
[1:08:21] they were like the great great of some
[1:08:22] president I can't remember who it was
[1:08:24] but I was like wow you can trace it back
[1:08:26] somebody visited our school a couple
[1:08:27] years ago I can't remember who might
[1:08:28] have been Ben Franklin or John Adams or
[1:08:30] somebody one of the founding fathers
[1:08:31] here's the actual descendant I'm
[1:08:33] thinking wow this is quite an honor
[1:08:36] because your your ancestor had an
[1:08:39] amazing impact on the natural country
[1:08:42] and think about our great ancestry Jesus
[1:08:45] Christ had a great impact on all of
[1:08:47] Heaven's history Heaven's history and
[1:08:49] Earthly history praise God
[1:08:52] and then he says and then he says you
[1:08:55] are my offspring
[1:08:57] in Acts 17.
[1:09:00] wait Lydia what family you come out of
[1:09:02] Jesus's family
[1:09:05] brother amen who's your dad God
[1:09:07] almighty's your dad oh my you can go all
[1:09:10] the way back
[1:09:11] it takes a lot of Honor praise God that
[1:09:13] gives a lot of honor to you
[1:09:16] right we're we're not fatherless we're
[1:09:19] not motherless we're not orphans we're
[1:09:21] Children of the king hallelujah amen
[1:09:24] we're chilling the most high God in
[1:09:26] church at some point the whole world is
[1:09:28] going to recognize because we the Bible
[1:09:30] said we'll Rule and reign with Christ
[1:09:32] for a thousand years Hallelujah
[1:09:35] those the heathens or whatever they are
[1:09:37] whatever they are the Gentiles that
[1:09:39] during the millennial Reign they'll
[1:09:41] recognize that we were the family of God
[1:09:43] hallelujah
[1:09:45] for a thousand years when we have
[1:09:46] glorified bodies and they've got natural
[1:09:48] bodies
[1:09:52] my goodness
[1:09:55] Hallelujah
[1:09:57] if you can feel this good you know if
[1:09:58] you can feel this good in a teenage body
[1:10:00] milk how you how good are you going to
[1:10:02] feel in a glorified body
[1:10:04] if you can be that strong
[1:10:08] how good are we going to feel in a
[1:10:09] glorified body
[1:10:13] see it was a it was an honor just to be
[1:10:15] of the lineage of David
[1:10:17] or the the tribe of Judah
[1:10:20] oh the Messiah is going to come out of
[1:10:21] Judah
[1:10:22] you're in the family of the Messiah
[1:10:25] now did that make the Levites any worse
[1:10:27] no no
[1:10:30] did that make the those of Simeon any
[1:10:32] worse no no no no no
[1:10:35] but it just was their calling it just
[1:10:38] was their lot in life
[1:10:41] right so see there's people some people
[1:10:43] are going to have certain Graces given
[1:10:44] to them that you may not have but don't
[1:10:46] feel bad you've got God's grace as well
[1:10:49] praise God
[1:10:53] Hallelujah and like you know I've always
[1:10:55] gone back to that quote brother man I
[1:10:56] can't explain it my brother Adam says
[1:10:58] how much a great reward will some of
[1:11:00] these sisters get he says in the visible
[1:11:01] Union if I'm not mistaken or is it chose
[1:11:04] uh choosing of a bride brother bam said
[1:11:06] some of our sisters are going to get a
[1:11:07] greater reward than the brothers because
[1:11:09] they've had to suffer more persecution
[1:11:10] because of the way they dress
[1:11:13] and they have to give up more to become
[1:11:16] a believer
[1:11:17] that's quite a statement
[1:11:19] I'm still looking for some scripture on
[1:11:20] that but the same is true you know
[1:11:23] whatever you suffer you you're rewarded
[1:11:25] for your amount of suffering
[1:11:28] so it's something to consider but here
[1:11:30] it's a great blessing just to be
[1:11:32] in the lineage of Christ
[1:11:35] he says but Albert Barnes says but now
[1:11:38] the happy individual Mary was designated
[1:11:42] was to be his mother and on Mary
[1:11:47] no actually I'm going to stop right
[1:11:48] there before I read this next part
[1:11:49] because I want to get to that here
[1:11:51] notice the word Grace means favor
[1:11:54] Mary was highly favored and so are we
[1:11:58] remember the scriptures you know
[1:11:59] Ephesians 1 3.
[1:12:02] Ephesians 1 3 said blessed be the God
[1:12:04] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[1:12:06] has blessed us with all spiritual
[1:12:08] blessings in Heavenly places in Christ
[1:12:11] ah
[1:12:13] Church whenever we go to feeling bad we
[1:12:15] ought to open up our Bibles and read
[1:12:16] this
[1:12:17] I have every spiritual blessing that I
[1:12:21] need of
[1:12:23] right whether I'm experiencing right now
[1:12:25] or not I've got it Hallelujah
[1:12:28] that's what I mean either God's a liar
[1:12:31] right or not
[1:12:33] God's telling the truth hallelujah
[1:12:36] the truth sets me free praise God I've
[1:12:39] got every spiritual blessing that I'll
[1:12:40] receive there then I'll receive and open
[1:12:42] myself up to praise God
[1:12:45] amen thank you Jesus Hallelujah in the
[1:12:47] name of Jesus
[1:12:49] thank God
[1:12:51] now verse 4 says he chose us in Christ
[1:12:53] we looked at that recently
[1:12:55] in in Christ before the foundation of
[1:12:58] the world
[1:12:59] and then verse 5 we're predestinated to
[1:13:01] be adopted as his children
[1:13:06] now we all know the adoption process
[1:13:08] right uh
[1:13:09] the family's got to go to court it's a
[1:13:11] big deal
[1:13:12] I've had a couple of kids in my class
[1:13:14] over the years being adopted and they go
[1:13:15] to court they take a picture and it's
[1:13:17] the happiest day of the child's life
[1:13:20] because before his previous family
[1:13:22] abandoned him but now the previous
[1:13:24] family said I don't want you I don't
[1:13:27] want you I can't take care of you but
[1:13:29] then the new family says I want you I'll
[1:13:31] take care of you I'll provide for you
[1:13:34] I'll be a mother I'll be a father oh
[1:13:37] that's what God did to us amen
[1:13:38] hallelujah the world made us orphans the
[1:13:41] world rejected us the world left us for
[1:13:43] dead religion left us half dead
[1:13:45] Hallelujah but Jesus Christ comes and he
[1:13:47] adopts us into his family praise God he
[1:13:50] said I care about you I'm bringing you
[1:13:52] in you get all the benefits of being in
[1:13:54] my family let's take a picture you got a
[1:13:56] certificate you're adopted and here's my
[1:13:59] certificate praise God I'm in the family
[1:14:01] of Christ I'm adopted I got a new daddy
[1:14:04] and mommy praise God there's my
[1:14:06] certificate let's take a picture Jesus
[1:14:09] thank you Lord
[1:14:11] I'm in your family now
[1:14:13] hallelujah thank God Amen I'm not an
[1:14:16] orphan I'm not alone I got someone that
[1:14:19] will watch over me praise God
[1:14:22] in church he has done that very thing
[1:14:25] praise God
[1:14:26] watched over me protected me guided me
[1:14:28] strengthened me
[1:14:30] helped me praise God
[1:14:34] that's what he did he predestinated me
[1:14:36] to be adopted
[1:14:38] in other words he knew the whole time
[1:14:39] there was never not there was never a
[1:14:42] time when when God didn't know I wonder
[1:14:44] if I'll adopt sister so and so I wonder
[1:14:46] I wonder if I'll bring brothers so and
[1:14:48] so to my family no the whole time it was
[1:14:50] all determined
[1:14:52] he knew the plan he knew the day he knew
[1:14:55] the hour he knew the church service
[1:14:57] praise God he know this he knew the
[1:14:59] sermon you needed to hear or the song
[1:15:01] that you need to hear praise God he knew
[1:15:03] exactly what you needed it was already
[1:15:04] determined amen
[1:15:06] Hallelujah
[1:15:10] you're adopted
[1:15:12] as children of God by Jesus Christ to
[1:15:14] himself
[1:15:16] Hallelujah he chose me to be in his
[1:15:19] family
[1:15:20] Hallelujah in one way I chose him
[1:15:22] another way he chose me that's right
[1:15:26] now look at verse six now here's Albert
[1:15:28] Barnes goes to verse six Ephesians 1 6.
[1:15:31] thank you
[1:15:32] to show that we are highly favored now I
[1:15:35] just all those other verses would have
[1:15:36] applied to
[1:15:37] to the praise of the glory of his grace
[1:15:40] wherein he hath made us accepted in the
[1:15:44] Beloved
[1:15:45] beloved means the heart of God in other
[1:15:48] words the Throne of God we are accepted
[1:15:50] in Heaven's Tabernacle today amen we're
[1:15:54] accepted at the throne we're not
[1:15:55] rejected
[1:15:57] God's not turning down our prayers
[1:15:59] because he doesn't like us or we're
[1:16:00] heathens or workers of iniquity we're
[1:16:02] workers of righteousness and we are
[1:16:04] already accepted in the Beloved praise
[1:16:06] God
[1:16:07] already
[1:16:10] so please let's remember we are highly
[1:16:13] favored maybe not in the way Mary was
[1:16:15] but that's okay
[1:16:16] God God's choice is best
[1:16:19] right and I said man I'm glad God didn't
[1:16:21] choose me for that it would be
[1:16:23] impossible right
[1:16:25] but God did choose you for something
[1:16:27] praise God
[1:16:29] Hallelujah and you are highly favored
[1:16:34] now I just wrote this down you know just
[1:16:35] as a reminder you know Mary was highly
[1:16:38] favored
[1:16:40] and uh
[1:16:42] and she is she was chosen for this
[1:16:45] purpose
[1:16:46] and somebody say well she's more highly
[1:16:48] favored than maybe Rebecca or or Ruth
[1:16:52] or someone like that but remember church
[1:16:54] when heaven was searched in Revelation
[1:16:57] chapter 5 When Heaven Was searched for
[1:16:59] somebody worthy the Bible said no man
[1:17:03] can be found
[1:17:05] they searched all Heaven All Earth they
[1:17:08] even searched the Angels there's no
[1:17:09] angel that was Worthy
[1:17:11] no one was worthy to take the promises
[1:17:13] of God the book of redemption no one was
[1:17:16] worthy to take that and open it
[1:17:18] other than Jesus Christ praise God
[1:17:22] so all any honor we give to somebody and
[1:17:24] any any blessing they have in their
[1:17:26] testimony it's wonderful we thank God
[1:17:28] for that but it's so small in comparison
[1:17:30] to the honor of Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[1:17:33] because this is what
[1:17:36] crisis it's different than just honoring
[1:17:38] and thanking God you know for for each
[1:17:40] one of our lives and our testimonies
[1:17:41] it's wonderful we ought to do that more
[1:17:44] but there's an honor that's reserved
[1:17:46] there's a worship that's reserved for
[1:17:48] only Jesus Christ Hallelujah and all
[1:17:50] heaven will recognize only Christ gets
[1:17:52] the worship praise God
[1:17:55] so it's a great balance praise God
[1:17:58] and remember we know the scripture all
[1:18:00] 24 Elders not one of them kept their
[1:18:03] Crown when Jesus come out and did that
[1:18:05] not one of them said you know what I'm
[1:18:07] not going to cast my credit I think I'm
[1:18:09] going to keep my crown on
[1:18:11] not one of them
[1:18:13] all 24 not one of them stood up and said
[1:18:16] we really appreciate the Lord
[1:18:19] no
[1:18:20] no each one of them bowed down in
[1:18:22] worship and said we are not worthy I got
[1:18:25] this Crown because you you fought like
[1:18:27] Malachi sang last week I'm fighting a
[1:18:29] battle Christ's already won for me
[1:18:31] praise God he gave me the grace overcome
[1:18:34] he protected me he's the one that gave
[1:18:36] me favor each one of those Godly men
[1:18:38] with all those rewards and all that
[1:18:40] honor realized they only got the honor
[1:18:42] because of God's grace Hallelujah
[1:18:45] not one of them kept their crown and say
[1:18:46] well I
[1:18:47] you know I'm a pretty good guy now
[1:18:50] I think I thank God for Jesus but I'm a
[1:18:52] pretty good guy no they all realize I'm
[1:18:55] nothing without Christ for without
[1:18:56] Christ you can do nothing Hallelujah
[1:18:59] that's right
[1:19:02] and then you know then the other side of
[1:19:03] that is in Revelation Jesus says you'll
[1:19:06] walk with me in white because you are
[1:19:07] worthy
[1:19:09] there's none worthy to be worshiped like
[1:19:11] Jesus but then we can walk a life worthy
[1:19:14] of the Gospel
[1:19:15] we can obey Hallelujah
[1:19:18] like like I read that quote a few weeks
[1:19:20] ago by the man said try just try your
[1:19:22] best praise God
[1:19:24] sees that we're trying our best and God
[1:19:27] God is pleased with that praise God he's
[1:19:30] not expecting Perfection but he's
[1:19:32] expecting he's expecting us to lovingly
[1:19:34] sacrifice right to make our bodies a
[1:19:37] Living Sacrifice unto God
[1:19:40] thank God Hallelujah
[1:19:43] actually I turn on my flashlight there
[1:19:48] part now here's what I want to I just
[1:19:49] want to uh read this or what Albert
[1:19:51] Barnes said here
[1:19:54] he says but now the happy individual was
[1:19:56] designated who was to be his mother Mary
[1:19:58] and on Mary look Church a poor version
[1:20:02] of Nazareth was to come this honor which
[1:20:05] would have rendered infinitely
[1:20:07] illustrious any of the daughters of Adam
[1:20:09] the honor of giving birth to the world's
[1:20:12] Redeemer and the son of God
[1:20:16] this this is a beautiful thought who did
[1:20:19] God choose a poor
[1:20:21] teenage woman from Nazareth
[1:20:27] it'd be like
[1:20:29] it'd be like a poor person from the
[1:20:31] slums of Akron
[1:20:33] can any good thing come out of the inner
[1:20:35] city of act well LeBron James did but
[1:20:36] you don't do much good for God right
[1:20:39] he's on the left side he's the woke side
[1:20:40] you know
[1:20:42] can anything good come out of the slums
[1:20:44] here
[1:20:46] and yet God when he's looking for
[1:20:48] someone who who can I highly favor
[1:20:50] he goes to the least expected place he
[1:20:53] doesn't go to the castle the king
[1:20:57] he doesn't go you know to the the
[1:20:59] wealthy he goes to the poor
[1:21:02] when God wants to honor a woman he goes
[1:21:05] to the humble women praise God
[1:21:08] you don't go to the celebrities of this
[1:21:10] world
[1:21:11] you don't go to celebrities praise God
[1:21:13] he goes to the low this world and makes
[1:21:15] him a celebrity in heaven hallelujah
[1:21:18] thank God
[1:21:20] I love this praise God
[1:21:24] he goes to the lowest Town Nazareth and
[1:21:28] he goes to the lowest income class the
[1:21:30] poor
[1:21:32] to find I want and when God finds
[1:21:34] somebody he wants to honor he goes to
[1:21:36] the meekest of the meek
[1:21:38] so church we ought to be encouraged
[1:21:39] praise God
[1:21:41] no matter what our history is no matter
[1:21:44] what our current life is like
[1:21:46] let's be like Mary like the Bible said
[1:21:48] let's Ponder the word of God in our
[1:21:50] hearts let's keep these promises in our
[1:21:53] hearts and talk about them all the time
[1:21:55] praise God
[1:21:57] because God is writing down who's doing
[1:21:59] that and then God will hearken to their
[1:22:01] prayers
[1:22:02] at the right time and season
[1:22:04] like God I'll just dramatize it 18 years
[1:22:07] ago up in Indiana an Amish man came out
[1:22:09] of the Honors Community and got baptized
[1:22:11] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and
[1:22:14] for 18 years he said Lord
[1:22:16] he said please save an Amish church and
[1:22:20] may they all get baptized in the name of
[1:22:22] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:22:24] so for all those 18 years God was
[1:22:26] looking for a church to do that in right
[1:22:29] oh my that's just powerful praise God
[1:22:32] 18 years
[1:22:34] he kept asking God and you all got to
[1:22:36] see it last week was that a good
[1:22:37] surprise or what
[1:22:39] do you like when I surprise you like
[1:22:40] that
[1:22:41] I don't tell you guests are coming well
[1:22:42] there's a couple reasons I do that
[1:22:44] I don't want us to try to be more
[1:22:45] spiritual than we normally are right
[1:22:47] even myself included
[1:22:50] and then also I don't know if they're
[1:22:51] coming you know sometimes people cancel
[1:22:52] so I don't want to announce something
[1:22:54] and they don't come
[1:22:56] but here this man for 18 years he just
[1:22:58] kept praying God I know you can do it
[1:23:00] not I'm just dramatizing
[1:23:02] oh and maybe over the over the years 18
[1:23:05] years there's a couple of
[1:23:06] disappointments like it looked like this
[1:23:07] church was really going to receive it
[1:23:09] but then they didn't
[1:23:10] look like
[1:23:12] finally a church
[1:23:15] my goodness but then finally when the
[1:23:18] right time comes brother random says the
[1:23:20] promises of God circle the Earth and
[1:23:22] they're waiting for people to get in
[1:23:23] their position and when they get in
[1:23:25] their position the timing's right that
[1:23:27] promise comes down and anoints the
[1:23:29] individual and that person gets inspired
[1:23:31] and they do the will of God and God
[1:23:33] fulfills his promise Hallelujah
[1:23:36] said that promise for 800 years Circle
[1:23:38] diversion shall conceived and think of
[1:23:40] all the turns of the sun think of all
[1:23:42] the seasons winter
[1:23:44] spring summer fall all the all the
[1:23:47] seasons they went through till finally
[1:23:49] there's somebody that's meditating on
[1:23:51] the word finally is the right time this
[1:23:53] the right person a poor little person an
[1:23:56] insignificant person out of an
[1:23:58] insignificant Town God said that's a
[1:24:00] kind I'm going to use because it shows
[1:24:01] the character of God he takes the meek
[1:24:04] and makes them strong praise God
[1:24:05] hallelujah he takes the humble praise
[1:24:07] God and gives them honor Hallelujah
[1:24:10] he honors the poor
[1:24:13] virgin daughter Mary of this awful town
[1:24:20] he finally finds somebody that's obeying
[1:24:22] his word praise God he bites now God
[1:24:24] bypassed all those 800 years of
[1:24:27] young Israeli women
[1:24:30] to find Mary
[1:24:31] now the Bible proves they're poor Luke 2
[1:24:33] 24. now Joseph Pride was a pretty good
[1:24:35] Carpenter
[1:24:37] but he wasn't a rich man
[1:24:39] he was no rich man
[1:24:41] and maybe with carpentry it's hard to
[1:24:43] get rich maybe it's easier to get rich
[1:24:45] in those days with you know bullocks
[1:24:47] goats sheep right like Abraham and Isaac
[1:24:51] Jacob Luke 2 24 and this is when the
[1:24:54] Bible says Mary and Joseph brought Jesus
[1:24:57] on the eighth day to be circumcised and
[1:24:58] give them the name Jesus and to offer a
[1:25:01] sacrifice according to that which is
[1:25:02] said in the law of the Lord a pair of
[1:25:04] turtle doves or two young pigeons
[1:25:06] now Albert Barnes says those who are
[1:25:08] able on such an occasion were required
[1:25:10] to offer a lamb for a burnt offering
[1:25:12] and a pigeon or turtle dove for a sin
[1:25:14] offering if not able to bring a lamb
[1:25:16] they were permitted to bring two turtle
[1:25:18] doves or two
[1:25:20] uh young pigeons that's in Leviticus 12
[1:25:22] 6 and Leviticus 12 8.
[1:25:27] so did Mary Joseph bring a lamb and a
[1:25:29] turtle dove no they just brought two
[1:25:31] birds so they were the poorest they were
[1:25:33] on the level the poorest
[1:25:37] and let me ask you Church even though
[1:25:38] they were poor was God still interested
[1:25:40] in them
[1:25:43] even though they were there even though
[1:25:44] they were poor man even though they were
[1:25:46] poor did God still highly favor Mary or
[1:25:49] not
[1:25:52] you see no matter what struggles we have
[1:25:53] in our lives we have to remember the
[1:25:55] spiritual favor of God is way more
[1:25:57] valuable amen than the natural favor of
[1:26:00] man
[1:26:01] or the devil right because the devil
[1:26:02] offered Jesus I'll give you all these
[1:26:04] kingdoms I'll give you all this I'll
[1:26:05] give you and we know all the musicians
[1:26:06] that have sold their souls to Satan for
[1:26:08] riches and popularity like Bob Dylan who
[1:26:11] admitted it on the Live 60 Minutes
[1:26:13] interview he said he sold his soul for
[1:26:15] Satan so he could be a be rich and
[1:26:17] famous
[1:26:20] and that's just natural I'd rather have
[1:26:23] the favor of God
[1:26:25] in a small Church of 15 people then a
[1:26:28] million subscribers or 50 million
[1:26:30] subscribers on iTunes or Instagram or
[1:26:33] whatever you got I'd rather take the way
[1:26:35] with the Lord to spies for you and have
[1:26:37] spiritual favor with God even if I just
[1:26:39] got one blessing from God I'd rather
[1:26:41] have one blessing of God than a million
[1:26:43] blessings from the Devil
[1:26:45] that's right Hallelujah
[1:26:47] amen
[1:26:50] thank God
[1:26:54] and notice she comes in a state of
[1:26:56] poverty bringing Jesus to be circumcised
[1:27:00] and God has shown that it is not
[1:27:02] dishonorable to be poor
[1:27:05] it's not a dishonor to be poor
[1:27:08] if that's the case then Mary was a
[1:27:09] dishonor to God
[1:27:11] she was no dishonor to God she was an
[1:27:13] honor to God
[1:27:16] no station in life is dishonorable where
[1:27:19] God places us
[1:27:20] he knows what is best for us and he
[1:27:23] often makes a state of poverty an
[1:27:25] occasion of the highest blessings
[1:27:28] I'm quoting Barnes now if with poverty
[1:27:32] he grants us as is often the case peace
[1:27:35] contentment and religion is worth far
[1:27:37] more than all the jewels
[1:27:40] or all the gold of Mexico in this case
[1:27:41] I'll say the goal to Fort Knox okay or
[1:27:44] the gold of the Vatican how about that
[1:27:47] if it be asked why since the Savior was
[1:27:50] pure from any moral defilement in his
[1:27:52] conception of birth it was necessary to
[1:27:54] offer such a sacrifice Okay the reason
[1:27:57] of sacrifice had to be offered is
[1:27:58] because the Bible said it becometh us to
[1:28:00] fulfill all righteousness
[1:28:03] so why did Jesus need to sacrifice him
[1:28:04] he's a holy baby well because they got
[1:28:07] to fulfill the word of God
[1:28:08] in other words Mary had to go to church
[1:28:10] just like everybody else had to go to
[1:28:11] church
[1:28:12] can I say like this Mary had to pay her
[1:28:14] ties and offerings just like everybody
[1:28:15] had to pay toxin offers right
[1:28:19] right God wants to see if we'll humble
[1:28:20] ourselves and obey God in the little
[1:28:22] things and then God can bless us in
[1:28:24] Greater spiritual things
[1:28:28] that's right
[1:28:35] now let me move on to this next thought
[1:28:37] here by God's grace
[1:28:40] I always feel a little pressure on
[1:28:42] Mother's Day like I wanna I was praying
[1:28:43] this morning like Lord that every sister
[1:28:45] feel encouraged when she leaves this
[1:28:47] place and don't forget the brothers too
[1:28:48] I don't want them to feel
[1:28:50] just a certain pressure I don't know
[1:28:52] we've had some good Mother's Day
[1:28:53] Services over the years you know I
[1:28:55] remember some of them like Leah loves
[1:28:56] the Lord and
[1:28:58] some other ones in there
[1:29:01] but I just want the Holy Spirit to bless
[1:29:02] each person praise God
[1:29:04] Luke 2 34. now the next chapter Luke 2
[1:29:06] 34 and Simeon blessed them and said unto
[1:29:09] Mary's mother behold this child is set
[1:29:11] for the fall and Rising again of many in
[1:29:14] Israel and for a sign which shall be
[1:29:17] spoken against
[1:29:19] now look Jesus was was was came for for
[1:29:22] the rise of the Apostles
[1:29:25] rise in what in finances no
[1:29:28] how about popularity did they get more
[1:29:30] popular
[1:29:31] because they were Apostles no they
[1:29:33] actually got more hated
[1:29:36] this rise mean this rise has to mean in
[1:29:38] the blessings of God
[1:29:40] Hallelujah
[1:29:42] Jesus is set for the rising of many but
[1:29:45] also the falling of many
[1:29:48] in other words Jesus everyone's reaction
[1:29:50] to Jesus would either help them rise in
[1:29:52] God or fall in God
[1:29:55] think about that Judas Rose for a while
[1:29:58] but then he fell
[1:29:59] at the towards the end of his life of
[1:30:01] course he had the thief's heart this
[1:30:02] whole time we're told in the Book of
[1:30:04] John chapter 12.
[1:30:06] but Jesus came and when he was when when
[1:30:07] I'm sorry Jesus came and went when Judas
[1:30:10] was sincere he was rising in God he had
[1:30:12] power he had Authority he cast out
[1:30:14] devils
[1:30:17] but pretty soon Jesus also revealed what
[1:30:20] was in his heart and because of Jesus he
[1:30:23] because Jesus truth and everything he
[1:30:24] and and Jesus was talking about honesty
[1:30:26] and not stealing
[1:30:28] it revealed his fall and he loved the
[1:30:31] world and so he fell
[1:30:33] right
[1:30:36] Jesus either makes you rise or fall
[1:30:39] Hallelujah
[1:30:41] thank God Church you ought to be so
[1:30:42] happy today we ought to be so thankful
[1:30:45] today that I see Christ helping me rise
[1:30:49] my life's not going down in in curses my
[1:30:53] life is rising in God's mercy and
[1:30:55] blessings praise God
[1:30:57] Hallelujah I was already low in sin and
[1:31:00] shame I was already addicted to sins and
[1:31:02] I already had a life that was falling
[1:31:04] away from God hallelujah but when the
[1:31:07] real Christ when the real message came
[1:31:09] to me church I see nothing but rising in
[1:31:12] Christ amen we're Rising with with more
[1:31:14] Authority with more wisdom and more
[1:31:16] understanding God is here Christ is here
[1:31:19] to help us rise today Hallelujah let me
[1:31:22] say like this may God help you to rise
[1:31:24] to the occasion to overcome the
[1:31:26] Temptation you're battling right now
[1:31:28] that's what he come for to help you rise
[1:31:30] Hallelujah
[1:31:33] shade but to rise in Victory and
[1:31:36] repentance and overcoming Grace he wants
[1:31:39] you to rise up out of your place
[1:31:40] Hallelujah
[1:31:41] amen that's why he came Hallelujah
[1:31:44] to help us rise
[1:31:47] and the church said
[1:31:51] that's what the that's what the prophet
[1:31:52] Simeon said he's a minor Prophet right
[1:31:55] because the Lord spoke to him and said
[1:31:56] hey I got a revelation for you you're
[1:31:59] going to see my you're going to see my
[1:32:01] Messiah before you die
[1:32:02] I hope that's true for us praise God I
[1:32:05] mean the Rapture amen hallelujah praise
[1:32:08] God
[1:32:09] I hope we see Christ before we die
[1:32:13] I just found that quote brother man said
[1:32:14] it in the I can't remember the I think
[1:32:16] it was in this questions and answers but
[1:32:18] Rob said Jesus may not come for a
[1:32:20] hundred years and look we're getting
[1:32:21] pretty close to that
[1:32:24] he said that 1963. here we are
[1:32:27] 2023
[1:32:29] we're already past the halfway point in
[1:32:30] the hundred years
[1:32:32] halfway point
[1:32:34] if time keeps going fast like it is now
[1:32:35] we're going to be there pretty soon
[1:32:38] so let's be ready praise God no man
[1:32:40] knows the day or the hour praise God
[1:32:41] let's be faithful to God hallelujah
[1:32:43] let's trust God let's see God with all
[1:32:46] that we have praise God let's trust in
[1:32:48] the Lord and help us rise above our
[1:32:49] trials Hallelujah
[1:32:52] amen
[1:32:54] reminds me that Chris Tomlin song out of
[1:32:56] the Ash's room we rise you know
[1:32:58] there's no one like you our God is
[1:32:59] greater our God is stronger amen
[1:33:02] he helps us rise
[1:33:05] out of our destitute condition
[1:33:07] spiritually
[1:33:14] now this is what he tells his mom
[1:33:16] because of your son which was really
[1:33:18] God's son not really her son
[1:33:22] many are people are going to rise some
[1:33:24] will rise and some will fall
[1:33:26] and people are going to speak against
[1:33:28] your son now look at that isn't it just
[1:33:30] gracious of the Holy Ghost to let you
[1:33:31] know you got some trials coming ahead
[1:33:35] people are going to speak against you
[1:33:38] verse 35. and now look at this no we we
[1:33:41] all let me say this right away we all
[1:33:44] honor Mary and think wow what if I could
[1:33:46] have been that or what if what an honor
[1:33:48] but let's not forget this the suffering
[1:33:50] she went through
[1:33:54] yay
[1:33:56] so so many people are going to rise
[1:33:58] because of this boy but also you're
[1:33:59] going to get spoken against and a sword
[1:34:02] a sword
[1:34:04] shall pierce through thine own soul also
[1:34:09] what this isn't a natural sword
[1:34:14] this is a spiritual sword
[1:34:17] in other words God who's going to test
[1:34:19] this means she's going to be tested the
[1:34:21] very heart the very core of her being is
[1:34:23] going to be tested and this is the
[1:34:25] mother we're preaching about for
[1:34:25] Mother's Day this
[1:34:28] now which one of our mothers won a sword
[1:34:30] thrust through their heart
[1:34:33] all right none of our money
[1:34:36] but this was what she was called for we
[1:34:38] all remember all the honor oh she's the
[1:34:40] she's the Virgin that conceived we
[1:34:41] that's that's a lot of Honor for that
[1:34:43] but here comes suffering that goes along
[1:34:44] with that honor
[1:34:47] praise God
[1:34:50] a sword through your heart
[1:34:53] through
[1:34:54] not into
[1:34:56] Rue
[1:34:59] aren't those the most powerful attacks
[1:35:00] right when something will actually go
[1:35:02] through your body
[1:35:04] when those wouldn't those be the most
[1:35:06] painful
[1:35:08] so you're blessed you're highly favored
[1:35:10] but you got a sword coming through
[1:35:12] your soul
[1:35:15] in other words you will be tested to the
[1:35:17] Limit
[1:35:19] you'll be tested beyond measure
[1:35:23] right and every every Jewish woman would
[1:35:25] have said oh I want to be the Virgin
[1:35:26] that would conceive I want to bring
[1:35:27] forth the Redeemer I want to bring forth
[1:35:29] all
[1:35:30] all Mankind's Redeemer but you want to
[1:35:33] suffer like Mary's going to suffer
[1:35:37] thoughts of many hearts may be revealed
[1:35:41] now I have all the quotes there I'm not
[1:35:42] going to read them all but brother man
[1:35:43] said everywhere Mary went she was spoken
[1:35:46] against
[1:35:47] she was called an illegitimate mother
[1:35:49] because they all thought she had
[1:35:50] fornication with the man
[1:35:54] so she had this she had these great
[1:35:55] spiritual experiences with angels with
[1:35:58] uh Simeon the prophet but then
[1:35:59] everywhere she went publicly her life
[1:36:01] was a Public Disgrace
[1:36:03] everybody looked down on her
[1:36:06] so she was poor everybody looked down on
[1:36:08] her but God said you're highly favored
[1:36:11] so what do they come down to church it
[1:36:13] depends on who you're going to believe
[1:36:16] whose side are you standing on praise
[1:36:17] God
[1:36:18] like that song says whose report will
[1:36:20] you receive
[1:36:22] we shall receive the report of the Lord
[1:36:26] see we think it's all bed and Roses a
[1:36:28] bed of roses for Mary like it was some
[1:36:30] easy life it was a difficult challenging
[1:36:32] life she saw many rise like Peter
[1:36:34] hallelujah amen like James and John
[1:36:37] Hallelujah sons of zebony praise God but
[1:36:39] she saw many people fall as well
[1:36:43] and then she herself suffered
[1:36:47] this sword piercing through her soul
[1:36:50] now I'm not certain church but I imagine
[1:36:52] that that sword
[1:36:55] was the test at the cross
[1:36:58] I don't know
[1:37:00] but what what other
[1:37:02] what other experience could be so
[1:37:05] difficult
[1:37:09] that it would be compared to a sword
[1:37:11] piercing through your own soul
[1:37:13] how about your child
[1:37:15] being crucified
[1:37:17] and to know that the child was innocent
[1:37:20] healed the sick raised the dead healed
[1:37:22] lepers
[1:37:25] and and she doesn't she's not hid from
[1:37:27] that she has a front row seat in that
[1:37:30] what could be harder than that
[1:37:35] and this is the woman who's highly
[1:37:37] favored of the Lord
[1:37:41] praise God
[1:37:44] is it sinking in deep today praise God
[1:37:48] the sink in let that word become a part
[1:37:50] of me let me be able to accept the
[1:37:52] trials that I go through and help me to
[1:37:54] remember that I'm highly favored despite
[1:37:56] all the trials
[1:37:59] helped me to accept that
[1:38:02] Church there are so many times and
[1:38:04] you've seen it you've seen me you'll
[1:38:05] just see me cry many times I'll just cry
[1:38:07] at the end of a service sometimes church
[1:38:09] I'm just crying because I think about
[1:38:11] what Jesus went through
[1:38:13] on the cross sometimes I just cry
[1:38:15] because of that
[1:38:17] I think he suffered all that
[1:38:21] he was taking my shape
[1:38:24] he was taking the punishment that I
[1:38:26] deserved
[1:38:30] right
[1:38:32] all the pain of the cross
[1:38:34] even beforehand in the in the in the
[1:38:37] trials he was slapped and mocked and his
[1:38:39] beard ripped out Psalm says that the
[1:38:40] gospel doesn't say that Psalm says his
[1:38:42] beard was ripped out
[1:38:45] sometimes I just think about the cross
[1:38:47] and I'll just cry
[1:38:49] in in my in my hardest trials you know
[1:38:52] in my most difficult trials where the
[1:38:54] lord always brings me back is to the
[1:38:55] Cross of Christ
[1:38:58] I got to remember despite my faults or
[1:39:00] my failures or my trials Jesus suffered
[1:39:03] more than I could ever imagine
[1:39:05] he suffered far beyond me he was beaten
[1:39:08] to a man a man could even call him a man
[1:39:13] and the Bible says Mary watch this and
[1:39:16] it was like a sword was struck right
[1:39:18] through her soul
[1:39:19] wounded just endure this wound imagine
[1:39:22] all the movies we've seen right I'm
[1:39:24] sword fighting and people getting
[1:39:26] stabbed
[1:39:28] and it's this is what her experience was
[1:39:30] yet she's highly favored you see all
[1:39:33] those preachers say you're highly
[1:39:34] favored you're all blessed that's true
[1:39:36] that's so true that's so true but
[1:39:40] there are sufferings that go with it
[1:39:48] I thank the Lord for the cross praise
[1:39:49] God
[1:39:51] he's made us to rise
[1:39:54] and church the beautiful part is
[1:39:57] Jesus his word has come to you and it's
[1:40:00] revealed what's in your heart
[1:40:05] now for all of us the majority of us
[1:40:07] it's revealed good things
[1:40:10] right
[1:40:11] but each one of us can say well there's
[1:40:13] still places where the word has revealed
[1:40:15] I'm not being obedient in
[1:40:18] including brother Jesse
[1:40:20] all of us
[1:40:22] the word always reveals what's in our
[1:40:25] heart always
[1:40:27] never fails to amaze me all the times I
[1:40:29] preach it it'll impact somebody's heart
[1:40:30] and I appreciate everybody letting me
[1:40:31] know when I got another one the other
[1:40:33] day how the service was just what the
[1:40:35] person needed to hear I thought well God
[1:40:37] is so good that's the word
[1:40:40] he's revealing the thoughts and intents
[1:40:43] of our heart
[1:40:45] Hallelujah
[1:40:47] and so that's what Christ does he comes
[1:40:50] to show us now church for the for all of
[1:40:53] us we've risen to some degree but we've
[1:40:55] got to be able to rise higher as well
[1:40:58] Hallelujah
[1:41:02] I got that in there brother amen I said
[1:41:03] you are standing with him today you're
[1:41:05] standing on his side and that's what the
[1:41:06] song he's saying I like little things
[1:41:08] like that Hallelujah so Mary was going
[1:41:11] to suffer at the cross her soul would
[1:41:14] feel like it was cut and Pierce and and
[1:41:17] just broken through my soul is broken
[1:41:20] is what she would say yet she's highly
[1:41:22] favored in heaven
[1:41:23] yet she's blessed with extra Grace above
[1:41:26] marriage I tell you she was blessed
[1:41:27] above measure of amen hallelujah and the
[1:41:30] greatest blessing was is that the the
[1:41:32] next morning after she come early before
[1:41:34] the dawn I'm sorry two days later praise
[1:41:36] God that was the greatest blessing
[1:41:38] praise God even though the word was
[1:41:40] crucified even though she felt like she
[1:41:42] was pierced through she still came to
[1:41:44] give honor to the Son of God hallelujah
[1:41:47] not just because it was her son because
[1:41:48] the angel said he's the savior of the
[1:41:50] world Amen
[1:41:52] and she said I rejoice in God my savior
[1:41:55] praise God in other words she needed a
[1:41:57] savior she needed forgiveness and she
[1:41:59] came to honor the the Christ who had
[1:42:01] died she came to honor them honor him
[1:42:04] praise God but then God did a great
[1:42:06] thing God raised him from the dead
[1:42:08] forevermore once and die but forever
[1:42:10] he'll live Hallelujah
[1:42:12] oh my and God had that great blessing in
[1:42:16] that trial
[1:42:17] Hallelujah so she felt cut all the way
[1:42:20] through
[1:42:24] God bless her with the resurrection of
[1:42:27] her son praise God
[1:42:31] oh it's so beautiful
[1:42:33] how many can take courage from a
[1:42:34] testimony like that praise God I can
[1:42:37] certainly
[1:42:39] you don't come from the greatest place
[1:42:41] you don't come from the best family
[1:42:43] you don't come from the richest family
[1:42:46] God still has a calling for you praise
[1:42:48] God
[1:42:49] he still has a purpose for you
[1:42:51] he's given you great favor
[1:42:53] Hallelujah
[1:42:55] what's more favor to be able to call the
[1:42:57] president say Mr President can you do
[1:42:59] this or that or say dear Lord Jesus
[1:43:02] could you please minister to this need
[1:43:04] which is a greater blessing
[1:43:06] of course it's the praise of the Lord
[1:43:10] he's the closest friend we've ever had
[1:43:12] right the closest he's the best friend
[1:43:14] that will ever have he's the Lord Jesus
[1:43:17] Hallelujah
[1:43:18] am I wearing you out church I mean am I
[1:43:20] wearing everybody out tonight
[1:43:21] or I'm sorry this morning sorry
[1:43:26] let's take courage from testimonies like
[1:43:28] Mary
[1:43:30] let's take courage from testimonies like
[1:43:32] Jacobin she just trusts in the god
[1:43:35] she she overcame the fear that the
[1:43:37] government put on her like the
[1:43:39] government's going to kill my child she
[1:43:41] overcame that fear and put it in God's
[1:43:43] hands
[1:43:45] Hallelujah that's what the Bible said
[1:43:48] God honored her because she had trust in
[1:43:50] God
[1:43:52] like sister know we had a good testimony
[1:43:53] about trusting in God for uh Beatrice's
[1:43:56] expired passport maybe you'll share that
[1:43:58] after series or after service this year
[1:44:00] that's a good just trust God church we
[1:44:01] just got to trust God Amen
[1:44:04] how about Sarah I love this this
[1:44:06] testimony of Sarah
[1:44:08] both Abraham and Genesis 17 laughed at
[1:44:11] God
[1:44:14] God said Abraham I'm going to bless her
[1:44:16] and give thee a son also of her I'll
[1:44:18] bless her and she shall be the mother of
[1:44:19] Nations Kings of people shall be of her
[1:44:21] then Abraham he just didn't like
[1:44:24] laugh like that the Bible said he fell
[1:44:26] on his face and laughed and said shall
[1:44:28] shall be born unto him that's a hundred
[1:44:30] years old and shall Sarah that is 90
[1:44:33] years old bear
[1:44:34] can you imagine hearing a sermon and
[1:44:36] it's about you and you just fall down
[1:44:38] and laugh and say that could never
[1:44:39] happen how is that possible oh my
[1:44:42] goodness
[1:44:49] and he turned out to be the father of
[1:44:51] the faith
[1:44:53] see sometimes Church our weakness is
[1:44:55] there so God will bypass our weakness
[1:44:58] he'll expose our weakness to ourselves
[1:44:59] and then make us strong
[1:45:03] in other words he'll do the opposite of
[1:45:04] our weakness
[1:45:05] and make us strong in that area
[1:45:09] let's have confidence in God Amen trust
[1:45:12] God Amen he literally
[1:45:13] let your law on the ground
[1:45:15] happy
[1:45:17] oh I'm going to go in the Rapture like a
[1:45:19] little church like this and go

[1:45:25] tiny little church like this is going to
[1:45:26] go around right for sure we're going to
[1:45:28] get a body change
[1:45:29] [Laughter]
[1:45:32] the promise of God
[1:45:34] amen
[1:45:35] God Amen someone's going to believe it
[1:45:37] praise God
[1:45:38] Hallelujah
[1:45:40] is that always to the rich churches
[1:45:43] it's not always to the
[1:45:44] the fancy churches and so all those who
[1:45:47] believe it's all those who are
[1:45:49] predestinated to God's will Hallelujah
[1:45:52] and I might as well believe I'm just as
[1:45:54] it was pretty as anybody else
[1:45:57] I wasn't born the message but God called
[1:45:58] me into it praise God hallelujah I'm
[1:46:00] just just as much as Freedom as anybody
[1:46:04] right and you can play you can place
[1:46:06] yourself in there as well
[1:46:08] all of you have left left Temptations
[1:46:10] and left trials and left situations I'm
[1:46:12] going on an hour and a half huh it's a
[1:46:14] normal Sunday morning okay I just know I
[1:46:16] looked up at the clock hadn't looked at
[1:46:17] this whole time Hallelujah each one of
[1:46:20] us have situations that don't look very
[1:46:21] good but in each one God comes in our
[1:46:24] situation and he says my grace is
[1:46:26] sufficient for you Hallelujah
[1:46:29] Hallelujah my strength just like Abraham
[1:46:32] God's strength was made perfect in
[1:46:34] Abraham's weakness praise God oh and
[1:46:37] then Sarah laughed when God visited her
[1:46:39] in Genesis 18.
[1:46:41] she overhears God talking to Abraham
[1:46:45] and she laughed within herself and said
[1:46:47] after I am waxed old shall I have
[1:46:50] pleasure my Lord being old also
[1:46:53] how am I going to have magic
[1:46:57] God comes rebukes her
[1:47:01] she laughs at the promise of God
[1:47:04] church as a preacher I've had people
[1:47:06] literally laugh at my sermons
[1:47:09] how would that make you feel
[1:47:10] you study and pray all these days all
[1:47:12] these weeks hours and somebody laugh at
[1:47:14] your sermon like
[1:47:17] that's okay
[1:47:19] depends it depends who you're looking at
[1:47:20] for approval praise God I want to look
[1:47:22] at this for I don't look at my adoption
[1:47:24] certificate for approval yeah that's
[1:47:26] right I am adopted whoops I always do
[1:47:28] that
[1:47:30] thank God no the word of God fell out of
[1:47:31] here praise God
[1:47:34] I always want to remember that's right I
[1:47:35] was the Bible says I am a
[1:47:38] God of God I was predestinated to be
[1:47:40] adopted
[1:47:43] God already knew he was going to adopt
[1:47:46] me
[1:47:47] and I've got the certificate to prove it
[1:47:48] praise God
[1:47:50] I got the proof of the amen I got the
[1:47:52] scripture I can point somebody say look
[1:47:54] he predestinated me to this
[1:47:58] now some of us might not laugh at God's
[1:48:00] promise but how many get discouraged and
[1:48:01] complain about God's promise same thing
[1:48:03] same thing
[1:48:05] same thing
[1:48:07] well when is God going to show up when
[1:48:10] I'm already 90 years old when's God
[1:48:11] going to show up Sarah could have said
[1:48:13] if he had done it surely he would have
[1:48:15] done it earlier
[1:48:17] surely just like saying he said surely
[1:48:20] you'll not die surely
[1:48:22] God doesn't need us to interpret the
[1:48:24] word of God God just wants us to believe
[1:48:26] the word of God
[1:48:28] thank God
[1:48:31] the Lord said why did Sarah laugh
[1:48:33] wherefore did Sarah laugh saying shall I
[1:48:35] Surety bear a child when I'm old
[1:48:37] is there anything too hard for the Lord
[1:48:40] at the time appointed I'll return unto
[1:48:42] thee according to the time of life and
[1:48:44] Sarah shall have a son then Sarah
[1:48:46] tonight said I didn't laugh for she was
[1:48:48] afraid and she said nay but thou didst
[1:48:50] laugh
[1:48:51] laughed at God lied to God
[1:48:55] and then the beautiful part is once the
[1:48:57] baby comes in Genesis 21
[1:48:59] Sarah said God hath made me to laugh
[1:49:03] right right because I've had a son so
[1:49:07] that all that here will laugh with me
[1:49:09] but it's a different kind of a laugh
[1:49:12] Hallelujah the other life was
[1:49:13] disbelieved like oh God you must who how
[1:49:17] does he even know what he's talking

[1:50:16] God or God informed you in your mother's
[1:50:18] womb I just want to think once you think
[1:50:19] about that
[1:50:20] it wasn't your mom that formed you
[1:50:23] it was God that formed you
[1:50:26] Psalm 22 verse 9 but Thou Art he that
[1:50:28] took me out of the womb so not
[1:50:30] your even your mom might not deliver you
[1:50:33] the doctor might have not delivered you
[1:50:34] God delivered you out of the womb
[1:50:37] how many believe that
[1:50:40] and it's make me hope when I was upon my
[1:50:42] mother's breasts right
[1:50:46] I was cast upon thee from the womb Thou
[1:50:48] Art my God from my mother's belly here
[1:50:52] on Mother's Day let's go back to when we
[1:50:54] were little babies
[1:50:56] God made us hope right after we were
[1:50:58] born God's the one that allowed us to be
[1:51:00] born
[1:51:03] right Psalm 71 verse 4. deliver me oh my
[1:51:06] God out of the hand of the wicked out of
[1:51:08] the hand of the unrighteous and cruel
[1:51:10] man for thou art My Hope oh God now look
[1:51:12] he was he was hoping on his mother's uh
[1:51:15] chest and now he's hoping as a Man Too

[1:51:20] out of my mother's bowels my praise
[1:51:22] shall be continually of Thee
[1:51:26] I am as a Wonder unto many but Thou Art
[1:51:28] my strong Refuge
[1:51:32] to church you got to realize God is your
[1:51:34] hiding place
[1:51:35] this world is an awful place but God is
[1:51:38] our safety zone praise God
[1:51:40] just like God had you protecting your
[1:51:42] mother's womb the safest place for a
[1:51:44] baby is a mother's womb right
[1:51:46] that's the safest place and and so we're
[1:51:49] born we leave that safe place but Church
[1:51:51] the same God that was protecting us
[1:51:53] there is the same God that's protecting
[1:51:55] us now that we're out of the womb praise
[1:51:56] God
[1:51:57] Hallelujah
[1:52:01] so what do we got to do we got to praise
[1:52:03] him all the time he's my refuge
[1:52:05] verse eight let my mouth be filled with
[1:52:07] thy praise and with thy honor all the
[1:52:09] day cast me not off in the time of old
[1:52:11] age forsake me not when my strength
[1:52:13] failed anybody ever get tired
[1:52:15] he says don't he said don't cast me off
[1:52:17] when my strength fails for my enemies
[1:52:19] speak against me and they that lay wait
[1:52:21] for my soul take counsel together saying
[1:52:23] God hath forsaken him persecuted and
[1:52:25] take him for there is none deliver him
[1:52:27] oh God be not far from me oh my God make
[1:52:30] haste for my help now look the way to
[1:52:32] encourage yourself is remember God for
[1:52:35] me in my mother's womb God brought me
[1:52:37] out and God's still with me today praise
[1:52:39] God
[1:52:41] so many times David talks about this
[1:52:43] from my mother's womb
[1:52:46] in other words God was there before I
[1:52:49] even knew he was there amen come on he
[1:52:52] was there he's the one that formed me
[1:52:53] think about that you know if Sister C
[1:52:55] were here the Holy Ghost is forming the
[1:52:57] holy spirit is forming that baby right
[1:53:00] now the anointing of God
[1:53:02] is on her life forming that child right
[1:53:04] now doing July event told me
[1:53:06] the baby's doing July
[1:53:08] and God is the one for me and think
[1:53:11] about that God even does it in the
[1:53:12] sinner's lives too
[1:53:14] it's not the mom doing that
[1:53:18] it's God doing that
[1:53:20] Psalm 139 verse 1 to the chief musician
[1:53:22] a Psalm of David oh Lord thou has
[1:53:25] searched me and known to me
[1:53:28] oh Church the greatest thing
[1:53:31] is not that you know God but that God
[1:53:34] knows you
[1:53:36] let me prove that by the Bible Galatians
[1:53:38] 4 9 I'm sorry gonna have you jump over
[1:53:39] all
[1:53:41] but now after that year have known God
[1:53:43] or rather are known of God
[1:53:47] how turn you again to the weak and
[1:53:49] beggarly elements where unto you desire
[1:53:51] again to be in bondage what did Jesus
[1:53:53] tell the workers of iniquity I never
[1:53:55] knew you
[1:53:57] but what is he going to tell us he says
[1:53:59] he knows us because we're his church
[1:54:01] where his bride we Let Jesus wash us
[1:54:04] with the Waters of the word service
[1:54:06] after service year after year we kept
[1:54:08] coming back and Jesus kept washing us
[1:54:10] making us pure making us white making us
[1:54:13] rise in the faith Hallelujah
[1:54:16] helping us rise
[1:54:18] we all don't learn everything the first

[1:54:40] Temptations and trials
[1:54:42] that come into our lives

[1:54:45] knew you
[1:54:46] he predestinated you

[1:58:05] wonderfully made marvelous are thy works
[1:58:07] and that my soul knoweth right well my
[1:58:11] substance will not hit for me when I was
[1:58:12] made in secret and cursely wrought in
[1:58:14] the lower parts of the Earth
[1:58:18] I was reading there
[1:58:20] when I when a when an egg is fertilized
[1:58:23] over there's either 100 million to 250
[1:58:25] million
[1:58:27] germs there
[1:58:28] and each one has different attributes
[1:58:31] one might have curly hair I didn't get
[1:58:33] that one
[1:58:34] that wasn't me
[1:58:36] something's got black hair brown hair
[1:58:38] blonde hair red hair
[1:58:40] there's a hundred million different
[1:58:42] attributes of a person
[1:58:44] but there's only one that makes it
[1:58:48] you were the one that made it
[1:58:51] that these certain attributes about you
[1:58:53] that's the that's the one that God first
[1:58:56] saw he said I knew brother amen is going
[1:58:57] to make it right there this is what he's
[1:58:59] going to look like this is what he's
[1:59:00] going to be like
[1:59:01] of all these possibilities brother
[1:59:03] Randolph said the natural birth is more
[1:59:05] mysterious than the Virgin birth
[1:59:07] in the Virgin birth God just come down
[1:59:09] and create the egg and The Germ put him
[1:59:11] together there's Jesus
[1:59:13] but with you and I right the mom has all
[1:59:16] these eggs right now of course there's a
[1:59:17] certain type of ovulation but the man
[1:59:20] has all these germs and there's a
[1:59:22] hundred million and only one
[1:59:24] brings forth a fertilization that
[1:59:27] produces what you are today praise God
[1:59:30] oh in other words God knew exactly what
[1:59:32] I was going to be he formed me exactly
[1:59:34] the way he wanted to be I'm fearfully
[1:59:36] wonderfully made this knowledge brother
[1:59:38] Austin is too great for me I can't
[1:59:39] contain it but what I can do is praise
[1:59:42] God hallelujah
[1:59:43] amen praise God I can't contain it and
[1:59:46] then he's around me all the time he
[1:59:47] formed me in my mother's womb he kept me
[1:59:49] healthy and he's been watching me all my
[1:59:51] whole life just protecting me this whole
[1:59:53] time walking with me he sees me when I
[1:59:55] lie down he wakes me up Hallelujah
[1:59:57] sometimes at 4am when I don't want to
[1:59:58] get up but he wakes me up anyway praise
[2:00:00] God to study and pray and hear the word
[2:00:02] of God but I know he's with me praise
[2:00:04] God I've got his favor you and I are
[2:00:06] highly favored Hallelujah
[2:00:08] hey man
[2:00:14] verse 60. thine eyes that see my
[2:00:17] substance yet being unperfect
[2:00:19] and in thy book all my members were
[2:00:21] written which in continuance were
[2:00:23] fashioned when as yet there was none of
[2:00:25] them
[2:00:29] God had the whole book of your life all
[2:00:30] written out
[2:00:32] before you'd even come to this earth
[2:00:35] before there was even one of them God
[2:00:37] already had it figured out verse 17 how
[2:00:40] precious also are thy thoughts unto me
[2:00:43] oh God how great is the sum of them
[2:00:46] if I should count them they are more in
[2:00:48] number than the sand
[2:00:49] when I'm awake
[2:00:51] I am still with thee
[2:00:52] remember I showed you the sand of the
[2:00:54] sea remember I show you that
[2:00:54] illustration there's ten thousand grains
[2:00:57] of sand in one handful
[2:00:59] ten thousand
[2:01:01] and then David said all your thoughts
[2:01:03] about me are more than all the sand
[2:01:06] right that's hard to understand
[2:01:09] but do we believe that
[2:01:11] will that give us courage today when we
[2:01:13] go see our moms or we try to call our
[2:01:15] moms or whatever will that give us
[2:01:16] courage today
[2:01:17] God knew all about this day he set me up
[2:01:20] for my mother's womb for this day right
[2:01:22] every day every day but today
[2:01:25] he's with me
[2:01:27] he formed me he's with me he's going
[2:01:30] before me he's going he's behind me and
[2:01:32] His Hands All Over Me
[2:01:34] Hallelujah
[2:01:37] I want to read this here just briefly
[2:01:40] I'm gonna preach a little longer here
[2:01:42] but
[2:01:43] if you didn't notice somebody
[2:01:46] I wonder I've got this so oh yeah I
[2:01:48] heard sure just just take a moment just
[2:01:51] think about here's the first trimester
[2:01:53] of
[2:01:54] a fertilized egg and its development
[2:01:58] okay by week number yeah we
[2:02:00] fertilization fertilization happens in
[2:02:02] week three week four is implantation in
[2:02:05] week five the hormone levels increase
[2:02:09] in week six the neural tube closes for
[2:02:13] neurodevelopment
[2:02:16] first I'm sorry not verse seven in week
[2:02:18] seven the baby's head develops
[2:02:21] seventh week I think about that church
[2:02:23] throughout every week God is making sure
[2:02:25] that head develops the right way God
[2:02:27] made sure your head developed the right
[2:02:28] way
[2:02:29] he took that whole week he said I'm
[2:02:31] going to make sure Malachi's head looks
[2:02:32] just like his dad's
[2:02:34] because that's remember that's what his
[2:02:35] dad prayed for
[2:02:39] that's what the Bible says
[2:02:41] week eight the baby's nose form so he
[2:02:43] looked at my nose and he thought
[2:02:45] I want to make a nose just like Jesse's
[2:02:47] because
[2:02:51] there we go all right
[2:02:53] just the right nose
[2:02:55] God takes he said I'm going to take a
[2:02:56] whole week on that nose brother amen
[2:02:59] is that what the Bible says
[2:03:02] he for me he had all these things
[2:03:03] written in his book
[2:03:06] this is beautiful this is how much God
[2:03:08] loves me he took a whole week just on my
[2:03:09] nose
[2:03:11] apparently it took a week on just a week
[2:03:13] on creation itself right a natural week
[2:03:15] maybe
[2:03:17] Maybe
[2:03:19] right but he also took a whole week on
[2:03:21] your nose
[2:03:23] in week nine he worked on your toes
[2:03:27] I can see sister who is right there
[2:03:29] I saw my toes this morning
[2:03:32] brother Irvin saw my toes at foot
[2:03:34] washing last week
[2:03:36] and look I say look brother look God
[2:03:38] worked on these for a whole week look
[2:03:39] check these out here
[2:03:40] see this one
[2:03:42] is this this one's my favorite
[2:03:44] that big toe
[2:03:46] because without that I don't have any
[2:03:47] balance
[2:03:49] week nine is the baby's toes we uh 10 is
[2:03:52] the baby's elbows start bending
[2:03:55] oh see where I got that joint
[2:03:57] I'm gonna work a whole week a whole week
[2:03:59] on both of these joints
[2:04:01] I'm going to make sure they can bend
[2:04:05] you
[2:04:07] I'm with you
[2:04:10] week 11.
[2:04:11] reproductive parts develop he takes a
[2:04:13] whole week on reproductive parts
[2:04:16] week 12 and I think this is the end of
[2:04:18] the first trimester right
[2:04:21] party okay okay well Mayo Clinic stops
[2:04:23] at week 12.
[2:04:26] so I'm gonna trust my wife not Mayo
[2:04:27] Clinic
[2:04:28] or else I'll be in trouble no
[2:04:30] [Laughter]
[2:04:32] I'm just kidding we dropped week 12 God
[2:04:36] takes a whole week on your fingernails
[2:04:37] everybody look at your fingernails there
[2:04:39] a whole week he took on those
[2:04:42] I'm gonna form those and make them to
[2:04:44] grow
[2:04:45] I don't start eating them
[2:04:48] because I'm gonna take a whole week
[2:04:52] that's just the first trimester but
[2:04:54] there's three trimesters is that right
[2:04:58] how many believe the Bible is true
[2:05:01] now think think of all think of all the
[2:05:04] thoughts God had to have to make one
[2:05:05] fingernail let alone
[2:05:07] 10.
[2:05:11] and then the Bible says all these
[2:05:13] thoughts were so many is as it says the
[2:05:16] sand of the sea
[2:05:18] how many can say Amen to that I was
[2:05:20] thinking today praying I was like how
[2:05:21] did God actually form my nose like how
[2:05:22] did that how did that actually work
[2:05:25] how does he do that
[2:05:27] because I was thinking of the scripture
[2:05:31] and we can say I'm fearfully and
[2:05:33] wonderfully made
[2:05:37] let me close with this here
[2:05:40] there's many other verses that speak
[2:05:41] about the mother's womb
[2:05:43] John the Baptist had the anointing in
[2:05:45] his mind from the mother's womb
[2:05:48] look how God was given him special Grace
[2:05:51] amen I wish you would I wish I would
[2:05:53] have had it from the mother's womb but
[2:05:54] I'd come out lying and
[2:05:56] speaking evil things
[2:05:58] all kinds of bad things
[2:06:01] but that wasn't my testimony God had a
[2:06:03] special Testament but I thank God for
[2:06:04] that testimony
[2:06:06] Jesus said eunuchs are born from the
[2:06:09] womb
[2:06:10] some of them
[2:06:12] so that's a special anointing God forms
[2:06:14] them and gives them such a human Spirit
[2:06:15] where they don't need to get married
[2:06:17] they can just serve God no problem
[2:06:23] Galatians I'm sorry Acts 3 2 and acts 14
[2:06:25] 8 says these two men one were both one
[2:06:28] was lame one was blind I believe they
[2:06:30] were born that way from the womb
[2:06:33] well that gives us another picture
[2:06:36] it seems like it seems like to The World
[2:06:38] God made a mistake but church God
[2:06:39] doesn't make any mistakes
[2:06:43] knew about that
[2:06:45] disability God knew about that paralyzed
[2:06:47] condition God knew about the blindness
[2:06:49] and by God's grace he healed them on
[2:06:51] this side
[2:06:54] he left something undone over here in
[2:06:56] the womb in order to manifest his power
[2:06:58] on this side
[2:07:00] Hallelujah but he knew all of it from
[2:07:03] the mother's womb
[2:07:05] and then he told Jeremiah I knew you
[2:07:07] before I formed you
[2:07:09] thank God Amen
[2:07:11] I knew you before the womb praise God
[2:07:15] because brother Graham said remember we
[2:07:16] come he said we Jesus came the regular
[2:07:18] line from attribute in the mind of God
[2:07:20] to theophany flesh glorified body but
[2:07:23] these two switch for All Humans we we
[2:07:25] start from the attribute of God then we
[2:07:28] go to flesh to be tested
[2:07:30] and then after flesh after we die we get
[2:07:32] a glorified body oh hallelujah amen at
[2:07:35] the rapture we get a glorified body
[2:07:37] Hallelujah
[2:07:39] attribute flesh the
[2:07:41] odd body hallelujah thank God
[2:07:46] and lastly Paul said I was called from
[2:07:49] my mother's womb to preach the
[2:07:51] unsearchable riches of Christ
[2:07:54] let's stand to our feet
[2:07:56] Church what musicians can come what were
[2:07:58] you called to do from the mother's womb
[2:08:05] Jesus cares so much for us
[2:08:08] as we've seen in the natural development
[2:08:10] if he cares so much for us in the our
[2:08:13] natural development what about our
[2:08:14] Spiritual Development
[2:08:16] if he took a week on my fingernails
[2:08:20] he's probably gonna need more time on
[2:08:21] that to overcome my pride
[2:08:27] how about my selfishness how long is
[2:08:29] that going to take
[2:08:31] or he really works
[2:08:33] he's really got to work and form it
[2:08:35] and change things
[2:08:37] how long is that going to take
[2:08:40] but I can be confident that very God who
[2:08:42] formed the natural helped me develop
[2:08:44] naturally and mature the same God will
[2:08:46] help me develop spiritually
[2:08:49] because that's really the more important
[2:08:51] part
[2:08:54] how many believe that by God's grace
[2:09:03] the Bible says Philippians 1 6 being
[2:09:05] confident of this very thing that he
[2:09:07] which began a good work in you will
[2:09:09] perform it
[2:09:10] until the day of Jesus Christ
[2:09:13] and Jesus said teaching them to observe
[2:09:15] all things whatsoever command and use
[2:09:17] now listen to church we're all trying to
[2:09:18] obey all things right
[2:09:20] we're all in the process of learning to
[2:09:22] obey all things Jesus said
[2:09:26] none of us can say I've obeyed all
[2:09:28] things today brother Jesse nobody can
[2:09:29] say that
[2:09:31] but I love this part and lo I'm with you
[2:09:34] alway
[2:09:35] even unto the end of the world
[2:09:38] amen
[2:09:39] let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer
[2:09:42] I didn't really know how this was going
[2:09:44] to turn out I'm just as surprised if
[2:09:45] anyone
[2:09:51] I really am
[2:09:53] humbled In God's Presence too
[2:09:57] because I love Jesus I'm thankful that
[2:10:00] he gave me this life
[2:10:03] thankful he adopted me into his family I
[2:10:06] didn't deserve it as we see here in the
[2:10:09] scripture no one deserves it we'll get
[2:10:12] to it maybe so Romans 3 says all have
[2:10:15] fallen short in the way of God
[2:10:17] there's none that doeth righteous
[2:10:20] not one
[2:10:22] and to think he took a week just to
[2:10:25] focus on my nose
[2:10:29] it took a week just to make sure that my
[2:10:31] elbow bends the right way
[2:10:35] then I'll complain if I get up like I
[2:10:36] said
[2:10:39] [Music]

[2:11:29] Jeremiah 1 4 that the word Lord came
[2:11:31] unto me saying before I form thee in the
[2:11:33] belly I knew thee
[2:11:35] before thou came his Force out of the
[2:11:37] womb I sanctify thee
