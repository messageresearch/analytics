and Sunday so look forward to that and looking forward to have brother Samuel Browning in December looking forward to that and I'm trying to hook up with brother Brooks for some uh dates in January by the grace of God the supernatural book of Acts Church Acts chapter 2 verse one I just love this you know two one or two verses in we already see the supernatural in the book of Acts Church the the fire of the Holy Spirit right the wind of the Holy Spirit coming in uh let's read uh by God's grace why don't we read uh verses three and four together I'll read verses one and two okay and then we can read three and four together and when the day of Pentecost was fully come they were all with one Accord in one place and suddenly there came a sound from Heaven as of a rushing Mighty Wind and it filled all the house where they were sitting let's read verse 3 and 4 1 2 3 and there appeared unto them clothing tongues like as of fire and it sat upon each of them and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance amen let's have one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's make it known unto God here tonight Lord I'm in need and I'm not just saying that for a fashion Lord I surely need your grace Lord God tired I got a headache Lord God but I need your grace and mercy here tonight Lord God trusting in you Lord God so Heavenly Father we love you here tonight father God I pray You' Lord speak through me Lord and Lord hear through each one of us even me Lord I need to hear from you Lord I need your strength I need your grace so Minister Lord now by the grace of God Hallelujah Lord thank you for this Supernatural book of Acts Church Lord God and as your Prophet said we are a continuation of it Lord God so we thank you God that we can be a part of this book of Acts Church Father God help us Lord each one Lord to find our individual positions Lord within this church our GI gifts our callings there without repentance Lord each person has a unique Ministry a unique set of gifts or gift dear God and I pray you minister to the needs here tonight in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said am amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God okay so I set the timer there I'm not going to forget here tonight I know it's a school night but I also want to get in the Holy Spirit praise God by God's grace so I want to look at the supernatural book of Acts church I was also studying I I was telling you I kind of want to preach a lot on uh brother brandom's Ministry because I haven't i' I've been led to preach on the the teachings of brother brandom not so much on the life story of it there's and there's a purpose behind that uh because we know I I we know we don't want to go too far on Stories We want to stay right in the middle of the road praise God we want to preach the word and yes we want to know about brother Ram's life uh but we know I know I don't know about you but I know of too many churches that go too much on stories and they don't get enough word of God in them so I've I've sought to try to find the balance uh but today in the last few weeks I've been studying on um that book generation brother bram's granddaughter wrote that book with the help of you know numerous Witnesses but maybe next Wednesday I'll start that series I want to start a series on uh a supernatural generation and I want I want to read some of those uh testimonies we can play the audio numerous of those people in those books their their testimonies are right on tape for example brother wayy died right in the the church and then he was raised up by by the prayer from brother brandom and the Saints there in 1963 it's just a tremendous testimony there um so and then you know the there's numerous people that were there when the pillar of fire uh came on the back wall it was the back left wall if you're at the platform it was the back left wall of the church so for us for you guys it be the back right wall um numerous people were there saw it it's on tape you can hear the people screaming and shouting and and worshiping uh so many Supernatural things happen I'd like to share some of those stories I believe that will build your faith as well praise God I find myself the more I read that the more I think about supernatural things is God moving here is God moving there where where is God moving we want to be right in position when God wants to move praise God so I just thought I'd start these uh series here and let's start with the supernatural uh book of Acts Church you know we're going to start in Acts chapter 2 and you know in Acts chapter 1 Jesus Promised the power in verse 8 he said ye shall receive the power power after that the the after that the Holy Ghost is come upon you and you shall be Witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem and in Judea and Samaria and unto the uttermost part of the earth Hallelujah so according to Jesus the Holy Ghost gives power for gifts power for Supernatural but also power to be a testimony to be a witness no matter where you live right whether it's in the United States or whether it's India or Africa or Australia wherever you live you have power to be a witness praise God you can live the message wherever you go right people will know he's different she's different they're living a different life because they have the power of God in them and church I believe as brother R said from time to time God will show Supernatural power in your life power to heal your sicknesses amen power to foretell the future power to discern Spirits Hallelujah all the power of the nine gifts of the Holy Spirit and I like what brother BR said you know the book is called um The Acts of the Apostles but brother said it's the acts of the Holy Ghost in the apostles how many how many of us know that that we have no acts of ourselves worth writing about right if you had the acts of Jesse or the acts of Lydia or whoever they wouldn't be worth writing but if the acts of the Holy Spirit In Our Lives then it's worth something worth writing praise God it's something worth remembering hallelujah it's something worth telling the story about praise God when God comes and does an act in our lives praise God now remember Church they were assembled together for fear after Jesus crucifixion John 12 I'm sorry John 20: 19 then the same day at evening being the first day of the week when the doors were shut where the disciples were assembled for fear of the Jews came Jesus and stood in the midst and saith unto them peace be unto you now we don't know how long this fear lasted right but we know over the next uh we over the next 50 days you know Jesus would uh would show himself to them I'm sorry for 40 days right he'd show himself to them uh and We Know by the last 10 days the last 10 days out of those 50 days 120 people gathered up into a room and we're not told of any stirring or anything like that there was no real move of the Holy Spirit imagine waiting for 10 days waiting for the Holy Spirit to move now that encourages me because we can wait as long as God wants us to wait praise God we got to obey the word stay in prayer stay in worship stay in the word and wait for God to move how many content to wait on God hallelujah they had to wait on God and God finally moved praise God but none of that time was wasted the Bible said they were in one place in one Accord they were praying no doubt they were having Fellowship praise God hallelujah there's no time wasted if you're in the timeline of God hallelujah your life's not wasted the years aren't wasted right the only wasted time is Wasted Years in sin right but even those can be redeemed praise God hallelujah remember six months of ministry John the Baptist was greater than all the years that Abraham served God because no man was born greater than John the Baptist six months now that's quite a thing to say 6 months is greater than 175 years of Abraham that's what Jesus said so how many believe Jesus CU it's the qu it's the quality rather than the quantity as we've said many times but notice they were assembled together for fear but as they as they stayed together in Fellowship the fear faded away and Faith started prevailing Hallelujah brother R tells us now brother R dramatizes and he says you know he said maybe about three or four days in you know James and John they looked at to each other and said well we think we got it we should go preach right now right but brother R said Peter would come up and say no let's wait Jesus said there's got to be power we got to have a supernatural power and yes we have maybe H happiness or fellowship or whatever but we need some power right so no doubt there was questions amongst the group but when God came there was no more question amen church that's how it is for your life that's how is for my life when God comes on the scene nobody wonders about it praise God because God vindicates his word right and it's as simple as even the uh the unic who's reading his Bible right who you know who is this about you know Isaiah 53 who is this servant and then God sends Phillip and he says do you know who you're reading about no but I want to know can you tell me who this is so it's as simple as God answering your questions praise God that reveals God's presence in your life Hallelujah and how many know his presence has been with you all day praise God all day it never leaves you he never forsakes you but at some point the fear starts to leave and so I encourage us no matter you know I know I often I shouldn't say often but sometimes I battle fear about you know the squeeze and uh who wouldn't right everybody's human right uh but you know we we got to be encouraged no matter what we battle God is going to bring us into the condition where faith is our supreme power amen right because we'll have the Supreme faith for the Supreme hour Hallelujah and so here the church had fear but God moved them to Faith over the course of 50 days oh my a lot can happen in a month and a half and the church said a lot can happen right look at Sarah's life a lot could happen in one year right nine months she there's no way she laughs at God she lies to God's face and within a year she's holding Isaac hallelujah oh my and laughing God made her to laugh God made her to believe the promise of God hallelujah a lot can happen in a short time like we saw with Samson these last few services now in the church age book brother BR says remember this Christ in the true true church is a continuation of the book of Acts all right so that's why I said earlier you and I are continuing the book of Acts it's not a separate book it's a continuation but this book isn't written on paper this book is written in heaven amen hallelujah think about that brother Ram's life would be in the book of Acts but so would yours hallelujah our humble little life right we'd be one of those small little uh small little churches there in the book of Acts we'd be one of those small churches that Paul went and visited him and Barnabas and then and then you know uh him and Mark and they make little trips and they go around strengthening the CH the churches right because that's what Paul said we started churches let's go see how the Brethren are doing oh I like that don't you like when I love that like last time uh who was here brother Diggs or somebody yeah brother Diggs last time he was here he said I just want to tell you uh you all have a great uh worship service because you really worship God and you really pull on the word that's like a that's like a report coming from a man who travels around the world and gives us a good report amen we're not a backlin and lukewarm Church we're a church that loves Jesus amen we're a church that loves to worship and even with a small group you can feel the presence of God that people love God and they want more of God praise God like brother R said you give people a choir and then they stop singing right right sing for me no you're the choir I'm the choir hallelujah amen I there's nothing wrong with the choir but I'm saying you know if you let that come up come up if you make that too much of a thing if if we make song specials too much then the people don't have a song right we got to have let the people have a song everybody's supposed to have a part in this worship Hallelujah everybody now brother said the Antichrist spirit is is is shown in the Book of Revelation that it would come and defile the church making it lukewarm formal and Powerless that's what the Antichrist does he said Revelation exposes Satan revealing his Works he said uh Satan fights it he cannot stand it he knows if the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for and that she can do the Greater Works she will be an invincible Army that's a beautiful quote hallah it's one we've heard many times over the years but it's true Satan hates the Book of Revelation I'll say like this no doubt he hates the book of Acts too right he doesn't like the book of Acts because it shows what The Church Must Be brother Ram said Common Sense tells you the book of Acts is the church in action and our action should be like the book of Acts amen hallelujah absolutely right and so church we that's what we do we get a true revelation of the word and it helps us withstand evil spirits in our lives hallelujah thank God church God has blessed us with the ministry I I can't remember the last time we had a a minister in and we felt like a demon power was trying to get into the church right I can't remember last time God has really blessed us right but brother Brooks told me in over in Lima when we were going there he said a brother came in and he tried to quench the Holy Spirit and said we get the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation and it cooled the church down it was the Antichrist trying to get into the church but I like brother Brooks he withstood that spirit amen and that's why he preached so much on worshiping and raise your hand hands and you know that's what the church battled the Antichrist tried to cool them down but the Holy Ghost will trying to stir you up praise God is that right see the Antichrist makes you weak powerless uh trapped in sin but God makes you hate sin praise God God makes you love the word of God God makes you hungry for the Holy Spirit praise God hallelujah I can understand why brother Brooks did that because that's what his church was value and the brother turned out he's already left the message that's right I forgot about that he already put a big video out there and he just misunderstood all brother Ram's uh situations but the Holy Ghost reveals it to us praise God why because we know brother Ram pointed us to the Bible amen hallelujah and the brother forgot to read the rest of the quote brother R said it's the baptism of the Holy Ghost without sensation but it's Christ in you performing the same works that Christ diden now that's the Holy Ghost we need amen hallelujah see brother ra is saying he means without you have to speak in tongues that's what he's saying you don't have to have the same sensation but you got to have the same Life of Christ we want the works of Christ we want the power of Christ the testimony of Christ we want Jesus amen remember the leyan church will lock Jesus out and Jesus is knocking saying can I get in the service Church May the door be open today so Jesus comes into this service praise God is that right we can't get weak and lukewarm and cool off we got to stay hot for Jesus amen hallelujah amen glory amen amen but said we'll be an invincible Army now I said there's a balance to this the entire Church of Christ will always be Invincible Army but what he means is each generation has a choice will either be Invincible or will become lukewarm but I got news for the devil right we we've all we've all shown him with our lives we will be Invincible by the power of God amen hallelujah amen it doesn't mean we we does that doesn't mean we uh we never sin it doesn't mean we never struggle but the in other words the message will keep living on in our lives amen we will not denominate we not let the Antichrist spirit in here we'll let the Holy Spirit have free course amen hallelujah he says if they can get a true Revelation and by God's spirit discern and withstand the Antichrist Spirit Satan will be powerless before he will be as definitely thwarted today as when Christ with stood his every effort I'm sorry every effort to gain power over him in the desert yes Satan hates Revelation but we love it I'm G to say it again we love Revelation oh you never heard a sermon like that before and God will send somebody in here or your pastor whoever and you'll hear something oh I never seen it like that before it's God's revelation to us we love moments like that amen Hallelujah we love it with true Revelation Our Lives the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us but we will prevail over them Samson Hallelujah that's right brother said the true church will always try to be like it was in the book of Acts that's exactly right will always try to power in our lives well what if somebody's sick what would they do in the book of Acts lay hands on them right that's what they would do pray for them if somebody's arrested what would they do start a prayer chain that's something we got to do praise God hallelujah right we got to be if somebody doesn't have food we got to feed them Hallelujah no matter whatever they did in the book of Acts that's what we got to do praise Goden look to the book of Acts and try notice he says try to be like that is any church perfect no was even the book of Acts Church perfect no they weren't perfect but they had the power of God there amen they were the alpha Church and brother is trying to say when Jesus comes down as The Headstone as he uses this illustration all the time when this this uh when this uh pyramid comes down it has to match perfectly the the the top of the Earthly pyramid and so so he says the ministry of Jesus has to look just like the book of Acts church at the end time our ministry has to look just like Jesus's Ministry and Jesus said I always do that which pleased the Father and Jesus said I only do what the father shows me praise God Amen I want to preach a sermon on that I had that idea this week I want to preach a sermon on I only do what the father shows me see because we got to rely in other words it's he's either going to show you in the word or show it to you by memory or show it to you by some sermon or something right we only do what the father shows us praise God Amen oh it's beautiful see we've got to try to always be like the book of Acts Church brother said denominations he said they try to prove they have it all or they have enough he said yet is that the truth compare this 20th century Church to the first church go ahead do that where's the power he said where's the love where is the purified church that withstood sin and walk with faith towards Jesus where is the Unity how many questions is this one two three four he said where's the purified church that withstood sin and walk with faith toward Jesus where is the unity you can't find it now I would say we can find it praise God we got love we got Unity we got power at times right but God never told us how often he'd heal God doesn't heal all the time God doesn't heal every time praise God he said if if this church today has all it needs why were they crying out for more of God in the book of Acts that was Acts chapter 4 I read it a few Wednesdays ago it might have been last Wednesday I can't remember why were they crying out for more of God as though they didn't have it all and yet they had far more than what the churches have today what a question if this church if the if if we're the greatest Christians of all time which I never said we were that's what they say if that's true why aren't they crying out for more of God hallelujah why aren't they feeding the sick Hallelujah right sorry why aren they uh uh feeding the poor right why aren't they getting locked up in jail and see I'm not being locked up either I'm just saying I'm not but I'm not the one calling myself the greatest of all time they're the ones calling themselves the greatest of all time see but this ought to make us a h give us a great reminder that we need to constantly ask God for more of God's word more of his Spirit we got to be hungry for more of God hallelujah and like I said it don't take an hour and a half sermon brother Jesse thought I'd get a few more amens on that one no it's okay Peter preached for five minutes and the Holy Ghost fell cornelius's house amen it don't take a long time Hallelujah and I'll tell you I'm content if I see the spirit of God fall and I can't preach anymore we'll close up and we'll worship amen we'll just worship till you run out of steam amen I can hear I can hear it when your celebr starts running out of steam I can hear it I can I get some of those medes I can by the third song fourth song I can all right we better stop this and give them a chance to cool down but sometimes it just keeps going right if it's a remember the Napoleon service remember uh three years ago when Cam and brother Brooks were here that was that was a another four or five hour service there if I'm not mistaken I could go look it up it just went from one song to the next the hearts are on fire the minds are all Ablaze Hallelujah the sincerity is returned amen we recognize the presence of Christ hallelujah amen Revelation has struck us amen and that was a service when Emma felt the wind of the Holy Spirit come to the church now somebody else felt it was it you sister who somebody else once yeah once uh people have heard angels in here hallelujah you know it's supernatural there are angels here praise God he camps around you because you fear God hallelujah amen these were men of sacrifice or women of sacrifice as well Hallelujah now the Bible said they Hazard their lives for for the name of Jesus Christ would you put that up therea it's acts 15:26 men that have hazarded their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ now with all due respect there have been some message preachers that have got arrested right and I that that's a real sign of service towards God when you're willing to get arrested for the Gospel of Jesus Christ but there's more than just that they didn't die they got out of jail most of them but the disciples and the apostles they didn't get all out of jail and the ones I know of the message they never got beaten but the apostles got beaten they got whipped 39 times that's just on one whipping right remember Paul had that was it five times or three times Thrice I think it was Thrice Thrice yeah and remember His you know we're not going to go through his resume but I went through that when William was here I remember vividly when he's like oh we just did a bible study on that over the zoom call and you came and preach at that that next service so I remember that uh that was a red letter Day by God's grace just given the Vindication but Paul had all those sufferings and he said am I not an apostle who's really suffered for the Gospel of Jesus Christ that's who the true Servants of God are praise God Amen Hallelujah so we need to cry out for more of God remember we're a continuation in the book of Acts and cry out for more revelation we need more Revelation because that's what will overcome the Gates of Hell hallelujah it's exactly right right and we always have to try to be like the book of Acts how many want to be like the book of Acts amen go to Acts 2 43 case would you pull that up there acts 243 the Bible said and fear Came Upon every soul and many signs and wonders were done by the apostles when their 3,000 were saved and they went from house to house fear Came Upon on the people that's respect for God that's this idea I'm watching everything I say and do all day because I know God's around right the fear of God so the early church had a fear of God everything they said everything they did it was important because they knew they wanted to please Jesus hallelujah amen now Church you know as far as numbers you know I I don't know if the Rapture will be like the 3,000 that g that God saved on the day of Pentecost I don't know if it'll be anything like that I don't know but we do know fewer and fewer people will be saved that's what Jesus said few there be that find it and then Paul said evil seducers shall wax worse and worse deceived and being deceived and Jesus said he said the love of many shall wax cold so there's less love less PE there's few people being saved right uh there's more deception than ever but we've got to be the light in the midst of Darkness we've got to be the salt of the earth in a taste of society praise God Amen I believe we are praise God hallelujah and as brother bam said who would despise a day of small things remember where I preached out of that out of was it Zechariah if I'm not mistaken yes there's less being saved but this is God's will for this day it's not the age of an open door it's the age of being hot in the midst of Leonia amen hallelujah it's the age of getting eyes out it's age of getting white rment it's the age of getting spiritual gold time tested Faith Hallelujah that's the age that it is where few people be saved hallelujah it's the age of restoration remember brother Ram said in Look Away to Jesus 63 he said my ministry will drop down because prophecy has to catch up to what's already happened he said he said my Ministry is not going to get greater it's going to get less known and hasn't that happened was that man right or not that man was right hallelujah praise God see so we see there's less and less but that shouldn't discourage us from praying for Revelation for being a continuation of the book of Acts Church Hallelujah for waiting on God for trusting in God and remembering that our lives have to match the book of Acts praise God Amen thank the Lord we're all waiting for the latter rain but until then let's enjoy the former rain that's the way I believe it I do enjoy that don't you I enjoy being taught by the message of this hour the Bible revelations God gave to brother bradam Hallelujah and the Bible said 1 Corinthians 12:31 covet earnestly the best gifts and yet show I unto you a more excellent way now last Wednesday we did a good job well that's my that's my humble opinion we were praying for miracles what are we praying for the greater gifts now the greatest gift seem to be prophecy because it will bless more people that's what we're going to have to pray for tonight only been preaching let's see been preaching 25 minutes already ah that clocks wrong but see there's a we got to pray for that we got to pray we have to earnestly covet that we got to have times where we called to God not just when we're sick not just when we're things are tight financially while we're well while things are going good we got to call out to God hallelujah just things that that are going good that don't mean things are going good right that don't that don't mean spiritually everything's going good praise God we got to call to God the Bible said call upon God while you can Hallelujah call Isaiah says that call upon him while he's near Hallelujah and it's not the tribulation Hallelujah am and so the uh these early Apostles had the Holy Ghost and testimonies and it brought great fear upon the people oh yeah brother Paul Jackson texted me and said people were still talking about the sermon last week in the service amen see the Holy Ghost makes a difference it makes all the difference amen that's that's all it is it's the Holy Ghost and I hope you know I hope in two weeks we'll be talking about what God preached through brother Diggs glory and the church said remember that service oh that was wonderful you know another uh it's like the Theo I always use the Theo because that's the most recent one you know oh remember that time what a time what God does hallelujah God moves uh acts 5 verse5 after ananas and Safa died the Bible said they gave up The Ghost and great fear Came Upon all them that heard these things right now church that's what that's what God is restoring us back to he's restoring us back to a real fear of God right I prayed that before Lord don't let any sin come in that door am praise God am and I think that's why God's given us Grace with all these good preachers amen as far as I know now we had preachers at the beginning that have left the message but they never left any of their stained do Doctrine they're false Doctrine by God's grace but great fear what would that look like today like when brother di when brother dig says uh pre people don't want to uh they don't even want to worship think about is great fear upon a church that doesn't want to worship how about is great fear on a church that just chews their nails all the service or sleeps and snores and drools down their chin is that no it's okay for Zion but not for us now we all get tired don't get wrong sometime like when Ben was here last time I was really tired you know I was really tired that day it happens to all of us but I'm saying the early church with the fire of God on fire zealous for God there was great fear on them praise God they really respected God and that's what God's bringing us back to hallelujah amen but I've also seen it it goes in years as well because I I think our greatest time of Revival was 2010 to 2012 that's what from my records that's what I can see right that was the most miracles on my list I wrote them down there that's the most miracles on our list it was just three years 10 11 12 three years of just blessing after blessing but I love what God said I'll restore sayith the Lord amen I told you there's different churches like ones in Louisiana and even Ohio that are experiencing revivals but their pastors have preached for 40 or 50 years and they've seen it go up and down for 10 years 20 years 15 years and churches go through revivals like that so it you know I I'm saying this not to discourage anybody but just to let you know church has church have to go through trials all of us got to go through the Hall of critics amen right if every service was a great Revival we wouldn't appreciate this the quiet humble Services right right we'd run out of we would probably ruin our vocal cords which some preachers probably already have maybe they'll never get it back uh you know we we'd have all kinds of uh you know we'd expect God you know to be there every time but what if God pulls himself back like Hezekiah to test us would I would we doubt we're saved you know see that's why we need a revelation that we're saved we need a revelation that we have no condemnation come on church we need a revelation that the blood of Jesus Christ perfects us hallelujah whether rain or shine for better or worse as the vow say for the marriage amen for rich or poor the blood of Jesus Christ he's made a covenant and we are his bride we've got his wedding band of unmar Grace amen hallelujah we belong to him and he belongs to us praise God like brother R said it's a law of contrast if you never were sick you never know the blessing of being well you wouldn't know a good woman without the the lowness of a prostitute out there in an akan you got to have you got to have the contrast and it just it's just been more real to me every Church goes through for this we just got to keep moving on with God Amen because God sayith God I will restore he said right that's not my words Brother Martin that's God's words amen I'll restore all those what months all those years oh come on somebody all those years that have been that have passed by and you missed the move of God or we struggled through we're learning how to overcome I'll restore all those years we'll get all the blessings of all those years poured and and given back to us praise God we'll get them restored back any years that that Wen as great as they could have been or as good we'll get those back if we just follow on to know the Lord that's what the Bible says in Hosea I don't have the verse right in front of me but the Bible said if you follow on to know the Lord he will find you he will return to you amen hallelujah people can't raise their hands they can't even sing they just need the choir to sing where's the fear of God in that they can't say Amen to the word of God right can't come up and pray for somebody I mean I've been to I've been to numerous message churches my goodness I'm not going to name them but I preach my heart out I'm sweating and crying and one or two people come up and the whole church just sits there and don't even come up to pray for these people you got teenagers between hell and heaven and nobody comes up to pray for them right what's wrong with these people they're they're they're lukewarm they're miserable naked uh and have need of nothing they don't have a need of a holy ghost filled Saint in the church something's wrong with that praise God hallelujah so after I preached hour and a half or maybe two hours if I'm a guest preacher then I'm the one who's got to go up and labor and I'm the one who's got to pray them through through which is okay but how come we got all these people that say they're filled with the Holy Ghost and don't have a care to pray for this person at the altar something's wrong that's not the fear of God the church said I didn't play to preach that tonight that kind of came out so it could could mean something it may not mean nothing I'm not God but great fear Came Upon them church if we say we're the book of Acts Church we've got to strive with all we have to be the book of Acts church now here's something brother man said I thought was very striking in the church age book remember that Moses was born for a certain work but he could not do that work until he had received the gifts which would enable him to do that work he had to go out in the desert and wait there God had an appointed time so I want to read this to show you you know some of us wonder what are the gifts and you know my life and all these things church God has an appointed time amen hallelujah think about Simeon and Anna remember they were old servants in the temple when Jesus was born all those years they were not wasted praise God Elizabeth right and her husband Zacharias all those years no children children right it wasn't a waste Anna was a a widow all those years no husband she just served god with prayer and fasting all those years but then she gets to see God's salvation hallelujah oh there's no Wast of time in God Amen serve God reverently faithful ex Express to God your desires Faithfully serve him and he'll give you the desires of your heart praise God Amen absolutely but some of those gifts didn't operate to the very ends of their life right but I love this Moses Mo now of course the burning bush represented the baptism of the Holy Ghost if I'm not mistaken I could be wrong on that there could be a different type in there maybe when he come down with the face glow maybe that represent the Holy Ghost I don't know I actually don't know I have to go search the quotes for the types we can see lots of types in there okay now I think I got those are my original notes I wanted to make sure I preached there those are some good quotes very important quotes to show how we are a continuation but we've got to desire more of God's power and when the Holy Ghost comes great fear comes upon the people they'll be very reverent to the Holy Spirit now Acts 2 verse4 says and they were all filled with the Holy Ghost and began to speak with other tongues as the spirit gave them utterance so according to my understanding the Holy Ghost filled their souls and they started speaking in tongues they didn't understand so they they ran out in the streets and declared they're trying to declare the wonderful works of God and all these 17 Nations heard the gospel in their own languages that's the best that I can understand right Supernatural so Supernatural wind Supernatural fire I'll say like this Supernatural Unity as well because they were all in one place and notice they weren't arguing about who's the greatest preacher like they were before see there were just saying Jesus promis it Jesus promis it may God help us this weekend to to claim the promise of God Jesus you promise Jesus you promis bless the youth amen pour out your spirit Hallelujah visit our church we need Miracles we need the spirit poured out we have great fear towards God hallelujah amen meanings are not done in vain people don't travel all these hundreds of miles in vain brother brother digs doesn't travel in vain hallelujah amen there's a purpose Hallelujah they're out into the streets a supernatural move of God it was noise abroad it was noisy brother said wherever there's God there's noise right right but the other side of it sometimes God does great things and there's no noise like the planets uh revolving around the solar system right or was it discs which one was it was disc or I'm just kidding that's a joke and then later on they speak in tongues prophesy and G and the Bible said you they'll dream dreams and they'll have Visions praise God Amen oh God may we go to bed asking God for a dream or vision and then wake up with the satisfaction that God spoke to us praise God amen amen just having just living under that expectation praise God I know when I had that one dream of brother Ram it moved me more to prayer than ever before because I thought have I disappointed your brother brm have I disappointed then God had to use Brother Ray to come in there and give me a a better understanding why don't you ask God he said brother brother brother brand said why don't you ask God I thought I had but apparently I hadn't some type of rebuke but God speaks to us church and then 22 God approved Jesus by Miracles wonders and signs that's what approves people's lives is the signs wonders and miracles that fill their lives that was Jesus's Vindication Hallelujah and then Peter says say God shed forth this which you see and hear so when the Holy Ghost Falls people will see it and people will hear it amen the r said a woman never rarely had a baby without any pain I guess there are a couple my wife could probably tell of some other friends that maybe had a baby without any pain but in most cases under normal circumstances and normal women you can see it and you can hear it right and that's exactly what the new birth is you can see something's happening you can hear something's happening amen glory and you're not ashamed of it you don't care who's around because eternal life is around amen eternal life has come around and it's lived in your soul praise God Amen you're not ashamed of eternal life that's what you wanted your whole life amen that's right that's right Hallelujah you wanted eternal life you wanted power you want to be a witness you want to change you want the the love of God and when it comes how could you be quiet praise God amen amen how could I ever walk away from the one who saved my life amen hallelujah and after they got baptized they were gladly hearing the word and God added to their church and they Fellowship gladly you didn't have to beg him to come to church I'm glad I I don't have to beg any of you to come to church Hallelujah they like hearing from the preachers they like asking the preachers questions that's why I'm glad you guys asked me questions and the Bible said they had many wonders and signs done by the apostles how am I doing all my time okay about 40 minutes or so hard to believe that now I want to read these quotes just in as encouragement here brother Ram says this in why 1959 is that I don't know if that's my fault yep it's probably my fault that was definitely me sometimes I just try to screw these in make him a little more steady I guess I don't know I'm not a not an audio guy he said until that man gets all those human-made psychology beat out of him by the holy spirit this man said a denominational man's got to get all of his man-made ideas beat out of him like gold getting beaten right like a precious metal getting beaten not like a parent beating a child not like that not like that at all shouldn't beat your children anyway you ought to have enough wisdom not to beat them got to apply the rod but don't beat them there's the difference like I told you I used to use the bamboo now my wife does such a good job I haven't had to do it for a while so these younger ones are really lucky they didn't have to uh they're really lucky they must have learned from their older siblings right guys no pain no gain they said I only got spank One Time by my dad that was really awful he said uh but he gets you got to get psychology beat out of them by the Holy Spirit and lay there until they're rotten to their own ideas and then they'll receive the Holy Ghost you got to lay there get beat and R out I'm so tired of this I'm so tired of this old life I want a new life praise God Amen that's what they did at Pentecost Hallelujah that let the Holy Spirit beat all their man-made Creeds all the Pharisee and sadducee and herodian and and and and the scribes and all their nonsense beat out of them you don't have power we don't have power we'll know and we've got power power hallelujah amen we'll know when we got power hallelujah it's exactly right the no birth the new birth sorry is no different from any other birth it's a mess that's why brother R said you don't come up and shake a preacher's hand and you're born again no sir you got to have a mess you ought to seen what mess I was in when I got it and brother Ram said every once in a while I like this it comes upon me me again I get messy again with it he said I cry and boohoo and I carry on until I guess I don't look very good to look at but I got something on the inside of me that's taking me on and on and on and on and on he said ah I can go on and on into October of 2023 and I can go into 2024 however many years the Lord tell I've got power to go on Hallelujah that's exactly right because it keeps coming on me amen glory it keeps anointing me it keeps humbling me it keeps uh uh pushing out any man-made ideas any any sin it keeps driving all that out and keeps me humble in his presence praise God he said it's new life I don't care what it looks like I want to know what it is that's the main thing brother said in identify with Christ 1959 no no one can receive the Holy Ghost without being something happening to them he said they'll see the results Hallelujah that's right the Holy Ghost brings results you are a new person Hallelujah the old things have passed away behold All Things become new Hallelujah brother raham said I'll stand with you someday in the Judgment bar or the day of judgment he said I'll never answer the Creed I'll answer to the Bible there's no place in the Bible where they ever receive the Holy Ghost without having aemotion speaking with tongues shoutings praising of God and prophecies and manifestations they never did just walk up and shakes hand with the preacher and walk away how many times have I seen that over other churches people come up for the Holy Ghost and they can't even cry they can't even shout I'm sorry something has to happen right all I can do is cry with all my heart and it never fails when the person's ready to be born they're born because the Holy Ghost that's on me is also on them Hallelujah now don't get me wrong I'm I'm very I'm very cognizant of the fact that there's a time and season to be born right you only get certain animals at certain times of the year right you only get a human after nine months of waiting you know very cognizant of that as well but people have to be able to open themselves up keep coming for the Holy Ghost keep praying and then when it comes everybody will see it everybody will hear it it'll give you power Hallelujah and our experience has to match the book of Acts that's what I told those girls when we left Napoleon right I said If ever anybody felt like they' been to the book of Acts that was a service for these young ones here right is that right girls we're screaming shouting crying running praying for the sick dancing if there ever was a time that that that that you could say I would I could kind of understand the book of Acts that ought have been it praise God Amen I was just glad to be there when it happened amen hallelujah brother said you cannot receive the baptism of the Holy Ghost without having an experience when it happens and when you believe and are made up of the instructions of the holy spirit it's love joy peace longsuffering goodness the fruits that it Bears out into the holy spirit with a fiery experience notice that fiery experience comes down and lights that candle the soul am then you haven't received the Holy Ghost you've got to have the experience to have the Holy Ghost oh I love it praise God last time I was at uh well not the last time but one of the last few times I was there in Junction City I felt I felt led to preach to them on the baptis of the Holy Ghost I might told you the testimony and five people come up afterwards uh there was a couple people that cried but five people come up and say I've just was praying for the baptism of the Holy Ghost I just had questions about the baptism of the Holy Ghost and you preach exactly what we were uh praying for and the one sister the night before had just stayed now listen a teenage girl stay at the altar till midnight seeking the baptism of Holy Ghost and she didn't receive it but she was so encouraged the next day the preacher preached about it now that's love for God when was the last time any of us laid at this altar or laid at your chair for till midnight and then still got enough courage I'm going to come back and keep seeking God Amen that's Faith amen that's love and she was raised in the message right so we got no excuse whether you're raised in it or you're not ra raised in it what matters is you love God you're hungry for God and you want an experience hallelujah amen amen where am I at at my time I just keep forgetting okay all right 45 they asked brother brandham in questions and answers part 2 64 at the inst of receiving the holy ghost or the baptism of the Holy Ghost is there a difference does a person speak with tongues if not always what manifestation is known well could you imagine a mother giving birth to a baby and not knowing it she'd have to be unconscious not to know it neither can you receive the Holy Ghost without knowing it amen so where's the S where's the thing without sensation where does that quote line up now amen you see that's they they misinterpret the quotes they instead of taking the quotes back to the Bible praise God take every quote back to the Bible everything back to the scripture and then you're sure get thus sayith the Lord we got th say the Lord amen he said there's something takes place in you see there's something that changes you your whole system your whole spiritual system is made new again I'm not the same Jesse Smith I was I'm full of love I'm full of power I'm full of these fruits of the Holy Spirit I'm full of God's spirit and you become a new creature in Christ as the Bible puts it a new creation in Christ you know it Hallelujah and the church said now let me find a place to close here I'm already at 45 minutes I'm GNA go and read this one uh I was going to say this for next week but I may preach it again sometimes quotes are good to used twice in a row brother Ram said let me tell you if you want the devil stirred up just start preaching Divine Healing and okay brother show us that by the Bible brother would say okay sure I'll be happy to he said Peter preached on the day of Pentecost and 3,000 Souls were saved and Satan never even moved look at that look in the Bible did Satan ever attack him in Acts chapter 2 no now was it wonderful yes isn't salvation the greatest miracle the church said right so the greatest Miracle Satan doesn't get he doesn't move too much right he says but the couple days afterwards he healed a man at the gate called Beautiful who is lame and all hell turn loose on them that's right the devil don't like to see God display his power now we know which is the greater power the soul healing but the devil hates it when God shows his healing and miraculous power in the natural right but how many you know after you get the Holy Ghost well I know sister who knows it I know it I mean we all know it how many knows after you get the Holy Ghost the Devil comes and fights you right sometimes they'll fight you right at the door when you leave right but we overcome by the blood of the lamb and the word of Our Testimony I mean how many times have I preach I'm praying for people and the Devils figh me right here and then God still heals them it don't matter where the battle is all it matters if is if Christ is in the battle because if Christ is in the battle he's the Victor praise God oh thank God Amen like keep when I prayed for Johnny remember that testimony Johnny had that big swollen foot I don't know if you remember that he's walking here like these big old guy 66 he's like the Lord just told me if you curse it he's going to heal me well I didn't God didn't tell me nothing God told him that and I had a hard time praying I had a hard time believing that because my faith wasn't there that's a pretty big foot right and I don't know what's going to go on I who I don't know who's going to get healed or who's not all I know is we got to find the will of God well I said brother if that's your Revelation then I'll agree with you have you confessed your sin yes well then let's pray I curse that thing with all my heart but don't you know I was having mind battles the whole time too right then but we talked right after said well brother I appreciate your faith he said I'm already feeling better he said the next day he said it was 90% back to normal right but see the devil right there he's he's always going to be fighting he's always going to try to get that punch in but we forget our feelings and we focus on the word praise God we cast down anything that exalts itself against the word of God we believe God's word we press on and Jesus Christ is the mighty conqueror amen let's stand to our feet by God's grace the devil don't like to see God and display his power musicians can come here he thinks he's got a lot of power but he's finished amen our Christ is predominant amen take the initiative don't let him push something on you don't let him push something on you and the church said see there's times the enemy comes he's trying to get something on us but we got to push against that say I'm not accepting that I'm pushing back in the name of Jesus Christ amen church I'm looking at an invincible Army here tonight amen I love that I get to preach to an invincible Army every service praise God the devil won't he can't stop you and you we're not bragging it's it's humble he can't stop us because greater is he that's in us than he that's in the world it's just God's promise am it's not by my might not by my power but by the holy spirit will we struggle yes when we go through trials will God give and take away yes but the church keeps marching on praise God I love it I I love this and I share this when we had the Napoleon Services afterwards I love that I could be in a service I wasn't preaching but brother Brooks preached and the Holy Ghost fell and I'm so thankful in my generation I could preach and the Holy Ghost could fail or fall like that and so the Next Generation has had experiences that if they if they appreciate those experiences then they'll seek God until the Holy Ghost Falls in their generation now don't get me wrong I want the Holy Ghost to fall this Sunday we like the Holy Ghost to fall tonight praise God does everyone understand but it's the supernatural book of Acts Church let's bow our heads here tonight by God's grace as we pray uh you can stop the live stream God bless you live streamers love you bang amen Lena uh whoever's watching by God's grace Austin Jose God
