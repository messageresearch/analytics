[32:17] faith I'm sure that no yes yes Jesus is
[32:20] at all
[32:21] Alleluia let's look at a few verses of
[32:24] Scripture they look German i-29 we want
[32:30] to be traversed in some Lemaitre
[32:34] scriptures to us praise God
[32:37] what thus saith the Lord
[32:39] the after 70 years we accomplished at
[32:42] Babylon I will visit you and perform my
[32:46] good word toward you in causing you to
[32:49] return to this place where I know the
[32:52] thoughts that I think toward

[32:58] evil to give you and expected in then
[33:02] shall you call upon me and you shall go
[33:05] and pray unto me and I will hearken unto

[33:11] when you shall search for me with all
[33:15] your heart yes I will be found of you
[33:18] saith the Lord and I will turn away your
[33:21] captivity and I will gather you from all
[33:23] the nations and from all the places
[33:25] whether I have driven save the Lord and
[33:28] I will bring you again into the place
[33:31] once I caused you to be carried away
[33:34] captive hallelujah hey let's just look
[33:38] to the Lord in a word of Prayer tonight
[33:40] yes Jesus our Heavenly Father Lord we
[33:44] are just so thankful Lord
[33:46] once again Lord for your mercy new grass
[33:50] Lord we thank you Father Lord for a time
[33:53] opportunity Lord that we have Lord
[33:56] Father we realize that Lord these times
[33:59] that we have more they may not be too
[34:03] much longer Lord that we have this kind
[34:04] of liturgy Lord it is all together
[34:06] together so Lord we ask that you would
[34:09] help us Lord in the midst of this time
[34:11] what God that we might be able to
[34:14] receive and Lord take hold of that word
[34:18] not as it would take hold of us yes we
[34:20] pray the Lord you would just have your
[34:22] way here Lord at this service Lord God I
[34:25] just desire to be hidden behind the
[34:27] cross the Lord you would be the one who
[34:30] would speak administer to the beats of
[34:32] your people tonight more yes Father you
[34:34] even know the words and how that they
[34:36] would need to be said Lord the father
[34:38] that it might be known that Lord that
[34:40] you are mine and that familiar the eyes
[34:43] of the Lord are searching to and fro
[34:45] Lord God and you're mindful at every
[34:47] need another children from an earlier
[34:49] yes the father you would just Lord move
[34:51] among us in a special way once again
[34:53] Lord in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[34:56] amen amen
[34:58] may God richly bless you being seated
[35:00] I'd like to just that if we could just
[35:04] continue with that thought of dedication
[35:07] raise God and truly we could just really
[35:10] continue to work with this salt all the
[35:13] way through because any any time there
[35:16] has ever been a move of God you always
[35:20] see that those who are part of that
[35:24] move it God brings them into the time
[35:29] and a life of dedication in that we've
[35:33] seen we're looking at that this morning
[35:35] that it takes God moving upon our lives
[35:37] and then there must be a counter
[35:40] response on our hearts it's just like in
[35:42] the scriptures when you think of how
[35:44] that there is not one place in the
[35:47] scriptures where it says wives love your
[35:50] husband's it does say in one place that
[35:52] they render due benevolence but you look
[35:55] in the scriptures and you'll find that
[35:56] how in Ephesians 5 you'll find it
[35:58] throughout the Scriptures read will say
[36:00] that husbands love your wives even as
[36:02] Christ loved the church and you
[36:04] recognize that where as Paul was drawing
[36:07] that type from that it's not our love
[36:10] that we love the Lord with but it's
[36:13] actually the love of God that has been
[36:15] projected and we as the counterpart the
[36:18] helpmate that that part which is come
[36:21] out of God it is to reflect back to him
[36:24] that same love that he has reflected and
[36:27] made known or manifested to us him as oh
[36:30] so the wife is a reflection of his love
[36:33] so the true bride of Jesus Christ in
[36:36] this hour is a reflection of the depth
[36:40] of God's love that moves to bring about
[36:43] a real change in our life in and so what
[36:46] that does is it brings it brings them
[36:49] the dedication that God is desiring and
[36:52] seeking for and how could that happen
[36:55] unless God himself moved upon our lives
[36:58] and there has to be a part to respond to
[37:01] what is calling for elder Davis said a
[37:03] deep call it to the D at the noise of
[37:06] non water spots there is already
[37:09] something to satisfy what the calling is
[37:13] before you could ever have a desire
[37:14] there must be something that is craving
[37:17] that that is there to satisfy that long
[37:20] amen
[37:21] that's the same thing it is even in our
[37:24] lives
[37:24] there is a thirst within the heart of
[37:26] every mortal person but yet within that
[37:30] of the elect of God and we don't look
[37:35] down on any that are not elected but we
[37:37] recognize there's a desire within us we
[37:40] are not contented with a church life is
[37:44] that something you can be content with
[37:45] and I know that there we can speak of
[37:47] others that perhaps you know I've known
[37:49] people that really even in other places
[37:52] that they don't really have a church
[37:54] life they live according to all that
[37:56] they they know and like brother BAM told
[37:59] us he said if the Catholic is trusting
[38:02] in Jesus Christ for his salvation you
[38:04] say right right leg but I say yes it's
[38:08] like in the type that where Abram went
[38:12] after lot he we know that lot was his
[38:15] nephew but the scripture says when he
[38:17] heard it he said lot his brother Abraham
[38:20] heard lot his brother was taken captive
[38:22] and in that heart lot was in that
[38:25] particular chapter was a type of the
[38:27] elect of God yes there are many others
[38:30] in Sodom that were taken captive right
[38:32] but Abram was not moved for the whole
[38:35] that was in chemistry for block email
[38:39] his kindred yeah but all of the rest
[38:41] that were identified and taken captive
[38:43] receive the benefit of Abram going and
[38:46] redemption its rise like the rest of
[38:48] this curve and many that are out they
[38:51] receive the benefits even you can
[38:54] testify or hear many better say God
[38:56] deliver me of this concept in
[38:58] pre-existing and they're on the right
[38:59] God has got ever again they have aniseed
[39:01] the benefits of God coming and
[39:04] redemption for his elect right so when
[39:08] we speak up out of the elect it is a
[39:11] great responsibility that we feel upon
[39:14] our hearts yes and it's something that
[39:17] we thought that God moves in our life
[39:20] that we are not able to feel just in a
[39:24] place of rest or come to complacency and
[39:27] that's something that we truly have to
[39:29] battle we would have to stand against
[39:32] but that word that living word
[39:34] comes forth it comes to stir us up it
[39:37] comes to direct us yeah it comes to
[39:39] breathe the freshness from the presence
[39:41] of God that we would stayed in the place
[39:44] and right on target yeah man I wasn't
[39:46] aimin so when we were looking at this
[39:49] tonight I want to just take just a few
[39:51] examples here in the scripture and
[39:52] really looking at this once again God of
[39:58] dedication but I want to look at it in a
[40:00] manner of how that God itself is
[40:03] committed to his word yes uh you know
[40:07] you how many times have got into
[40:08] projects that are way over our head but
[40:12] God has never got into something that's
[40:14] amen amen
[40:16] God knows exactly what he was doing and
[40:19] he knew God knew all of the background
[40:23] God even knew the the things that we
[40:26] would come through God even new scars
[40:28] marks got new all of those things yes
[40:31] yet even in the midst of it all how did
[40:33] that God was able to look down past all
[40:35] of that
[40:36] and is choosing is based on that of
[40:40] himself yes God's got confidence as we
[40:43] see we're looking at this morning his
[40:45] confidence is it his word yeah God comes
[40:48] to minister to that part of the other
[40:50] side which is of his rights of his
[40:53] genealogy so when we're looking at God
[40:57] being committed to his word then God
[40:59] comes to cultivate and bring forth that
[41:02] same dedication in the lives on his
[41:05] people so here when we're looking God
[41:08] has made a promise that he's going to
[41:10] visit Israel and God is faithful he did
[41:15] not overlook Israel's sin we know Israel
[41:17] is in the condition or a the place of
[41:19] Babylon yeah cause of their rebellion to
[41:23] the voice of God yes they they were they
[41:26] they still were going through the feast
[41:28] but yet God doesn't what things just
[41:30] going through the manner he wants a
[41:32] heart you know because the heart has in
[41:36] it God said you are representative of a
[41:39] place called Babylon so they were
[41:42] overtaken and now here dwelling in
[41:45] Babylon but he let of no
[41:47] I'm gonna visit you and I will perform
[41:50] my good word toward you that's right but
[41:53] as we you know you look at it even
[41:55] though it means 70 years God just didn't
[41:58] have you know his watch or his calendar
[41:59] and said 69 years old knives Rico's
[42:03] Mayas give no clothes here but the
[42:05] conditions the 70 years he would deliver
[42:08] but there must also be conditions that
[42:11] are met at that time yes a man he must
[42:14] be in a desperation and it's not just a
[42:17] desperation to I want to be free of this
[42:20] Babylonian oppression it wasn't just
[42:22] that because people can want to be freed
[42:25] and you know people say I don't want
[42:27] this drug addiction I don't want this I
[42:29] don't want that and that in itself is is
[42:33] a good thing you can look at it well
[42:34] that's hindering a life it's true but
[42:36] that's not that's not serving God that's
[42:39] not what you get you and I said of it
[42:43] you but when it must come which God is
[42:46] calling for here is where their heart
[42:48] begins to long after that seek out her
[42:52] but everywhere else it goes around
[42:55] our life with things that could still
[42:57] beat we said it sends all those things
[42:59] it is to seek after God and falling
[43:02] deeper in love with the Lord and as you
[43:05] know deeper in love with the Lord did
[43:08] you find the strength that you need
[43:09] because the stress is needed and that
[43:13] strength works in your life to perform
[43:16] the word that he's already Amen glory
[43:19] he's always looking at things as though
[43:21] that I'm going to get rid of this I'm
[43:23] going to get rid of that I'm gonna get
[43:24] rid of that it's falling in love with
[43:25] you yeah man we fall in love with him
[43:28] it's more and more and you realize our
[43:30] faith increases yes you realize that
[43:33] yeah we've seen that even in Abraham's
[43:35] life this journey his faith caught
[43:38] always knew the faith that was within
[43:41] Abram because Abraham is of God yes it's
[43:44] alright yes God already knew that you
[43:47] and I fall along in the chapter and
[43:49] we're we're seeing Abraham progressed
[43:51] within his life and yet God already seen
[43:53] that but call out circumstances and
[43:56] conditions call allow all that even
[43:59] where God I mean how
[44:00] of us when we would someone when we
[44:03] would sell something to somebody and
[44:04] they laugh they would smirk at what
[44:07] you're saying
[44:08] Abraham did that to God that's right
[44:10] right sir not just in the early chapters
[44:12] in the very scriptures before the
[44:16] visitation of Genesis 18 right you're
[44:19] going to have a child by self the Bible
[44:22] said Abraham laughter you see yeah we're
[44:27] looking at it God is not in any way
[44:30] coming back and saying my arrack why are
[44:34] you laughing if it is o God withdraw
[44:36] back we know God brings correction but
[44:38] yet God is faithful to his word and God
[44:41] many times where we get in trouble we
[44:44] look at everything else around sometimes
[44:47] we can see the faults we can see
[44:49] failures we can see false we can see all
[44:51] the other things but God is looking
[44:54] deeper than that that's not saying that
[44:55] that we can don't know say what I'm
[44:57] saying is it that we get focused upon
[45:00] all of that instead of recognizing the
[45:02] source that we have accessed and that
[45:06] sauce is the grace of God yeah Holy
[45:09] Spirit is the blood as well
[45:11] we are access to to be able to overcome
[45:14] and prevail against those things yeah so
[45:17] that's where when we're looking at it
[45:20] within here even in the scriptures we
[45:24] see how that God would move even in the
[45:28] midst of things for that of Abraham and
[45:30] in Abraham's life and here with among
[45:33] the children of Israel you know when you
[45:35] think of it if I could just just for a
[45:39] few moments before we would go and go
[45:41] onto that a little bit you think of how
[45:43] that God spoke to Noah the scriptures we
[45:46] can read we read just the one Scripture
[45:48] in Hebrews 11 that if I faith Noah being
[45:51] warned of God of things not yet seen as
[45:54] yet moved with fear prepared an ark to
[45:56] the saving of the house by the which he
[45:58] condemned the world and became heir of
[46:00] the righteousness which is by faith we
[46:04] even in reading in the account in Noah's
[46:07] life we do not read in there any
[46:11] discouragement yes
[46:14] but there were yes sir we don't read in
[46:18] that account in Noah's part of a times
[46:22] where you were trying to make something
[46:24] fit and it didn't fit
[46:25] we don't read that but yet we know that
[46:28] there were times I'll presume it yes we
[46:33] know it I say how can you know that
[46:34] because that is a characteristic God
[46:36] never
[46:37] God has never tried to hide humanity
[46:40] right but God makes himself known by
[46:43] where you call people to just like
[46:45] Abraham and Sarah it would have seemed
[46:47] like that God if you're wanting a child
[46:49] a comforter you'll call people that can
[46:52] produce one right right but God does not
[46:55] work that way God moves to declare
[46:59] himself by calling and ordaining that
[47:02] which his seeming so contrary to what
[47:06] he's decided he has proved himself yeah
[47:10] you see this is where if come
[47:12] interceptors of your mobile you can look
[47:14] at the word itself and you can even see
[47:16] you recognize by way with them when your
[47:19] nature it's change them and satisfy that
[47:21] in prayer there is a there's a landing
[47:24] up of the Word of God yet you find the
[47:26] word your flesh your your other part
[47:28] should be stunned by that word that's
[47:31] where God told Joshua be strong and of
[47:34] the curse to observe all that Moses is
[47:37] said why because this message is Pope
[47:40] yes sir yes sir
[47:42] yeah it's a life-changing message that
[47:44] it is yeah your body changing message it
[47:47] has the full page yes
[47:51] it's not going to be something that the
[47:53] flesh was always going to go along with
[47:55] ride a the inner man and that is who has
[47:59] been born of the Spirit of God in that
[48:01] Internet is feeding on that word and
[48:03] that inner man is bringing the outer man
[48:05] its objective or itself taking over our
[48:10] lives where it is having preeminence
[48:13] it's not just knowledge it's the little
[48:16] person of Jesus Christ by
[48:18] I don't know it's guys taking over life
[48:21] that's the adoption lujah its Christ and
[48:25] self-rule within us
[48:26] hallelujah moving in us yeah running out
[48:30] on us where he would direct you at the
[48:33] right time just like with Caleb it was
[48:35] not Joshua as a kid waiting you think
[48:38] right now is about time that you go take
[48:39] the mountain I know that was God yeah
[48:42] yes sir man hey hey what told him this
[48:45] was the time the Spirit of God he had to
[48:47] my lawyer
[48:48] you recognize this is the time to take
[48:50] my mountain yes Hey same thing within
[48:54] our lives the Spirit of God inspiring
[48:57] you and I what is that that's God's
[48:58] dedication to his work
[48:59] I'll make sure is he lit culture yes he
[49:04] then becomes been working you shall
[49:05] perform it unto the day of Jesus right
[49:07] that is dedication
[49:09] I literally yeah so God Himself is drawn
[49:13] to dedication we see that but Noah knows
[49:17] North dedication was that his heart here
[49:21] here fine found favor with God
[49:23] his dedication was to what God had
[49:26] revealed a man no doubt there were times
[49:30] that you know I had to get down on his
[49:31] knees he's praying God how do I make
[49:34] these pieces come together yeah
[49:36] yes but you see here's the difference
[49:39] being a believer does not mean that we
[49:42] have all the answers right it means we
[49:44] have access to the answer yeah mix the
[49:48] situations where we don't know what to
[49:50] do we know we can go to him literally
[49:53] yeah I mean no he met him yes and no was
[49:56] resting in him even when it came time to
[50:00] the final parts were after the flood
[50:04] come and and here they are in the window
[50:07] you see the scriptures don't tell us
[50:08] this but the Prophet picks it up and the
[50:11] Prophet tells us that the window that
[50:12] God had naught to make this Satan gotten
[50:16] got in a window and begin speaking down
[50:19] through the window and calling Noah okay
[50:21] you can get out now
[50:22] I don't know rain has come but he did
[50:24] your opportunity yeah right I see that
[50:27] that was not for Satan see Satan was
[50:30] trying to come through that access but
[50:31] that
[50:31] this was actually reserved for when God
[50:33] would confirm his word yeah I was not
[50:36] able to confirm the end of the flood in
[50:38] the first level right the second stage
[50:41] right what a second pool God was going
[50:43] to confirm it in the third Hey it was
[50:46] not a secret
[50:47] coming right right you see the clap in
[50:50] the third he opened the window as he
[50:53] over the window to two or two fouls were
[50:55] sent out right right Dalton you have got
[50:57] the crow yes right the crow found rest
[51:01] right y'all found no rest they don't
[51:04] return then did you find here Noah sends
[51:08] out again you know after after seven
[51:10] days the dump goes up gets guess I would
[51:13] Lee comes back and what does going do
[51:16] wait seven more days who told no other
[51:18] way except more days you don't read the
[51:20] scriptures where it says God's told
[51:22] North Norway seven more days but see God
[51:24] knows how to speak to your heart into
[51:26] your life to where the things that what
[51:28] he does becomes a pattern not a
[51:31] self-made pattern gets a pattern of his
[51:33] spirit in his life is character so what
[51:36] Noah knew there was seven days we were
[51:38] here waiting for the blood so here are
[51:39] coming back seven days and we'll walk
[51:41] out was it in hey we'll make knowledge
[51:47] in you God was faithful to where were no
[51:50] other than this our God was going to let
[51:53] him know but it's time to walk out yes I
[51:55] let you and I know everything
[52:00] Lord so when we look at this you see
[52:04] even without us in Abraham's life you
[52:07] see remember with with with with in
[52:10] where God had made a promise that Sarah
[52:14] or the Sarah she has an idea to take
[52:21] Hagar the the bond the bond woman take
[52:25] her and prevent your God is going to
[52:28] give child by weave her see that's her
[52:31] idea right and Sarah's dedicated to it
[52:34] she's dedicated to it even though it
[52:38] would go against something
[52:40] she what but she's dedicated to it but
[52:43] he was self dedication right right that
[52:45] was not what God wanted her to be
[52:47] dedicated amen the Bible even goes on to
[52:50] say how that Sara herself through faith
[52:53] that's right amen
[52:56] yes Sabbath don't received strength to
[52:59] conceive outside of a messenger that's
[53:03] right I'm talking about the earthly man
[53:05] I'm talking about the message to the
[53:06] Holy Spirit coming yeah okay let's he
[53:11] said it wasn't so straight
[53:13] it was Abraham Smith so how did it
[53:16] because we know that it could just be
[53:17] Sarah riding in and bringing conception
[53:20] upon Abraham's faith but there had to be
[53:23] that faith had to move down and become
[53:26] resolute within Sarah's life Hey but the
[53:30] ministry that God had ordained in that
[53:32] time that the the the God Himself came
[53:36] down and visit with Ava they never went
[53:38] LW never went down pass off that's right
[53:40] right yes hey special that's why you
[53:44] know when brother battle with dresses in
[53:46] his foot spiritual food new season and
[53:48] run around was saying you know remember
[53:50] he was told many times what did he
[53:52] bother nurse sinners why don't you take
[53:53] this off the nursery
[53:54] the mess is not for them right it's not
[53:57] that we don't want to witness we do all
[53:58] of it but recognizing is the public say
[54:01] it's not fair food it would make them
[54:03] sick I do believe God opened the door
[54:06] for me to go and stand and minister in a
[54:09] church that's not a message trip uh you
[54:12] know and I'd say this by God's grace I
[54:14] don't need to read quotes to preach the
[54:16] Word of God that's right right I do it
[54:18] yes you do it for Sarah amen but man I'm
[54:23] not proud reaching right from a quote I
[54:25] miss not quoting it the same time right
[54:27] right because the you
[54:29] the message is Christ it's a living
[54:31] person yes a picture of Jesus Christ
[54:34] it makes the Bible alive amen
[54:39] so able to orchestrate to where the
[54:42] people God could move and speak to
[54:45] things that they believe in the
[54:47] scripture but he can make it
[54:48] real to them that would cause them to
[54:50] seek after you yes yes amen god knows
[54:54] what he's doing so when we see this that
[54:57] we know it's not that we're not the
[54:59] witness we are the witness if God gives
[55:01] an opportunity I have many many times of
[55:03] the many funerals where there have been
[55:05] some times who knows where there were
[55:07] people that never ever said in the
[55:08] church never and I didn't have been a
[55:12] good bedside pray for them and all they
[55:13] could do is squeeze my hand at the end
[55:15] of the way you said for the signer you
[55:17] creature Shin sure I take the
[55:18] opportunity because I can talk about the
[55:20] Lord Jesus to all those people that's
[55:22] right and I would I would speak of the
[55:24] Lord Jesus Christ and the certainty that
[55:25] we have in him uncertainty of this life
[55:27] but certainly we have in him yeah yeah
[55:30] any to speak to someone to minister to
[55:33] them a concerning the Lord Jesus right
[55:36] I believe God will lead it guys because
[55:38] I'm out of jacket as believing we
[55:40] understand the wire and God is open to
[55:43] us we understand the responsibility that
[55:46] sometimes it's not for us to give up the
[55:49] cannon that's right it's simply the
[55:51] sweetness and the light that's lived at
[55:54] you melody and the sincerity that comes
[55:56] forth to people that people begin to see
[55:58] a man in real amen see they heard all
[56:03] this all of the those things that Jesus
[56:06] was reading from the scroll but they
[56:08] said never man spake like this I'm
[56:10] different they have heard and read it
[56:13] but this was something there Sheriff
[56:16] received that thing God so move in her
[56:19] life to bring her to that place to open
[56:21] beyond self dedication when we look at
[56:26] this just here just for a moment when
[56:31] you see how God is moving you find
[56:33] within this return from Babylon God
[56:38] moves and Junction's of time there are
[56:43] people that are allotted for each
[56:45] station the first thing is to come back
[56:49] and build a temple that's amazing yes
[56:52] God has people that are our date for
[56:54] that yes then after that here they have
[56:57] the coming forth with the
[57:01] the law of God the priest of God coming
[57:04] for God knows when to breathe air
[57:06] yes then you find it after that this is
[57:09] coming then it comes that time to
[57:11] strengthen the build up the walls God
[57:13] his people that's wording for them amen
[57:15] so he can't God everything is in his
[57:19] time and in his season we see that yes
[57:22] and God you know when you're looking at
[57:24] it you find how that even in the book of
[57:27] Ezra Ezra chapter one well refer from
[57:29] you'll find that how that when God
[57:31] anoints silence and Cyrus
[57:34] catches the inspiration God has spoken
[57:37] concerning Cyrus but the inspiration
[57:39] falls upon Cyrus and Cyrus himself not a
[57:42] believer right yet the inspiration fall
[57:45] and he speaks to the people of God and I
[57:48] want you to catch this the people of God
[57:50] did not look and say who are you you're
[57:54] not even a believer right right they
[57:57] they recognized this is what God has
[57:59] said my shepherd
[58:01] that's what he called Cyrus mine
[58:03] anointing my shepherd you know he also
[58:05] called never Knesset my servant that's
[58:08] right that's right
[58:09] right - in the hand of God yeah puppet
[58:12] said they're always raving about
[58:13] communism you see it's a tool in the
[58:15] hand of God amen so you look at
[58:17] different ones figures throughout the
[58:19] world it seem like they're becoming
[58:21] involved what is it tools in the head of
[58:23] God
[58:23] yeah that's allowing them to become
[58:25] involved for this time
[58:27] so here the Lord stirs up the spirit of
[58:31] silence and sounder speaks to them and
[58:34] and how that it sounds you know even
[58:37] mentioned them who is there among you of
[58:39] all his people his God be with him let
[58:41] him go up to Jerusalem which is the
[58:43] Judea and build the house of the Lord
[58:45] God of Israel he is the God which is in
[58:47] Jerusalem and you find that how that
[58:51] there are people that roast up in verse
[58:53] five is that there are people Ezra 1:5
[58:56] that rose up chief of the fathers of
[58:58] Judah and Benjamin and the priests and
[59:00] the Levites with all them whose spirit
[59:03] God had written yeah you know what to
[59:06] build the house of the Lord which is in
[59:08] Jerusalem behind that same pattern over
[59:13] in
[59:15] since 35 where we were coming from this
[59:18] morning after God the atonement has been
[59:21] made and he's moving the people along
[59:23] and Moses has the assurance that the
[59:26] presence of the Lord will cool I will go
[59:29] before you and hear then Moses in Exodus
[59:32] 35 begins to speak of the vision before
[59:36] to the people yes even though the vision
[59:40] was of God everything had to get in his
[59:43] proper place
[59:44] Lydia it's just like when you look at it
[59:46] and you think of how that God in this
[59:48] hour to bring up people by God's grace
[59:52] of where we are by His grace that God
[59:55] would have a vessel that was reserved to
[59:58] catch the inspiration eyes of God above
[1:00:01] the earth to catch in this hour the
[1:00:04] revelation of Jesus Christ amen
[1:00:06] then just speak and transmit that and we
[1:00:08] can say that we do have the perfect
[1:00:10] interpretation of the Word of God
[1:00:12] yes but yet because the side was not
[1:00:15] just going to be recorded on tape oh
[1:00:18] yeah to become material hey yes just
[1:00:23] because the message itself when we look
[1:00:26] at the message and we call the books it
[1:00:27] takes the message and we say we had the
[1:00:29] perfect interpretation of the Word of
[1:00:30] God but that's not the achievement of
[1:00:32] God lies that word being interpreted
[1:00:35] through us a man yeah yeah but isn't
[1:00:38] this prophecy through Jeremiah he spoke
[1:00:40] this prophecy here and what is the
[1:00:43] interpretation of it is this word having
[1:00:45] an impact what your glory coming back to
[1:00:50] Jerusalem is Jeremiah's prophecy weight
[1:00:54] was moved by this beautiful yeah seeing
[1:00:56] the interpretation of hey it's cause
[1:00:58] breaking forth his word in his season
[1:01:01] linaria it's just like when you take for
[1:01:04] example when the RAM is is is dealing
[1:01:07] with the seals and it's administering on
[1:01:09] the seagulls remember how it says I want
[1:01:12] questions that are dealing with the
[1:01:13] seals yeah I want questions what does he
[1:01:15] get rajamma questions should we wear
[1:01:18] pajamas should we do this related what
[1:01:19] are the people are in a sanctification
[1:01:20] mode yes no no that's not a balloon and
[1:01:23] is suing where the people were act all
[1:01:26] right brother
[1:01:27] that was a type of the tabernacle by the
[1:01:28] mount they were back in sanctification
[1:01:31] go you can speak the different ones over
[1:01:33] there they said we recognize something
[1:01:35] great is happily oh it wasn't that it
[1:01:39] bypass God had things reserved for a
[1:01:42] time yes it's in God's hands when all
[1:01:46] these things come into order but it must
[1:01:48] first be spoken and declared that if it
[1:01:52] stays back here and it just be seized at
[1:01:54] just a message by a prophet that right
[1:01:57] there people can still perish yes sir it
[1:01:59] must be vision that breaks in the hearts
[1:02:02] of people
[1:02:02] litora otherwise it just becomes for the
[1:02:05] ground of the message conscience for the
[1:02:07] ground across to the public you could
[1:02:10] get in before on that but you can't get
[1:02:11] in on that
[1:02:15] okay thanks quickly so when they're
[1:02:18] looking at me you must see you are
[1:02:20] caught in the vision a little bit
[1:02:23] already can say Daniel 70 weeks this
[1:02:25] message has a power and a vision behind
[1:02:28] it it's a way sent from God to get the
[1:02:31] church in order mark in the vision glory
[1:02:37] I know it sometimes it's pretty surreal
[1:02:39] you're in your scene right nor the
[1:02:42] things that you're showing you should
[1:02:43] meet me and you almost like want to
[1:02:45] pinch yourself and but you what it is
[1:02:47] it's gone making you aware of who you
[1:02:50] really are
[1:02:51] yeah yeah all these things about you as
[1:02:56] far as the part thereof the flesh I
[1:02:58] could have changed your flesh when he
[1:03:00] gave it all he goes right here
[1:03:02] he magnifies and declares his victory by
[1:03:05] changing your nature yeah shines after
[1:03:08] your life but your son's daughter God
[1:03:10] and hearing manthis you strongly for
[1:03:13] your life and you stand victorious
[1:03:15] in the midst of a fleshly party is glory
[1:03:21] amen so when you find out how God is its
[1:03:26] people might say I don't know where time
[1:03:28] go sometimes you seem like you just get
[1:03:30] seemed like it's time to sing stared at
[1:03:32] and I stole mine so let me just let me
[1:03:35] just hurry here you're going to stir
[1:03:37] them up then you're at glory and I stood
[1:03:40] here building you know it would seem
[1:03:42] like my everything is going right for
[1:03:43] them and it does seem like my
[1:03:45] everything's going for them but remember
[1:03:46] when they lay the foundation the Bible
[1:03:48] says that their adversaries heard about
[1:03:50] it
[1:03:51] our the adversaries heard they came and
[1:03:53] begin to trouble right the - as they
[1:03:56] sought to frustrate their purpose yes
[1:03:59] that word frustrate me break they hired
[1:04:02] counselors try against them they they
[1:04:06] begin to bring accusation and you find
[1:04:09] that that accusation worked or where
[1:04:11] they wrote letters to the King and they
[1:04:13] begin to make also accusation concerning
[1:04:15] them saying their rebellious city
[1:04:16] rebellious people and these false
[1:04:18] accusations caused a king that was in

[1:04:34] laid the foundation but that's it for 15
[1:04:37] years and yet they've been commissioned
[1:04:39] by God what's God's dedication to his

[1:05:49] with it's like the wind were taking
[1:05:52] other cells of those accusations they

[1:06:21] you're feeling bad and it's bags for
[1:06:23] holes in yes sir yes make was that me
[1:06:25] why would God do that
[1:06:42] in our life there's a poet tells us of
[1:06:45] why you know Bethlehem the practice of
[1:06:47] God is that we'd be terminated and then
[1:06:50] we have the churn of Christ old life
[1:06:53] inside of a holiday international berry
[1:06:59] fruit of his life glory amen
[1:07:02] and I got to a spot in her life she was
[1:07:05] already married
[1:07:06] yeah she was united with open her
[1:07:08] husband but she got to a place she says
[1:07:11] I want to bear his image you know a real
[1:07:16] manifestation receiving life right the
[1:07:21] light wasn't taking hold
[1:07:22] she was united with with alcohol but
[1:07:25] here it moved the desperation wasn't
[1:07:27] just enough to be United
[1:07:29] she said I'm out there I want to she
[1:07:32] doesn't say all to bear a child she said
[1:07:34] I want to bear a son
[1:07:35] where was that coming from her the mind
[1:07:38] of God
[1:07:39] he was going to give her son but he just
[1:07:42] been give her son she had decided what
[1:07:52] God designed for are you the new the
[1:08:00] head up will have records and respect so
[1:08:02] we gave her a special son Laurie amen oh
[1:08:06] oh
[1:08:08] Mugen gamin so how that that God moves
[1:08:12] on negative calls the people to consider
[1:08:16] their ways and you not so know you know
[1:08:18] God just didn't say you know three hey
[1:08:21] guy um you know just you know this is
[1:08:24] the stuff what you're doing but he lets
[1:08:25] them know you have become so occupied
[1:08:27] with this but you need to go to the
[1:08:29] mountain you need to get the wood you
[1:08:31] need to bring it on down and you need to
[1:08:34] build the house of God
[1:08:37] yes yeah so he's calling them reminding
[1:08:40] them of their purpose and you know it
[1:08:43] stirs up because their language among
[1:08:47] the people and that time had come to a
[1:08:48] place to where they were beginning to
[1:08:52] say this is not the time for the house
[1:08:54] of God right brother right they have
[1:08:57] become discouraged yes all the
[1:09:00] accusations lining up it becomes a skirt
[1:09:03] see the word itself when it comes it
[1:09:07] comes to suffering you from you the word
[1:09:10] itself as your abiding and living in the
[1:09:12] word and looking to the Lord it's that
[1:09:15] which gives you prevailing power to
[1:09:18] dismiss accusations
[1:09:19] nay mad because the devil is the accuser
[1:09:23] of the brother yes is this atmospheres
[1:09:25] are contaminated with Devon right and oh
[1:09:29] yes point out your failures and your
[1:09:31] mistake as you begin to look at all of
[1:09:33] that and become consumed with it it puts
[1:09:37] you in a place of evil Billa yeah
[1:09:38] nothing yeah you're not right I'm not
[1:09:41] just moving here you're not you do wanna
[1:09:43] be a man your receptors aren't up to
[1:09:45] where they ought to be yes girls is a
[1:09:47] cloud yes but we
[1:09:49] when you can recognize the strength of
[1:09:52] the atonement and you're recognizing the
[1:09:55] real you by knowing that designer of
[1:09:57] that clock has raised up on the inside
[1:09:59] and you're able to stand there and say I
[1:10:02] know you're able to stand there and
[1:10:09] bring that discernment and being able or
[1:10:13] ask down literally free happy thank you
[1:10:16] smiles imagination everything that
[1:10:19] raises up against the knowledge of
[1:10:21] Christ hallelujah see this is where for
[1:10:24] the battle you would admonish us even by
[1:10:29] way of the scripture where the scripture
[1:10:31] said seek you first the kingdom of God
[1:10:33] and then all these other things will be
[1:10:35] added unto you yes I believe it behooves
[1:10:40] us to look at even in checking in our
[1:10:43] lives because there are things all all
[1:10:48] around but you try to get the attention
[1:10:51] try to bring distractions yes but in all
[1:10:54] things the principle is not you know
[1:10:57] it's like suppose we're we're in the
[1:10:59] interview get hit somebody and they get
[1:11:01] so tangled up financially right rather
[1:11:03] right on and they might even want to be
[1:11:05] doing something no real good principles
[1:11:07] oh I know this God's principle and I
[1:11:08] want to do this on a day but God will
[1:11:10] not have to obey those principles and
[1:11:12] disobey those right amen come on yo man
[1:11:16] so the word is to all the work Alleluia
[1:11:19] when the Bible says seek ye first the
[1:11:21] kingdom of God and His righteousness and
[1:11:23] then all these other things will be
[1:11:25] added unto yeah that's beautiful
[1:11:28] beautiful I'll tell your friends you
[1:11:29] know I'm not just I'm not talking to
[1:11:31] your textbook knowledge and once
[1:11:34] yeah I'm awareness of what after you

[1:11:50] up on anybody else but I'm just saying
[1:11:52] that I know what God is able to do
[1:11:54] sometimes we limit God yes amen
[1:11:58] yeah look at this you know you you can
[1:12:02] limit God but God is unlimited yes
[1:12:08] you know brother Justin over talking
[1:12:10] here is literally my used to have all

[1:12:31] wasn't able to stay up like that and
[1:12:32] studying and everything I wanted to and
[1:12:35] you know he gave me some real powerful
[1:12:37] words always been very short you're
[1:12:38] getting old getting older but it's true
[1:12:44] we do get older we don't we don't have
[1:12:47] maybe the salmon and the strength and
[1:12:49] we're trying to do everything we can but
[1:12:50] our vessels would be a presented unto
[1:12:52] the Lord as yet we recognize that within
[1:12:54] at all but there is times that I want to
[1:12:56] get on preach on that but there times
[1:12:58] that God doesn't want to stress yes yeah
[1:13:00] I'm a man back in here gasps gonna pass
[1:13:04] out a road you got you you've been
[1:13:05] talking about Rizzoli's there's people
[1:13:07] that need to be saint there's people
[1:13:08] that need to be come with the Holy Ghost
[1:13:09] how can you go out fishing real ramps
[1:13:11] that I've come to the place I realize
[1:13:12] she said that everybody this ruler on
[1:13:14] the look of yeah lover yeah Laury Laury
[1:13:27] but that's where the brand will make a
[1:13:30] steam out I'll always love that
[1:13:31] statement right I found it to be true
[1:13:34] I've seen to be true my mom says you
[1:13:37] show me a man or woman gotta put God
[1:13:40] first
[1:13:40] yes he said how show you a person that
[1:13:44] will come out on top
[1:13:45] no matter what the devil's oh yeah sorry
[1:13:50] hey man it goes why first yes it's gone
[1:13:54] first glory and when we when you look in
[1:13:57] through this here let me just try to
[1:13:59] just wrap this up here in when you find
[1:14:02] it
[1:14:02] how's it hanging on your God's
[1:14:04] dedication this is why once you see
[1:14:06] God's dedication because you and I are
[1:14:09] God are
[1:14:11] this workmanship created ordained unto
[1:14:15] good works therefore gain in Christ
[1:14:18] Jesus Gras is faithful to supply all
[1:14:22] that we have neato
[1:14:23] oh yeah he's faithful to it and so when
[1:14:26] you find that how within this 15 years
[1:14:29] there's no movement going on the people
[1:14:31] have become disheartened the time has
[1:14:32] not come let me get to speak extinct so
[1:14:34] God sends a word that whereby that they
[1:14:38] would begin to really align and speak
[1:14:40] with what the purpose that God already
[1:14:42] had for their life the Bible says after
[1:14:44] that heavy I and the prophets in as our
[1:14:49] five they were speaking to them the
[1:14:51] Bible says after they were done speaking
[1:14:54] minerals of zerubbabel the son of
[1:14:56] shealtiel and just sure the son of
[1:14:57] josedech and begin to build the house of
[1:14:59] God which is at Jerusalem and with them
[1:15:01] were the prophets of God helping them
[1:15:05] I'm so glad the larrya provides the help
[1:15:08] we have neither yeah I'm glad God as
[1:15:11] vessels that are ordained to minister
[1:15:14] that word and get out of the way that
[1:15:16] can really get down to God to come down
[1:15:18] and speak to our lives and make things
[1:15:19] real preciate left it spots dedications
[1:15:23] God having a ministry God never remove
[1:15:26] the ministry cuts
[1:15:27] God having a ministry in Scotts
[1:15:29] dedication yes dedication to what to his
[1:15:32] word
[1:15:33] nothing area he knows hey what I
[1:15:35] wouldn't need that and it's God coming
[1:15:38] through the varieties of his officers to
[1:15:41] minister to our nice little area
[1:15:43] God knew we just didn't need all the
[1:15:45] badges we didn't need all pastors use
[1:15:47] all teachers but all parts of it had to
[1:15:50] come together yes
[1:15:52] hey mom I what you know Lord my I'd say
[1:15:55] we can really deal with that in humility
[1:15:56] that I tell you what God is so dedicated
[1:15:59] at yeah I know where the scripture says
[1:16:02] in Ezra PI aware that here the the Word
[1:16:08] of God was having an effect in their
[1:16:10] life and yet these people that came up
[1:16:12] in verse 3 of this refined and partly if
[1:16:14] I don't say the names correctly and says
[1:16:16] at the same time came to them 10 tonight
[1:16:18] governor on this side of the Jordan and
[1:16:20] and set for the Sarlacc and
[1:16:22] companions and send us unto them who
[1:16:24] have commended you to build this house
[1:16:26] in the make up the swamp then I said we
[1:16:29] under man after this matter what are the
[1:16:30] names of the men that make this building
[1:16:34] what the high look at this now but the
[1:16:38] eye of their God was upon the elders of
[1:16:39] the Jews that they could not cause them
[1:16:42] to cease till the matter came to Darius
[1:16:45] name and then they returned by letter
[1:16:47] concerning this matter
[1:16:48] the king that was in between those were
[1:16:52] in between in the 15 years yes they
[1:16:54] didn't recognize because there was one
[1:16:56] who by edict of Cyrus but that had been
[1:17:00] lost what accusations had had caused the
[1:17:05] Kings in here to just focus on the
[1:17:07] accusations instead of going back to the
[1:17:09] original document that's right but then
[1:17:12] after year the focus was put back to the
[1:17:14] original document which gave them the
[1:17:16] authority to field hey man a man don't
[1:17:20] give the focus in this hour to come back
[1:17:23] yeah your name questions asking
[1:17:33] questions yes and we could say verse 3
[1:17:36] in verse 4 they had their blog post
[1:17:37] there were their YouTube video and
[1:17:39] asking questions but happy are you right
[1:17:41] you see the service when you look at in
[1:17:44] the New Testament ah you know just to
[1:17:47] study out of some things that I've done
[1:17:48] when you look at how many times is the
[1:17:50] Lord Jesus the Bible says that they
[1:17:52] pressed upon him to him yeah he would
[1:17:54] say something they ask questions yes but
[1:17:58] how many times of Jesus answering very
[1:18:02] very very few yes sir
[1:18:04] very few yes sir Jesus and many of the
[1:18:06] times he caught the spirit and he walked
[1:18:08] away you know what you were going to
[1:18:10] help ma they were asking questions you
[1:18:13] don't find in this scripture where they
[1:18:15] turn around and answer them
[1:18:16] ah right hope you understand what I'm
[1:18:19] saying
[1:18:20] yes sometimes those questions is just to
[1:18:22] try to breathe back into places that
[1:18:24] God's already brought you food yeah
[1:18:26] that's different if I'm witnessing to
[1:18:28] somebody here then I'm opening showing
[1:18:30] them behind way of the Lord how God
[1:18:32] sends a messenger in this hour but to
[1:18:34] among the people of God are
[1:18:36] not proving their programs a messenger
[1:18:41] rock words trust indicated that yeah
[1:18:44] there's anything you're walking yeah
[1:18:46] amen but it's questions and you fine
[1:18:49] yeah they were to ask look you say focus
[1:18:52] on your what's the harm in answering
[1:18:53] that question they would stop working
[1:18:55] yes you see sometimes the things that
[1:18:58] are put out or and work to try to stop
[1:19:00] working it would to try to be to
[1:19:02] distract yeah I can try to distract and
[1:19:05] say well you know you need to answer
[1:19:06] questions you need to try to help them
[1:19:07] you know train that's a great
[1:19:09] philanthropist way to look at it and you
[1:19:11] know but the reality is is you've got
[1:19:13] tried to discern you focus upon that
[1:19:15] what about that's right really right
[1:19:18] understand yeah we are game my god this
[1:19:22] word self he is moving by divine
[1:19:25] revelation to produce a rapture a mass
[1:19:28] it's got dedicated to his word it's God
[1:19:31] in this moment and in this hour we're
[1:19:33] not we're not set it to argue the word
[1:19:35] we're not set to try to prove the word
[1:19:37] we're believers
[1:19:37] yeah a is so when we see it the eye of
[1:19:42] God the Bible says was upon them they
[1:19:45] couldn't cause him to stop the eye of
[1:19:47] God was Christ Christ was ass back where
[1:19:50] is worth in their life and then you find
[1:19:53] let me just let me do the wrap around
[1:19:55] wrap this up for you you find here in in
[1:19:58] the scripture when when Ezra leaves I
[1:20:03] believe in Azra 7 when Ezra leaves
[1:20:08] Babylon the King has given commandment
[1:20:13] concerning those things which are to be
[1:20:16] done to beautify the house of God they
[1:20:21] are given an off they're given that
[1:20:24] which is needed of gold of silver and
[1:20:27] the King has said anything else that you
[1:20:30] need yes he wrote in the letter give to
[1:20:36] them whatever they have neither what is
[1:20:39] it it's an hour of fullness
[1:20:41] yes it's an hour because what is it
[1:20:44] God is dedicated
[1:20:47] to his word today we are finishing up to
[1:20:51] the fulfilling of all things what is
[1:20:53] needed
[1:20:54] God is not sparing it like it save this
[1:20:56] way no expenses yeah
[1:20:58] lelou yeah this hours not a portion of
[1:21:01] him it's the fullness prioritize dealing
[1:21:08] with an art by the way of the word yes
[1:21:11] and here you find something a a great
[1:21:15] precious time where we come into in our
[1:21:18] own lives to wear that here in Ezra
[1:21:23] eight they walk out and they have all of
[1:21:25] this substance and when they come out
[1:21:27] with all this substance in Ezra eight
[1:21:29] years as right this is a tight as was
[1:21:31] returning the temple has has already
[1:21:33] been built
[1:21:34] yeah now it's time to have how that
[1:21:36] leadership in that direction coming back
[1:21:38] in they're going to come and they're
[1:21:39] going to teach the law of Moses and
[1:21:41] Janet equal but the Bible said calls him
[1:21:43] to understand yeah what is written
[1:21:46] therein then you find that Ezra in
[1:21:49] himself in verse 21 of Ezra eight
[1:21:53] can I just read this yes let me just
[1:21:56] read it you're just just real quick
[1:21:58] glory in 21 they come to a place by the
[1:22:01] river they've left out of Babylon Ezra
[1:22:04] and the chief fathers that are with him
[1:22:06] he says then I proclaimed a fast there
[1:22:09] at the river out of which that we might
[1:22:12] afflict ourselves before I've got to
[1:22:16] seek Him him a right way for us and for
[1:22:18] our little ones and for all our subdued
[1:22:21] offense beautiful for I was ashamed to
[1:22:24] require of the king
[1:22:26] a band of soldiers and horsemen to help
[1:22:29] us against the enemy in the way because
[1:22:31] we had spoken unto the king saying the
[1:22:32] hand of our God is upon all them for
[1:22:34] good that seek him but his power and his
[1:22:36] wrath is it gets all them that
[1:22:38] proceeding so we fasted and insult our
[1:22:42] God for this and he was entreated man
[1:22:46] but is it God's dedication to his word
[1:22:50] yes Ezra and then recognize there's
[1:22:54] enemies ahead of us we're carrying all
[1:22:55] this substance all this gold all the
[1:22:58] silver how are we going to get it back
[1:23:01] Jerusalem but he stopped that he says
[1:23:03] Lord shows the way how should we go
[1:23:06] about this yes and they fasted yes
[1:23:11] how am i fasting is a very precious
[1:23:14] thing to the people of God
[1:23:15] yes there's times where you have God is
[1:23:18] draw it draws you in in a fast there's
[1:23:21] times where you move fast you're trying
[1:23:23] to find an answer trying to find a
[1:23:25] little eating of the Lord looking to God
[1:23:27] and this is the thing that you can take
[1:23:30] from here you find in many other places
[1:23:32] in the scripture God is drawn to
[1:23:35] dedication I mean it just moves God hey
[1:23:39] when people are dedicated in the time of
[1:23:43] the dedication of Solomon's took on this
[1:23:45] movement yeah but they were ready in the
[1:23:47] upper room God was moved Lydia when
[1:23:51] Daniel prayed 21 days yes wait 21 days
[1:23:55] for an answer and we finally when the
[1:23:59] answer comes let's see no I heard you
[1:24:01] the first time you prayed that's right
[1:24:02] when you set your heart and you
[1:24:05] chastened yourself I heard you hey man
[1:24:10] gosh God why am I here yeah you know how
[1:24:15] the Gabriel had to fight through yes and
[1:24:19] God was so drawn to comes in Michael go
[1:24:21] down every meeting and April came on
[1:24:24] through what God is drawn to dedication
[1:24:26] because that's a characteristic of
[1:24:28] yourself my glory for the people of God
[1:24:34] and that's where it comes down even in
[1:24:37] your life in my life we come into these
[1:24:40] times like this the Lord which way do I
[1:24:43] go
[1:24:43] which way do I stay or after I moved to
[1:24:47] yes where and God is faithful to his
[1:24:50] word hallelujah because our desires to
[1:24:53] are pleasing to him and not just presume
[1:24:55] and go around recording illegally I
[1:24:56] think you only grow in it but we want to
[1:24:58] know Lord what do you want yeah it's a
[1:25:01] tremendous I tell you Frank
[1:25:04] it to me is so tremendous how God it
[1:25:07] directs us to be sensitive to ask for
[1:25:11] his little piece of paradise I notice
[1:25:12] how simple little paradox how that God
[1:25:14] we've embraced to a place to where we
[1:25:16] see everyone what's what you will is
[1:25:19] that yes you know because there's
[1:25:21] certain things that we go about our life
[1:25:22] we don't ask God's will so it's just
[1:25:24] like you're at a red light you don't
[1:25:26] need to ask if it's God's will for you
[1:25:27] stop it's a red light
[1:25:29] it's like certain things in the word
[1:25:31] where Paulson is the will of God for you
[1:25:33] to know how to possess your vessel in
[1:25:35] the sink yeah yes very good
[1:25:37] it's the will of God for you to receive
[1:25:38] the Holy Ghost it's the will go to the
[1:25:40] command I it's a little God to be in the
[1:25:42] house of yeah well you know if it's
[1:25:45] God's will for me to be in the hospital
[1:25:46] or I can tell you to sit the Lord to be
[1:25:49] a knowledge that's not it that's a clear
[1:25:52] clear reality there right comes to other
[1:25:55] things job houses where you live so
[1:26:00] forth everything in all the things we
[1:26:02] need is leadership yes yes but it all
[1:26:06] God's peace is always accompanied and
[1:26:09] always signification of the school
[1:26:11] there's a stupid vision I train or
[1:26:15] whatever it's always a kind of the peace
[1:26:17] because God's will is pleased
[1:26:19] Hey and God come on the scene here to
[1:26:22] guide his people and to move them into
[1:26:25] the place and position that he had for
[1:26:28] that because God is committed to his
[1:26:30] word hallelujah it was just committed to
[1:26:33] Uriah it would have been like him
[1:26:34] looking at all the people say Oh fifteen
[1:26:37] years
[1:26:37] look how they're talking the time has
[1:26:39] not come because not committed to our
[1:26:42] flesh right he's committed to his work

[1:27:05] is by weight and God will perform a
[1:27:07] miracle by surgeon or doctors you know
