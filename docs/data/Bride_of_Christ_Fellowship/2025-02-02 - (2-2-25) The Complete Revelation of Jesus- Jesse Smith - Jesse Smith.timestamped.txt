[0:00] so notice God gave this Revelation to
[0:01] his
[0:02] son to show unto his servants things
[0:06] which must shortly come to pass so some
[0:08] of them did come to pass very shortly
[0:10] such as the first seal they came to pass
[0:12] very shortly after this and he sent and
[0:15] signified it by his Angel unto his
[0:18] servant
[0:19] John who bear record of the word of God
[0:22] now that's important because that deals
[0:23] with the fif seal the word of God is the
[0:25] Old Testament so God gave John Witnesses
[0:27] from the Old
[0:28] Testament and and so and is a
[0:31] conjunction of course something else and
[0:33] of the testimony of Jesus Christ that's
[0:35] the New Testament so God gave John
[0:37] Visions to understand the Old Testament
[0:39] and tie the Old Testament and the New
[0:41] Testament
[0:43] together and of all things that he saw
[0:46] let's read verse three ready 1 two three
[0:48] blessed is he that readeth and they that
[0:51] hear the words of this prophecy and keep
[0:54] those things which are written therein
[0:56] for the time is at hand may God add his
[0:59] Blessing to the reading of his word you
[1:00] may be
[1:02] seated that's a separate sermon I want
[1:04] to preach sometime you know Paul Peter
[1:05] and John all kept saying the time is
[1:07] short the time is short the time is
[1:08] short and look we're at 2,000
[1:10] years so he's not referring to uh time
[1:14] from our perspective he's referring to
[1:16] time from God's perspective Hallelujah
[1:18] because A Thousand Years is as one
[1:22] day now Casa if you would and let's try
[1:25] this just so I mean the whole purpose I
[1:27] want to preach on this was also to show
[1:29] some visuals here let's see if we can
[1:30] get the
[1:35] visuals okay great all now I'm not quite
[1:38] ready for that here but U maybe you all
[1:41] want to see my notes here but you're
[1:43] going to straighten your eyes so I
[1:44] wouldn't worry about the notes Here by
[1:45] God's grace unless you want to strain
[1:47] your ass today uh so I just want to um
[1:51] preach on this I've had this thought I
[1:52] found a chain of quotes from brother
[1:54] Brandon just like I found the chain on
[1:55] the radio Ministry of brother Orman
[1:57] Neville right brother Jose I found a
[1:58] chain of quotes on that put out a video
[2:00] this week it's just a beautiful chain of
[2:01] quotes what I mean by that is you see
[2:03] one thought from Brother Bram given by
[2:05] the Holy Spirit and it just goes year
[2:07] after year after year all the way down
[2:09] so it's a very wonderful um chain of
[2:12] scriptures here by God's grace so um
[2:15] we'll get to those quotes in a little
[2:17] bit um brother Ram says a couple things
[2:19] about the complete revelation of Jesus
[2:20] Christ and here we see God gave Jesus
[2:23] Christ a revelation Hallelujah to give
[2:26] to the people and it was the revelation
[2:28] of him and also Al of his will and his
[2:31] purpose for things to come Hallelujah so
[2:34] we see it by the grace of God now I want
[2:36] to just uh briefly
[2:38] review you know especially our young
[2:40] Brothers our you know our uh the Saints
[2:42] anas just been baptized and you know uh
[2:45] Malachi and our teenagers even brother
[2:47] Chris you know just freshly into the
[2:49] message you know it's quite a thing to
[2:51] say that we have the complete revelation
[2:53] of Jesus Christ what we mean we're not
[2:55] talking about we understand every single
[2:57] thing in the universe what we mean mean
[3:00] is we understand all things God wants us
[3:02] to
[3:03] know we understand all the Revelation
[3:06] that is currently available for humans
[3:08] right now you know we sang a song on the
[3:10] way to church and it was something you
[3:11] know uh after after a million years
[3:13] we'll still just start to understand the
[3:15] heart of God after one million
[3:17] years because God is so great and
[3:19] infinite like no one could uh let me set
[3:21] my timer
[3:22] here no one could no one will ever
[3:25] eternally or I'm sorry no one will ever
[3:27] fully understand God because he's
[3:29] greater than all of us he's the Creator
[3:31] and we have all eternity to spend with
[3:33] the Lord that's hard to wrap your mind
[3:35] around so what we mean by this is we
[3:38] have the the complete Revelation the
[3:40] complete will of God for what God wants
[3:42] done with the church right now that's
[3:45] what we mean okay and so you know Austin
[3:48] sent me a good question this week he
[3:49] said do we have the perfect uh uh
[3:52] Doctrine and I said well I mean I
[3:54] answered it with no sir because I didn't
[3:55] want to say I understand everything
[3:56] perfectly um so that's what I meant by
[3:58] that you know I I don't understand
[4:00] everything but I would say we follow the
[4:02] apostolic
[4:04] Doctrine because we're doing our best
[4:06] we're still growing into that now will I
[4:09] uh do I believe we'll have that right
[4:10] before the Rapture yes I do yes I
[4:12] believe you know in order for God to
[4:14] Rapture a church they got to be ready
[4:15] his wife has made herself ready
[4:17] Hallelujah Enoch walked with God until
[4:19] Enoch was ready to go home with God
[4:22] right and so we'll walk with if if we
[4:23] live to see it you know if the Lord
[4:25] allows us to go to the Grave that that's
[4:26] fine but if the Lord allows us to see it
[4:29] I believe right before before the
[4:30] Rapture uh the Bible said the lad rain
[4:32] will fall rapturing faith will fall
[4:34] we'll be under such an anointing right
[4:36] there there'll be all the pressure
[4:38] around all the the political pressure
[4:40] and and financial pressure all that be
[4:41] around us we'll have nothing else to do
[4:43] except live off the anointing the rain
[4:46] that God sent from heaven Hallelujah so
[4:48] I believe uh in those moments there uh
[4:50] in the when the latter rain is falling I
[4:52] believe we'll have uh the the fullness
[4:54] of Pentecost as brother brandom said now
[4:56] let's go to Joel 2 I'm going to you know
[4:58] oh yeah that's fine it might be nice to
[4:59] off thank you because be straightening
[5:02] at all my notes and you know trying to
[5:03] get to my thoughts I appreciate you
[5:06] wanting to know my thoughts here by
[5:07] God's grace because they're supposed to
[5:08] come from the Bible Hallelujah that's
[5:12] right but just reminder Joel
[5:14] 2:23 uh through 26 brother Ram says in
[5:17] the church age book uh this is thus
[5:19] saith the Lord the fullness of Pentecost
[5:22] will be in the bride
[5:31] all right I just put it up there I'm
[5:32] having trouble getting to it there be
[5:35] glad then ye children of Zion and
[5:37] rejoice in the Lord your God for Heath
[5:40] given you the former Reign moderately
[5:41] now Paul's right there brother mam said
[5:43] the seventh Church age messenger G gave
[5:45] us the former Reign it's a teaching
[5:48] Reign Hallelujah so during brother Ram's
[5:51] Ministry from 30s to 65 that was the
[5:54] teaching rain God sent rain down
[5:55] remember God said he said my Doctrine
[5:58] drops as due from the heaven
[6:00] my doctrine's as rain in other words if
[6:03] God's going to water the seed he's got
[6:05] to give it the right teaching he's got
[6:08] to make sure uh the church is taught the
[6:10] right way Hallelujah so that's in the
[6:12] church age book brother Ram says his
[6:13] ministry was the former Reign to water
[6:16] the seed hallelujah thank God and he
[6:18] will cause to come down for you the rain
[6:20] the former rain and the latter rain in
[6:22] the first month okay verse 24 and the
[6:25] floor shall be full of Wheat and the fat
[6:27] shall overflow with wine and oil when I
[6:30] listen to brother brandom I'm always
[6:31] more uh overwhelmed I listened to the
[6:34] evening messenger yesterday from 63
[6:35] great message if you want to listen to
[6:36] that one uh he talks it's all about
[6:39] building up to his ministry God always
[6:40] sent a prophet right before judgment
[6:42] it's a beautiful message there we'll be
[6:43] getting into a little bit of that today
[6:44] by God's
[6:45] grace but every time this is what I I'm
[6:47] convinced every time brother Mercy I
[6:49] listen to brother brandom or listen to
[6:50] even sermons from message preachers I'm
[6:52] just amazed how much more there is to
[6:54] preach that's why we need a fivefold
[6:56] Ministry I can't do it alone even
[6:58] brother brandom couldn't do it alone
[7:00] right he was one man and we need the
[7:02] entire fivefold Ministry we need all
[7:04] five preaching gifts so this is we can
[7:06] clearly see this is fulfilled there's so
[7:08] many things uh uh the floors are just
[7:10] full of wheat there's so much word to
[7:12] preach amen there's so many things I
[7:14] want to grow in Hallelujah there's so
[7:16] many things I want to manifest I want
[7:18] God's spirit to flow through me
[7:19] Hallelujah I'm thankful for what I've
[7:21] seen right but there's also more the
[7:24] floors are full of bread full of God's
[7:26] wheat and the fat shall overflow with
[7:28] wine and oil there there's always more
[7:30] Revelation for us there's always more
[7:32] joy for us to have Hallelujah that's
[7:34] right see if you haven't been joyful
[7:36] lately that's what you got to do you got
[7:37] to feed on the word of God you got to
[7:39] get in the spirit you got to drink uh
[7:41] from the wine of God's holy spirit
[7:43] praise God you got to be filled with the
[7:45] oil Hallelujah the joy of the Lord
[7:47] hallelujah that's right now verse 25
[7:50] I'll
[7:51] restore so we're brother man talking
[7:53] about the complete revelation of Jesus
[7:56] Christ so the Revelation that they had
[7:59] at the the beginning 2,000 years ago
[8:00] much of it has been lost so God has to
[8:03] restore it in our day and he has been
[8:06] restoring in our day he he promised I'll
[8:08] restore to you the years the Locust hath
[8:11] eaten so this is the Antichrist spirit
[8:13] in four stages just like there's four
[8:15] horse riders just like there's four
[8:17] steps to Sin Sin enticed sin conceived
[8:21] sin death there's four steps it's very
[8:24] easy to see if you just look at the
[8:25] scriptural uh view of it so in other
[8:28] words uh these Antichrist Spirits were
[8:30] going to eat at the church all these
[8:32] years he says and that's the great Army
[8:35] God sent that among them right God God
[8:37] allowed that to go amongst the false
[8:39] churches uh because God has to give them
[8:41] what they desire preached on that last
[8:43] week God will give you whatever you
[8:44] desire you better make sure your desire
[8:47] is to do the will of God hallelujah
[8:49] right because we are not partakers of
[8:51] iniquity we depart from iniquity
[8:54] Hallelujah we preach on that on
[8:55] Wednesday night and brother Jose thanks
[8:57] for the kind words about that sermon
[8:58] brother Hal verse
[9:00] 26 and ye shall eat in plenty so there's
[9:03] plenty of food word to eat and be
[9:06] satisfied You'll Be So Satisfied being a
[9:08] holy ghost filled Christian Hallelujah
[9:10] and you'll praise the name of the Lord
[9:11] your God you won't deny God praise
[9:14] you'll give God praise
[9:16] Hallelujah that hath dealt wondrously
[9:18] with you and my people shall never be
[9:20] ashamed I'm not ashamed to be a
[9:22] Christian I'm thankful to be a Christian
[9:24] Hallelujah I'm going to keep praising
[9:26] him and God has been wonderful to me and
[9:29] every trial I've been through and every
[9:30] even mistake I made God has been
[9:32] wonderfully merciful to me he he's he's
[9:36] actually like the psalmist says he's
[9:38] actually done less than what I
[9:41] deserve in other words he hasn't
[9:42] punished me according to what I actually
[9:44] deserve and any honest person here would
[9:46] say the same Hallelujah God is so
[9:49] gracious and
[9:50] merciful Hallelujah now um now some of
[9:53] these I'm not going to as I had on my
[9:54] list there you you're familiar with
[9:56] Malachi 45 and6 the spirit of Elijah
[9:59] would turn our hearts back to the
[10:01] fathers in other words the fathers of
[10:04] the Christian faith Paul James John
[10:06] Peter so forth all the Bible writers and
[10:09] that's what brother R's Ministry was to
[10:10] do this is how we can have the complete
[10:12] Revelation because God in other words
[10:14] brother Chris God has turned us back to
[10:16] believe everything in the Bible amen as
[10:18] you saw some church some Churches don't
[10:20] believe everything in the Bible Austin
[10:22] see we all see it right when we when
[10:24] we're amongst those people they don't
[10:25] believe everything in the Bible they
[10:27] kind of pick and choose but God has
[10:28] turned our heart Hearts back to that
[10:30] through the spirit of Elijah that was on
[10:32] brother Brenham Hallelujah Revelation
[10:35] 10:7 said but in the days of the voice
[10:37] of the seventh angel when he shall begin
[10:39] to sound the mystery of God should be
[10:42] finished so at some point the mystery of
[10:44] God has to be finished and the Mystery
[10:47] of God is detailed to us I have I have a
[10:49] whole book on that and brother R has
[10:51] given us all of the revelations of any
[10:53] teaching that's called a mystery there's
[10:55] 12 of them brother R has given us six of
[10:57] them with thus sayith the Lord and the
[10:59] other six line up perfectly with the
[11:00] other ones so we know the mystery of God
[11:04] is finished as far as the will of God
[11:07] the doctrine of God the plan of God uh
[11:09] the anything that's called a mystery in
[11:11] the Bible is finished as he declared to
[11:13] the prophets one of the prophets he
[11:14] declared that to is Daniel also Joel
[11:17] right uh so pull up Daniel 12:4 hun
[11:19] Daniel
[11:20] 12:4 here's a prophet that he promised
[11:22] this
[11:24] to but thou oh Daniel shut up the words
[11:27] and seal the book even to the time of
[11:29] the end many shall run to and fro that's
[11:32] what they do today they fly to this
[11:33] conference fly to that conference drive
[11:35] to that they're thinking they're finding
[11:37] the will of God or the word of God
[11:38] they're not because Amos said it's a
[11:40] spiritual
[11:41] famine and you only find the food in one
[11:44] place where the Eagles are gathered
[11:46] hallelujah amen that's right amen where
[11:48] the carcass is that's where the Eagles
[11:50] gather for the word hallelujah see but
[11:52] they're running to and fro my those'll
[11:54] spend
[11:55] thousands uh like brother there's a
[11:57] brother from Minnesota he told me God
[11:58] brought him of the charismatic movement
[12:00] with Kenneth Hagen and Kenneth copelan
[12:02] and all those Benny hin God brought he
[12:04] was full in for 20 years and then God
[12:06] showed him William brandham and God
[12:08] pulled him out of there but this brother
[12:10] would fly all around the world and see
[12:12] all their supposed signs and supposed
[12:15] prophecies and he started seeing all the
[12:17] all the contradictions and so forth like
[12:18] that but he would fly thinking he's
[12:20] getting the word of God but then when he
[12:22] gets the word of God he said it totally
[12:23] changed his heart it melted his heart it
[12:25] made him feel thankful for the word of
[12:27] God cuz he knew finally knew the
[12:29] complete revelation of Jesus Hallelujah
[12:32] so the other preachers were keeping away
[12:33] that
[12:34] Revelation but God gave brother brandom
[12:36] the Teaching Ministry the the former
[12:38] Reign to give us the word so we can
[12:41] receive the word of God the seed can
[12:42] grow because we have the rain to help it
[12:44] grow hallel the anointing to help it
[12:46] grow Hallelujah yes that's right and
[12:50] notice the book was sealed to the time
[12:52] even two and then brother R comes around
[12:54] and says thus sayith the Lord here's the
[12:56] revelation of the Seven Seals
[12:59] Hallelujah so brother Chris that's
[13:01] really important to know brother Ram
[13:02] said thus sayith the Lord the book is
[13:03] now open in other words we understand
[13:06] all Seven Seals I got videos on them
[13:08] brother I got all I got books the book I
[13:10] gave you it's all in there by God's
[13:12] grace we're going to review a little bit
[13:13] today all right it's thus say now that's
[13:16] quite a thing to say that's either God
[13:18] or the devil we know it's God hallelujah
[13:22] because we'll see brother Bram always
[13:23] pointed us back to one place not to
[13:25] himself brother Bram said forget
[13:27] anything about me I'm just a sinner sa
[13:29] by Grace I'm not saying that to be
[13:30] humble he said but it's Jesus Christ
[13:32] doing all these things Hallelujah
[13:34] bringing us back to the word of God
[13:37] hallelujah yes now Matthew
[13:40] 17:11 now here's another Prophet who
[13:43] foretold of this restoration it was the
[13:46] Lord Jesus the god Prophet the greatest
[13:49] prophet and Jesus answered and said unto
[13:51] them Elias now there's the spirit of
[13:53] Elijah truly shall first come and
[13:55] restore all things remember this is
[13:58] Mount Transfiguration so before Moses
[14:00] and Elijah come to Jesus right the
[14:02] 144,000 Israel before that he's going to
[14:04] send Elijah to restore all things to the
[14:07] Gentile Church Hallelujah he's going to
[14:10] restore all things so even the Lord
[14:11] Jesus talked about this and notice the
[14:13] spirit of Elijah that was on William
[14:16] brandham remember he had all the
[14:17] attributes he prophesied the name of the
[14:19] Lord uh he preached against immoral
[14:21] women Elijah preached against a jezebel
[14:24] brother R preached against Marilyn
[14:26] Monroe right all these immoral women uh
[14:29] men of the Wilderness brother loved to
[14:30] spend time and got many Revelations out
[14:32] there the Wilderness that's where
[14:33] brother got stature perfect man out
[14:34] there in the wilderness he was sitting
[14:36] at the bottom of a tree trunk with a
[14:38] notepad and the lord gave him that
[14:40] message and took him to the verse and he
[14:41] drew the picture and everything and
[14:42] wrote it down right there sitting in the
[14:43] wilderness amen hallelujah
[14:47] Glory also Acts 20 verse 27 now this Pro
[14:51] this verse proves that they had all the
[14:54] will of God in the beginning but then
[14:57] the the church lost it because they
[14:59] wanted to do evil things you know the
[15:00] Catholic church and all these
[15:01] denominations but Jesus is going to
[15:03] restore at the end time look what Paul
[15:05] said Paul was there for I believe 3 and
[15:07] a half years if I'm not mistaken for
[15:09] I've not shun to declare unto you all
[15:10] the counsel that means purpose of God or
[15:13] will of God so in three years Paul was
[15:16] able to lay in here's all the will of
[15:17] God will of God with marriage and
[15:19] divorce will of God with the Rapture uh
[15:21] husbands and wives right lay it all in
[15:23] there uh freedoms and Liberties and all
[15:25] these things he was able to lay all of
[15:26] it in there I've given you the whole
[15:28] counsel of God and now it's been
[15:30] restored to us with thus sayith the Lord
[15:32] hallelujah amen
[15:35] hallelujah now don't forget this brother
[15:37] bar said uh God's three-fold purpose in
[15:39] Christ The Mystery of God revealed it's
[15:40] been a number of years last time I
[15:41] preached that was when brother Aaron was
[15:43] here because he he had asked me to
[15:44] preach on that back in
[15:46] 2019 I preached on uh I repr preached
[15:48] brother bram's sermon on Christ is the
[15:50] mystery of God revealed there's a
[15:52] three-fold purpose God's trying to do so
[15:53] in other words all the counsel of God he
[15:55] was to get preeminence in his son first
[15:58] place in jesus' life the second thing is
[16:00] preeminence in the
[16:02] church and then thirdly uh he's going to
[16:05] restore the kingdom back to the Eden
[16:08] condition that's God's three that's his
[16:10] whole purpose that's the whole counsel
[16:11] of God Amen Hallelujah Glory that's the
[16:14] whole counsel of God and church so what
[16:15] does God want God wants preeminence he
[16:17] wants first place in your life
[16:20] am now church I I believe I preached
[16:23] this many times I believe God is holding
[16:25] off the Rapture because so many people
[16:26] have not heard the message like I told
[16:29] you about the Junction City
[16:30] Saints they it's all fresh to them
[16:33] imagine open up a message book it's the
[16:34] first time you've opened up a message
[16:36] book or the church age book it's to them
[16:40] I mean they get that feeling for the
[16:42] first
[16:43] time how about our little Jen wanting to
[16:45] be baptized soon by God's grace there's
[16:47] a reason uh the Rapture has been held
[16:50] off brother B said there's names brother
[16:53] said there's names on the book of Heaven
[16:55] the Lamb's Book of Life that still
[16:57] haven't recognized that their names on
[16:58] the book look but brother says when the
[17:01] last one recognizes it he said Jesus
[17:03] going to step off the throne and say now
[17:05] it's time to go down and get my bride
[17:07] she's ready
[17:08] Hallelujah Glory so that's what I
[17:11] believe and that's what you know second
[17:12] Peter 3 says that uh account it that the
[17:16] that the longsuffering of the Lord has
[17:18] held off the Rapture because he's still
[17:21] trying to save
[17:22] Believers so keep keep praying for
[17:25] people that aren't saved who would have
[17:26] thought last year would have been the
[17:27] year that brother Nia came to to Church
[17:29] brother like I've told you many times
[17:31] Hallelujah I've invited him to church
[17:33] and we pray for him and everything like
[17:34] that he's been such a faithful brother
[17:36] here by God's grace and how about
[17:38] brother Chris coming back by God's
[17:40] grace you know God this is God's time of
[17:43] longsuffering with me with all of us
[17:45] hallelujah God's doing something
[17:47] Hallelujah he's trying to save Souls
[17:49] Hallelujah remember brother R said the
[17:51] Rapture won't be one minute late
[17:54] Hallelujah God's going to wait till
[17:56] every name knows all my names on the
[17:58] book like John's name is on the book
[18:00] Hallelujah I'm a believer I'm one of the
[18:03] few and by faith in God's word I can
[18:05] claim it hallelujah amen I want to sing
[18:08] that one today maybe we'll sing that by
[18:09] God's
[18:12] grace now here's where we get to uh the
[18:15] seven Thunders remember in Revelation 10
[18:18] I believe it's verse three and
[18:21] four this and brother man tells us
[18:23] plainly this is the the the act of God
[18:27] that allows us to have the complete
[18:29] revelation of Jesus Christ back in our
[18:34] day I know this is a little deeper of
[18:37] course it is the things of God are
[18:38] always
[18:40] deep Revelation 10 so Christ comes down
[18:43] as a mighty Angel verse three and notice
[18:46] in verse two he brings down the little
[18:48] book so he brings down the book that was
[18:50] closed in heaven with Seven Seals Jesus
[18:52] breaks the seals and he comes down and
[18:54] brings the open book the seals are
[18:56] broken verse three and he cry with a
[18:59] loud voice as when a lion Roth and when
[19:01] he had cried seven Thunders uttered
[19:03] their voices and when the seven Thunders
[19:05] had uttered their voices I was about to
[19:07] write and I Heard a Voice from Heaven
[19:08] saying to me seal up those things which
[19:10] the seven Thunders uttered and write
[19:12] them
[19:12] not and the angel which I saw stand upon
[19:15] the sea and upon the Earth lifted up his
[19:17] hand to heaven and swear by him that
[19:18] liveth forever and ever who created
[19:20] heaven and the things that therein are
[19:22] and the earth and the things that there
[19:23] in are and the Sea and the things which
[19:25] are therein that there should be time no
[19:27] longer or delay no longer for this to
[19:29] happen but in the days of the voice of
[19:31] the seventh angel when he should begin
[19:33] to sound the mystery of God should be
[19:35] finished as he has declared to his
[19:37] servants the prophets Hallelujah so once
[19:41] the revelation of the Seven Seals were
[19:43] given
[19:44] Hallelujah then we know that the book
[19:47] has been opened I want to read that
[19:48] quote if I can find it here I'm
[19:50] scrolling down yes hope that's
[19:53] it oh no it's Feast of the trumpets okay
[19:55] so I want especially these young young
[19:58] young brothers and sisters here just try
[19:59] I'm just going to try to break this down
[20:02] in heaven Jesus loosed the seals in
[20:05] heaven and and he s and John wrote down
[20:08] the visions that was uh back you know
[20:11] 8090 okay but then here in Revelation 10
[20:14] we believe this happened in our day in
[20:15] March of 1963 We Believe Revelation 10
[20:19] 1:7 brother R said is history it's
[20:21] already been fulfilled that's what
[20:23] brother Braham said in other words Jesus
[20:25] Christ came down he broke the Seven
[20:27] Seals he r revealed the revelations of
[20:30] the Seven Seals and when brother Ram
[20:31] preached the first seal and gave us and
[20:34] told us what that first seal meant that
[20:36] was a thunder that was God's voice
[20:38] thundering down telling us what the
[20:40] Bible said what it meant that was on
[20:43] Monday night right and then Tuesday
[20:45] night was the second seal brother Ram
[20:46] ends the second seal and he stands there
[20:48] and he says that's thus saith the
[20:51] Lord if that's not a thunder pray pray
[20:54] tell me someone what is a
[20:56] thunder a thunder is a voice of God God
[20:59] hallelujah it's a voice of God it's
[21:01] God's voice thus sayith the Lord here's
[21:03] what the second seal
[21:05] means and then at the end of the seventh
[21:07] seal he says he says the church ages
[21:09] plus the history plus the seals he says
[21:11] all these things to the best of my
[21:13] knowledge are thus sayith the Lord amen
[21:16] glory so when he preached all Seven
[21:18] Seals we you know we heard the seven
[21:21] Thunders and remember John was going to
[21:23] write him down so he must have known
[21:24] what they said he must have known that
[21:27] the white horse rider was the an Christ
[21:29] not the Holy Spirit he heard it but God
[21:33] said don't write it I'm saving it for a
[21:34] people at the end time they're going to
[21:36] need it Hallelujah why because we need
[21:38] to eat the book Hallelujah in order in
[21:41] order to overcome Satan we got to eat
[21:43] the book and prophesy again Hallelujah
[21:46] in other words get away from that
[21:47] Antichrist Spirit get filled with the
[21:49] Holy Ghost get the eagle anointing Fly
[21:51] Above the things of the world don't stay
[21:53] and eat worldly carnal things don't get
[21:54] addicted to porn like a brother emailed
[21:56] me from overseas you know this week
[21:58] don't get addicted to to money and all
[22:00] these things get filled and get addicted
[22:02] to the Holy Ghost
[22:04] Hallelujah that's why the book is open
[22:06] amen eat the book eat the word
[22:08] hallelujah and then you'll prophesy
[22:11] again some people wonder why isn't God
[22:13] using me more are you eating the
[22:15] book why isn't God speaking to me more
[22:18] eat the book God will speak through you
[22:20] hallelujah amen you won't even know it
[22:23] sometimes God will be speaking to
[22:25] you back in November when a family was
[22:28] not allowed to come to church I didn't
[22:30] even realize it on a Wednesday night I
[22:32] was closing in prayer and I said I I
[22:34] rebuke the hand of Satan on the
[22:36] situation there was only a few people
[22:38] here I know there was Witnesses here I
[22:40] know Zer was here I know my family was
[22:41] here I said Satan get your hands off
[22:44] this situation in Jesus Christ's name I
[22:47] didn't know but 5,000 miles across the
[22:49] ocean just a few hours after that the
[22:52] Lord anointed a man to intercede and by
[22:55] Thursday we got the news that the family
[22:57] can come back to church by God's grace
[22:59] that was Wednesday night and Church in
[23:01] the moment I didn't know what I was
[23:02] doing that's how it always is we don't
[23:04] know what we're doing we just yield to
[23:06] God God takes over and then you speak
[23:08] the word hallelujah and watch it come to
[23:11] pass
[23:13] Hallelujah like even last week I shared
[23:15] with brother amen I'll see you next week
[23:17] I left here saying oh I'm such a fool
[23:20] I'm I'm preaching away next week I'm out
[23:23] in Pennsylvania I said I'm such a fool
[23:25] and all week I'm like man what are you
[23:29] and then I got the text on Tuesday we're
[23:31] canceling the service even God wouldn't
[23:33] even let my words fall to the
[23:35] ground now I'm not saying a prophet I'm
[23:37] just saying I was speaking by the spirit
[23:39] of God and I didn't even know it that's
[23:42] just
[23:43] one I felt so foolish walking out here
[23:45] I'm like what did I
[23:46] do now I got to make it right I got to
[23:49] text and everything like that talk
[23:51] whatever even in that moment sometimes
[23:54] God will just speak through you and God
[23:57] will vindicate his word God always
[23:58] vindicates his
[24:00] word now so here's for the young
[24:03] Brothers here this quote from the Feast
[24:04] of
[24:06] trumpets brother Ram said he was in
[24:08] Sabino Canyon which is in Arizona and
[24:11] God had called him out to the west to
[24:13] meet the seven angels that would give
[24:15] the revelations of the Seven
[24:16] Seals brother R said I was up I was up
[24:19] with my hands in the air praying and a
[24:21] sword came into my hands you know that I
[24:24] stood there and looked at it just as
[24:25] natural as a hand is uh is not knowing
[24:28] what not know I'm sorry not knowing what
[24:30] it meant and it was left me with a voice
[24:32] that said this is the sword of the king
[24:35] what is the sword of the king the
[24:37] word so he has a vision and he has a
[24:40] sword in his hand he knows the sword is
[24:41] the word and then later the angel
[24:44] revealed it it was the word in the hand
[24:47] well that's what Ephesians 6 says you
[24:48] got all your five uh pieces of Defense
[24:51] but you got one offensive weapon that's
[24:53] the word of God hallelujah it's a very
[24:55] completely scriptural vision and then he
[24:58] comes back to Jeffersonville he takes
[25:00] that sword and says this is the first
[25:02] seal this is the second this is the
[25:04] third this is the fourth this is the
[25:06] fifth this is the sixth this is the
[25:08] seventh that's thus sayeth the Lord
[25:10] hallelujah I don't know how to do any
[25:12] planer by God's
[25:15] grace immediately after that the angel
[25:18] of the Lord appeared and told about the
[25:19] Seven Seals that I would return back to
[25:22] Jeffersonville and preach the Seven
[25:24] Seals and there if I've ever said
[25:27] anything that was inspire fired it was
[25:29] in
[25:30] that there where the angel Lord met us
[25:33] and the Bible became a new
[25:37] Bible see that's how you'll know I was
[25:39] telling this to Malachi and my children
[25:41] that's how you'll know when you really
[25:42] have an experience with Christ the Bible
[25:44] becomes a real thing before I had the
[25:46] Holy Ghost I mean before I was even
[25:48] saved the church didn't mean nothing
[25:49] Bible didn't mean nothing but when I got
[25:51] saved the Bible became a new Bible and
[25:53] then when I came in the message the
[25:55] Bible became even newer Hallelujah when
[25:57] I first got brother I was reading all
[25:59] the time and my while the boys went out
[26:00] partied the football guys I was just in
[26:02] there reading highlighting my Bible NIV
[26:04] of all things God let me read an NIV see
[26:07] how merciful he is to my my uh
[26:09] ignorance and they're going off hey
[26:11] Jesse do you want to go to the party no
[26:13] I want to read my Bible okay and they
[26:15] mock me and make fun of me I don't uh
[26:17] they mock me I I don't go sleep around
[26:19] at the parties they mock me oh you're
[26:20] this and you're that let them say
[26:22] whatever they want I don't care I love
[26:24] Jesus Hallelujah nobody had to tell me
[26:27] no nobody had to ask me to read my Bible
[26:29] or go to church or pay my tie or
[26:31] anything nobody had to do that because
[26:32] the Holy Ghost told me to do it
[26:34] Hallelujah and it became a new Bible it
[26:36] was God's love letter to me
[26:39] Hallelujah God was telling me he loved
[26:41] me
[26:42] Hallelujah so became a new Bible and
[26:44] then when I found out about brother
[26:46] bram's Ministry it even became even more
[26:48] new Hallelujah and it's still that way
[26:51] by God's grace
[26:55] Hallelujah he said it became a new Bible
[26:58] there opened up and revealed all the
[27:00] things that the reformers and things had
[27:02] left out it was the complete revelation
[27:03] of Jesus Christ all together new to us
[27:07] but perfectly exactly with the
[27:10] scripture that was the word which has
[27:13] always been I was so inspired and
[27:16] directed Hallelujah that's what I'm
[27:18] saying when I directed to speak to the
[27:19] family situation directed last week to
[27:21] speak You're Just directed you're it's
[27:23] just God takes over you you're just
[27:26] yielded to the Holy Spirit my wife gave
[27:28] me a fresh reminder sometimes she said
[27:29] when I come up here she said there's
[27:30] such an anointing up here around the the
[27:32] platform and I believe it too I've come
[27:34] up after brother Brian preacher or
[27:35] brother McBride and I'm like oh oh
[27:37] there's something different up
[27:38] here it's just showing that God's God's
[27:41] going to back up his word hallelujah
[27:44] just reminding that the word the
[27:46] presence of the Lord is here hallelujah
[27:48] the Bible said the presence of the Lord
[27:49] is here to heal to save to fill with the
[27:52] Holy Ghost to meet all the needs of the
[27:54] people the Bible said God sent his word
[27:56] and it healed them Hallelujah
[27:59] so God sends his word and he tells the
[28:01] he tells the truth beforehand
[28:03] Hallelujah that's what God's word does
[28:05] it's
[28:08] prophetic now I hope that's helpful uh
[28:11] Brothers by God's grace young Brothers
[28:13] yeah I told you you out Mali I said you
[28:14] know Mali even said he's understand the
[28:16] seals better so I said that's a blessing
[28:18] Hallelujah because they're deep they're
[28:20] deep and mysterious remember young
[28:22] Brothers the seals have three forms
[28:24] right they got a reality form when they
[28:27] happen in the real case they they got a
[28:28] revelation form what they mean and then
[28:31] they got a symbol form that's written
[28:32] down in the Bible so you just have to
[28:34] keep that straight if you keep that
[28:36] straight all the quotes make sense but
[28:38] in one case brother B said the seven
[28:39] seal is open we all see it thank God
[28:41] another case said the seven seal hasn't
[28:42] been open
[28:44] yet it depends which form you're talking
[28:47] about the Revelation is open to us we
[28:50] know what is it's the day and hour of
[28:51] Christ Rapture but the reality form has
[28:54] not been open to us no way and it never
[28:56] will be right no man knows the day or
[28:58] the hour of the Rapture and there's
[29:00] really no symbol of it as far as in
[29:03] Revelations Revelation 8 other than
[29:05] silence in heaven but then brother Ram
[29:07] will say somebody you remember this
[29:08] brother R will say in Christ The Mystery
[29:09] of God revealed he said the seven seal
[29:11] is seen in every type in the Bible in
[29:13] other words every time there's a coming
[29:15] of the Lord every time there's a Rapture
[29:17] story that's a type that's the seven
[29:20] seal
[29:22] Hallelujah glory to God so all the Old
[29:24] Testament types so Enoch that's a type
[29:26] of the Rapture that's a type are the
[29:28] seven seal
[29:30] Hallelujah you you just have to go
[29:32] through the Bible and look at every time
[29:34] the Old Testament where was the Old
[29:35] Testament Glory the body changed brother
[29:38] Jose Abraham and Sarah hallelujah king
[29:41] aimik saying oh I I want to marry that
[29:44] that 89 year old woman boy she's a real
[29:45] beautiful lady there I got to have her
[29:48] come
[29:49] on what kind of man would want what kind
[29:51] of King who could have any virgin or any
[29:53] little little girl would want an 89 year
[29:56] old woman for his wife what kind of a
[29:57] man
[29:58] God was changing the body Hallelujah and
[30:01] God will give us a body change in order
[30:03] to receive the promised son
[30:05] Hallelujah that's a type of the seven
[30:07] seal
[30:08] Hallelujah Glory so is Joel chapter 2
[30:11] now I'm seeing it now it's a type of the
[30:13] seven seal the latter
[30:15] rain the latter rain gives us the
[30:17] fullness of Pentecost Hallelujah it will
[30:21] it's the last rain we need in order to
[30:23] produce the seed to produce the fruition
[30:26] and then God can Harvest his bride off
[30:29] the Earth
[30:30] Hallelujah all right I'm about halfway
[30:32] into my message by God's
[30:39] grace
[30:40] Glory now see this is why the seven
[30:42] Thunders are so important
[30:44] brothers and
[30:47] sisters it it basically means the the
[30:49] the revelation of the the the Book of
[30:51] Revelation the the meaning of it has
[30:53] been given to us so we have the complete
[30:56] revelation of Jesus Christ
[30:59] so let me just share this with brother
[31:00] Chris so Mo most churches you know
[31:02] they'll allow people to be married two
[31:03] or three times and say that's okay
[31:05] that's not a revelation of Jesus Christ
[31:07] they have an incomplete revelation of
[31:08] Jesus Christ they might understand
[31:10] you're only saved by grace through faith
[31:12] and you got to be baptized you know yes
[31:14] that's good but they don't have the full
[31:15] revelation of it now Pentecostals get a
[31:18] little closer but they say oh you got to
[31:20] speak in tongues to know you're born
[31:21] again that's that's an incomplete
[31:22] revelation of Jesus Christ Paul said do
[31:25] all speak with tongues the answer answer
[31:28] is no right now would I like to yes I've
[31:31] prayed and asked God but I never have
[31:32] people around us have thank God for that
[31:35] but it's a gift just like being a
[31:37] missionary that's he said are all
[31:38] missionaries are all Apostles are all
[31:40] prophets of course not so not everybody
[31:43] speaks with tongues so brother what
[31:44] we're saying is that we're the only
[31:45] church that has these Revelations from
[31:48] the prophet William brandham that gives
[31:50] us the complete counsil of God the
[31:52] perfect will of God we know how the
[31:54] church should live how it should operate
[31:56] how it should be we understand all these
[31:58] things and it's a gift to us it's not an
[32:00] incomplete it's a complete revelation of
[32:02] Jesus
[32:03] Christ
[32:06] Hallelujah now are we growing in that
[32:08] revelation of course we're constantly
[32:11] growing in the revelation of Jesus
[32:13] Christ right but that's the way it
[32:14] should be right he's restoring I got to
[32:16] restore all those years oh each year we
[32:19] get another revelation of Jesus Christ
[32:22] aren't you glad you're going to get a
[32:23] revelation in 2025 Hallelujah all the
[32:27] years that the Antichrist took away God
[32:29] restores it back to us
[32:31] hallelujah
[32:34] amen
[32:39] glory now let's do
[32:43] uh I just want to give a a general quote
[32:46] here this is from 1960 the Ephesian
[32:47] Church
[32:49] age brother brand said uh the Bible
[32:52] reveals
[32:54] that and thoroughly says in the first
[32:56] chapter of Revelation which is the the
[32:58] only book in the Bible in the New
[32:59] Testament the whole can of the New
[33:00] Testament is the only book that Jesus
[33:02] put his own seal upon so it's the only
[33:04] book book where Jesus says I've got the
[33:06] Revelation from the father I'm giving it
[33:08] to John no other books have that wording
[33:10] in it so brother said that's how
[33:12] important the Book of Revelation
[33:14] is Jesus got the Revelation from the
[33:17] father gave it to John for us and church
[33:20] don't forget you're blessed just to read
[33:21] it I'll was tell my family you know I'm
[33:23] not sure which direction to go with our
[33:25] Bible reading at night I tell you we'll
[33:26] be blessed just to read the book of
[33:27] Revelation
[33:28] you want to be blessed read Revelation
[33:30] yes brother
[33:34] Chris yes read it and understand it yes
[33:37] yeah because a true child of God will
[33:38] only read it to seek understanding right
[33:41] only the critic will try to read it and
[33:43] disprove it or blaspheme it or something
[33:45] like that remember you got two kinds of
[33:47] Christians brother you got a wise and
[33:48] you got a foolish right you got some
[33:51] that have three talents and they they do
[33:52] a lot more for God I'm sorry five
[33:54] talents you got I imagine you got 54 321
[33:56] but the Bible says 52 one you have
[33:58] people with different levels of
[34:00] abilities of gifts of
[34:02] God and some have more some have less
[34:05] but remember even the one and even some
[34:07] can take that talent and bury it in the
[34:08] ground and Jesus say you lazy servant
[34:11] you lazy and slothful servant you wasted

[34:40] that's the one I listening to yesterday

[34:43] said people were saying Oh Brother Bram
[34:45] you've never been to the school of Bob
[34:46] Jones or you never been to the school of
[34:48] Oral Roberts brother Bram said I have
[34:49] been to school he said I've been to the
[34:51] school of the scripture that's the same
[34:54] the school I went to brother Chris the
[34:56] school of the scripture Hallelujah
[34:58] he said I never got a a theology degree
[35:00] I got a neology degree in other words
[35:03] God taught me to pray on my knees teach
[35:06] me the word Reveal Your word to me I'm
[35:08] on my knees God will reveal it then you
[35:10] get up and preach it Hallelujah that's a
[35:12] degree of
[35:14] neology
[35:18] Hallelujah now brother I'm talking about
[35:20] Micaiah which is first Kings
[35:23] 22 and he says
[35:27] Micaiah why would Micaiah who was the
[35:29] son of imla come back and prophesy
[35:32] contrary to them so in this story
[35:34] brother Chris you have the king of Ahab
[35:36] he's an Israel King but he's a baedan
[35:39] king he married Jezebel he had naboth
[35:42] murdered he was a murderous person but
[35:43] he's in the church that's called God
[35:46] like in today in other words today he'd
[35:47] be like he's in the Christian church but
[35:48] he's a
[35:49] murderer okay and Ahab want to know do I
[35:52] go up to Routh Gilead or not do I go up
[35:53] into the city and fight him and Ahab had
[35:56] 400 prophets might be 450 but in the one
[35:58] verse I read it said 400 all the 400
[36:01] prophets said yes go up you'll get the
[36:03] victory yes go up and Jehoshaphat comes
[36:05] over and says Ahab uh is there anybody
[36:07] else here he could sense something's off
[36:08] here there's a lying Spirit
[36:11] here something's
[36:14] off and ahab's like yeah I got one more
[36:16] Prophet it's Micaiah but all he does is
[36:18] blast me for my
[36:20] sins I hate
[36:24] him look at that
[36:28] I hate that guy verse seven and Joseph
[36:31] had said is there not here a prophet of
[36:33] the Lord besides that we might I you got
[36:35] 400 that's exactly like those false
[36:38] prophets in 2020 they said Trump's going
[36:40] to get two consecutive turns the Lord
[36:42] show me that the Lord showed me that it
[36:43] made them all look like fools and they
[36:46] had a 50% chance to get it right and
[36:48] they had four years to get it right so
[36:50] that means in four years they never
[36:52] prayed with a sincere heart to accept to
[36:55] accept correction by the Holy Ghost
[36:58] think about that and then they doubled
[37:00] down thinking you know something's going
[37:01] to happen that's why you know January 6
[37:03] happened and different things like that
[37:04] they they doubled down on it and they
[37:06] were made to look like fools or false
[37:08] prophets that's what God does to all
[37:10] liars that's
[37:13] right verse verse eight and the king of
[37:16] Israel said to josephat yet there's one
[37:18] man Micaiah the son of imla by whom we
[37:20] may inquire of the Lord I hate him for
[37:22] he does not prophesy good he never tells
[37:23] me anything good that's CU you're not
[37:25] living good if you you live good you'll
[37:28] get good
[37:31] Hallelujah but I hate him for he does
[37:33] not prophesy good concerning me but evil
[37:35] and Jose said let not the king say so
[37:37] why you got to say it like that such
[37:39] harsh
[37:41] words now go to uh First Kings 21:17
[37:45] Lydia why why was uh I want to show this
[37:49] here why was Micaiah so sure how could
[37:51] he how could he stand I'm one man
[37:53] against 400 think about that one against
[37:56] 400
[37:57] and no doubt the pressure of the devil
[37:59] would say just join the big group
[38:00] everybody agrees why you got to be
[38:02] different why you got to make yourself
[38:03] different from everybody else why you
[38:05] got to be in the little why you got to
[38:06] be in the little church the small Church
[38:08] the minority church just join up with
[38:10] the rest of
[38:11] them he's like I don't I don't believe
[38:13] lies I'm not taking
[38:15] lies why brother tells us might Micaiah
[38:19] had heard Elijah give thus sayth the
[38:21] Lord about
[38:22] Ahab that's why he knew plus God had
[38:25] showed him a vision right with the Lord
[38:27] High lifted up with all the the Heavenly
[38:29] counsel you see he had already known
[38:31] thus sayith the Lord from the previous
[38:33] Prophet
[38:35] Elijah verse 17 and the word Lord came
[38:38] to Elijah the tipit saying now I'm going
[38:39] down to verse 8 19 and thou shalt speak
[38:41] unto him saying thus sayith the Lord
[38:43] hast thou killed and also taken
[38:45] possession and thou shalt speak unto him
[38:47] saying thus sayeth the Lord in the place
[38:49] where dogs lick the blood of naboth
[38:53] shall dogs lick thy blood even him so
[38:56] Micaiah had known this Micaiah knew the
[38:58] prophecy of the previous
[39:01] Prophet right he knew Ahab was destined
[39:04] for God's destruction now remember
[39:07] Church even in there he still repented
[39:09] and had mercy on him even though his end
[39:11] God knew his end he was going to go back
[39:13] he could have a moment of humility but
[39:14] then he go back to his
[39:19] Disobedience and so micai had heard us
[39:21] that's one reason why Micaiah could
[39:22] stand against this man he's he's killed
[39:25] people now look he hadn't repented of
[39:26] the murder
[39:28] Micaiah knew it he wouldn't repent of
[39:30] the murder he wouldn't repent of
[39:31] building all those houses of
[39:33] idolatry he wouldn't repent of Mary and
[39:35] Jezebel that pain of face
[39:38] devil that's right so so Mai already
[39:42] knew well if God's prophets against him
[39:43] and he hasn't repented of any of this
[39:45] he's got to be wrong so it's easy to
[39:46] stand go it's easy to stand against the
[39:49] majority when you know thus sayith the
[39:50] word of God hallelujah it's easy for us
[39:53] to Chris for brother Chris for us to
[39:55] gather here 18 years we've gathered it's
[39:57] easy to stay here even though we're
[39:58] small and don't have a lot of money
[40:00] don't even have our own building and all
[40:01] these things it's easy because we've got
[40:03] thus say the Lord amen we know what thus
[40:06] sayith the Lord says against
[40:08] denominations there all the
[40:10] denominations are Daughters of the
[40:12] mother Harlot the Roman Catholic Church
[40:14] that's what the Book of Revelation says
[40:16] she's a mother of
[40:19] harlots the Roman Catholic Church is the
[40:21] mother all the denominations came out of
[40:23] Mama
[40:27] yeah she's the main one yes now when God
[40:30] brought out the Lutheran Church they
[40:31] were good until Luther died and the
[40:33] people just denominated we're not taking
[40:35] any more truth and then their
[40:37] denomination died then God moved on to
[40:39] the Baptist and Pentecostal that's where
[40:41] we are
[40:42] today and there's all I mean there's
[40:44] nazarine there's all all kinds of
[40:45] there's I think there's over 9,000 or
[40:47] 990,000 denominations I would get that
[40:49] number mixed up so many but see the word
[40:52] of God then the word of God says in
[40:53] Revelation I believe it's chapter 2
[40:56] Jesus said I'm going to take the the
[40:58] daughters and the mother and cast them
[41:00] into a bed and Destroy them so there's
[41:04] no hope for any
[41:05] denomination it's thus saith the word of
[41:08] God
[41:10] hallelujah now can people come out of
[41:12] that yes they're supposed to come out of
[41:13] that and God's not going to bind them
[41:15] all together until the tribulation so
[41:16] they still got time to come out even in
[41:18] the tribulation they still got time to
[41:21] come out and whatever they were when the
[41:22] tribulation happens that's what the if
[41:24] he that's filthy still let him be filthy
[41:25] still he that's righteous he that's holy
[41:27] let let them be still whatever they are
[41:28] when the Rapture takes place that's what
[41:29] they'll be that's right so Micaiah knew
[41:34] the word Elijah had spoken against Ahab
[41:37] Ahab had not repented of all these
[41:41] sins and brother he he he he tells the
[41:44] story of Micaiah so it's Micaiah
[41:46] standing against
[41:49] 400 butam said he says uh now that take
[41:54] nerve it takes conviction to stand
[41:56] against the
[41:58] majority wow one against 400 Austin
[42:01] knows it you know when he's when you
[42:03] first come to the message Austin you're
[42:04] debating online right it was everybody
[42:05] in the comments against you yep it's a
[42:07] world it's me against the world I think
[42:09] there's a worldly song like that that's
[42:10] that's about the Christian Life they
[42:12] stole that from the Bible right it's
[42:14] it's Christians against everybody
[42:18] else how did they know he was right if
[42:21] you were standing there how would you
[42:23] know brother ra says how would you know
[42:25] it's one man against 400 and the king
[42:29] and you know they're going to put you in
[42:31] jail or abuse you if you don't agree
[42:32] with them how do you know look what
[42:36] brother Ram said the only way you you do
[42:38] let's say the only way ready the only
[42:40] way the only way is to take what the man
[42:43] the prophet says and compare it with the
[42:47] word Oh Glory that means all of us can
[42:50] overcome that means all of us can be on
[42:52] the right side today we just have to
[42:54] take both sides compare what does the
[42:56] word word say and if we agree with the
[42:59] word we're on the right
[43:02] side hallelujah praise
[43:08] God everything must be taken back to the
[43:11] word of God this is what brother says we
[43:13] have the complete re the Bible is the
[43:14] complete revelation of Jesus
[43:19] Christ the only way to know where I
[43:21] stand today or you stand today is to
[43:23] compare it with the word
[43:30] now let me just give you a few examples
[43:31] like I said on March 29th 20120 Kenneth
[43:36] Copeland said thus sayith the Lord CO's
[43:38] over Co is still going
[43:43] around that proved he was a
[43:45] liar and that disproves all of his
[43:48] followers from being that's not the
[43:50] voice you want to
[43:51] hear that's a hireling
[43:54] Shepherd that's a man who's paid for
[43:56] money he's only doing it for money I
[43:58] Pastor when I took money I Pastor when I
[44:00] haven't taken money
[44:03] Hallelujah that's right the only reason
[44:06] we have this church is because of the
[44:07] all your ties that's it I mean hardly
[44:09] any offerings this church is paid for by
[44:11] your ties I donate ties every month year
[44:14] after year 18 years so we can have a
[44:16] house of worship it's a joy it's not a
[44:18] struggle it's a
[44:20] joy because the Bible said H I was happy
[44:23] when they said to me let us go to the
[44:25] house of the Lord hallelujah
[44:27] you're the uh the Bible said the Church
[44:29] of God is the foundation the ground and
[44:32] the pillar of truth hallelujah there's
[44:35] not many churches in this area that
[44:36] stand for actual truth they're not the
[44:38] ground or the pillar of truth but you
[44:41] and I are standing on the truth of God's
[44:45] word Benny Hinn said God would destroy
[44:48] all the homosexuals in the 1990s in
[44:50] America he lied he also said Fidel
[44:52] Castro would die in the 1990s he lived
[44:54] like
[44:55] 2010 that man man's a
[44:58] liar but H but how do you know which
[45:00] side is he on look what look what he
[45:02] says about the
[45:04] Bible Benny H allows women preachers
[45:07] paint their face put the makeup on cut
[45:09] their hair wear pants wear high heels
[45:11] sexy
[45:13] clothes all this I mean just go through
[45:15] the list like there's 100 I got a video
[45:17] 110 things that makes us different
[45:20] there's more but 100 things that make us
[45:22] different from the denominational
[45:23] churches because we believe only the
[45:25] Bible Hallelujah
[45:27] it's the complete revelation of Jesus
[45:29] Christ to you and I this Bible
[45:33] Hallelujah and as I said before if I
[45:35] preach anything outside this you come
[45:36] talk to me about it but you get a chance
[45:37] to ask me on Sunday nights starting next
[45:39] Sunday
[45:40] night I'll take any question by the
[45:43] grace of
[45:45] God Paul the internet preacher who
[45:47] called me the Pharisee for akaran he
[45:49] said uh Joseph brandham had until 2023
[45:52] to repent or else the candle would be
[45:53] taken from his hand that was a lie
[45:55] Joseph brandham still has his he still
[45:57] has control over his ministry he said
[45:59] until 2023 and then he said it was
[46:02] fulfilled when Billy Paul died that's
[46:03] not taking a candle off a candle is a
[46:06] preacher the the light of the the light
[46:08] of the people is the preacher Billy
[46:11] Paul's no
[46:14] preacher now I mentioned this before but
[46:17] uh Joseph brandham said he and his
[46:18] church were in the perfect will of God
[46:20] for pressing play while changing the
[46:22] five-fold ministry that couldn't be he
[46:24] must have got confused he must must have
[46:27] got the second word of God because the
[46:29] first word of God will not change
[46:31] anything in the written word of
[46:35] God they change they say the fivefold
[46:38] ministry is a man who will press play
[46:40] and then walk away let everybody stare
[46:42] at a
[46:43] screen when the Bible said blessed are
[46:46] the feet of him that bring the gospel of
[46:48] good news Hallelujah a t player has no
[46:51] feet Hallelujah a cell phone has no
[46:55] feet blessed is the feet of the man who
[46:58] preaches the gospel the unrated
[47:00] unadulterated Gospel of Jesus Christ
[47:03] Hallelujah I don't know why I'm so fired
[47:05] up
[47:06] amen but look what brother Ram
[47:09] said brother Ram gave us thus sayth the
[47:11] Lord after thus sayith the Lord after
[47:13] thus sayth the Lord that come to pass
[47:14] here's one he said this is one I was
[47:16] sharing brother Chris he
[47:17] said how could Micaiah stop that how
[47:20] could Mah stopped those 400 prophets I
[47:22] thought it was beautiful tight in with
[47:23] Micaiah here how could he do that he
[47:27] said they just went on just the same all
[47:29] 400 just went on into the
[47:31] LIE he said ' it's predicted that
[47:33] they're going to do it other words
[47:35] Elijah predicted they would do it they
[47:38] would support the lying King the lying
[47:40] murderous King married to Jezebel right
[47:44] he said it's predicted they're going to
[47:45] do it and they're going to do it for
[47:47] thus sayith the lord they're going to do
[47:50] it you think them nominations will ever
[47:52] break up their denomination and come
[47:54] back to the word it's the thus sayith
[47:57] the Lord they won't brother Chris I've
[48:00] told five or six maybe more I've told
[48:01] five or six people when they when I
[48:03] share the message with them they say
[48:04] well I think I'm going to stay in my
[48:05] denomination and until they repent I
[48:08] said it's thus sayith the lord they're
[48:10] not one man said in there uh his name
[48:13] was Benjamin he said I'm gonna stay in
[48:14] there to pull out a girl and he never
[48:16] come out of
[48:17] there you don't go on the Devil's
[48:19] Playground you stay with God's children
[48:21] you don't go on the devil's side you
[48:23] stay with the Lord's of uh elect few
[48:25] God's Chosen Few
[48:28] that's right I've told some of our
[48:30] family members here like I've told you
[48:31] some of your family I've told them right
[48:32] to their face I said brother I said your
[48:34] denomination is going into the mark of
[48:36] the beast either our lifetime or the
[48:38] next it's thus sayith the
[48:39] Lord I said give it a window give it a
[48:41] year or two I I told that brother give
[48:43] it a year or two pray and and see if
[48:45] they change their their Creed they're
[48:46] not going to change their Creed it's
[48:49] thus sayith the Lord they
[48:51] won't but it's thus sayith the Lord that
[48:54] we'll stay with God's word hallelujah
[48:55] the complete re ation of Jesus Christ
[48:59] Hallelujah we got thus sayith the Lord
[49:02] so we know where we're standing
[49:08] today will the denominations go into the
[49:12] Antichrist exactly it's thus sayith the
[49:15] Lord they
[49:17] will so we've got Kenneth Copeland
[49:19] saying thus sayith the Lord Joseph Bram
[49:21] we got uh Paul the internet Prophet I
[49:23] I'm gonna I might preach a whole sermon
[49:25] on this one time just show you all the
[49:26] false prophecies
[49:27] who was that other one Kenneth Copeland
[49:29] Benny hen Benny H all these guys and
[49:31] then we got brother Ram we got all these
[49:33] guys saying thus say the Lord who's
[49:34] right brother Chris whoever points back
[49:36] to the word it's very easy who points us
[49:40] back to the word that's the true
[49:42] Prophet Hallelujah very easy but we
[49:46] don't know that unless God sends a
[49:47] prophet to tell us put up Amos 37 Amos
[49:51] 37
[49:57] surely the Lord God will do nothing but
[50:00] he Reveals His Secrets unto the servants
[50:03] the prophets before God does anything on
[50:05] Earth he always shows it by a prophet
[50:08] first right and that's what Daniel
[50:11] talked about the seals being opened uh
[50:13] right Jesus said Elijah Resto will
[50:15] restore and come all things Joel said
[50:16] I'll restore with the spirit of Elijah
[50:18] all the they've all they were all
[50:19] pointing to brother man's ministry here
[50:21] to give us thus sayith the Lord go back
[50:23] to the Bible
[50:28] brother R said always every time a
[50:30] messenger comes it's always a call back
[50:32] to the word never
[50:36] fails remember he says he holds up his
[50:38] Bible this is the complete revelation of
[50:40] Jesus Christ there can be nothing added
[50:42] to it or taken away from it it's the
[50:45] complete revelation of Jesus Christ and
[50:47] the only way we can ever be sure if
[50:50] anything Rises Among Us that's contrary
[50:53] to this Revelation it's wrong
[50:57] I'm going to read that
[50:58] again anything that rises amongst us or
[51:01] any other Church against this it's wrong
[51:05] and this is right amen that's right this
[51:08] is right am Hallelujah the word is
[51:12] right that's how you know it's always so
[51:14] simple to
[51:17] know it's the only way we can ever be
[51:20] sure let's say only way ready only way
[51:22] I'm giving you all these only ways
[51:23] there's only one way to know go back to
[51:24] the word of God look look at the
[51:26] prophecy look at the previous prophets
[51:28] what's the Bible say look at the Bible
[51:30] it's the only way to know which side to
[51:31] stand
[51:34] on see it's back to the word and always
[51:37] calling back always calling back to the
[51:41] word and brother R says in every case in
[51:44] the scripture every case God uses a
[51:46] prophet to call the age back
[51:49] always go to Jeremiah uh 16:15
[51:56] now I'm going to go through a list here
[51:58] of prophets I got I still got 11 minutes
[51:59] till my
[52:02] hour I want to be mindful of the time
[52:05] today Jeremiah 6:15 were they ashamed
[52:08] when they had committed Abomination yay
[52:10] nay they were all not ashamed not at all
[52:13] ashamed of the Abominations like these
[52:16] women these young women that'll wear
[52:18] pants to bed they're not even ashamed of
[52:20] that what if what if a brother what if a
[52:23] man wore a dress to
[52:24] bed what a bunch of
[52:27] hypocrisy
[52:29] nonsense they're not ashamed of it like
[52:31] we saw them in Canada they'll walk
[52:32] around I'll walk around in front of the
[52:34] boys brother BR said he says it don't
[52:36] parade yourself around in the pants if
[52:38] you're going to do
[52:40] that they weren't ashamed of it you see
[52:43] how people get numb to the Holy Ghost if
[52:45] you reject the Holy Ghost Whisper that
[52:47] still Small Voice long enough you'll be
[52:49] opposite and you'll just be unashamed to
[52:51] live in
[52:53] sin that is right neither could they
[52:56] blush they couldn't be ashamed of
[52:57] themselves anymore because of their sin
[53:01] therefore they shall fall among them
[53:02] that fall at the time that I visit them
[53:05] they shall be cast out sayeth the Lord
[53:08] now what's Jeremiah's word look at verse
[53:10] 16 thus sayith the Lord stand ye in the
[53:13] ways and see and ask for the old pass
[53:16] now brother and just said it's always
[53:17] the prophet saying back to the word back
[53:21] we've lost our way we got to go
[53:24] back stand ye in the ways and see for
[53:26] the old path what were the Old Paths the
[53:28] law of Moses for us what is the old path
[53:31] back to Paul back to Matthew Mark Luke
[53:33] John acts Hallelujah Corinthians all
[53:36] these things back to the Bible we got to
[53:38] go back to believe in the Bible praise
[53:43] God where is the good way and walk
[53:47] wherein and you shall find rest for your
[53:49] souls and they said we will not walk
[53:51] therein so it's always a prophet saying
[53:53] go back walk in that that's where you'll
[53:55] find rest that's why people are uneasy
[53:57] in life that's why they're angry that's
[53:59] why they're bitter uh that's why they're
[54:02] upset with other people that's why
[54:03] they're going after uh pleasures of the
[54:06] world rather than God lovers of
[54:08] Pleasures more than lovers of God
[54:10] hallelujah it's because they're not
[54:12] doing what God Said walk in the good way
[54:15] find rest for your
[54:17] souls peace that passes all
[54:20] understanding
[54:22] Hallelujah when you walk in God's truth
[54:24] he gives you peace and it passes all
[54:26] understanding it's not a fake piece it's
[54:28] a real peace you'll see because if
[54:30] somebody crosses you you'll see if
[54:31] you'll keep your peace or not
[54:34] Hallelujah that's
[54:36] right they said we will not walk in this
[54:39] I don't care what the Bible says we got
[54:41] a different way we got our own way to
[54:44] go now you all know this Noah what' he
[54:47] say he said we got to live righteously
[54:48] what they do they kept thinking evil
[54:50] thoughts Noah said let's go back to the
[54:51] old
[54:52] way did they accept it no now here's the
[54:56] here's the order
[54:57] Amos Amos I always say that wrong 760 BC
[55:01] just two I mean yeah just uh let's see
[55:03] that 200 some years after Solomon is
[55:06] already trying to come call them back in
[55:08] Amos I don't have time to read these
[55:10] maybe I'll read it Wednesday I might
[55:11] preach a part two on Wednesday Hosea
[55:14] next tries to call them
[55:16] back uh 15 or yeah 15 years later and
[55:21] then Isaiah 10 years after that tries to
[55:23] call them back
[55:28] and then Jeremiah a hundred years about
[55:30] 80 years after that he's saying come
[55:32] back come back to the word back to the
[55:34] word that God always does it the
[55:36] same come back to the word come back to
[55:39] the complete revelation of Jesus
[55:43] Christ and then around 6:05 Daniel prays
[55:46] for them to come back Ezekiel 593
[55:49] Ezekiel prays for them to come back Joel
[55:51] around it's uncertain but it's probably
[55:52] around 500 BC Joel says come back God
[55:55] will restore all the years and Zechariah
[55:59] around 520 and then Malachi around 430
[56:01] BC always calling them back come back
[56:04] come back God always sends a prophet to
[56:07] call us back to the word of God
[56:09] hallelujah all
[56:12] right thank the Lord hallelujah all
[56:14] right Read that read
[56:16] that okay let me close this this uh I
[56:19] got seven minutes let me close with
[56:21] those visuals hu can you switch over
[56:23] let's go through this here slowly
[56:27] I want to go through this again slowly
[56:28] so everybody can see it I'm have to
[56:30] preach a part two on uh Wednesday
[56:33] night now if you Brothers uh Claude and
[56:36] Patrick if you keep coming on Wednesday
[56:37] night let me know we can go through
[56:38] these on even on Wednesday night by
[56:40] God's grace if you got the time and
[56:41] everything I know you got studies and
[56:42] want do your best in the studies but uh
[56:44] let me know we can go through these kind
[56:45] of slowly just break them down now for
[56:48] me Brothers here's how I did this I had
[56:51] uh this is how when I became a first
[56:53] original Pastor first first time Pastor
[56:55] I I had like this I had brother Rams
[56:58] right here I brother Ram right here I'd
[56:59] Press Play I listen and I write down
[57:02] what he said I'd stop it write down what
[57:05] he said stop it play stop play hour
[57:08] after hour after hour sit down in our
[57:11] kyoga Falls basement with all those uh
[57:14] what are those called centipedes
[57:15] basement centipedes running all around
[57:16] the
[57:17] place just one just spend that time with
[57:20] the Lord that's how God reveals things
[57:22] when you spend time with
[57:24] God that's the only time you got you got
[57:26] to shut away with God now I still do
[57:29] that by God's grace but I just want to
[57:31] show you I just had a Open Bible I
[57:32] actually had the seven seal book brother
[57:34] Jose loves the books I had an open book
[57:36] Bible and just highlight that understand
[57:38] okay write that down okay I'm Gonna Save
[57:40] that quote and then I can understand it
[57:41] by God's
[57:43] grace but there's there's I'll say like
[57:45] this everybody wants a shortcut but
[57:46] there's no shortcuts with
[57:48] God how can I get caught back up uh it
[57:50] takes one day at a time one day at a
[57:52] time takes a faithful walk today you're
[57:55] going to need to be faithful tomorrow to
[57:57] Hallelujah you have you have one day
[57:59] that's that's that's it's not a good day
[58:01] just repent and start up the next day
[58:03] just start back up you can't have a
[58:05] shortcut and jump back to where you were
[58:06] you got to slowly build up with the love
[58:08] of Christ in your
[58:11] heart so here at the end of the seventh
[58:13] seal Brothers here's where he says now
[58:15] the vision now what was that Vision the
[58:17] vision of going out west getting the
[58:18] king's sword the new commission the
[58:20] opening of The Seven Seals meeting the
[58:21] seven angels all that to tell them come
[58:24] back West The Vision Plus the word
[58:26] remember the big explosion I went
[58:27] through that a few weeks ago plus the
[58:28] word like Revelation 6 and plus the
[58:31] history all the church history he laid
[58:33] in the Seven Seals plus the church ages
[58:36] that he preached back in December 1960
[58:38] and all blend together so I could truly
[58:41] say that to the best of my understanding
[58:42] and according to the word of God and the
[58:44] vision and the Revelation the
[58:45] interpretation thereof is thus sayith
[58:47] the Lord who do you know that talks like
[58:48] that nobody talks like that and what did
[58:51] Brother man say he said go back to the
[58:54] Bible go back to the
[58:56] Bible live what the Bible says
[58:59] hallelujah obey the word of God now you
[59:03] got the seven Church ages right from the
[59:05] of Ephesus was 53 up to leoa now it's I
[59:09] need to fix that it's probably beyond
[59:10] that now now that we're in
[59:14] 2025 okay but remember uh after Jesus
[59:18] sent it he sent the line anointing right
[59:20] the four beasts okay but then the devil
[59:23] tried to fight against that by sending
[59:24] the white horse rider
[59:26] okay that's the White Horse that's the
[59:27] Antichrist Spirit that's the first seal
[59:31] that was the when the reality formed
[59:33] happened the Antichrist spirit and then
[59:35] then remember John says there's all
[59:37] these Antichrist out here now right
[59:40] around uh 90
[59:42] ad and this white represents innocent
[59:45] deception by false teaching that's what
[59:47] it means just that it's Antichrist
[59:49] Spirit false
[59:51] teacher okay now he wrode that that many
[59:54] years that the first seal lasted that
[59:56] long and then brother R said he jumped
[59:58] off his White
[1:00:00] Horse and then he hopped on a bloody
[1:00:03] red so now now the church has control
[1:00:07] now the the Roman Catholic church has
[1:00:08] control over the people now they can
[1:00:10] kill anyone that disagrees with
[1:00:12] them brother man proved it in history
[1:00:14] there's over 68 million Martyrs at the
[1:00:16] Roman Catholic church and that's a low
[1:00:18] number because then Revelation 18 says
[1:00:20] every death goes back to the Roman
[1:00:22] Catholic church so they're behind it
[1:00:25] somehow now I'm not telling you to get
[1:00:26] into conspiracy theories I'm just
[1:00:27] believing in the word of God I can't
[1:00:29] spend my time trying to focus on the
[1:00:31] mother Harlot I got to focus on the
[1:00:32] bride but I know what the Bible says so
[1:00:36] I got to say what the Bible says and so
[1:00:37] then God anointed his people with the ax
[1:00:39] anointing to give themselves willingly
[1:00:41] to sacrifice
[1:00:43] themselves they would just they would
[1:00:44] just die they would just give their
[1:00:46] lives and they they know they're going
[1:00:47] to
[1:00:50] heaven and uh now they have United
[1:00:52] Powers they have United powers of church
[1:00:54] and state brother Williams sent me an
[1:00:56] email this week and he said that that
[1:00:57] Beast had two horns brother William was
[1:01:00] emailing me this week one is Civ civil
[1:01:02] that's government and one is ecumenical
[1:01:06] religious it looked like a lamb it
[1:01:08] turned out to be uh turned out to be the
[1:01:12] Buffalo right that's the that's the
[1:01:14] mammal for United States Buffalo that's
[1:01:16] the Beast out of the
[1:01:19] Earth all right now he rode quite a
[1:01:21] while he rode uh hundreds of years looks
[1:01:25] at a about you
[1:01:27] know quite a
[1:01:29] while so he had uh he had many times
[1:01:32] many years and then he jumped off the
[1:01:34] red horse into the black horse which
[1:01:35] represents the Dark Ages that's the
[1:01:38] third seal now remember this is all
[1:01:40] reality form when when did these seals
[1:01:43] actually take place in human history
[1:01:45] that guys this
[1:01:46] help do you remember this yeah been a
[1:01:49] little bit and so now that he's on the
[1:01:51] black horse brother Chris he it's the
[1:01:53] Dark Ages and they burn all the English
[1:01:55] Bible I'm sorry not English uh it was
[1:01:57] before the English Bible they burnt any
[1:01:58] other Bible not in
[1:02:00] Latin and there's a little group uh it's
[1:02:03] part of uh the fourth Church age it's a
[1:02:04] little group that keeps all the word of
[1:02:06] God on some Island Way far away island
[1:02:08] nation far away from the Roman Catholic
[1:02:10] Church that's how God God always
[1:02:11] protects his
[1:02:12] word but now that he's got control of
[1:02:14] the Dark Ages now he can capture the
[1:02:16] wealth of the world what are you gonna
[1:02:17] say
[1:02:22] brother on purpose yeah they would read
[1:02:24] it in Latin
[1:02:26] and the people couldn't understand it
[1:02:28] and there's still people that there's
[1:02:30] still Catholics today that go to Latin
[1:02:32] services and don't understand one word
[1:02:33] they're
[1:02:34] say they're keeping the word from the
[1:02:37] people why because it's powerful there's
[1:02:38] power in the word the word will expose
[1:02:40] Satan that's right amen that's right am
[1:02:43] the word always exposes
[1:02:47] Satan now so God had to send the
[1:02:49] anointing of a man I just put Martin
[1:02:50] Luther because he was the messenger for
[1:02:52] that church age coming up okay now the
[1:02:55] black horse lasted the Dark Ages was
[1:02:57] almost like 1095 to that that anointing
[1:03:00] lasted on almost to 1906
[1:03:03] there so they battled for almost almost
[1:03:05] A Thousand Years brother R said that was
[1:03:07] Satan's Millennium and the church said
[1:03:09] almost a thousand years of full control
[1:03:14] but thank God God's going to have his
[1:03:15] Millennium Hallelujah and you and I get
[1:03:16] to be there Hallelujah we'll be in the
[1:03:19] real Millennium ruling and reigning with
[1:03:21] Christ because we stood with his word
[1:03:23] here on this Earth Hallelujah and we
[1:03:26] didn't go into the mark of the beast and
[1:03:27] all of her daughters all those
[1:03:29] denominational daughters that thus
[1:03:30] sayith the Lord they'll take the mark of
[1:03:32] the beast there's my hour okay let me
[1:03:34] close I'll close with this one okay now
[1:03:37] that that finishes the third seal then
[1:03:39] the fourth Seal The Pale
[1:03:43] Horse spiritual
[1:03:47] death and now spiritual death has been
[1:03:49] writing brother uh but God sends an
[1:03:53] eagle anointing which is a prophet
[1:03:54] anointing a prophetic anointing
[1:03:57] since 1906 now the saints of God are
[1:04:00] anointed with a prophetic anointing to
[1:04:01] recognize a prophet to receive thus
[1:04:03] sayith the Lord to prophesy again what
[1:04:05] brother Ram's already said
[1:04:07] Hallelujah and then but we go up in the
[1:04:09] Rapture Hallelujah we go up and then the
[1:04:12] Antichrist rides down uh to the battle
[1:04:15] of Armageddon brother BR that's his last
[1:04:17] ride okay so that's actually the
[1:04:19] beginning the seven seal is almost
[1:04:20] simultaneously happening with the fifth
[1:04:22] and sixth at the same time it's almost
[1:04:24] simultaneously but the rapture
[1:04:26] first okay then you have the fifth and
[1:04:28] the sixth and we can spend more time on
[1:04:30] that
[1:04:31] okay oh yeah this yeah this this might
[1:04:33] help too let me go
[1:04:35] here so here's the reality form there's
[1:04:37] the church ages the first seal only
[1:04:39] lasts a little bit of time right just a
[1:04:41] SE a little more plainly take I take out
[1:04:43] everything else then you got the second
[1:04:44] seal lasted that period and then the
[1:04:46] third seal lasted a long time right
[1:04:48] almost a thousand years and now the four
[1:04:51] seal goes into this is you know future
[1:04:53] time like our time like we don't know
[1:04:55] when it's going to end 2025 2026 we
[1:04:57] don't know when it's going to
[1:04:58] last okay but whenever the Rapture take
[1:05:02] place that's the seventh seal or the
[1:05:04] last Mystery
[1:05:06] Begins all everything's going to be
[1:05:08] finished brother Brown said everything
[1:05:09] ends under the seventh seal he said time
[1:05:11] ends under the seventh seal because
[1:05:13] there's only Seven Seals there's not
[1:05:14] eight SEALS or nine seals the seventh
[1:05:16] seal so the seventh mystery has to be
[1:05:18] all that time that's left in
[1:05:22] history
[1:05:24] okay and almost
[1:05:26] simultaneously uh the fist seal sounds
[1:05:28] there it is I was going to say where's
[1:05:29] my fist seal there's my fist seal that's
[1:05:32] the Jews crying out oh Lord when are you
[1:05:34] going to judge us uh or I'm sorry judge
[1:05:35] the world that that uh when are you
[1:05:37] going to avenge our blood and he said
[1:05:39] just wait for a little season what's the
[1:05:40] little season three and a half
[1:05:42] years all right and then you have the
[1:05:44] Sixth Seal which brother says is the
[1:05:45] Tribulation
[1:05:47] seal all right now I don't know why I
[1:05:49] brought that down what is that the
[1:05:50] future home oh yeah future home okay so
[1:05:52] the future home is New Jerusalem after
[1:05:54] all this is done after all the judgment
[1:05:55] after all the tribulation after the
[1:05:57] Thousand Year Millennium the final event
[1:05:59] is the future home coming down where
[1:06:00] Christ and his bride live forever
[1:06:03] Hallelujah okay let's stand on our feet
[1:06:05] musicians can come
