[33:06] open up our Bibles to Ephesians 1 verse
[33:08] 2 love my brother I appreciate it and

[33:31] been a real blessing I'll tell you what
[33:35] I'm how many grown in Christ I sure
[33:37] appreciate it amen and like I was just
[33:39] telling the brother the brothers a
[33:41] testimony back here even last week we
[33:43] had his name was Carlos Rico he's
[33:46] actually a fella who attends the church
[33:50] actually brother Joseph has his name
[33:53] called me said he said hey we got a
[33:55] baptism today so he he brought this
[33:58] Carlos Rico's but Rico buys as a
[34:01] Catholic and a 16 year old kid and and
[34:03] you know he comes out and anyway after
[34:06] service looked like they were he really
[34:08] enjoyed service and then in the back
[34:09] then he came in back after service to
[34:11] get baptized and you know he began to
[34:13] tell me that that you know God had shown
[34:15] him a dream of brother Joseph wearing
[34:17] that yellow tie they and brother Joseph
[34:19] like brother I just bought it yesterday
[34:21] and Carlos Rico had a dream that
[34:25] whenever it was a little bit before that
[34:27] of Joseph being with him with a yellow
[34:29] tie and he said he said and then I was I
[34:31] was around brother Mike he said I seen a
[34:33] guy in my dream with a wheelchair and
[34:36] I'm like well glory to God I said I
[34:37] think God's calling you for something so
[34:39] anyway I started going and preacher mode
[34:41] on him and I just started hitting him
[34:42] and I started nailing the Catholic
[34:44] Church and I was in back in my office
[34:46] nailing with the Catholicism and and
[34:48] just trying hitting some of those things
[34:50] and I looked at him and he was wearing a
[34:53] t-shirt and he had goosebumps all up and
[34:55] down his arms and you could tell him was
[34:57] on his neck and I I stopped him it's
[34:59] cold my office I said I said hey what's
[35:01] what's going on there I said it's kind
[35:03] of cold back I turn on some heat for you
[35:04] he said no he said I in my dream he said
[35:07] you were hitting me up with the Catholic
[35:08] Church so I said well it looks like this
[35:14] is a baptism that needs to happen so
[35:19] keeping their prayers name's Carlos this
[35:21] young young pleasant young man and I
[35:24] believe God's got a plan for him but
[35:25] like I said we've been watching
[35:26] Lord just do phenomenal things and and I
[35:29] believe it's gonna continue and I'll
[35:30] tell you what I'm gonna keep speaking
[35:31] like a son of God because I have we have
[35:35] two brother sister we have to ask for
[35:37] big things we have to be an expectation
[35:39] I'm not talking about Mercedes Benz and
[35:42] and mansions we're talking about Souls
[35:45] we're talking about growing spiritually
[35:47] in Christ and as we'll see tonight we're
[35:51] talking about growing as a church amen
[35:55] let's go to Ephesians 1 2 if we can like
[35:57] I said we appreciate your attentiveness
[36:00] and your desire to come back to the
[36:02] house of God certainly the word is true
[36:04] betters one day in your courts than a
[36:06] thousand elsewhere amen Ephesians 1
[36:09] verse 2 so if the pastor wants to finish
[36:14] things off from this morning they'll be
[36:16] his call and I know he'll do a he'll do
[36:19] a better job than anyway so we
[36:21] appreciate that and Ephesians 1 verse 2
[36:23] says here says grace be to you and peace
[36:25] from God our Father and from the Lord
[36:30] Jesus Christ oh my sweet I pray that be
[36:34] upon us today he says blessed be the God
[36:37] and father of our Lord Jesus Christ who
[36:40] hath blessed us with all spiritual
[36:43] blessings in heavenly places in Christ
[36:49] according as he has chosen us in him
[36:52] before the foundation of the world that
[36:55] we should be holy and without blame
[36:58] before him in love all right by by God's
[37:05] grace notice that's third verse it says
[37:07] who hath blessed us with all spiritual
[37:10] blessings in heavenly places in Christ
[37:14] all right
[37:15] so notice if you're in heavenly places
[37:17] with Christ you have all spiritual
[37:19] blessings let's bow our heads for a word
[37:22] of Prayer as we approach the author or
[37:24] most beloved Jesus Christ our Lord our
[37:28] Savior we're so thankful God for the
[37:30] revelation of this our Lord and as we
[37:33] now humbly come before you now each and
[37:35] every one of us Lord we just pray O God
[37:37] that you give us strength griffiths as
[37:40] he'll tonight as we enter and approach
[37:42] the Word of God you know Lord how just
[37:45] to get a couple services Lord and how
[37:46] the enemy will fight us with fatigue and
[37:49] and try to make us tired and so forth
[37:51] we're just asking Oh God you'd be upon
[37:53] us O God may this word O God may it be
[37:55] something to strike the hearts of the
[37:57] believers Oh God maybe something on God
[37:59] that would take them up higher oh god in
[38:02] their expectation in their
[38:03] understandings of their role in position
[38:05] Lord and may Oh God they see Oh God
[38:08] even their respective churches begin to
[38:10] grow higher and higher Oh God adieu to
[38:13] what you're doing in their lives Oh God
[38:15] we know God it's a it's a bride work in
[38:17] this our Lord so just take each and
[38:19] every one higher add your blessings to
[38:20] the reading of this word I pray Leah
[38:22] give me strength O God as I get ready to
[38:24] minister as well we just love you and
[38:26] ask you to have your way in the precious
[38:28] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[38:30] amen you may be seated
[38:33] keep me in prayer Here I am we ate and
[38:36] we went to eat a giant eagle and I think
[38:39] an eagle walked out there a giant I
[38:41] think it done ain't too much so by God's
[38:44] grace we appreciate the Lord and we'll
[38:46] just get into this thought tonight I
[38:47] think we'll be all right amen but notice
[38:50] here we want to focus on this verse here
[38:54] in Ephesians 1:3 tonight we want to
[38:57] bring this thought if we can the
[38:58] atmosphere of heavenly places all right
[39:01] it's certainly an hour that we're living
[39:03] in our expectation at the house of God
[39:06] amen
[39:06] we didn't come here for former fashion
[39:08] we didn't come here to be seen of men or
[39:11] or to even do a duty to a person or to
[39:14] an individual but we've actually come to
[39:17] join with one another in heavenly places
[39:20] the scripture would say Amen and I want
[39:23] you to begin to work with this heavenly
[39:25] place here and show you what our prophet
[39:28] said about this and tie it in with the
[39:29] word if we can because you know heavenly
[39:32] place it's an expectation you have to
[39:34] have and then God actually calls every
[39:37] individual to be in a place to operate
[39:39] these things and to help bring it forth
[39:41] alright but I want you to see here will
[39:44] take first a little look at atmosphere
[39:47] of that word atmosphere notice the
[39:49] atmosphere of heavenly places
[39:52] and atmospheres the pervading tone or a
[39:55] mood of a place situation or work of art
[39:59] right so notice even in your own life if
[40:02] you begin to delve into carnal things if
[40:04] you're if you're too much you know into
[40:07] work for this or maybe you're too much
[40:10] into a fellowship for your phone or or
[40:12] whatever entertain maybe you'll actually
[40:15] find that you will not have a Holy Ghost
[40:18] atmosphere around you as strong as it is
[40:22] supposed to be all right and the reason
[40:24] why an atmosphere was meant a lot to be
[40:28] pervading all right it was actually
[40:31] supposed to be something to dominate
[40:33] amen and I even this message
[40:36] our prophet brought us into a place that
[40:39] we he told us that each and every one of
[40:42] us we create an atmosphere in it you
[40:46] create an atmosphere that ushers falleth
[40:49] from your life amen
[40:50] people see it remember even brought into
[40:53] a place he said he said notice if you
[40:55] want to be around that people by the
[40:58] atmosphere they create a mitt so people
[41:01] are actually long to be liked or to be
[41:04] with you if you are creating that
[41:06] atmosphere of God a lot of times they
[41:08] meant and why is that you're putting
[41:10] forth the creator of heavens in Earth
[41:12] how could they not want to be in that
[41:16] atmosphere amen hallelujah so notice
[41:20] each one of us gives off an atmosphere
[41:22] whether it's a godly one whether it's a
[41:25] carnal one perhaps it's an atmosphere in
[41:30] this hour earlier to see an atmosphere
[41:31] high this kind of lukewarm this kind of
[41:34] hanging around Amen
[41:35] you know God no owners to be lukewarm he
[41:38] wants us to be hotter called amen and I
[41:40] don't want to be cold I would be hiding
[41:42] it so we can put forth an atmosphere in
[41:45] the house of God that is hot amen amen
[41:50] nice and warm why it's not you're yet
[41:53] you invited a preacher or that you're
[41:55] expecting here for a preacher you're
[41:57] expecting to hear from God himself
[42:00] working by a gift he placed in an
[42:02] individual limit so God will speak to
[42:05] but what he requires atmosphere and
[42:08] let's begin to work with this if we can
[42:11] Ephesians 1:18 here now you're gonna see
[42:15] a characteristic and I'm going to hit it
[42:18] in just a moment here but I want us to
[42:20] notice so we opened up with Ephesians 1
[42:23] there and now we're moving a little bit
[42:24] further down in the chapter and
[42:27] Ephesians 1:18 I like this because
[42:31] remember you're supposed to pray for
[42:32] revelation more than anything else
[42:35] hallelujah we need revelation amen
[42:37] hallelujah not intellectual revelation
[42:40] we need a revelation of who we are right
[42:42] we need a revelation of the two spirits
[42:44] in the framework of the church in it we
[42:46] need to work with stand those and then
[42:49] allow the Holy Ghost to make us an
[42:51] invincible army right so if reasons 1:18
[42:54] it says the eyes of your understanding
[42:57] being enlightened huh so we all have
[43:03] eyes but notice these eyes of your
[43:05] understanding okay what do you perceive
[43:09] the word to be and Paul says he says let
[43:13] the eyes of your understanding be
[43:15] enlightened that he may know what is the
[43:19] hope of his calling right what's his
[43:24] calling for us right and what the riches
[43:27] of the glory of his inheritance in the
[43:30] Saints all right there's an inheritance
[43:34] that the church has amen we already know
[43:36] what the down payment of the inheritance
[43:38] is and that's pretty good to begin with
[43:41] in it he couldn't have gave us anything
[43:42] later than the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[43:45] amen that's what he called us to but
[43:48] notice here he said and what is the
[43:52] exceeding greatness of his power to us
[43:55] word who beneath there is an exceeding
[44:00] greatness of power that is available to
[44:04] those who believe now according to our
[44:07] power no but according to the locking of
[44:10] his mighty power amen now notice he says
[44:15] which he wrought in Christ all right so
[44:18] he brought
[44:19] this fourth in Christ when he raised him
[44:21] from the dead
[44:24] so notice and set him at his own right
[44:29] hand in the heavenly places
[44:33] so when Christ raised from the dead and
[44:36] was set at the right hand of God or the
[44:39] power and authority of God he went to
[44:42] air heavenly places but notice when he
[44:46] delivered to the church verse 19 the
[44:49] greatness of his power that came forth
[44:53] when Christ said what all power in
[44:57] heaven and earth is given to me amen so
[45:01] all that Christ is is now given to the
[45:05] church right it's over play with
[45:07] rotisserie times but yet so true all
[45:09] that the father was he poured into
[45:12] Christ and all those in Christ was
[45:15] poured into the church all right so here
[45:20] Christ is sitting in heavenly places
[45:24] it says far above all principality and
[45:29] power and might and Dominion oh don't
[45:32] you love him and every name that is
[45:35] named and not only in this world but
[45:38] also in that which is to come you
[45:44] realize he's far above every
[45:46] principality in power right now it's not
[45:51] just then oh I hope we get far enough
[45:53] I'm gonna show you some things that all
[45:55] right but notice he says and hath put
[45:58] all things under his feet and gave him
[46:02] to be the head over all things to the
[46:06] church
[46:07] brother Jesse's not running this church
[46:10] he was given the position of stewardship
[46:13] as the pastor of this church but leading
[46:16] my brother here is the Lord Jesus Christ
[46:20] amen hallelujah and that means that he
[46:25] that is all-powerful omnipotent risen
[46:28] from the dead and
[46:30] yes everything under his feet is leading
[46:33] this church ma he says he's given him to
[46:39] be head over all things to the church
[46:40] which is his body the fullness of him
[46:42] that filleth all and all the head over
[46:46] all things to the church which is his
[46:48] body the fullness of him that filleth
[46:50] all know that means his fullness is
[46:53] right here he's in our midst
[46:55] I like how your prophet would say said
[46:59] he said the Holy Ghost moving moving up
[47:03] and down the aisles wooing you realize
[47:06] by the sister this might sound a little
[47:09] bit much to you but it's not you realize
[47:12] if if that prophet was given a spiritual
[47:14] eye he could see a black shadow over
[47:16] someone there's black shadows today they
[47:20] don't leave and you realize that that
[47:24] same time it he could look and see a
[47:25] light that light is still here
[47:32] hallelujah
[47:34] are they about three years going to
[47:35] church huh I was just in the back I
[47:37] wouldn't even preaching at night and a
[47:38] brother was up there is preaching oh hey
[47:41] and I was and I was just worshippers at
[47:43] a bad house on my feet and I was having
[47:46] a good time in the house of God and all
[47:49] of a sudden I looked at that preacher
[47:51] and I'm like you got to be kidding me
[47:52] and I looked at Mike I must be dazed and
[47:55] I looked and there's a pillar fire right
[47:58] by him and I look at it me I had to do
[48:02] the double take I was in the back so I
[48:04] didn't nobody see me that's probably
[48:05] pretty good I look nice and I said well
[48:08] that's right over the preacher and I
[48:09] kind of this did it did kind of like my
[48:11] eyes to make sure I was seeing I'm
[48:13] saying and I said and it was right over
[48:15] it was right between the preacher and
[48:18] brother Dave and I was sitting in the
[48:19] back and I looked and I said God if
[48:21] that's there I should be able to move so
[48:22] I moved to my side and I looked and it
[48:24] was right above brother Dave's right
[48:25] shoulder but oh well so I told him I
[48:30] think I hope he feels good now but I
[48:33] seen that pillar of fire I thought of I
[48:35] said well you know what that same right
[48:37] that same pillar of fire that same Holy
[48:40] Ghost he
[48:41] comes in our myths hallelujah and
[48:45] tonight I want to get us into what that
[48:48] means all right so notice what is before
[48:51] us right now so we have to see the
[48:53] initial principle it was Christ our
[48:57] husband
[48:58] what now he's working in his bride but
[49:01] what he is sitting in heavenly places so
[49:04] I wonder if he's called his church to be
[49:06] in heavenly places what does that mean
[49:10] let's go so in 63 Christ is mystery of
[49:14] God revealed he says how do you get into
[49:16] Christ Jesus knows Christ mystery of God
[49:18] revealed here a very powerful message by
[49:21] joining church congregation says no they
[49:23] had that much we know better net Amen it
[49:25] says by a verse it says by one spirit
[49:28] first Corinthians 12 we're all baptized
[49:31] into one body see he said alright that's
[49:34] the one he's talking to that eight
[49:36] addressed to the outside world we can't
[49:39] talk to the sinner on this because he
[49:43] knows nothing about it Paul didn't
[49:45] address it to no sinners he said this is
[49:47] so that group that's that's in Christ
[49:50] Jesus
[49:51] he says grace be unto you and peace from
[49:53] the God our Father and from the Lord
[49:54] Jesus Christ blessed be the God and
[49:56] father of our Lord Jesus Christ who has
[49:58] blessed us with all spiritual blessings
[50:00] we're about in heavenly places in Christ
[50:05] now look at this heavenly places oh how
[50:09] I wish I had time well I got time to
[50:13] take tonight today going what he said
[50:15] about it here I've got it marked right
[50:18] here my Bible about heavenly places what
[50:21] years heavenly places heavenly places
[50:24] just for a moment is the believers
[50:28] position in Christ in heavenly places
[50:34] according us here chosen us chose us in
[50:37] him before the foundation of the world
[50:39] so notice he works with the baptismal
[50:41] goes how were born in that body that way
[50:43] and then he says what he says heavenly
[50:46] places that is the believers
[50:49] in Christ you are position right now it
[50:55] doesn't change when you go from morning
[50:57] service the night service or from night
[50:59] service the wednesday service you are
[51:01] position being born again by the Holy
[51:05] Ghost is a position to dwell in heavenly
[51:08] places
[51:10] oma I wonder let's take a look but
[51:15] notice he ties it in with the Holy Ghost
[51:17] and let's find a good and a good place
[51:20] for this to be at so notice here a Holy
[51:23] Ghost atmosphere in acts 2:1 it says and
[51:27] when the day of Pentecost was fully come
[51:28] they were all with one Accord in one
[51:30] place and suddenly there came a sound
[51:33] from heaven as of a rushing mighty wind
[51:34] and it filled on a house where they were
[51:36] sitting and then appeared unto them
[51:38] cloven tongues like his a fire and it
[51:40] sat upon each of them and they were all
[51:43] filled with the Holy Ghost and began to
[51:45] speak with other tongues as the Spirit
[51:47] gave them utterance hmm Oh to have been
[51:51] there though we're here
[51:55] 63 remembering the Lord he says did he
[51:58] notice on the day of Pentecost what a
[52:02] great thing we have there that God who
[52:05] led the children of Israel through the
[52:08] wilderness he that great pillar of fire
[52:11] and on the day of Pentecost this great
[52:14] fire fell and then divided itself among
[52:18] his people all to think that he wants us
[52:21] to sit together in heavenly places each
[52:25] one of us enjoying that walks of the
[52:28] fire of the Holy Spirit amen that warmth
[52:31] is here right now
[52:34] cloven tongues set upon them like fire
[52:37] lips of fire God dividing his self
[52:40] amongst the church oh my he said all
[52:44] wouldn't that though just set a heart's
[52:46] burning notes that's when we can come
[52:49] together in heavenly places Oh mom so
[52:55] every time notice from the original in
[52:58] Christ's resurrection he said when we
[53:00] get together and the
[53:02] holy ghost is among us and that warmth
[53:04] that precious feeling of the Holy Ghost
[53:07] surround us he said there how many
[53:09] places is ma I got a little picture for
[53:14] you ain't gonna do it no justice but I
[53:16] want you to look at it
[53:18] heavenly places now let me ask you of
[53:23] course we see our four creatures here
[53:25] scripture says it remember they're
[53:27] around just around the throne just like
[53:29] just like they were around the ark and
[53:31] so forth and we got your elders and
[53:34] there's the throne heavenly places now
[53:39] let me ask you I want this to really
[53:45] soak in do you realize that you should
[53:48] be here right now now we're quiet he
[54:00] said that if we get like the original
[54:05] this is what some in our midst he said
[54:09] you've now what come into a heavenly
[54:11] place and understand this would it be
[54:14] heaven if it was just for beasts around
[54:16] you know would it be heaven if 24a
[54:19] elders or or perhaps just just some of
[54:24] the the Majesty's of the throne and
[54:26] everything was around you would that be
[54:27] heaven there's really only one heaven
[54:30] it's a person hallelujah there's only
[54:34] one place of rejoicing hallelujah and
[54:36] that is when God Himself seats himself
[54:39] in your midst amen
[54:42] you see a lot of times we come into this
[54:46] place and we say okay we're here at
[54:48] church but do you realize that the
[54:51] scripture said we're setting together in
[54:52] heavenly places
[54:54] now I'm gonna bring a couple little
[54:56] tidbits here in just a moment here
[54:57] because I want you to see this I want
[55:00] you to see this now now he begins to
[55:02] tell us about heavenly places and I want
[55:04] you to see this as beautiful 61 true
[55:06] Easter seal he says now we are sitting
[55:08] together in heavenly places in Christ
[55:10] Jesus
[55:10] he said now we realized that Jesus the
[55:12] body of Jesus was
[55:15] up from the resurrection he's read that
[55:16] right he said now we know that the Bible
[55:19] speaks of three heavens we know it first
[55:24] heaven second heaven and third heaven I
[55:26] believe it was Paul caught away into the
[55:30] third heaven and seen things that wasn't
[55:33] expedient for him to speak of them Omaha
[55:36] now notice he said no the first heaven
[55:39] is called in the scripture like the
[55:41] clouds all right just like the
[55:43] atmosphere right
[55:44] in other words down below here on the
[55:49] earthling seal now notices when that
[55:55] atmosphere from above up in above clouds
[55:59] become down into into the church that's
[56:05] a heavenly place
[56:08] now notice then he of course what he's
[56:10] doing he denotes what the second and
[56:13] third are he said the second heavens is
[56:14] considered the solar system and the
[56:16] third heaven goes beyond that there's
[56:21] three heavens we were around one right
[56:26] somebody correct the preacher in our
[56:31] natural beings we're here in the clouds
[56:34] in the atmosphere around us there's your
[56:37] first heaven the second heaven is watch
[56:39] space and then the third heaven is what
[56:43] in the dimension of heaven itself now I
[56:49] want you to see this because you have to
[56:51] believe this and expect it your prophet
[56:54] says that you can actually get that
[56:59] atmosphere from up above the clouds and
[57:03] it comes down into the church he said
[57:08] that's a heavenly place do you realize
[57:13] how God position you as a believer he
[57:18] actually made a Christian a true Holy
[57:21] Ghost filled Christian to be able to
[57:26] transform God himself
[57:28] and bring down an atmosphere of the
[57:31] heavenlies right into the midst of a
[57:34] service
[57:34] he made you into a place where you can
[57:39] do that how we doing you see what our
[57:48] expectation how we change our
[57:50] expectation of the church because you
[57:51] notice how he talks about this he's
[57:53] always talking about the church we're
[57:54] sitting together sitting together see
[57:57] that's why your prophet said he said he
[57:59] said we have to make it count especially
[58:01] when we come to the house of God now
[58:08] I'll just go on mourn and I'll get to it
[58:11] but I want you to see here
[58:13] it's your choice it doesn't matter how
[58:16] service has been it doesn't matter when
[58:19] I was like last month or last week or
[58:21] what it was this morning
[58:22] you have the ability if you believe it
[58:25] to draw God out of the heavenlies and
[58:31] bring him right into your midst oh my
[58:35] why do you think they couldn't get away
[58:38] from church you know all these revivals
[58:39] that they have Church every single day
[58:41] why in the world do they have every
[58:42] church every day these because of some
[58:44] discipline or or what is it
[58:46] is it because it was boring when they
[58:50] got into that spirit of revival what
[58:53] they tapped into a resource of how to
[58:57] pull the heavenlies down in their myths
[59:00] oh ma that'll make Church put a smile on
[59:03] your face
[59:03] that'll make one that'll make demons run
[59:06] and in cancer free the building what
[59:09] because heaven is in the mess and Satan
[59:12] cannot dwell there you want to tell me
[59:17] the ideal that God has for Bride of
[59:20] Christ fellowship it's heavenly places
[59:26] he didn't make us so this guy over here
[59:28] has to be here he made you with all the
[59:31] potential do it even if there's three or
[59:32] four of you here memory of prophesied he
[59:34] said some of his greatest means was this
[59:36] a couple people
[59:40] for some true believers that go her to
[59:43] God we say well we don't know we're okay
[59:47] we don't need it that kind of atmosphere
[59:49] in our mess well your prophet says in 56
[59:52] supernaturally says he said that's the
[59:54] reason sometimes a divine life that's
[59:57] been called and set aside has become a
[59:59] fanatic or crazy or I missed it or
[1:00:02] something to the eyes of the general
[1:00:05] public is because you're considered I'd
[1:00:08] say an Iraq an insane person hey you
[1:00:13] know I look like insane I look insane
[1:00:15] the message people sometimes you'll see
[1:00:17] some looks I get sometimes and I'm
[1:00:20] sitting here and I'm like man God have
[1:00:21] mercy help me come however I've seen God
[1:00:25] do stuff and I'm telling you what I'm
[1:00:26] gonna believe for more we have to this
[1:00:32] is the atmosphere he's called us to in
[1:00:36] one scripture I get I'm gonna hit you at
[1:00:37] the point okay so notice he said is
[1:00:41] because that you've changed your
[1:00:43] dwelling place and got into a different
[1:00:47] atmosphere and your own motive your one
[1:00:52] thoughts is to stay in that atmosphere
[1:00:57] brother Branham was living in an
[1:01:00] atmosphere where all his only thought
[1:01:04] was to stay in that atmosphere notice
[1:01:11] well it was just for the profit oh wait
[1:01:14] what about that hidden little plan of
[1:01:15] the Messiah any person that ever come
[1:01:20] into that atmosphere one time will never
[1:01:24] be satisfied nowhere else and that's why
[1:01:29] I believe that we should have our
[1:01:32] churches under control by the Holy Ghost
[1:01:37] that men and women in their work and
[1:01:40] wherever they should be should
[1:01:42] continually desire and they will
[1:01:46] I will force you to love God your
[1:01:49] preacher don't have to force you to come
[1:01:50] to church you come to church because you
[1:01:53] love God amen and he loves you he first
[1:01:56] loved you a men should continually
[1:02:01] desire they will if they've ever once
[1:02:03] come into you can't be satisfied out of
[1:02:12] that atmosphere of the Holy Ghost
[1:02:14] you see it's good when you live there
[1:02:17] with a personal feeling but I'll tell
[1:02:19] you what you get a group of believers
[1:02:20] with a personal feeling
[1:02:21] Fillie hallelujah that's like we're
[1:02:25] saying earlier that that that's when you
[1:02:27] get to a place that when you have to
[1:02:28] leave that a presence you have some
[1:02:30] tears well up because you're not just
[1:02:32] leaving individual you've even God
[1:02:36] hallelujah notice once again Ephesians 2
[1:02:46] verse 4 are you noticing a familiar book
[1:02:50] that we're actually pulling from every
[1:02:51] time here glory hallelujah
[1:02:56] Ephesians too far he says but God who is
[1:02:59] rich in mercy for his great love
[1:03:04] wherewith he loved us
[1:03:08] remember what mercy is there's no other
[1:03:11] word in the English language like mercy
[1:03:15] the closest word to Mercy is grace but
[1:03:19] grace is only unmerited favor mercy
[1:03:24] completely supersedes grace because
[1:03:27] mercy is actually when you hurt and
[1:03:30] injure someone and they still turn
[1:03:34] around and look at you and say I accept
[1:03:35] you rich in mercy why do you think could
[1:03:46] look at Paul after he's consenting to
[1:03:48] Christians death and he said knock him
[1:03:51] off he loved him enough that he brought
[1:03:53] a pillar of fire his way and knocked him
[1:03:55] off a horse
[1:03:57] ah I knew you and said I've called you
[1:03:59] to this work go down to Joppa holiday
[1:04:02] Riya I start feeling good I'll tell you
[1:04:06] if he since 2 5 so notice he loved you
[1:04:10] even when we were dead in sins hath
[1:04:16] quickened us together with Christ by
[1:04:21] grace ye are saved so notice when you
[1:04:28] are dead in sin he quicken you he
[1:04:33] quickened us excuse me together with
[1:04:37] Christ what is moving into his perfect
[1:04:41] picture for the sister we're moving what
[1:04:45] to the plan of his election that's why
[1:04:50] you're in the right place that God
[1:04:51] ordains you to be that's why that these
[1:04:54] things don't happen by chance but God
[1:04:57] has a purpose and a mission and he will
[1:05:00] live it out amen notice 6 verse so by
[1:05:07] grace you're safe he quickened you
[1:05:09] together when you were dead and what and
[1:05:13] hath raised us up apart you go over here
[1:05:20] you go over here he's raised us up
[1:05:25] together and made us sit together in
[1:05:31] heavenly places in Christ Jesus so what
[1:05:39] do you do
[1:05:40] he has brought you to the position that
[1:05:43] he's made you sit together in heavenly
[1:05:45] places in Christ Jesus no I want to stop
[1:05:49] here for a moment
[1:05:50] have you noticed three times we come
[1:05:53] twice out of Ephesians one heavenly
[1:05:56] places again heavenly places now we come
[1:06:00] to Ephesians two heavenly places you
[1:06:03] know what makes this distinct you
[1:06:05] realize the joining of heavenly places
[1:06:08] is only shown four times in the
[1:06:10] scriptures
[1:06:12] do you realize every single time that
[1:06:16] heavenly places is strong together it is
[1:06:20] in the book of Ephesians well what is
[1:06:25] Ephesians Ephesians is the mature church
[1:06:31] Ephesians it did not you realize your
[1:06:34] God could have placed that in
[1:06:36] Corinthians he did not put it in
[1:06:38] Corinthians but he placed it right in
[1:06:42] Ephesians they could handle the mature
[1:06:46] they are getting in line of the Holy
[1:06:48] Spirit and that's something all the
[1:06:52] gifts that are made known in Corinthians
[1:06:54] and here he couldn't even tell
[1:06:56] Corinthians he had to bring it out to a
[1:07:00] church that is sitting there in the
[1:07:02] maturity of the word remembering things
[1:07:06] in church shorter in 63 year prophets
[1:07:08] said he said that one
[1:07:09] he said Ephesians he said God didn't
[1:07:12] have to correct Ephesians about the
[1:07:14] gifts they already had them in order
[1:07:17] Corinthians was the one who have an
[1:07:19] issue with that but remember you go in
[1:07:22] the scripture you read about Corinthians
[1:07:24] and remember they come to Corinth and
[1:07:27] God told I believe as Paul he said I
[1:07:29] there's many souls that are in this
[1:07:31] place but you look at Ephesians it was
[1:07:35] just a lot of small pulling out I don't
[1:07:40] mind having a small church it's alright
[1:07:43] I'll take each man his own right not to
[1:07:48] do it in a small church of five people
[1:07:50] he can do it a thousand amen
[1:07:52] but it's our expectation and what we're
[1:07:56] dealing with the learned that is sown in
[1:07:58] our midst amen remember we're not just
[1:08:01] years of the world we're dealers of the
[1:08:03] word so to the mature church Christ
[1:08:10] could raise them up and make them sit
[1:08:12] together in heavenly places well could
[1:08:16] you tell me a little bit more about it
[1:08:17] sure will
[1:08:20] so 6312 one and absolutely says he says
[1:08:23] now you see we are not a divided people
[1:08:25] we got to be in unity because each one
[1:08:29] of us holding a part of God how many
[1:08:32] believe you're holding a part of God two
[1:08:35] of you board of God amen
[1:08:37] all right for haneda gotta feel good
[1:08:41] [Laughter]
[1:08:44] that's how we do a lot of times let's
[1:08:46] make sure we're all paying attention
[1:08:47] doesn't make sure our going forward amen
[1:08:49] hey you know I just read the quote your
[1:08:52] prophet was talking he said he said it's
[1:08:53] a devil that comes and tries to make you
[1:08:54] fall asleep in the service you getting
[1:08:58] tired yeah say no devil no go do I need
[1:09:09] to go back to that picture of the of the
[1:09:11] four beasts in the throne how many times
[1:09:16] you think I'm four beasts are falling
[1:09:18] asleep right there and get wore out see
[1:09:24] but here's the thing this is the
[1:09:28] revelation we're coming to you Satan is
[1:09:30] not allowed in our services I'll tell
[1:09:34] you what if if God could anoint Paul to
[1:09:39] preach all day and make tents at night
[1:09:43] there's enough God in this hour that we
[1:09:45] can go I know hey I am I am there right
[1:09:49] with you tell you I got my own strategy
[1:09:52] a lot of times I've if I start getting
[1:09:54] tired and I'm not preaching I got to
[1:09:55] stand up it helps a preacher to because
[1:10:00] I think they got an extra Amen Corner
[1:10:01] out there over the cod Alleluia but we
[1:10:07] all avoid then overcomers they met so
[1:10:12] notice you're holding a part of God
[1:10:14] right here he says we must come together
[1:10:17] and then the pillar of fire is
[1:10:20] manifested in its in the wholeness in
[1:10:23] the fullness of it when his church sets
[1:10:26] together in heavenly places
[1:10:30] then the fullness of the power
[1:10:32] God is in his search what does it look
[1:10:35] like each one of us holding spiritual
[1:10:38] gifts and spiritual offices coming
[1:10:40] together brings that pillar of fire back
[1:10:43] again oh my so when his church gets to
[1:10:50] that maturity and a nice sense of fire
[1:10:54] is coming in the gifts are coming in
[1:10:59] hallelujah don't worry the gifts ain't
[1:11:02] the stopping point to the sister we're
[1:11:03] not stopping we're not stopping there
[1:11:05] we're going back to Eden brother sister
[1:11:06] we'll go do the ritual the third poll
[1:11:10] takes us right back to the beginning
[1:11:12] okay so notice we'll just go to that
[1:11:15] third verse notice what he says he says
[1:11:17] blessed be the God and father of our
[1:11:19] Lord Jesus Christ who has blessed us
[1:11:20] with all spiritual blessings in heavenly
[1:11:23] places in Christ amen so now that you're
[1:11:27] together now that you're joined together
[1:11:30] that spiritual blessings all of them are
[1:11:34] right with us right now that's where we
[1:11:38] take our revelation to anybody need any
[1:11:43] spiritual blessings I'll take care of

[1:13:25] sitting here in a home in the atmosphere
[1:13:27] and the Holy Spirit moving over every
[1:13:30] heart that's been regenerated become a
[1:13:31] new creature in Christ Jesus see that
[1:13:35] now notice he's wanting that for the
[1:13:38] church said oh if we could just be there
[1:13:42] he says all sins under the blood in
[1:13:45] perfect worship with our hands up to God
[1:13:49] and a hearts lifted setting in heavenly
[1:13:52] places in Christ Jesus worshiping
[1:13:54] together in the heavenly places he said

[1:14:09] in Christ Jesus
[1:14:11] see how he distinguishes that see we can
[1:14:16] all say oh oh heavenly places hallelujah

[1:14:20] that heavenly atmosphere you see what
[1:14:25] his presence is so strong you know he's
[1:14:29] there but you know whether sister a lot
[1:14:31] of times it's just his presence is
[1:14:32] unrecognized because he said where two
[1:14:35] or more gathered there I am in the midst
[1:14:37] that means he has to be here so notice
[1:14:42] did he ever sit one like that let me ask
[1:14:45] you when was the last time you sat in
[1:14:47] the service and just weep for joy and
[1:14:50] say God never let me leave here Oh

[1:14:59] let me stay here all night I don't want
[1:15:02] to leave here what would make you want
[1:15:09] to do that see when you've brought down
[1:15:14] from that third atmosphere and brought
[1:15:18] the Lord down to such a place that he's
[1:15:22] dwelling right in the midst of you so

[1:17:32] have a right to I don't have a right to
[1:17:34] control my church do we all understand
[1:17:36] this no man has a right to bring
[1:17:38] humanism into the church hallelujah I
[1:17:42] just seen a quote verses in 54 your
[1:17:44] prophet said he said if it comes to a
[1:17:46] place that we have to draw our youth to
[1:17:50] church with ping-pong and was ill and
[1:17:55] bingo or something like that Bunco or
[1:17:57] something like that something like that
[1:17:59] he said if I had the drawl in the trench
[1:18:01] with Bunco and and ping-pong healthiest
[1:18:04] Bunco it's another thing but he said he
[1:18:06] said if it ever comes to a place like
[1:18:08] that he said we've got to get to the
[1:18:10] altar and get the fire-god and on this
[1:18:12] they met hallelujah
[1:18:16] cuz he said what should draw our
[1:18:18] children to charge the quickening spirit
[1:18:21] of the Holy Ghost that's personal that's
[1:18:28] why I did that
[1:18:29] I got church so what happens once
[1:18:34] heavenly places in your midst go sound
[1:18:36] pretty good already can you add to that
[1:18:38] he'll he did he said then the Holy
[1:18:42] Spirit might fall upon somebody and say
[1:18:46] thus saith the Lord wait a minute you
[1:18:48] mean just brother branham oh boy I
[1:18:50] return ministry scripture oh boy here's
[1:18:53] how close we've been looking for
[1:18:54] no he said it might fall on somebody
[1:18:58] that mean that might mean you who are
[1:19:01] you you you are you are you are you and
[1:19:05] say thus saith the Lord has that ever
[1:19:09] come out of your mouth sure prying
[1:19:12] regards to brother Branham but did you
[1:19:14] know God wants to put you in a heavenly
[1:19:16] place that he
[1:19:17] speaks from your mouth like that to the
[1:19:20] or the church has to keep things in
[1:19:23] order
[1:19:23] but we have to come to a place we have
[1:19:25] confidence in god we trust' the Lord
[1:19:29] hallelujah we just had the Holy Ghost
[1:19:31] for a couple weeks ago her brother stood
[1:19:33] up and never heard of do it for spoke in
[1:19:35] tongues and then interpreted it said
[1:19:42] glory to God
[1:19:44] kind of rough he said he said he said
[1:19:46] this church is gonna have a hard battle
[1:19:48] coming up all right
[1:19:50] oh let's do we're here to find storage
[1:19:58] tanks let's get out of here I'm tired of
[1:20:02] this world nothing awful so the Holy
[1:20:07] Spirit might fall on somebody and say
[1:20:11] thus saith the Lord go to a certain
[1:20:12] place and do a certain thing that's what
[1:20:14] happened to me this morning glory to God
[1:20:16] he said watch it he said happened just
[1:20:19] like that he said see thus saith the
[1:20:20] Lord do a certain thing in a certain
[1:20:22] place watch it happen like that blessed
[1:20:24] us together in all heavenly blesses
[1:20:26] blessings in heavenly places
[1:20:27] watch now before we close on that you
[1:20:34] see how he opened on that he said if all
[1:20:38] of us he said if the pastor's praying he
[1:20:41] said in your praying and the whole
[1:20:43] church is praying getting into the
[1:20:47] spirit letting the Holy Ghost have
[1:20:50] preeminence in his midst in our midst
[1:20:53] that's where we're at notice her last
[1:20:58] verse on Ephesians here talking about
[1:21:01] heavenly places it says Ephesians 3:8 he
[1:21:04] says unto me Who am less than the least
[1:21:09] of All Saints is this grace given oh so
[1:21:14] it will come to the least of us
[1:21:17] hallelujah amen and the church said
[1:21:21] hallelujah
[1:21:24] is this grace unit that I should preach
[1:21:30] among the Gentiles the unsearchable
[1:21:32] riches of Christ and to make all men see
[1:21:34] what is the mystery of this fellowship
[1:21:37] rather what is the Fellowship of miss of
[1:21:40] the mystery which from the beginning of
[1:21:42] the world hath been hid in God who
[1:21:45] created all things in Jesus Christ this
[1:21:48] has been hit and who's he speaking into
[1:21:50] Ephesians the mature church remember
[1:21:54] your prophet said he said there must
[1:21:55] come in Ephesians to this you realize
[1:21:59] the Ephesians word has to be sown but we
[1:22:04] have to become a doer of that word -
[1:22:06] that's why we say Messiah s you are a
[1:22:09] doer of that word so what are you waking
[1:22:14] up tomorrow as a messiah at what are you
[1:22:18] going home mass in just a few moments a
[1:22:20] Messiah at then what do you expect the
[1:22:24] anointing your God to dwell with you O
[1:22:27] God never let me leave you so if there's
[1:22:34] only an intensivist oh there is 10 verse
[1:22:38] to the intent that now unto the
[1:22:43] principalities and powers in heavenly
[1:22:47] places might be made may be known by the
[1:22:52] church the manifold wisdom of God now
[1:23:02] unto the principalities and powers in
[1:23:05] heavenly places might be known by the
[1:23:08] church heaven belongs to you holy people
[1:23:20] by how manifold wisdom of God you
[1:23:24] realize if you feel like you have no
[1:23:27] wisdom you feel like you're dumb you
[1:23:29] think you have a bad personality all you
[1:23:31] do is go to the James run and it says
[1:23:32] let every man ask liberally who has need
[1:23:36] of wisdom and God will give it to you
[1:23:39] look at my core scripture quoted
[1:23:40] perfectly there but here I am saying he
[1:23:42] said ask for wisdom because God will
[1:23:44] give it to you liberally realize that
[1:23:47] well now I thought I got a memorized
[1:23:49] offer or being a quote theologian no God
[1:23:52] said you asked him for wisdom a met in
[1:23:56] there while Solomon did he said God you
[1:23:58] just give me wisdom to rule your people
[1:24:01] and God said you asked for wisdom you've
[1:24:04] asked for a right thing
[1:24:06] I'll give you honor I'll give you power
[1:24:08] I'll be in your midst and I'll blast
[1:24:09] shame it okay I don't know where we've
[1:24:17] been out here geometry algebra let's
[1:24:22] take it a little bit further fifty-six
[1:24:27] divine love he says now notice this
[1:24:31] atmosphere you know that's in the midst
[1:24:34] of us right now how you feel you get the
[1:24:35] joy joy unspeakable folklore yet amen
[1:24:38] hallelujah he said you know you'll be
[1:24:42] crazy to the world when you do that
[1:24:44] because you've come out of that of the
[1:24:46] atmosphere you're in into this other
[1:24:49] atmosphere now look at this when you do
[1:24:52] that God lifts you right up from the
[1:24:56] world and you live in a heavenly
[1:24:59] atmosphere whoo you mean I don't have to
[1:25:05] live in this atmosphere right here you
[1:25:08] mean I can work a job and I can be in an
[1:25:10] atmosphere up here
[1:25:13] well you'll be down here with that
[1:25:15] atmosphere up there now look this is
[1:25:19] powerful
[1:25:19] don't miss this and then to the world
[1:25:21] you're just contrary to what that is and
[1:25:23] this is contrary to the world now what
[1:25:26] you want to do okay what do I want to do
[1:25:29] it says what you want to do is be lifted
[1:25:31] up by Christ into an atmosphere to where
[1:25:35] you are happy and peaceful and then in
[1:25:39] there you create a situation and now
[1:25:46] many times we in churches this may seem
[1:25:48] strange that if you watch this is for
[1:25:50] the church it's for the people so God
[1:25:55] wants you and I to live in an atmosphere
[1:25:58] that were happy and peaceful
[1:26:02] that's that heavenly atmosphere and he
[1:26:07] says when you get yourself out of the
[1:26:10] atmosphere down here that's the press of
[1:26:12] a press event and all the above and this
[1:26:14] carnality and when you get yourself into
[1:26:16] a home in the atmosphere they know what
[1:26:18] you gotta do is be happy and peaceful
[1:26:20] you realize peaceful means that you're
[1:26:23] not worried about anything near is
[1:26:27] peaceful means you're satisfied and
[1:26:29] content in your situation and then once
[1:26:33] you're there he said you can create
[1:26:36] situation wait a minute so you're a
[1:26:39] master of every circumstance then huh
[1:26:42] that sounds familiar I just make that up
[1:26:43] or is that in the message somewhere I'm
[1:26:48] sorry feel good he said the people get
[1:26:53] one another spirit in that something
[1:26:55] instead of getting the Holy Spirit you
[1:26:58] go into a group of people and you watch
[1:27:01] the way that a person acts and them kind
[1:27:04] of them kind people that come into that
[1:27:06] congregation the first thing you know
[1:27:07] they act the same way Shh
[1:27:12] that's something you take on a pastor
[1:27:15] spirit you take on oh well this is the
[1:27:18] brother in the church everybody wants to
[1:27:19] be around and then you watch out and
[1:27:20] everybody starts acting like him I've
[1:27:22] seen it I've seen it where where where
[1:27:23] where where that brother
[1:27:25] everybody's drawn Jimmy's a joker but he
[1:27:27] saw castigating sarcastically jokes on
[1:27:29] everybody hurts people's feelings and
[1:27:30] then you know people draw to that next
[1:27:32] you know this are cast you can that hurt
[1:27:33] everybody's feelings and then and then
[1:27:36] there's no way God in their myths cuz
[1:27:39] the first issues the first brother
[1:27:40] should have got right and got the
[1:27:42] foolish jesting out in the coarse
[1:27:44] jesting and just saw God in peace and
[1:27:47] happiness that's why I'm not much of a
[1:27:54] joker sorry
[1:27:56] used to be that's a sarcastic Joker but
[1:28:00] God told me it's better to not be jokey
[1:28:02] at all you can just be serious and talk
[1:28:04] about the word all right
[1:28:08] hallelujah I'll back to creating a
[1:28:11] situation he said you are he said you
[1:28:14] take a good woman and a bad man he will
[1:28:16] either he will either become a good man
[1:28:18] or her a bad woman in the atmosphere

[1:32:29] interested in those things and if you're
[1:32:34] interested in God and God is your number
[1:32:37] one interest and if you've ever been in

[1:32:43] Ghost being around me I wish I could be
[1:32:46] around him all the time and feel him I
[1:32:48] love feeling the Holy Ghost it's like a
[1:32:55] peace comes over you and any worry or
[1:33:01] doubt just when you get in the presence
[1:33:03] it's like ah but you see what the
[1:33:09] Pentecostals did your prophet said he
[1:33:11] said what they did which was wrong he
[1:33:13] said he said they blew all the steam out
[1:33:15] the whistle they turned it into just an
[1:33:19] emotional affair he said but if they
[1:33:21] would have put it to work
[1:33:23] it would have done great things he said
[1:33:25] but that's why I'm here with the
[1:33:27] Pentecostals oh if there's only some
[1:33:30] more Pentecostals you know by experience
[1:33:33] who might want God like that but notice
[1:33:35] it says he says now we have all powers
[1:33:37] in Heaven's on earth he says now we have
[1:33:39] it not in the Millenium we won't need it
[1:33:45] we got it now he said right now we are
[1:33:50] the sons of God he says what you are
[1:33:53] here or no he says it does not appear
[1:33:55] what we shall be but we know we'll be
[1:33:57] like him so we have all powers in
[1:34:03] heavens and earth right now now we are
[1:34:07] the sons of God he says what you are
[1:34:10] here is a reflection of what you are
[1:34:13] somewhere else
[1:34:15] remember your prophet said that he said
[1:34:17] he said start we is working with the
[1:34:19] theophany and he said he said if your
[1:34:21] evil hear that is what you are there he
[1:34:25] said but if you look like God he said it
[1:34:28] shows that you have a body waiting under
[1:34:34] so notice those who recall he justifies
[1:34:38] is that right those who justified his
[1:34:43] glorified already in the presence of the
[1:34:46] father we have a glorified body wasn't
[1:34:52] that deep I love his movies like that
[1:34:54] but that was - he said all right we'll
[1:34:56] find out whether it's right or not if
[1:34:58] there's earthly tabernacle be dissolved
[1:35:00] we have one already waiting is that
[1:35:03] right
[1:35:03] that's right so right now and what we
[1:35:07] are here is a reflection here what we
[1:35:11] are here is a reflection of what we are
[1:35:13] somewhere else so if your deeds are evil
[1:35:16] I guess it would read it you know where
[1:35:17] it comes from
[1:35:18] you know where your other body's
[1:35:20] awaiting mmm so what do you look like
[1:35:26] over there well what's that doing over
[1:35:30] there see that's in a whole different
[1:35:32] time dimension for the sister a day is a
[1:35:35] thousand years and a thousand years as a
[1:35:36] day what's that like that's when we come
[1:35:39] into the complexities of the Lamb taking
[1:35:41] the book remember in the in the seals
[1:35:44] and your prophet brought it down and
[1:35:45] remember he almost went over and he said
[1:35:48] well answer he said that's not the bride
[1:35:49] in Revelations five and then what the
[1:35:52] Holy Ghost corrected him and said that
[1:35:54] is the bride
[1:35:58] well how are we going to work with us
[1:36:00] all the dimensions I don't know I ain't
[1:36:02] worried about it I'm just worried about
[1:36:03] getting the heavenly one right here how
[1:36:07] did you yeah Philippians 3:20 close
[1:36:10] pretty quick here
[1:36:11] he says flip is controlling who shall
[1:36:13] change our vile body that it may be
[1:36:17] fashioned like unto his glorified body
[1:36:20] boy's body according to the working
[1:36:23] whereby he is able even to subdue all
[1:36:28] things unto himself
[1:36:31] so notice he compares the change of your
[1:36:35] vile body that you're living in right
[1:36:37] now that what it's that it may be
[1:36:41] fashioned like his goof like unto his
[1:36:44] glorious body well how's he gonna do it
[1:36:49] the same power that he's exercising
[1:36:54] right now to subdue all things unto
[1:36:56] himself he is all-powerful at this
[1:37:04] moment and his whole plan realized and
[1:37:08] we said that this morning that not one
[1:37:10] thing is surprising God right now
[1:37:13] everything is happening just like he
[1:37:15] ordained it to happen your condition
[1:37:18] right now is just how he ordained it to
[1:37:20] happen your response to the word is what
[1:37:23] is ordained of God God seen that you
[1:37:25] were gonna do it it's gonna be alright
[1:37:27] yours bod yours body man it's going to
[1:37:29] finish right but we have to stick it out
[1:37:33] sometimes we got to dig in and find a
[1:37:35] little bit we're not sitting in this
[1:37:37] lazy boy predestination we believe they
[1:37:43] are but cry out God raised our faith
[1:37:46] they met little bit further we're gonna
[1:37:52] close 54
[1:37:56] 103 question answers he says just think
[1:37:59] the very Lord Jesus that was back there
[1:38:02] in the days of the Apostles is here now
[1:38:04] and it's just whining up the end of the
[1:38:09] Gentiles a great move
[1:38:11] is going amongst the supernatural
[1:38:14] believers because we believe that God is
[1:38:15] here wait a minute
[1:38:17] why is that great supernatural move
[1:38:20] among the believers because they believe
[1:38:23] that God is here
[1:38:31] what if Jesus Christ appeared right
[1:38:33] before you right here what would that do
[1:38:35] to you
[1:38:39] would you be sitting here like this we'd
[1:38:42] be sitting here like this it struck me
[1:38:49] as inspiration at home they sung that
[1:38:52] song I can only imagine what it will be
[1:38:56] like have heard that song right now but
[1:39:01] anyway he said the song goes what will
[1:39:05] we do in your presence what we're saying
[1:39:06] when we dance what are we gonna do in
[1:39:08] your presence and that's what's gonna be
[1:39:10] likely that when I'm in heaven rather
[1:39:13] imagine what's gonna be like in heaven
[1:39:14] cuz we're heavenly places right now
[1:39:17] that's why your promise said what you
[1:39:19] are here is what you will be over there
[1:39:23] if you love God here you're gonna act
[1:39:26] like you love God here if these are
[1:39:28] first up here you're gonna act like he's
[1:39:30] your first love here and then God is the
[1:39:33] primary object of worship for our hands
[1:39:36] for miles for our body for a fee for
[1:39:40] everything we are God is desiring to get
[1:39:44] the ultimate expression of worship from
[1:39:46] our bodies and I say Amen so look at
[1:39:53] this he says the supernatural move is
[1:39:56] here because we believe God is here huh
[1:39:59] that's all it takes just think you're
[1:40:03] glorified bodies right here at the
[1:40:05] Tabernacle now the present
[1:40:11] of the Holy Spirit which is your
[1:40:15] glorified condition see you're a part of
[1:40:19] him
[1:40:22] see it's all polling from what he is it
[1:40:27] can't be outside of him look at this
[1:40:30] your glorified in Christ right now this
[1:40:33] is your lovers those who he justified he
[1:40:36] glorified and your own glorified body is
[1:40:40] standing near you right now in Christ
[1:40:44] Jesus to give to you
[1:40:48] a strength like a charge going into a
[1:40:52] battery I thought we see a couple
[1:41:05] batteries charging you see the Holy
[1:41:10] Ghost was such a reality to this prophet
[1:41:12] that he said he's right here he likened
[1:41:15] it is the same essence of your glorified
[1:41:17] body he says right here and sister
[1:41:29] wedding knowing that the Holy Ghost is
[1:41:30] not not just in her but near her
[1:41:35] she's feel a little tired she said Lord
[1:41:40] I mean do we believe this or not
[1:41:47] is this some fictitious story so we got
[1:41:51] to come to a place that we believe this
[1:41:52] and by faith we activated and he likened
[1:41:57] that to your own glorified body the Holy
[1:41:59] Spirit be near you and he said it
[1:42:02] charges you like a battery he said the
[1:42:04] Holy Spirit's in you it's the charge
[1:42:06] your body to give you new strength to
[1:42:10] heal you from sickness sickness that
[1:42:12] you've got and to make you with but
[1:42:17] notice this is the problem right here
[1:42:21] God is here
[1:42:26] whether you can feel him or not he's
[1:42:29] here Millia prophesied he said the Holy
[1:42:33] Spirit is more real in this room than
[1:42:37] you and I are he said we are just a
[1:42:39] shadow here I'll watch it on YouTube
[1:42:52] aren't they oh so you see what it is
[1:43:01] whatever your need is you don't have to
[1:43:05] wonder I wonder if I can have that today
[1:43:09] well you have to believe you have to
[1:43:15] believe I was just telling I just
[1:43:18] preached it on Wednesday maybe it's
[1:43:20] Wednesday before there but brother
[1:43:21] Branham told him in perfect faith he
[1:43:23] said there's only one thing left to this
[1:43:25] generation he said and that's just to
[1:43:31] belief one thing left what is it to
[1:43:38] believe I believe it because what if
[1:43:50] you're low on strength the new strengths
[1:43:53] right next year you got to believe it I
[1:43:57] didn't tell you say all day long I can
[1:44:00] read this quote all day long but you
[1:44:01] have got to believe it you got to
[1:44:04] believe you're a child of God you've got
[1:44:07] to believe he loves you and you love him
[1:44:10] and what how could he stay away from you
[1:44:13] you are his bar
[1:44:17] one more after this Ephesians 3:20
[1:44:20] he said now under him oh Jesus three
[1:44:24] again here we go it says now to him that
[1:44:26] is able to do exceeding abundantly above
[1:44:29] all that we ask or think there's not one
[1:44:35] thing that you can think of that God
[1:44:38] cannot do it can't go above what his
[1:44:41] abilities are you can't even ask it
[1:44:47] you can't think it but if you ask it out
[1:44:49] of his will
[1:44:50] ain't gonna happen so I'm saying if God
[1:44:55] puts you in front of the water hole and
[1:44:57] you need to walk across you just do what
[1:45:00] he tells you to do according to the
[1:45:11] power
[1:45:12] oh boy oh boy he handlers under him
[1:45:19] let's read the whole thing under him
[1:45:21] that is able to do exceedingly abundant
[1:45:23] above all that we ask or think according
[1:45:25] to the power that worketh in us
[1:45:32] you see that's why he can charge you
[1:45:35] like a battery that's why all things are
[1:45:39] possible that's what Christ told them
[1:45:41] why does the power that's working in you
[1:45:46] is greater than anything you could ask
[1:45:48] or think
[1:45:51] mature church and I'll tell you what if
[1:45:59] you got a revelation of that you'll live
[1:46:01] 3:21 out to you it says under him be
[1:46:03] glory in the church by Christ Jesus
[1:46:05] throughout all ages
[1:46:07] whoa without end amen close right here
[1:46:23] ever-present water from the rock he says
[1:46:25] when we die our souls will go under the
[1:46:27] altar of God
[1:46:28] where else privileged to see a few
[1:46:29] morning's ago as you know in the vision
[1:46:31] where the Bible speaks of our spirits
[1:46:33] we'll go to God who give it our bodies
[1:46:37] shall return to the dust of the earth
[1:46:39] but Sumner where the scripture is
[1:46:43] fulfilled our spirits will be released
[1:46:47] from God we'll pick up the soul and the
[1:46:52] soul to the body and the power that'll
[1:46:56] raise us up is right in us now we are
[1:47:05] now in heavenly places we are now in the
[1:47:10] power of the Resurrection if there
[1:47:12] wasn't or loyalty that sons and
[1:47:15] daughters of God would create them a
[1:47:18] world out here and don't live a private
[1:47:20] life on it and the church says Amen God
[1:47:28] knows you probably thought it 15 times -
[1:47:32] I'm honest you ha you have the power in
[1:47:37] you to do it if you've got a shadow of
[1:47:44] the power of God in you a shadow of it
[1:47:51] to create another world go live a
[1:47:54] private life
[1:48:00] a little bit of shadow he said you got
[1:48:10] power to do it God is omnipotent see
[1:48:12] what I mean the power that's in you will
[1:48:15] make you could speak a lot of the new
[1:48:17] existence and go live on a hallelujah
[1:48:18] there your that's what power is in the
[1:48:22] church now but it's controlled by a law
[1:48:26] and that law is not keeping a bunch of
[1:48:30] Commandments oh I wonder what's happened
[1:48:33] in the message it's a law of faith jesus
[1:48:38] said all things are possible to them
[1:48:39] that believe and if you can believe it
[1:48:41] whatever God will lead your soul to
[1:48:45] believe that is your every place the
[1:48:52] soles of your foot can set upon by faith
[1:48:55] God gives it to you
[1:48:58] amen it's yours you possess it if you
[1:49:02] can find the key to this law faith that
[1:49:04] opens it to you you see what I mean that
[1:49:07] that power is controlled by if you are a
[1:49:09] son or God or a you are a daughter of
[1:49:12] God that never leaves you it's with you
[1:49:18] all the time but your faith gets away
[1:49:21] from it but it's still there let Stan I
[1:49:28] appreciate your attentiveness the design
[1:49:35] the idea I feel like it's the Lord it's
[1:49:39] brought these things to me but how can
[1:49:44] we as believers in the true Word of God
[1:49:48] come to a place that we can show the
[1:49:53] world a living Jesus Christ these signs
[1:49:59] shall follow them that believe
[1:50:01] we will preach the gospel to every
[1:50:04] creature
[1:50:05] but God let it be spirit and truth
[1:50:11] be there I'll tell you about the system
[1:50:13] a lot of my motivation that's rolling by
[1:50:15] and I was telling this to them earlier
[1:50:18] is a brother showed me a he showed me a
[1:50:22] video I didn't watch all of it I watched
[1:50:24] some of it on YouTube but it's all about
[1:50:26] these modern musicians or magicians like
[1:50:29] David Blaine and Criss Angel and these
[1:50:31] guys are just openly working in in
[1:50:33] satanic Satanism and witchcraft and
[1:50:36] they're walking on water they're walking
[1:50:40] up walls they're doing all these things
[1:50:44] turning water into wine you can watch it
[1:50:48] you don't have to cuz they're just a
[1:50:50] bunch of impersonators but it comes
[1:50:52] right back to what brother Branham
[1:50:55] talked about the Messiah message he said
[1:50:56] he said how come that man with that
[1:50:58] mental perverted demon spirit on him can
[1:51:03] look at that glass and focus on it by
[1:51:06] telepathy and make it pop he said he
[1:51:10] said if he could get change into a new
[1:51:13] creature
[1:51:14] he said he'd resurrect the dead I don't
[1:51:19] want a mental faith I don't want no half
[1:51:22] God I don't want no okay oh look at what
[1:51:25] God did with William Branham I thank God
[1:51:28] for that but the movies on the bride and
[1:51:34] what really it just got the fire of
[1:51:37] righteous zeal rolling in me one of
[1:51:41] those magicians they said they said
[1:51:43] Jesus Christ they said see they said
[1:51:46] Jesus Christ wasn't nothing but a
[1:51:48] magician I said here we are anointed
[1:51:54] ones at the endtime Jannes and Jambres
[1:51:56] is coming out where there's a bogus
[1:52:00] dollar bill there's got to be a real and
[1:52:02] I'll tell you I cried at that altar and
[1:52:04] I said God how can we under emphasize
[1:52:10] who you are to this generation
[1:52:13] how can I sit here and say I believe in
[1:52:15] something and the fullness of what it is
[1:52:20] isn't there I'm crying out for I'm
[1:52:24] asking God for it I'm crying to get out
[1:52:26] of this layer to see it is is atmosphere
[1:52:29] and I want to go higher think about it
[1:52:33] there's enough power on the inside of
[1:52:36] you right now you could create a world
[1:52:40] gonna fire what should be in our
[1:52:43] churches right now what should be in our
[1:52:46] expectation you see somebody has to take
[1:52:49] the challenge of this word and be
[1:52:51] inspired and say God
[1:52:52] I'll pray more I'll do what I can but
[1:52:55] only God help me don't push me through a
[1:52:56] pipe but God draw me Lord let me see
[1:53:00] what you have for me open my eyes to
[1:53:04] this reveal we're like we read this
[1:53:07] morning God once men and women to be
[1:53:10] Messiah adds it's a body work we got to
[1:53:15] take it we're either gonna say okay I'll
[1:53:19] wait for next year go say okay God let's
[1:53:22] start me
[1:53:23] Rayette God wants heavenly places right
[1:53:27] here we think is going to transform this
[1:53:31] church my church at home up there for
[1:53:33] the brownies but what's going to
[1:53:35] transform all these places as many
[1:53:39] places God bring your maturity inside of
[1:53:43] me God that's what I look for God that's
[1:53:45] why I long see these quotes
[1:53:47] they'll just stir you right up but I
[1:53:49] don't want to just feel good from a
[1:53:51] quote I want my Lord and Savior
[1:53:54] - woo on me with love never be satisfied
[1:54:01] without him you love God let me say God
[1:54:05] I need more of you and I want that God
[1:54:08] Lord I see all that Lord I realize that
[1:54:10] is what you ordained me to do the
[1:54:13] prophets said this is for the church
[1:54:16] just with that simple defying of gravity
[1:54:20] maybe we could just take a little
[1:54:22] granite he sees the thoughts and says
[1:54:25] your hearts right now
[1:54:27] let's pray our most beloved Lord Jesus
[1:54:30] Christ how he comes all humbly before
