[0:00] by God's grace I was expecting some
[0:02] visitors but it looks like they're not
[0:03] going to be able to make it
[0:05] let's go to Isaiah chapter 11.
[0:10] this morning I met with
[0:12] one of the friends from the Baptist
[0:14] Church and so he said he would try to
[0:16] make it tonight that's okay if he
[0:18] couldn't make it um
[0:21] but we're willing we'll pray for him in
[0:22] a moment as well by God's grace
[0:26] let's go to uh
[0:28] Isaiah chapter 11 verses 1 and 2.
[0:33] like to take a different thought here
[0:35] tonight you know I've been doing a lot
[0:36] of series but I'd like to take the
[0:37] thought on
[0:39] Anointed with the fear of the Lord I'd
[0:41] like to mention that on Sunday about the
[0:44] fear of the Lord like to revisit the
[0:45] fear of the Lords we like to look at
[0:46] that here tonight
[0:48] by the help of the Lord
[0:51] Isaiah 11 verses 1 and 2.
[0:55] here we see the anointing
[0:58] of the fear of the Lord It's a attribute
[1:00] of being Anointed with the Holy Spirit
[1:05] after this we'll read one more portion
[1:07] of scripture but let's read this
[1:08] together if you if you're able to let's
[1:10] read it on three one two three and there
[1:13] shall come forth a rod out of the stem
[1:16] of Jesse and a branch shall grow out of
[1:19] his roots and the spirit of the Lord
[1:22] shall rest upon him the spirit of wisdom
[1:26] and understanding the spirit of counsel
[1:29] and might the spirit of knowledge and of
[1:33] the fear of the Lord so we can clearly
[1:35] see it's an anointing praise God fearing
[1:37] God is an anointing of the Holy Spirit
[1:41] and also let's go to Proverbs 14 26.
[1:53] as I've been studying this topic you
[1:55] know this week I've just felt I think we
[1:57] all need to revisit the fear of the Lord
[1:58] from time to time don't you
[2:00] I know in my life I certainly do that's
[2:02] why I was crying up here at the altar
[2:04] and you know I try to do that every
[2:05] service just Lord search me try me
[2:08] Hallelujah mold me shape me fill me
[2:12] you know that's uh
[2:14] that's what every Christian should
[2:15] Desire by God's grace Proverbs 14 26 and
[2:18] 27.
[2:23] I'll read verse 26 myself and then we
[2:25] can all read 27 verse 26 says in the
[2:27] fear the Lord is strong confidence
[2:30] and his children shall have a place of
[2:33] Refuge let's read verse 27 1 2 3 the
[2:37] fear of the Lord is a Fountain of Life
[2:40] to depart from the snares of death amen
[2:44] how many of you need on there they're
[2:45] hardly like remembered here tonight

[5:21] father and Lord we'll be careful to give

[5:25] lift our hands high to you we'll sing
[5:26] we'll raise our voices to your Holy Name
[5:28] Lord Jesus we ask all these blessings in
[5:30] Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said
[5:33] amen God bless you as you're being
[5:34] seated praise God
[5:38] I'll try to preach about our Lord
[5:40] willing tonight here by God's grace and
[5:42] I'd like to look at Anointed with the
[5:44] fear of the Lord I have a few
[5:48] quotes I'd like to show here
[5:54] you know I looked up in the in the
[5:56] message and brother Branham only
[5:56] mentioned the fear of the Lord just four
[5:58] times you know so
[6:00] um
[6:01] uh you know it wasn't a subject maybe
[6:03] that he hit uh so so much but uh
[6:08] it's all throughout the message you know
[6:10] reverence and respect for God and love
[6:12] for God and humility you know a lot of
[6:14] these uh
[6:15] a lot of these statements of course are
[6:17] very closely related so I would like to
[6:20] look at this here and uh you know we
[6:22] know the word anoint means to rub on you
[6:24] know so if you said I'm anointed uh you
[6:27] know with uh with calmine lotion or
[6:30] something like that you'd rub it on or
[6:31] if I'm Anointed with any type of lotion
[6:33] it's it's something you rub on like I
[6:35] put oil in my hair now my hair my hair
[6:37] is Anointed now with coconut oil you
[6:39] know I know it's silly but that's the
[6:40] truth you know I try not to use all that
[6:42] other stuff
[6:44] well when you're anointed it's rubbed on
[6:46] you so if we go to the spiritual now you
[6:48] know uh
[6:50] we have to be in contact with God if we
[6:52] want to be anointed he's got to contact
[6:53] us right we got to be in contact we got
[6:56] to invite the presence of the Lord the
[6:58] Bible says draw near to God he'll draw
[7:00] near to you praise God so if we want God
[7:02] to rub his Spirit upon us and to
[7:05] minister to us and put his Blessing on
[7:08] our life we've got to draw an eye to him
[7:10] praise God how many know that by the
[7:11] grace of the Lord praise God hallelujah
[7:14] and so we want the anointing of the Lord
[7:16] and we know it comes through fellowship
[7:19] with the Lord so we read our texts here
[7:22] and I actually actually added another
[7:23] text we'll get to that I want to end
[7:24] with that one but what is fear I I think
[7:26] the best way for maybe us to understand
[7:28] it is profound honor
[7:31] uh because that's kind of what Webster
[7:32] says you know if we just look in the in
[7:35] the uh the Hebrew it means morally
[7:38] reverence now morally means you're
[7:40] you're doing what's right that's that's
[7:41] moral no matter who's whose Community it
[7:44] is but we're in God's Community praise
[7:46] God so we know morality is obeying the
[7:49] Commandments praise God
[7:50] now reverence here is this
[7:53] reverence is this honor
[7:56] uh which for us is integrity honesty
[7:58] it's respect
[8:00] so it's moral reverence it's doing
[8:02] what's right with with a sense of
[8:04] reverence with a sense of Honor like I'm
[8:07] going to honor God I'm going to show him
[8:10] uh total respect praise God and this is
[8:14] an anointing as we'll see here we'll get
[8:16] to that here by the grace of the Lord
[8:18] so it's an anointing where you're doing
[8:20] what's right
[8:21] and uh it's in all honesty you're not
[8:25] putting on a show in front of anybody
[8:27] it's it's just complete honesty praise
[8:29] God that's what God loves amen and
[8:31] honest heart a heart that's doing right
[8:33] and a heart that is honest praise God
[8:36] and so you know we want to just take
[8:39] this thought now Anointed with this
[8:41] profound honor for God now of course
[8:44] brother Brown says we should in the
[8:46] message respects we should respect one
[8:47] another we should fear one another in
[8:49] other words brother Brown said I never
[8:50] want to sin and cause the church to
[8:53] think less of me I never want to sin and
[8:55] lose someone's confidence where they
[8:57] don't have confidence in me anymore like
[8:59] a scandal or something or you know
[9:01] something incredibly awful you know you
[9:03] we don't want to never do that
[9:05] um but you know even more so our main
[9:08] objective should be to have fear for the
[9:10] Lord our main honor should be to God
[9:12] almighty
[9:13] and church that's one thing we ought to
[9:14] remember that God is constantly watching
[9:16] us praise God
[9:18] you know I used to be afraid about you
[9:19] know the live stream this was years ago
[9:21] well someone's going to see our service
[9:23] and kind of nervous on Livestream I'm
[9:25] way past that now you know uh but the
[9:28] reality of it was you know is that and I
[9:30] even mentioned it a few years ago is
[9:31] that my whole life your whole life is
[9:34] live streamed before God and the angels
[9:37] praise God and church they don't they
[9:39] don't go to sleep right they're not
[9:41] going to miss something in our lives you
[9:43] know they're God's always watching you
[9:45] know uh and of course not to punish us
[9:47] but he loves us and he wants us to walk
[9:49] on the right path amen Jesus said as
[9:52] many as I love I rebuke and chasten
[9:55] you know sister who I was thinking of
[9:56] your testimony uh this week my wife and
[9:59] I were on a date and I heard Christmas
[10:01] song I started tapping my foot and I
[10:03] instantly thought of your and I said
[10:05] Lord Jesus forgive me you know I thought
[10:07] it was like a snow song or something
[10:08] like that see that's the power of a
[10:12] testimony sister when you share that
[10:13] with somebody else you know it's a real
[10:14] blessing I thought I see I was getting
[10:16] into the wrong you know just I just was
[10:19] in the flesh
[10:20] and I thought oh I need to get back to
[10:22] fear of the Lord I remember what the
[10:24] holy spirit said to you
[10:26] and I thought wow that really brought me
[10:28] back to that like I remember you know it
[10:30] seems so it seems so maybe uh innocent
[10:32] you know just a a song about snow and
[10:35] Christmas it seems so innocent but it
[10:37] actually takes your heart away from the
[10:39] things of God
[10:40] right yeah you know what it came to me
[10:42] it's actually worshiping the creation
[10:45] more than the Creator
[10:46] you know you're thinking about a special
[10:48] time of the year and gifts and trees and
[10:50] snow and which all things we love who
[10:52] doesn't love getting a gift it's a sign
[10:53] of love and we do it you know because
[10:55] Jesus did it for or God give it God gave
[10:57] us the greatest gift you know and who
[10:59] doesn't like snow a little bit of snow
[11:00] you know uh who doesn't like that
[11:03] but the round of it is when we get into
[11:05] that Spirit we forget about the creator
[11:07] of all that
[11:08] and really our whole lives should be
[11:10] worshiped to that Creator praise God
[11:13] and not to worship the creation more
[11:15] than the Creator so I want to just you
[11:18] know just say a moment on this that when
[11:20] we fear the lord we have moral reverence
[11:23] for God
[11:24] we're doing what's right and we are
[11:27] doing an honesty and integrity praise
[11:30] God and church I need this just as much
[11:32] as anybody praise God there'll be no one
[11:34] that receives any Glory equal to Jesus
[11:36] Jesus will get all the glory praise God
[11:39] and you know honestly as I'm getting
[11:41] older you know now I'm 42 and I can see
[11:43] I can easily see how people can have the
[11:46] Solomon Solomon syndrome and how people
[11:48] that even new brother Branham could fall
[11:50] away I could see that because you get in
[11:52] you you get in the routine of things and
[11:54] Things become common and you become
[11:57] tired you know and you become sore and
[11:59] you just you're just getting older
[12:01] and I feel like this too God as we
[12:03] showed a few weeks ago with isolation
[12:05] God will leave us a little bit in our
[12:08] anointing God will leave that anointing
[12:09] in our minds to test us and so we can
[12:11] see what's in our hearts
[12:13] so and he'll do that so he'll show us
[12:15] that we cannot trust in ourselves
[12:18] no matter how many years we've been the
[12:20] message no matter how many years I've
[12:21] been a preacher no matter how many years
[12:23] I've been a father or a teacher or a
[12:25] husband or no matter any of these things
[12:28] God is trying to show us we cannot trust
[12:30] in ourselves we've got to trust in God
[12:32] all the day long praise God all the day
[12:34] long
[12:36] where we live by every word that
[12:39] proceeds out of the mouth of God
[12:41] and so I feel like I need and I think
[12:43] you need a healthy dose of fear praise
[12:45] God the fear of the Lord
[12:48] now here's our text I just think this is
[12:50] a beautiful look at this beautiful
[12:51] picture here in the fear of the Lord is
[12:54] strong confidence so when you're
[12:56] Anointed with the holy spirit of fear
[12:58] you're confident in God
[13:00] because you you're you're you're
[13:01] honoring him you know you're honoring
[13:04] the word you're keeping the word of God
[13:05] so see what's the opposite of that
[13:07] confidence is doubt
[13:10] so if we're not if we're doubting our
[13:12] stand with God it's because we don't
[13:14] have the fear of the Lord we do we
[13:16] displeased the Lord or something like
[13:17] that so I just think it's a beautiful
[13:19] picture
[13:20] when we're confident in the lord it's
[13:22] because we feared him we've we've
[13:24] honored him amen we we've obeyed his
[13:26] word praise God
[13:29] and now the next look at the next verse
[13:31] it's the children shall have a place of
[13:33] Refuge when you're Anointed with the
[13:35] spirit of the fear of the Lord you feel
[13:37] safe in God's arms Hallelujah you feel
[13:41] safe like you're in the secret place
[13:43] like this morning it was raining like
[13:45] crazy right it was raining like crazy
[13:46] and when I finally got into the school I
[13:48] finally got into Panera that's where I
[13:50] met with my friend for the little uh you
[13:52] know counseling session when I finally
[13:54] got in there I was like oh I can let off
[13:56] the pressure now I can I can close up
[13:57] the umbrella I'm not I'm still soaking
[13:59] wet but I'm not going to get any more
[14:01] wet right that you know the school in my
[14:03] in the the restaurant that was my place
[14:05] of safety and that's what it is
[14:07] spiritually when we're obeying the word
[14:08] of God oh I'm I'm walking with God I'm
[14:11] obeying the word of God I'm honest
[14:13] before God I feel safe in God Amen
[14:16] amen it's a beautiful picture beautiful
[14:17] picture
[14:18] of of your our walk with the Lord and I
[14:22] love this this next part it's just
[14:24] beautiful how the Lord places together
[14:25] he's your confidence he's your your
[14:28] place of safety your safety zone
[14:30] the fear of the Lord is a Fountain of
[14:32] Life
[14:34] and the and to depart from the snares of
[14:37] death
[14:38] so when we are fearing God and honoring
[14:41] God it's as if we've just escaped a trap
[14:44] that was set for us
[14:46] and now we're we're away from the trap
[14:49] and we're just drinking Waters at the
[14:51] Fountain of Life
[14:53] so in other words without without the
[14:55] fear of God we're very thirsty we're
[14:57] very thirsty and we're lacking and we
[15:00] feel like we I'll say like this we feel
[15:01] like we're spiritually weak we feel like
[15:04] we're spiritually deprived when we're
[15:06] not walking in the fear of the Lord but
[15:08] when we're walking the fear of the Lord
[15:09] the Lord is our life to us praise God
[15:12] the word gives us uh we enjoy the drink
[15:14] of it praise God Amen we feel alive
[15:17] Hallelujah when we're walking in the
[15:19] fear of the Lord the church said
[15:21] that's the word of God I mean it's just
[15:22] such a beautiful picture
[15:25] Hallelujah
[15:27] and I just wrote a picture that's the
[15:28] guy on Spring you know it's I showed it
[15:30] to you a number of maybe a year ago by
[15:31] now maybe more it's the the spring
[15:34] that's underneath it's a fountain
[15:35] underneath uh Mount Moriah where Jesus
[15:39] was crucified and where uh Simon's
[15:41] Temple was built David's Tabernacle was
[15:43] it's a stream it's a fountain there's
[15:45] water that just gushes through here all
[15:47] the time just flows
[15:49] and here's a picture of it uh here where
[15:52] it's coming out here
[15:53] the guy on Springs so the spring the
[15:56] water just rushes you know
[15:58] and and of course this is where the you
[16:00] know the the Tabernacle was built you
[16:02] have the the city wall the old wall you
[16:04] have the valley here the kids around
[16:06] Valley if I'm not mistaken I could be
[16:07] wrong on that Valley
[16:09] it's been a while since I looked at that
[16:10] part but just again the picture there
[16:13] the fear of the Lord is as a Fountain of
[16:16] Life
[16:17] so when we're walking in honor for God
[16:20] it's like we are at this Fountain and
[16:22] we're getting a fresh drink
[16:24] we're not uh starving we're not dying of
[16:27] thirst
[16:29] we have life we have refreshment amen
[16:33] hallelujah we have everything we need to
[16:35] keep going praise God
[16:37] that's when we're walking in the fear of
[16:38] the Lord
[16:39] it's a beautiful picture of what the uh
[16:42] the scripture
[16:43] gives us an idea what is the fear of the
[16:45] Lord
[16:46] it's this spring where it's constantly
[16:49] flowing
[16:50] Hallelujah there's constant uh there's
[16:52] constant Supply Amen Hallelujah by God
[16:55] shall supply all my needs amen glory
[16:57] according to his riches in glory in
[17:00] Christ Jesus what is Paul saying he's
[17:02] saying Paul is saying I fear Jesus
[17:04] Christ because I fear Jesus Christ it's
[17:07] like a spring and it's like a fountain
[17:09] bringing all that I have need of because
[17:11] I'm keeping the word of the Lord
[17:13] Amen in other words I'm not drinking the
[17:16] devil's wine a writer I'm not drinking
[17:18] I'm not eating at the devil's table
[17:20] but I I'm at the table of the Lord I'm
[17:23] I'm drinking the life of God and I I'm
[17:26] enjoying the presence of the Lord praise
[17:28] God
[17:30] Hallelujah
[17:31] a little bit closer at this verse now
[17:34] so we're taught not to Cast Away our
[17:36] confidence in the book of Hebrews right
[17:39] cast not away therefore your confidence
[17:41] the Bible says
[17:43] so it's equivalent to not losing the
[17:45] fear of the Lord
[17:46] okay and also fearing God is is our
[17:50] hiding place so when we honor God when
[17:53] we obey God it actually gives us a
[17:56] hiding place in God from all the storms
[17:59] of the world
[18:00] from all the all the attacks of Satan
[18:03] all these attacks and all these uh mind
[18:05] battles I'll say like this that's what I
[18:07] was telling my friend this morning you
[18:08] know the Mind battles that's the hard
[18:10] part about it
[18:12] Like You Can Be You Can Be recently
[18:14] saved you can be recently filled with
[18:15] the Holy Ghost you can be recently have
[18:17] a Revival you can have Reese all these
[18:19] recent things but then all of a sudden a
[18:21] storm will come but your hiding place
[18:23] the way you'll get through that is by
[18:25] honoring the word obeying the words say
[18:27] God anoint me with the spirit of fear
[18:29] Hallelujah the holy spirit of fear
[18:33] Hallelujah so we are confident we're
[18:36] obeying the word of God we're keeping
[18:38] the commands
[18:39] this is my safety zone amen hallelujah
[18:42] this is my safety Place Hallelujah where
[18:44] I'm keeping the word of God
[18:48] and we know this but fear is a pre
[18:50] prerequisite rather to wisdom wisdom is
[18:54] the skill at Living the right way or in
[18:56] other words wisdom is living in the
[18:59] perfect will of God
[19:01] it's not walking in a permissive path
[19:03] that would cause pain and heartache and
[19:05] suffering and embarrassment or guilt the
[19:08] devil will try to put on you or
[19:09] something like that it's walking in the
[19:11] perfect will of God
[19:13] that's wisdom and the Bible said it's
[19:15] the principle thing it's the main thing
[19:17] to get on an Earthly Journey so Church
[19:19] wisdom has to be the baptism of the Holy
[19:21] Ghost up there so wisdom has to be the
[19:23] same as love I think I proved that on
[19:25] Sunday as well when I was preaching on
[19:26] Sunday
[19:27] uh because the Bible says that wisdom
[19:29] was with the Lord before the foundation
[19:31] of the world and wisdom was the Lord's
[19:34] daily Delight Amen in other words the
[19:36] the logos was the daily Delight of God
[19:39] Amen the visible manifestation of God
[19:42] moving and creating that was the Delight
[19:44] to the invisible Spirit Hallelujah the
[19:47] invisible father
[19:48] so charity has to be just another name
[19:52] for the wisdom of God because that's the
[19:54] principle that's a principle thing we
[19:57] need on this life Hallelujah
[20:00] oh it's beautiful praise God hallelujah
[20:02] so just so far what we've heard so far
[20:05] the fear of the Lord is your confidence
[20:08] the fear of the Lord is your safety zone
[20:11] the fear of the Lord is your starting
[20:13] place for wisdom and the fear of the
[20:16] Lord is your fountain oh how many can
[20:18] say Amen to that hallelujah amen thank
[20:21] God
[20:22] bye that's just four of them right
[20:25] there's more but this is the ones I
[20:26] could get to today when I started
[20:27] looking at this thought here
[20:29] so again I found this picture online of
[20:30] course another uh I forget what they
[20:32] call them now
[20:34] uh it's quoting Psalm 9 verse 9. the
[20:36] Lord is a refuge for the oppressed a
[20:39] stronghold in the times of trouble so
[20:41] when the enemies bring in waves of of
[20:44] unbelief waves of Doubt waves of
[20:47] sickness
[20:48] waves of of of anger right or waves of
[20:52] fear
[20:54] when we go to obeying the word of God we
[20:57] climb up in the tower the Lord is a
[20:59] refuge right the Lord fearing God
[21:01] honoring God respecting God's word
[21:04] putting God's word above everything else
[21:06] amen hallelujah it's a strong tower
[21:08] praise God it is our refuge it's our
[21:11] safety zone in other words I can say I
[21:13] know I'm saved because I'm obeying the
[21:15] word of God hallelujah
[21:17] I know the devil can't touch my soul
[21:19] amen because I'm obeying the word of God
[21:21] hallelujah oh I think it's beautiful
[21:23] look at these are the pictures God gives
[21:24] us it's the beautiful a fountain of
[21:26] spring
[21:27] a tower a place of Refuge a place of
[21:30] safety
[21:32] Hallelujah
[21:33] the fear of the Lord is a mighty tower
[21:36] praise God so is the name of the Lord
[21:39] now I want to read you're familiar with
[21:41] these but we want to read them over
[21:42] again the fear of the Lord is the
[21:44] beginning of wisdom
[21:46] and the knowledge of the Holy is
[21:48] understanding
[21:50] so again the beginning so our path you
[21:53] know our our journey is we're heading
[21:55] towards wisdom we're heading towards the
[21:57] perfect will of God we're heading
[21:58] towards the best life we could live but
[22:01] the starting place is fear God
[22:03] honor God with Integrity right be
[22:07] morally right be morally in the right
[22:09] know that you've we've done right by the
[22:11] grace of God
[22:12] that's the starting place the first step
[22:14] towards being in that place where we
[22:17] want to be the perfect will of God
[22:19] and wisdom is the principle the first in
[22:22] order of rank thing therefore get wisdom
[22:25] with all thy getting get understanding
[22:28] that's why you know the world the world
[22:30] there's a great move right now you know
[22:32] with uh
[22:33] uh at least in America there's a great
[22:35] move now with just like worldly wisdom
[22:37] like famous talkers like you might have
[22:39] heard of him Jordan Peterson he's a real
[22:41] popular guy now he's not a Christian his
[22:43] wife's a Christian if I'm not mistaken
[22:44] but he gets millions and millions and
[22:46] millions of views because he's just
[22:47] preaching these these these moral
[22:49] principles like men should be men and
[22:50] women should be women and you should be
[22:52] responsible get to work on time just you
[22:54] know simple things right
[22:57] um
[22:59] and they'll pay all kinds of money to
[23:01] get this people will listen to podcasts
[23:02] we talked about that uh you know ebooks
[23:04] audiobooks people listen to all these
[23:06] things and it's not even Christian it's
[23:08] not even a Christian author
[23:10] and and look how the You Know The Enemy
[23:13] the enemy kind of impersonates this with
[23:15] all their work they're trying to get
[23:16] just good moral principles but they're
[23:19] not really getting to the main principle
[23:21] which is Jesus Christ praise God
[23:24] they're getting to these they're
[23:25] learning a wise principles and it's
[23:28] maybe it's no doubt from the Bible if
[23:29] there's anything good it had to come
[23:30] from the Bible First
[23:32] but there in other words they're putting
[23:34] so much effort into just worldly wisdom
[23:36] how much more should we put effort into
[23:38] God's wisdom oh my praise God
[23:42] because it's the principal thing it's
[23:44] the very first thing we must get is the
[23:47] wisdom of God well before we get the
[23:49] wisdom of God we've got to get the fear
[23:51] of the Lord
[23:52] we've got to get the honor of the Lord
[23:53] back praise God
[23:55] Hallelujah
[23:58] now another picture here now that end
[24:01] goal right is wisdom that we're starting
[24:02] with the fear of the Lord we're moving
[24:04] towards the wisdom wisdom is a tree of
[24:06] life to them that lay hold on her and
[24:09] happy is everyone that retains her that
[24:12] tree of life
[24:13] so true happiness will only come through
[24:16] the wise life
[24:18] wisdom comes by fearing the Lord praise
[24:21] God
[24:21] so see we've got to go back to that
[24:23] order it's fearing the Lord that it's
[24:25] wisdom and then it's happiness
[24:28] Hallelujah
[24:29] I think we all want to be happy don't we
[24:33] if we get to our deathbed if the Lord
[24:34] you know the Rapture doesn't happen we
[24:36] want to be able to look back and say I
[24:37] lived a happy life
[24:39] and the only way it can be happy
[24:40] according to the word of God is if we
[24:42] walk we've made decisions with the
[24:44] wisdom of God
[24:46] in other words I made this decision at
[24:47] this time because I knew it honored the
[24:49] Lord
[24:52] right this is years ago I'm going to
[24:53] share this testimony I probably shared
[24:54] it before I think I shared you know
[24:56] maybe a couple months ago but again
[24:59] is there come a time in our church when
[25:00] there you know we had uh our family had
[25:03] a really close family
[25:04] and uh
[25:06] you know the family took a a step away
[25:08] from church
[25:10] they took a step towards business
[25:13] and uh it was at that moment my heart
[25:15] was broken
[25:18] and the way they they took the step was
[25:20] to stop studying the scriptures and and
[25:23] stop coming to Sunday night services and
[25:25] then it wasn't long then Wednesday
[25:26] nights where every now and then
[25:27] sometimes Wednesday nights then
[25:29] sometimes
[25:30] no Wednesday nights sometimes and then
[25:32] then no Sunday nights for sure
[25:35] and at that moment when I saw that it
[25:37] was it was a testing time for me
[25:39] it was uh it was just a like a a
[25:43] like a soul-shaking Time
[25:46] and so I laid at this Altar and if I'm
[25:49] not mistaken it was this altar maybe the
[25:50] other one I just cried out to God and I
[25:52] said Lord I want to choose the right way
[25:55] you know other people are choosing a
[25:57] different way help me to choose the
[25:58] right way what's the right way and
[26:00] during that time I was preaching the
[26:01] church ages and brother Ram gave us that
[26:03] beautiful quote the secret to
[26:05] Christianity is increasing your service
[26:07] to God
[26:09] it's not less service
[26:11] it's more service to God
[26:15] and church that was uh
[26:17] that was
[26:19] the word that I needed at that season
[26:21] and my prayer was Lord I'm going to keep
[26:24] doing the services more services and
[26:26] more fellowship and more time in the
[26:27] word of God I'm not going to change my
[26:29] direction anyway at all I'm going to
[26:31] keep walking this direction because I
[26:32] know this direction honors you
[26:34] they said Lord as of indication let my
[26:37] children receive the Holy Ghost before
[26:39] this other family
[26:40] by God's grace I have numerous children
[26:43] that claim to have the Holy Ghost now
[26:45] time's going to tell like with all of us
[26:46] right as soon as we make a confession
[26:48] what does Satan do he comes he points
[26:50] all of his guns at you
[26:51] right he's gonna he's gonna test you
[26:53] with your confession even when you're
[26:54] saved right like I was talking to my
[26:56] friend this morning
[26:57] he got saved and he said he went through
[26:59] all this he got all these all these
[27:01] attacks I said let Satan try and attack
[27:03] your profession
[27:04] you just said you're a Christian you
[27:06] just said you believe in Jesus Christ
[27:07] you just said you're being saved and all
[27:09] your peace is gone because the enemies
[27:11] attacked you with these mind battles
[27:13] he's trying to get you to forget what
[27:15] happened in your soul praise God
[27:17] hallelujah amen
[27:20] but by the grace of God and I and you
[27:22] know I still talk to this friend with
[27:24] their you know I talked to the friend in
[27:25] the family none of the children in that
[27:27] other family even claimed to have the
[27:29] Holy Ghost
[27:31] none of them
[27:32] but here four or nine or four three or
[27:35] four whatever two or three or four are
[27:37] actually claiming to have the Holy Ghost
[27:40] and to me it's God vindicating that I
[27:43] chose the right path
[27:45] because wisdom is Justified in her
[27:47] children amen I think that's a natural
[27:49] that's actually a spiritual lesson but
[27:50] actually it applies naturally praise God
[27:53] and I know all my children are going to
[27:54] be tested just like I was tested but
[27:56] just like I overcome they can overcome
[27:58] too
[27:59] by the grace of God
[28:00] is my okay
[28:03] okay yeah all right thank you I didn't
[28:04] know if he was sick or something like
[28:05] that I know Chris was battling there
[28:07] with the headache and I didn't know if
[28:08] we need to pray for him or something
[28:09] like that okay
[28:11] Hallelujah
[28:13] so wisdom is this tree of life you know
[28:15] where uh it's a place where we find life
[28:18] and remember there's also life in the
[28:20] fear of the Lord
[28:21] there's life there it's like a fountain
[28:22] it's a life-giving fountain of water but
[28:25] then it leads us to the tree Glory
[28:28] Hallelujah so fear the lord the waters
[28:31] will lead you to the fruit praise God
[28:33] hallelujah
[28:34] and there's just a simple picture now I
[28:36] just typed in Spring and tree right
[28:38] there's something so this this is the
[28:40] waters but look you can't have the
[28:42] wisdom you can't have the fruits you
[28:43] can't have you can't have a tree without
[28:45] the fear of the Lord first
[28:48] right
[28:49] and that's what that's what David said
[28:50] he said do not stand in the council the
[28:53] ungodly so don't take your advice from
[28:55] sinners
[28:57] take your advice from the word of God
[28:59] amen hallelujah thank God Amen
[29:02] I like podcasts like anybody else but I
[29:04] I'd say question everything is that the
[29:06] word of God
[29:07] I like ebooks just like anybody else is
[29:09] that the word of God
[29:10] I talked to my brother different ones
[29:11] about business and all kinds of things
[29:12] and uh
[29:15] I'm just saying like we all have to do
[29:17] this we ought to recognize the fear of
[29:18] the Lord is the waters but here's we've
[29:21] got to be planted By the Waters amen
[29:24] Hallelujah we got to be planted and draw
[29:26] in that fear of the Lord and the Bible
[29:29] says then we'll bring forth our fruit in
[29:31] due season praise God
[29:35] looks like a park we go to right there
[29:37] in Silver Creek doesn't it looks like
[29:38] that one it's got except it's got a
[29:40] bridge over it
[29:41] I just love that I love when you can see
[29:43] the The Roots going right down in there
[29:45] they're just drinking right I mean
[29:46] they're right by the water hey
[29:48] Hallelujah if anybody's if anybody's not
[29:50] going to run out of water it's that
[29:51] fella right and that's how we should be
[29:53] if anybody's going to be a real servant
[29:55] to Christ it should be us amen we're
[29:57] going to stay in the fear of the Lord
[29:59] hallelujah
[30:01] church that's I need a hearty Amen to
[30:03] that as well my whole life Hallelujah
[30:05] all of us and that's what we'll see in
[30:06] the scripture God encouraged us to stay
[30:09] in the fear of the Lord every single day
[30:11] it's going to be a battle but we've got
[30:12] to be willing to fight praise God
[30:14] we must fight to stay in the fear of the
[30:16] Lord and I'm I have to fight all day
[30:18] long too Hallelujah we got to stay
[30:20] planted by the rivers of water
[30:23] so fears on the necessary place you
[30:25] start on your way to the wisdom or the
[30:27] the wise life the perfect will of God
[30:30] and then continually continually fearing
[30:33] the Lord is the driving force for more
[30:35] wisdom
[30:38] so to lose the fear of the Lord is then
[30:40] to lose out on wisdom and what's the
[30:42] opposite of wisdom foolishness
[30:44] right we don't want to be foolish virgin
[30:47] so that's why we got to keep the fear of
[30:49] the Lord honor God obey the word of God
[30:51] God Is Watching I'm reverencing God I'm
[30:53] doing what's morally right amen
[30:55] hallelujah it's my Hiding Place amen
[30:58] it's your hiding place it's your Refuge
[31:01] it's your fountain praise God
[31:04] now how do we obtain fear there's at
[31:06] least three ways you have to hate evil
[31:09] first hate evil you also have to depart
[31:11] from Evil and they have to seek after
[31:13] God's will no doubt there's others but
[31:15] these are the first three I found as I
[31:16] Was preparing
[31:18] all right
[31:19] so Proverbs 3 verse 7 be not wise in thy
[31:22] own eyes fear the lord and depart from
[31:26] Evil Church anytime we convince
[31:28] ourselves and I'm guilty we we sin every
[31:30] day anytime we anytime we convince
[31:33] ourselves it's okay for me to sin we've
[31:35] just taken a step away from the fear of
[31:38] the Lord
[31:40] because the fear of the Lord will make
[31:42] you depart from Evil I know this is
[31:44] wrong I've got to do I have to I have to
[31:46] live differently
[31:47] right I've got to choose I've got to
[31:50] choose differently right each one of us
[31:52] we can't be wise so so that so in other
[31:55] words be not foolish right to be not
[31:57] foolish fear the lord and depart from
[31:59] evil
[32:01] the fear of the Lord is to hate evil so
[32:03] the the very anointing of the holy
[32:05] spirit makes you hate evil when you got
[32:07] that anointing on you you don't want to
[32:09] think wrong you don't want to say wrong
[32:10] you don't want to do wrong you're
[32:11] watching every word you're watching
[32:13] every action praise God
[32:15] you're in that secret place amen
[32:17] hallelujah you're not leaving that
[32:19] secret place you're staying in the place
[32:20] of protection Hallelujah
[32:23] and so then he gives examples see pride
[32:25] when we choose our way we think we know
[32:26] about it arrogancy
[32:29] and the evil way the thrower mouth do I
[32:31] hate
[32:33] see look God hates all these things God
[32:35] hates all sin
[32:37] so we need a fresh anointing of the fear
[32:40] of the Lord
[32:41] Hallelujah I'm right there in with you
[32:43] every single one of us praise God
[32:45] now of course we we ended the service
[32:47] with this on Sunday we see God's will
[32:49] through quiet time with the Lord Jesus
[32:51] Christ the Bible says if you cry after
[32:54] God's word you lift up your voice and
[32:56] you seek in search then you'll find the
[32:58] fear of the Lord now let me see if I got
[33:00] that scripture yeah I do
[33:01] if you seek her as silver and search for
[33:04] her as his treasures then Thou shalt
[33:06] understand the fear of the Lord and find
[33:08] the knowledge of God hallelujah
[33:11] so see it's a seeking you know our life
[33:13] has to be a seeking out
[33:15] you know I was couraging my friend this
[33:16] morning
[33:18] I was telling him you know if you have
[33:20] major mind battles and this guy has some
[33:21] major mind battles so we got to pray for
[33:23] him at the end of the service
[33:25] I said you gotta if you have major mind
[33:28] battles like that like one of them I'll
[33:29] just share with you because some of you
[33:30] know about it brother I mean you know
[33:31] about it night terrors or where the
[33:33] where the enemy paralyzes you remember
[33:34] that
[33:36] I've never had that but I told her I
[33:38] told this this friend I said this is
[33:41] this is a test God allowed it and God
[33:44] wants to see you cry out for deliverance
[33:47] right
[33:49] you know I've had numerous friends and
[33:51] my brother Simon different ones that
[33:52] have had this come upon they can't move
[33:53] and it's it's a fearful thing
[33:57] but it's a great test it's a test of the
[33:59] of the battle of the mind and so God
[34:01] wants to see you cry out you got to cry
[34:04] you got to seek for deliverance amen see
[34:06] God's allowing it so you'll he'll draw
[34:08] you closer to him praise God
[34:10] because we all have struggles we all
[34:11] have trials we all have bad habits or
[34:14] something we all we all need deliverers
[34:15] from something praise God
[34:17] we don't need victory in our lives and
[34:20] so whatever God allows it's always a
[34:22] test to see if we're going to cry out to
[34:23] God do we want to be delivered do we
[34:26] really want to be uh walking the truth
[34:28] and I said then you I said once you get
[34:30] Victory then you got to get up early and
[34:32] you got to transform your mind before
[34:33] everything else
[34:35] I'm gonna get up at 4 30 all week this
[34:37] week I'm a little tired but I'm doing
[34:38] okay I'm starting to go to bed earlier
[34:39] so
[34:40] but I've realized I've if I need more
[34:42] time with God if I'm struggling here
[34:43] I've got to get some time with God and
[34:46] there's no other time any other time so
[34:47] I got to get up early
[34:49] see I gotta seek it like I'm seeking to
[34:52] become a millionaire but it's greater
[34:54] than that it's an eternal Heir that's a
[34:56] new word there
[34:57] Eternal Heir instead of I'm an error I'm
[35:00] an heir of Salvation born of a spirit
[35:01] washing his blood amen I don't want to
[35:03] be a millionaire a millionaire I want to
[35:05] be an eternal Heir praise God Amen
[35:08] different air so not AR or a i r e but
[35:12] h-e-i-r
[35:14] Hallelujah there it is amen hallelujah
[35:17] you know I've seen these videos this
[35:18] week on YouTube and they say they say oh
[35:20] here's the billion dollar mindset
[35:22] here's the million dollar man's mindset
[35:24] you know what that is that's for the
[35:26] that's for the worldly Treasures that's
[35:27] for the foolish things of the world but
[35:29] the real mindset is seek God first amen
[35:32] seek God and you'll find then you'll
[35:35] understand the fear of the Lord then
[35:36] you'll find the fountain amen hallelujah
[35:38] and if you've seen that fountains and
[35:40] then you'll find the tree of life amen
[35:42] hallelujah the Eternal Heir Hallelujah
[35:45] I'm an heir of Salvation purchase of God
[35:48] born of a spirit washing his blood amen
[35:51] they'll play on words there praise God
[35:55] is something we have to actively seek
[35:57] after
[35:59] praise God
[36:03] he that walketh in his uprightness
[36:05] feareth the Lord
[36:07] but he that is perverse
[36:09] in his ways despises them so here this
[36:12] verse is about walking
[36:14] see when we're walking and doing what's
[36:16] right the Bible says we're walking in
[36:18] the fear of the Lord
[36:20] okay
[36:21] so our whole our whole walk today your
[36:24] walk with God tomorrow your walk with
[36:26] God should be in the fear of the Lord
[36:28] you should be reverencing God you should
[36:30] be respecting God all day honoring God
[36:33] all day thinking about oh does this
[36:34] decision going to honor God if I say
[36:36] that if I do that is this going to honor
[36:38] God if I do this is this going to honor
[36:41] God if I say that
[36:43] and then even ask yourself did that
[36:45] honor God Lord let me pray about that
[36:47] did this honor God well did I Take God
[36:49] in consideration before I made this
[36:51] decision
[36:52] that's walking in the fear of the Lord
[36:55] that's staying at the spring and
[36:58] drinking from the spring
[36:59] Hallelujah
[37:01] here's a good one for us let not thine
[37:03] heart and be sinners
[37:06] do not envy a sinner
[37:08] I don't care how rich or handsome or
[37:10] pretty or whatever they are do not envy
[37:12] them at all
[37:13] because their end is eternal hell now
[37:16] Eternal Eternal separation from God
[37:18] there is no such thing as eternal hell
[37:20] it's Eternal separation from God do not
[37:22] don't let your heart wish you live like
[37:24] them
[37:26] you know the fact they put all that
[37:27] makeup shows how empty the more the more
[37:29] you got to put on the outside the more
[37:31] empty you are on the inside
[37:33] right
[37:34] that's so true the more you got to flash
[37:37] and look at how much money you got that
[37:38] shows how empty you are
[37:40] because you're trusting in things that
[37:42] will pass away but you and I are
[37:44] trusting in something that can never
[37:45] pass away praise God hallelujah
[37:48] eternity Hallelujah
[37:50] don't let your heart Envy these people
[37:52] be thou in the fear of the Lord
[37:54] all day long praise God
[37:58] I could maybe I could change the lyrics
[38:00] to this song I'm Gonna Stay in the fear
[38:03] of the Lord I'm gonna stay in the fear
[38:06] of the Lord gonna stay in the fear of
[38:10] the Lord and the devil can't do me no
[38:13] harm you like that maybe we'll sing that
[38:15] at the end
[38:16] all day
[38:18] I'm gonna walk in the fear of God all
[38:21] day I know he's watching me but the best
[38:22] part is I know he's with me amen I know
[38:25] he loves me because he's just me just
[38:26] saying that amen I know God loves me
[38:28] church if anything we know God loves us
[38:30] hallelujah
[38:31] we're just as children we're learning
[38:33] how to please him
[38:35] I deal with children all day they're not
[38:37] perfect all day
[38:38] even the ones that were really good
[38:40] during the first part of the year now
[38:41] they're getting lacks on me now they
[38:43] need a lot of Correction
[38:45] because I become common to them and
[38:46] church the same thing we let God become
[38:48] common to us
[38:49] we've got to get the anointing back we
[38:52] can by the grace of God
[38:53] we can get it back every day but the
[38:55] Bible said walk in that honor of God all
[38:58] day I'm going to fear God all day
[39:04] and no and notice if you want to be
[39:05] happy
[39:06] walk in the fear of God all day
[39:10] isn't a great feeling when you get to
[39:11] end the day and say thank you Lord you
[39:13] kept me from this you kept me from that
[39:14] you kept me from that you kept me from
[39:16] that is that a great feeling to have and
[39:18] yeah one time during the day or a couple
[39:20] times during the day you failed God but
[39:22] isn't it great to say Lord thank you for
[39:23] keeping me from that thank you that my
[39:25] life is spared from these things
[39:27] what a blessing and like we can go to we
[39:29] can go to bed happy at the end of the
[39:31] day
[39:32] praise God hallelujah
[39:34] but he that hardeneth his heart shall
[39:37] fall into Mischief see a lot of people
[39:40] go to bed with problems because their
[39:42] own mischief
[39:43] but church we can go to bed with peace
[39:45] in our hearts
[39:47] we can go to bed happy
[39:48] yeah I've got a few little things but
[39:50] it's not because of my Mischief right
[39:52] it's just that's how the that's how the
[39:54] world works I'm being tested or whatever
[39:57] right but we're happier if we walk in
[40:00] the fear of God lord protect me let me
[40:02] always stay in tune with your holy
[40:03] spirit amen let me go with all the while
[40:05] with a song and a smile fill my day
[40:08] every day with with love amen let me
[40:11] walk with the Heavenly Dove all day
[40:12] Hallelujah happy as that man that fears
[40:16] God always
[40:18] happy as that man or woman who's always
[40:20] wondering am I pleasing my Lord right
[40:22] now
[40:23] is this what the Lord wants me to do
[40:26] you know I thought about preaching a
[40:27] sermon on how to be happy there's
[40:29] so here's a couple of them fear God all
[40:31] day long and then Jesus said happy are
[40:33] you when you keep communion so we just
[40:36] had community on Sunday so everybody
[40:37] should be pretty happy by God's grace
[40:39] amen if you're keeping communion
[40:41] remembering the Lord and then walking
[40:43] the fear of God a merry heart maketh
[40:46] medicine so constant praise constant
[40:49] glory to God constantly worshiping God
[40:51] that's what I told my friend this
[40:52] morning Philippians 4 be anxious for
[40:55] nothing do not be careful for anything
[40:56] don't let anxiety or stress overtake you
[40:59] but with everything through prayer and
[41:01] Thanksgiving make your request known
[41:03] unto God and the peace of God which
[41:05] passes all understanding will keep your
[41:07] hearts and Minds through Christ Jesus
[41:10] we can't let we can't walk into Mischief
[41:12] we can't walk into stress we can't walk
[41:15] with anxieties we've got to cast those
[41:17] on the Lord and we've got to instead
[41:19] give thanks back to God we've got to
[41:21] walk in the fear of God hallelujah and
[41:23] the Bible said if we do that we're happy
[41:25] when we always fear God
[41:29] Hallelujah this life is too fast not to
[41:31] be happy
[41:33] right this this life goes way too fast
[41:36] not to be happy with what God's done for
[41:38] us
[41:39] Hallelujah
[41:43] like brothers said we don't want our
[41:44] lives crying with a crabbiness or a an
[41:47] anger or a bitterness at the end of our
[41:49] Lives you know we don't want that we
[41:50] want to be crowned with God's glory
[41:52] praise God we want to be Cloud a crown
[41:54] with God's fear with God's love with
[41:57] God's anointing praise God
[42:00] a happy heart maketh good medicine
[42:03] Hallelujah
[42:04] so the way to be happy is to honor the
[42:07] Lord
[42:07] fear the lord
[42:09] so the conclusion of the matter I love
[42:11] how Solomon tells us this the wisest man
[42:13] this was after he'd Fallen away from God
[42:15] and you know it seemed like he wrote the
[42:16] first book Song of Solomon first you
[42:18] know he had only had one wife instead of
[42:20] a thousand
[42:21] seemed like he wrote that book first and
[42:23] then he wrote Proverbs or maybe Proverbs
[42:24] was right before Song of Solomon either
[42:26] way those first two books were just so
[42:29] astounding but it seems like he writes
[42:31] Ecclesiastes after the end of all his
[42:33] failures His Thousand wives his building
[42:36] Idols he left the fear of the Lord
[42:40] and he says the the whole matter
[42:43] the conclusion of my life the conclusion
[42:45] of every life amen the secret to every
[42:49] life is to fear God and keep his
[42:51] commands
[42:54] boy I think how many uh I think how many
[42:56] people are getting to see by the
[42:57] millions of views and they're clicking
[42:58] on uh what's the secret to life what's
[43:00] the secret life we got it right here and
[43:01] it's free
[43:02] right and there's no ads in it praise
[43:04] God hallelujah there's no ads and you
[43:07] don't see uh Ecclesiastes 12 broken up
[43:09] and well here's the ad for you know
[43:11] Quaker Oats or something like that you
[43:12] know you don't you don't see that
[43:13] there's no ads in the Bible hallelujah
[43:15] thank God Amen
[43:18] and it's it's God here reminding us
[43:22] and it's just amazing with Solomon and
[43:24] you know the story but God said as
[43:26] anything and he asked for wisdom
[43:29] he asked for the Tree of Life
[43:32] right rather than a money tree
[43:35] he asked for a tree of a tree of life of
[43:38] wisdom he asked for the fear of the Lord
[43:40] and he got it but then he even fell away
[43:42] he even fell away from that the wisest
[43:45] man became a very foolish man
[43:48] right so see church again it doesn't it
[43:50] doesn't matter what gifts we have or
[43:52] what gifts we don't have the main thing
[43:54] is to fear God and keep his commands
[43:56] amen because that wisdom was just a gift
[44:00] just I'm just saying just in other words
[44:01] you got it you gotta you gotta operate
[44:04] that gift
[44:05] you have to be faithful with that gift
[44:07] so he had the greatest gift and then God
[44:09] because he was so faithful with it God
[44:11] gave him money and riches and all these
[44:12] things and wealth and fame but then he
[44:15] let that turn him away he started
[44:18] trusting in that rather than in the
[44:20] original thing the fear of God the
[44:22] wisdom of the Lord
[44:24] I said he comes down to the end of his
[44:26] life he said I've tried laughter you've
[44:27] ever read Ecclesiastes lately he tried
[44:30] laughter to fulfill him he tried
[44:31] building to fulfill women to fulfill him
[44:34] he money he tried all these things and
[44:36] he said it's all vanity
[44:38] but there's one conclusion there's one
[44:40] secret to life it's that Fountain of
[44:42] fear of God and the Tree of Life the
[44:44] wisdom of God hallelujah
[44:46] Hallelujah there's one secret to life
[44:50] he said let us hear the conclusion of
[44:52] the whole matter
[44:53] and church May Our Lives be summed up in
[44:56] this what is the conclusion of our whole
[44:58] life what's the whole point of our life
[44:59] fear God
[45:02] honor God in every single area that we
[45:04] can
[45:05] fear God give him reverence moral
[45:09] reverence
[45:10] and keep his commands for this is the
[45:12] whole duty of man for God shall bring
[45:15] every work into judgment
[45:18] with every secret thing whether it be
[45:21] good or whether it be evil praise God
[45:24] now church I'll say just very plainly
[45:26] tonight I'm very thankful God has a sea
[45:28] of forgetfulness
[45:30] because I can still remember my failures
[45:32] from today or yesterday whatever day
[45:35] but I'm so thankful the Lord has to see
[45:37] it forgetfulness praise God hallelujah
[45:39] the devil can remind me of it but God
[45:42] God throws it in to see a forgetfulness
[45:46] and so any secret thing we do or any
[45:48] public mistake we make or any any
[45:50] mistake we make
[45:52] with our family our friends our worker
[45:54] co-workers whatever
[45:56] they might remember the devil might
[45:57] bring it up but God won't bring it up
[46:02] and church we can repent of that and we
[46:04] can feel forgiven and we can be happy
[46:06] again because we know by God's grace we
[46:08] won't do it again amen
[46:10] and if we do it again there's grace and
[46:11] mercy for that as well
[46:13] praise God like I showed you brother
[46:14] Brown he constantly battled the critical
[46:16] spirit
[46:17] constantly
[46:18] from the beginning to his ministry all
[46:21] the way to the end he battled criticism
[46:22] thinking you know criticizing people
[46:26] can't say something good about people
[46:28] constantly now see church we may
[46:31] constantly battle something
[46:33] we may constantly battle it but God's
[46:36] grace is sufficient
[46:37] praise God
[46:39] there's going to be times Hallelujah
[46:41] there's going to be a lot of times when
[46:42] you're drinking from the fountain
[46:44] Hallelujah and you're walking in the
[46:47] fear of the Lord
[46:48] there's going to be times you might step
[46:49] away from that fountain
[46:52] but there's Grace to bring us right back
[46:54] Hallelujah there's Grace for that
[46:58] you know have you ever thought about it
[46:59] how many ever I think we can all relate
[47:01] to being like Jonah right we know what
[47:03] to do but then we purposely go against
[47:05] it and the church said
[47:07] that's why Jonah is such a powerful
[47:08] story that's why God put it in there
[47:10] right because we can all whether we hear
[47:12] the voice of God or whether we just read
[47:14] the voice of God in the Bible
[47:16] we all know we should do something and
[47:18] then we turn from that path
[47:21] and we disobey
[47:22] and we lose the anointing of the fear of
[47:25] the Lord it dries up
[47:28] you're physically speaking but it's a
[47:30] symbolism and we forget
[47:33] or we purposely go against it but did
[47:35] God ever give up on Jonah
[47:38] did God help Jonah accomplish his
[47:40] purpose that's the best part amen amen
[47:43] even though I were disobedient even
[47:45] though I'm disobedient we're all
[47:46] disobedient God is going to help us in
[47:49] his love how even if we got bad
[47:51] attitudes praise God he's going to help
[47:53] us in his love and bring us back to the
[47:54] truth amen
[47:56] well the Ram's attitude was if they
[47:58] don't they don't want to hear about
[47:58] preaching they don't have to
[48:00] then God brought him back he said well
[48:02] Lord now if you give me a new heart and
[48:04] I can go out to the people again and I
[48:06] can have a heart for the people again
[48:10] that's what that's what God does for us
[48:12] friends that's what God does for us
[48:14] Hallelujah
[48:15] so the conclusion the whole point of
[48:18] this life is to fear God and keep his
[48:20] commands
[48:23] now there's a bunch of examples it's
[48:25] still the same thing in the New
[48:27] Testament
[48:29] um we see a save thief on the cross
[48:31] Ephesians 5.
[48:33] second Corinthians 7 first Peter 2.
[48:37] I wrote down a couple more
[48:44] uh let's if you got your Bible let's go
[48:46] to Hebrews chapter 12 here I want to
[48:47] read this one I heard this A good sermon
[48:49] preached today
[48:52] Hebrews chapter 12.
[49:04] all right now verse 28 Hebrews 12 28
[49:07] wherefore we receive a kingdom which
[49:09] cannot be moved let us have Grace
[49:11] whereby we may serve God acceptably with
[49:14] what reverence and godly fear for our
[49:18] God is a consuming fire
[49:21] let me read that again because that's a
[49:23] powerful verse did you catch it Church
[49:25] Grace and fear are in both or both both
[49:29] both attributes are in the same
[49:31] scripture
[49:32] let us have Grace which is God's
[49:34] unmerited favor
[49:36] so we may serve God reverently with fear
[49:40] the fear of the Lord the honor of the
[49:43] Lord
[49:44] so Grace of the Grace Grace had taught
[49:46] My Heart To Fear amen thank God Amen
[49:48] Amazing Grace that's beautiful I never
[49:50] knew where they got that scripture from
[49:51] until right now praise God where'd he
[49:53] get that verse from Amazing Grace Grace
[49:55] has taught My Heart To Fear
[49:57] see fearing God respecting God knowing
[49:59] God is watching that comes from a life
[50:03] that's lived by Grace praise God
[50:06] let us have Grace
[50:08] whereby we may serve God acceptably with
[50:10] reverence and fear that's what Paul said
[50:13] if anybody knew Grace it was Paul
[50:15] because Paul was he was consenting for
[50:17] Christians to be killed he was trying to
[50:19] get them to blaspheme
[50:21] and then he said
[50:22] at the end of his life he said I'll
[50:25] bring my body into subjection I'll do
[50:27] anything I'll do I'll go to any means so
[50:30] that I am not a Castaway Hallelujah
[50:33] Grace was teaching him to fear God
[50:36] Grace was teaching him not to trust his
[50:39] flesh Grace was teaching him not to give
[50:41] in to the lust of the flesh Grace was
[50:43] teaching his heart to fear and the
[50:45] church said amen
[50:47] Hallelujah Grace will do that today amen
[50:49] Grace does that for you and I Hallelujah
[50:51] Grace teaches our hearts to fear God
[50:57] Hallelujah
[50:59] you know we see it every you know every
[51:00] couple months there's somebody else that
[51:01] leaves a message or some other preacher
[51:03] that falls whether in the message or on
[51:05] the message see they didn't let Grace
[51:07] teach their hearts to fear they thought
[51:10] they could get away with this
[51:11] relationship or this money scheme or
[51:14] whatever it is
[51:15] they thought they could get away with it
[51:17] like Grace would cover it no Grace
[51:19] teaches you to run from it amen
[51:21] hallelujah
[51:23] Grace teaches you to hate evil praise
[51:25] God
[51:26] and you know what some of the things
[51:28] they say I've heard one a while ago it's
[51:30] been a while now
[51:31] but the preacher said well God forgave
[51:34] David of his adultery so God would
[51:36] forgive me of it
[51:38] and he was having an affair with like a
[51:39] teenage girl in his office or something
[51:40] like that that's why it's a good thing
[51:42] pastors well it's a good thing not to
[51:44] have offices like that you know where
[51:45] you have a woman out there as a
[51:47] secretary and all these things like that
[51:48] just not a good thing
[51:51] you see but that's the Old Testament
[51:53] mindset that's under the blood of bulls
[51:56] and goats that's not under the blood of
[51:58] Jesus Christ Hallelujah
[52:00] because the blood of Jesus Christ speaks
[52:02] better things amen hallelujah it's a
[52:04] higher calling Hallelujah
[52:08] so see they don't understand what real
[52:11] Grace is Grace teaches reverence and
[52:15] godly fear
[52:17] for our God is a consuming fire a couple
[52:20] weeks ago and I'm going to just share a
[52:21] simple thought
[52:22] a couple weeks ago we cut down that
[52:24] lilac bush Austin started it and I I got
[52:27] to finish it you did a good job buddy I
[52:30] bought one bought a
[52:31] I went bought a Ryobi chainsaw you know
[52:34] so I got up my chainsaw and we had all
[52:37] these all these branches and I thought
[52:39] oh we're gonna do a fire today it's
[52:41] going to be finally we got it going but
[52:43] this fire took off like I wasn't even
[52:45] ready for and pretty soon it's almost
[52:47] spreading you know in the grass and so
[52:49] my wife's like okay Jesse you got to
[52:51] stop that it's gonna it's gonna spread
[52:52] I'm like yeah it's probably going to
[52:53] spread here I wasn't watching the fire
[52:55] very good so I had to run next to the
[52:57] fire with the rake and try to push these
[52:59] these on fire logs and church I've you
[53:02] know I thought I was tough and I could
[53:04] handle it you know I'm like oh come on
[53:05] this is just fire
[53:08] I was pushing and I I was I was running
[53:11] by and pushing I thought you know it
[53:12] wasn't moving too fast but once I got in
[53:14] the presence of that fire it felt like I
[53:16] got like a total I felt like I wanted to
[53:18] ask Malachi is my face red or something
[53:20] like that here it hurts so bad
[53:23] I got so close to the fire
[53:25] and I just had to run away and just kind
[53:27] of make sure I was okay and you know
[53:28] other times you know those those little
[53:30] licks of fire will burn through my pants
[53:32] and burn through my shirts and
[53:33] everything like that but I just couldn't
[53:34] believe how hot this fire was
[53:38] and then I thought about this the Bible
[53:40] says our God is a consuming fire
[53:43] if the if the power that fire would make
[53:46] me turn my face away and and scream and
[53:49] run right and I didn't scream but I felt
[53:51] like screaming I felt like a little
[53:52] child running away from that fire
[53:55] if if the natural fire would do that
[53:57] what about the Holy Fire of Jesus
[54:01] right and this is what this is what Paul
[54:03] tells us you know I was blown away by
[54:05] the the power of that fire
[54:08] but the Bible says our God is a
[54:11] consuming fire we need to receive the
[54:13] kingdom of God
[54:15] and serve god with Grace
[54:18] and the Bible says with reverence and
[54:21] godly fear
[54:23] Hallelujah
[54:26] I think it's a great scripture Church to
[54:28] keep that one in Mind by the grace of
[54:30] the Lord
[54:30] beautiful scripture I want to make sure
[54:33] I get uh
[54:34] let me I just want to share this example
[54:36] there's a certain uh
[54:37] YouTuber group that we like most the
[54:40] time
[54:41] but a couple months ago I come home and
[54:43] uh
[54:44] you know the kids get their hour of
[54:45] screen time
[54:48] and uh
[54:50] you know most of the most of the
[54:51] YouTubes are funny or you know something
[54:53] like that you know trick shots and stuff
[54:54] like that you probably know what I'm
[54:56] talking about but I'm not going to say
[54:57] it that naturally but they had a certain
[54:59] show and afterwards the one of the guys
[55:01] was dressed up like a game show host and
[55:04] he was doing this lewd sexual thing
[55:07] there's a lewd sexual Movement Like a
[55:09] sexual dance and as soon as I saw that I
[55:11] said that's the last time we're watching
[55:13] this
[55:14] and it was the last time we haven't
[55:16] watched that one since and if they have
[55:18] it we've got to have a talk when we get
[55:19] home
[55:21] and I that was a moment where I felt
[55:23] like the fear of God struck my heart
[55:25] like that cannot be in my house
[55:28] and the church said
[55:31] amen it's like the fear of God like
[55:33] and everything else might have been
[55:35] funny and wholesome you know just clean
[55:36] fun on there but when I saw that man do
[55:39] that sexual move like that I said that
[55:41] is not going to happen in my house again
[55:46] because I have to have the fear of the
[55:48] Lord
[55:51] and that was a lesson I had to learn
[55:56] you know that's how we have to do it
[55:57] with with everything in our life you
[55:59] know we have to when we see something
[56:00] like evil like that we've got to make a
[56:02] stand right against it
[56:05] because if not what the Bible says we
[56:07] it's like Samson we start flirting you
[56:10] know with the things of the world
[56:12] right we start flirting and how much
[56:14] evil can I allow into my life but the
[56:16] Bible says walk in the fear of the Lord
[56:17] all day long
[56:21] and maybe that's why you know sometimes
[56:22] in our homes be included maybe we're not
[56:24] happy because we made compromises and we
[56:27] haven't feared God like we ought to
[56:30] because if there ever be ought to be a
[56:31] place where we're happy and I'll be the
[56:33] house of God in our house
[56:35] and I'm guarantee you're gonna be happy
[56:36] at work all the time I know sometimes I
[56:38] don't like going to work either
[56:39] I do it I thank God for it I said I'm
[56:42] not always happy as there but we ought
[56:43] to be happy at home praise God because
[56:45] we can we can create the atmosphere in
[56:47] our house praise God
[56:49] but that was one moment I just want to
[56:51] share with you I wrote down there as I
[56:52] was praying I thought yeah I want to
[56:53] share that
[56:54] one lewd movement like that I said I'm
[56:57] not there's a spirit behind that
[57:00] and think about that church this man did
[57:01] a sexual movement and my little children
[57:04] are sitting right there
[57:05] but before before that I never would
[57:07] everything was good before that
[57:08] everything was fine but see how the
[57:10] enemy tried to get in there and he tries
[57:12] to take he tries to take the boundary a
[57:14] little bit further
[57:17] I remember brother random watched Ten
[57:19] Commandments and River of No Return I
[57:22] don't know what he watched in there
[57:24] so we can't say we you can't watch
[57:26] anything unless it's the Bible we can't
[57:28] say that but we sure do need a lot of
[57:30] wisdom in this hour
[57:32] we sure need the fear of the Lord in
[57:34] this hour
[57:36] I told this story a while ago but one
[57:39] time my brother met with me he was
[57:40] trying to rebuke me for my YouTube
[57:41] Ministry and the fact we had church
[57:43] services on YouTube we were in a Subway
[57:45] and I'll never forget this this guy was
[57:47] he was very zealous for the Lord and I
[57:49] appreciated Zeal the Lord I differ with
[57:51] him on his Doctrine he basically
[57:52] worshiped his brother Branham but we sat
[57:54] there we were sitting in a Subway a
[57:56] small Subway I'm across from him there's
[57:58] probably a line of like three or four
[58:00] people in line it's a small Subway
[58:02] and I said okay brother what you want to
[58:04] meet with me about something and he just
[58:06] he started talking the more he talked he
[58:08] got redder and redder
[58:11] but
[58:12] and then he said that YouTube and when I
[58:15] scroll on YouTube and your videos are on
[58:16] YouTube when I scroll then there's a
[58:18] porn video on there and there's all
[58:19] kinds of things and he raised his voice
[58:21] and he said you shouldn't allow this and
[58:24] I was just sitting there like well I
[58:25] wasn't he he's almost yelling in this
[58:27] Subway
[58:30] and I'm like I'm like embarrassed like
[58:34] but I just let him go he kept talking
[58:35] pretty soon he calmed down he was crying
[58:38] and by the end I of course the whole
[58:40] time I respected it because I knew it
[58:41] was right
[58:44] um YouTube or any video surfing platform
[58:47] can be a real awful thing
[58:49] if you don't use it now what he didn't
[58:51] know is that the reason those videos are
[58:53] on there is because maybe somebody in
[58:55] his family was clicking on that because
[58:56] I don't have any of those bad videos on
[58:58] my feed
[59:01] and I didn't tell them that because I
[59:02] didn't think about it at the time
[59:03] or maybe he was cooking the wrong thing
[59:06] maybe that's maybe he was freshly
[59:07] repented from that
[59:09] but I just want to share that that was
[59:10] another moment where I saw the fear of
[59:12] the Lord I thought that was really good
[59:14] now I let him get it all out and he was
[59:16] he balled me out in front of everybody I
[59:18] mean
[59:19] I'm just taking it like I can't wait for
[59:20] my turn
[59:22] I said dear brother
[59:24] I said you know the reason I did the
[59:25] YouTube Ministry I shared them you know
[59:26] all the four reasons you know I can't
[59:27] travel overseas anymore I got a big
[59:29] family maybe my family will watch it one
[59:31] of my family members did who just died a
[59:32] couple weeks ago
[59:34] you know thank God she got to hear she
[59:36] got to hear it helps me be a better
[59:38] teacher I mean of the word of God it
[59:40] keeps me in the word of God I mean all
[59:41] these reasons
[59:43] and I said we've got testimonies from
[59:44] around the world of people not wearing
[59:46] makeup anymore people being baptized
[59:48] people saying they got the Holy Ghost I
[59:50] said we have testimonies around the
[59:52] world
[59:53] and by the end he's like okay well maybe
[59:54] it's not too bad you know
[59:57] he said maybe that maybe that's okay
[1:00:01] but I just want to share that that was a
[1:00:02] real moment of zeal for the Lord and I
[1:00:05] could tell he really feared God like he
[1:00:07] didn't really want to see those evil
[1:00:09] videos pop up
[1:00:11] on his feet
[1:00:12] but I told him I said brother that don't
[1:00:14] pop up on my feet
[1:00:16] no I'm not justifying YouTube like I've
[1:00:18] told you before if it's a if you're
[1:00:19] having a struggle you need to get rid of
[1:00:21] it I had to pray just a couple weeks ago
[1:00:22] God help me not to scroll it I wasn't
[1:00:23] even watching it I was just wasting time
[1:00:25] scrolling on it
[1:00:27] and I said God forgive me and by God's
[1:00:29] grace I still got the victory by God's
[1:00:30] grace
[1:00:31] just not wasting time
[1:00:34] but those were two moments you know I
[1:00:36] seen that at my house and I said that
[1:00:37] will not we do not watch that again
[1:00:40] that man was shaking himself like that
[1:00:41] no
[1:00:42] will not do that again
[1:00:44] that show was out
[1:00:46] and then this guy just with the Zeal of
[1:00:48] the Lord with the fervency of the Lord
[1:00:49] and I thought man I respect that guy
[1:00:51] right now he's got some false Doctrine
[1:00:53] but he almost worships brother Brandon
[1:00:55] but I respect the fact that he has the
[1:00:56] fear of the Lord when it comes to visual
[1:00:58] sins
[1:00:59] and The Temptations
[1:01:03] now Church what I found is that
[1:01:05] the goodness of God leads us to
[1:01:08] repentance and what is repentance
[1:01:10] repentance is turning from Evil and what
[1:01:11] is the fear of the Lord to hate evil
[1:01:14] so the fear of the Lord is absolute
[1:01:17] major that we need to master by God's
[1:01:20] grace because it leads us to Salvation
[1:01:23] the first salvation glory and it leads
[1:01:25] us through sanctification it even leads
[1:01:27] us after we get the Holy Ghost praise
[1:01:28] God
[1:01:29] because like brother Ram's example like
[1:01:31] Peter's example won't even eat with
[1:01:32] different cultures just like these
[1:01:34] examples we constantly need to live in
[1:01:37] the fear of the Lord
[1:01:40] praise God
[1:01:44] and I'm going to close with this I'm
[1:01:45] right at one hour yes I'm right at one
[1:01:47] hour and I told my wife I mentioned I'd
[1:01:48] just do one hour today I'm really gonna
[1:01:50] try it so we get up at 4 30. I really
[1:01:52] need to get home earlier now
[1:01:55] the most beautiful part of this whole
[1:01:57] thing
[1:01:58] to me
[1:02:00] is that Jesus Christ was anointed with
[1:02:03] the fear of the Lord
[1:02:07] and so we just have to look at the Life
[1:02:08] of Christ and then we will see
[1:02:12] how uh someone with the anointing of God
[1:02:14] can walk in the fear of God all day long
[1:02:18] I was thinking about that yesterday I'm
[1:02:19] like how in the world could you the
[1:02:21] Bible says you we would not have enough
[1:02:23] books to write all that Jesus did
[1:02:25] and that was just in three and a half
[1:02:27] years of ministry
[1:02:28] three and a half years of ministry
[1:02:31] may God hope that there's just a few
[1:02:33] pages about my life right and your life
[1:02:37] I mean you can't even
[1:02:39] think of all the books we could fit in
[1:02:40] here the next room the Next Room John
[1:02:43] says I suppose you couldn't even have
[1:02:45] enough books that could write all that
[1:02:46] the Lord Jesus did
[1:02:48] all the testimonies all the people that
[1:02:49] he helped that means all throughout the
[1:02:51] day he was walking the fear of the Lord
[1:02:53] helping people encouraging people
[1:02:55] delivering people healing people
[1:02:57] teaching people right in the temple
[1:03:01] all the day long
[1:03:03] but the Bible said he was anointed with
[1:03:06] the fear of the Lord
[1:03:08] I'm gonna make sure
[1:03:10] so here's the verse we started with
[1:03:11] there shall rise a root a rod out of the
[1:03:14] stem of Jesse branch
[1:03:17] the church who's this talking about who
[1:03:18] is the branch out of Jesse and out of
[1:03:20] David the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:23] and the spirit of the Lord should rest
[1:03:25] on him now count this I might preach
[1:03:26] this on Sunday
[1:03:27] the spirit Lord shall rest upon him the
[1:03:29] spirit of wisdom
[1:03:31] the spirit of understanding
[1:03:34] the spirit of counsel
[1:03:36] the spirit of Might
[1:03:37] the spirit of knowledge
[1:03:40] and of the fear of the Lord
[1:03:42] six
[1:03:44] remember way back in 2018 when I
[1:03:46] preached the numerology series
[1:03:49] 6 is the number yes it's the number of
[1:03:51] Fallen man and beasts but it's also the
[1:03:53] number of the anointed man
[1:03:55] Adam was created on the sixth day
[1:03:58] with full anointing there's not seven or
[1:04:01] eight pieces of armor with the full
[1:04:02] armor of God there's six pieces
[1:04:05] hallelujah
[1:04:06] hallelujah thank God Amen
[1:04:09] I want to look at each one of these Lord
[1:04:10] willing
[1:04:12] but and shall make him so God shall make
[1:04:15] him of quick understanding in the fear
[1:04:18] of the Lord in other words he'll quickly
[1:04:19] recognize evil Hallelujah and he shall
[1:04:22] not judge look at this he shall not
[1:04:24] judge after the sight of his eyes that
[1:04:25] reminds me of Joshua that one time
[1:04:27] Joshua failed he judged the givenites
[1:04:30] off of his eyes what he saw instead of
[1:04:32] seeking God for the Revelation not in
[1:04:34] his heart
[1:04:35] and church how many times do we judge
[1:04:37] things by what we see
[1:04:38] rather than if you know was that exactly
[1:04:40] the right thing or was it not
[1:04:45] neither reprove after the hearing of his
[1:04:48] ears so he was able to have discernment
[1:04:50] based upon what he heard and what he saw
[1:04:52] he could we know the Bible said he could
[1:04:54] discern thoughts and hearts
[1:04:56] he knew the very thoughts and intents of
[1:04:59] our hearts
[1:05:02] and so with these six anointings on him
[1:05:04] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:05:06] impacted the world and now for the for
[1:05:09] all of human history but also for all
[1:05:11] eternity praise God
[1:05:12] these six anointings
[1:05:15] oh it's a beautiful picture
[1:05:16] and so what does Paul tell us walking
[1:05:18] all honest and all honestly I'm sorry
[1:05:21] let us walk honestly rather
[1:05:23] remember honesty is part of
[1:05:25] uh reverence
[1:05:27] as in the day not in rioting and
[1:05:29] drunkenness now we're not doing that
[1:05:30] we're not riding in the streets we're
[1:05:32] not getting drunk not in the chambering
[1:05:34] of lanternness not in the strife and
[1:05:37] Emmy not here where we might get tripped
[1:05:38] a little bit strife and being other
[1:05:40] people
[1:05:42] but he says put you on in other words
[1:05:43] get out that get out that anointing oil
[1:05:45] praise God get out that lotion
[1:05:47] Hallelujah get off that coconut oil for
[1:05:49] me
[1:05:51] got dry skin you got dry scalp he said
[1:05:54] but put you on the Lord Jesus Christ get
[1:05:56] anointed
[1:05:57] and do not make provision for the flesh
[1:06:00] because the fear of God will make you
[1:06:03] turn and run away from evil
[1:06:05] right
[1:06:06] to fear the lord is to depart evil and
[1:06:08] not only depart the fear of the Lord is
[1:06:10] to hate when you sin
[1:06:13] and do not make an opportunity for the
[1:06:16] flesh to fulfill the lust thereof let's
[1:06:19] stand to our feet musicians you can come
[1:06:25] Anointed with the spirit
[1:06:29] of the fear of the Lord
[1:06:34] Hallelujah
[1:06:39] we're so thankful church we have
[1:06:40] confidence today
[1:06:42] we're so thankful we have a refuge
[1:06:45] we saw we're so thankful we have a
[1:06:47] starting place to get to that tree of
[1:06:48] life wisdom and we're so grateful we
[1:06:50] have a fountain praise God today
[1:06:53] how many appreciate the fear of the Lord
[1:06:55] let's bow our heads here
[1:06:57] you know just telling these stories
[1:06:58] about my life I want to be
[1:07:01] I want to be more Anointed with the
[1:07:04] spirit of fear
[1:07:04] [Music]
[1:07:06] the spirit of moral reverence
[1:07:11] especially in the church especially my
[1:07:13] home my daily life
[1:07:15] foreign
[1:07:18] [Music]
[1:07:23] it's a choice heading into that
[1:07:25] scripture but the Bible says You must
[1:07:28] choose to put on the fear of the Lord
[1:07:35] with our heads about church let's think
[1:07:37] about our lives here
[1:07:39] such a blessing we get to do this at
[1:07:42] least three times a week usually
[1:07:44] thank you
[1:07:46] foreign
[1:07:50] [Music]
[1:08:00] that spring of fear of the Lord the
[1:08:03] Fountain of the fear of the Lord
[1:08:06] that moral reverence profound honor for
[1:08:09] the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:08:12] may we say Lord I I honor you so much
[1:08:15] I'm not going to do this
[1:08:19] Lord I honor you so much I'm going to
[1:08:20] depart from this
[1:08:22] Hallelujah I honor you so much
[1:08:25] I'm not going to do this again
[1:08:33] I'm sure like me if you're like me
[1:08:35] Church you understand that we need
[1:08:37] reminders about the fear of the Lord
[1:08:42] the conclusion of the whole matter this
[1:08:44] is the whole secret to Christianity
[1:08:47] let's pray together
[1:08:48] father God I thank you for tonight Lord
