[Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] did a prayer request [Music] I stand here for a few prayer requests by God's grace - pretty serious requests here one of our friends has a daughter named named named Macy rather and she's battling leukemia so let's pray for that how it is may see two or three so that's let's pray for Macy this evening by God's grace also there's a student I taught at Copley and her great aunt Melinda's dying of cancer she's older so I told her we'd pray for her Belinda I don't know if it's the Lord's will to take her at this time or not but we know God can do all things and our trust is in the Lord Jesus so those two requests are they on the request tonight by the grace of the Lord for that unspoken yes sir Haman amen thank you very for our friends okay Karis friends amen praise the love our Victoria's guy there's a need on that little heart no doubt about that so we'll take those requests before the Lord also to announcements as well for those live-streaming

sit up listening this last song before it comes up [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] let's take our Bibles tonight by the grace of the Lord let's go to proverbs chapter 31 we like to finish on this thought of the proverbs 31 woman tonight by God's grace sorry I don't have my mic on robbers chapter 31 and Lord willing if we have time I still want to finish the thought about my son here the instruction so I kind of got five time I'll combine both messages into one tonight by God's grace that's the beauty a pastor and praise the Lord I just love it I can always pick up and finish wherever the Lord leads me and I've been studying uh brother branham's sermons called revelation chapter four parts one two and three I've been studying those so I want to continue on the book of Revelation soon by the grace of God and we'll pick up on that as well by the grace of the Lord so let's just go to verse 30 proverbs chapter 31 verse 30 we'll just read that one verse there just a moment as I get there verse 31 30 let's read that verse together one two three favor is deceitful and beauty is vain but a woman that feareth the Lord she shall be praised that's power heads a word of Prayer if you need on your heart just make it known unto God here Heavenly Father Lord we again come into your house Lord here worshiping you coming into your presence with praise and adoration we worship you Almighty God there's none like you father God we just give you glory tonight we ask Oh God you ministered all those hands that were raised all the hearts Lord that were raised to heaven Lord God we're looking forward Lord you speak into a strengthening us Lord encouraging us Lord by the grace of God and we trust you'll do it Lord we know you promised to meet wherever two or three are gathered Lord God you said everything revealed when we sit at your feet would never be taken from us Lord because that's a revelation which the gates of Hell cannot prevail against Lord so we ask Lord that you do that again tonight in your faithful mercy Lord and your faithful character feed your sheep again tonight and we'll give you all the praise and glory in Jesus Christ's name and the Saint said Amen god bless yous beaten seated praise the Lord well I have some video air quotes Mac I'll put if you could put those up there we'd appreciate that well just want to greet everybody in Jesus name we missed you last weekend both Simon had good reports he said he got a lot of good feedback so very happy about that by the grace of Lord I haven't had time to watch it I'm sorry watch it or listen to it I've been quite busy traveling and then getting back into school and everything like that but I told him I'll try to watch it as soon as I can perhaps this weekend by the grace of the Lord so we appreciate all the efforts that were put into that I know Malachi was helping out with Simon so I appreciate Malachi by God's grace and thank you sir for all your help Lydia thank you for your help while we were out by the grace of the Lord let's look at this thought here tonight let's finish the proverbs 31 woman and my son here are the instructions so let's look at these thoughts and I know you'll be blessed tonight by the grace of God the Prophet said I've never gone in the house of God and left disappointed I could say the same for that I've never left disappointed even when I've gone to different churches you know what maybe our denominational and visited you know a couple years ago we were on vacation now in Virginia we went to a Pentecostal church and I still enjoyed that service if I couldn't get a whole loaf I got a few slices and I I really enjoyed that by the grace of the Lord anytime we're in the presence and people are worshiping the name of Jesus Christ we're grateful for that I don't know the I don't know everyone's seed whether they're serpent seed or not or what other whatever they are one thing I know in the presence of Christ is fullness of joy he meant and so we're grateful for that by the grace of the Lord so I didn't read that text I actually forgot to change that slide I didn't do that text many ways I want to jump right into this thought here like I said we'll try to finish these two thoughts tonight by God's grace let me set a timer so I don't wear myself out wear you out how do we know the proverbs 31 woman feared the Lord here's how we know we we come to the end of this chapter and we looked at a little bit last week but the Bible said she excelled all of them in virtue this proverbs 31 woman and we write we finished with it a couple Sunday nights ago where the Bible said give her the fruit of her hands let her works praise her and the gates so the character of this woman would be known in the entire community that's how we know she feared the Lord she lives such a godly life that everyone around her we say in her church everyone in her family everyone in her community knew that she was a godly woman I hope that's how your neighbors know you Oh sister this sister this neighbor godly woman or he could trust her anything she tells you she's gonna do it cuz she's a godly woman she keeps her word this brother oh he's so godly he's such a faith he helped me out when I needed some money or he helped me do this when I was out of town and you help me out the house may be mowed the yard for me when I couldn't mow the yard or you know he we should have such a godly testimony everywhere we go cuz look at this if you look at this thought here her life blessed everyone her life and work blessed everyone around her including her home her community and her church this woman was filled with such strength such honor such an anointing of the Holy Spirit as much as you could get in the Old Testament which you could get a lot you couldn't get the seal but you could get a lot you get enough to slay a giant amen you could get enough to have Christ in your midst in the midst of a fiery furnace you have enough anointing to close the mouth of hungry lions amen and that's what she has she had this powerful anointing maybe we'd say just manifested it in a different way than what we would expect maybe we'll look at that eventually with you know the Hall of Fame of faith with the sisters in the Hall of Fame of faith but look what Adam Clarke said about her the result of her labor is her best eulogy so you look at what did her labors produce that's the best way we could describe her life nothing can add to the simple beauty of this admirable portrait on the measure of its realization in the daughters of our own day rests untold results in the domestic that's the home life and therefore the civil and religious welfare of the people this woman her life touched every aspect of her community her home her church and it impacted the government as well how do you say government cuz member her husband was sitting amongst the elders and the gates her husband had a place of prominence in the community and it was because partly because of her godly reputation that helped her husband have respect and honor in a public setting that's right now this reminded me I just couldn't get away from the scripture where God tells Abraham he says separate yourself from your family get away from Shinar he said then go to land of Canaan and I'll make via great and I'll bless you and make your name great and thou shalt be a blessing to others amen so everywhere Abraham went as long as he stayed in the will of God he was blessed and He blessed other people that's why I hope people around you can say my this brother such a blessing this sister is such a blessing to me if we're not being a blessing to someone that we need to get our eyes off of whatever thing is distracting us from those Holy Spirit and be a blessing to somebody and just be a help to them you see they have any where you can help them out try to be a blessing to him because Abraham was a blessing everywhere he went and he was blessed of God as well so that's the way the same woman is this proverbs 31 woman the same thing is is characterizing her life she's blessed by God and she's blessing other people hallelujah and that's how I think that's how we all feel how many enjoy the blessings of the Holy Spirit you walk out of here on a Sunday or Wednesday night you felt the present Lord well if you really felt the presence of Lord you'll go out and bless somebody else you won't keep that anointing just for yourself you'll want to go bless somebody else by the grace of God huh that's so true now remember church remembrance is quite a statement the Bible said she excelled all the daughters in this day all of them this this this resume that she had excelled every woman of that day this proverbs 31 woman we'd say and so then these attributes are very important of a proper 31 woman we're gonna review them here briefly by God's grace we're gonna kind of organize them based upon the location so here let's review the attributes of this property one woman in those three locations we talked about home community and church let's look at how they fit into her home community in church and I try to add these little abbreviations I'm adding these seasons of life I've witnessed these attributes by observing my wife mother and other sisters so some of these attributes you'll see in a single from a single woman a newlywed married with young children married with older children and then of course empty nest so some of these attributes you would expect in different phases of life like I told you you're not gonna see a woman with a bunch of young children out there you know pulling rocks out of the field you know and working all day out in the field she can't she's got to feed these babies these babies get hungry every two hours don't they some of them you're hungry every hour like some of mine I'm just joking but they do ask for food all the time and if they kept asking if they if we kept giving to them they'd keep eating too but see you can't you can't you don't see that you don't see that in communities you see a young mother with young children you see her at the home you see her in the home she don't have time for other things because this is a very important stage of life taking care of the young children NASA I get older she's got a lot more freedom like I saw with my mother once once all of us grew up I saw my mother her ministry just expanded in other words instead of just going to church you know taking us a church she would actually clean the church and then she got a little a business she would do a little consignment business and then my mom started doing Meals on Wheels and helping people as we got older her business or her gifts expanded and now I think I was gonna give this later but I don't know some of you know but my mother every Thanksgiving Easter and Christmas feeds over 200 people every time and does it all by donations people just see her wanting to help people and they just flock to the church and I know she's got cut hair on and makeup on but behind that there's a heart that loves God and I believe God I just trust God is going to break through that heart one of these days there's a real sincere heart but as I say like I'm giving you these thoughts based upon when I see my wife mother and then other sisters I've seen as they get older that their their influence expands their ministry expands as they get older okay so sisters here these are all things the Bible said in Proverbs 31 you can do at home and I just put the abbreviations because the other ones I think can fit at all the times and I think you know what I'm talking about like for example the first one faithful with resources sisters at every age are probably faithful with resources you're not out blowing y'all your money on what's a woman's website Amazon okay I was thinking of like a women's clothing like Lane and Bryant is that one that's one okay you know what I'm talking about so she's gonna be no matter what age she is she's gonna be faithful she's gonna be fruit more frugal right if not they're gonna be in bankruptcy pretty soon because remember that's not just the husband's money that's the husband and wife's money right cuz if the wife said well I'll take a day off and hubby you'd take care of the children well then he can't make money at work that's their money together right and so see she's trustworthy to her husband at all time every season she should be trust worth now of course yeah you want to grow in faithfulness and Trust with us but if she's a believer she should be trustworthy right away and she should be good to her husband every day he at all times of her life now she should take initiative to work with her hands for example that's what I mean by cooking in the kitchen or or you know fixing the clothes or folding the clothes or all those things a woman does Mother's think about how many things your hands touch every day to help run your home and your family you're working with your hands at all stages of life if that brother even picks up a dish rag or a sweeper you're blessed because I know a lot of brothers a dope or to even take time to feed the babies or something like that you understand so what I really mean is that women often use their hands that's a godly characteristics they use it all off phase of their life now but a woman buying and selling wisely like a merchant that might that could be before they get you know have children before probably not a lot at with young children unless they're really good you know they're really business minded but you're gonna see this like my saw this with my mom more so as that the children got older I saw my mom like I said do his consignment business she started working at the I break clean the library clean sweep in the church when we got older and then helping out the the needy as she got older she was able to do some of these things now serving her family at all hours of the night she's prepared and alert for every emergency most sisters do that all the time right no matter what age of life you're in or stage of life rather planning preparing work for everyone the household I imagine mothers do that as soon as they have the little children soon as they can help out work actually I probably could put a YC right there probably YC once they get young children that's probably the stage that starts healthy and physically fit hopefully the mothers are taking care of themselves you know walk-in or exercising or something we got you got to take care of your bodies and then works with hands on older tools I'd imagine as a woman gets older and life she'll have more time to maybe have like a sewing or whatever she does or whatever business online business she might do I imagine that's with older children she you know she's able to have a little more free time and work with her hands on special tools and they're so here's the last slide for a home she prepares warm clothes for entire household I imagine she's constantly doing that making her own blankets that mate that may take time unless she's really good at sewing right away but if she learns uh so you know later on in life or she's able to you know do a lot of work meet the needs of her home you know with her own her own hands maybe that would happen later on life or whenever they can learn how to do that I that's just what I saw you know with my wife and my mother you know I was a little more experienced you know a little more a little more years or more years under their belt there anybody have some more time to do some of their own goods wares high quality clothes well hopefully they wear their best clothes all the time I remember we're not worried so much about quality as we are modesty that's what we're most concerned about but you wear the best clothes that you have and she's an extremely focused manager the Bible said she looks well to the stage of her house and then she doesn't eat the bread of idleness she's constantly working in the home so how many sisters feel good about those by God's grace no you have to raise your hands but see these are things these are all things that God you know anoints King Lemuel to say these are all virtuous things these things take strength how many sisters can say amen to that all these things waking up any hour and you have three or four sick kids and all these things these things take strength they take honor they take the anointing of God it's exactly right so I've talked to numerous women through school other things I said well I could never handle this many kids we stopped after one or we stopped after two they don't have the strength and honor to do it but for some reason you've got their strength and honor because you've got the Holy Ghost amen you've got God's Spirit inside of your soul hallelujah you see that some people don't have strength and do this they don't have the honor it takes but a godly woman will have this strength now the business ones I all love together these were again they would probably take place if you're really you know business minded maybe you with younger married with young children or married with older children or memory maybe when you get in this empty nest stage of your life you take initiative to work with your hands so you go get you get the materials you go get them and you bring them into your home or whatever you do it and you work with your hands there you take initiative you seek out wool and all these silk and everything and you start doing something you buy and sell wisely like a merchant you make deals so I can sell this here I can make a profit here it could help out the family now this one was business-minded this is the one about the field she foresaw a profit which was 20 years prior 20 15 years in advance and the Bible said with the fruits of her Labor's she invests in that field so that means she's already made a profit on other business deals she takes all that money she made off the previous business and she pours it into her next business amen her next profit this is a very virtuous woman that's very hard to find right and that's then she does long term investing all this vineyard is going to be good in about 20 years or once these vines grow and when it'll be it'll be fruitful and productive this is probably later on in life probably but again depends on how many children you have depends how many years between children right depends on the quality of your health your mental health and your physical health there's a lot of variables but this woman was able to pull off all of these attributes because she was anointed by God to do so and she produces high quality merchandise so she's gonna make belts or girdles she's gonna make the best girdles there are on the market I like that she's got the time to do this the time to invest and make sure this is a a one product and then she produces high quality clothing then she delivers it and sells it herself so she's watching over her goods does this help by God's grace I'm lumping them all together in category so you can see them now community and church this is where we see these are the the two main attributes we see how her she impacts her community not just and I forgot economically to I could have put that that up there she blesses the economy of the area - all right so this is probably when she's got older children or she's got an empty nest she seeks it helps the poor and needy that's what I saw my mother do when I was younger I know my mom did help people when we were younger but it really blossomed once we were all in high school and she had a little more free time we went off to school she could prepare things plan things get things ready it really started blossoming and now like we said almost 600 people a year are fed because my mother's efforts there to help the poor she's actively trying to help the poor and the Bible said she seeks it out she reaches her hand out to the poor so this is what sisters should look for and this is what brothers of course should do - to help the poor and remember her her godly character in her community is so godly that people look to her husband as a leader my if if her wife lives as godly he must be a godly man - how many want that testimony I do people will respect me in the community you know whether a Copley or whether boils down and they could somehow respect me for I don't know what reason they'd expect her bacne for but maybe they would say well we need a we need a civilians opinion on this road worker and this ballot issue it what would Jesse Smith say well I hope that my wife's character my character would be so great that they could trust our testimony this is what she had she lived such a godly life that they said we can trust this man because of his wife's testimony of course his testimony to the church that's all we were we were our godliness to impact not just the church not just our home but we want to impact a community amen glory and that's what I can see you know even in my life you know as I work in Copley I've had numerous families tell me how much they've been blessed by the work that I do but a member I'm not bragging it's not on me but I'm just sharing it as a testimony like I can see how this is true if you and I've been there 14 years now if you live a godly life in front of people they're gonna notice that you love Jesus and then they're gonna have it reputation is either good reputation or bad reputation and so our testimony should impact the community the church and the home it should impact all these places now these are the three attributes she should have that are everywhere home Community Church she should be anointed with strength and honor amen that should be her anointing the Bible said her clothing is strength and honor hallelujah and then also people should see she's not a prideful person she's not a bragger but she's humbly aware that her rejoicing lies in the future so she doesn't have a lot of time to throw parties she don't have a lot of time to to be involved in frivolous things going to sporting events sir you know frivolous things that she's gotta use her time wisely so people know that she's not she's humble she's not rejoicing right now her rejoicing her celebration is gonna be at the rapture hallelujah all right though marriage for the lamb right or at the white throne judgement she'll be rejoicing there he meant when she sees soul saved because of her efforts hallelujah amen she's gonna rejoice in time to come her life's not a party here her life's a ministry here amen her life is a blessing here she's so busy blessing others sure she's saving her rejoicing for the future amen and this is what I love about her and this is where we all can use help men and women she speaks wisely she doesn't open her mouth to tell jokes all the time or to be show sarcasm or things like that she opens her mouth with wisdom and she has the law that she's always kind that's her law her rules are a moist kind she has the law of kindness so she says wise things will have you prayed about this did you try this maybe you could try that can I help you out I could do this for you to try to help out your situation would you like me to help you out she says wise things and then whatever she says she says it with kindness by God's grace how many appreciate that by God's grace so I tried to just put put those in groups here so now we'll move on to this other little thought here just a small little thought I want to put in here remember this woman in the days of Solomon she excelled all the other women she was the most virtuous in other words the strongest of all women and she lived in a time where you know the days of Solomon how many know brother Branham said they were it was the he said it was the highlight time of Israel what he called the the kingdom age what'd he call it the Golden Age thank you brother John thank you I think my wife said it too it was the Golden Age of Israel so she wasn't living in a time where they were getting attacked she was living in a time of peace so we have to take that into consideration too you have to look at the the the situation of the culture you're living in so she lived in a culture where it was thriving economically and so she was turning profits all the time she was very good with business because that's what that it was a golden age economically there was peace she was not living in a time of war so she had all these resources all these all these uh well resources that had her and her fingertips and she put to good use and Solomon said nobody excelled more than her you gave her resources she put him to you she was humble with it she feared the Lord and she did good to her husband every day of her life amen and the Bible said she needs to be praised in other words people look at this woman say god bless you you are a fine example of a Christian woman your works have have just blessed so many thank you for serving the Lord you're such a wonderful Holy Ghost field Saint any words you can think to say to this godly Saint you'd say it oh never praising them with compliments you're such an example to me you're such a blessing to me I'm so glad you're at our church amen I trust that we've got sisters like that amen brothers like that where you can literally look them in the face and say thank you you're such a great blessing to our church you're such a blessing in the kingdom of God how do you ought to live to hear words like that amen because your works ought to praise you as well that's exactly right your work should praise you and not condemn you right your work should praise you too the Bible said when you're a Holy Ghost field st. you have zeal to do good works how do you understand that that means you just want to do something good to bless people's hearts that's right amen glory amen now let's just compare this I'd like I said I just want to give a brief thought here because remember these women were put in the Hall of Fame of faith we're giving two names and then we're just given a few others and let's just compare them briefly with these proverbs 31 attributes oh but remember again this proverbs 31 woman she excelled all the women of her day remember not everybody lived in the same type of day the Golden Age of Israel not everybody lived in that age so we got to take that into consideration now the first thing is Hebrews 11 verse 11 the Bible said Sarah received strength to conceive seed strength what was it about Sarah where she's in the Hall of Fame of faith she received the strength of God amen she didn't turn down God's strength she didn't reject God's strength and say well that's just for somebody else well I'm too old I couldn't be a blessing to somebody there's no way God could use me for that she humbled herself and received the Word of God we know she received correction from God in flesh in the messenger that came to her in the tenth right she received correction and she received the promise of God that this time next year you'll conceives you'll bring forth a son right amen so this made her in the Hall of Fame of faith by faith she received that strength so she heard the word and she believed it I hope that's how we come to church when you come to church you come here to receive a promise that will hold you for years to come amen if not you're just coming here for hope but the Bible said we got to receive faith and God's Word in other words say God reveal faith to me reveal your perfect will to me and let me walk by faith and not by sight amen I'm walking by faith what faith are you walking by well I'm walking by the faith I want to be in the rapture I believe I'll be in the rapture I'm also walking the faith that I believe will receive the latter rain because I don't see it like I think I need to see it right like I want to see it so I'm walking by faith trusting that will receive the latter rain which is rapturing peg they met and if not me then I mean the next generation by the grace of God that's the faith I'm receiving that's the faith that's what brings me back to church every time preaching sermon after sermon after sermon is the faith that I've received it's giving me strength to take the Word of God and act upon it amen hallelujah now see this up this strength directly goes with this proverbs 31 woman because she was clothed with strength how many remember that okay so see we see both attributes we see Sarah she's in the Hall of Fame because she receives strength and this proverbs 31 woman was strong in the Lord as well amen both women received strength from God and we know how it happened how did it happen because they feared God because outside of fear of God you don't have any wisdom right you have nothing so we know Sara had to fear God even though she laughed at God and God could have struck her dead she must have got some fear shortly after that are you with me she had to have in order to receive strength from God she had to fear God first oh it's so important to fear the Lord the only other woman that's listed by name is Rahab because she had respect to the spies the Bible said this one little short sense about Rahab yet she's in the Hall of Fame of faith she Rehan respect to the spies and now church this reminded me of Proverbs 31 27 where she looketh well to her household and she feared the Lord because remember what did she say she said give me a true token right give me a token so that my self and my house can be saved amen she had a desire for her family to be saved she was looking not just to the natural needs of the family but to the spiritual needs which ones are more important well spiritual most important but a real woman we know we'll meet both needs right spiritual and natural so see she had this attribute she had this godly nature about her but she cared about her household she did want to see them die she want to see them in an awful condition and she feared God she said all of us here in Jericho have heard about the mighty God that you serve amen and she said I fear that God I believe that God I respect that God and he even made her lie to the guards and God never as far as we know God never punished her for that lie in that striking God never punished Sara for her lie god never punished Rahab for her life and that's liking now I'm not telling you to lie I would never tell you to lie but perhaps in a situation like let me just give you a hypothetical situation maybe there's uh now remember this was under the Old Testament before the Holy Ghost but maybe there's a missionary you know and and they were in a country that might kill them or something like that and maybe they would lie I don't know perhaps God would honor that but I just believe in this day we've got the Baptist holy ghost I just leave God was sent His angels and do a miracle amen so the person wouldn't have to lie but we do have those facts to women lied one lied in the very presence of God behind his back you know in the tenth so in that area she lied or she laughed at God lied and then here Rahab lies to save these messengers and God puts her in the Hall of Fame of faith for that all right see she cared about her she cared about God she had fear of God she cared about her family and God puts her in the Hall of Fame of faith man what is what a statement next women are mentioned the Bible said women received their dead raised to life again now and it gives the my Bible gave two references Elijah and Elijah both had a widow war oh I'm sorry not a widow with one hand a widowed woman and what was a married woman both had children that died and they read and they prayed for the child and both raised from the dead what was it about both of those women both of those women kept going to the prophet of God they didn't give up faith they had faith they had strength they didn't give up on God they didn't give him the fear they believed God's Word and that's what this woman had she had strength she wasn't afraid and if they were afraid they overcame it amen remember the one in 2nd Kings for that was the woman that said all as well they said she said hi how you doing she said all as well all's well God gave me this son and even though the son has died I know God gave me the son by thus saith the Lord and God is going to if not gave me this child God's gonna take care of this child or we should pray that for our children amen if God gave me that child then God's gonna heal this child amen God's gonna save this child God's gonna use this child for the glory of God but we've got to have strength and faith like those women did we have to have the testimony that all is well amen that God will keep his word honey no God keeps his word Church hallelujah yes strength these are godly women that God highlighted in the chapter on faith in Hebrews 11 they received strength they received spies they received the messengers of God they feared God and they had faith to believe that even the darkest hour God was with them is God with you tonight Church is God with you even if it's a dark hour even if it's a hard hour even if it's a discouraging hour lonely hour whatever the kind of hour is we must know that God is with us amen okay now I think I finished that now I'm gonna go on to this my son I'm gonna finish with this and I got plenty of time I got thirty minutes so I'm gonna finish with that so that's what I thought I thought I'd have time to finish both of these enough by the grace of the Lord amen now I hope those are about four and a half sermons wears for four and a half so about 4.5 4 and a half sermons on a proverbs 31 woman I help I hope it helped our sisters I hope it took away any of the doubt or fear well I'll never be as good as that remember it's not about doing everything she did it's about doing all that you're called to do that she did remember Dorcas or Tabitha what did she do she had the clothes that she made for the kids that's all that we know about Dorcas is that she cared about kids kids who were cold and she wasn't going to let them just say well I'll pray for you I hope you get warmer she was gonna make clothes for them to make sure they were warmer praise the Lord so these are exam that we should see in the scripture we should learn from these so I trust our sisters you know enjoy their Mother's Day sermon a few weeks early by God's grace like I said I don't know if I'll preach on Mother's Day or Mother's on Mother's Day or not we'll see what the Lord leads us to now let's see if you got your Bibles let's go to back to proverbs chapter 27 let's go back there let's finish up this my son thought here proverbs 27 woe I turn right there praise God verse 11 this is the 22nd time and you've been very patient with me I've gone through I'm trying to go through all 23 I've already gone through 21 of these my son Solomon directly speaks probably two to Jeroboam or Raya boom and he says my son listen to my words 27 11 now let's get back to this here verse 11 my son be wise and make my heart glad that I may answer him that reproaches me I'm just gonna read this one scripture because this is quite an interesting thought and I'm gonna read you what Matthew Henry said about this so he's saying my son be wise make me glad that I may answer him that reproaches me that in other words then I may answer him that abrades me or defies me so at some point this father is just going to be be upgraded or be rebuked by somebody somebody's gonna try to get in the father's face and say something bad about his family the father knows that how many ever how many ever had somebody get in your face and say some real ugly things anybody ever had that this dad knew somebody is going to get my face and try to rail me upbraid me so he says my son be wise so that when this day comes I can answer this person with the right answer that kind of sounds odd but let me hear you let me show you what Matthew Henry says Matthew Henry of course was a Bible scholar truly anointed to teach on God's Word here's what he said children are here exhorted to be wise and good that they may be a comfort their parents and make their hearts glad even when the evil days come so no recompense them for their care that they may be a credit to them now here's where I want to get that I may answer him that reproaches me with having been over strict or severe and bringing up my children so this is what Matthew Henry said would happen in the days of Israel some people might go up to fathers and say you are too stricter you were too severe on your children and having taken a wrong method with them in restraining them from the liberties which other young people takes in other words another father might come up and say well why didn't you let your children do this and your way to stricter you should have be more relaxed you should love your children more and the whole time you were loving your children more but see they just love sin right so he says son be wise because there's gonna come a day when other men are gonna come and try to upbraid me for how I raised you and live such a godly life that I can answer them with a good answer whether they say the proof is in the what the pudding the proof of our parenting is often in our children right many times it is now there's some like we said with Esau there's some times if they're not elected to salvation you just do the best you can only God knows so he says my son be wise and then it will appear in the effect that I went the wisest way to work with my children so when parents come and yell at me they're upset with me how I raise my children that they'll see that I actually chose the right way they chose the wrong way but I chose the right way he says those that have been blessed with a religious education should in everything conduct themselves so as to be a credit to their education and to silence those who say a young saint and old devil so you see there's some people that say oh they're gonna be fine when they're young but when they get older they're gonna go sow their Wild Oats right and to prove to the contrary so we're trying to prove those people wrong we're gonna raise them godly and they'll grow up and be godly amen all those that who are elected to eternal life all those that are for Dane we're not going to let people come and in other words he's saying son don't let people come and say that I didn't raise you the right way live such a godly life that people can say my these parents pointed their children to Christ they pray for them to receive Christ and then they actually receive Christ's spirit amen that's what he's saying here when they come to reproach me that I'll have an answer for them about how I raised you I like that let me go back here's the twenty third and final time hard to believe let's go to chapter 27 I'm sorry chapter 31 verse two I've already read this one but let's just read it for the sake of it so you've read it 23 times and like I said the Holy Spirit just kept I felt just a nudge every time I read through each chapter I'm like there's another my son there's another my son there's another my son I kept noting this I kept noted noticing this and I believe it's been a blessing to our children and I hope our parents as well 23 times the wisest man on earth says my son listen to me of course we know our daughters can gain from that as well when applied correctly so 31 verse 2 what my son and what the son of my womb and what the son of my vows so this is the mother of the future King Lemuel mother and number we already preached this but he's saying what don't you know that you're going to be a king someday and stay away from wine and evil women and then he she's a give a voice to the poor and the afflicted judge righteously because you're gonna be a king someday hallelujah so that concludes the 23 times that Solomon said my son in the book of Proverbs now I want to go through so have your Bibles handy maybe we can have the young children read those if we I don't know if they have their Bibles with them or not because there's other times the Bible literally says what a wise son will make their parents feel like and we did not read all these I think one or two we read but we did not read all these so these are not repeats except maybe one let's go to proverbs chapter 10 verse 1 let's go proverbs 10 verse 1 how many love the wisdom of God the Bible said it should taste like honey if you've got the Holy Ghost it should taste like honey because you're a wise virgin you love the wisdom of God convers 10 verse 1 the problems of solomon a wise son maketh a what father glad father but a foolish son is the heaviness of his mother you ever seen that I've seen numerous mothers that their children have gone astray and they just they have a heaviness about him they're so burdened they're so sad like I've had like I told you in Guyana I've had mothers sit across the table and say don't forget to pray for my son and my husband they're lost and they're gone astray and I raised them the right way I raised them in the message I raised them in church and they've just shook my hand said don't you forget to pray for my son Church that'll have an impact on you when somebody when some mother does that what what is that it's her heaviness in her heart because her son is not doing what she taught him right and so she wants a man of God if she wants other people she wants God to hear more prayers that God might answer her prayers and bring her son to Christ like when I was out there in New York last time I had numerous sisters I told you about it please pray for my pastor he's going through an awful time and would you pray for my pastor so I'm lifting up his name and another woman saying will you pray for my son and my husband it's interesting you know in New York and in Guyana both places they just looked at my eyes and looked me in the eye dead serious and said will you please pray for them don't forget to pray for them so I said okay let me write it down so I don't forget because I'm going to forget and I look at these women and I know they're serious they've got a heaviness they've got a burden and church God knows if we got a burden something that we're just we're just trying to act spiritual right Oh pray for me keep me in prayer well are we just saying that to be spiritual or do we really desire those prayers see it creates a heaviness when a boy when a son or daughter won't listen their parents it makes the parents heavy with a burden they care they care so much they've done all they can do to point their children to Christ and yet they still leave the Word of God but what does a wise son or daughter do it makes a glad mother and father children how do you want to make your which one of you want to make your parents glad alright then be wise learn wisdom learn what to do when you have all these choices learn to make the right choice ask your parents right ask your pastor look to the Word of God look at verse 2 treasures of wickedness profit nothing so it's my son listen as America treasures of wickedness profit nothing but righteousness delivereth from death amen the Lord will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish but he casteth away the substance of the wicked he becometh poor that deals with a slack hand but the hand of the diligent maketh rich he that gather then summer is a wise son but he that sleeper than harvest is a son that causes shame amen so what does a wise son do he works when it's time to work right he makes his parents glad by doing wise decisions proverbs 13 1 let's go there 13 1 these are all scriptures about wise sons and I don't think I read them so I think they're fresh to us has anybody ever reading in Proverbs lately has anyone been reading in Proverbs okay just me alright praise the Lord then this should all be fresh to you 13 1 a wise son here with his father's instruction but a scorner heareth not rebuke so in other words a wise son will take correction from his father and daughters there's new first times I told Malachi Liddy I've had to correct him on things like a Mac I'll just tell one example where you did a really good job I asked me how I take out the trash last year well he would take the trash bag and just throw it in the black container and I just had to show him one time I said Malachi you can't just throw it in there because there's another bag in there and if that bags full and you throw it in there it's not gonna or if it's not full but if it's falling over it's just gonna fall in there and then that bag might spill in other words you got to get the little trash bag in the big trash bag I said to show my son one time and had no more mistakes after that that's just one small example of how he took my correction and I first told him I appreciate you taking out the trash but I don't want to pick up that kitty litter anymore you know what whatever it was that was spilled or tissues or you know whatever foods you know a few food scraps I want to pick up the food scraps but see children if you can take correction it'll make your parents so happy you got to learn from that first mistake that's called first-time obedience you know and and obeying the first time that will make your parents happy verse that was verse one but see ass corner I don't care what dad says imagine Malik I just walked in there I'll just throw it in there you can guarantee on that second time around it was said maokai come out to meet with the garage you're gonna fix this and you're gonna pick this up yourself but I didn't have to do that thank God and that's what a wise son does or daughter they listen to correction they can be corrected they can do it right the next time let's go to 15-20 proverbs 15 20 and remember that ability to be taught the ability or I should say the nature of being a learner is one of the most valuable attributes for Christian where you can continue to be corrected by the Word of God the attitude where I'm coming to church to learn I'm coming to church to be a better Christian if you can keep that it proves you're a real Christian because pride will often come up in people's hearts where you can't teach me nothing I know more than you I know all about it come on get me excited about God go ahead and try and then even God couldn't get them excited about God because they're not receiving God's channel to be reset to be receiving the word through the preaching of the word and so children you got to keep that humble attitude you can meet you want to be taught you want to learn things better you want to get smarter right you want to be more wise you want people to correct you I know it's hard to feel that sometimes but we have to have that ability I'm going to preach a whole sermon on that because it's all through Proverbs there's two kinds of people there's a scorner that won't be corrected and there's somebody that's called a learner in the Bible we're gonna choose to be one of the other you're they're gonna learn from the preacher learn from your Christian friends or you're just gonna make fun of them or degrade them behind their back you're the only new one or the other you can't do both and so having a teachable spirit is valuable in the sight of God hallelujah 15:20 I said yeah that's right fifteen twenty maokai can you read that for me okay so we see contrast again or why Sun makes his dad happy but a foolish one despises his mother okay so children always love your mother she's the one that corrects you the most you got to love her the most all right children look at me you got to love your mom's the most okay I'm I'm getting good I'm getting good eye contact here I appreciate that you need to love your mother them oh don't be upset with your mom don't be upset with your mountain love your mother make her glad proverbs 28 7 let's go there proverbs 28 7 we're getting close to some of these good ones 28 7 maybe Lydia can read this for me I'll start with my children why'd you have a Bible okay and then we're back together by with you okay Thank You Brooke okay should you have a Bible okay all right kay so Lydia can you read 28 7 all right so we get the understanding there if you keep the Word of God if you keep your parents commands that makes you wise you don't have to worry about well I can't figure out a Rubik's Cube Rubik's Cube I must not be smart or something like that that's not wisdom well I can do a Rubik's Cube in 10 seconds who cares that's not wisdom wisdom is obeying your parents wisdom is keeping the Word of God I don't know algebra I don't know trigonometry I never even took a class on trigonometry the highest I got was college algebra too I think was highs I never got to college geometry so I couldn't say I'm not very smart but that's not really what wisdom is because the sinner can send a man to the moon right a sinner can be president United States but that doesn't make one wise somebody that loves God makes you eyes something that keeps the command of God makes you wise some of that honors your parents that makes you wise see that that's verse 7 there and also goes back to your companions who do you hang out with children do you hang out with my children I see graffiti all the time on the stop signs and maokai and i often talk about that why would somebody write spray-paint on that stop sign why would they do that what three or do they get out of the doing that it's so silly it's so foolish to do that well let's just go let's go let's go break-in some mailboxes like some of my friends used to do let's go toilet paper there trees now I did that a couple of times that was foolish of me as a boy growing up but see if you hang around people that riot and make destruction you're a fool but as soon as you leave them and run to God now you're wise amen now God can do something with you because you're one to keep God's commands that's right I never got in a much public destruction I don't think I ever did graffiti or anything like that but even if that's a children's give an example oh let's go in the bathroom and and then the star let's scratch some dirty words on the wall look that's still destruction right that's still rioting that's still doing unlawful things under the law because if you can out of the law you'll certainly honor God you can't honor man how can you honor God if you can't love man how can you love God that's what God says we must honor our parents that will prove we love God two more chapter 29 verse 3 I see it all the time my school or they try to destroy pencils you know they'd break pencils and they stab pencils into erasers you know just destroying property or they'll one time and they took a sharpie marker wrote cuss words all over the playground equipment and they got away with it but I wish I could have caught him I really would have gave him a real lecture because I can't you know we that's all we can do is just lecture them but I would love that I love when I catch people you know the little children because I want to correct them I want them to respect their teachers I want them to respect or I've caught people in the bathroom boys in the bathroom you know playing around throwing paper towels in the toilets and I didn't make them get it out of there but I wish I could have to teach them a lesson that if they don't if they can't respect man then they'll never be respected by God simple lessons like that but member they stay with you like I told you I got whipped one time with a leather belt and I never did that again also took me was one time so I hope children I hope that was wisdom in me I hope that means I'm wise I believe it does you know just cause of my own testimony but if you obey and keep the commands it makes you a wise person that's right 29 verse 3 all right now this is we're here this is what we all want to see his parents who so loveth wisdom rejoices his father Oh glory that's what I pray for that so I want to see a my children I'm sure brother John and all of us want to see an arc tune children that love the wisdom of God in other words they just want to keep reading God's Word or reading sermon books and and understanding God more and more and more that will make your parents rejoice amen children that love wisdom they're more interested in the wisdom of God than anything else hallelujah that makes your parents that makes your parents heart rejoice my my son wants to he wants to grow in wisdom he loves reading the Word of God or my daughters they love reading God's Word that's what all parents want I want to just I want to do right I want to help somebody I want to see my friends say but I want to witness to my teacher I don't know witness to this verse and children that love God's Word love the wisdom of God makes your parents rejoice Oh hallelujah but he that keepeth company with harlots spent with his substance so again the opposite your company bad company corrupts good character that's a pretty serious awful company right there harlots but loving wisdom so this would apply as they get older to trust when our children get older that when they have the choice like once they turn 18 they can move out right according to the law but I trust that all of our children will make the choice I'm gonna stay under my parents wisdom and leadership until I feel God calling me to leave the house weathers through marriage college or whatever whatever it is I can afford my own apartment now but you see I trust that they'll sit under the wisdom of the Holy Spirit and put themselves around the right kind of individuals surround themselves with godly influences that's verse three right keep with company the hearts spin it's okay loves wisdom for example I want to see my children when they're 18 let's say let's say 19 or 20 they get married move out I want to see them on a Sunday morning right here to hear the word of God or wherever their home church is it blessed my heart a few weeks ago uh what was that doing I don't know where I was that I don't know where I was that but I walked in here I think I was out I think I oh I went to go pick up brother Troy when you Brent remember brother Troy I was here on a Sunday morning I came back and I just got here five minutes before service and look up at the screen in the the fellowship room and two of my children are here at the altar praying and I didn't ask him to well what I've been trying to do as I've been trying to train them to do that to understand if you want to get something from God you've got to be in contact with God because if you draw near to God is God gonna avoid you during service no he's gonna draw nigh to you draw nigh to God he'll draw nigh to you but that just bless my heart as a father like I want to see that though as they get older where it's free will where they'll get up early and their own bed on a Sunday morning or there they'll come on ass Wednesday night of their own accord and they'll love the Word of God so much that they'll be here every time to hear God's Holy Word amen that will make this guy rejoice do you think I'm happy now I'll be a lot happier then by God's grace because of the Bible says it rejoices the heart of a father last one verse 17 correct thy son and he will give the rest yay he should give delight unto thy soul that's the promise we have as parents if we correct our children whether verbally or with the rod or however we do it how do we correct them we have this hope that if we correct them they're gonna bring us a lot of blessings this is the promise of the scripture we're promised rest and a light unto our souls if we correct them how many know that as they get older it gets harder to correct let me know that so we got to start as soon as possible right or as soon as we feel that of the Holy Spirit it's just got to be consistent correction we got to constantly whenever we need whenever we need to do it correct them and let them know if we see it as a parents how much more is God seeing it God has eyes everywhere right his eyes run to and fro on the earth now I just want to read this quote maybe you I heard this recently brother Rams asking for prayer for his family and don't forget pray for me and pray for my wife the sweetest woman in all the world and for my children and I now I've claimed them everyone for the Lord Jesus now Becky is just at the age of little ricotta you've know little teeny as we used to call and she's just at that age but now she's a very sweet girl I thank the Lord for that no smoking drinking to run around nothing but she's just that age she's carefree she don't want to go to church you imagine that she's in the prophet's house and no one didn't want to go hear a prophet preach the Word of God TV I let children me children we gotta let them teenagers be teenagers he just committed it unto God she don't want to go to church and if she does she sits back there chew chewing gum so brother branham had seen his daughter chewing gum during the service I wonder if the Deacons asked her to go spit it out or not they should have if I see any use chewing gum in here I'm asking you to spit it out to you that I see I wonder to see it I want her to be filled with the Holy Ghost that so when you get the Holy Ghost you must want to go to church and step chewing on gum you want to chew on God's promises his wisdom I want to chew on that again preach that again let me hear that again raise my faith amen and I like this one and I want to see Joseph now remember we've been preaching on my son I want to see Joseph I want that boy I believe that someday when I can't walk to the pulpit no more I want to take this old worn-out Bible and hand it over to him and say Joseph stay with it son then I'm ready to climb on up I want to hear a wind blowing somewhere look up wave my hand and take off look at a Father's heart and that just like a Father's heart he wants to see all of his children loving to go to church loving the Word of God fill with the Holy Ghost and then he wants to take his Bible and hand it to his son and say you preach it to you preach the same thing I preached I've long desired that maybe God will call Malachi to preach one day I don't know but I as a I think all fathers there's a tire of that don't you they want to see their sons be leaders maybe not preachers but be leaders somehow to be able to know that the next generation is going to honor the Word of God that my son everything I taught my son everything my son heard preached he's gonna believe it and he's gonna live it and he's gonna keep following those bloody footprints of Jesus Christ amen this is a desire of a father I just want to I want to see my son stay with the Word of God amen in other words what's he's saying he said I want to be a rejoicing father I want to rejoice in my son and my daughters I got well I got one minute will I keep my one minute or not give me five here cuz I just got just got a few more slides I'll be done with this whole thought now look here I'll show ya I just got a few more slide yeah it's got three I got three more three more so give me five minutes let me set this again now I got six minutes here they just reset it I gotta finish here just let me finish by God's grace I just need a fresh start here bear with me now this brought me the thought brother brand was thinking about his natural son this brought me to the thought of pause spiritual sons and we don't have time to read all these but you're probably familiar with some of them Paul calls the entire Corinthian church my son's because he started the church that's in first corinthians 4 14 through 17 let's read that - I think that's what I like to read here cuz this I think this is the one where he says remember yeah remember my ways through Timothy which I taught him and I teach everywhere in every church first corinthians 4:14 please and then maybe Elijah Rebekah could you read some of those that'd be okay I think it's your turn if that's okay Elijah could you do 14 and 15 would I be alright 1st Corinthians 4 14 and 15 then Rebecca maybe if you could do 16 and 17 maybe I'd be okay whenever you're ready Elijah 14 I'm sorry about 14 15 yes sir so he called all these men in the Corinthian church might be loved' sons so Paulette look out of the church and say you bunch of rebels like Moses did he said I'm warning you because you're my beloved sons I love you but I've got to warn you you're getting caught up on gifts there's sin in the church remember their sexual sins in the church there's all these things going on the church I'm warning you to stay away from that and he says though you have ten thousand instructors in Christ you have not many fathers because Paul begot them to Christ now the begot means to birth how we know that so that means these people receive the baptism the Holy Ghost under Paul's ministry alright so Rebecca could you try sixteen and seventeen timotheus all right thanks add your Rebecca I appreciate that how did you catch that Paul calls all the men my beloved sons and then he says Timothy my son he says follow me he tells all the church follow my example I'm the one you received the Holy Ghost I'm the ministry you receive the Holy Ghost under he says so follow my example and then he says listen to Timothy because Timothy learned everything he learned from me and he said he's gonna Timothy is gonna teach you everything that that I know praise God so these are spiritual sons a spiritual son is someone that got the Holy Ghost through your ministry right in this case Timothy was a spiritual son to Paul and I like that he taught everything that Paul preached amen that's what I believe I do by the grace of the Lord now he calls him son for numerous more times in 1st Timothy 1 1 & 2 verse 18 as well 2nd Timothy 1 verse 2 now look at this church Paul even circumcised Timothy before going on many missionary trips because the Jews didn't like him he was half Greek after you he said we can't have this this mixed person with us he's mixed so Paul said fine we'll circumcise him he went and circumcised Timothy and they went on many trips and then the Jews would receive him and not only that but Paul knew the prophecies about Timothy's gifts the Bible said there was prophecies that were set over Timothy when he before he started the ministry he's going to be a missionary he'll be an evangelist he'll be a preacher of God's Word all these things he's must say the Lord in the name of Jesus Christ Timothy here impart of what the gift of the Holy Ghost to preach God's Word and Paul knew that and so he learned under Paul he got saved under Paul's ministry Paul taught him everything he knew and then Paul could trust him that Timothy is gonna teach everything I teach amen onesimus in Philemon 1 verse 10 remember the story Onesimus had run away from Philemon remember that he was a slave he'd run away and he stole things from Philemon and so he was on the we must have thought even on the way to see Paul there's my timer again I'm trying to finish it and he must have gotten the presence of Paul and the Holy Spirit convicted him and made him repent and who nessam escaped under Paul's ministry and then Paul turns around right Philemon a letter and said whatever Onesimus owes you he's my son the gospel put it on my account and I'll pay you back these are Paul's spiritual sons someone you lead to Christ someone that you someone that you pray for and they get the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's your spiritual that's a man's spiritual son in the Lord now I know for sure I prayed over people and they've got the Holy Ghost cuz they've told me but I don't think any of this church so I'm not really their spiritual father in a way like where Paul he could pray for them they get the Holy Ghost and then they would learn everything from Paul that's what I would like to see that in Akron if God terry's I would like to pray for some man they'd be filled with the Holy Ghost and then they would learn everything I taught them that I would know that they're younger than me that when I left the scene or God called me off the scene I know somebody would be there to teach them the Word of God I would like that now I need to start praying for that because I'm getting older now x times fine I need to start praying for that I started out as a 25 year old pastor and I'm close to 40 you know so I need to think about those things but he led him to Christ while he was in prison and lastly let's say our feet here I'm gonna disclose her lastly Paul calls Titus my son in the faith in Titus was also converted through Paul's ministry so see Paul had all these sons there were people that they saw Christ in Paul's life they got saved or they got baptized with the Holy Ghost and then they wouldn't Alert from Paul or Paul would place them and say you know you need to stay you need to stay in this city and you're gonna be a pastor I believe God's leading you to stay here and be a pastor you're gonna be a bishop Titus or Timothy you're gonna be an event do the work of evangelist make full proof of your ministry now that this is not organizational leave the leadership right this is not a denominational this is all that of the Holy Spirit it's different if somebody tells you well the board of directors at the Missionary Baptist Church told me you have to stay in Akron for five years that's man lead it's different but if someone some sister prophesizes I'm brother prophesize say thus saith the Lord this preacher you so-and-so you're got to get the pastoring you'll be pastoring Akron in 20 years or five years whatever God that's different that's not man placing a person there that's God placing you there and that's what Timothy had he had a prophecy that went over his life thus saith the Lord Timothy he's gonna be the first bishop their own that's what I'm they're not Bishop Tyrone Bishop to Ephesus that's what brother Branson Timothy was the first bishop of Ephesus so he had the state the Lord he he wasn't guessing I wonder if Timothy's gonna be a good preacher I wonder if he'll stick it out I wonder if he'll give up after a few years he knew this man has a prophecy over his life I've seen him get born again in fact I was just listened to brother bran this week and he said he was talking about a woman in the message letting off the pressure and he just did a funeral for a woman an old mother and he looks out at during the funeral and he says children could you ask for a better mother and they said no he said could you ask for a better one to love you and they said no brother branham said he said how could this woman now he's at the funeral looking at the casket how could this woman not rise again if a flower can die and rise again how can this woman who has all this witness of godly life with godly children live true to her husband all those days if she lived true to her husband did all these things godly how could she not rise again amen hallelujah and program said I know she's gonna rise again because I had the pleasure of seeing life come into her when she got the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so he saw eternal life come into her so he said I know I'll see her rise again he was a witness of this person being birth in the kingdom of God amen last scriptures that is my last night look that's my lesson third john 1:1 - four familiar but in this context I hope it has a little more power to your life to your heart and mind third John 1 the to the well-beloved Gaius whom I love in the truth beloved I wish above all things that thou mayest prosper and be in health even as I saw prosperous for I rejoice greatly when the Brethren came and testified of the truth that is in thee even as thou walkest in the truth I have no greater joy than to hear that my children walk in the truth amen children there's nothing you can do to make your parents happier than to love Jesus Christ with all your heart and the walk in truth now that's not why you do it you know you you do it because you love Jesus Christ you love the cross you want to be forgiven you for God so loved the world you love God because of God loved you but part of that part of the effect of loving God and loving Christ is that your children your parents will never be happier when you walk in the truth I remember the truths got to be in you too you gotta have the born-again experience got to have it inside you the truth must be in you you must walk in it and then the the Saints and the the elders the parents they have no greater joy than that and let me see if I read proverbs 23 15 yet I might have already read that I can't remember so part of me yeah my son if thine heart be wise my heart shall rejoice even mine amen praise the Lord let's stop right there by the grace of Lord hallelujah I love this Word of God I truly love this Word of God as we clothes here let's think about all these things I'm just looking back through my notes here I'm sure all of our sisters here want to be sisters of strength how many would say that Sarah Rahab got placed in the Hall of Fame of faith for receiving strength from God I wonder if we could receive some strength tonight receive a little extra strength tonight by the grace of God and then for our children of course all of us to even adults can learn from these things but to be wise by being wise you save yourself so much pain and you bring so much joy children to your parents when you make the right decisions and you walk in the truth so let's pray to God give us grace to accomplish all those I'm gonna pray also that God will give me a spiritual son to someone that if this work goes on they'll be taught the Word of God and be able to carry on if something should ever happen to me by the grace of Lord I think they'd be good time to pray for this because they got preached today let's bow our heads with a word of Prayer Heavenly Father Lord we're grateful for today father I pray for our sisters tonight Lord God I don't need to ask them to raise their hand maybe tonight I know Lord I believe all of them want to receive your strength dear God Sara by faith receive strength rahab by faith hid the spies to the saving of her household Lord God this woman that's more strong more
