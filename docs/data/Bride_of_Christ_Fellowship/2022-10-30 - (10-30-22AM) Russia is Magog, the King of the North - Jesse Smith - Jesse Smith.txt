Vu is his name but the amen had an unspoken need we'll take that to the Lord in prayer here today anyone else have a need they'd like remembered here sister Nina yes amen definitely prayed for that anyone else have a need here but Austin all right yes sir praise the Lord Hallelujah also just a few uh announcements um I don't know if you saw that next Sunday they're having a Youth Event up in

Sheffield if if you'd like to if you have time and you want to show them some fellowship we could all drive up there it would take the place of our second service but if people can't drive out there you know my wife will probably just go with the Teeny my teenagers and then I'll stay here and we'll just have a regular service you know so just you know think about that pray about that that's next Sunday yeah it's an at least an hour and 15 minutes from here at least yeah then you know if there's traffic or anything like that and so I think it's a full service right that if I'm not mistaken preaching and things like that and song special so it starts at five is that right five or five thirty so 7 30 end of it and then Fellowship eight be home by yeah so you gotta take all that all that into consideration there um the following Sunday I put out there on the counter will do communion because brother Vang Sia my wife did not get a chance to do communion the last time because uh the funeral and my wife I think was still not feeling well at that point so those are all the updates there by God's grace let's bow our heads here for a word of prayer ask God to minister to these

foreign [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] foreign take a new subject I haven't really addressed for a long time I never addressed this individually I like to look at Russia is Magog the King of the North I'd like to just do some teaching here by God's grace Russia is Magog the King of the North so Ezekiel 38 verses 1 through 3 and then we'll go to Daniel 11 verse 40. of course the war with Russian Ukraine is still going on and um you know I can only preach things as the Lord leads me and I know the the war's been going on here for about uh about nine months by God's grace but I was surprised to find out it was actually the fourth war that Putin has engaged in so uh you know there's been a lot said about this war and a lot of preachers had said a lot of things about it I just like to preach about Russia from the scripture that we know that the scripture is actually speaking of Russia so I hope this will be a blessing today we're just going to cover this topic and of course some a few other current events by God's grace so this subject is more of a current event and a little teaching here on the place of Russia in the scripture Ezekiel 38 1-3 and the warlord came unto me saying son of man set thy face against GOG the land of Magog the chief Prince of meshech and tubal and prophesy against him and say thus saith the Lord God behold I am against thee ogog the chief Prince of meshech and tubal so Gog is just a general name for the leader of the land of Magog Magog is a land North of Israel So Daniel 11 verse 40. here's where we get the King of the North you've maybe heard brother random say watch Russia the King of the North the Holy Spirit told Brother Branham that in 1933 watch Russia the King of the North brother Ram said that was thus saith the Lord but he said that's not the main one to watch so we're supposed to watch Russia but Russia is not the main one to watch but the RAM said the main Wonder watch is the purple curtain Rome So Daniel 11 verse 40. so let's read this one together if we can here by God's grace I'd like to hear all your voices on this beautiful morning let's read this on three one two three and at the time of the end shall the King of the South push at him and the King of the North shall come against him like a whirlwind with chariots and with Horsemen and with many ships and he shall enter into the countries and shall overflow and pass over amen let's have one more word of prayer if you have a need on your heart let's make anointing to God God is the one who can meet every need all of us have no power all we can do is point to the power point to the absolute point to Jesus Christ praise God and that's what we do today Heavenly Father we just come in the mighty name of Jesus Christ Lord God thank you for satisfying us with your love Lord no matter what the events of today hold even the events of our future we know this you love us dear God and we are satisfied with that the Bible calls it great love the Bible said your love was commended to us that while we were sin sinners Christ died the righteous for the unrighteous thank you God for your amazing love thank you for Amazing Grace for Lord you are love God is love Lord God is Charity so we thank you Lord that you are the very essence of love your Holy Spirit speaks all this love and mercy to us we give you glory here today and we magnify your Holy Name bless each and every one who pressed their way out to the house of God thank you God lord we can be back together again Lord God we just pray your spirit will speak expressly here this this morning Father God give us wisdom and understanding that we might be prepared for your coming in Jesus Christ's name and the saint said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God so I wanted just to take here uh this morning's message and look at Russia as I said I don't know if I've ever preached on this individually I do have some scriptures to show and some quotes and everything like that I think this would be a good lesson I've probably listened about four or five sermons on Russia you know uh different ones I've tried to go go through all the quotes Brotherman gave about Russia as the King of the North so I just trust it'll be a help to you it's been helped to me these last few days I think the last three or four days I've been studying on Russia so the purpose is you know we're seeking God for Revelation about the end times and really that's because you know each day we're getting closer to the Rapture praise God and so you know we can all say just generally we're closer to the Rapture than we ever have before but you know the the fact what I've seen over the last 10 months or so I shouldn't say 10 maybe nine or eight is that a lot of prominent preachers you know around this message and you know even other ones are saying that this Russia Ukraine war is a sign of the Rapture like it's one of the it's a sign that the Rapture is very soon well of course logically the Rapture is closer today right but uh but is that true is that true that this war in particular is a sign of the Rapture now I was as I was just reading a little bit online there it says Putin has had at least four Wars I remember one of them is Crimea and I can't remember the other one but the other three uh but he's had now four Wars and there's a lot of different reasons why but we'll go through the scripture and we'll see why eventually Russia will invade Israel that's really where they're coming for uh at least according to the scripture now we have a lot of different thoughts you know so a lot of different quotes from Brother Branham on this so I'll be sharing those the best as I can and giving you the scriptures on it uh by the God's grace but have your Bible ready we'll be reading out of uh numerous passages here this morning I want to start with the scripture praise God because brother Adam says we can't do anything without having scripture praise God you can't understand anything without having the scripture first so we want to put the scripture first and we'll look at a few statements brother Ram gives with thus saith the Lord we'll give we'll give that because God has sent a prophet to this last time praise God and he I would say you know he was a he had a special Ministry of restoration he He restored our hearts back to the apostolic fathers praise God he finished the mysteries of God all the all the all the topics the Bible calls mystery that's been revealed to us praise God but brother man wasn't like a Bible writer prophet because a Bible writer Prophet imagine imagine being Isaiah you have 66 chapters where every single word is thus saith the Lord imagine that praise God imagine that every single word Ezekiel had over 40 uh if I'm not saying 50 chapters Ezekiel maybe 52 I just read through that recently uh 52 chapters in every word is thus saith the Lord so brother Ram was definitely a prophet but we wouldn't say a Bible writing Prophet because we cannot add or take away from the prophecy that's in this book praise God brother man realize that you know in the course of his ministry the Holy Spirit showed him uh you know uh the Seven Seals and the seals on the back side of the book he said the Holy Spirit showed him it cannot be anything outside the Bible whatever Mysteries there are they have to be already contained in the scripture praise God and so that's what we uh put our faith in we put our faith in the word of God and a real Prophet like brother random will only point us to the word of God now what's different about today is that we have brother man's voice on tape so we have his human thoughts and we also have his Divine thoughts most prophets we don't have both of those and the amount that we have today yes we have some of Moses's thoughts and and we know they were human and Abraham's thoughts and different ones even Jeremiah you know saying I'll never preach again but then the Holy Ghost gets on him and says I've got fire in my bones of course I'll prophesy again and you know we have some of their human thoughts but but we have so many human thoughts of brother Branham and so what we need is the holy spirit today to guide us to the truth praise God and that's what the Holy Ghost is meant to do brother man says the Holy Ghost will only point you to the word of God it will only point you to the truth of the scriptures praise God and so that's what we're doing today we're going to look at the things brother Ram said and then we've got to take everything back to the word of God hallelujah now just just to give you an idea gogame is mentioned five times Gog itself is 16 hits some of them referred to you know earlier times in in Bible History gay or magogs mentioned 11 times brother random uh I didn't see how many times he said that so I forgot to put that number in there King of the North mentioned six times brother by Brother Branham it has seven hits in the Bible all in the Book of Daniel and brother random said the word Russia over 394 times now I just looked up the ones that had thus saith the Lord on it because those would be the most important ones and I didn't have time in these last few days to study 394 quotes but these are the ones I got through I got through the ones that have strike through lines there uh I think it's interesting Church China is in Revelation 16 2 called the Kings of the East because it's all based upon Israel right Israel so uh China is east of Israel right Russia is North of Israel Egypt is south of Israel Egypt and Ethiopia south of of Israel so everything is ordered in the scripture based upon Israel Israel's God's timepiece how many kids how many how many how many kids Amen to that praise God sorry now I have a whole bunch also about the Antichrist in my my latest book but I I didn't have time to go through that so I just I just want to present what I have so far maybe there'll be a part two on this we'll see uh by the grace of God so if you have your Bibles we read uh Ezekiel 38 I want to start from there by the grace of God again and I'm going to go through what the preachers are saying today so just know that I will I'll get to that by the grace of God as you can probably guess I disagree with a lot of prominent preachers because they say a lot of things I don't agree with praise God but you know God's given them a place God's given them many testimonies and I appreciate them but if they get off the word of God then you know we've got a right to tell them about it praise God and we must stand with the truth at all times praise God and we must do it in love Hallelujah brother Ram did that you know he did that with Billy Graham and Oral Roberts A.A Allen brother Brown was able to disagree with love and the Bible said let your words always be seasoned with Grace so I'm going to say I appreciate all these brothers and their gifts and their their large Ministries I'm not going to draw them out of my circle I'm going to draw them into my circle praise God but I'm also going to show I'll be there wrong about this this and that praise God so uh let's look into the word of God here we read verses one to three now what you know what's always I'm just going to use this as a little uh statement you know what's always confused me about Russia as Gog and Magog was Revelation 20 verse 8. uh it's always confused me now Revelation 20 verse 8 cannot be Russia because Russia's already been destroyed as far as the the human government of Russia was already destroyed at the battle of Armageddon because the Bible said Jesus's sword comes out of his mouth that Armageddon and it destroys all the nations right all the armies gathered Armageddon up against Jesus and he destroys all the nations there now Gog and magogo in Revelation 20 is at the end of the millennium so Gog and Magog what's interesting is that Gog and Magog stands for all the people that Satan deceives at the end of the Millennium and he gathers All Nations the Bible said from the four corners of the earth and gathers all them together against Jesus and his people but then uh while Jesus is surrounded Satan thinks he's got him surrounded but they're not God actually surrounds everybody praise God God is so great he he's the one that surrounds all creation Hallelujah and he sends fire from heaven and destroys this Army led by Satan okay so that's the one thing that confused me uh but you know by God's grace I could see why you know the Bible uses Gog and Magog for that uh because there's one great leader right there's one great leader Satan right and then Magog of course is the Northern parts of Israel so it speaks of all these nations uh that are around and surrounding Israel so just so you know I I do believe Revelation 20 verse 8 is not Russia I believe it's just all the nation Satan gathers to fight against the Christ Our Christ praise God and us now if you have your Bibles verse two and three Gog is the title for the leader of Russia it's kind of like the Antichrist we don't know the Antichrist literal name he's just called Antichrist or he's called false prophet and then when he gets all of Satan in him then he's called The Beast uh and we don't know his name we don't know if he's alive today or not many people think so but we don't know for sure if the Antichrist is alive today or not we don't know we don't know if it's the current pope praise God or the next Pope or the Pope after that we don't know we believe it's the pope but we don't know the name and we don't know literally who it is now the land of the North of Israel is called called Magog and it's actually the descendants of japheth uh the son of uh Noah ham Shem and japheth so japheth moved North uh that Israel area there after the flood and then his people are called the Magog people now let's look at verse four here Republic Ezekiel 38 verse 4. and I will turn thee back he's speaking to this great nation of the North and put hooks into thy Jaws so Russia here is likened into an animal right and I will bring thee forth and all thine Army horses and Horsemen and all them uh clothed with all sorts of armor even a great company with bucklers and shields all of them handling swords currently Russia is the second largest military in the world after ours at least as far as what they report now we know China didn't report all the coveted stuff so I don't know if they report all their military stuff we know that for sure uh China likes to hide things and just make themselves look look all-powerful all the time uh but here's a great Army and God Likens Russia unto an animal that he can just put hooks into the animals nostrils and then move him around and control him and that's just like God God controls the United States God controls China God controls Russia God controls uh Africa God controls every nation God is in control nothing can happen to you except God knows all about it praise God nothing can happen to America or any country unless God allowed it you know you know ever since the 2020 election I've always wondered God why didn't you hear my prayer I prayed so much and I just had to come to the conclusion God's not asking me for my opinion God does what he wants to do praise God and ah yes I must make my requests and unto God but God's not looking at me for advice I need to look for him for advice praise God no matter how much I pray about something no matter how much I seek God no matter how much you know I want something it's not what I want God is in control of every situation Glory now verse 5 and 6 now put Persia which is modern-day Iran Ethiopia Libya and Gomer and I forgot to look up which one Gomer was there's a they have modern day equivalents like Persia's Iran today but verse 5 says that now verse 8 and 9. now notice what verse 8 and 9 says Ezekiel wrote this over uh 2500 years ago but verses 8 and 9 say after many days Thou shalt be visited in the latter days Thou shalt come into the land that is I'm sorry into the land that is brought back from The Sword and is gathered out of many people against the mountains of Israel which have been always waste but it has brought forth out of the Nations and they shall dwell safely all of them so God is going to put this judgment off until Israel's dwelling safely now churches Israel dwelling safely today huh they caught they have airplanes flying 24 7. think of the think of the fuel the jet fuel they spend to protect themselves against their Muslim neighbors they they always have a play in the sky always and they have the Iron Dome right we've seen it last year it catches all those all those missiles it intersects all those missiles that they shoot over their neighbors they're Muslim Neighbors but here 2500 years ago God has Ezekiel speak to the the Israelites who are out of the land that's who this letter was for he tells them you know I'm going to raise up God but it's not going to be till many days and here we've had many many days many years praise God and he's going to bring them up when Israel is dwelling safely verse 9 Thou shalt Ascend and come like a storm do we just read about a whirlwind in Daniel 11. how the king of the Lord would be like a whirlwind storm you see the parallels so both prophets Ezekiel and Daniel prophesied to the same thing it was Russia the King of the North also known as Magog all right he comes like a storm Thou shalt be a cloud to cover the land thou and all thy bands and many people with thee so when when these nations come led by Russia Ethiopia Persia Libya when they come their army is going to be so great it's like a cloud that covers the land when was the last time you've seen some fog you ever seen that how the fog covers the land that's how the armies of Russia and all these nations Iran that's how they're going to be coming down to take over Israel do you think God's shaking in his shoes no God's not shaking his shoes God's the one that gave them life praise God but God said although the Army's so great he said the real reality is I'm drawing you down now church God is drawing them down to punish them eventually for all their wickedness think about that all the all the prayers to Allah that the Iran gives all the drunken Russians you know all the all the prostitutes in Russia all the wickedness that they do God is drawing them down in order to punish them they think they're going to come down and Destroy Israel but God is actually saying you think you're high and exalted pride is going before the fall praise God hallelujah God shall not be mocked praise God whatever a man or woman sows whatever they plant in their life they're going to reap from that hallelujah praise God now verse 10-13 this uh these scriptures say the attack comes at a time of Peace for Israel now I believe I'm just making sure I say that plainly I believe this can only happen after the Antichrist makes the seven year Covenant with Israel which is Daniel 9 27. the Bible said the prince will make a a league for a week he'll make a covenant with a weak but in the midst of the week the Antichrist will break the Covenant with Israel so I believe this attack comes uh during that seven year uh tribulation period of course after uh well so it would still be the time of peace now verses 8 to 19 stated plainly that this is God's Wrath being poured out so this makes me think it's the wrath of God or the Great Tribulation period so let's read 18-19 it shall come to pass at the same time when God shall come against the land of Israel saith the Lord God that my Fury shall come up in my face so God's going to get very angry with Russia God's going to get very angry uh with with Iran for in my jealousy and in my fire of my wrath this is not a time for Grace this is a time of judgment have I spoken surely in that day there shall be a great shaking in the land of Israel now verse 20 notice says all men on the face of the Earth will shake at God's presence this seems to refer to the battle of Armageddon because the Bible said every eye will see Jesus when he returns think about that he might be on one side of the Earth but every eye will see him I wonder if that's uh the satellites in the news I wonder if that's modern technology in that scripture or not I don't know we'll find out you do that or everybody is gathered or Jesus shows himself around the world to everyone and then he comes down for battle at Armageddon not sure how that fits but that's verse 20. I want to read that verse 20 says so the fishes of the sea the files of the Heaven and the beasts of the field and all creeping things that creep upon the Earth and all the men that are upon the face of the Earth shall shake at my presence think of that they're going to think it's an earthquake but it's not it's the presence of Jesus Amen oh what's in the prince of Jesus do here today praise God Amen it says Shake us hallelujah it should shake us to live holy to be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ to be filled with the Holy Spirit it should take us to draw close to him praise God oh it's beautiful and the mountains shall be thrown down he's just going to throw down mountains which no one here can do praise God right and the Steep places shall fall and every wall shall fall to the ground every wall think of the Great Wall of China think of all these walls people build up around cities every wall is going to fall when this presence comes to the Earth praise God Hallelujah because it's God drawing this animal down in order to put his Fury and his wrath upon the sinners that come against Israel now notice the verses 21-23 God is going to confuse them and they're actually going to start fighting themselves do you know currently you know with Russia Ukraine it's very hard for them to discern which soldiers which Soldier because ukrainians are very similar to Russians you know they used to be part of the Soviet Union and so if there's certain marks and certain letters and certain bands so that they don't get confused and actually hurt one another but God is going to confuse them here I believe at the or near the battle of Armageddon and they're going to fight against themselves and he's also going to send fire and brimstone perhaps this is referring to the sixth trumpet I don't know but we see fire and brimstone now what other uh judgments speak of fire and brimstone anybody remember Sodom and Gomorrah starting Gomorrah God was displeased with some God was fed up with Gomorrah they were male homosexuals in Sodom and Gomorrah and God burned them with fire that's what God thinks of homosexuality God burned them with fire and there's still records of it today you I've seen YouTube videos they they take the they take the brimstone and they can test it and it still Burns today all these years later you can see the walls and I got a video on that there's over a million views on that one video uh you see they they can they can see where the altar was in Sodom and Gomorrah they can see where all these businesses were they the walkways it was there but God got fed up with it when they wouldn't repent when they God even set Angels down there they wouldn't repent God sent fire and brimstone now look God's gonna do the same thing to Russia same thing to Iran same type of judgment fire and brimstone thank God that you've received Jesus Christ and you don't get God's Wrath you get God's mercy praise God Hallelujah this is what God does the heathe the Nations this is what God does to Sinners who think they can live any way they want they cannot whatever they sow that's what they'll reap but the Bible said let's sow into righteousness and Reaper the Holy Spirit praise God in other words live a life that Jesus Christ will be pleased with praise God plant holy seeds do holy actions do give to the poor hallelujah pray give Holmes fast do holy things and you will reap righteousness praise God amen now that finishes chapter 38 I'm just hitting the highlights because I could devote a whole service to this just one chapter now in chapter 39 verses 1 and 2 God calls this Russia to come against Israel and one-sixth of them fall and they become food for the birds does this remind you of something the battle of Armageddon they all come against Jesus right but he comes out of heaven with on a white horse with his white armies we believe that's us by God's grace and all the saints under the ages praise God we don't do any fighting we just follow the king we just follow the fighter praise God God is going to have us fight God's just going to have us watch the victory praise God Amen Hallelujah Jesus does all the fighting and he fights the same way he always has it is written with the word of God that proceeds out of his mouth amen oh Hallelujah notice verse 9 this is a striking statement here it takes seven years for Israel to burn up all the weapons of this Army seven years now that makes me think of the tribulation a seven year period but it can't be the whole time uh because the Bible said they have peace for three and a half years so it can't be so it's interesting it almost seems like after the battle of Armageddon there's I don't know if those seven years are part of the 1 000 Millennial years or not and it takes seven months to bury all the slain soldiers some of them which they killed each other but some of them which God had destroyed with fire and brimstone what a what a event here that's going to happen verse 25 God says he'll have mercy on the whole house of Israel verse 27 says it happens after God gathers Israel out of their enemies lands which he's still doing today praise God I share that video with brother William a few months ago and I showed how those Ethiopians they were raising money where they could fly back to Israel as soon as they got to Israel as soon as they got off the plane they kissed the concrete that's got that that's a real dirty kiss right there right on concrete but they're not kissing the concrete they're they're basically showing that they love the land of Abraham they're glad to be home that's God's land amen God's holy mountain is going to rest there someday someday that would be the Eternal location of Jesus Christ Hallelujah amen I believe I'd probably kiss that land too by God's grace Hallelujah verse 29 says God pours out his Spirit after all this battle and he drags this animal down there and judges the animal and and pours his wrath and fire and brims around the animal uh the Bible says then he pours out his Spirit on Israel is that beautiful that what that has to be the 144 000 that just struck me right now it actually amen Zechariah 12 10. and I'll pour Up on the House of David and then the inhabitants of Jerusalem the spirit of Grace and supplications and they shall look upon me Jesus whom they appears and they shall mourn for him as one mourneth for his only son and shall be in bitterness for him as one that is in baroness for his firstborn son so they're bitter they haven't yet been born again so see this has to be sometime after the two witnesses God brings uh those Nations down destroys them and yet they still haven't received Jesus Christ yet but once God destroys Russia once God destroys Iran then God is going to pour out can you imagine that he's pouring out the spirit of Grace and supplication God pour it on me more praise God how did he has been poured on me these last 20 some years God poured out more I want more of you let your rain fall upon me praise God Hallelujah now let's look at Daniel 11 you've got your Bible go to Daniel 11. it's right after Ezekiel so yeah really close now Daniel 11 was written after ezekiel's let me just check the date on that real quick by God's grace yeah about 50 years or 40 40 some years afterwards Daniel wrote this Daniel chapter 11. now it mentions the King of the North I believe six times if we're not mistaken one two three four five six or seven six or seven seven times now what's wonderful is that the Lord already had me read through the Book of Daniel I preached the whole book back in uh 2017. uh now chapter 11 and Daniel took place around 536 BC Daniel was probably 84 years old verses 2 to 35 uh were fulfilled around 5 30 BC not long after he wrote this and then they continue to be fulfilled for about 400 more years now verses 36-45 seem to be about the future Antichrist Pope so let's look at that now let's read verse 40. that was our text here Daniel 11 verse 40. well you know before we get there let's go up to 36. we'll just read this little portion here just a small portion of scripture and the King should do according to his will and he shall exalt himself and magnify himself above every God and shall speak marvelous things against the god of gods and shall prosper till the ending Nation be accomplished for that which is determined shall be done so this fits with second Thessalonians chapter 2 where the Son of Perdition exalts himself above all that's called God that's why we believe this is speaking a type of the Antichrist okay because the Antichrist will exalt himself above all gods he'll sit in the temple of God claiming that he is God and remember he'll have power to do lying signs and wonders praise God remember Church Satan cannot cast out Satan Satan cannot heal so he's got lying wonders he's doing lying wonders kind of like the blood coming out of those statues of Mary that's a lying Wonder that's not a real Miracle that's not you anything you see in the Bible where it's a real genuine Holy Ghost experience it's a lying Wonder or they got these people that you know they actually have Roman Catholics have people that actually uh on the time of Easter they actually start bleeding like like they're taking Jesus place and they're experiencing it and it actually happens I forget what the name of those things are called you remember I can't remember there's a certain name to it they actually have experiences like that but Church there it doesn't look like it's the Holy Spirit you don't see that in the Bible I think I'll think of it Brian when the sermon's over the name of it apparitions there it is apparitions where they see Mary there it is I got it before the sermon ended it's an apparition they or they see Mary or they talk to Mary and Mary says pray this many Hail Marys and your your loved ones will get well that's a lying Wonder God does God doesn't send Mary to be the intercessor me Mary's not the mediator Jesus is the mediator praise God well Mary says oh listen to the pope and that's that's a lie that's a lying Wonder but the Antichrist will deceive with lying signs lying wonders that's right remember Satan can transform himself into an angel of Light he's not an angel of Light but he can transform himself like he is an angel of Light he can look holy he can look nice and good and powerful and and wonderful and it looks like a savior it looks like a Superman Satan can transform himself like that but remember God gave us this great wisdom back in the Old Testament he said if anybody can produce he said a sign he said that's fine he said but look and wait till you hear the message look what they tell you to do after they do a sign or wonder Hallelujah in other words listen for the voice behind the sign glory and that's what we've seen today God gave brother random a gift of Divine Healing that was wonderful that was a sign but we stayed around you and I stayed around and we heard the voice of the sign amen the voice was Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever thank God we've heard the voice it's changed our life it's the voice of eternal life amen amen hallelujah so no matter what Miracle we see they would see the Antichrist do I don't believe we'll see it but whatever Miracle they see the Antichrist do listen for the voice of the sign afterwards where he'll be exalting himself above the god of gods above Jesus Christ and who is Christ the word so he'll be exalting his his opinion and his his word above the Bible and no man ought to do that now here's a good lesson I heard this is a Google map I think of I'm not mistaken Magog now there's it's hard to see but that's Israel Church look where Moscow is Moscow the capital of Russia where is it north south east or west what is it North North God said the King of the North and he said this 2500 years ago praise God and Russia was you know Derma my childhood the Soviet Union was broken up right and now looks like Putin's trying to build it back together that's what it looks like I don't know if they'll accomplish we don't know but God said two thousand five hundred years ago the King of the North is going to come down right so you have turkey you have Iran in there all these nations there uh in the tribulation are going to come against Israel in other words we can trust God's word God's word can never fail God knows what he's talking about and we need the Holy Spirit to help us understand we need to pray for more Revelation praise God Hallelujah that's what I'm doing praise God now verse 40 this is what we read earlier it seems the King of the South and Russia come against the pope Antichrist so let's read that again well actually we never even finished verse 37 sorry so let me read 37. neither shall he regard the god of his fathers nor the desire of women so this Antichrist is not going to be into the god of his fathers whether it's Jewish or Christian nor desire women he won't be a man that's tempted by women nor regard any God for he shall magnify himself above all he won't worship women he won't worship any other God he will only be interested in magnifying himself unlike a lot of people we know don't they that all they care about is theirselves but see a real question a real Christian cares about other people Hallelujah verse 38 but in his estate shall he honor the god of forces and a god whom his fathers knew not shall he honor with gold and silver and precious stones and pleasant things so it looks like he's going to build some type of a a shrine or something some type of shrine to himself it looks like verse 39 thus shall he do in the most strongholds with a strange God whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory and he shall cause them to rule over many and shall divide the land for gain so here's where the Antichrist is going to have some type of power over land in order for him to gain verse 40 and at that time of the end shall the King of the South now I think it's Egypt I don't know now Egypt right now is ranked 13th globally in military power but if you look at the map you know if you look back at that map you know the right what's right under what's right under Israel you know it's Egypt in this area Ethiopia there so it looks like it's the uh it's Egypt but I don't know we don't have any thus saith the Lord's the King of the South we don't have any but we do have thus say the Lord on King of the North okay now look at uh let's finish verse 40. and the King of the North shall come against him like a whirlwind we saw that the same type of language the storm in uh Ezekiel 38. with chairs with Horsemen with many ships and he shall enter into the countries and shall overflow and pass over okay now verse 41 says he's going to come into the Glorious land that has to be Israel he shall enter also into the Glorious lamb and many countries shall be overthrown but these shall Escape out of his hand even Edom and Moab and the chief of the children of Amman now go down to verse 45 and he shall plant the Tabernacles of his Palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountains so see the Antichrist is going to set up some type of Tabernacle in the Holy Land right in the glorious holy mountain so that's why some people think that's either Mariah or Mount Zion you know how they're remember I showed you those two mountains last year how they're right next to each other or maybe that just refers to the one mountain but some somewhere he's going to set up some Tabernacle there yet he shall come to his end and None Shall help him look at that look at this he magnifies himself all he does is promote himself pump up himself and he's got no friends he's got nobody to help him out right that's what that's what the devil wants you to do devil wants you to make yourself the most important one church and if you make yourself the most important one you're going to have many friends because all you think about is yourself right that's just what Satan wants he wants to isolate you and and just get just you and him right tempt you and him that's what he wants but the Bible said a man that's friendly shows himself a man that wants Friends shows himself friendly praise God he'll have lots of friends praise God because he's not interested just in himself he's interested in other people praise God all right so you see that we're currently we're ranked number one as far as our size Russia's two China's three Egypt apparently is 13th at least scored in the website I was on now let's now you can have your Bibles down if you want or you can keep them there but uh actually you know go to Daniel 2. that's a good idea we're in Daniel 11 go back to Daniel 2. brother man gives us a thus saith the Lord on this here so this is very important now what's interesting is some people are making it sound like Russia is going to take over the whole world brother Adam specifically tells us thus saith the Lord Russia will not take over the whole world right didn't you hear that I heard that months ago oh Russia could take over Ukraine and where where are they going to stop they're going to keep going here there and they want World Dominion that's what the world the world just wants to put fear on people but brother Brown tells us the Bible says thus saith the Lord Russia will never rule the world Rome will rule the world and they rule it by spiritual influence in other words the pope and his of his teachings controls many nations all right look at our leaders Nancy Pelosi Catholic Anthony fauci Catholic right uh Joe Biden Catholic Catholic by name right yet they're murderers they murder they pay billions of dollars to murder babies so they're they're no they're no real believer they're not a believer in Jesus Christ now in 1954 brother Adam said that's the red dragon the devil wears his seat not in Russia in Rome and said the devil give him his seat and his authority the red dragon not Russia I hear a great Minister saying Russia is the Antichrist why Russia has nothing to do with the Antichrist that's communism if you'll give me one more night if God does I'll prove to you that communism is working straight in the hands of almighty God to destroy the Roman and remember I say this is God's Prophet the Russian Empire will drop an atomic bomb of some sort on the Vatican City and Destroy in one hour thus saith the Lord now that's a statement right there now where does Rhode Island get that he gets it from revelation 18. because remember I believe it was Ten Kings if I'm not mistaken Ten Kings give their power to the Beast for one hour and then they turn on the Beast right and so one of those has to be Russia because the Bible said they love they make love to the woman but then they turn on her and hate her and one of them destroys her in one hour it's got to be Russia that's what that's what brother Ram says if he's a prophet he spoke with us saith the Lord and we believe that and the Bible said that God took them Cruel Heart of men and put them in his hands and there were instruments in his hands to fulfill his will and bring back to her exactly what she had coming to her that's exactly that's the word of God now three years later now remember there's going to be millions of Americans meet their Doom what would hinder tonight for this whole nation to be destroyed within five minutes what did science say the other night this Nationwide broadcast we're five years behind Russia they got a Sputnik and they can put a man dozens of them send them up there in the sky move right over this United States and say surrender or go to Power in a few minutes of course we would surrender to save our life now look at that that was in 1957. see what they were thinking of like Russia is going to fly over our our country and say you better give up no you better give up now see now would that would could that ever happen today no because they have all those systems right unless they took the power out they could somehow they took out their power grid they could do that but it probably wouldn't have happened in today's with today's technology right because we have all these like like Israel has the Iron Dome America has similar Technologies where they could detect missiles being shot but see this is what the fear was at that time right So Not only was there fear in that day there's fear today as well we've always got a battle fear now our brother man said what would happen now notice brother random doesn't say this is going to happen a lot of people confuse this quote but Ram said what would happen Russian soldiers would pour in by the millions running in the streets grabbing the women ravishing young girls sweethearts whatever it was don't make any difference to them sure their Communists cold-hearted what would happen go right into a nice home kick you out of it they'll use it theirself it's Russia's then we're a satellite now he's saying what wood he's he's not saying this is going to happen he said this is what people would worry about but let me tell you the church won't see that she's going to be gone when that comes that's thus saith the Lord so in other words telling the people don't worry about invasions there's nothing in the scripture that says that about invasion of America because America is found in Revelation 13. she said don't worry about that what would happen he said but let me tell you the church is gone before there's any judgments upon this Earth praise God Amen the Reason God saved us is to spare us from the Wrath that is to come God has always spread righteous people from the wrath of God Amen Hallelujah he spared Noah he spared love praise God he spared Enoch he only spares Believers praise God because they love righteousness and God is a god of Mercy praise God he spares his children Hallelujah so don't confuse us and this is why a lot of people think Russia this war is actually going to cause Russia to invade the United States there's message preachers that have said that they actually think Russian soldiers are going to invade the United States remember when that brother remember when that Pastor in Kentucky had that dream a couple years ago and he said right after the 2020 election I saw U.N soldiers taking over America remember that he said they're at the White House and there was no president and remember all those things and it shook people up they shook people up so see that's why people get their own ideas and and brother I'm just saying would happen it wasn't a thus saith the Lord it was just a wood what would happen potential this is just potential praise God but brother but brother Adam gives us the scripture there let me read the scripture keep your place in Daniel 2. the scripture is first Thessalonians 5 9. first Thessalonians 5 9. for God hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ amen amen hallelujah that's the scripture that brother Adam gets the inspiration for this the church will be gone before wrath is poured out you are not children of the darkness that deserve wrath you are children of the light now brother man is talking about Jeremiah Jeremiah come back and call it all together and said I've got thus saith the Lord said hear you people hallelujah they're scared of the king of Babylon like we're scared of Russia this is in 1961. scared of Russia right because of the the Cuban Missile Crisis remember all these things that all the the nuclear uh all the nuclear scares of that time said you're all getting ready to run down into Egypt because you know he's coming and we're fleeing from one city to another trying to get away from atomic bombs and building shelters and everything else what good it's going to do get rid of the same question so brother man is drawing a parallel right he's drawn a parallel just like just like Jeremiah is saying don't worry about Babylon worry about your sin that's what God is saying today don't worry about Russia confess your sin be concerned with getting all the sin out of our Lives Hallelujah and when sins out of your life you got nothing to worry about because you pass from wrath unto blessing praise God you pass pass from wrath unto God's salvation when you confess your sins may God help each and every person to confess all of our sins amen get rid of the sins I love this one this is the this is the Daniel chapter Two one so if you got you got if you've got your Bible go Daniel 2 31 if you've got your Bible Daniel 2 31. the Catholic hierarchy with all the denominations in the world right now coming together as an organization the confederation of churches organizing themselves together it isn't Russia it's Rome thus saith the Lord yeah show me a scripture where communism or anything else besides Rome will rule church I just read you the only two passages on Russia do they ever rule the world no God is using them like an animal to pull down here and fight against the pope and then God pours out his judgment on that animal praise God oh we got nothing to worry about church amen there's no reason to fear God has not given you the spirit of fear but a power love and a sound mind amen Glory show me one verse where Russia rules the world there's no there's none and we don't have that that's thus saith my idea that's thus saith the Lord notice his next question did the medes O Persia succeed in Nebuchadnezzar sure did Greece secede them yeah did Rome take over from there did it break up into 10 ottoman Powers just like we got now yes the answer is yes okay so go to Daniel 2 31. now King Nebuchadnezzar has this dream of an image he can't remember and he's going to kill his wise men right because how can you be wise and not know my dreams but God raises up Daniel praise God and God tells Daniel the dream and the interpretation thereof now go to verse 38. and whosoever the children of men dwell the beasts of the field and the fowls of the heaven hath he given into thine hand and hath made thee ruler over them all thou art this head of gold so Nebuchadnezzar was the head of gold and he ran from 605 to 539 BC all right now next verse 39 and after thee shall rise another Kingdom In Fear To Thee and another third Kingdom of brass which shall bear rule over all the Earth okay verse 40. and the fourth Kingdom shall be strong as iron for as much as iron breakthrough them pieces and subdueth all things and as iron that breakth all these shall it break in pieces and Bruise and whereas thou saws the feet and Toes part of Potter's claim part of iron the kingdom shall be divided but there shall be in it of the strength of the iron for as much as thou saw us the iron mix with Miri clay and the toes of the feet were part of iron and part of clay so the kingdom shall be partly strong and partly broken and whereas thou saws iron mixed with Miri clay they shall mingle themselves with the seed of men but they shall not cleave one to another even as iron is not mixed with clay so any historian will tell you this after Babylon came the Persians which is modern-day Iran after the Persian Empire came the Grecian Empire Alexander the Great after Alexander the Great came the Roman Empire but then the Roman Empire was like the legs that broke into two parts East and West right now we are down here at the toes we have iron and clay at the feet iron represents Roman Catholicism clay represents the Protestant churches who are teaching things against the word of God and they mingle together but they don't mix right like I've got family where one was Protestant one was Catholic one or to get married they both got to be Catholic and that's exactly what the Bible said the Bible said they mingle their seeds together see Catholics marrying Protestants Protestants American Catholics they're meaningless elves together but they never really mix you still got Protestants you still got Catholics and church this is thus saith the Lord this image stands until Jesus Christ returns at Armageddon praise God in other words Rome Rules by the Catholic church and the Protestant churches Rome rules through them until Jesus Christ comes back at the battle of Armageddon and the church said if you don't believe that look at verse 44. and the days of these Kings shall the god of Heaven set up a kingdom which shall never be destroyed see all these kingdoms get destroyed but not Jesus Kingdom and when the kingdom shall not be left to other people I'm sorry but it shall break in pieces and consume all these kingdoms and it shall stand forever for as much as thou saws that stone that was cut out of the mountain without hands that it break in pieces the iron the brass the clay the silver the gold the great God hath made known to the king what shall come to pass Hereafter and the dream is certain and the interpretation is sure oh Church we're not guessing on this it is absolutely certain it is sure Rome is going to rule not Russia praise God and the coming of Jesus Christ breaks down the day of man this is the day of Gentiles but when Jesus Christ comes back praise God at the battle of Armageddon he breaks down these kingdoms all these Kings of Men are broken down and there and then he sets up this great Kingdom which you and I are part of Amen we went through it a couple Wednesdays ago you and I are in the government or the kingdom of almighty God hallelujah amen because we won't join with the Catholics we won't join with the Protestants we won't we won't join with the homosexuals we won't join with all these Wicked people but we'll join to Jesus Christ for he is Holy he is truth he is the great God Amen thank God Hallelujah so we have to fear about Russia ruin the world Russia is not going to rule the world Rome is going to rule the world and we got that thus saith the Lord see they're already ruling the world right the Roman the Roman influenced the bankers right the Catholic Church influences the bankers Austin studied on that it's got to make sense we have all these Catholic leaders that control these billions of dollars that they just print money out of nowhere that's why Foods twice they're three times expensive as it was last year just print make all this money Catholic people it's Catholics Catholics are in control of this now I better stop right there because I was going to say something very stuff right I was going to just blast something so I'm not going to blast it right now I'll say that for later there's a little bit nicer picture of it you know that one that one's not very high quality you know as far as the the pixels you know I guess but Babylon Persian Grecian Roman at the bottom though it goes to Clay and iron a mixture that's the holy that's the Catholic church and the Protestants are mixing down at the bottom all right the church said all right they got a good picture if you need any of these pictures let me know you can find them online too they're pretty easy to find church this is why nobody can shake us this is why there's nobody could come around and say well you're wrong on this we're right because we've got thus saith the Lord every Prophet there ever was had thus save the Lord amen that's how we know we're right praise God not just have it but it actually makes sense in the Bible and God has backed it up over and over and over again praise God foreign Hallelujah now let's get to some other quotes about Russia just so you can have a better understanding of why why our message preachers why are some of them pushing Russia so hard well here's why brother man was talking about this Vision he had in 1933 before World War II of course when we when we went to war with Germany he said watch Russia the voice said watch Russia communism Nazism fascism watch Russia but that is not the main one to watch well why are them preachers making it sound like we're supposed to watch Russia so much that's not the main one to watch it shall also has been an evil thing done in the country they permitted women to vote that is a woman's Nation see and she'll pollute this nation as Eve did Eden and now you see why I'm hammering the way I do I got thus saith the Lord now just let me say for our visitors a Christian woman makes a good vote so I want you to understand this quote most women though are not Christians let me see like this most men are not Christians so most men do bad votes too right in most cases so I want you to understand the balance of this quote whatever I must say you know evil women and not once women got the opportunity to vote most of them were Sinners right so they voted for the wrong person they voted for the wrong leaders that's why we got some of these these agencies today right Malachi go through some history right Woodrow Wilson and some of these other guys JFK and different ones look listen thou saith the Lord repent I predict three curtains in the name of the Lord there's one called the Iron Curtain which will be Russia watch Red China that'll be the bamboo curtain they're horrible but watch the purple curtain that's rising in the United States and over the world the Roman Empire the cruelest of them all look at that America is so cruel do you know after uh Biden got in office and and Harris and Pete bootage did you know after that all their embassies started flying the homosexual flags and they never flew before in all these in all these nations it's total perversion it's the cruelest of them all and then they send billions of dollars of AIDS they can kill their babies which babies are the greatest blessing outside of salvation right babies are God's Heritage babies are God's possession that he lets you borrow for a few years parents and the parents said amen those are souls that eventually God is going to grow let them grow up and then God's Gonna lead them you just get them for about 18 years maybe sometimes a little longer hope I get mine a little longer don't tell Lydia I said that but look how cruel look how cruel they are they're promoting uh and Matt Walsh did that documentary and he went to other nations and said would you want to live would you want to move to America where they're telling a woman can be a man a man could be a woman these guys are like no I don't want to go over there where where children can have surgeries and cut off their private parts and and and then taught this in school is that is that a great place you want to be and these guys are like no I would never want to go that there's a shot how can this happen it's the cruelest system of them all this Roman Catholic system thank God that Martin Luther balled them out praise God thank God Amen Hallelujah that was a star in the hand of Jesus amen hallelujah the pope is not the universal Authority praise God we protest the authority of the Roman Catholic church we stand for the authority of the revealed word of God hallelujah the Holy Bible the King James version thank you Jesus and just so our visit our sisters know get you get you a good King James Version Bible all the other ones got mistakes and you know there's just a few mistakes it's still mistakes get a King James one we know there's no mistakes in there so God bless you too the cruelest of all of these is the Roman Catholic Church who's the one who did all those papal Wars what which church did the Dark Ages which church did the Inquisition were they killed over a hundred million people that was the Roman Catholic Church the cruelest of them all you see how they donated a uh 80 million dollars of black lives matter and not one of those dollars went to help a community it just made the founders rich right and that really is a homosexual organization because they want to destroy the nuclear family that God set up and all the Catholics said let's vote for them Nancy Pelosi said let's vote for them or let's give to them Joe Biden said let's give to that organization look what happened they don't care about anybody except themselves but God cares about everybody God gives Mercy to everybody God's extending the hand of love God is love praise God that we need more than love of God hallelujah amen but I'm trying to show you this Roman Catholic system is the cruelest of all of them because it's thus saith the Lord it's iron and clay and those Catholics won't Bend for anybody either become a Catholic you're not getting married to these Catholics right that's what you either become a Catholic or you're not a part of our family they will not Bend for anybody he says remember in the name of the Lord get away from it come away from anything that's attached to the Roman Catholic Church flee to the Rock the coming of the Lord is at hand we need a conference I need a conference to talk these things over with God the church is at the end of a road let us pray amen now I'm going to I'm going to keep preaching I'm not going to stop and pray if you got your Bible go to Revelation 16 2 I'll show you where China's in the Bible this was fresh to me I hadn't thought about this before brother says in the name of the Lord now yeah I read this earlier red China China is the bamboo current China's in Revelation 16 2. remember this is during the vials which are poured out in the last half of Daniel's 70th week the last three and a half years Revelation 16 verse 2. this is the first vial did I write that down right I'm sorry it's 1612 I'm sorry let me fix that real quick I'm sorry I got in a hurry I missed the one on there there we go sorry it's a sixth vial sixth vowel and the sixth Angel poured out his vow upon the great river Euphrates and the water there was dried up and the way of the kings that the way of the kings of the East might be prepared see God has to dry up the river Euphrates so China can bring all their soldiers over down to the battle of Armageddon right the kings of the East who's east of Israel China Japan right India East the kings of the East need a way they're soldiers need a way to get to Israel God has to dry up the river so they can walk through isn't that interesting God dried up a river to save Israel God drives up a river to protect Israel right and bring Israel's enemies to their knees interesting bye what a thought so see it was said in the name of the Lord and we can see it it's right in the Bible okay I've already seen the Bible all right praise God are getting tired are you deep thinking which one is it do you think okay good because if you're tired I'll try to slow this machine down here I try to so I'll try to shorten this up here I'm starting to feel good right now by God's grace the woman he says the Beast was Scarlet this Roman Catholic church but the woman was red and purple now have I not warned you the other day that there's three curtains I don't know how many how long I live but remember this as I've told you many years ago watch Russia there's three curtains remember this this is the Iron Curtain there's the bamboo curtain red China so forth and there's the purple curtain you watch that curtain that's the deceiver that's the deceiver so see that's that's where Deception comes in uh the Catholics like we said Joe Biden and and uh AOC they're all Catholic Anthony fauci they're the deceivers they they act like they're the good people they act like they're standing up for what's right but they're actually deceiving people now here's the purpose of this here by God's grace I've been you know I've been thinking I've been hearing preachers for I love hearing preachers preach I listen to preaching all the time that's usually what I listen to you know when I listen to things on my drive but prominent preachers are assuming the Russian Ukraine war is signaling the signaling the imminent return of Christ in the Rapture so they're saying like this is like the last war that's basically what they're saying this is the last war and the Rapture they're saying is any day any hour now can the live stream see any of those words up there honey they can okay let's see well then I'm going to turn this off then all right so sorry about that if you want to copy this church I'll email it to you I do that I did that last Sunday brother come up brother Bondo from Albion and he wanted all my notes I sent him a PDF all the notes so are they right are these preachers right saying uh this is the last war before the Rapture well I don't think so I don't know for sure only God knows but I don't think this is the last war Putin's already done four Wars he might do more we don't know nobody knows and I'm gonna share the reasons why I believe this here I believe this is just a birth pain but not the last birth pain and it seems to me these preachers are presuming okay so what I'm trying to do now is I'm trying to place Us in Prophecy this is the million dollar question how close are we to the Rapture right of course we don't we never try to exactly figure it out and guess the actual day in the hour no man can do that unless they're lying right they're lying Jesus said no man knows the day of the hour it'll always come at a time when they think not but if you have your uh Bible let's go to Matthew 24 I believe it's eight and nine but let's see I could be wrong on that seven and eight yeah Matthew 24 7 8. I currently believe that this this war is just another one of the birth pains that God is allowing until Armageddon comes of course what's Armageddon comes the Earth gets a brand new start that's the birth of a new day it's the Lord's Day Hallelujah now I mainly believe that church because the Rapture happens right around the moment where they're about the government is about to lay down the mark of the beast and kill anybody who descends I just don't see like I don't feel like our government is that close now they're getting closer like now they've arrested Steve Bannon they arrested uh uh who else some different conservative they actually well I said not arrest but they are threatened to arrest them they're breaking in their houses through the FBI that FBI is breaking in conservatives houses right like project Veritas Donald Trump's estate there now he's not a Godly Man in any way I'm not saying but he's more right than they are but he's not godly I don't even think he's saved so I'm not saying go Trump I'm not saying that I'm saying go Jesus that's what I'm saying I think you should vote Yes I think you should vote but what I see is that this is the closest it's ever been in my lifetime where true conservatives are or they're now getting uh invaded right breaking in their homes basically taking all their property and everything like that that's the closest we've got but are they close enough to almost killing anyone who descent with them I don't see that quite yet that's just my understanding now in Matthew 24 7-8 Jesus said Nation shall rise against Nation Kingdom against Kingdom and there should be famines and pestilences and earthquakes and diverse places all these are the being of Sorrows so Jesus said the next 2 000 years are going to have all these things did you know a child dies from starvation every 10 seconds how many kids have died since we come into service today around the world because Jesus said there'd be famines in the Earth every 10 seconds think about that every 10 seconds Jesus said there'd be famines that's the word of God right and we're spending all this money trying to blow people up why don't we send that money to give people some food because it's the cruel system of the Roman Catholic Church that's why they say they care for the poor but they don't see everybody see that by God's grace they'll put all this money send it over there to Ukraine why don't they print some money and send food to these starving countries because they don't care they want us they want to pay them so they can buy uh their weapons so because they they know people who own the companies and their companies get rich praise God that's why they want it they want to get rich off the war because they're Wicked people so Jesus says famines what are pestilences think of all the think of covid-19 the pestilence right we had all the swine flu that was maybe before your time that was kind of when I was a teenager Millions died in the swine flu all these pestilences now they they just put one out last week remember Boston University put out a new covet last week where it said it'll kill 80 percent of the people that get it see they're trying to put fear on us right pestilence Jesus said there would be pestilences come this all has to take place and Wars earthquakes earthquakes are up by the thousands there's just more and more earthquakes all the time God is shaking the Earth amen he's giving the last shakes praise God get ready I'm returning praise God he's shaking it more and more thank God that he's shaking our lives praise God thank God he's shaking us to wake us up so we're ready for his coming praise God Amen now go to first Thessalonians 5. so that's the verse I just believe this war is just another one of the wars I don't think it's the last war but I could be wrong I'm not God I'm just saying I'm trying my best to look at the scripture first Thessalonians 5. let me get to this eventually but one reason I don't believe it because these guys who are predicting these preachers who are saying this is the last war they're the ones calling themselves the greatest of all time I got a hard time believing that God's going to let them know the last war before the Rapture when they're so full of Pride and exalting themselves as the greatest of all time I would think God would bypass them and let them live on and die and then move on to the next Generation that's what I would think God would do because God's done done that all through these 2000 years all these guys Charles tase Russell Uriah Smith the founders of the seven-day Adventists the founders of the Jehovah's Witnesses all these guys made predictions about the Rapture and mist and God let them die because they were pridefully exalting themselves like they were prophets and they knew the year of the coming of the Lord or something like that God let them die so Jesus teachers that's what I believe I could be wrong I could be wrong but but here's my here's my here's my love and joy if it comes if the Rapture comes tomorrow I'm ready because I got the Holy Ghost praise God right I repented I got baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I've been serving Jesus Christ with all my heart soul mind and strength these last 22 years and if it comes tomorrow I'm ready to go praise God but if it don't come tomorrow and it comes 100 years later I'll be the I'll be the first to rise because the dead in Christ will rise first see see how see how church we can overcome living in fear we can overcome living in fear and we can have confidence that we know Jesus Christ and we can know him in the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his sufferings first Thessalonians 5 1-2 now this is right after the Rapture scriptures in the previous chapter verse one but of the times and the seasons Brethren you have no need that I write unto you for yourselves know perfectly that the day of the Lord shall cometh as a thief in the night for when they shall say peace and safety then sudden destruction cometh upon them as travail with a woman with child and they shall not Escape now personally I believe this sudden destruction is the second half of the tribulation period okay that's what I believe because they'll have they'll have peace and safety for the first three and a half years right because they have a Israel has a peace Covenant for seven years now of course the the two prophets will be doing certain torments during that time but it's not like sudden destruction right like we read about with the seven trumpets and the Seven vows so they're the so we're we know we don't have need of anybody to tell us the time and season because we know Jesus coming like a thief in the night Hallelujah verse four but ye Brethren are not in darkness that ye should be overtake but that day should overtake you as a thief we're not going to be surprised when the Rapture comes we're going to recognize the Rapture is coming very soon praise God you're all children of the light and Children of the day we are not the of the night nor the darkness therefore let us sleep as let us not sleep as others do but let us watch and be sober for they that sleep sleep in the night and they that be drunk and be drunk in the night but let us who are of the day be sober putting on the breastplate of Love of faith and love and for an helmet the hope of salvation for God hath not appointed us to wrath but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ ah thank God Amen see Church the Bible said sudden destruction it's unexpected what this moment people are expecting a Russian nuclear bomb to strike they're expecting that that wouldn't be unexpected destruction it'd be expected remember I remember Biden was talking about a few weeks ago he said we're closer to Armageddon than we ever have been before that guy and see that would be expected but the Bible says it's unexpected the world is going to think peace the world is going to think safety and then sudden destruction comes on them now see they're expecting destruction because all the talk about Vladimir Putin but what I found was both groups that call themselves the greatest of all time both of them are saying that this is like the last war and uh the the Rapture is any moment now and I'm going to read some of their exact quotes I got their names here but I'm not I can't I'm not going to put them up there I thought I could do I just I didn't think our camera was good enough to catch all the details on the screen it is I'll have to go back and watch that that's the case I might be in some trouble pretty soon here things I've shown in the past the first preacher said back in March so this was over 220 days ago when the war first started one preacher said in a few days this ball brother will have a head full of hair because he said you stay around and the Rapture happens you look over and say I remember the service when this preacher said you're going to have a head full of hair in other words they'll get a new body and this bald guy will have his hair back that was over 220 years ago a message preacher said the rapture's so close this guy's going to have his hair he's got is this bald guy is going to have all his hair back in a few days well here we are Church what does a few days mean two weeks later the same preacher says this we're just hours before the Rapture and we're believing we're getting ready to step over he said hours it has been over five thousand forty hours since he said that he said we're just a few hours because of the Russian war see and I've been hearing those these last eight months I'm just waiting on I'm praying I'm fasting brother like I'm just saying God give me a Revival I want to be ready these prominent men that have great Mega charges saying any day now any hour now here we are and I'm not predicting the Rapture but they are they're the ones predicting the rapture in a few days in a few hours here's another brother he said by tomorrow morning we could wake up in a totally different world than we're living tonight the world will move into a global One World Government in such a fast pace it will take them a snap of the finger so this brother is he's basically saying the same thing I found other quotes from this different brother he's basically saying the same thing this Russian war the nukes could drop and we could wake up in the morning and and there'd be craters all over the all over the America and the government would change would be one world government that fast now what's interesting is that I'm going to show another brother's quote and these brothers are both saying the same thing like this Rapture is any moment and yet they're both building brand new big churches if you really thought the Rapture was next week would you be putting millions of dollars into a building if you really thought the Rapture was in a few days see church this proves that by their fruits they are known Amen Hallelujah by their fruits they're known praise God if I thought the Rapture was tomorrow I wouldn't be go building something out there that's going to be burned up the next day in the Rapture or like with the with a nuclear bomb or something I'd be calling on my friends like brother did you know that sister get ready by God's grace call your family see their Works their Works show that they don't even believe what they're saying millions of dollars they're putting that on the people but by tomorrow could be different by tomorrow just a few hours just a few days left brother Brown said that brother Brown said he said you Assemblies of God you're putting six million dollar buildings and say Jesus coming right away your Works prove that you don't believe that brother Adam said that 40 60 62 years ago anybody that says I believe in Jesus coming soon and building six million dollar buildings you don't believe that if you believed it you'd be taking that money and send preachers out get saved and in this quote he says you would give those poor people food you'd put shoes on the preacher's feet that don't have shoes and the church said see by their fruits they're known let me say this by your fruit you're you're known too praise God because you have love like that song Love goodness kindness self-control thank God Amen you are known by your fruits as well praise God what are you putting your money into and the church said I'm going to preach on Monday again by God's grace what are we putting our money into I'm trying to get out of debt that's what I'm trying to do because I think we might have more time I think I feel like I'm gonna have my whole life here unless God shows me different because everybody else has had their whole life and died and gone on too so I don't know someone live my life like that because I don't know anybody says they know they're probably lying this other the third preacher said when death is hanging so close it could be in one hour this preacher said it last Sunday he said this look what Russia is claiming we're closer to nuclear destruction than we've ever been now that church that's it's true in one sense right we're closer to the end than we've ever been that's true but they're putting this pressure on there like the raptures any day now any hour now and this guy just built a brand new church a few years ago isn't that interesting three out of these four built brand new churches in the last few years because they're so popular which is it's fine it's fine I'm not jealous of that I'd say praise God God bless you stay with the word that's what I'd say I'm happy for you praise God but let's not try to predict the rapture let's not let's not say it's only hours away well here we are 2 000 hours later or five thousand hours later and nothing's happened they've said a lot more than that church but I I that's that's what I was able to find quickly now I'm going to always call this name because I email this guy all the time Joe Sabrina Joseph Branham back in March said the scriptures are being fulfilled faster than we can read all that's happening and uh he said the thought that the Cold War was over there's no more threat of nuclear war but today the threat of nuclear war has become a reality here yeah we cannot plug it back in because I'm done with those other names so you can I don't care if Joseph Branham sees it I love him and we've had public discussions already so um I don't care about that and I emailed him yesterday I emailed him almost every week every Saturday he puts out a new blog post every Saturday it's got lies in it so almost every Saturday I say brother I love you but you're wrong you need to repent here's what he said uh back in March we praise the Lord for God called men that preach the word but ministers place that voice that you and your people are going to be judged by first in other words let brother Adam preach and not you you step down and put that voice first I'm sorry God never asked dead men to lead a Living Church there's not one example in the Bible where a dead man leaves leads living men Hallelujah oh yeah we love you but just you know change the word a little bit to fit our interpretation no sir I ain't taking your interpretation I'm taking God's word praise God and here's what I emailed him yesterday I said brother I said if I ought to listen to your your advice uh eight months ago I'd still be I would have been neglecting my preaching Minister my preaching gift for over eight months and the Bible says neglect not this I was preaching last week and I'll be in the struck me I was like Glory there it is he's the devil's trying to get me to stop preaching the devil's trying to get preachers to neglect their gifts but that's not their gift that's God's Gift amen and God gave those preachers the gifts to feed the people to bless the people to keep them on the straight and narrow to tell them the truth and to preach God's word hallelujah living men not dead men I said I just emailed them yesterday I said brother I'm not going to neglect a gift that's in me if I listen to you I would have been guilty of neglect Church look at it he's trying to get us to be those the man with the one talent and bury it in the Earth see that spirit that's not the Holy Spirit that's the Unholy spirit bury your gift in the ground and just neglect it and let brother random do all the work brother man can't do any more work his work is over can you imagine if we went into a Lutheran church today brother Benjamin and the pastor got up and said well we're happy to be here today we're in our pastor Martin Luther preached to us today and sit down and play uh somebody's voice read a Martin Luther's sermons what would you think of that you think these people are insane well that's what these people are in Jeffersonville they're insane Martin Luther is my pastor John Wesley is my pastor brother Rand is my pastor no you got a pastor in Akron that's me you can have it you can your choice it's your choice you can have any Pastor you want praise God you got any past you want but ain't a dead person it's a living man praise God no Brother Joseph and Jeffersonville I will not neglect the gift that God has placed in my life I'll be faithful to the gift praise God because I'm going to bring forth Jesus say Jesus you gave me one gift here's two I I doubled it by God's grace by your help Hallelujah see that's why I told him I said we are given the five preaching gifts until we get unified in the faith we're not there yet so we still need preachers to get us there praise God it's a smaller group all the time fewer fewer people but the true five-fold Ministry is going to get us there by the grace of God amen hallelujah okay again a few months ago he talked about Russia the call yeah Russia nuclear Wars reality he said the season here what is the season now is the time now see they're saying now's the Rapture now's the Rapture if these guys are saying the Rapture is now it makes me think the Rapture is not now because they're so far off on tapes they're so far off on their Doctrine they have all these false teachings how can they know the raptures very soon if they don't even have the basic Foundation doctrines right how can they be right on that so it makes me think they're not even right it makes me think the opposite that God's gonna let them live on and then just die a natural death and then move on that's what it makes me think now here's the first reason I think preachers think Russia might bomb the USA because there are 11 quotes like this now remember this is during that nuclear scare of the 1950s 60s right I talked to a teacher friend the other day and she remembers being in school where they had the uh the drills for nuclear bombing you had to crawl under your desk like like a desk is going to protect you from radiation right that's what they did in the 1960s right 70s nuclear like today we have fire drills they have new they used to have nuclear bomb drills oh get under the desk it's going to protect you the desk ain't going to do nothing for you but they just wanted to do something to feel like they were prepared but remember said I don't care what takes place if you said the Russians is fixing to pull the trigger this minute they're sending an atomic bomb a real born again Christian has Eternal place or Eternal peace in his heart there's nothing can harm him let the bullet fire why the smoke won't be scattered out across the street here until we would be in glory with Jesus standing there Immortal in his likeness never to be sick never to have a heartache never to have a disappointment praise God so this is why I think preachers think this because there's numerous quotes like this but I challenge any of them show me where any of those quotes are thus saith the Lord that's my challenge to them now let's see if they come up and meet my challenge my guess is they won't because they don't meet the other challenges brother I was talking to a world that's caught up in nuclear war right so he's giving them just this confidence no matter what happens you'll be with Jesus yeah there's 11 like this I could I could show a lot more but I love this and brother Adam says let me tell you he said there's no Hiding Place don't build a bomb shelter he said there is a bomb shelter it's made out of feathers it's under Jehovah ego praise God I just think that's a beautiful one Hallelujah hide under the shelter of almighty God how many hiding there today praise God that's where I'm hiding like I said I don't care if a bomb comes or not I'm a Jesus when it's all what's all said and done I'm with Jesus a second news did you hear this news about Israel they had five red heifers delivered to Israel last month do you hear that from Texas and so these preachers are saying see the Gentiles are helping out the Jews because the gospel first went from the Jews to the Gentiles Maybe maybe I don't know remember they have to have red Hepper heifers to have the Waters of Separation they can't even have a temple service until they have Waters of Separation to sprinkle all the people to sprinkle the outer core inner core holiest of holies and they don't have any red heifers in Israel right now but they just got five from Texas so that's why now this is a pretty good website if you want to go there there's a group called The Temple Institute they got videos I was watching yesterday and here I was studying they have all these women making uh all the gold that goes on all the garments of the priests they're dying the wool in in the in the in this insects that turn it red just like the Bible says in other words all these directions that God gave Aaron all those years ago is now a it's 3 500 years ago these Jews are now being inspired to go make all the garments for the high priest and build all the furniture pieces they're pounding gold to make the Rings and all these things and they they pound the gold to make those pomegranates on the the high priest garments Church we're getting close we're getting ready but that's logical that's logic praise God but see what what but God won't turn to the Jews until he's done with us praise God and every nation has to hear this gospel and then Jesus said is the time of the end has every nation heard this gospel apparently not because Jesus said uh the Israel will be Tron down to the Gentiles until the fullness of the Gentiles become in there's more Gentiles to come into this truth more people are going to get saved amen whether it's our church or not I'm glad someone have come to our church in the last few years amen hallelujah like amen and hood and Austin and Lena praise God I'm glad we're getting some Souls praise God but there's more souls around the world that need to receive Jesus Christ as Lord and savior so here's a few reasons I'm almost done I think I only got a couple more yeah I'm almost done all right can you take a deep breath there I'm almost done here and I'll be happy to take your questions this evening by God's grace if we have a testimony that'd be great too if not it's okay but happy to take your questions this evening I I sure like your questions by God's grace now here's what I don't think this is the the last war like we're like nuclear war is going to happen like any moment brother man told us in the pick up your pen and right which he said the Holy Spirit told him to write but the man said the bride will be forced to stop preaching and ministering to those that need ministering so like that's why that's why they're saying like it doesn't make any sense if they're saying oh the bomb could be any day or any moment well when is when is the government ruling going to come down we can't have church anymore so you can't be a preacher unless you're in our organization when is that going to come down if the bombs are going to if we're going to look out over America and it's only going to be craters brother Bang and then how is that going to allow if there's only craters All Over America how they can have a government to tell us to not preach do you see how this doesn't make any sense everybody see that we've got to have the government tell the preachers to stop preaching to fulfill Revelation 13 16. got your Bible Revelation 13 16. this is what brother man tells us Revelation 13 16 and he callseth all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand and their foreheads so this is the actual moment when the Mark is laid down so brother Graham uses this scripture Revelation 13 16 to show that the bride will be forced to stop preaching but before the mark can be laid down Jesus will take his wife off the Earth because she's kept the word of his patience so Jesus says I'll keep you from the hour of Temptation that will come upon the whole earth praise God that's what road ram taught us that's why I want to hear these preachers I'm like this doesn't sound like brother Branham this sounds just like something they made up I mean they could change overnight like I said but they'd be so cruel I feel like we we I feel like God will prepare us I feel like God is merciful I feel like God will prepare us like we'll see the slow changes we'll see the slow birth pains getting harder and harder and harder where we'll see okay now the government is going to get close to his heart killing Christians that's what I feel like because that's what I've seen in my life like I told you just 20 years ago when I was in high school Bill Clinton signed a law saying there can be no homosexual marriage and everybody rejoiced fast forward 15 years Barack Obama is so happy he lights up the White House and the gay the gay rainbow which they stole from God but God's going to get that back praise God they won't have it very long God's gonna get that rainbow back Hallelujah in fact they never could take it from God if you look at all the reality of it so I believe these wars are just more birth pains they got to get more intense I believe it's not as severe yet as it's going to be because the government will be licensed to kill anyone who defies their their laws their new laws but Ram said Remember the church WIll Unite with the state the the government of America will Unite with the churches and they'll influence them to change the laws to shut down our churches that's what brother Ram said and it hasn't happened yet it's not even close yet to that all right number two um I kind of hit on this earlier uh these are just my notes I didn't get to actually finish this part here yeah fire atomic fire was spoken of in Revelation 13 13. what should be done if you ever wonder where's America in the Bible Revelation chapter 13. he doeth great Wonders that he'd make a fire come down from heaven on Earth in the sight of men that was Nagasaki and Hiroshima from 1945. okay but I can't find fire really mentioned again until after the Rapture so see preachers are making it sound like there's a atomic bomb right right at the moment right before the Rapture right a moment after the Rapture but we don't see that we don't see it till the second half of the Great Tribulation period if you search the scriptures in other words they have no scripture for saying the Rapture goes up as the atomic bomb comes down they have no scripture for that there's none there's none and all the other ones church and I I'll have to maybe preach a part too all the other fire in the tribulation is By Angels not by beasts this is the the Beast out of the earth is the United States the beasts out of the land that's the one that sends on the fire that was America but there's no other fire from Beasts it's always fire from angels all right and so to me the the next fire would be sometime after the 144 000 are sealed the next atomic attack would be sometime after the 144 000 are sealed now I'm not saying I'm right I'm just saying I'm just trying uh by the by the best I can do by the Bible I when is the next fire I can find it's the second half of Daniel's 70th week I have to do a new chart on that to kind of teach you guys through that by the grace of the Lord reason three I don't feel like this is the squeeze so I better get off that one here I got a name on there uh a preacher last week the same preacher who said uh the Rapture could be any moment or any day and the atomic war he said the squeeze is not natural it's only spiritual in other words they're not going to shut our church doors they're just going to spiritually try to intimidate us or something I don't know Brother Brad said it's a literal they're going to close our doors and they're going to they're going to boycott real Christians program said the bride will be forced to stop preaching publicly right that's what Ram said he said but we'll still have a church he said Hallelujah and also I wrote on there um you know we're having inflation this inflation's awful now church but my dad told me in 1973 he had to wait in line to get gas now how many of you had to wait in line to get gas because we're on a ration inflation was awful the the peak of inflation was when I was one year old in 1981 that was a peak of of inflation in America when I was one year old back in 1981. well now we've gone beyond that now we've reached a new level of inflation but have we ever reached a point like this no gas ask Biden for some uh Biden can you lower the prices no it can't right you can't do it Church you had to wait in line like this just to get gas when I was in Guyana that's how it was in Guyana because Guyana is a communist country it's a corrupt country that's how it was in Guyana just 10 years ago you ever seen this before my dad used to do this he had to wait in line to get carved or gas for his cars lawnmower everything because gas was rationed it was so such a shortage and this affected everybody's jobs I mean it just shut down the economy it was just it was awful and again the Russia Ukraine war just seems to be another birth pain like Jesus spoke about as I read earlier he's already done this is his fourth War I don't believe this is the last war before the Rapture I don't know though I don't know also all I know is that people that say they're the greatest of all time are making this claim and I think they're wrong that's my personal opinion I think they're wrong now Church These are also the same people that said brother random prophesied to the coronavirus you ever see those videos on YouTube one of them's got 300 000 views brother Brown never prophesied to the coveted coveted the kova disease or anything like that but the same people that they're trying to read in the quotes and make it look like it's a prophecy the same people that say that are the same ones who say they're the greatest of all time who are saying this this war is a last war and so see church I'm seeing that's what I was telling cam a few weeks ago red flag red flag red flag right when I see all these red flags it tells me something's wrong with these people they're trying to be prophets they're trying to make themselves more spiritual they are actually exalting themselves as the greatest of all time and the fourth reason Church Sinners don't want to die do you think Putin wants to really start a nuclear war do you really think that when this is the only life they have no Eternal hope they don't want to die church we got technology if they shoot off a missile guess what we can shoot off one too what about our allies in the UK they can shoot off missiles as soon as they see one go they can shoot them off you think they really want to die and start a nuclear war I don't think so I don't see it in the scripture before the rapture but again I'm not saying I'm right I'm just saying I'm going back to the scripture I'm trying to point all of us to the word of God does that make sense by God's grace praise God so remember I just closed with this brother gave us two quotes don't worry about Russia men are thinking the Antichrist being Russia get out of your minds the Antichrist is religious Jesus said the two spirits will be so close and deceive the very elective were possible don't worry about Russia they're just a bunch of atheists but the Antichrist sets right by you that's the deceiver now think about that the Antichrist is right or among message churches praise God you can't mention that last week I don't know if you did or not that's the one you really got to watch for yeah we got to watch Russia but he said watch more closely that denominational Spirit that's trying to get into the church cool you down take away your Revival right take away your love for God take away your heart for Jesus the sincerity that you have for Jesus Christ that's an antichrist Spirit trying to take us away from the real love of God see don't worry about Russia Russia is a small pebble on the beach and yet all these preachers are saying oh it's nuclear war time Putin is going to send a nuclear war Putin's going to sell all these nuclear warheads don't you worry about communism brother Brown says you watch romanism when it's uniting with the churches there's nothing written in the scripture about communism ruling the world and I go by the word regardless of what anybody else goes it's the word I believe how do I could say that brother Jesse it's the word I believe it's romanism that takes the world and romanism is the mother of organization now stand to our feet musicians can come that's my stuff I made through all my notes praise God all right hour is that two hours almost two hours hour 45 there by God's grace

nuclear bomb right right after the rash at the time of the Rapture is there a nuclear bomb I don't think so I don't think so and church as you know I'm always open to correction how many no I'm open to correction okay I got some nods Eric I want to be right but I finding all these quotes all these scriptures this is the best I can understand as I told you I'm living my life like I'll get my whole life I don't know if I will but if my life ends up short I know who I'm going with I'm going with Jesus because I've given to my whole life I love Jesus Christ with all my heart soul mind and strength
