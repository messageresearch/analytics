========================================

getting close to the rapture. We're getting close to the persecution. We're getting close to everything that was prophesied. I know it's been 60 years, but saints of God, one day it's going to strike. &gt;&gt; One day when I'll say this, as soon as this economy goes down, it's been on. In other words, there's it's too late at that time. We have to be ready now, right? So, we want to be full of the Holy Spirit, getting refillings after refillings, seeking the Lord the best we can. Uh he's been he's we we have seen he is worthy. We've judged him worthy. He's faithful. He's true. He's kind. &gt;&gt; He's a long-suffering God. He's uh marvelous. He's always been with us. He's not never once forsaken us ever in our tough times and these uh tough spaces. And uh even in all our shortcomings, he looks past it. He sees the blood. He looks at our intentions. He looks at our thoughts and intents. And uh uh we're just trying to say, Lord, my my saying, you know, my my my my my mind towards the Lord has always been, Lord, as soon as I get out of this body, it's going to you won't have any more problems here with this flesh. But he's like, hey, you got to lay that thing down, you got to die daily. Amen. Praise the Lord. So, we're doing our best uh uh by God's grace. So um now in this uh study uh pastor Jesse asked me to to teach on this um uh so we're going to move in this I am definitely not going to be able to capture all this obviously and maybe um as I sitting back here more kind of thoughts came. So there's a lot to this. This is like uh after I taught at brother home at home, brother Cam's like, "Bro, brother, this is um an eye openener." And he said, he said, "Man, we could literally spend one service on each uh personages even to the many because everything goes with this when you catch what this is. Uh there's a lot that goes you just I mean it ties into everything else." &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Okay. But this is to me like just as as like we say with we do a Bible study on baptism. We see fathers from the Holy Ghost in Matthew 2019. When we start Acts n Acts 2, Acts 10, Acts uh Acts 8, Acts 19, these are like literally coffins in that false doctrine. Lally nails it shut. Say this is finished work. It's airtight. Right? So the to me this study here helps to put another nail into uh what we've been teaching as far as solidify it. It solidifies it. So um if we could let's just stand for the reading of the word here by God's grace. We want to uh jump into this uh slideshow. Hopefully this will be a blessing here. And um Revelations 1 1-3. Um, now as as we go about this, I want to try to explain where the Lord's taken my mind on this. Maybe you're already there. I don't know. All I'm going to do is I'm trying to express the way he showed this to me. You've already may have already saw this or thought of this or however, but I'm just going to just reiterate uh what it what I'm thinking here, what the Lord's placed. Um, oh, we have a clock right there. Let me see. Revelations 1 1-3. The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave unto him to shoe unto his servants things which must shortly come to pass, which he sent, and signified it by his angel unto his servant John, who bear record of the word of God, and the testimony of Jesus Christ, of all the things that he saw. Blessed he that readeth, and they that hear the words of this prophecy. And here, this ties right in here. This is very, very important. and keep those things which are written therein for the time is at hand. Let's say a word of prayer. Let's bow our heads. Dear Lord Jesus, we love you, Lord God. We thank you for all your all that you've shown us, Lord. Help us, Lord, to catch these great and mighty things, Lord, which we know not. Um, and Lord Jesus, Lord, we just want to be faithful, Lord, with this little thought, Lord. But Lord, your prophet taught us 60 years ago, Lord. I'm just now catching up to the revelation of this, seeing this in a fresh new light. As the prophet when he taught the seven seals, he said, Lord, he said, the the books become a new book. I've been opening up again, Lord. And Lord, here we Lord, this becomes new and fresh to me again, Lord, just emphasizing everything you've I believe you showed me for the last many years here. And Lord Jesus, we trust this is a blessing to to to uh uh the bride here in Akran to those that are going to make this rapture alive and well. Lord, we love you. Bless them. Keep them God, Lord. And Lord, we ask a blessing upon it. Help me to get beside myself, Lord, to me. You teach, Lord, through this, Lord, and uh your saints here by God's grace as we know we're approaching uh your wife, Lord, tonight. And Lord, how you showed me, Lord, I would not defile your your wife, Lord. But Lord, just want to give the good things that you've given me, Lord, as we look into the water of the word. Lord, we love you in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. You may be seated. Um uh so when these things um we want to try to saints of God, I'm I'm I never got my full college degree. I'm actually a college dropout. And uh uh No, I didn't mean a little longer. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Okay. Thank you. Amen. So, um like I said, I'm a college dropout and I had to go to the trades because if you can't use your brain, you got to use your hands, right? Use your body. So, that's what we do in the trades. We uh sacrifice their body for the paycheck. Uh so um and of course through there as you get many injuries and um things uh aching and sore and uh you lean on this certain part of the knee it lights right up and you're like so we always using the knee pads now uh elbows and just gloves and now we're just just got to make a couple more years Lord willing if we retire if the Lord carries. Um so in that uh we find ourselves uh here in this uh stage of our life and saints of God. One thing I like about uh I say I love and I feel confident is that with every service we're supposed to take up a notch higher. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; Saints of God every time we come to church we should not come uh leave the same way we came in. We should be growing in the knowledge and the grace of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. And he's going to do that through revelation of his word, right? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I believe that's the way I feel uh is that every service we're coming up higher, great getting greater understanding, greing knowledge, and it's become it's just more pe more pieces being put together, right? And uh and that's what we want to do. So this uh evening I'd like to minister um in my little study. This is actually part two, but we're going to start at part two. Uh, and we want to bring this out, and I'm going to try to uh uh get loose. I'm going to try to just yield to the Lord the best I can, saints of God. Um, uh, I I want to bring this and I I want to show you the importance of this uh study. We've all know we all know these things, but I'm hoping this will give you a different uh perspective. maybe like a uh you know how when we come out of the world and we're in the world we're like this right and then we gave our heart to the Lord and we're like this but when you come to the message it just it really opens up we're getting uh and as the prophet said he said you look at binoculars and sometimes uh when I was denomination I was everything in the the the lenses was screwed up and I was seeing three I could look at uh uh um Sister Zur and I'd look at her the binoculars I see three zers oh my goodness but if I actually focus I find one right so when I was denomination I was seeing trinity but when we come to the truth there's only one person so our eyesight becomes greater we're getting eagle like we're a prophetic class we're a special people anointed to see greater things okay um so in this I'd like to start with a quote I mean I usually don't well we're going to start with a quote here so notice I want to see though now notice how the prophet is he is approaching this is the introduction &gt;&gt; yes &gt;&gt; to the church age book &gt;&gt; and this is the way the Lord. I remember in the in one of the sermons he said he said I'll stand on judgment day with this book. He said when he's dealing with the lamb's book of life study he says he he says there'll be some blotted out that were written in there. He says there's some that can be blotted and some that can't and there's some that were never even up there. He says he says if you understand how that works he says check out this book I'm writing. He says if you have any light in it you'll see it right? &gt;&gt; So but notice here notice how he approaches how he writes us. This is the introduction. This is how we're supposed to see these things and incorporate these things in our understanding. He says through this volume with will concern through this volume will concern itself with various major doctrines such as godhead, water, baptism, etc. found in revelations chapters 1-3. In its main theme, he says uh is the setting forth of a detailed study of the seven church ages. This is necessary in order to study the understanding of the rest of revelation. So notice this has to be first. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; For out of the ages come the seals. &gt;&gt; We can't skip, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; The revelation Jesus Christ, we go right to the seals or or the thunders or or like or the or the trumpets. &gt;&gt; Well, let's just study the trumpets, you know, nothing else matters. Let's just start the trumpets. But God gave this revelation. Now remember this is a revelation of Jesus Christ. This is who he is and this is what he's presenting. This is his order, not you and I orders. This isn't my order. This ain't my book. Uh this is his book. This is his revelation. This is the way he wants to present it this way. And it's for a reason. He says out of the ages comes the seals and out of the seals come the trumpets. Out of the trumpets come the vials. Like a first burst of the Roman candle. He says the church ages come forth with the mighty illumin initial. You notice he calls us the first &gt;&gt; initial. He says illumination without there could be no further light. So we don't catch this light. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; You know why the denominations don't understand what the seals are? Because they don't understand what the first initial illumination is. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Oh that first white horse rider he says is the it is the it is Christ coming down. Is Jesus on the white horse? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Well, when they start with the seals like that and they try to figure out all these things of God, they don't even understand the beginning. &gt;&gt; If you don't understand where we are in time, brother said, we can't dislocate, we can't misplace, we can't misinterpret, right? &gt;&gt; And that's what denominations do. He says, he says, "But once the brilliance of the seven church ages given by divine teaching, by the time divine preaching, revelation, &gt;&gt; Jess, Pastor Jesse can preach, he can teach because the pastor's apt to teach. I I consider myself at best maybe the tiniest little nobody teacher there ever was." Right? But here, if I can teach it, doesn't matter. It takes a revelation of God to open this, right? He says, but now notice he says given by divine revelation, light upon light follows. So this we have to the initial illumination is on the church ages. If we miss this light, if we miss any of these stages in the light, we're going into darkness. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; We have to walk in the light as he is in the light. Was he not walking in the church ages? Absolutely. I'm trying to lay a foundation here. He says, "Until the whole of the revelation opens wide before our wandering eyes." Uh, praise the Lord. Now, notice that's introduction. Now, notice this is what we hit this morning here. How did John get here? How did this revelation come to to the people? And then, remember after after uh John was released from the aisle of Patmas, he went back and pastored uh Ephesus until the time of his death. And he brought this revelation and he sent it to all the churches, right? He brought this book directly from Christ. this this this this scribed book and he gave it to all the churches, right? Uh but notice the saints were wondering how do what is coming? Where are we at? What time is it? John, where are we at? There's persecution. Will anyone even see the coming? Lord, I don't even know what's going on. And John's stressed up about this, stressed about this. He says, "Oh, another person in our church has been martyed. Another person is fall away because what? They don't know what time it is. They're standing for the word of God. They're doing everything again for the kingdom of God." And then now John God has to pull John and put him on the aisle of Patmas to get alone with him there as Pastor Jesse dealt with he showed in Jeremiah how Jeremiah was in prison to catch the revelation right here here John was in prison as well on an island to catch the revelation. God has to sometimes pull us out there into like this as brother Vang was saying well we don't really want to go to prison let's do it now while we have free time. Let's do it now before we get to prison. So so we're prepared. Absolutely. If God can show us, how do we maybe even avoid prison, to escape anything? We have to escape death, saints. &gt;&gt; We have to escape death. We have to have faith to escape death, let alone prison. Amen. So, &gt;&gt; he says, "So, no, Jo was a prophet. We know that." And so, they were asking these questions. Now, here's the key. I'm going to show you the key right here to what I think here uh what the I believe the the emphasis emphasis here. Now notice as John was uh notice here in Revelations 1 and10 and I was in the spirit on the Lord's day and behind and heard behind me a great voice as a trumpet. Now notice he was in the spirit on the Lord's day. Where is the Lord's day? He's John's right here. He's caught up. He's now been transferred from around 90 95 98 AD to the Lord's day. He took time travel. He went into the future. &gt;&gt; God translate him to the future. And he's in the Lord's day. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; And he's looking forward. He's looking to to what's coming. He's in the Lord's day and he's looking forward because God runs in time. He's looking forward. &gt;&gt; What is the Lord's day? Ram said he says that's when the days of man have ended because as because one thing what John when he turned to look he saw Christ as a judge &gt;&gt; because the golden girdle was not upon his side or his waist but it was on his paths right he said now he's moved from priesthood to judge so now he now Christ has now come off and and he's doing he's doing something different now he's no longer intercessions over for the Gentiles The gentile time is over. He's in the Lord's day &gt;&gt; and he's the only thing. Now notice if he would have continued in that line, what would he what would he what would what would he be picking up at? Revelations 4 &gt;&gt; into the rapture. Because after the gentile day is over, we're caught up. &gt;&gt; We're out of here. We are going to be with our Lord Jesus Christ. We're we are the bride of Christ. Our bodies will be changed. So if he would have continued on, he would have just went right into the rapture. And then when he was saw the seven seals unfold and all those things, &gt;&gt; but the place where John was caught up in, Jesus said he heard John said, "I heard a voice behind him in time." And he had to look back and here we see we behind me was a voice. John had to look back and what was John's focus now? What was Christ trying to show to John? What was he going to reveal to John? What was the revelation of God? What was the revelation of Jesus Christ now to John? It was not going into the rapture. He had to show him something before the rapture took place. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He had to bring a thought. He had to start bringing his mind, his revelation to him, the understanding to him of what takes place before the rapture. Some You need to know something before the rapture. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. I'm preparing you for the rapture. &gt;&gt; And look what he says here. He says, "And I turned to see the voice being spa turned with me and I saw seven golden candlesticks." So notice he says he's in the Lord's day, but he said, "I want you to see this light first." &gt;&gt; In order to make the rapture in Revelations 4:1 and2, you have to see this first. You have to prepare yourself first because remember now he's judge. He's seeing Christ as judge. No longer, hey, grace, we can, you know, okay, you failed here, you failed here, you failed here. No problem. We got you. We got you. We covered, recovered. Now he is judge. &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes. &gt;&gt; Time's over. &gt;&gt; Good. &gt;&gt; And God is allowing John now to see how he judges the churches. Right now, &gt;&gt; look at here. Now, brother Brandham brings one scripture in when he deals with Christ right here. He says, "Gird about the paths with the golden girdle." He said, "Now he's judge." And he links this scripture to John 5:22. For the father judges no man, but hath committed all judgment unto the son. So notice now he's revealing Jesus is revealing John the judgment of the son. He's revealing that Jesus this is I'm just I don't want to run too far but I want now notice. So as Christ comes into the judgment as he is all committed all judgment unto the son. Look at verse 24. He that heareth my word and believeth on him that sent me hath everlasting life and shall not come into condemnation. So here was John. John found himself on judgment day. &gt;&gt; In the time of the judge, was John in condemnation? &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; No. Because we see later, and we'll hit that. You can hit this later. Pastor Jesse takes this up and runs with it. We find that after all these things, Jesus lays his hand on John and says, "Fear not." &gt;&gt; So, notice here's John, a sinless man, but he was full of the Holy Ghost. He was in the spirit. Oh, he was in the Holy Ghost on the Lord's day and there was nothing to condemn John. Everything that he revealed to John through these seven church ages, there was nothing on his charge. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Praise God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; But now that's John. What about us? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Now, John didn't understand. He saw all these. He didn't know understand what was all this was about because the revelation would be given by Revelations 10:7, our prophet. Right &gt;&gt; now notice here's our rapture right here. Now notice if John would have not been heard the voice of Jesus wanted to continue on. This is what would took place. And after this and I looked and behold the door was open in heaven. And the first voice which I heard was a trumpet talking which said come up hither and I will shoe these things which must be hereafter. So notice after the church age is immediately done. He sees it goes up. He says come up hither the rapture. And then now after the rapture, we see that what Jesus says, I will show you things here after this. &gt;&gt; Good. Good. &gt;&gt; The bride's going to be here watching these things unfold up in heaven. &gt;&gt; There is a time sequence. Brother said he says he says Revelations 5 follows Revelations 4 in time sequence in the church age book. &gt;&gt; Notice here we see the prophet. He says we're going to take up this verse by verse and a lot. I've got scriptures wrote down here, a book of them, and I don't know how far we get into it, but may may the Lord lead us. Now, watch the word is after these things after the church age and all this from hereafter. He says, even use that word hereafter will now be pertaining will take place on the earth after the rapture of the church. See the rapture. This is now going back back now to pick up Israel after the church ages. after the age of the church, Jesus, the church never appears again until Revelations 19. And when she returns with the bridegroom, praise God for the wedding. Amen. Now, this this afternoon, I want us to focus on this next quote. I want to focus on this, and this is where we're going tonight by God's grace. Now, the Greek word for revelation is apocalypse, which means unveiling. This unveiling is perfectly described an example of a sculpture unveiling his work of statuary, exposing it to the onlooker. It is an uncovering, a revealing what's been previously hidden. Now uncovering, now the uncovering is not only the revelation of the person of Christ. In fact, tonight, this is what we're going to focus on. We're not going to focus on the revelation of the future works in the oncoming church age, but we're going to focus now on the revelation of the person of Christ. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is the focus tonight, the person of Christ. Notice, but this is a revelation of Jesus Christ. Now, praise the Lord, brother Malachi and uh his sisters and little brother there have never, I don't think, ever been indoctrinated by what is this? What does this represent? The trinity. But we have, right? The bang has. I don't know about this brother here now, but but uh this is the trinity. This is the trinity. God in three persons. Right. What was the great thing when I heard this word? Because when I was a denomination, they said, "Brother Simon," he said, "when I get to heaven, when you get to heaven, don't you try?" He goes, "Try to imagine." He says, "We get to heaven and there's the father on the throne. Jesus is in the crystal sea with his legs in it just sitting around and here comes the Holy Ghost, the dove just floating around, just flying around the spirit." He goes, "Did you ever imagine it that way?" And I go, "Now I wasn't denomination, just a brand new Christian." I said, "No, I always thought it was Jesus on the throne." And he said, "That's interesting." I said, "Yeah, I I don't know why I don't think of three in there, but I always thought there was just one." But now, what is the most important revelation we have? The New Testament does not reveal another God. It is a further revelation. He says, "Of the one and same God." Christ did not come down to make himself known but he came to reveal the son. He came to reveal make known the father. He says he never talked about two gods. He talked about one God. And now in this last age we come to the capstone revelation. &gt;&gt; The capstone revelation the most important revelation of godhead in the whole Bible that Jesus is God. He and her father one and this is God and there is one God and his name is Lord Jesus Christ. So when I heard the message, what was it? There's one God. That was a tremendous revelation that I've been lied to my entire life. Not even knowing or understanding what tr Trinity was. And we had a great rejoicing. Oh man, we had Bible studies on Godhead. First Timothy 3:16, great is the mystery of godliness. Christ was what God was manifest in the flesh, justified in on the earth or however, seen of angels and and received up in glory. Okay. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; There it is. Right here. I got an X here. Really? Yeah. Absolutely. Now, man, that's the that's that's the capstone revelation. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Did everyone bring their spiritual capstone message? Capstone hats. You are dubbed capstone king. Capstone princess queen. Capstone. Capstone. You have arrived. Or have you? There is one God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; That's basics. But what's a further revelation of the Godhead? Now that Jesus was the word, the logos &gt;&gt; that came out of God, the a spirit body, then the invisible father, then the God himself, the spirit then went and dwelt within the logos. Now you got a greater understanding of the godhead. Wow. One knowing there's one person. That's fantastic. But now we understand the logos, who Jesus was. Oh my, how powerful. He was the pillar of fire. And then out of in the pillar of fire when Moses appeared to there in the backside of the desert as that that pillar of fire, that burning bush out of the void out of that pillar of fire, a voice spoke. And then what was it? It was father and son. The father in the son, the body, right? the logos. Simple. Once again, you have the capstone revelation. You understand the father. You understand God. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I'm capping you off. There's nothing more to know. There's nothing more to understand, is there? Now, I think uh Pastor Jesse believe this same here. Proverbs 8. I believe this is the logos. &gt;&gt; I believe this is the word. I believe this is the pillar of fire. Uh anyhow, so we've arrived. We have we understand there's one God and we understand who Jesus was. He was the word. He's a logos. You're on the mountaintop. You have literally summoned Everest in the spirit realm. T sign your name on top of the peak. Put your tag on there and say, "I've been here. You got it. You understand? Oh my goodness. I know. All I understand all things. The revelation. But Jess, got anything deep for me? &gt;&gt; I already got the capstone revelation of the Godhead. &gt;&gt; We're the bride. The bride knows the husband. Or does he continue to reveal himself? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Is there more to this than what we've thought? &gt;&gt; Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Is there more than just knowing there's one God and that Jesus was the logos? Look what the Bible says. Thou believest there's one God. Cain served one God. Cain worship one God. Cain tried to bring a sacrifice before one God. He says the devils also believe and tremble. &gt;&gt; The devils already have the understanding there's one godhead. There's one person in the godhead. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Otherwise, why would he pervert it? &gt;&gt; Remember, he knows the truth. He has a level, a portion of truth, but then he always perverts and twists it and takes one and makes a three. Yes, sir. Yes. So, where are we going this uh afternoon? Right back here. Now, here's the thing. I was on the spirit on the Lord's day. John was here at the end of the age. Christ, the Gentile door was shut. He's moving to the Jews now, but the Gentile door is shut. Now, we see Christ or sorry, John in the Lord's day. And what is Jesus trying to convey to him? What is uh I'll say it like this. John's right here. The rapture is ready to take place because what? He's already off the mercy seat. He's now Jesus is now judging these things. Will Jesus marry a wife that's spotted, wrinkled, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; Contaminated with humanism, &gt;&gt; spotted with the world, spotted with humanism, uh uh has any flaws or defect on her? &gt;&gt; No, sir. &gt;&gt; He won't do that. Right? &gt;&gt; So he that's why he could not bypass the seven church ages and go right to the rapture &gt;&gt; because because remember John was already in 95 97 98 AD right here at this revelation but John saw there was something wrong in that age. He already called out diatrophies who love to have the permanence among the ministers among the church. Right. &gt;&gt; Right. But God can't leave it like that. He's got to what? He's got Now, the bride has already fallen. We see I mean, we know these things, right? But John, I don't know if he knew or understood, but he did say he's there's many antichrists already in the world now. But in order for Jesus to take his bride up, she must be spotless. She must be pure, unadulterated virgin word bride. She must be a word bride. &gt;&gt; Yes. So, in other words, this bride has to be prepared. How can they be how can he pick up John from the uh Ephesian church age and bring him right here and he be undefiled? There'll be nothing wrong with him. How's he going to get to that condition? See, John had to be shown the seven church ages. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; In order to what that for the end time bride to make herself ready, right? He says now notice he says nickelagenism is organiz organization humanizing the leadership of the church and thereby disposing the spirit. So once nickel comes in it dispos it chases off the spirit of god and once the spirit of god is off then then uh uh uh balamism can come in then and change the doctrines &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; because there's no one to call it out. The holy ghost is no longer in control. The people have not yielded to the holy ghost anymore. He says, "Balum is a denomination denominationalism which takes the church manual instead of the Bible." He says, "But now notice what the prophet says here. But if the rapture should take place at this moment, ignorance would not be no court of appeal from the judgment of God for being in the wrong ranks." &gt;&gt; So how come God had to re reveal the seven church ages? because the seven church ages showed the antichrist spirit through the church defiling defiling the church making it powerless formal and weak right sickly then finally we see in the se the four church age spiritual death struck her &gt;&gt; right &gt;&gt; so when John's here in the spirit on the lord's day right before the rapture he has to get a revelation of how to keep himself clean &gt;&gt; he's giving well god is Jesus Christ is giving you clues he's giving giving you the information needed especially in this day so that what as he said here he says come out come out of her my people that you be not partakers of her sins they receive not of her plagues he has to have a pure bride right that's why when John was in the spear year he had to look back so what God could reveal him something because what we have to make ourselves ready come out of her my people right &gt;&gt; so Now notice and notice and in the midst of the candlesticks one like unto the man clothed with garment down to the foot and gird about pass with a golden girdle. Right? Judgment. Now notice what does John turn to see. I've read this so many times in the church age book and nothing's like why is this even in here? I don't understand what this is. Why is this portion of scripture? I mean I can see this is a very very important but what about these and his head were his head and hairs were white like wool and white as snow and his eyes were as a flame of fire. Okay. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. I read over this time and time for years and I'm just like it's in there for a reason but I just don't get it yet up until about a month and a half ago. And his feet were like fine brass as they burned in a furnace. And his voice is a sound of many waters. And his right hand seven had seven stars. And on his mouth went seven two-edged uh went out a sharp two-edged sword. And his countenance was the sun shineth in his strength. What is this? The prophet breaks it down. He says this is the sevenfold glory of his person or seven personages. &gt;&gt; Did you catch that? It's his person. Sevenfold. These are seven attributes of his person. And what's his person? The godhead. It's who Jesus Christ is. It's what he's done. This is how he's displaying himself in symbolic form. This is how he's displaying himself at the judgment. This is how he's going to judge. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; This is who he is. Would you want to be caught in front of this man right here without the understanding of what was given to us? &gt;&gt; Because the prophet said if you're he says in the time of the end he says he says ignorance will not be a court of appeal. &gt;&gt; Well I didn't know we have a seventh age messenger here a prophet to tell us and give us the revelation of Jesus Christ. Right, brother. Right. &gt;&gt; This is who he is. That's what John saw in symbolic form, right? Yeah, brother. We're getting there, brother. I'm hopeful. I'm hoping I can get there. Okay. But yeah, that's a very that's a very key one. That's a heavy one. That's that's a real heavy one. Yeah. This is a key quote. We have to do this quote. We have to fulfill this quote. Brother, it's not scripture. I know, but this is this is in scripture. This I'm telling you this is important. He knows that the people get the true revelation of the true church and what she is and what she stands for that she can do the greater work. She will be invincible army. Now notice if if Do you choose to? Yes. Do you want it? Yes. If they get the true revelation of the two spirits within the framework of the Christian church. Where's the framework? Where's the where's the two spirits in the framework of church revealed to John? He had to turn back and look and he saw something going on here in the seven church ages. What have we been battling? What has the sons and daughters of God been battling for seven church ages for 2,000 years? The antichrist spirit. But what is keeping what is saving us every time is what? The Holy Spirit. Amen. There's two spirits within the framework of the church. &gt;&gt; Where's the focus on this? Where's the preeminence? Where's the teaching and preaching on this within the framework? And by God's grace, discern and withstand the antichrist spirit. If we do not do this, we'll go into the tribulation. If we do not do this, we'll make the rapture because the bride is not going to have any influence of the antichrist spirit on her at the time of the rapture. At the time of the Lord's day when Jesus comes down as judge. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Every make sense? Make sense? Okay. Make sense? &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Look at this. He says, "For as much as we are the offspring of God, we ought not to think that the Godhead is likened to gold or silver or stone or graven by art and man's device. And the times of this ignorance, God winked at." So there's a time where in the Old Testament, they'd make images of this and images of that and all these sort of things of God and this and that and God winked at their ignorance. And for seven and for I was like this for six church ages God had winged to ignorance that that Columbus believed probably in three persons. &gt;&gt; Luther probably believed in three persons. Wesley probably believe in three persons. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; Because what the antichrist has turned it. Now notice are they going to be there on the rapture? The dead in Christ rise first. We're going to see them first. Even though they believed in trinity but what God winked at their ignorance. &gt;&gt; Yes sir. &gt;&gt; But now in our day is there any ignorance given? That's we're in the most dangerous time. We're in the most deceitful time. We have been given a prophet to come and reveal the mysteries of the mysteries should be finished. &gt;&gt; Now notice notice as brother Randy said a while back. He says notice the Bible says the mystery should be finished. It never said revealed. &gt;&gt; When Jesus was hanging on the cross, what did he cry out? It is revealed. No, he said it's finished. And the disciples had no idea that he was going to raise again. And yet he told them three, four times, maybe more. He said, "When the son of man is given unto the this and this, and they're going to crucify him, but what? He'll raise on the third day." They didn't understand. But everything that needed preached, every parable that needed taught, everything that needed revealed, every miracle had been done and finished. It was already spoken. It was already written. It was finished, but it had not been revealed. Then after Christ rose and they received the Holy Ghost, then the revelation started coming on what Christ had already finished. &gt;&gt; So notice that's why we're growing in revelation. The prophets already come and preach and the mysteries are finished, but are they fully revealed? &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Because if they were revealed, we'd be taking wash already. Now notice, because he hath appointed a day in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom he hath adorn ordained. And who's that? The Lord Jesus Christ. John 5:22. Exactly what John saw in the Lord's day. It's him. It's Christ. And what did he look like? He eyes of fire, a sword coming out of his mouth, white hair, wool, and feet of brass, and all those sort of things. Says God, that's him. That's who's going to judge it. But at that time there's no more ignorance. &gt;&gt; Now look what we see here. Here we see him in a sevenfold personage of his glorified state. In each church age, he approaches them in a different one of those deities, a different one of those glorified states. So with each church age, what we saw there, the seven personages, he's going to pick and choose which one he wants to represent today. And they all have a meaning for each church age. &gt;&gt; All right. Now, like we said here, what is his person? What is his revelation of his person? His personality, his attributes, his mindset. What kind of person is he? Malachi. Now, I believe brother Malachi is a son of God. Does everybody believe brother Mali is a son of God? Absolutely. But somewhere because he's a son of God, he has to have a soulmate. Malachi, could you tell me your your uh wife's name, please? Oh, why not? It hasn't been revealed to him yet. &gt;&gt; And then in a year or two or whenever he God allows this sister to come on the scene, they're going to start talking and then he's going to learn her name and she's going to learn his name. And as they talk, they start to learn more. What's your favorite color, brother? He's like gold. He's like all the spectrum of the rainbow. And she's going to be like, "What color do you like?" She's like, "I like pink." I'm a girl and they're going to start conversing and they're going to start talking. And if the Lord allows, love will strike there and love will strike here. And finally, Malachi can't even start, can't even work on the job. H thinking about her too much, he's got to get married. But until they get married, even though they've shared their favorite colors and their plans for life, I like this kind of kind of car. I like my food like this. They're still not going to know each other until they get married. One day, four months down into the marriage, brother Malachi is going to wake up. What's that noise? Oh, my wife snores. Oh my goodness. Oh, I'm sleep downstairs. God bless. I'm out of here. But he never knew that she could snore that loud before. I'm not I'm just trying to bring this in uh the way &gt;&gt; because as every every husband and wife has to they will find things that drive that at first all you see is perfect love brother Malachi is so big and strong handsome too I'm witnessing that with my my niece Alakans Ally Alli's all in love and she floats she walks on clouds now petals are in her ankles and she is on nine like about this young man over in Kansas. Oh, he throws 95 miles an hour baseball. He's the man. But one day if they get married, she's going to be like, "Wow, he drives me crazy over here on this. But you have to know your mate, &gt;&gt; right? One of the first revelations my wife caught about me is I hate onions. Early in the marriage, she'd make a food, she'd make supper, and had to be like this. What did you put in here? Oh, I just put some onions. Like, do not ever put any more onions in this food, please. And she looked at me and I'm like, I'm serious. She's like, "Okay." I had to That was the only real iron fist I've ever laid down. But she never understood my real hatred to the onions. Right. Just kind of right. This is your husband. Do you want to please him? What was Enoch's testimony &gt;&gt; before his translation? He pleased the Lord. In other words, he knew God. What makes God happy and what makes God sad? What God what makes God rejoice and what makes him angry. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Man, I'm I'm going to if you if you get a chance, man, I'm already 40 minutes. Saints of God. I haven't even got anywhere yet. Okay, let's jump here. No, notice here's Ephesus. These things say saith he that holdeth the seven stars in his right hand. Notice how is he approaching this the the the Ephesian church. He wants the Ephesian church to know this. &gt;&gt; I have seven generals. I'm sending in one for each church. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And I'm walking. Notice it says who walketh in the midst. In other words, it's the same God in each church age. And because he's the same God in each church age, each one of these stars, everyone, each one of these messengers is going to be the exact has going to have the exact same nature and that will be the nature of Christ. Now, one the Bible says each star differs one from another in 1 Corinthians 15. So notice brother Brandham's ministry did not look like I say like St. Paul's necessarily but because of the way we could judge the scripture and see the power of the Holy Ghost the prophets able to say yes St. Paul was the first church age. Then Columbus and Iranius and and Luther and Martin and all those things got he identified by their characteristics and yet they were different stars. &gt;&gt; But notice they were all stars. They were reflecting the same one that was walking through them in the church ages. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; There he is the savior. He says walking in the midst. Now notice if he's if he starts out this way, he's going to be this way all the way through. And if and who Christ is in the Ephesians age, he's going to be in the thyron and Pergamus all the way through the same &gt;&gt; the same. &gt;&gt; There is going to be no difference about him in any church age. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He's going to judge righteously in every church age. He's going to judge the same. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He says is in each star is going to be a reflection of him. &gt;&gt; There he is. the savior, the salvation lord. He says, "So what is this? What is why does he use this? Why does he use who he looks like? Why does he use who he is?" He says, "There he is the savior walking in the midst of the churches through the seven ages. There what what he has in his first age, he is the all ages to every believer. He is Jesus Christ the same yesterday, today, and forever." And and what he did once, he's going to still do and keep on doing all the way. He's going to treat each church the same. Each woman he's going to treat the same. But each woman will have different trials. There'll be different stages. They'll be in dish with this, different that. They'll be stripped of this. They'll be stripped of this. A weaker woman every time. A weaker woman. But what his light, his star is going to be there to strengthen her. What? Through his power. &gt;&gt; Hope this is making sense. Now he says, now you will notice that Jesus is walking alone in the midst of the churches. Now notice this is key because remember we have to determine we have to be able to identify the two spirits. Christ is supposed to be alone in the church ages and he walks alone because he's her keeper. He's her redeemer. He's her savior. He's her husband. But there's another one in the garden as well. There is no one else. Neither indeed can be. For he alone wrought her salvation has purchased her with his own blood. He owns her. He is her Lord and Master. See why he hates that spirit, saints. See why he hates what? Now, what is he getting to? I'm just going to jump here because we're at 45 minutes already. I haven't even touched this. Notice uh he's in the right hand are the power of the seven stars who according to Revelations 120 are the seven church age messenger. This signifies the very power and authority of God are behind his messengers to every age. They go forth in fire and power of the Holy Ghost with his word. They are stars because they reflect his light. Now he says, "These seven uh messengers making uh making God known to the people. He that receiveth them receiveth him that sent them." See how important this is? See how important it is to catch the messenger of your day. If you don't catch the messenger day, how can you receive the one that sent him? Because you would know who sent him. &gt;&gt; They all speak. No, no. They all speak and act upon his authority. He stands behind them with all power of Godhead. &gt;&gt; Why? Because each age they had to come in the portion of the Godhead revealed a further revelation of the attributes or who he was his personage of who he was for that age. &gt;&gt; I hope I I I'm a man of limited uh vocabulary. Now notice, but in the first church age, he's walking. He's got seven generals. I'm going to reach release one for each age. You go, you go. You go. You go. And as John looks back and he sees Jesus walking in the midst, John Jesus tells John, "Write this to the first church age." And this will be how he starts is how he ends, saints. This now this is the first revelation of the Godhead. Furthermore, &gt;&gt; but this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds of the neglatans which I also hate. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; So this is a revelation of the Godhead. What if I hate onions in marriage year number one? It's been 18 years. Guess what? I still hate onions. And my wife has never snuck onions in again since that time. She is spotless before me. Absolutely. But this thou hast that thou hatest the deeds and neglation which notice not as I taught this brother Cam came back after service. He goes brother this does not only reveal the godhead attributes. He said but it also reveals the attributes of the bride. She learns by number she has her his spirit. She has his nature inside of her. And what he hates, she also hates. Yeah. &gt;&gt; Right. &gt;&gt; Notice how much she is like her husband. She initially didn't hate it, but once she received the fullness of the Holy Ghost and the Holy Spirit was leading, she started to hate the very she was able to hate the same things that he hated. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Now, here's the furtherance here. In the first church age, notice, thou has the hated of these, which I also hate. Notice he still hates it here. But notice at this point in time, she did not hate it. &gt;&gt; She was being stripped of the revelation of who God is and what God likes. In this church age, she did not know that God hated nicotism or people over church or ruling the church. Look at the change. In just three church ages, she was stripped of this understanding and yet still had the Holy Ghost. But that what that thumb of the trinitarian, the false baptism has kept her under their under their grasp. &gt;&gt; Now, here's the beautiful thing. But here is the word Christ himself. He there's the anointed word which cometh uh for the rest of his body the bride the anointed of the same water the water the we also talked about water the ta water also waters the tears the anointed ones only the elected and predestined will be able to detect the difference between them &gt;&gt; what they do they were able can we detect the difference between the wheat and tears they were able to back in Ephesus this that's why my pastor we started doing youth nights and brother Cam's like brother Simon for the youth we're going to teach but I want you to do Bible studies for the adults and I felt like I said Lord I'm going to do a study on the deeds of nickelatans so I and I already had many a lot of ammo already but I was looking for what caused the initial fall of the of the book of acts for 20 years they remained p pure pure and undefiled. But what were the things that the nickelans did that came in and caused the fall? What were the very acts? Not not 3:25 AD. I'm talking about what caused the fall. We can look at the serpent. Brother Ram said, he says she didn't believe a lie. She believed the lie. She didn't believe lies. She believed the lie. Singular. &gt;&gt; Right. Everything we see in the serpent, everything we see that that's brought down and defiled Israel, defiled Eve, we see it's taking place here. The exact same thing. But notice we have to get to back to this. Now remember, brother M said there's going to be another Ephesians. He said Jesus Christ was an Ephesian. What? We have to what? Be able to detect the difference between them. They were able to detect by the deeds first of all, but they lost the ability to detect by the third church age. &gt;&gt; Right? Now notice, if you can detect, notice, to him that overcomemeth, to him that's able to detect this and go back to the first love, &gt;&gt; you will gain entrance in back into the garden. &gt;&gt; But can we discern yet? Are we able to discern, brother Jess, when we come in, how many ministers have fallen away and yet they were invited over in the this big church, this just preaching, had gifts, amazing gifts. &gt;&gt; Where are they now? &gt;&gt; Were they able to discern? They were still not able to discern. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; He that hath an ear, let him hear what the spirit saith unurches. to him that overcomemeth. This is where this is number one church age. Notice this is how close they were to the book of acts still. If they would have just went back to the first love they already detected the niclatans. If they would have just went back he said they could have went back to the tree of life. &gt;&gt; They've been back to they made rapture &gt;&gt; but they failed aimed at but they relaxed. Right now, here's this one. These things sayeth the first and the last last. That which was dead and is alive. He approaches this church age. Now, as this attribute, what is it? This moves right into the ox age, death. Christ says, he says, he says, as you're going to die, he says, be faithful unto death. He says, but notice, he says, he says, I was first and last. I was already dead. He says, "And I'm still alive. So when you die, be faithful because you're going to rise with me. &gt;&gt; I'm going to bring you back up again in this rapture." Right? &gt;&gt; He says, "So this is not a man speaking. This is deity." &gt;&gt; This is one of the revelations of Godhead. He says, "Don't worry about your lives. Take no thought for tomorrow. Do this and that. Seek ye the first the kingdom of God." He's in his righteousness. Don't worry about your clothing, your food, or this that. He says, "Why?" He says, "Because if you happen to die, I'll raise you up." Amen. But what this is revealing who he is and that you're going to be with him. This is a revelation the bride has. That's why we can be go faithful what into the into the midst as as uh uh Antipus went right to the heart of the pope. He was what? Anti-Papa, right? He stood right there in the midst of the pope and condemned the whole system and he became a martyr. And that was the one person Jesus said he said to Antabus in that day, my faithful martyr. &gt;&gt; And we don't even know who he is in history. a little no name and yet he stood like this in front of the pope says you're antichrist and it cost him his life. &gt;&gt; But what he had a faithful promise he that which is dead and alive. What's he revealing here? Let's I want to jump now. This is the one in the same person. He has let us know that the church is his. Don't you worry. This little portion, this little dash between the time you were born to the time you die, he says, means nothing. We're going to eternity. Just give me this life. He says he says and you'll gain the rest. Lose your life and you'll gain life. Amen. What? On the other side. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes. Now, so notice he says that is his right. He bought the church with his own blood. Notice in the death he shows what I purchased this. This is mine. This is this should not only reveal that he purchased it, but it should reveal that you were the one purchased. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; When you read the second church age, you say he died for me. And if you accept the true token, the true sacrifice, what? You're going to rise with him. &gt;&gt; He is worshiped. He paid the full price. He has sole ownership of the temple of God. He rules it. He is worshiped in it. He represents He resents anyone taking over his lordship and authority. &gt;&gt; Right? &gt;&gt; Everything Brother Ram's describing that he hates is the Antichrist spirit. He hates when the Antichrist spirit gets in man. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; He hates man leadership. What has been plaguing the church ages? Man leadership. As the as brother Cam promote one time, he says, "What's so close to deceive the very elected?" What what what is the one quote or scripture or whatever that's so close to deceive the very elected leadership of the Holy Ghost plus human &gt;&gt; laying right in the church age book. Sure, we see the anointing of the Holy Ghost. We see this. But then they inject their little thoughts and say, "Well, maybe we should do it this way or maybe my idea will work too." And yet the Holy Ghost is right there. False anointed ones, false Christ. And yet injecting their own idea right now. Let me jump here. I want to jump here. Now notice here. Here we're jumping to this. We're almost an hour. And here's where here's the quote. Here's the quote. No, notice these things. See, say uh these things say saith he which hath a sharp sword of the with the two edges. The message to the third church age is about to come forth. The third scene of the unfolding drama of Christ in the midst of the church is about to be revealed with a trumpet-like voice. The spirit presents the matchless one. He which hath the sharp sword with two edges. Now how vastly different is notice uh uh in the second church age he says I was alive and dead and now liveth again. It shows what they were battling death. But now in this age he's showing something else in the church this third church age. He says, "How vastly different is this representation from the time when Pilate introduced the lamb of God clothed in mocking the robes of purple, smitten with the crown of thorns, saying, Behold your king now regally robed, crowned with glory re stands the risen Lord Christ the God of power." Now notice what the prophet says in these words which we have. He which hath the sharp sword with two edges lies another revelation of Godhead. &gt;&gt; See how important these are? This is a revelation of Godhead. What took place in the church age where God says the sword. He has drawn the sword. He has ignited the sharp terrible sword. Two edges that can discern the thoughts and intents of the heart that can serve what all the way down to bone and marrow and all those sort of things. He's brought he's bringing the word. what has taken place in this day that this is what he's this is his attribute in the Ephesian church you will recall he was sent forth as the unchanging god he hates this he hates this in the smurian church age we saw him as the one true god and beside him was no other now in this pgam church age is a further revelation of his godhead set forth by the association he's revealing himself by his his weapon This is the offensive armor in Ephesians which is the word of God. Here's the scriptures he brings. Hebrews for the word of God is quick, powerful, sharp and dedicious sword. Right? The word in Ephesians 6, take the sword of the spirit which is the word of God. His name is called the word of God. In the beginning was the word. The word was God. The word was God. 1 John 5. There are three that bear record of heaven. The the father, the word, and the holy ghost. These three are one. He's revealing this. This is who he is. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now we can see his association with the word. He is that word. That is who he is. The word is his name. Now why is he doing this? Because brother Brandham said he said in early in his ministry he said he thought the evidence of the Holy Ghost was love. &gt;&gt; Right. It's so good to see you brother. We're knitted like Jonathan and David. We're going and we're like he's got the Holy Ghost. I got the Holy Ghost. But later it took the Holy Ghost to reveal that was not the evidence. The evidence now this is what he goes into this section. This is what the prophet reveals with this portion of the godhead is the evidence of the Holy Ghost. When the bride gets back to being a word bride, she will produce the very works that Jesus produced. Talk about revival. Now notice the word is a spirit. The spirit is God. They are all one. One cannot apart work apart from the other. If one truly has a spirit, he will have the word of God. Right? Now, notice he goes in, he's dealing with the evidence. He's showing what the evidence is. Uh he said the evidence would be that you would be have you would be in the truth. You would be in the word of God for your age. Evidence has to do with receiving the word. Notice &gt;&gt; this is what he goes to. Now, notice I want to jump here. Now, why would he bring forth the sword? He is presenting presenting himself to the church at Pergamus and indeed to all churches. He says, "I am the word. This which I'm giving you, the word is the revelation of myself." Do you understand how dangerous this is? If Jesus is the word, the revelation of the word should be on you. And what is the revelation in Revelations 22? do not add or take away. Why? Because in this third third church age, someone was rising up. This is when the Catholic Church started. &gt;&gt; And who was the main push? Who was the main major guy who changed the word of God? &gt;&gt; St. Augustine was I'll tell you what, I would never want to be in his shoes. It's too late to ask mercy for him because it's already done and said done. These are just some of the things he changed in this age. Notice the the Catholic Church through St. Augustine using intellectual reason, demon-possessed man. He pushed for the persecution of heretics. Augustine. And here Christ is revealing himself with the sword. You come at me with false doctrine, I'll be right here with the sword. &gt;&gt; I'm not playing games. Augustine and saints of God, that's how important it is to stay with say what the prophet said. Don't add to it. Don't take away. Stay what the Bible says. Don't add or take away. &gt;&gt; Right. Right. &gt;&gt; Taught the doctrine. He brought the doctrine of eternal hell. Changing the word. And God said, "Oh yeah, I'm judging you on this day according to the word &gt;&gt; and you can't escape it. This is who he is. This is who he is. This is a revelation of the godhead saints. That's why revelation 22 terrifies me. Taught doctrine of purg purgatory or post uh mot purification. Someone dies and oh he's called into the flame of purgatory in between heaven and hell and this and that and now Malachi if you could just give me $50 I'll pray that your um whatever can get out of Malachi's like oh 50 bucks no problem. Now do my false prayers and and then oh he's up in heaven now. God bless your heart. Here's my 50 bucks. And that's how the Catholic Church became rich many times. &gt;&gt; Read listen to seven church uh church uh 750 years in church of Rome. Again developed the numbering and grouping system of the ten commandments. Changed the ten commandments. Remember how he what he do? He had ten commandments. He took the ten the second one took it out. Took the tenth. Cut it in half. And now we're back to 10. And what do they do? They make idols, images, &gt;&gt; statues of God, the saints and all those sort of things. Teaching the authority of tradition and the of the church, the Roman Catholic Church. No, it's all lower caps for me. Roman Catholic lodge. I should have put a L in there. Lower case L as inseparable from scripture &gt;&gt; and Christ is there watching this and I'm going to judge them according to the word that they perverted. &gt;&gt; That's right. But remember in each age they started perverting the word started praying to Mary and introduced infant baptism. And that's just probably some of them that I found real fast. &gt;&gt; See that's why he was in that third per pilgrimous church a sword. Bless you. Right. Oh God, help us to be real protesters against anything that's not godly. Oh my. Yeah. &gt;&gt; But now to him that overcomemeth that gets back to the word, he's revealing that he's the word. He's bringing the word is him. This is how he's going to speak. This is how he's going to judge it by the word. So we have to get back to the word. But if we get back to the word, if we overcome to him that overcometh will I give him to eat of the hidden mana. If we stay with the word, he's going to take us what? Into the holiest of holies and open up and share the deeper word. [Laughter] But remember, this is also our reward. If we can stay away from false doctrine in this message, we will also be given hidden mana, secret things opening up, revelations untold. He says, "Now give him a white stone and a stone uh with a new name written which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth." Notice in each church age Christ brings forth a further revelation the godhead. He points out what was good, what was bad, and then said if you saints can overcome, he says, "I'm going to give you this reward. We're past an hour already. I'm going to go one more. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; One more. Brother, this is for you. And on the fourth fourth church age, I'll say remember the third church age. What was the problem? Now the deeds of the nickels have become a doctrine standard. This how we do it. Uh you don't do it that way. girl and also was introduced the doctrine of Balum. See remember in this day on the Lord's day John there'll be no excuses then we've got to search this message out find out exactly what the deeds are what the doctrine is become the become deeds right then what balam isis ism is and then into Jezebel's doctrine of Jezebel what's he dealing with this last age and this or in the fourth church age unto the angel the church in Leo and Thitara write these saying the son of man. Notice this is who he is. This is who he is. Saints, let me give you an example. When I was a heathen in college and I was atheist and this and this, I started working at a place called Solder Woodworking. That's where I met Brother Craig and Big Dave and many others, right, Brother Freddy. And my second year as a college help, the year before, my first year, I went to work over at Brush Creek, which is another facility doing this exact same thing and packing. Okay, we pack all these uh RTA uh uh desks and drawers and dressers and all those things, right? Slide it through. Done. And I went to work for a a plant manager lady and I was working this and this and she's like, "Oh." She was like an older lady and she's like, "Oh, I really like how you work." Like, "Okay." And right, I couldn't wait to get back to my old plant because that's where all my boys were playing basketball at night. Right. So, the second year I go back, they assign me to her plant and I was there for about a week and I couldn't handle I could not handle working under a woman. I'm stronger, faster, not taller. It's faster and stronger. Like there's no way I should work under. I never liked being under a woman. I could not handle it. I don't know what it is about me. I don't know if it's that nickel or that Napoleon mentality or whatever like little guy like I just couldn't handle it, right? So I went to the imagine this a college help going to human resources and like I went back to where I was. Well, I don't care what she wants. I went back here. Guess what? They put me back there. I did not. Then sometimes when I got back there, they sent me to another plant where another lady lady's over and I'm like, I can't stand working under here. Why? It was built in me already. Look at Christ in the fourth church age. Eyes of fire. &gt;&gt; Forget the sword. Now I'm dialing you right in. my eyes on you and I'm hot. I'm mad. Fourth church age. Thousand years pass really &gt;&gt; from when the antichrist came in. What is Thyra? A dominating female spirit. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; I'm a little man, but I'm still a man. You know what? I love my wife, but every time she gives me an order, everything it takes all within me to be like, "Okay, okay, I can help you." Because I just don't like getting orders from women. You can give me the youngest punk kid running a job and I'll serve him, but you put any woman over top me. I don't know. Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. That's just who I am. And that's who he am. Notice he says, "These things say the son of God." Now he identifies himself as the son of God. Amen. Who has his eyes like a flame of fire and his feet like fine brass. I'm coming after her. I'm judging her because why? I'm the guy who walked through that persecution. I died. I walked through it by myself. You're right. &gt;&gt; I have every right. I was the one who conquered this. I have every right and now I'm eyeing you up. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; And look what the prophet says before the I'm sorry. This is after the sermon. Look what the look what the speaking tongues interpretation is on this church age. On this church age. Yay my people. This is the interpretation I speak. Pastor Jesse already dealt with this years and years ago. He says, "Yay, my people, I speak of thee. As my prophet has stood in the midst of thee, has declared my holy word. I speak unto thee by my spirit, sayeth the Almighty God. I say that thee, my people, are out in this world tonight." I saying they that thee, my people, he says, that yay, I have spoken days gone by concerning these things, even this very hour. Notice he's just dealing with the Catholic Church. He's dealing with how what she's defiled everything. He gave her space to repent. And now notice what the Holy Ghost is revealing in this time of the fiery eyes. Even this very hour, there are great plans being made. We're seeing them unfold right now. Even while he was preaching this in 1960, there was big shooters. There was world world movers. There are people controlling the realms of the earth making plans that same night while the prophet was bringing forth the word. And we're seeing them now, even this very hour. There are great plans being made. Yay. That this is the Holy Spirit speaking through the gifts in the church &gt;&gt; being made that shall bring the hour of destruction upon America, this fair land. Destruction is coming, saints. And this man with fiery eyes, this man with the sword, this man that with the seven seven uh warriors coming forth, this man that walks at certain seven church ages, he is now declaring by his spirit, the woman that does this is going to destroy this nation. She is going to destroy America. Even in this world tonight, there are spiritual forces being gathered together that shall come against thee, my people. She's gonna rise. What Abraham say? He says, he says, "Right now, we're in peace. The Catholic Church doesn't have power yet to bring persecution, but he she will rise again to kill." He says, &gt;&gt; "They're coming. They're coming for us. Why is our vice president Catholic? Why is our last president Catholic? Why is the majority of our Supreme Justice Catholic? Was Charlie Charlie Kirk Catholic?" I don't know. But his wife had some rosaries sticking out the car, rosary beads. But I say unto thee, he says, "It's coming. It's coming, Jesus. But I say unto thee, be thou not discouraged in that day nor hour." Brother, they're going to take us. They're going to take control. Be not, this is the Holy Spirit, this is the Holy Spirit speaking. This ain't me. This ain't the prophet. This is God himself speaking. Be not discouraged. For I say that I am the great Almighty God. Even as I took my children from the land of bondage, yay, even as I am brought them into the wilderness to the promised land, even shall I take thee home with me. &gt;&gt; Don't worry, you're going to make a rapture. &gt;&gt; You will not see death. &gt;&gt; This woman that I'm judging right here with my fire eyes, she's coming after you again. She's coming back at my bride. But don't worry, I'll be there. I'll save you. I'll swing on down on my on my chariot, on my on my cloud, and come down like Psalms 18. For I say that I have loved thee with my great love. How does he express love? Through correction. Through sharing the secrets, &gt;&gt; yes, sir, &gt;&gt; of the word of God. &gt;&gt; But we have to receive them and detect the true spirits with He says, "And I have called thee out of the world of sin and speak." He's done that. And I speak these words that thou might be a chosen people, and that in thee might manifest my power and glory uh as unto thee that I might be encouraged, that thou might be encouraged. In other words, he's going to display his power through you. Don't worry. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Death's coming, but don't worry, he'll be there right in the midst of the fire. &gt;&gt; Thanks, God. Everything the prophet went through, everything we see in the Bible that they had to go through, we're going to have to we're going to have to walk into death. &gt;&gt; Turn back. Go into the storm. You're getting thrown into a fire seven times hotter. Thou shalt bow down to my image. Daniel Daniel prayed. He went to lions. Then they were all delivered. &gt;&gt; They were all delivered, saints. Remember that. Have faith in God. &gt;&gt; Then it happens again. He's speaking tongues uh interpretation. Yay, my f my servant has spoken tonight. Blessed be my word as it goes forth. My servant is dishonored. Much has been said, much evil is to come upon the earth, sayith the the Lord God. And this is revealed during what? Thyra dominating female. Now tonight he comes with flaming fire. He's looking into sorry down into thyra. This age is the age is married into cath catholicism and paganism or nicicoatism pagism wedded together to form and gave birth to the first church to organize church. What are we waiting for? When this echomunical world council church forms and then church and state are married again. See what it produces? &gt;&gt; This is her. We're going to see her again. &gt;&gt; We're not going to have American law. We're going to have Roman law. Roman Catholic lodge law. But don't worry. But look what brother reiterates. God said that. Notice he goes right back to this. And God said that the deeds of the Galatian, which is the Ephesians over in that little church of Pergamus became a doctrine and said it was a doctrine of Balum. And Baal was the one who taught Israel they're committing fornications and they have committed fornication with Moab which was a lukewarm church member or common church the great orization and we find out that God said that that nicolate's doctrine which he take put all power in a church and set it aside to make an oration he says he says you hate it I hate it too he just keeps saying I hate it I hate it I hate it when are we going to learn this in the message this is a revelation of who he is that's why I that's why every chance I get I blast any Catholic doctrine Anything that came from Rome, come out of her, my people. Anything Catholic, anything Roman, we've got to come out of &gt;&gt; because there's no more ignorance now. And we see how God, look at how he looks at that church. He hates that church. And here it comes into full swing here. See, see how the church squeezed up right in this little thing. How the church they're on now. He says the revelation of godhead in the leosian theotian church age is that god that Jesus is the son of god once in the days of his flesh he was known as the son of man but but henceforth we know him no more after the flesh he's no longer the son of man the great prophet who is back in who in himself gathered together all prophecies the only begotten is back in the in the bosom of the father now we know him after the power of his resurrection all power is given under me in heaven and earth. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He is riven risen and has taken unto himself his mighty power and is above all and over all to the praise of his own glory. His glory will not be shared with another. Who notice who's in the midst now? A woman. The Antichrist spirit now has risen up a church woman who's trying to rule his church ages and he hates it. She's lording over the people. And then not only that, but she has daughters that are lording over the people, saints of God. a bunch of woman controlling God's kingdom. Amen. &gt;&gt; Look at his hatred for it. He displays his eyes of fire. His glory he will not share with another. His leadership over the church. Remember she siteth upon many waters. His leadership of the church he will not surrender to any man, any pope. Notwithstanding, look how loving Jesus is to even her. I have a few things against me because thou suffest that woman Jezebel which calleth herself a prophetus. Now she's claiming to come from God to teach and seduce my servants to commit fornication to eat things sacrificed idols and I gave her space to repent of her fornication. She repented not. And if you look at the timing, she he God allowed her to kill for a thousand years. &gt;&gt; In all of that, she literally had a 1,000year window to repent. &gt;&gt; Look at the And we worry about ourselves. Oh, I had a bad thought and forgive me, Lord. And Lord, I should have said this. I He let her go on for a thousand years. And I gave her space a thousand years to repent, but she didn't. Saints of God, we find ourselves falling short. Falling short. We repent. Repent, saints of God. We're going to be okay. We God has grace for us. Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And she repented not. Behold, I will cast her into bed and with them that commit adultery with her in a great tribulation except they repent of their deeds. See, goes all the way back to the Ephesians. And I will kill her children with death. So notice that's a danger in the in the message churches. Has any of this taken place in the message churches? Is there any antichrist spirit in the message churches? We've got to be able to discern this because if they go so far, they're going to turn like this. Remember when I taught I don't know if you did I teach you the the the doctrine of Jezebel. There's two major things brother brought about that. He says the doctrine of Jezebel is literally he causes spiritual death. But when they have spiritual death, he said they'll get no more revelation. They lose all ability to see to the next light &gt;&gt; because now this not even the light because they missed the light way back there. This is the fourth molting the fourth stage of the antichrist spirit saints &gt;&gt; just like uh they can't if they if they're into bailism they can't discern the deeds. You know many how many ministers I've asked brother uh and humbly I said brother what's the deeds I don't know so you don't know what the deeds are you don't even know what the first revelation of the godhead attribute is supposed to reveal well I know I know there's one god in the log go no no no no no we don't do we even know our husband do we know our husband Because when he comes, when this thing's over, it's over, saints. It's over. &gt;&gt; Be free and clear. Ask God to reveal these things. These this is eternal decisions here. We've got this to me. This is saints God. To me, the way that the way I feel, this is so important. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; Because on that day, there's no excuse. Lord, I didn't know. We have 00 sermons, an entire Bible full, and you can run everything back to the scripture. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, let's uh let's stand by the word of Let's just stand here by God's grace. I've been an hour and 20 already, and I haven't even gotten I want to I don't want to end the end in the uh eyes of fire. Okay, I'm going to fast forward to past past Leo. Okay, let me just fast forward to past Leo. All right, let's just do that. We're gonna keep going. We're gonna keep going. Ah, here we go. As John turns and what does he see? He sees this man as this one liken of the son of man. All these attributes and we found out they were attributes of the godhead. And when I saw him, when he saw these things, I fell down at his feet dead, and he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, "Fear not. I am the first and the last." In other words, I am the father and I am the son. I am all of it. &gt;&gt; He says, "No human being," I'm just going to read this a little bit here. No human being could be could stand the full effect of that vision. Now notice we're talking about John now. Now we're talking about the one he was transported there. Say to God, there's coming a day where the gentile door is shut. And when that's shut, he that is filthy is filthy still. He that is unjust is unjust still. He that is holy is holy still. He that is righteous is righteous still. There's coming a day that's literally going to happen. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; Do we want to be Now notice John found himself as holy as holy. Otherwise he would never be able to stand. He says his strength was utterly gone. John fell to as his feet as though dead his hand the hand of the Lord in love touched him. This is you at that time and the voice of the blessing said fear not be not afraid. Don't be afraid. I am the first and last. I am he that liveth and was dead and behold I am alive forever. What is there to fear? &gt;&gt; Amen. If we have separated from all these things, if you can study these attributes of the Godhead and say, "Lord, if you hate it, if you don't like it, I'm staying a mile million miles away. I'm not I'm not staying six inches from the edge. I'm hugging that wall. &gt;&gt; And right over there is death." Right? &gt;&gt; I'm not going to look at it. Not putting anything wicked before my face. Right. &gt;&gt; Going like this. Going like this. Just walking the path. I'm good to go. &gt;&gt; Amen. Praise the Lord. It's me, the Lord. Guide me. am keeping right on the sir. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; What is there to fear? The judgment that fell upon him at the cross at the grave. He says, "And when he descended was for us, he absorbed the full blunt of the wound of sin. And there is therefore no now no condemnation to them which are in Christ Jesus." &gt;&gt; Notice notice remember when he saw him that that girdle was on his his past, right? Showing he was judged. But now look what the prophet says. He says, "He absorbs a full blunt." Now surely our attorney is our judge. He switched. He says, "Look, I'm a judge, but when he came and touched her," he says, "But you'll be okay. I've already paid it for you. You're already accepted in the beloved." Amen. He says, he says, "He is both attorney." He says, "Our attorney and judge." See, we have nothing to fear. Everything's stacked in our deck. We were deceived. We were what? We were tricked into the saints. &gt;&gt; But he sent a prophet to tell us what to avoid. stay away from. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; As judge, the case is settled. It is finished. There is there now no condemnation. Why should the church fear? What promises failed to manifest before us? Why should it fear punishment or death? Charlie Kirk went and did what he did. He went fearless saints &gt;&gt; and God took him fast. Think he You think he suffered? He was out the way that I mean he was out. And just like that into the next dimension. Why should we fear punishment or death? It has been overcome. Here is the mighty conqueror. Here is the one who conquered both worlds of seen and unseen. &gt;&gt; And he's going to don't fear John. Don't fear little flock. All what is he saying? What is the prophet bringing? What is the interpretation of this laying the hand on the bride? Haven's all. Oh, Lord, I see you. And he says, "Fear not." &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Fear not. &gt;&gt; That's right, brother. That's right. &gt;&gt; Fear not. Don't fear. Don't fear. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; All my power is yours. See what's going to take place on that day. All my power is yours. the saints of God. Remember when Jesus on the cross? He said, "No, you not. I could call 12 legions of angels from my father and he would send them." Did he do it? Who's going to fulfill that prophecy? You could have 10,000 people surrendering you and the Holy Spirit hit you and say, "Send the legions, Lord." And they'll come down and I don't know what's going to happen, but all authority, all power, that same power that Jesus had to just call is going to be yours. My omnipotence is yours as I stand in your midst. I am not come to bring fear. Yeah, these are hard things, brother. the sword, the eyes of fire, the this and this. But remember, we're on the remember in that church ages was two churches. &gt;&gt; There was the true bride and the false. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; You are the true saints. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; You're not in a Roman Catholic church right now. You're in a church who receive what? The true word of God. Amen. You've been baptized in not a Catholic baptism, but the baptism of the Bible. Amen. All power is given to me and it is yours to use. Wow, that's pretty powerful, brother. You speak the word and I'll perform it. Oh my goodness. We're going to be invincible army because what? We've discerned the two spirits within the framework of the church. That is my covenant with you and it will not fail. Saints of God, how do we get it? Amen. Cut every obstacle from human beings that they might be connected in the Garden of Eden. connected like in the Garden of Eden. &gt;&gt; See, now there's you're gonna get power, but you have to do something. &gt;&gt; It cost you something. &gt;&gt; Now, man, I'm going to choke. I was going to choke it, but I'm going to say it. Man is omnipotent. The only way you're getting out of here in a rapture, you don't believe it. A man, but what does it what does it what does it cost? A man fully surrendered to God is omnipotent. We had an example. Brother Ram came. He was fully surrendered to God and he entered into the third pole. You will have to be fully surrendered as John was. Did not he say in Mark 11:22, "Whatsoever things you say and don't doubt in your heart, it shall come to pass. You can have what you've said." Malachi gonna come play. And sister, what happens when two omnipotents meet? When God and man comes together, two omnipotent, something has got to shake. Brother, Pastor Cam's been working on the body and the headship. You know what the problem right now in the church is? There's a body. We have a body. But have the have we connected with the head? Because we have connected with the head, we're going to have the same mind. We're going to have the same faith. We're going to have the same signs and wonders, and we're going to have same power. But at that time of the capping when that capstone comes down, we're going to be connected like that like this because we're going to need it on this day &gt;&gt; when this thing when remember brother said once they drop this econ economic system it's on she will buy she will purchase the whole world she we will have she will we will have a bailout a Catholic bailout and the stage is that when God and man comes together, two omnipotence, something to shake down whatsoever you say with that creative power of omnipotence of God, knowing that he's promised it and he said it, it is in his word. It creates a power that goes out yonder and bring things to pass, things that is not. It makes them as though they are because two omnipotents have met. There he stand. Oh, isn't he wonderful? That's the end. But saints of God, we've got to find, we've got to know our husband all the way. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The antichrist came in and for four church ages it went down, down, down, and she was dead. And then brother said he is like in nature, he had to bring forth a Luther, which is a blade. And then a stalk came in Wesley. And then what? Pentecost was the shuck. And now we're coming back to seed saints. And he's coming back for a harvest. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; But remember, we have to stay pure seed, pure word. &gt;&gt; Yes. &gt;&gt; I'm just going to say this kind of boldly. We can't even incorporate the voice of the prophet if it doesn't line up with the scripture. &gt;&gt; Right. Yes. &gt;&gt; Well, brother Brham said, brother Ram said, Brother Ram said, we have to make sure it's in the word. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Now remember, it'd be great if he was still here. Brother Jess, I would let you have the first interview before me. Go ahead, take your time. I'll just wait, but I want to listen. Can you bring your recorder in there so I can hear, too? The recording of interview with Brother Ram, with Brother Jesse Smith. We put on tape, right? We don't have that now. So now we have to get in the spirit to hear, lay before God, and hear and know. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just say a word of prayer. Saints of God, if you need prayer this this evening, I know it's been a long teaching, but saints of God, I hope I was able or the spirit is able to convey to you what we're looking at. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; The niclatan spirit is not a light spirit. &gt;&gt; This is not something we just lightly, oh yeah, the antichrist. We should be honing this stuff in. We should take out the sword and slice and dice and cut this anti anti-word stuff up. [Music] Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; This is who he is. Amen. &gt;&gt; Let's just bow our heads. &gt;&gt; Dear Lord Jesus, we love you. &gt;&gt; Lord, I thank you, Lord, for open my eyes to this, Lord. And Lord, I just trust that they were able to hear what you would have them to hear. &gt;&gt; Lord, I know how I see it. I wish I could I wish I had the education or the the ability to use words and to use big words and nice smooth sayings, God, Lord, and just kind of bring it how it would be a real nice Lord, some people can bring, Lord, these hard things in a flowery sermon, but Lord God, I just Lord, this is how you built me, Lord. But Lord, I believe this is so important. I believe this is going to come play here right at the end, Lord. And Lord Jesus, I don't want to be caught on the ignorant side. I don't want to be c caught on the side. I I didn't know Lord. But Lord Jesus, you sent all this word, Lord, to identify who you are, what you like, what you don't like. Lord, no one can say on the time at the time of the shutting door, at the time of the rapture, well, Lord, I thought it was okay to be in the Baptist church. I thought it was just okay to go to church and pay my tithes. And Lord, but Lord, we we have more word than that. We have more understanding, more revelation. Lord Jesus, we know we have to be born again. And Lord, we have to make ourselves ready. Lord, we love you. Bless the people. Thank you for giving them strength to endure long teaching, God. But Lord, we are looking forward to your coming. Lord, grant us strength. Grant us grace and mercy. Lord, bless the people. Protect them on the way home in the name of Jesus Christ. Amen. Amen. Saints, if you have any questions, I'd be happy to try and answer the best I can. Uh, if not, Pastor Jesse can pick these things up and roll. Hope he I'm sure he caught the revelation of it. See the importance of it. Once you see what this is, saints, I didn't even have a chance to even go back in the scripture and deal with eyes of fire and sword and spirit and psalms and job and all the saints of God. It's laying in there. How important his word, you know, in Psalms, it talks about how his word is pure. It's been tried seven times in the fire. That's the same thing. What? going right back to church age that that in the third church age with the with the sword of the spirit saints. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; It's laying right there. He is serious about his word. Amen. Uh Pastor Jesse, you want to come? Let's just sing songs to the Lord Jesus.
