[26:31] thraise. Let's stand on our feet. make a
[26:33] few prayer requests here as we stand
[26:35] here. One, two prayer requests. The
[26:38] Graham family has some sick children or
[26:40] some sickness. So, let's pray for them.
[26:42] And brother Adam, would you come pray
[26:43] for these brother? That' be okay. The
[26:45] Graham family needs prayer
[26:47] here. And also just prayer pray for
[26:50] three people getting baptized today.
[26:51] Brother Chad Lamb's
[26:53] church Bible study with him yesterday
[26:56] with the help of Wesley Godfrey. They're
[26:58] all three men are are deaf, I believe.
[27:00] was able to Wesley was able to sign the
[27:03] message of water baptism to them. All
[27:05] three want to get baptized today. So
[27:07] very thankful for that. Let's pray that
[27:09] they keep pressing on into the faith.
[27:11] Amen. The name of Russ, Benjamin, and
[27:13] Hunter. We have to remember that.
[27:14] Brother, just so you know, if you want
[27:16] to pray for them now as we lift them up
[27:18] in prayer, God, use our brother Simon.
[27:20] They're in a wonderful way. So very
[27:21] thankful for that. How's sister Chie
[27:23] Does she have baby yet? Yes, she does.
[27:25] Glory. Let's give the Lord a round of
[27:26] applause.
[27:29] [Applause]
[27:31] this boy.
[27:33] God heard our prayers. Amen.
[27:36] Our prayers fit into his perfect will
[27:38] this time. Very thankful for that.
[27:40] Praise God. Just those two requests.
[27:42] Anybody else have any other needs on
[27:43] their hearts? Blame it.
[27:48] Okay. What's her name? Is it Lucia?
[27:50] Lucille.
[27:56] Pray for God's will there.
[28:03] Any other
[28:07] requests? Before Adam comes, just let
[28:09] you know. As you can tell, I got rid of
[28:11] one row up here. I felt like there was
[28:13] just a lot of there wasn't much room.
[28:15] So, I might even move up the first row a
[28:17] little bit. That means in the future
[28:19] when everybody's here, when all the when
[28:21] all the families with little kids are
[28:22] here, we have to save the last three
[28:23] rows for children with parents with
[28:26] little children.
[28:27] And so just so you know, like I count it
[28:30] up, we have 26 seats in the last three
[28:32] rows and we got 25 people if all the all
[28:35] the young children and mothers and
[28:36] fathers if they all come. So we need
[28:38] those last three rows for the young
[28:40] families by God's grace. But today I
[28:42] think we have numerous families out. So
[28:44] sit anywhere you want today by God. But
[28:47] just be mindful it's always only on
[28:48] Sunday. You don't have to worry about
[28:49] that on Wednesday or Sunday night. Just
[28:51] Sunday morning by God's grace. And also
[28:54] sister Sarah had a birthday I believe on
[28:55] Friday. Let's give her a round of

[45:27] The word of God. Praise God. Praise God.
[45:50] I guess we'll uh we're going to do three
[45:52] passages of scripture by God's grace.
[45:55] Amen.
[45:58] Turn to Exodus
[46:11] 16:31. Everybody feeling good this
[46:14] morning? Amen. Yes. Amen. We know on
[46:17] this day what almost 2,000 years ago
[46:19] Jesus Christ rose from the dead which
[46:23] which gave us that sealing power. Amen.
[46:28] Lost for all that would receive him that
[46:31] we could go on into glory with
[46:34] God for this the s day this Sunday.
[46:39] Glory.
[46:41] Hallelujah. the old time saints felt led
[46:44] to meet on this
[46:46] day. Special day just set aside and just
[46:49] just to come worship God and how it's
[46:52] worked into our society and culture that
[46:54] the Sunday would have off that would not
[46:56] work on that
[46:58] day. So we had freedom for of religion.
[47:02] We can go to any house we choose or any
[47:05] place to go and worship the God of our
[47:08] choice. Amen. and thank the Lord Jesus
[47:10] Christ that he has opened our eyes to
[47:12] see who he really is. Amen. We can
[47:15] worship the true Lord Jesus Christ.
[47:19] Amen. Amen.
[47:21] So let's read these three passages of
[47:23] scripture in Exodus
[47:29] 16:31. Just a simple thought this
[47:32] morning.
[47:35] Um, Exodus
[47:37] 16:31 says, "And the house of Israel
[47:40] called the name
[47:41] thereof mana. It was like a coriander
[47:46] seed,
[47:47] white, and the taste of it was like
[47:50] wafers made with honey." Amen.
[47:55] Turn to
[47:57] John 13 verse 26.
[48:14] And Jesus answered, "He it is to whom I
[48:18] give a sap when I have dipped it." And
[48:22] when he had dipped the sap, he gave it
[48:26] to Judas a Scariot, the son of Simon.
[48:29] Yes.
[48:32] Turn to first Peter 2 verse 2 through 3.
[48:36] Amen. And then we'll say we're praise
[48:40] God. Praise God.
[48:46] Amen. First Peter 2 chapter 2 verse two.
[48:56] It says, "As newborn babes, desire the
[48:58] sincere milk of the word that ye may
[49:01] grow thereby if so be ye have tasted
[49:06] that the Lord is gracious." Amen. So,
[49:10] let's bow our heads.
[49:13] Dear heavenly father, Lord Jesus, we
[49:14] just love you, God. We thank you for
[49:16] this morning, Lord, for this day, Lord.
[49:18] You've kept every soul, Lord, and
[49:20] they've pushed their way out to the
[49:22] house of God, Lord. just bless them God
[49:24] Lord with a supernatural blessing this
[49:27] morning Lord Jesus Lord extra spiritual
[49:29] strength God Lord extra spiritual
[49:32] anointing God Lord may they just have
[49:34] that spiritual hunger Lord God deep down
[49:36] within them Lord Jesus Lord that keeps
[49:38] us God Lord Lord don't ever let your
[49:40] hand off of us God Lord hold us Lord all
[49:43] the way Lord that your hand would be
[49:44] upon us every day of our lives Lord and
[49:47] at that specific moment Lord may that
[49:49] hand just pull us right up into the
[49:51] clouds God to be called away with you
[49:53] forever and ever. Lord, we love you,
[49:55] Lord. Just bless this little Sunday
[49:57] school, Lord. And Lord, just uh just be
[50:01] able to keep everything right on the
[50:02] word. Yes, Jesus. We're right on topic,
[50:04] Lord. We just want to have you want you
[50:07] to have full control, Lord, over this
[50:09] little tiny vessel here, God. We love
[50:11] you. We trust you, God, Lord, in all
[50:14] things. Lord, just bless your service,
[50:16] God, in the name Jesus Christ. Amen.
[50:18] Amen.
[50:19] Praise God.
[50:24] I forgot that's my pastor and I'm sure
[50:26] he sends
[50:27] greetings from living water.
[50:31] Amen. You know, we all have full-time
[50:34] jobs here. You know how hectic that can
[50:36] be and running here and running there
[50:37] and forgetting this and forgetting that.
[50:40] Uh this week's been kind of hectic. I've
[50:41] been on the first two days. I was on the
[50:44] first or second slash third shift and
[50:46] then I was kind of worked worked pretty
[50:49] hard those two days and I went right
[50:50] back to first off Wednesday. So you know
[50:53] how it goes. You're tired. We're out and
[50:55] of course Wednesday service. you get
[50:57] five and a half hours of sleep because
[50:58] you get to live so far from
[51:01] home. And we had Sunday school for uh
[51:05] Precious Saints uh there Thursday night
[51:07] at uh at a brother's house there to feed
[51:10] him with more more words, more Bible
[51:12] studies. Amen. And then I come home
[51:15] Friday after work and I just passed out
[51:16] on the couch. But we did have good Bible
[51:19] studies on yesterday. Amen. Praise God.
[51:22] Two those three brothers in prayer. Uh,
[51:25] I believe they got a taste of the
[51:27] difference of the word that you and I
[51:29] eat every day, this mana, and something
[51:34] to them. You could see and they wanted
[51:35] to get baptized today. So, we're
[51:37] trusting that God will get them baptized
[51:39] by God's grace. Amen. So, um, if I had a
[51:43] little title for this morning, it would
[51:46] be, uh, taste the feeling.
[51:50] Amen. Taste the feeling. So, praise God.
[51:54] I believe it was in February I was
[51:56] little out after the job. I was in
[51:58] Michigan and I told my wife we're going
[52:00] on a vacation. So we went to a vacation
[52:02] down in
[52:03] Texas. And on the way back the the
[52:07] stewardist lady there that runs the
[52:09] aisles. She says sir and ma'am do you
[52:11] want something to drink? I said
[52:12] absolutely. I said what do you want? I
[52:14] said what do you have? And I said well
[52:15] let's grab a Coke. Uh she gave me a
[52:18] little cup there with ice and coke in it
[52:20] and gave it to me and gave me a napkin.
[52:22] on the napkin. The Coke slogan now is
[52:26] taste the feeling. Man, that just that
[52:29] thought went through me. Taste the
[52:31] feeling. Taste the feeling. And saints
[52:33] of God, every time when you go to
[52:35] service and the man of God is up here,
[52:37] the pastor or the minister or whoever is
[52:39] teaching and and and and it feels so
[52:42] good when he's bringing forth the word
[52:44] and you bring out nuggets here and
[52:46] nuggets there and you eat them up and
[52:48] you that just feels just amazing. You've
[52:51] actually tasted the word of God. It's
[52:54] come into your spiritual ears and it's
[52:56] went down into your spiritual stomach
[52:58] and man, it just tastes so good.
[53:00] Absolutely. And that's what that's what
[53:02] it feels like every time we come to
[53:04] service that we hear something just
[53:06] fresh. We know we believe this is not a
[53:08] denomination. We're not controlled by
[53:11] men. We know that your pastor is being
[53:14] not not given a sermon topic or a sermon
[53:17] title or a program from another man
[53:19] higher than him, but he's getting
[53:21] something fresh from Jehovah himself.
[53:25] Jesus Christ from heaven. Absolutely.
[53:26] He's here what? To open the word to you.
[53:29] Amen. Amen.
[53:32] So when I was thinking all these things,
[53:33] I uh had went to Exodus there and I
[53:36] started thinking about taste of feeling
[53:38] and where did the taste really begin
[53:40] with? And I thought about the mana from
[53:41] heaven. Now, this as we go into this uh
[53:44] uh me and my my brother uh Cam there and
[53:47] my pastor there, we were we were looking
[53:49] at a scripture there uh uh back there in
[53:52] John 13 and we had pondered and prodded
[53:55] and kind of and I'm hoping by God's
[53:57] grace we can open that up to you just
[53:59] have a little more understanding in the
[54:01] word of God because I believe it's
[54:02] opened up uh to us by God's grace. Amen.
[54:06] So turn to Exodus 12:32.
[54:12] Taste the feeling. Exodus 12:32, he
[54:16] says, "Also taken your flocks." This is
[54:19] Exodus as they're being
[54:21] expelled. Egypt didn't want no more.
[54:24] There's too many plagues, too many
[54:25] deaths. They have spoiled Egypt. And
[54:28] Egypt was left ruined. And they said,
[54:30] "Get out from among us." Pharaoh finally
[54:33] said, he said, "Get out of here. I don't
[54:34] want nothing to do with you no more.
[54:36] Your God's just too powerful. And verse
[54:39] four, one more out of us. Get out of
[54:42] here and go serve your God. He says,
[54:44] Exodus 12:36 says, he says, "Also take
[54:47] your flocks and your herds as he has
[54:49] said and be gone." He says, "And bless
[54:51] me also." He said, "The Egyptians were
[54:54] urgent upon the people that they might
[54:56] send them out of the land in haste."
[54:58] They're pushing them. Get out of here.
[55:00] Don't have nothing to do with us
[55:01] anymore. We can't stand you guys. Right.
[55:05] Right. I don't know what took place, but
[55:07] something's come down from heaven and
[55:09] moved mighty upon this land and then
[55:11] wiped it out. And I think you're part of
[55:14] the
[55:14] cause. Get out of here. Sure. And look,
[55:18] he says, "And the Egyptians were urging
[55:20] with the people that I send about the
[55:21] land in haste, for they said, we be all
[55:24] dead men. If they stay any longer, not
[55:26] only the first four will be gone," he
[55:28] said, "but the rest of us will wipe us
[55:30] out because of the judgments of God."
[55:32] Amen.
[55:33] But look at the people of God right
[55:36] here. Uh Israel, he says, "And the
[55:38] people took their dough that was before
[55:41] it was leaven." They took it before it
[55:43] was lev and they're knitting cross being
[55:45] bound up in their clothes upon their
[55:47] shoulders. So anytime you're about to
[55:49] leave, usually the one when you get to
[55:51] the point when you want to leave the
[55:53] world, you receive an unleavened word,
[55:57] not a denominational word, one that's
[56:00] got leaven and sin and man-made creed
[56:02] that'll keep you right in Egypt. But
[56:04] here their bread at the time of
[56:06] departure unleaven. Amen. When I was
[56:09] stuck in Pentecost, I started hearing
[56:13] word that was unleavened, that was pure.
[56:16] for the mysteries opening up the true
[56:18] doctrine of baptism, the true doctrine
[56:20] of God that and I had all this all this
[56:23] bread here that was unleavened and I put
[56:25] it up and I threw it on my back and I
[56:26] headed out of Egypt.
[56:30] I can relate to this scripture.
[56:35] Absolutely. This is our this is our
[56:38] truly out of the world into the promised
[56:41] land which is the Holy Ghost. Amen.
[56:43] Glory. And the people took their dough
[56:46] before was leaven and their kneading
[56:48] trolls. He bound up the clothes. He
[56:50] says, "And the Lord of Israel did
[56:51] according to the word of E Moses. And
[56:54] they borrowed of the Egyptians. They
[56:56] spoiled a lot of silver and jewels of
[56:58] gold and rain." He lord gave the people
[57:01] favor in the sight of the Egyptians.
[57:03] Yes, sir. He says, "So they let out such
[57:06] things they had required and they
[57:07] spoiled the Egyptians." Amen. Amen.
[57:11] Glory. Verse 20. I'm sorry. Verse 38.
[57:14] And the mixed multitude went up with
[57:16] them also. And the flocks and the herds
[57:20] even very much cattle, and they baked
[57:22] unleaven cakes of the dough which they
[57:25] had brought forth out of Egypt. He says,
[57:28] "For it was not leaven." Look, they kept
[57:31] it pure. And as they headed out, they
[57:33] kept it pure and they baked cakes and
[57:35] they ate the pure word of God.
[57:38] Absolutely. Amen. For the what they had,
[57:40] they knew was right on the word.
[57:42] Absolutely. Amen. He said because they
[57:44] were thrust out of Egypt and could not
[57:46] tear it, neither had they prepared
[57:48] themselves any word or the seeing Moses
[57:53] come down or led up the Holy Ghost. And
[57:56] when these folks bring the word of God
[57:59] to the people, they made their what?
[58:02] Their belief system pure. They knew
[58:05] there was now a true God that was going
[58:07] to come and deliver them out of the
[58:08] slavery. Absolutely. And they were hand
[58:10] in hell. Now it was time to start
[58:12] booking. Time to start trekking out of
[58:14] Egypt right into what? They were heading
[58:17] to the land of glow. The Lord
[58:21] land. Absolutely. And gra uh clusters of
[58:25] grapes so big it took two men to hold it
[58:27] on their shoulders. Absolutely. Yes.
[58:28] Amen. Now, as we get down further, just
[58:31] a couple days, maybe a week or whatever,
[58:33] down the road in Exodus
[58:36] 16:E2, he says, "And the whole
[58:38] congregation of the children of Israel
[58:41] murmured against Moses and Aaron in the
[58:43] wilderness." He says, "And the children
[58:44] of Israel sent what to God that we die
[58:47] by the hand of the Lord in the land of
[58:49] Egypt, when we sat by the flesh pots,
[58:52] and we to eat bread to the fool. For you
[58:54] have brought us out forth into this
[58:56] wilderness to kill this whole assembly
[58:58] with a hunger. And saints of God, we
[59:00] have not experienced the lamb in this
[59:03] message. You heard the true word heard
[59:07] what everything unfolding and things are
[59:09] getting clearer and
[59:12] clearer as
[59:14] glory to God. Amen. Yes, sir. Yes. Thank
[59:17] you, Jesus. said, "Saith the Lord of the
[59:19] Moses, behold," he says, "I will rain
[59:23] bread from heaven for you." Notice what
[59:27] this was. What? The former rain bringing
[59:30] what? The bread from heaven. The word of
[59:33] God now comes down to the people and
[59:36] saints of God. This is us. It started
[59:39] raining in the 40s and the 50s and 60s
[59:42] and the rain, the bread just come on
[59:45] down. Absolutely. Amen. It looks like it
[59:48] to me. Oh my. He says, "And I'll rain
[59:51] from heaven for you." He says, "And the
[59:52] Lord shall go out and and the people
[59:54] shall go out and gather a certain rain
[59:57] every day." But what was the bread sent
[59:59] forth? It was sent to prove them. Yes.
[1:00:04] Amen. Yes. Beautiful. We listen sermons
[1:00:07] from the 40s and 50s and the 60s. And
[1:00:12] that bread that we eat as we listen to
[1:00:15] these sermons and we go to service and
[1:00:17] listen to the ministers. That bread that
[1:00:20] we eat is going to prove you. Yes. Yes.
[1:00:24] You say you've come out of Egypt. You
[1:00:26] say you've left denomination. This bread
[1:00:28] will prove you. Yes. It'll see if you're
[1:00:31] real or not. Amen. It'll protect you
[1:00:34] every moment, every day. We must be
[1:00:37] sure. Amen. Glory.
[1:00:40] It's the proving bread. Hallelujah.
[1:00:43] Amen. Notice that bread that they came
[1:00:45] out of Egypt, though it was unleavened,
[1:00:48] that was not the bread that was going to
[1:00:50] prove him, but it had to be the bread
[1:00:51] from heaven. Amen. It must be the
[1:00:54] supernatural spiritual bread. Glory.
[1:00:57] Glory. Who can tie these scriptures in
[1:01:00] like this prophet through God?
[1:01:04] or God through the prophet. Yes. Or vice
[1:01:06] versa. Yes. How can you write these
[1:01:08] Bible studies? How can these things How
[1:01:10] can the word just come together that no
[1:01:12] man can do that? That was Jesus Christ.
[1:01:15] Amen.
[1:01:16] This was not a a super intellectual. He
[1:01:19] was a Kentucky.
[1:01:22] Yes, we know the kingdom. Amen. Yes,
[1:01:27] sir. As we've battled many denominations
[1:01:30] or or preachers or this and that and
[1:01:32] however from then you find out this word
[1:01:35] is unbeatable.
[1:01:38] You want to fight fight simple use
[1:01:41] baptism. Amen. Can you can't even mess
[1:01:45] with all they can do is deny it. That's
[1:01:48] right. Or say, "Well, I'm not sure this
[1:01:50] or I'm not sure that or they always use
[1:01:52] reasoning. They have no scripture."
[1:01:55] That's right. Amen, brother. That's
[1:01:56] right. Amen. Very simple, saints. Amen.
[1:01:59] Amen. Praise the Lord. He says, "And
[1:02:02] why?" He said, "That I may prove them
[1:02:03] whether they will walk in my law or no."
[1:02:08] Right. Right. So this ran from heaven,
[1:02:12] this manner was sent to prove whether
[1:02:16] and approves you every day if you be in
[1:02:18] the faith. Amen. Why? Because of what
[1:02:20] that bread is no longer just falling,
[1:02:22] but now it's in us. And what is written
[1:02:24] all in our hearts and every time we make
[1:02:26] a wrong action or say a wrong thing or
[1:02:28] think a wrong thought it proves us.
[1:02:30] Absolutely. We don't repent it'll get
[1:02:33] us. Yes. Amen.
[1:02:36] Exodus 16 verse 31.
[1:02:40] Now look he says and the house of Israel
[1:02:43] called the name thereof mana and it was
[1:02:45] like the coriander seed and it was
[1:02:48] alive. So they come down in the morning
[1:02:51] and the dew had just already just come
[1:02:53] down and now they upon the dew comes
[1:02:55] these little seeds and they're little
[1:02:57] white seeds.
[1:02:59] Yes. Yes.
[1:03:03] And the taste of it was like wafers made
[1:03:06] with honey.
[1:03:09] Amen.
[1:03:12] And Moses said, "This is the thing which
[1:03:14] the Lord commanded." He says, "Billing
[1:03:16] over of it to be kept for your
[1:03:18] generations, that they may see the bread
[1:03:20] which I have fed you in the wilderness
[1:03:22] when I brought you forth from the land
[1:03:25] of Egypt."
[1:03:27] So they kept some of this and put it in
[1:03:29] a little over and they put it right in
[1:03:30] the the holiest of holies right in there
[1:03:32] in right in the uh uh the ark of the
[1:03:34] covenant by God. Yes. Yes. And the high
[1:03:36] priest would be able to go in there and
[1:03:37] taste of it and know this is the exact
[1:03:39] same thing that God sent down from
[1:03:41] heaven. Absolutely. Amen. Sure.
[1:03:44] Hallelujah.
[1:03:45] Absolutely.
[1:03:49] Now, Exodus
[1:03:51] 16:34, as the Lord commanded Moses, so
[1:03:55] Aaron laid it up before the testimony to
[1:03:58] be kept. And the children of Israel did
[1:04:01] eat mana 40 years until they came to a
[1:04:04] land inhabited. They did eat mana until
[1:04:07] they came to the bors, the land of
[1:04:09] Canaan. And
[1:04:20] That's right. Wow. Amen. Right. Wow. Did
[1:04:24] not come ready. It came in the sea for
[1:04:28] Why? Now look at the process, the
[1:04:30] refining of the mana. Now in numbers 11
[1:04:34] verse one
[1:04:39] and when the people complained it
[1:04:41] displeased the Lord because they got
[1:04:43] tired of this man this word. Right.
[1:04:46] Right. Right. All these things.
[1:04:48] Absolutely. Amen. But now look at the
[1:04:50] refining here. He says and when the
[1:04:52] people complained and displeased the
[1:04:54] Lord and the Lord heard it and his anger
[1:04:55] was killed and the fire of the Lord
[1:04:57] burned among them and consumed them
[1:04:58] where the uttermost parts of the camp
[1:05:00] arrived. Now they started complaining
[1:05:03] and and and verse four says they were
[1:05:04] fellow lusting and the children of
[1:05:06] Israel also wept again said who shall
[1:05:08] give us flesh to eat. Jesus we remember
[1:05:10] the fish and didn't we not eat in the
[1:05:12] Egypt freely the cucumbers and the
[1:05:14] melons and the leaks and the onions and
[1:05:15] the garlic. Hi uh sister case she gave
[1:05:18] me some garlic wild garlic this morning
[1:05:20] I can still taste it a lot of
[1:05:23] mercy. Verse six he says and now our
[1:05:26] soul is dried away. There's nothing at
[1:05:28] all besides this mana before our eyes.
[1:05:30] Look, it became nothing to them. But
[1:05:32] look how they were fighting as this
[1:05:34] white seed come down from heaven. They
[1:05:37] had to gather this white seed, this pure
[1:05:40] seed. White represents what? Purity. And
[1:05:43] it was in seed form. Look at verse
[1:05:45] seven. And the mana was as a coriander
[1:05:48] seed in the color of as the color of
[1:05:51] vanilla. And the people went about and
[1:05:54] gathered and ground it in mills.
[1:05:57] and beat it in a mortar and baked it in
[1:06:01] pans and made a case of it. And the
[1:06:02] taste was as the fresh
[1:06:07] [Applause]
[1:06:08] [Music]
[1:06:10] oil comes in seed form, but it must be
[1:06:13] baked and mixed. It's got to be beaten
[1:06:15] and growing down. It's got to be broken
[1:06:17] down against produce the oil
[1:06:21] [Applause]
[1:06:23] under the Holy Ghost.
[1:06:27] that when they come out of Egypt and
[1:06:28] they had their own unleavened bread,
[1:06:31] that bread did not produce oil, but
[1:06:38] only just like the Holy
[1:06:44] Ghost. They make bread and pancakes and
[1:06:47] waffles and all these things, right?
[1:06:50] They taste it and say, "Oh my, this
[1:06:53] tastes so good. Oh my." And what? They
[1:06:56] never got sick. Yes.
[1:07:00] Whatever was infected. Yeah. They never
[1:07:02] got Yes. Glory. They never got weak.
[1:07:05] They never got diseases.
[1:07:10] Amen. Glory. Why are people falling away
[1:07:14] from this message? Right. Yes, sir.
[1:07:18] They're sick. Yes.
[1:07:22] laying and eating off the bread. Have
[1:07:25] they just left it in seed form? Or are
[1:07:28] they eating it and baking it and looking
[1:07:30] at it
[1:07:31] themselves at home?
[1:07:34] Go to their home and pray the page and
[1:07:36] doing the things this prophet said to do
[1:07:39] which came from God. Yes.
[1:07:42] Yes. Are they sick? Yes. Everything we
[1:07:47] need is in this
[1:07:52] yes. Glory. Glory. Amen.
[1:07:56] Glory. Hallelujah.
[1:07:58] And the taste of it was as the taste of
[1:08:02] fruit.
[1:08:04] Oh my. Glory. It was not in the person,
[1:08:08] but it was in the word itself to have
[1:08:10] the oil. The secret lies within that man
[1:08:13] of seed. Amen. He was it was right there
[1:08:18] in the Holy Ghost the whole time. Yes.
[1:08:21] Yes. Amen.
[1:08:27] Rightly dividing the word of God. Amen.
[1:08:29] Hallelujah. Amen.
[1:08:34] Oh man.
[1:08:38] Psalm 78 verse
[1:08:43] 19. David is rehearsing the mighty exile
[1:08:48] of
[1:08:49] Egypt. Psalm 78 verse 19.
[1:08:54] Yay. They spake against God. They said,
[1:08:57] "Can God furnish a table in the
[1:08:59] wilderness, saints?" Yes. Can he Can he
[1:09:02] give us something to eat in Leoa?
[1:09:05] Are we going to die here in Leosa? Are
[1:09:08] we Does God have something prepared for
[1:09:10] us? He's always been feeding his people.
[1:09:12] Absolutely. Because I've seen I've seen
[1:09:15] how David put never seen the righteous
[1:09:17] forsaken or begging bread. Amen. What
[1:09:19] God has always he will not let his
[1:09:22] people starve to death. He's not that
[1:09:24] kind of dictator.
[1:09:26] He's not a dictator. He's a king.
[1:09:30] Prove he was the king. Love him for
[1:09:33] proving that he was the king.
[1:09:36] Glory.
[1:09:39] Can he furnish a table in the
[1:09:41] wilderness?
[1:09:43] I wish God would name the table.
[1:09:46] Yes, sir. Oh my goodness. Yes, sir.
[1:09:48] Amen. Verse 20. Behold, he smoothed the
[1:09:51] rock and the waters gushed forth and the
[1:09:54] streams overflowed. Can he give bread
[1:09:56] also? Amen. Yes, he did.
[1:10:00] Amen. Can he provide flesh for his
[1:10:02] people? Yes, he did. That things that
[1:10:05] mean absolutely. That takes what evil
[1:10:07] claws to grab them? Yes. He said they
[1:10:10] had a Lord who earnest and was wrong.
[1:10:12] And so a fire was killed against Jacob,
[1:10:14] anger against the
[1:10:16] Israel because they believed not in God
[1:10:18] and trusted not in his salvation. Though
[1:10:21] he had commanded the clouds from above
[1:10:23] and opened the doors of heaven. Notice
[1:10:27] it does not say the windows. It says the
[1:10:32] doors. Amen. You are bread of God. If
[1:10:35] the bread of God came down, it hadn't
[1:10:37] come from a door cuz Jesus Christ is the
[1:10:40] door. Revelation one, he says, "And the
[1:10:43] door in heaven was open and what? We
[1:10:45] must go up." Amen. Yes. Glory.
[1:10:48] Absolutely. Amen. He says they commanded
[1:10:52] the clouds from above and opened the
[1:10:53] doors of heaven and had rain down mana
[1:10:56] upon them to eat and have given them the
[1:10:58] corn of heaven. Yes. Yes. Here's where
[1:11:02] my documents. When I first had fried
[1:11:04] okra, I was like, that must be angel
[1:11:07] food. Oh my, I love that fried okra. I
[1:11:10] just, oh, what's that angel? Deep fried
[1:11:12] angel tears or something. It was just so
[1:11:14] special to me on the highest cook. But
[1:11:16] then here says, man, eat angel's food.
[1:11:19] He says he sent them meat to the
[1:11:22] Amen.
[1:11:24] Something powerful about that spiritual
[1:11:28] mana. I'll say like that. Even in that
[1:11:30] natural manner, it was all symbolic. We
[1:11:32] know these things. Sure. Yes, sir.
[1:11:34] Glory. Now, for a couple years, me and
[1:11:37] my pastor, we like to talk every once in
[1:11:39] a while about certain scriptures and
[1:11:41] say, "Brother, what do you think about
[1:11:42] this?" And what do you think about
[1:11:45] that or this and this? And and we come
[1:11:47] upon a
[1:11:48] scripture because we know the Bible says
[1:11:52] that every jot and every will come to
[1:11:56] pass. Right? Everything has a meaning.
[1:12:01] So if you want to know the meaning of
[1:12:03] something, just ask God and wait on and
[1:12:05] he'll bring it. Amen.
[1:12:17] John 13 26. Amen.
[1:12:22] Tasting the field.
[1:12:32] John 13 verse
[1:12:35] 26. Then Jesus answered, "Pe it is to
[1:12:39] whom I give a sock when I have dipped
[1:12:42] it." And when he had dipped the sock, he
[1:12:46] gave it to Judas the Scariot and the son
[1:12:48] of Simon. And me and my pastor be like,
[1:12:50] "Well, what did this what does this do?
[1:12:54] There must be something in here. Why
[1:12:57] would Jesus Christ as identifying
[1:13:02] this man the son of predition? Yeah. He
[1:13:05] needed a certain way to identify him.
[1:13:08] Right. Because we know what that Peter
[1:13:11] had a desire to know who this was, who
[1:13:14] this betrayer was. Right. Right. Right.
[1:13:16] Peter knowing this the little special
[1:13:19] connection between the Lord and the
[1:13:20] beloved one. John delays in the bosom of
[1:13:24] Christ and just all cuddly just like my
[1:13:26] nieces
[1:13:26] [Laughter]
[1:13:30] like Peter
[1:13:33] goes asking who it is. Yes. Yes.
[1:13:42] John, who is it?
[1:13:47] And Jesus said, "To whom I give the son,
[1:13:52] not not just the son,
[1:13:57] not just this, not just this, rips it,
[1:14:00] breaks it, and gives." He did not do
[1:14:03] that. He dips it first.
[1:14:06] Yes. Yes. And he gives it to probably.
[1:14:13] Yes, sir.
[1:14:15] Me, my pastor, brother. What does this
[1:14:17] mean? I don't know what was that
[1:14:20] symbolic. What exactly was he trying to
[1:14:22] convey here? Right. And I I sat on this
[1:14:27] spot for almost two or three years
[1:14:29] waiting and waiting and waiting for the
[1:14:32] Lord open.
[1:14:34] Amen. three, four months ago, maybe
[1:14:38] five, something like that. Cam was
[1:14:41] preaching on a Sunday morning. He was
[1:14:42] just a Wednesday night or something just
[1:14:44] preaching, just getting it. And I sit
[1:14:46] front row center like right here, this
[1:14:48] that and all of a sudden I go I look
[1:14:51] right into the ceiling kind
[1:14:53] of and the thought of this scripture
[1:14:55] came right back to my mind. I said,
[1:14:59] "Lord, you're pulling me out of
[1:15:01] service." He pulled me right out of
[1:15:03] service. Well, Lord, what is it? I said,
[1:15:06] Lord, show it to me the scripture.
[1:15:10] Amen. And we're going to convey this
[1:15:12] thought so it's clear in the word. We
[1:15:15] want to open this up by God's grace for
[1:15:17] you tonight. Amen. Amen. Amen. Now, not
[1:15:21] a super great, super something, but
[1:15:23] saints of God, everything means
[1:15:25] something. And I love it when the word
[1:15:27] opens up and you can see it and he makes
[1:15:30] it plain. It's right in his word. Amen.
[1:15:33] not going to pull something out of the
[1:15:35] Book of Mormon. He's not going to pull
[1:15:36] something out of apocrypha or anything.
[1:15:38] It's going to be right in the word of
[1:15:40] God. Yes. Amen. Right in the holy
[1:15:42] scriptures. This is hidden. Just laying
[1:15:44] right there. Yes. Amen. Glory.
[1:15:51] Psalms 41 verse 7.
[1:15:55] We're just going to run through these
[1:15:56] little Judas scriptures here. Yes, sir.
[1:16:00] We'll catch him.
[1:16:08] Psalms 41 verse 7. All that hate me
[1:16:12] whisper together against me against me.
[1:16:17] They devise my hurt.
[1:16:20] Judas going to meet the Pharisees.
[1:16:24] Right. Right, brother. Good.
[1:16:27] Pharisees say he's already having
[1:16:28] meetings. We got to get this guy out.
[1:16:30] He's doing too much. The people's faith
[1:16:33] is growing to an unprecedented level.
[1:16:36] He's gaining so much popularity and fame
[1:16:39] and they're just so much faith behind
[1:16:41] this man. They believe him to be a
[1:16:43] prophet. We thought we already had one.
[1:16:45] Thank God they had him cured through
[1:16:49] King
[1:16:51] Herod, stepdaughter,
[1:16:54] however. And Judas is now having
[1:16:56] meetings with them. Is Christ correcting
[1:16:59] a couple things in his home church? He
[1:17:01] said, "This this thing's supposed to
[1:17:03] what? This was done in my remembrance."
[1:17:05] Remember when the woman brought the
[1:17:07] alabaster box and broke it and what and
[1:17:09] the scripture says that Judas was the
[1:17:10] one that rised up the steward of the
[1:17:12] disciples to have said to the poor,
[1:17:14] right? Cuz Judas held the bag, right?
[1:17:17] And he was fixing on and when Jesus said
[1:17:20] no, he said do let her do it unto me for
[1:17:23] preparing for my burial. Right. Right.
[1:17:29] He says they des they devis my hurt and
[1:17:32] evil disease say they cleaveth fast unto
[1:17:37] him. Thou art beheld above. What the
[1:17:39] prince of the devils absolutely said he
[1:17:41] had a spirit on him an antichrist spirit
[1:17:43] right said he had
[1:17:46] disease and
[1:17:48] now that he lith he he shall rise up no
[1:17:52] more. They killed him. His name is gone.
[1:17:56] He'll never rise again. Yay. He says,
[1:17:58] "My own familiar friend whom I trusted."
[1:18:01] He said, "Look, which did eat of my
[1:18:04] bread." Right.
[1:18:08] What the son was bread. That's right.
[1:18:12] Right. Right.
[1:18:15] Has lifted up his heel against me. Yes.
[1:18:18] Yes.
[1:18:20] Now, John 13 verse 16.
[1:18:24] We know this is the scripture that
[1:18:27] Christ quoted here in John 13 verse 16.
[1:18:30] He says verily verely I say unto you the
[1:18:33] servant is not greater than his Lord
[1:18:36] neither he that is sent greater than he
[1:18:38] that sent him. If you know these things
[1:18:40] happy are ye if you do them. I speak not
[1:18:44] of all you I know whom I have chosen
[1:18:46] than God.
[1:18:49] He says but that the scripture may be
[1:18:51] fulfilled. He that eateth bread with me
[1:18:54] hath lifted up his heel.
[1:18:57] You see now Christ knowing picking up in
[1:18:59] the scripture in the word where the
[1:19:01] scene is in Psalms, he picks it up. He
[1:19:03] says this day the scriptures. Amen.
[1:19:06] Amen.
[1:19:08] That's done. That portion is done. But
[1:19:11] it must go further now to the actual
[1:19:13] act.
[1:19:18] Go to Oadiah one.
[1:19:35] 1 vers1 the vision of Oadiah thus sayeth
[1:19:38] the Lord God concerning Edom. Now who is
[1:19:40] this? Edom reveals here in uh uh down
[1:19:44] here just down through the scripture
[1:19:45] here. He says we have heard a rumor of
[1:19:47] the Lord and an ambassador is now sent
[1:19:49] among the heathen. arising, let us rise
[1:19:51] against her in battle. So now they're
[1:19:54] going to rise up in battle. What?
[1:19:56] Against this bride or against Christ and
[1:19:58] his church? He says, "Behold, I made
[1:20:00] thee small among the heathen. Yet thou
[1:20:02] art greatly
[1:20:05] despised." Now look this this looks just
[1:20:08] like now remember the first coming of
[1:20:11] Christ in the true message of his
[1:20:15] day there was a Judas there. And saints
[1:20:18] in this message The Judas have not left
[1:20:21] yet. Arrived on the right.
[1:20:25] Now look how look how he brings us in
[1:20:26] verse three. The pride of thine heart
[1:20:29] has deceived thee. Thou that dwellest in
[1:20:31] the cliffs of the rock whose habitation
[1:20:33] is high saith that he saith in his
[1:20:35] heart. Who shall bring me to the ground?
[1:20:37] What they dwelling in the cliffs of the
[1:20:39] rock? Up here with what? With eagles
[1:20:41] dwell. Though thou has exalted thyself
[1:20:44] as an eagle, and though thou set thyself
[1:20:48] thy nest among the stars, one of God,
[1:20:50] the son of God, the daughters of God,
[1:20:52] they diet among us.
[1:20:56] Thus, I bring thee down, saith the Lord.
[1:21:02] Now look at verse six. How are the
[1:21:04] things of Esau searched out? Notice he
[1:21:09] brings the Esau, which is what? Jacob
[1:21:10] and Esau, what? Twins. Every time
[1:21:12] there's a spiritual revival, there's
[1:21:14] that produces twins. Good and evil right
[1:21:17] in the mix. It's been a mystery all the
[1:21:19] way through the church
[1:21:20] ages. Two seedlines right through.
[1:21:23] Right. Absolutely. He says, "Now, why?
[1:21:26] Now, why is he Esau? Esau had the He had
[1:21:30] the promise of the birthright. He was
[1:21:35] the one that was supposed to receive it.
[1:21:36] He was there first. He come out first.
[1:21:39] And he was exactly what the daddy
[1:21:42] wanted. But we find out he sold out for
[1:21:44] what? Carnality.
[1:21:47] For a mess of page. Correct. Absolutely.
[1:21:50] Now he says, "And all verse seven, all
[1:21:53] the men of Confederacy have brought thee
[1:21:55] even to the
[1:21:58] border." And what the promised land they
[1:22:01] brought him right up. If you even look
[1:22:03] at the tabernacle in the Old
[1:22:05] Testament, there was the outer courts,
[1:22:07] the inner courts, the holy place in the
[1:22:09] holies of holies. Saints God a minister
[1:22:11] can bring us all the way right into the
[1:22:14] altar. Then the brass lav get baptized
[1:22:18] and then they go into the holy place and
[1:22:19] go right into the candlesticks and
[1:22:21] they'll teach you about the church and
[1:22:22] then head over here to the the showbread
[1:22:25] and look at the 12 lows there and teach
[1:22:27] them about Israel and dive a little bit
[1:22:29] into the trumpets or however into the
[1:22:31] Old Testament and they get right up to
[1:22:32] the altar of incense which is teach you
[1:22:35] how to pray but they'll not take you
[1:22:38] walk into the holiest of holies the
[1:22:40] promised land. Right.
[1:22:43] Absolutely.
[1:22:47] Now he says, "The men that were at peace
[1:22:49] with thee have deceived thee and
[1:22:51] prevailed against thee." He that eat thy
[1:22:54] bread have laid a wound under thee. He
[1:22:57] says, "There is none understanding in
[1:23:00] him." They're eating the same spiritual
[1:23:02] bread as we absolutely.
[1:23:07] Now shall verse eight. Shall I not in
[1:23:10] that day, sayeth the Lord, even destroy
[1:23:12] the wise men out of Edom? The
[1:23:16] intellectuals, he says, and the
[1:23:18] understanding out of the mount of Esau.
[1:23:21] The intellectuals will not make it in.
[1:23:23] This takes the simplicity of the
[1:23:25] preaching of the word of God. Nothing
[1:23:27] bad about deep things, but saints of
[1:23:29] God. We have to go into the holy place
[1:23:31] to where the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:23:33] can what sees us and take us all further
[1:23:35] in where we can just yield and the Holy
[1:23:37] Ghost takes over. Sure. Amen.
[1:23:40] That's right.
[1:23:42] Now, Psalms
[1:23:47] 14:E1, I saw the title of this three
[1:23:49] times on the billboards from Coke and I
[1:23:51] said, "Man, Lord, do you want me to
[1:23:52] teach
[1:23:53] this?" And then, Brother
[1:23:56] Malachi, the family night prayer time,
[1:23:59] uh, reading the Bible time last night,
[1:24:00] read this same scripture right here. So,
[1:24:03] I I believe it was the
[1:24:05] Lord. Psalms
[1:24:09] 14 verse
[1:24:11] two. The Lord looked down from heaven
[1:24:14] upon the children of men to see if there
[1:24:16] was any that they did understand and
[1:24:18] seek God. He says they have all gone
[1:24:21] aside. They are all together become
[1:24:22] filthy. There is none that doeth good.
[1:24:24] No, not one. He says, "Have all workers
[1:24:27] of iniquity no knowledge. What? who eat
[1:24:30] up my people as they eat bread and call
[1:24:34] not upon the Lord. Wow. Wow. What do
[1:24:38] they do? Saints of God, they are just
[1:24:41] using the people who do this. What was
[1:24:44] Judas? It was a corporate. It was a
[1:24:46] spiritual ladder. A corporate ladder.
[1:24:49] You get in the business business field
[1:24:51] and they'll they'll push elbows and
[1:24:53] stuff people down and they try to get to
[1:24:54] the top of this corporate ladder
[1:24:56] climbing and climbing and climbing.
[1:24:58] Sure. But they don't care about the
[1:25:00] person on the left. They don't care
[1:25:01] about the person on the right. They have
[1:25:02] to make themselves something bigger.
[1:25:04] That's right, brother. Right. And what
[1:25:06] the Bible says they consume the people
[1:25:08] as bread.
[1:25:11] It means nothing. You're
[1:25:13] consumable. A tax write off.
[1:25:17] Absolutely. Sure. He says, "Have all the
[1:25:19] workers of man in no knowledge." He
[1:25:21] says, "Eat of my people as they eat
[1:25:23] bread and call not upon the Lord."
[1:25:27] M sure if you want to write this down go
[1:25:30] to Micah 3 1-12. It talks about how they
[1:25:34] they eat the people but it's actually
[1:25:36] they're taking bribes of money and
[1:25:38] trying out uh women have one scripture
[1:25:39] there by God's
[1:25:42] grace. Micah 3:11 he says the head
[1:25:46] thereof judge for reward and the priest
[1:25:48] thereof teach for hire. He says and the
[1:25:52] prophets thereof divine for money.
[1:25:55] But if you go to the scriptures above,
[1:25:56] they're consuming the people. They're
[1:25:58] ripping the flesh and the and the skin
[1:26:00] off the people and all that all those
[1:26:01] things. And God says they're just
[1:26:03] robbing them of their money.
[1:26:06] Amen.
[1:26:13] Now go
[1:26:19] to Micah 52.
[1:26:24] So I said Lord where showing a scripture
[1:26:26] what does this
[1:26:29] represent Micah 52 this is the
[1:26:35] prophecy of where Jesus Christ be born
[1:26:39] that's right amen but thou
[1:26:43] Bethlehem Epherta though thou be little
[1:26:46] among the thousands of Jude Judah yet
[1:26:49] among thee shall one come forth unto me
[1:26:51] that is a ruler in Israel. Amen. And
[1:26:53] who's that? That's none other than Jesus
[1:26:55] Christ. Amen. You know what? Come out of
[1:26:59] Bethlehem. Yes. Now in Matthew 2:1 says,
[1:27:02] "Now when Jesus was born in Bethlehem of
[1:27:05] Judea in the days of Herod the king,
[1:27:07] behold, there came wise men coming from
[1:27:09] the east of Jerusalem." So Jesus Christ
[1:27:10] came to Bethlehem. Now what's so propent
[1:27:13] about
[1:27:14] Bethlehem? Bethlehem means the house.
[1:27:18] Yes. Amen. Yes. So once again, God
[1:27:23] opened the door of heaven and poured out
[1:27:26] one little piece of what? A mana and it
[1:27:29] dropped a seed and that seed grew and it
[1:27:32] baked and became what? The bread of
[1:27:34] heaven. Amen. Amen. And what happened to
[1:27:37] come to Bethlehem because that's where
[1:27:39] the bread comes from when we I was
[1:27:41] growing up in the Bible. Yes. We used to
[1:27:43] go to old Pentecostal church and after
[1:27:45] that we drive by this bread factory in
[1:27:47] defiance and man used to smell so good
[1:27:49] after service so hungry and just the
[1:27:51] bread factory
[1:27:53] cuz that's where bread made
[1:27:56] right so that's where Christ came by and
[1:28:00] was raised right there for a brief
[1:28:01] season absolutely right there
[1:28:04] amen now glory let's get back now
[1:28:10] here so Jesus Christ
[1:28:13] is the bread of heaven. Amen. That's
[1:28:17] right. Amen.
[1:28:20] John 6:30.
[1:28:24] John 6:30. They said therefore unto him,
[1:28:27] "What sign showest thou then, that we
[1:28:29] may see and believe thee? What dust thou
[1:28:32] work? Our father did eat mana in the
[1:28:34] desert, as it is written, he gave them
[1:28:36] bread from heaven to eat." And Jesus
[1:28:38] said to him, "Babil you, Moses gave you
[1:28:41] not that bread from heaven." He says,
[1:28:43] "But my father which giveth you the true
[1:28:45] bread, but my father which give me the
[1:28:47] true give you the true bread from
[1:28:48] heaven. For the bread of God is he which
[1:28:51] comes down from heaven and giveth life
[1:28:54] under the world." And in verse 35, he
[1:28:56] says, "I am the bread of life."
[1:29:00] Jesus Christ is what you need to survive
[1:29:02] in this day.
[1:29:04] That's bread will not do it must be the
[1:29:06] spiritual. Hallelujah. That's right.
[1:29:08] John 6:51, he says, "I am the living
[1:29:11] bread which came down from heaven. If
[1:29:13] any man eat of this bread, he shall live
[1:29:15] forever, and the bread which I give is
[1:29:17] my flesh, which I give the life for the
[1:29:20] life of the world." Amen. That's right.
[1:29:23] Amen. Sure.
[1:29:27] Now, of course, now in Matthew 4:4, you
[1:29:30] don't have to go there, but he said unto
[1:29:31] me, "It is written, man shall not live
[1:29:32] by bread alone, but by every word which
[1:29:36] receive it out of the word of God.
[1:29:40] Now, the prophet was confused a little
[1:29:42] bit on this. If you go to harvest time
[1:29:44] 64:12, I'm sorry, 12:12, uh, number 60,
[1:29:48] he says, we be, now he's thinking about
[1:29:50] that that scripture here in John 6:46,
[1:29:53] he says, he says, I am the bread of
[1:29:54] life. He says, we thinking on this that
[1:29:56] him saying now himself, he says, I am
[1:29:59] the bread of life. How can this man be
[1:30:01] the bread of life? Now, that's what we
[1:30:03] wonder. How can he breathe? He says,
[1:30:05] "The bread of life." He said, "My body
[1:30:06] is bread." He said, "But how could this
[1:30:08] man be bread?" That's kind of strange,
[1:30:11] but don't be puzzled about it. People of
[1:30:12] this time got puzzles about it. He says,
[1:30:15] "But they didn't know how this man could
[1:30:17] ask him to be bread
[1:30:19] himself." Also in John 1, he says, "It
[1:30:22] is given us this way. In the beginning
[1:30:24] was the word. The word was with God and
[1:30:26] the word was God." Correct. Yes. Yes.
[1:30:29] Absolutely. He says, "And the word was
[1:30:31] made flesh and sw." So the word became
[1:30:33] the bread. The word and the bread
[1:30:36] here would have to be the same. He says
[1:30:40] cuz Jesus is the word and he is the
[1:30:43] bread. Now how could he be bread and
[1:30:45] word? Oh, he says it would be puzzling
[1:30:47] to the carnal mind. But we are hoping
[1:30:50] this morning there's no carnal minds
[1:30:52] among us. Amen. Amen. That there is a
[1:30:54] spiritual mind among us that we could
[1:30:56] understand what the father is trying to
[1:30:59] get us here. seeing that these words are
[1:31:01] appalling but at the same time this they
[1:31:03] are scriptural truth. He says now how
[1:31:05] can this man be bread? Yes. How can this
[1:31:08] man be flesh? He says if there is a
[1:31:13] wheat bread that we know we all must
[1:31:15] live by. Right. Sure. He says and we
[1:31:17] know that there's only one way that we
[1:31:19] can ever live. It is by taking dead
[1:31:21] substance into our body. Correct. He
[1:31:24] says we can't live any other way. Amen.
[1:31:27] And then if something had to die, we
[1:31:29] could have we could we could live
[1:31:31] physically. So that natural wheat bread
[1:31:34] had to die so we could live physically.
[1:31:35] Sure. How much more did something have
[1:31:37] to die that we could live eternally? He
[1:31:39] says take death takes it. He says to do
[1:31:43] it bread. See Jesus said I am the bread
[1:31:45] and there's a wheat bread and he wasn't
[1:31:48] that kind of bread. So there must be two
[1:31:50] kinds of lives. Yes. Yes. See, so
[1:31:52] there's a life natural life and it
[1:31:54] sustains a natural life, right? But it
[1:31:57] takes the death of the natural bread to
[1:31:58] to sustain the life of the natural life.
[1:32:01] Then of course what? Then we know that
[1:32:02] Jesus Christ is the spiritual bread that
[1:32:04] came down from heaven. Yes. So what? He
[1:32:06] must sustain the spiritual life that we
[1:32:08] have. Amen. Amen. Amen. Sure. Now glory.
[1:32:12] Moving
[1:32:13] on. John 13 21.
[1:32:19] What did this
[1:32:20] dipping of the sock mean to identify now
[1:32:26] this
[1:32:28] [Music]
[1:32:31] man John
[1:32:35] 13:1 And when Jesus had thus said he was
[1:32:38] troubled in the spirit and testified
[1:32:40] saying and said verily verily I say unto
[1:32:42] you that one of you shall betray me. He
[1:32:46] says, "Then Jesus looked one on another
[1:32:49] doubting whom he spake. Then there was
[1:32:51] one leaning on his bosom, one of his
[1:32:53] disciples, which Jesus
[1:32:55] loved." Verse 26. And Jesus answered,
[1:32:58] "It is he to whom I shall give a sop."
[1:33:01] He said, "What?" When I have dipped it,
[1:33:04] and when he had dipped the sock, he gave
[1:33:05] it to Judas Scariot, the son of Simon.
[1:33:09] And after the sop entered into him, then
[1:33:13] said Jesus, thou that thou doest do
[1:33:17] quickly. Now that word
[1:33:20] dipped in the Greek means
[1:33:23] bapt which means to be
[1:33:27] baptized.
[1:33:30] Wow. What was this? When I was sitting
[1:33:34] there in service, he pulled me out and
[1:33:35] said, "Lord, show me right in the
[1:33:37] scripture." And he showed me here in
[1:33:39] Mark 1. Go to Mark 1 verse
[1:33:44] 6. And
[1:33:46] John was clothed with camel&lt;unk&gt;s hair
[1:33:49] and with the girdle of skin about his
[1:33:51] loins and he to eat locust and honey.
[1:33:53] And preaching saying, there cometh one
[1:33:55] mightier than me whose shoe not worthy
[1:33:56] to lash sto down and loose. I indeed
[1:33:59] baptize you with water, but ye should be
[1:34:01] baptized with the Holy Ghost. And it
[1:34:03] came to pass in those days that Jesus
[1:34:04] came from Nazareth of Galilee and was
[1:34:07] baptized of John in the Jordan. The
[1:34:10] straight way cometh down out of the
[1:34:12] water, he saw the heavens open, the
[1:34:13] spirit like a dove descending upon it.
[1:34:16] Yes. Amen. Was it now? What the dipping
[1:34:20] of the sock? Now remember this was a
[1:34:22] story. This was a scene of
[1:34:25] communion, right? And now what the true
[1:34:28] bread now has come down from heaven. And
[1:34:31] what that true bread was now dipped in
[1:34:34] water and the power of the Holy Ghost
[1:34:36] came out of it which was the oil. And
[1:34:38] now we're dealing with the pure what?
[1:34:40] Mana, the pure bread of heaven, right?
[1:34:43] Amen. It was all symbolic. Remember the
[1:34:46] the mana was sent to prove when Jesus
[1:34:49] Christ came down. This this first time
[1:34:51] when he came, he was sent to prove
[1:34:53] Israel. You Pharisees and you Sadducees,
[1:34:56] you think you got the word? I'm the word
[1:34:59] right here. That's right. Amen. Yes. And
[1:35:02] it came to prove to see if they were on
[1:35:04] the scripture. Watch. And the word was
[1:35:06] sent down. It was baptized with the Holy
[1:35:08] Ghost and what? And it was given to the
[1:35:10] people to eat. That's right. Right.
[1:35:14] And they said they didn't like though it
[1:35:17] tasted of oil though had the taste of
[1:35:19] honey as well. They didn't like it. They
[1:35:22] murmured and complained. He's getting
[1:35:23] too powerful. So what? Now look,
[1:35:26] continue on here.
[1:35:30] He said, and oh wait,
[1:35:32] sorry. Hebrews 6 verse4, for it is
[1:35:37] impossible for those who were once alive
[1:35:38] and have tasted the heavenly gift and
[1:35:40] were made partakers of the Holy Ghost.
[1:35:43] What they had tasted the good
[1:35:45] word? And they had what
[1:35:48] sensation? Verse five, to taste the good
[1:35:50] word of God and the powers of the world
[1:35:52] to come. He says if they shall fall away
[1:35:55] to renew them again as a repentance
[1:35:57] scene they crucified themselves the son
[1:35:59] of God of flesh and put to an open
[1:36:00] shame.
[1:36:02] So what when Jesus Christ he grabbed the
[1:36:05] bread he ripped it he broke it and he
[1:36:07] was actually rep this was a
[1:36:09] representation of himself he was giving
[1:36:12] it to Judas to prove it right because
[1:36:15] now this wasn't just regular mana now in
[1:36:18] symbolic form this this bread was now
[1:36:21] among them right there it was god bread
[1:36:24] it was the word bread from heaven and he
[1:36:26] gave him the bread and he put it in
[1:36:27] notice and notice directly after uh uh
[1:36:31] Judas had taken the sap within Satan
[1:36:33] entered in because what the conspiracy
[1:36:36] the plan is already in the workings he
[1:36:38] was going to betray him.
[1:36:40] Sure. That's exactly what took place.
[1:36:45] Now discerning the body of the Lord 59
[1:36:49] 8:12. Look what the look what the
[1:36:50] prophet says about communion.
[1:36:55] Now our eternal
[1:36:57] destination is not altogether determined
[1:37:01] by what we
[1:37:03] see or what we
[1:37:06] hear but is determined on what
[1:37:10] discernment we have of what we see and
[1:37:14] we hear. He says Paul was not and he's
[1:37:17] dealing with communion. That communion
[1:37:18] scripture in 1 Corinthians I think it's
[1:37:20] 11. And Paul is not disputing it for
[1:37:22] taking communion. That act was right but
[1:37:24] the discernment was wrong for taking the
[1:37:26] Lord's supper is the commandment of the
[1:37:28] Lord. But to take it unworthily and not
[1:37:31] discern the body of the Lord there lays
[1:37:35] wrong. Absolutely. Now saints of God.
[1:37:38] Now what does it happen now? We see what
[1:37:40] Christ come down. He was that that that
[1:37:43] sock that was dipped. He was given to
[1:37:45] Judas and it proved him right up
[1:37:48] there. But for the last 2,000 years, the
[1:37:52] mana has been falling as well. Amen.
[1:37:55] Because why the people what the people
[1:37:57] eat thy people as
[1:38:00] bread? Go to 1 Corinthians
[1:38:03] 10:1. He says, "Moreover, brethren, I
[1:38:06] would not have that you should be
[1:38:07] ignorant. how that after all these the
[1:38:10] fathers were under the cloud. Look,
[1:38:11] look, Paul is going out to the Old
[1:38:13] Testament to Israel and how they come
[1:38:15] out and he's typing all these
[1:38:17] things. He's actually bringing forth the
[1:38:20] true meanings as looking at the Old
[1:38:22] Testament, the rituals and all these
[1:38:24] things that happened and looking how
[1:38:25] Christ came. He's looking at all these
[1:38:26] things and making the same. He says,
[1:38:28] "And they were all baptized under Moses
[1:38:30] in the cloud in the sea and were all to
[1:38:32] eat the same spiritual meat and they
[1:38:34] drank the same spiritual rock. They
[1:38:35] drank of the spiritual rock that
[1:38:36] followed him. And that rock was Christ.
[1:38:38] Right. Amen. Jump down to verse 15. And
[1:38:41] I believe I'm speaking to wise men and
[1:38:43] women today. I speak as unto a wise men.
[1:38:46] Judge even what I say. Look what Paul
[1:38:48] says. See if this ain't true. He says,
[1:38:50] the cup of blessing which we bless,
[1:38:52] isn't that the communion the blood of
[1:38:55] Christ? The bread which we break, isn't
[1:38:58] that the communion of the body of
[1:38:59] Christ? For we are being many are one
[1:39:03] bread.
[1:39:05] So for the last 2,000 years, if someone
[1:39:08] has received the Holy Ghost, they
[1:39:09] actually are now what? The bread that
[1:39:11] was sent from heaven. Amen. And what the
[1:39:15] Catholic Church and false uh uh uh
[1:39:18] religions and what slain them and eaten
[1:39:20] them up as bread? Sure. They destroyed
[1:39:23] them. Absolutely. Because what? They did
[1:39:26] not like it. Because the people the
[1:39:27] bread of heaven now was what? Sent to
[1:39:30] prove the sent to prove the world.
[1:39:32] Right. That's right. Amen. Absolutely.
[1:39:34] There was a table what in the gentile
[1:39:36] world set now and he said it and now
[1:39:38] what? They will be judged for
[1:39:41] it. He says can you drink the cup of the
[1:39:43] Lord and the cup of the devils? Ye
[1:39:45] cannot be partakers of the Lord's table
[1:39:46] and of the table of
[1:39:48] devils. Do we provoke the Lord to
[1:39:50] jealousy? Are we stronger than
[1:39:55] he? Go to Galatians
[1:40:00] 5:12.
[1:40:03] [Music]
[1:40:07] Ephesians 5:14,
[1:40:09] sorry. He says, "For all the law is
[1:40:12] fulfilled in one word, even in this,
[1:40:15] thou shalt love thy neighbor as
[1:40:17] thyself." He says, "But if ye bite and
[1:40:21] devour one another," he says, "Take heed
[1:40:24] that ye be not consumed one of another."
[1:40:28] So see how you are the bread. If you are
[1:40:30] not careful how we talk about one
[1:40:32] another and think about one another and
[1:40:34] treat one another, saints of God, you
[1:40:36] can actually
[1:40:37] devour one another completely as what?
[1:40:40] Bread. And notice if you do this to what
[1:40:43] a holy ghost person or to a seed of God,
[1:40:45] you'll be judged on
[1:40:48] it. Look how Gil brought it out. He says
[1:40:51] the illusion is to beasts of prey
[1:40:53] falling upon and devouring one another.
[1:40:57] He bite and devour one another. do this
[1:40:59] and do that. He says, "For wolves and
[1:41:01] dogs to worry sheep is not strange, but
[1:41:05] for sheep to distress one another is
[1:41:07] unnatural." If we find this in the
[1:41:10] church biting and devouring one another
[1:41:12] and and and saying this and saying that
[1:41:14] and whatever, that's not sheep nature.
[1:41:16] Amen.
[1:41:18] That's woof and dog nature, right? Amen.
[1:41:21] Amen. Absolutely. He says the apostle
[1:41:24] does not say if grievous wolves should
[1:41:26] enter in among you. He's not talking
[1:41:27] about that. He's talking right among the
[1:41:29] church people. Absolutely. Those that
[1:41:31] are the bread of life. Amen. He
[1:41:35] says, he says the apostle said, "If
[1:41:37] grievous wolves would enter in among you
[1:41:39] and spare not the flock, but suggest
[1:41:41] that they themselves should act the part
[1:41:43] of the wolves one to another."
[1:41:45] You see, so you're not a sheep within
[1:41:48] sheep's clothing and yet acting like a
[1:41:50] wolf. Sheep do not buy or tear one
[1:41:52] another. They buy or tear the grass and
[1:41:54] the and the things of the field there
[1:41:56] that they eat and all these things. They
[1:41:58] don't fight one another. Sure.
[1:42:00] Do that. That's the nature of that. For
[1:42:02] the nature of a sheep, let us eat clean
[1:42:04] things, pure things. Absolutely. Amen.
[1:42:06] Amen. Sure. Saints of God, you are the
[1:42:10] bread of life. Now, why? Because
[1:42:11] remember in Matthew 25, the third
[1:42:15] parable at the great white judgment
[1:42:18] throne, the general resurrection there
[1:42:20] at the end. Yes.
[1:42:22] Every single person is judged on how
[1:42:26] they handled the bread of God.
[1:42:30] Good, good, good, beautiful. Did they
[1:42:33] take care of that bread or they did they
[1:42:35] just throw it away and cast aside and
[1:42:37] like nothing? Beautiful. Beautiful.
[1:42:40] Right. Why? Because you are the bread of
[1:42:45] Jesus Christ. That's right. Amen. Yes.
[1:42:48] Says be done unto them, be done to me.
[1:42:50] Why? because he was the oil that's in
[1:42:51] this bread. Absolutely. Amen. That's
[1:42:53] right. Right. Wonderful. Wonderful.
[1:42:55] That's right. Now, Amen. Not much longer
[1:42:58] here by God's grace.
[1:43:04] Now,
[1:43:09] see, harvest time 64
[1:43:12] 12:12 204. He says, "The the word bread
[1:43:15] always means to be fed on.
[1:43:19] The man shall not live by every bread by
[1:43:21] bread live by bread but but like this
[1:43:24] bread alone but by every word. So that's
[1:43:26] the word bread. Keep that in mind. This
[1:43:29] is that bread that the church of every
[1:43:31] age has fed on. He has been the hidden
[1:43:34] mana just for the owner overcomer only.
[1:43:38] Revelation said so. Now I don't have
[1:43:40] time to break the whole thing down
[1:43:42] because I probably got another 30
[1:43:43] minutes. He said look how you bring
[1:43:44] that. He says, "And then the holy the
[1:43:46] holy mana fell from heaven which was the
[1:43:48] type of the holy grace ghost." He says,
[1:43:50] "You agree on that?" Yes. God told Moses
[1:43:53] to go out and get an overflow and put in
[1:43:55] the holies of holies because if they
[1:43:56] didn't they put in the holy of holies,
[1:43:58] it becomes stagnant.
[1:44:01] So saints of God, we just we just can't
[1:44:03] just not read our Bibles and listen to
[1:44:04] these not listen to tapes and these
[1:44:06] things. It becomes stagnant. We have to
[1:44:08] actually get it within us. Amen. Not
[1:44:10] only that, saints of God, we have to
[1:44:12] live. Amen. When I go on the job site,
[1:44:14] I'm talking more and more about Jesus
[1:44:16] Christ. Amen. At the end, every when I
[1:44:19] leave at the end of the work, I say,
[1:44:20] "God bless you. God bless you. God bless
[1:44:22] you." And I'm say, "Well, you too."
[1:44:25] Okay. Praise the Lord. Or whatever. You
[1:44:26] know how he say. He says, "Now he says,
[1:44:28] now God put or Moses told him to put an
[1:44:30] full of it in the holiest of holies
[1:44:32] because if you didn't put in the holy of
[1:44:33] holies, it become stagnant." Is that
[1:44:34] right? The worms got into it. Now he
[1:44:36] said now putting the holies of holies in
[1:44:38] his own order that every generation
[1:44:40] coming up after that priesthood when a
[1:44:43] man comes up to be a priest to minister
[1:44:45] the word the first thing he gets to do
[1:44:48] after he's ordained is is go in and get
[1:44:50] a handful that really original mana and
[1:44:54] eat it. Absolutely. And saints of God,
[1:44:56] we are what? Kings and priests and
[1:45:00] saints of God to go in there and feed
[1:45:03] our children. the ones that are going to
[1:45:06] raise up so what they can continue on
[1:45:08] and bring forth another lineage one of
[1:45:10] kings and priests not grandchildren or
[1:45:12] or this or that but what it must be
[1:45:14] children of God absolutely yes amen
[1:45:18] amen
[1:45:21] now last quote here by God's
[1:45:25] grace since this word Philadelphia
[1:45:28] church age book chapter 4 since this
[1:45:31] word indeed expresses perfect
[1:45:32] realization as against the idea of
[1:45:34] partial revelation as illustrated in
[1:45:36] these verses. Now we can understand as
[1:45:40] never before anti-ype cr with type and
[1:45:44] substance with shadow. Take the example
[1:45:47] now of mana from heaven. God sent down
[1:45:50] angel bread from heaven for Israel. For
[1:45:52] that bread did not satisfy. It was only
[1:45:55] good for a day. Amen. Those who ate it
[1:45:58] were hungry again the next day. It was
[1:46:00] left around and become contaminated. But
[1:46:02] Jesus is the true bread. Yes. This is
[1:46:04] from heaven where whereof mana was just
[1:46:06] a type. And if any man eats of that
[1:46:09] bread that came from heaven, he will
[1:46:10] never hunger again. He does not need to
[1:46:13] come back and eat again. The moment he
[1:46:15] ptook, he had eternal life. Amen. He
[1:46:19] says here in
[1:46:21] reality, no need no longer for a shadow.
[1:46:24] No need for partial salvation. Here's
[1:46:26] the whole of it. Just take Jesus. Just
[1:46:29] like Jesus isn't part of God, he is all
[1:46:31] of God. That's why we must take every
[1:46:34] single word of God and consume it within
[1:46:37] our bodies. Take every quote we can
[1:46:40] find, run it through our filter, the
[1:46:42] Bible, and then consume every everything
[1:46:44] that runs through. Amen. Amen. Amen.
[1:46:47] Yes. Rise up. I got
[1:46:51] simple thought. Absolutely. Praise God.
[1:46:53] Praise God. All right. real quick. Uh we
[1:46:56] got a different whole different thought
[1:46:58] for tonight by God's grace. So let's say
[1:47:00] a word of prayer.
[1:47:02] Dear heavenly father Lord Jesus, Lord,
[1:47:05] we just love you, Lord. And Lord, we
[1:47:07] know you're the true bread that came to
[1:47:08] heaven. Yes. Lord God, you came down,
[1:47:10] Lord, and you were crushed and beaten,
[1:47:13] Lord, and broken for us, Lord, so that
[1:47:15] the oil could come forth, Lord, in the
[1:47:16] Holy Ghost, Lord, and come into these,
[1:47:19] Lord, leaven bread, God,
[1:47:21] Lord. And Lord Jesus,
[1:47:23] Lord, you made our souls, God, just as
[1:47:26] pure as pure could be, Lord, to where
[1:47:28] the Bible says no sin in us, Lord God.
[1:47:30] Yes, Lord. Lord, it's all pure, God.
[1:47:32] Lord, Lord Jesus, we just love you,
[1:47:35] Lord. Each one of us, Lord, continue to
[1:47:37] Lord, to examine ourselves, examine our
[1:47:39] lives,
[1:47:40] God. Lord Jesus, Lord, we can be the
[1:47:43] perfect bread, God, just like you are
[1:47:45] the bread, God. Lord, where Christ will
[1:47:47] come down one more time, Lord, and be
[1:47:49] carnated in flesh, Lord. this bread once
[1:47:51] again, God. Lord, Lord Jesus, you'll be
[1:47:53] tasted, Lord, in this last move of the
[1:47:56] Holy Ghost, God, you'll be tasted, Lord
[1:47:58] Jesus, Lord, and Lord, they some people
[1:48:00] will hate the taste, God. Others will
[1:48:02] rejoice in it, Lord God, and and uh help
[1:48:04] us out, Lord. And some will cast us
[1:48:06] aside, Lord. However, you Lord, you know
[1:48:09] how it's going to happen, Lord. We just
[1:48:11] pray this was a little encouragement
[1:48:13] Lord God. a little opening Lord maybe
[1:48:15] the eyes Lord to see Lord the dipping of
[1:48:17] the sock God Lord what it represented
[1:48:19] God Lord how Lord how how it will work
[1:48:22] there God in communion Lord Jesus and
[1:48:24] how sacred communion is Lord Jesus we
[1:48:27] must take it Lord God ever so uh
[1:48:29] sincerely Lord Jesus Lord may we
[1:48:31] wouldn't have any problems with one
[1:48:33] another God Lord or with you Lord
[1:48:34] especially Lord God and Lord we treat
[1:48:36] each one with love Lord divine love we
[1:48:39] love you Lord bless the people for
[1:48:40] coming out and pushing their way God we
[1:48:42] ask these things in the name of Jesus
[1:48:43] Christ. Amen. Amen. Amen. Saints of God,
[1:48:47] I know it was simple. I just hope it was
[1:48:49] a little opening a little more of the
[1:48:50] word by God's grace. Yes. To me, I
[1:48:53] wondered that for so long what that
[1:48:55] dipping of the sock meant. But here,
[1:48:58] say, saints of God, it was just so
[1:48:59] simple. It was just the bread from
[1:49:01] heaven come down. And it was just as a
[1:49:04] testing bread. Yes.
[1:49:08] Many people we know have come and said,
[1:49:10] I want the truth. They prayed for truth
[1:49:12] and God has actually sent us to them.
[1:49:14] Yes. But once they tasted the
[1:49:17] bread, they go away. There's one time we
[1:49:20] were in Florida, Ohio. A sister a sister
[1:49:24] woman preacher down from Kentucky. She
[1:49:27] was had her own church. She's a minister
[1:49:28] and she was preaching and she was
[1:49:30] preaching about vast eye and Esther and
[1:49:32] she says, "God, I'm not no vast eye."
[1:49:34] And God gave her a
[1:49:37] dream. Said, "You're not a vast eye.
[1:49:40] You're an Esther.
[1:49:41] She says, "Yes, Lord." He goes, "Go up,
[1:49:43] drive all the way to Florida, Ohio, and
[1:49:46] find a black minister there. He's
[1:49:48] holding a house church." Wow. Go hear
[1:49:51] that word. And who? Her and two other
[1:49:53] women preachers. They drove all the way
[1:49:56] up on a
[1:49:57] Saturday from Kentucky. They had never
[1:50:00] even heard of Florida, Ohio. It's just a
[1:50:03] little town. Wow. And the young group
[1:50:04] was having a revival there.
[1:50:07] Wow. And it's not they don't even have a
[1:50:10] gas station that town. It's an in
[1:50:12] between town between defiance and
[1:50:14] Napoleon. It's a little cutth through
[1:50:16] town there you drive through. And they
[1:50:18] end up they drive all morning go to
[1:50:21] Florida,
[1:50:22] Ohio. And they said, "Where where we're
[1:50:24] where Esters? Where Eers?" They go to
[1:50:26] the one little carry out. They had a
[1:50:28] little place for food and fried chicken.
[1:50:29] Another place. And they go knocking on
[1:50:32] there. Went in said, "Hey, is there any
[1:50:34] churches around here?" "Yeah, there's a
[1:50:35] church over here. There's a church over
[1:50:36] there." They said, "Is there a black
[1:50:38] minister though?" They said, "No,
[1:50:39] there's no church here." And a brother
[1:50:42] from our little group, Brother Daniel
[1:50:44] Booer, went in to grab some lunch that
[1:50:47] day, right? And he overheard them
[1:50:49] talking.
[1:50:52] Said, "Oh, wait. What are you talking
[1:50:53] about?" "Yeah, we had a dream that
[1:50:56] there's a black minister up here to
[1:50:57] bring the
[1:50:58] word." And brother Daniel starts smiling
[1:51:01] big grizzly smile.
[1:51:06] He said, "I know where that's at. It's
[1:51:08] just right across right over in this
[1:51:09] house church over here." She said,
[1:51:11] "Well, thank you. We'll be showing up
[1:51:12] tonight."
[1:51:16] They showed up. Brother Brooks preached
[1:51:18] and preached and preached and they were
[1:51:20] blown away. They had brother Brooks come
[1:51:22] down and minister at her church. Come
[1:51:24] down
[1:51:26] there. Brother Brooks and Brother Craig
[1:51:29] and introduced the message to
[1:51:32] them. And the last thing they heard was
[1:51:34] their
[1:51:35] Someone b from their denomination was
[1:51:37] going to honor her and she turned the
[1:51:38] message down. My goodness. See, saints
[1:51:42] of God, you are that bread. Yes. See,
[1:51:46] I'm this. I'm that. Taste this bread one
[1:51:49] time. Taste this word. Be around these
[1:51:53] people. See the way they talk. See the
[1:51:56] way they dress. See the way they act.
[1:51:59] And see if you line up. You are now the
[1:52:02] standard. You are the testing ground
[1:52:05] now. Yes, Lord. Everything is judged by
[1:52:08] you. Not to lift ourselves up, right?
[1:52:11] But to understand how
[1:52:14] sincere and how real you guys are. Yes.
[1:52:17] Amen.
[1:52:19] Jess was all right. God bless you.
[1:52:22] Praise God. Praise God.
[1:52:29] to be like Jesus.
[1:52:36] to be
[1:52:38] [Music]
[1:52:44] [Applause]
[1:52:49] thy
[1:52:56] [Music]
[1:52:59] [Applause]
[1:53:03] be from
[1:53:09] [Music]
[1:53:17] Earth
[1:53:21] [Music]
[1:53:23] to thank for the word of God today.
[1:53:25] Let's give the Lord a round of applause.
[1:53:34] the feeling. Who has a better feeling
[1:53:37] than the bride who knows she's forgiven?
[1:53:40] Knows that she's washed in the waters of
[1:53:42] the world. Amen. You How do you do that?
[1:53:45] You taste and see that the Lord is good.
[1:53:46] You take on this word. Then you
[1:53:48] experience You taste that feeling, don't
[1:53:50] you? Oh, let's give the Lord a round of
[1:53:53] applause.
[1:53:58] that dream
[1:54:06] about more
[1:54:08] deep. Unreal. I remember when that
[1:54:10] happened.
[1:54:19] No, you know Christ is the unleaven
[1:54:21] bread. How many know that? But there's a
[1:54:22] quote brother has off to get up for the
[1:54:24] evening. Brother, brother said there
[1:54:26] will come a time when the bride has no
[1:54:27] leaven among her.
[1:54:30] Praise God. All the sin will be out of
[1:54:32] the bride.
[1:54:34] Makes illusion to that's when the
[1:54:36] rapture will come and all he said when
[1:54:39] all the leavenvens out it brings the
[1:54:41] fullness of Christ.
[1:54:44] And that's just like the book of Acts.
[1:54:45] They had all those sins out, right?
[1:54:46] Peter saw Ananas and Zirus sin. They had
[1:54:50] a pure church. There was no 11. And
[1:54:53] church, I don't care if God's got to get
[1:54:54] down our church down to just a few
[1:54:56] more. As long as 11's out, we're right
[1:54:59] where we need to be by God's grace
[1:55:00] because you now the body of Christ
[1:55:02] becomes the bread to the world. Amen.
[1:55:06] That's just humbling to know that Christ
[1:55:08] makes us the unleavened bread and that
[1:55:11] people how people treat us will
[1:55:14] determine their
[1:55:15] destinations. God, help us to be
[1:55:17] unleavened. Praise
[1:55:19] God. Fill my cup, Lord. Let's look at it
[1:55:22] at this as we sing bread of heaven. Feed
[1:55:23] me to I want to know. Aren't you glad
[1:55:24] for the bread from heaven? See, one way
[1:55:27] you're the bread, but also you're
[1:55:28] receiving the bread.
[1:55:30] See, just like the prophets, they had to
[1:55:32] be symbols, right? Ezekiel had got to be
[1:55:34] a symbol. Had to lay on the side. Isaiah
[1:55:36] had to do this and that. Yet, they still
[1:55:39] received from God, didn't they? Right?
[1:55:41] So, it is us. We must receive from God
[1:55:43] this word being preached to us. And yet,
[1:55:45] we are a symbol of the bread of life.
[1:55:49] Thank God for his mercy.
[1:55:51] Fill my cup.
[1:55:54] [Music]

[1:57:05] me thankful for God's word today. Amen.
[1:57:09] So thankful for the word of God, you
[1:57:10] know, it means so much to us.
[1:57:13] to hear the truth. We appreciate our
[1:57:14] brother labor in there. The word of God
[1:57:17] appreciate the the grace that God has on
[1:57:20] us. Amen. To keep standing for the word
[1:57:23] to enjoy this word then we are the word.
[1:57:27] We are the bread. Humbling very humbling
[1:57:31] thought. We have to be ready to be
[1:57:33] received or devoured. Is that right?
[1:57:35] That's what the Bible said. Either
[1:57:37] received or devoured and thrown out. Got
[1:57:40] to be ready to
[1:57:42] Just be the bread, the unleavened
[1:57:44] witness, the unleavened
[1:57:46] testimony. No sin among you brings the
[1:57:49] fullness of Christ. No leaven among
[1:57:54] you. Sing a song. Pleasing. Let me be
[1:57:57] pleasing to you.
[1:58:05] Let me
[1:58:09] bring to you.
[1:58:16] Everything I
[1:58:18] do for

[1:59:27] Pray I
[1:59:35] receive the Lord.
[1:59:50] I believe as we confess our sins and
[1:59:52] walk in the light. I believe we're
[1:59:54] pleasing to him. Amen. Because the Bible
[1:59:56] said we confess our sins and we have
[1:59:58] fellowship with him and the blood of
[2:00:01] Jesus Christ cleanses us
[2:00:03] all. What a promise. What a promise.
[2:00:07] Let's see what we saw here as we close
[2:00:08] here by God's grace. Let's see the
[2:00:10] windows of heaven, but let's make it the
[2:00:12] doors of heaven or the door of heaven is
[2:00:13] open. Let me see that. Not sure where we
[2:00:16] going get from. I'll leave that up in
[2:00:17] the scripture. Let's say the door of
[2:00:20] heaven is open. Let's see
[2:00:22] that the door of heaven is open.
[2:00:28] The blessings are
[2:00:31] all the
[2:00:34] joy in my soul for Jesus everything.
[2:00:42] I hope your
[2:00:45] army

[2:01:03] opened. The blessings are

[2:01:23] [Applause]
[2:01:33] every time heaven the door of heaven is
[2:01:41] The blessings are coming
[2:01:44] tonight. There's
[2:01:47] joy in my soul for Jesus.
[2:01:55] I live in my
[2:01:58] [Music]
[2:02:03] garden. I'm singing a man
[2:02:09] for
[2:02:17] tonight. I preached on the the hidden
[2:02:20] man of the last two services by God's
[2:02:22] grace. So, how many know that?
[2:02:25] So, it all tied in. Aren't you glad it
[2:02:26] all ties in? God knows exactly what we
[2:02:29] need to hear, but we need to hear it.
[2:02:31] Praise God. Amen. Let's close with this
[2:02:34] song. Let's just bow our heads here.
[2:02:35] Make me more like you. Let's just, you
[2:02:37] know, he's the bread and we want to be
[2:02:39] totally like him. We want to be fully
[2:02:41] unleven
[2:02:43] bread. Heavenly Father, Lord, we're
[2:02:45] grateful, Lord, again, for this word.
[2:02:46] Thank you for sending our brother to
[2:02:48] preach that. And we look forward to
[2:02:49] tonight's message as well, Lord God.
[2:02:52] make us more like you.
[2:02:54] Lord, we realize there's a great
[2:02:56] responsibility with communion with and
[2:03:00] then Lord being the spiritual bread to
[2:03:02] the
[2:03:02] world. What a beautiful thought. I'm
[2:03:06] reminded Lord of Gideon how I preached
[2:03:08] that a few years
[2:03:09] ago that bread he saw a dream before he
[2:03:12] defeated the Midionites and the bread
[2:03:14] was rolling down the hill and it smashed
[2:03:16] all the tents of the Midionites and what
[2:03:19] a type that is of the body of Christ.
[2:03:22] getting more and more momentum and
[2:03:24] coming down to the enemy's
[2:03:26] camp and spoiling the enemy's camp.
[2:03:29] Amen. The power in the bread, the power
[2:03:32] in the body of Christ, the momentum,
[2:03:34] Lord, is picking up, Lord. We don't look
[2:03:36] at numbers that tell us that. We look at
[2:03:38] our walk with Christ. We're getting
[2:03:40] closer. We're falling more in love with
[2:03:42] you, Lord. We see the momentum. It's
[2:03:44] picking up, Lord, in our lives, Lord.
[2:03:47] Others might fall and rise and lane Lord
[2:03:51] God but our lives Lord by your
[2:03:54] grace increasing with the love of God
[2:03:56] the power of God the character of Christ
[2:03:59] Lord let the momentum in our spiritual
[2:04:01] lives continue as we are the bread Lord
[2:04:05] God. Thank you Lord for that Jesus.
[2:04:08] Father let us leave here grateful Lord
[2:04:10] with a desire to be more like you Lord
[2:04:13] God.
[2:04:16] we can taste the
[2:04:17] feeling of being a real Christian this
[2:04:20] hour. Lord
[2:04:21] God, thank you Lord God. Bless your
[2:04:24] children, Lord, as we go and as we go
[2:04:27] about our day, Lord. Guide us for
[2:04:29] tonight or those who will see Wednesday
[2:04:31] or next Sunday. Lord, just guide each
[2:04:33] and every heart and soul. Be with us,
[2:04:35] Lord. And may we be with you, Lord God,
[2:04:38] in Jesus Christ. Everybody said, "God
[2:04:41] bless you." We're listening now. You're
[2:04:42] dismissed. Make me more like thee.
[2:04:44] Praise God.
