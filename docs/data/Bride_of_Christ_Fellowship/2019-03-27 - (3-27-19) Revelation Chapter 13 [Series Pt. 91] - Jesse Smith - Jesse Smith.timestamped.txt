[27:58] [Music]
[28:19] [Music]

[28:35] good time we're going to have over there
[28:36] with no devil amen
[28:40] pardon me yes sir okay he made to be
[28:44] seated here like yes sir praise the Lord
[28:47] all right brother praise the Lord
[28:51] wonderful brother yes sir God makes
[29:17] themself so simple so ordinary plain
[29:20] outstandingly ridiculous too full man's
[29:23] built brilliant brain Tyson salt and
[29:26] flowers or any drop of rain maeín
[29:30] scientific knowledge just missed the
[29:32] mark again the gospel seems so foolish
[29:35] it's preaching so insane to modern man's
[29:38] intelligence just goes against the grain
[29:40] God tests his man by his word the gospel
[29:44] to proclaim greatness and simplicity
[29:49] God's wisdom it contains so if you look
[29:54] for wisdom fair words to entertain
[29:57] overdone
[29:58] whistle philosophy means wisdom to
[30:01] obtain a living blade of grass man's
[30:04] wisdom can't explain God's height and
[30:07] simplicity reason fills himself the same
[30:10] and he put by inspiration of my Lord
[30:14] Jesus Christ amen
[30:16] franksen all our beautiful beautiful
[30:34] [Laughter]
[30:37] rays God amen praise the Lord

[30:52] save you didn't remember you can always
[30:53] tell us after service I know you that's
[30:55] how I am if I forget I'm remember right
[30:57] for service praise God we appreciate
[31:00] that brother God is in simplicity amen
[31:02] let's say on our feet here we'll get
[31:03] right in the word of God's here let's go
[31:05] to Revelation chapter 13 like to look at
[31:08] back of this revelation series tonight I
[31:10] was kind of seeking the Lord this
[31:12] morning and thought I should go this
[31:15] direction here tonight by God's grace
[31:19] Revelation chapter 13 I think we're just
[31:22] lord willing just read verses 1 and 2 I
[31:27] think that's about as far as I'd like to
[31:29] get yeah I think I'd like to just get
[31:32] there because that deals with Imperial
[31:34] Rome if you know brother Rams message or
[31:37] studied it real thoroughly you'll find
[31:39] verses 1 and 2 is Imperial Rome and then
[31:43] 3 down to 10 is pagan papal Rome so I
[31:51] wanted to look at Imperial pagan Rome
[31:53] tonight by God's grace let me love the
[31:57] Lord tonight you know it'll be connected
[31:59] to our live search I promise you know by
[32:01] God's grace it always is you know we if
[32:04] we look hard enough it always is like
[32:06] our brother just read God's always in
[32:08] simplicity praise God revelations
[32:11] after 13 verse 1 & 2 which one's shorter
[32:16] all right i'll read verse 1 that we'll
[32:18] all read verse 2 together and i stood
[32:21] upon the sand of the sea and saw a beast
[32:23] rise up out of the sea having seven
[32:25] heads and ten horns and upon his horns
[32:29] ten crowns and upon his heads the name
[32:32] of blasphemy what an ugly creature verse
[32:36] two
[32:36] let's Rita on three ready one two three
[32:39] and the Beast which I saw was like unto
[32:42] a leopard and his feet were as the feet
[32:45] of a bear and his mouth as the mouth of
[32:48] a lion and the dragon gave him his power
[32:50] and his seat and great Authority amen
[32:54] let's have one more word of Prayer if
[32:56] you just bow your heads and word of
[32:57] Prayer if everything on your heart just
[32:58] making known unto God surely the God of
[33:01] all creation the God of the universe is
[33:03] here tonight by his Spirit and he like
[33:05] to meet the needs of his children father
[33:07] we just bow our heads we come reverently
[33:08] Lord God and we asked Lord that your
[33:10] Holy Spirit would speak to us thank you
[33:12] for the songs thank you for this poem
[33:14] Lord God reminding us of how simple Lord
[33:17] you are and how how close you are to
[33:20] each one of us as the book of Acts says
[33:22] as well Lord God that we might feel
[33:25] after you and look for your Lord God we
[33:27] ask that your Holy Spirit will speak to
[33:29] us through the Word of God take my
[33:30] thoughts Lord God and get rid of those
[33:33] and let let your thoughts be placed in
[33:35] my thoughts Lord God and I just asked
[33:37] that Lord Lord we'd all get in your
[33:39] spirit Lord God and we'd all be drawn
[33:41] into a lord God that our lives might be
[33:43] changed improve Lord God cleaned out
[33:47] father whatever is we have need of
[33:48] tonight Lord God give us what we have
[33:50] need of for your glory in Jesus Christ
[33:53] name the church said amen god bless you
[33:55] being seated praise the Lord well we're
[33:59] happy to have our visitor here brother
[34:01] Aaron's dad what's your name sir
[34:02] let's give Dave round Fog god bless you
[34:04] sir are a lot of good things about you
[34:07] sir that's what I'd say too if people
[34:13] say that about me god bless you nice to
[34:16] have you here tonight by the grace of
[34:17] the Lord so let's look at our Revelation
[34:20] chapter 13 you can switch over lady I do
[34:21] have some quotes on kind of
[34:23] paired you know as I was you know
[34:25] studying him praying this morning you
[34:27] know early think I was up about 450 this
[34:29] morning preparing I just had these
[34:32] different thoughts coming to me that I
[34:33] hadn't come to me for a little bit so I
[34:34] like to look at some quotes and some
[34:38] thoughts here about verses 1 & 2 so I
[34:42] believe this is part 1 yeah this part
[34:43] I'm sorry part 91 in the series here on
[34:45] book of Revelation and I did find a
[34:47] quote recently where brother Branham
[34:49] said he just he said he took a year and
[34:51] a half one time and preached every verse
[34:53] to his church in the book of Revelation
[34:56] maybe I can pull it up real quick if I
[34:57] could find it a year he said and a half
[35:01] I thought I'd saved it don't you just
[35:08] give me a moment me I thought I'd saved
[35:13] it on my document here but maybe not all
[35:15] right well I'll have to look it up later
[35:17] but I know he said he preached a year
[35:20] and a half straight just on the book of
[35:21] Revelation praise God and so we're
[35:24] getting there by the grace of God
[35:26] so let's look here now I'm gonna be
[35:29] preaching a little bit off the notes of
[35:31] the script that I wrote for the YouTube
[35:33] videos here that are been on YouTube and
[35:37] I wish I could do it but I got a message
[35:39] from a sister from a oneness Church and
[35:46] she was crying on the voicemail thanking
[35:48] me for all my YouTube video she said
[35:50] they came to her at such a difficult
[35:52] time her life she was single didn't know
[35:54] leaving three God's you know three
[35:56] persons then she said she lived off my
[35:58] youtube channel for a few years until
[36:00] she found her husband as now she said
[36:02] she's so happy she leave God's one she's
[36:04] baptized the name of Jesus Christ and
[36:06] that was just such an encouragement to
[36:08] me that God had placed those there for
[36:11] such a time as that and so we're
[36:14] thankful to that by God's grace but
[36:16] these notes like I said I'll be coming
[36:18] off this script that I wrote feeling led
[36:21] of the Holy Spirit I'd like to look at
[36:23] these symbols now in verses 1 & 2 let's
[36:26] look at the symbols and see how they're
[36:28] defined by the Holy Spirit now brother
[36:31] Branham tells us plainly
[36:32] that revelation 13:1 and 2 was Imperial
[36:36] in Rome so the tie I'll read that again
[36:41] and I sit upon the sand of the sea and I
[36:43] saw a beast rise up out of the sea
[36:45] having seven heads and ten horns and
[36:49] upon his horns ten crowns and upon his
[36:52] heads the name of blasphemy and the
[36:54] Beast which I saw was like unto a
[36:56] leopard and his feet were as the feet of
[36:58] a bear and his mouth as the mouth of a
[37:00] lion and the dragon gave him his power
[37:02] and his seat and his great Authority so
[37:07] the timing of this is Imperial Rome now
[37:11] the Empire really started to flourish
[37:13] about 27 BC if you study history which
[37:19] was not long after the fall the Grecian
[37:22] Empire which was around 323 BC and of
[37:26] course I got those dates from Botanica
[37:28] but you can find them in any history
[37:30] book if you read history at all now
[37:33] remember this Roman Empire so these legs
[37:36] of iron which we'll get to in a moment
[37:38] stood for quite a few years you know all
[37:41] the way up to the fifth century AD so
[37:47] almost 500 years these iron legs
[37:50] well stood there so here's the picture
[37:55] again I don't mean to scare the children
[37:57] hopefully it's not too scary so children
[37:58] if it's scary quickly close your eyes
[38:00] but there's a beast that comes out and I
[38:03] like I just like how the the artists
[38:05] placed this because it's pretty close to
[38:08] Scripture the Bible describes all these
[38:11] animal different animal parts all
[38:13] gathered into one and this is the beast
[38:16] out of the sea now let's look first at a
[38:21] beast
[38:22] what a beast represents according to the
[38:24] Bible so a beast in the Bible is a
[38:27] kingdom we know that because of what
[38:30] Daniel 7:23 says the Bible said thus he
[38:34] said the fourth beast shall be the
[38:36] fourth Kingdom so beasts our kingdom of
[38:40] men upon the earth which shall be
[38:44] diverse from all kingdoms and shall
[38:46] devour the whole earth and shall tread
[38:48] it down and break it in
[38:50] pieces now we know this is the fourth
[38:53] Kingdom or the fourth beast we'd say and
[38:57] it's Rome and the church said program
[39:01] said thus saith the Lord he said it will
[39:03] not be Russia that rules the world
[39:05] it'll be Rome thus saith the Lord so we
[39:09] don't have to wonder who this fourth
[39:10] beast is we know it's Rome now the sea
[39:15] so the Beast is a kingdom that's what
[39:18] these symbols represent the sea
[39:20] represents multitudes of people so a
[39:23] beast is going to rise above the sea
[39:25] which means a kingdom is going to rise
[39:28] up out of a large group of people and so
[39:32] this is found in Revelation 1715 and he
[39:34] saith unto me the waters which thou
[39:36] sawest where the sitteth are
[39:38] people's multitudes nations and tongues
[39:43] praise God now I was looking this week
[39:46] at some of my notes and I remember that
[39:47] I found that there are over 22,000
[39:52] Catholic parishes in the world and
[39:55] there's 1.3 billion Catholics in the
[39:59] world at least they can be counted which
[40:02] is 22 percent of the world's population
[40:05] so over a fifth of the people on this
[40:08] world are claiming to be Catholic right
[40:12] and then about another fifth of those
[40:14] are claiming to be Muslim so we can
[40:19] clearly see that Rome sits upon many
[40:21] waters and almost every nation receives
[40:24] diplomats from the Vatican almost every
[40:28] nation and so the only Kingdom that fits
[40:32] all the qualifications of Revelation 13
[40:35] 17 and 18 is the kingdom of Rome and so
[40:41] the beasts or man kingdom rises up out
[40:45] of many waters here in Revelation 13 1
[40:49] and 2 so a beast out of the sea then
[40:53] represents that this beast was pagan
[40:56] Roman kingdom with the combined demon
[41:00] powers of the first three Gentile
[41:03] kingdoms
[41:04] all right so we looked at this not long
[41:09] ago but I get to guess we get to it soon
[41:12] here now the seven heads representing
[41:15] the seven mountains of ancient Rome the
[41:18] Bible said the seven heads are seven
[41:20] mountains on which the woman sitteth
[41:24] the ten horns represent ten earthly
[41:27] kings now these kings are future kings
[41:30] the Bible tells us that revelation 17
[41:33] the ten horns which thou sawest are ten
[41:35] Kings which have received no Kingdom as
[41:38] of yet so see the Bible proclaim plainly
[41:40] teaches that they have not received a
[41:42] kingdom but receive King power as kings
[41:45] one hour with the Beast so it's very
[41:49] striking that God gives this symbol of
[41:52] the beasts having ten heads that haven't
[41:54] even happened yet
[41:55] their future kings that will rule with
[41:59] the beasts for an hour my one hour right
[42:04] verse thirteen these have one mind and
[42:07] shall give their power and strength unto
[42:09] the Beast and the ten horns which thou
[42:14] sawest upon the Beast these shall hate
[42:16] the and shall make her desolate
[42:18] and naked and shall eat her flesh and
[42:21] burn her with fire my boy this is some
[42:25] rough preaching here tonight not against
[42:28] the rod but against that false church
[42:30] shame in his the brides he's washed
[42:33] she's washed in the blood of God's own
[42:35] son amen
[42:37] that's right verse 17 of chapter 17 for
[42:41] God hath put in their hearts to fulfill
[42:43] his will and to agree and give their
[42:45] Kingdom unto the Beast so they have
[42:49] their own human kingdoms and they're
[42:52] gonna give that power unto the Beast the
[42:54] Antichrist until the words of God shall
[42:58] be fulfilled praise God
[43:00] now I want to show you here the prophets
[43:03] revelation of this so you have a good
[43:05] understanding that this is all
[43:08] scriptural here look brother
[43:11] says in 1954 he says we've got two
[43:14] things under consideration now watch
[43:17] this beast it had four different
[43:19] characters in it if you'll take Daniel
[43:21] seven you who are marking it down Daniel
[43:23] 7 Daniel saw the same vision eight
[43:27] hundred years before this saw the vision
[43:29] he saw those beasts separate from one
[43:32] another in the beginning of the Gentile
[43:35] ruling so Daniel saw the separate bear
[43:37] the separate leopard a separate lion and
[43:40] then he said then they were all separate
[43:42] Daniel but here revelation 13 we we see
[43:46] them all united he said here they are
[43:50] John sing it at the end of the Gentile
[43:53] ruling all four of those beasts
[43:56] represented in one what does it mean by
[43:59] the Branum he said there's the same old
[44:02] Devils amen
[44:05] so what does the bear represent what
[44:07] does the leopard represent what is the
[44:09] line represent those represent Devils in
[44:12] human kingdoms race God demons that
[44:16] possess each Kingdom of the Romans down
[44:20] through Greeks and so forth on down
[44:22] through the Gentile dispensation has
[44:24] come right down and all met up in one
[44:28] beast and the church said Omaha Church
[44:32] dang the Book of Daniel used to be a
[44:34] great mystery to me
[44:35] the book of Revelation used to be a
[44:36] total mystery but once God opened up
[44:39] this message showed me the message
[44:40] showed us the message and gave us all
[44:43] these understanding Church we can look
[44:45] at the Bible and we can completely
[44:47] understand the Bible it's not it's not a
[44:50] mysterious book in that aspect anymore
[44:52] all these symbols have been interpreted
[44:54] and given to us that we might know the
[44:57] day an hour that we're living amen
[44:59] hallelujah and once we know the day in
[45:02] our living that we can live our
[45:04] Christian ought to live hallelujah amen
[45:07] and that you and I might go fight
[45:09] against that beast praise God not be
[45:12] conquered by the beasts but fight
[45:14] against the beasts amen hallelujah and
[45:19] how does it happen Church one soul at a
[45:21] time praise God
[45:23] one sword
[45:26] how we overcome amen
[45:30] now I jumped Boyd got real fast through
[45:32] my notes here I didn't think I was gonna
[45:33] get that through that vas so just a
[45:35] minute
[45:37] yeah let me go back to this and then
[45:39] we'll head back to the quotes now here's
[45:40] the picture I was speaking out I think I
[45:42] showed it last week to the line
[45:44] represented Babylonian época desert the
[45:48] bear represent the Medes of Persians now
[45:50] this was like the shortest kingdom that
[45:53] Medes a Persians took over Belshazzar we
[45:55] know that Daniel chapter 5 the sixth
[45:58] verse well which gets you a little bit
[46:00] the leopard represents the ancient
[46:02] Greeks and Alexander the Great and then
[46:05] the last one we don't know exactly what
[46:07] the beast looked like we just know he's
[46:08] got these iron
[46:09] he's got the horns and he's got the
[46:11] heads and all these things so but we
[46:14] know it's an iron tooth beast which is
[46:17] the Romans now bodiham said those same
[46:19] demons that were Nebuchadnezzar's crew
[46:22] they left that and they went and dwell
[46:25] on the Medes and Persians and the church
[46:27] said praise God those men died
[46:30] Nebuchadnezzar died Belshazzar not they
[46:33] all died but those demons just left
[46:35] those bodies and went and jumped in the
[46:37] Medes of perkins not and then there's
[46:41] Medes and Persians they were a route for
[46:44] a little while and then when they died
[46:46] then they all went on Alexander the
[46:49] Great and all of his men and they
[46:51] conquered the world like that they had
[46:53] such a Swift conquering that's why
[46:56] they're like it unto a leopard they just
[46:59] swept over the known world and he
[47:00] conquered the world in a matter of
[47:02] hardly any time at all right and then he
[47:05] got so drunk he died remember being
[47:06] alcoholic at 33 years old man said what
[47:10] a contrast one man had conquered the
[47:12] world at 33 and killed himself by
[47:15] alcohol he said what a difference Jesus
[47:18] Christ had conquer the world at 33 but
[47:20] he did it by love amen thank you Lord
[47:25] amen and that shows you and I if we were
[47:27] to conquer Satan we're not going to do
[47:29] it by mite or human power
[47:31] it ends in death but we're going to
[47:33] conquer by the love of God the baptism
[47:36] of the Holy
[47:37] hey man that's how you and I are gonna
[47:40] conquer not by might not by power like
[47:43] Alexander the Great
[47:44] oh c'mon but behind but by my spirit
[47:47] saith the Lord amen
[47:49] Oh hallelujah now church you know after
[47:54] that all those demons went on Julius
[47:56] Caesar right
[47:58] those other Roman famous Roman guys you
[48:01] know but that out for that we know we'll
[48:05] get to later next week that all those
[48:07] demons went upon the Roman Catholic
[48:09] Church is that right
[48:13] what a great revelation this was I
[48:16] wondered for years what does this mean
[48:17] what are these lines what's the leopard
[48:19] mean what's a bear represent what does
[48:20] the line represent all these things then
[48:23] the takes a prophet of God to come on
[48:25] the scene and show us exactly what's
[48:27] happened so let me say like this today
[48:30] I'm sorry Rome is the modern day Babylon
[48:34] if you understand that is that right
[48:37] right because there's original Babylon
[48:39] and this is just Babylon in another form
[48:42] right it's the same demon powers in
[48:44] another form and then the Alexander the
[48:47] Great the Grecians they're just the same
[48:49] demon powers in a different form now we
[48:53] have the same team askew imagine we're
[48:55] battling the same demons that Daniel
[48:57] battled amen hallelujah not therefore
[49:00] demons the same demons right let's see
[49:04] we've thank God we've got a little more
[49:06] power than Daniel because we've got the
[49:09] Holy Spirit praise God in the soul as a
[49:12] seal unto the day of our Redemption
[49:15] Amen Alleluia now god help us to pray
[49:18] three times a day like Daniel Haman god
[49:20] help us the crowd to God like Daniel
[49:23] credit to God for the sins of his
[49:24] country right where the sins of his
[49:26] father for the sins of his family god
[49:29] help us a crowd like that and we'll get
[49:31] the same results Daniel got Amen it's
[49:35] exactly right and that's what we've got
[49:36] by the grace of the Lord now I want to
[49:39] go back here just a moment before I get
[49:41] to that a lot faster
[49:47] thought it would go okay now I want to
[49:51] take a look and at this ironing clay
[49:53] here for a few moments by God's grace I
[49:57] mentioned this I think I mentioned it
[50:00] last was it Sunday no that's Wednesday I
[50:03] believe it was I was mentioning a little
[50:04] bit on the ironing place I wanted to
[50:06] take a little bit deeper look at that
[50:07] here tonight by God's grace so if you
[50:11] have your Bibles go to Daniel 2 33 35
[50:17] because brother Branham says when you
[50:19] read revelation 13 you've got to
[50:21] understand where it fits in with Daniel
[50:24] chapter 2 because they go together
[50:28] those beasts you saw here they are the
[50:32] from Daniel are here they are in
[50:33] Revelation 13
[50:37] so Daniel 233 by God's grace having
[50:45] trouble getting to Daniel they're
[50:46] earnest alright Daniel 2 33 35 well I
[50:52] think I've even have it up here alright
[50:53] now verse 33 his legs of iron and his
[50:58] feet part of iron and part of clay
[51:03] now it's strange I didn't know I was
[51:05] gonna go this direction so early this
[51:07] morning I thought I was gonna go some
[51:08] other direction so it's interesting
[51:13] so this beast saw this image a head of
[51:17] gold silver legs of sorry abdomen a
[51:20] brass their thighs of brass and it gets
[51:23] down to the legs and the legs are iron
[51:25] but the feet are iron and clay verse 34
[51:31] now sauce till that a stone was cut out
[51:35] without hands which smote the image upon
[51:38] his feet that were of iron and clay and
[51:41] break them to pieces
[51:44] verse 35 then was the lion I'm sorry
[51:49] then was the iron the clay the brass the
[51:52] silver the gold broke into pieces &
[51:54] became like the chaff of the summer
[51:56] threshing floor ah how powerful is our
[52:00] God
[52:01] you know to get rid of iron today you
[52:03] really got it it takes a lot to grind
[52:04] that up doesn't it to make it look like
[52:06] chaff when take a lot of power but God
[52:09] so great it just takes one stone amen
[52:12] amen one sounds like a shredder and it
[52:15] comes down it shreds everything up and
[52:17] it blows away like chaff by one stone
[52:21] amen
[52:22] what is it Jesus Christ the sword of his
[52:25] word comes out of his mouth hallelujah
[52:27] and rakes it up into a million tiny
[52:30] little pieces and it all blows away at
[52:34] Armageddon glory and the wind carried
[52:39] them away and that no place was found
[52:42] for them so the coming of Jesus Christ
[52:47] is so great that the king is a man the
[52:52] ways of man the day of man gets divided
[52:55] and broken up like the chaff that gets
[52:58] blown away from her from the wheat day
[53:01] ahead by the wind the harvest wind he's
[53:04] so great that he blows away all man's
[53:07] kingdoms
[53:08] and there's no place found for them a
[53:13] man I'm glad about that praise God I'm
[53:16] glad that when Jesus comes back there'll
[53:18] be no place for these crooked
[53:19] politicians that we got today thank God
[53:22] for a few of the good ones if they still
[53:24] can be good like brother man said every
[53:26] friend he had that went into politics
[53:28] got corrupted but thank God for the ones
[53:30] that can say uncorrupted if there are
[53:32] such a thing I don't know if there is
[53:35] but if there is may God help them but
[53:39] see Christ when he comes back he's
[53:41] saying this place deserves it doesn't
[53:44] just is that it's going to be and
[53:47] deserves to be ruled by someone who
[53:49] knows how to rule praise God amen and
[53:53] there's only word worthy to rule and
[53:55] that's Jesus amen
[53:57] there'll be no place found for these
[54:00] homosexual kings and governors right
[54:03] these baby murdering politicians
[54:06] there'll be no place found for them all
[54:08] amen but thank God there'll be a place
[54:11] found for those blood war Saints amen
[54:14] kings and priests upon the earth they
[54:16] meant there would be a playstyle for
[54:19] them in the kingdom of Christ amen and
[54:25] the stone that smote the image became a
[54:28] great mountain and filled the whole
[54:31] earth look at the power of this stone
[54:34] the stone comes down smashes the image
[54:37] of the image blows away like chaff and
[54:39] this stone starts morphing and growing
[54:42] and changing in this mighty mountain Oh
[54:45] transformers and all these shape shifter
[54:48] movies they all stole God's idea right
[54:50] from the Bible because one stone turned
[54:55] into this mighty mountain amen
[54:57] the morphing the changing what is it
[55:00] Church it's God is it's God changing his
[55:02] form amen gotta morph a hallelujah
[55:05] changing his form the great God changing
[55:08] his mask unlimited God hallelujah hey
[55:12] man he goes from a state he becomes this
[55:14] great mountain oh thank the Lord amen
[55:19] what a blessing Church what a blessing
[55:21] she we don't got to worry all these all
[55:25] these false churches we like we have to
[55:27] get mad they got their day coming you
[55:31] and I don't have to necessarily tear it
[55:33] down we're trying to tear it down in
[55:34] people's individual lives now we're
[55:36] trying to tear that iron.i their lives
[55:38] praise God but you and I don't the way
[55:40] about we have to be the one to do it
[55:42] God's gonna do it in God's time he's
[55:45] going to do it all these kingdoms are
[55:47] going to fall God is going to get a
[55:49] fresh start with this thing amen that
[55:52] millenniums coming hallelujah now let's
[55:56] go down to verse 41 now you're going to
[56:04] here by a couple scriptures that this
[56:07] stone was not Jesus's first coming it
[56:10] had to be a second coming right because
[56:14] this was Daniel was what five hundred
[56:15] years six hundred years before Christ
[56:18] some people say oh this already came and
[56:20] went we'd have to worry about this no
[56:21] this was speaking of the second coming
[56:23] of Christ because we saw in verse 35
[56:26] remember in verse 35 there's no more
[56:29] place found for them right and then this
[56:34] mountain this this kingdom of Jesus
[56:36] Christ filled the whole earth and we do
[56:38] not have that right now there's actually
[56:41] no Nate hardly any nations if any that
[56:42] actually say they're a Christian nation
[56:43] our nation certainly is not Obama
[56:46] declared that himself right remember
[56:48] that was big news a few years ago they
[56:51] no it's not
[56:53] now verse 41 and whereas thou sawest the
[56:56] feet and the toes part of potters clay
[56:59] and part of iron the kingdom shall be
[57:05] divided but there shall be in it
[57:07] of the strength of the iron for as much
[57:09] as I sauce the iron mixed with miry clay
[57:14] alright so see here we see in that going
[57:18] back to the image here we see that he
[57:19] has strong strong he's ayran strong my
[57:23] and he has par aaron and part clay and
[57:28] notice it's miry clay okay because we
[57:32] know who the clay is who knows who the
[57:33] clay is protestants right
[57:37] the clay is protestants milligram says
[57:40] so the clay the Protestants have some
[57:43] pretty miry doctrine how many would say
[57:45] amen to that I go into quite a few
[57:48] Protestant churches their doctrines
[57:49] appear pretty miry right right Church
[57:54] it's not clear and clean it's not clear
[57:57] water like we get poured on us every
[57:59] service right Church it's not stagnated
[58:03] water right it's not dirty filthy water
[58:07] but all water is pure it's the
[58:09] unadulterated Word of God amen
[58:12] nein Tyree
[58:15] it's clear thank God for that but see
[58:19] the iron of miry clay are together the
[58:25] givers 42 and as the toes of the feet
[58:28] were part of iron and part of clay so
[58:31] the kingdom shall be partly strong and
[58:32] partly broken to see that's what it
[58:37] represents this Roman spirit is so
[58:40] strong but this Protestant spirit is
[58:43] kind of weak right kind of weak you
[58:48] don't see too many Protestant churches
[58:50] bawling out the Catholic Church do you
[58:51] what they want to talk about how
[58:53] wonderful their Pope is ma he's such a
[58:55] good man oh no not if he believes those
[59:00] things right so see it's partly strong
[59:07] but partly broken now the reason I say
[59:11] that church I'm not bashing Pope but
[59:13] listen he came to I was reading over his
[59:15] speech that he gave to Congress in 2015
[59:18] hum remember when he visited September
[59:20] 2015
[59:21] here's a man that's supposed to be God's
[59:23] voice and he comes and give this 45
[59:26] minute lecture it wasn't a preaching it
[59:28] was lecture his main points were on
[59:30] cooperation unity and patience and all
[59:33] all these things that don't have really
[59:36] anything to do with anybody now if he
[59:41] was a real man of God I think we know
[59:43] what he would have said when he got to
[59:44] that pulpit he said let me take a text
[59:49] and he would have taken a text Oh
[59:52] Jerusalem Oh Jerusalem how often I would
[59:54] have hovered you but you would not and
[59:58] then he would have started there and
[59:59] like the Bible said he would if he'd
[1:00:00] have been a real man of God a real
[1:00:02] prophet the Bible was sent prophets are
[1:00:05] hewers he went start to cut in and he
[1:00:08] would have started at though at the root
[1:00:10] he would have laid the axe to the root
[1:00:12] of the tree they were to point his
[1:00:15] finger there at Obama for legalizing gay
[1:00:18] marriage and all those are those Supreme
[1:00:20] Court justice he would have stuck their
[1:00:22] finger in their face and say that's
[1:00:23] abomination that's from hell
[1:00:28] right is that our church PETA made a
[1:00:32] real man of God he would have done that
[1:00:34] but it shows he wasn't
[1:00:36] instead they afterwards they take
[1:00:37] pictures and they smile they step out
[1:00:39] and the First Lady and the president
[1:00:41] stand there with the Pope and they all
[1:00:43] look happy and everything like that you
[1:00:45] see because that woman that Roman
[1:00:48] Catholic Church she commits adultery
[1:00:50] with every nation under heaven she's not
[1:00:54] there rebuking them she's there praising
[1:00:57] them because she comes in by flatteries
[1:01:00] is that right church and she didn't
[1:01:05] mention that was 2015 I looked it up
[1:01:07] there were 700,000 abortions in 2015 and
[1:01:11] he didn't make mention one thing about
[1:01:13] abortion do you know there's been over
[1:01:16] 56 million abortions since 1973 when
[1:01:20] they did the rover straight row versus
[1:01:24] Wade and Church a man of God would his
[1:01:27] stuck in feet is fingering their faces
[1:01:29] and said you're guilty of the blood of
[1:01:32] all these children at least the 700,000
[1:01:35] that year right what does he do he goes
[1:01:40] there Pat's him on the back how much you
[1:01:43] love you try to try to get along better
[1:01:44] try to try to be more unified try to try
[1:01:47] to cross break more any man of God would
[1:01:52] have said you bunch of generation of
[1:01:54] vipers
[1:01:55] is that right church huge snakes in the
[1:01:59] grass he said he would have said you're
[1:02:03] of your father the devil the evils that
[1:02:06] you did your father's did he would have
[1:02:09] ball them out that's why I say these
[1:02:12] things because it's the same demon
[1:02:14] powers just with a different
[1:02:16] manifestation with a white collar and a
[1:02:18] white jacket and kind of a half-smile
[1:02:20] like they care about you when you know
[1:02:22] they don't they're right not to see it
[1:02:30] partly strong and partly broken and it's
[1:02:33] verse 43 whereas thou sawest iron mixed
[1:02:36] with the miry clay they shed they shall
[1:02:39] mingle themselves with the seed of men
[1:02:41] but they shall not cleave one to another
[1:02:44] even as iron is not mixed with clay ok
[1:02:48] so this is what brother have talked
[1:02:50] about here we'll get to some quotes in
[1:02:51] just a minute
[1:02:52] but see the Protestant and Catholic will
[1:02:55] always keep their kind of separate
[1:02:57] groups but the Bible tells us how those
[1:03:01] two are going to weaken the religious
[1:03:05] stability of the world they're gonna
[1:03:07] they're gonna weaken it by mingling
[1:03:10] themselves with the seed of men praise
[1:03:14] God isn't that what Rome does divide and
[1:03:18] conquer Romans got to get into the place
[1:03:20] first and then it divides and conquers
[1:03:23] right that's right
[1:03:25] look at verse 44 it doesn't want to
[1:03:28] bring that out here in order to do that
[1:03:29] one where's my verse 44 okay let me go
[1:03:33] back I forgot to do 44 Daniel 2:44 I
[1:03:43] thought I had a slide for that sorry
[1:03:45] about that and in the days of these
[1:03:47] Kings shall the God of heaven set up a
[1:03:49] kingdom which shall never be destroyed
[1:03:52] amen
[1:03:53] so the stone could not have been the
[1:03:58] first coming because we don't see
[1:04:01] Christ's Kingdom great getting greater
[1:04:03] and getting bigger and Christ ruling
[1:04:05] over everything right we still see
[1:04:08] kingdoms of man which shall never be
[1:04:11] destroyed and to the key and the Kingdom
[1:04:14] shall not be left to the other people
[1:04:15] but shall break in pieces and consume
[1:04:17] all these kingdoms and it shall stand
[1:04:20] forever hey then I'll praise God so we
[1:04:24] know when that stone comes it's breaking
[1:04:27] up every Kingdom it's breaking up every
[1:04:30] man government it's breaking up every
[1:04:32] foul spirit praise God it's destroying
[1:04:35] every man-made speck of any type of
[1:04:39] rulership and it's setting up a holy
[1:04:41] theocracy can I say like that
[1:04:43] Hey sorry a god government amen yes a
[1:04:49] government where God is king amen oh
[1:04:52] yeah hey thank God
[1:04:56] that's our longing for church longing
[1:05:00] for God's kingdom to be here where God's
[1:05:02] the king amen
[1:05:03] over all the earth now he's over he's
[1:05:07] king over our lives right now right but
[1:05:09] we want to be king over everything
[1:05:13] thank the Lord amen what I'm looking for
[1:05:16] that brother there and I really am i oh
[1:05:19] ma a day when there's a real leadership
[1:05:24] all over the world oh my no matter which
[1:05:28] country you go to they all got the same
[1:05:30] rule this sweet Holy Bible right here
[1:05:33] amen this eternal Bible ruling the
[1:05:37] entire world amen now I tried to zoom in
[1:05:44] here and take out that horrible looking
[1:05:46] green iron creature there and I just
[1:05:51] trying to look at the feet for the kids
[1:05:52] sake you know they don't just see those
[1:05:53] in their dreams Hopi they don't agree
[1:05:55] I'll pray for them if they do
[1:06:00] now remember the beasts of Revelation 13
[1:06:07] is just this statue but it's just all
[1:06:11] those demons all into one right so this
[1:06:17] is what we see here in the end time is
[1:06:20] iron and clay so the same demon powers
[1:06:28] never died they just move
[1:06:31] dwell and possess other men now I want
[1:06:37] to take a few moments unless there gets
[1:06:39] these quotes from brother branham here
[1:06:45] now bear with me this is serpent seed
[1:06:50] 1958 and she had in her hand a cup of
[1:06:53] the wine of her fornication and speaking
[1:06:55] of the Roman Catholic Church and she was
[1:06:57] giving it to the kings of the earth and
[1:06:58] she was the ruler over all the earth
[1:07:00] spiritually speaking that's exactly
[1:07:02] right
[1:07:02] there's not another look at we could go
[1:07:09] back to Dan you'll get the image look at
[1:07:10] the image the head of gold the
[1:07:12] Babylonian Kingdom brass or silver Medes
[1:07:14] a Persians brass Alexander the Great and
[1:07:16] so forth the Grecian kingdom then the
[1:07:18] Roman empires Eastern Western Rome the
[1:07:20] two feet and notice in these 10 kingdoms
[1:07:24] which exactly comes with those ten horns
[1:07:26] that was speaking of this morning in
[1:07:27] each one of those ten kingdoms that was
[1:07:30] suraíhs there was iron and clay mixed
[1:07:33] together and that iron come from the
[1:07:40] legs which was Rome and there's that
[1:07:43] streak of Romanism he says mix in every
[1:07:48] nation there is under heaven through the
[1:07:53] Catholic Church that's exactly right
[1:07:56] and they would not mix anywhere and
[1:07:58] they'd intermarry among one another the
[1:08:00] Bible said they would look at them today
[1:08:03] so God showed through the vision of
[1:08:08] Daniel that a streak of Romanism would
[1:08:11] go into every nation because it's iron
[1:08:13] and clay mixed together so roll that
[1:08:17] streak or can I say like this slither
[1:08:19] can I just say like that the Roman
[1:08:22] Catholic Church has to slather its way
[1:08:24] into every nation and every group it's
[1:08:29] almost there it's almost there they're
[1:08:32] slithering and getting into every group
[1:08:35] a nation like last year I had a little
[1:08:37] article from China and the church in
[1:08:42] China is now
[1:08:45] recognizing I think I told you was now
[1:08:47] recognizing the Roman Catholic Church
[1:08:49] and accepting them so you know you think
[1:08:52] oh they're so strong they're they're
[1:08:54] such a communist country well recently
[1:08:56] they just started agreeing with the Pope
[1:08:58] right what is he doing he thought
[1:09:01] they're fulfilling Scripture that streak
[1:09:03] of Romanism is getting into the country
[1:09:06] and it's can deceive every country you
[1:09:13] know what's happening we see it now look
[1:09:18] he said they'd intermarry among one
[1:09:21] another so the Roman Catholic Church and
[1:09:27] Protestant Church is interested in
[1:09:29] marriages right they're interested in
[1:09:34] marriages program said when the
[1:09:37] scripture says they're going to mingle
[1:09:38] they're seen among men he said the way
[1:09:42] they do it is through marriages and
[1:09:48] here's how brother Branham describes it
[1:09:50] your boy goes with the Catholic girl
[1:09:54] when they go to get married they have to
[1:09:57] promise to raise their children Catholic
[1:09:59] see vice versa see it's the break the
[1:10:04] power of the other but what is it the
[1:10:10] Bible claims the whole thing is a
[1:10:13] prostitute now what are you going to do
[1:10:16] that's right and how the sins of the
[1:10:18] people would be visited on the next
[1:10:19] generation now note Church Satan is
[1:10:24] trying to break the power of
[1:10:26] sanctification in the home your daily
[1:10:30] life this just jumped out me like a like
[1:10:35] just flashed out at me this morning as I
[1:10:36] was preparing I was like that's right
[1:10:38] that preaches about ten years ago this
[1:10:42] is how Satan breaks people's spiritual
[1:10:45] power he gets them to marry the wrong
[1:10:48] person right and then he goes in their
[1:10:53] home and with this dead religion he
[1:10:57] breaks and crushes their
[1:10:59] desire to serve God through a broken
[1:11:02] home I think sometimes we forget how
[1:11:08] powerful our homes can be don't you
[1:11:13] what's the power of this church how its
[1:11:16] how its how close you live to God in
[1:11:18] your house the success of this ministry
[1:11:22] the success of any ministry depends on
[1:11:25] how close we live to God in our homes
[1:11:28] because this this tells it to be plain
[1:11:34] the way this let me just say like the
[1:11:38] way this beast out of the sea is going
[1:11:40] to conquer people today is by marrying
[1:11:43] into their house can you imagine that
[1:11:46] beast picture back there can you imagine
[1:11:50] saying hey little guy come on in here
[1:11:51] would you like to live with me can you
[1:11:54] imagine that hey little guy
[1:11:56] come on in here I got some food for you
[1:12:00] can you imagine but that's what people
[1:12:04] are doing when they marry the wrong
[1:12:07] person and the church said when they
[1:12:13] marry a Roman Catholic or they marry an
[1:12:16] unconverted person right right Church
[1:12:19] yeah I'm not laughing making fun woman
[1:12:22] I'm just laughing imagine that guy
[1:12:24] coming in their house right that's what
[1:12:29] they're letting in and once that beast
[1:12:31] gets in it starts crushing your
[1:12:35] sanctified life right and program calls
[1:12:41] that a streak of rheumatism see a boy
[1:12:43] goes with a girl they get married they
[1:12:45] promise to raise them Catholic and
[1:12:48] listen we're not promising to raise
[1:12:51] people message we're promising to raise
[1:12:54] them to Jesus Christ if you understand
[1:12:56] what I mean because not everything
[1:13:00] that's message is really the Bible
[1:13:02] message okay
[1:13:04] right there's a lot of people that say
[1:13:07] their message but they're not Bible
[1:13:09] message now if we say
[1:13:13] we're gonna break so we're gonna raise
[1:13:15] them according to the power of the Bible
[1:13:17] message I'll say amen to that but not
[1:13:19] every church that says their message
[1:13:21] church is really a message church we
[1:13:25] know that so hope you understand what
[1:13:27] I'm saying it's a balance see Satan is
[1:13:32] trying to break the power of your
[1:13:35] dedication at home and I just want to
[1:13:37] linger on that as we close I'll give out
[1:13:40] give me about 15 minutes I don't want to
[1:13:42] leave this I felt let the Holy Spirit on
[1:13:46] this one I felt I felt LED of the Holy
[1:13:47] Spirit I wasn't looking for this this
[1:13:49] morning when I got up to pray read my
[1:13:50] Bible this kind of came right as I was
[1:13:53] in the process I'm like and I kind of
[1:13:54] know that's kind of how the Holy Spirit
[1:13:55] operates what kind of unexpectedly let
[1:14:03] me say like this you have a spiritual
[1:14:06] pop or in your house right now
[1:14:09] and Church only you know how strong it
[1:14:12] is
[1:14:13] is that right Satan knows people that
[1:14:18] are claiming to say well I'm a Christian
[1:14:20] of course as soon as you say those words
[1:14:22] your name goes on the book in heaven is
[1:14:24] that right as long as you believe that
[1:14:27] your name stays on the book brother Ram
[1:14:29] says as soon as you say I'm not a
[1:14:31] Christian I'm a filthy Christian he said
[1:14:33] then you'll start sinning after that
[1:14:36] right it's the power of your confession
[1:14:40] Satan knows when you say I'm a Holy
[1:14:43] Ghost old saying a Christian I'm a
[1:14:45] believer I believe in time message I
[1:14:47] believe all the Bible he knows you're
[1:14:50] starting to get power in your house and
[1:14:53] so he wants to break your power and the
[1:14:56] way to break your power Samson is to get
[1:15:00] you to go to sleep with Delilah in your
[1:15:03] house amen and the church said where did
[1:15:08] Samson lose his power in a house his
[1:15:11] power was broken as he spiritually slept
[1:15:14] and gave away his dedication in his
[1:15:18] house where's your power get broken in
[1:15:24] your house
[1:15:29] where does road RAM say the power gets
[1:15:31] broken in the house and their marriages
[1:15:35] praise God
[1:15:38] now that's for someone who's the
[1:15:41] backsliders sinning or somebody but a
[1:15:45] Christian who has a Christian Holy Ghost
[1:15:47] real home you've got a home like a
[1:15:49] beehive or a power house you've got a
[1:15:52] power house and you're the power in your
[1:15:56] wits all the chains and all the
[1:15:59] temptations and all the fiery darts that
[1:16:02] come against your home or all the box of
[1:16:04] snakes that come to your home you refuse
[1:16:06] it you cast it out and your house is a
[1:16:08] house of worship amen it's a house of
[1:16:12] power because you keep the same commands
[1:16:17] that are kept at the but at the house of
[1:16:19] God the same holy spirit we feel here
[1:16:21] and sincere and moves here is the same
[1:16:25] spirit that lives in your home amen
[1:16:27] and if not the power of your home is
[1:16:30] broken because that's all he wants to do
[1:16:34] is just break the power in your house
[1:16:39] how many parents can say amen to that
[1:16:42] amen I'm a parent too what's what's the
[1:16:48] whole strategy break the power of every
[1:16:50] home pretty striking isn't it pretty
[1:16:56] strike if this beast
[1:16:58] if this little cute little guy over here
[1:16:59] if he's gonna conquer the world and
[1:17:02] church he is going to conquer the world
[1:17:04] he almost has already conquer the world
[1:17:06] they've let Heisey conquer he conquers
[1:17:10] by conquering the homes and then they
[1:17:13] take that to the schools then they take
[1:17:15] it to the government building
[1:17:16] they take it to their false churches but
[1:17:18] he conquers the whole force
[1:17:20] Gordon brother branham he breaks the
[1:17:23] power in the in the unity of the family
[1:17:26] first all right is that clear
[1:17:32] look what he says next this is now
[1:17:34] earlier handwriting on the wall and how
[1:17:35] that the Roman they have their two
[1:17:37] different churches against the Gentile
[1:17:38] what would be Catholic and one
[1:17:40] Protestant iron and clay the iron of the
[1:17:43] Roman Catholic Church and the clay of
[1:17:44] the process how they wouldn't mix
[1:17:46] together but would mingle them seeds one
[1:17:50] marrying into the other and trying to
[1:17:53] break the power of the other one look
[1:17:56] how I keep saying it braking power
[1:17:57] braking power where our houses are
[1:18:01] supposed to be power house is a very not
[1:18:05] broken power in a house but power houses
[1:18:08] again Alleluia power houses our homes we
[1:18:14] live in the spiritual power house with
[1:18:18] Satan wants to break the power of the
[1:18:20] house just perfectly exactly how God
[1:18:26] said he would take place I love this one
[1:18:30] and that has come to pass just as
[1:18:32] perfect as could come to pass he says
[1:18:35] and every other promise of God will come
[1:18:37] to pass just as perfectly as that was
[1:18:39] some day we're going home to glory
[1:18:42] someday
[1:18:43] Jesus is coming amen so just as the iron
[1:18:47] and clay is mixed and given an iron
[1:18:51] streak into every home so is that stone
[1:18:54] going to come out of the mountain and so
[1:18:56] before that sort of the same thing
[1:18:58] before that Jesus is going to resurrect
[1:19:00] this bride to meet him in the air
[1:19:02] amen just as that one's gonna be
[1:19:06] fulfilled so as the good promise is
[1:19:08] going to be fulfilled as well oh thank
[1:19:11] you lord
[1:19:13] breaking the power breaking the power
[1:19:19] and how that
[1:19:22] last days when they broke up in these
[1:19:24] many different kingdoms and so forth to
[1:19:26] the toes there was iron and clay and it
[1:19:28] means the prophets head as much as thou
[1:19:31] did see iron and clay won't mix together
[1:19:32] neither will these cleave one to another
[1:19:34] but mingle them seeds in other words
[1:19:38] they'll marry into them trying to raise
[1:19:40] their children and break for the powers
[1:19:44] like that
[1:19:48] do you realize church that you and your
[1:19:51] children are supposed to be powerhouses
[1:19:53] for the kingdom of God we're supposed to
[1:19:57] have power we're supposed to have zeal
[1:20:01] we're supposed to have light people
[1:20:04] should be able to walk in your house and
[1:20:06] say my this place is spiritually on fire
[1:20:08] for the Lord shouldn't walk in and say
[1:20:13] well spiritually is did you not pay the
[1:20:15] light bill or you forget to pay the
[1:20:17] electric bill spiritually speaking right
[1:20:21] well it's knocking cold in here it
[1:20:24] shouldn't be knocking go h me warm and
[1:20:27] bright with God's Word but st. wants to
[1:20:32] break the power of the home according to
[1:20:36] the prophet of God and the way you have
[1:20:41] powers how you raise your children is
[1:20:45] that right either you raise children and
[1:20:49] it breaks the power of God or you raise
[1:20:52] them and it increases the power of God
[1:20:55] it depends how you raise them right
[1:20:59] that's that's what it says trying to
[1:21:02] raise their children to break the powers
[1:21:05] we're trying to raise them to strengthen
[1:21:08] the powers and you know how the
[1:21:15] the church does it they this is how
[1:21:16] their their false teachers did it I even
[1:21:19] have it on our video at school I let the
[1:21:22] kids see it every year there with all
[1:21:24] the Halloween and Easter all they've
[1:21:27] done is taken pagan pagan ceremonies and
[1:21:30] mix them with Roman Catholic ceremonies
[1:21:33] it's just a mixture just like this iron
[1:21:35] clay they just mix in together
[1:21:38] and that's the way the Roman and
[1:21:40] Catholicism does it today they go to
[1:21:42] church but then they mix and they let
[1:21:44] sin seep into their homes till it's a
[1:21:47] cesspool of corruption amen that's right
[1:21:53] to go to church on Sunday they'll take
[1:21:55] the mass or they go to Protestant church
[1:21:57] they'll take the grape juice or
[1:21:58] communion or whatever but then they'll
[1:22:00] watch dirty movies in the house right
[1:22:04] then they'll lie to each other amongst
[1:22:06] family members then they'll let sexual
[1:22:08] abuse happened amongst family members
[1:22:10] because they're not taking good care of
[1:22:12] their children like they ought to and
[1:22:15] pretty soon its corrupted pretty soon
[1:22:19] the power of God is broken in the house
[1:22:25] trying to raise their children and break
[1:22:28] for the powers and you know that's the
[1:22:31] truth I do I say a member of the band
[1:22:33] but ahold it's got and you people
[1:22:36] knocking down say oh it's wonderful it's
[1:22:40] not wonderful it's not how you raise the
[1:22:46] children how I raise my children is
[1:22:48] either allowing God's power to grow in
[1:22:51] their eyes or it's breaking the power of
[1:22:54] God in their lives and this is how the
[1:22:58] Beast dominates the entire world by
[1:23:01] breaking the home breaking the power of
[1:23:04] Christ in the home right because I
[1:23:08] preached here
[1:23:09] Fermi breaching here right with the this
[1:23:16] the sin from numbers nineteen waters the
[1:23:19] separation you've heard me preach it
[1:23:21] right if they if Israel touch anything
[1:23:25] dead in their tents they were cut off
[1:23:27] from public worship they're dead
[1:23:29] spiritually the only way they can get
[1:23:33] back into church is by going to get
[1:23:36] sprinkled and wash on the first day and
[1:23:38] on the fourth day and then the seventh
[1:23:41] right now I'm sorry third day then seven
[1:23:43] third day and that's how it is when
[1:23:46] people that a little lie or little evil
[1:23:48] things go on their home and they come to
[1:23:49] church and if they don't confess of that
[1:23:52] they get nothing out of church the next
[1:23:53] time and brother and preach that waters
[1:23:57] of separation praise God someone during
[1:24:03] one of the dad does a dirty job and
[1:24:05] steal some money from somebody if he
[1:24:07] don't confess that the whole family will
[1:24:08] come to church and they're spiritually
[1:24:09] dead they no longer hear the word of God
[1:24:12] praise God mom does some gossiping on
[1:24:16] the phone or mom does some gospel on
[1:24:18] Facebook or something like that and
[1:24:20] doesn't confess it it promotes the whole
[1:24:22] family and if they don't confess that
[1:24:24] it's gonna make everything in the home
[1:24:26] defiled and the church said that's right
[1:24:30] trying to break the powers 19:54 and
[1:24:41] today you see the Catholic and
[1:24:42] Protestants marry among one other trying
[1:24:44] to break the power down at every step
[1:24:46] and every Corey says this breaking the
[1:24:49] power in the home raise your children
[1:24:57] have to promise them to raise them this
[1:24:59] way or that being Catholic or Protestant
[1:25:03] we'll get to that after
[1:25:05] a few nights notice how that is how the
[1:25:06] other the strong of the iron dominated
[1:25:08] the other broken to pieces and shattered
[1:25:10] away but the lamb came asserted and the
[1:25:12] holy people in that day amen praise God
[1:25:15] the holy people will stand for a
[1:25:18] holiness in this day that's right and
[1:25:27] how that Roman power went through every
[1:25:29] nation there's not another power in the
[1:25:32] world and only one way can go through is
[1:25:34] through Catholicism the Catholic Church
[1:25:37] into all the world breaking out in there
[1:25:40] it's a marvelous great picture here and
[1:25:42] you Protestants just keep your shoes on
[1:25:48] just keep your shoes on because brother
[1:25:51] you're right with it he says so you
[1:25:54] sound like you take your shoes off and
[1:25:55] put up your shoes so see it's all
[1:25:56] Catholic there's no problem with me I'm
[1:25:58] process it but have to keep your shoes
[1:26:00] on he says you're right into it just as
[1:26:04] big as the rest of them let me say let
[1:26:07] me say like this message Church keep
[1:26:09] your shoes on because their churches
[1:26:12] like us that are just as guilty as the
[1:26:14] Protestants that their women cut their
[1:26:17] hair wear makeup let the men cuss and
[1:26:20] smoke and do dirty things like they
[1:26:21] ought to do let them lust the new evil
[1:26:25] things like they ought not to do let
[1:26:27] them give more to their jobs more they
[1:26:29] give to the house of God they let jobs
[1:26:32] and cars and homes become idols instead
[1:26:35] of putting God first place
[1:26:37] oh you see it all the time just go to
[1:26:40] big message church where they got a lot
[1:26:41] of rich people just go there you'll see
[1:26:44] it little family driving there they got
[1:26:48] two three kids they got a $60,000 you
[1:26:51] name it I forget the name of those one
[1:26:53] fancy Escalades all right now you tell
[1:26:57] me a family of three needs a $60,000
[1:26:59] Escalade and they just run and so they
[1:27:02] just start to feel a little bit better
[1:27:04] than other people we're just a little
[1:27:06] bit better than other people then pretty
[1:27:09] soon they're their wives so I went a
[1:27:10] little you know the shorter skirts with
[1:27:13] you know the slits in the side because
[1:27:17] they're just a little more fashionable
[1:27:18] and notice that the the the women shoots
[1:27:21] can little bit tighter that family and
[1:27:22] you can start seeing you know forms of
[1:27:24] the body we shouldn't see in their
[1:27:26] bodies and the church said I've seen it
[1:27:31] I've seen it don't tell me I have it the
[1:27:35] priests turn I've talked to some of
[1:27:36] these families and they say well we can
[1:27:38] handle cable TV or we can handle Netflix
[1:27:41] or we can handle watching the Superbowl
[1:27:43] and and the NBA games we can handle
[1:27:46] watching these because we know we're
[1:27:49] spiritually strong enough I'm sorry
[1:27:53] Satan's done broke your power you're
[1:27:57] blind you're in need of some ice out of
[1:27:59] church is that right
[1:28:01] I've seen it you don't to tell me people
[1:28:03] have stood right there in the office and
[1:28:05] told me we can handle cable no you can't
[1:28:08] there's a reason they angel Lord told
[1:28:10] brother Graham don't you ever allow that
[1:28:12] in your house that right there's a
[1:28:17] reason because a little leaven leavens
[1:28:20] the whole lump
[1:28:25] just keep your shoes on brother you
[1:28:29] sisters just keep your shoes on don't
[1:28:31] ever think all we can send back it oh we
[1:28:33] got everything we're perfect we just do
[1:28:35] everything right that's your first sign
[1:28:37] you're falling back from God because the
[1:28:41] Holy Ghost filled Saints even when they
[1:28:42] got beat up in Acts chapter 4 they got
[1:28:45] beat up the Bible said they got it a
[1:28:47] little bit discouraged they went back
[1:28:48] and said oh God give us more boldness
[1:28:51] that we won't be scared to preach and
[1:28:53] teach in the name of Jesus Christ amen
[1:28:57] so that's the sign that somebody's
[1:29:00] really got the Holy Ghost when they get
[1:29:01] discouraged they don't get worldly they
[1:29:03] don't get complacent they cross to God
[1:29:05] and say give me more bonus for Jesus
[1:29:08] guys when they morning brother and I
[1:29:10] prayed to inside God annoy me with
[1:29:12] boldness to go pass on my book in school
[1:29:14] they went right into this room of a
[1:29:16] person I respect and I said I write and
[1:29:20] dig through the book and the person's
[1:29:22] got paint all over her face short hair
[1:29:23] pants and I said I said I said now we
[1:29:27] you may not agree with this but this is
[1:29:30] what I believe my wife doesn't wear
[1:29:31] makeup
[1:29:32] my wife doesn't cut her hair my wife
[1:29:33] doesn't wear pants and I said it right
[1:29:34] in front of somebody who had pants on
[1:29:36] makeup and short hair that's that we
[1:29:39] made a four I said if you're a Christian
[1:29:41] I love you with the love of Christ but I
[1:29:43] just felt led to share this with you and
[1:29:45] that was the most honest and humble I've
[1:29:48] ever seen that person look in my life
[1:29:49] I've been working there with them for
[1:29:51] over ten years and I felt such a Friends
[1:29:54] of the Lord I felt such boldness for the
[1:29:56] Holy Spirit
[1:29:57] hey amen
[1:30:00] now let another one I went another room
[1:30:02] I just walked right in there so I like
[1:30:03] they give you this and this person got
[1:30:06] really really shy and I said well let me
[1:30:09] explain now we get all of our vertebra
[1:30:11] or scripture from the Bible my wife and
[1:30:13] daughters just like this he said oh you
[1:30:14] oh gotta explain yourself to me
[1:30:16] you can live however you want I said yes
[1:30:20] sir I said I hope you'll read it and
[1:30:22] consider these things I said I believe
[1:30:24] the Holy Spirit will take you deeper if
[1:30:26] you search the things of God amen I felt
[1:30:32] such a boldness a church that's what we
[1:30:36] should do when we going to get struggles
[1:30:38] or trials the grill Christian doesn't
[1:30:40] fall away into a Backson condition they
[1:30:42] get more bone for Jesus Christ
[1:30:44] they say God restored my first love
[1:30:46] restore boldness help me to keep sharing
[1:30:49] and witnessing and teaching in the name
[1:30:52] of Jesus Christ hallelujah
[1:30:55] that's right Lord hey man thank you lord
[1:31:00] now here's where I wanna kind of kind of
[1:31:02] come glows down with this look what the
[1:31:09] Bible says Church look at the Bible says
[1:31:12] now this is the marriage chapter if you
[1:31:14] know 1st Corinthians 7 it's the marriage
[1:31:15] chapter the woman which hath an husband
[1:31:19] that believeth not and if he be pleased
[1:31:23] to dwell with her let her not leave him
[1:31:28] for the
[1:31:30] husband is sanctified by the wife and
[1:31:36] the unbelieving wife is sanctified by
[1:31:40] the husband else were your children
[1:31:43] unclean but now are they holy and that
[1:31:49] beautiful church this is the total
[1:31:52] opposite of what we just read we read
[1:31:55] how the Beast mingles its seed in the
[1:31:58] homes and breaks the power and the
[1:32:01] children power broken the whole home
[1:32:04] becomes broken but Paul says if you've
[1:32:08] got one real Holy Ghost filled say in
[1:32:11] that home amen
[1:32:14] if you got one saint of God so devoted
[1:32:18] to God so since there before us so in
[1:32:22] love with God if you've got one Saint
[1:32:25] praying believe in God it will not get
[1:32:29] overcome by Satan but it will break
[1:32:32] Satan's powers and even sanctify the
[1:32:34] unbelieving one amen hyah
[1:32:38] that's right church what a difference
[1:32:44] isn't that does everybody see what go
[1:32:46] from what a difference
[1:32:50] religious Protestants which message
[1:32:53] believers are Protestants right if
[1:32:57] they're not born again if they don't
[1:32:59] have the Holy Ghost they may they can
[1:33:03] get broken and they can get discouraged
[1:33:05] by anything and they get weak and the
[1:33:08] power of the home is broken but if
[1:33:10] somebody's really got the Holy Ghost and
[1:33:13] I'll say like this really believes the
[1:33:15] message somebody that really believes
[1:33:19] the message which is the Word of God the
[1:33:24] power of their life will be so great for
[1:33:26] the air that will start impacting other
[1:33:29] people that don't believe in the house
[1:33:30] amen hallelujah
[1:33:34] you have to word and say I'm outnumbered
[1:33:36] how can I live a Christian life I'll
[1:33:39] tell you how hit the Cris bit the Christ
[1:33:41] in you then you can live the Christian
[1:33:43] life
[1:33:44] is that right there's one thing you
[1:33:48] really need it's important for a
[1:33:49] Christian life and I don't want to go
[1:33:51] too deep but it's Christ right
[1:33:55] it's Christ there's one thing we need
[1:34:00] for homes to be spiritual powerhouses
[1:34:03] its Christ amen hallelujah snot religion
[1:34:08] it's not just true traditions it's not
[1:34:11] routines it is Jesus Christ himself when
[1:34:14] he's in one person that house but one
[1:34:17] person's life will influence everyone
[1:34:20] else and that person's life will
[1:34:22] sanctify the other ones hey man how
[1:34:26] different from those denominational
[1:34:30] people brother hams talking about that
[1:34:32] their powers get broken and they can't
[1:34:34] save God they're so weak it's because
[1:34:37] they're not born again hallelujah is
[1:34:41] that right Church now it's so powerful
[1:34:44] brother sister it's so powerful whether
[1:34:48] it's a woman or man so see even a woman
[1:34:50] can't say well I'm a woman
[1:34:52] I'm supposed to be meek and quiet humble
[1:34:53] in my life I can't overcome my husband's
[1:34:56] unbelief you can't even say that because
[1:34:57] Paul said that a woman can do it too the
[1:35:00] husband can be sanctified by the wife
[1:35:04] yet she's making quiet
[1:35:06] yes she's sweet and kind but her her
[1:35:08] power so great it's so like as is she so
[1:35:13] she's so quiet but her life is so loud
[1:35:16] hey she's quiet but her holy life speaks
[1:35:21] so loud that it starts sanctifying her
[1:35:25] sending a disbelieving husband she's so
[1:35:29] quiet I love that sock Seymour right
[1:35:30] she's so quiet but she's so loud it's so
[1:35:34] out instead of getting angry at the
[1:35:36] husband she prays for the husband it's
[1:35:39] so loud it speaks volumes
[1:35:42] instead of cussing and stomping off and
[1:35:45] get mad all these things instead of that
[1:35:47] she gets more humble and goes about
[1:35:49] serving God in such a sweet manner it's
[1:35:52] so loud
[1:35:56] not only that now it doesn't sanctify
[1:36:00] the husband but now the Bible said else
[1:36:03] were your children unclean but now
[1:36:05] they're holy my goodness look at the
[1:36:09] power of a praying husband look at the
[1:36:12] power of a praying wife church even if
[1:36:17] the other one doesn't believe the
[1:36:19] believer can walk over there and pray
[1:36:21] for the children say in the name of
[1:36:22] Jesus Christ I clean these children for
[1:36:25] the kingdom of God God let them not be
[1:36:27] unclean and let them not be dirty even
[1:36:30] though they are on my dirty disbelieve
[1:36:32] in the husband or wife or another
[1:36:34] let them be holy and God in time will
[1:36:37] honor that prayer amen hallelujah I
[1:36:47] believe that with all my heart the iron
[1:36:53] and clay streaking into every home
[1:36:56] pushing into every home breaking their
[1:36:58] spiritual powers can't keep the word
[1:37:00] can't believe the word oh but the Holy
[1:37:03] Ghost is opposite hey men only ghost
[1:37:06] flows like water into the home washes it
[1:37:10] all out gives them power to live a godly
[1:37:12] life oh thank the Lord
[1:37:17] here's what sanctified means a believing
[1:37:21] husband can sanctify or separate they're
[1:37:26] fully unbelieving wife from profane
[1:37:29] things and dedicate to God can purify
[1:37:35] see living such a Christian life
[1:37:38] purifies people around you if you really
[1:37:40] stand if you stand on the gospel if you
[1:37:44] stand for what's right it will purify
[1:37:47] and clean out other people in your home
[1:37:54] that's what the scripture says
[1:38:02] it will purify what powerful effects of
[1:38:05] Christ in the home you need one thing to
[1:38:09] keep your house powerful that's Christ
[1:38:12] Christ
[1:38:13] it makes your children holy which is a
[1:38:17] most holy thing your children are not
[1:38:21] unclean and dirty when you got a real
[1:38:24] believer in the house your children are
[1:38:26] holy set aside you've got to believe
[1:38:31] church if you've got a spouse doesn't
[1:38:34] believe all the way or something like
[1:38:36] that you've got to believe that God has
[1:38:38] separated your children God has a plan
[1:38:40] for your children's life amen
[1:38:46] and homes on homes as Christians should
[1:38:49] not be broken down into chaos right
[1:38:52] broken down into compromise and not
[1:38:54] obeying the Word of God they should be
[1:38:57] strong in obedience Shrunk and faith
[1:38:59] strong and faithfulness to God's holy
[1:39:02] word amen
[1:39:05] I want to read this for our sisters here
[1:39:10] so now we got numerous mothers here
[1:39:12] tonight for four month for moms and
[1:39:17] maybe some future ones too
[1:39:18] we'll see how the Lord tarries father's
[1:39:22] 3110 who can find a virtuous woman for a
[1:39:26] price is far above rubies the heart of
[1:39:29] her husband does safely trust in her so
[1:39:32] that he shall have no need of spoil she
[1:39:36] will do him good and not evil all the
[1:39:38] days of her life so look at look at her
[1:39:39] home she does good in the home her
[1:39:45] husband trusts in her she does good
[1:39:47] everything she does good for the kingdom
[1:39:50] of God for the glory of God it does good
[1:39:52] to her husband in the home he's not
[1:39:56] breaking the powers of the home is that
[1:39:59] dividing the home it's strengthening the
[1:40:02] home strengthening because the Bible
[1:40:08] says strength and honour are her
[1:40:10] clothing and she shall rejoice in time
[1:40:13] to come now sisters they're mostly over
[1:40:18] there here in the nursery but all the
[1:40:19] sisters right mothers she opened with
[1:40:22] her mouth with wisdom and their tongue
[1:40:26] is a law of kindness right so mothers
[1:40:29] let's be kind in the home I'm sure the
[1:40:32] moms were saying Amen over there you
[1:40:35] must have the law your law is this I'm
[1:40:38] always kind with my words the law of
[1:40:41] kindness when I speak I speak God's
[1:40:45] wisdom look at verse 27 proverbs 31 27
[1:40:55] she looketh well to the ways of her
[1:40:57] household and she eateth not the bread
[1:41:00] of idleness he's that beautiful she
[1:41:07] Satan wants to break these powers right
[1:41:09] Satan wants women or mothers or even
[1:41:12] dads have the law of anger in the home
[1:41:14] right the love condemnation the law
[1:41:19] being critical in the home that's the
[1:41:22] law Satan wants to have that's how he
[1:41:24] breaks the powers he ever got over to a
[1:41:26] friend's house and they're married and
[1:41:28] they just bicker back and forth all the
[1:41:29] time you ever seen that I've seen
[1:41:32] different homes like at first exciting
[1:41:36] kind of seems like they're joking but
[1:41:37] after you stay a little while you find
[1:41:39] out that their peace these people are
[1:41:40] not joking they've got some serious
[1:41:42] problems there's something wrong and
[1:41:47] find out lay
[1:41:48] there was an adultery there was some
[1:41:50] evil sin that was done there was some
[1:41:52] Lying some just some evil things have
[1:41:58] happened in the homes or why would they
[1:42:00] joke like that why would they sub say
[1:42:02] something like that the powers of hold
[1:42:05] have been broken by the spirit by that
[1:42:08] iron crunching beasts right he is
[1:42:12] crushed and eat in their spiritual lives
[1:42:15] so they can't even love the very person
[1:42:18] they promised the love for the rest of
[1:42:19] their life right they took him out and
[1:42:23] said I love you from this day forth they
[1:42:25] put their hands in the Bible I love you
[1:42:27] no matter what rich or poor all these
[1:42:29] things made all these promises but Satan
[1:42:32] breaks the power of that promise Oh God
[1:42:34] help us to be Promise Keepers amen
[1:42:36] hallelujah Christians must keep their
[1:42:40] word so our sisters they open her mouth
[1:42:47] with wisdom their tongue is the law of
[1:42:50] kindness and they look well to the ways
[1:42:53] of her household she knows everything
[1:42:56] that's going on the house
[1:42:57] she's aware of that she's kind she
[1:43:00] speaks wise words to the children not
[1:43:04] foolish words wise words let's say into
[1:43:09] our feet I want to close with this I
[1:43:10] just want to remind our sisters of some
[1:43:13] of these scriptures I read now look what
[1:43:21] the Bible
[1:43:22] xico 19 now just take this thought a
[1:43:25] little bit with mothers my mother is
[1:43:28] like a vine in thy blood look at that
[1:43:33] planted by the waters she was fruitful
[1:43:37] and full of branches by reason of many
[1:43:39] waters praise God the Bible said your
[1:43:43] mother is like a vine in your blood what
[1:43:47] the Bible said what's in your blood the
[1:43:49] life is in your blood is that right
[1:43:53] mother's role is so crucial that's why
[1:43:57] one encourage our mothers here now
[1:43:58] that's why I felt let the Holy Spirit
[1:43:59] that this must this wasn't my thought I
[1:44:01] didn't think so I thought was a Holy
[1:44:02] Spirit bring it to me to try to
[1:44:05] encourage our mothers that you have a
[1:44:07] great opportunity to strengthen the home
[1:44:12] and then when you're godly teaching and
[1:44:17] a mother's godly words and godly life
[1:44:20] are live before the children with such
[1:44:23] sweetness and kindness the law of
[1:44:25] kindness the law wisdom that wisdom is
[1:44:28] so ingrained in them it's like vines in
[1:44:31] their blood
[1:44:34] notice it didn't say like little birdies
[1:44:37] in their brains are you with the church
[1:44:41] when a mother lives a godly life she
[1:44:45] sanctifies the husband now that this
[1:44:47] believing husband and her children are
[1:44:50] holy because she has such a powerful
[1:44:53] holy anointing honor Amen hallelujah
[1:44:56] amen and her impact is so powerful that
[1:45:02] it's like her life is growing inside
[1:45:04] their blood amen but if not
[1:45:12] say we'll do everything he can to try to
[1:45:16] break that power in the home I showed
[1:45:19] you five quotes tonight Satan's trying
[1:45:21] to break the power through mothers and
[1:45:23] fathers we have to make sure Church we
[1:45:27] keep all sin out of our homes and in our
[1:45:32] lips even dads should be the law of
[1:45:33] kindness and wisdom is that right church
[1:45:41] if not Satan gets in the home he breaks
[1:45:44] down the home and pretty soon it doesn't
[1:45:47] even feel like God dwells there anymore
[1:45:49] pretty soon everybody's got their own
[1:45:51] tablet what you looking at yeah there's
[1:45:59] no more time for prayer or singing or
[1:46:01] worshipping God it's just wasted time
[1:46:05] instead of redeeming the time the time
[1:46:08] is wasted but a Holy Ghost filled Saint
[1:46:16] life is so powerful it sanctifies it
[1:46:21] impacts that say all the people they
[1:46:23] live with and the Bible said even a
[1:46:26] woman all by herself can sanctify an
[1:46:28] unbelieving husband and make the
[1:46:30] children holy one woman amen hallelujah
[1:46:34] how did a woman was thought to be so
[1:46:39] little value in the Old Testament right
[1:46:41] remember those women came up to Moses
[1:46:43] and said can we have our father's
[1:46:45] inheritance and most like sure you can
[1:46:46] have it but like they weren't even in
[1:46:49] the original inheritance they were
[1:46:51] thought so little up oh but God sees
[1:46:54] women as such a great tool for his glory
[1:46:57] amen hallelujah you young little girls
[1:47:05] God give us a church of small little
[1:47:07] girls right you little girls never
[1:47:10] underestimate how powerful your
[1:47:11] spiritual love is for God because the
[1:47:16] Bible says it's so powerful
[1:47:18] now of course you want to marry the
[1:47:20] right person but if it ever happen where
[1:47:25] you were didn't your life is so powerful
[1:47:28] could impact them now think how great if
[1:47:29] you have a husband and wife in one
[1:47:30] Accord think what great powers of God
[1:47:32] can be manifested in that house praise
[1:47:35] God and church and sisters don't ever
[1:47:40] forget this
[1:47:40] they prayed over Ruth and said the Lord
[1:47:43] make the woman that's come in that house
[1:47:45] like Rachel Leah which too did build the
[1:47:48] house of Israel amen
[1:47:51] how do they build it by living a godly
[1:47:54] life by living a sanctified holy life
[1:48:00] they build the house of Israel and
[1:48:02] that's how we know that the bride of
[1:48:04] Jesus Christ will be finished today
[1:48:06] right by women by husbands and wives in
[1:48:10] one Accord making home spiritual
[1:48:13] powerhouses for the glory of God that's
[1:48:16] right
[1:48:16] I believe that wasn't my last one yeah
[1:48:18] that's my last one so Malachi have you
[1:48:20] come to the piano so I just want to
[1:48:30] close with that little picture there nah
[1:48:36] what are our houses no it's okay you can
[1:48:38] do the lyrics down what kind of houses
[1:48:40] are we building Church what kind of
[1:48:45] houses have we built
[1:48:46] [Music]
[1:48:52] it's either getting broken down and the
[1:48:55] powers getting weaker and Christianity
[1:48:57] is getting harder and harder all fours
[1:48:58] getting stronger one of the other
[1:49:01] programs that you cannot stand still
[1:49:03] just coming into one service you're not
[1:49:05] going to go out the same you're then go
[1:49:06] out better or worse is that right the
[1:49:18] move of the Holy Spirit here will only
[1:49:20] be as strong as our dedication to God in
[1:49:23] our homes
[1:49:26] [Music]
[1:49:32] let's bow our heads and examine
[1:49:34] ourselves for a few moments here I
[1:49:37] preach with all to me I wasn't planning
[1:49:40] on going this way but when I about 6 6
[1:49:43] a.m. there's this new different thought
[1:49:46] started coming I'm like well this must
[1:49:48] be the Holy Spirit and then I thought ma
[1:49:50] this is so Kruk this is so critical
[1:49:52] this is and then I figured out there
[1:49:54] that's how they do it they mingle them
[1:49:56] seeds together in marriages and they
[1:49:58] break the power in the home Satan works
[1:50:03] by displaying spiritual power in the
[1:50:05] home so God works the opposite by
[1:50:08] strengthening the home with holiness oh
[1:50:14] I'm so thankful to be following Christ
[1:50:17] today so thankful for that ego anointing
[1:50:23] church aren't you helps you fly way

[1:50:45] criticising lustin we don't let those
[1:50:50] things in our houses we keep our houses

[1:51:15] this church Lord for tonight you know my
[1:51:19] heart when I woke up I didn't think it'd
[1:51:21] go this way
