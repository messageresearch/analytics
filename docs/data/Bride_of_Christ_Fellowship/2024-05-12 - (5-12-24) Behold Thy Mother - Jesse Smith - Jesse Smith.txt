God we just come with faith today Lord God expecting you to move amongst us God that you might be glorified god with pure hearts we come today in Jesus Christ's name amen amen amen praise God take our Bibles here uh this morning I'd like to go to John chapter 19 John chapter 19 I don't see brother bang so we have to send them a text after service I don't see brother Jose he wasn't here last week either right want to send him a text and Trust everything is okay by God's grace John chapter 19 uh verse 2 5 uh for my Mother's Day message i' just like to preach on this little thought Behold thy mother I just want to preach on that today Behold thy mother John 1925 we'll start there by God's grace I'll read uh 25 and 26 and then we can all join our voices on verse 27 now there stood by the cross of Jesus his mother and his mother's Sister Mary the wife of cleopas and Mary Magdalene when Jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciples standing by whom he loved he said sayth unto his motherwoman Behold thy son let's read verse 27 ready 1 2 3 then saith he to the disciple Behold thy mother and from that hour that disciple took her unto his own home may God add his Blessing to ring of's word you may be seated so for Mother's Day I'd like to just preach on that simple phrase Jesus says Behold thy mother of course red letter words and we love all the Bible words but these are of course special beautiful words here by the grace of the Lord kind of just want to have an idea here today more time so I was just as studying preparing you know I had different thoughts and uh this is the thought that kind of stood out to me I don't think I've ever preached on uh this right here in the scripture I'll probably build my way back to here uh by the grace of the Lord I just like to to uh read a few things here uh in kind of building up to that uh by God's grace and we're thankful again for all the mothers today and mothers to be Hallelujah and what a what an important part they played in our lives Hallelujah so I want to start in Genesis uh chapter 2 I want to start there in 218 Genesis 2118 kind of give some background here Genesis chapter 2 of course we know God is uh creating the world he's already created it and he's building in uh all the elements of creation every intrical part you know God does a beautiful design Hallelujah and uh he goes through the trees and the rivers and everything and then in verse 18 and the Lord God said it is not good that man should be alone I will make him and help me for him and that word help me means an aid I'm going to make an aid for for the man and so of course we see here the first woman uh the first mother would be Eve and uh you know Eve gets a lot of bad stuff but uh you know uh if you would have been there you would have done the same thing brother I just heard brother Bram say it this week he said he said don't uh don't think so bad of Adam and Eve he said because right now you've got both trees set before you and he said you can choose good or you can choose evil so I thought that was that was very very balanced there brother Bram good wisdom uh you know all have sinned and fallen short of the glory of God and you know brother BR tells us though Eve in her first creation was the most beautiful woman there ever was and Adam was the most handsome man there ever was so we all as nice as we might think we are none of us are as close to Adam and Eve Hallelujah and that's fine with us amen as long as I can serve Jesus that's all that really matters to me Hallelujah but I I love what God does here he he says this is uh this is the first thing that's not good in the garden other than Satan being there right Satan was there in the garden of God uh the only thing that wasn't good was that uh Adam didn't have uh an equal part right all the animals had an equal a partner a companion but Adam didn't have one and God himself says this is not good that man should be alone now I know there's different ones in the Old Testament and of course the New Testament Paul calls it a gift when a man can just live without a wife God God Paul calls it a gift that's a gift of God and what is a gift gift is a Charisma it's a special anointing it's a special attribute so there there are some that are called to just have a special attribute of the Holy Spirit where they don't need uh a helpmate but then of course most of us probably do need that amen I know I do Hallelujah I was telling my wife you know with this identity theft brother William you know I told her I said I said I don't know how I could have made this without you honey I don't know how I would have made it through this you know I just you know I guess in my in my state you know you know in my human frailties and in my human weaknesses you know I just want to quit and give up you know I just want to I'll just throw away all my devices and I'll just buy all new ones you know just give up I'll just start all new emails and all new everything you know but my wife has really helped me to have a good attitude and well to have a better attitude I'm trying my best to have a good attitude she has a good attitude um but i' it's just been a fresher reminder that wow I've really needed someone there to help me through this because I've just wanted to uh maybe just ignore it or just try to run from it or be frustrated by it or become angry by it but God has showed me how much I needed an aid to Aid me through this Hallelujah and even yesterday we were reminded you know um someone you know or that person when they when they got through our account uh had had right when they got into a certain account they had already placed a a false email email um you know as a recovery email and I just found out about it now it's been over a month afterwards and so it that that false thing's been sitting there this whole time and and God still protected us so in other words if I'd have been to that account and I would have said you know I want to restart this and send it to this rescue email it would have went to the hacker so by God's grace God has protected me for over a month I haven't had to uh tried to rescue that account account and that was a very important account so just a a uh just a nice nice fresh reminder uh my wife was saying you know uh you know God gives us a shield my wife was just sharing this with me you know God G gave them a shield but you know those weapons can get really close like if you're in a if you're in a battle you know and somebody hit your Shield that's still just a few inches away from your heart there and uh God will I love it God will let the enemy get so close but then he'll say that's far enough Hallelujah just like with job you can go that far but you cannot touch his life Hallelujah and so we're thankful for God's Amazing Grace and this is just a small burden compared to what Saints have battled you know very tiny it's very tiny for me in my life you know but it's still something I had to go through you know and uh still trials but reason I'm telling all that is to again say God made me a helpmate Hallelujah and all the husbands can say Amen to that Hallelujah God give us a helpmate and it wasn't good you know for man to be alone so God made him a helpmate and it was a part of him and that's what I want our sisters to remember you know you're a part of your husband uh a very important part Hallelujah uh and as I can say you know I wouldn't I wouldn't be where I am today without my wife I told my mom that as well it's very true so it kind of ties in together with that attribute of the feminine character that God gave to a woman a Godly woman Hallelujah um and so we're thankful for that and God designed her you know to be uh the help that the man needs and I'm just going to use this uh quote from John Gil John Gil was a preacher in the 1800s faithful preacher uh he quotes the Bible it's not good that man should be alone uh he said it wasn't pleasant or comfortable to Adam nor agreeable to his nature to be alone because he was a social creature right we're all social creatures we like to talk we like to Fellowship we like to laugh we like to have a good time most of us don't like being alone I'm sure there's times you know my wife and I with eight children there's times we just like to get in a room where it's quiet sometimes you know I'm a school teacher there's times I surely I surely like my break of 35 minutes to have just peace and quiet just for a few minutes um but most of the time we are social creatures um and then he goes on to say uh that you know he not only was she useful for his species and to propagate and of course have have have seed and children but also for the glory of his creator right God didn't want him alone for the glory of God because it glorified God when Adam and Eve were together right because they would produce Believers Hallelujah they would glorify God their lives would glorify God we know for sure right we know for sure Adam and Eve taught Cain and Abel how to worship right and God revealed it uh to able that it was blood and that God requires a certain sacrifice amen so it was that glorified God when parents could pass down this is the right kind of worship and I'm glad we can do that here we could pass down on our children you need the Holy Ghost you need more than God sent a prophet Hallelujah you you need more than uh John 3:16 although we John 3:16 is a great summary of The Gospel amen but you need to acts 238 hallelujah amen need to acts chap 2:4 amen amen you need the Holy Ghost Hallelujah because there's more required in this day hallelujah it's it was the same thing you know on the day of Pentecost you know they had to go beyond animal sacrifices you know there's more than that God showed us more they had to go beyond John the Baptist water baptism there's more than that praise God and uh you know John the Baptist baptism uh It produced a good character in Apollo right It produced a good man he was fervent he loved the the word of God It produced Aquilla Priscilla you know there's some great Believers in there but there was more to it hallelujah amen and so that's what we're saying today we're thankful for John 3:16 we're thankful for all the verses but what we need is the Holy Ghost amen each child uh each child that grows up must have their own experience with God God doesn't have grandchildren let me remind that we don't have grandchild each one must have their own experience praise God and that's what it's our duty as our generation as I've said you know with the Revival we had last year at Napoleon or different meetings we've had here when we can see our children get in the presence of God we know we've done our duty as parents amen because that's our duty to get them in the presence of God so that our children the Next Generation knows God the way we know God and then it's our responsibility of course to continue that and teach that uh and share that but remember it was only one generation after Joshua that judges came and the Bible said they didn't teach the Next Generation the word of God so we we realize and even Ronald Reagan said it you know uh different American presidents have said communism is only one generation away from any government right and so is apostasy in the church or heresy heresy is only one generation away we can see it in the Brandon family I'm trying to be kind here it is I know it's Mother's Day but we can see it it's only one generation away and so each person each each individual must have their own experience with God and thank God he said he never leave us nor forsake us hallelujah thank God he said all who call upon the name of the Lord shall be saved hallelujah amen the Bible said he's n unto all them that are of a broken heart and a con contrite spirit Hallelujah and the Bible remember said the Bible said the eyes of the righteous or I'm sorry the eyes of the Lord run around the face of the entire world Amen trying to find someone he can show himself powerful in amen hallelujah so we have that confidence that Christ is here today amen and he wants to show his power in all of our Lives amen hallelujah now getting back to John Gil he said I'll make him a helpmate he said I'll make him one to help him in the Affairs of life not only for the propagation but to provide things useful and comfortable comfortable for him to dress his food I sure appreciate my wife dressing our food Hallelujah don't you Brothers appreciate your wives and mothers he says to dress the food and take care of the Affairs of the family and that's what you know I've always told people when people say oh brother Jesse you know we appreciate your children I always say well my wife's with him way more than I am I mean way more I'm I'm at work you know if you count driving maybe eight eight and a half hours a day I'm away and my wife's with them all that other time and then when I got home I got bills to pay or I've got mow the grass or you know I'm busy too and so they're mostly around her so that's why I you know I I I understand what brother Bram said he said if there's any credit to the Brandon family give it to Sister ma right because God showed him you know you can't just do discernments all the time you've got to take a few weeks off and go hunting you got to rest your human Spirit or else you're going to break down right and so who did God call God called a good godly woman me me BR amen hallelujah and it God gave her to him to manage the Affairs of the family and brother Bram not brother Bram but John Gil said uh God gave adam one like himself in nature and temper and disposition in the form and shape as one before him that would be pleasing in his sight and with whom he might delightfully Converse but in all respects agreeable to him and entirely answerable to his case and circumstances his wants and wishes Hallelujah so we see in in husband and wife and mother and father we see a perfect compliment one to another I'll say like this Brothers if you're married you know it's true when there's uh communion true communion of the Holy Ghost between husband and wife it's the closest thing there is to heaven on Earth right Brothers I thought I'd get a few more amens on that well we don't have many married men in our church that's probably why we don't have a lot of brothers in our church and two of them are missing anyway too but it's true you know it's the closest thing uh to heaven on Earth because that's what God gave adam and Adam and God brought that down to Adam he was do he was Dominion he had dominion over the Earth amen he had the power of God the authority of God and God gave him the best thing that he could give him a wife Hallelujah and so it wasn't good that he was alone everything was good except that and of course then the devil came later so we see it's it's an important part here that God built this in and I want to uh revisit a few verses here tooa uh Ruth 4:11 and all the people that were in the gate and the elders said we Are Witnesses of course this is with Ruth and Boaz the Lord make the woman Ruth that has come into thine house like Rachel and like Leah which to did build the House of Israel and do thou worthily in ephr and be famous in Bethlehem and I preached this years ago but I just want to rehearse some of these thoughts I've had you know for Mother's Day I felt have been from the Lord and I just want to reiterate them just to remind us you know it says here plainly Rachel and Leah were going to build the house Hallelujah and so that's what God did God used these women to build the house so uh God called Abraham right to to establish this house but then God was going to use the mothers to build the house Hallelujah Abraham was going to command his house to keep the way of the Lord hallelujah amen and have his servants and and uh the flocks and the herds and the financial aspect but the house of Israel think about that the house we would know uh that would be called the the children of Israel the TW tribes of Israel were built by the mothers of Hallelujah birth them and raise them and I think it's so beautiful you know uh the Bible specifically points out these two women and these two women are specifically pointed out as Builders of the House of Israel which God had promised to Abraham amen Rachel and Leah and God built them you know uh and and one was hated and one was loved Hallelujah talk about how many Mother's Day did Leah have where she didn't really feel loved remember Leah loved of the Lord that was years ago preached that how many Mother's Day did she go through where she probably didn't feel like she was the most loved wife and yet God looked at her and God said I'm using you to fulfill my promise to Abraham God told Abraham your seed is going to be like the stars of Heaven the Sands of the earth and God used these two women one was pretty uh one was the most favored one was not as is pretty and one was not loved so much and yet God can use us no matter what we look like amen no matter what we look like no matter how we're treated God can still use us for his glory and to fulfill prophecy Hallelujah to fulfill his purpose Hallelujah and these women were just as much part of it as Abraham because a after Abraham was gone the promise of God still remained the plan of God was still in process amen oh Church you're just as much a part of it no matter male or female child adult no matter how old you are you're just as much a part of the body of Christ as anybody else amen amen hallelujah remember the greatest Among Us are the servants Hallelujah I've said that many times but we look around and you look in a home who's really doing a lot of the service or amongst the preachers who's really the servants Hallelujah I'm talking about preachers worldwide who's the ones getting served and who's the ones that are serving Jesus said the servants are the greatest so let's keep that in mind hallelujah hallelujah remember the Bible said God gives greater honor to the least esteemed members of the body God will honor them it doesn't look like maybe they're being honored but God's going to honor them and I was reminded too a couple weeks ago I was listening I was no I'm sorry yeah I was reading a book we're reading our uh book and we're you know reading about American history for our Bible time and I was reminded how uh God told Israel in Exodus he said I've heard your cries in slavery and I've come down I've come down I've come down to deliver you and it was just a fresh reminder God heard it for 400 years and how many generations I mean they lived at least 100 right I mean Moses lived 120 years so that that's at least four generations maybe three and a half four so just the point just the point that someone could live their whole life crying out to God and see no real answer to their prayers but yet the whole time God was listening it was just a a fresh reminder to me that God hears our prayers no matter what our circumstances look like God has a purpose God's Got A Time God's got a season God's got a program amen but God still hears you whether you wait 5 years 40 years 400 years God still hears your cries amen hallelujah I'll say like this he e he'll either dry your tears now or he'll dry your tears later amen cuz we are promised in revelation 22 I'll wipe away all the tears from their eyes amen I was just it was just a fresh beautiful reminder I thought about then that they brought it to American history and the slavery issue and the hundreds of years you know uh uh Americans tried to end slavery and how awful the situations would be but yet God heard every one of those prayers amen hallelujah and so every every person was important every generation was important what if one of the generations would have said oh let's give up let's stop crying out to God and God don't hear us I've been I've been a slave my whole life I'm you know you can either use Israel or American slaves right see it's so important for each generation to keep the faith am to to to instill in the Next Generation even if we don't see it change it's going to change amen hallelujah God's going to do something amen hallelujah and the Bible said in Hebrews 11 many died not inheriting the promises hallelujah oh because we we have we must wait Hallelujah till we are with them many promises take for all of us together in fact a lot of this Old Testament prophecies are about when Jesus finishes that when Jesus comes back they're about the Armageddon they're about the Army coming out of Heaven they're about the Millennium Hallelujah heyen many of these promises are about when the body gets together when the family of God has one great holy reunion hallelujah amen my goodness so each person had a intrical part and like Rachel and Leah whether you're loved or beautiful or whether you're not so beautiful or not so loved God sees you building the kingdom of God hallelujah you're building the kingdom of God hallelujah because remember Jesus said the kingdom of God is not in Jeffersonville the kingdom of God is not in uh you name it akan or whatever the kingdom of God is within you hallelujah amen Proverbs 9 verse one honey I'm going to give you some verses here just to remind just to pull up some good memory uh scriptures here you know this this feminine attribute is super important we saw it uh we saw it there in Adam and Eve Eve wasn't a separate person or a separate creation now she became her own separate person but that's not how she started she started being one with Adam Hallelujah and she was just as much Adam as Adam I mean she their name was called Adam Hallelujah remember in Genesis 5 and so this feminine attribute is such an important attribute wisdom builds her house she hath hewed out her Seven Pillars Hallelujah so we see that wisdom the wisdom of God the uh the the timing of God the understanding of God the intelligence of God is given a feminine attribute and remember feminine is the weaker attribute so God has strong attributes he has weak attributes but yet they're all God's attributes Hallelujah God said wisdom builds the house Hallelujah so it takes this feminine attribute to build right it doesn't really matter how strong let's let's pretend brother Austin we got a we got a crew of uh strong young Amish men going to build your a house you know that that's really good it's good to have strong muscles and those those fresh beards they got you know like God that's what I'm trying to do I'm trying to do Amish beard to honor my former Amish friends I preached to last week but imagine you got a big bulky your strong musclebound crew but they got no wisdom you're not going to have a very good house I don't care how many nails they can pound in I don't care how many trusses they can lift and and and put up if they don't have wisdom they're not going to build a very good house Hallelujah so we see the same attribute God has strength and power but then God has weaker attributes God has we say lesser attributes but they're equally as important in the plan of God Hallelujah wisdom to build their house so for example let me just do another one there's nine spiritual gifts right you know the ones we like to see or I like I'll just use me the ones I want to see is I want to see Miracles I want to see tongues interpretation I want to see the dead raised you know I'm talking that that's what is that's what might attract me but we have other attributes that are just as important as the other ones right what if you now this is what we kind of see in the message what if you have all all miracles but no wisdom or knowledge of the word of God now just the same's true too what if you have all wisdom or knowledge but no Miracles see you want to have all that God has for us hallelujah amen so see we have all these attributes God wants us to have all of them Hallelujah that's why I was preaching on perfect Faith you know just as part of the song but it's a great reminder for us God give us revelation we want a perfect revelation of your will hallelujah amen I mean uh would wouldn't it be something Church you know just I'm sure we've had these moments in our lives maybe we haven't fully realized it as I said on Wednesday but in those moments when you've got a revelation or you just got faith you just know it's going to happen right and aren't those wonderful moments praise God when God has dropped something in your heart and you know God's going to answer God's going to change the situation hallelujah praise God oh it's a great feeling Hallelujah to know that God's going to do something I know God heard my prayer Hallelujah it's a great feeling right and so is the same as having the knowledge of God the wisdom of God the discernment of God Amen all these are attributes of the same holy spirit so we have to have wisdom we have to have these weaker Parts as well maybe uh not not so popular part scen as well in order to build the house Hallelujah now also don't forget uh numbers uh 19 I think it's two and three yeah I got three on here but put up numbers 19 2 and 3 even the red heer which typed Christ how many know there's a lot of talk about red heers in the news I saw a video last week on it and they didn't say whether they'd sacrificed the red Heff or not but they were actually there with the cameras you can see them there there are these four female red heers from Texas shipped over to Israel and they got them safely protected because they said for 2,000 years I think they haven't had I'm I'm sorry yeah for 2,000 years they haven't had a red hepher and then this is supposed to be the 10th and final red hepher according to the uh the rabbis writings about red heers until the Messiah they've had nine red heers now this is what they say I I don't see it in scripture but this is what the rabbis say and they need one more red heer until the Messiah comes but Church they're going to realize Jesus is the real red heer amen hallelujah the natural can the Bible said the blood of animals can only purify the flesh but the blood of Jesus Christ purifies Soul and Spirit hallelujah amen hallelujah and this the ordinance of the law which the Lord has commanded saying speak on the children of Israel that they bring thee a red high for heer without spot wherein is no blemish and upon which never came yoke so they're real careful they showed the video they're real careful not to put even like a little cloth on the red heers they can't have any yoke on them they can't do any work it's really something and uh they examined them they they showed they got the uh they got the magnifying glasses they examined looking for any white hair at all they've got four so far that have passed the test but then they can only be sacrificed in a certain time there are certain times and years I think that's a couple years we'll see and ye shall give her unto elas of the priest her everybody say her her unto the Ellas of the priest that he may bring her forth without the camp and one shall slay her before his face so Redemption wasn't possible without the female right Hallelujah so birth is not even possible without the female Eve right nor is redemption possible without the female Mary Hallelujah where' Messiah come from Mary female right we know she's just an incubator but she's still part of the program Hallelujah the church you're still part of the program amen right each one of us are part of the program you can't have Redemption without the female right with in other words God has you have to play both parts Hallelujah you have the major chords and the minors right Malachi is that right he's like well maybe dad you know how I can't correct it right now you're preaching you know thanks son appreciate that he's very kind to me and so it's this this feminine attribute that God builds in here and I think it's good once a year to remember that Hallelujah these have been wonderful messages I've enjoyed them over the years I preached on this one a few years ago uh Ezekiel 1910 this beautiful one I think I shared this with sister Naomi in a prayer line a couple weeks ago Ezekiel 1910 give a moment there thy mother is like a Vine in thy blood planted By the Waters that means this Vine has plenty of water there's plenty of life of your mother inside of you she was fruitful and full of branches by reason of many Waters okay so we get this idea right uh of the mother's influence in someone's life right the Bible said our mother is a New Jerusalem glory amen like a woman descending down from heaven and that means motherland hallelujah praise God that's our Mother Land that's where we came from that's where we're going hallelujah amen glory and this we see a child you have a part of you that's always going to be influenced by your mother Hallelujah and we see it in 2 Timothy 1 verse5 Paul said I've seen Faith uh in your your mother Lois and your grandmother Unice or they got to mixed up there yeah mother Eunice and grandmother Lois and I'm also persuaded I see it in you too because your mother is like a Vine in your blood hallelujah amen glory amen hallelujah so see Church you know our spiritual influence brother Ram said there's a reason that God places the the the the child right there it's right under the mother's heart brother Bram said there's a reason you're close to her heart Hallelujah right and so we see this this idea here uh you've heard this before lots of people say this The Hand That Rocks the Cradle is the hand that rules the nation right that's a famous saying there's been poems about it I think it from the 1800s even and it's so important that God uh you know it's so important that mothers raise their children with The Godly influences of the gospel hallelujah it's so important again because her influence is going to flow right through the child hallelujah it's such an important aspect and so I just love it you know the the faith of Lois flowed into Eunice and that flowed into Timothy it don't say nothing about Timothy's dad was a Greek don't say nothing about him it just says his mom Hallelujah it it's it's really wonderful to see that in other words each one of us you know if we don't have one parent that serves God as long as we got one hallelujah amen amen if we don't have any then we then our spiritual parents were there for us hallelujah because he was always faithful Hallelujah he never left us alone amen watching over our every step Hallelujah protecting us amen guiding us as we go through this Pilgrim Journey praise God like Abraham amen remember oh that's right and Abraham's parents raised him to be an idolator so if you don't have parents that serve god brother amen you're just like Abraham buddy God calls you out with the voice of God Amen Hallelujah follow me amen separate yourself and follow me I'll bless you hallelujah amen amen so it's a great uh lesson here the influence of mother on the children and I want to read a few more here uh also not with husbands so let's go to 1 Peter 3:7 before I get back to my title Behold thy mother I'll just start there and then go there in a roundabout way 1 Peter 3 let's look at here you know what let's this is so beautiful let's read verse one it's Mother's Day let's read this likewise ye wives be in subjection to your own husbands that if any obey not the word they also may be without the word be won by the conversation of the wives again we see how if women just live a Godly wonderful Christian Life in front of their husbands they can win them over whether to Salvation or repentance and of course it goes back to God's forn knowledge but this is what the Bible recommends women just serve God wives serve god with Godly reverence and fear and let God do the changing of the heart let Christ live through you that the husband can see him Hallelujah see Christ verse two while they behold your Chase conversation which means Behavior coupled with fear or that's honor for God so if the husband doesn't believe the woman's got to honor God above everything else she has to have Christian Behavior and the husband will the God will work on the husband say this is what real chrisan this is what real character looks like verse three who's adored it says let it not be that outward adorning of plating the hair and of wearing of gold or a putting on of apparel now of course this is uh expensive braiding of the hair right an expensive of course gold and and and expensive apparel we've gone through that verse four but let it be the hidden man of the heart in that which is not corruptible think about that God put something in you when you've got real character it's Incorruptible amen ah Hallelujah when you got the character of Jesus it cannot be corrupted Hallelujah it cannot Fade Away there's eternal life in your soul hallelujah it's Incorruptible praise God now your mind is corruptible but then it can be made new again it's it's got to be transformed daily I'm talking about the very character of who you are what's your main moral decisions every day that's the real character of a Christian Hallelujah Incorruptible Hallelujah Glory even the ornament of a Meek and quiet Spirit which is in the sight of God a great price see how important it is sisters for that Meek and gentle quiet Spirit Hallelujah and you always look at the opposite right always look at these famous women out there in Hollywood look how exact opposite they are they're not Meek they're prideful and they're not quiet they're loud and obnoxious right acting like like a man cutting jokes like men cussing like Sailors all all the things that they do and so our women thank God are the opposite of that and God said that's a great price amen that's I value that very much a Godly woman who's Meek and a quiet Spirit hallelujah amen she can take a command from her husband and say thank you honey right she can take a request from her husband Hallelujah Hal huah because that's what it says later on Lord she calls him Lord not of course that's don't have to literally say that verse five for after this manner in the old time the holy women also who trusted in God adore themselves being in subjection under their own husbands now look they trusted God that God gave them the right husband and so I'm going to trust how God's leading him because I trust God right God said God Christ man woman I trust God amen so God's leading me through this and even if we make a mistake just like Sarah she just keeps trusting God Abraham made a few mistakes he she kept trusting God Amen Abraham said she did they weren't married twice right and she got taken over into another man's home but she still trusted God oh my Mercy thank God for mercy and Grace Hallelujah he says so being in rection your own husband so trust in God trust what God has done let what God has joined together let not man put us under Hallelujah verse six even as Sarah also obeyed Abraham calling him Lord ruler whose daughters ye are as long as you do well and are not afraid with any amazement so that that's extreme fear we can't let extreme fear overcome us right that amazement that fear so that that's what the Bible tells our sisters here and remember uh I just want to bring this out since I mentioned it Lord Lord means ruler and so we we had some preaching on this the Bible said ye are Gods so I just want to just remind you of that when the Bible says ye are Gods it means you are Judges or rulers in the Hebrew so when when someone's preaching on ye are gods and the word of God comes to us and if we apply that to ourselves now remember I showed you on a Wednesday night sermon a couple years ago that there are verses that call Israel their gods but that just means they they were judges they were rulers in other words God gave them the wisdom to judge situations but they didn't walk around saying hey we're a bunch of gods that just that could cause people to stumble right so that's why maybe we just want to be careful how much we amen you know on on gods you are Gods right because someone might say you are gods and you'll s there and say yes that's right we are Gods amen and then you walk out and you sin well you don't look very much Godlike in that you know it it just can bring some reproach okay and especially when we're in a season of people trying they're trying to find fault that's why I want to bring that balance out because they're probably watching now and God bless them help them to repent Hallelujah but yes the Bible said Israel was God's that means they're judges they're rulers amen they're like God in other words they have God Spirit on them so they make decisions based upon God's word hallelujah they have and we have the mind of Christ Hallelujah now we're not prophets as far as us we're not prophets that the word of God comes to like Jesus was talking about ye are Gods to whom the word of God came to we're not prophets but brother brandham was a prophet Hallelujah so was Moses and John the Baptist and all these wonderful prophets of God but the Bible says we're judges we're rulers and the Bible said he that's spiritual judges all things Hallelujah so I'm trying to show you yes you know you we are Gods we're Godlike when we take the mind of Christ but we don't walk around calling ourselves Gods okay so that's my five minutes on that here by God's grace just a good reminder and that's why I like to say my wife and I were talking about this too a few weeks ago we like to say I'm a part of God I wouldn't say I am God I would say I'm a part of God I wouldn't say I am the word I would say I'm a part of the word because there's only one person that's God there's only one person that can say I am the word so that that's why I just like to differentiate that because I don't want to get into the pride element of I don't want to battle Pride right I want to keep Pride at Bay because let me follow around for one day I'll find areas where you're not like God just like you'll find areas where I'm not like God I Hallelujah and we don't want to become puffed up in our carnal Minds right we want to be transformed by the renewing of our mind okay so uh so Abraham was called Lord by Sarah or ruler honey you're my ruler you're my head in other words you're my head I'm trust in God God gave you to me Hallelujah verse seven likewise ye husbands dwell with them so likewise so just as Sarah was respectful like this like uh and Abraham ruled over Sarah by God's word likewise ye husbands dwell with them according to knowledge or understanding that's the mature Christian understanding giving honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel see that's why every Christian Church they must give honor to the women right because they're weaker and if if churches aren't careful they'll dishonor the weaker the strong will rule over the weak in abusive ways and so God said you stronger ones make sure you honor the weaker ones so they're not mistreated because they're still God's people they're still God's attributes amen Allelujah and every attribute is important to God remember God told that one woman because she spent a Year's wages on the alabaster box and because she broke that my and poured a Year's wages what do you make a year like don't say that loud let's just say 100,000 I make a h 100,000 a year imagine coming to church and giving a $100 giving all your wages at a church service 100,000 I'm giving it all I made this year I'm giving up for Jesus that's what this woman did when she broke the alabaster box I'm giving a Year's wages and that devil Spirit looks and says oh what a waste this is what a waste this could have been given to the poor and the whole time he didn't even care about the poor but Jesus looks up and said leave her alone Satan amen leave this woman alone let this woman worship amen let this woman sacrificed Hallelujah and Jesus said because she's done this the preachers will preach about her for the next 2,000 years until the Rapture amen what other verse do you know where the Bible says that about a man God used a weaker vessel a hum more humble vessel God used his weaker vessel and then he magnifies his weaker vessel Lord Jesus I just want to pour this offering on your head I just want your feet to be anointed for burial I just want you to be prepared for burial so I'm going to pour out of myself a whole Year's wages on you talk about a sacrifice Hallelujah now I'm not telling you to bring all your wages to church everybody understand that today's not my day to start being a Prosperity preacher I don't have any plans to ever start that I'm I'm I'm magnifying the weaker vessel giving such a large sacrifice think about that you know a Year's worth of wages All in One Moment In One Moment somebody could pour out a Year's worth of work of course you wasn't doing good work here but God saw the sacrifice God saw the desire I want to I want to redeem this year my goodness my goodness I want to redeem it Hallelujah hallelujah thank you Jesus God God Is So merciful Hallelujah giving honor to the wife as under the weaker vessel and as being HS together of the grace of God so husbands must look like we're in this together praise God we're all La you and I are laboring for the same goal for Eternal rewards Hallelujah Jesus said remember Jesus said don't store up Treasures on this Earth he said store them up in heaven and so if your wife's with you then then that should be our goal to store up Treasures in Heaven not on this Earth where moth and dust doth corrupt and finally that your prayers be not hindered so there is an element here if a man mistreats his wife if a man treats his mistreats his wife then his prayers are not even heard God doesn't collect them remember God collected corneo his prayers in a bowl he collected all these but God said I'm not going to collect your prayers if you don't treat your wife the right way heaven's got to have no record of their prayers think about that taking no record Angels aren't listening I'm not going to hear them so see church God is watching over his daughters Hallelujah he's watching all over his precious little daughters amen that he places on this Earth that man don't treat her good he's going to get paid he's going to get he's going to get rebuked for it right God watches over his people hallelujah he cares no one cares like the Lord amen we should cast our cares on him because of how much he cares for us hallelujah amen and look at you know just verse eight I'm just throwing it in there because it's so beautiful finally be ye all of One mind having compassion one for another so that's what husband should have they should have compassion on the weaker vessels talking about mothers and children as well love as Brethren be pitiful be courious have pity on your church family be courteous not rendering evil for evil if someone does me wrong this is my time to get back at them right that's not what a Christian a Christian doesn't wait for a chance to get back a Christian looks for a chance to be good to be pitiful amen that's the word right there to show pity amen I pity them I feel bad for them they're mistreating me like this but contrary rise give a blessing knowing that ye are there un to called that you should inherit a blessing go to Malachi 21:14 Malachi 214 if you got your Bible there this always reminds me this I went through this a few weeks ago now just for background in verses 11 12 and 13 of Malachi 2 Judah and Israel had profaned the Holiness of God because they married a strange God in other words they were worshiping idols and God said in verse 12 I'll cut off the man that does this the master of the scholar who offer these offerings they were offering offerings to God and Idols but God wants us to love him only he wants us to have holy love which means separate or sacred God wants us to set apart all of our love for him Hallelujah now look at verse 13 I'm going to read this too this has struck me and this have ye done again covering the altar Lord with tears weeping and with crying out in so much that regardeth I'm sorry in so much that he regardeth not the offering anymore or receiveth it with Good Will at your hand so they would come and they would give you know the the Bullocks or the turtle does or the Lambs they would give that and even cry on the altar now church when was the last time you cried in your chair or cried on the Altar and it was hopefully it wasn't that long ago I'm just saying look what they would do they would cry in God's presence and tears would actually hit the altar but then they would go and worship idols and God said I'm not accepting that I don't in other words goes back to that beautiful principle it's Godly sorrow versus worldly sorrow and God wants us to have Godly sorrow just getting caught uh shouldn't that that that that that's bad we should be sorrowful about that but we should be sorrowful and say God help me to never do it again Hallelujah Godly sorrow workers repentance Hallelujah but Israel wasn't doing that they were sad they got caught they're probably sad their animals are dying because their continual addiction to sin right crying and God said I'm not having any of it and the same men that did this were the same men that were abusing their wives at home because they were demon-possessed right worshiping devils and then trying to worship God is that amazing people can come to church and they can sing and worship but then they can go out and worship the devil too just like balam right sometimes you do enchantments sometimes he seek God is't that crazy people can do that Jesus said if you can't make one bitter he said make he said can't don't have sweet water and bitter water make it all sweet Hallelujah either make it all bitter or make it all sweet Lord make my life all sweet to you Hallelujah God help me to overcome sin and Temptation Hallelujah help me just to give a beautiful pure sacrifice of my life unto you Lord he said how can evil flow out of how can good flow out of evil mouths how can a good tree bring corrupt fruit it can't make it one or the other he says but that's what was happening here in the days of Malachi this was uh 397 years before Christ or somewhere right in there about 400 years before Christ verse 14 yet you say wherefore why won't God receive our worship because the Lord has been a witness between thee and the wife of thy youth now look at that see that that's what it's always the case whenever idolatry and sin comes in a man's life it's always going to mess up his home life right always either sooner or later it's going to mess it up I don't care how long they hide it Jesus said whatever is done in secret it's going to be shoted from the mountain tops that's right you can only hide it for so long it's going to come out right look at this God was a witness so when it seemed like it was there was no Witnesses if a sister was was mistreated if it seemed like nobody was watching God was watching the whole time he said I'm a witness between you mistreating her right God watched the whole thing see and so it didn't matter to God if these men would mistreat their wives and come and try to give a sacrifice God said I'm not receiving it if you can't live the life in your home then it doesn't matter what you do if you can't do it in secret I'm not accepting your public worship amen hallelujah that's why we've said it before but your way you live at your house is more important than what you do here when you come to church amen hallelujah praise God your Worship in your home your sacrifices in your private life that's more important than what you do here hallelujah may this just be a further expression of what you do in your home Hallelujah let it just be a continuation Hallelujah of how we live our lives in our home all right everybody glad to have the pastor back after three weeks off on Sun at least on Sunday morning whom thou has dealt treacherously so this man was a awful man treacherous against his wife yet is she thy companion and the wife of thy Covenant don't don't mistreat your companion don't mistreat this person that I've joined you together and did he not make once of God goes back to this you're supposed to be one Spirit he goes back to Adam and Eve Hallelujah yet he had the residue of his spirit and wherefore one that he might make or seek a Godly seed therefore take heed to your spirit and let none deal treacherously against the wife of his youth P there's all times let's let take a we can all take a good warning from that right husband or wife I know it's Mother's Day I might as well preach Father's Day Too here while I'm here right we all there's all time there's times for all of us rather where we need to take heed and make sure do I have the right spirit with my husband or wife do I have the right spirit with my children or my grandchildren if we're grandparents Hallelujah let's not leave anybody out today you know it's good just take heed examine yourself whether you be in the faith Paul says in 2 Corinthians 13 hallelujah it's a good reminder for all of us that God's watching all of our our conversations God's watching how we treat one another verse 16 for the Lord the god of Israel saith that he hateth putting away for one coverthe saith the Lord of hosts therefore take heed to your spirit that you de deal not treacherously right see God wants to make sure we treat each other the right way with the kindness of the Holy Spirit and God hates divorce the Bible said God permitted it because their hearts were so hard amen and he knew they didn't have the remedy for a hurt heart they didn't have the Holy Ghost in the soul so God permitted it because their hearts would get so incredibly hard it'd be better to divorce and at least be separated from this hard-hearted man that was God's mercy is't that something that's what Jesus said in Matthew 19 he said God permitted it because of the hardness of your hearts you men right because if I'm not mistaken women couldn't do the divorce in the Old Testament a man had to do it if I'm not mistaken so somebody correct me afterwards that's that's some correction I do want by God's grace I want all the correction that God has for me though don't get me wrong and so God tells them you men had the hard Hearts so God said I'll be a witness let's read verse 17 we might well this beautiful verse ye have wearied the Lord with your words see these men they would talk so much in church but then they wouldn't live the life at home God said I'm weary with all your words at church right don't put on a false show at church treat your wife right yet ye say wherein have we wearied him when you say everyone that doeth evil is good in the sight of the Lord and He Delight in him or where is the god of judgment so they're making evil good and good evil and other men were saying where is God just like we talked about well where is God in my generation God hasn't showed up for me remember that's what Kanye West said he was trying to serve Jesus for a few years he flipped now and now he said Jesus didn't show up for me when I needed him so he said I'm My Own God he said but see you can't that's not a true conversion a true conversion is I know the The Old Rugged Cross was for me praise God I deserve the cross but he took my my place amen and no matter what he and his wisdom allows to come to pass I'm still trusting in his sacrifice he died for me I deserved the cross but he took it for me Hallelujah so I'll devote the rest of my life to serving him because God commanded his love wherewith Christ died the righteous for the unrighteous the righteous died for the sinner I'm a sinner and Jesus died for me so I owe him my life Hallelujah now I don't know if this is true but I found this on a Church website but Abraham Lincoln said apparently all that I am or hope to be I owe to my mother I don't know that seems go along with brother R's stories I'm I just found it right before service so I was just thought my that's quite a statement hallelujah how many people in the Bible could say that right Timothy could say that Hallelujah brother Braham said it was jocked that told Moses you're the deliverer the angel the Lord told me hallelujah praise God Amen the angel told me Moses Out of Water God protected you amen his mother put all these promises in his heart hallelujah amen and I would say like that for myself too you know my dad taught me the greatest lesson but the majority of lessons I learned were from my mother so I thank God uh that your mother my mother's like a Vine that's in me hallelujah hallelujah okay I'm almost at an hour wow hard to believe now I want to look at a few verses go to Luke 21:19 H Luke 2:19 I want to now let's move down to Mary we'll try to bring this here to a little close by God's the next few minutes Luke 2:19 now of course we were familiar with these stories but the Bible said but Mary kept all these things and pondered them in her heart lukee 2:19 this is the thought I want to get to here at the end is the just this character of Mary Luke 2:19 this of course was after the birth of Jesus and the Adoration of the Shepherds Hallelujah so she brought forth Christ and then the Shepherds come and the Shepherds were talking about all these angels singing and the the Shepherds were so moved these are the lowest people in society and they they said we're going to go into Bethlehem we're going to go into Jerusalem wherever we go we're going to go we're going to tell everybody about this special birth Hallelujah is that something you know they came in there and they they leave out with this amazing testimonies praise God we saw the Christ child and so this was such a a a amazing thing to her the Bible said she heard all them and then she kept them in her heart and pondered them in her heart let's do that today let's remember when God has spoken to us let's remember when God has done something for us and let's keep pondering that in our hearts Hallelujah in other words let's not forget what God has spoken to us let's remember what he's done for us amen hallelujah she could have got distracted with all these other think about that as a mother or a wife think about how many things we could get distracted with but yet she said I'm going to keep this in my heart see that just proves we're going to keep something in our heart and we want it to be the right thing Church Hallelujah think about the years went by years went by and she kept that moment amen that special moment Hallelujah man God help us Amen to keep spiritual situations spiritual testimonies God help us to keep them in our hearts amen hallelujah that we remember what God has done that we don't forget his faithfulness Hallelujah because there are so many days are just regular and paying the bills and going to work and eating and drinking and sleeping and all these things we do but Mary didn't focus on that she focused on God visited me Hallelujah God sent Shepherds Hallelujah God gave us a dream of angels I'm keeping these things in my heart amen and remember she had at least six other children about ready to slap and say Amen about ready to slap a wall right amen she had at least seven children but she chose to keep these things in her heart not the disappointments of life and not Joseph's death either history says she died he died at some point and she was a widow but we don't know what remember even by the time Jesus was ministering the Bible said your mother and your brethren come to see you not your father of course he was never they really weren't father mother anyway right God was the father but by that time Joseph had already died and think about that she could have kept all these other things in her heart oh I'm a widow my husband's died but the Bible said she kept God's presence in her heart amen hallelujah what did she keep in her heart brother Jesse she kept the testimony of the Shepherds in her heart that they said they heard Angels Sing glory to God in the highest and on Earth peace and Good Will toward men Hallelujah that's what she kept in her heart the scripture says isn't that beautiful Hallelujah I bring you good tidings of great joy for unto you is born in this city of David a savior which is Christ the Lord amen so she chose to keep the prophecy about the savior in her heart and church we got to keep the prophecy about the Rapture in our heart amen the son is coming Hallelujah she could say the son is here amen but we could say the sun is coming Hallelujah I know the spirit of the sun is in our hearts but we're talking about the literal Corporal body the glorified body of Jesus Christ is coming hallelujah oh keep that in our hearts amen by Hallelujah so we got a choice what are we going to keep in our hearts let's learn from this mother of seven at least seven and a brother told me this week I don't know if the he's a preacher I can't remember his name but the brother told me he said I was studying or it was last week and he said uh a quiver the Bible said a husband a man's got his quiver full he said a quiver of arrows holds four or five arrows happy is a man who's got his quiver full so Mary had well over a quiver she had seven or I'm sorry at least was at least seven at least seven she had more than a quiver full but she said I'm going to keep the Son of God I'm going to keep the Messiah in my heart so I told Brother William I said I kind of got two Quivers buddy one's full one's partial full one's the other ones that should be there they're in heaven Hallelujah like uh Victoria Drew one day right Victoria we'll see him Hallelujah by God's grace and then you know the Luke Chapter 2 goes through the circumcision of Jesus the Adoration uh Simeon as uh scoffield says and then the Adoration of Anna now put up verse 51 Luke 251 now this is of course after Jesus was left uh at Jerusalem they leave you remember the story and they say where's Jesus they had to go all the way back right and uh they asked him that question thy mother or thy father and I have sought thee with soring so his mom asked your dad and I have been look for you and he said how is that that you sought me wish you know that it must be about my father's business and brother B said look the word always corrects the HS she was claiming Joseph was his father but Jesus says no I'm about my father's business Hallelujah and then what happened the Bible say verse 51 and he went down unto I'm sorry went down with them and came to Nazareth and was subject unto them but his mother kept all these thingss in her heart so these Supernatural spiritual moments that Mary had she kept she chose to keep those things in her heart and not all the Pains of life right not not all the people that had mistreated her and called her names remember brother B said when she brought um Jesus to be circumcised all the mothers were saying oh he's an illegitimate child remember was talking about that she's got she's illegit that's illegitimate child child that baby's born out of bed or wedlock actually sorry wedlock and Jesus and Jesus Jesus had a bad name Mary and Joseph they all had bad names she didn't keep all the pain in her heart she didn't keep being mistreated at church in her heart she kept the promises of God in her heart that's a Mother's Day lesson we can learn don't worry that's a lesson I need to learn amen keep the right things in our hearts Hallelujah the word of God Amen I know God visited me there I know God did that I believe God will fulfill it God will come Jesus is going to come Hallelujah and I want to live to see it by the grace of God hallelujah so that in my flesh I shall see God hallelujah oh my imagine imagine seeing Jesus in the sky in our flesh we shall see God hallelujah oh my it'd be the most privileged thing we could ever see with our eyes Hallelujah and so notice she kept these things in her heart no doubt Satan the Bible says in Matthew 13 Satan's always trying to snatch the word of God out of our our hearts right the Bible said the words God's like a serwer he Jesus SWS the words the Holy Spirit SWS the words and if we're not careful sometimes Church things get snatched out of our hearts that's why we need a transformed mind amen Lord change this state bring the bring the old days back bring the first love back Hallelujah bring your promises bring those give me more experiences with the Holy Spirit Hallelujah bring it back amen Mary would said no I'm not going to let that get snatched out I'm starting to get warm sorry I'm going take this off sooner she kept and we sing that song you know she kept these things and Ponder them deep within her heart she didn't let Satan snatch it out so church we can't uh we have to remember we got to keep the Lord in our heart in our constant thoughts remember the good times amen remember the times you knew God's spirit came on you Hallelujah keep that in your heart Hallelujah right CU if not what the Bible what there's only one other alternative it's the roots of bitterness you're going to have something planted in your heart and so we want to have joy in our hearts amen we want to have peace and patience and hope for a future amen those are the things we want planted in our hearts Hallelujah don't let the devil snatch it up so Mary is a perfect example oh ties and purpose Psalm 1 verse2 but his Delight is in the law of the Lord and in his law doth he meditate day and night Mary's a female example of this because remember she's like a Vine planted in your blood Hallelujah she's like a tree Amen in your blood Hallelujah the faith so see that's what Mary did she's like a spiritual tree but she stayed planted but she kept her mind on the word of God all the time she remember she remember to choose to think about the right things of Life the the good things of Life meditate upon God's promises for your life verse three and he shall be like a tree planted by the rivers of water and that bringeth forth his fruit in his season his Leaf also shall not wither whatsoever he doeth shall prosper isn't that something church I think it's just something that and I I made a video about this there's five New Testament Believers where you can see they were saved Sanctified and filled with the Holy Ghost Mary's one of them she was saved before she even conceived Jesus by the Holy Ghost because once she found out she said oh I rejoice in God my savior I'm already saved Hallelujah under the blood of bulls and goats I'm already saved hallelujah amen so we believe she's probably a teenager around 15 or 16 right and then she got to go through 30 some more 30 or 33 years of Jesus's life so she's 48 she's around 48 47 445 I'm still 43 brother so think about that Mary was older than me and still have the Holy Ghost well if I've got it I ought to act like it amen I ought to enjoy it praise God hallelujah I ought to keep the word of God in my heart Hallelujah that's what church is good for Hallelujah that's what the Holy Ghost is good for thank God Amen Hallelujah so by she's already saved by the time she's 15 but she doesn't get the Holy Ghost for 33 more years that's a long period of sanctification brother William that's a long time walk in the wilderness sister Lena the tipe leaving Egypt Wilderness crossing over Jordan that's a long time around this Wilderness but God's with me every step of the way amen I couldn't even walk unless he was holding my hand Hallelujah I would not have made it amen except he was guiding me constantly amen thank you Jesus amen it's a long time not to have the Holy Ghost Hallelujah by she didn't complain all she did was keep these things pondered them in her heart remember the Bible said also her soul would be pierced through and that was a prophecy of the cross that we read for our text that a fresh thought there let me sa that for the end let me write that down that's pretty good just fresh Revelation well you might not think it's so fresh but to me it's pretty good there we go all right amen thank God uh I'm gonna have to uh shorten this up I was telling Zur I was going to preach on eating the book uh eating the book uh because we've been looking at that so I kind of prepared some on that but I'm going to save that for maybe Wednesday by God's grace because I need to close this up it's already 12 by God's grace now let's finish up with Mary here now we're in Luke yes that's right Luke 2 he must be about his father's business now I want to just point this out too just for our church you know Jesus is in the temple and he the Bible said he's just asking questions and hearing them and giving understanding answers sound familiar like a questions and aners Sunday night service with the kids and that was God's business see because the Bible said he had to grow what he had to grow in wisdom and spirit and favor with man and God you see there are seasons where we learn we grow in knowledge and understanding and that is God's business Hallelujah that is God's business there's a time for that Jesus went through that so I like that that just spoke to me about ourchurch Jesus increased in wisdom and stature Luke 252 and favor with God and man amen hallelujah all right now let me get down to this closing part here now this may be five or 10 15 we'll we'll see and then if I sing it maybe half an hour we'll see now I'm going to go back to the uh let's go back to John 20 21 John 21 yeah I'm just placing that I just seen that scripture I want to put a mark there all right so back to my text here have you enjoyed the word of God today it's John 19 I'm sorry John 19 and I didn't read the quote but brother Bram said Mary was had virgin Faith he said now she was naturally virgin he said but she had virgin Faith with just means pure Faith another way to say it is unfeigned Faith the Bible says in other words I'm not pretending about this I'm not trying like we said on wedn I'm not trying to pump myself I'm not trying to believe I just believe because it was revealed to me amen the Father the Father in Heaven Jesus said the Father which is in heaven has revealed it unto you Hallelujah and the Gates of Hell cannot Prevail against us hallelujah because of the power of Revelation Hallelujah once it's unveiled once it's made known well you see it it's plain no doubt about it Hallelujah you can't be talked out of it Hallelujah God revealed it to me it's John 19 sorry I keep saying the wrong word John 19 and now we see there in verse 25 we see at the foot of the cross there's a beautiful song about that the the foot of the cross who's left all these men Peter said I'll never leave you even if they kill me I'll never leave you all these big Burly there it is man TI again all these masculine males all this strong part of the the Believers they weren't there at the cross they said they would be see why God needs a weaker part too God needs a he needs a contrast am he needs strength he needs weakness the weak ones actually went with him to the cross and they're the first ones there on the resurrection morning amen hallelujah praise God Amen the weaker ones not the stronger ones the weaker ones were there just something to consider Saints in other words if you're weak don't feel bad because you're weak God's got a plan for you if you're strong don't boast about it amen the Bible said don't boast if you're the Gentile Branch well we're grafted in and don't boast because you'll be cut off so we see there Jesus his mother his mother's Sister Mary the wife of cleopas and Mary Magdalene I love what the Bible says about Mar Mary Magdalene she had seven demons but then the Bible said Jesus cast them out and Jesus healed her I just love that you can have Seven Devils you can have all kinds of demonic activity but Jesus comes to heal his his children oh amen I don't care if it's one devil two Devils three four five six seven Jesus heals from all demons hallelujah hallelujah he can heal broken lives amen he restores broken lives Hallelujah he can heal the deepest hurts Hallelujah because that's why he's here amen he's God Almighty Hallelujah he's Jehovah Gyra Hallelujah you can heal someone who's been filled by seven demons and and then look you'll love him so much you'll go with him to the Garden you'll go with him to the Cross Hallelujah that song I'll go with him to the Garden I'll go with him to the Judgment amen that's what she does because she's been healed Hallelujah so if you're healed you'll go to the Cross as well too Hallelujah if Jesus touched you you'll go there as well amen thank you Lord and when Jesus therefore saw his mother and the disciples was standing by whom he loved he said on his motherwoman Behold thy son now Church what spoke to me about this is that the Bible says in 1 John 318-19 my little children let us not love in word neither in tongue but in deed and in truth in other words it's easy to say I love you or something like that but John says Show Your Love with your actions and hereby we know that we are of the truth and shall assure our hearts before him so that's how we can get Assurance in our lives is we actually do the works of Love instead of just talking about love right so as much as we see possible the Bible said do good to them that be of the household of faith right here amen got all these opportunities to be good to the household of faith Hallelujah we take it we try to take advantage of it by the grace of God and that's how our hearts get blessed at Assurance because we know we're loving whom God has sent to us just like that man mistreating his wife there and Malachi he ain't gonna have any blessings right God sent him that wife and he's supposed to honor that wife and love that wife and so God's going to fight against him until he repents Hallelujah he's got love in in deed and in truth hallelujah now I want to read what Albert Barn says about this uh he says woman behold th son now First Look he addresses first to his mother he says woman behold your son now no doubt he does this because Jesus knows Mary you're losing me so I'm going to give you a replacement hallelujah how many you know whenever God takes something away he adds something to you oh hallelujah praise God Amen that little boy gave his fish and his bread he got all those baskets back Hallelujah a lot of leftovers amen you give something to God God's going to give it back to you Hallelujah that's right but first he addresses her says this is your son Hallelujah so first goes to him and then he says to the disciple Behold thy mother I like what Albert Barn says he says one who is to be thee as a mother the fact that she was the mother of Jesus would secure the kindness of John and the fact that she was now entrusted to him demanded of him affectionate regard and tender care so Jesus is entrusting to the mother a son and then the son a mother Jesus is restoring this broken family ah and where is he doing it from from the cross ah what restores your broken family the cross of Jesus Amen the blood of Jesus Christ the Forgiveness of Christ the mercy of Christ that's what restores every family hallelujah oh my she was losing a son I'm giving you one back amen hallelujah this is what the cross does it restores our families Hallelujah like I've told you before I've got siblings that they won't forgive my dad but to me they got to go to the Cross by God's grace they need a closer and I just say that with all the love of my heart they just need a closer walk with the Lord right because if you can't forgive somebody then God will won't forgive you and it's got to be a love it's got to be a forgiveness in word indeed on or indeed not just word that's what I'm trying to say forgive me in deed and in action and not in word only we can't say I forgive this person and then not act upon it we've got to act upon it Hallelujah sometimes I look out and I say thank the lord they're receiving it praise God God told Jeremiah don't look at their faces but I'm glad I can look at your faces that's I receiv receiving it by God's grace Hallelujah Albert Barnes went on to say from that hour Jesus I'm sorry John seems to have been in a better circumstance than the other Apostles financially that's according to John 18:16 let me read that that's what Barnes say but Peter stood at the door without then went out that other disciple which was known unto the high priest and spake unto her that kept the door and brought in Peter so I'm not sure about that one I want to read this too now Albert Bar says tradition in the church says that Mary continued to live with John in Judea until the time of her death which occurred about 15 years after the death of Christ Hallelujah is that awesome God looked at Mary she's got a window look at this window she's got a decade and a half she's don't have a husband nobody to provide for so Jesus God uses Jesus say you've lost me but I'm giving you a son and he's got the means to take care of you for the last 15 years of your life Hallelujah 15 is that interesting 15 like Hezekiah got 15 more years interesting of course Mary was in the perfect will of God we believe interesting that God gives that 15 more years there Hallelujah now John Gil said about this he said Jesus said John take care of her provide for her as if she was thine own mother this shows the tenderness of Christ who had nothing to leave her though he was Lord of all think about that he's Lord of Heaven and Earth what would he leave to the mother that that bore him not a million dollars because that's that that's not a real love he left her a son who's going to have the Holy Ghost amen what the best thing God could give you a husband or a wife or a child with the Holy Ghost amen my Hallelujah he's the Lord of Heaven the lord of the creation and he gives her a son hallelujah oh our children are so valuable to us like Haven sometimes she'll come in there and she'll say Daddy before service daddy hears a scripture I'm like I really needed that scripture thank you H God gives us now all my children are a blessing to me but that's just one example like when a case she read the church book I'm like that's my girl Malachi he'll just play a song where won't even practice that that's my son how hallelujah praise God he's willing to let himself be embarrassed to show to worship God and help his dad thank you buddy for being embarrassed for my sake appreciate that I don't plan everything out very well not much of a planner that's what my wife puts up with me too but he's the Lord of Heaven and Earth and what what would he give his mother a son who's got the Holy Ghost what's the greatest gift God could give us children with the Holy Ghost how about this friends that have the Holy Ghost a pastor a song leader a piano player amen a family of God who's Born Again Hallelujah who wants the Love In Deed and in truth not just words Mary was probably a widow Gil says by that time Christ had taken care of her and maintained her up until that point but now and here the church this what I want to close on in his dying moments think about that he's only going to utter a few more words and then he's going to die he's going to say two more things according to the the Bible in his third to the final thing he says he's talking about mothers and their children the third to the last thing he says he's concerned about family Hallelujah he's concerned about a son having a mom he's concerned about a mom having a son in the third to last thing he says and church don't forget all the beatings that he went through all he had suffered remember the Bible said his tongue stuck to the roof of his mouth you ever wake up and your mouth is really dry I get that sometimes we can't even touch what Jesus went through and then that's why he cried I thirst I thirst and he' been beaten and been they ripped out his beard and if and his bones were staring at him he was looking down in his ribs and he's bloody and I wonder how he could even see through his eyes remember his face didn't he look like a human looked like a worm the Bible said didn't look like a man and yet with all now look with all his pain with all his torment with all of his persecution he could still think about somebody other than himself God help us amen that's point I want to bring out here isn't it amazing that Jesus Christ three word or three statements before he dies he turns his attention to his mother in the flesh right well not by the flesh but just a caretaker who birthed him she wasn't by DNA his mother that's the point I'm trying to make he turns his care off of his own suffering off of the weight of the world of sin on him not only did he have all this physical he had the spirit spiritual weight of all your sins and my sins on him and the midst of this he looks at John said behold Lo see your mother behold your mother John now he'd also told him he breathed on and said well this was later he said receive the Holy Ghost amen praise God so he's got all these commands from Jesus Jesus knows he can handle it Jesus knows we can handle sermon after sermon command after command word after word because that's what we live by we live by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God hallelujah amen eternal life is living for others he could have been complaining about a situation his bleeding his bones he could have been thinking about all that but he turns his attention to Mary and John eternal life is truly living for others in this third to last statement I love that Hallelujah woman Behold thy son Behold thy mother look John John just didn't let it go in one year out the other the Bible said he took her unto his own home and then Jesus uttered two more things I thirst and it is finished hallelujah how many glad it's finished today hallelujah it's not Easter weekend but I'll say it like this it's still finished Hallelujah the price has been paid you've been bought with the price the blood has been shed your sins are washed away you are forgiven Hallelujah you are purchased possession of God Almighty by the blood of his creative son the Virgin born son of God Jesus Christ Our Lord let's stand to our feet hallelujah amen Behold thy mother I would encourage you as musicians come I thought of this before right before it came out brother Ram tells a story he said when I was a kid he said my mom would slap me in the face because he would talk back to his mom he said she he would fall down he said when I got up she'd smack me again and this would keep repeating until he would not get up anymore this is the kind of parenting brother R was raised with he said many times I taken a meal through a straw because his mouth was so bruised right and brother Ram said and then you know brother Ram said this in another statement and I I'm not supporting abuse I would never support ofuse I've never slapped one of my children I would you should never slap your children I'm trying to show a son's love for his mother that's what I'm trying to show Hallelujah and then brother Ram said my dad would spank me and get out the uh get out his Bell or get out the the the the tree branch and brother R said I didn't get half as many whippings as I deserved brother talk about the pain so brother Ram was physically uh disciplined very harsh ways and brother R he could have held that bitterness in his heart against his mother couldn't he he could have held a bitterness against his father but brother Ram say shortly after he got saved his mom saw such a change in his life that she went to Brother brandom and she said I want to be a Christian too she repented of her sins and he said he baptized her he was one of the first baptisms after his own conversion now think about that the devil could have been there saying oh she's not sincere she never apologized for this she never apologized that but he chose to see God working through his mom now no doubt she probably did repent brother tells a story when he's by the the bedside of his mom as she passed away he said when that poor old thing couldn't even speak no more I said mother I want to commit your soul to God I did my father and I want to commit her soul to God she was lying there she could no more speak I said mother I'm standing here yet you know it if you can bat your eyes and she would bat her eyes I said I want to ask you something now mother you're just a few minutes away now from Death I said I want to stand here to see Jesus come and get your soul I said then I'll commit it to him I said I want to ask you something mother he says now I baptized my mother about 30 years ago and she was filled with the Holy Ghost she was a Christian a real saint of God how many appreciate saints of God and I said mother does Jesus mean right here when you've got maybe five more minutes to live does Jesus just as sweet to you as he was the day you received the Holy Ghost I said mother I want to say this for my own so I can tell others is he just as sweet right now you're my mother you wouldn't tell me anything wrong how many mothers can say Amen to that don't tell your children wrong dads you wouldn't tell your children anything wrong would you you're my mother you would't tell me anything wrong I want to know how you feel right now is he Jesus just as sweet as he was when you received him back Yonder 30 years ago if it is if you can't speak just bat your eyes real fast and she bat her eyes real fast I want to make sure he sees that I still love Jesus now more than anything else Hallelujah isn't that beautiful Hallelujah he said oh brother that's it yes you're not presuming then you know right where you stand that's right oh don't presume about it there's so many different ways just don't presume but God has G A Vindication of his promise see we don't have to presume about it God has Vindicated it and the church said ain't that beautiful I just thought that came that came to my heart right before service no matter what your parents have done to you no matter what anybody in your family's done to you right doesn't matter family member or not when the love of Jesus Christ comes into your heart you want to see someone have their s forgiven just as freely as your sins were given Hallelujah and this last thought was the Bible said Mary's Soul was pierced in Luke 2 I lost all my poll on this I lost all the noise on this one here but I'm still going to preach it anyway I only got one sermon today Luke 235 yay a sword shall pierce through thy own soul also that the thoughts of many hearts be revealed so Mary's there she seeing her son die and her soul is being pierced through imagine you know anyone that's ever had an awful tragic thing happen to him it's like some somebody put a sword through your soul think about the people that have lost children or the people that have lost parents and just unexpected manners and tragic accidents it's like their souls been pierced it's so hard to get over in that moment Mary is seeing the piercing of her own soul it's like a part of me but then from the cross Jesus says son behold your mother I'm restoring you a son Hallelujah God's taking me away but I'm giving you a son God was so mindful and although her soul was pierced 50 days later her soul would be filled that's what I want to say amen hallelujah praise God amen glory see no matter what happens to our soul the pains that we go through there's still a baptism of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and brother Ram said if God wouldn't let Mary into heaven without receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost he said what about you and I amen how many appreciate the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah though our soul our mind has been heard and we've gone we've had scars Hallelujah despite that God said I'll fill your soul with something sweeter than life eternal life Hallelujah my thank God I'll send the spirit of my son into your hearts whereby you cry ABA father let's bow our heads how many enjoy the Mother's Day today I'm just glory amen that meant a lot to me Hallelujah though her soul was pierced through with pain God said I'll feel that Soul I'll feel it I'll heal that amen I'll hear that yes there'll always be a scar there there always be pain but I'll give you such Joy it'll be joy unspeakable and full of Glory father God in heaven we thank you for today Lord God what a wonderful day to reflect on how use mothers in the scripture Behold thy mother you said behold thy son lord it's beautiful to see even from the cross in the midst of your own pain you were still looking at others to be a high priest unto them to provide what they have need of Lord God no wonder the scripture says we have pain for night but joy comes in the morning Mary's Joy would come three days later and then the even the fullness of it would come Hallelujah 47 more days later to the 50th day Pentecost hallelujah thank God lord your Prophet said Mary danced and screamed and shouted spok in tongues like everybody else Hallelujah then she had 15 years to live in the power of the baptism of the Holy Ghost hallelujah thank God that we can live under your power live under your spirit live under the anointing of the Holy GH ghost in our souls Lord God that'd be the greatest Mother's Day gift any mother could receive any woman and for father for Father's Day the greatest gift any of us can ever receive is the soul that's filled sealed quickened by the Holy Ghost hallelujah thank you Jesus Glory we thank you Lord God for your word today Lord God thank you for the songs of zign Lord God thank you Lord God for this atmosphere we're worshiping in Lord God lord I believe you you spoken to the hearts of the people Lord God in only the way you can for Lord you you're the only one who

be a people that are people of action and not just people of words Lord God let us be a people of action Lord Jesus [Music] so we thank you for today Lord bless our mothers maybe we'll say a special prayer for them in a just a moment in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said I just want to see if anyone needs prayer more than welcome to come here we'll see if anyone needs prayer if not then I

before he was born it was five but she' get every one of those up and most church Sunday most Sundays we late for church I we always walked in the last monthes but she got us to church Hallelujah she sent me messages and she sent my wife a nice message this week just saying how much she appreciates our service for the Lord and all that we do for Jesus is eternal praise God and I'm grateful for a mother and every day she'd pray for us before we went to school every day she'd do that my dad wasn't working maybe at the time but it just meant to me meant something to me when my brother Paul so he's the one sleeping there he's the one that sent me this picture and he said did you know this is the last picture that we had together and I said no I didn't know that before the divorce I thought wow Satan's tried to rip that picture apart but God Specializes on bringing things together Hallelujah so I just thought I'd share that with you just to see how this is a faith of my mother the faith that was in my mother can I just zoom in I don't know if I can zoom with earrings on the faith of my mother is still alive in my heart today because it's faith in Jesus Christ daily prayer going to
