Church age tonight part 9 I believe you I believe is part 9 by God's grace Revelation chapter 3 verse 8 so yesterday I finished reading the chapter some I'm at page 319 in the church age book so almost done with that by God's grace and as I read I just highlighted and wrote down the things that I felt would be inspiring to say so trusting will be a blessing to you tonight by God's grace revelation 3:18 sorry not I'm sorry not 3:18 I'm sorry 3/8 par me relation 3/8 relation 3/8 praise God okay Revelation 3:8 we look at the open door tonight I probably finished this tonight maybe on the thought on the open door but then there's a few other thoughts we want to look at here's for the rest of this series here by God's grace amen let's read verse 8 together one two three I know thy works behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou hast a little strength and has kept my word and has not denied my name amen let's have a word of Prayer getting on your heart just making known unto the Lord here as we go before the Lord in prayer Abba Father and heaven o God we come reverently again worshiping you loving your Lord to become to the height of the service Lord for your word to be preached Lord may you use me as a vessel to preach may you use the Saints Lord as receptacles O God to hear the word of God help me to hear it as well Lord God and may have an instant application in our lives here tonight Lord and if you should Terry tomorrow and this week Lord God may the word be so quickly applied to our lives as we saw on Sunday may we forgot forget Lord we look into this mirror of the word maybe we not forget Lord what it's telling us we must become Oh God may we remember that Lord God and father let these truths law be written upon the fleshly tables of our heart we're thankful for what you've shown us through this series O God and I pray you just continue to reveal yourself in a great way tonight in Jesus Christ's name and the Saints said Amen god bless you bein seated praise God let's look at us here tonight so we appreciate the saints come in a house the Lord tonight as a set on a really cold night by the grace of God you can switch over when you're ready children I do have some slides I'd like to show with or show everybody this week by God's grace you know not having to work I've had a lot more time to study and pray and everything so on the home page here's our church's home page I put a little link you can see all the videos there scrolling through and I just updated the revelation 1 so if I click on that one okay let me go there ok takes you to the page that has all the videos on the book of Revelation so this week I got two videos done and thanks for the thumbs up Adam I appreciate that on on Facebook I'd only get like one or two thumbs up because people don't really probably agree with what we believe or maybe they just don't pay attention on Facebook that's okay I know it's helping people on YouTube I know that cuz I get I get I just got three or four testimonies today like keep making these videos you know they're such a blessing so that first one's ready and then chapter one two three four and this week I got chapters six and seven done so those are really nice to get done so just so you know that link is on there for the the YouTube videos by the grace of the Lord also our church page our my personal page if we zoom in there we got twenty two thousand two our 68 subscribers and over a quarter million views so we're glad to get up glad to increase on that by God's grace and make up in the Bible still number one got seventy eight thousand and then it's got sixteen thousand on somebody else took my video and this has it on their page and they got sixteen thousand sir almost said almost had a hundred thousand for that video so I just want to thank the Lord for that people were just email me or texted me today saying all this meant so much to me this video right here so we're very thankful for that one thing's for sure you cannot destroy God's truth and when we make just these simple videos there I make them you know and I post them there Satan will never be able to stop the truth of God it is going to get to every seat of God that needs to hear it and so like we'll see tonight where look at some of the missionaries from the Philadelphia Church you're actually one in particular but we'll see that no matter how how it seemed like they struggled God was in it amen God was saving souls in the midst of it and God was going to plant and use that those efforts of the missionaries and use the efforts of the preachers to bring forth more souls into the kingdom of God so we're just trying to do that by God's grace like I said share the Word of God here and thank you asking God to direct it to every path every person that needs to hear the message of the hour now you and I received it most of us through Bible studies right but there are some of us that may have received it through the internet like maybe brother Adam you know through sister but maybe he received it there or maybe he first heard about it through the internet so we want God to use whatever channel he chooses to bring the message to God's people amen so let's look at this here tonight we're on part nine here of this series in part 49 of the overall series and we read our text tonight it was I know thy works behold I have set before thee an open door and no man can shut it for thou hast a little strength and has kept my word and it's not denied my name Amen now I'm gonna skip past that one now I'm gonna try to finish tonight on this thought of the open door there was so much in the 1960's sermon like I said he spent almost an hour and a half just on the open door thoughts and so tonight I want to try to finish on the open door and then next time we'll keep going into some more of the thoughts like the reward and the promise to the believer all the promises so let's start with this here the Prophet said now getting back to the open mission of door of the Philadelphia Church age it did not have the open door power it ought to have had notice in the same verse he mentions this open door he says thou has a little strength that's right the power of the Spirit was missing in that age I mean oh John Wesley had some miracles right we know some another gentleman had miracles but as a whole the power of God was missing the Word was well preached it was well able to make Souls wise unto salvation but the great power of God that showed forth his mighty works that made bear his arm in behalf of his own was missing except amongst the scattered groups yet praise God it was growing and had increased over what they had in the Reformation how many can say praise God for that God was starting to restore remember in the Sardis Church age was Luther's church age brother Branham said that dead stock or that dead plant went to seed in the seed brought forth and brought forth the stock right and then that was Luther's age of stock and then now we're getting some leaves with Wesley hallelujah but praise God it's growing how many can say thank God the Word of God is growing in my life remember brother Graham said never judge yourself by how many miracles you do but judge yourself by how much fruit of the Spirit you're presently producing so you see your life producing forgiveness producing long-suffering producing patience producing love amen if you see yourself producing these things then we ought to praise God for that because it's important see it was growing and increased over what they had in the Reformation now remember I showed this a couple weeks ago no one was here except Malachi and Lydia's I don't know who was able to watch this but I just wanted to give a little visual this was the age of the open door Satan married Satan married the church and state and Pergamos and the Prophet said God gave them three ages because everything's finished in threes but then in this Philadelphia age now they now Jesus gets the open door right because he gets these last two ages to fully open the door of the word of the name of God who he is all the strength of God the power of God the the revelation of the Godhead that's the open door because Jesus said I am the door amen so we know we're a part of this and are our last ages the continuation of the Philadelphia Church age and I just again have this little sorry I don't mean to keep going over that but Luther Wesley there's where their lives overlap there's brother branham's day here's what I want to get to brother Branham said the open age open door age continues until the rapture so it starts in Wesley's day and it continues to our day now I want to look at this missionary named William Carey I'm never read anything about his life anyone know okay so this is all new praise God I think you appreciate his testimony it was in this age the Philadelphia Church age that the man we often call the father of missions went out William Carey a village shoemaker who Pass heard the peculiar Baptist Church of at Moulton England mightily aroused the people by preaching on whether the command was given to the Apostles to teach all nations was not a blah blah I'm sorry obligatory on all succeeding ministers to the end of the world seeing that accompanying promise was of equal extent amen now he started his ministry kind of right after John Wesley died if you look at his we look at his life span next from 1761 to 1834 so he was actually reading the writings of John Wesley and being inspired by the messenger of the hour aren't you glad that we can be inspired by the messengers of our hour I'm sorry the messenger rather of our our brother Branham through the power of the Holy Ghost we can read his sermons just like William Carey was reading the sermons of the messenger of his hour John Wesley praise God and that ought to inspire us and that's what inspired me to make all those teaching videos you know that that now have over a quarter million views what inspired me was that I thought everybody deserves a chance to hear the message of the hour and it was my burn and I said if my family and I said if my family and friends won't come to church maybe at least they'll watch it on YouTube right that was my burden everybody needs to hear this and and so I didn't I didn't feel like to travel overseas at that time so I said well I'll just sit down and make some teaching videos and I'm glad to see God using them but that's the inspiration I got from brother Branham because brother Branham said it's not fair that people get to hear the message over and over and then people overseas only get to hear at one time or maybe they don't get to hear so we want to give the opportunity for people to hear the word of God now I says he was fought by the Calvinists who had gone to the extreme of the doctrine of election believing that all who will be saved will be saved and missionary work would be against the work of the Spirit can you imagine the stiff starchy people that he faced can you imagine they're like oh you don't to go overseas oh just stay here and just serve God here you don't have to sacrifice you have to go out there and preach in other words you have to go to on the streets you have to send missionaries Oh God's going to save whoever he wants and he had to go against that demon in the name of Jesus amen he had to go against that lying spirit I would say all you it's not for you we don't need to do all that we don't we have to put our lives on the line and I'm guaranteed and well you know it by history that many souls were saved because of this man's ministry amen think about that if he would just believed all the discouraging evil spirits and said just make your life easy make your life as simple and as easy and as luxurious as possible but he went against that grain because he had the leadership of the Holy Spirit amen to see Church we should look at our lives and say alright what's our real goal in life is it to make our lives easier or to try to win a soul for Jesus we have to we have to order our lives and he literally changed his life in order to save stalls and you and I should have the same thing at some point we should have put more money into missions or or do something have some type of ministry that's what I'm gonna try to get to at the end have do something have some type of ministry to try to do something for Jesus amen now he saw the father of missions and he was live from 73 years from night 1761 to 1834 and he was a missionary to India so just get that picture in your mind there of this fella here William Carey mighty man he the father of missionaries to India and he's actually called the father of the modern missionary movement because he actually left England there and I went into India and so we'll learn a little bit about that he said but Andrew fuller helped mr. Kerry by his preaching and fundraising so he got help fundraising such was there effect that a society was formed to spread the gospel to all nations in 1792 this society sent out Kerry who signally blessed of God and winning souls in India in 1795 and aroused Christianity formed the London Missionary Society which went which we well know raised millions of pounds and sent thousands of missionaries over the years to accomplish desires of the Lord the Spirit of God was moving another sheep might well have been the cry of the heart of those earnest believers now this guy has quite a testimony he was he moved to India 30 to 2 years old and this was after a prayer meeting when he was 19 he was 19 years old the history says he walked in the prayer meeting he started pray and he said God to touch his heart and gave his heart to Lord a 19 years old and then he started being a shoe cobbler first he was fixing the shoes and then he became a little higher in society became a shoemaker and then he started attending the church and after he got saved of course and then pretty soon they invited him to preach so they must have saw something his life about preaching and then pretty soon he just had a burden he'd read the scripture and he had this burden too to want to win souls so he kept writing these letters and and pretty soon he wrote like a book we called her a pamphlet he wrote a book about the need to go overseas and it started gaining some steam and getting some support and so at 32 he moved to India as wife didn't want to go first she was pregnant but he kind of talked her into it and she went along with him now when he got there he experienced many many hardships these are just a few of them the death of some of his children his children got sick the death of some of the missionaries he was working with but the thing that was great that was beautiful about it as soon as one of them died he would send backward and they would send another missionary see they were fully committed to the work Amen now how many people do we know that are willing to go today there's not many the harvest is plentiful but the laborers are few right but see that's one thing when they caught the vision of that open door age they really got behind it they prayed about it and as soon as one man would fall they'd send another amen yes and that's kind of how it is that real Churches of God when somebody leaves the office or when someone leaves or something like that there's somebody step in there and take the position hey man just like on a sports team you know they say when somebody gets hurt what do they say next man up you heard that saying before how do they say they say no in sports all the time you know or they call it reload that's what they call they've got to reload the gun and and we're gonna fire again because that's that's how successful they are they just know they can reload and they've got the same result well that's how God's army is amen hallelujah brother and there's a cult brother band said if a man of God won't do God's will I'm just paraphrasing and preached in a certain place but a man who said God will raise up somebody else to do it amen because God's will is going to be accomplished hallelujah for example like if I want to preach here in a car and guess what God would raise up somebody else same hand and there's hungry souls to come and hear the Word of God God will raise up somebody else because God is gonna is plan is gonna be accomplished amen nothing can port the plan of all 90 God hey man now what was sad though some of it some of his opposition was incredibly hard his wife didn't want to go to India so what happened was she had numerous mental breakdowns and even went insane by the end of her life and the history without what I was reading there on the website said that he the friends told him you know send her to an institution you know she would just go and spell she lost her mind she lost her kids the conditions and any were so bad it just she wasn't ready for it and then suffered with diseases and like I said children dying she had met many mental breakdowns but he had to put it put up with that and we stayed in a loving way you know he we wouldn't send her away he kept her there at the home and and he dealt with that their printing presses burned down on numerous occasions for six months they wouldn't be able to print the gospel tracts and and print out the truth he translated the New Testament can you imagine the entire New Testament he translated in numerous languages and dialects and then he even translated the Old Testament because the people in India didn't have it in their language so he had a burden one man had a burden and the people saw he had a burden and they backed him up and supported him praise God they raised all the money back home in England and they sent it over to him to support him and he was there labouring laboring and the history said he believed he was there some 48 years and never took one furlong they said or one vacation a real man not there's anything wrong with vacation but he was fully devoted to the work God called him to do over there an Indy founded the College for a Christian college and then even helped write a dictionary end of his life to help these Indians to know what words meant in the English and this is the beautiful part out of all these 40 I believe 43 years in India at the end of his life that counted 700 converts to Christianity Amen hallelujah did God know what he was doing Church how many would be happy to get a tenth of that I'd be happy to get 70 souls 1 right I mean what a wonderful man of God the father of missionaries and our brother Samson Shetty told me that is now around us a million some Christians in India well this man was the first one to take it there hey man and let's see God bless those 700 sold and what do we got now over a million Christians in India see how God will multiply our efforts for the kingdom of God but we got to be willing to do our part no matter how small no matter how difficult we must be willing to do our part I'm willing to do my part by God's grace hey man I trust you are too now this reminded me because my Bible reading this morning I read a chapter in every morning every night my Bible reading this morning was 2nd Corinthians 11 so let's go there I just want to go over Paul sufferings again if you haven't read this in a while you'll be blessed Paul was in actually church he used the word boast he was trying to boast on what he had suffered for the kingdom of God and he was trying to prove to the Corinthian church that he was not a minister of Satan but he was a true man of God and the way he showed it was through all the things that he suffered for the gospel you and I when we suffer it's difficult right but we have to go through the suffering that proves we are who we are amen now you know verses 1 2 & 3 are very familiar with us because they deal with Eve and how he how she was beguiled from the truth and lost her virginity what the scripture tells us there he's like him do it in verse 2 now in verse 4 Paul tells us there people are coming preaching another Jesus that Paul did not preach look at verse 5 but I suppose I was not a whit behind the very chiefest apostles and brotherman took it a first step further and said he was the greatest missionary praise God he said I don't believe I'm the least bit behind the very chiefest of apostle we say Peter with the keys right I was not a little bit behind him and brother Brahim said Paul was even a greater missionary than Peter look at verse 6 I like this but though I be rude in speech how many sometimes listen to brother branham and thought that's pretty rude that's hard to understand my wife and I were talked about that that might be hard for some languages to interpret some of his stories some of his words on his kentucky dialect his terminology right is vocabulary from tucky kentucky right see Paul was rude in speech he wasn't the most eloquent man right but yet not yet not in knowledge but we have been through Lee made manifest among you in all things amen even though it wasn't the smoothest talker God made manifest to you that I was a true man of God that's what he's saying look at verse 7 have I committed an offence in abasing myself that I might be exalted because I preached to you the gospel Christ reading look what he says I robbed other churches and of course he doesn't mean robbed or steal but I robbed other churches taking wages them to do you service Paul is trying to show how much he loves them he's saying I'm not a false preacher he said I took from other churches I took the offerings and I gave them to you see how we try to prove that we love each other we try to give each other things because we love each other and if you love somebody you want to help them amen especially of the household of God the Bible said the Bible said we should especially do good to those of the household of faith you should be especially good to one another here at Bride of Christ fellowship amen that's exactly right number two skip down a little bit here look at verse 10 he's now verse 10 he says where he's gonna start boasting now you don't mean brag as a prideful way but he's trying to get them to see all that he has suffered to bring them the gospel look at verse 10 as the truth of Christ is in me no man shall stop me of this boasting in the readings of a ki wherefore because I love you not God knoweth but what I do that I will do that I may cut off occasion from them which desire occasion that we're and they glory they may be found even as we so see he's trying to they're trying to put a bad name on Paul but he said listen this is I'm glorying and what Christ has done in me now look at verse 13 here's the deception of Satan for such are false apostles deceitful workers transforming themselves into the apostles of Christ and no Marvel for Satan himself is transformed into an angel of light therefore it is no great thing if his ministers so see Satan's preachers are also called ministers right they're servants we're going to serve one of the other I want to serve the Lord Jesus Christ Prince are actually called ministers of Satan he said as the but he said what if his ministers also be transformed as the ministers of righteousness whose end should be according to their works see they look like they're righteous they look like they're bringing the light but Paul says you'll know them by their works and Jesus said you'll know them by their fruits amen how do they have the fruit of the Spirit or is it corrupt fruit that's how you know you look at their works what is their life producing what the kind of life do they live that's how you know now I believe by God's grace I'll say like this I'm happy that I learned the gospel from a real man of God brother Brooks and brother Craig there are true men of God their works have shown that they're not interested in money women or popularity they're interested in the Word of God and I've tried to model my life exactly like them amen hallelujah look at verse 16 I say again let no man think me a fool of other wise yet as a fool received me that I may boast myself a little so look he said I'm gonna boast a little now this is not prideful understand he's not being prideful he's trying to get them to see his works amen now as we read this list think about what works you suffered you might have suffered the loss of a job for Christ you might have suffered the loss of family you might have suffered the loss of friends you might have suffered the loss of different relationships or or perks or privileges but look at how much he lost this is a real man of God amen look at this verse let's go down to verse 18 seeing that many glory after the flesh our glory also now of course they were glorifying probably money they're probably glorifying they're a number of the size of their churches or their size of their money but Paul said I'm gonna glory let me tell you what my flesh has been through for the gospel verse 19 for ye suffer fools gladly seeing yourselves are wise Oh high for ye suffer if a man bring you into bondage of a man devour you if a man take you if a man exalt himself of men smite you on the face I speak as concerning reproach as though we had been weak howbeit we're in soever Enya's boat I speak foolishly I am bold also are they Hebrews so my are the Israelites oh my are they the seed of Abraham so am I so see all these false apostles have all the same qualifications seemingly as Paul but Paul's trying to say watch their works the false apostles will corrupt your minds they'll take you from a life of righteousness and they'll they'll teach you to walk in unrighteousness they'll teach you to love sin rather than teach you to love the word that's right verse 23 are they ministers of Christ I speak as a fool I am more I hear here we go in Labor's more abundant in stripes above measure in prisons more frequent in deaths oft now we're just getting started so let's stop right there he labored more than everybody he got stripes on his back he got whipped for being a Christian he labored as a Christian and he was in prison frequently my goodness can you imagine following a preacher like that he's constantly in prison while they do it in Iran all right they do it over some of these other other countries their preachers get put in prison now look at verse 24 of the Jews five times received I forty stripes save one five times thrice was i beaten with rods once I was stoned thrice I suffered shipwreck look at this a night in a day I we've been in the deep so he's probably hanging on to a part of the ship or a piece of wood for a whole night in a day I think your arms would get tired after a while trying to stay afloat so you don't drown but yet he did that why'd he do all this for the Gospels sake to try to win souls to try to stay alive write more letters encourage the churches he's trying to show them I'm not in this for the money women in popularity I'm in this because Jesus called me to this amen in journeyings often she didn't get to stay in one place in perils of waters he had trouble in the water in perils of robbers constantly getting robbed in perils my own countrymen in perils by the heathen in perils in the city in perils in the wilderness in perils in the sea in perils among false brethren people that say their message believers but they're really not they just get you in trouble watch the people around you see if they get you blessings or see if they get you in trouble then you'll know if they're real brethren or if they're false brethren amen in weariness and painfulness in watchings often in hunger and thirst I like this in fastings often in cold and nakedness this sounds like a luxurious life does this sound like the TV preachers who have their own Jets or one of them even have his own airport he has his own Airport yeah it's the International and Airport of so-and-so and when he got in his jet an airport he took his jet out and he flew it across as his congregation clapped Oh church that's so sad this guy was the real man of God was beating all the time put in jail constant weariness constant painfulness constant hunger thirst think about the hundreds of millions of dollars that could have been used to feed the poor so to buy that jet plane think about that and actually the next jage book if you read it the next part is the false Jews they say they're Jews and they're not and brother branham goes through the spirit of Judas how it's all after the money so that's what we're at next after this one it's all after the money and brother Ram says it's going for big churches and big this and big that and all these kind of big things Paul was not that way remember at the end he said go get my one coat memory tone he told Timothy he said bring my coat with you one coat look at this verse 28 now this verse 28 is going to apply to look at our next preacher we're looking at Charles Spurgeon in a few minutes but look at verse 28 beside those things which are without that which cometh upon me daily the care of all the churches can you imagine he went through all these troubles and then he'd get a letter he get a messenger and said oh the church at Philippi needs this oh the church in Jerusalem needs this oh the church at Rome they need more food or or they need clothes or or the pastor's over at a class that got locked up in prison and all these weights and all these burdens are on his heart can you imagine now we can I guess we can relate in one way because if you're on Facebook or if you do text with people or and you get prayer requests from around the world how many how many see those you know someone will die here so someone's in jail they're like that's how it is on Facebook you get all kinds there's all kinds of Prayer and it just seems like we're overloaded right there's there's times would just seem like there's all kinds of requests that's just a simple that's a small taste of what the Apostle Paul went through and now as we'll see Charles Spurgeon East's at least I think 60 churches or 60 groups he was constantly caring about every single day trying to meet their needs I think he said he got 500 letters a week can you imagine I don't even get 500 emails a week and he wasn't typing them off like on our iPads like we had today he was hand writing letters back to all these people 500 a week now Paul of course would had a greater burden a greater ministry because he was the messenger for the Aged so see upon all these physical problems robbers shipwrecks beatings print imprisonment all these things on top of all that he had to care for all the churches as well so I felt really encouraged that for this I feel like I I felt like I had a lot to think about but I really don't I don't really have much compared to this now look at verse 29 who was weak and I'm not weak so which of these preachers are saying all my life is hard Paul saying my life's hard who's offended and I burn not Paul saying I'm get offended if I must needs glory how a glory of the things which concern my infirmities my struggles see my struggles prove I'm a true man of God you know why because the spirit Antichrist hates the Spirit of Christ and the spirit of Antichrist wants to kill the real true spirit of Christ amen but what Ishmael wanted to Ishmael was mocking and making fun of Isaac and that's what Paul picks it up and says see that spirit hates the true spirit of God and so we have to go through trials and tribulations people aren't gonna like us but we've got to stay on the beaten path of the gospel amen they're not gonna like us because of what we believe and how we live look at verse 31 the God and father of our Lord Jesus Christ which is blessed for evermore knoweth that I lie not in Damascus the governor under artists the king kept the city of de Matt I'm sorry damascena with the garrison desirous to apprehend me oh my so even the king said a garrison around the city and but in verse 33 and through a window and a basket was it let down by the wall and escaped his hands a king of a city was trying to lock me in and keep me in the city but God made a way out through the window kind of reminds me about the windows of heaven are being opened amen there's a window escape window he could get out don't you know the Bible said God always gives a way of escape to the believer hey man unless it's your time to go or unless it's your time to suffer God will make a way of escape amen now let's finish up here here I'm sorry let me use this and the next quote is about this part about a college huh me know God used to be in building those colleges how many how many understand that God used to support the seminaries he used to does he do it today most likely not what I mean by that is he might allow a seminary just because the message hasn't got there yet does every understand what I'm trying to say if that's the greatest light they have that might be the only way the message of Christ can be spread in that area so God may use that today until the message of the hour comes let's look at this brother man tells us this then we find out in the next age which was the Reformers age Philadelphia God sent out the wisdom of a man a man like had on the Beast which was the power that went forth in the Reformers did you notice no matter that the people are no wonder that the people these days still living a hangover like it wasn't the Reformers age because they just seen the ecclesiastical way of looking at it they seen it in the way that the seminaries had been taught that was God's Way at one time but we've live a past that that does that help you out building a college William Carey building a cow's Charles Spurgeon having a college named after him that was God's Way at one time but we've lived a past that hey men all right now let's look at the next thought here I want to get more into this this wisdom of man and then we'll look at Charles Spurgeon here now brother man I'm close to the scripture here I believe it's revelation 3:9 now it's a little strength that has kept my word and it's not denied my name now we've already mentioned how the strength was returning it was the power of the Inquisition had waned how many matter what the Inquisition was the Roman Catholic Church would enquire people if they had any suspicions about them going against the Roman Catholic Church they could arrest you on the spot and they could take you in and ask you questions and they would torture you look it up on Wikipedia look it up in the encyclopedia they could torture you or to try to get answers out of you if they thought you said anything against the Roman Catholic harlot system that was the Inquisition it reached its height in the twelfth century so around 1100 AD so not really that long ago not read that long ago that's when it reaches height but now that was 1180 now we're at you know the 1700 right at 1800 so this is about you know 600 or 700 years later the power of the Inquisition Inquisition had waned people left their home and demanded a freedom of worship the yoke of the hierarchy was being broken the governments are finding it wise not to champion one segment against another in fact well-meaning but poorly led people were fighting were willing to wage war to defend their religious rights do you see that at one time God was behind the men and women fighting for their religious rights God was behind that just like the pilgrims right just like just like George Washington and and all these founding fathers that fought and had all these armies and wars oh my all the wars that we our country has gone through God was behind it in one way I say like this it was the permissive will of God in order to spread the gospel amen perhaps the greatest show strength of religion this age was the fact that though France found revolution the great Wesleyan revival kept the revolution away from what Great Britain and saved her to be an instrument in the hand of God for many glorious years hey man hallelujah now here's where I want to get to as Satan raised up his and listen this isn't a Philadelphia Church age Saint was raising up hordes of free thinkers well I think it's okay if we do this I think it's okay if we do that as the originators of communism rose up as liberal theologians spread their filthy wares God raised up mighty warriors of the faith now listen to this and the greatest works of Christian literature and teaching and preaching came from this era did you catch that the greatest books in Christianity came from the Philadelphia Church age praise God the greatest preaching the greatest amount of preaching took place in the Philadelphia Church age now look what he says next never has it's preachers and teachers been matched and never will they be that's pretty powerful statement isn't it because that includes brother branham's age the Laodicean Church age and that includes myself as a preacher that includes all the preachers right see this so there were so many preachers and the preaching was so so vast that it will never be matched it was so great because it was the beginning of the age of the open door now raise your hand if you heard of these anyone ever heard of the word in the name Spurgeon before no one Lydia okay Mueller no Brainerd Barnes I have Barnes on my computer I read his commentaries Albert Barnes Bishop's I don't know him okay came from this area we're gonna learn about spurge in a moment they preach taught and wrote the word they glorified his name what a compliment you see you see why God is God was blessing these people why was God blessing literature why was God blessing colleges amen why was God blessing books and and all their preaching God was blessing it because they were obedient to the anointing of their our aim ahead hallelujah you see we've got to be obedient to the anointing of our hour amen the flying eagle is program likens under revelation we've got to live the revelation that's been given to us and it's not to build colleges is not necessarily literature it's to manifest the baptism of the Holy Ghost and take the gospel to every nation and getting by preaching the gospel manifests the Living Christ so that others can receive the cry this Christ and live above the things of the world the denominational chicken yards are you with me to live above denominational chicken yards which always produce death but the high high fly above that and live in heavenly places in Christ Jesus hey man glory that's why god bless these people because they accepted it well I've got to have the man anointing I've got to be more wise I've got to do all this books and I've got to make colleges and I've got to do all this god bless them because they accepted 90 you and I must accept our anointing to you amen let's look at the prints of preachers you know they called him that they called him the Charles Spurgeon the Prince of preachers that's his nickname the Prince of preachers so he only lived 57 years so died quite young there he had numerous diseases there attend of his life but he was a pastor and author in London England and you're gonna see some of his words are like Paul's where Paul where the daily cares of the churches came upon some of these men now this gentleman right here was known for his eloquence II in other words people would listen to his ability to talk and his ability to produce the right words and his vocabulary and he was known as a very eloquent man and how many know that's okay huh me ever read about Apollo sin the Bible you read about Apollo's Polo's rich and if you read a read of Apollo same ah okay a couple people have okay let's get your Bibles there let's go let's go to read let's go to acts 19 then acts 18 X 18 now remember what did Paul say Paul said I was rude in speech so was Paul's preaching all fine and dandy and perfect no but Apollo's was the Bible calls Apollo's eloquent and I'm looking up real quick to make sure I got the right scripture yeah X 18 24 now this is what Charles Spurgeon reminded me of Apollo's who would pass through at Ephesus X 18 24 November there are some preachers that are really eloquent my like I could name a few like Dwayne Lawson Danny Reagan you know they they never say one word wrong you know I'm appear say I hope forgive me forgive me you know there's just different kinds and brother branham you know he wasn't his eloquent yes there was times he was a very eloquent sermons no doubt about that but he even admitted he said I'm not much he said I'm not very eloquent but see God has all kinds of right don't you love God's variety see acts 18 24 and a certain junior in Apollo's born in Alexandria an eloquent man and mighty in the scriptures came to Ephesus this man was instructing the way of the Lord and being fervor in the spirit he spake and taught diligently the things of the Lord knowing only the baptism of if you know the story he got these people Church to a real sanctification and that's my desire for everyone in our church who's not fully sanctified I want my preaching to bring them to sanctification and then the baptism of the Holy Ghost and I don't care who God uses to do it I know as a pastor I have to feed the church most often I point them to the sheep food the Word of God history brother Rams message which is the Word of God sheep food for our day but it doesn't really matter you know what my role in it is as far as we just want to see people sanctified and we would as we see people feel what the Holy Ghost because if they get the Holy Ghost they're sealed to the day of their Redemption and they're gonna be a true witness of Jesus Christ in Akron Ohio amen and you have to worry which side are they on their life shows which side they're on amen they're not the followers that the leaders amen they're the pillars of the church amen those that are really born again they're the ones that love God and brother have said if there's only two people there there'll be one of those two that are there in church I don't know yeah there are the pillars they're the ones that you know they're making they're calling election sure praise God so see God has really eloquent men now go to first Corinthians I'm just typing up another scripture I want to show you just as a reminder yeah 1st Corinthians 3 for there you go there it is that's why I appreciate these technology here I can look up the scriptures real fast first Corinthians 3 for now the thing to do is find out which ministry God has placed you under whatever gift it is and and sit under that gift and obey the Word of God under that gift it might be a very eloquent man it might be a man who's rude in speech but the thing to do is make sure they're preaching Jesus Christ amen and they're not a minister of Satan disguised as a minister of light then that's out that's how we must look at their works by their fruits they're known are they preaching a cankered word or is the word rightly divided amen first Corinthians three look at let's just read the whole thing verse 1 and I brethren could not speak on us under spiritual but as unto carnal even as babes in Christ can you imagine Paul could not teach them deep things because they were babies and you know why they were preacher lovers they loved the preachers more than they loved Christ that's when you know if someone's really immature spiritually they can praise every other preacher but not other ones but they fall in love with this preacher but they don't like the other ones see because they're worshiping a man is it a worshipping Christ that right and that shows they're just babies they're not really mature Christians because the mature Christian looks past the man and sees the word look at verse 2 I fed you with milk and not with meat for a hitherto you were not able to bear it neither yet now are you able see he knew they just couldn't handle the preaching for ye are yet carnal for whereas there is among you listen envying strife and divisions are ye not carnal and walk as men so because of their love for man rather than Christ they had envying somebody envied this person or they wanted that person they want to be like that person or one of that person's position or job or calling in the church or something strife divisions arguments amongst believers and Paul said I can't teach you deep things because you argue you fuss too much you send too much you're too spiritually immature I can't teach you deeper things how many want to be a church that God can teach us deeper things I want to go into deeper things I know you do too so we've got to be spiritual we got to forgive and love verse 4 for while one say if I'm appalled look and see that and this is just in their church somebody says well I'm appalled another one says I'm Apollo's and another says what's the next one sorry I lost my spot oh he said are you not carnal verse five who that is Paul who's the Polo's but ministers by whom he believed even as the Lord gave to every man see that God will give every man who wants to be saved a preacher they can sit under can you say amen to that every man God gives a preacher to every man God will send somebody to acronym God knew vague was gonna be here in his family God knew it so we had to send a preacher here just like in Lima God had to send a preacher there because all the believers are just like brother cam God had to send a preacher there in a poignant because he knew there be souls there God has given a ministry to every believer that once one yes look at verse 6 I love this I have planted Apollo's watered but God gave the increase amen let me say like this brother branham Planeta that's actually in the church age book glory that's actually in the sermon the seeds of the spoken words original seed that's actually that sermon brother Branham said there was three seeds plant in the end time he said it was the the true seed and brother barons ministry he said there was the Pentecostal scene which all Roberts planted and then he says there's the evangelical see the Billy Graham seed and now we can see what the seeds produced we can see that the Billy Graham seed produces Reverend people but all the women cut their hair and paint their faces and they all wear pants we can look at the old hobbits and what's that Bruce people that believe in a lot of speaking in tongues big universities or Roberts universities huge millions of millions of dollars but they're after money remember old Roberts sister Connie remember that when Oral Roberts I was I was just a child but he went on TV and said God told me if I don't get five million dollars to build this building he's going to kill me you remember that you can look it up it's on YouTube now Church I don't know if that was God or not but it doesn't sound like it does it sound like it like God's gonna kill me if you don't give me five million dollars that doesn't sound like Christ what did Paul just say Paul said I was constantly in prison I've constantly weak my constant didn't have food I was fasting all the time I had all these bad situations I was going through all these hardships and another man say well you know see you got to send me five million dollars that doesn't sound like God it just doesn't it just doesn't seem like I'm not saying it wasn't but it doesn't fit that cause it fit the nature of God God's humble nature you see that now look at this is why I'm saying brother brand implanted and I'm just watering what he planted can ever say man I'm showing you a breath I'm just trying to share with you why brother Branham talked I'm just trying to water the seeds that he planted as the messenger of the hour look at this I like verse 7 this keeps all of us preachers humble so then neither is he that planteth anything so brother Branham neither he that watereth any other preacher but it's God that gives the increase I'm nothing I'm just watering I'm just I'm just like a gardener out there watering right I'm just the one wanders I got I'm just I just got the hose out there when you drive by one of those places you see a guy with the hose that's just me I'm just I'm just holding the hose I'm just watering but the well even the water won't do nothing it's about that increase from the Sun amen the waters needed the plantings needed but it's all about that Sun quickening that seed amen it's God that gets all the glory amen now he that planteth and he that watereth are one so see all the preachers they all just work together what don't exalt Paul and Peter and Apollo swell my preachers better than your preacher we don't exalt men we exalt Christ he said an every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labor amen now I just was added help by God's grace see there were some really eloquent men this was the most one of the most eloquent preachers there ever was Charles Spurgeon he was a prolific author of many types of works including he wrote sermons he wrote an autobiography he wrote commentaries books on prayer devotionals magazines poetry hymns and more so he at least eight a or more kinds of writing this guy was constantly writing had to glorify Christ here look at his quotes Church look at this just a moment here I got this off a website I'm sorry it's so small don't try to read it the year he turned 40 he delivered a message to his pastors conference with one word title forward he said in every ministers life there should be traces of stern labor brethren do something do something do some well committees waste their time over resolutions is the denominations do something while societies and unions are making khuns constitutions let us win souls too often we discuss and discuss and discuss while Satan only laughs and asleep get to work and quit yourselves like men I like that so he was even trying to rebuke the pastors there he's 40 years old I'm 37 he's at 40 years old he's trying to rebuke these pastors saying do something don't argue about all these types of things try to win a soul for Jesus and here's where was his motivation at the bottom he said meditate on the deep solemnity upon the fate of the lost sinner in other words think about what it would be like if someone went to hell that you knew shun all views of future punishment with or which would make it appear less terrible so anything that would say well hell's not that bad Spurgeon said shun that hell is going to be awful he said and so take the edge off your anxiety to save immortals from the quenchless faith flame think much also of the bliss of the sinner saved and the like holy Baxter dear I've rich arguments from the Saints everlasting rest there will be no fear of your being lethargic if you are continually familiar with eternal realities amen in other words you won't be a lazy Christian if all you're thinking about is getting so saved for eternity so they don't go to hell amen glory my children can they might remember this from Sunday night I was praying at Sunday nights and God it looks like Adam was praying tonight I was saying God save souls I said give us souls like brother vang and I was naming some of your names and all these saints that some come so faithfully the house of God give us souls that will love Jesus Christ with all their hearts that'll serve God here in Akron amen I was praying that at home I don't know if you remember that when I said that children on Sunday night but this is what he's saying give us Souls think about and think about this what if brother vang wasn't here what if brother Adam wasn't here what if sister Connie wasn't here and what if I wasn't here and we're still in the world can you imagine what church would be like without each one of us here we'd be we'd be missing the joy or the strength of another brother and sister in Christ we'd be missing your lick of fire amen right is that right and to see someone going to hell and the imagine that person can you imagine me out in the bar tonight you know cussing and smoking and watching the football game the bowl game tonight or whatever more and maybe divorced three times or can you imagine because some of my uncles are like that my answer like that and that might have been went through my family but now think about the grace of Jesus Christ so aren't you so glad assignment witness to me no way my soul to the message hey now you place your name in there amen it's so blessed it's a blessing thing that you're here and not out at the world thank God for that amen now help us to leave her tonight and praying and saying God help me to save her soul to get them out of the chains of Satan and bring them to the marvelous light of Christ he said this will keep you from being a lazy Christian if you think about how awful hell is and how glorious of me to have that person in the house of God and eternally say by the blood of Jesus Christ the Prince of preachers here's another quote okay now this is where just like Paul in 2nd Corinthians 11 look at this no one no one living knows the toil and care I have to bear it look what Charles Spurgeon said I have to look after the orphanage he had an orphanage I have charge of a church with 4,000 members orphanage 4,000 sometimes there are marriages and burials to be undertaken he said there's a weekly sermon to be revised he too preached one sermon a week the sort of trial that was a magazine to be edited he had to edit his week or magazine I don't know how many times I went up and beside all that a week the average of 500 letters to be answered can you imagine that church orphanage 4,000 people marriages burials I got a news letter and on top of all that 500 letters the top of all that a wife and children and the church said amen Paul said on top of all my beatings and scourge and shipwrecks on top of all that I have all the cares of every church I've started I care so much for them I wanted what their needs to be met one I don't want them to struggle and Charles Spurgeon is saying the same thing this however is only half of my duty for there are innumerable churches established by friends with the affairs of which I'm closely a connected to say nothing of the case of difficulty which are constantly being referred to me to see them some of these preachers or deacons couldn't figure it out let's take it the pastor Spurgeon and he wasn't complaining he's just saying no one knows the toil no one knows the bird and I go through may God help us to be content with the burden that we have because I can't relate to this I went one day I was getting so overwhelmed I said honey look at look at this I've wrote 15 emails today and I was feeling overwhelmed and this guy 500 letters per week so if you do and that was a big day so if I did 15 emails times 7 you can do I can't do the math right now anybody got that I'll just run up 20 to 7 there you go there's 140 the most I have in a week is 140 maximum right and here he's got 500 letters in a week I look at this on his 50th birthday 66 organizations was read that he founded and conducted so he at least went to 66 other churches organizations Lord Shaftesbury was there and said this is a list I'm sorry this list of associations instituted by his genius and superintendent by his care were more than enough to occupy the minds and hearts of 50 ordinary men 4000 members 66 organizations can you imagine the head church now look at this David Livingstone asked them how do you manage to do two men's work in a single day look at his answer you've forgotten there's two of us flower amen hallelujah so sisters like for my wife or sisters with children how can you handle this number of children how can you handle this hockey number that I said you forgot there's two people raising these children there's two people pastoring this church or there's two people are running our home it's not just me he said it's me and Christ it's Christ and me the hope of glory so we don't feel so bad anymore doing about how busy our lives are our lives can't even compare to these lives and this was a member of the greatest age of preachers the greatest age of literature the greatest age of Christian missionary work and he died at 5757 remember brother Bosworth member he didn't even start his ministry his real ministry till 75 did you remember that he went to programs meeting he's already retired pastor he's like I've just enjoyed just just gonna enjoy life he saw that discernment of brother Branham and he hopped on board and preached though he was 84 I think nine more years in ministry and he said those last nine years were greater than all the other years combined because why the prophet of God was there he saw the gift of God he saw that star the star for his age amen he saw the candlestick for his age burning the light of Christ and a man named William Branham he saw that and those nine years with mother Branham were greater than all the other ones combined by now Church why do we go through this because Paul arms are Peter wrote beloved I write unto you to which I both stir up your pure Minds by way of remembrance I want you to remember what Paul went through I want you to remember what William Carey went through and I want to remember what Charles Spurgeon went through and if we can remember what they went through how many would leave here encouraged and say wow they had a lot more to deal with than I did they're busier than I am I can take courage and I can serve Christ with more courage I won't be discouraged I won't complain I won't cause strife and divisions I'll be thankful with a lot God has given me and Lord just helped me to be more faithful with it Eamon I got five minutes here let me oh I'm not gonna be able to this here I was gonna read through a couple more pages let's just go to this one here let's close this let's go to revelation 3:11 I'm gonna close to this I think I get to this in five minutes Oh tonight by God's grace it really encouraged me as I was reading through this praying to this this morning I thought my God he really gave me this at a very appropriate time when I feel overwhelmed or I feel like I got a lot on my plate I look at this and I don't have nothing on my plate I just got to be faithful with what God has given to me that's very little compared to what other men have gone through revelation 3:11 behold I come quickly hold that fast which thou has that no man take thy crown so right around now takes this thought on hold fast hold fast on what you have I'm grateful for what you have spiritually the Bible says you have all spiritual blessings in heavenly places in Christ Jesus all those blessings I'm very grateful for the blessings I have amen now I just got three quotes here we don't need to comment on the thought that he is coming quickly so we don't need to say much about that we know that he's come he is because we are in the end of the last days aren't we but he goes on to say hold fast that what you have that no man take your crown it is in the myths of a time of great trouble that Jesus comes and with his coming there's a resurrection many are to come forth out of the dust and rise with those who are alive but waiting for his return and these will be given crowns why because they are sons of God they are kings with him they are reigning with him that is what the crown signifies reigning and ruling with the great king himself that is the promise to all those who suffer with him here on earth all those who endure patiently knowing that God the just judge would reward them they who gave up all for him and committed all to him will sit down in his throne and share in his glorious Kingdom doesn't that stir your heart how many our enduring patiently waiting for the coming of Lord sometimes aren't we're tempted to go back out or we're tempted to do things we we know we shouldn't do but we choose to endure patiently waiting a con upon the coming of the Lord Amen Church we have we given up all for him that's what it says here to be a real king we have to give up everything for Jesus you know a lot of times people as we said people aren't willing to give up family members they're not willing to give up jobs or they're not willing to give up associations or friends they're not willing to give up beliefs they're not wanting to give up how they were raised but a Christian is when they give up everything for Jesus and not only give it up but give it to him amen sometimes we can walk away from our past but it never gets under the blood it's got to get under blood in other words say father I forgive that person or father forgive me see we got to give that to him and say God forgive me help me to forgive them we have to commit we have to leave everything for him and then have to commit everything in his hands that's beautiful last quote you can stand every feet let's stand here I'll make sure we finish oh I know look this how many came forward of God tonight brother and I preached many words tonight but brother ham says I've got a word for you it's hold fast oh we have a word for just the preachers at this time all of us for us all so here's a word for everybody from the pastor down to the youngest child here in the congregation Haven is youngest right here I know Lily but she's not really been baptized yeah um I just the youngest but RAM said we have a word for us all at this time it is hold fast persevere don't give up put on the whole armor of God this use every weapon he's given us any weapon any gift he's given let's use it for the kingdom of God use every gift at our disposal and look ahead with joy because we are going to be crowned by him who is king of kings and Lord of lords that's a word for not just me that's a word for all of us don't give up he said hold fast persevere how many got a persevere by God's grace there goes my timer well hope that was a blessing tonight I better stop right there by God's grace I wanted to quickly go over the full armor of God but I think I better stop I gotta get in the habit of Endon because I get the habit of going further so often do you love the Lord tonight so thankful for the open door and I didn't finish the open door because there's more brother brand wanted to say or one wanted to teach us about that so we'll get to that maybe Sunday or not this Sunday but maybe next Wednesday by the grace of God there's more he wanted to say about that and so we'll probably it to that next time by God's grace and let me pull that up one more time hold fast persevere don't give up put on the whole armor of God amen let me know that part of the armor of God most of the armor of God is spiritual or mental how many know that the belt of truth gird up the belt of truth gird up the loins of your mind how many know we need strong minds in this hour once your soul gets healed hallelujah but now you got to get your mind renewed every single day and that's our word for today hold fast persevere don't give up that's of our heads as we pray here tonight Heavenly Father Lord thank you for the word of God tonight Lord truly this message is a blessing to me dear God so often I feel like I've got so much on my plate but Lord as we look at the prophet Paul as we look at William Carey dear God as we look at Charles Spurgeon father we realize we have very little Lord that were actually responsible for and it reminds us of the talents of Lord that Jesus Lord that you taught about some were given five some were given to some are given one Lord obviously Lord we either have the two or one lord it seems compared to some of these men but lord we're grateful for the talent we're grateful for the the the portion of Christ you place in our lives here tonight father and or we want to receive that word that we heard hold fast help us to persevere but I don't know if Satan was trying to convince anybody in here to give up maybe they were maybe Satan was trying to discourage people and say oh you should just quit church you should just quit living the message you just go back to denomination father were thankful for the Word of God that would encourage us hold fast for God is faithful that promised us these things hallelujah we're grateful Lord for the word of God tonight we realize Lord God that were just workers together with you Lord God help us not to elevate and worship anyone or anything help us just to
