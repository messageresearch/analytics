Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah that word of pray as we enter the word of God Heavenly Father Lord we love you Lord what a beautiful song as it says chiefest of Sinners yes Lord Lord we know St Paul said that he felt he was the chiefest lord lord and I know your Prophet said the same thing he thought he was the lowest of the low Lord I believe each one of us when we really look at the depravity of our sin the wickedness of our sin it makes us feel like we are the chief of Sinners but father thank you for Amazing Grace thank you for your love thank you that Paul could say it was the grace of

praise God God bless you good to see everybody I missed everybody last week it's good to be in the house of the Lord uh this morning by God's grace uh for Wednesday night services we've been doing u a series on Galatians and now we're on Ephesians so if you can stream those I'm sure you'll be really blessed I've got a lot of good feedback on those and thank God for that going right through the scripture you know uh our prophet's message is supposed to turn our hearts back to the apostolic fathers right and so when we read those books you know uh those Epistles of Paul Paul was of course the first church age messenger and so when we do that by God's grace we can uh see how our faith ought to look amen and uh I believe it's turning back that way I really do I believe our faith is turning back to the apostolic fathers praise God we like to see it in a greater way but uh it's it's progression it's little by little uh God will do it by his grace and mercy so let's look today at the marriage and the family part three I got a little I got a lot of quotes and a lot of scriptures to show everybody so I hope uh if you like a copy of this just email me or ask me I can email it to you in like 30 seconds and you can have all the quotes in the scriptures uh it's very important to have the right kind of marriage and the right kind of family praise God it's extremely important uh that's what the Holy Ghost is leading all the families to by God's grace the right kind of family to manifest Christ so we read our text this morning uh now I just have a few quick announcements um today of course May 22nd uh the PM service I'm going to preach on Sharp contention uh and the reason I'm preaching on that because we've had two families recently leave the church uh and I'm not going to preach on them okay I'm just going to share with you why they left we just had contention we'll say it like that um I had you know I sent the email out letting us know that one of the families left recently and um I got one reply back asking about it and uh but I imagine it's on other people's minds uh everything is friendly with everyone who's left and everything is kind and their problems have either been with me or brother brandom that's what their problems have been with either me or brother brandom so uh it hasn't been against anybody here hasn't know get anybody here so of course I I not name names or anything like that but I want to bring the scriptural points and the reason I'm calling it sharp contention is because in the Bible in Acts 15 there was sharp contention between Holy Ghost filled Believers uh Paul and Barnabas you remember that and yet later everything was in one Accord they just had a sharp disagreement the Bible calls it a sharp contention so uh brother random said you should be able to bitterly disagree with somebody sir and then at the end hug them yes sir and think just as much of them as Christ does Amen sir Christ thought so much of them he died for them that's right so that's why it's okay to have sharp contentions I just want to let you know uh it's not because of the people it's because of things I've said that people have just dis agreed with and uh and they're they're they're welcome to do that and I want to let you know what they disagree with because if you disagree with me too we need to know that okay we'll never see eyeye on everything but I do believe this we will the bride will be one ACC court before the Rapture and that's for of course the leadership of the Holy Ghost and the things that pertain to the Rapture uh and we agreed recently with you know the family that left we agreed that it was just a minor thing um so the uh an individual disagreed on a minor thing and and they're welcome to leave they're welcome to come and go as they please but we want to find where the Holy Ghost has called us to be and we want to be at our post of Duty right there amen that's what brother Brandon taught always be at your posted duty all those things like that so we want everybody to find the leadership of the Holy Ghost and just be right there at the posted duty till Jesus comes amen that's what we want so this evening I'm just gonna uh and I'm gonna try to keep the evening Services shorter because I think that's one reason why I got sick is because I'm just pouring out myself and my body runs down and I can't don't sleep very much and I'm susceptible to get infections so I'm going to try to really shorten service today I really want somebody to time me like give me an hour just give me an hour I'll just be I'll just done because it it it it wears on me physically I have to preach you know three times a week I do Bible clubs I preaching four times a week so I'm preaching at those kids you know and they they enjoy it you know Friday I preach on social medias I I showed the children how to do social media amen and took it back to the Bible the Bible every word should be used for Godly use and edify not for complaining not for lust not for anger so the Bible said whatever you do in word or deed do it all in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ so if you can post something if you can tweet something uh if you can Instagram something in the name of Jesus Christ we'll go ahead right on to it it's got to be in his name though yes sir so next Sunday um I'm sorry next Saturday there's a youth service in Sheffield I'm encouraging everyone to go if you have young people young children I'm encouraging everybody to go to that brother Diggs will be preaching that so I know it'll be a blessing I know it'll be because he's a real man of God um I'm preaching next Saturday in Minnesota I got a brother asked me to minister out there uh Dale Smith and I will be preaching at these meetings in uh Minnesota I'll be preaching the Saturday morning and the Sunday night uh so that but next Saturday I'll be preaching Saturday morning in Minnesota so I'll be out of town next weekend um for Labor Day or I'm sorry Memorial May 29th just one service next Sunday because they're having the youth services brother Simon will be preaching for us next Sunday I'll be preaching in Minnesota uh

Brooks Friday Saturday June 3r and 4th and brother Craig will be preaching twice on Sunday I'm really looking forward to that by God's grace I just can't wait I'm chomping at the B I just can't wait to hear the word that these uh men of God bring to us I'm really excited and have 10 years of serving the lord here in akan I do it again in a Heartbeat by God's grace and so glad to do it with you June 12th I'm out of town I'm on vacation I need to take a vacation I've been taking a vacation for two years with my family I need to just get away and spend some time with my family need to get away from my computer desk I need to get away from my job and I just need to spend some time with my family so I'll be out that Sunday brother Brian Hawkins has agreed to well I'm sorry he's praying about it but normally after he prays he feels that and last time he was here God really moved and healed one of our sisters now since they've left the church but God instantly healed one right there so we know the power of the Lord is present to heal in this place how many that amen amen so that's just upcoming weeks here by God's grace so I'm not gonna be able to preach on family for a while we'd say for about three or four weeks so I want to make sure I really dial in this morning and try to preach on that amen okay so everybody love the Lord this morning okay praise the Lord you have any as I've always said if you have any ever have any questions for me any correction for me just contact me I'm happy to take it I'm happy I love questions I like talking on the phone with you I like emailing back and forth I like that whatever is best for you we just want to be United in Christ Jesus okay so the purpose of these uh family sermons is to manifest the love of Jesus Christ in our marriages families and homes uh if we plan to go to the marriage in the sky that I believe our marriages here on Earth should resemble the Heavenly Union between Christ and his bride as I've said it before how are we going to get to that marriage if our marriages here AR aren't in the right order praise the Lord how's it gonna How's that gonna happen Okay well we got to manifest Christ here and then that of course shows us that we are going to that marriage in the sky uh amen because then we're living the life of Christ now just a quick review and as I said brother brandom I have quotes for all this that brother brandom said I quotes for every one of these uh here by God's grace and I found it interesting yesterday I was going through my old notes that I printed off on marriage and family and conduct and things like that and I found an old p uh pamphlet by Harold Becka every everyone know Harold Becket okay well he put out this H quote book on marriage and I just loved it first time I read it I thought glory to God and uh and I was reading the book and pretty soon I find that he had five needs for women and five needs for men and I found out that he must have read that book that I bought every couple of the church but his needs her needs so uh that was encouraging that another message Minister who has a worldwide influence over people uh you know a different uh men of God and different things like that read that book years ago and then found all these quotes and then that's the same thing I've done so I felt led of the Lord to do that and I believe it's a good thing but all these things that man wrote about in his book that brother Becket and that I've read I'm sure other brothers brother Brandon said all of them and that's the beauty of it and I believe it'll help you this morning by God's grace so let's review part one a little bit uh the pastor's marriage impacts the church Grace keeps every family together even God's family couples must be so in love after the wedding when the toils and trials of Life come in brother bam said so here's what brother B said he said he gathers his wife and kids around the radio every Saturday morning to listen to brother Neville and then he says this he said I love brother Neville look at the underlined words there this first he's a theologian first thing he's a child of God the next thing he's the same every day I known him for years he's never changed one bit he's still Orman Neville a serving the lord Jesus now I go down to the yellow here when you see a minister and his wife getting along like that speaking of brother Neville and his wife in sweetness and humbleness that just makes the church go that much better so brother Bram says the home life the way the husband and wife love each other and get along and sweetly live will directly impact the local church so that struck me as soon as I saw brother Ram said that M uh and remember brother brandham said in December of 1963 he said the brandham Tabernacle was the most spiritual place he'd ever been to wow on the earth praise the Lord he said we don't have the most speaking in tongues we don't have the most Miracle amen and he gave brother Neville the credit for that amen amen listen to it December 29th you're gonna listen to it uh so it's extremely important how we love at home how we manifest Christ at home that will directly impact the church because we cannot play church just in the church and be nice to everybody here we got to have the real life of Christ at home amen then manifest that love here in Church brother Braham said Grace keeps family together I'm just going to read the underline part he said then it takes Grace to keep that family together oh God it taking the grace of Jehovah to keep his family together and that's the only way we're in Jehovah's family today is because of the grace of Jesus Christ we'd all be gone but it's Grace oh Grace Amen brother Ram said shame on men who lose their affections for their wives he said never let that honeymoon cease for it isn't going to cease in heaven amen love should create a hunger to be together as brother said I'm counting down the days when I can get there to be with his wife M here's that quote where he says and couples got to be so in love When Trials come he said now right before you're married everything's just fine and dandy but after you get married then the toils and the trials of Life come in that's when you've got to be so in love that you understand one another when you're disappointed in her she's disappointed in you you still understand one another that's the way it is with Christ see we've got to be so in love with him so when we ask for something he doesn't give it to us that doesn't shake us a bit all right so you got to be so much in love after your married not just uh in love before you're married you got to be in love after you're married too because that's when the trials will come and love keeps everybody together amen Amen brother now the Bible said the man must be brave and strong so this is kind of part two where I preached a few Sunday nights ago the Bible said quit you like men and be brave and be strong so men today don't fear Le O deia I'm not scared of Le oia praise the Lord I'm not scared of Hollywood I'm not scared of anyone that leaves a message I'm not scared of pornography I'm not scared of anything because I've got a greater one in me than he that's in the world yes amen I have nothing to fear I'm brave I'm strong I'm a Christian I've got the greatest force in all the universe living in me it's called Divine love amen glory yeah I've got the full armor of God on so what should I fear I'm a soldier of the Cross I'm a servant yeah praise the Lord I've got the sword the word in my hand what uh evil can come before me everything will fall our feet if we just speak the word of God and say the name of Jesus amen amen glory we saw the man must labor for Spiritual meat more than natural meat Jesus himself said that don't work so hard Brothers to provide you know the fanciest home or the the most expensive food or the nicest clothes don't labor for that he said labor for the spiritual meat amen work hard to get your family to hear the word of God Amen that's what Jesus Christ said so you're doing the right thing by bringing your family to church amen you Brothers God bless you and we saw a virtuous woman is a crown to her husband she's the he she's the glory of him when she lives a virtuous and that means a powerful Army life she's like a AR she's like a uh she's leading like an army of children in the home amen and she's a she's an army the Bible said that Song of Solomon as well keeps everything in order now the man must honor his wife and understand her that's what the Bible said he's got to do it a man has to have the Holy Ghost enough to honor his wife and then understand her amen he's got to understand well a woman's not built like a man a woman's built differently I've got to love her and the spirit's got to help me to love her that's right brother Braham said men should never lose their affections he said the wife really needs your attention brothers so Brothers we got to make time to give our wies some attention that's what brother R said I'm just quing what brother Ram said the man should be Burly but have the fruit of gentleness by the spirit so we got to be Burly Brothers but there's also time to manifest gentleness as well by The Same Spirit we just because if we're Burly with our wise all the time Burly prod produces Burly well the man said temper breeds temper love breeds love though amen so if we treat our wives rough and wonder why our wives are so rough that's our fault that's right but if we love our wives and are gentle to our wives then we should expect our wives to be gentle yes amen because it's an atmosphere we create the home as men amen we've got to create the right atmosphere but you're a Creator husbands must love their wives and not themselves other women the world or anything else Holy Spirit just said love your wives husbands that's what we got to love of course we love if we love Jesus will do that because Jesus is greater than everybody but he's our first love and then the husbands love your wives now the man must keep the value made to God and family and friends that he would love his wife all all of us when we got married we stood before everybody everybody smiling taking pictures there's flowers and it's all beautiful but brother sometimes we forget that we made a promise to love our wives praise the Lord sometimes we forget and we got to keep our promise brother Bram said No Man's no better than his word you promis to love your wife you promised to love your children you promis to love God now be a man and keep your word amen men must be Fighters for love and Holiness brother Bram said be a hero do you know he said that he said be a hero we need some heroes in here right that going to save and rescue some Souls is that right always be that Gallant boyfriend so brother said yeah that's what he said men so men Gotta Fight For Love and Holiness in their homes they gotta fight for that because they're fighting out L to see they're fighting out Temptations they got to fight for honor and the Bible honors men who fight for love remember Proverbs 5 said the man must always be ravished uh with the love of his wife that means intoxicated he must always look at his wife and feel in love with her that's what the Bible says in proverbs 30 remember the the Holy Spirit wrote to the writer you know there's three or four things I can't explain that are too wonderful me wonderful for me one of them the holy spirit said was a man who's trying to chase a maid a man who's trying to uh win her heart he said that's too wonderful for for me and see that why is God why does God like love and romance because that's what Christ is doing right now to us he's trying to make love to us amen he's trying to woo our hearts he's trying to uh show us his love and we got to receive his love amen glory right brother brandom said the books you read mold your character so everyone reads on their phone so there's no excuse to not be able to read good books amen there's no better leader for a woman and children than a Spirit-filled and spirit-led man man said there's no better duck to lead the Ducks than that one duck that rallies them all together same way with a man same way with a pastor same way with a man in the house there's no better leader than than you Brothers when you're anointed and walking in the spirit amen amen then we showed how Joseph twice immediately obeyed the voice of God in regards to marrying Jesus so his wife and his unborn it wasn't his it was God's unborn son yeah it wasn't his but anyways he was taking care of the child that would be a part of his natural family Ezra and the men fasted we read this we read this a few weeks ago Ezra and the men fasted for the future of their wives and children that's what we should do if we don't know which direction to go which which decision to make let's fast and pray I told you brothers that night I said if you want to come fast and pray on Saturday I'm right here with you I'll be here you just tell me I'll come and fast and pray amen we'll pray as long as we can pray then we'll read the Bible we'll sing or we'll study the word and then we'll go back to praying we've done it before John bang and I have shut in a few years ago we shut remember that we shut for a weekend at the church uh yeah brother Ram said everyone is looking now this is real important everyone's looking for somebody to love them brother said I want somebody to love me and you search everywhere he said to find someone who will love you so you see everybody wants to be loved what causes separation in families though is the neglect of love someone fails to love and that causes separation sometimes physically and so sometimes spiritually and brother M said family has to love one another yeah here's where he says everybody needs love and looks for love here you hymn 57 the world's looking for something today when your little wife told you she'd be your sweetheart and wife she was looking for somebody to love her not just love her till you got married but love her after she got married am Glory that's what she's looking for and when you promised your husband he was looking he was looking brothers were looking for somebody to love them when he come in tired and weary from working all day some little wife to put her arms around him and kindly brush his hair back and tell how much she loved him that's what caused a separation in fam say the neglect of love people fail to love that's what causes separation in churches neglect of Love we've got to have love amen got to have it at home gotta have it here at the church all right now that was uh about 10 minutes review so let's get now to today now brother brandom says here and I'm basing this all off the Bible and of course brother bram's quotes uh we must have exclusive love when you get married you love somebody exclusively all your love goes to that person say this calling Jesus on the scene you know man if you're the right kind of husband there's no woman in the world that you love like your wife yeah right there might be other women more fair there might be women that would prettier so forth but something if you really love your wife there's something in there that you don't notice what she looks like you love her you don't know why but you love her and you women the same for your husband women you love and you young girls are your boyfriends boyfriend to girlfriend if you met that person that you know you love there's something in there you know you love them yeah resuming 62 and if you don't truly love your wife better than any woman in the world she's not yet there is something wrong if we don't love our wives better than other sisters something's wrong with us husbands I need to love my wife I better than I treat all the sisters in here amen and the church said if I don't something's wrong how can I love God's spiritual bride but not my natural bride that Christ gave me how that's that's that's a contradiction that's wrong that's hypocrisy I'm to love my wife more than any other woman in the world amen glory that's what brother Ram says right if you now here sisters if you don't love your husband if you trifle on him I don't know what trifle means I look that one up so somebody look that up if you you trifle on him and don't live the right kind of Life there is something wrong all right let's go on here uh Hebrews chapter 6 part two now you say well brother Brandon then if I become a Christian I can just do anything I want to absolutely if you're a Christian do anything you want to and I'll guarantee you won't have any desire to do wrong yeah yes you do anything I always did just what I wanted to Glory I've always done what my soul wants to do sometimes I do what my flesh does but I try to not do what my flesh wants to do praise God that's what we must differentiate what does our soul want to do and what does our flesh want to do we must cast down throw it down what the flesh wants to do and always do what the Soul's telling us to do now look what he says about his wife I wouldn't hurt her for nothing because he loves her brothers we should not enjoy hurting our wives that's right we should not enjoy making our our wives Cry Praise the Lord Amen brother Ram never enjoyed hurting sister ma because he says it right there he wouldn't hurt her for anything he doesn't want to hurt that wonderful we say flower or crown that God gave her he wants to treat her the right way amen faith in God 52 but you know I found the one lady that I really love and I asked her if she thought that much me and she said yes so we got married and I told her now look honey all my love I give to you no matter what other women say now he talks about what if an attractive lady came on the street and said Oh Billy I really love you with all my heart look what he would say to a woman that did that he said well here's the first place if she has a love for me it's bound to be false so if you're already married and a woman comes up and said oh Jesse you're a pretty handsome guy or you're you're you're you're something like that I love you he said it's already false because my first duty is what I pledge to my wife that's hers first I got to think of her first she's my first I told her I'd give her all my love and then my first duties is to her I'd say now look sister you're just infatuated or something lustful he's already married he's already made a vow he already promised God I'm giving all my all my love to my wife if another woman comes around and say well I love you you're so well this and that he said you're just infatuate uated with the spirit of lust amen pardon me he said now look you're just evadu because you're not in love and I'm not in love with you because I love one woman and that's the mother of my children that's my first Duty Oh Glory what what does brother R say as the secret to your success he said love yeah love is a secret to your success as a Christian how many knew that you know that amen not how much you can read or pray although love will make you do that not how much you can attend church but love will make you attend church right but the secret is living by love because the Bible says this 1 Peter 1:22 seeing you have purified your souls in obeying the truth through the spirit unto what unan that means unmasked love no hypocrisy it's not a pretend love it's a genuine pure love that's how you purify your soul just love someone purely from the heart see that you love one another with a pure heart fervently now brother R tells this story of Paul Raider how we know the story of Paul Raider when he kisses his wife okay one morning I'm not going to read all this but uh he didn't apologize to his wife and then they they always Kissed before he went out to work or went out to preach or whatever it was and uh so he left so now he goes down the street let's skip ahead of this so he kissed her you know he never apologized he he mistreated his wife and just kissed her and walked away and then he said he went down the street and I began to think about M how can I stand it what if something happened to me today that's my sweetheart I look I said something I ought to say so Paul Raider was a preacher uh made a mistake didn't apologize to his wife he goes walking down the street and look the spirit convicts him to go make that right so he does so he said in his heart he got to swelling big and looked around and run back in real quick jerked the door open and heard somebody cry and she was standing behind the door crying he made his wife cry he said he looked around and grabbed her by the shoulder pulled around kissed her as big as he could like that walked out the door and said goodbye and she said goodbye he said just like she did the other time but the last time had a feeling in it so the first kiss was just like just going through the motions he upet he went back and made sure he kissed her with some feeling in it and brother said that's the way it is about knowing Christ you can know him but there is a feeling a real love feeling a real Fellowship that's the way that's the secret to the success that's the way is a real genuine love that's not a put on that's why when I come to church I want to worship from from my heart yes I don't want to try to well brother and is trying real hard I'll try to impress him by maybe jumping a little a little more or running or spinning around or something like that or maybe I'll try to really Pump It Up and things like that I just want to love from the purity of my heart amen I'm G to close my eyes and think about Calvary the resurrection how he saved me what I used to be what I am now and sing based upon genuine love not a put on because that's not the pretending is not the secret to success loving and honesty and Purity and Holiness that's the secret to success amen glory it's real and God knows it's real so does Satan know it's real when you love the Lord with a genuine love yes amen said only the Holy Ghost can outdo Satan you see Satan's gonna attack our marriages and our families uh and the only thing that can out do Satan is the Holy Ghost here he says it sin is attractive any way you take it sin is attractive to the human being Satan knows how to make it attractive he's a genius at a job at his job he's a genius at tempting people M he'll get a real person who's real solid on the word and get them to start questioning the word get them to start questioning what's in their home questioning if they can do this questioning if they can do that because he's a genius at his job the Bible said he accuses the saints of God Day and Night Before the Throne he's an accuser like what brother says in the first seal he said no remember it wasn't Rush the Antichrist is smooth fell just watch how smooth he is it just takes the Holy Spirit the only thing that can outdo him so the only thing that can outdo this this Spirit of Satan in our homes or in our church is the Holy Ghost and he is love because God is love amen amen did you know brother man said Satan works the hardest on women did you know that how many knew that by God's grace so Brothers we need to really pray for our wives Brothers we need to pray for the Sisters in the church Satan Works harder on the women this is perseverance 1962 he's talking to a brother he said I guess your sweetheart came too I I know you feel that way about her she's still your sweetheart that's the way I know listen all of us Christians feel that way about our wives got any Christians in here that are married men sir yeah you should feel that way about your wife she's your sweetheart oh yes amen I'm gonna go down to the underline part and see that Satan's tool where he works the hardest that was his first instrument what Eve was yeah so he takes it back to Genesis what was Satan's first uh temptation was to the woman yeah so that's where he works the hardest brother Brandon says he's never changed he stays right there we just have to pray for our sisters constantly Brothers when was the last time we prayed for our wives amen he said pray for your wives constantly yes amen sounds like it's really hitting home out there I could hear a pin drop almost out there we brother said we need our spouses just a moment we need our spouses brother says in perseverance he was talking to a brother here I'm going to skip past that okay I'm sorry this is the same no this is a different quote 62 I know you said I guess your sweetheart came to I know you feel that way she's still your sweetheart I know we all of us as Christians feel that way about our wives they're still our sweethearts I hope it never changes in my family it never Chang in your family that we can always feel that way about our wives after all they stand side by side with us help us fight these battles and we need them yeah praise God although I've said many scorching things to them but it wasn't in such a way to make them feel bad it was in such a way to keep them in line with the gospel amen hallelujah I have a coote brother said I don't even know where I'd be without sister ma now think about that he he couldn't even imagine where would I be without my wife and most of the time she just sat at home and raised the kids most of the time right yeah I can imagine where would I be without my wife Brothers we should probably say the same thing where would be we we be without my without without our wives I'll say it like that I don't even want to imagine where I would be I know where I would be and I don't want to talk about it it ain't good because I'm very thankful God gave me a wonderful wife and saved my soul praise the Lord amen hallelujah so I know what I used to be I know what I am now by the grace of the Lord Brother manam said marriage is of God and God is watching how we treat one another man said married life is of God the B said that married life is of God the bed's undefiled Genesis 21:18 of course marriage was God's idea God did this in Genesis 2:18 God said it's not good that man should be alone I'll make him a helpmate for him so this whole institution was of God it's God's idea now we read this last week Malachi 2:14 yet ye say wherefore because the Lord has been witness between thee and the wife of thy youth against whom thou has dealt treacherously yet she is thy comp companion and the wife of thy Covenant so God had noticed that Israel men had started dealing treacherously against their wives and they thought they could get away with it so God sent a Prophet by the name of Malachi to B to ball out those men sound familiar God send brother Ram to ball out men God says brother R to ball out women if there's any mistreating going on God will send the prophet to straighten the people out amen glory he said I've been watching you and your house how you're treating each other I've been watching how you deal with each other how you treat each other God sent a prophet to let him know I'm watching how your home life is and did he not make one yet he had the resue of the spirit and wherefore one that he might seek a Godly seed therefore take heed to your spirit and let none deal treacherously against the wife of of his youth how do you take heed to your spirit while you start meditating upon what are you thinking what are you saying that's how you take heed to your spirit you start examining are my words and my actions and my thoughts about my wife or my husband are these lining up with the word of God if not then I need to take heed to my spirit and I need to repent that's exactly right take heed look at your spirit look what's your thinking what's your thought process and that's why I said I'll be happy to sit down with any married couple and uh just sweetly work these things out I've seen it happen before it's happened many times it could happen again by God's grace but you have to be able to humble yourself and take heed to your spirit and honestly look at yourself am I living a Christian Life or am I dealing right with my spouse or am I not and then just be humble enough to repent and move on God will give you the victory amen glory Song of Solomon 412 a garden enclosed is my sister my spouse a spring shut up a fountain sealed so what happens if you neglect your garden oh my the weeds take over they take over you just watch it if you haven't seen it yet go back out in your Landscaping today may take a little stroll and hold your wife or husband's hand and take a little stroll if you don't keep up your Garden uh it becomes a wasteland yeah it becomes a wasteland right you got to and so it is with your wife my wife is a garden Solomon said I've got to keep up with her needs I've gotta make sure she has what she needs I'm gonna try to close later on with this where brother B said Joseph was a shield to Mary so the man has to be able to stand there and protect he's got to be a shield and protect his little wife behind him brother brand said that yeah amen yes sir and so she's a garden you got to attend to your garden you got to pay attention to your garden and make sure it's it's bringing forth fruit praise the Lord I like this wives can be a tremendous blessing to help to their husbands because the Bible said she will do him good and not evil all the days of her life amen sisters are we trying to do that by God's grace amen glory look at this brothers look at this this is real encouraging who so find a wife findeth a good thing and obtains favor of the Lord God already favors me more because I'm married not only do I have Grace and forgiveness and eternal life but I also have favor because I took a wife and I'm married why because I'm typing Christ in the church amen that's right Proverbs 19:14 house and riches are the inheritance of fathers and a Prudent Wife is from the Lord amen so that means God sent my wife she comes from his thinking down to me amen yes just like on Wednesday night when we showed how you were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world where did you come from the mind of Christ amen where did your prent right from come from she came from the the mind of Christ amen and she's from the Lord if you got a prent wife amen thank God for that glory amen Jehovah Gyra 3 and a righteous one is the best thing you get a hold of outside of salvation yeah amen that's right ain't the newest car ain't the newest job it ain't it ain't like that the best thing he can get a hold of outside of Salvation is a good wife yeah if God could have give a man a better thing than a wife he would have give it to him because God just gives his children the good things oh I'm so full of joy this morning amen so I know I got favor I know I got a good thing I know I got what God has for me praise the Lord amen that's part of the message that's part of the word that's part of the the message of the hour this is our hearts being restored back to the Pentecostal fathers amen that's right it's part of it because it's part of the word notice there's nothing that God could give a man outside of Salvation better than a nice wife there's no person I'm gonna get to this later can console a person when they're tired they won't confide in anyone like they do their own wife so Brothers when they're tired the person that helps them feel better is their wife and I can say Amen to that when I've been tired and worn out and stressed and even sick who's the one that helps me and console me my wife better than all my brothers that send me text I appreciate texts and I appreciate prayers but the one that consoles me and I conf find and the one I share and confide my secrets in and my prayers and all these things the one that I share my deepest feelings and things is my wife that's what brother random said what a fortunate thing you brothers are when you've got a nice little wife that's clean and upright and moral and you can come in when you're tired and weary sit down and she can talk to you she can do more with you than anybody else amen so there's no better nurse for the husbands than their wives amen that's right she can do more for you brother Ram said than anybody else is your wife right flashing red light oh he keeps going same quote but remember woman is made for man not man for woman the last created being God ever created was a man a woman's a by product from a man and she was made for a man not man made for a woman they have vice versa it around and man falls at The Shrine of woman today oh my we won't do that though we won't worship women amen we'll worship Jesus Christ praise the Lord but the man in his place and the woman right under him by God's grace because man is to rule the head of the woman Christ is the head of the uh man and then God is the head of Christ because the eternal spirit is the head of the body amen okay Mark of the Beast they say behind every good man there's a good wife that's very fine if there's any credit go to the Brandon family give it to her because she's 10 years younger than I am now and snow whitee headed and she just stood between me and the public and I don't know what I would do without her what a compliment yeah a prophet of God like Elijah with the same Spirit of Elijah I don't know what I would do without my wife my goodness amen God certainly give me a wonderful why they're wonderful thing brother Smith Oh Brother Smith he's talking to me why if he could have give a man anything better he would have done it that's the truth he was find a w wife has found a good thing says the wisest man we ever had so the wisdom of the holy spirit says if you found a good wife you found a good thing I think that a wife is the best thing a man can have outside of Salvation amen glory that's quite that's quite a ranking isn't it salvation would be the greatest thing you could ever have well right underneath that is a Godly wife amen not riches and not luxury not an easy life not all these things not pleasure but a wife is the is the second greatest thing outside of Salvation according to our Prophet I many believe he's a prophet yes sir oh absolutely living the life at home okay let's I thought this scripture was beautiful Let's uh let's dial in here Psalms 101:2 look what uh the holy spirit says I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way oh when wil Thou come unto me so he's saying Lord when will you come and your spirit come come to me I will walk within my house with a perfect heart so if we want God to visit our houses we got to walk with a perfect heart in our houses amen so how you live at home makes all the difference in your Christian Life home life brings a presence of God to your life let's just soak that in for a little bit I will walk within my house with a perfect heart David said when I want to see the Holy Spirit Min Minister my family I've got to live the right kind of Life at home Amen brother brandom said uh this is kind of a jokey thing but brother brandom says that he tells me that he loves her but she says you don't love me okay I know it's kind of difficult but he said it's because I don't show her enough signs okay now and he says why because he'd be out preaching as soon as he get home he don't want to spend time with his wife he wants to go hunting and fishing so here's what he says just just so you can see it but brother R admits he said I I need to maybe I don't show her enough signs that I love her that might just be like a joke back and forth between a couple okay but let's look questions answers he said me and my wife disagree we sure do I tell her I love her and she says don't believe I do when I first heard that about my jaw about dropped I'm like brother say that but he's talking this is just like the experienced married married couple that maybe isn't spending much time together so then we certainly disagree but I'm telling you that we sure get along all right now look now notice maybe I don't show enough signs to her that I do it I'm out preaching then come in home get my fishing rod Go Fish and see but down in my heart I love her I just have to stay away from her that's all now I don't recommend Brothers in our church doing that because none of the brothers in our church travel around the world to preach seven times right and none of our Brothers Spend 80% of their lives in visions and in a hour and two and three hour long prayer lines and get their body so tore down they can hardly walk out of the meeting amen yeah amen so I don't recommend people following this example unless you are a prophet yeah because what do you do with all the other quotes that brother brandom said and I got a whole bunch coming up so you're you just seen the I you just seen the tip of the iceberg okay now uh I want to get here's the main thing I want to preach here the main thing I finally just laid that groundwork I just kind of want to here's a main thing I want to show this is from the book uh his KN turn but I'm going to show it's all scriptural and it has it's all back by quotes it's all back by quotes So the book says this this is what brother Harold Becket say said as well because he must have read the book he has five needs that he needs to be a happy husband and she's got to meet those five needs now five is a number of great I thought that was very scriptural uh she has five needs and he's got to meet those now these are the number of the slides just so I could find the slides because I want to start with the sisters needs first because I always start with challenging the men and encouraging the men trying to strengthen the men to uh be leaders in their homes uh Satan will battle men to the tooth and nail to not be a good leader because that's what they're called to do yeah God God wants men to be strong leaders but Satan wants to fight them and make them be more passive and well honey you just do whatever you want instead of taking up and taking command brother said a man should be like a general in the home he should have the leading of the Lord he said I never seen I don't have this score with me but I read on Herold Beck Herold becket's packet he said I never seen one woman ever leave a man that stood up and was led of the Lord and spoke and led like a a real General amen why because she's made to follow she's made to be submissive that's what she naturally does and she wants somebody to go lead her if she's a spiritful woman if if she or she if she falls away or she's not LED of the spirit or something like that brother she said she gets an iron disposition so iron disposition is your disposition is your your countenance uh the way your face looks your actions and your attitude so a woman with the iron disposition has the wrong Spirit on it and God can't work with that she's got to repent of that instead of an iron disposition you's got to have a soft disposition a gentle disposition amen hallelujah amen I'll just keep preaching because I know it's the truth yes sir I preached this in Guyana one time and I was just I was so sad I'm like they're not even saying amen and the sisters come up the next morning and said brother Jesse don't be discouraged he said you're just preaching these things so hard and they're so true it's cutting us so deep we can't can't even say Amen because we have so many things to fix in our home I said thank you for sharing that sister that really helped me so I wanted to hear more amens you know the previous Services I preach and they be amen and brothers be jumping smacking the walls and and you know theyd be waving their their their their hanger Chiefs and everything and then when I preach on family it's like you could you could hear a pin drop all around the church like am I the same preacher are you the same people what's going on here yeah amen I hope I hope what I'm I hope what I'm doing I hope I'm skin down all of our of our our fleshly habits yeah that the soul might over the soul might confess our sins and the Soul might take greater control of Our Lives Lord and not walk by the fleshly desires okay so let's look at um her uh her needs and uh next time Lord willing I'm here it's going to be a few weeks as far as when I preach on a Sunday it's gonna be a while but I'll be here on Wednesday night's preaching uh but uh what I'll do Lord willing I want to next time we're here I want to I want to have the couples identify which needs are the most important okay for example like a woman has five needs and this is what this Christian counselor found out after uh a thousand counseling sessions and brother random said all these so here here they are a woman needs affection brother bam said every one of these uh she needs affection she's got to have affection she's got to have openness and honesty she's got to have a conversation with her husband conversation often she's got to have him committed to the family and she's got to have financial support those are the five most important now what we mean by this is in your marriages you got to identify what is the most important for you so for like some sisters number one might just be I just need an honest husband for some sisters it might be I just need a husband that hugs me and kiss me and when I walk in gives me a hug and uh things like that or when you know he walks in or whatever more that might be their number one need or maybe conversation I I just need somebody to talk to I'm all day talking to these kids all day long I just got to talk to the adult when he gets home I just need somebody to talk to it all depends on your need and brothers if you care about your wife you'll try to do better job that's exactly right if you care yeah amen because you promised to love her you promised God you would love her and that's no joke you don't make but the Bible said don't make a vow to God and not pay it you will suffer that's true so let me recall this this is in red now it was important the brothers who are married probably have already been able to do all those things which is why their wives married them in the first place at some point he was meeting all of her needs and so she said yes I will I will marry you I gladly marry you because you're treating me you're meeting all my needs I'd be happy to marry you hubby it's easy to say I to you girl on bended knee oh it's so easy you met all my needs and this is going to continue forever we're going to be the happiest couple in all of Ohio or Pennsylvania orever you live we're gonna be the happiest couple on all a I know I'm the happiest couple in doy toown I can't say for AC but I know for sure in doy toown I'm the happiest couple there is in do so so the brothers must be willing to relearn how to love their wives they just forgot probably because Brothers we can sure learn some good things but then we forget a lot of good things too don't we everybody forgets everybody falls short of the glory of God everybody needs to relearn things and so forth like that okay so let's go through these by God's grace how I do it on time okay I've been preaching about an hour okay praise the Lord not even an hour yet okay the first need she has now I need some people with reading Bibles okay so can you everybody get your Bibles and and then when you when if you're there I'll call on you to raise your hand uh if you want to read some in the scripture here okay can anybody read for me can you raise your hand somebody can read for me okay but Andy can you do five I'm sorry brother Andy can you do Ephesians 5:25 anyone else can read for me Malachi can you read uh 1 Peter 3:7 Scott can you read 1 Corinthians 73 now I need one more reader we have one more uh s Amy can you read Romans 12:10 okay so we got it Andy Malachi Brother Scott and sister thank you okay Andy whenever you're ready sir how love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for it amen so Paul commands them to love okay uh Malachi what's First Peter 3:7 likewise he husbands dwell them according to knowledge honor unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel and as being HS together of the grace of life that your prayers be not okay so affection can be showed through honor affection is of course motivated by love uh and man must dwell with his wife with an understanding she needs affection she needs love she needs flowers or hugs or kisses or whatever she needs you got to give it to her but Scott First Corinthians 7:3 the husband renderto the wife Ben likewise also wife okay now that's speaking of the physical marriage but benevolence just means overall kindness yeah and love and affection so just as a man needs his pH we'll get to that one Lord willing eventually just as a man needs physical relations so a woman needs affection she's got to have that in fact what the book says the book says before a man touches her body he should touch her heart and show her that he loves her yeah with affection yeah there a woman don't feel love like for example a man because he's so high passion a man can a woman a wife can just rub his arm and he'll start getting thinking about those kind of things are you with me I have to go too deep I don't want to go I don't want to go too descriptive but a man is so quick High passion many times if his wife just rubs his shoulder or something like that or gives him a hug he can be ready to have uh some uh he can ready have some relations brother call some family relations that's how that's how he's wired brother said he's built to do that so he can reproduce and fulfill the re fruitful multiply that God commanded Adam okay but he's got to show her du benevolence he's got to he's got to return the love like she gives herself to love him he's got to return love back to her amen okay Romans 1210 be kindly affection one to another with Brotherly Love in honor preferring one another amen kindly affection affection is a Bible word yeah and brother said so we should be affectionate towards all the saints what about our wives and husbands I just showed you du benevolence and a man must love okay so here's brother R shaming men who lose affection for their wives I was talking to men about losing their affections I told you brother ra said this literally for their wives and don't love them as they did when they were sweethearts shame on you you ought to do it she's always your sweetheart absolutely that's the part she should be and you should treat her like that oh never let that honeymoon cease because it ain't gonna going to in heaven it's just going to be perfectly one there like looks like some women ought ought to said amen he said don't it I like that looks like some women ought to Said Amen to that yeah brother starts talking to the congregation yeah amen how come another sister said amen he said sister Hickerson why don't you say something for somebody back there oh thank you sister Cox very good brother Cox that's for you everywhere you are now he says so I just preach that for you brother Cox glory and we should never forget to honor each other always be sweethearts never let it cease he tells a story I read this two weeks ago of the Catholic man he said brother brandom my wife thinks I ought to come in every night and kiss her and hug her and make it out like we just was fixing to get married and we got a bunch of kids he said whoop wait a minute boy you're wrong that's just the same as it was before you're married you must always remember she's 40 years old now and she really needs your attention other words you're you're wrong you need to kiss her you need to hug her that's right are you with me church I say you're wrong shame on that Catholic man for not loving his wife like he did before got married and brother shame on me and shame on us if we don't love our wives the right way yes that won't get a lot of amens but it will in heaven I know that yeah I know the Lord saying amen glory yes sir right conversation she needs conversation um now this is more implied there's no scripture that says conversation but let's let's just read uh First Corinthians 7:33 read that and look what Paul says this is where I'm taking this I believe that this is implied because brother brandom says it a lot I have a lot of quotes for this one I have no scripture that says you know have a lot of conversation but I have a lot of quotes brother said you need to sit and talk to your wife sit down and talk with your wife amen I think the sisters are sister are you really liking these sermons here by God's grace sisters okay all right so the sisters not be happy with me the brothers be mad with me okay all right I'll be I'll be careful Brothers I'm just kidding I'm just kidding we all love the Lord don't we but he that is married care for the things that are of this world how he may please his wife this is Paul now what if everyone everyone in that day would have took Paul's opinion about oh everybody should be single the coming of the Lord is not yeah that he said this is not me this is my this is he said this is not the Lord this is my thoughts he say well we wouldn't have many more many families many Christian families they'd all die out right it's a good thing some of them have got married and here Paul is giving advice to married couple and he's never been married right right could you have received correction from a man that never been married oh my I hope you could because he was a prophet yeah amen that's exactly right yeah see because it's the office God God gives a gift he gives an office and we're supposed to submit to the word that comes through that gift and office yeah whether they experience it or not submit to the word that comes through the office exactly right okay now here's the word he's supposed to please his wife okay Brothers brothers are supposed to strive to please to accommodate oneself to the opinions desires and interests of others women have an interest in talking don't they they just like to talk and there's nothing wrong with that I like talking too as long as it's about good things I really like it I like to talk about Jesus you know who wouldn't do that but some but you know women just like to talk even in first grade the girls are more linguistic than the boys girls pick up reading normally a lot faster than the boys the boys are always slower the boys have a hard time expressing themselves but girls can rattle off and talk and if I let them talk they'll keep talking talking talking talking talk God made them that way God made them to be more verbal that's true so as a man we I've got to under Peter said I got to understand with a deep understanding how to love my wife and honor my wife and then Paul said if you're married you're have to please your husband or wife and that means know what h desires are an interest my wife just just desires to have conversations sometime so after we put the kids to bed sometimes they'll come out and walk out we'll just talk on the couch sometimes I give her a back massage or shoulder massage sometimes I'll massage her feet or something like that every now and then I let her give me a foot massage that's kind of nice but not all the time but it's just something we can do while talking and we just need to talk and just connect and just uh she that's how she feels love so I'm trying to meet her need and I think a Christian should do that look what brother BR says he said um something happened to me a few weeks ago I'm determined by the help of God never to be negative on anything anymore to blast my heart out and remind me no matter what it costs be sincere get down to the bottom of it he said you don't get no complex by the blood of Jesus Christ you get love see if we have a complex toward our wives our husbands we have this complex we can't get rid of this bad feeling or towards a church member or a pastor or preacher or a sister anybody that's not from Christ that's from our own human flesh Christ doesn't bring complexes Christ beings love he said uh okay I'm gonna skip that now he said Fellowship comes by love and love requires fellowship if you love your wife you've just got to get with her and talk with her that means Brothers you got to listen and then say some words back okay here's how it goes you listen and you comment about that comment and and that's how you talk is that okay brother I had to learn that I had to learn that like I told you once we had two kids I think I shared this testimony when I opened the series after we had two kids I was so busy preaching and doing my Master's Degree that I wasn't even talking to my wife and my wife said we're just like uh she said we're just like roommates I don't even know I don't feel like she said I don't even want any more kids because I don't have any I'm just I feel like I'm all alone with my with my two children and when she told me that about broke my heart because it kind of convicted me like oh that's right I'm not even paying attention to you I've got yeah a lot of responsibilities but what's more important my master's degree or my family can anybody tell me that my job or my income is that more important or is my family more important family right family right praise God yeah brother man said God family you're last right and so that convicted me then that's when we started praying and reading books and finding quotes or brother R says these very same things that are being said see if you love her you just got to get with her and talk with her if you love your friends just got to get with them and talk to them if you love God there's got to be a basis for fellowship and that agreement is based upon your vow see I vow to love Jesus so I sit down and talk to him I vowed to love my wife so I'll sit down and talk to her glory desperations I love this the only way you can have faith is have love first because after all faith is Love's incentive okay it's an incentive to love now you if you don't have love you can't have faith Faith how can you have faith in your wife if you don't love her that's felo how about agapo to God how can it be if you don't love God now listen here it is if you said you loved your wife Brothers how many love their wives but you never tell her about it and set her down and make love to her and express it to her kiss her hug her and tell her she's the best cook in the country and all the things that you know so see you have to express what you know a woman needs to hear what you know and the brother said Amen brother brandom I believe desperation was a good message from God I believe it was I can amen it yes and how pretty she is and how much you love her if you don't do that she'll never know it because a woman has a built-in insecurity about her you read books and things about women women are constantly battling insecurity am I pretty enough am I smart enough uh does he love me is our marriage on the right place am I okay did I do anything wrong she has a built-in insecurity and so God made the man he's supposed to be a fighter he's supposed to be a conquer he's supposed to go after her and win her heart and love her and keep loving her and keep meeting her need praise the Lord and how does he do that through the love of Christ so it's not selfishly motivated it's motivated by Christ love when he has a lot of Love Of Christ in his heart he'll of course love his wife that Christ gave him if you don't do that she'll never know it that's the way if you do love her you express it yeah and I know Brothers some of us have had hard childhoods and things like that like I said my my mom and dad never told me they love me never so as soon as I was old enough to get girlfriends I always say i' love you because I always want to hear somebody say they love me back I knew my mom and dad loveed me but they never told me so I always was want to have somebody love me tell me you love me and still this day I love words of affirmation that's the five love languages that's a whole another book but I just love when people tell me something like really Glory because I never had that as a child I always uh always wanted someone to tell me so and sometimes it's it's it's so bad sometimes it would be so bad I'm like fishing for compliments I just try to get some feedback from somebody like I go up to my uncles and say you what can I do to be a better husband and they're like you're doing doing fine you're doing a great job he said you know they said you know why you do that Jess you know why you come up and ask men all the time for advice is because you're so insecure because your dad never told you that when you were younger I started crying I said you're exactly right my dad never said I was doing good he would he would slap me on the back and joke around with me you know I'd win state championships and I'd win all these I'd break all these records and still I just wanted somebody to tell me I was doing good I just wanted my dad and mom to tell me that but they just weren't built like that that's not their build that's not their ja up so now God showed me these things oh okay that I now I have the love of Christ now I can forgive them I don't have to hold that against them they're just a different kind of person but now I can love them back the way they need to be loved praise the Lord so I won't be selfish and say well because they didn't love me I'm not gonna love them back I'm gonna say well I got so much love of Jesus I can love them back even if they don't know how to love yet because I'm hoping one day they learn how to love am amen I don't have an excuse to sit back and say well because I wasn't loved I'm not going to love back that's selfish that's prideful but when you got the love of Christ you can't help to express it to somebody amen so if you never tell your wife how's she gonna know a woman is built to be like I said insecure so the man can keep coming and telling like every time my wife cooks a meal you can ask my children I say children what do we tell Mom for supper and they all say thank you Mommy it's delicious all these things like that I try to do that every Mother's Day I try to pour out love on my wife every time there's an anniversary pour out love because she needs to know that she's loved and think of the type does the church need to know that the church do you need to know that Jesus loves you every now and then does every enjoy that when the spirit comes down and he just makes love to you anybody like that out there anybody like the love of Jesus and the Pres of God and all brother said the espousal kisses where you kiss your soul he said when you're born again amen who don't like that that yeah who don't like to be loved he said that's the way we do to God when we love him we want to tell him about it that's why the song service is so important it's your chance to tell Jesus I love you amen we sat down and AD door him and worship him see love drives us to that brother brandom I love the Lord but for the past year I've been faced with a problem seems sometimes I'm almost out of my mind what was it please pray for my husband usband and I he says well if you done anything wrong and you're not condemned of anything perhaps it's your nerves maybe it's a woman here might be in the menopause time that's when everything's wrong with her and there's nothing wrong with her yet everything's wrong with her and she's not just putting on she really feels that it's just as real any person that's nervous is that way and don't never disagree and you husbands to your wives when they're in that time of life so when you get in your 40s or whatever it is 30s 40s 50s whatever that time of life life is brother BR tells the husbands he said when you're in that time of life if she ever was your sweee heart you let her be right then because she needs you she really needs your help she needs someone to help her and understand her talk to her take her up in your arms like she was your sweetheart and she should be and understand her because she's going through a time that her entire makeup is changing you know all the hormonal changes women go through after they can't have kids anymore that's menopause and you must be good to her at that time but not at that time all times but especially at that time when they're going through the changes and everything's wrong but everything's right all at the same time that's when a man really has to love his wife that's what a prophet of God said amen here's another quote Fellowship 1960 and you live in a three house first you have a kitchen next you have a parlor next you have is a bedroom notice a young couple before they can comp complete in that fio love or the F love what's the first thing that they make a promise to one another then they get married and they live in this three- room house now notice this now as he comes they come into the kitchen what to eat you eat in the kitchen that's your first next you go into the room to talk things over talk she needs conversation she needs affection hugs kisses love all these things and she needs a affection I'm sorry affection and conversation talk things over recognition making all your confession honey I'm sorry I didn't mean to say this forgive me I don't want to do that anymore it was my fault but then when you get into the bedroom it is when your married life is completed so brother completely shows it first you got to have communion around eating and then you got to come and have some fellowship confess all the sins and then you can complete your wedding in the bedroom amen he said because that's where life moves song so that's the final that's the completion of a married life amen you still love me Church Amen Brother John is there going to be a vote afterwards about the next Pastor for this church okay let me know the bylaw say I gota at least know you're gonna vote on it okay all right that's the bylaws Okay the third one is financial support great job 10 years is pretty good though if you vote me out for 10 I made 10 the decade's pretty a 10 a tithe financial support uh she's got to have it now we're not going to read all these this is I don't think this is a major problem here now it might be a major problem Brothers if we work too much praise the Lord Ian I talk with all the brothers you talk with me we all can work too much sometimes can't we let's just be honest we all can do it sometimes we can't help it sometimes we can help it so God help us to be able to balance it but 2 Thessalonians 310 through2 says a man that doesn't work shouldn't eat uh God this is Genesis 2 God told Adam to work and subd do the the the garden 1 Timothy 58 I don't remember that one let me read that one I got it 1 Timothy 58 but if any provide not for his own and especially for those of his own household he yet denied the faith and is worse than an Infidel okay that's for a man that won't work and provide okay and Colossians 3:23 and 24 I don't remember that one I think it that's work with all your heart if I'm not mistaken Colossians 3 so she's got have financial support she's got to have somebody if she's a stay at home she needs somebody to support her okay yeah knowing that of the Lord you shall receive the reward of the inheritance for you serve the Lord Christ I like that you serve the Lord Christ but he that doeth wrong shall receive for the wrong no I'm sorry I I skip verse 23 and whatsoever you do do it hardly as to the Lord and not unto men knowing that of the Lord you shall receive the reward of inheritance for you serve the Lord Christ okay yeah so whatever work you do do it with all your heart so most Brothers in here do a lot of great work in their hearts uh and they they work really hard for their families praise God at least as far as I know Brothers any any brothers been late to work lately and sleeping and their alarm's not going off anybody any any brothers proud of to admit that well we had one hand raised I was late a few years ago you know just traffic I left late and then we had traffic I was late once once or twice but one thing I don't want to be late for Church yeah praise the Lord yeah because this is the meat that won't perish yes sir I don't want to be late for church yeah I'd rather be late brother M said you it'd be better to miss work than it would be to miss service amen I got a quote on that you want to see that okay should a person pay ties to an individual or should a Christian work sure he should he's the man that will work as a Christian now if a man sick and his now this is get on a different thought if a man is sick and his wife can't work I mean if he can't work I don't blame his wife has got to make a living that's right but if she's just out working to have a little extra money you better keep her away from that scalawag Bunch uh I know a marriage uh that was in the message at the time is no longer the message and it never came to this church just so you know uh the husband got really greedy for money so he made he forced his wife to go out and work and then men started hitting on her and she hated it but he forced her to do it because of money and they they were in the message at the time this quote I don't know if this quote ever got to them but this this situation was a reality of this quote women don't belong out there with a bunch of lustful men that are beasts can I say it like that they're beasts without the Holy Ghost yes sir and they look at a woman and young women and just you sisters Know a Man without the Holy Ghost most of them look at women as just a sex object yeah right is that true Brothers right that's nothing but that's pretty flat but that's pretty true a man is so built like that with a testosterone that's all he thinks about is this his next uh conquering of a woman is this his next pleasure is this his next that or that if a man don't have a clean mind he's not pure by the Holy Spirit he's nothing but a beast he's Savage right that is that true yeah it's true that's why sister you don't hang around people that don't have are born again you don't hang around with people one-on-one like that with brothers that are one-on-one don't hang on around like that keep yourself pure you don't know what a man will do they're they're without the Holy Ghost they cannot trust them right now he goes on to say this again and Mister you might call yourself ever so good but if you got lodes and other things that calls you away from her at night you ought to be ashamed of yourself so things that keep you away from your wife at night now if Brothers got to work third shift that you know that's part of life um but if you got other things that you don't need to miss or that you could miss and you're purposely staying away from your wife at night that's wrong God gave you a home to cherish and comfort and things like that it's a shame to see the way man does their wives and wives do man the Womanhood and fatherhood of the nation is Tor to Pieces divorce courts piled full see they purpos it now how can they be married look at this church how can they be married on their wedding day and so in love and then a few years later I'm not even gonna go home I don't even want to go home to see my wife what happened there what happened how can they be so much in love and then a few years later they don't even want to be together they'll purposely make excuses to stay away from home what is that what spirit is that ain't the holy spirit because the holy spirit said I promise you God I'm going to love her like she needs to be loved sir 1950 I love you how brother promises father-in-law hes uh Hope's dad he said I promise you I'll love her with all my heart I'll work till my hands bleed to make her living and I'll be as true to her as I know how to be oh thank you Jesus amen let's say praise the Lord ready praise the Lord I'm trying to close I'm going about an hour and a half so get in 10 more minutes I'll have an hour and a half in that's usually about normal for me you you're such a wonderful audience church we appreciate your your your uh your uh your attention now see I won't be able to preach a Sunday for you for a while so just bear with me here yes and I don't know who's staying for the second service and like I said it's a whole different topic but uh I want to make sure I get through these okay family commitment now she's got to have family commitments and this is separate from just working and making money this is separate this is spiritual leadership she's got to have a spiritual leader in the home now this is Genesis 18 this is where uh God said I know Abraham will command his children and his servants after him to keep the will of the Lord so see Abraham was a commander he taught his children he C he taught his servants he was a teacher in his home and and the brother said and if you're the Seed of Abraham let's do the same thing Abraham seed Deuteronomy 11 is where God tells Moses tell the children of Israel when they come into the promised land he said talk about the Commandments of God and you're laying down and you're rising up at the table as you walk as you work he said put him on your forehead put him on the doorpost this is how a man is committed to his children he talks them about the Lord amen glory that's was before the Holy Ghost came in the baptism okay and Colossians 3:21 I'm gonna read that because I'm already in Colossians 3 oh yeah fathers provoke not your children to anger so provoke means a stir up fathers should stir up their children not to anger but to happiness or some motivation amen husbands we are supposed to stir our children up that's right I'm not talking a a protoplasmic spanking that's I'm not talking about that although they need that sometimes but what I'm talking about is you're we're supposed to be able to deal with our children to stir them up not to get angry but to get motivated to do something right whether it's to learn how to handle money or learn how to work or learn to be better in school we're supposed to Ser them up to want to do better not to get them angry but to get them to serve God okay but if you do that lest they be discouraged so you can always tell a child that isn't being father the right way because they're disheartened and they're spiritless they're just kind of it's going along there's no heart now when they get a teenager sometimes it just happens you might be the best parent in the world but they're just going through all those emotions and hormones and things like that okay so a woman's got to have this now let's look at this brother R talks about the family altars got to be established God I pray you'll mend up the broken homes I pray God will do that this morning amen there's any broken homes here God I pray you'll men up the broken homes and make the ones that's in homes that's indifferent fathers and mothers who doesn't pray give them an experience tonight that they'll start a family altar at their house amen Revelation 1961 we want to start the year off right see serving the lord how many got this morning and thanked him for the year old or the old year what it meant and asked him and said forget my back year forget the last year he said we did at the bedside when we got up so brother got up and prayed with his family right by the bed and then come to the table where we usually have a little family altar they gather on the table and pray so mother ad prayed at his bedside and then they prayed at the breakfast table together that's having a family altar in your house and so we always try to make it a habit of praying of a night before we go to bed I have since I was first converted get up in the morning and it's too dark and too Misty for me to walk I don't know where I'm going but if I just ask him to take my hand and guide me he'll guide me throughout the day amen glory each one of you is a Creator did you know that each one of you people that's born again as a Creator we must create an atmosphere as I said the other night you fathers you mothers are you ready to establish an altar in your house and take that television out or take that internet out of your kids' hands amen yeah anything that's drawing them away from Christ we got to take it out of their hands take it out of take it out of our hands too right are you ready to get that deck of cards off the table them comic books that your children's reading preparing their little mind for a blast the devil's gonna give them that's why you better be careful with video games a video game can be just like a comic book preparing them for Destruction amen praise God don't give them anything you make sure you preview it first and the holy spirit inside of you says it's okay are you ready to establish your old family altar again or you just want to continue on the way you are oh my he said you gotta want to die now you know the story God's apron Prophet I love this story brother comes into his house and uh the kids are all screaming and his wife's about crying and he tries to change the atmosphere tries to be a Creator he says honey I like to talk to you about some blouses she said but Billy I don't have no time to talk about and no blouses he said I kept my hand on look how he brings peace to the home he keeps reaching out and touching or showing affection sisters like to be hugged don't they sisters like to have their back scratched or whatever you know you know I'm not sure whatever and she said well I said look I'll tell you what Let's do let's get supper right quick and when we do I'll take it and show you it I'll go buy you the blouse oh that's nice you Billy but I couldn't take a look at a blouse tonight just look at me but look honey oh if you'd ever see it I believe you'd want to buy it and I'm praying Lord quieten her holding my hand on her look he keeps touching her maybe maybe her back and I said I tell you what you put me on your I'm sorry you put me on your apron let me help you get supper now if I put my wife's apron on at home I would look ridiculous it's got pink and dots and I'm like my goodness I can I rather just get dirty than wear an apron myself that's normally what I do but if I I do help out at home I do wash dishes I do help cook sometimes and different things like that I do sweep and I take out the trash and recycle and clean out the fridge and I do the grocery shopping I do whatever I can do to help out the home but look what he does he said I'll put on your Rob or your apron and I'll help you get supper ready because she's already frazzled and she needs some help so he says I can help you Brothers can we maybe find some ways to help out at home maybe by God's grace if we pray about it maybe we can if brother brand could help out we can help out yeah and so I put this apron on you know you imagine brother Brandon honey tie the back string oh that's too tight can you loosen it I'm just dramatized can you imagine a prophet of God rebuking demons off and Cancers and all these things seeing cancers leave and vanish and all these Supernatural things seeing eyes form and he says can you put this apron on me honey real quick that's a real man yeah I said that's a real man yeah I said brother Brandon was a real man yeah amen see because love condescends down to someone's lower level in other words love serves love sees someone hurting and goes down to their level a woman's role was below brother Ram's level but because he loved her and because he wanted to help her he had to condescend and come down to her level same thing God did God was way above our fleshly level but he condescended and created a body in the Virgin womb of Mary and Condes himself down and became flesh and lived in flesh and died to death that we might Ascend into heaven amen glory hallelujah amen and I begin to chop up some carrots and things you know going on some those Brothers might chop off our fingers if we try to do that but be careful Brothers if you haven't chopped carrots in a while right he chopping carrots he got his apron on you imagine brother BR he said but I kept talking to her changing that atmosphere laying my hand on her praying in his heart that's a real man and as soon as I got her quiet after a while she was all smiles can you imagine going from tears to Smiles well Billy do you think the stores will be open she's like okay I want to take that out of your word now you said we're going down shopping let's go down shopping now you promised me a blouse you promised me a dress oh you I wonder if those doors open Billy you want to go down well I'm pretty sure they will be I said I think they will be I thought thank you Lord it's working so just kept on the first thing you know be Sarah and Becky divide up their blocks and Joseph got him a little Rattler and there was peace in the home how many you want peace in the home oh that's just all what we want we just want peace in the home Church how does it do it you must serve somebody else Brothers you got to condescend and serve those of lower estate or sisters if our brothers if the husbands can't get the victory you gotta you got to serve them you got to project love brother BR said I love this if it can be done in the home home it could be done at church glory amen if love can change your atmosphere at your house it can change the atmosphere here at church just gotta love each other did y'all know that brother said all these things or is this all new to everybody is this is this old is this old it's real it's exactly what he said okay all right now this is the same story yeah I'm G let's get past that okay I'm trying to get down here okay honesty and openness this is one's critical this one is absolutely critical and let me say like this is this is the one I struggle with sometimes because when I was younger I would lie a lot I would steal a lot I was very dishonest that was kind of in my my atmosphere and so I've got I've I've had to learn over the years to be very careful to be totally honest with my wife tell her everything and be open to tell her what I'm thinking what I'm doing I struggle with that as a child I would lie and tell do tell things right and things like that now there's all kinds of scriptures on this so I'm just going to get to the quotes by said be honest with all men um I love this one Jesus said if you're my friends I tell you everything that I do so Jesus the husband tells the bride everything Abraham oh this God tells the secrets to his children Israel I love this one let's read that one Psalms 325 let's if you got your Bibles let's read that you'll like that one because Genesis 38 is Adam hiding from God and brothers that's what I struggle with and that's what a lot of men struggle with they hide when they sin they hide instead of just going to confess it uh Psalms 325 I think as humans that's what we all do because the Bible said Adam and Eve both hid from the Lord but um we know we know men are supposed to be leaders they supposed to be bold but when they fall short many times they just hide there so they don't tell anybody but the Lord sees all of it and he'll help us to overcome it okay Psalms 325 I acknowledge my sin unto thee and my iniquity have I not hid I said I will confess my transgression unto the Lord and thou forgave us the iniquity of my sin Saya praise God so Adam hid the sin but David said I think this yeah this is David but David said I didn't hide my sin glory and if we're Christians we shouldn't hide our sins a woman needs honesty and openness brother B said if there's anything that's a hindrance to Christianity Today is the way that Pro professed Christians live dishonest dishonorable and living any way don't do that we are Christians don't say nothing but what's the truth then you can always tell the truth every time and God will honor the truth he says she's not a door man but you should sit down and talk to her and reason with her and tell her and read the Bible and pray together see she needs someone who's honest and open won't hide things from his wife now there's a there's a secret there's a certain line there my wife and I talk about it from time to time Jesus said don't let your right hand know what your left hand's doing so there's times where I've given to PE given things away whatever more and not told my wife and then you know it's kind of hurt her feeling sometimes but I say well honey I'm just trying to follow what the Lord said but I'm trying to learn how to do that though because my wife sometimes likes to know about that so I'm just praying and ask the Lord to leave me I don't have the absolute answer on that I don't think every time I have to tell my wife or I should have to tell my wife and it's not that my wife wants to know every time I'm just saying well that's one thing we've always wondered about if you don't let your right hand know what your left hand's doing how does that work with marriage the wife don't sometimes like to be surprised or you know uh kind of some surprised I'll just say it like that okay look what brother says about mothers she'd appreciate you a whole lot more if you just sit down and talk with her just a little bit and write her a line Pat her on the shoulder kiss her on the cheek mother's like that okay tell her you love her it'll go a lot farther than all the flowers you could buy from the Florest now this is uh openness and honesty here's what I like the most God's great mystery what the Eternal God had as a mystery has now been unfolded in Jesus Christ and given right down to his church Jesus listen making love to the church's bride Whispering secrets to her has he ever whispered a secret to you his will or his word or his Revelation yeah and now he types this to a married couple Jesus Whispering secrets to the bride is like a husband Whispering secrets to his wife you know how you tell your wife things you know the little girl you're going to marry you love her so much you just tell her the secrets and get her up next to you and you love and love you and everything you know how it is you know how it is he said that's that's what God Christ is doing to the church he's letting her to know the secrets just the secrets not these flirters amen we don't flirt with the world we're just true to Christ amen I mean his wife see you know now look by having the revelation of a secret May known to them by his grace how the grace of God but the secret that God is sharing with the whole church if they would just receive it now let me read this Christians are called to have the mind of Christ how many know that this is an anti type of a marriage relationship as the wife needs to know the mind of her head her husband the husband must be open and honest with his plans for their life as they Heirs of the grace of life together that's why the said we're supposed to have the mind of Christ we're supposed to know what Christ wants well see it hurts a wife if the husband doesn't tell her what he's thinking and what she's doing because he is her head Christ is our head he tells us what he's doing so Brothers we should pray and get the leading from God and tell our wives what we feel led to do praise God oh my I don't know if I can finish this you sure are patient church here I'm trying to relax trying to finish notice there's nothing that God could give a man outside salvation better than wife now notice no person can console or confide when they're tired they won't confide in anyone like they do their wife I've read this one before I don't know I'm going to Define it she can do more with you than anybody else he said the greatest thing God give man out of Salvation was wife she was to comfort him to help him bless him and console him and be a real companion to him so what do these mean what's console wives are we doing this and husbands will we let will we let our wives do this wives Soul means to alleviate alleviate the grief and sense of loss or trouble or Comfort why should comfort their husbands when they're down and men should be able to confide in their wives brother brandom said imparting secrets that's what brother brandom said that Christ is doing to the church amen does everybody like that wives should comfort their husbands then H husbands should confide their secrets in their wives because they are the head of the wife this is scriptural because when Isaac's mother died he was comforted after his mother's death through the fellowship of his wife Rebecca so when Isaac loved Rebecca he was comforted or consoled by her all right let's stand to our feet I'm going to close with this husband has a shield I'm just going to go through this quickly here husbands are a shield those are the five things she needs now different women have different ones which is the top one and that's what I want we that's what I want to do next time when I'm here preaching on a Sunday I want to have you sit down and maybe we'll do as part of a service or something like that or maybe make the PM service I want you to sit there and talk to your whis Whisper back and forth to your husband and wife and say which one is the most important for you which one is the mo how can I love you better and we need to do that by God's grace if we're going to have Christ in the home we got to have love in the home got to have strong homes and you have a strong Church by God's grace so a husband has a shield let me read this quote here but bam says okay man said this I'm sorry it's so small please don't try to read that that it's really going to hurt your eyes okay this is we have seen this star now he found out right away he married her Joseph he was no more question then he took to marry the wife and knew her not as a wife until that child happy about it he was glad to be Mary Shield he was glad to Bear her reproach so he was a shield to his wife when a man can be revealed that Jesus Christ is the same yesterday today and forever no matter how many Creeds try to turn it back you're glad to be a shield you're happy to be a shield let them say whatever you got a big Shield up there to knock off the fiery darts amen does everybody see how he did that yeah all the reproach was coming on Mary Mary you're you're a forn care to marry or this or that and the husband stood right there and said no she's not and he stood right there as a shield I'm going to protect my wife from all these evil darts now look what I this is what the book says when he loves when he loves her with Christ's love he's protecting her from The Temptations reproaches that Satan constantly throws at women now sisters I'm taking this from the book do you constantly wonder if you're pretty or not for your husbands do you constantly wonder that this is what they said 99% of women have struggle with these these thoughts am I pretty so Satan's throwing fiery darts you're not pretty enough you're not pretty though does he really love me and there's a dart oh he doesn't love you he doesn't love you he married you but now he doesn't love you he doesn't love you like he used to these are darts being fired at your wives husbands is my marriage secure that's a dart shooting it at him all the time I don't know if my marriage is secure is it on the rocks or what's going on this is a dart that Satan Fires at couples especially women I'm sorry should I go back to worldly clothes or go back to makeup or am I not pretty enough or all these temptations that they're struggle with even single women even married women is that right sisters that's right and you think well they ought to be stronger well they're just as strong as you are when you have your mind battles amen Brothers you fight mind battles too Brothers they're a weaker vessel of course but they're still human and they still get attack and Satan Works harder on the woman than he does on the man and the church said amen you're not praying and Satan can you imagine Satan standing back there gets up there pulls back releases all these darts on your wife all day long and then when the husband walks in he don't even want to talk with his wife and don't even want to hug her or give her a kiss or anything like that and all day long maybe maybe that's a really hard day and she's battling am I pretty enough does he really love me is my marriage secure should I go back into the world would it be better to go out of the world some kind of evil relationship or something like this and but if the man's anointed to the Holy Ghost he can be a shield for her amen he can walk in the door and be a hero Brothers Hallelujah he can walk in the door and be a gallant boyfriend again that's what we need in this hour church we need men that are LED of the Holy Spirit and brothers if you don't believe me ask your wife ask your wife on the drive home today they battle these things sisters battle these things and it takes a man who's LED of the Holy Ghost to realize god build her that way and God has anointed me to meet her needs and I'm going to stand there I'm going to block all the darts and say honey you are beautiful we're not judging your beauty by the devil's standards a bunch of painted bed Jezebels that are bound for hell that have no help no even hope to go to heaven or something like that we're not judging Beauty by that we're judging Beauty by the character of Christ and by the word of God amen amen and he stands there as a shield and he takes that D in and it blocks it from her say You're beautiful honey don't pay attention to what they say amen and yes honey I love you with all my heart sometimes I get distracted by work and sometimes I get distracted by these problems in the church and things like that but I love you with all my heart and I'll tell you about it more God helps me to do that and you got to stand there and say you are loved you are beautiful you are the woman for me you're the one God gave me you're the best thing God gave me outside of Salvation And yes honey our marriage is more secure than ever I love you more now than I ever have in my life I just need God's help to help me Express a little more amen and if you'll be patient with me if you'll pray for me honey this I told my wife a few years ago I told my wife honey can you just give me a few reminders from time to time on how I can love you better and so now she'll give me ideas on what to get her for Christmas and you know her birthday I thought thank you Lord I really need that so that's been helpful we got to stand there like a shield and bear the reproach of our sisters honey those worldly clothes all there all that that's just all the devil don't worry about that you just keep hiding you you you just protect the beauty God gave you hide it behind those modest garments because modesty is a Bible command and you'll surely go to heaven if you can if you can keep your life lined up with the word of God Amen God God thinks so highly of you you're his daughter conduct yourself like a daughter God now if only a husband can keep his word so in June Lord willing will identify the unique needs and most important needs of a couple let's bow our heads here praise God I got no musicians so I'm just going to talk with you a little bit this is an extremely personal topic I know that and church please I don't I'm not upset with any brothers I'm not upset with any sisters I'm trying to preach the word word and I'm trying to bring it in the in the power that it's given as I study and pray and seek God I'm trying to bring it in that way and church we don't expect overnight changes but we got to have an open heart to change now on either side how many would raise your hand and say brother just pray for me to be a better husband or a better wife help me to meet the needs of my spouse God bless those hands God bless those hands church it's it's it's reality let you can put your hands down now let me pray for you it has to be a reality it has to be where you wake up in the morning you got to start investing time into it you got to invest prayer into it you got to repent of the wrongs you've done if you haven't been committed to your family you got to repent to that if you haven't been affectionate you got to repent of that repentance is always the way back like brother man said I cut you real deep but there's some Bal and gilad this morning there's some there's some healing amen through what repentance and sisters I'll say like this some Brothers aren't ready to go into this yet so if not you got to pray and ask God to forgive them and give them Grace until they're ready to do it so let's pray together Heavenly Father Lord thank you for topics like this Lord I truly believe that with all my heart I believe you revealed that to me one day when I was studying on family I believe it dropped down in my heart from heaven where you said how is a marriage going to make it in the Rapture to the spiritual marriage if the natural marriages are not lined up with my word I believe you drop that down into my heart I believe that with all my heart because I see it all over the scripture I see it all through brother ROM's quotes all through his sermons we know brother brandom seemed to have his own little disagreements he said in his marriage Lord as we all do but Lord we're here today we're here in the now we're here trying to live right now in 2016 and we're trying to be better examples Lord you saw the hands that were raised Lord I pray for first for the husbands we'd have Gallant men here dear God we would have Gallant uh husbands dear Lord I pray that they would see themselves as a shield they can block the fiery darts of Satan that Satan shoots at their wives if they stand in the Gap and tell their wives you're beautiful I love you I love our marriage you're the best thing ever happened to me outside of Salvation God gave you to me I cherish you I honor you I will love you better help our brothers if they've made mistakes to say forgive me honey I made a mistake I'm going to try better pray with me pray for me that I'll do better next time I'll get the victory pray that God changed my character and my habits and my thinking that I take heed to my spirit forgive me if I've dealt treacherously with you and Lord give our sister special strength Lord if husbands aren't ready to go into this these type of things yet give them strike to be patient and wait upon you dear Lord that's that's extremely hard [Music] Lord Lord as our sisters lord they're the ones that battle insecurities Lord may you bring security to them may you bring Blessed Assurance to our sisters this morning may as as as the Holy Spirit would would you bring Brothers courage would you bring Brothers uh the anointing dear God to love will you give them a selfless service attitude dear God we don't want to play pretend message church and act like everything's right at church if things are not right at home we want to act the same way at home as we do church because we know there's creative power we want to create such an atmosphere in the home Lord God where there's love there where there's forgiveness and mercy and peace Lord as your brother as your Prophet said there was peace in the home help us to have peace in our homes Lord Lord I have gone long bless your children for being and so patient but Lord there's nothing more I'd rather go long on than the word of God people go long in sports games all the time people go extra long at work extra time but Lord there this is the meat we ought to labor for this is eternal life dear God thank you Lord so I thank you for letting us go a little longer dear Lord help us Lord to find our position in Christ help us to find what we need to do Lord may we talk to one another Lord as the couples may they fellowship may they sit down make confessions and Lord may they live in all three home or all three parts of the house and may they truly manifest the love of Christ I know i' I've preached a lot I know I've said a lot I know I've asked a lot but you
