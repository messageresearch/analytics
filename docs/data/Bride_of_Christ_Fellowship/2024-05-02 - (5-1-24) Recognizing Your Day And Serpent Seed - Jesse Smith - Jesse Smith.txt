========================================

three I'd like to uh continue that thought I started last Wednesday night you know we sang that song I Just Want to Thank You Lord so we looked at recognizing your day well this week I listened to serpent seed and then uh perfect Faith Listen to Perfect Faith two times and then serpent seed twice and uh I started a third time on perfect faith today so I don't know if I'll get to perfect Faith tonight but uh we'll definitely do uh serpent seed tonight by God's grace and you know like I said I'll bringing out you know numerous thoughts or highlights from this sermon from 1958 but let's read Genesis 3:15 very familiar scripture grace of God maybe lyd can you give me a favor honey I forgot my 12 New Testament Mysteries book in there can you get it I think it's up against the wall I just want to read those nine points about the serpent seed that kind of prove it just as a visiting that one by God's grace thank you probably doesn't impact many people but I ordered 10 more copies of my books I ran out of the 12 mystery books been given a lot out um so I order 10 so if anybody wants one or wants to give one away you know they'll be in probably this week or next week and of course you can take anything out there give it away whatever you feel that to do by God's grace it's so wonderful you know Rod one to Ros and you know my brother thankful for that oh yeah I had another trucker uh I don't know one time I told you we pray for a man named Ralph he's a trucker and he said he's read through one of my books and was really blessed he was blessed to know that he saved by grace through faith you know a simple just a simple justification Doctrine he said God bless you for you know writing that and really helped me he must have been raised in maybe like a legalistic type of environment or something but just like Sunday morning I was so blessed to hear that message this is who we are I just I need reminders about who I am tell me Lord once again who I am to you amen Genesis 3:15 very familiar of course here's where God originated the serpent Seed doctrine Genesis 3:15 maybe wouldn't maybe we wouldn't call it a Doctrine necessarily I don't mean to be too technical but it's just a revelation I I put it in as part of the the mystery of iniquity how iniquity came into the world here's where it came in Genesis 3:15 so let's read that on three one two 3 and I will put enmity between thee and the woman and between thy seed and her seed it shall bruise thy head and thou shalt bruise his heel let's have one more word of prayer ask God to bless our preaching here tonight father God we thank you for tonight Lord thank you God that we're on the highway to Heaven Lord God hallelujah we want to have pure hearts Lord God so we ask Lord tonight you use this sermon faith comes by hearing so Lord speak to our hearts may we have faith God as we approach you here Lord to hear your word father Lord you know I've listened to these messages and trying to pull the inspiration from the Holy Spirit Lord I just kind of caught this inspiration recently Lord I want the Saints to know what we're singing about especially in this case lord it's a great review for me as well so father may we just be seated in Heavenly places here tonight Lord uh reminding us Lord we're already accepted in the Beloved Hallelujah we already have a theophany waiting there for us hallelujah in the Heavenly Dimension Lord God so we thank you for these blessings Lord anoint me anoint your people here tonight in Jesus Christ name and Saints said amen God bless you as you're being seated praise God thank you Lydia oh you didn't find it okay what did I do with that maybe I gave it away I must have gave it away all right no problem I think I got a PDF copy here so uh if you haven't listened to recognize your day's message or serpent seed or perfect faith I would encourage you to do that I really enjoyed it uh this week listen to that sorry I can't find that there it is okay okay so thank you for your patience here there it is I wanted to get those nine just to review real briefly here by the grace of the Lord nine points proven the serpent SE we've taught on this uh preached on this a little bit maybe not a whole lot um still kind of scrolling to see if I can find it oh there it is okay all right there thank you Lord I think I gave the last book away last week by God's grace brother Mercy took one and then the brother who came visited with him okay all right so we're set here thank you for so uh you know last week I had to cut it a little short uh you know I kind of went long but I had to cut short that sermon on recognizing your day and its message um one thing to keep in mind again is there you know we have a video about uh 30 different verses brother brandom used to tell us what the message of the hour is you know Acts chapter 2 acts 238 Malachi 45 and 6 Luke 17:30 brother random uses some of those verses here in this sermon recognizing your day and his message but the main parallel he was taking was from Hosea 6 you know showing that Israel was in a backsliding condition yet they were the people of God but God would promise to restore Hallelujah and God has to do that in the church ages we're seeing that now in the seventh Church age God is restoring Hallelujah uh we're we're part of the restored uh book of Acts Church praise God hallelujah we're so grateful to be a part of that and uh thankful that we have the doctrine the love the power uh the spirit of a Christian Hallelujah thank God that we can have that original apostolic faith in the word of God we got it back hallelujah amen we're a part of that Hallelujah of course you know if you weren't raised in the message you know most of us are raised in denomination you know we can clearly see a huge difference between where we are now to where we were raised Hallelujah we can see a massive difference Hallelujah that this is a true book of Acts church amen so uh I'm not going to read through those 30 verses but I do uh I could I could do that but I just want to refresh you there's so much verses that tell us what our message is for today Hallelujah and I'm going to set a timer here just so I can watch it all right and so you know when I finish I I finished last week's message with brother Ram's statement that oh I love to hunt and fish he said but one moment of this is better than all of that hunting and fishing in other words brother Ram's True Heart his true love was to be gathered with the Saints his time with the Saints in church was more important than his leisure time praise God and that's why I've always said you know our highlight to our week should be Wednesday and Sunday and if we have a Saturday night concert that should be the highlight too amen hallelujah whatever uh whenever uh whenever the Saints are gathered that should be a highlight to our week Hallelujah and uh I love seeing that from brother brandom now one thing I left out didn't have time was right after brother Bram prayed for the people for their bad habits they fluster which isn't a word by the way it's frustrations uh fights he said fights stews fusses uh he he prays for them and then he says he says do you feel you're ready for the last trumpet Hallelujah isn't that beautiful the power of prayer you could have a fight during the week you could have a fuss you could have a bad habit during the week but you can come to church you can pray you can confess your sins and you can worship and trust God and in that moment you can feel ready for the Rapture praise God I just thought it was beautiful how brother brand he goes from that just people the Christians battles to total forgiveness through the blood of Christ and now I'm ready for the Rapture I know I don't know about you but I left Sunday feeling ready for the Rapture I want you to leave here tonight feeling ready for the Rapture praise God I know we all up here Saturday night feeling ready for the Rapture and I know you know Sunday night was a little more sobering message but it it blessed numerous people we got a comment online and you know uh at home we talked about it how it was a blessing uh to get that good message on forgiveness Hallelujah and brother am just a preview brother am says in perfect Faith he said per perfect faith is based upon forgiveness so just I thought that was so important it's really timely too if Lord willing next Wednesday I preach on perfect Faith Lord willing we'll see where God directs me but how brother random uh or how brother Brooks would preach on perfect faith I'm sorry perfect forgiveness really and that's necessary in order to have perfect Faith so it's very very wonderful and again just so as a a a reminder perfect faith is simply you've got a revelation God revealed his will to you and you know it's going to come to pass it's basically a prophecy but as I said before in those moments you and I we not prophets we really don't know we're prophesying right we just might feel oh God's going to do something here I really feel God's going to answer this person's prayer right but none of us will stand there and say thus sayith the Lord you know God heard Haven's prayer you know like we just might have this unction though like really feel like God heard that prayer I really feel like that's going to come to pass how many you ever had that before so that's like a prophecy right but we're not prophets where we'd have enough uh lead leadership to say that's thus sayith the Lord right that's a whole another level of a gift level of Faith level of Prophecy discernment you know it's it takes a higher level it takes a greater gift to say say something like that so uh brother Ram says he says you feel good now the congregation says amen you feel it's already now he said let's sing uh when the RS Called Up Yonder so they sing a couple of verses through that then he says he says let's raise our hands and say by thy Grace Lord the Cong says by thy Grace Lord uh when the RO is Called Up Yonder I'll be there how many trusting in God's grace amen oh yeah Hallelujah and then he says he ends this is the last quote I'm going to read and then we'll move on to serpent seed oh won't that be a time now listen here he's describing the day of the Rapture just walking along someday and hears appear somebody who is it mother amen it ain't going to be long now that's what we'll say if we see a loved one it ain't going to be long now now remember this is based upon Matthew 27 right they saw the dead Old Testament Saints rise first and then there was a resurrection 50 or I'm sorry uh 40 days after that sorry 40 days they were seen 40 days 40 days after that that's why brother B said about a month and a half after the the dead in Christ rise we'll be gone in the Rapture now it's not a th say the Lord but it's sure it's a scriptural pattern so we believe we could be wrong but we believe God do the same thing at the at that Resurrection as he did the same thing he did there he'll do it again by God's grace so you'll see someone that's passed on oh it's brother so- and so or brother Keith might see his wife Judy it's Judy I know I know it ain't going to be long now I mean it it could be that near right or it might be in another generation we don't know but that's the reality where brother Ram tries to bring it down confess all your bad habits your fights your stews your fluster and feel ready to go in the Rapture praise God that's how he ends this sermon what a beautiful thought recognize your name's message just in a few minutes you're changed he says and we'll meet them then be caught up together with them to meet the Lord in the air oh in a moment in the twink of an eye see now he named some brothers from his church that died he said here is brother Seward that old brother that used to be at the church here why here's brother dear you've heard probably on tape brother dear here's brother so and so well look you here they're all around me now wouldn't that be something amen hallelujah where you see in Saints all around you that were dead but now they're alive amen but we know in Christ you never die anyway cuz God is not the god of the Dead God's the god of the living hallelujah amen he said look they're all around me what's the matter here in just a few minutes I know they've done appear to me it ain't going to be long now I'm going to be changed now just in a moment oh yes he says when the morning breaks Eternal bride and fair Hallelujah now just as a side note brother BR said some some morning between 6 and 9 or 7 and 9 the Rapture would happen now we don't have any thus sayith the Lord for that that's the first watch of the day in Jewish time from 6:00 am to 9:00 am is called the first watch a watch lasts three hours right and so they would have that now the reason I don't know the reason but it seems the reason to me brother R thought that is because of Jesus resurrection it was right in the morning right that's when the dead in Christ Rose after Jesus rose it would have been early in the morning also you have the Holy Ghost fell at 9:00 a.m. on day on the day of Pentecost 9:00 a.m. is about the third hour of the day hallelujah amen you got some pretty good events that happen before 9:00 a.m. we don't like to get up before 9:00 a.m. or you might like to sleep in past 9:00 a.m. but God does a lot of great things before 9:00 a.m. the greatest day in history was of Resurrection Hallelujah right after 6:00 a.m. Hallelujah the first watch right right before you know uh you know the the women went went to the the the the Great grave the supplier right before the sun rose and when the natural sun rose the spiritual sun rose hallelujah amen well this be morning people I'm sure that morning we will be morning people you know why because we'll see them all around us hallelujah well there's brother so and so there's brother numer right Julia's dad passed away a number of years ago there's brother numer what other message people have passed away that we could say who is it brother there's brother James Browning amen hallelujah oh can you imagine seeing some of these Saints Hallelujah back from the dead Hallelujah am amen won't be long now he says now I want to get into this serpent seed sermon now from it's September 28th uh 1958 this is the first time think of that it's the first time he preached it think of that um and if you know anything about the message it's uh about6 minutes long so about a little over hour and 46 minutes um and if you know anything about it he he preaches on something else for the first 36 minutes he doesn't even talk about serpent seed for the first you ever done that before when I first came in the message I'm like I'm going to go listen to serpent seed I'm like when is he going to talk about serpent seed yeah haven't talked about the first 36 minutes I'm like when I got the right sermon here they did they put the right title on here well after 36 minutes he breaks into it because he spends the first 36 minutes reviewing his sermon why we're not denomination that's the sermon brother amen came into the message that that God had me preach back there in 2014 I always remember that so he SPS the first 36 minutes going over some of those major topics and then he says let me show you where all that came from and he goes back to Genesis right so where does the denomination come from Genesis any man-made religion comes from Genesis and who's the first man religion Cain right he goes back to Cain think about that to to to ask yourself where does the Catholic Church come from where does the Assembly of God you know where does the Christian Missionary Alliance where does the Baptist where does it come from Cain think about that where's brother Rah go to to find where do denomination start Genesis chapter 3 I'm sorry chapter 3 I'm sorry Genesis chapter 4 sorry Genesis 4 where Cain sets up his altar right and he gets rejected Abel gets accepted because he brought the blood amen God always wants blood Hallelujah now um I want to just read a few important quotes out of here like I said I got about 40 or 50 minutes left on my hour here he starts by reviewing why we're not a denomination and he said I he said uh I've got to be so hard he said I've got to make it real strong against denominations he's going to tell us why at the end it's quite a statement he's going to tell us why at the end he says and this morning I believe uh he says the different articles that's come out through denomination that's absolutely not spoken the Bible so you know dominations put out they have conferences and they put out changes every year right Kristen used to be a part of the Lutheran so over the years we paid attention to a few we've I mean Lutheran changes have made headlines that's how we found out about it we don't keep track on them but you find out about it where they ordain women preachers or they accept homosexual clergy or whatever more you just they put brother says they're constantly putting out these articles and they do and brother R said it's that Protestant churches are bowing down to and teaching for Doctrine to their Creeds the same thing that old mother prostitute the Catholic Church preaches and come out into the Protestant church we know the same thing which is contrary to anywhere in God's word so brother starts here by saying denominations put out false beliefs just like the Roman Catholic Church does okay so the same thing and I don't know if you saw recently did you see Candace Owens went back to the Roman Catholic Church see that she's a big uh what's they call a conservative voice right very smart woman very smart uh I wish I could debate like her you know much a debat her but she recently went back to the cath Catholic church and she said I'm going back home and that's that's what brother raham warned about all these Protestants are going back to the mother right I looked it up Mark Wahlberg you know I don't I don't think I ever watched a movie his but he's a famous person Jimmy Fallon I know who he is all all these celebrities numerous you know famous people are going back to the mother Harlot now church that just shows they never really had a real grasp on Protestant teaching Hallelujah they didn't really re realize what a Protestant was it's protesting the authority of the Pope Martin Luther only nailed 95 thesis against the church door in witenberg there I mean he only had 95 complaints against the pope how many complaints I have against Bram Tabernacle 24 right now I got 24 when I get to 95 Church you know where I'm going I'm going there newly constructed Tabernacle I'm not going to nail it on there I'll just tape it on there we'll see by God's grace I'm keeping track though I'm at I'm at 24 by God's grace but brother ad says you know he says the Catholic Church gave birth to Protestants and that's in I preach it many times Revelation 2 uh Jesus said because you didn't repent I'm going to throw the mother and her children into the bed and kill them with death now that's speaking of the white Throne judgment being cast into hell so in other words unbelievers Sinners yet they went to church they were associated with the mother Harlot and her daughters thank God he's caught us out of denominations hallelujah thank God you heard The Voice come on of her my people amen that you be not partakers of her sins and her plages Hallelujah my it's a blessing he said what'd she give birth to the Protestant churches exactly she did Brother BR makes a statement in this sermon he said John Smith the founder of the Baptist Church used to stay up at night crying because the women and men started wearing wedding rings now he wasn't crying over a scriptural matter let me make that clear don't feel bad if you're married don't feel bad if if you're wearing a wedding ring because I can show you where Jesus said the prodigal got a ring on his finger after he got saved well Rings aren't sin then Joseph was given a ring by uh Pharaoh right as long as there's a purpose for it there's nothing wrong with it now if you're going around saying look at my ring look how great I am oh let me flash that to you well now you're a sinner right you know now you're living at least a backslid in state that's what the Bible says you know expensive gold and jewelry and expensive braids you know hairstyles whatever more he said Paul said that's sin that's not a modest lifestyle we want to be modest hallelujah amen amen but he said John Smith used to cry and he said he' cry all night and he wake up with swollen eyes and his wife would have to feed him because he was crying about like Holiness standards and brother Bram said what would John Smith see today if he went to baptist churches and saw them with shorts on and miniskirts and showing and painting their faces and bobbed hair he said he'd roll over in his grave brother says look look at the progression of it right when was the last time you and I lost sleep over somebody's life understand what I'm saying like he's a sincere man John Smith a Baptist preacher so we have to understand this is how this is how sincere we should be about our faith now I believe we have the right balance remember a couple weeks ago I preached on Romans 13- 14 Paul said don't let anybody call your good evil he said but if it causes somebody stumble just do it between you and God right I was talking to brother Brooks I said afterwards you you know I was talking about we I somehow we talking about wine and I'm like uh I'm like do you know anybody that drinks wine at their house you know because that's a Christian Liberty somehow we got talking about that he's like yeah I know that's a Christian Liberty he said I don't know he said but I just condemn it he said because that's what I struggle with when I was out in the world he said so I preached against a real heart I said I like that brother Brooks Hallelujah I appreciate that man that's that's my brother you know that's my former Pastor you know I just thought wow he was he was so humble to say I struggle with that so I've got to stay so far away from it he said I can only drink it in the church but the then the interesting is see that like I've told you uh you know my flesh is still likes the smell of cigarettes I know it's hard to understand but that just a fleshly thing but see brother Brooks would realizes he'd be tempted if he did that in the home other people wouldn't I'm going to read you a quote later brother brandom had a convert named Rosella Griffith anybody remember her she was a total alcoholic she was down to what 100 pound maybe less she was dying from being a an addict on alcohol and nobody could heal her she couldn't get oh yeah she was clean for like six months but she still had she thirsted for alcohol liquor all the time she went to Brother R's meetings and he said instantly when brother R told discern her heart it instantly left she never desired one more one one more drop but then she was nervous she went to Brother R's church for communion and she said brother Ram should I have the wine brother Ram said you'll have no problems at all in the name of the Lord and from that day on she could drink alcohol every time at Communion and never had a Temptation again but see there's some people that will get total Victory some people have to keep their body and beat it under subjection the church said right so it's just really something it's we got to keep uh we got to keep under our body we have to know our battles we got to fight our battles Hallelujah keep the enemy off Hallelujah brother R said got to dodge all his punches right always got one little punch on you right he said but try to dodge the punches keep keep off as many punches as you can Hallelujah now uh brother Ram says how does the Roman Catholic Church rule in this sermon remember the first 36 minutes are about Rome basically and Protestants he says she rules over all the Earth spiritually speaking so somehow Rome has control over the entire world now we know some famous people are Roman Catholic like a lot of the famous American government leaders are Roman Catholic right our current Administration uh many of the Senate Senators and the house Representatives a lot of them are Catholic and they're the ones funding their Ukraine Wars right I saw a funny meme it showed you know uh Israel bombing Hamas and and uh it showed both the both of the uh the Rockets firing and it said funded by United States funded by United States both both both countries fighting got their money from the US to fight and who's in charge of the US mostly Roman Catholics and you can do the same thing with with Russia and Ukraine Russian bomb well I guess Russian maybe wouldn't be from us but Ukraine would be from us right so it's really something uh and it goes back to this idea where remember Ro Romans 18 all the deaths of the world are going to be put the blame is going to be put on the Roman Catholic church I preached on that before but just a reminder brother baham uh states that plainly now I want to read a statement here this may be brand new to you so if you have questions you can ask me in two Sunday nights but maybe you'll be familiar with this in this sermon there's a statement made he makes it numerous times and then he fixes it later on so I want you to hear this just because it's important for you to know if you've never heard it you need to hear this so you know this uh brother Jose really needed help with this when he first came in the message because his church that he was raised in was a return Ministry Church they basically worshiped the tapes right and he needed balance on this and then he found a quote and a letter from brother brandham that fixed this statement that brother bram's going to make here so he says the Bible claims the whole thing a prostitute Roman Catholic church protestantism now what are you going to do that's right and how the sins of the people will be visited we went back in Deuteronomy and showed that an illegitimate child here here's the topic a bastard child a child born out of wedlock in other words their parents weren't married but they had a child brother Ram said could not even enter the congregation of the Lord for 14 Generations think about that 14 that family couldn't go go to church for 14 Generations that's a long time that's a very long time he said that was under the law now look what brother says next and Christ come to magnify the law how much more is it now so you've had message preachers over the years I don't know Naomi if anyone in your family heard this you know growing up but I've heard of message preachers over the years that have said that they won't they won't dedicate a baby if it's born out of wedlock and and they'll preach across the pulpit that baby can't be saved so they might as well leave the church because of this quote now brother random fixes it by 19 uh 64 yes by 64 and brother brother brother brother Jose has this letter you can find it online where brother Ram wrote a handwritten letter to somebody saying oh no uh you know basically I I I learned more about this he said all babies go to heaven and all babies can be saved whether they're Bor not a w like w like or not the blood of Jesus Christ covers over them all so see brother man put two verses together but it wasn't quite the a right application right but I wonder what brandom Tabernacle says about that I'm gonna get to another one about that here in a little bit by God's grace see because you can see so much truth in his sermons but then he's got these human thoughts that God corrects him six years later six years later right there's 18 years worth of tape recordings and some of these these thoughts he has he has to grow and he gets progressive revelation right so did Abraham Glory so did job job thought I'm more I'm I'm a prophet I'm more just I'm I'm more just than God is well guess what God had to spank him a real good spanking and he had to have progressive revelation I heard about God I I lectured about God I preached about God but now I've seen God progressive revelation right for how many years uh I think it was 90 was it 90 uh 90 years well from 75 to 90 so uh was that 15 about 15 years Abraham thought the sea was going to come through Hagar progressive revelation he knew he was going to have seed as the stars and the sand but he thought it was going to come through Hagar God had to give him a progressive revelation Hallelujah and these people that I better not go on there Hallelujah so he takes magnify the law and then this uh wedlock scripture and says it's even more now now by 1964 they say dear brother brandom I like this question dear brother brand if a baby's born out of wedlock can the child ever be saved or go in the Rapture now I'm going to skip he said saved why sure I believe the child the child can't help what's been done that's true now about going in the Rapture he says but in the Rapture it's a predestinated seed that goes in the Rapture and I can't believe that adultery was a predestinated seed you see everybody catch that so brother says they can be saved now but he says they I don't see how they could go in the Rapture now what do we believe or what do I believe I believe a child of wedlock could go in the Rapture as long as they get the seed of God because the natural seed doesn't matter anymore it's all about being born again of The Incorruptible seed the word of God now I need to search this out I don't know if there's other quotes or brother BR fix it or not but then he goes through uh you know the Old Testament and a congregation for 14 Generations they were cursed he said but you see there's something there strong enough to forgive that sin the blood of Christ amen he said the blood of Jesus forgives sins it covers sins the blood of Christ divorces sin that's different now when the blood of Jesus comes it's different hallelujah hallelujah now this also goes in with that quote brother Ram said maybe maybe uh husbands and wives living in adultery maybe they can go in the Rapture brother said maybe maybe there'll be a chance for them to go in it's maybe right and we got to leave it up to God right because are you God are you God am I God no there's one God now we might have the mind of Christ but not in every situation Hallelujah so we want to we want to uh what's that song we we we listen that song from Micah uh walk humbly love mercy and and act justly was it act justly okay it's a beautiful scripture what does god require of us but love Mercy right love Mercy we should we would we we should think of wow that' be so lovely if God could fill a child born out of wedlock with the baptism of the Holy Ghost I believe it I believe he can Hallelujah absolutely because why CH why what does It ultimately go back to my reasoning no it goes back to the New Testament Hallelujah goes back to the New Testament and we don't see anything brought over from that scripture in Deuteronomy to the Gentiles in the New Testament remember that's the that that's the rule that that's the pattern if some if if if Paul repeats it in the New Testament it's in the Old Testament well then it continues and that's why I told somebody on on the uh email this week we got to be silent where the Bible's silent and we got to speak where the Bible speaks love Mercy act justly be humble I know I mixed that one up there by God's grace if you look it up okaya we'll read it can you look it up it's mic or something but while you're looking that up so see I don't know anybody ever heard that before okay uh born out of wedlock brother R said at first there's they can't even be saved then he says well they can be saved but I don't see how they can go to the Rapture okay so just so you know I believe if they got the Holy Ghost they're going to the Rapture I'm talking about in the soul right Hallelujah okay then he goes in depths into the Roman Catholic church and denomination where it started there and uh starts in Genesis 3:15 and this is where 36 minutes in he starts preaching on the serpent seed he said there's got to be a beginning of all all the things now I like this I'm just going to throw this in there because this made me feel good brother Ram reads about three poems or he recites three poems I don't know I I think they're Longfellow poems but he says here here's the poem it says how do you tackle your work each day are you scared of the job that you find can you stand right up to the work ahead have you got a tired and empty mind so just a fun little rhyme find and mind you know he says he said or do you stand up right to the work ahead or is fear ever running through it if so tackle the next thing you find he said by thinking you're going to do it so in other words if if you're discouraged and not sure what to do brother Ram said just think about it and go do it right we don't want to sit back and be paralyzed right remember we looked at the parable of the talents the guy with the one Talent he was afraid so he buried his talent in the earth I'm just going to use this simple example because Haven come up for prayer we feel like Haven's got a gift to write music you know she's wrote numerous songs and then write poems so Haven I'm just going to use you okay said and I said honey that's a talent right I don't have that talent I mean I wish I guess I've written my wife a few good love poems over the years you what do you think honey PR good pretty romantic probably not but you know but it doesn't flow out like uh you know when we were going through a the identity theft you know God gave Haven this long long poem I'll have to read it maybe maybe Sunday or something it's just beautiful Rhymes and everything kind of like this one but I I expressed her you know and I just preached I said honey and she got a whole notebook almost of poems I'm like here's your doubling your talents this this notebook represents you've doubled your talent in other words God might have give her a one Talent of a poem well you gotta you gota you got to work on that Hallelujah Church got to work on it if I say I'm a preacher but I never preach how am I ever going to increase my preaching gift I'm not right so whatever God's made you invest in it right say God here's the little gift you gave me I'm going to invest in it by God's grace Hallelujah so I said that little notebook with all those pages you know maybe half full I said that is your effort you're not hiding from that gift you're putting it to work Hallelujah all right so is that okay H all right give me a thumbs up there so little poems like that brother R love poems you know he wrote a poem about going out west a beautiful poem and finally fulfilled it you know he said I always was drawn out to the west and he had uh a leading to go out there now um we're pretty familiar with uh the serpent seed like I said I've got I think two videos on it I got a whole chapter on the mystery of iniquity I preached that whole chapter to you uh I think it was in 2022 if I'm not mistaken um so I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time on that um but I do want to read this quote again in this is from a different sermon the 70th week of Dan Daniel so about 3 years later brother R said the seed of the serpent that's the killer many people don't believe that but if you just read Genesis the Bible said the serpent had a seed and I'll put enity enity between the woman's seed and the Serpent's Seed see the serpent had a seed God said so if it's a Serpent's Seed was spiritual then Jesus was not a man so the woman's seed was spiritual he said they both had seeds the enity is still there the serpent had a seed and if you'll just take your Bible and get down and be real Reverend before God I believe God will reveal it to you now we can see it with the hamash and the Jews we can see the seed of God and the serpy right they hate them so much they're chanting on the college campuses death to Israel death to America some of these radical people right they started last week some of them are still going that that's how you always know the serpent seed death they want to kill God's seed now that's the manifested form of that the mature form of that right that's like Cain and Abel it boils down to that like the Pharisees against Jesus right Judas against Jesus it boils down to that and I've always thought you know that's interesting why is serpent seed such a killer Doctrine you know why does it kill people to think adultery was the first sin why does that kill people how could apples be the first sin who doesn't like apples I love apples who doesn't like a good apple crisp Mercy so I I'm not sure my my but my only thought is you know sexual perversion should be an obvious evil now I believe it's a killer because I believe a lot of these people have their own sexual sin that's my thought I could be wrong and they want to desensi desensitize themselves to the guilt of their sexual sin because how can apples cause someone to know they're naked it doesn't right so the serpent seed is part of this deeper brother say this is a deep teaching on the mystery of iniquity now I'm going to read those nine proofs again so just to kind of refresh you the Bible supports the serpent Seed doctrine from Genesis to Revelation Genesis and its numerous people in the New Testament wrote about it Moses Jesus Peter Paul John that's a pretty good group of preachers in the church said you got the preacher of preachers in there Jesus they all preach on two seeds amen all right the second reason now of course I have whole book on this the two trees in the midst of the garden were not literal trees because the tree of knowledge of good evil was not good for food God said all the trees are good for food and any tree that will kill you is not good for food so this was a different kind of tree third the tree of life was Jesus spirit because there's only one way to eternal life eating food has never been and will be the way to eternal life you say well we're going to eat fruits in the in revelation 22 the 12 fruits yeah but that's not what's going to give us eternal life we've already got Eternal bodies Hallelujah that might somehow sustain the life or somehow just be a refreshment to the life but we've already got eternal life hallelujah amen we got eternal life right now hallelujah amen it ain't going to come from a fruit it ain't going to come from 12 fruits every year you've already got it eternal life number four the serpent seed explains the purpose of the Virgin birth that's the most powerful one to me always wonder why did Jesus have to be virgin why why why why why why does it make any difference this is why because sin came into the world through adultery right absolutely makes perfect sense remember church that's the first sermon that brought me in the message serpent SE Adam and Eve fifth Adam and Eve covered their loins after eating the forbidden fruit not their mouths the punishment always fits the crime right and when God clothed them I looked I emailed somebody this week the Bible said it was a loin cloth from the shoulders all the way past the KNE that's what God gave them God didn't give them many skirts right or bikinis God didn't give them bikinis like they see on the like on the shows even uh what's that Christian one we watch super book even super books got bikinis on mind guys did some good research but you sure didn't do deep enough research time to go back to the research table but it the punishment always fits the crime number six God's punishments for Eve sin centered on her reproduction and her longing for Adam that's what the punishments centered around right the consequence now she's going to have pain in child birth because she took the wrong seed at the beginning now she's going to have pain bringing the natural seed and second now she got long for Adam because she longed for the serpent that's what God said it's going to be for your husband now you got to long for your husband right now church if this don't put the nail on the thing I don't know what does Amen I'm still waiting for somebody to challenge me on these they don't do it he's just bring up well this don't make sense and this says this and this says that well you never they never address the literal points I'm making number seven the serpent was humanlike before the fall could talk it was standing upright those are the two Clues right could carry conversations and then God said he's got a seed he's got Offspring he must have been close to human enough where he had Offspring uh number eight Cain was the Serpent's son and not Adams the Bible never calls Cain the Father the Son rather of Adam he's called the son of the wicked one in 1 John 3:12 that's thus sayith the word and evidence last one the Sea of the woman was a literal man Jesus this one brother brand brings up and so the seed of the serpent must be a literal man king that's awesome that's awesome thought brother BR brought out there okay so back to this here back to the 1958 sermon now I just want to lay this one in here brother Bram talks about men wanting to be women in this sermon like the trans movement and this was uh 66 years ago he foresaw this he said when you see a man that's a little manicuring his fingernails he says four on one side five on the other colored and slicking his hair down to hold his mouth open in front and such stuff of that these pretty boys you remember sis there's something wrong with that bird he says you better keep an eye on him right look what we see today when you see woman with a cigarette in the side of her mouth and a pair of overalls on saying I'll tell you fell what it is brother you watch out that old gal he says there's something wrong with her he said a man is becoming more cissified every day women's becoming more masculine what's the matter we're going to find out in a few minutes by the Bible women ain't women no more I don't mean you Christian women Hallelujah he said I'm talking about the general run they want to act like men want to cut their hair like men put their hand up on a bar like that and sing God Bless America with a cigarette out of the corner of their mouth it's a disgrace he said and he goes back to the beginning he said Adam and Eve were in one Spirit at the beginning but God separated the feminine part out of Adam right he said so they should be totally separate hallelujah praise God I'm glad we got some Burly men in this church amen you think I'm Burly I know brother Bley Williams but we got some real feminine sisters in the church amen hallelujah so even 66 six years ago brother R was calling this out and look what we got today and he then course it goes back to cutting hair uh crossdressing Abomination remember it's a disgusting thing to to crossdress that's why it's sad these sisters wear uh pajama pants to bed that's disgusting in the sight of God it'd be like if I wore a skirt to bed it's disgusting and it's just the one open door to letting all this other sin in I wonder why people are leaving the message it ain't necessarily because of believe the sign or somebody else it's because they start with those small things a little leaven will leaven the whole lump let them crossdress or watch the wrong things or listen to the wrong things well you don't take care of that well yeah it'll open the door later to something like believe the sign or these other people that left the message but it starts with something small they let down the bars right and I imagine I'll get an email about this but God bless all the emailers Hallelujah he said but what do you see where the seed of the serpent what was the seed of the serpent he said it's adultery you following adultery with Eve okay so that's what brought about the serpent seed was an act of adultery right so brother lays it out plainly in here now here's where brother BR brings it down this is why brother BR brought up the illegitimate scripture in the beginning now this is going to be kind of hard to hear but just just bear with me I hope I don't get an email about this uh he said now he's talking about the Roman Catholic church and all the Protestants that are lost everybody say lost that's why the people that they email me you missed it I'm not talking about save people in denomination I'm talking about the lost the majority of them are lost Jesus said few there be that find it he said come out of her my people that you be not partakers the longer they stay in there the more danger there is in partaking of their acts their sinful acts so listen to this brother mam said it's got to place a big religious bunch of illegitimate bastard children he's talking about the spiritual right are denominational people uh or Catholic or whatever that are sinners are they born again no so what what happened they're illegitimate born they don't have a real birth I'm talking about by the Holy Ghost they're alive they got some type of life but they're not legitimate children of God they say they the children of God but their Works deny the word of God Amen that's why this sermon is so powerful because he's looking at he's looking at now look at the spiritual seat of people's lives and brother R says if you say Amen to every word of God that proves you're a child of God Amen that proves you've got the seat of God hallelujah ah amen hallelujah he said there's my final remark you want to know brother ad's final remarks and the serpent seed that's his final remarks he shows the spiritual churches that are the serpent seed churches are illegitimate children to God they're not God's children because you don't become God's children by joining a church you become God's children by getting the holy ghost or potentially if you're a foolish virgin potentially you will get you'll get you'll get a brand new body you'll get a Holy Ghost spirit body right you'll get a theophany eventually but that's all you inherit you don't have any reward he said that's exactly what it come to you know that to be the truth it's come to a place where it's Church joined and church members having a form of godliness but denying the power thereof till it's come to a bunch of religious bastard children that's exactly what it is so this ain't no this is pulling no punches what's next brother Bram says the atomic bombs right so he's talking about the bombing of the United States the seventh major Vision probably happens well no doubt it happens in the Great Tribulation period no doubt we don't know where you know there's a couple uh there's a couple scriptures you know I asked that to cam and Simon we had that last Minister's meeting back there in April I said Brothers I've always wondered where is that and they took me to uh Hebrews 12 let's go there because I kind of be something new here I said well that might be it Brothers I really like that idea um Hebrews 12 it's at the end of the chapter I'm got to look for the verse okay 26 whose voice then shook the Earth but now he hath promised saying yet once more I shake not the Earth only only but also heaven and this word yet once more signify the removing of those things that are shaken now think about the Los Angeles earthquake right a shaking as of things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken May remain Hallelujah wherefor Church we've received a kingdom which what cannot be moved Hallelujah no matter what happens to this earth no matter what happens with atomic fire our kingdom cannot be moved because our kingdom isn't the United States our kingdom is the kingdom of God amen glory let us have what Grace whereby we may serve God acceptably with reverence and godly fear talk I mean if you were going to summarize how to live a Christian Life what would you say the Hebrew writer Paul says serve god with reverence and godly fear right there's lots of ways to summarize it right um the two greatest commands love the Lord your God love your neighbor as yourself right there's what's the conclusion of the whole matter Ecclesiastes 12 fear God keep his commands right there's different ways to summarize the word of God and how how should I live my life how should I live as a Christian how about serve god with reverence and godly fear because God is going to shake everything on this Earth it's all going to be shaken but our kingdom can never be shaken Hallelujah it can never be moved amen because it's God's Eternal Kingdom Hallelujah so that's the scripture Cam and Simon thought I thought well hey that's pretty good scripture I don't have any other scripture you know I've always you know we got how many believe we got to take everything back to the word of God if brother had seven major Visions well surely we can find them in the Bible That's what I'm saying right we can see you know uh we can see the persecution of the Jews with Hitler melini we can see that in the fifth seal there it is hallelujah like I told you uh that Vision brother Bram saw of the American Church dancing rock and roll that was in the scripture that's happened in Moses day remember I made that video on that cam Cam said that's real spiritual brother I said well that was the Holy Ghost that wasn't me anything that good comes out of my life it wasn't me God just showed me that just by just waiting on the Lord just studying brother said what's left he said atomic bomb everything else he says and Friends whatever you do if you're a Christian and you've got God in your heart how many got God in their heart today and you know that you pass from death and life how many pass from death and life you ought to be the happiest person in all the world he says amen hallelujah you mean I love Jesus and he loves me Hallelujah you got to be the happiest person cuz you're not a illegitimate child you're a genuine child of God you're born of God hallelujah your life speaks that I'm a Christian when the Holy Spirit in you and the Bible says Jesus Christ is same yesterday today and forever denomination say h but we believe the Miracles have passed the holy spirit says amen Jesus is the same yesterday today and forever so be it Hallelujah praise the Lord if the Bible said repent be baptized every one of you in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins and you shall receive the Holy Ghost the promises for you and your children to the Gentiles all that's a far off even as many as our Lord Our God shall call he says and when that strikes you you say what what do you say yes you do good church you knew you knew you knew that quote didn't you the church said oh it don't make any difference how you're baptized that was so good Simon brought that out that prostitute speaks so smoothly oh God knows my heart oh I'm saved by grace it don't matter what I'm doing oh it's so smooth but it's such a lie if they know better I'm talking about if they know better if they don't know better that's something different Church all you got to do is look at their lives are they living a verion life to the word or not are they mixed up in idolatry that fornication right spiritual fornication are they fornicating are they loving the things of the world or not that's all you got to see then you know what their confession is then you know where where they where the at least the way the trees leaning brother where the trees leaning usually Falls right unless there's some type of a uh deathbed confession which we know the thief on the cross right and we just talked about one hopefully that happened last week by God's grace the church says oh it don't make any difference but the holy spirit in you says Amen to the word of God he said man shall not live by bread alone but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God how am I doing my time there you are he said I want you to show me one scripture I love this show me one scripture where it ever said an Apple started the the thing to going on now where does the bible saying Apple started the original sin doesn't say that it does say the bride the shulamite is the was the apple of Solomon's eye though it does say that you want to find an Apple I'll show you an apple hallelujah it's that pure bride she's the apple of the husband's eye that's the Apple in the Bible right there hallelujah amen he said I want you to show me where Adam and Eve ate apples I'll show you where Cain brought the same thing where his seed still thinks the same thing he says but the spiritual Revelation from God proves that it was a intercourse between man and woman illegally that's where your Giants come from that's another powerful statement that natural seed line of the serpent mixed with the human seed the genetic all the genetic uh possibilities in there eventually produce Giants right we showed it to you even up to the days of David right uh yeah I think those were the last recorded ones in the scripture in David's day still had Giants that was what a thousand years before Christ so the first uh 4,000 years the first 4,000 years of human history there was Giants because of this seed line brought in I now he says where does that seed of serpent stand today in these smart intellectual places the smart shrewd Scholars that's where he is that's where he lays did you know when I I don't know if I told the story before when I first came in the message I was battling some uh uh Seminary preachers and I said uh God's one person they said God's three persons I said okay well show me your scriptures on that you know what he did I bought the book he took me to a seminary textbook and he copied the chapter about the Trinity and then he gave me that copy you know what the last statement is in that chapter let's see if I can remember verb try to understand the three persons you'll lose your mind deny the three persons you'll lose your soul anybody catch you what's he trying to do he's trying to put a spirit of fear on me don't go against the grain you know believe the sign just call me a well not just but believe the sign called me a heretic because I don't believe in the Trinity excuse me Jesus never called God three persons huh Paul never said God three persons and where does Satan lay at he lays in those seminaries with these smart shrewd people oh it's okay if we add to the word of God the doctors of dein said so here take take my chapter God's three persons if you don't believe it you're going to hell my my good friend and yet we say they can be saved but if we deny their Trinity we're lost amen who's did you find that Mercy verse by chance okay P it up there I just came to me right now we see we love Mercy we don't want to see these people lost we want to see them saved Hallelujah we want to see them confess their man-made dogmas and Tre and Creeds Hallelujah Jesus said you transgress the word of God by your tradition and the Bible said Jesus said you do it in vain think about that church most Services they go to church and God doesn't accept anything nothing how many believe God accepted your dancing here on Saturday night I believe God accepted mine how do I know because I'm trying to live by every word of God I try to bring the right sacrifice I brought and and what's My Sacrifice is it my good deeds sisters no it's the sacrifice of Jesus Christ amen alls I brought sister Caris was Faith In My Sacrifice that's all I got I have nothing else than that sister Victoria that's all I got all I got is my genuine faith in the blood of Jesus Christ I'm trusting in Him and not myself and therefore if he's the word if my sacrifice is the word I'm only going to believe the word I'm not going to add to the word and then that that way God accepts My Sacrifice hallelujah amen and it's not in vain he has showed thee oh man what is good and what does the Lord require of our church what's he require of you Lydia but to do justly he just wants you to be fair do what's right and to love mercy and to walk humbly with thy God well yeah brother Jesse I love you here here's a trinity doc do uh Trinity document if you don't believe it you're going to hell well thank you I really appreciate your love for me and I'll say God bless you and they won't even say God bless you to me it won't even say that how do I know because I've talked to some of these pastors since I I came out I just saw one sore last year I said God bless you he didn't say God bless you back Hallelujah where's that serpent seed stand smart shrewd places but brother man says not by might not by power but by my spirit sayith the Lord hallelujah and what brother said what's the spirit going to do it's going to direct you to the word hallelujah ah I'm excited now Hallelujah and brother Ram says see no man can come to Jesus except my father draws him and all that comes to me I'll raise up in the last day course she's quoting scripture from John there's nothing going to be lost I got it he said I'll keep it no man can do it except this who's going to keep you saved Jesus and then brother R says this all of it lays in him your salvation the Rapture it all Lays in him now this is all from the serpent seed sermon now you can't say I done one thing who's going to brag when they get to heaven say look what I did for salvation I'm talking about for salvation now now for for rewards you're not going to brag but you're going to say like that like that uh notebook right here's what I did Lord here's what I did with the money you gave me in other words here's your money back it ain't your money you playing the piano it's not your ability it's not you it's God in you yeah amen buddy you play like that that's not you that's God in you God gave you that ability to hear that Lydia God give you that you're just going to say Lord well here's the money that you gave me and I I invested in it I got it back by God's gra I got double back Hallelujah I had a good return because God was gracious to me he said you're not going to go up and say I've done one thing it's the grace of God that done it all see nothing I done for salvation I never had a thing to do you never need either you never merited one thing for salvation God did every bit of it you never turn your finger for one part of it you didn't say well I come out I I come out of a good family I did this that don't have one thing to do with it God is the one who did it God's mercy Hallelujah let me see how many quotes I got left here a lot why can't I just preach one sermon on this okay I'll go kind of quick here and I can just pick up with the perfect Faith next week brother B tells us in this sermon he saidthe serpent seed came through the Ark of Noah and he especially points out ham remember ham Shem and japheth brother raham said look at Ham's life he was cursed he was probably uh the seed of the serpent but then remember he says they all intermarried so ham must have been maybe the last one that had this natural thing but shortly after that it switched over to it's all spiritual now it does doesn't matter which family you're born in the the natural seed line doesn't matter it's you must be born of the spiritual seed put up 1 Timothy 1 I'm sorry 1 Peter 123 and I'm going to keep reading he said the SE the seed came over in the ark just like it did in the beginning through the woman their wives they carry the seed of Satan through the ark just as e packed the seed of Satan to giving birth to Cain through the woman so brother ad says here now there's ham and Seth or he he means uh he doesn't mean Seth oh there's another one I could show with another human mistake I could show that to Brown Tabernacle there's ham and uh japheth and Shem in the same Ark so look there's there's a seed of God and serpent seed in the ark brother said there was a crow and a dove in the same Ark then brother R says there's Jesus and Judas es scar in the same church thank God we got uh real Believers here by God's grace amen so he says how they're so close together yes being born again not of the not of the corruptible seed so your your seed human seed doesn't matter he said what matters is The Incorruptible seed the word of God which liveth and abideth forever amen aren't you glad You' got a spiritual genetics that will live forever as brother Brooks reminded us you were in the mind of God before the foundation of the world that's your spiritual Gene that Gene can never end that Gene can never die you're going to live eternally praise God cuz you got a part of God's Offspring You're a part of God's Offspring You're a part of God's family Hallelujah I hope somebody leaves here happy tonight by God's grace brother said God took the Serpent's legs off when he cursed him that's just familiar just thought I'd bring that one out I like that quote brother man said let's draw a picture of this great big fella he called The Serpent of great big fella he's between a chimpanzee and a man and the serpent the devil Lucifer they knew that the only blood that could mix with the human blood would have been this serpent couldn't couldn't have been a chimpanzee the blood wouldn't mix couldn't have couldn't have been the Sheep couldn't have been a horse couldn't deal with any other animal had to be this serpent this Beast the Bible calls him a beast he said he was a great big fellow prehistoric giant he says now of course not prehistoric well maybe prehistoric to humans keeping track of History um he's a big fell he said maybe he was 10 feet tall that's about how tall uh Goliath was great big shoulders look just like a man and so he uh he says you see how many knows that science can't find the missing link he says there he is he's the serpent he's this great big fellow okay so brother lays that in there describing the serpent now getting I'm just going to finish with a few few more highlight quotes brother Ram said quote brother if there's one thing that I have to do to be saved Jesus Christ died in vain Grace I am saved not by myself but by the will of God by the goodness of God end quote Hallelujah prise God if I have to do one thing to be saved then Jesus died in vain then he needs me Hallelujah he don't need me I need him Hallelujah so I love how brother lays in these good reminders I see these people that say brother BR preach Works based salvation they just don't listen to the tapes I'm not going to go off on them today now brother tells a story he now he ends a sermon also by showing how Satan uses wh like in the days of Noah of course these days as it was in days of lot days of Sodom brother Bram said there was a sister Edith right remember she's the one that spoke uh her children's salvation the holy spirit said say whatever you want and it'll be yours remember that that was uh operation of the third pole brother manam says sister right back there she remembers there's a woman that came he says they used to wear cut their dresses down like this I don't know which way I don't know if he's going like this or if he's like they cut their dresses down like this I don't know he said they just cut their dresses down like that that funny looking stuff about half of their body exposed and he said remember Sister Wright remember I said if they ever come in my church I'll sure put them out he said sure enough a little old snickle Fritz come down here he said a Catholic girl sat down with it like that I looked back and I spied her sitting up here they was singing I took off my coat now look picture brother Bram on the pulpit he sees a girl there I don't know if it's like this or the other side but he says she has all her shoulders exposed now what would I do if that happened to me that's what I when I read these quotes that's what I think what would I do thank God it hasn't happened to me he said he said they were all sitting they were all singing so during the song service brother leaves the pulpit I took off my coat walked back there I put it around her shoulders I said Madam if you're going to listen to me preach would you please wear this coat while you're in the Church of God and cover your shoulders put it around your shoulders sure enough she stomped out of there and spread them little lips she went out of the building she said now think about this right during the song service if he is got religion I wouldn't let my cow have that kind of religion and brother B said don't worry she won't have it brother Bram said she died a few years after that and he was she was calling for brother Ram to come pray for her and he said she was trying to repent at the end of her life brother R doesn't know if she got saved or not but brother R couldn't get there to pray for her think about that so talk about having Church manners Hallelujah I just thought it was something this is the story this is the message he tells that in and then he goes through these serpent seed preachers uh and he he lists a bunch of things here he said if that man tells you pouring for your baptism is right he said he's told you a lie if he tells you sprinklings is is all right he's told you a lie he said if he tells you the name of the father and the Holy Ghost is all right he's told you a lie if he tells you the day of Miracles is passed he's told you a lie if he tells you it's all right for women to preach he's told you a lot and I know you've heard this before stay with me he said if it if he if he tells you it's all right for you to go ahead and stick to your denominations he's told you a lie it won't flash on the urum Thum of God's word he said there's dozens of things that come out in that old mother Harlot that come down here to the Protestants and there's where we stay away from those denominations he says we love our Brethren and sisters out there in denominations but you don't go and saying I'm a Methodist and make you a Christian you're a Christian because you're born of the spirit of God he said you don't have to be a Methodist or Baptist and I say this you don't have to be a message believer you've got to be born by the spirit of God hallelujah right because a message can mean anything anything can return Ministry push play and Obey it can mean anything so that's why it's got to be if I'm a Christian I'm born of the Holy Ghost Hallelujah and any man that tells you you got to play tapes and not preach that man's told you a lie let me bring it down to home Hallelujah they told you a lie because you don't find that in the Bible now I'm almost done I got 19 seconds on my hour now look what brother says in paragraph 306 quote and you Tabernacle here I told you we're going to change the name of this it's not right for it to be brandom Tabernacle that's just a man see we're going to change the name of it make it some other name we'll get to that after a while I just wanted to be a Church of the Living God end quote so if I could email that brother again I'd say brother your Prophet said it's not right for it to be called brandom Tabernacle and we're going to do it if every word is th thus say the Lord why isn't it done yet wonder what they'd say I I love quotes like this I call these little nuggets hiding in there aren't they little golden nuggets in there it's not right but see brother Ram wanted to change it but who wouldn't change it the trustees trustees the people that owned it right the who are the leaders of our church Bang myself brother amen we're the trustees that's how you change it he said it should just be the Church of the Living God no they want to keep a man's name on it that's why they're in man-made Creeds right now amen just struck me right there that's why it's a man-made Creeds he says it again uh next week he said now one week later he said I wish it wasn't brandom Tabernacle what do you think of that uh brandom Tabernacle today I wish it was just called The Tabernacle didn't have my name attached to it I'm fixing to turn this church dot dot dot he never finished that you all know when we bought it I bought it while I worked for the Public Service Company I don't think my name ought to be on that church it ought to be a brandom tabernacle should just be a church the church of the Lord Jesus Christ or something like that the Tabernacle of the lord The Dwelling Place the House of Prayer or something other give it some kind of a name let the congregation choose their name name my name I'm just a man my name don't deserve to be on this and the church said anybody ever read these quotes to the Bram Tabernacle today they ever listen to this sermon he said it's not right glory amen it ain't right don't put a man's name on it like they say uh Benny Hinn Ministries right Kenneth copen Ministries they put their own name on it the Bible say you got a name that you live but you're dead I'm not going to say all those people are dead in brandom Tabernacle but they sure got 24 false doctrines and I just can't see how they could have the Holy Ghost and idolize tapes and idolize a man oh then he says it again yeah we're gonna yeah we're gonna it's not right yeah okay I read that and then okay now let's s on our feet musicians can come I'm reading one more quote we're done by God's grace how many enjoyed the word of God tonight I thought I felt some inspiration to preach these so we can sing that song and yes we're going to sing uh just want to thank you Lord for letting me hear your word so the sermon ends with brother Ram saying we have a baptismal service tonight and guess who it was Rosella Griffin's mother Rosella Griffin was one of brother Ram's most uh well-known converts because Alcoholics Anonymous gave her up she couldn't you know she she stayed free from uh liquor for like six months but she was she was still had the shakes and we read the testimony in our book we got a book on it the generations she said she met somebody on a bus and they said have you been to see brother brandom she's like no uh he's like she's a he's a prophet of God you need to go see him and she said she prayed and she said I she knew just like the woman with the blood issue she said if I can get brother brother R's prayer line I'll be healed and that's exactly what happened and the awesome thing was the next night she went and told a friend who had the same alcoholic problem she said if you come and he brother Braham you'll get healed too the same thing happened she got in the prayer line and then it happened a third night third time three nights in a row amen hallelujah amen and here's a woman she was 100 pounds she was hopeless there's no way I can ever get this desire for alcohol amen but one minute in the presence of God one minute in the presence of Jesus Christ the angel of God the Holy Ghost he whom the son has set free is free indeed hallelujah amen and Saints she spent the rest of her life going to people to is testifying and she said I won many souls to the Lord a woman giving her testimony in other words churches would just say hey we're going to have a testimony tonight we're going to let sister Rosella stand over here not the pulpit because sisters don't want a complex right neither do preachers want a complex but we're just going to listen to our sister give her testimony now she give her testimony I overcame tobacco I'm sorry overcome that's what I overcame I overcame alcohol now who wants to give their heart to the Lord hundreds of people got saved through a woman's testimony so Saints don't don't ever think your testimony doesn't mean something it means something I told Brother bang maybe on May 12th when I get back here on that PM service we'll record his testimony for the next podcast because you never know who it's going to help by God's grace sister Z might have to do yours too by God's grace I just thought about that I gotta do Jose too and who else I gotta maybe some of these young Saints by God's grace last quote Rosella is that your mother Rosella says yes why bless your heart glad to see you sister doing doing that that's very fine Rosella Griffin one of the finest little friends that we've ever had she's a young woman that was an alcoholic to some of you people here might be a stranger Rosella don't care for me saying that when she come on the platform up there in Indiana you never seen a wret she was one of them a waly alcoholic I don't know what walyed means but maybe just crazy four great doctors in Chicago the Alcoholics Anonymous and everything else give her up but one night she came in the meeting the Holy Ghost unraveled her life and told her right there that settled it look at her now I guess 30 something years old would pass for 18 that's quite a compliment I got to learn to do that for the sisters from now on oh you're 40 you like you look like you're 15 oh you're 60 you're look like you just passed 30 that's good Pulpit manners right there you'd pass for 18 lovely beautiful young woman never tasted whiskey since no more desire for it living for Christ going around the street everywhere testifying to the glory of God to Sinners and alcoholics all through skid RADS and everything else she even went to prisons church talk about a woman talk about a saint she would go into prisons give her testimony and people get saved in the prison women now she was baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus and her mother comes tonight to do likewise if a God could heal her if Jesus could heal her whatsoever you do in word or deed do it all in the name of Jesus Christ that's what the Bible taught that's right and the church said let's thank God for the word of God tonight hallelujah amen recognizing your day and serpent seed hallelujah amen it's not right to put that brandom name on that church it's not right I'm I'm quoting the prophet Hallelujah let's bow our heads for word to prayer tonight you know Saints there's there's sermons like this it's kind of just to give us a good warning right nobody in here is right no one's here saying oh the days and miracles has passed brother Jesse nobody's saying that nobody's saying well why don't we write a Creed book brother Jess why don't we just why don't we uh let the men grow out their hair women cut their nobody's saying that tonight but but listen what the holy spirit's saying the holy spirit is saying You must be born again we must be ready for the Rapture praise God all of our fusses stews bad habits arguments fights all of it can be confessed and put under the blood of Jesus Christ Hallelujah that's what we've heard tonight the Lord willing next time we'll look at perfect Faith praise God church if you have an unspoken need for the Lord just make it known by the raising of your hands I don't know what's on your heart but let's just let's just pray one more
