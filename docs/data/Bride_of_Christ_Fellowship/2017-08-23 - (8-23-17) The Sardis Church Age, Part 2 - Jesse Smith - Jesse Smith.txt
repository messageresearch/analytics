felt let do though I'm sunny on water baptism for Haven and baptism pretty similar so I had this message ready let's get back to work I didn't have a whole lot of time to prepare this week so I already have this sermon prepared so I think I'll just preach this tonight not the grace of God let's look at verses 1 into Russian 3 verses 1 & 2 that's a good this thought here tonight and I believe it'll be a blessing tonight to us by God's grace revelation 3 verse 1 and unto the Angel of the church in Sardis write these things saith he that had the seven spirits of God and the Seven Stars I know thy works that thou hast a name that thou livest art dead be watchful and strengthen the things which remain that are ready to die for I have not found thy works perfect before God how many that's an inspired scripture right there we'll get as far as we can here tonight like I said we're not quite sure how far we'll get but let's just bow our heads in word of Prayer I'm gonna try to short my message to my throat really hurts but I know God's more than able a men to help me out so I need God's help Heavenly Father we love you Lord is such a privilege to pray Lord tonight and sing these songs and to bring these many needs before you see his grandmother and and Beau's father Lord in this this family Lord a pender guys family that lost this loved one and and Lord and all the other needs Lord there was other ones I forgot about Lord Christopher was in the hospital Lord I forgot about that be with him Lord Jesus I pray God to show yourself in the power of your resurrection Lord guide that family Lord God with his health Lord and father we just thank you Lord for the privilege of being a king and a priest thank you for eternal life Lord we can see the effects of eternal life taking control in our lives and that gives us fullness of joy Lord God where we used to live for things of death now we live for things of eternal life Lord God what a privilege tonight Lord God to see the effect of the crown or we'd say the white robe of eternal life in our lives right now Lord what a privilege what an honor Lord bless this reading and I were these are red-letter words Lord Jesus you're the one who spoke them your prophet said this is the only full book of the Bible that you yourself wrote Lord so we thank you lord help us to catch the inspiration Lord of your prophet for this book Lord and any other inspiration the Holy Ghost would give us the Lord here tonight speak to us here have any father and protect my voice give me a strong voice Lord and help me for tomorrow work and so forth should you tarry we love you Lord Jesus thank you for your blood it's through your blood that we come into your presence right now now by our works or our by our salvation but through your rich grace and mercy through your sacrifice of yourself sending your son to die for us thank you for that bloody lamb that's in heaven lower now that appears in the presence of God for us Lord seeing that you ever live to make intercession for our prayers and our needs tonight teach us thy word Lord is so important for us in this hour in Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen god bless you be in see them praise the Lord just that I murders I don't go to long and look forward to this messy Chuck I said I'll I was ready to preach this on Sunday night I was already really excited to preach it by this side save it so cuz I forgot we didn't take Haven through the bible scriptures we just talked about it a lot and prayed about it a lot so and then i talked to someone a saint afterwards i said i hope it wasn't too bad to go over this message and they're like no you can never outgrow the scriptures you can never get too mature to hear a word on water baptism i thought well that's your heart what a good statement i said that's one of the sweetest things I've heard amen in a while so thank God for that but or Malachi can you switch you over please sir let's do some some quotes here tonight by God's grace and also I got a this is kind of encouraging I got a text from somebody looks like I don't know if it's America or not but they heard me preach on doing some missionary work door-to-door and they want to send us an offering so we'll see if that that comes through so I was praying about that actually this week before I got this email because we've been trying it we helped out Simon and Simon got another ticket to go to Thailand they changed the plans he's going in October so our church supporting him to go to Thailand this time so we're very thankful but I felt led to do that rather than do the door-to-door but if we get this in here my thought was I was praying just this week and I said Lord if we can get more missionary funds on a Sunday night at 4 p.m. I like to do those Bible mystery sermons and invite people to come on a Sunday night because we're already here and that's where I kind of how I'm feeling LED right now but if this testimony does come through and they want to support that they think that'd be wonderful so I'm looking forward to see what God does and because I've had this desire for many months and I'm looking to see if this is the will of the Lord here so I just thought it was great I was praying about missionary work here in Akron and then I got this email so hopefully it hopefully it's God working on both ends I'd like to see that okay so we read our text I we just read verse 2 sorry I thought we read verse 3 but we did it now I just want to remind us God thought so much of the church ages series that he sent the pillar of fire for a visitation remember that is that three hours and five minutes in the sermon revelation chapter 4 part 3 remember we listened to this brother Graham said look this away now you that's just like it when it comes under glory here see it slide over here you're moving here look it's just a reflection just a reflection it's not the light here's the light hanging right here see here at this woman I just happened to catch it I thought it was over somebody now you're seeing one but I'm seeing two brother madam said one of them is natural the other one is supernatural so the pillar of fire was over a woman at this point but later he said the part that wasn't on tape was when the pillar of fire was on the wall I don't remember which wall it was maybe the back wall don't remember but the pillar of fire actually made the light of each of those moons or circles right and then it went hung over a sister he said but you're seeing the natural light of that supernatural light which is quite as quite a thing to think about the supernatural pillar fire made a natural light so I just want you to remember that and then a week after he preached this nine days later he preached this is that we've had a revival to Tabernacle I had a series of subjects I was telling you the seven churches my congregation was 400 or 350 says while I speak in I called the prayer line there should kind of glory he said I'm gonna skip down there and as I speak in the angel Lord came right down before them all went right over and stood in the corner there 300 or more people looked at it for 15 minutes screaming crying and praising and they caught the end of it on that tape that we listened to the first time had ever come like that before our church just come right in everybody begins screaming and fallen as a big amber light the pillar fire just as perfectly and it began to shade itself and shade it every one of those church ages just exactly the way I taught them in that pillar of fire and God knows that's the truth here before this Bible so the pillar of fire did a light that looked almost like a full circle right and then it got and that changed shape and made all those shapes until may Laodicea so we don't want to forget the importance of these services especially the teaching on these because that's what God would have us to know about the book of Revelation so it's so crucial and I want to bring this one too from the seven seals he said we ought to live above shorthair and all this and this age now where we're back into something now that God's revealing the hidden mysteries that have been put on the book before the foundation of world and those who have obeyed in these small things will catch it in these other things if you have it it'll go over the top of your head just as far as the East is from the west see if we can't do this small little things I like the little sanctification things the Prophet said you'll miss it on the big things the rapture the revelation the mysteries of God we got obey every word of God right like getting he said and then he said this is a different message we're talking about the little things Oh the very least little thing we do our King sees the littlest thing we do and he knows the very things and thoughts that's in our hearts whatever we do what little is and how do we serve Him as we serve each other if I don't love you how can I love him see in so much have you done it unto one at least of these you've done unto me see it's the little things that we have undone sometimes I just want to bring that out is we got to remember the little things about serving God all the little details he says sometimes it breaks the whole chain you see and lets us go free just the nomination of minded forget about these little things that are really the essential things every word of God is essential none of it can be let out we've got to take every word of it just the way it was wrote Amen just want to encourage us with that remember and these little things that might seem little to us you know maybe water baptism or any little thing like he gave an example of cutting hair and then in other words he gave above that he gave an example of smoking and little worldly things if we can't get rid of these little things we're gonna miss the big things so we need to keep all the Word of God amen now just a quick review I promise I'm gonna go fast through here just a quick review the Sardis Church age was the Reformation age and they had they had their own name so in other words they were taking many of them took denominational names okay so the light is very thin but it was bigger than the previous Thyatira church age and we're dealing with 15 22 17 AD so that time period here and Martin Luther was the church age messenger I'll skip to that skip past this we're going to go real quick so we're speaking on this age right here and the battle for their age is living a name but they're dead that's the battle and they're battling the black horse rider remember he had this bounces in his hand and he was capturing the wealth of the world so this is when the Catholic Church had state power and they controlled all the the necessities like food and barley right and water and everything like that they control everything but the temptation the age was they were living a denomination name but were dead the city of Sardis remember the fifth City sorry the fifth City there and in modern-day Turkey and member the highlight to this part of the city was the goddess their goddess Inn was Seibel and Sai Bo was the same false god that the the priests of Jezebel worshiped which was pretty striking remember that from the city of Sardis that was a striking part of that city Sardis the very goddess they worship the mother Sun goddess was the same mother Sun goddess that Jezebel's priests worship where it's really striking and this is the age okay the age of Sardis again Martin Luther was born before the Age started but then lived in the beginning of it that was his life and then there's John Wesley's life and there's brother branham's life Martin Luther was the best known messenger of all ages and it was written of him that he had all nine gifts of the Holy Spirit amen what a man of God and truly if the Lutheran's live what Martin Luther preached brother Branham said they'd be a credit and praise to the kingdom of God as foolish virgins if they just lived the justification facts that he preached they'd be a great credit to the kingdom of God huh me know the foolish virgins a good credit to the kingdom of God they are they are therefore known before the foundation world and they do get some people saved through the foolish virgin now here's the new stuff here's let's get into this now I told you that be sure it's the salutation we're finishing verse one these things saith he they have the seven spirits of God in the seven stars now visually in heaven the seven spirits appear as lamps before the throne of God so before God's throne or gods seat there's seven lamps or seven fires and those are actually the seven spirits of God because that's what the scripture says in Revelation four or five the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne which are the seven spirits of God now the Prophet teaches this what are these seven lamps were these seven spirits the Prophet says we know that these are not teaching a new doctrine a that's contrary to John 4:24 God is one spear he said it's not teaching contra that but this is like first Corinthians 12 8 through 11 where do we find one Spirit manifesting in nine ways thus we know that the seven spirits of God meaning is the one in South Asia spirit coming forth in a Sevenfold way and that beautiful God's pillar of fire comes down as one pillar fire to earth right like we said I saw Jeffersonville but in heaven God's one spirit has seven fire burning manifestations because it represents how God is going to work through the current or the past seven Church ages amen because God has completed and I'm sorry perfected I'm sorry I completed in seven he's completed in seven forgive me now revelation four and five these same spirits are called lamps of fire burning before the Lord since John always used nothing but Old Testament symbols in Revelation we go to the Old Testament in proverbs 20 verse 27 said the spirit of the man is the lamp of the Lord so now we go a step further not only are there seven lamps but now these lamps represent spirits of men these seven spirits are found to be associated with man John the Baptist was called a burning light which would also could be translated as a burning lamp again in Revelation 5:6 the seven spirits are identified as seven eyes so now we're given another symbol for the same symbol for the same idea seven spirits could be seven spirits of men and also seven sets of eyes or seven eyes Zechariah 4:10 says for who hath despised the day of small things for they shall rejoice and shall see the plummet the hand of zerubu with those seven they are the eyes of the Lord the promise that is evident that the word they refers to men thus we see the eyes of the Lord in this instance are men of course they will be anointed men for the Holy Ghost for God's ministries are in the power are not in the power of men but in the power of the Holy Ghost amen so that's of those seven lamps represent who represent the Holy Spirit in each church messenger for all seven Church ages so brother said putting our scriptural discoveries together it is evident that the seven spirits of God refer to the continuous ministry of the same Holy Spirit in the lives of seven men with whom God identifies himself very closely amen they are his eyes and they are his lamps those I'm sorry who these seven men are can be easily seen because the next phrase calls them seven stars which are already known to us as the seven messengers to the church okay so seven spirits represent the Holy Spirit anointed lives of seven men amen pretty familiar but I didn't know if you'd been familiar on that lately so we see that the seven spirits actually refer to the one Spirit of God working out the will and word of God in different ages I would like to illustrate that from the word so whether I'm gives us another illustration for this you have the nine gifts of the Spirit and then also another revelation is the five comings of Elijah it's the same thing it's five manifestations of the one spirit right of Allah hi John but this the seven lamps are seven manifestations of the one spirit of God also Jesus and the New Testament church brother Branham says is a type of this the same spear that was on Jesus now comes upon the church same spirit but now it's manifesting in different lives amen the lives of the Apostles and now our lives amen so I'll skip that because it talks about that the holy spirit that was in Jesus came down the day of Pentecost that's kind of familiar I'll skip that but I want to get to this any people that's truly the body of Christ Jesus the true church will manifest the same works as Jesus did and the Pentecostal church because the same spirit will be in them any other church that does not have the spirit and the manifestations is going to have to give an account to who God that's why there's times that I've I felt led and I hope you'll remember it understands this I felt led sometimes to preach hard that we need to see manifestation the church now it might be understood by some but anybody who really studies deep in the word knows that if a church doesn't have the Holy Ghost in power they're gonna answer to God for that so that's why I know it's not me being rough on the church or something like that it's me being anointed by the Holy Spirit saying if you know if we don't have this we're not the true Church of God in other words we can't be a powerless Church we've to be a powerful Church because God hates powerless religion I know I know before I've been a misunderstood times like that where I've tried this press like we need gifts or we need God's power I know I've been understood and I feel bad about that but when I study this and it comes down to it it's the Spirit of God saying God hates powerless religion like brother Samson was here and he preached the power of God God hates a powerless religion and if a church says they're the message church or a true Church of the hour and doesn't have it they're gonna answer to God as what they had a false claim they said oh we and where are they gonna answer for that at the white throne judgment though they'll not live in the millennium right they'll not sit on the throne with Christ and no answer for at the white throne judgment Church it's a burden it's a necessary burden that we have the signs wonders and miracles Amen we're glad to see them from time to time hallelujah that's exactly right in the message if you listen to desperation that listen that recently I think a few weeks ago brother Branham said there's times that we need to be desperate for miracles well Adam said if we see miracles working on other people he said we should get desperate to see them in our lives because what does it mean if we're desperate for God that means we're less interested in the world and we're not we're not sliding away from God or backsliding but we're drawn closer to him that's all that means it's not a works based salvation but it's just getting away from our worldly tendencies and drawn closer to God it's so misunderstood though especially you know like I said sometimes it's understood when I preach it or other brothers might emphasize the power of God we're not trying to say put on try to do it work but it's get serious with God and flex your faith muscles they men put your faith to work like we saw on Sunday wake up Jesus out of the boat wake that faith up in your life amen speak the word pray for the sick fast and pray do something try to get the supernatural anointing that's all it's saying is if we don't have it we're gonna we're gonna wind up at the foolish version right at the white throne judgment but we want to sit on the throne so see that's why we preach it the way we do it is that help by God's grace I hope that's understood it's never meant to try to press too hard on supernatural but if people don't have it in their lives they gotta answer for God because the Bible said these follow all these signs follow all believers they should follow all believers now he lays it in there and the next page I skipped one paragraph he gets back these spirit is not seven spirits but one he will always be the same and act the same and the seven messengers will have the same spirit and teach the same word and have the same power and if the church is the true church it will have the very same spirit and word and acts of power that they had at Pentecost by experience it will be a Pentecostal church there will be tongue aren't you glad we had tongues back in February although we didn't get the interpretation we had tongues and didn't that edify you identified me Amen see the true church has to have that he says it will also have interpretation we had that years ago we had it a few years ago prophecy and healings now haven't had a little bit of prophecy there with the interpretation of years ago when Stephen Kressel was here and healings God will be in the midst of her and God will declare himself in the midst of her as he always has hallelujah and she will be unorganized don't forget that the seven spirit-filled messengers are the lord's they may be repudiated repudiated I'm sorry now this quote was supposed to encourage you so listen here you're like this they may be questioned indeed to human minds they may not even seem to qualify nevertheless there are the messengers to their age God used Abraham and he lied on numerous occasions even lying about his wife he used the Moses who rebelled and ran away from God for forty years he used the Jonah he disobeyed and left the presence of God just like Cain left the presence of God right but see he was a true child of God so God brought him back we know people that might leave the presence of god let's pray God brings them back they're Jonah amen they get back because my man said it's not a bad thing to be a Jonah he said we always you know make falling away Jonah's falling away a bad thing he said but he said it all worked out to God's plan for his life that's right listen to a man running for the presence of Lord 1963 he said he used a Samson he said he said sexually and he send all kinds over different David David murdered he sin sexually he also used a Joshua a Joseph and those with severe blemishes far outnumber those whose history seemed to be perfect goodness gracious all were and are his glory none dare deny that he used them by and through the Holy Spirit that he put within them to their own master they stood or fell and in them all was accomplished the sovereign will of God amen how many what God's will to be accomplished in their life think about this how many of us have gone through some some of us have never done these things praise God but let's just keep seeking God so the sovereign will of God can be accomplished amen that we can be true servants of God I'm thankful that we got the Holy Ghost Church this proves we got the Holy Ghost because men great men like this the great things were the anointing but when the anointing left they did evil things they murdered they slept around and all these evil things but see how the Holy Ghost is more powerful in this day it keeps us from doing those things because the Holy Ghost doesn't leave us it stays as a seal in our soul amen we're no greater than them but we have access to a greater power amen I'm so about the daily life amen we don't have to run for the presence of God or we don't have to do some of the things we have to murder like Moses we're not the murder like these why because we got God's sealed into our soul amen and he's at the center of our control tower hallelujah and he won't send us in some murdering way he won't send us in adultery you know why because we're sealing the soul romance that external history attempt to refute this it still stands the eternal God still walks amongst the golden lampstands and sends his messengers by his spirit with the word to the people of every age a man what a great closing that was to chapter two verse one or that part now let's go over Jesus says denunciation his correction on the the church here's the denied here's how he's rebuked in the Sardis charge I know thy works now has a name that thou livest and art dead and then he says for I have not found thy works perfect before God now look at this thought see this is a pretty good thought here here indeed is a very strange thing in every age to this point the spirit has first of all praise the true believers I want you to see how this is a and if you can see this you can mean we can be more and more thankful for God's grace if we can understand this point right here this will make us thankful as we leave those doors and a little bit here okay first and all the other ages that would always praise the believers but now this is a pure there's evidently such wanton I'm sorry husband went wanton I'm saying the wonton soup but it's rant and wanton I get it mixed up pulpit or pulpit which one I'm just I'm just ignorant sometimes do forgive me 110 said it wanton wanton there you go so this age is so wanton they have a wanton disregard for the Lord and his word that the entire message to the fifth age rings with condemnation in other words God has so very few believers in here he can't even say nothing positive about the age now he did have believers in there but so very few and church if you know that's the same thing for later to see you God doesn't complement this age with one thing so let's not pat ourselves on the back now we can be thankful for God's grace but overall as a age you know we're not doing so I mean that's an evil age we're not doing some great thing now God's doing a great work in our life but we as a church our small number and we're just fighting for our lives amen we're overcoming don't get row we're overcoming but the age itself is not a great overcoming age of lots of people it's very small so hope you can understand that so what we're saying is Ephesus Smyrna Pergamum Thyatira God Jesus started all his letters off with compliments I know your works and your faith and all these things member that I know your face you hate them that are evil remember those we preach all those but now in the fifth age Jesus doesn't say anything good about him remember I'm thinking you said something good about Philadelphia but he says nothing good about our church H because it's the very small church age with very small believers not many that are really truly on fire as a whole now Jesus says I know your works in the Sardis Church age remember 15 20 to 1750 that's the period we're looking at what were these works that came up before the Lord and caused his displeasure well you know that each church age lapped over to the next age so we have a continuation of the works of the fourth age into the fifth these works are I'm sorry as you are well aware of were these following okay I'm sorry these works as you are well aware of were there we go so here's the sins that we're lapping over into the Sardis age from the Thyer tear and age that's what it's saying number one the leadership of the Holy Spirit was superseded by human hierarchy okay so then take the Holy Ghost leadership they took man's leadership number two the pure Word of God and it's free benefit to all men was disposed for Creed's dogmas church orders etc number three the worship in the spirit and gifts of the Spirit and all that which pertains to true conform I'm sorry community fellowship of the Saints was cast aside for liturgy and literal idol worship pagan feasts etc and the last one is Mary ala tree was assuming a greater place in the Christian worship okay so well aren't you glad were free from those church aren't you glad were free for them we have no Creed here and anything I preach is outside the word you're welcome to bring it to me but most churches have creeds and dogmas like a book outside of the Bible but our Bible is the book a man this is the Creed book amen that's the only book we got and then the worship we need more we want to see more of that but we're thankful for what we do see and of course we condemn any Mary worship and we're led by the holy spirit in other words the church votes it's not me telling you what to vote for it's the church that rules this you cannot vote me out any time you want bang you vote us all out in any of the minute officers this is the church that you it's your church led by the Holy Spirit you understand it's not men ruling over you it's you choosing your leaders that's exactly right now next paragraph now toward the end of the fourth age which would be the beginning of the fifth age also the invasion of constant opal by the Turks set the learned scholars of the east with their Greek manuscripts to the west all right the purity of the word and the teaching of the true believer were thus disseminated or vanished and not only were these fine teachers of great importance but also the invention of what became the basis of our modern production of books thus we find the great hunger and demand for the Bible could be answered so here's the good part about our age or about the sardis age there's a pretty awful age overall but the good part was there was persecution that led these scholars to move west and then they they discovered and built a printing press and now they could print Bible teaching from Martin Luther John Calvin all these wonderful men and produce it and spread the word they could spread more of the truth before the Catholic Church controlled everything but now in this age there is some good works they're spreading the gospel amen through we say gospel tracts that's why they had God raised up many mighty men of which Luther was just one of them Calvin swingley and two other luminaries besides there were many many more who are not so well known however though all this was not in vain the mighty works of God was actually hindered by these very men so the men were started out as good but then they did some moves that hindered the church for one thing they did not oppose the church state marriage of the niceic Council but actually foster that union so while they had some truth they still lean toward Creed's right from the counsels and so forth look at this in spite of Luther's constant teaching against outside interference and local church matters he was not able to clear men's minds of the bishop Archbishop concept of church government so even Martin Luther the church age messenger couldn't get rid of this human government thus the church took one step in the right direction but still remain shackled so in short order she was again in prison in the same dungeon whence she had attempted to escape now I put a note here we can see the blessings the justification doctrine and the printing presses you say men those are good blessings this church age they had justification they knew were saved by grace through faith we're not saved by works without save through indulgences or penances or paying off the Pope or anything like that we're not saved by that we're saved by grace and we can spread the true Word of God all that we know amen but now brother Aaron said now he gets to the Dunstan denunciation the bad part that was the good part now is the bad part if there ever was a time of denominational zeal it was at this tragic time so here's the church age again remember they're living a name but they're dead that's the that's the awful part so I just brought that up one more time to show you this this was the awful part they started off good Martin Luther started off good but then we're gonna read here in the second generation after Martin Luther they denominated and made the Lutheran Church right so brother man said they're like a shackle all they got was one step forward but at least they got a step forward praise God because remember Martin Luther had the Holy Ghost anointing on him praise God he's a true man of God he made a few mistakes right but he's a true man of God now the greatest age of disease the Prophet says now I just said that this era gave tremendous growth to denominational spirit if the Corinthian attitude was I am appalled I am of Cephas was ever exhibited it was now there were Lutheran's Hussites wigglies party etc such fragmentation of the body were deplorable was deplorable they were living a name but they were dead certainly they were dead they died the minute they organized the great groups organized and tied themselves in matrimony to the state they did it I'm sorry that did it they were finished here were those Lutheran's who had criticized the Roman Church they knew the unrighteousness of political and spiritual unions yet Luther as when Peter was over bounced by the Judaizers and the Galatians to member that went right ahead and made the same and of God and defender of the faith okay so Martin Luther didn't preach against the church and state you so he should have this is the first denomination of repute that came out of the harlot but when Luther died it was not long until it had a hierarchy like the one it had fought this move of God by the time the second generation came along was right back under the wing of her mother amen she had gone back and did not even know it they had taken on their own name above his name they were living their own name - so which generation started denomination the second generation it wasn't Luther's generation it was the one after him praise God so the same thing must be true today brother Branham never started generation right it would have been the generation after which like I said now we're the third generation after it because we're about the age of brother Josef's children right we're about Hitler the age of his children cuz he's in his 60s he's the same age as brother Brooks 61 I'm not mistaken 60 or 61 so it's let me say like this I don't know any churches that have denominated but the way for a message Church to nominate is to just believe brother Branham was a prophet and not really get the Holy Ghost yourself but just believe he was a prophet right and boolean and you can and they could celebrate brother branham's miracles but had no Americas of their own see they'd be living off of brother branham's experience instead of knowing God for themselves does that make sense hope that makes sense that's a second-generation person that would start their own message denomination they would not know God the same way that brother Branham knew God but see we've got an over RAM we got no brother it was God the same way he knew him amen and trust that's why we got to come to church praying and expecting and believing right having expectation before God that's why we should hunger for God amen because we're not living on brother brands reputation we want to live on the reputation of God amen God's reputation amen we appreciate by the Rams testimony but we've got to have our own amen but see we can't let ourselves to nominate we've got to stay on fire Amen by the Holy Spirit and brother Branham said all the denominations are doing that very thing today they're living their own name and not the name of the Lord Jesus Christ that has easily seen for every church is known by the way it worships but none are known by the power of God there is your test now how about that statement you know I told you this before but my cousin and different ones they go to churches that are known for their rock and roll that's what they're known for or maybe this famous preacher or something like that now church that's the test of a true church what is the church known for is it Creed's is it rock and roll is that for doing soup suppers what's it what are they known for we should be a church that's known for the power of God whether people recognize it or not we know what the power of God has done in our lives amen we don't go bragging and telling what God did on every street corner we don't brag with the sign out front but we know what our church stands for the power of the Holy Spirit to bring real conviction into real lives to really sanctify them out so they can be filled with the Holy Ghost and then these signs follow then they'll believe sometimes in your life you'll receive healings and tongues and interpretations and prophecies that's what our church should be known for the power of God amen it's not we're not the true Church because that's what he says that is your test we're not to be known by the way we worship are we always sing these types of songs or we all stand when we do this we all sit when we do we do this but we should be known that the Holy Spirit moves in power and I want you to notice right here that this era did not have the signs and wonders among them they gave up the power of God for the power of the state they clung to their own name they made their names great it was that old spear getting everyone into its fold see we don't want to promote our name I don't want you to promote me we want to promote Jesus Christ that's why when we testify saying oh God moved into our church or God blessed somebody with the healing in our church or God answered our prayer always testify about Jesus not about all of us testify about Christ amen that's our truth that's the true church we don't cling to our names we cling to Christ's name just want to make sure I say that today the Baptist's want the messes to come over to the Baptist's the Methodists are out to preside the Presbyterians and the Pentecostals want them all each claims to offer the MOE and to hold out the greatest hopes a sort of door to heaven or at least the way to a more abundant entrance how tragic it all is right because they want to go after different denominations and so it's dangerous right you should not when you should not try to proselyte and church how we do it here we don't process like we don't go another churches and try to pull them and make them all come to our church we don't process like that but one thing we do have we have this confidence all that the father has given us will come to us we are the only message Church in this city as far as I know and we don't proselyte from other churches to try to bring them in we want to bring in all God's sheep and we want to be able to receive all the turn of God we want all God's order to come to our church if they're called to our church if they don't that's fine it's fine up to them we're not trying to proselyte and beg people to come to this church and pay them money or promised them offices if they'll come to their church will promise them one thing eternal life if they'll believe amen that's a hollow promise see proselyting is like Oh join our church and we'll give you something or we'll make you famous or we're so we're nothing Christ is everything here amen and it's tragic when they just want to proselyte into the church all right so sad but we want people to know Jesus Christ it makes me cry honestly it makes me cry weak when people come in here get baptized and then fall away it makes me weep and cry because I want them to know Christ like I know Christ and if they knew Christ like I knew Christ they would never leave the Word of God and it makes me weep and cry when we we struggle and pray for them so hard and then they deny the Word of God but that's fine we'll just keep praying and believing but we'll be the life we are the light of the world we must stand as a city on a hill that cannot be hid and we must let our good works be seen before men not to brag or boast but let the power of God show through our lives I told you I prayed for one of our co-workers remember this he's a janitor and remember I told you about this he almost died and I said lord I prayed at that school I said if you bring him out I'll testify about Jesus Christ in well God brought him out he was in a coma for three weeks and they almost pulled the plug on him but God brought him out and he's back at work and I witnessed to him and I'm trying to get in and I said we got to talk about your soul we got to talk about your soul and he keeps putting it off well I seen him a few weeks ago when I was at the school and he said Jessie he said I gotta tell you something something happened to me I was on my deck behind my house and there was all this patio furniture and he said he said we already had a tree that was leaning I was and it was leaning like right it would have fell right on him I guess it was a big huge tree but they just let it lean I guess it grew crooked anyways I'm trying to remember the story he said we had an awful storm in copley he said lightning hit the tree or something happened and he said it should have fallen on me because he said the laws of nature say that if a tree is leaning this way it falls he said it should have hit me our house and our furniture we should have lost everything he said but when something struck that tree he said it fell the opposite way he said Jessie what did that and I said God did that and he knew it but he was wanting me to say it because he says he doesn't really have a believe in God and he told me again he said Jessie what did that what defy the laws of nature and gravity I said God did that sir he's trying to get a hold of your life he brought you out of a coma and he brought you back here he saved you from being crushed by a tree he brought you back here I said so when can we meet up and talk about your soul so I'm waiting on his text to get back to me that was just last week see God is trying to prove to everybody that he's the god of power amen glory just showed into him God is the god of power he denies nature remember Tim Myers testimony when he was a boy he was riding a tractor he was riding his dad's tractor that he was dad was a farmer he said he was riding on a hill and this is his own testimony if you remember I don't remember this or not he said he was riding on a hill and the weight of the tractor was overcoming him and he said the tractor leaned like kind of lean I forget what it was and it just kind of stuck on its side and it stopped in midair and he fell off and the tractor hung there on the hill like halfway in the air and he said once he got off a walked away the tractor then fell down that's Tim Myers testimony and so he used that testimony to show that God controls the laws of nature he said it should have fell on me but it because God was protected my life what do we serve we serve the Living God amen the god of power but see it's tragic when people try to convert or proselyte but God will show all his children his love and power he'll draw all them unto Him amen now trying to bring this down to close here here we go yeah I got twenty minutes that's plane time in closing our comments on this verse Oh verse 1 revelation 3:1 Jesus says thou hast a name that thou lovest and our dead I cannot impress upon you too strongly that in this case go it brought the Reformation was most certainly rebuked by God instead of being praised because it sold the seeds of denomination that organized right back to the harlot that's why God rebukes us so much because instead of being free oh we're free from the harlot they just act like her and they denominated lock themselves in and that's why God was so upset with this church they didn't go on with more of the Holy Ghost they stopped right there now that's dangerous for us as masters believers we got to keep going on with the Holy Ghost well we say well I know about God I know about water baptism but how about more of the Holy Spirit our daily lives how about that we all need more of that by the grace of God any church today could nominate just as easily as they denominated by denying the further working of the Holy Spirit exactly right now I'm gonna skip that thus instead of being a great spiritual move with all the earmarks of the Holy Spirit influence as when God used purely spiritual means to accomplish his ends at Pentecost it was indeed a work wherein the wrath of God praise God and the results paralleled the history of Israel and when she left Egypt of wandering the desert not making it the Canaan land however much was accomplished in in that where the yoke of Rome was even partly broken men could now receive the Word of God and yield to the influence of the sphere without such great fear as formerly this opened the door to the great missionary age to follow Amon is that wonderful he said even though they denominated there were some people that got free and stayed free and that open the door to the great missionary age amen almost done here almost done I'm sorry let me go back this is his closing comment on the denunciation or Jesus's rebuke upon the church age the Jezebel Thyatira was in no mood to give up her hold upon the people because member she had it for 900 years remember she had for 900 years on the fire dear in church age and thus we see her daughter Ethel AIA member atholea raised her head in the Sardis and age with the hopes that she would be able to strangle the true seen by her schemes of organization so we're looking at type now Jezebel was the spirit of Tyre tiara and now the denominations of Sardis are the atholea of Jezebel's motherhood okay so in other words the denominations of the Lutheran age were the daughters of the mother harlot that's what it's saying okay now remember this is the bio dictionary after liya means whom God afflicts in that an awful name to have whom God we don't want to be afflicted nah we know we know their suffering we want to be blessed by God not afflicted but they chose her to name or Athlon that strange the daughter of Ahab and Jezebel and the wife of Jay who ran the king of Judah who walked in the ways of the house of Ahab called daughter of Omri on the death of her husband and of her son at I'm sorry Isaiah she resolved to seat herself on the vacant throne remember that her husband died her son died so she said oh if they die I'll take the throne a woman taking the throne see how that's the type of the denominational spirit and Luther taking the throne right instead of letting the Holy Spirit do it she slew awe as has I as children except joash the youngest after a reign of six years she was put to death in an insurrection certain up among the people in connection with Josiah being crowned as king remember they say that in the seed mermen they say the seed of David a saving of him and she was queen for six years but then they brought out the boy made him King remember that the little boy that's beautiful so that's the type church that's the type the Sardis church age is the daughter to the mothers let's go back to there so I can show that one more time then we're almost done okay so let's show that again so Jezebel the fire to your age that's the mother harlot and the daughters so the the daughters the Lutheran's and all the i'ts and his sights and Hussites all the things they were the daughter when they denominated they they were the daughter of the mother hards that makes sense everybody okay this was the mother Roman Church all the churches that came out and denominated were harlots now Luther was not a harlot Luther was not he was a true man of God it was a generation after him that was the harlots because they denarii and so this is as far as we can go we can't learn anything else we can't grow any further than the Holy Spirit oh god help us to grow in the Holy Spirit amen help us to learn more the Holy Spirit's love more of his power amen we have to have that Russell denominator we have to move on with the Holy Spirit now I have a few last quotes I got one two three four few more slides here then we'll be done I can't go much for that God speak all week here at school I've already lost my voice she actually sounds pretty good tonight by God's grace alright now here's the sermon listen to the sermon again on Saturday listen to the whole sermon on Saturday again last Saturday of the Sardis Church age from 1960 here's something I want to throw in I don't know if you do this we raise it at church Adam no okay okay and sister Bo did you have confirmations in your church growing up they couldn't firm you guys when you were like 16 okay they didn't in our church either but my wife's Church had it they had confirmation services so you guys do you know what that is it's kind of like when they make they confirm you as you're out you're now a member of the church and you're like 16 years old it's like a false conversion in other words they educate you to the church rather than your being born into the church but my wife was raised in a Lutheran Church and that's what they did for her so my wife was confirmed I think at 16 years old or 15 we kind of laughed it's a sad it's a sad laugh okay I'm not making fun of the church it's just a sad laugh because that's how they get members and brother John brother John Graham he was confirmed in Lutheran Church and after God confirm he his mom gave the choice when I go back to church anymore he said no said why should I go there's nothing there for me and he left the church so see that's what a lot of people believe they just want to get them confirmed and then think they're saved well you don't got to get confirmed you got to get borned you got to get born in the kingdom of God now this is a kind of a I say a funny quote brother Branham gives but it's a very true quote as well so this quote he said oh all that confirming service what I'm trying to say take them down and confirm them give them the first communion and confirm them there's no such thing as confirming in the Bible so that's what the Lutheran's new church the Lutheran's and even the Catholics through their first communion you remember that you ever know anybody that's Catholic they've let them do their first communion when they're I think like 9 or 10 or something like that they teach them all the Catholic doctrine then they let them do their first communion so it's kind of like that it's kinda like educating members of the church whether we have said the only confirming that's mentioned the Bible is when God confirmed his word with signs and wonders following him so brother I've got to makes a joke on the word confirm now it's not really a joke but it's true so let's go to mark 16 let's read that so you know the only confirming in the Bible is when God confirms you're a believer with miracles that's the only one but see the denomination is denominated and now they confirm members oh you're 15 or 16 you learned all our our Creed's now you're confirmed now you're a real member of the church and that's there's nothing true about that in the Bible Matthew Mark Luke okay mark 16 this is a beautiful scripture for a while that's one of my favorite Scripture God when I travel other places I would normally quote this scripture because it gave me such strength and courage mark 16 verse yes 20 last verse of the book of Mark mark 16:20 Brad you ever read that Forster yes praise God where that makes a little joke the Sardis church age started the confirmations brother have said the only confirmation is God confirming his believers with miracles hey man I love that don't you love that I love how he's a scriptural prophet see the denominations take Bible words and they change them to make them use whatever they want but I love my brother and we'll take it right back to the Word of God that's that that's what believers that's how believers are confirmed right there God has supernatural following your life amen that's the confirming not the confirming of the belonging to a Lutheran Church but God confirming his word in you and then he quotes this and the Lord was working with them mark 16 confirming the word with signs following that's the confirming of the Pentecostal church that's God confirms himself alive as a miracle-working God in the church speaking in tongues interpretation of tongues and doing the same things they did at the beginning you like that a man thought that was a blessing I don't remember why I had this quote so I'm not gonna read that one tonight I'm just gonna close to this one I closed this I closed part 1 of this series by telling this story about the cat remember rubbing the cat backwards you guys remember that when I preached out here and that might have been the night I prayed to witness to my mother about denomination that might have been that same night I think it was but I wanted to show you this vision so you know it's a vision you know it wasn't it wasn't a dream it was a vision and visions member never fail right they always they're always true brother Graham is in Tulsa Oklahoma and he said I was getting an awful mess there them denominations begin swinging around there and I was sitting up this building one day and I seen a vision I seen a pretty little old kitten and he was laying on a silk pillow and he was a cutest little fellow and I walked over there and I'm afraid of a cat brother man was afraid of cats he said he's afraid of cats and swords did you know that and I went over and I began to rake him and he was going you know how they do that funny noise you know I was raking him and I said pretty little kitty and he said purr just as fine you know he had a vision of this church and I looked over behind his pillow and it said Pentecostal kitten well I thought now isn't this strange and I said this has got to be a vision a Pentecostal kitten now notice it's not a line it's a kitten it's in the same family but it's a different species I believe we're not mistaken family order genus species one of those I think bow memorize that one time I had to memorize in high school I forget it now it's the same family the cat family the feline different species I think I could be correct me after service if I'm right wrong in that one and something said to brother and the Holy Spirit said to brother Branham as long as you rake his fur this way all right but now if you want to see what he's made of rake his fur backwards see so when I raked his fur back so before he was petting the kitty pretty little kitty pretty little kitty and someone said rake him backwards so he took it and went backward so made his hair go the opposite way instead of the regular way pulling his hair backwards so when I raked it back then I stuck out green and he was a monster standing there spitting at me as hard as he could a cat when he started going backwards on the ferns that pretty little kitty pretty little denomination pretty little denomination right oh you're just a pretty believer pretty good believer petting them see this is a vision church is a vision see just rake his fur back a little bit tell him the Baptism and the Father Son Holy Ghost is of the devil and of the Catholic Church watch what happens to him see his furs get up so see now no how do we act when someone condemns our beliefs see this is how just the denominational person will act if you say one bad thing about their belief though their eyes will bug out and they'll turn into a monster in other words they'll get their get fiery mad they're gonna really get upset at you when you say one bad thing about what they believe but how do we act Church when someone does something that we don't agree with how do we act well Graham tells us he says if you can't disagree with the man things and then shake his hand and still have the same feelings towards and then there's something wrong with you if I can't disagree with the man bitterly from from one side to the other and still think as much of him as Christ would then there's something wrong with my spirit I have in the Spirit of Christ see if he says well brother Branham I believe you're teaching this and that all right brother let's come together to reason you and I will take it ourselves we'll go over here in the room to ourselves well reason it out that's from 1963 it's kind of like this recently I've sat down and I've had some really good conversations with some brothers and Jose was there i sat down with the brother recently Kevin knows him a really fantastic beautiful brother but he believes it so we should play more tapes but we got to sit down and Jose stood right there and we disagreed bitterly but at the end we smiled and shook hands and I think so much of him I think he's just a wonderful Christian cuz he loves the Lord so much I don't think any lesson although we bitterly disagree about preachers and tapes and services although he disagree bitterly at the end of it we're still able to shake each other's hands and I'm still waiting on some course he told me there's some quotes I've never heard him before I'm still waiting on those quotes and hopefully I'll hear those from him pretty soon I honestly don't think they exist I just disagree with that I disagree with some of the things that they believe but this church the thing is we can shake hands and hug each other and I think just as much of him as hopefully he does of me is that how you feel with people you should feel that way with people when even when they disagree with what we believe but that's recently a good example of that of when I can see this in my own life I see this manifesting in my life I can disagree with people I still love them praise God let's say in our fetus last quote and he just cuts me to pieces and I have to say things back to him if in my heart I can't feel the same about him that he's still my brother and I'm trying to help this guy then I'll never help him there's no way for me to help him if I don't love him what's the use of going over there tell him the first place brother I don't love you and let me get that out of my heart right here before we go in there because I can't help you it's I love you a man you appreciate that quote I thought that was a good it's a good check you know because here I am more preaching on the cat you know if oh that's how denomination she'll be black but we've got to make sure the denominational spirit that doesn't battle us praise God and doesn't overcome us so if somebody totally disagrees with the way we do church order or the way we believe in gifts or the way we pray at the end of service or I think we believe about the seals of the church ages are the book of Revelation we can stand there and be just as loving to the person and feel it in our heart that's what I want I want to feel love into my heart for somebody who even thinks I'm wrong and then that shows I got the right spirit praise God mama closer to that by the grace alone there's more quotes like I said I got a lot more quote you love the Lord Jesus tonight let's just no word of Prayer let's ask God to give us the right spirit and to remember how important these services are we looked at the Seven Stars tonight let me review real quick look at the denunciation right we want to live the name of Christ we want the power of Christ in our church don't we Halloween us pray for that as we pose to to keep the power of Christ our life and the voice be loving not the nominate and be full of God's love of power Heavenly Father we love you tonight Lord Jesus nor this is a sacred time I remember on the way here that the pillar fire came down to show how important these quotes were how important this teaching was to know how the Holy Spirit lived in the life of Martin Luther the good things from his life and all the other believers to show what the Holy Ghost was like but then also to show how many displeased the Holy Ghost and the rallied around denominations and rallied around men rather than the power of God Lord I've never heard tonight at all I know my throat hurts the Lord I just want to make sure I take a few moments I want to thank you for the times that your power has moved in our church Lord God anointing different ones Lord God for divine healing we thank you for that Lord most importantly thank you for anointing those to receive salvation for their souls for there is no greater miracle than the salvation of a soul or God the Father I believe I found the other day I think we have 19 souls in our church at dolls or now we have the numerous children I have more than that Lord that have we believe have been saved heaven baptize in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ and their their sins are now remitted their sins are underneath the blood of Jesus Christ help us never forget those mighty miracles in the power God in order to be close well lord help us to be filled with love more God if we disagree with any person the Lord God may we still think of them so much even though we might bitterly disagree but still be so full of love that we think as much of them as Christ thinks of them and we know in Christ follow them Christ died for them Lord God that's how much he loved them so help us to have that kind of love dear Jesus to think so highly of those that disagree with us those that won't cover the church those that won't listen to those services won't listen to the messages Lord God help us make so much of them Lord God to think as much as you do Lord that our hearts might be filled with the love of Christ thank you Lord now also not pray let the power of God continue to confirm this church Lord God let the power of the Holy Ghost move I pray for tongues I pray for interpretations I pray for prophecies I pray for healing as Lord God I pray for the gift of faith Lord God I pray for the Holy Ghost to move to confirm our church because we know we have to give an account before you Lord God you hate a powerless Church you hate order life where there's no power of the Holy Ghost in people's lives you hate that kind of life but you love a life that's unit to you that's desperate for the love of God that's desperate for the move of the Holy Ghost you love a life that's for the power or God give us sincerity because sincerity brings power and the Lord as I often pray gris-gris revivals in our prayer lives in our homes dear God bring revivals to the whole church Lord God that the church might be full of love full of power nothing doubting having the power of God there of not the form of the power of God in turn from such we turn away we turn away from churches that are known by their use it when are known by a famous creature help us to be a church that's know by the power of the Holy Ghost or God to change souls the Queen lives and induced supernatural signs wonders and miracles let our church do you know about that Lord Jesus Lord our church bears your name the Bride of Christ Christ we want the fullness of Christ and our members one of God let the fullness of Christ be our church and our members Lord God they would be living epistles living stones hallelujah no read of all men let us be the cities on the hill that cannot be hidden if no one else I believe Lord will believe Lord Jesus let us be paid for Lord Jesus do you come let's not de nominate Lord God lives have the power God amongst us Lord Jesus I prayed for that Lord sincerely tonight knowing that you answer Lord God knowing that you're faithful thanking you for what you have done in power and asking you to do more for all we must give an account we never wanted to nominate we never want to backslide help us to stay hungry I was the safe thirsty Lord in Jesus Christ [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] let's see that praise God we feel the rain of your life we feel the wind now the hard [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] hallelujah Jesus another raining Lord of your

[Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Applause] [Music] you want to be known by the name of Jesus Christ God will help us by His grace it is mercy Heavenly Father we love you Lord we love you're holding in your Jesus we want to pass that test Lord we always want to be a church where your power can flow through us and we'll be known by your name dear Jesus not a hard name dear God but by the name of the Lord Jesus Christ bless your people tonight thank you for these truths from your word Lord the seven spirits Lord God and how we can live your name not our own name but we can learn from the Sardis age and Lord have the power of God we can all be confirmed by the power of God amen for Jesus you can all make a firm by your power Lord thank you Jesus let's be confirmative Lord let us also Jesus have love so when someone speaks against us or disagrees with us we could be so full of that we still think so much of them and hope them to be saved and hope them more to be healed or whenever they need lord help us have that much love of Christ in our lives Lord bless your Saints that came out to the house of lords and I bless them for their faithfulness view of those maybe some are sick Lord's are not usually there's more father preps not sure why the Lord may your spirit minister then may
