Great son of God, we come to you and worship you today. We pray you'd make intercession, son of God, to the father for our request that we prayed before the service. God, meet those needs. I pray in a special way, especially heal all those that are sick and afflicted. Brother Chris is sick today with the flu. Sister TR is sick. Tulsi's had a fever. Lord, touch their bodies. We ask by the power of the Holy Ghost in Jesus Christ's [music] name. We have confidence in your blood, confidence in the Holy Spirit today to touch their bodies, God.

We expect to hear from heaven, Lord God. [music] So, let us hear from heaven today, God. And may you get all the glory, Lord Jesus. For you alone are worthy. And we come to adore you, Lord God, today. [music] We worship you, Jesus. Bless our service, our preaching, our singing in Jesus Christ's name. And the saints said, "Amen." Praise God. Let's take our Bibles here. Let's go to St. John. St. John, chapter 19. By God's grace, St. John 19. If I had a title this morning, I like to call it There Came forth Blood and Water. I like to look at the blood and water today. There came forth blood and water. John 19:31. If you have your Bibles, this is kind of like a part two to the sermon I preached in the cliff of the rock. If you remember that by God's grace, what a great uh lesson that was from the Bible, not from me, but from the Bible. Aren't you glad, church, that you are hidden in Christ. Just as Moses Moses was hid in that rock, so are you hidden in Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. Then as I was preaching, I got these numerous thoughts and I thought, well, there's going to be another sermon by the grace of the Lord. John chapter 19:31 John 19:31. There came forth blood and water. 31. I'll read 31 and uh let's all read 34 and then I'll read uh what we'll just stop at 34. Yeah. So I'll read 31-33 and then we can all read 34 together. The Jews therefore because it was the preparation that the body should not remain upon the cross on the Sabbath day. For that Sabbath day was a and high day besought Pilate that their legs might be broken and that they might be taken away. Then came the soldiers and break the legs of the first and of the other which was crucified with him. But when they came to Jesus, they saw that he was dead already. They break not his legs. Let's read 34 on three. One, two, three. But one of the soldiers with a spear, pierced his side, and forth with came there out blood and water. May God add the blessing to the reading of his word. You can be seated. by the grace of God. I'll finish that section there. Verse 35. And he saw I'm sorry. And he that saw it bear record, and his record is true. And he knoweth that he saith true that ye might believe. Now, who's he talking about? John's talking about himself. John saw this. So, remember, all the other disciples had run like sheep. The Bible said, "If you smite the shepherd, the sheep will be scattered." So all the other uh apostles ran away except John. John was there. Hallelujah. And he witnessed this and he bare record that when the soldier put the spear in Jesus's side, there came forth blood and then water. This was important as we'll see through this sermon here by God's grace. Of course, if you're a Bible reader, you can probably already put it together here. He said in verse 35, "And he saw that it bear record." I'm sorry. And he that saw it bear record, and his record is true, and he knoweth that he saith true, that ye might believe. So God had witnesses there so you and I would believe. How many believe Jesus died for us? Amen. &gt;&gt; How many believe Jesus Christ rose from the dead? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. There are witnesses, eyewitnesses, that have their accounts recorded that you and I might believe. You say, "Well, I I I've never seen it." Well, Jesus said, "You're more blessed if you haven't seen it and you still believe." So, we want to be more blessed today. Hallelujah. Verse 36. For these things were done that the scripture might be fulfilled. A bone of him shall not be broken. So God allowed all this to fulfill the scripture that they wouldn't break his bones. So think of that. The two thieves on the side, the soldier came around with his spear perhaps and broke their legs. So then they couldn't even raise themselves up to get a breath. They just had to stay down and just we'd say drowned in their own water and blood, we'd say, because they couldn't get up to get any oxygen. But the Lord Jesus had already passed away. He'd already dismissed his spirit. Verse 37. And again, another scripture saith, they shall look on him whom they pierced. Amen. You can switch over. I have a few slides here. So this morning, we want to look at there came forth blood and water. And uh you know it was through this sermon that I've I fully unders now I can understand what brother Brandham said. I've always struggled with something brother Ram said about Adam uh and Eve and also uh the cross. And so through this message God helped me to understand it. So I hope the Holy Spirit can help me to relay it to you. How many want to understand the Bible better? Hallelujah. I do too. I I trust you do by God's grace. Amen. So I want to uh take these thoughts here. There came forth blood and water. We read our text here uh by God's grace. Now just remember a few Wednesdays ago I preached on in the cliffs of the rock. It's a beautiful uh type of what God does to us. We are like Moses, right? Moses was a murderer, right? Moses got angry. He named the people bunch of rebels, right? In other words, we know he was a sinful man. &gt;&gt; But yet he was a forgiven man. So Moses represents all of us and he said, "Show me your glory." And God did not show him the Red Sea parted again. God did not show him the pillar of fire again. God proclaimed his character to Moses. And he said, "I'm long-suffering." Hallelujah. I'm merciful. I'm a God of truth. Hallelujah. I bless each generation that will serve me. Hallelujah. And he he he also puts the iniquity from one generation to another if they won't repent. That was God's glory. That God is a gracious, gracious and merciful God. And that's the God we serve today. Hallelujah. We're thankful for God's glory. And Moses said, "Lord, I've seen all these miracles, but I want to see your glory." And so God showed him his character that God is a God of love. And so Moses is represented uh or he represents us. We were put in the rock and the Bible said that rock was Christ in 1 Corinthians chapter 10. So God hid Moses so he wouldn't die when God passed by. So there again, we get another look at the Passover lamb, right? Because death was going to pass over. But there's one thing that protected the the believers. That was the blood of the lamb. Hallelujah. Amen. So we see that picture again. When God passes by to destroy and to punish death, as long as we're in Christ, then we shall not die. We shall live. It's so important to be in Christ today. Not to be in high school or not to be in a school, right? Not to be in a club, not to just be a part of a a company. That's not necessarily what we want to be in. We want to be in Jesus Christ today by faith. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. And so the Bible said the rock was cleft. In other words, the rock was broken. The the rock was pierced. Hallelujah. And the rock was opened up. And so Moses was put in the cleft of the rock or the broken part of the rock. And that's you and I. Jesus's body was broken so that we could find healing inside Jesus's body. Hallelujah. Through Jesus, we are uh we are healed. So we're put into Christ. And so as Moses was hidden in Christ, we are hidden in Christ. So when God's spirit passes by, God's hand covers us. How many know God's hand covers your life today? &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Amen. God covers you. You're covered by the blood of Jesus Christ. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And then Moses at the very end, he got a glimpse of the backside of God. But the Bible says we don't get a glimpse. The Bible said we look in the very face of Jesus Christ today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Praise God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's so beautiful. Amen. Through that wonderful message the Bible gives us, church, we see two other mentions of Jesus's side. Hallelujah. Because we know the rock the the cleft rock was a type of Jesus broken for us. Jesus was cleft rock of ages cleft for me. &gt;&gt; Let me hide myself in thee. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; That great song. So remember Jesus was his his side was pierced or his side had a cleft in it as a testimony. So this is a testimony. Jesus was wounded for our transgressions. Hallelujah. And with his stripes we are healed. &gt;&gt; Amen. So we see the side of Jesus mentioned twice on the the cross. He was he was uh pierced the Bible said that's one mention and the other mention is beautiful after his resurrection and it was uh a week after his resurrection right because Thomas wasn't there on the night of his resurrection. So Jesus came back the next week. Aren't you glad Jesus keeps coming back to our services week after week after week? And the church said &gt;&gt; I'm glad about it. Amen. that God doesn't that you know God doesn't withhold his spirit, but his spirit keeps drawing us closer to him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; He comes again. He comes the next year. I'm glad he didn't stop coming in 2019. Hallelujah. I'm glad he keeps coming. And he'll come again in 2026. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He'll come until every elect believer believes the word of God. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I love this. He comes to Thomas to make sure Thomas believes. And church, he'll come to you. If you need to see a miracle, God will show you one. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. If that's what you need, whatever you need, God will give the elect what they have need of. &gt;&gt; Delight yourself in the Lord and God will give you the desire of your heart. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And I love what Jesus says. If you don't believe, he said, "Reach your hand in." He said, "Thrust it into my side." So, think about a man's hand. And that that wound was so big. He said, "Thrust your hand in." He didn't say, "Your finger, your hand. So, think about how big that Roman spear was, church. That Roman spear was so big. No, uh, if you've seen The Passion, that's one of the few movies I'd actually go see in the theater from Mel Gibson. Uh, you get the picture of it. You know, he just jams that that large spear and outpours of blood in the water. And Jesus said it was so big. Put your hand inside me so you'll believe. Hallelujah. And I'll close with that at the end. by God's grace. I didn't check the timer how long I'll preach, but I'm not really going to pay attention to time today. Now, church, you probably heard of this, but there's at least four conditions that this that that that that would have caused the blood and water to separate. There's at least four. I'm just going to look at one. I'll explain it by what I got from the internet. All right? Because I can't really explain it. I'm not a doctor. I just take what they tell me, right? All right. But there's at least four conditions that uh could have happened that cause blood and water to separate. One of them is called plural eusion. The other one's paricardial eusion and heop paricardium and post-mortem serum separation. So it's one of those. I just chose one of them. Okay? Because I don't I don't need to you don't need to know the science. You need to know the faith behind it. Hallelujah. You don't need the you don't need to know the natural causes. You need to know the spiritual effects of the blood and water. Hallelujah. You need to know what this produce. What did this give for you? What did it help you and I with? Oh, it helped a lot. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, plural eusion is the accumulation of cirrus or cleary watery fluid in the plural cavity. Now, I might be pronouncing these wrong. Just forgive me. Again, I'm not a doctor. I'm not a nurse. And this is the cavity that's around the lungs. And this is caused from severe trauma, congestive heart failure, uh hip failure rather, hypo volmic shock, asphyxiation and crucifixion stress. All these can cause a flu up buildup in the chest. So the fluid gets built up. It's not supposed to be there, but because of all these conditions, it builds up. And if the spear pierced Jesus's chest wall or the plural cavity or the lung or the heart, then this uh this clear plural fluid or water could flow out first followed by the blood. Now I don't know if if the blood came first or the water, right? Because this is medical. The Bible said blood in verse uh verse 34. There came out blood and water. I don't know that the Bible's trying to put it in that order. I don't think it really matters. What matters is that water and blood came out for you and I. &gt;&gt; How many grateful that Jesus took your cross for you? &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; This is what you deserve. You and I deserved asphyxiation, not being able to breathe, &gt;&gt; right? &gt;&gt; You and I deserve severe trauma and congestive heart failure. That's what we deserve. But Jesus took it for us. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And he's worthy of our praise today. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Jesus paid it all. All to him I owe. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Sin had left a crimson stain, but Jesus washed that stain white as snow. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Now remember the Bible said and and we'll read this later, but the Bible said in 1 John 5:6 that Jesus came by water and blood. Now this water and blood can refer to two things. It could refer to his birth because whenever a baby's born, the uh the water breaks first. I've seen nine of them. Hallelujah. And then then comes the blood. Hallelujah. Water and blood and then life. Water, blood, life. Hallelujah. Water, blood, spirit. Or uh it also could now no doubt this also refers to the cross of Jesus Christ because he gave up the ghost. So the spirit, you have the spirit and you have water and blood as well. So all three are present on the cross. Water, blood, spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Now, just so you're a student of the word of God, uh is this Jesus on the cross? Is this an allegory or is this typology? Because I want I always forget these and I need to rehearse them myself. Now, an allegory is told to reveal a hidden meaning. Uh so, it's an allegory. An allegory is not especially pointing to a future event, but a type is pointing to a future event. Everybody understand the difference? An allegory just reveals a meaning. There's meaning behind this story, but a type foretell a future event. All right. Now, if you got your Bible, go to Galatians 4:24. You'll see what I'm talking about. So, church, this is what this is what brother calls reading between the lines. Paul understood this. That's why he wrote Galatians 4:24. And we understand it as well. In other words, there's hidden meaning in stories, the Old Testament, church. They're not boring stories if you can see the allegory in them. &gt;&gt; They're not boring stories if we can see the types of the future in them. &gt;&gt; Galatians 4:24. Sorry, I'm a little slow getting there. [clears throat] Now, let's actually go up a little bit to verse 22. For it is written that Abraham had two sons, by one a bond made and the other a free woman. But he who was of the bond woman, Ishmael, was born after the flesh. Abraham's carnal desire for Hagar. But he of the free woman was by promise. So Isaac came by a promise to Abraham and Sarah. &gt;&gt; But Ishmael came by Abraham's physical desire. All right. Verse 24. Which things are in what, church? and allegory. For these are the two covenants, the one from Mount Si, which generalth to bondage, which is Aar. For this Aar is Mount Si and Arabia, and answerth to Jerusalem, which now is and in bondage with her children. But Jerusalem, which is above, is free, which is the mother of us all. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; So these two women and their children represent the Old Testament and the New Testament, &gt;&gt; right? The law kept you in bondage to sin. Right? Because if you break one, you're guilty of all. &gt;&gt; Right? But in the New Testament, you break one, you're forgiven of all. Hallelujah. [laughter] Amen. Because Jesus paid it all. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; See that? See, in the Old Testament came by the flesh, &gt;&gt; right? It was written on stony tables. &gt;&gt; But the New Testament comes by the promise of God to send Jesus. And now he writes the word on the fleshly tables of your heart. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So that's an allegory. An allegory is a story that gives future meaning or there's a hidden meaning in there. Wow. Ishmael and Isaac represent Old Testament, New Testament. Hallelujah. Is that helped by God's grace, church? &gt;&gt; Now, keep in mind, we're look at the blood and water has meaning as well. That's what I'm just showing this so you understand what the blood and water can mean to you today. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Church, I think it means more to us than what we imagine. &gt;&gt; Now, a type foreshadows a specific historical event like Jonah was in the whale's belly like three days and three nights, right? That foreshadowed Jesus in the heart of the earth three days and three nights. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. So Jonah was a type Joseph being sold for 20 pieces of silver. That was a type of Jesus being sold for 30 pieces of silver. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Okay. So now, can we see the difference? Hallelujah. We have allegorories. They just have a hidden meaning under them. But a type foretell a future event. Therefore, Jesus's water and blood pouring out is an allegory. And here's what I didn't understand. It's an allegory of the spiritual birth of the New Testament church. &gt;&gt; But there's also it's also Jesus pouring out the water and blood is also an anti-ype which is a fulfillment of the type. That's all that means. Anti-ype is a fulfilled type. In other words, the foreshadowed event has now happened. &gt;&gt; Amen. Remember the Bible says the spirit searches the deep things. Yay. The deep things of God. God wants us to go deeper in the word of God. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; So Jesus with water and blood pouring out of both or both pouring out of his body, that was both an allegory, but it was also an anti-ype of Eve being taken from Adam's side. Now, this is the one I really struggle with. I've struggled with this. I've been in the message what, 24 years, and I've always struggled. How does Adam How does Eve take it out of Adam's side? How is that uh a type of the cross? I never understood it till yesterday. &gt;&gt; So, I hope you can understand it, too. &gt;&gt; And brother Jose, how many times did brother Ram say that? You know, he you always talked about, we'll read a quote. He always talked about how uh God taking Eve out of Adam is like God taking the church out of Christ. And brother Jose for 24 years, I just scratched my head. I don't know. But today, I got the answer. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. And it's so simple. The Bible interprets itself. The answer was already in the Bible. I just didn't see that scripture. &gt;&gt; And so, church, this this proves if you don't understand something, set it on the spiritual shelf. God will bring it down at the time you need to understand it. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Don't try to interpret it. Don't try to make it don't try to make it make sense. Just leave it there and God will bring it down at the right time. &gt;&gt; Just like God did with us with interracial marriage, ministers marriage requirements, right? All these things. uh uh the ministry of brother Brandham and the the uh the prophecies of brother Brandham because all these attacks have come on the message and all these questions just left them up on the shelf but then the right time god reveals them to us. Why? Because God is faithful. God is testing us. God wants us wants us to overcome the test. Believe in him and then God will reveal the answer in due season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Church, you got to have a test to overcome. God does not call us to a flowery bed of ease while others fought to win the prize to to sail through bloody seas. But the Ram says we're not on a picnic. He says we're soldiers in an army. So we've got to we've got to wait on God. We've got to trust God. We've got to let God fight our battles. &gt;&gt; Amen. Amen. &gt;&gt; How many will do that today? &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Say, "God, I'm battling this today." Or, "I'm going through a season of battling this, but God, I'm going to trust you. I trust in God, my savior. He's going to fight my battles." Amen. That's right. &gt;&gt; He will put all enemies under your feet. Amen. He'll crush the head of the serpent. The Bible says that. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; In the book of Romans, we looked at that on Wednesday night for the Christmas service. Yes, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; The Bible said God will shortly, the God of peace will shortly bruise Satan under your feet. &gt;&gt; That's [crying] right. &gt;&gt; But God is teaching us how to fight Satan off. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Church, say it out loud, what's the weapon God gave you to fight off Satan? &gt;&gt; The word. Amen. Good Bible- based church here. Hallelujah. The sword. You got to SPEAK THE WORD. YOU GOT TO BELIEVE THE WORD and and use the sword against Satan and he'll flee for a season. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Like Austin said, he was telling me yesterday, I'm speaking the I'm speaking life. I'm speaking life. I'm like, that's right, brother. You keep speaking life. Amen. Speak life. Speak the word. Satan can't stand the word of God. That's one thing he doesn't like is the word of God. &gt;&gt; So now we'll see this in Jesus. His water and blood was both an allegory and it was a type. Now, these are the best pictures I could find. These were the most uh holy pictures I could find. And so, we got Adam. Here's Adam sleeping, right? Eve's God's and God taking the rib and he pulls out Eve. All right. And then you got Jesus. Now, I don't know if the water and blood went like that. It depends how supernatural event. It could have it could have been like that or it could have been more natural where he just had, you know, blood come forth and then water afterwards. But now, can everybody see what I'm talking about? Brother Ram says this, this right here was a type for this. &gt;&gt; Now, for years, 24 years, I'm like, I don't understand it. I don't get it. But now I understand it. So, I hope you'll catch it here as well by God's grace. I think that's St. John, right? when there's Mary the mother because he said, "Behold your mother." Hallelujah. Now, Adam's rib type Jesus's water and blood. So, Adam's rib and being poured out. In other words, type Jesus water and blood being poured out. So, God pulled out the rib, but Jesus water and blood was poured out. &gt;&gt; So, one's pulled, one's poured. But in both cases, something is coming out of the Adam and the last Adam. Hallelujah. Amen. But Jose, I'm about ready to shout. Okay. Brother Ram said he was he was preaching. I heard brother Ram say it this week. Brother Ram was waiting to get to his his big point, right? His climax. And he said, "I feel like David. I'm winding up that sling." [laughter] That's what I feel like today, brother Jose. I'm winding up that sling and we're going to let that stone loose and IT'S GOING TO STRIKE THE HEAD OF THE ENEMY. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; In other words, I'm hoping the church will receive it. It's so simple. I hope you will receive it. So, I feel like I'm winding up. Everybody ready for this stone to strike the enemy? [laughter] Hallelujah. Adam and the last Adam. Speaking of Adam and Jesus, Adam was a type of Jesus Christ because Adam was put to sleep. Now, let's read that. Genesis 2:21. Got your Bibles? Let's read that. Genesis 2:21. Now, we'll get to the verse that actually opened up the Revelation. It was John chapter 3. But don't turn there right now. John chapter 3. Actually, I felt church. I felt like this. I felt the veil came off my eyes when I read John chapter 3. &gt;&gt; So, we'll get to that in just a little bit. Ever feel like that? You got veil over your eyes. I just can't understand it. I just can't understand it. And then God takes the veil away. &gt;&gt; John 2, I'm sorry, Genesis 2:21. And the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept. And he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof. And the rib which the Lord God had taken from man made he a bride, I mean woman, and brought her unto the man. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." Hallelujah. That's right. Now, look, church, look at these three. We're going to see these three. Sleep was first, then the side was open, and then the bride was last. &gt;&gt; Sleep, side, bride. That's a good rhyme there. Sleepside bride. Hallelujah. Now, we're not going to read these because we already read it. But Christ in John 19 was put to death or the Bible says death is only what? It's sleep, right? Paul told them in the Thessalonians, your loved ones are sleeping, right? It's called sleep. Now, their soul's not asleep. That's just another way to to show they're in a different place right now. &gt;&gt; Right? When you sleep, you're in a different place. Brother Ram says, "You're in your conscience." And boy, I don't like some of those dreams I get in my conscience. Brother Vang. I don't like to go there sometimes, but I got to go there. Hallelujah. It's like you're in a different place. Hallelujah. So, when people pass away, the Bible calls it, it's like they're sleeping. They're still somewhere, just not there. So, with Jesus, he went to sleep in death and then his side was pierced. And then comes the bride. But the bride part always stumbled me. I couldn't understand that. How is water and blood a bride? All right. So now I put I put the labels on there. Sleepside bride. Sleep or death side. And this water and blood represents the bride being purchased. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Because remember, brother Brandham said, "God has to God has to redeem this earth the same way he redeems you." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. How did God How is God going to redeem the earth? He had to have the water of Noah's flood. That's the water, the blood of Jesus. So, here's the blood. And then the fire has to burn over the whole earth. And then God has redeemed us. &gt;&gt; I'm sorry, the earth. And brother Ram said that's the same thing for you. Justification, you're baptized in water. Sanctified through the blood or the Holy Spirit. Sanctification and then the fire of the Holy Ghost. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. See that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Water, blood, spirit. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Justification, sanctification, baptism of the Holy Ghost. Oh, I'm still I'm still getting that sling around here. [laughter] Hopefully, it'll strike by God's grace. Maybe this will be a silent striking. I thought it might make you shout. Amen. [laughter] Maybe to go to John chapter 3. I'll just read it now. Then you got it. John 3. I trust it'll bless you like it blessed me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Remember uh in verse John 3:3, Jesus answered unto him and saith, verily, verily I say unto thee, except a man be born again, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus saith to him, "How can a man be born when he's old? Can he enter the second time into his mother's womb and be born?" Right? That's that's as spiritual as we could be without the Holy Ghost. &gt;&gt; What do you mean born again? I got to go inside my mom again. She's 75 years old to be born again. How is that going to work? But Jesus was always talking on a higher level than everybody else. Why? Because he came from God. He come down to earth. He went back to God. Hallelujah. Amen. &gt;&gt; And then verse five, here's the one that church and open up with this verse. So here it's slinging now. Let me let me hit the hit the mark. Jesus answered, "Verily, verily, I say unto you, except a man be born of water and of the &gt;&gt; he cannot enter into the kingdom of God." Hallelujah. There it is. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, that which is born of the spirit is spirit. Marvel not that I say unto you, ye must be born again. Hallelujah. The wind bloweth where it list, and thou hearest the sound thereof, but can not tell when it cometh, and whence it go whether it goeth. So is everyone that is born of the spirit of God. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; See, so Jesus says, "You've got to be born of the water and the spirit." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Is that right? Amen. &gt;&gt; Oh, it's so beautiful. So now we can see that this water and blood represents a baby being born &gt;&gt; because a baby is born by water, blood, spirit. Ah, so see now I know a bride came out of Adam. So a bride must come out of the last. In other words, God symbolizing a birth is going to happen here. &gt;&gt; Amen. I got water, blood, spirit. There's got to be a birth somewhere. Hallelujah. Amen. And so it was in the spiritual realm. A birth was going to take place because there's water, blood, and Jesus dismissed his spirit. &gt;&gt; Amen. Here's where brother says it, church. Hallelujah. And to think just as sure as God raised Jesus out of the grave, sitting at his right hand tonight, making intercession upon our confessions, that same God has promised, he swore by this covenant. How many under the covenant of the blood of Christ? &gt;&gt; That we that are in Christ Jesus, born into that body, shall come forth in that body to be his bride. So Jesus promised, "You will be my bride." &gt;&gt; Amen. Just like Eve was the bride of Adam, we'll be the bride of the last Adam. Hallelujah. And as God taken from Adam a rib and made Eve out of it, he taken from the sight of Christ and made the church out of it. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So the water and blood was poured out upon the earth. Hallelujah. And how many know our bodies came from the earth? &gt;&gt; That's right. Amen. The Bible said from dust you came and dust you'll return. Uh-huh. &gt;&gt; So, the water and blood spilled on the dust where the bride would come from. Your bodies would be made from that dust. And so, the water Amen. The water's been poured on your body. The blood's been poured on your body. Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. And God's going to redeem this body. And God's GOING TO GIVE YOU A GLORIFIED BODY. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. That's right. &gt;&gt; Oh my. Hallelujah. And we together will walk in the paradise of God someday. How many want to do that? &gt;&gt; Amen. Brother Brandham says, "We'll walk with the lions and the lambs as well." The the he called it uh he called the the female lionist Sheba. He said, "We'll walk with the l the lions again and just kind of pat their back and rub them. We'll walk in the paradise of God." Church, it is not entered into man's eyes or or thoughts what God has prepared for them that love him. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. Amen. Oh, there's so many wonderful things coming. The thing to do, just stay in Christ. &gt;&gt; Just make sure your life is hidden in Jesus Christ, brother Michelle. Hallelujah. Amen. Just make sure, SISTER ANNA, YOUR LIFE IS HIDDEN IN JESUS. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; In other words, DON'T TRUST IN YOURSELF. DON'T TRUST IN WORKS. DON'T TRUST IN WHAT you can do. Trust in the blood and the water of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; That's what I'm doing today. Yeah. Amen. &gt;&gt; Won't that be wonderful, church? And you won't have stomach trouble there. He's actually in a prayer line. And you and you haven't got it anymore. Now go eat what you want. You had ulcers in the stomach and they're gone. Eat anything you want, mother. Your faith has made you well. Let's say praise the Lord. Let's say praise the Lord. Let's praise the Lord. Amen. So, brother Ram is discerning this woman, the prayer line. He uses Adam and Eve for Christ and the church. And then God heals the woman's sto stomach trouble. Praise God. Now let's look at the allegorories. Here's the allegory. And this was the verse that hit the giant's head where I couldn't understand this for so long. And that stone of revelation struck the uh it struck the giant that was in my life withholding this revelation we'd say, from me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Now, allegory, remember, allegory has a hidden meaning. So this is why brother Ram said what he said because water and blood represent a natural birth but Jesus shed the water and blood for a spiritual birth. This was the allegory. Hallelujah. The hidden meaning of water and blood is to show something's being born. A bride. A bride is being born out of the last Adam. &gt;&gt; Oh hallelujah. Praise God. Thank you Jesus. Except a man be born of water in the spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God. &gt;&gt; What do you mean? What water are you talking about? He's talking about the water that came out of his body. Hallelujah. Now, you can also use water baptism. That's fine. It still fits, church. &gt;&gt; But the allegory here is that there was a greater meaning on the cross. water, blood, spirit, hallelujah, justification, sanctification, BAPTISM OF THE HOLY GHOST THAT PUTS YOU BACK IN THE BODY OF CHRIST. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH, thank God. Amen. &gt;&gt; Now, go to Ephesians 5:25. Maybe I'll make a YouTube video about this just to share it. said. Now, maybe everybody else understood this before me. That's fine. But I'm glad God revealed it to me. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; God speaking an allegory. There's a hidden meaning. The blood and water represented uh the spiritual birth. A birth is happening. Life is happening. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; And it spoke of the church being born again, the church being created. The church was birthed right there. Amen. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; It wasn't at church 50 days later. than the church actually received that new birth on the day of Pentecost. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So church, this is why people would say we were born at the cross. That's why preachers will say uh you were born at the cross. The cross was your birthday. Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Because that a birth took place. &gt;&gt; Yeah. &gt;&gt; As Eve came out of Adam, the bride CAME OUT OF CHRIST. AMEN. &gt;&gt; A birth took place. Water, blood, spirit. The spiritual bride was born that day. Amen. &gt;&gt; I hope you can see it today. If not, go listen to this again tonight by God's grace. I think you'll catch it. &gt;&gt; Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave himself for. The proof God loves you is that Jesus died for you. Amen. &gt;&gt; Well, show me some proof, brother Jeff. Show me some proof. Now, don't get angry with God. Look at the cross. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; The cross proves God loves each and every one of you. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Look to Jesus, his death. Look to his resurrection, his death, and the shedding of his blood. That a sorry, aphixiation. Hallelujah. The severe HEART TROUBLE THAT PROVED HE LOVED YOU. HE SUFFERED so you wouldn't have to suffer. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; And see, you're either going to believe the devil or God. Let's believe God's word. &gt;&gt; Either one of them's lying. Well, we know it ain't God. So, tell the devil, "Get behind me, Satan. I'm going to believe the word of God. &gt;&gt; I was purchased at the cross. My new birth actually happened at the cross. I just learned about it 2,000 years later." Amen. Hallelujah. That's where God laid the foundation for the church to be born. &gt;&gt; Verse 26. that he might sanctify it and cleansing it with the washing of the what? Water. Water. Jesus sanctified and cleansed you with the water of the word. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; The word, the water was like word. So when you hear the word today, and it told me, remember I had hair down here, brother Arley. I had hair down here when I heard the message. The word said a man shouldn't have long hair. So I cut it right there. I was washed by the word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. Some of you sisters had paint all over your face. But then you heard, "Oh, painting is a heathen trait. It's of the devil. It's a Jezebel." And then you went and wiped the the paint off your face. You just got washed by the waters of the word. I hope a sister could say amen to that. Hallelujah. Praise God. That's the washing of the water. God's cleansing you. He's washing you to be what he WANTS YOU TO BE. HE WANTS YOU TO BE CLEAN. HALLELUJAH. Thank you, Jesus. Now, why does he wash you, church? Because there's going to come a presentation of the bride of Jesus Christ. Look at verse 27. That he might present it to himself a glorious church, not having spot or wrinkle or any such thing, but that it should be holy and without blemish. Church, when the word washes you, you don't have any faults in God's sight. You don't have any sins. When Jesus takes his water and washes you, boy, I wish I would have brought a towel or something like that. A wet towel. Maybe next time I'll do that. I'll get a wet towel. I'll soak it right in front of you. And then maybe I'll bring up Malachi. Let's say he's got dirt on his hands. And I'll just wash it. Make sure it's all clean. I know he gets dirty hands at work. Those are pretty clean by God's grace. And then I could present. Now I can present it. Look, now it's clean. Well, that's what Jesus did to you. &gt;&gt; You hear his word, you repent, you obey it, NOW YOU'RE CLEAN. YOU'RE NOT DIRTY, YOU'RE CLEAN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And if Jesus washes something, Brother Patrick, it's going to be clean because Jesus doesn't do a halfway job. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; He doesn't do a partial cleaning. He cleans you all the WAY TILL YOU'RE SPOTLESS, HOLY, AND THERE'S NO BLEMISH IN YOU. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. Praise God. Now, these water and blood have certain jobs that they do, we'll say, or there's a purpose for blood. Blood is for atonement, which means to restore harmony or bring us back to one. Now, all you children, all you children know this, and you adults, too. If your child disobys you and they don't repent, what what is it? There's anger between you two, right? There's something. I can't believe my my daughter or my son did that. They need to repent of that. But as soon as they say they're sorry, what happens? Now I can forgive you. Now I can't trust you all the time, but you are forgiven. You said sorry. Hallelujah. Well, see, before when you when the when the child sinned, now there's there's not oneness. The harmony is broken. But as soon as they repent, now the harmony is restored. &gt;&gt; Now we're one again. And the Bible said the blood was for your atonement. The blood restored harmony. So church, you should have harmony with God TODAY BECAUSE JESUS POURED OUT HIS BLOOD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; That brings you back into harmony. You don't have to worry. Well, God, do you care about me? Do you love me? Are you my friend? Of course, the blood brought atonement. &gt;&gt; Look at the look at the Hebrew word here for atonement. You can look. This is as Exodus 3:10. Church, what did the blood of Jesus do for you? It covered your sins. It purged your sins. It brought harmony. It made reconciliation. Now you and your father are made up. Everything's right between you and your father. To cover over with pitch, to coat, to cover, to pacify. God's no longer angry with you. Propituate means to take wrath. Jesus took the wrath of God against you. God's not angry with you. &gt;&gt; That's what the blood did. The blood brought atonement. The blood brought reconciliation. The blood gave you harmony with God. You are a friend of God. &gt;&gt; Jesus blood atoned for your sins. &gt;&gt; Now, here's what the word water uh no, I'm sorry, it's the word cleansing. Numbers 8:7 says the water cleanses you. So the word cleanse means to make you pure. You're pure in God's sight. It means you're clean morally. In other words, God knows you want to do what's right. Your desire is to do what's right. Now you got to fight against the flesh 247 or maybe 16 out of 16 out of seven. 16 hours out of seven days a week when you're awake. But look what Jesus did. He made you clean morally. GOD LOOKS AT YOUR HEART. God sees your desires to serve him. &gt;&gt; God has purified you physically, ceremonial, ceremonially and morally. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Thank you for your amens." So church, the blood has atoned you. The water has washed you. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; I was hoping people would leave here happy today by God's grace. Amen. Hallelujah. This is WHAT JESUS DID. JUST LIKE EVE. JUST like Eve was pulled out. When she pulled out, was she dirty when she was pulled out? No. She was perfect. SHE WAS CLEAN. SO ARE YOU WHEN YOU WERE PULLED OUT OF CHRIST? YOU'RE PERFECT AND CLEAN. You have the atonement. The blood and water has washed you and made you clean. &gt;&gt; No wonder Jesus said, "It is finished." Hallelujah. What does the word finish mean? It means to accomplish, fulfill, pay for. It is paid for. It is performed. Sin is expired. Amen. Hallelujah. To bring to a close, to finish, to end, pass, finish. Jesus says it is ended. The sin question is ended. The church is no longer guilty for our sins. Jesus paid it all. Jesus took our sins. Our sin question is settled. Look what it means when he said it's finished. It's performed. It's executed. It's complete. Your salvation is complete. &gt;&gt; Your promise TO WALK IN PARADISE WITH GOD IS COMPLETE. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. Jesus carried out the commands of God. Hallelujah. He did just as he was commanded. He performed the last act which completed a process to accomplish and fulfill. Jesus was the lamb of God. And what did he do with your sins? What? The lamb of God who takes away what? All the sins. Let's say all the sins. Ready? All the sins of the world. Jesus finished it. THEY'RE ALL TAKEN AWAY. YOU ARE FORGIVEN. YOU'RE CLEAN. YOU'RE HOLY. YOU'RE WITHOUT BLEMISH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. This is good to me. Praise God. Amen. It also means to pay for. It is finished. It is paid. &gt;&gt; Christ has satisfied or pacified God's justice by dying for all the sins of the saints. These sins can never let's say never &gt;&gt; be punished again since that would violate God's justice. God's law says punishment is paid then forgiveness occurs. God doesn't have to punish us for our sins because Jesus already paid for the punishment. Jesus was punished so we didn't have to be. &gt;&gt; And I love this church. This opened up to me while I was studying, too. Hallelujah. NOT ONLY JESUS'S SIDE WASN'T the only thing that was opened up at the cross. &gt;&gt; Now, let's let's stop a moment. Why was it opened up? So Jesus could pull so God could pull out a bride. So Jesus would open up. Jesus side was opened up so God could access the bride. ADAM'S SIDE WAS OPENED UP SO GOD could create a bride. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. Get ready for this. Maybe this is the slingshot. Amen. Not only did God open up the Jesus side for that. Hallelujah. When Jesus SIDE WAS OPENED UP, God gave us access TO ETERNAL LIFE. &gt;&gt; BLOOD and water paid for our sins. NOW YOU CAN LIVE ETERNALLY. &gt;&gt; Not only was Jesus opened up, Brother Andy, BUT THE VEIL WAS OPENED UP AND NOW YOU'VE GOT ACCESS TO GOD'S PRESENCE. HALLELUJAH. AH, NOT ONLY WAS THE VEIL OPEN, ABRAHAM'S BOSOM WAS OPEN, WHICH GIVES US ACCESS TO HEAVEN. HALLELUJAH. AND NOT ONLY WAS THAT OPEN, THE EARTH WAS OPEN. THAT GAVE THE SAINTS ACCESS TO JERUSALEM. HALLELUJAH. AND THE LAST THING WAS THE GRAVES WERE OPEN. THAT GAVE US ACCESS TO GLORIFIED BODIES CUZ THE GLORIFIED BODIES WALKED OUT OF THOSE GRAVES. That's right. &gt;&gt; And the church said, &gt;&gt; "OH, AMEN." BROTHER JOSE, DID THAT HIT THE MARK? HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; OH MY CHURCH, EVERYTHING IS OPEN. HEAVEN'S OPEN. THE HOLY GHOST IS OPEN. YOUR FUTURE IS OPEN. ETERNAL LIFE IS OPEN. THE [screaming] DOOR'S NOT CLOSED. CHRIST IS THE OPEN DOOR. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. AMEN. &gt;&gt; AMEN. ALL BECAUSE JESUS WAS OPEN ON THE CROSS AND THAT PURCHASED YOUR SPIRITUAL BIRTH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I FEEL LIKE PREACHING NOW, BROTHER CLAUDE. AMEN. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Oh my. The church was born at the cross. [screaming] Hallelujah. She was sanctified and cleansed with the washing of the water by brother Ram says by the creed. &gt;&gt; No, by the word. HALLELUJAH. NOT NOT THE AMISH CREED, NOT THE PENTECOSTAL CREED, not the creed of Jeffersonville or some other creed, BUT WE ARE WASHED by the water OF THE HOLY PROMISES OF GOD. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; And church, this is so beautiful. In the millennium, this flowing out of God, of Jesus, the water and blood, it'll be symbolized. I'll say like this, it'll be an allegory. Hallelujah. BECAUSE THE BIBLE SAID EZEKIEL 47:1, let's read it. Remember, Brother says, "Any Bible student knows from Ezekiel 40 through 48 is to the Jewish people during the millennium." I thought, "Well, I didn't know that till you told me, Brother Brandham. I much am not much of a Bible student, but I'm glad I got a Bible prophet." That's right. Amen. Ezekiel 47. Oh my. Thank you, Lord. So, also the water and blood flowing out was a symbol. Oh, there's another one in Genesis or Revelation 22. That's right. I missed that one. Afterward, he brought me again unto the door of the house. And behold, what issued out of the house? &gt;&gt; Water. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "So God's house during the millennium in Jerusalem, the Bible said a a mountain will raise up and then the millennial temple will be built on top of that. And Jesus will be the holy one sitting in that temple." Hallelujah. With the rod of iron, ruling nations for a thousand years. AND WHAT FLOWS OUT OF THAT TEMPLE? WATER. HALLELUJAH. Because cleansing flows out of the Savior. Because a birth came out of the Savior. A bride came OUT OF THE SAVIOR. IN OTHER WORDS, WHERE DID YOU COME FROM? YOU CAME FROM THE MIND OF CHRIST. AND THE WATER OF AND blood proves that the bride came out of Adam. You came out of the mind of Christ. &gt;&gt; You were chosen in Christ before the foundation of the world. Just like the water and blood came out. Your promised birth was poured out as well. &gt;&gt; Oh my my. This is just mind-blowing. Amen. Hallelujah. Behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward. For the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and waters came down from the under from the right side of the house at the south side of the altar. So, brother Patrick, during the millennium, you and I will walk up around there. We got our glorified bodies. We'll walk around all day. We we give our orders. You know, we'll be ruling over cities. We'll give our orders. We'll take a break, brother Patrick. We'll walk by. Oh my. And then we'll walk by the the temple and we'll see the waters and say, "Oh, look, brother." You'll say, "Look, Brother Jesse, remember when you preached that?" The water and blood. Remember when you preached that, Brother Jesse? Here it is. This water represents when Jesus shed his blood and water on the cross. &gt;&gt; This represents a birth took place at the cross. This represents life only flows OUT OF THE SON OF GOD. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; And I'll say, "That's right, brother. I did preach that." &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. [laughter] Oh, thank God. You remind me of that, Brother Patrick. Okay. When we get to the millennial, Hallelujah. Because I'll forget. No doubt about it. Now, go to Revelation 22. I just thought of this one. Glory. Yes. 22:1. And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and a lamb. And the church said, [laughter] "Thank you, Jesus." Amen. So on the cross, water and blood came out to show us and is going to show US THROUGH ALL ETERNITY THAT LIFE ONLY FLOWS OUT OF CHRIST, THE LAST ADAM. BUT YOU CAME OUT OF THE LAST ADAM AS WELL. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; The last Adam had to shed his water and blood so you could be born. &gt;&gt; Life only comes out of the son of God. &gt;&gt; It don't come out of a denomination. It don't come out of a preacher. &gt;&gt; It don't come out of me. It comes out of God Almighty. &gt;&gt; And who is God Almighty? Who's his image? Jesus Christ, his son. For he's the image of the invisible God. So if you got Jesus, you got it all. AMEN. HALLELUJAH. THANK GOD FOR JESUS CHRIST. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; WELL, I just caught that one. I just Let me add that one real quick because I might preach that down in Junction City. Hallelujah. Let me add that in there. I feel like this is a sermon I could preach at other churches and they would enjoy it, too. Just like you're enjoying it, &gt;&gt; sir. &gt;&gt; I'm almost done. I'm almost done. Really? I'm almost done. It's hard to believe. How long have I have I been preaching? Just make everybody feel good. Has it been even an hour? Okay. I didn't think so. It didn't It just seemed like a long sermon to me by God's grace. I want to hear these testimonies. These brothers have some such beautiful testimonies of the grace of God. Now, now church, now that we see the cross, the water and blood, it brings atonement and cleansing. And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Amen." &gt;&gt; Blood makes you one with God again. It restores your relationship with God. The water washes away and makes you holy. &gt;&gt; Everybody see that? &gt;&gt; Now, through those, now we can better understand why we do the three ordinances. What are the three ordinance? Brother Ram said God left for the church. Water baptism, feet washing, and communion. Now in these three, we both see the water, blood, and spirit. Hallelujah. We see the water of course with water, baptism, feet washing, cleansing. Let's say cleansing. Ready? Cleansing. See, when you wash your brother's feet, it shows that God cleansed him. And when he washes your feet, God cleansed you. &gt;&gt; I'll say like this. He cleansed your very steps. When brother Vang walks in that factory every day, God has cleansed his steps so he can walk in there and be a witness and a testimony. All those job sites are on your farm, Brother Arley. When your feet get washed, it's a reminder God has cleansed. The footsteps of the righteous are order of the Lord. [laughter] AMEN. HALLELUJAH. GOD KNEW YOUR STEPS. GOD KNOWS WHO YOU'RE GOING TO COME COME IN CONTACT WITH AND TRY TO GIVE eternal life. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Amen. I didn't know I was going to preach like this. Amen. And then the communion, the wine represents the blood because he said, "Drink my blood." But he didn't mean natural blood. He meant drink the Holy Spirit in. And of course, the bread. That's the broken body of our Lord. So even the broken body, there's the cleft of the rock. There it is. And the church said, "I just see it now. I didn't see that till it's the broken body." Yes. Let me add that too. Now, if more things break open, guess what? On Wednesday, you're going to hear a part two. Praise God. The water, the blood, there came forth water and blood. So, see, church, now we can see. We can see water, blood, and cleft in all these things that we do. &gt;&gt; So, church, I hope it means more to us now. May God help us. We're going to have communion. Remember, was it January 11th? In two Sundays, we're have communion. Maybe I'll if Lord help me, I'm going to bring this up. Maybe I'll preach preach that again by God's grace. Just to remind you all of all these things we do is to show that the water has made you clean and you don't have to worry about your sins. Just confess them. &gt;&gt; And the blood has made you the friend of God where you can talk to God anytime. &gt;&gt; Pray without what? Pray without ceasing. You talk to God anytime. Simon brought out a good verse. Um, let's let's hit that since I got it here. Uh, let's go to Proverbs where the righteous man fallth. I thought it was very inspired. Paul is seven times now. Can't find it. Can you help me find that righteous fall? Why is it not coming? Simon read you last week. I didn't write down the verse. Thank you for your patience here. There it is. Just It's not a righteous man. It's a just man. Sorry. Proverbs 24:16. Thank you for your patience, church. Proverbs 24:16, for a just man fallth how many times? What does seven represent? Completion. So you can have a complete failure. And the church said, you can completely fail and still be just. HOW CAN YOU BE JUST? BECAUSE JESUS PAID MY DEBT. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; I'm not saved BY MY WORKS. I'M SAVED BY THE WATER and the blood and the spirit. &gt;&gt; AH, I HOPE somebody can say amen today. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. A just man falls seven times and does he lay down and whine and cry about it? DOES HE GET DEPRESSED ABOUT IT? &gt;&gt; You might for a season, but then you better get up. &gt;&gt; Church, look at your neighbor and say, "I'm getting up. I'm getting up. I'm not going to lay down. I'm going to rise UP." YOU KNOW WHY? BECAUSE JESUS, MY SAVIOR, ROSE UP. &gt;&gt; I WON'T STAY DOWN. I WON'T STAY DISCOURAGED. I WON'T SAY DEFEATED. THE WOMAN'S SEED HAS ALREADY DEFEATED. DEATH, HELL, AND THE SERPENT SEED. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; GLORY. The serpent seed's already been put under your feet by the water and the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; I love what Simon said. Uh it doesn't say how often he's fell. Do you fall seven times in a day, seven times in a year? Oh, mercy at least every day. &gt;&gt; We better trust in the mercy of God. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But now let's go to I think it's the book of Luke. Yeah. Luke 17:4. I thought of that because remember Jesus asked Peter, "How many times should I forgive brother Mercy?" Seven times. Is that good, Lord? Seven enough? Jesus expanded it. Jesus brought out the spiritual multiplication. No, seven times 70. In other words, give your brothers a lot more grace than what you think they need. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; You know why? Because you sin against God a lot. &gt;&gt; That's right. And church, uh, brother Claude, could you read that? It's Proverbs. No, I'm sorry. It's Luke 17 17 3 and 4. Did you have it, brother? It's okay if you don't. Luke 17 3 and 4. I thought you had it. My fault. Luke 17. He's a fast one. Good job. Can you read three and four? 17 3 and 4. Yep. 42. Thank you, brother. All right, give our blood two claps there. Great job. So, Simon, as I brought that out, uh, does that mean seven times in an hour? We don't know. But here we got scripture in Luke 17. If it's seven times in one day, forgive. So if you sin against God seven times in a day, say, "I know there's grace for me because Jesus asked me to forgive my brother seven times a day." And Jesus has way more forgiveness than what I have for my brother. And then Jesus, then you get the other verse, the other parallel passage WHERE HE SAYS 70 TIMES SEVEN. &gt;&gt; And the church said &gt;&gt; that's the blood of Jesus Christ that we we trust in. That's the grace of God that we trust in. Don't let the devil beat you up and say, "You've done too much. Bring out the 70 times seven." &gt;&gt; There's no way, brother Arley, I sinned 490 times today against God. There's no way. Right? And Jesus said he'd forgive me if I did it. [laughter] AMEN. WHY? BECAUSE THE WATER AND BLOOD WAS PERFECT CLEANSING, PERFECT WASHING, PERFECT ATONEMENT. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; AMEN. AMEN. &gt;&gt; SO, I thought I'd give a little extra revelation on that. You got at least seven times a sin against your brother. And now look at that. You can take and rebuke your brother, too. So I can say, "Shame on you, brother so and so. YOU SHOULD NOT HAVE SAID THAT ABOUT ME, but I forgive you anyway." And the church said, &gt;&gt; "You can rebuke them." I've only had one person ever ask for rebuking because they sinned against me. They uh gossiped about me and then called me that very day to tell me about it. And I said, "No, I'm not going to rebuke you. Just go tell the man you're that you uh should not have gossiped about me and said that about me." I don't know if he did, but there was only one time a brother asked me, "Go ahead and rebuke me." And I didn't do it because he was already rebuked by the Holy Ghost. The church said, "I don't want to make myself and say, well, let me get my righteous indignation. Yes, I'm going to rebuke you, you heathen, you devil worshiper, you Satan serpent sees, I wasn't EVEN GOING TO GET CLOSE TO THAT." &gt;&gt; The Holy Ghost has already rebuked you. Just go make it right. And don't lie. Don't Don't tattletail. Don't backbite people. Don't talk about them behind their backs, but I forgive you. And church, I did forgive. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. But now look through the scripture. You got seven chances to fall. At least seven in a day. And then Jesus multiplies that, you at least got 490. [laughter] Oh, hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That makes me Well, let's just read the other one just so you got it. 70 times 7. All right. Matthew 18:22. Brother uh Patrick, would you get that for me? Matthew 18:22. I told these young brothers, I said, "I appreciate our young brothers. God might make you song leader someday. Uh trustees, deacons, God might call them to preach." So, I want them to know the word of God. Hallelujah. Right, Michelle? God might have a call on your life, brother. You just, the Bible says, wait upon the Lord. Then God will lead you. Wait on your ministering. Wait on your preaching. Wait on it. Wait till God opens it up to you. The Bible said a man's gift will make room to himself. I could sure use some help preaching. Hallelujah. I could sure use some help song leading. Hallelujah. But God will do it in God's time. Now, what I say, Matthew 18, uh, read 21 and 22. Uh, Brother Patrick. Amen. Let's give him two class. Great reading, brother. In one day, what? God will forgive me more than seven times. The complete number. Yes. 70 times seven. But church, the main thing is don't give up. Don't quit on God. Don't let the devil convince you that God's against you. God is for you. You came out of the mind of Christ. Hallelujah. You were pulled out of the bridegroom because you're the bride. Oh, thank God. Amen. Now, go to Hebrews 10. Brother Arley, can you read this for me? Hebrews 10, brother. Uh now, brother Arley, if you would, let's read uh read verse 10 for me, brother. Hebrews 10:10. Now, listen carefully to what brother Artley's going to read here. Go, brother, whenever you're ready. Let's say once for all. Ready? once for all. Wait, wait. Now, does Jesus have to go back and die again? To sanctify us. Remember what sanctify means? It means set apart. So, through one sacrifice on the cross, let me go back there. I don't see I don't know. I don't know if Naomi saw that picture. By one sacrifice on the cross, it sanctified you once for all. Not to the next revival, not to the next uh shouting and and and rejoicing and weeping and crying experience. Once and for all, you're set apart because Jesus shed the water and the blood. Hallelujah. Is that right? See, church, that's what we need to remember. Tell the devil, I'm I'm I'm sanctified once and for all. Even communion doesn't save you. Brother Ram said, "You're not saved by communion. You're saved by faith in the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; But communion does keep you clean." And the church said, "That's right. It keeps you clean in your daily walk." But in heaven, all your sins are paid for. Amen. And you just realize now, just think of this. I just realized this week that this was speaking of my birth because water and blood came out. Now I can be born of God as well. Hallelujah. Just as a bride came out of the first Adam, a bride, a birth had to happen out of the last Adam. &gt;&gt; Now say in Hebrews 10, I'm gonna read there from brother Arly. Let's all read verse 14. Everybody got your Bible? Hebrews 10:14. If you got it, let's read it. If not, no problem. One, two, three. For by one offering he hath perfected forever them that are sanctified. How long are you set apart for? Forever. Let's say forever. Ready? &gt;&gt; Not to the next revival. No. No. Forever. Brother Andy. Forever. Brother. That's quite a word. When God says forever, that actually means eternal. Jo Jonah said, "I was forever in the whale." Whenever. But that's speak That's not speaking of God. That's speaking of an experience. So that forever doesn't mean forever like eternally. But when you talk about God forever, that's eternal. &gt;&gt; Amen. So I am set apart for God eternally. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; BY ONE SACRIFICE BY ONE ACT ON THE CROSS. IT IS FINISHED. GOD GOD HAS FINISHED THE CASE for Jesse Smith and Bride OF CHRIST FELLOWSHIP. THE BLOOD HAS been been shed. The water's BEEN SHED. THE ATONEMENT IS FINISHED. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; HALLELUJAH. NO MAN CAN TAKE ME AWAY. NOBODY PUT ME IN THE CHURCH. NOBODY CAN TAKE ME OUT OF THE CHURCH. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; JESUS PUT ME IN HIM. [screaming] IT IS MINE BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD. SO WHO CAN TAKE ME OUT? NOBODY CAN TAKE ME OUT. &gt;&gt; You can't me put You can't put me out of the message. You can't put me out of Christianity. You can't put me out of the rapture. If Jesus PUT ME IN, NOBODY CAN TAKE ME OUT. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; Because that's where I CAME FROM. I CAME from the raptured one, Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Ah, verse 17. And their sins and iniquities will I remember every Sunday. Is that what he said? No. I put the wrong thing in there so you would get the point. I'm trying to make a point. Brother Random said, "I'm being a little rational, but I'm trying to make a point. I'm being a little rational." Sometimes we think say or God's mad at us every Sunday. The Bible says their sins and iniquities I won't remember no more. No more will he remember our sins. Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Praise God. or your iniquities. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Just confess them TO GOD. KEEP WALKING WITH GOD. HE'S your father. &gt;&gt; You're his son. You're his daughter. &gt;&gt; He purchased you. He birthed you. Praise God. YOU'RE A PART OF CHRIST. YOU'RE FOREVER IN THE ROCK OF AGES. &gt;&gt; Not going to have much voice left for the evening. Amen. &gt;&gt; Ah. Oh. So now verse 19. Now we can have boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood. Oh, by the blood. So this represented your birth and also this represents the blood that you go with before God in prayer. That means God hears my prayer. Let's say God hears my prayer. Ready? God hears. Patrick, I love how you're smiling, buddy. This is make this is encouraging me, buddy. If he could catch it, you're 17, brother. If this can put a smile on a 17 year old's face, WHAT CAN IT DO TO A 45 YEAR OLD MAN LIKE MYSELF? HALLELUJAH. OH, TO MAKE ME SHOUT, MAKE ME REJOICE THAT I WAS IN CHRIST. I CAME OUT OF CHRIST, AND I'LL GO BACK TO CHRIST. &gt;&gt; And the BLOOD THAT HE SHED SHOWED I'D BE BORN, I'd have atonement with Jesus Christ, and that THAT MY PRAYERS CAN GO TO HIM IN HEAVEN. HALLELUJAH. &gt;&gt; [laughter] &gt;&gt; Oh my. The sins I used to do, I do them no more. &gt;&gt; Oh, thank you, Jesus. Amen. &gt;&gt; The blood has cleansed me. The waters washed me. Hallelujah. And I am the friend of God. [laughter] Thank you, Jesus. Oh my. I was preached longer than I thought. Now, we only have three physical divine orders left. One of them is communion, feet, washing, water, baptism. That's the only three things. That's the perfection of the three. See? So this is perfection. Water baptism, feet, wash, and communion. That's perfection because you've got the water, the blood, the spirit. Hallelujah. And you've got the cleft side of Jesus Christ. The bread was broken. The broke. Next time I I I break that, I'll think of that. He was cle for me. He was broken like the rock was broken so that the believer can get in and hide in Jesus Christ. That was the perfection of the church. We realize that. Yes, we do. Brother, now I realize that after 24 years. Now I realize why brother said God had to get a bride at the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. I never understood it till yesterday. That's the only three orders we have left. We realize that was the issue given by St. Paul in the New Testament. So friends, check this out. Now I could do this through the entire Bible. Almost every Old Testament victory story has water and blood in it. Think of even Noah. What came? Water, right? And then the blood they as soon as he got out killed all those animals. Almost every story speaks of water, blood, spirit, justification, sanctification, the baptism of the Holy Ghost. But what happened in the Exodus? First, the blood was shed, right? The hissup was dipped in the blood, put over the the three parts of the door there, the door and the lentil. So, you have blood and God brought them through the Red Sea symbolized water. And then, church, they were free. And then God, what does God do? God said, "Build me a sanctuary so that I can dwell them. Give me a temple because I want to dwell amongst them." &gt;&gt; Water, blood, spirit dwelling with the people. &gt;&gt; And the church said, &gt;&gt; "Church, you're free this morning if you'll accept it." Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; Jesus blood was our Passover lamb. &gt;&gt; Amen. And then Jesus commands every one of you to be baptized in the water of the water baptism and you shall receive the promise of the Holy Spirit. Amen. &gt;&gt; But look, they were already free after the water baptism. So you might say, "Well, I don't have the baptism of THE HOLY GHOST." YOU'RE ALREADY FREE. &gt;&gt; You're not a slave IN EGYPT ANYMORE. YOU'RE SET FREE. &gt;&gt; AMEN. &gt;&gt; And then the Holy Ghost, Paul said, God has made your body as a temple for the Holy Ghost. Know you not that your body is a temple of the Holy Ghost? &gt;&gt; Then Paul said, "It's Christ in you. You're the temple. You're the tabernacle. You're God's house he wants TO LIVE IN. NOW IT'S CHRIST IN YOU, the hope of glory." &gt;&gt; That's right, sir. &gt;&gt; You are free in Jesus Christ's name. &gt;&gt; Amen. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; I'm almost done. Keep saying that. You want to hear a long sermon? Go listen to spoken word original seed there. I haven't preached half that. Now, now church, we can understand this. This is he that came by water and blood. Even Jesus Christ. Now look at this. Not water only. He just didn't cleanse you, church. But the blood brought you atonement. You're just not You're more than just clean. So you can be clean but not have the relationship with God. &gt;&gt; But John says you've got the water and the blood. &gt;&gt; And he says it's the spirit that bears witness because the spirit is truth. &gt;&gt; For there there are three that bear record in heaven. The father, the word, and the holy ghost. These three are one. These uh trinitarians I've talked to the last year, they're like, "Doesn't that verse struggle you?" I'm like, "Not a bit." It doesn't say these three persons are one. It just says these three are one. And if you look closely, they're all spiritual. Right? Father is a spirit. Holy Ghost is a spirit. It don't say son. It says word. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; So those three spiritual attributes of God, those three manifestations of God, they're actually one. Hallelujah. It doesn't say the old man father and the young man's son and the third person dove are three are three persons. It don't say that. &gt;&gt; And the church said &gt;&gt; don't let those liars add to the Bible. &gt;&gt; Now some of them are purposely lying because they're anointed by devils and the antichrist spirit. Some of them just some of them are just ignorantly lying and they'll repent of it eventually. &gt;&gt; Any true child of God will repent for lying about God's word and adding to the word of God. I know that's rough, but that's the truth. That's true. Because Satan wants to get in there, remember? And he wants to create three different gods. And now the Christians become polytheists, &gt;&gt; worshiping three gods. Which one do I pray to? I don't know. I've had friends tell me that over the years, I don't know which one to pray to. Oh, there's only one to pray to. Hallelujah. God's only one person. Hallelujah. You don't got to divide your time in thirds. Well, I'll do 10 minutes for the father, 10 minutes for the son, 10 minutes for the holy ghost, then I'm good. Oh, then 10 minutes to marry, too. You blind hypocrite. Adding to the word of God. This actually makes our case for God as one person. &gt;&gt; It doesn't hurt our case. It helps us. That's why I love it. Now, there are three that bear witness in the earth. The spirit, the water, and the blood. And these three agree. Notice it doesn't say they are one. Brother says they agree in one because all three have a different work, don't they? What does the water do? It cleans you out. What does the blood blood do? The blood gives you reconciliation or gives you harmony with God, friendship with God. And what does the spirit do? The spirit fills you. Fills your soul. Is this helping today? For if we receive the w and remember who's the one that wrote this? John was the one. He saw the water and blood come down. And that's why he says verse nine, if we receive the witness of men, the witness of God is greater. &gt;&gt; In other words, if you believe me about the water, blood, spirit, then surely you believe God about the father, the word, and the holy ghost. &gt;&gt; Hallelujah. &gt;&gt; Yes, sir. &gt;&gt; For this is the witness of God which he hath testified of his son. This is God's witness. Water, blood, spirit, father, word, holy ghost. And brother Rand placed all three of these at Jesus crucifixion. Jesus's death was God's witness of his son's redemption for you and I. Let's skip down here. He talks about John John 1 John 5:7. There's three that bear record in the earth, which is water, blood, spirit. That's the three elements that came from the body of Christ. They pierced his side. Water came out, blood came out, and then into my hands I commend my There you are. That's the three elements. These three are not one, but they agree in one. And the church said, "God is one spirit, but the water, blood, spirit are not the same. There are three different elements that are required to save the bride of Jesus Christ." [laughter] Oh my. Hallelujah. We're saved once and for all. Praise God. You are forever perfected by the blood of Jesus Christ. &gt;&gt; Oh, hallelujah. I better close here. I'm uh this is my last this is my last slide. Let's stand. Musicians can come. Well, she's not okay. Victoria was sick, church. I forgot to say her. That's why uh she's not here. She was sick. Uh she's feeling better today, but we didn't want to take any chances. Now, with your Bible, my last verse, Colossians 3, verse one. If you have your Bibles, Colossians 3, verse one. You've been a very patient audience here by God's grace. I should say patient bride. Now, was this was this sermon a help by God's grace? It really helped me, brother Jose, for 24 years. I haven't understood. Brother B said, "God pulled out a bride out of Christ just like God pulled a bride out of Adam." And I'm like, "What, brother Vang? What? What does he mean, brother? Mercy, I don't get that." And then John 3 opened up. You got to be born of the water and the spirit. Jesus was shedding his blood and water in order to redeem this earth. That way the bride can have a spiritual birth. Oh my, it's beautiful. The word of God, the word of God is forever settled in heaven. Colossians 3 verse one. So here's my recommen recommendation to you for this Christmas and New Year season. I need it. You need it. I'd say we all need it. If then you be risen with Christ. How many are risen spiritually? I'm a new creation. My old man is dead. The old Jesse Smith is dead. I'm a new creature in Christ. I know it. I know I'm dead. Hallelujah. I'm raised with Christ. If you are raised up, then do this. Seek those things which are above, where Christ siteth on the right hand of God. Other words, seek God's mind. Lord, what do you want me to do? Set your affection. That's your love. Make heaven the thing you love the most. The throne of God, the angels of God, the cherubam saying, "Holy, holy, holy. Set your love or affection on things above, not on things of the earth. Saints, we can't love our smartphones. In other words, and I'll say this, we can't even love our children more than we love God much as I love my children. Can't love our husbands, our wives, our cars, our jobs. We can't love anything more than we love God Almighty. &gt;&gt; Set your affection on things above, not on things of the earth. Verse three, for you are dead and your life is hid with Christ in God. Hallelujah. Hallelujah. Where's my life? My life is in God. My future is in God. It's in Christ. And like Moses in the rock, but that rock is part of God, too. Christ is God's image. When Christ who is our life shall appear. Then ye also appear with him in glory. When Jesus comes back, I'll come back because I was in Jesus before the foundation of the world. And I'll say like this. I spent my life, Sister Anna, I spent my life believing that I was in Christ. I tried to serve Christ, get all my sins, Sister Beatric, I I tried to get all my sins under the blood of Jesus Christ every day. And I tried to live in Christ. Therefore, when he appears, I'll appear with him because I tried to hide myself in Christ. Hallelujah. And so then doubting Thomas, right? I told you I'd end with this. They they they badmouth him. They make him look bad. But church, we would all would doubt if it wasn't for God's mercy. &gt;&gt; That's right. &gt;&gt; He took the gospel further physically than any apostle. And his labor was second to Paul because Paul said, "I labored more than all of them." So he was probably the second greatest laborer and he was invited to thrust his hand. Jesus said, "Go ahead, thrust it in there." And what does Paul say? Paul says, "Put your life in Christ." Go ahead and put your life in my side. Put your life in the word of God. And then Jesus says, "Now you'll believe." Hallelujah. How many want to believe? Amen. &gt;&gt; Put your hand in Christ today. Thomas. Hallelujah. Bride, put your life, hide it in Christ today and you'll believe. Jesus said, "My Lord." I'm sorry. Thomas said, "My Lord and my God." After he put his hand in the side, my Lord and God. Amen. After he put our lives in Jesus Christ, Jesus is my Lord. Jesus is my God. Let's bow our heads. Oh my. Thank you, Lord Jesus. Oh my. We ought to be happy today, church. We ought to be thankful. Hallelujah. Now I know what the water and blood was all about. Now I know that was God purchasing the bodies, redeeming the bodies of the bride and also saying the bride can now be birthed because water, blood, and spirit are all present. and I'm going to form a bride 50 days later on the day of Pentecost. Oh Lord, we love you today. God, thank you for this word that we've heard today. God, for 24 years, I've not preach this. Lord, you're my witness. I've not understood as God pulled a bride out of Adam. God's going to pull a bride out of Christ [music] until yesterday. Thank you for John chapter 3. Thank you for all these verses that connected together. Lord, it's a beautiful picture from your Bible. Thank you that you have forever perfected the bride of Christ fellowship [music] if they'll believe the promises of God. Also, Brother Andy, Brother Arley, all of our friends in Christ, the Junction [music] City Saints, I love them so much. Lord God, our friends around the message. Lord, you have [music] forever perfected them by the blood. And now by that blood, we have access to heaven. Our prayers mean so [music] much. Hallelujah. We're kings and priests unto God. Lord, let us remember this message, [music] Lord, when we partake of the Lord's supper in two Sundays. God, help me to make reminders or bring it to my remembrance by the power of the spirit. You said, [music] "Do these things in remembrance of me." We'll remember that the water is cleansing, the blood is atonement, harmony with God, and the spirit is your life in us, Lord [music] God. We'll remember that, Jesus. We remember when we wash our brother's feet, his paths [music] are cleansed. The footsteps of the righteous are cleansed or ordered by the Lord. God, use our steps, Lord. use our travels, use our job assignments that [music] we can win souls to Jesus Christ. He that winth souls is wise. Grant it Lord God. So Lord we love you today God. I pray there was a good recording I could share this some of my [music] friends Lord God who might need that today. Hallelujah. that assurance that for once and for all the blood of Jesus Christ has forever [music] sanctified us. Hallelujah. We are your bride. Hallelujah. Jesus, help us remember we're holy without blame before you in [music] love. Forgive our sins today, Jesus. May we confess them and enjoy the forgiveness of the blood of Jesus [music] Christ. There's any sick and afflicted God. I pray that they would come forward so we could pray for them that your people could be well as we start 2026 [music] in Jesus Christ's name. And the saints said, let's sing a song here. If you need [music] prayer, you're more than welcome to
