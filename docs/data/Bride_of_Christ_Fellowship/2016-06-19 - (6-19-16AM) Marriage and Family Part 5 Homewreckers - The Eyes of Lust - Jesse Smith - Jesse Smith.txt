[Music] like Jesus no J J [Music] it Lord the Lord this morning praise God appreciate the Liberty in the spirit thank you John for a wonderful song service let's take our Bibles here this morning and open up to 2 Samuel 11 I can greet everybody in the name of the Lord Jesus and those that are here present those live streaming by God's grace it's going to be in the house of the Lord appreciate the Saints pressing their way out to the house of the Lord this morning as I said on the emails I've been sending out numerous emails to the church uh this week in the last few days here i' like to look at marriage and family again but I'm going to focus more on men again this morning by God's grace uh this is part five so we like to look at that and then this evening we'll look at Ephesians parallels Joshua by God's grace we'll look at that we been doing a series on Ephesians as well I just heard a quote yesterday um brother in 1960 preaching on positioning in Christ and he said this kind of preaching on Ephesians he said evangelists can't do this he said this is for pastors only I thought wow what a confirmation I'm preaching the right thing he said he said I can't go out there and evangelize and teach this scripture by scripture like that he said the churches can't receive it this has to be through a pastor Ministry so thank God for that so we're really encouraged by the word of the Lord so let's go to uh 2 Samuel 112 and3 I got a inter tit or subtopic here I like to call my subtopic I know it's a little uh uh intense but I like to call it home recer the eyes of lust so we're look at eyes of lust this morning by God's grace uh 2 Samuel 112 and3 how many you happy to be in the house of the Lord this morning praise God we're just so grateful to be back with you we surely enjoyed our vacation and um just enjoyed the time away together as a family really needed that had some wonderful times together learned a lot about the American Revolution so you're probably hearing some sermons on the American Revolution pretty soon it's a perfect type of the Revolution we're in right now the spiritual Revolution the brides Revival how many part of that by God's grace it's a perfect type of that and so we'll be preaching on that Lord willing and thank God for his mercy and his love you know one thing that really impacted me was that before they started uh the American Revolution before they signed the Declaration Independence they had a day of praying and fasting and it was to actually avert War uh to stay away from war because they just got out of numerous battles and things like that uh in in the day they just the ministers called them to pray and fast and then it wasn't long after that uh you know that war started and so see sometimes you know we pray and fast for things and it seems like God doesn't answer but church he answers every time and if you just set your side set yourself aside and pray and fast and wait on the Lord he'll bring you through it you might not want to go to war but he'll bring you through it by God's grace and he'll make you Victorious on the other end only God could do such great things as that praise God 2 Samuel 11 2 and 3 you're there say amen and it came to pass in an evening tide that David arose from off his bed and walked upon the roof of the King's house and from the roof he saw a woman washing herself and the woman was very beautiful to look upon and David sent and inquired after the woman and one said is this I'm sorry is not this Shea the daughter of Elam the wife of UAH the hittite look how David Gets reminders he said don't you know this is a daughter and this is a wife she's more than just a object you look at she's a daughter and a wife yeah amen she's the daughter of the king amen and all you sisters today you're Daughters of the king and brothers You're sons of the king so we got to treat each other like we're Sons and Daughters of the king Glory job 311 this is familiar scripture but in case you haven't read it in a while job was a man that God said he's a perfect man brother brah tells us he was perfect through the sacrifice of the blood of bulls and goats so that was that was his Perfection of that day job was not a sinless man but he was perfect because he kept offering the sacrifice of praise and even in job's day he had troubles with lust he had trouble with his eyes so he had to make a covenant he had to make a promise to God and say God I will keep my eyes from Evil things and this is applicable for all men and women this morning can every say Amen I'm going to give a testimony from our recent meetings in Minnesota where women were confessing their lust and their eye trouble so it's not just for men it's for women as well job 311 now of course it battles men more often but in our day and age with the visual age we have it's on women and them I made a covenant that means a promise a testament a vow I made a covenant with my eyes why then should I think upon a maid so see the eyes are first open and if they're open looking at the wrong thing that picture becomes a thought brother Ram said the eye is the gate to the soul but before it passes down to the soul it's got to pass through the human Spirit how many let's bow our heads how many would say Lord speak to me today help me today I have needs upon my heart God bless those hands my hands are up too let's pray Father in Heaven what a beautiful atmosphere we've had in song service thank you for the Liberty we feel in the Holy Ghost this morning I'm definitely feeling led to preach on this and father I just believe it's your perfect will father let our hearts men and women Lord be careful what our eyes see we sing that little song in Sunday school oh how critical it is for this day in Leia to be careful little eyes what you see oh God make it fresh to us make it new to us but Lord surely we need the victory Lord we love you so much and thank you for your power help us to have covenants Lord with you and our bodies and Lord our members help us to make promises Lord back by the word that we can keep to give you glory in Jesus Christ's name everybody said amen amen God bless you being see there praise [Music] God so we thank God for his mercy and his love it's been a little while since I preached so I'm very happy to be back behind the pulpit praise God over break you know I was the kids would ask me questions and then I just kind of start like preaching a little bit at them and he said Daddy you're preaching and I said well you can take the preacher out of the pulpit but you can't take the pulpit out of the preacher praise God it seems like everywhere I go there's a Pulpit inside of me and I always got to share the word of God so we're thankful for God's mercy and his love amen uh just keep uh uh this service in prayer there's some people that said they were coming they're not here yet and last night we're at this altar I was crying and praying with individual to uh get right with the Lord I think it was at midnight last night we were pleading with God at the altar here last night so I'm a little tired but uh thankful for God's mercy and his love if you just can say a little prayer in your heart for that ask God to guide the individuals to worship here if it's his will I believe it is so let's look at this thought uh my sub topic this is part five of marriage into family my subtopic is home recer the eyes of lust uh the term home wer has become more popular you know since uh social media and things like that uh and talk shows you know when I was younger God forgive me but I would watch you know some bad talk shows and that's when things got really bad on TV you know they started fighting and uh cussing and all these things like that but they would call you know they would have Mory pich was one of them I can't remember their names you know sad to say but I wasn't raising the message I didn't know that was I knew it was wrong but I didn't have preaching and teaching on it but you know what I'm trying to say um but they would have special shows where they would have home records and they would bring out a person who supposedly wrecked a home and then they would have the other person you know they explain why they wrecked the home and then they would have the other person share their side and usually there be a fight and that's what Skyrocket the radio somebody remember that anybody remember that it's a shame that was in the as I was growing up but I thought my what a interesting word because we see that happening with David in the scripture David wrecked a beautiful home he was a man Anointed The Holy Ghost now of course when he did this sin the anointing left him because the Bible said when you sin you grieve the spirit of God that means to offend now listen you have three parts when you grieve the Holy Ghost if you're born again Christian that anointing never leaves your soul it leaves your human spirit because you have three parts now in the Old Testament the Holy Ghost couldn't come according to John 7 38-39 the Bible said the Holy Ghost could not be given till Jesus was glorified brother said the same thing he repeated the same scripture so David had a seed in his soul but it was never quickened it was never sealed by the Holy Ghost and so when he looks out he'd already conquered look at this he conquered Goliath a natural giant but he couldn't conquer the Giant in his heart of lust praise the lord we think think about what God's brought us through and yet there's these little things that to the world it don't seem like big things but Satan if we don't give God the the the right way if we don't give God obedience things can conquer us that might not seem so great they might not seem like a Goliath but if we're not careful they could kill us and they could hinder our walk with the Lord how many with me so far so David had a soul it was a genuine seed of God but it was not quick because you only have one or the other uh and because it wasn't quickened uh it wasn't sealed by the Holy Ghost but his human Spirit would get anointed he would write songs he would play he would play on the harp and cast out demons off of Saul you know and slay Goliath and all prophesy about Jesus and and Psalm 22 and all these things but in this case it was just an ordinary evening the Bible doesn't say when the date was but the Bible said it was an evening time and it's just com another average day isn't that when Satan comes are just average days we're just trying to make it through the week just trying to make it through uh whatever more and here Satan comes and shows and allows this basa to get undressed and wash yourself in front of him and he did not have a spiritual guard up brother brand said he neglected his duties King should have been out in war the Bible tells us that we know that so first thing he neglected his responsibility wasn't fighting where he ought to do that's when we fall we're not fighting like we ought to amen we think we get in the picnic mode instead of the war mode right War mode is down on your knees battling principalities and powers and dominions can you say Amen to that but picnic mode is all just okay everything's fine don't have to pray up don't have to focus on the word don't have to plant the word in my heart don't have to memorize the Bible don't have to worry about all these things don't have to keep listening to tapes and you get in picnic mode which is neglecting the responsibilities God's given to us brother manam said it shouldn't take uh a desperation to get us to draw near to God but he said as humans that's what we need many times oh and so David here he gets relaxed he gets neglectful and he looks upon basba we know the story I preach on this about two months ago a little more in depth scripture by scripture but I'm just hitting the Highlight uh and remember before this Uriah had a beautiful home in 1 Chronicles 11 the Bible said Uriah was a valiant man he was one of David's Mighty Men right after David Rose up and got anointed and slave Goliath he was one that was prited and brought into the the fold there he was one of David's Mighty Men and he had a beautiful home he had a wife in subjection he had braba there and he he had a wonderful Godly home we would say he was walking in step with the word but because of one man's failure uh to to conquer his own lust his Goliath of lust I'll say it like that and we're g to get to porn in just a moment but my word for porn I don't want to use that word too much uh because it comes from the Greek word though although pornea which is a fornication uh but that word I'm going to use the word lust instead just because of the children and to be respectful them so hopefully they don't ask too many questions but if they do you can give them a Godly answer just ask the Holy Spirit to give you the right uh terminology there's always a gentler way to say things and you have to come out and say things maybe uh so plain uh to children so God will give us wisdom to do that and so Uriah had a beautiful home so what wrecked his home now look his his home was so consecrated to God that when David brought him back he was so focused on the the the leadership of the Holy Spirit the leadership of the Holy Spirit was your it's war time time you're to battle it's not fleshly Pleasures time it's war time and he was so devoted even when David got him drunk he would take him down to the house and go lay with your wife and he was so devoted even inside despite being drunk and all these things he was his mind was so made up on it's not time for fleshly lust it's time for Spiritual battle amen and if we can get that Focus today we'll be more than conquerors in Christ Jesus we'll conquer more enemies will overcome we'll be true over comers in this hour and if we overcome in this hour we sit on the throne with Christ amen glory but he had such so if see if if the leader of the home has everything in order everything else goes everything else Falls in order praise God sat you try to attack different places brother man said he tries to attack the wife more than anything so the husband's really got to pray for his wife we went through that we preached on that recently he must do that but if his focus is on right on Christ uh then it's a Happ Happ home it's a Victorious home by the grace of God brother BR makes a statement there in that first uh Ephesians parallels Joshua he said we find many people are displeased with Christianity he said they get frustrated with Christianity because their Center is not directly centered on the cross when people get dissatisfied and get that they just don't enjoy Christianity as much anymore it's a burden to them instead of a joy he say because they're not focus directly on the cross of Jesus Christ Church let our eyes remain upon the cross someone died for me because I'm Unholy Glory someone had to pay the price for my sins because I'm a sinner and I need to be saved by grace keep your eyes on that someone had to die for me I'm not worthy there's nothing good about me I must trust in the forgiveness and the grace and the blood of Jesus Christ amen glory but he said said it'll be such a discouragement to people if they're not directly focus on Calvary Christianity becomes a burden rather than a joy so we must be focused is completely on Jesus Christ now brother Brandon said this he said uh this is uh I can't remember the message oh yeah this is the message of Grace 1961 brother B said he wants to walk up to UAH in heaven and say brother UAH your testimony meant something to me on Earth praise God you imagine a prophet walking up now what was it about Uriah he was a man who sold out all his Heathen ideas to follow the message of the hour and the messenger of the hour and he was so devoted he wouldn't give over to a life of pleasure even his his his legal Pleasures with his wife he was so focused on the battle so focused on the war that he turned down physical Pleasures in order to fight and stay focused on the goal at hand that's a real man Glory a man that won't be no matter what what others try to influence him or get him drunk or whatever more or try to get him distracted a man will say f focus on the goal the prize that's a real man yiah was a real man church amen his devotion in the time of war was extremely loyal he was fully focused and sold out to war and would not partake of temporal physical Pleasures even though they were legal now most of us when our physical Pleasures they're not legal they're illegal praise God when we fall short of the glory of God they're illegal things they're sinful things sometimes we watch the wrong thing we look at the wrong thing we start thinking the wrong thing and that's where we get illegal troubles right but his would have been a legal pleasure but for that time and season he turned it down because he was so devoted what a man what a mighty man he was no wonder the Bible called him valant Hallelujah so let me say this let's read uh second Samuel let's go back to 2 Samuel 11:25 I brought this out well let me see the Holy Spirit brought it out I'm not I can't bring out nothing uh 2 Samuel 11:25 let's bring this out again this was really striking to me I think it came to me as I was ministering uh the the continual revelation of the Holy Ghost now before we read this remember David was a Man Who Loved God and he loved people he cried when his son absolon was killed he cried and wept they mourned for I think what a day or two maybe more when Saul died David mourned and wept over Saul a man that hated him how many remember that in scripture okay so now in our story you're right has died David ordered it he knows it the message comes back to David and here's what David says about the news of Uriah and his death here's what he says remember he cried he cried for his enemies he's cried for his son to try to take the Kingdom from him but when it comes to a loyal servant a follower of the message of the hour a mighty man he hardly even cares that Uriah died what was the difference well we're going to talk about it then David said unto the messenger thus shalt thou say unto joab let not this thing displease thee for the sword devoureth one as well as another make thy battle strong against the city and overthrow it and encourage thou him so he tells him es just tell joab don't be discouraged we lost you right just move on everybody dies and all these things like that there's no crying for him there's no mourning for him it's just oh somebody died okay move on where was David's affections where was David's love for his Brethren he cried over Saul he cried over absin he doesn't even cry over UAH you know why because when people are possessed by lust they lose their desire and care for other people because it's full selfishness it's full pride pride is my way is better than God's way and so David was all focused on himself as long as my sin is covered who cares about your right I don't care anymore he was walking by the wrong spirit so lust will keep will make you do things you never thought you would do amen amen lust will take you farther than you want to go he hardly acknowledges it but before he cry over his brother why because he was walking right with God and church when you and I make mistakes in sin and it's not repented yet we lose our affection as well Glory things don't touch us anymore yesterday a brother sent me a 13.8 megabyte video of Christians being whipped in h Africa with sticks and then burned alive That Shook me up I got it it's I'll share with you one they just get burnt and so they're they're charcoal and it's right on the video someone's phone it's a five minute video within five minutes they're beaten and of course it fast forwards and things like that church we should have that should make us want to pray those are your brothers and sisters being persecuted and we're that's what their battle is like and what's our battle we battle little lust we're battling our smartphones we're battling tobacco or we're battling uh you know hatred or we're bound uh Gossip or something like that these people are battling life and death but see when we get our eyes off with a prize those things don't impact us anymore when we hear about well P Christians being persecuted we don't want to pray for them we don't care about them why because we're only centered on us selfishness I need what I want I want my lust satisfied God help us to crucify the lust and the affections thereof and then we'll live for others praise God amen amen in other words when you give over to lust you lose your desire to live for others David was no longer living for Uriah he was living for himself so he had UAH killed so see when you give over to lust you lose uh the influence of eternal life I didn't say you lose eternal life I said you lose the influence of eternal life Hallelujah other words the anointing of the Holy Ghost does that make sense everybody David could care less about Uriah why because a lust Spirit was anointing him see we think demon possession is just somebody foaming at the mouth or they got cancer or their handshaking or something awful like that that's that's a bodily demon possession no doubt about that sometimes mind but what about the temporary possessions in our minds and Spirits the Bible calls them strongholds in our minds we build up strongholds when we entertain lust spirits and all these things like that and things we should not be watching Satan gets a stronghold in our mind and somewhere it messes up those one of those five channels affection reason imagination uh different ones like that I can't remember last two and it builds up a stronghold in our mind and so we don't God's spirit can't flow through that channel anymore we lose our affections God help us to have the right affections now let's go to some scriptures you can see this in the scripture Hosea 4:18 Hosea 418 I know it's an extremely personal topic that's just kind of what God's called me to do I believe my Ministry is a Deliverance Ministry I believe that with all my heart God's kind of proven to me over over and over and over again uh and we'll maybe share a little bit more on that later the very first sermon I ever preached was called addictions uh be not a stumbling block in Aran Ohio few weeks later brother Brooks had me preach people were telling me right after the service I got delivered from video games I got delivered from smoking got delivered from this got delivered from that uh seem like every time the spirit anoints the church to pole and me to get in the right Channel people get delivered amen so I'm thankful for that by God's grace and the only way I could be that kind of type of ministry was because I had to be delivered myself praise God lord I many deliverances I had to go through I've had numerous people tell me you know I've been delivered from smoking after uh hearing your ministry and different things like that delivered from this delivered from that delivered from movies delivered from uh TV shows all these things Church what is it it's the grace of God like I was telling someone last night I said you know the reason you went through you know all these trials is because God wants to bring out a special kind of testimony like brother said a bell when you make a bell it has certain types of metals right certain mixture of this kind of metal that kind of metal and then become based upon the different mixtures you get a special ring to that Bell and they're not all the same right and so that's how it is we have to go through this hardship of maybe maybe child abuse or the hardship of poverty or maybe the hardship of addiction or maybe the hardship of of something like that and because of it go God was there the whole time God was allowing us to go through to shape Us in order to bring us out and at the latter end we'll have a testimony that can have the right kind of ring Glory if it doesn't ring on this Earth Church it will ring at the day of judgment because Jesus said that the Queen of Sheba will be raised up and her testimony will ring out against all that generation because she came to see Solomon and a greater than Solomon is here amen glory you feel like your testimony is not being ringed out enough here don't get sad don't get discouraged because if it doesn't ring here it'll ring out there amen it'll ring at that white Throne judgment how many love the Lord amen glory so you had to go through what you went through not because God was upset at you but because God loves you and he wants you to have a special ring to your testimony oh hallelujah amen if I wasn't so addicted to those things how could people ever get delivered from my Ministry I wouldn't know anything about it but because I was addicted and God gave me victory in areas like this then I see people getting the same Victory I can say thank you Jesus that the testimony of Christ in my life can be a blessing to somebody else amen I know beyond a shadow of a doubt that's why God's called me to Pastor preach Deliverance is part of that Ministry I believe with all my heart God just keeps proving it again and again I didn't ask for it I just but that's that's the ring I have and this week I've had people tell me uh by those videos we have on YouTube they told me I'm done cutting my hair go I watch your video and and God is sh me I'm not supposed to cut my hair anymore you think that's a little thing that's a big thing brother brandom said thus sayith the Lord I don't care if a woman dances in the spirit shout speaks in tongues if she cuts her hair she's dead thus sayith the Lord so if she stops cutting her hair she can get born again hopefully not guaranteed right why because if she cuts her hair she dishonors her husband that dishonors Christ and that dishonors God how can somebody be born again and dishonor the very God of Christ you can't be you've got to get Victory and so when when I get a testimony like that it's more than the world to me praise God because now this individual can have ability to be delivered praise God the ability to be born again how how many love the Lord amen yes Hallelujah Glory oh Hosea 48 they eat up the sin of my people and they set their heart on iniquity see it's what you set your heart on remember uh we preach on Galatians we preach through every verse of Galatians Bible said don't be God is Not mocked you can't mock God you can't plant evil sins and expect a holy ghost experiences afterwards you got to plant Holy Ghost seeds and you'll get Holy Ghost fruit praise God amen amen he said they set their affections on sin on iniquity and what do they get judgment you must set yourself on of Heavens let's leave Colossians 3 beautiful scriptures that all tied together you must be set you must be so uh diligent like uh Uriah my goodness you must be so faithful you must be so uh programmed by the Holy Spirit I'm G to accept my affections I'm only gonna love what God loves amen I'm sorry I forgot to say Happy Father's Day to all the fathers I just saw forgive me uh Colossians I can't think of a better thing for fathers than to get victory over the lust of the eyes or mothers or or anybody by God's grace like I've said this before as we're turn there Colossians 3 I've said it before brother R said power without character is satanic and I apply that to the smartphone power or access to the internet or laptops or whatever you got that kind of power access without the character of a Christian is satanic in your life how many believe that yeah I met somebody from Meo email me and say that really touched me brother Jess I really need that to get Deliverance they were just streaming one day I said glory to God that kind of power without the character of Christ is satanic in your life I don't have a struggle with pornography I don't I don't struggle with the lust on my phone and movies and I don't struggle with that you know why because I've been delivered praise God I used to many moons ago many many moons ago but God has shown me and delivered me and he showed me how to live a Victorious Life above it amen so we get into that how do you overcome by the word how did Jesus overcome Satan's Temptation from Satan himself he just quoted the word and now he did more than that he stayed behind the word too amen see we'll quote the word and say well get behind me get behind me and then will partake of sin you got to quote the word and stay behind it and not go out after it amen glory Brother s the seals he said to sin Satan can't get into your soul you've got to leave the soul your your cons has to leave the soul stop deciding from the soul and go out to him to get sin but he can't get you in the soul because you're sealed by Christ until the day of your Redemption amen glory is that all right Brothers on Father's Day is that okay Glory Satan cannot touch you when you're walking by the soul that's a nature so it's a holy nature or we if we don't if we're not affected by that or influenced by that then we're just in our human Spirit that's where we're we're making decisions from we got to make decisions from the nature of Christ Colossians 3 1 if ye then be risen with Christ seek those things which are above where God sth on the right hand of God isn't that our daily battle right we're seeking so many things we got to seek the things that are above praise the Lord I heard this I'm going to repeat I heard it in Minnesota one of the brothers said he said how come I see he's a evangelist we're going to have him here uh Lord willing in August brother Dale Smith what a wonderful Ministry what a wonderful brother he made the statement he said my pastor Jason Watkins made this statement he said I see so many people in the message trying to get rich he said why would we try to get rich when Jesus said that's the thing that'll keep most people out of the kingdom of God I thought what a beautiful thought why are people trying to get rich when Jesus said that's your greatest trouble uh that will keep people out of the kingdom of God is riches how hardly a man can enter the the kingdom by riches it's like a camel trying to get through an eye of a needle praise the Lord it depends what you set your affections on set your affections on things above like heaven and Jesus and God and the Saints and glory and the sixth Dimension and divine love and all these things eternal life eternal youth all these things let us set our affections on things above verse two so set your affections on things above not on things on the Earth now affections is your emotions Your Love don't get fully attached emotionally to things on the earth so much get emotional to the things of God in heaven when was the last time you cried over the joy of going to heaven I'll give you a few seconds to think about that Glory when was the last time you cried for a soul I just did it last night at 12 midnight by God's grace right here at this altar right here now it doesn't happen every day but Church it ought to right because if brother man said you got the Holy Ghost you will sign and cry for the Abominations of the sins done in this city don't cry for people that don't have because your affections are set on that I don't care if you say it's hard for you to cry if you get t with the Holy Spirit it'll give you such a burden for them you can't help but cry it's exactly right so see set your affections on things above for ye are dead and your life is hid with Christ and God brother Bry said brother said this I heard on the adoption series he said go walk over kick a dead man or and say you hypocrite and see what he says he said a dead man won't get up and say nothing he said I'm afraid too many of us went down to be baptized and died and he said we weren't dead yet because when somebody calls you hypocrite or mistreat you you get up and say something about it but a dead man will lay there brother said in fact the dead man will actually get up and go praying about you to Jesus amen is that right Church yeah that's what he said listen to it if you want adoption series beautiful you're dead you're supposed to be dead your will your desires should be dead your emotion should be set on things above David's was not set on things above it was upon a little pretty girl that he was watching take a bath wasn't set on things above and when he fought Goliath it was set on things above I'm taking your head off today because you I come against you in the name of the Lord God of hosts amen God show me your head's coming off today God showed it to me in a vision right like brother R said hallelujah how many love the Lord amen yes so see you must set your affections on things above now let's start getting in a little bit here uh some deeper scriptures here so see when people get anointed by lust a stronghold of lust they no longer care about things they should care about their effects David didn't care about his friends anymore sometimes when people aren't contacting you now not every time but sometimes when your friends don't contact you don't email you back don't text you back don't call you you back after a while sometimes it's because they're struggling with lust and they don't care anymore but sometimes they're just plain busy praise the Lord I'm just saying that's one example someone might I've had that recently happen to me people won't call me back and text me back nobody in here because they're actually struggling with sin and they're avoiding me but like a pastor Shepherd I'm trying to go after those sheep come on back come on back here's some good sheep food I'm not sure grass I'm not sure what you have hey whatever more come on I'm trying to get them to come back but the reason they don't respond back the reason they don't have any affection toward me is because of sin they lost their natural affection that they should have a pastor that cares about me a pastor that will call me a pastor that will answer my questions a pastor that'll sit down and ask me how things are going that don't have any impact on them anymore all this about is me me me it should be about we we we amen church should be about us should be about the body of Christ because we're not going anywhere till that last member's called in glory should be about us the body of Christ eternal life living for others okay second Peter 28 this is a familiar scripture but extremely powerful second Peter 2:8 let's start getting into men and their struggles here uh because like I said I'm realizing it's not just men anymore it's women women might not lust after the same things men do but as I said from our recent meetings there Minnesota they do lust after certain things might not be the visuals men lust after but for women it might be the feelings of emotional romance or something like that might be some other type of a a feeling or some type of a lust or something along those lines so second Peter 2:8 now you're familiar with this lot was a foolish virgin how many believe that he wasn't the highest quality believer he was a penny Abraham was a silver dollar Glory how do you know because Abraham SA out of Sodom Abraham was not draw by the luxuries and Riches of Sodom he just said have your choice right and lot was okay with living around a bunch of homosexuals I'm sorry I'm not I'm not comfortable worshiping around them unless they repent now I have patience I have patience with a homosexual person I have patience with a murderer we have patience with the Molester have patience with any sinner murderer liar you can go to hell for lieing the Bible says you want to H the kingdom God just for lying and not repenting of it the Bible says we have so much grace upon them but when you go to correct them the Bible said in Galatians 6 Mar guard yourself that you're not tempted with the same thing they bow because demons like to jump on other people amen so lot just goes around them and he's hang he's living around homosexual homosexuality and he he he doesn't say too much about it because as soon as he says something about it they say we're going to knock your house down and we're going to tear you up lot so it shows the whole time lot wasn't he was just you know shaking hands and nice to meet you nice to have our financial gains here oh boy we're sure getting rich and all these things well you guys can just live however you want to live well the said his prayer meeting got smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and then when he tried to get his sons-in-laws to believe it was destruction time they laughed and mocked at him brother B said that was because he didn't have a real Godly testimony of like Abraham believer that's right up I preach a whole group of sermons unlocked Abraham was a higher quality God said I can reveal my destruction to Abraham because I know he'll train his children to go in the ways of the Lord amen so second Peter 28 for that righteous man now look he's a righteous man he he saved that righteous man dwelling among them in seeing and in hearing Vex his righteous soul from day to day with their unlawful Deeds Vex means torment and the word devil means what Tormentor and we know that how did lot get tormented every day here's a man living amongst homosexuality the Bible tells us here he was tormented every day he couldn't get peace any day why because he was seeing and hearing all the sins in Sodom and Gomorrah every day he couldn't get away from it so that every day he tormented there's no peace why does this happen I'm a righteous man I hate this and he allowed himself rather than moving away and getting some peace he remained in it why was that he wasn't the same type of Christian as Abraham that right that look for us we might battle with that but see we can live above that we can leave that because Abraham and his father were over there by the Tower of Babel but they left it amen glory so if you're being tormented don't don't be discouraged don't make yourself Li make yourself Abraham with his daddy and move away from the Tower of Babel come out from among them and be separate sayth the Lord and I'll receive you as Sons amen glory that's what I when people preach about Judas I say in my mind I'm never Judas I'm never Judas now I say like this I'm never liot I'm never liot I always say I got the Holy Ghost I'm born again I know I'm delivered I'm not going back uh God has delivered me we always say the right thing you're a Creator create the atmosphere SP and watch it happen amen death and life are in the power of the tongue create life with your words amen and watch yourself overcome by the grace of God glory but lot oh honey I comeing what's wrong darl every day coming like this well I saw some homosexuals King down the street I saw this man rape this man all these things like that you better be careful the news stories you watching yes wonder why you're having trouble sleeping wonder why you're having trouble reading your Bible it's because of the thing you see and hear and the church said brother bam said this look what brother says this is blind Bas 1960 see and there's something about now he's talking about how Jesus contacted the woman at the the well remember how the Bible said Paul and Peter would go to people that needed healing and they say look on us remember that so see he had to contact their Spirit that's how you contact somebody's spirit look him in the eye get their attention that's how you contact them and brother saying that's what Jesus did he had to talk to the woman to catch your spirit and get her to look at it and then you can start helping out somebody he said each one of you you're looking at me your eye is the gate to your soul huh so the outward flesh body is the first gate down to the Third Realm so there there is a gate in your outer realm it's called your eye it's called your eyesight that is the first gate that gets in that Satan's trying to get in or God's trying to get in Glory Hallelujah that's the first gate where God is trying God or Satan is trying to influence your soul he's trying to work his way down to the second uh ground and then down to the Third Realm the first gate is in your flesh it's your eyes how many believe that brother said that about Paul and Peter they couldn't heal the people until they got him to look at them and then Peter could say I see you got faith to be healed he said a loud voice rise in the name of Jesus Christ you're healed how he saw it Through The Eyes glory amen Church your eyes a gate to your soul you can look at it it almost governs the other senses so you're eye governs almost governs all your other senses how many how many can say Amen to that think about it throughout the day what's the things you remember at the end of the day well probably what you saw right probably what you heard your last few thoughts well I saw that video oh my I saw that news article that's what brother Ram said he said it's usually no he now I gu an example he said you look at something before you taste it don't you you just don't start eating things about looking at it your first and most important sense is your eyes now after church we can try that my wife brought some soup you don't have to look at it and I'll just you'll close your eyes I'll take my spoon I'll put in the soup and I'll put in your mouth how many would like that you would like your taste probably but just the idea of something go contacting you that you haven't looked at no I got to look at it that's why Christmas presents or birthday presents are so excited what's under there what's under that wrapping paper that's why kids love Christmas who doesn't I mean who doesn't like to get a gift Wendy's like Wendy's like the queen of giving gifts you know I got but God anoints her to do that there's been times I've been so discouraged Wendy will give me a gift I'm like oh no I'm not telling you get me gift sister I'm just saying I'm just giving you a rose but that's her Ministry it seems like to be able to be sensitive to the needs of others and to bless others my wife will give me things like Oh Glory oh I just I needed that I wanted that how did you know there's something about your eyes catching it he said you look at something before you smell it and feel it and so forth so the sense that governs all your other senses brother manam said is sight and that's the first gate to your soul and the Bible said the soul that sinth it shall what die Satan is trying to influence your soul so that disbelieves God's word how many you going to believe God's word today Glory he's trying to get your soul to disbelieve it God can't do this God's not worth my time God's not worth the investment of my youth yes he is I'm 35 years old I gave my life to Christ at 19 if I could go back I would have gave it to him at five Glory it's been the greatest investment you say well you miss the sewing your wild seeds and things like that I didn't want to sew wild seeds I want to seow seeds of faith I want to se seeds of Holiness the Bible said remember the Creator in the days of your youth because the days will come when you're older and you'll say I have no pleasure in them I got arthritis I can't get off the wheelchair I'm in a h I'm in a nursing home all these things where the physical things of Life Won't Be pleasurable remember God now and will bless your later years amen glory the eye is the gate to your soul no wonder Peter said the lust of the flesh FL make you war against your soul how many remember that scripture you ever feel like you're having a war with yourself ever feel like that I want to do what's right but I can't I want to do what's right but I keep struggling it's a war it's a war going on with your soul the soul that the seed of God that wants to live and be expressed and be quickened and and made alive that Soul wants to be made alive it wants full control but when we give over to the affections and lust of the flesh it creates a war within us that's why the peace of God only comes when we fully obey the word of God praise the Lord and church there's a very easy way to get peace it's called repentance it's extremely simple God doesn't make it too hard the Bible said a fool won't air in this way it's so easy a fool can't miss it all you have to do is say I'm sorry and Lord I don't want to go back and you'll feel the peace of God sweep over your soul if you repented at all if you meant it at all and mean it from your heart you'll feel that sweet peace come because there's a war going on and once God gets the victory it's like a peace treaty no more guns fire no more no more killing no more this and that oh there's peace in the land Glory Hallelujah the eyes the gate to of the Soul now now verse eight so how did lot get how did how was he tormented every day by the things he saw and he heard so church if we're being if we're living a tormented life it's because of what we're seeing and hearing probably and it's probably things we haven't repented of fully because really when when you what's repent repent is Du a 180 right repent if you don't repent you keep walking enjoying the sin but when you repent you actually go the other direction you got to do more than turn your back you actually got to go further into the right direction got to go more into Holiness that's what we do that's what we all battle with it some days you know we just turn our backs and say I'm sorry but we actually have to make some progress and get some victory you got to possess the land step by step praise the Lord little by little step by step you'll possess all your inheritance oh brother Jess I feel like there's more peace out there for me there is walk in it I feel like there's more Victory out there I feel like there's more Revelations out there I feel like there's more power out there more bonus out there there is walk into it one day at a time step by step God will lead you if we just make the make the walk and make our direction to walk into Holiness and not stay defeated how many love the Lord beautiful the word is beautiful so this is why he's tormented what he saw and heard it's so important church now let's do a few more now I want to get now into lust or like we said porneia let's go to Proverbs 5 now we're going to read about four scriptures in Proverbs so just have your Bibles handy there this sets you free this sets you free free I thought about this you know when you when you turn your Bible real fast like that it creates a wind doesn't it it's like the wind that that that kind of ignites the fire in your soul that's how I look at it by God's gra you see I go like that all that wind comes and it ignites my soul to read more of the word amen glory maybe that's a childlike expression but that's how I feel Robbs 55 okay now this is speaking of a woman let's go to verse three though Proverbs 5:3 for the lips of a strange woman drop as a honeycomb and her mouth is smoother than oil he's describing an evil woman on the outside it's really smooth and sweet isn't it sin is always pleasurable for a season but the end of sin is death separation verse four but her end is bitter as wormwood sharp as the two-edged sword her feet go down to death her steps take hold on hell so other words when she possesses the land her steps take hold on the land of Destruction the Lake of Fire that's where her steps are going her steps take a hold of hell that's the direction she's walking but we got to walk the other direction praise the lord we got to walk away from lust and walk toward the Heavenly land towards our Promised Land by God's grace so the seductress or the adulterous woman is always connected to hell because a forn a fornicator or adulterer will not inherit the kingdom of God any sexual sin outside of marriage that's not in the Holy uh undefiled bed if not repented of that person will not inherit the kingdom of God any sexual sin that's exactly right I believe I can back that up by all the scripture because one of those uh Greek words means any sexual act in the Greek it can mean anything anything that's not approved by God God help us to repent amen just just just like Sams just repent say Lord once more bring the Holy Ghost back forgive me uh he'll he'll come back in a powerful way Proverbs 7:27 here's another one okay go to verse 25 let not thine heart decline her ways uh go not astray in her paths so see what she is uh a woman that's a seductoras or let me say like this any any uh uh temptation to your eyes it's taking you on a decline praise God it's taking you on a decline not on an incline it's a decline why because sin is the easier way how many ever run downhill it's pretty easy isn't it how many never tried to run uphill now you got a real challenge now you're GNA see What You're Made Of but everybody loves to run her right there b down the hill it's so easy that's how sin is sin is so easy and that your speed picks up as you go the closer you get to spiritual death and all these evil fruits and corrupt fruits and all these things like that but to walk the narrow way it's an Ascension Glory it's going higher and higher in Christ Living in Heavenly places in Christ Jesus now look at her she's this woman she's a quite a foe for she have cast on many wounded see what happened people get wounded in their spirits and she cast them down they get wounded for example people might get wounded maybe they get hurt by a boyfriend they get hurt by a girlfriend and so they just want some love so they go out and get a prostitute or something like that right or somebody breaks their heart and so they go out and they go with somebody they shouldn't go with and so Satan anoints people to have somebody ready there to tempt them with a relationship tempt them with lust and that person will snatch many wounded people see how we got to have the healing of Christ in our lives when there's a hurt situation someone hurt you you better pray for healing and the church said you better pray for healing you better pray for divine love perfect love I'm not saying scars won't exist there might be little scars but I'm saying if you really have healing in your heart you can look at that person and say thank God Jesus died for them amen and you don't have the complex anymore like I hate this person every time I around them I feel hatred and that you got to cast out upon the Lord amen you've got to cast down anything that exalts itself against the glory of God Amen if not it will eat you alive and it you'll be wounded like a wounded soldier brother talked about that wounded soldier at Amnesia F but just not go that direction but just so you know people get wounded they let sin remain in their hearts and they don't let themselves be healed by God they don't let the bomb and Gilead come and heal them and those the kind Satan targets those that are already wounded and hurting God help us to be healed every service that's why every service is important get healing get time to worship time to love God time to pray time to seek God if not you're going to be so busy when you GNA when are you gonna find time how many of you give the last three how many service is usually three hours right sometimes too on Wednesday night how many of you just on your free time give two hours every every other night for God how many you do that I say hardly hardly any probably do just out of your love for God that's why service is so important to stay in tune with the Holy Spirit brother R said always be where the spirit of God is pouring out and I feel he's pouring out this morning amen glory for those who want them to pour out on them Glory see it's those that are wounded that don't take care of their sins or their hurts they just say well I'm I'm wounded somebody hurt me somebody that's fine but Jesus is here to heal you don't stay wounded be healed in Jesus name don't hold any bitterness against anybody brother said never have any bitterness in your heart towards anybody or else Satan will get in there yay many strong men have been slain by her David was slain now just for a temporal time I'm not talking about eternity Samson was slain right what got them women temptation of women is that right Church they were slain for a few moments thank God he resurrected them her house is the way to hell want to go to hell go follow a woman who's got a lustful Spirit on her or go get involved in any lust of the flesh that's the house is the way to Hell going down to the chambers of death imagine entering into a prison house or some type of Chamber Of Death that's what it's like to commit adultery that's what it's like to commit fornication now say like that that's what it's like to be addicted to pornography exactly right Proverbs 9:18 this is how the Bible describes this this is not something we should take lightly what you see what you hear you must guard it like a soldier amen that's right oh last night had that good illustration last night when we were fellowshipping some people say well how come we're not how come oh he said Jesus is the five star general right now what if your general said just stay here and guard your your your headquarters oh I want to go and fight though General come on I want to see more signs and I want to slay more devils and I but what if your general just say it's time for a guarding time right now it's not exactly war time it's not full-blown War would you be happy and that's what I think the bride's going through right now she's getting trained to guard herself for one final showdown about Zion Showdown amen she's guarding her life she's guarding in headquarters she's making sure everybody's sealed she's making sure the tokens applied amen glory she's making sure there's and keeping ey all the demons making sure the blood's on the lentil and the doorpost and making sure she's guarded like a soldier just walking back any devil that comes up she slays it in the name of Jesus Christ amen well come on I want to go out and do these things what but what if your general said just guard the house just say would you be able to keep your duty would you be able to keep keep your orders my prayer is God let me obey your orders if this just time to guard my family until a great final battle comes then God let me do it with the sword of the spirit let me stand there like a soldier that was a beautiful illustration last night don't you that's beautiful my that's a good thought Glory would you like that okay now Proverbs 9:18 I never got to that okay now in Proverbs 9 it Compares a woman to a well and remember God told Sal or Solomon told his son drink from your own water so Brothers we have to look at women like that God has one well for you all women are wells to a man because a man's thirsty right the Bible calls it a burning how many know that God places in a man to reproduce to multiply said he can't get away from that brother said it's totally impossible for a man to look at a woman who's half naked and not get a sensation pass over him we're going to get to that in a little bit it's called dopamine something in this human spirit is released he has no control over that so he's got to have somebody to control that GL amen he can't control the feeling but he can control the reaction amen he can control his next step he can't control the the dopamine from being released and all these things but he can't control his next decision is he GNA pursue that opportunity or is he going to turn it down in the name of Jesus Hallelujah so every woman to a man is like a whale but God has one well where the man is supposed to get his refreshing right now verse 17 stolen waters are sweet see when people steal other men's wives it tastes sweet to them at first and bread eaten in secret is Pleasant secret sins they don't tell anybody well let's just have an affair on the side let's just have a fornication before we're married and nobody will know about it well God knows about it yes sir it sure taste sweet it sure that taste sweet uh my first denominational Pastor when I first gave my heart to the lord gave this illustration he said your sexual your sexuality is like a Band-Aid the first time you have an interaction that Band-Aid is stuck on that person if that person doesn't remain your spouse the Band-Aid gets tore off and it's a little less sticky the next time everybody understand what I'm saying and so you need to wait we need to wait up on God and wait till uh God brings us the right spouse now listen most of us have have had sexual trials or or mistakes before most of us right church so what God does is God brings healing in the process are you with me but that was a great illustration to understand that you got to really guard it and you got to understand that that we have to wait upon the Lord for his leadership praise the Lord and give all that we have have to the person God's called us to have I thought that was a good illustration like I said there's healing in it and so forth we know God heals and can restore uh God can restore the stickiness can I say like that God can restore sayith the Lord that's right so what I mean is by that you'll enjoy the that relationship more in marriage by God's grace that's what I mean to say by the grace of the Lord okay but he knoweth not that the Dead are there so see this is a man who's taken adultery and not her and that her guests are in the depths of hell right so a man who say like this addicted to the internet lust or he actually goes out to prostitutes or a woman who's C in adultery or something like that they don't even realize they're living amongst the dead and that's why you heard preachers preach on zombies a lot because zombies are like the living dead that's what a lot of people are today those that are predestinated for hell they're like the Living Dead they're alive physically but dead spiritually and they're never Liv spiritually right so her guests are in the depths of hell so all the people that do those same acts as an immoral woman today or immoral man they're all guests in the depths of hell they're all predestined to that right now Proverbs 27:20 I'm thankful for the delivering power of the Holy Spirit I'm thankful for the healing power of the Holy Spirit let's not be wounded church if you have a wound go to Jesus and say Heal Me and the next time Satan tries to come back you say I don't hurt me anymore I'm Healed Hallelujah that can't hurt me I'm not wounded anymore I'm Healed by the power of the Holy Spirit that's a reality church that's a reality and that's for any sin not just sexual sin any sin Proverbs 2710 I believe it was that right oh yeah thank you brother appreciate that yes look at you thank you glory hell and destruction are Never full so the eyes of man are never satisfied that's why men with the lust problems and internet problems and things like that they can never get enough they never get enough It's never enough so if someone doesn't repent they'll keep going and wanting more and more and more and more the same thing is true though for a Christian who's repented once you get some of God you just want more and more and more and you're never satisfied you want more and more of Jesus how many you believe that Glory that's right I can never get up of the preaching and the worship and the word uh last Sunday I was so hungry for God that there was no message churches in our area so I just I I just prayed and asked God to Lead Me went to Assembly of God Church because that's the church I was Raising I thought well if I can't get a whole over get a few slices and church I got a few slices the worship was beautiful they had the piano there I was such a I felt the presence of the Lord this was end time became a more reality to me there was people that right raising up crying and praising God thaning for but as soon as the preacher got there he cracked some jokes and you could just feel like oh the anointing just left and in the middle of his message he went into First Corinthians 2 and he started dealing with how there's Mysteries we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery and he keep saying we got to go deeper there's deeper Revelations there's deeper Mysteries that God wants to reveal to us before the end time I was like and he said he said God got God's forign knowledge he said God is like a he didn't know anywhere to explain it he said but like a card player how they he said PE people can cheat and mark the cards so they know what cards you got across the table if you're playing cars he said that's kind of how God is now that he said that's sacrilegious I said yeah that is but he said God knows everybody's hand and God knows all the cards and he said God knows that who that are here today that are children of God and who are not I thought mercy here we are he's preached on Mysteries he said there's greater deep things to go into and I thought thank God that's exactly what God has done for me he's taken me into the deep things of God he's revealed his word to me the Bible's a new Bible and now I know who everybody is I know who the Jew is I know who the foolish virgin is I know who the sinner is and I know who the right is most importantly I know who Christ is amen he's the word hallelujah he's not a denomination he's not a Creed he's not a tradition he's the word it was such a wonderful time of Lord you are truly speaking to me and he stopped at the verse verse 10 verse 10 says but he has revealed him unto us the deep and secret things he stopped right there I thought oh mercy if God ain't speaking here this morning I don't know who is he's crying at the end say here now here's crying at the end saying God he said eyes not seen ear ear Hur about what you're going to do it's going to be greater than isusa street because what is their what's their denomination based on ausa street and they're looking for something greater he talked about uh different Miracles and things that would be greater than what ausia street was and they're expecting the whole world to be revived and saved that's the Revival they're looking for brother said thus sayth the Lord it will not be a worldwide Revival it will be a bride's Revival it will be a latter rain on the true seat of God Amen they will never have a word Revival they might have some type of gathering together they're gathering together to academical council ra said that's the hour we're living in is The Binding of the tears how many know that that's the hour you're living in is The Binding of the tears well if they're being bounded together then we're maturing and we're learning how to bow to the Sun right aren't you glad for that the tears are getting plucked up one by one their denominations they're getting plucked up and get ready to be bound together and we're just laying there enjoying the rains Glory enjoying the word just loving God just bowing saying thank you Jesus send the rain and the rain both wheat and tear are praying for Revival but we're the only ones that's going to have the right revival can you say Amen to that Glory they are so misguided and there's nothing against them it's because their hearts haven't open so the the man comes up he said can you fill out this card the pastor wants to contact you I said sure here's my website here's my number he hasn't contacted me yet but hopefully he does by God's grace God is everywhere church if you go with a Hungry Heart God will speak to you amen beat on you according to your faith that's what Jesus says okay Proverbs 27:20 yes thank you sir uh never satisfied yes eyes are never satisfied so they can never get enough now let's look at some studies here bear with me just a moment um I want to read these studies here now I've got these from a YouTube channel called Covenant eyes they're a company that uh they make uh software for computers and tablets uh that keeps you away from uh lustful websites I'll say like that and we did it for a few years but then I found a way to do it without you know paying the money to them to have us do it uh so I found a way to do it on your on your iPad you can uh restrict things and things like that which is which is really nice restrict websites and you have to have permission to go to any new website so that's kind of nice you don't have to pay the extra $20 a month you know there's a way to do it by God's grace but anyways this this website does uh this company does great studies on pornography almost every week they put out a new video talking about the harmful effects of it and it's a really good uh YouTube channel there I got I've been very helped by it so let's let's read a few of these here okay so now you can just you know can just kind of listen to some of these facts here they made a video said the essential reason why lust is wrong now I'm not I'm going to use the word lust instead of the other word they make a they make a point showing that the act of this lust is not love it's selfish selfish usage so they they say the whole the whole reason behind why lust is wrong is because it's a selfish act it's someone selfishly using something for their desire rather than God's desire that's so true that is so true and like I said it's for women like I experienc in Minnesota it's for women and men anything you look at and lust after without it being the will of God it's a selfish usage and not the will of God here are four ways that lust warps the human male brain it says these from a real real studies they list them on the video lust gives watching lust gives men a new unrealistic standard of beauty so men learn by watching these videos and and websites and women too they learn a different definition of beauty okay so an instead of the word being their definition of beauty and instead of filtering your thoughts through the word they filter it through a evil website or a bad a bad movie and because of just watching that over and over it reprograms their brain to associate Beauty with these evil things these evil pictures evil videos and it takes it takes all the value of the woman away they no longer care about the inward beauty of a woman they only care about the external and it's a lust of what just the flesh It's All Flesh nothing about the character nothing about the soul of a woman and that's sad when Brothers marry women just for the sexual benefit of it that's a sad thing they don't even treat her like a sister in Christ that's a real sad thing she's a daughter of God who has a soul as a human Spirit who wants to bond with a man all a man sees is just a physical use something selfish he can use that's lower than an animal praise God Amen they're beasts but a man don't look at a woman like the way she's supposed to be made to look at as a daughter of God next the second study showed male brains don't just view lust they enter into it now listen when a a brain in the brain Myra neurons fire in the brain when men watch lust which produce a reaction when you you it's the same reaction you see when uh when hit by a car and you feel the impact of what you viewed how many you ever seen that you watch somebody get hit you watch the video of somebody you know getting shot or whatever maybe you don't mean to but you you can actually feel that how many ever experienced that before you can feel what you're watching movies love to do that they'll make you feel it right fear or you know they'll make you feel that's what lust videos do it makes you enter into that what's going on because myew rounds fire says so when men watch it they're the actual one they enter into it and they become the ones acting in the video or on the on the on the picture they view their themselves as the main character the one who's powerful it makes the man feel like he's attractive and sought after by the woman so now he's validated now he's strong now he's attractive so now he's from he's left reality and he's come to a spot of fantasy and he becomes defiled so these Myra neurons place the man doing the ACT himself that's why Jesus said to lust in Matthew 5 to lust in your heart is doing the very same act because that's what seeing it does when a man watches that and enters into that he's literally coming into the video literally coming AP part of that picture because of the uh the my neurons in his brain number three the more a man watches lust the more brain looks like an addict's brain like alcoholics when hook up to MRI machine a lust addict's brain structure the vental dium lights up just as when an alcoholic brain lights up when it sees a picture of a beer same it has the same reaction researchers believe the more you watch lust like the more alcoh alcoholics look at and drink alcohol cause them to lose their willpower to turn down alcohol or lust you lose willpower to overcome it the the more you watch it the more you're taken by it like brother said about the maniac vad he lied one time a devil got on him he had a drink another devil came on he had another drink another devil come on him the more bad decisions you make the more Devils get on you so instead of I'm sorry they become slaves to lust or alcohol rather than enjoying it so at some point people stop enjoying it they're just a slave to it they just can't say no because of what's Happening up here now here let's look at how it impacts the brain now look this is how lust impacts the human Spirit I'm not GNA use the word brain anymore I'm gonna use the word Spirit that's a part of your that's part of your human Spirit right the brain is the well the the brain is the control center for everything your body does it's three pounds but uses 20% of blood and oxygen just to operate the brain is pliable it can be trained Chang molded shaped has a 100 million neurons and is always making new connections if you allow it that's why brother R said read read books a lot and I've I've as a teacher I've read other articles too where if you don't read you get set in your ways and you cannot change anymore you become you become a know at all and you can't that's why old people they don't some some of the old people don't change anymore they can't overcome things because they get set in their ways they stop making new Connections in their brain the human Spirit their Spirits get lazy in the church say Amen to that amen so that's why it's good to constantly learn something new about the Lord the Bible say grow in Grace and what the knowledge when you learn something new about Christ it's like a new neuron path in your brain amen and it's all what going towards Christ it's all centered around Christ it's a beautiful thing God uh he he molds and pl and he trains our human Spirits all these new Pathways in our brains to think about Christ oh my now listen lust viewing lust triggers the same neurotransmitters and hormones as having the literal Act of lust but the effect is very different a man that is uh aroused towards lust dopamine is released and creates a state of tension and focus that got a habit feeling how many ever felt that you're watching something should say how many we've all felt that but you know it's like ever your flesh often feels like that I got to have this right that's the dope of me oh I've got to have this food I gotta have this video I gotta have this picture I gotta have this when it's pleasure For Your Love pleasure for your flesh that's dopamine I gotta have it it got It's gotta go through it this feeling that's dopamine it is a Feelgood reward that makes the person want to have more of the activity the feeling of dopamine is addictive then no I'm sorry no repine F I can't say no repine PR is released which creates more alertness burning this experience in our minds at the moment of heightened arousal oxytocin or vasopressin is released which create a emotional bond to the person or object causing the re arousal so a spiritual bond isect connected in your mind when someone has a a arousal experience whether it's with a wife which or husband which That's The Godly way how when you're married you want to have a connection with your husband and wife don't you that's right that's the B that's why God created these oxytocin and things like that dopamine he created it so you'll be so bonded to your spouse but when we go out when we when we have dopamine for lust of the flesh it creates a bond to what a computer screen it creates a bond yes it creates a a bond to a phone a bond to a tablet a bond to a laptop praise the Lord because that's where you're getting the arousal from so no matter wherever people go to satisfy their lust and that's why they can bonds to restaurants right right church or bond to certain foods if that's the heighten of their arousal and satisfies that I'm talking about sinful arouser like that that that's what happens and all these connections are made in the in the brain now it says the body also creates and releases o opiates creating a sense of euphor and release then serotonin is released causing calmness sense of well-being satisfaction now when someone's viewing lust the same neurotransmitters and hormones are released but they create different neurop Pathways in the brain see that so if you if you're married and you're able to have those experiences with your spouse they create a pathway in your SP in your brain to your spouse so whenever you think of your spouse that's the connection you have but if someone gives into lust or or you know internet lust and all these things like that they have a connection in their brain to the computer to that website to that image to that video is this all making sense by God's grace so it actually affects the human Spirit by training your mind what's that called what we say that was a stronghold amen glory a stronghold the stronghold in the human spirit that makes you feel bonded or connected with sin bonded or connected with anything that's outside the will of God stronghold now I want to go a little bit further okay 1121 okay yes we're doing pretty good I preach about hour and half I'll try to bring this down to the close I know I couldn't finish this but I should like to um let me pray here Lord Jesus um here's some signs when uh I'm reading this for the wives maybe streaming or here I'm reading this for the wives uh signs that your husband might be watching lust the first one is his uh his Desires in the bedroom of changeed I just read like that number two he might lose interest in the physical act of coming together see because that pathway is not being refreshed that pathway is not being strengthened now he's got a different Pathway to the computer or the maybe it's the wh house or whatever more that's a rough word you know what I'm saying red light district I'll say like that forgive me but the word hormonger is a Bible word right they actually lose interest in his wife because he has all these connections and bonds with other things outside the word uh he might even lose the ability to be intimate physically because that connection is no longer there with a with with his wife anymore he might even lose the physical ability to have that um number four the man spends excessive amount of time online and gets upset if he can't surf the Internet or have his private time on the internet that's one sign the man might be into things he's not oh he shouldn't be it during family time he's away online with a computer or phone or something like that another way is their internet history is always empty right because Inter internet history keeps all the websites aren't you glad God whites away our history praise the Lord how about times we've gone to the wrong websites or seen something aren't you glad God wipes that all way Mercy Jesus all the evil things we've said or done or something like that God wipes away all the history right the husband seems emotionally distant or withdrawn that's number six uh he number seven seems more antisocial so you don't want to live for others you don't care about others he just cares about his selfish desires number eight his financial patterns have changed maybe has new charges or new credit cards so his wife can't see his charges on his credit cards he can hide his addictions and his uh memberships on websites number nine he's secretive elusive evasive defensive he's nervous he's easily irritated easily bothered why are you coming in here and number 10 this is an important one I think we've seen uh well I I talked to other people not in this church but other people number 10 he becomes critical of his wife's physical appearance so now his wife isn't pretty enough why because he's made Beauty he has a new definition of beauty now all the videos all the images he's looking at why because he's formed new Pathways in his human Spirit he's got strongholds in his human spirit that need to be taken down those are signs that people have this kind of trouble is this okay is it making sense everybody is it brother Saints has been extremely helpful to me like I said I haven't struggled with these things for years and years and years but now it explains the trouble I did have and now it also helps me to know he gives me even more ammunition to know I got to stay away from all Temptations praise the Lord he gives me even more ammunition even more desire and Zeal to keep my life pure to make sure what I see and hear would please the Lord Jesus Christ Glory let me um just hit a few more scriptures and then I'll just close with that testimony there yeah let's let me close like this I think I'll preach another sermon on this Lord willing later maybe next Sunday or something like that there's a whole another Avenue another Direction I want to take it um it was a real blessing in there Minnesota the Lord kind of opened up some more things but let's close with a few scriptures okay let's go to uh 1 Corinthians 6:12 this scripture before I even became a preacher help me overcome all my addictions God is my witness I hung this scripture up in my room I was in college and it helped me overcome every addiction I've had 1 Corinthians 6:12 now remember this is right after he says such were some of you you were fornicators adulterers but you're washing the blood of Jesus right and verse 12 now look at verse 12 all things are lawful unto me but all things are not expedient or beneficial all things are lawful me but I will not be brought under the power of any when I first came in the message this scripture hit me like a ton of bricks I realized wow tobacco was a power why because there's a demon behind it right online addictions are a power because there's a demon of addiction behind it praise the Lord so I had to realize that this is a power this is something that's stronger than me myself so I've got to have somebody greater that's in me than he that's in the world don't you love that all right Psalms 1013 let's read that there I will not like this is exactly what job said I will not be brought under the power of any I will make a covenant with my eyes I should not look upon a me why would I do that I made a if I made a promise with my eyes why would I look upon a made I won't because I made a promise to God brother Bram said you're only as good as your word when you confess you have to say that in your heart and maybe out loud God I am finished with this trouble now I don't have to be lust it could be something else I'm finished with lying I'm finishing with gossip I'm finishing with being greedy or critical spirit I see a lot of that sometimes you know you know how you recognize a critical spirit is somebody that points out other people's wrongs and then does nothing of themselves to to to fix the problem praise the Lord for example someone might criticize a church well that's fine they might be wrong but what are you doing to help them out are you doing are we doing anything to help out the people people that were criticizing ever say that can you catch that critical spirit I've seen it so much lately people just want to poke point out every they did like they like they have the gift to discernment they might but they just point out everybody's else's wrongs and they're not doing anything to help out the people they're just being critics to make themselves look better church that's sad it makes me want to cry because in in the message we point out a lot of demons don't we thank God but if we're not doing anything to help out anybody then we're just being critical if we're not using these things that we know to overcome sin and become more like Christ we're just being critical that's what you see a lot of message churches are they just criticize criticize I should say message could be any any church could be all churches yeah they just criticize criticize and they do nothing to help the person that's Fallen we gotta be like the Good Samaritan we see somebody down let's try to lift him up by God's grace you can just stand there and criticize you got beat up you got robbed look at you but if you never help them out how they ever going to get heal you got to give them oil and wine you got to take them to the end take them to the host Glory because he's got two pence from Christ he's got the spirit and truth and that'll bring healing to the individual can you say Amen so I I'm just laying that in there I want to preach a whole sermon on that one day if I can I don't I used to be critical I don't want to be a critical spirit anymore because if I if I see sin I want to go help somebody out of it I got to pray and say Lord pray for them first how many can say Amen to that pray for them first don't fight back and don't gossip and spread to other people the Bible said if you got real love you won't you'll hide you'll hide people's sins if you got real love for them you'll hide it and then you'll go do something about it now your only option might be to pray like if someone won't fellowship with you because of the sin or whatever your only option might be to pray well then you just pray and God will work it out let's not be critical make ourselves a judge and this wrong yeah we could all say that you could you can hang around me for a few hours you're going to say yes you're wrong with this people come to this church and they can find faults with anything they could preach a whole sermon on all the faults in our church and it might be true but what are they doing to help us out are you with be church what good does it do to point out all my errors if you don't show me how to fix it Glory that's the beauty of the right kind of discernment it will correct you by showing you the right path to walk in that's why I'm trying to do that by the grace of God God not to have a critical spirit because that only exalts a human but to have a spirit of Correction okay this is wrong now here apply this bone apply healing or go to that person oneon-one talk to them about it that'll bring healing pray until you feel you have victory over this help somebody out I know I'm going long here about an hour and a half now by God's grace so forgive me okay yeah Psalms 1013 what I want to get into is bail worship and the Groves that's what I want to get into because that ties in with man caves I want to preach on man caves all these guys talk about going in their man cave they're going into a Grove and they're worshiping ba I I prove it I prove it by the word prove it by the word when they go down there and lust after they just put all things men love and lust it's it's a growth it's a secret Hideway sin is something they love to do I'm going to preach a whole sermon on that by God's grace do that sound good I see my Ministry is an my Ministry is an exposing sin I've seen that course it's in teaching as I'm a pastor when I go on evangelize that God has blessed my Ministry in such a way to expose sin and bring Deliverance to people's lives I just seen that's that's what's God's called me to do I gotta stay with what God called me to do Psalms 1013 um I'm not there but I'll get there in just a few turns of the beautiful Bible here okay I will set no Wicked thing before my eyes I hate the work of them that turn aside it shall not cleave to me now this is after he had contact with B Sheba what did he learn he said I will not set anything before my eyes that's wicked and I hate anything that will turn me aside from F see we got to when someone's involved in addictions they love it so much or they are slave to it so much they have to learn to hate it when I learn to hate my addictions wasn't long after a little prayer this guy was Overcomer by the grace of of Jesus Christ you got to hate your sin you got to want Victory more than anything over it by the grace of the Lord let's stand to our feet I read two more scriptures as you're standing go to Second Corinthians 104 and 5 so get your body moved a little bit here second Corinthians 104 and 5 and this will tie I just want to share this last testimony I shared a little bit you know during the 10th anniversary meetings how many glad you came to the house of the Lord today amen there's power in the blood of Jesus church there's power in the blood of Jesus to break every chain every addiction there's power second Corinthians 10:4 and5 for the weapons of our Warfare are not carnal But Mighty through God to the pulling down of strongholds that means Castle or Fortress where does that castle or Fortress get built in your mind you open your eyes to something and that thought if you entertain it start thinking about it it builds a fortress in your mind and now Satan's got a place remember the Bible said neither give place to the devil in Ephesians 4 don't give the devil a place in your thoughts well when I'm when I have my quiet time I like to get alone and think about this lustful activity I like to get alone and I just like to think about uh the biggest house or the all the money or all these things like that don't give Satan a stronghold in your mind it's got to be cast down you must tear down like Titus tore down the temple not to use that not to be sacriligious but you got to tear down Stone by Stone are you with me stone by Stone take down that Devil's stronghold how does it happen through repentance changing your habits because brother B said habits are spirits verse five casting down imagination so how do you overcome that brother Jess cast down your thinking well I love to imagine about maybe this happening or this relationship or that you've got to cast that down and say no I will will not I will not think about that I will not uh entertain those thoughts cast out imaginations and every High thing that exalts itself against the knowledge of God and bring into captivity every thought to The Obedience of Christ you got to arrest those thoughts so you're under arrest Glory The Keeper of the enforcer of the laws here the Holy Spirit Hallelujah the of the holy spirit is the enforcer he'll come and arrest all those false thoughts that are getting your mind and you got to cast it down say Jesus deliver me I'm not thinking about this give me your strength to cast this down and help me just to think about the things of God last one Mark 9:25 this is so beautiful to me when you get a deliverance and it never comes back here's what happened Mark 9:25 brother you got it bless your heart brother when Jesus saw that the people came running he rebuked the foul Spirit saying to him thou dumb and deaf spirit I charge thee come out of him and look at this enter enter no more into him Hallelujah remember the demons said they see the house that they got swept out of remember they got swept out they come back and it's clean they want to go back in Jesus says I've got power the spoken word to speak to that demon and say you leave and you ain't ever coming back look at the power of the spoken word how many thankful for that Hallelujah I've addictions to Tobacco evil videos Evil movies Sports all these addictions Church God's my witness they've never come back amen cussing swearing all kinds of evil things hating on people and and just condemning people criticizing people and when you get the Holy Spirit on you you can speak to that demon and say you're never coming back in the name of Jesus Christ not in the name of Jesse Smith because it'll come back but when you speak in the name of Jesus Christ you better believe that God Honors that because he gave us the keys to the kingdom how me love the Lord let me just share this testimony brother Lord you come whenever you're ready maybe play that Turn Your Eyes Upon Jesus Glory we went to up there in Minnesota I share a little bit of testimony but after the services like I told you the first sermon I preach was on Gideon and the Groves now I called it Gideon the sword of the Lord in Gideon but I F the Holy Spirit just led me to preach on the Groves and I I was real I was really dramatic I was acting it all out and you know acting out Gideon in this Dad and it was it awesome I just felt the anointing of the Lord and God's my witness there was numerous Brothers probably four or five brothers that all come up confessing lust they were hiding their sins away and the ones that were sincere I believe got a blessing that day but I realized the script these scriptures started coming to me I said' if you will confess that sin and expose the devil and say it out loud now I don't to say it loud enough somebody can hear it but you got to speak the word right Devil's got to hear you and you got to have faith behind that word because you can say anything but you got a faith behind it and we I just I was weeping and crying with these brothers to help them get victory over this lust battle because it's Every Man's Battle praise God it's Every Man's Battle brother if you're a healthy man it's your battle but depending on how much you give into it is how much you struggle if you learn to cast it down if you learn if you starve starve the lust of the Flesh and don't let those connections be made in your your human Spirit you can really get the victory to each so I was very thankful there the Lord dealt with those things numerous Brothers come up sharing very personal things and I said just said praise the Lord but the one that meant the most of me was on Sunday night I preached on waiting on the Lord's Visions out of habach and showed all these prophecies and then ended with a call for the baptism of the Holy Ghost and the first person was up there was a a mother such a wonderful little mother she was and these little children and everything like that and she's weeping and crying I said sister do you want the Holy Ghost and she said no I've got the Holy Ghost but I'm addicted to watching YouTube movies and TV stations and I slip away from my family my children and I hide out and I watch TV shows right because YouTube has their own original TV shows I said sister God bless you for confessing that I said say it out loud say Satan I expose you in the name of Jesus Christ she starts weep she start she was already weeping and crying Glory I said tell him today that you're casting down his stronghold in your life and say this and say you're never coming you're never entering into my mind anymore in the name of Jesus Christ and she did and she got down there at the altar I'm leaving the services after we probably prayed for 30 minutes half an hour afterwards people crying at the altar I walk out there I'm walking out with the brothers and she kind of comes up right to me and kind of stops me and says brother Jesse I just want to tell you this whole weekend was for me she said everything you preach on about the Groves and everything about this this was all for me and she said I I really enjoy your message Sunday night she said but really I wasn't Hardy listening because I just wanted to lay on the Altar and die out to my addiction she said thank you for coming and church I left six kids here with a wife that had no electricity in your house our house sick kids I left Six Sick six kids that were sick and a wife and flew out there to Minnesota to preach the word of God and if it was to help deliver that mother so she can walk in the fullness of the Holy Ghost it's worth it all it is a great sacrifice it's hard on families it's worth it all to see when the word of God is inspired from Heaven that the children of God are set free he whom the son has set free is free let's bow our heads here for a moment I appreciate your patience I got through about half the message so maybe nor next Sunday or something like that we can deal more with this home Wreckers the eyes of lust I want you to think about your home I want you to think about your private time or just you most most of us here I would say if you've been serving to God a long time you have enough conviction where you wouldn't sin outwardly and look at evil things while other people around you most of us would have that maybe that level of character maybe that level
