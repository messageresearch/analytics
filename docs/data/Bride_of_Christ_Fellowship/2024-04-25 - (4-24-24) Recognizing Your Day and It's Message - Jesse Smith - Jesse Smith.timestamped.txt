[0:00] uh here we can see the kind of the
[0:02] context here Hosea is rebuking the
[0:04] people of course and um let's read it
[0:07] here by God's grace
[0:09] so why don't we uh read one and two
[0:13] together then I'll read verse three by
[0:15] myself because it's a little bit longer
[0:16] there so let's read one and two together
[0:17] one two three come and let us return
[0:20] unto the Lord for he hath torn and he
[0:24] will heal us he has smitten and he will
[0:28] bind us up after two days will he revive
[0:32] us in the third day he will raise us up
[0:36] and we shall live in his sight now verse
[0:38] three then shall we know if we follow on
[0:41] to know the Lord his going forth is
[0:44] prepared as the morning and he shall
[0:46] come unto us as the rain as the latter
[0:48] and former Reign unto the Earth may God
[0:51] add His blessings to rema's word you may
[0:53] be seated praise
[0:58] God now I'm just skipping back back a
[1:00] little bit here uh God bless the live
[1:02] streamers did you start H thank you
[1:03] sweetie uh to to uh CI Scofield's brief
[1:07] notes he says Hosea was a contemporary
[1:09] of Amos in Israel and of Isaiah and
[1:13] Micah in Judah and his ministry
[1:16] continued after the first or Assyrian
[1:18] captivity of the northern kingdom
[1:20] according to 2 Kings 15 his style is
[1:22] abrupt metaphorical and
[1:24] figurative in this book Israel is
[1:27] Jehovah's adulterous wife reput
[1:29] repudiated But ultimately to be purified
[1:32] and restored this is hosea's distinctive
[1:34] message which may be summed up in his
[1:36] two words Lo am I not my people and am I
[1:41] My People Israel is not merely apostate
[1:43] and sinful that is said also but her sin
[1:46] takes its character from the exalted
[1:47] relationship into which she has been
[1:50] brought okay and if you're familiar you
[1:53] know uh chapter three was or chapter one
[1:54] two and three is about the prophet Hosea
[1:56] was called to marry a prostitute right
[1:59] Goomer
[2:00] and it was a sign to all of Israel right
[2:03] Goomer was a type of Israel being so
[2:05] unfaithful to Jehovah right but then God
[2:08] restores Goomer a beautiful type of God
[2:10] going to restore Israel praise God so uh
[2:14] we'll go to chapter six then here by
[2:15] God's grace I'm going to keep reading uh
[2:16] chapter 6 verse4 oh Ephraim what shall I
[2:18] do unto thee Oh Judah what shall I do
[2:20] unto thee for your goodness is as a
[2:22] morning cloud and as a early do it goeth
[2:24] way so there wasn't much goodness left
[2:27] in Israel okay verse 5 then therefore
[2:30] have I hewed them by the
[2:32] prophets I have slain them by the words
[2:36] of my mouth and thy judgments are as
[2:39] light that goeth forth so of course hug
[2:42] means to chop down like a tree right so
[2:45] God sent Prophet after Prophet to Israel
[2:47] right and each time the prophets were
[2:50] chopping them down the judgments repent
[2:52] or perish right and so each time the
[2:55] majority of the people failed to repent
[2:57] right so ultimately led to the Captivity
[3:00] and then we know God showed Daniel God
[3:01] was going to God brought him back right
[3:03] through zerubabel and so forth Ezra
[3:06] Nehemiah we know about that but here uh
[3:10] God says here's how he did it through
[3:11] prophets and the words of God's mouth
[3:14] and the judgments were like light verse
[3:16] six for I desired mercy and and not
[3:19] sacrifice and the knowledge of God more
[3:21] than burnt offerings now what's amazing
[3:24] church I mean I I don't know Simon
[3:26] talked about how much he loves animals
[3:27] how many love animals here the amazing
[3:29] amazing part to just hard to understand
[3:31] as much as we love animals Israel would
[3:34] uh would just sacrifice so many animals
[3:36] but without a real sincere heart you
[3:39] know they would they would go to the
[3:40] lengths of of examining the animal make
[3:42] sure it was a good sacrifice the priest
[3:44] could accept it they examined it and yet
[3:46] they would offer in
[3:48] vain right and the the the parallel to
[3:51] that is today people will go to church
[3:52] and pay ties and and do all kinds of
[3:55] religious acts but if their hearts not
[3:57] in it it's still in vain so we want a
[4:00] heart that's into our sacrifice
[4:01] Hallelujah we want a real genuine
[4:04] sacrifice brother McBride preached on
[4:06] that even with u you know fasting there
[4:08] as we looked at in Isaiah 58 Isaiah 58
[4:11] says they fasted they sought God every
[4:13] day but they only fasted in order to win
[4:15] an argument amongst themselves that's
[4:18] the only reason they would fast but God
[4:20] said the right kind of fast is to
[4:22] afflict your soul and then go feed the
[4:24] poor hallelujah clothe those that are
[4:27] they're naked that's what the Bible says
[4:29] and and then if you focus on others at
[4:31] the fast then God will bring your health
[4:33] forth speedily the Bible says he said
[4:36] then the Bible says then you'll call and
[4:38] I'll answer Hallelujah so we realize
[4:41] fasting is to be for other people praise
[4:43] God but I just think it's is amazing is
[4:46] my brother Simon loves animals you know
[4:48] and uh we love our chickens you know we
[4:50] love our animals too but to think you
[4:52] know what kind of condition someone
[4:53] would have to give in or to be in a a
[4:55] religious I mean an awful religious a
[4:59] bad spiritual state to see their animals
[5:01] killed and not change their life and not
[5:04] honor God right just just obey part of
[5:08] God's word but not all of God's word how
[5:10] many want to be a believer that obeys
[5:12] all of God's word hallelujah that's
[5:15] exactly right I just thought that I just
[5:16] didn't have that in my notes I just
[5:17] thought my what a amazing thing they
[5:19] would let their animals be burnt
[5:21] completely not eat any of the meat and
[5:22] just a total burn offering but then just
[5:25] leave church the same way they came man
[5:28] brother Brooks said this many times
[5:30] maybe I'm kind of preaching for him
[5:31] because he'll be here this weekend but
[5:33] uh brother Brooks said many times when I
[5:34] come to church I want to leave changed
[5:36] am and brother Brooks said he's learned
[5:39] that over the years you know my wife and
[5:40] I know when we first come in the message
[5:42] and everything it was so glorious but
[5:44] brother Brooks has told us you know he
[5:46] used to focus so much on the the noise
[5:48] and the the worship and the the clapping
[5:50] and you had to have a loud clap had to
[5:51] have a loud shout you know loud scream
[5:54] but brother Brook said he learned over
[5:56] the years that's fine but if your life
[5:58] isn't changed after the service it
[6:00] doesn't do any good right right and we
[6:03] get the same idea here what good is
[6:05] animal sacrifices if your life isn't
[6:08] changed Hallelujah verse so just
[6:11] important there to know verse 7even but
[6:13] they like men have transgressed the
[6:14] Covenant they there they have dealt
[6:16] treacherously against me so see they
[6:19] sacrifice animals they go through all
[6:20] this religious acts but they transgress
[6:23] other elements of the
[6:25] Covenant and church let's just be honest
[6:27] you know God knows our hearts Hal
[6:30] and God knows if we want to keep the
[6:31] Covenant Hallelujah God will help us
[6:34] keep the Covenant Hallelujah if we
[6:36] really want to keep it God will help us
[6:37] do it Hallelujah but we have to be
[6:40] willing to surrender everything to God
[6:43] and we know church we know we're the
[6:44] we're the one who gets to look in the
[6:45] mirror every night right before bed we
[6:47] know forgiving all we can for Jesus
[6:49] Christ Hallelujah and any shortcomings
[6:51] at the end of the day what do we say
[6:52] Lord Jesus forgive me help me tomorrow
[6:55] Hallelujah let me be an overcomer let me
[6:57] wake up with new mercies tomorrow
[6:59] morning Hallelujah verse 8 Gilead is a
[7:02] city of them that work iniquity and is
[7:04] polluted with blood so again look at
[7:06] this idea of iniquity make God help us
[7:08] not to be workers of iniquity iniquity
[7:11] means lawlessness so see church if if if
[7:14] if the holy spirit is convicting you to
[7:15] keep the word of God you are not a
[7:17] worker of iniquity you're a worker of
[7:20] righteousness see and make sure our
[7:22] works aren't polluted you know are we
[7:25] have to ex ask ourselves is there any
[7:27] pollution in our text messages is there
[7:29] is there any pollution in our emails is
[7:31] there any pollution in what we're
[7:32] setting before our eyes is there any
[7:35] pollution in our words may God help us
[7:37] to have pure words Hallelujah pure
[7:40] actions P pure motive and objective
[7:42] Hallelujah is the motive and objective
[7:44] pure amen hallelujah so see we get a lot
[7:47] of good understanding in here we can
[7:48] apply to the New Testament right because
[7:51] Jesus said in Matthew 7 uh many will
[7:53] come in that and they say Lord did we
[7:54] not cast out Devils did we not prophesy
[7:56] in thy name and done many everybody say
[7:58] many
[8:00] many wonderful works these these were
[8:02] people that did many wonderful works and
[8:04] they'll say depart from me you workers
[8:06] of iniquity I never knew you because you
[8:08] did not do the will of my
[8:10] father that's interesting people can do
[8:13] Supernatural Miracles and prophecies but
[8:15] that isn't all the will of the father
[8:18] there's more to the message there's more
[8:20] to the Bible than just Supernatural
[8:23] works there's obedience hallelujah amen
[8:26] but we got to have both Hallelujah by
[8:27] God's grace amen
[8:30] now verse eight and as troops of robbers
[8:33] wait for a man so the company of priests
[8:34] murder in the way by consent for they
[8:37] commit lewdness now murder now remember
[8:39] Jesus says for us we none of us are
[8:41] murderers of course but Jesus said if
[8:43] you call your brother a fool without a
[8:45] cause you're in danger of Hellfire he
[8:48] says right of course Jesus is going to
[8:51] Great Lengths like hyperbole right he
[8:54] says pluck out your eye if you're
[8:55] lusting right cut off your hand if
[8:56] you're stealing he's he's showing us
[8:59] these these are serious matters if you
[9:00] don't stop that sin it's going to
[9:02] control you it's going to take your life
[9:04] you got to go to Every length to live a
[9:06] Pure Life
[9:07] Hallelujah go to go to the lengths
[9:10] necessary to live a pure and Godly life
[9:13] Hallelujah verse 10 I have seen a
[9:15] horrible thing in the house of Israel
[9:16] there is whoredom of Ephraim Israel is
[9:19] defiled now of course this could be
[9:21] natural whoredom like adulteries or
[9:23] fornications or homosexuality or
[9:26] beastiality or it could also be
[9:28] spiritual whoredoms remember we saw the
[9:29] quote brother Simon preach it on
[9:32] Sunday the same spirit that produces
[9:35] natural adultery or fornication is the
[9:37] Same Spirit of denominations and
[9:39] Antichrist Spirits Same Same Spirit
[9:42] think about that when a person falls in
[9:44] love with their church more than they
[9:46] fall in love with the word of God right
[9:48] and the way to know is you ask them uh
[9:51] well what what's true is the Bible true
[9:53] is your Church's Creed true and if they
[9:56] side with their Church it shows they
[9:57] love their church more than God's will
[9:59] word right is God is God three persons
[10:01] or one well if you love your church
[10:03] you'll say three persons right but if
[10:06] you love God you'll say God's one person
[10:08] Hallelujah that's true Hallelujah if you
[10:12] love your church you'll say well father
[10:14] son Holy Ghost sprinklings okay but if
[10:16] you love God you'll say full immersion
[10:18] in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ
[10:20] baptism right if you love your church
[10:22] you'll say women can preach but if you
[10:24] love God's word you'll say women are not
[10:26] called to have authority over men
[10:28] Hallelujah that's that's the word of God
[10:31] Amen that's right amen glory verse 11
[10:36] also oh Judah he has set in Harvest for
[10:38] thee when I return to the Captivity of
[10:40] my people course speaking of when they
[10:41] come back right with Zur he's speaking
[10:44] of the Harvest there okay now I got a
[10:46] lot of quotes from Brother brandom here
[10:48] I'll try to get through uh as much as I
[10:50] can here by the grace of God now we seen
[10:53] that song then I heard recognizing your
[10:55] day anybody raise your hand if you've
[10:57] heard that sermon who's heard that
[10:58] sermon anybody heard that one lately
[11:00] okay maybe maybe one late one okay great
[11:04] great message I encourage you it's less
[11:06] than two hours so if you haven't
[11:07] listened to it i' would encourage you go
[11:08] listen to it I'm going to just hit the
[11:10] highlights here brother random reads
[11:12] Hosea 6 and says this is a type or a
[11:15] foreshadow of the condition we're
[11:17] currently in right now right and it's
[11:20] true right God's people were backsliding
[11:22] and if you look at America and most
[11:24] Christian churches most Christian
[11:25] churches are
[11:27] backsliding right because they add to
[11:29] the word of God or they take away and
[11:30] there's severe repercussions for that
[11:34] right so brother Adam says now he says
[11:37] in the 12th paragraph I want to say that
[11:39] this has been the hardest message I ever
[11:41] did try to prepare until last night
[11:44] brother Ram goes through all these
[11:45] things he went through he was it was hot
[11:49] he was tired he was falling asleep just
[11:51] fun kind of funny he ate some corn the
[11:54] night before and it didn't sit well in
[11:55] his stomach so he felt sick and he tried
[11:58] for a couple of days days to get a
[11:59] thought and he couldn't get a thought he
[12:01] said he went down to the basement to
[12:03] cool down and he fell asleep trying to
[12:04] read his Bible and as a preacher I can
[12:06] say Amen sometimes I've been so tired
[12:08] I've tried to study but I fall asleep
[12:10] sometimes right most preachers can
[12:12] relate to that or anybody trying to
[12:14] study right try to study God's word you
[12:16] fall
[12:17] asleep said it was just so hot there in
[12:19] uh uh this would have been uh
[12:23] July he said uh but then he said about 8
[12:26] o'clock this morning so 8 o'clock on
[12:28] that Sunday morning he happened to pick
[12:30] up that scripture and that astounded me
[12:32] so think about that Hosea 61-13 the
[12:34] whole chapter astounded brother
[12:37] brandom he said uh so it may seem the
[12:39] Lord has a message for us this morning
[12:42] that Satan has tried to keep from us
[12:45] hallelujah and then I just want to say
[12:47] you know brother Ram says this message
[12:48] here uh recognizing your day and it's
[12:51] message he says is a teaching message he
[12:53] said I had two other services or sermons
[12:56] I was going to preach on broken sisters
[12:58] how many heard that one
[12:59] all right okay and then sewing to the
[13:02] wind and we reaping the Whirlwind
[13:04] brother Ram said those are just he said
[13:05] just gospel messages so brother R says
[13:08] there's two kind of sermons there's
[13:09] teaching sermons and there's just
[13:11] general gospel good news messages okay
[13:14] that's important to know because there's
[13:16] that that's still true today there's
[13:17] deep teaching and then there's also just
[13:19] general uh truth that we declare called
[13:21] gospel messages right um the Bible said
[13:24] Jesus the Bible calls it preaching and
[13:26] teaching the Bible said John the Baptist
[13:28] Jesus and the the apostles they went
[13:30] preaching and
[13:31] teaching okay so when they had to really
[13:33] instruct to show somebody how to do
[13:35] something or something important they
[13:37] would teach it through the word of God
[13:39] they instruction instruction instruction
[13:42] but if there's just a a if there's just
[13:43] a a preaching message just to declare
[13:46] what God is and what God's done then we
[13:48] just call it a preaching sermon
[13:49] preaching means to declare hallelujah
[13:52] thank the Lord amen so remember just two
[13:55] kinds uh there there's two kinds of
[13:57] services preaching and teaching
[14:01] Hallelujah now as brother Rams praying
[14:03] before he reads his text he said dear
[14:05] God we're unworthy to take this book
[14:07] into our hands for we read in the
[14:08] scripture that no man in heaven or Earth
[14:10] or beneath Earth was worthy to even take
[14:12] the book or look upon it how many
[14:15] remember that Revelation chapter
[14:17] 5 he says but one like a lamb came and
[14:20] took the book he looked like he'd been
[14:22] slain he was worthy and we're looking to
[14:26] him this morning to reveal that these
[14:27] contents that's written the book because
[14:29] it's the book of redemption hallelujah
[14:32] amen so church that's what we need
[14:34] tonight we need Jesus to reveal the
[14:36] contents of this scripture to us tonight
[14:38] hallelujah amen and then he reads Hosea
[14:42] 6
[14:43] 1-1 now the next thought he brings out
[14:46] that the ones I'm going to
[14:48] highlight brother Ram said uh now the
[14:51] week before he preached on the the
[14:52] trumpet the trumpets of Israel the seven
[14:55] trumpets he said and I thought they
[14:57] would Break Forth just like like the
[14:59] Seven Seals did now who remembers how
[15:01] the Seven Seals broke open every day the
[15:04] Holy Ghost would visit brother brandom
[15:05] and show him the Revelation on the seal
[15:08] and then he'd spend the rest of the day'
[15:09] see a vision or a dream or an angel will
[15:11] visit him he'd spend the rest of the day
[15:12] going through the concordance and making
[15:14] sure this Revelation lined up with the
[15:16] Bible because galatian 1 said though we
[15:19] or an angel preach anything other than
[15:21] what we've received let it be cursed
[15:23] amen that's a real Prophet right there
[15:26] an angel would visit brother Ram shown
[15:28] the revelation he take the rest of the
[15:30] day to make sure that angel was the
[15:31] right kind of Angel that's a real man of
[15:34] God brother Ram said though I thought
[15:36] the the trumpets now remember the seven
[15:38] trumpets right in Revelation chapter 8
[15:41] and
[15:42] N he said I thought they would break
[15:44] open just like that he said but they
[15:48] didn't he said I've noticed he said uh
[15:52] that it was different and so we'll get
[15:54] to the answer in just a little bit here
[15:55] by God's grace Hallelujah
[15:59] now the next quote I want to read is
[16:00] brother Ram said you see before the
[16:02] Seven Seals that hid all the mysteries
[16:04] of the Bible so when brother Ram uh was
[16:07] led by the Holy Spirit to give us the
[16:09] revelations of the Seven Seals from the
[16:11] Holy Spirit it gave us Insight on all
[16:14] the Mysteries and that's what I wrote my
[16:16] 2021 book about the 12 New Testament
[16:19] Mysteries he said and he said uh these
[16:22] things are revealed so we'll know the
[16:24] very spiritual application of this
[16:27] hour and then he said the next next
[16:29] message that opened up the Seven Seals
[16:31] which undone all the hidden mysteries of
[16:33] the Bible the doctrines and so forth so
[16:36] brother Ram tells us when he got the
[16:38] revelation of the Seven Seals it was
[16:39] March
[16:40] 1963 all the symbols in there of the
[16:42] horse riders the colors right all the
[16:45] symbols of the Seven Seals gave
[16:47] interpretation helped us interpret
[16:50] interpret the rest of the scripture
[16:52] hallelujah amen hallelujah because we
[16:56] see that we see that in Revelation uh
[16:58] six Jesus Takes the the seals he breaks
[17:01] the seals in Revelation 10 that open
[17:03] book now comes down to earth right and
[17:07] and a seventh angel finishes the mystery
[17:09] of God that was brother br's Ministry
[17:11] and then John said I've got to eat it I
[17:13] got to take it to Every Nation well
[17:14] anyone that studies history knows John
[17:15] never did that so that means somebody
[17:18] else like John it would be the Believers
[17:20] the Believers would have to eat the
[17:21] Revelation and then prophesy again to
[17:24] many kindreds nations peoples and
[17:26] tongues amen and then that goes with
[17:28] Matthew 24:14 Jesus said the end cannot
[17:31] come until the gospel has been preached
[17:33] to Every
[17:34] Nation so every nation still needs to
[17:36] hear the Revelation that God gave to
[17:39] brother brandom that's the best that I
[17:40] can understand it by God's grace amen
[17:44] hallelujah now the next I want to just
[17:46] read this one here uh brother R was
[17:48] talking about he says another thing he
[17:51] said the Bible said whoever whoever will
[17:53] take one word away or add one word to it
[17:56] in Revelation 2218 and 19 he said said
[17:59] people put their own interpretation upon
[18:01] the word as it's been given trying to
[18:03] make it say something it did not say and
[18:05] he said and not my word it's his
[18:08] word so clearly brother R was saying
[18:11] it's not every word on my sermons it's
[18:13] the word that comes from the Holy Spirit
[18:16] that's the word you can't add to that's
[18:18] the word you can't take away from
[18:20] Hallelujah this right here hallelujah
[18:23] amen that's exactly right now brother
[18:27] Brandon wanted to preach those seven
[18:28] trumpets of Revelation 8 and9 he said I
[18:32] told my wife I'm going in to pray and I
[18:35] sincerely knelt down before God to pray
[18:38] and he revealed to me them seven
[18:40] trumpets sounded under the six seal and
[18:43] I've already done preached it
[18:46] supernaturally hallelujah praise God see
[18:49] it's the hand of God the whole thing it
[18:51] pertains to Israel amen so see Church
[18:53] the seven trumpets pertain to Israel
[18:56] Hallelujah that's right and we picked it
[18:58] up on under the Sixth Seal all you who
[19:00] have that now how the persecution of the
[19:02] Jews now if you got your Bible go to
[19:04] Revelation 6 keep your spot there in
[19:05] Hosea if you want to go to Revelation 6
[19:08] let's read that six seal by God's grace
[19:10] now how many was expecting a book of
[19:11] Roman sermons tonight
[19:13] Hallelujah I about did but then I was
[19:15] like well I got six hours to drive I
[19:16] need to hear some more from Brother
[19:18] bradam here by God's grace I've always
[19:19] wanted to preach those five sermons see
[19:21] you kind of close together so you when
[19:23] you sang that song you'd appreciate that
[19:25] song If you haven't heard the message of
[19:27] Grace go listen to that one I heard that
[19:28] that years ago I preached on that years
[19:29] ago it's a beautiful message brother R
[19:32] just shows how every believer amen down
[19:34] through the Old Testament New Testament
[19:35] every believer needed God's grace
[19:37] Hallelujah and we need it to we need it
[19:39] today Hallelujah even Paul said Jesus
[19:42] told him my grace is sufficient for you
[19:45] even when God doesn't answer God doesn't
[19:47] heal God doesn't do something you want
[19:49] God's grace is still sufficient
[19:51] hallelujah it's still by Grace not by
[19:54] works it's the grace of almighty God
[19:57] remember Paul said I labored more more
[19:59] than all the apostles not I but the
[20:01] grace of God that was given to me
[20:03] Hallelujah it all goes back to Grace
[20:05] Hallelujah so let's go to Revelation 6 I
[20:08] believe it's I don't remember the verse
[20:10] maybe it's verse six Revelation 66 uh 69
[20:13] Hallelujah Revelation
[20:14] 69 so brother Ram said during this time
[20:18] this is a time period no I'm sorry it's
[20:19] not verse N9 it's verse 12 sorry
[20:21] Revelation
[20:22] 612 now verses 9 10 and 11 though deal
[20:25] with Israel We Believe brother Rod the
[20:27] souls under the altar were the blinded
[20:30] Jews that have been blinded since the
[20:32] days of Jesus
[20:33] crucifixion all the way to the current
[20:35] day because Revelation Romans 11 says
[20:39] Israel was blinded that God might Graft
[20:41] in the Gentiles now we believe that
[20:44] brother because brother brandom said
[20:45] thus sayith the Lord that's the
[20:47] interpretation so we just humbly we
[20:49] believe that was God it's it's quite a
[20:52] statement and and to prove it in in the
[20:54] fif seal they had the testimony for the
[20:57] word of God which they they didn't have
[20:58] the testimony for Jesus Christ that's
[21:01] also mentioned in Revelation chap 1 and
[21:03] then they say they asked for revenge for
[21:05] their blood and a Christian never asked
[21:07] for Revenge because Jesus said lay it
[21:09] not to their charge right and so did
[21:10] stepen step said don't lay it to their
[21:12] charge so only a person who wasn't born
[21:15] again would ask for
[21:17] revenge and then uh more of their
[21:19] servants had to be killed of course
[21:20] that's could be the 144,000 in the
[21:22] tribulation period we're not quite sure
[21:24] but there's more Jews that need to be
[21:25] killed um because they said let his
[21:28] blood be upon us and our children was
[21:30] that such a sad thing to say but that's
[21:32] what blinded people would say they would
[21:34] crucify their own Messiah that was sent
[21:36] to them but now verse 12 is where we
[21:38] want to go brother Ram said the seven
[21:40] trumpets were supernaturally preached
[21:42] they're part of The Sixth Seal in other
[21:44] words The Sixth Seal is the seven-year
[21:46] tribulation period now some people think
[21:48] it's three and a half I believe it's
[21:49] seven it don't matter it don't pertain
[21:51] to us anyway praise God so let's not get
[21:52] upset with each other let's love each
[21:54] other amen hallelujah let's hope it's
[21:56] three and a half years but I believe
[21:57] it's seven I mean I believe I can prove
[21:58] that by history Daniel 70 weeks of
[22:00] course and the scripture but it doesn't
[22:02] matter you know we just don't want to be
[22:03] here by God's grace we want to be with
[22:04] Jesus in Glory Hallelujah verse 12 and I
[22:07] beheld and lo when he had opened the
[22:09] sick seal Lo there was a great
[22:10] earthquake now that might be the
[22:11] earthquake brother bam said thus say the
[22:13] Lord Los Angeles will fall into the
[22:14] ocean that might be that I don't know
[22:17] and the sun became black as sackcloth of
[22:19] hair and the moon became as
[22:21] blood and the stars of Heaven fell into
[22:23] the Earth think about that what would
[22:24] one star do if it fell to the Earth this
[22:27] says the Stars
[22:29] so more than one star falls to the Earth
[22:32] even as a fig tree castes her untimely
[22:34] figs when she's shaken of A Mighty Wind
[22:36] and the heaven departed as a scroll when
[22:38] it's rolled together and every mountain
[22:39] and Island were moved out of their
[22:40] places think of Philippines right think
[22:42] of Japan think of Hawaii all these
[22:45] islands are moved out of their places
[22:47] verse 15 and the kings of the earth and
[22:49] the great men and the rich men and the
[22:50] chief captains and the Mighty Men And
[22:52] every Bond man every free man hid
[22:53] themselves in the dens and the rocks of
[22:55] the mountains and said of the mountains
[22:56] and rocks Fallen us and hide us from the
[22:58] face of him that sth on the throne and
[23:00] from the Lamb of sorry from the Wrath of
[23:02] the lamb for the great day of his wrath
[23:04] is come and who shall be able to
[23:07] stand and so we're not going to read it
[23:09] but if you read Revelation 8 and N is it
[23:11] 10 to let me check I can't no it's not
[23:13] 10 it's 8 just 8 nine that's right eight
[23:16] and
[23:17] nine yes 8 n there's seven trumpets and
[23:22] it all speaks of judgment each of the
[23:24] seven trumpets speak even the first one
[23:26] a third of the waters turned to blood
[23:28] and a third of all the trees are burned
[23:31] with fire a third think about the Amazon
[23:33] rainforest a
[23:35] third just on the first trumpet that's
[23:38] God's Wrath that's not God's mercy
[23:39] that's God's judgment but brother ad
[23:42] said see I was I thought when I preached
[23:43] the the the seven trumpets they'd open
[23:45] up just like the Seven Seals but brother
[23:47] man said I already preach them they're
[23:48] part of The Sixth Seal they're part of
[23:50] the Great Tribulation period all right
[23:53] now that might be a little deeper so I'm
[23:54] sorry if that's a little
[23:55] deeper now I want you to go back to uh
[24:00] Hosea 6 I hope you kept your spot there
[24:02] I I said I guess I didn't tell you to do
[24:03] it for sure
[24:07] but verse two Hosea 62 after two days
[24:11] he'll revive us in the third day he'll
[24:13] raise us up and we shall live in his
[24:15] sight now brother Bram starts preaching
[24:17] at this
[24:18] point and brother brandom says after two
[24:21] days means after 2,000 years God will
[24:25] raise Israel up and I think that's
[24:27] absolutely right
[24:29] if Jesus was crucified around 30 or 33
[24:31] ad look Church we're coming up to the
[24:33] 2,000 years we are getting very
[24:36] close because the B Peter said a day
[24:38] with the Lord right is as a thousand
[24:40] years with
[24:41] man so brother R he prophetically says
[24:44] Hosea was prophesying to Israel after
[24:47] two two days after 2,000 years I'm going
[24:50] to revive you through the 144,000 of
[24:52] Revelation chapter 7 12,000 from each
[24:55] tribe hallelujah amen
[24:59] Hallelujah and then the third day so
[25:01] beginning that third thousand year right
[25:03] because after 2,000 years you begin that
[25:05] third day or that third group of a
[25:07] thousand uh
[25:09] Years brother bam said oh how thankful
[25:12] how no wonder we're so grateful I feel
[25:14] we're not grateful enough for the great
[25:15] things God is making known to us he said
[25:19] my he said after two days he'll revive
[25:21] us he said give us a Revival bring us
[25:24] together he's speaking of the Jews on
[25:26] these trumpets
[25:29] Hallelujah and we shall live in his
[25:31] sight again or have eternal life we'll
[25:33] be in his sight again the Bible said
[25:35] here in Hosea we shall live in his sight
[25:37] that's his own life eternal life right
[25:39] because there's only one kind of life
[25:41] that's that's going to be Eternal that's
[25:43] God's life Allelujah there's natural
[25:46] life we live and die and that's true but
[25:49] God's life is the only eternal life
[25:51] Hallelujah God's going to give us life
[25:53] we want eternal life where we'll never
[25:56] die Hallelujah
[25:59] and then brother man brings out that
[26:01] great scripture out of Timothy she that
[26:03] liveth in pleasure is dead while she's
[26:04] alive that's speaking of the Soul right
[26:07] because a woman who live lives in
[26:09] pleasure she's alive naturally her
[26:10] body's got natural life but her soul is
[26:13] not quickened right Paul said we were
[26:16] dead in sins but we've been quickened by
[26:17] the life of God hallelujah amen in
[26:19] Ephesians chapter 2 glory amen
[26:24] hallelujah Glory he said after two days
[26:28] in the third day he'll revive us again
[26:30] and give us life in his sight there's
[26:32] your trumpets coming in that's the hour
[26:34] We're living the day that we're living
[26:39] Hallelujah now brother Ram brings this
[26:41] thought out here brother Ram said there
[26:42] was a magazine in' 64 it was called The
[26:44] Herald of his coming now I've never seen
[26:46] that one he said uh brother Jack Moore
[26:49] and his wife put that magazine out do
[26:51] you know Jack Moore brother okay he was
[26:53] associated with brother brandom for the
[26:54] beginning part of brother br's Ministry
[26:56] Jack Moore he was a Pentecostal Man by
[26:59] God's grace but they put out this um he
[27:02] said they put out their magazine the
[27:03] Herold of his coming now if you've been
[27:06] around the message for a while you've
[27:07] heard this quote before so just bear
[27:08] with me if you haven't uh then probably
[27:11] haven't been around the message too long
[27:13] but it's okay so he said their magazine
[27:16] you see it all the time they say fast
[27:18] pray fast pray it's all you hear fast
[27:20] pray we're going to have a great
[27:21] breaking of the day this is a great
[27:23] thing going to happen all of you pray
[27:25] pray pray we're not too late yet
[27:29] he says now why do they do that they
[27:31] want a Great Awakening they're crying
[27:33] believing they'll be Awakening they're
[27:34] good people why is it what have they
[27:36] done now look what he says here this is
[27:37] the quote I'm going to say they haven't
[27:39] recognized The Awakening of the
[27:42] Bride so brother saying there's these
[27:44] Pentecostal people they're saying fast
[27:46] and pray we might have a Revival might
[27:48] have Awakening yet but brother man said
[27:50] the bride has already been awakened
[27:52] through his ministry I know that sounds
[27:54] crazy but that's what every Prophet had
[27:56] Hallelujah right you the only way you
[27:58] could be awakened in John the Baptist
[28:00] day is to receive John the
[28:02] Baptist right I mean it's it was that
[28:04] way every day Hallelujah and the proof
[28:06] of it brother Ram said was all these
[28:07] Pentecostal people that rejected his
[28:09] message they broke the word of God they
[28:11] had adulteries fornications the women
[28:13] cut their hair and God never asked a
[28:15] Godly woman to ever cut her hair right
[28:17] she wore makeup and paint she painted
[28:19] her face up uh living worldly doing all
[28:22] these kind of sins men smoking
[28:23] cigarettes and doing all kinds of
[28:24] wickedness watching dirty movies dirty
[28:26] magazines and calling themselves is
[28:28] Pentecostal that's not Pentecostal amen
[28:31] Pentecostal is Holiness with power
[28:33] Hallelujah Holiness with power I'll just
[28:36] say this humbly I believe the power of
[28:39] just last Wednesday night's prayer
[28:40] allowed that young man to get saved
[28:42] That's The Power of Pentecost if I can't
[28:44] do it God will send somebody to do it
[28:46] praise God Amen just in the Simplicity
[28:49] of prayer and sincerity
[28:52] Hallelujah because we don't live worldly
[28:54] lives we sh we we do all we can to shun
[28:56] evil amen we do all we can Church to
[28:59] abstain from wickedness
[29:01] Hallelujah daily confessing our
[29:04] sins Hallelujah recognizing if the
[29:07] Bible's right and I'm wrong then I want
[29:08] to I want to be right I want to confess
[29:10] and I want to be like the Bible amen I
[29:12] want to obey the Bible not uh not not a
[29:15] Creed not a church not a denomination I
[29:17] want to be a real Christian hallelujah
[29:19] amen glory so brother said they haven't
[29:22] awaken recognized The Awakening of the
[29:24] Bride but by being a Christian they feel
[29:26] the pull of the hour
[29:29] but they haven't recognized what's been
[29:31] done that's what's making them feel that
[29:33] way they know something's supposed to
[29:34] happen but you see they're looking for
[29:35] it the way off in the future to come but
[29:37] it's already happened right by you so
[29:40] think about that brother BR my
[29:42] goodness brother R if you haven't
[29:44] listened to one of his sermons he'll
[29:45] bring up sometimes five 10 15 people and
[29:47] just tell them the thoughts and intents
[29:49] of their heart I mean there's no way a
[29:51] man could memorize that many details
[29:52] about somebody I don't care what they
[29:53] say oh he can memorize those prayer
[29:55] cards no way not after preaching through
[29:56] hours amen it's impossible and they
[29:59] didn't have those ear devices back then
[30:00] it was a gift of God Amen he's standing
[30:03] there and said I'm waiting I can't do it
[30:05] I'm waiting for the angel of the Lord to
[30:06] come
[30:07] Hallelujah
[30:10] glory and the Pentecost people would say
[30:12] oh we like his gift but we don't like
[30:14] his Doctrine well if his Doctrine is the
[30:15] Bible then you don't like the
[30:17] Bible I listened to a podcast this week
[30:20] and they went through you know how or
[30:21] Roberts was off the word uh you know
[30:23] into money and prosperity and they named
[30:26] all these other guys that fell into I
[30:28] think a Allen fell into alcohol and God
[30:30] for go God forgive me if I'm wrong but
[30:32] they just went through all these sins
[30:33] and this person went into fornication
[30:34] adultery and the only negative thing
[30:36] they could say about brother brandom was
[30:38] he got off on his Doctrine but anybody
[30:40] that studies it knows it's the right
[30:42] Doctrine right no women preaches there's
[30:44] no Trinity hell doesn't last
[30:47] eternally right it was created for the
[30:49] devil and Angels if it had a beginning
[30:50] it's got to have an
[30:51] ending right all these Revelations God
[30:55] gave to brother Brandon with thus sayeth
[30:56] the Lord and we can back it up by the
[30:59] Bible Hallelujah I just I was so happy
[31:01] listen to that even though they were
[31:02] bashing our Prophet I was so happy
[31:04] that's the only thing they can say they
[31:06] don't agree with his Doctrine but he
[31:07] lived a holy life and the power of the
[31:09] Holy Ghost was on his life amen Glory
[31:11] Hallelujah they just disagree with his
[31:14] Doctrine amen hallelujah and then
[31:16] brother R would challenge them and say
[31:17] there's 400 preachers out there he said
[31:19] come he said you disagree with me on the
[31:21] serpant seat on the water baptism on no
[31:23] women preachers he said I challenge you
[31:25] bring your Bible up here and stand
[31:26] before me and disprove me now he said it
[31:28] was the quietest group of preachers you
[31:29] ever
[31:30] heard see in the presence of that angel
[31:32] they wouldn't challenge the angel of the
[31:34] Lord hallelujah it's exactly
[31:40] right and brother Ram said what are they
[31:42] doing he said those Pentecostals were
[31:46] fasting and praying believing for the
[31:48] ministry of the two prophets let's read
[31:50] the ministry of the two prophets keep
[31:51] your spot there in Hosea go to
[31:53] Revelation
[31:56] 11 so hope by the end of this you'll be
[31:58] edified but I'm also hoping you'll be
[31:59] able we'll be able to sing that song
[32:00] with a little better understanding I'm
[32:02] so glad God let me here recognizing your
[32:05] day in this
[32:06] message amen it's Elementary it's very
[32:08] simple right it's a it's a wonderful
[32:10] simple message but I just want you to
[32:12] have an experience of it and know some
[32:15] of the major quotes in here and sermons
[32:17] and scriptures I'm sorry scriptures
[32:18] brother R used in this sermon okay
[32:21] everybody got that by God's grace okay
[32:23] now verse three Revelation 11:3 and I'll
[32:25] give power to my two witnesses and they
[32:27] shall prophesy 1,2003 score days clothe
[32:29] and sackcloth these are the two olive
[32:31] trees and the two candlesticks standing
[32:32] before the god of the earth that's also
[32:33] in Zechariah Chapter 4 and if any man
[32:36] will hurt them fire proceeds out of
[32:37] their mouth and devour their enemies and
[32:38] if any man will hurt them he must in
[32:40] this manner be
[32:41] killed these have power to shut the
[32:43] heaven that it rain out in the days of
[32:44] their prophecy and have power over
[32:46] Waters to turn them to blood and to
[32:48] Smite the Earth with all plagues as
[32:50] often as they
[32:52] will now see church this is what brother
[32:57] brother said this is is what the
[32:58] Pentecostals were praying for power like
[33:01] this to turn the waters to blood and and
[33:03] power to shut the heavens brother Ram
[33:05] said they're missing that's not for the
[33:07] Gentiles that's for the Jews and we just
[33:09] saw it with that solar eclipse didn't we
[33:11] we see all these Gentile preachers say
[33:12] this solar eclipse is and they use the
[33:14] scriptures they use these scriptures to
[33:16] say it's for the Gentiles and it's not
[33:18] they missed it those signs are for the
[33:20] Jews right everybody catch
[33:24] that they even use that verse where
[33:26] Jesus said uh uh the sign of Jonas will
[33:29] that's the only sign that will be given
[33:31] to this uh generation because they said
[33:34] the uh the path of the shadow of the
[33:35] solar eclipse passed through Seven
[33:37] Cities called
[33:38] Nineveh that's totally out of context
[33:41] when Jesus quoted that scripture he's
[33:42] saying the sign of Jonah is I'll be in
[33:45] the heart of the Earth from Friday to
[33:47] Sunday but I'll raise up Sunday morning
[33:49] Hallelujah that's the sign of Jonas
[33:51] amen not a solar eclipse or a lunar
[33:54] eclipse or any Eclipse that's not a sign
[33:56] to the Gentiles
[33:58] all of that is to the Jews so here we
[34:01] are what was that
[34:03] 64 59 I'm sorry 60 years 60 years ago
[34:08] and there we're still in the same
[34:09] condition the churches think all these
[34:12] signs all these signs and the blood moon
[34:14] and and the eclipse they think that's
[34:16] for the Gentiles no that's going to be
[34:17] for the Jews after the Rapture and they
[34:20] haven't recognized that God's got a
[34:22] bride awake do we have any bride members
[34:24] in here that are awake to the gospel
[34:26] Hallelujah I like a hearty Amen on that
[34:28] one by God's grace amen try not to pull
[34:31] I'm try not to beg to for too many amens
[34:33] Hallelujah I think we ought to have a
[34:34] hearty amen for that I know I was blind
[34:37] to denominations I know I'm awaken to
[34:39] the message of God hallelujah I know my
[34:42] life has changed Hallelujah the power of
[34:44] God is on my life it's on your life amen
[34:47] we're awakened to the the the the bride
[34:50] and the going home of the Bride of Jesus
[34:52] Christ the Gentile Rapture hallelujah
[34:55] we're awakened to that we're not going
[34:58] to miss that that's basically what
[34:59] brother sermon is about recognizing your
[35:01] day amen the Gentile Rapture and its
[35:04] message
[35:06] Hallelujah Oh Glory we see Pentecostals
[35:09] they get and other people too not just
[35:11] I'm not down in Pentecostals I love them
[35:12] I'm against the system I'm not against
[35:14] the people just like I'm I'm against I'm
[35:17] not against evangelicals I'm just
[35:18] against the denominational
[35:21] systems so whether it's Catholic or
[35:23] Protestant whatever it is uh
[35:25] denominational non-denominational we're
[35:27] against their transgressions of the word
[35:29] of God and their systems that won't
[35:31] allow them to accept more
[35:33] Revelation right they write their bylaws
[35:35] and that's it God can't do nothing else
[35:37] well shame on them they should have they
[35:40] should have ended their Creed with a
[35:41] comma brother and I ended my book with a
[35:43] comma just so you know as a tribute to
[35:45] brother brandom because brother Bram
[35:46] said all the Christians when you got a
[35:47] Doctrine you should end that Doctrine
[35:49] with a comma not a period I know
[35:51] everything we don't know
[35:52] everything but as much as God has
[35:55] revealed to us we keep that until more
[35:57] comes
[35:58] Hallelujah we know God will never bring
[36:01] us a a different Revelation than he's
[36:02] already give us but he'll give us more
[36:04] information about the same Revelation
[36:07] hallelujah oh I feel good tonight
[36:09] hallelujah praise God I didn't feel good
[36:11] a few hours ago so thank God for
[36:13] that we had some more attacks on our
[36:15] identity theft but I was really mad so I
[36:19] feel better now by God's grace took a
[36:21] little singing and a little repenting by
[36:22] God's
[36:23] grace my goodness these people are
[36:26] wicked anyways thank God for the Holy
[36:27] Ghost
[36:29] Hallelujah Now Catch This brother Ram
[36:31] said Hosea in in Hosea chapter 6 he said
[36:35] said the same thing John the Revelator
[36:37] said in in the leoan letter in
[36:41] Revelation 3 so let's read that we're
[36:42] already in Revelation 11 let's go to
[36:43] Revelation 3 I believe it's
[36:45] 14 I'm just kind of ballparking there
[36:49] the letter to Le
[36:50] oosa was it uh 14 oh it is 14 glory and
[36:55] the angel of the Church of leans write
[36:56] these things say at the amen the
[36:57] faithful and true witness the beginning
[36:59] of the creation of God I Know Thy works
[37:00] that thou are neither hot nor cold does
[37:01] that sound like Hosea they got iniquity
[37:03] they're murdering yet they're
[37:05] sacrificing animals they have a they
[37:08] have a form of godliness but denying the
[37:10] power thereof the power to live a holy
[37:12] life
[37:16] Hallelujah I would thou W cold or hot
[37:18] finishing 15 going to 16 so then because
[37:20] thou are lukewarm and neither cold nor
[37:22] hot I will spew thee out of my mouth
[37:23] because thou sayest I'm rich and
[37:25] increased with goods and have need of
[37:26] nothing and knowest not that thou are
[37:27] wretched and miserable and poor and
[37:29] blind and naked I counsel thee to buy of
[37:32] me gold tried in the fire now gold is
[37:34] time tested Faith that's what Peter said
[37:36] the trying of your faith is more
[37:37] precious than what good church good and
[37:41] that thou mayest be rich and white
[37:43] reignment that thou mayest be clothed
[37:44] now white Rond is Jesus's rightousness
[37:47] right Revelation 19 tells us that so the
[37:51] way you the way you have white rment on
[37:53] is you accept Jesus righteous and not
[37:55] try to make your own righteousness amen
[37:57] I have no righteousness brother Rod
[37:59] sister Zer I have no righteousness if
[38:01] anything good comes out of my life it's
[38:03] Christ righteousness hallelujah
[38:06] amen that thou mayest be clothed and
[38:09] that th shame of thy nakedness do not
[38:10] appear and anoint thine eyes with Isa
[38:12] that thou mayest see eyes is always
[38:14] understanding Enlightenment the Bible
[38:16] said Paul said our eyes must be
[38:17] enlightened with understanding so it's
[38:20] spiritual understanding as many as I
[38:23] love I baby no did I read that right no
[38:27] as many as I love I rebuke and chasen be
[38:31] zealous therefore and repent brother Ram
[38:33] said the same spirit that spoke through
[38:35] Hosea spoke through John and said then
[38:37] the church in the last days will be
[38:38] naked blind and will put him outside the
[38:40] church remember he's on the church
[38:42] saying let me in outside the church
[38:43] saying let me in the church now of
[38:45] course that can apply to the individual
[38:46] but also the church because we know a
[38:47] lot of churches I'm sure robod does too
[38:49] we know a lot of churches where the Holy
[38:50] Ghost can't even get inside one of the
[38:53] members right he can't even convince one
[38:56] member to repent of their
[38:57] sins right but yet they go through the
[38:59] works they go through the acts they go
[39:01] through the sacrifices but they haven't
[39:03] repented of their sins Hallelujah
[39:05] because their churches allow them to
[39:07] live in
[39:08] sin that's right yeah they encourage it
[39:12] absolutely so isn't that something who
[39:14] would have thought who would have
[39:15] thought uh if you read Hosea last week
[39:17] who would have thought if you read Hosea
[39:18] 6 wow that's just what John said but the
[39:20] Holy Ghost showed to brother Brandon and
[39:22] church remember I preached uh remember
[39:24] when I preached the Christian family the
[39:26] prosperity trap
[39:28] all those verses are applying to the ly
[39:30] and church age because they're rich and
[39:32] increased with good Havey nothing in
[39:33] other words always Israel once they got
[39:35] the blessing they got rich that's when
[39:36] they forgot about God it's a general
[39:39] principle like I'm just saying right
[39:40] it's it's not nothing you haven't heard
[39:41] before I'm just saying just apply that
[39:43] to today Hosea said they were Rich they
[39:46] were sacrificing but they didn't repent
[39:47] they weren't repenting they were just
[39:50] sacrificing right but the sacrifices of
[39:53] God are a broken and contrite heart when
[39:56] was the last time you cried over your
[39:57] sin when was the last time we cried over
[39:59] someone else's sin that's what we need a
[40:01] a sincerity a humility praise God a
[40:04] hatred for
[40:05] sin
[40:09] Hallelujah he said they just didn't get
[40:12] it those uh Jews of hosea's day much
[40:15] like the Jews of Old Times blinded leod
[40:16] DEA today riches theology hostile with
[40:18] the church hostile towards the message
[40:20] aren't they hostile towards brother R's
[40:22] message look how hostile those Jews was
[40:25] with John look how hostile they were
[40:26] with Jesus Jus and he was the very one
[40:28] they claimed they were looking
[40:30] for my goodness and then brother Ram
[40:33] breaks into this he goes uh he shows how
[40:36] uh most people failed to recognize
[40:38] Noah's day in its message they missed it
[40:41] only eight people caught it and Jesus
[40:43] said as it was in the days of Noah so
[40:44] shall it be in the days of the coming of
[40:46] the son of man so it's going to be a
[40:47] very small
[40:49] group he said Moses made the people
[40:51] ready for their Exodus they recognize
[40:54] their day and its
[40:55] message brother said they did not
[40:57] recognize John the Baptist in his
[40:59] message most of them didn't he said but
[41:01] the woman at the well recognized her day
[41:04] in its
[41:05] message Jesus discerned the thoughts and
[41:08] intents of her heart and she said I
[41:10] perceive you are a prophet amen we can
[41:12] look at brother R's life I perceive he's
[41:13] a prophet
[41:15] Hallelujah his sermons answered my
[41:17] questions hallelujah amen brother ra
[41:20] taught me how to cast out Devils by
[41:21] pointing me back to the Bible amen I
[41:24] literally seen the words of the Bible
[41:26] come off the pages brother Ro brother R
[41:28] pointed me there I preach them and I
[41:29] literally seen them come to life
[41:31] hallelujah amen oh my it's a
[41:35] reality brother said Jesus was the
[41:38] interpretation of the scripture his life
[41:41] interpreted the
[41:43] scripture amen
[41:46] hallelujah I'm having a good time
[41:48] tonight by God's grace oh I love this
[41:50] message
[41:53] bye brother said don't you see the
[41:55] message of this hour can you recognize
[41:57] where we are the message itself from the
[41:59] scripture interprets you the hour that
[42:02] we're living
[42:05] in so see brother Ram says it's the
[42:07] scripture that helps you recognize the
[42:09] day we're living
[42:11] in right not just brother Ram's words
[42:13] because brother Rod brother brandom's
[42:15] family well some of not all it some of
[42:17] his family has started like a worship of
[42:19] brother brandham they say only listen to
[42:21] brother brandom don't have preachers
[42:22] anymore just press play and Obey they
[42:25] sit at home they don't even go to church
[42:26] anymore it's so simp that so that that's
[42:29] why I bring some of those things up I
[42:30] got to I got to separate brother brandom
[42:32] from the word because brother Bram he
[42:34] said I'm not the
[42:35] word Jesus is the word amen the word was
[42:38] made flesh and dwell Among Us Hallelujah
[42:41] in the beginning was the word the word
[42:42] was with God and the word got a good
[42:44] Bible Church here hallelujah and
[42:47] remember Church there's 30 verses I made
[42:48] that remember I taught the Sunday school
[42:50] kids that 30 verses brother man gave us
[42:52] 30 verses on what the message is what do
[42:54] the message today he said it's Acts
[42:56] Chapter 2 get the Holy Ghost be baptized
[42:59] in Jesus Christ's name how many you
[43:00] believe that Glory I'm going to read a
[43:03] few more I'm not going to read all
[43:04] Malachi 45 and 6 turn the hearts of the
[43:06] children back to the
[43:08] fathers right turn the hearts of the the
[43:11] children at the second coming back to
[43:12] the hearts of the Believers at the first
[43:14] coming right because John turned the
[43:16] hearts of the uh Believers at Jesus
[43:18] first coming he turned their hearts to
[43:20] the Believers at the second coming they
[43:22] were all looking for the coming of
[43:24] Jesus he said Revelation 10 1-7 is is
[43:27] the message of this hour Matthew 20:6
[43:29] the 11th Hour worker is the message of
[43:31] this hour
[43:34] Hallelujah he said Revelation 18:4
[43:36] brother Simon preached it come out of
[43:38] her my people and be not partakers of
[43:40] her sins and plagues come out of
[43:42] denominational systems Matthew 25 1-13
[43:46] the parable of the wise and foolish
[43:47] virgins that's a great Revelation to me
[43:49] brother Rod when Jesus showed us that
[43:51] there's two kinds of Christians there's
[43:53] a wise Christian who's got the oil and
[43:54] there's a Christian who's pure but she
[43:57] got the oil
[43:59] Hallelujah it was a great Revelation and
[44:01] you can see it all through the Bible
[44:02] Abraham was the type of the wise lot was
[44:04] the type of the foolish right hallelujah
[44:08] oh you can find all through the Bible
[44:09] Jesus right and then you got the thief
[44:11] on the cross right Jesus was the the
[44:13] full the fullness of the word Thief
[44:15] barely got saved right at the end
[44:17] Hallelujah see to all through the
[44:20] scripture uh there's more many more
[44:22] there I have 30 on that video if you
[44:24] want to watch that yeah the the fivefold
[44:25] ministry Ephesians 4 6 18 he said that's
[44:28] the message of the hour sure the bride
[44:30] has PA Apostles prophets teachers
[44:33] evangelists and pastors is that right he
[44:36] said the bride of Christ now I'm not
[44:37] going to go through all of them I'll
[44:38] wear you out I'll wear myself out here
[44:40] you can go watch that we've been through
[44:41] that here by God's grace
[44:47] okay now brother Ram uses Hosea 6 I'm
[44:50] gonna go back there hope I kept my place
[44:52] there
[45:03] trying to finish this up here by God's
[45:07] grace now verse uh speaks of the hueing
[45:11] verse five now brother Mar gives us also
[45:13] a different thought on this here verse
[45:15] five therefore have I hewed them by the
[45:17] prophets I have slain them by the words
[45:19] of my mouth and thy judgments are as the
[45:21] light that goeth
[45:22] forth brother says this he says I Hosea
[45:26] said I have Hue now why
[45:27] Israel is talking to I have hewed or
[45:29] other words I've chopped them out
[45:30] through the prophets that's how God does
[45:32] his people he chopped them out from the
[45:35] rest of the Nations by what his
[45:36] two-edged sword his word so now brother
[45:39] is giving a positive application to this
[45:41] remember John said the ax is laid to the
[45:43] root of every tree right but now brother
[45:45] R says but you could also chop just to
[45:47] get a certain piece of wood out there
[45:49] right you could use the wood right we
[45:51] know lots of people that burn wood right
[45:53] and so they'll chop it up to get they'll
[45:54] use that wood for a good purpose or how
[45:58] about those uh how about those Amish
[46:00] people that make some good Amish
[46:01] furniture down there right Jake's Amish
[46:03] that's where we got that uh shelf out
[46:05] there Jake's armish furniture they do a
[46:07] good job chopping out that wood they use
[46:08] it for God's glory to help his people he
[46:12] said he chopped them his Nation from the
[46:14] Nations I like that Israel was a was a
[46:16] people out of the Nations right and now
[46:18] the Bride is a people out of the Nations
[46:21] the New Testament
[46:22] bride he said so has he chopped his
[46:25] bride from the denomination
[46:27] oh glory amen by the power of His word
[46:30] hallelujah he promised by Malachi 45
[46:33] and6 that Elijah would turn the hearts
[46:36] that's our hearts back to our fathers in
[46:40] the last day chopped out his bride hewed
[46:43] her from the rest of the churches he
[46:45] hewed out his
[46:46] bride so brother gives us that
[46:48] illustration God saw you and I in this
[46:51] tree and he chopped us out and now he's
[46:53] got his bride Hallelujah that's a good
[46:56] application like that too
[46:58] Hallelujah good
[47:00] thought now brother is bringing this
[47:04] down to the close it's in paragraph 191
[47:07] he said now the church the's speaking of
[47:08] like the people that have rejected his
[47:10] message that the church has not
[47:12] recognized her day like Israel Israel's
[47:14] forced back to Palestine she's going to
[47:16] be forced in the world Council of
[47:17] churches why she didn't recognize her
[47:19] Hour come out of her my people be not
[47:21] partakers of her sins flee your life or
[47:24] you'll be caught up with the mark of the
[47:26] beast and can't do no nothing else about
[47:29] it right we see the current
[47:31] Administration now uh all this uh
[47:34] persecution on Christians well at some
[47:36] point the government is going to unite
[47:38] with the
[47:39] churches and if you're not with them at
[47:41] some point maybe our lifetime maybe not
[47:43] you can't buy or sell church it's never
[47:45] been this close before it it it shocks
[47:49] me every day almost to see some of the
[47:50] news things I honestly brother Rod I
[47:53] don't think I ever thought I'd see it my
[47:54] day you know I just but it's it's
[47:56] happening so rapidly the persecution
[47:59] against Christians right and you see
[48:02] this week they're they're chanting death
[48:03] to America well what does that mean it
[48:06] doesn't mean the name America is going
[48:07] to be removed it's going to mean they're
[48:09] going to kill all the Christians because
[48:11] that's what America's about freedom of
[48:13] religion right that's what they're
[48:15] trying to do take get rid of the
[48:18] Christians because they stand for truth
[48:20] they don't want they don't care
[48:22] necessarily if the name changes that's
[48:24] not what they care about they care about
[48:25] taking away the right the
[48:27] protection where they and then you can't
[48:30] buy or sell without the mark of the
[48:32] beast that's what they want because then
[48:34] they have death right that's what they
[48:35] want death to the
[48:38] Believers that's
[48:40] right but said Flee for Your Life that's
[48:42] the message that's recognizing your day
[48:44] and its message let him that's filthy be
[48:46] filthy still let him that's holy not
[48:48] will be holy Hol is now hallelujah how
[48:52] many Are Holy right now by God's grace
[48:54] the Bible said that Jesus made the
[48:55] church holy unblameable
[48:58] unreprovable without spot or blemish
[49:01] Church you're holy if you're trusting in
[49:02] Jesus tonight Hallelujah not your
[49:04] Holiness Christ's Holiness in you amen
[49:07] amen that's right
[49:11] Glory brother says not a bobbed haired
[49:13] woman because remember if she dishonors
[49:15] it that word dishonor means a repulse
[49:17] it's a dishonor for a woman to cut her
[49:19] hair the same for a man to grow his hair
[49:20] out like a woman same thing it's it's a
[49:23] repuls thing to God repulsive it's
[49:25] disgusting thing to God
[49:29] she can't be the bride that sounds very
[49:32] flat but that's the scripture 1
[49:33] Corinthians 11 1-16 the Bible says she
[49:35] dishonors her head and her head is her
[49:37] husband and his head is Christ so she
[49:40] dishonors Christ said how can she be
[49:42] dishonorable or repulsive and not be
[49:44] filthy let him that's filthy be filthy
[49:47] still it's it's really something Church
[49:49] really something people better be
[49:50] praying for God's grace they better be
[49:53] repenting Hallelujah if they want to be
[49:55] saved
[49:57] he
[49:58] said okay I'm going to move on because I
[50:00] got to close it's already 8 o'clock

[53:32] there's any ever a time we need to
[53:34] recognize our day's message it's right
[53:36] now
[53:38] Hallelujah brother Ram said the majority
[53:40] of churches have rejected the very
[53:42] message God sent to
[53:44] them what is this message it's basically
[53:46] it's the book of Acts restored it's
[53:48] Paul's letters restored hallelujah it's
[53:51] the Mysteries revealed it's the bride
[53:54] get the oil ready go out to meet the
[53:56] bridegroom
[53:58] Amen brother R restored Jesus said in
[54:01] Matthew 17:11 he said Elijah will surely
[54:04] come and restore all things that was
[54:07] brother Adam's Ministry at the Spirit of
[54:08] Elijah to restore the apostolic Doctrine
[54:12] to finish the mystery of God to restore
[54:14] our faith in the promised word of God
[54:16] how many have restored Faith hallelujah
[54:19] amen I believe with all my heart
[54:20] Hallelujah
[54:26] so we understand our day and our message
[54:30] Hallelujah God has sent us a message for
[54:32] this day we must recognize our D's
[54:34] message but Ram said the churches are
[54:36] getting the the message of Israel
[54:38] confused with their calling right the
[54:40] two prophets are not for us we've
[54:42] already had a prophet sent Amen brother
[54:44] R warned us hallelujah with thus sayith
[54:46] the Lord
[54:47] hallelujah many times he said thus
[54:49] sayith the Lord remember I showed I got
[54:51] the video six thus sayith the Lords that
[54:53] were prophesied came to pass and then he
[54:55] gives us eight thus sayith the Lord
[54:57] on Doctrine and then he gives us 11
[54:59] future prophecies that haven't come to
[55:01] pass yet that but we know they will
[55:02] because we already have these other ones
[55:03] we already have these
[55:05] 14
[55:10] Hallelujah then he says
[55:13] this he said them preachers he says
[55:16] we'll get up there and just stir up the
[55:18] crowd and say there's coming a great
[55:19] Revival the hand Lord is going to be
[55:21] upon the
[55:22] Earth he says they don't realize that's
[55:24] under the trumpets for Israel
[55:27] see they're pumping them up about blood
[55:29] moons and uh all these things we read
[55:31] about and stars from from the heavens
[55:35] and the two prophets but that's not even
[55:37] for us that's for
[55:39] Israel God said when he go the Bible
[55:41] said in re Romans 11 when he goes back
[55:43] to Israel he cuts off the Gentiles that
[55:45] means no more Mercy wherever you are at
[55:48] the Rapture wherever you are whether
[55:49] you're you're holy or righteous that's
[55:51] what you're going to remain he cuts off
[55:54] the branch and whatever's that's
[55:55] whatever the branch is that's what what
[55:56] it is and then God goes back to Israel
[55:59] to get the 144,000 that's the
[56:02] scripture Hallelujah they don't realize
[56:05] that's under of the trumpets for Israel
[56:06] why do they do
[56:08] that he said they don't realize they're
[56:10] rejecting the very message that's sent
[56:11] to them he said now you know you see why
[56:15] Satan didn't want me to preach this now
[56:17] back to the beginning he ate corn he had
[56:20] a stomach ache falling asleep trying to
[56:21] study now do you see why Satan was
[56:23] fighting this because we had to
[56:24] recognize our day in
[56:26] message don't try to we we're not
[56:28] looking for what Israel is looking for
[56:31] right we're not looking for two prophets
[56:32] we already had a prophet Hallelujah
[56:35] we've got to do what the prophet said
[56:36] amen hallelujah we must be on fire we
[56:40] got to be hot we can't be lukewarm or
[56:41] cold we're not going to be cold so we
[56:43] just got to battle lukewarmness
[56:45] Hallelujah remember that's just in your
[56:47] mind if you're born again your soul can
[56:49] never be cold you're your soul can never
[56:51] be
[56:52] lukewarm right remember that remember
[56:53] that good Revelation 1 John 3:9 put up 1
[56:56] John 3:9 H if you got there by God's
[56:58] grace there's a part of you that never
[57:00] sin in the first place you got if you

[57:05] seed of God that spirit of God in you it
[57:07] never did Sin to begin with hallelujah
[57:10] amen hallelujah that's the part that's
[57:12] hot Hallelujah that's the part you feed
[57:14] on that's the part that uh when you pray
[57:17] God speaks to that part Hallelujah
[57:18] whosoever is born of God does not commit
[57:20] sin amen my mind will commit sin My
[57:23] Flesh will commit sin but my soul can
[57:25] never commit it's in Hallelujah CU that
[57:28] my soul is baptized it's filled it's
[57:30] immersed with the Holy Ghost
[57:32] Hallelujah for a seed remains in him and
[57:35] he cannot sin because he's born of God
[57:38] hallelujah am oh what a revelation amen
[57:41] thank you Jesus amen remember just two
[57:44] chapters before that he said if anybody
[57:45] says they're not a sinner they're a
[57:48] liar and the sameen two chapters later
[57:50] says you got a part of you that never
[57:51] sinned and can
[57:53] sin what is it it's a mystery it's a the
[57:56] mystery of Christ in you the hope of
[57:58] Glory Hallelujah hidden from the ages
[58:01] before but now it's been revealed to us
[58:03] hallelujah amen as it was to the
[58:05] Colossians in Colossians chapter 1 26
[58:08] and
[58:09] 27
[58:11] Hallelujah he said there you are we're
[58:13] just waitting God is just waiting for
[58:15] the bride to take her out of the way so
[58:17] the two prophets can come the Hebrew
[58:19] prophets they'll recognize Israel
[58:22] recognize those two two Hebrew prophets
[58:31] now how many remember when brother ran
[58:33] was in chiro Egypt and he was going to
[58:35] get on a plane to go to Israel to show
[58:37] them the prophet gift I remember that
[58:39] story he was he was there in the uh I
[58:43] think he called it the hanger I don't
[58:45] know exactly let me
[58:47] look brother Braham said oh he said Lord
[58:49] here I am ready I jumped on the plane
[58:52] took the money got me a ticket stopped
[58:54] in Cairo said yeah I'm Ready the H
[58:56] spirit said this is not your place he
[58:58] was going to go show them the gift of
[58:59] the Prophet this is not your time he
[59:02] said see I got ahead of myself I thought
[59:04] oh my I came over here I'm going I'm
[59:06] going to go but something said stop
[59:08] right here don't you go that way turn on
[59:10] and go into India don't go over that go
[59:11] over to India don't you go there I think
[59:13] it was 1954 if I'm not mistaken or 55 I
[59:17] have to go look that
[59:18] up I thought why Lord so I walked out
[59:21] behind the hanger right where the planes
[59:23] were and I said Lord Jesus what does
[59:25] this mean
[59:26] and then he made known to me no Gentile
[59:30] these prophets are the one it has to be
[59:33] according to the scripture Moses and
[59:36] Elijah has to come to
[59:37] Israel so see the holy spirit said
[59:40] Israel is not going to receive a gentile
[59:42] they're only received two
[59:44] Jews right he said that's according to
[59:46] the scripture and besides that the bride
[59:48] hasn't been taken out of the way
[59:51] yet and then prophets will return and
[59:54] then they'll do the sign of the Prophet
[59:55] to Israel
[59:56] that's the scripture there it is all
[59:58] fulfilled there perfectly Israel as a
[1:00:00] nation will be born in one day the Bible
[1:00:02] says he says
[1:00:05] amen let me show you how he closes this
[1:00:11] here so brother R prays for the people
[1:00:14] and here's what he
[1:00:17] says he asked people to come out of
[1:00:19] denominations now you're all churches
[1:00:21] here right are you're all members here
[1:00:23] for the most part now rod and Nia are
[1:00:25] not but that's okay but everybody else
[1:00:27] every service usually we only have we
[1:00:28] rarely have
[1:00:29] visitors just CU most people don't like
[1:00:32] our preaching but that's okay they don't
[1:00:34] have
[1:00:35] to but brother R says if you're still in
[1:00:39] denomination he said come out of it
[1:00:41] because it's Rome Revelation
[1:00:43] 184 come out of the system because all
[1:00:45] those systems are going to bow to the
[1:00:47] Roman Catholic
[1:00:53] Church brother Ram says would you raise
[1:00:56] your hand and say God be merciful to me
