feel how your letter the whole or our let up your sphere dear God almost i watch tonight Lord how you meet us Minister tonight we love you lord give you all the praise Jesus Christ skate every set ADA got this would have been super freeze gun amen so draw my inspiration room for this message from dated Bible reading and I was just inspired so we'll get to that a little bit I want to preach a lot of Josiah tonight I looked up to assign the messenger brother Graham did say his name one time so I'll just be pulling scriptures I'm sure you'll see the scriptural truce you know through the other scriptures and things that brother has said I'm sure you'll see it tonight by God's grace okay so I want to start let's let's read all the others three texts here where Jesus or three parallel passages where Jesus is recorded quoting Deuteronomy 6 4 and 5 but let's let's start let's go back to Matthew 22 here if we can verse 34 Matthew 22 34 let's get the itch and every passage so we can get the full understanding of of this story here gives us a a good foundation to understand it in 20 to 34 when the Pharisees had heard that he had put the Sadducees to silence they were gathered together then one of them which was a lawyer asked him a question tempting him saying bannister which is the Great Commandment in the law it's quite a question one time I read there was 612 laws in the Old Testament they said which one of the 612 which one is the great law what a question to ask and jesus answered verse 37 and Jesus said unto Him thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart and with all thy soul and with all thy but this is the first and Great Commandment and the second is like unto it thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself on these two Commandments hang all the law and the prophets amen so that's a good a good quote there see that I want you to understand a few things here I want to relate these here by God's grace notice that Jesus identifies four things now this one just has three but the other portion has four things and I believe these four basically fall into the three parts of a man okay but let me bring that out he says all your heart that's your affections right is it obvious that your heart is deceitful above all things and when you get saved you have a heart of stone but then when you go after you're saying I a heart of flesh is that your affections the things you love so that your emotions will say like that that's your motion so love God with all your emotion and with all your soul and I Souls your nature right that's what a solo Souls the nature of the human spirit so love God with all the nature inside of you all your soul and with all your mind now that's the rest of the human sphere we'd say you're thinking right you're conscious your memory reason imagination so love God with all that now the other one we ready lieutenant says strength and that there's your body right there your physical strength love God other words love God with everything you have that's what Jesus said this is the greatest command to us Jesus says the first and Great Commandment auch about them about this morning you know loving ourselves should be secondarily right you should love what God told you to be but not love yourself to worship yourself or give yourself too much praise or be prideful but the real believer loves God with all their heart and then loves their neighbor right so that's that's how you that's how a Christian approaches life I love God with everything and this love I have for God causes me to love my neighbors amen remember the Bible said there were to be lovers of themselves more than lovers of God that's the look I love we want to stay away from the lover of self we don't to love ourselves like our flesh or you know we don't want to baby ourselves or make ourselves too comfortable we want to love the Lord Jesus Christ first and love of course we love what God called us to be as we mentioned this morning I just want to make sure I balance that out and say that we I put Christ first love Christ first amen and then love your neighbor as yourself now notice on these two Commandments and all the law and the prophets now a few these if you look up the word hang there it needs summarized so all the rest of the law everything in the Old Testament all the prophets are summarized by these two commands so God said all those profits can you imagine Haggai and Zechariah Malachi and Moses and Joshua and all these prophets of God said all of them are summarizing these two Commandments love God with all your heart and love your neighbors yourself amen they all hate me all depend upon those these two things loving God and loving others amen nor denominations pick that up sometimes and they got it right they got those words right you must love God and love neighbors right that's the first and Great Commandment but when it comes down to the word we got to make sure we keep all the word Amen loving God means hating sin let me know that I saw the way you know you love God in fear God as if you hate sin because God is holiness God is righteousness if you love god you'll hate evil because God is the Holy Spirit not the unholy spirit amen so let's keep that in our thinking here the heart your affections your soul their very nature of your being the seed inside of you need to love God love it with all you have strength is your body and your mind is your thoughts and these are the people Jesus says that inherit eternal life god gives eternal life to those who love God with everything they have I'm just as my let's just say like this our live city so consumed with the word of God amen how can I love God with more of my heart I can look out more of my mind Laura my strength what more can I do for the Lord amen and that's the kind of person Jesus says will inherit eternal life those who give their uh their feelings their thinking their soul and their body their strength give everything to god there's a kind against eternal life what a blessing that is I want you to know there's one person who did this without any fault and that was the Lord Jesus Christ amen Lord Jesus Christ the Lord Jesus Christ kept all these Commandments so Jesus fully lived this out Jesus loved the father with all his heart sold my body strength how many believe that hallelujah he kept all that and he loved everyone else as himself right he treated the others people's needs before his amen all right now want to read though this one of John chapter or 15 here John 15 10 if we can read that how do we know Jesus love the father because he obeyed the father that's verse 10 John 15 10 if you keep my Commandments he shall abide in my love even as I have kept my father's command it and by abide in his love praise God alright so that's how we know we're in the love of God we abide the love of God by keeping the commandments oh Jesus love God with all of his heart soul mind and strength and because of that he inherited eternal life amen praise God he sure did any of the Bible said he ever lives that never to die anymore praise the Lord he's the only one that kept all these all the time with on in his entire life of his heart soul mind and strength amen that's the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah so we want to love that we want to show the father we love him as well by keeping his commands loving in and then loving our neighbor praise God also now let's look at the next one mark 12 28 mark 12 28 same type of a story here same story with great Commandments and one of the scribes came in having heard them reasoning together receiving the heat and answered them well as to which is the first commandment of all and jesus answered him the first of all the commandments is hear o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul with all thy mind and with all thy strength this is the first commandment amen and the second is like namely this thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself there is none other commandment greater than these over here and the scribes that have been well master that has said the truth for there is one God and there is none other than he and to love him with all the heart and with all the understanding and with all the soul and with all the strength and the love his neighbors himself is more than all the whole burnt offerings and sacrifices Amen hallelujah and when Jesus other the answer discreetly he said unto Him thou art not far from the kingdom of God and don't mad after that Durst ask him any questions amen look how much God loves to be loved remember what brother man said he said God looking for one man or woman that he could just get fully in his hand and did Jesus says if you can love God would like that it's greater than any animal sacrifices and all the great amounts of sacrifices you can possibly give church that's why God had to send the Holy Ghost let me know that solvin how many how many thousands of offerings or me I'd like to go back and check I don't remember how many that was how many thousands of offering solid and gain at the dedication right of the temple that he built but yet later in his life what happened he fell away from the Lord he built altars unto false gods and his wives turned his heart away from serving God so those who show is not how many physical animal sacrifices you could give but it's how much you love them more praise God how much of your thinking you'll give to God how much of your heart how much of your understanding how much of your all and how much of your strength will give to god that's what God wants it's greater than all of the burnt offerings all the burn all the sacrifices you can possibly give God would take the love above all that amen that's my prayer lord help me to love you with all I have amen and he says you're not harm licking the guy what's the kingdom of God the baptismal Holy Ghost amen to say you're not far for being born again because you know to love God is the greatest thing we could possibly do or let's make sure we're watching what things we love amen let's make sure we're watching our words well I love this right I just love do that I'd love to travel i'd love to do this i love to buy that let's be careful what we say things that we love I us to love the Lord with all of our hearts all of our mind and our strength amen how many enjoy that by God's grace if we could let's go now to let's get down let's go to judges here if we can judges chapter 16 verse four judges 16 verse 4 programme talked about giving God all of your being of course your your heart soul mind and strength all right judges 16 verse 4 now you know this is the story of Samson right Samson and Delilah now let's go to verse 5 and the Lords of the Philistines came up on to her and said unto her entice him and see where in his great strength liya and by what means we may prevail against him that we may bind him to afflicted and we will give the every one of us 11 hundred pieces of silver and a lot of said to Samson tell me I pray thee wearing that great shrink liya and we're without minus be bound to afflict Lee now we know Samson tells her something false but first few times and then she gets really desperate go down to verse 15 and she said a name how canst i'll say i love thee when thy heart is not with me i was locked me these three times and has not told me to wear by Greg strength Liath and it came to pass when she pressed him daily with her words and urged him said his soul was vexed unto death then he told her all his heart and said unto her there hath not come a razor Paul my head for I have been in as right unto God for my mother's womb if I be shave and then my strength will go from me and I shall become weak and be like any other man and when Delilah saw that he had told her all his heart she sent and called for the Lords of the phils to insane come up this once forget showed me all his heart and the Lords of the Philistines came up under her and brought money in their hand I look church can't you see this look how Satan tempts people it's every day right what you do every day she kept their Tyson look that's how we're supposed to be with God right jesus said we're supposed to come like a little woman and come a-knockin and bright every single day well look if you're not praying like what singing is going to do say it's gonna come knocking on your door every day right he's going to come knock and every day to try to get you to do the wrong thing deceive you a little bit and look he didn't shut her up he could have sent her away he could have done all these things and but he did it because he did give God all of his heart instead of giving God his heart he gave who his his lover his heart instead of Christ Jesus in other words the Holy Spirit we'd say and look if we're not constantly seeking God then what's going to happen then we're going to let Satan keep knocking on our hearts right and follow the temptation fall into struggles we've got to keep seeking God okay seeking God's will rather than uh you know letting temptations become stronger and stronger in our lives amen now I'm going to read this quote by the Barisan there's too many people like Samson today Samson gave god is strength but he wouldn't give him his heart God could use his strength but not his heart Samson was somewhat a ladies man you know and he just couldn't give him his heart he had to give that to Delilah but he gave his strength to God God use his strength but he couldn't use his heart he said so are many people today they say God yo uh he said done he said God I'll build you a big house I'll make you an organization out of this out of that they don't you don't you realize this that's the same thing came in it was rejected amen he's trying to find a man that will follow him he had one he had one then Abraham he was a perfect man whatever God said that was all right amen so can you see that here's a great example of someone that didn't love God with all their heart soul mind and strength he gave a strength to God right brother Brad said he was a shrimp he was a real shrimpy kind of man Samson he wasn't something big burly man he was a shrimpy man but he let God anointed but he gave got his strength he would physically pulled out gates and and you'll kill Brooke I'm lying apart all kinds of things like that but he didn't you got his heart he's God that's why your personal time what you do in your personal time when no one's around that's your real love right there only be then that's real love whatever you do when you're all alone and you have no free Todd no one's around what you do right there shows what you really love that's exactly right and Sampson and his free time going to be with Delilah you'll he he he was the wrong person I'm state like that he should not have been with Delilah because it led to his fall praise the Lord and he didn't give God his heart he just kidding you've got his strength that's what we got to be careful we gotta be careful yo just give you got our strength and coming to church right that's your giving God your strength tonight right you could be anywhere else you could be anywhere else you're working or doing something or resting or something like that you're giving God your strength tonight just like you gave this morning but not only should we give them our strength we got to give my heart to our affections they aren't our bind as well Lord build my fine let me fill my buyer with the thoughts of God I mean like that by God's grace amen that's beautiful librettist everybody's like that well Hobart Alberto will go to church what is this for gone what does that forgot but we got to give God every part of our being all of our thoughts all harm infections everything we love and all of our strength of our soul every part of it amen I hope you like that by God's grace that's a perfect example I didn't get to see people that give God part of it another one's Judas I didn't have any notes on this but we know Judas right he was sent out at the beginning you must have done good you must had a good mind right he was a preacher he's apostle uh he was must have had a good strength because he was SAT up two by two and they went to cities and prepared to weigh him for Jesus to come into the town and administer but at some point he musta gave his heart to Satan because the Bible said that Satan entered into his heart after the the past Oh remember that he entered into his heart and caused him to deceive or to betray our Lord amen so Judas is another example he didn't give God all of his feet praise God I said I just God what's all or nothing I say like that God was all or nothing we want to give God all programs said if you're not ready to sell out lock stock and barrel to Jesus he said don't come at all amen although we're ready we should sell out everything and serve the Lord Jesus Christ amen we must give God every part of our life now let me show a few quotes from other random angel the Lord 1951 April 14 you better women I'm sorry and men and women you know where you stand tonight there's only one person knows its nose it that's God knows where you stand so if so if your hearts right with God really live for him be true to him love him so much that everything else becomes secondarily and then you'll love him with all your heart with all your strength with all your soul with all your mind God will lead you then amen he was that wonder of God which way like oh god lead me they can't buy the leading because they don't love God with all their hearts you have to love God with all your heart so much strength everything and then God will lead you in paths of righteousness amen and it says the footsteps of a righteous man is ordered by the Lord I'll alluvium our restore saith the Lord in New York on august 29 1954 program said so if you want to get closer to God just get close to love just love God with all your heart with all your soul with all your mind with all your strength just wrap yourself in a bundle of love Lori watch that man you said watch that man that you did like like you praise the Lord you can win people over with love let me know that and that rides but real love what I tried to bribe people to love us and like us we're trying to really love them hallelujah the man said you ever get around anybody you see nice people that you couldn't hardly stand to be around them now you know that's right isn't it I've seen people like that maybe they just love to be in their presence haven't you seen people like that do you realize that your sons of God the atmosphere and the air that you live in you create a situation around you and either drawers or push away so so think about your life today are you driving people away by your presence or you drawing that in amen that's what love does love is supposed to draw people into you praise the Lord and that's the kind of people that we want to be because then people want to be a rounded up say man hallelujah so we want to get close to God wrap yourself in a bundle of love he says what a good thought amen all right so let's uh now let's go to a second Kings 23 let's look at this here this was just was really blessed by this I'm hoping to blessing you church I really hope it is tonight by God's grace I've never preach on geoscience this be my first time ever preaching on jones i will just hit the highlights in his life i actually sort of chapter 22 I'm sorry I can see why I you know I know different ones that are named Josiah because he had such a powerful testimony in the Bible looks like only at the end of his life that he goes little stray you know or maybe make a bad decision about not he tried to do the skies and then you got killed in battle but look at verse 1 Josiah was eight years old when he began to rain and he reigned 30 and one years in Jerusalem and his mother's name was jadida the daughter of an ayah and boss cat and he did that which was right in the side the Lord and walked in all the way up David his father and turned that aside to the right hand or to the left now to just go through this a little quickly here by God's grace there was remember there's very few Kings that actually walked good before God he was one of them and it's interesting I don't know the answer this but the Bible says both Hezekiah and Josiah serve God with all their hearts and there wasn't a man like them before or after that that's what the Bible says about both I'm still waiting for the revelation on that I don't understand that but they are both the Bible says walked in updated their father and there was no one like that before no one liked him afterwards remember hold Hezekiah was before Josiah just so you know now when a Josiah turned turned 24 I'm sorry 2626 because in the 18 years of ministry uh he started happening into the desire to rebuild the house of God amen I'm sorry 26 26 so what he did he started calling people to do work and he started repairing the doors and the breaches to the house of the Lord so spots were was broken he hired carpenters and builders and masons and timber wood and stone hewers and so forth and he started rebuilding the house of the Lord look God was merciful to him 18 years he served didn't even help the house of God and then all of a sudden of a 26 something changed in his mind he said I'm going to start putting my focus for the house of god I hope your focus is toward the house of God I believe it is tonight it's god bless you for coming coming tonight by God's grace even if anyone else they'll come we want to come and hear the word of the Lord amen I never found anything greater that here is the word of God sitting at the feet of Jesus loving Jesus but look how his heart turns toward God he's 26 years old 18 years he's been on the throne he started at eight years old and finally starts let's put us with our focus let's put our attention on the Word of God let's put it on the house of God and look at verse 8 and he'll kiya the hype reset of the shape of the scribe I have found the book of the law of the house the Lord and he'll kiya gave the book to a fan and he read it now verse 10 shape it reads it before the king so apparently Josiah had not read most of the law or parts of the law because they find the law in the house of God and that's where you'll find the revelation church for your life is in the house of the Lord hey man glory hallelujah first 10 verse 11 and it came to pass when the King had heard the words of the book of law that he rent his clothes here's a man he had just not heard the Word of God before but as soon as he hears it it strikes him is so personal that he rents his clothes even that was a sign of repentance remember and Joel in the days of Joey got so common to write your clothes that God's old Joe he said tell the people don't rent her clothes he said rent your hearts amen how dare you it just became common people just they didn't act like it offers going to be sorrowful and they rent their clothes of course they had layers on you know Israelites always more layers they dread that outer garment or the outer mantle and I got tired of that player on renting your clothes he said rend your hearts amen well Josiah was sincere it really meant something so when he read his outer garment if that o God my heart's being torn out this word is burning me I have such a desire for this word in my life how many feel that way brings God hey man that's what Josiah Eddie read his clothes and repented and then he read this on Wednesday night then he sends all of his men to go to hold up the woman Providence wet now saved the Lord a member what she say there wouldn't be run out Wednesday night she basically said you'll be parted from the destruction in your lifetime Josiah but those after you won't have to suffer because of all the sins all the abominations that Israel's committed now go to chapter 23 in chapter 23 verse 2 and the king went up into the house the Lord and all the man of Judah and all the inhabitants of Jerusalem with him and the priests of the prophets and all the people both small great and he ran in their ears all the words of the book of this covenant which was found in the house the Lord so do you see this he got so burdened she was I started you know what to help God's house get better and while while ministering to God God had special revelations form out of the book aren't you glad we have an open book church is that what you could say brother banget each one of us could say while we were trying to serve God God brought us a new book oh hey man it's a present your Bible should become a brand new book because the opening of the Seventh Seal thing then if that's what I found him in a book was open to me praise God and then i repented of my sins and baptizing Jesus Christ's name Amen and that's what happened here by the grace of the Lord and then he got so stirred up then he went read this entire book to all the people and then he's diverse three and four of her street then he has all the people let's make a covenant let's make a province so I look at I look at you and the IE look at me not and let's all vow to God that we're going to keep the words of this book amen sounds pretty sincere doesn't it remember God said through hold of the prophetess God told Jose I action in verse 19 of chapter 22 because thine heart was tender and I was humbled myself before the Lord and the Bible said and hazrath I clothes and went before me i have heard thee saith the lord and that beautiful that's good part of that that what I just wanted to go down here I'm sorry chapter 22 verse 19 in chapter 22 so see the rending of Josiah's clothes was him humbling himself and he just didn't rent his clothes he all fell down and cried about it church we need to sometimes cry about sins that we see since in our lives or sins in lives of others praise the Lord God said I heard you because you humbled yourself you cried before me you let Sid burden you so much that you cried about it and because of that I've heard your prayer amen now in chapter 23 let's start a course for me I could go to verse for your your weekend Joseph I did so stirred up church he gets so sure about this new book this revelation of a brand new book you didn't even know about it he get so stirred up he starts obeying everything that book says and whatever that book says like a childlike childlike faith he just starts doing it amen whatever jesus knows whatever jesus said do it amen whatever the Word of God says I just do it now verse 4 and the king commanded he'll Qaeda high priests in the priests of the second order and the keepers of the door to bring forth out of the temple the Lord all the vessels that were made for bail and for the grove and for all the hosts in heaven and he burned them without Jerusalem in the fields of Kidron and carried the ashes of them unto Bethel so what's he do he gets out all the vessels that were pagan vessels he gets all the bad vessels out of the church what's he doing he's cleaned out the church praise God first five and he put down the idolatrous priests so he takes out the boss creatures in the church he says I'm getting out all their vessels all their other pagan things and get out of those false prophets on the church as well now look at verse 7 look at this and he break down the houses of the sodomites that were by the house of the Lord where the woman won't headings for the grove this church was so back Siddhant they let homosexuals build up houses next to the house Lord and Josiah said i read in the law that that's wrong we're gonna burn down those houses amen look how Sid had buried in città basically moved our marriage at the church and they can't combine one isn't that what's happening right now pretty set by God's grace they are married together I know what happened to the fourth church age but it's even more so now they're marrying church and state pagan state with peg insurance that's exactly what's going on amen but Josiah said that the Bible said that's wrong I'm going to burn down their houses any man I'll break him down burn down wherever I got to do and every one of their holy places i'm just going to start paraphrasing up every one of their holy places he defiled them so he took their holy places into father because they're really unholy right he destroyed every grove every high place he would take their altar the vows that they would stomp on them and make them powder and then take the powder throat in the rivers they just removed everything that exhausts itself against the Word of God they got rid of it he got down to business with God how many want to get down to business with God he didn't this is what if you do what you want your heart and love of Jesus Christ get rid of everything and insulting sup against the Word of God but converse attendant even got rid of the abortion clinics was and he'd evolved tote TOFA which is in the valley of the children of him not that no man might make his son or daughter to pass through the fire tomalak now I'm not advocating burning abortion place that's wrong that's breaking the law but in the Christian but in the Christian round we should pray to keep people out of those abortion clinics amen this is what love for God did he was in love for God he was on fire for God amen now the rest of the chapter he does this he is a housecleaning time it's a church cleaning time he cleans out the entire church now look at verse 20 the last thing he does before the Passover and he stood all the priests of the high places so first he kicked out all the false prophets on the church and then they killed all the priests that were out there in the will of woods and all these little private secret sanctuaries he kill all them what is he doing he's purging sin out of God's land amen he's purging the land of God that he's purging the people of God by the word of the Lord amen look at verse 21 and the King command all the people saying keep the Passover to the Lord your God has written a book of this covenant surely there was not holding such a Passover for the days of the judges that judges real nor in all the days of the kings of Israel nor the kings of Judah when the 18th year of king josiah where this passover is holden to the Lord in Jerusalem now since the days of sin you know give me just a moment here okay Samuel was only get the year real quick because my Bible has dates in the days of Santa was about 10 63 so the bed about 450 years since they had since they had a real good Passover festival praise God now look what happens if you don't have a real good Holy Ghost Festival for a while what happens sin starts coming into the church praise God we don't have a real move of the Holy Ghost here what's going to happen sitting I trying to creep his way in we've got to keep the Feast of the Lord praise God we've got to keep the wood will of God the Word of God amen it must be kept by somebody amen now notice what was the Passover the Passover was remembering remember why they get the Passover to remember that they were slaves they were slaves in Egypt they were slaves to idolatry they were slaves to paganism and the Passover was to remind them that they came out of Egypt they came out of the world with a urgency praise God and they came out and they came out by the blood of the Lamb amen they came out that are supposed to be travelers they're supposed to be on fire they're supposed to be quick to obey the Word of God and this is what God is josiah's being led of God to do remember where you came from you came out of paganism look at that they came out of paganism and they let Peggy this and move right in isn't that exactly what happened to America amen she come out of anglican russian colada Catholic influence uh Edwin left and let that simple influence move right back in amen but Josiah said I'm cleaning it out hallelujah I'm cleaning out the house of God look at verse 24 moreover the workers with familiar spirits and the Wizards and the images and the items and all the abominations that were spy the land of Judah and Jerusalem did Josiah put away that he might perform heard the words of the law which were written in a book that he'll Qaeda the priests found in the house of the Lord so Jose I didn't want to talk about the message he wanted to live the message came n he 111 he wanted to perform I will perform I will carry out the word of god that's what I'm talking about with a church order if brother Graham says we should come early to pray and we should get into people and we should try to get the spirit how many want to perform that that's a whole other step of consecration with all 44 Beatty and baptized in jesus christ aid but whoever for those kind of law those kind of promises and if you invest in the Holy Spirit you'll see more of the spirit of a church amen glory I hope you're receiving the Word of God tonight now verse 25 is what gave me the inspiration for this whole message verse 25 and like unto him was there no King before him that turned to the Lord with what church all of his what heart and with all his soul and with all his might according to all the law of Moses neither after him a rooms there any like him in a beautiful hallelujah God said God looks out is that this is a king who turned with all his heart soul mind astray so how does that apply to us today we should get rid of everything sinful in our lives everything and now just talk about it but do it as we said if a brother can't handle both because of sexual images he should get rid of that phony men right if sisters can't handle certain apps or certain things or certain videos or whatever more they should delete those praise God get rid of the folder spend less time on the computer to everything we should do to stay away from sin praise God and not just talk about it but performant carry it out and watch God bless your life amen that's how you turn to God with all your heart soul mind and strength a church i type in all those words and is the only person recorded in the Bible that's recorded doing this Moses commanded Israel there's ten scriptures like this that all say heart soul mind and strength and love God there's the same scriptures like this Moses commands it one two three four five times Joshua command at one time in Joshua 22 verse 5 and then jesus said it one two three four times but this is the only time at the entire Bible that I can find that the Bible record somebody is loving God with all their heart soul mind and strength under the law but it was because of a new mysterious book that became revealed to them in the house of God amen I think at one type of our day amen they left Egypt but the world who back in but it took somebody with a brand-new book and a brand new revelation to reinstitute the festival's of god the work of God the pleasing leadership of God amen go to first friendly chapter 5 let's see more about this feast but you know here's keeping the feast today did you know that you're keeping the beasts of the past summer how many do that we're keeping the spiritual Passover hallelujah first witness chapter 5 so my brother bang I don't know that book was in the house of God I know there was a book like I de Valence of God all the guys showed it to me in 2001 there's a beautiful boat full of mystery full of new revelation if it's lagging in the house of God and it caused brother Jesse because it is it caused a kingdom priest by the name of a Jesse spin to clean out his whole life and turn to God with all his heart soul mind and strength we got any more kings and priests out there you could we do the same thing we come to the house of God hear the word and see these revelations declare we make a promise in the Covenant and then we go to kicking everything out of our lives that doesn't agree with this brand new book amen ohana here hey man all right what did I say what scripture does your heart Lady Thank You garden you get extra piece of chicken to neck because you remembered something special remind me but I give all my children whatever i'll give her ah thank you Sam got such a good memory okay uh go to verse 7 first Guardians 57 place your hair because i was saying you're supposed to keep the Passover tip I'm supposed to keep it our Passover just isn't in April it's every day of the year every day of the year because the past summer had what the token of the blood which rock types the baptism the Holy Ghost but it's oh so it's a life you live with the Holy Ghost first seven yep first seven purge out therefore the old leaven that he may be a new lump as you are unleavened now what was that lap in church it was a man living in sexual sin I remember that that was the leaven that got their church and nobody the church Lord about they weren't even sad about this some person in sexual sin Alyssa finished first senator for even Christ our Passover is sacrificed for us so Paul takes us back there sit in your church remember though Christ is our Passover and what was the Passover all about you had to keep all 11 out of the kitchen right it goes seven seven days on 11 bred all these things you got to keep all the Levitt out and so Paul said you got to keep the spiritual Passover there's no leaven in Christ there's no sitting Christ Jesus keep the church cleaning that's what gifts are supposed to be for amen cost preaching and so for her sake therefore let us keep the feast that was all heaven neither with the leaven of malice and wickedness but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth and the church said amen so when we're born again we must keep the church free from sin free from 11 and then we must keep it with sincerity and truth we must be sincere when we come to the house of God we must know the truth when we come to the house of God is it right to this is it wrong to do that let's live godly lives let's keep the feast like Josiah did a man and God will honor our church even for a man that's beautiful and to me that just beat let's I just done all just fit tied together with the new tests and i think that's that's just beautiful and let me show you another one acts 739 i preached just a few months ago I don't remember when this should add more to it x 7 39 now so this is that this is the opposite of what we should do so this is this is the side of backsliders okay somebody just show them scared good mankind so whom our fathers would not obey but thrust him from them and their hearts turn back again into Egypt so see when people won't obey the Holy Spirit they turned back to sin right cuz you can't serve cancer both masters points41 master you're being led by somebody when people turn down the Holy Spirit and that the word says this if the Bible says is if the Holy Spirit is preaching this and they turn it down and the violence in their hearts turn back into a life of sin a life of lukewarmness can say hey verse 14 okay here's what they did say unto Aaron make us God's to go before us as for this Moses which brought us out of the land to Egypt we know not what's becoming is that what they doin brother Graham where's brother bran where's the god brother bran oh he's not here anymore let's just go back into the world I face what they're saying where is this visa I the Prophet where is he right versus teaching this all lies all these things like that let us go back into the world and so that's a hard that's backslidden I showed you a heart that's turned Josiah Josiah turn with all his heart kept every promise of God clean got everything in his house in the church he not the whole country ahead God said he turned with all his heart but Israel turned back in their hearts sort of simple life and they called their old gods won't remember this God for future I've never this thing I used to the world let's go do that again that'd be really fun and that was turning back to the world but our hearts are not supposed to turn back to the each of our hearts supposed to turn back to the faith of the fathers amen let's go to that now four or five valentine 45 and I'm almost done I've enjoyed that hope you enjoyed see Joe sighs Josiah's like that's such a beautiful scripture name okay Malachi 4 5 & 6 Val kind of 45 the old I was sent you Elijah the Prophet before the coming of the Great and dreadful day of the Lord and he shall turn the heart of the father's to the children and the heart of the children to their fathers lest I come and smite the earth with the curse praise the Lord now let me read you a few things brother have said about this so you can understand it I got one right here I want to read to you here by God's grace he says this is the voice to sign 1964 but in Malachi 4 he said just before the great and terrible day of the Lord shall come when the whole earth will burn like an oven and the righteous shall walk among the ashes of the wicked that's the Millennium I'll send a lie to the prophet and what will he do he will restore the faith of the children back to the Apostolic fathers back to the word he'll have to be a prophet I'll send him he'll be thoroughly identified his nature will be the same as the lodges was exactly his message will be right on that line he'll condemn and tear down no fellowship no cooperation no nothing but he'll have not save the Lord amen alleluia hope you saw that by God's grace let me show you another one here by the grace of the Lord our romance is this program says I deny upon the infallible evidence of the word that there is more than one major profit messenger who reveal the mysteries has contained in the word but Lauren I were just talking about that where we'd better at lunch I forgot about that brother Graham said there there will not be another prophet messenger with any mysteries he says only the seventh church a messenger and there's only one he says who has the ministry to turn the heart of the children to the father's he says thus saith the lord by his unfailing word stands and shouts can and be vindicated there's one prophet master to this age all right I want you to see that by the grace of the Lord okay well Gramps others that are imprisoned out there must be someone rise up that's got to come aboard thus at the Lord Malachi the fourth chapter that's exactly what he said would be the sign just before the coming of the Great and dreadful or terrible day of the Lord i'll send you elijah and what will he do turn the hearts of the children back to the doctrine of the father's back to the Bible out of these denominational difference and come back to the Bible back to god that's what he would do notice what a great time that we're living in amen praise the Lord all right now in closing let me close here I like I said I'm not going to try to keep you too long here I want you to see these things as you understand can we see clearly how we must love God with all of our heart soul mind the string the way you do that is to keep all the Word of God at every area of your life kick out any sin possibly in our lives jesus said if you say that and do that you're not far from the kingdom of God oh my Olivia all things all your heart all your soul are your mind all your strength give everything to go that's why I don't mind when I'm tired on Monday or Tuesday because I know I've given God all my strength and I when I pray and I give my time and I'm not of time for other things because I'm praying and studying I don't feel bad because I know i give god all my heart amen or you serve people you give the people you serve me but you try to be nice you put it secret and they don't thank you and they don't they don't love God back and all these things like that it's okay because you know you gave got all your heart and all your mind amen and all your strength you give all your soul to God we must give ourselves clearly to God and then brother band says at the end of the road will be happy he says is my brother and sister you've got only only got one thing to do in your life you got one thing to do guess what it is it's the first and great command you've got one thing to do in your life that's love the Lord your God with all your heart solve on your strength with all your mind and both everywhere he said is the truth and when you come to the end of your road where you can't go any further then sovereign grace will be projected he preaches sermon divine love in 1956 you give to my love and then once the my love once that finishes then sovereign grace will take over gotta have grace ugh in other words love God with all your heart soul mind and strength and then the end of your robes sovereign grace will take over God's grace God's unmerited favor will take you to the next dimension that's what he's talking about praise God let's stay in our feet I'll stop it right there by the grace of the Lord master what should I do to inherit eternal life love the Lord your God with all your heart soul mind and strength I didn't have time to research this but I know their scriptures in the book of solemn where david said i love the mall they even love the law now most people think your law was a harsh statement they even knew it was God's command so he loved it even under law even under of our unity anyway he could never keep it you can never be born again but yet he still loved the law of God because he loved God and God has his word and see at church I think it Roger ourselves I see in children all the time don't children love routine as a parent seen that they love to know what's going to happen next don't that I teach you the last 13 years I taught him they love routine they love they love consistency they love to know what's going to happen next and that's what the law was the law was just rules and you know what's going to happen you know what to expect you understand I'm trying to say that God's law is a blessing God's law was a blessing in the Old Testament as it was in the New Testament amen but now we have the law of the what the spirit now the spirit gives us a lot the spirit gives us the commands of God Almighty that we must work with I just want you to know that even the Old Testament people love the law people love Noah please God and what made God angry because they wanted to love God they wanted to show God they wanted to serve him with all their heart soul mind and strength because remember that was the command of God in the beginning let's close as we read that Deuteronomy 6 first for me around me 6 verse for the member get ready Drago I already knocked at home while ago this is moses a reversing the story of Israel back to Israel before he died he's going over the law second time that's where you get Deuteronomy the two logs from he's going over it again and he hearses all that god had did for them Deuteronomy 6 verse 1 now these are the commandments the statutes and the judgments which the Lord your God commanded to teach you now you might do them in the land where are you going to possess it that thou mightest fear the Lord God to keep all the statutes and his commandments which I command thee thou and thy son and my son son all the days of my life that nine days maybe prolong not even want instead i'm going to give you lower life if you just keep the commands praise god verse 3 here therefore o Israel absurd to do it that it may be well with thee we want to wet we want to like to be well right amen and that he may increase my tally as the Lord God about your fathers had promised thee in the land it flows with milk and honey hear o Israel the Lord our God is one Lord and thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart with all thy soul and with all thy might and these words which I command thee this day shall be in thine heart and thou shalt teach them diligently unto thy children and shall talk of them without citizen night house and when that walkest by the way we're now lies down and when now rises up now the rest of the chapter he deals with how you must keep all these commands talk them in your home and if you keep these commands you'll cast out verse 19 to cast out all thine enemies from before thee as the Lord has spoken amen this is how you get victory I was hoping you know Benjamin off some of the year this is how you get victory God with all your heart and soul don't give any place for the devil if you do that all you have left is the anointing of God all the evil spirits on your heart and mind there's no spirits at your home or your family or whatever more and you've got the anointing of God to cast out any sphere that would exalt itself again it's the plan of God this is the promise from God the number 23 and he brought us out from thence out of Egypt that he might bring us in hallelujah hey man that's redemption bringing you out and taking you into the Promised Land hallelujah I just bring you out of the world so you'll wander around wonder how to do what to do your whole life but bringing you out to place with a promise that exactly where you're supposed to be in your tribal order amen glory to give us a lab when she's swearing to our fathers and the LORD commanded us to do all these statutes to fear the Lord our God for our good always see the Word of God is always for your good it's always going to be to help you and for your good then he might preserve us alive as it is a state amen praise God let's sing that song I will serve thee because I love me how many loving tonight let us search this love it with all of our hearts all of our soul all of our mind all of our strength if you do that at the end of the road
