[40:26] church age tonight but I want to focus
[40:28] on Zeile and fervency tonight by God's
[40:30] grace so let's look at that thought for
[40:32] tonight relation 3:19

[41:05] verse we'll just read one verse together
[41:06] verse 19 let's read that on three one
[41:10] two three as many as I love I rebuke and

[42:18] house tonight sit have your way tonight
[42:20] in Jesus Christ's name the church said
[42:22] amen god bless you just being seated to
[42:24] praise the Lord so let's look at this
[42:28] thought here tonight by God's grace
[42:30] already setting my watch so I'll try to
[42:31] finish in about an hour by the grace of
[42:33] the Lord
[42:46] so we ended Sunday with the thought
[42:50] about seeking first the kingdom of God
[42:53] and His righteousness we ended with that
[42:55] on Sunday by the grace of Lord so
[42:57] tonight we like to pick up where kind of
[42:59] where we left off in the church age book
[43:01] and just as update to I want to update
[43:04] on our family and our family is almost
[43:06] done with the Bible we got what how many
[43:09] chapters in Song of Solomon do you
[43:10] remember eight okay so we're on chapter
[43:13] five so pretty soon we'll be finishing
[43:15] up the Bible so we're gonna have a
[43:16] shouting rejoicing time there and then
[43:18] we're gonna start reading the church age
[43:20] book as a family together so if you want
[43:23] to read along with us you know we can
[43:25] read it all together you don't you a new
[43:26] family devotions or your personal
[43:28] devotions I don't know how many pages
[43:30] we'll read maybe one or two a day by
[43:32] God's grace but we're gonna start that
[43:35] pretty soon by the grace of the Lord so
[43:37] to update there on that situation now
[43:41] let's look at this thought here we
[43:44] looked extensively at how the false vine
[43:48] has this attitude of I'm rich and I'm
[43:51] increased with Goods I don't need any of
[43:53] the word don't need the real word of God
[43:55] for today the revelation of the word so
[44:00] if that's the case for the false vine
[44:04] the true vine must seek Christ threefold
[44:07] counsel or his advice and I'm sure you
[44:12] know as if your life's like mine there's
[44:14] been stages of your life where you
[44:15] wanted counsel from people all
[44:18] throughout my life I can look back and
[44:20] see you know there's times when I was
[44:22] right before I was ready to get hired as
[44:23] a teacher I went to Samuel browning for
[44:25] counsel because I knew he was a teacher
[44:27] and I asked him you know how do you get
[44:29] a job and what's the teaching life like
[44:31] and different ones you know before I
[44:35] went to before I became a pastor I went
[44:37] to talk to James browning and Samuel
[44:39] browning and before I started preaching
[44:41] I talked to her brother Tim Myers and
[44:43] brother Brooks and different ones and
[44:45] there was different times in my life
[44:47] where I was seeking counsel but Christ
[44:50] tells all of us we must seek his counsel
[44:52] he tells us quite plainly I counsel the
[44:56] so I'm advising you to buy of me the
[45:00] goal that's tried in the fire so we this
[45:04] is something we have to gain from Christ
[45:06] we have to purchase this from Christ the
[45:09] gold of God
[45:10] we also have to purchase the white
[45:12] raiment from him by of me this so make
[45:15] an exchange make a spiritual exchange
[45:18] and I'll gladly do that I'll gladly give
[45:21] up my unbelief for his gold amen
[45:23] I'll gladly said the Bible says buy the
[45:26] truth and sell it not amen
[45:28] we'll gladly do that how gladly buy all
[45:30] the truth I can get I'll give whatever
[45:32] it takes amen my time my repentance
[45:35] whatever it takes I'll buy the truth and
[45:37] I won't sell it amen he says the second
[45:41] fold is white clothes or white raiment
[45:43] that you may be clothed that the shame
[45:46] of your nakedness do not appear and the
[45:49] third thing is eyes that are anointed
[45:51] with ice I'll buy that from Christ that
[45:54] you may see and then Jesus says as many
[45:57] as I love I rebuke and chasten thus be
[46:00] zealous therefore and repent now let's
[46:02] look at some of this I didn't get to
[46:04] this on Sunday this is what I was trying
[46:05] to get to because when I wrote the book
[46:07] I finished chapter 8 with this thought I
[46:10] finish the last chapter with this idea
[46:12] and I took this the part right here
[46:15] about white raiment I took that and
[46:17] applied it spiritually and then
[46:19] naturally spiritually we must be must be
[46:22] closed with the eternal life which is
[46:24] the power of the Holy Ghost the seal of
[46:26] the Holy Ghost
[46:27] that the nakedness of our soul doesn't
[46:29] appear but then it also applies
[46:32] naturally because we live in an age
[46:33] where it's just like the days of Noah
[46:35] and the Bible said the sons of God saw
[46:37] the daughters of men that they were fair
[46:39] and of course they were probably sexy
[46:41] dress or they were dressed immodestly so
[46:44] we know there's a double application
[46:46] there's both spiritual and natural we
[46:48] understand that today by the grace of
[46:50] the Lord but let's look at some of these
[46:52] scriptures here so we need some Bible
[46:54] readers tonight by God's grace maybe
[46:55] Malachi Elijah and Lydia Rebecca could
[46:58] read some scriptures for so that'd be
[46:59] okay all right so let's go to first
[47:01] Peter 1:7 why don't Lydia why don't you
[47:04] get that one you're the oldest here
[47:05] we'll have you go first you're the
[47:06] bravest I'm sure
[47:08] first Peter 1:7 and Elijah can you get
[47:11] 2nd Corinthians 4:18 that'd be okay and
[47:14] Malachi can you get Matthew 13 five and
[47:17] six then Rebecca maybe Matthew 13 2021
[47:22] alright okay
[47:24] so Lydia when you're ready first Peter
[47:26] 1:7 amen so when we buy gold from Christ
[47:43] it means we've exchanged our rights to
[47:49] act however we want we've exchanged that
[47:51] we've sacrificed worldly pleasures we've
[47:55] sacrificed our choices and we've chosen
[47:58] to accept the faith of Christ in other
[48:01] words we've chosen the hard way that's
[48:03] what the scripture is all about when you
[48:05] would get the gold of God gold is
[48:07] time-tested faith you have gone through
[48:10] the fires of God's tests amen
[48:13] so you've exchanged an easy life and
[48:15] Christ has given you the gold through
[48:19] hard trials that's what the exchange has
[48:21] done you could have taken the easy way
[48:23] out like the rich young ruler could have
[48:25] sold out your gonna take another easy
[48:27] ways out like missus lot you know you
[48:30] could have done other easy ways and not
[48:32] obey the Word of God but we but when you
[48:34] obey the Word of God and you go through
[48:36] fires of tests fires of affliction then
[48:39] Christ rewards you with gold character
[48:42] or christ-like character build upon
[48:44] faith so faith time-tested faith is the
[48:48] gold of God it's the character of Christ
[48:52] okay
[48:53] Elisha can you read 2nd Corinthians 4:18
[48:55] please
[49:10] amen thank you so see the gold of God
[49:13] that go through the trials and so you
[49:16] have this faith as you go through the
[49:18] trials and this faith the word faith
[49:20] doesn't mean assurance it does mean that
[49:22] that's actual definition assurance on
[49:24] the promise of God or the revelation
[49:26] you're assured of God's Word because
[49:28] it's been revealed to you so as you go
[49:31] through the trials you have assurance in
[49:33] the unseen you're not looking at the
[49:35] natural situation you're looking at the
[49:38] spiritual situation amen you're looking
[49:40] at God's promises what God said you're
[49:43] not looking at the temporal things
[49:44] you're looking at the things that are
[49:46] unchanging amen
[49:48] that's how you have the gold of God you
[49:50] your faith is strengthening the fire
[49:52] your faith is looking at the unseen this
[49:55] is what Christ wants us to buy from him
[49:57] amen hallelujah and lastly there Malachi
[50:02] Matthew 13 five and six okay so the
[50:19] reason people don't have the gold
[50:21] character of Christ is because they fall
[50:23] away during the times of trial that's so
[50:27] they can't get the gold of God they're
[50:29] not they haven't sold out for that they
[50:30] haven't bought it you've got to actually
[50:33] go through persecution destitution
[50:36] you've got to go through trials
[50:38] hardships valleys we'd say but see most
[50:42] people give up now Rebecca can you read
[50:44] 2021 please in chapter 13
[51:21] amen that's what we see here people
[51:23] can't get the gold of God because they
[51:26] give up times get too hard and so they
[51:28] compromise on the Word of God
[51:30] persecution comes they get offended oh I
[51:32] can't believe these Christians actually
[51:34] believe that well fine if they're gonna
[51:35] act like that we're not gonna go there
[51:38] now I was talking to a gentleman on the
[51:40] phone last week I invited him me to
[51:43] church and and he said well what is your
[51:48] church like and I said well the first
[51:50] thing you'll notice is the different
[51:52] dressed women that's because I wanted to
[51:53] be I would want to be straightforward I
[51:54] hold I want to hide nothing and and so
[51:58] he said what do you mean you women only
[52:00] wear skirts and all these things and
[52:01] what do you mean I said it's all in the
[52:02] Bible his name is Donnie
[52:04] I said Donnie it's on the Bible man I
[52:06] said when you really love Christ you'll
[52:08] want to do everything that he says and
[52:11] it's not it's not Grievous to obey God's
[52:13] commands it's a joy and pretty soon he
[52:16] got offended you know he I could hear in
[52:17] his voice now he's laughing a nice baby
[52:19] he's like he's like are you gonna
[52:21] instill your dress code upon me and I
[52:23] have to wear jeans and what do you mean
[52:24] I can't wear shorts you know and pretty
[52:27] soon he got offended you know I said oh
[52:28] don't get offended you know this is just
[52:30] God's Word I said you just come as you
[52:32] are come as you are and then whatever
[52:34] God reveals to you that's what you obey
[52:36] I said we don't enforce art we don't
[52:38] kick anybody out of church if you know
[52:40] if they have short hair if they're a
[52:42] woman or if a man's got dreadlocks we
[52:44] don't kick them out of the church you
[52:45] know that's never happened yet but
[52:46] you'll of course people coming here all
[52:48] the time your visitors coming here on
[52:49] time maybe not respecting our our
[52:51] beliefs but that's ok they probably
[52:52] don't know our beliefs but it's just so
[52:55] interesting to see how easily he was
[52:56] offended but this this is this scripture
[53:00] right here is why people don't get the
[53:02] gold of God they don't go through the
[53:04] fire you've got to go through the fire
[53:06] you've got to feel the heat you've got
[53:08] to feel the heat of persecution you've
[53:11] got to feel the heat of being offended
[53:13] right people are offended with you
[53:15] because you stand on the Word of God and
[53:17] only after going through that through
[53:20] the heat the persecution the heat of
[53:22] offending or the heat of offending your
[53:23] family and friends only after that can
[53:25] you have this gold faint that's tried by
[53:28] fire amen
[53:30] that's how it comes and Jesus said
[53:31] you've got
[53:32] to buy that from me if you want to get
[53:34] through later to see how you need the
[53:35] goal of God amen hallelujah
[53:38] now the light rain that amen this is
[53:41] beautified I was really blessed by this
[53:43] now look at the word righteousness
[53:45] here's what righteousness means I'm just
[53:47] gonna skip ahead a little bit
[53:48] it means integrity virtue purity of life
[53:52] rightness correctness of thinking and
[53:55] feeling and acting because we know the
[53:57] Bible said white raiment is the
[53:59] righteousness of the saints in
[54:01] Revelation 19 verse 8
[54:03] so that righteousness means integrity so
[54:07] a Christian who has on the raiment of
[54:09] God is so anointed by the Holy Ghost
[54:12] that their lives are full of Christian
[54:14] integrity amen
[54:16] in other words they do what is right all
[54:17] the time amen hallelujah so that's again
[54:21] subscription I said revelation 19:8 now
[54:25] overcomers in the Sardis Church age the
[54:27] Bible said they owe their reward will be
[54:29] white raiment which is the righteousness
[54:32] of saints let's go to Romans 8 for this
[54:36] will be a good one for us to read Romans
[54:37] eight four and Lydia are you okay with
[54:39] that one now this is Romans eight it's a
[54:42] beautiful chapter I read it recently in
[54:44] my devotions if you haven't read it oh
[54:45] my I'd read it it talks about walking
[54:47] the spirit and then of course it ends
[54:49] with that beautiful string of promises
[54:52] deaths will not separate a sparrow
[54:54] nothing can separate us from the love of
[54:56] God amen
[54:57] revelation I'm sure Romans eight for
[54:59] Lydia when you're ready okay this is
[55:07] what God is trying to do with the
[55:09] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[55:10] he's trying us to live the righteousness
[55:13] of the law I mean oh the Bible said the
[55:15] law is holy the law is good the Old
[55:18] Testament law was holy and good it
[55:19] cannot be lived if you try to do a
[55:21] checklist and live everything then
[55:23] you've gone back to legalism but if you
[55:26] got the baptism of the Holy Ghost then
[55:28] the Bible says you want to do what's
[55:29] right yes you want you freely surrender
[55:33] you're a prisoner of love and you always
[55:35] want to do what's right just in the
[55:37] sight of God that's integrity you always
[55:39] want to do what's right
[55:40] so righteousness is walking in the
[55:42] spirit I'm choosing to walk in the
[55:45] spirit
[55:46] and I'm not walking pleasing my flesh
[55:47] I'm walking obedience of the word of God
[55:51] remember jesus said when the Holy Ghost
[55:53] comes he said you'll be endued with
[55:54] power from on high
[55:56] and that word endued means clothing so
[55:59] the clothing of course has to be this
[56:00] white raiment so the baptism of the Holy
[56:03] Ghost gives you a spiritual it looks
[56:06] like a spiritual clothing where you have
[56:08] the power to live a righteous life and
[56:11] that's what righteousness is integrity
[56:13] or moral uprightness now and this is the
[56:20] clothes of the kingdom people let's go
[56:22] to Romans 14:17 this is a beautiful
[56:24] Romans forty logic can you read this one
[56:26] please so I should ask you sooner Romans
[56:28] 14:17 Amen this is the kingdom of God
[56:41] someone who's living righteous right
[56:44] someone who has peace in their life amen
[56:47] someone who's got joy of the Holy Ghost
[56:49] this is the kingdom people amen
[56:51] this is what it's not so much meat and
[56:54] drink it's not the natural things that
[56:55] you possess or choose the doer
[56:57] necessarily like the the areas of
[56:59] Christian Liberty we preach on that's
[57:00] not really the kingdom of God the
[57:02] kingdom of God is possessing all these
[57:04] spiritual qualities amen hallelujah
[57:08] people that want to live a life of
[57:10] integrity by the Holy Spirit people that
[57:13] want to live a life of peace people that
[57:15] want to live a life of joy of the Holy
[57:17] Ghost this is what we're striving for
[57:19] amen this is what we're battling for and
[57:22] Jesus says buy this from me you can have
[57:24] peace you just got to buy it from me you
[57:27] can have joy you can have righteousness
[57:28] just got to buy it from me and I he said
[57:31] I'm giving you counsel I'm giving you
[57:33] advice come buy this for me amen
[57:35] all right so that's the definition again
[57:38] I Sal let's look at I sell let's go to
[57:40] Ephesians 1 17 18 Malachi and maybe
[57:43] Rebecca if we get read out visions 1 17
[57:47] and 18
[57:50] myself is the understanding or we'd say
[57:56] the wisdom and revelation of our calling
[57:58] and inheritance in Christ that's what
[58:01] the Bible says because I sob of course
[58:04] would heal your eyes and allow you to
[58:06] see and that's what the Bible says about
[58:08] sight being your when your eyes are
[58:10] illuminated you understand God's calling
[58:13] for your life amen
[58:15] see only a person who's really filled
[58:17] with the Holy Ghost will understand the
[58:19] calling of their life and how important
[58:22] the calling of God is on their life
[58:26] visions 1 17 and 18 Malachi run don't
[58:29] you do 17 and Rebekah 18 as it is okay
[58:32] all right amen thank you
[58:57] that beautiful my when your eyes are
[59:01] enlightened by the Holy Spirit with the
[59:03] eye salve of God you have wisdom and
[59:07] revelation in the knowledge of Christ
[59:10] and not only that but you Bible also
[59:12] says when you have that now you
[59:14] understand the hope of his calling
[59:17] what is the calling of Christ what is
[59:19] the calling of God for my life when
[59:22] you've got eyes of I self and you can
[59:24] see you understand what his calling is
[59:27] for your life there's a hope behind that
[59:29] and it's also you understand the riches
[59:32] of the glory of his inheritance in the
[59:35] Saints you understand the possessions
[59:39] that are waiting for you on the other
[59:41] side all the treasures that are stored
[59:44] up in heaven amen you understand that
[59:47] when you've got the eye salve on that's
[59:49] that's because you don't live for today
[59:51] you don't live for tomorrow
[59:53] you don't live for next year you're not
[59:55] living for this world you're living for
[59:57] heaven amen
[59:59] that's people who have the eye cell that
[1:00:02] Christ offers
[1:00:03] they know the hope of their they
[1:00:05] know their inheritance and that's I was
[1:00:08] preaching on Tuesday morning with the
[1:00:10] middle schoolers I said that's what a
[1:00:11] priest does a priest stores up treasure
[1:00:14] in heaven
[1:00:15] remember Cornelius how did corneas get a
[1:00:17] memorial in heaven he fasted prayed and
[1:00:20] gave alms to the poor and so there was
[1:00:23] these memorials in heaven a memorial to
[1:00:26] corny noses prayers I'm like the Lincoln
[1:00:29] Memorial children's it looks like the
[1:00:31] Lincoln Memorial there was memorials in
[1:00:33] heaven amen
[1:00:35] there's memorials there's something
[1:00:37] there in heaven that's a witness of our
[1:00:40] desires to please God hey men we know
[1:00:44] the hope of our calling hallelujah
[1:00:47] that's beautiful night thank you Jesus I
[1:00:51] love the other Word of God it interprets
[1:00:52] itself but around calls that golden
[1:00:54] nuggets hallelujah your eyes have iced
[1:00:57] out and the Bible says your eyes are
[1:00:59] enlightened to know the hope of your
[1:01:01] calling and the inheritance of the
[1:01:03] saints amen now remember few will be
[1:01:06] saved according to Matthew 7:14 meaning
[1:01:09] most church members are blind followers
[1:01:11] blind leading blind followers of blind
[1:01:14] leaders jesus said let the blind lead
[1:01:17] the blind so they cannot understand the
[1:01:21] call of God if they're following blind
[1:01:23] teachers that God would never want them
[1:01:26] to follow a blind teacher so they are
[1:01:29] blind following the blind they don't
[1:01:31] know the hope of his calling
[1:01:32] they don't have wisdom in revelation but
[1:01:35] those who are saved those whose eyes
[1:01:37] have the ice-out they know the hope of
[1:01:39] their calling amen they know where
[1:01:42] they're going they know their life has a
[1:01:44] purpose they know their lives are
[1:01:46] storing up treasures in heaven
[1:01:48] hallelujah and notice Jesus said blessed
[1:01:53] are your eyes of those eyes that can see
[1:01:57] the truth repent and be converted let's
[1:01:59] read that Matthew 13 15 and 16 since
[1:02:04] we're already there in Matthew 13 so
[1:02:07] true
[1:02:08] eyes that are open to the Word of God
[1:02:11] will be able to be healed their lives
[1:02:14] will be healed they'll be able to repent
[1:02:16] and they were able to be converted with
[1:02:17] the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen
[1:02:20] I think the truth I don't know it is
[1:02:22] I'll let you amen
[1:02:24] this is eyes that have ice al bond them
[1:02:28] weatherman called it grease that's
[1:02:29] how he tried to get that people to
[1:02:31] remember to grease I've never had to use
[1:02:34] grease or anything but I have had
[1:02:36] to rub my eyes to get the matter out of
[1:02:38] my eyes but he had grease Matthew
[1:02:41] 13 15 and 16 I'll read this for this
[1:02:46] people's heart is waxed gross and their
[1:02:48] ears are dull of hearing and their eyes
[1:02:51] they have closed lest at any time they
[1:02:54] should see with their eyes and hear with
[1:02:55] their ears and should understand with
[1:02:57] their heart see again they don't
[1:02:59] understand up there unless they have
[1:03:00] ice-out they'll understand what God has
[1:03:02] for them lost my spot and hear with
[1:03:09] their ears and should understand with
[1:03:10] their heart and should be converted and
[1:03:14] I should heal heal them but blessed are
[1:03:17] your eyes for they see and your ears for
[1:03:20] they hear amen aren't you glad you've
[1:03:24] been converted praise God hallelujah if
[1:03:26] you have been your eyes have been
[1:03:29] anointed your eyes can see glory this is
[1:03:32] what Jesus said your eyes are blessed
[1:03:34] when they're like this praise the Lord
[1:03:37] now let's look at this thought on being
[1:03:39] zealous and repent worried what the
[1:03:41] prophet of God wrote in the church age
[1:03:45] book and then was just end with the
[1:03:46] Bible study cuz I got about 36 more
[1:03:48] minutes that's that'd be good
[1:03:49] I think we'll get through the Bible
[1:03:50] study here so I want to look at this
[1:03:54] thought on zealous and repent here's
[1:03:55] what brother Branham says be zealous to
[1:03:56] repent now this false Church has zeal
[1:03:59] make no mistake about that her zeal has
[1:04:02] literally been that of the Jews John and
[1:04:06] I think they courted the wrong scripture
[1:04:07] here in the church age book just because
[1:04:09] this is about Jesus the zeal of night
[1:04:11] house has eaten me up
[1:04:12] I think they wrote the wrong scripture
[1:04:14] down he said her zeal has been literally
[1:04:17] that of the Jews the zeal of the house
[1:04:18] has eaten me up but it is the wrong zeal
[1:04:20] Jesus
[1:04:22] zeal was the right Zeos I think remember
[1:04:24] the church age book ain't a Bible says
[1:04:26] it's not the Bible shouldn't say ain't
[1:04:27] it is not the Bible that's not a real
[1:04:30] word but see they've got the wrong zeal
[1:04:34] the Jews had the wrong zeal it is for
[1:04:36] the house of their own building right we
[1:04:39] see that today with denominations I've
[1:04:41] told you recently I visited some
[1:04:42] Pentecostal churches the loudest cheers
[1:04:44] were for the brand-new building they
[1:04:46] were building it wasn't for worship it
[1:04:49] wasn't for praise it wasn't for somebody
[1:04:50] at the altar wasn't behold our God it
[1:04:54] was oh he got we're almost ready to
[1:04:55] build our new church there was more zeal
[1:04:59] for buildings than there was for the
[1:05:01] spiritual blocks that were being builded
[1:05:03] into people's lives amen we ought to
[1:05:05] have more rejoicing in what God is doing
[1:05:07] spirits in our lives than naturally
[1:05:10] hallelujah it just shows what is our
[1:05:13] zeal what are we most excited about at
[1:05:15] church see in somebody's new shoes well
[1:05:19] maybe we'll get a new building or maybe
[1:05:21] we'll do this or maybe we'll do that the
[1:05:24] zeal we should have the most excitement
[1:05:26] we should have is what God is doing
[1:05:28] right now
[1:05:28] praise God knowing what God is doing
[1:05:31] right we don't want to be good just
[1:05:33] remember we did yesterday or think about
[1:05:35] what to do in the future we have to see
[1:05:36] what God is doing right now amen
[1:05:40] he said it was for their own creeds
[1:05:42] dogmas organizations their own
[1:05:44] righteousness they have put the word out
[1:05:47] for their own ideas they disposed the
[1:05:50] Holy Ghost and made men into leaders
[1:05:52] they put aside eternal life as a person
[1:05:54] and make it good works or even church
[1:05:57] conformity rather then good works just
[1:06:01] do what the church says just act like
[1:06:03] everybody else and you'll be saved they
[1:06:06] change that instead of being born again
[1:06:07] by the Holy Ghost just try to fit in
[1:06:09] just try to conform just try to act like
[1:06:11] it we don't want that we want you must
[1:06:14] be born again amen that's the only way
[1:06:17] that's what our zeal should be for not
[1:06:20] for buildings not for physical things
[1:06:22] not for natural things but for the Word
[1:06:24] of God that's right but God is calling
[1:06:29] for another zeal so see the latency and
[1:06:31] zeal is for natural things but God has a
[1:06:33] different zeal it is the
[1:06:35] to cry I'm wrong look at that now who is
[1:06:41] going to say that he is wrong that's a
[1:06:43] good question
[1:06:44] doesn't happen much at least outwardly
[1:06:47] which is okay
[1:06:48] you know you don't have to come to the
[1:06:50] altar every time you want to say say God
[1:06:52] I'm wrong forgive me you have to come to
[1:06:53] know every time for that but we should
[1:06:56] ask ourselves when was the last time we
[1:06:58] said God I'm wrong and thank you for
[1:07:01] correcting me help me to be right that's
[1:07:04] what the seal Christ is looking for for
[1:07:07] someone who can actually say it's my
[1:07:09] fault I see everyday as children why
[1:07:11] they're fussing or why they're arguing
[1:07:13] and they'll blame it on the other person
[1:07:14] I was and they made it is and I asked
[1:07:17] two or three today I asked him who's
[1:07:20] thinking who's in charge of you are you
[1:07:21] in charge of you as your friend in
[1:07:22] charge of you she made me do it is she
[1:07:25] in charge of you or you in charge
[1:07:26] yourself and they always say I'm in
[1:07:27] charge of myself because I talk my
[1:07:29] thinking of the year you're in charge of
[1:07:30] yourself right it's your choice
[1:07:33] and see God wants somebody who wants to
[1:07:35] take ownership and say I'm wrong it's my
[1:07:39] fault
[1:07:39] God wants somebody to zealously say it's
[1:07:42] my fault
[1:07:43] forgive me Lord who's going to say that
[1:07:46] he's wrong not many people today what is
[1:07:48] it that all these denominations are
[1:07:50] based upon that claim to originality and
[1:07:52] that of God they claim that they are
[1:07:54] right they all cannot be right in fact
[1:07:57] not one of them's right there widest up
[1:07:59] liquor swill of dead men's bones they
[1:08:02] have no life they have no vindication
[1:08:03] the program tells us later what the
[1:08:05] vindication is down here hallelujah God
[1:08:08] has never made himself known in any
[1:08:10] organization they say they're right
[1:08:11] because they're the ones that are saying
[1:08:13] it but saying it does not make it so
[1:08:14] they need the vindicated thus saith the
[1:08:17] lord of god and they don't have it
[1:08:19] amen so what makes us right and yet not
[1:08:23] prideful what makes us right is that God
[1:08:25] has given us thus saith the Lord and
[1:08:28] that we have received thus saith the
[1:08:31] Lord
[1:08:31] we have received the authority of the
[1:08:34] interpretation of the word of God amen
[1:08:37] our authority doesn't go over to
[1:08:39] Jeffersonville necessarily our authority
[1:08:41] doesn't go to any denomination or
[1:08:43] organization our authority goes to what
[1:08:46] was said thus saith the Lord about
[1:08:48] Bible amen that's where our thority lies
[1:08:52] in the stay at the Lord this is not my
[1:08:55] thought or your thought this is what the
[1:08:57] Lord says amen and church somebody's
[1:09:01] gonna have to say we're the original
[1:09:02] church somebody's got to say it it might
[1:09:04] as well be us amen might as well be us
[1:09:07] as long as we're not taking away from
[1:09:09] the word as long as we're on adding to
[1:09:11] the Word of God it might as well be you
[1:09:13] and I praise God somebody's got to be
[1:09:15] original I'm one of those original Holy
[1:09:18] Ghost filled Saints amen hallelujah if
[1:09:21] you would have been the day of Pentecost
[1:09:22] I'd have been shouting up there in the
[1:09:24] upper room out of them praising God I
[1:09:26] would have fire over my forehead
[1:09:28] I'd have been speaking and praising God
[1:09:30] with the wonderful works of God how do
[1:09:32] you know because I'm doing it tonight
[1:09:34] amen
[1:09:34] all right I knew it constantly I do it
[1:09:37] consistently it is the desire of my
[1:09:39] heart to know God more and to make more
[1:09:41] people know about God amen
[1:09:44] someone's got to be original and I know
[1:09:46] I preach that original Word of God
[1:09:47] hallelujah that's right that's right
[1:09:52] church week someone's got to be original
[1:09:54] and we must be original we must be
[1:09:56] original Christians hallelujah back to
[1:09:58] the beginning and we must have a zeal
[1:10:00] for it and if we're wrong we must have a
[1:10:01] zeal to say I'm wrong now let me say
[1:10:06] this here I don't believe that God is
[1:10:08] calling only to the false church to
[1:10:09] repent in this verse he's talking to his
[1:10:12] elect because as many as I love I rebuke
[1:10:15] and chasten be zealous therefore the
[1:10:17] ones that I love many of his children
[1:10:21] are still in those false churches they
[1:10:24] are those of whom it speaks in Ephesians
[1:10:27] 5:14 awake thou that sleepest and arise
[1:10:29] from the dead in Christ shall give thee
[1:10:31] light to be asleep as not to be dead
[1:10:33] these are sleeping amongst the dead
[1:10:35] they're out there in the dead
[1:10:36] denominations they are floating along
[1:10:39] with them
[1:10:39] God cries out wake up repent of your
[1:10:42] folly amen
[1:10:45] I'm so glad God went flying over the
[1:10:47] Christian Missionary Alliance about 12
[1:10:51] years ago and called out brother bang
[1:10:54] Isla Delia and he came forth repenting
[1:10:57] right I'm so glad he flew over the Delta
[1:11:00] Assembly of God where I was
[1:11:02] and the Lutheran Church where where my
[1:11:05] wife was I'm so glad he had elect that
[1:11:08] could hear the lawyer to come out say I
[1:11:10] was wrong on baptism I was wrong on
[1:11:12] women's hair I was wrong on these things
[1:11:15] but I want to be right amen
[1:11:17] and I'll zealously say forgive me I was
[1:11:19] wrong let me be right that's exactly
[1:11:23] right
[1:11:23] I was stirred up today brother bang said
[1:11:25] he said sent me a text he said brother
[1:11:27] Jesse can I translate you're bought your
[1:11:29] book into a mom I said brother that's
[1:11:33] the kind of zeal we need amen but I said
[1:11:36] wait till we get it finished so I got
[1:11:37] Matt lighting to read it brother John's
[1:11:39] gonna read it brother Simon brother cam
[1:11:42] and somebody else over the Brian Hawkins
[1:11:45] so far those are the people that can
[1:11:46] help me out read it so far so I said
[1:11:48] give me your Corrections by Sunday I
[1:11:50] want to try to finish in about a week
[1:11:51] and then move it on to my wife and then
[1:11:54] on to a professional editor by God's
[1:11:56] grace I thought my zeal see that's what
[1:11:59] we need zeal to let the mother Eagle fly
[1:12:01] over the chicken yard and find her loss
[1:12:03] Eagles a minute hallelujah we need zeal
[1:12:06] to win those souls amen that's right
[1:12:10] church that's beautiful
[1:12:11] he says he says they're floating along
[1:12:16] with them God cries out wake up repent
[1:12:19] of your folly now we're almost done with
[1:12:20] this partner will do a little Bible
[1:12:21] study here here they are lending their
[1:12:24] in I love this here so there's there
[1:12:27] there were elect Christians that were
[1:12:30] lending their influence how many know
[1:12:31] you got influence you and you can
[1:12:34] influence somebody's like for parents is
[1:12:37] very easy our influence our best
[1:12:39] influence is with our children and each
[1:12:41] other our husbands our wives but
[1:12:43] everybody has influence so the elect
[1:12:45] were in denominations they were lending
[1:12:47] their influence giving their time and
[1:12:49] their money actually their very lives to
[1:12:52] these Antichrist
[1:12:53] organizations and all the while thinking
[1:12:56] it is all right they need to repent wow
[1:13:00] they must repent they need to have a
[1:13:03] change of mind and turn toward truth I
[1:13:06] know this for sure I could tell you this
[1:13:08] and I know cam and Simon wouldn't mind
[1:13:10] me telling but when they first came to
[1:13:11] Jesus they were in the denomination of
[1:13:14] the delt assembly God and they thought
[1:13:15] to the nail with people that didn't
[1:13:17] agree with the Assembly of God
[1:13:18] denomination they had a lot of zeal for
[1:13:22] that organization they were giving their
[1:13:25] time influencing money just like I was
[1:13:27] giving my time influencing money to the
[1:13:29] chapel I was trying to give I was giving
[1:13:32] my all my energy of my money everything
[1:13:35] I was giving my words I was giving
[1:13:37] everything
[1:13:37] - denomination and God said you've got
[1:13:40] to repent you got to come out and you
[1:13:43] got to give the message your influence
[1:13:45] praise God you got to give your time and
[1:13:47] money to the message you got to give
[1:13:50] your very life to the message Amen I
[1:13:53] mean here yeah Amen that's beautiful so
[1:13:57] we have some repenting to new I'm gonna
[1:13:59] give my time my influence my money I'm
[1:14:02] gonna give everything all my life to
[1:14:03] this word of God and I'm happy to do it
[1:14:08] but as I said yes this is the age that
[1:14:11] must
[1:14:12] I'm sorry most needs to repent but with
[1:14:15] it will it bring back the word willin
[1:14:17] again in throne the Holy Spirit and
[1:14:19] men's lives will it again Revere Jesus
[1:14:24] as the only Savior I say not for the
[1:14:28] next verse reveals the astounding and
[1:14:31] shocking truth of the close in this age
[1:14:34] now I'm not going to jump to that verse
[1:14:36] let's look at 0 versus being fervent and
[1:14:40] we'll take a few minutes I got 25 more
[1:14:42] minutes on my watch I'll try to finish
[1:14:43] up in that time by God's grace I think
[1:14:45] I'll be able to do it now we get the
[1:14:48] word zealous I came across that word
[1:14:49] zealous in revelation 3:19 he's talking
[1:14:54] to his elect his elect will be zealous
[1:14:58] and it's interesting you know the last
[1:15:01] few years we've seen amen and who are
[1:15:03] coming the message and brother Adam and
[1:15:05] they have all shown zeal to repent
[1:15:08] because they used to live certain lives
[1:15:10] and do certain things I mean I know a
[1:15:11] lot of the details because I was right
[1:15:13] there after they got saved and I had
[1:15:15] numerous talks with them and I was
[1:15:17] concerned about certain things you know
[1:15:18] just like people are concerned about me
[1:15:20] when I come in the message I'd I had a
[1:15:23] brother tell me recently he was
[1:15:24] concerned when I first come in the
[1:15:25] message that I I wouldn't stay in the
[1:15:27] message
[1:15:29] he said because you know sports and
[1:15:32] athletics and all these things like that
[1:15:34] that kind of hacks a little bit but
[1:15:37] that's just him you know you he probably
[1:15:39] had so many people come in and out you
[1:15:40] know how it is we have the same thing
[1:15:42] here but they were zealous you know how
[1:15:46] do you know because they left everything
[1:15:48] that they used to know to follow the
[1:15:50] Word of God they cut themselves off from
[1:15:53] denominations and youth groups and and
[1:15:55] fellowships with people that enjoyed
[1:15:58] worldly pleasures they cut themselves
[1:16:01] off and they show great zeal to say I'm
[1:16:04] wrong well Jesse teach me what's right
[1:16:06] now it's very glad to teach them what's
[1:16:08] right so they could have a seal they
[1:16:11] could show Jesus their zeal to do what's
[1:16:13] right now the word zeal aside kind of
[1:16:16] made it smaller but zealous means to
[1:16:18] burn with zeal to heat it or to boil
[1:16:21] with injury and and be hatred or anger
[1:16:24] so zeal is a really serious word zeal
[1:16:30] means you're boiling hot in a good sense
[1:16:34] to be zealous in the pursuit of good in
[1:16:36] other words I'm boiling and I'm gonna
[1:16:38] get to that goal I'm gonna get to that
[1:16:41] promise of God amen that's zeal zeal is
[1:16:45] I'm boiling over and I'm gonna do
[1:16:47] something good for the kingdom of God
[1:16:49] that's what zeal means to earnestly
[1:16:52] pursue nothing is going to get my way of
[1:16:54] making the rapture amen how did I know
[1:16:57] yeah nothing's going to get my way of
[1:17:00] glorifying God in my life
[1:17:02] of having a better prayer life amen
[1:17:05] nothing's gonna get in the way of me
[1:17:06] reading my Bible and knowing more about
[1:17:08] the knowledge of God hallelujah
[1:17:11] nothing's going to get my way because
[1:17:13] I've got zeal that's what does it zeal
[1:17:17] is that boiling power in our lives that
[1:17:20] gives us that desire to pursue and
[1:17:22] actually achieve what we're pursuing to
[1:17:26] strive after to desire earnestly too
[1:17:29] busy oneself about him to exert oneself
[1:17:32] for one that he might not be torn from
[1:17:35] me so see holding on to the word right
[1:17:37] holding on to the promise of God to be
[1:17:40] the object of zeal of others to be
[1:17:42] zealously saw
[1:17:42] after to envy be zealous and what repent
[1:17:48] that's the call for the elect of this
[1:17:50] hour so have a earn earnestly pursue
[1:17:53] repentance I'm going to repent I'm gonna
[1:17:55] leave everything I used to know in the
[1:17:58] world everything I used to love I'm just
[1:18:00] gonna run away from it as hard as I can
[1:18:02] and I'm gonna pursue righteousness glory
[1:18:06] zeal and fervency are very closely
[1:18:09] related now pay attention
[1:18:10] I don't not a Greek scholar but notice
[1:18:12] the number here sorry 2020 206 for zeal
[1:18:15] now look at the word fervent it's number
[1:18:18] 20 204 and I know there's some relation
[1:18:21] there with root words and root meanings
[1:18:22] there's some relation with the number in
[1:18:24] the concordance so the word fervent is
[1:18:26] very similar to boil with heat to be hot
[1:18:31] of water metaphorically use a boiling
[1:18:34] anger boiling love boiling zeal for what
[1:18:39] is good
[1:18:41] fervent spirit set of zeal for what is
[1:18:44] good so it's kind of like fervency and
[1:18:47] zeal are synonyms they kind they both
[1:18:50] mean boil I proved that to you by the
[1:18:52] Greek they both mean boiling their
[1:18:54] numbers are really close together so
[1:18:55] that looks like they have something
[1:18:57] similar about them Zi Luo Zelo and then
[1:19:01] that's Jo so they're really close words
[1:19:06] there now I'm gonna go back let's just
[1:19:11] to Bible study here on this by God's
[1:19:13] grace I got about twenty minutes now yep
[1:19:16] 21 minutes let's just do a scripture
[1:19:17] study here let's start with zeal now
[1:19:23] remember this is a boiling curve it I'm
[1:19:26] sorry boiling desire so there's numerous
[1:19:31] scriptures I think I members just hit a
[1:19:34] few of them here most of us remember
[1:19:36] Phineas I remember ragin have you
[1:19:38] remember Phineas he was a Jewish man and
[1:19:42] let's just Rita this chord number is 25
[1:19:44] 11 let's go there numbers 25 11 let's
[1:19:46] read that and maybe Lydia and Elijah
[1:19:50] maybe we can read that their numbers 25
[1:19:53] 11
[1:20:00] now you know the story most of you may
[1:20:03] know it Balaam had joined forces with
[1:20:06] King Balak I always so I always say
[1:20:09] barrack but it's Balak it's Balak and he
[1:20:13] wasn't supposed to
[1:20:14] he couldn't curse Israel but he said I
[1:20:16] know I can get Israel to fall I know how
[1:20:18] I can get God angry in Israel and that's
[1:20:20] the cause and the fall into fornication
[1:20:21] so he invited them to beoh peor and they
[1:20:24] had a feast down there a drunken party
[1:20:26] with women and they fornicated and God
[1:20:28] destroyed 24,000 if not more there's
[1:20:30] different there's a few different
[1:20:31] scriptures that talk about but over
[1:20:33] 20,000 people that were killed because
[1:20:36] of the fornication numbers 25 11 12 and
[1:20:41] 13
[1:20:42] Lydia run it you do 11 and 12 and Elijah
[1:20:44] 13 to that oh yeah did he go ahead 13
[1:21:19] amen thank you what was his atonement he
[1:21:23] went into the tent of that Israel leader
[1:21:25] and he thrust a spear through him and
[1:21:27] that midnight woman that was his
[1:21:31] atonement and God looked at the zeal and
[1:21:34] said your family now is going to have a
[1:21:36] covenant of peace you're gonna be
[1:21:38] priests in Israel forever because he so
[1:21:43] wanted to see sin stopped in his church
[1:21:45] can I say like that God loves zeal as
[1:21:49] long as it's the right kind of zeal God
[1:21:52] loves it God rewarded him with the
[1:21:54] priesthood forever
[1:21:56] that's quite striking here's another one
[1:22:01] you remember once we read it well let's
[1:22:03] read about Jihu again let's go to 2nd
[1:22:06] Kings 10 this is right after he slew
[1:22:20] Jezebel he wasn't done after that this
[1:22:23] man had the zeal of God he was not done
[1:22:25] destroying God's enemies
[1:22:27] that's quite striking so second Kings
[1:22:31] 10:1 231 we're not gonna read all this
[1:22:33] but let's just read a few of the verses
[1:22:35] because it's quite powerful alright now
[1:22:45] I'll just read some of these here let's
[1:22:46] go to verse 7 and it came to pass when
[1:22:47] the letter came to them that they took
[1:22:49] the king's sons and slew 70 persons and
[1:22:52] put their heads in baskets and sent them
[1:22:53] to Jezreel and there came a messenger
[1:22:55] told him saying they have brought the
[1:22:57] heads of the king's sons and he said lay
[1:22:59] ye them and two heaps at the entering in
[1:23:02] of the gate until morning and it came to
[1:23:04] pass in the morning that he went out and
[1:23:05] stood and said all the people ye be
[1:23:07] righteous behold I conspired against my
[1:23:09] master and sue him but who slew all
[1:23:11] these know now that there shall fall on
[1:23:14] to the earth nothing of the word of Lord
[1:23:16] which the Lord spake concerning the
[1:23:17] house of Ahab for the Lord had done that
[1:23:19] which he spake by servant Elijah Shoji
[1:23:22] who slew all that remain of the house
[1:23:24] that they have been Jezreel it all his
[1:23:26] great men and his kinfolks
[1:23:28] and his priest until left them none
[1:23:30] remaining he destroyed all the seat of a
[1:23:33] hem all the seat of their offspring of
[1:23:36] Jezebel and then he met a brethren and
[1:23:40] one of the brethren said who are you and
[1:23:42] this is quite striking this is where he
[1:23:44] says it look at verse 16 and he said
[1:23:47] come with me and see my zeal for the
[1:23:49] Lord he wasn't done yet he was gonna go
[1:23:53] kill more of the Habs offspring and
[1:23:56] Jezebel's offspring and they made him
[1:24:00] ride in his chariot so he said sit in my
[1:24:02] chair it come see my zeal for the Lord
[1:24:06] remember what did this woman do she
[1:24:08] moved her husband to kill innocent
[1:24:10] people
[1:24:11] hundreds of godly priests she killed she
[1:24:14] painted her
[1:24:15] she introduced idolatry into Israel
[1:24:18] built a temple in Samaria the biggest
[1:24:20] temple ever and this is what Jay who
[1:24:23] does is powerful for this remember this
[1:24:26] is the story where G who tricks them and
[1:24:29] he says he said oh if a hab did a little
[1:24:32] for bail he said gee who's gonna do
[1:24:33] great things for bail he said and by all
[1:24:36] the bail worshippers to the house of
[1:24:37] bail and they all came they flooded the
[1:24:40] Church of bail and then G who tricked
[1:24:43] him and he said shut these and lock the
[1:24:45] doors he says because every one of these
[1:24:47] bail worshipers is gonna die and the
[1:24:50] Bible said he's through every one of
[1:24:52] them by tricking them and that he said
[1:24:55] come see my zeal amen so zeal is
[1:24:59] terminating any evil influence in your
[1:25:03] life that's why I got great respect for
[1:25:05] people if their phone is bothering them
[1:25:07] or an app's bother them they need to get
[1:25:09] rid of that app they need to get rid of
[1:25:12] their phone if they don't have the
[1:25:13] character to handle a phone get rid of
[1:25:15] the phone you've got to cut it off right
[1:25:18] either cut it off or God will cut you
[1:25:21] off from the anointing like we preached
[1:25:22] on God delights in people who are
[1:25:26] zealous to repent amen that's exactly
[1:25:30] right and this is the story that's what
[1:25:33] the Bible says now look look at verse 30
[1:25:36] look what God blesses Jihu with now G
[1:25:39] who back slid at the end of his life I
[1:25:41] don't know if you knew that but he backs
[1:25:42] it then of his life but God because of
[1:25:45] his zeal in this moment of anointing God
[1:25:47] blesses four generations after him four
[1:25:53] generations now a member of the Bible
[1:25:57] says the cursings go to generations but
[1:25:59] also the blessings go to generations
[1:26:01] because remember Levi payed ties while
[1:26:04] he was in the loins the private parts of
[1:26:06] Abraham Levi was somewhere in the loins
[1:26:10] of Abraham and God already saw his
[1:26:12] righteousness that Levi is gonna pay me
[1:26:14] ties amen glory it's going to visit
[1:26:18] generation upon generation upon
[1:26:21] generation I'll say of this I'm excited
[1:26:22] to see what the generations of my
[1:26:24] children are gonna do a pen if God has
[1:26:26] done this in my life
[1:26:27] if God
[1:26:28] cut out all this sin and reverse curses
[1:26:31] of my family oh I want to see what God's
[1:26:34] gonna do in my generations ain't met if
[1:26:35] he tarries but I'll be happy if we take
[1:26:38] a rapture amen
[1:26:39] but either way if God terry's I want to
[1:26:42] see the righteousness visit the next
[1:26:44] four generations
[1:26:45] look at verse 30 and the Lord said unto
[1:26:47] G who because thou has done well in
[1:26:49] executing that which is right in mine
[1:26:51] eyes and that's done unto the house that
[1:26:53] I have according to all the ways that
[1:26:55] was in whose heart God's heart it was in
[1:26:59] God's heart to kill those men because
[1:27:03] God is a God of judgment God is a
[1:27:06] faithful judge it was God so I remember
[1:27:09] they cut their heads off and put him in
[1:27:10] heaps remember that whose heart was that
[1:27:12] in that was in God's heart because God
[1:27:16] had given them a temporary judgment
[1:27:18] because of all their sins there we would
[1:27:21] say like this they're reprobate Minds I
[1:27:23] mean though the Bible says God is
[1:27:25] long-suffering in this hour God is rich
[1:27:28] in mercy God is so long-suffering in
[1:27:30] this hour that was in God's heart to
[1:27:33] throw Jezebel off there and that's hard
[1:27:36] church it might be hard for some people
[1:27:37] understand but that was in God's heart
[1:27:40] to have the chair run over her and the
[1:27:42] dogs lick her blood because of all the
[1:27:45] evil that she brought upon the people of
[1:27:47] God that's the Bible so now make up
[1:27:52] don't look so good does it
[1:27:53] does it cutting off God's prophets not
[1:27:57] listening bad-mouthing God's prophet
[1:27:58] doesn't look so good does it now because
[1:28:01] God said I'll visit the next generations
[1:28:03] and destroy them look at verse 31 but G
[1:28:07] who took no heed to walk in the law I'm
[1:28:10] sorry I didn't even finish that let's
[1:28:12] finish verse 30 has done unto the house
[1:28:14] of Ahab according to all that was in
[1:28:15] mine are thy children of the fourth
[1:28:17] generation shall sit on the throne of
[1:28:19] Israel amen
[1:28:21] because you executed my judgment your
[1:28:24] children will rule amen a church if we
[1:28:28] can rule over flesh sin the world the
[1:28:30] devil maybe our children will rule over
[1:28:32] those things for three and four
[1:28:34] generations amen if God Jerry's Amen if
[1:28:37] God could help me to reign over sin how
[1:28:39] much more my children reign over sin
[1:28:42] hey man how do ya thank you Jesus amen
[1:28:46] what a blessing what a what a great
[1:28:49] victory our lays ahead for the believer
[1:28:51] Amen that righteousness will visit the
[1:28:54] next generations but lo here's where G
[1:28:58] who falls so see this is a good case of
[1:29:02] zeal that doesn't continue we must make
[1:29:06] sure our zeal never never dies what
[1:29:10] brother M say he said never lose your
[1:29:11] what that he word never lose your
[1:29:13] enthusiasm your zeal never lose your
[1:29:18] zeal G who lost his zeal look at verse 2
[1:29:21] the only one but G who took no heed to
[1:29:23] walk in the law of the Lord of God of
[1:29:25] Israel with all his heart for he
[1:29:28] departed not from the sins of jeroboam
[1:29:29] which made Israel to sin so he got
[1:29:32] anointed a guy excited for a few years
[1:29:34] had some real great pouring out the
[1:29:36] wrath of God but when the anointing left
[1:29:38] him for that he back slid he lost his
[1:29:41] zeal we've got to make sure we don't
[1:29:44] lose our zeal that old phrase got to
[1:29:46] make sure we keep our first love but God
[1:29:50] will reward you for your zeal hallelujah
[1:29:56] you like that church you like that now
[1:29:58] Psalm 69 9 we're not going to go there
[1:30:00] but it's the same as John 2:17 they
[1:30:02] looked at Jesus clearing out the temple
[1:30:04] above moneychangers and said the zeal of
[1:30:06] the Lord have eaten me up
[1:30:09] Jesus was consumed with holiness a holy
[1:30:12] burning desire God's house must be a
[1:30:15] house of prayer we shouldn't come to
[1:30:18] church and try to make thing about deals
[1:30:20] we can make financially that's what they
[1:30:22] were coming to church do it a bunch of
[1:30:24] thieves a bunch of money changers Amen
[1:30:26] yeah we must come to church saying God
[1:30:28] provide for my needs but not how can we
[1:30:30] make a bad deal and how can we get rich
[1:30:32] quick and all these things like that we
[1:30:34] should come to the house of God in
[1:30:35] prayer that's right Church and then when
[1:30:40] he clean out that dirty old church they
[1:30:42] said all the zeal of the house has eaten
[1:30:44] him up
[1:30:46] he's so zealous he's knocking tables
[1:30:49] over he's letting the animals fly right
[1:30:51] he's a he's getting oh corn out and
[1:30:54] whipping all the all the disobedient
[1:30:56] ones making a move to get the sin out of
[1:30:58] the church and brother BAM said we could
[1:31:02] use some he said some pew jumpers in
[1:31:05] this hour he could say we could use some
[1:31:08] of that throw to overview sometimes if
[1:31:10] sin is allowed to exist in our myths we
[1:31:13] should cut it off and those preachers
[1:31:16] are cut it off they have the zeal of God
[1:31:17] God will honor them amen that's why
[1:31:21] we've God has honored many of these
[1:31:22] preachers that we listen to that have
[1:31:23] lasted for so many years because they've
[1:31:25] always cut against sin God loves that
[1:31:29] God loves the zeal the Lord
[1:31:32] that'll skin our hide or skin anybody's
[1:31:34] hide in order to produce a righteous
[1:31:36] life go to Isaiah 9:6 this is familiar
[1:31:41] let's read this one but I'm not sure if
[1:31:43] you saw this afterwards Isaiah 9:6 the
[1:31:48] burning fervent desire of God will do
[1:31:50] this the boiling hatred anger or in a
[1:31:55] good sense the the zealous pursuit of
[1:31:58] good God is going to pursue what is good
[1:32:00] his word is going to come to pass Isaiah
[1:32:04] 9:6 now can't even read that for me amen
[1:32:23] I mean remember that scripture that's
[1:32:25] pretty familiar right we always say that
[1:32:27] Christmas time well let's read the next
[1:32:28] one let's read it seven of the increase
[1:32:31] of his government and peace shall there
[1:32:32] be no end upon the throne of David
[1:32:34] what's that speaking of the Millennium
[1:32:36] and upon his kingdom to order and to
[1:32:40] establish it with judgment and with
[1:32:41] justice from henceforth even forever
[1:32:44] what is going to perform the Millennium
[1:32:46] how is Jesus gonna be to the throne of
[1:32:48] David the Bible said the zeal of the
[1:32:51] Lord of hosts will perform this glory
[1:32:55] God has a burning boy
[1:33:00] desire to pursue his prophecies God's
[1:33:05] Word is gonna come to pass so in order
[1:33:10] we shouldn't stand against it we should
[1:33:13] rally behind it hey Laurie
[1:33:16] we should be excited for the rapture we
[1:33:18] should be excited for the millennium we
[1:33:20] should be excited for the marriage
[1:33:21] supper
[1:33:22] we should get behind that we should say
[1:33:24] even so come Lord Jesus amen that's
[1:33:28] right the zeal of God is going to do
[1:33:30] this
[1:33:31] God's burning pursuit of the righteous
[1:33:34] prophecies that he's given that will
[1:33:37] bring the millennium to pass and I'll
[1:33:38] bring the rapture to pass God's own zeal
[1:33:40] ha ha ha oh thank you Jesus thank you
[1:33:45] Lord now let's do a few more he's got
[1:33:46] about eight minutes we probably won't
[1:33:50] get to fervor well maybe I am you can do
[1:33:51] a few Furman it's there's a lot less
[1:33:54] scriptures on being fervent okay here's
[1:33:56] where we got a balance though 1st
[1:33:59] Corinthians 14 12 let's go to 1st
[1:34:01] Corinthians 14 12 hey Rebecca you want
[1:34:05] to read this one is that do that ok
[1:34:06] first Corinthians 14 12
[1:34:25] never you ready think all right so the
[1:34:40] Corinthian church was very zealous for
[1:34:42] gifts but Paul says you've got to kind
[1:34:45] of guide that zeal and make sure that
[1:34:47] you put more emphasis on edifying
[1:34:51] everybody so try to invest in the gifts
[1:34:54] that will edify the most people which
[1:34:56] are what prophecy let me know that
[1:34:58] prophecy when it's understood everybody
[1:35:01] understands it praise God and if we want
[1:35:05] to see more that we got to pray more we
[1:35:07] got to invest in the gifts of God you
[1:35:10] have to be just as interested in someone
[1:35:12] prophesying and service as you are in
[1:35:14] the preaching of the word we ought to be
[1:35:16] just as interested in God using us
[1:35:18] perhaps to prophesy as every other
[1:35:21] person the church as Loras is interested
[1:35:23] in the piano or Malachi or myself
[1:35:25] interested in preaching we must be all
[1:35:27] interested in the gifts of God so our
[1:35:31] zeal you must be we must it's good to
[1:35:33] have seal but the seal should be it with
[1:35:35] gifts concerning gifts it should be to
[1:35:37] identify as many people as possible so
[1:35:40] in other words we just we'd be happy if
[1:35:41] one person speaks in tongues but we'd be
[1:35:43] happier if a prophecy went forth and
[1:35:45] everybody understood the word of the
[1:35:47] Lord that's right now here's one we can
[1:35:51] all have to go to Colossians 4:12 and I
[1:35:53] trust everybody will have this one
[1:35:55] cautions for 12 and 13 so Lydia and
[1:35:58] Elijah maybe we can get ready for this
[1:35:59] for claw shins for 12 and 13 Lydia why
[1:36:05] don't you read 12 and lies you can read
[1:36:06] 13 please never you ready honey
[1:36:12] yep cautions for 12
[1:36:25] so Epis ephesus I'm sorry Epirus was
[1:36:28] fervently praying for the Saints in
[1:36:30] Calais fervently another good verse 13
[1:36:34] lad you when you're ready yeah thank you
[1:36:47] yeah good guy that's good guess I'm not
[1:36:49] sure what it is either
[1:36:50] now look Paul says I'm a witness Epirus
[1:36:53] is zealous for the Saints of the
[1:36:56] Colossians and how do you know he was
[1:36:59] zealous he prayed fervently for them he
[1:37:01] would just get on his knees and pray
[1:37:03] over and over and over he kept praying
[1:37:06] for the individual and church let's have
[1:37:10] a burden let's have a burden to pray for
[1:37:12] somebody praise God whether it's brother
[1:37:14] Simon going to Thailand next month or
[1:37:16] maybe it's brother Craig going to Japan
[1:37:18] we should have a burden first you can
[1:37:22] have a burden for our church you can
[1:37:23] have a burden for anybody but have a
[1:37:25] burden of fervent desire to pray for
[1:37:28] people this is a ministry everybody can
[1:37:30] have this is a zeal every Christian
[1:37:32] should have remember zeal can be
[1:37:36] misguided remember this this is in the
[1:37:38] scriptures go to Romans 10 to zeal can
[1:37:41] be misguided as we saw with the gifts it
[1:37:43] gave me if you just like the Pentecostal
[1:37:45] church their zeal is just for one gift
[1:37:47] that edifies one person so there are
[1:37:50] seals misguided Romans 10 - in this case
[1:37:53] the zeal the Jews is misguided because
[1:37:55] they reject Christ Romans 10 - I'll read
[1:38:01] this one for I bear them record that
[1:38:03] they have a zeal of God but not
[1:38:05] according to knowledge because they're
[1:38:06] ignorant of the righteousness of Christ
[1:38:08] if you read verse 3 so they have zeal
[1:38:11] just like a lot of religions do today a
[1:38:13] lot of churches have zeal today but it's
[1:38:16] misguided it's not according to the
[1:38:18] truth of God's Word now I got two
[1:38:23] minutes so we'll just finish with zeal
[1:38:24] we probably won't go to fervency let's
[1:38:26] go to Psalms 119 I'm gonna close here
[1:38:28] Psalms 119 so how many
[1:38:35] we can see God has zeal how many people
[1:38:37] can see Jesus had zeal how many people
[1:38:40] can see we should have zeal and prayer
[1:38:43] amen
[1:38:44] I recency we should have zeal for people
[1:38:47] being edified by the gifts of the Spirit
[1:38:49] more people being edified praise the
[1:38:51] Lord that's wonderful
[1:38:53] this is what we should see that Angie
[1:38:56] and God Zia will bring this all to pass
[1:38:58] God zeal songs 1:19 now there's numerous
[1:39:04] verses let's go to 139 no Psalms 119 139
[1:39:07] big chapter I think it's the biggest
[1:39:09] chapter in the Bible for not mistaken
[1:39:11] Psalms 119 139 all right lady can you
[1:39:16] read that for me why was David zealous
[1:39:26] because his enemies had forgotten the
[1:39:29] words of God think about people that
[1:39:32] seem to be your enemies when they don't
[1:39:34] know the Word of God do you get zealous
[1:39:36] and you want to show them God's Word
[1:39:38] does it make you when you see people not
[1:39:40] live the word does it make you want to
[1:39:42] live the word in front of them it ought
[1:39:44] to because you're a city on a hill that
[1:39:48] cannot be hidden amen David got zealous
[1:39:51] when he saw people sitting oh the zeal
[1:39:54] of God has consumed me these people
[1:39:56] aren't living for Christ but I'm gonna
[1:39:57] live for Christ amen that's what he's
[1:40:00] saying of course if he's a New Testament
[1:40:01] believer my enemies have forsaken the
[1:40:05] Word of God and that's what and that's
[1:40:07] why church you know with this believe
[1:40:08] the sign move that makes me jealous when
[1:40:11] I see how they've left the message and
[1:40:13] and they're a condemning brother branham
[1:40:16] that makes me zealous because they've
[1:40:17] forsaken the Word of God and that makes
[1:40:20] me stand with him all the more praise
[1:40:21] God that makes you want to live the
[1:40:24] message more than ever because I got
[1:40:27] zeal because this is the Word of God
[1:40:29] and I've sent three or four of those
[1:40:31] people through emails they've contacted
[1:40:33] me no different ones that follow that
[1:40:34] movement and I said go to our church we
[1:40:37] believe page go to the page at where I
[1:40:39] wrote everything we believe I said show
[1:40:41] me one thing that's against the Bible
[1:40:43] and they never could bring anything back
[1:40:45] because we are we have the one-five
[1:40:49] there's only one faith and you and I are
[1:40:51] earnestly contending for the faith that
[1:40:53] was once given to the father's
[1:40:55] hallelujah and our zeal ought to be
[1:40:58] stirred up when we see people not living
[1:41:00] the word so young young people young
[1:41:02] church when you see people not living
[1:41:04] the word it ought to make you zealous oh
[1:41:06] oh lord help them pray for them right
[1:41:10] that right it should when you see people
[1:41:12] not obeying the Word of God amongst your
[1:41:14] friends you should have a seal to pray
[1:41:15] for them that's what we should have as
[1:41:17] adults all my friends aren't serving god
[1:41:20] lord do something for them help them and
[1:41:24] help me to be the example huh me to be a
[1:41:25] light so they can see what it means to
[1:41:27] be a real Christian glory now go to
[1:41:31] verse 113 so a little earlier 1:13 verse
[1:41:45] I hate vain thoughts but they law do I
[1:41:47] love he was so zealous he had hatred for
[1:41:52] any sin so I hope you can see this
[1:41:56] you've probably probably heard about it
[1:41:58] before but the more zeal you have for
[1:42:01] God the more hatred you have for sin
[1:42:05] because their complete opposite
[1:42:07] spiritual forces zeal for God causes
[1:42:11] extreme hatred for sin that means you'll
[1:42:15] hate seeing people sin on videos right
[1:42:17] you'll hate that you'll hate when a
[1:42:20] person cusses and use the name of the
[1:42:22] Lord in vain at your workplace or at
[1:42:24] your job or out in public you'll hate
[1:42:26] that because it's vanity because it's
[1:42:29] sin it's wickedness because you have a
[1:42:31] zeal you have a burning passion for the
[1:42:34] pursuit of God's Word amen don't worry
[1:42:38] all right let's go to verse 53 in the
[1:42:41] same chapter so the kind we worked our
[1:42:42] way backwards in the chapter Psalms 119
[1:42:45] 53 he was so zealous look at this one's
[1:42:54] church horror now Halloween time we
[1:42:57] always see those horror picture shows or
[1:42:58] advertisements for the horror corn mazes
[1:43:01] right David felt horror had taken a hold
[1:43:06] upon me because of the wicked that
[1:43:08] forsake thy law thy statutes have been
[1:43:11] my songs in the house of my pilgrimage
[1:43:13] I remembered thy name o Lord in the
[1:43:15] night and have kept that law this I had
[1:43:18] because I have kept that precepts
[1:43:19] see when we are keeping the Word of God
[1:43:22] it makes us so has sad it tears us up to
[1:43:26] see people breaking the law of God when
[1:43:29] we have a zeal for God's Word and we're
[1:43:31] obeying God's Word let's say in our
[1:43:34] future this is the zeal of the hour
[1:43:43] Christians who can repent who can have a
[1:43:46] burning pursuit for the good things of
[1:43:49] God and God will honor if God honored
[1:43:54] Old Testament families with generations
[1:43:56] of blessings with offices forever
[1:43:59] what will he do in this hour he's the
[1:44:01] same yesterday today and forever praise
[1:44:03] the Lord
[1:44:04] he's the same yesterday today and
[1:44:07] forever
[1:44:12] boiling fervent zealous boiling these
[1:44:19] words are born to us lukewarm is just a
[1:44:24] toned down version of fervency of zeal
[1:44:27] just toned down
[1:44:28] lukewarm is kind of it's tepid right
[1:44:33] it's medium it's got a medium desire we
[1:44:36] need a burning desire Church I'd say
[1:44:38] right now I've got a zeal to write that
[1:44:40] book I've got a zeal to read that thing
[1:44:43] that's all I think about
[1:44:44] get that thing published try to get it
[1:44:46] in the hands of people I've got a zeal
[1:44:47] for that no one has to ask me to do that
[1:44:49] I'm motivated to do that because I think
[1:44:52] it can help people I know it can help
[1:44:54] people because the Word of God
[1:44:56] constantly helps people let's just bow
[1:44:58] our heads now take a moment church think
[1:45:01] about your life here America and when
[1:45:02] you're ready to come to the piano
[1:45:05] are you zealous are you boiling over in
[1:45:08] the pursuit of doing something good for
[1:45:11] God your heart is constantly boiling and
[1:45:15] constantly thinking new thoughts about
[1:45:18] the Word of God and how great God is and
[1:45:20] how loving God is that's what fervency
[1:45:23] is that's what zeal is when you see
[1:45:28] people cuss when you see people commit
[1:45:31] adultery I know many of our family
[1:45:32] members are involved in that I have so
[1:45:34] many aunts and uncles involved in that
[1:45:35] when we see that that should make a
[1:45:37] zealous to do what's right even more
[1:45:41] that should cause us horror to see the
[1:45:45] abomination is done in our families in
[1:45:47] this city David said Horrors come about
[1:45:51] me because of the wicked that forsake
[1:45:53] the law of God
[1:45:57] this is what real zeal produces and
[1:45:59] Jesus said counsel to me to have these
[1:46:02] things be zealous and repent now you
[1:46:13] don't fetch your hands would think about
[1:46:14] it and say Lord in my heart Lord I need
[1:46:16] more zeal for some reason I'm not as
[1:46:19] zealous as I need to be I want to be
[1:46:22] zealous for gifts to edify everybody I
[1:46:25] want to be zealous with a prayer life
[1:46:27] I'm gonna have me zealous with a burden
[1:46:29] to pray for somebody maybe a missionary
[1:46:33] maybe my husband maybe my wife maybe my
[1:46:37] mother maybe a father
[1:46:38] maybe an ER uncle Heavenly Father we
[1:46:47] love you Lord tonight Lord your word is
[1:46:50] forever sound having your word is true
[1:46:52] dear Lord Lord you've asked for Zeeland
[1:46:56] thus our repent and me zealous but we
[1:47:01] didn't get the other fervent scriptures
[1:47:02] but the Bible tells us all Christians
[1:47:05] are called to be fervent in spirit
[1:47:07] that's their thinking serving the Lord
[1:47:11] the fervent prayer of the righteous man
[1:47:14] or woman prevails much above all things
[1:47:21] we should love each other with fervent
[1:47:23] love with fervent charity
[1:47:26] Lord in this hour we have no excuse to
[1:47:29] be lukewarm you've given us the revealed
[1:47:31] word you've broken off the seals now the
[1:47:33] whole Bible makes sense now the whole
[1:47:35] Bible flows there's continuity through
[1:47:40] the whole scripture the unchanging God
[1:47:43] from Genesis to Revelation
[1:47:44] Oh God stir our hearts tonight dear God
[1:47:49] we pray for fervency we pray for zeal
[1:47:53] Lord God that we would hate sin we'd
[1:47:56] hate any vain thought anything that's a
[1:47:58] useless waste of our time
[1:48:00] help us to hate those things dear God
[1:48:02] with the holy hatred because we know
[1:48:08] your zeal will bring the rapture to pass
[1:48:12] it'll bring in the Millennium we know
[1:48:18] your zeal will accomplish all these
[1:48:20] things Lord perform your word performing
[1:48:23] in me performing in your people Lord God
[1:48:28] help us to be enthusiastic about the
[1:48:31] word of the Lord grant it jesus not
[1:48:36] lackadaisical not relaxed not lukewarm
[1:48:40] not semi hot but help us to have a
