[5:03] how many adults i only know two people
[5:05] that have read the whole book which is
[5:06] okay you don't have to read it
[5:08] i only know two people that have read it
[5:09] um
[5:11] uh but if you didn't get a chance if you
[5:12] don't get if you don't feel led to read
[5:14] it i want to preach it to you by god's
[5:15] grace so praise god especially the young
[5:17] ones especially the young ones because
[5:18] us adults we've been around a little
[5:19] while we know the message we know a lot
[5:21] of the uh doctors will be good refresher
[5:23] for us of course
[5:24] yeah as you know you can pull anything
[5:26] you have need of out of god's gift
[5:28] you don't have to be my gift church it
[5:29] can be anybody here you're right you've
[5:31] seen that last few months you can pull
[5:32] any gift any need you have you can pull
[5:34] it out of any gift of god yeah praise
[5:36] the lord when the saints pray when the
[5:38] saints believe praise god very badly to
[5:40] be encouraged praise god let's go to
[5:42] chapter two let's go elections chapter
[5:44] two hallelujah
[5:46] brother said his wife is feeling much
[5:47] better after that coleman says thank the
[5:49] lord for that praise god my god
[5:55] [Applause]
[6:02] yes sir yes sir
[6:04] he and i will text every now and then
[6:05] that's good praise god did you see my
[6:07] work brother i i just no i he
[6:10] does he talks to me just before perfect
[6:12] perfect praise god amen
[6:15] his son malcolm has been a real good
[6:16] friend over the years
[6:25] colossians two verse one i like to look
[6:26] at the mystery of the godhead here
[6:29] i'm sure there'll be a lot of familiar
[6:30] things you know
[6:33] so that's the um spirit here to direct
[6:34] this by his grace i'm just going to
[6:36] review i'll probably this will be a
[6:37] longer review now sometimes i say
[6:38] there's a short review this could be a
[6:39] little bit longer review like maybe 10
[6:40] minutes okay so
[6:42] uh just bear with me all right back
[6:44] around a little bit so we have an
[6:45] understanding on this here
[6:47] colossians two verse one you know some
[6:49] people
[6:50] uh some people wonder how could a
[6:51] trinitarian be saved you know they look
[6:53] at that they look at us and they say how
[6:54] can we be saved yeah
[6:56] right
[6:57] yes but they're under church dogmas
[7:00] right that were written by men we're
[7:01] under the bible that's written by the
[7:03] holy spirit
[7:04] through holy one of allah got removed of
[7:06] the holy ghost right glory
[7:08] so
[7:10] but we believe that now the reason we
[7:11] believe that is because it's a mystery
[7:13] brother ma'am
[7:14] my wife found a quote that where brother
[7:16] rabbi said even catholics can be uh born
[7:18] again now that's before the seals
[7:21] my brother ram said catholics could be
[7:22] born i remember that my wife shared with
[7:24] me from 1961 a few weeks ago so
[7:27] brother graham was always gracious now
[7:29] he condemned the system
[7:31] he said i've got to strike the serpent
[7:32] that's biting the people
[7:34] right right but if there's a sincere
[7:36] heart in there that really loves god is
[7:37] trusting in jesus christ and they repent
[7:40] of their sins then they're saved praise
[7:41] the lord yeah right so somehow god works
[7:44] it out god's got lorraine said god's got
[7:45] children in every organization right
[7:48] they said that the seventh seal so
[7:49] that's right you know we're just
[7:50] trusting in god's grace and we know at
[7:51] church we know the type there's abraham
[7:53] there's a lot type right there's a david
[7:55] there's a saul right there's a maikai
[7:57] there's a jehoshaphat
[7:59] all the way down there's a wise and
[8:01] foolish all the way down he's gone we
[8:02] know there's types and so uh the types
[8:05] are always looking to point into
[8:06] something right the shadow points to a
[8:07] reality and the reality is there's wise
[8:10] and foolish virgin springs colossians
[8:12] two verse one
[8:14] i'll read verse one and then we'll all
[8:15] read verse two verse one for i would
[8:17] that ye knew what great conflict i have
[8:19] for you and for them at laodicea and for
[8:21] as many as have not seen my face in the
[8:23] flesh let's reverse two together one two
[8:26] three maybe our hearts might be
[8:28] comforted being knit together in love
[8:31] and unto all riches of the full
[8:34] assurance of understanding to the
[8:36] acknowledgement of the mystery of god
[8:39] and of the father and of christ now look
[8:42] at verse three let's read that too we
[8:44] might as well read that one two three
[8:45] and whom are
[8:47] all the treasures of wisdom
[8:50] how many believe that
[8:51] all the treasure all the wisdom
[8:53] everything is in the godhead and what is
[8:54] the god of the holy spirit praise yes it
[8:56] is the fullness of the god of course
[8:58] that holy spirit dwells in his son that
[9:00] glorified body of the lord jesus christ
[9:03] may god has blessed you remember his
[9:04] word you may be saying
[9:06] i just want to briefly review here for a
[9:08] few moments and
[9:09] uh since it's been nine months since i
[9:11] preached on this series and i thought it
[9:13] might benefit you all if i just reviewed
[9:15] for a few moments
[9:17] by the grace of the lord praise god
[9:20] this is a you know a
[9:22] a very familiar subject and uh as i said
[9:25] i was i went back and listened to some
[9:26] of the sermons uh that i was preaching
[9:28] on this just just to kind of get an idea
[9:30] um
[9:32] and i remember that the truth that as
[9:34] more time goes on the trinitarians are
[9:37] coming more hostile against anyone who's
[9:38] outside of the trinitarian right okay
[9:41] and that's because the squeeze is coming
[9:43] on yes right there has to be some type
[9:46] of squeeze the bible speaks of it in
[9:47] revelation 13.
[9:50] the world and the church world i'm
[9:52] talking about the unsaved church world
[9:54] the church world that takes the mark of
[9:55] the beast they have to get to a spot
[9:56] where they will support legislation to
[9:59] kill anyone who descends right
[10:01] and they're getting really close i mean
[10:02] this is the closest we've ever seen yeah
[10:04] uh where people uh you know pro-abortion
[10:06] people are going into churches and i've
[10:08] seen videos they're standing right up
[10:09] there in the priest's face and
[10:11] cussing out the priests right there i
[10:13] mean just never seen this kind of
[10:14] boldness before uh throwing those
[10:16] mocktail uh uh what are they called
[10:20] molotovs i'm sorry yeah i said it wrong
[10:23] i could never say that word anyways
[10:25] there are explosions and they put them
[10:26] in uh
[10:27] uh conservative buildings or churches
[10:29] they're
[10:30] burning up churches like we've just
[10:31] never seen it to this level before and
[10:34] so what it's going to do it's going to
[10:34] keep advancing more and more we got to
[10:36] expect that
[10:37] just like jesus said we've got to expect
[10:38] wars rumors of wars earthquakes
[10:40] pestilences
[10:42] right we have to expect all these things
[10:43] and these are all just birth pains right
[10:46] right coming down towards the end so
[10:48] we're going to see it advance more and
[10:49] more but i've just noticed in the you
[10:50] know the 20 years i've been serving the
[10:52] lord uh that the rhetoric gets more and
[10:54] more
[10:56] aggressive against anyone who's not a
[10:58] trinitarian for example the gentleman
[11:00] that left the message and started the
[11:02] website and when he talks about me
[11:04] believing in the goddess he calls me a
[11:06] heretic he just calls me he said pastor
[11:08] jesse is a heretic because he don't
[11:09] believe in the trinity
[11:11] exactly the opposite is true they're the
[11:13] heretics for adding to the bible amen so
[11:16] that's what you find whatever satan's
[11:17] accusing you of that's what he's guilty
[11:19] of yeah
[11:20] and even if you were guilty of it you
[11:21] confess it it's under the blood you're
[11:23] no longer guilty
[11:25] that's the power of our sacrifice
[11:29] if god won't remember it then we
[11:30] shouldn't remember it either right now
[11:32] unless it's just to keep us humble
[11:34] but not to take the guilt and shame of
[11:35] it again amen right we already had the
[11:37] guilt and shame when we said forgive me
[11:39] jesus we already took the where the
[11:40] guilt and shame there and then the bible
[11:42] says then you take vengeance against
[11:44] that that mistake that you made and next
[11:45] time you overcome by the grace of god
[11:48] remember i showed this stat there's
[11:49] about eight billion people on the earth
[11:51] right now
[11:52] um
[11:53] and seven billion of them are in uh
[11:56] at least seven million if not more
[11:58] probably more are in total worship of
[12:01] either multiple gods or or a false god
[12:04] right almost two billion are muslims and
[12:07] they worship one person but it's the
[12:09] it's the wrong person right it's not
[12:11] jehovah it's not yahweh no it's not the
[12:13] lord jesus christ no so two billion
[12:16] worship one person but it's the wrong
[12:17] person right some demonic power right
[12:21] uh 2.3 billion are trinitarians so
[12:24] they're idolaters
[12:26] right there's 4.3 billion
[12:28] that's over half
[12:30] 1.1 billion are hindus and they worship
[12:33] millions of gods now they have three
[12:34] main ones i showed that to you about
[12:35] nine months ago
[12:37] uh but they have so that right there's
[12:39] uh five point uh 5.4 there
[12:42] and then 1.9 are atheists or gnostics
[12:46] and they still have a god it's the god
[12:47] of this world satan
[12:49] because they love themselves which is
[12:51] pleasures which is actually uh it's
[12:53] self-exaltation it's actually worship of
[12:55] satan
[12:56] right because the bible says they they
[12:58] live according to the prince and power
[13:00] of this sin amen because it's the spirit
[13:02] of disobedience that they're living
[13:03] under so they are worshiping something
[13:05] they're worshiping satan
[13:07] sure so there's a very small group
[13:09] within there that actually believes god
[13:10] is one person and his name is jesus
[13:13] christ aren't you glad to be in that
[13:14] number amen
[13:16] it's a very small number
[13:19] [Applause]
[13:20] amen that's exactly right
[13:23] that's why this is a great mystery
[13:24] remember it started because of matthew
[13:26] 13 33 says a woman took ahead of three
[13:30] measures of meal and 11 and three
[13:31] measures a meal
[13:33] and it grew up until the whole thing was
[13:35] 11. the whole thing was 11 represents
[13:37] sin the whole thing became sinful what
[13:39] woman made her meal or i'm sorry what
[13:42] woman mixed leaven which is sin with
[13:44] meal which is christ the word what woman
[13:47] did that till the whole thing becomes
[13:48] sinful that's the roman catholic church
[13:51] yeah hallelujah oh yeah because jesus
[13:53] christ is the meadow he's the bread
[13:55] hallelujah he's the bread of life amen
[13:57] and in him is no love and praise god
[14:07] so that parable shows that those three
[14:09] measures uh were placed in there early
[14:11] in the church age so it grows up now and
[14:14] now we have a church a catholic church
[14:15] which brother ray and stephanie can tell
[14:17] you some stories about catholic schools
[14:19] and catholic churches because i heard
[14:20] them on sunday night
[14:21] they could really tell you some awful
[14:23] stories about these people but the whole
[14:25] thing is 11 praise god yes to their own
[14:28] shame
[14:30] and but it was prophesied jesus said
[14:32] it's a mystery within the kingdom of
[14:34] heaven as he as he said as he taught us
[14:36] in matthew chapter 13.
[14:39] so the confusion is how many persons is
[14:41] god the revelation is that he's one god
[14:43] who manifests himself in three ways
[14:45] father son and holy ghost
[14:47] praise god
[14:48] now of course god can manifest himself
[14:50] in as many ways as he wants
[14:52] praise god but pertaining to mankind and
[14:54] redeeming man he manifests himself in
[14:57] three ways
[14:58] father son and holy ghost member of
[15:00] church the word triass which is the
[15:02] greek word of trinity trinity was not
[15:04] even invented until 180 a.d
[15:07] amen that's right
[15:08] my goodness uh that's how many years
[15:11] after jesus that's 150 years after jesus
[15:13] left the scene
[15:14] so jesus never spoke about trinity no
[15:17] neither did paul any of these guys they
[15:18] come up with it 158 years later and now
[15:21] we're the heretics they're the heretics
[15:23] yeah
[15:24] hallelujah and then right around that
[15:26] time torturing which he was a godly man
[15:28] from what i understand uh when i was
[15:29] studying church history i was studying
[15:31] certainly with the same books brother
[15:32] branham studied how did it happen by
[15:34] rachel has a time that's a good one and
[15:37] uh that's it yeah it is
[15:39] excellent i love that one yeah
[15:42] uh and also admin uh
[15:45] uh broadband there it is edmond
[15:46] broadband beautiful history books there
[15:48] my just some tremendous history books
[15:51] but both men said through it was a godly
[15:52] man but he introduced the latin form of
[15:54] the word true which is trinitas
[15:58] right about the same time
[15:59] so we see this this false doctrine hatch
[16:01] and even come out come out of good
[16:03] people
[16:04] church if we're not careful bad things
[16:05] can come out of good people
[16:08] right
[16:09] bad things that come out of good people
[16:12] you know we see it just look at martin
[16:13] luther good person church age messenger
[16:15] one of the stars in the hand of jesus
[16:17] christ
[16:18] but what comes out of him anti-semitism
[16:20] yeah right
[16:23] his words and speeches led to people
[16:24] burning down catholic i'm sorry jewish
[16:26] synagogues
[16:28] and people hurting jews yeah see one man
[16:32] church we're not careful like we said
[16:34] we're not careful pride will get in
[16:35] there right
[16:36] show it on sunday if we're not careful
[16:38] as we get older if we don't keep
[16:40] ourselves humble pride is going to
[16:41] overcome that's the truth
[16:43] and we'll be slaves to pride exalting
[16:45] ourselves rather than exalting jesus
[16:47] christ
[16:49] now notice remember the church remember
[16:50] church the early fathers never used the
[16:52] three persons you'll never find in
[16:54] scripture
[16:55] and this verse here colossians 2 2 is so
[16:57] beautiful it never mentions the holy
[16:59] ghost
[17:00] no so what does that mean
[17:04] it just mentions father
[17:06] god and christ where's the holy ghost in
[17:08] here yeah was god four persons now
[17:11] see how there there's no trinitarian
[17:13] consistency because the writers never
[17:16] were trinitarians amen amen they can
[17:18] find two bots through two verses in the
[17:20] whole bible that talk about well sorry
[17:22] three three that talk about father and
[17:24] holy ghost the rest are not like that
[17:27] and they take those three verses and
[17:28] then they write this man-made now church
[17:30] the proof is in the pudding
[17:32] there at church if a trinitarian can be
[17:34] saved
[17:35] that means the fact is if the if the
[17:37] people don't recognize that false
[17:39] doctrine it'll lead to many other false
[17:40] doctrines
[17:42] and look what it see when you allow one
[17:43] false doctrine it's a lot easier to take
[17:45] another yeah
[17:47] right
[17:48] right you break one rule next time it's
[17:50] a lot easier to break the next rule i've
[17:51] seen my kids do it in my classroom
[17:53] they're not my children but the kids in
[17:54] my life if they get away with one thing
[17:56] you better watch them the next time
[17:57] they're gonna try to do it again
[18:00] right
[18:00] happens all the time
[18:02] don't get away with it like like
[18:05] here's what i see all the time you know
[18:07] the the kids will the kids will be like
[18:08] fighting once another and like they'll
[18:10] look over and make faces and then look
[18:12] back at me and they think i didn't see
[18:13] them
[18:15] sometimes they don't catch them right
[18:17] and they're like oh someone's giving me
[18:18] bad faces
[18:20] and i'm like okay i'll watch and you
[18:22] know wait about 20-30 minutes pretty
[18:23] soon i look up and they're making
[18:27] i'll be like hey so-and-so i just got
[18:29] you that's recess minutes
[18:32] they think i'm not watching them but see
[18:34] if they get away with it one time they
[18:35] think they can get away with the second
[18:37] time
[18:38] that's how it is like when you when a
[18:39] lot of people are are serious with god
[18:41] they think oh if i do one sin that
[18:43] lightning is going to come down and
[18:44] strike me right
[18:45] right and then when it does it they're
[18:46] like oh maybe i i mean it's okay to get
[18:49] drunk maybe it is okay to do this
[18:51] maybe
[18:52] and so it gets easier each time but
[18:54] church inside i'll stay like this the
[18:56] lightning was striking on the inside
[18:58] amen that's where god was trying he was
[19:00] trying to strike their convictions amen
[19:02] hallelujah
[19:04] he was trying to strike their conscience
[19:06] how did they get to that i don't know
[19:07] that must have been the lord but
[19:09] the fact is he says it's a mystery of
[19:12] god father and christ
[19:15] and all the treasures are hitting them
[19:16] well what about the holy spirit all the
[19:18] wisdom of god is not in the holy spirit
[19:19] well of course it is
[19:21] but see paul just lists these different
[19:23] titles right he listens now of course
[19:25] christ it means the anointing one right
[19:28] god an object of worship and father of
[19:29] course is the heavenly creator right of
[19:31] all things
[19:32] he doesn't list the holy spirit which to
[19:34] us it doesn't bother us but that may
[19:36] bother a trinitarian why don't they use
[19:38] this one then why don't they use this
[19:39] one if it's such a if trinity's all over
[19:41] the bible why don't they use this one
[19:42] because it doesn't fit their agenda it
[19:44] doesn't fit their false doctrine
[19:47] praise god but look paul called it a
[19:49] mystery how many know it's mysterious
[19:51] it's very mysterious there's things to
[19:53] this day so i don't understand but we
[19:55] can clearly point down and pinpoint that
[19:58] god is not three separate co-equal
[20:00] persons no
[20:02] that's total paganism right now in part
[20:05] two when i preach it we looked at the
[20:07] eight problems with the trinity doctrine
[20:09] i'm just going to read them out of here
[20:10] okay so i don't know if you ever read
[20:12] them out here so i'm going to remind her
[20:14] he says okay i don't expect youtube
[20:16] for the first problem is the trinity
[20:19] adds to the bible and that's the worst
[20:20] problem because if you add to the word
[20:22] right eggs will be added to you in hell
[20:24] right either in hell or on the earth as
[20:26] well as in hell
[20:28] right that's the word that's the most
[20:29] decimating
[20:30] uh charge against trinitarians they add
[20:33] to the bible that's why i told austin
[20:34] every every time always end the debate
[20:36] about trinity with that you're the one
[20:37] adding to the bible i'm the one that
[20:38] believes everything in the bible amen
[20:41] hallelujah
[20:42] right
[20:43] second
[20:44] jesus and his apostles taught and
[20:46] affirmed pure hebrew monotheism rather
[20:48] than trinitarianism right yeah no hebrew
[20:51] author
[20:52] jesus himself never talked about three
[20:54] persons
[20:55] jesus quoted the shema that the hebrew
[20:57] prayer hero israel the lord our god is
[21:00] one lord and his name is
[21:02] one not three his name is not three his
[21:04] name is lord amen
[21:07] as the bible says
[21:09] and then i listened the athanasian creed
[21:11] which was a sixth century trinitarian
[21:13] confessional contains at least six
[21:16] contradictions and i put it right there
[21:17] with bullet points in there
[21:19] six times the creed contradicts the
[21:21] bible
[21:22] and they can't see that
[21:23] right and then i put up this shoe
[21:25] remember the shield of the trinity i
[21:26] showed you
[21:28] there's so many lies in here but the
[21:30] worst lie is that the father is not the
[21:31] holy spirit that's the worst lie
[21:33] right
[21:34] because then jesus has two fathers right
[21:37] all right such a lie
[21:39] how can there be two whole different
[21:41] holy spirits because the god the father
[21:43] is the holy spirit
[21:44] how can there be two different separate
[21:46] holy spirits it makes no sense
[21:48] unless you're unless you're uh
[21:50] deceived and you picture god the father
[21:53] as a white bearded light-haired man and
[21:55] up in heaven and the holy ghost has a
[21:56] dove that just kind of roofs on his
[21:58] shoulder or something like that then it
[21:59] might make sense but it makes no sense
[22:02] if you believe the bible and know that
[22:03] god is the invisible spirit the
[22:06] all-creator of the one who inhabits
[22:08] eternity praise god
[22:10] hallelujah it makes no sense
[22:13] unless you take a a trinitarian picture
[22:15] or something like that artwork yeah
[22:19] also there's major bible contradictions
[22:21] and inconsistencies among trinitarians
[22:23] fifth the early trinitarians you know
[22:25] this they did not even say the trinity
[22:27] i'm sorry the the the holy spirit was a
[22:30] divine person until 381 a.d
[22:34] that's 350 years after jesus left the
[22:37] scene they finally said the holy spirit
[22:38] is a person right
[22:40] right they didn't even think the holy
[22:41] spirit was a divine person well why what
[22:44] was what was living in them anyway what
[22:46] what it wasn't jesus body that was
[22:48] living in them
[22:49] what do they think was living in them
[22:52] it shows that jesus wasn't living in
[22:54] them because they create they add on to
[22:55] the bible praise god true
[22:58] six their images and artwork are
[23:00] deceptive they're false representations
[23:02] of the godhead sure
[23:04] and seventh they use fear tactics in
[23:06] order to keep people in their church
[23:08] they got to use fear now we don't use
[23:09] fear here except fear of god but that's
[23:11] what every church you use
[23:12] we use fear of god in other words you
[23:14] got to go somewhere you have to go here
[23:15] but you got to go somewhere that's fear
[23:17] of god because if you if you forsake
[23:19] god's house god will forsake you
[23:21] that's exactly right
[23:23] the bible says they went out from us
[23:24] because they weren't out of us yes is
[23:26] that right praise god i may lead you
[23:28] somewhere else but you make sure you go
[23:30] to the church amen that's true but their
[23:32] fear tactics are if you don't believe in
[23:35] the trinity you're going to hell and if
[23:36] you're you're a heretic if you don't
[23:38] believe in the trinity right
[23:40] what a lie yeah they got to use fear to
[23:42] keep you in the church we don't use fear
[23:45] we use faith praise god
[23:46] that's what we really use
[23:48] faith revelation amen faith in the word
[23:51] of god is what we use how do we bring
[23:52] the word of god
[23:54] how many have assured us in your heart
[23:55] that god's word is true praise god
[23:58] that's why you keep coming back because
[23:59] you keep hearing truth you see that
[24:01] truth have an impact on your life amen
[24:03] you love the truth because the truth is
[24:05] inside of you the truth died for you the
[24:07] truth is a person the truth sets you
[24:09] free glory amen hallelujah
[24:15] hallelujah and lastly god sent a prophet
[24:18] named william mary branham to tell
[24:20] christians that the trinity was of the
[24:22] devil thus saith the lord amen
[24:25] hallelujah
[24:27] it's exactly right
[24:29] eight reasons of trinity dog was false
[24:33] i put this out in july of 2021 i'm still
[24:36] waiting for somebody to come
[24:37] show me where i'm wrong i'm still
[24:38] waiting it's almost been a year
[24:41] still waiting for somebody now the two
[24:43] people that heard it i'm sorry two
[24:44] people read it one of them got baptized
[24:46] in the name of the lord jesus christ
[24:47] by craig out connecticut brother oh
[24:49] great he yeah he's like he she sent me
[24:52] an email he said brother jesse i think
[24:53] you're gonna be really encouraged
[24:54] somebody read your book and got baptized
[24:56] right
[24:57] i put it at about the end of every
[24:58] chapter that's at the end of every
[25:00] chapter there's like what you should do
[25:02] at the end of the chapter
[25:05] so let me see if i can find it real
[25:06] quick
[25:08] so let's see after the godhead chapter
[25:09] what three i put three things you should
[25:11] do
[25:12] if you're a former trinitarian repent of
[25:14] purposely ignoring or adding to god's
[25:16] known character rejoicing the truth as
[25:18] one divine person second
[25:20] uh be ready to share god's revelation
[25:22] although it's not required for salvation
[25:24] by citing scripture alone
[25:26] third uh
[25:27] be aware
[25:28] to avoid lots of trinitarian songs and
[25:30] references and in weddings and baptists
[25:32] baptismal ceremonies
[25:34] and be careful when associated with
[25:36] trinitarians for the fact that one false
[25:37] doctrine often leads to another and i
[25:39] didn't put that in there about being
[25:40] baptized okay i know i put another other
[25:42] chapters there
[25:43] all right it's a little surprising
[25:44] though amen all right all right praise
[25:46] god
[25:48] oh yeah well the other there's there's
[25:49] one in chapter uh
[25:51] chapter two praise god
[25:53] chapter three yeah there you go
[25:55] hallelujah
[25:57] see just urging people
[25:59] don't just let the word go in one ear
[26:01] not the other but act upon the word
[26:03] right that's the way you'll be blessed
[26:05] if you leave this place and act upon the
[26:06] word of god amen sure that's the only
[26:09] way to be blessed praise god is to obey
[26:11] the word of god
[26:13] then i show the six clear contradictions
[26:15] from the athanasian creed
[26:17] and the shield of the trinity
[26:18] contradiction with the father and the
[26:19] holy ghost okay part three i focus on
[26:22] showing how god
[26:23] the bible used the word manifest when it
[26:25] talks about god
[26:27] it's not pert three persons it's always
[26:29] manifest god manifests himself in flesh
[26:32] that's the key word it's a manifestation
[26:34] right
[26:35] then i showed how we're not modalists
[26:38] although
[26:39] modalism is close to what we believe but
[26:41] we're not right a list because they have
[26:43] some beliefs that are outside the bible
[26:45] right see god don't want any label on
[26:46] you other than you're a holy
[26:47] ghost-filled saint
[26:49] hallelujah amen
[26:51] right now we call ourselves message
[26:53] believers but in reality it's the
[26:54] message of the baptism of the holy ghost
[26:56] and hebrews 13 8 that jesus christ is
[26:59] the same yesterday today and forever
[27:00] amen
[27:02] i don't want no denominational labels on
[27:04] us no
[27:05] and we're not oneness either because i
[27:07] showed
[27:08] the different uh things that are wrong
[27:09] with the oneness doctor right and all
[27:11] kind of for them it all kind of goes
[27:12] back to speaking in tongues you know
[27:14] the godhead's kind of important it's not
[27:16] as important as that speaking in tongues
[27:17] right
[27:18] which where's that got them where's it
[27:20] just got them into denomination right
[27:22] and now worldliness like jose's family
[27:24] knows i went to that church with brother
[27:25] william we went back to that uh oneness
[27:27] church they used to be holy a few years
[27:29] ago i went back and now they're just
[27:31] worldly high heels and all kinds of
[27:33] makeup earrings men that don't live a
[27:36] real godly life you know
[27:37] it's just sad
[27:40] now part three though i showed this
[27:42] and this was fresh to me i think it came
[27:44] to me while i was studying
[27:46] we looked at how the last remaining
[27:49] mystery really that i can see of the
[27:51] godhead is the use of plural pronouns
[27:54] like let us
[27:57] and jesus said uh
[28:00] exalt me with the glory that we had
[28:02] before the foundation of the world right
[28:03] we so us and we
[28:05] and just the simple truth came to me
[28:08] that
[28:08] any manifestation of god god's invisible
[28:11] right so any manifestation of god is a
[28:13] thing
[28:15] but it's a thing separate from him
[28:17] because he's invisible now he lives
[28:19] inside that thing but it's still a thing
[28:22] so in other words the pillar of fire
[28:23] god's in that bill of fire but that fire
[28:25] is just a thing it's a it's a it's a
[28:27] covering for him it's a mask praise god
[28:32] so the reason he said let us make is
[28:34] because the invisible and the visible
[28:37] work together praise god
[28:39] and the visible is a person place or
[28:42] thing
[28:43] the visible manifestation is a noun
[28:46] and so whenever you have two nouns
[28:48] together you got to use a plural pronoun
[28:51] praise god amen so what let us is father
[28:54] speaking through the light of the son
[28:56] hallelujah sure jesus's body let us or
[28:59] glorify me with the glory we had before
[29:01] the foundation of the world we this
[29:03] manifestation right
[29:05] that was the logos
[29:06] but the logos just changed the mass and
[29:08] put the fire away and it took on a body
[29:11] called jesus christ amen all right
[29:13] hallelujah and then that invisible
[29:15] spirit came inside of jesus physical
[29:17] body praise god
[29:19] hallelujah
[29:21] that's a great mystery there but that's
[29:23] the last remaining
[29:25] and mystery in part four church i
[29:27] labored on genesis 1 26
[29:29] matthew 28 19.
[29:31] there's one name to the father and holy
[29:33] ghost not three names and i showed you
[29:35] 14 documents remember that when i showed
[29:36] you 14 documents from history that we
[29:38] found from libraries
[29:41] it was real romantic when i was first
[29:43] married we would spend some of our dates
[29:44] at the library looking in church uh
[29:47] encyclopedias i'm sure my wife really
[29:48] appreciates those romantic times that we
[29:50] stuck there
[29:52] oh you're so romantic taking me to the
[29:53] library
[29:54] oh thank you
[29:57] you're right
[30:01] well you know we had help brother simon
[30:02] and brother scott obermeyer you know
[30:04] they uh
[30:05] they would go to different libraries as
[30:07] well you know and we found 14 documents
[30:09] that all say the same thing the early
[30:11] apostles used the name of jesus christ
[30:15] that was called the apostolic form
[30:17] after that around 100 a.d was the
[30:19] earliest they found when from the
[30:20] dedache i could never say that document
[30:22] it's called dedache did not
[30:24] they that what is it
[30:26] yeah i can never pronounce that it looks
[30:28] like didachi
[30:30] i'm not a scholar no not even close
[30:34] but
[30:35] about a hundred eighty they found the
[30:36] duck
[30:38] and it says they baptized in the titles
[30:40] polished in holy ghost
[30:42] so the earliest record we have of false
[30:44] baptisms is about 180 so seven years
[30:47] after jesus left
[30:49] okay
[30:50] so that's that but everything else point
[30:53] er everything points to
[30:54] the apostles always use the literal name
[30:57] and then i ended by showing how
[30:59] titles are not names that showed how
[31:02] having many titles doesn't produce a
[31:03] name
[31:04] no because in revelation 12 satan's
[31:06] called old dragon old serpent the devil
[31:09] satan he's got four titles is he four
[31:12] persons certainly not no he's one awful
[31:14] person
[31:15] he's one awful person
[31:17] okay and so then god can have righteous
[31:19] branch he can be alpha omega beginning
[31:21] now healthy father first and the last he
[31:23] can be all that but he's one person very
[31:25] amen okay now there's the review is that
[31:26] okay every take a deep breath that
[31:28] wasn't too bad that was too bad i didn't
[31:29] keep you all all night on the review so
[31:31] praise god i usually don't read too long
[31:33] anyway
[31:34] let's go to the next part five here
[31:39] so part five now i want to start on part
[31:41] five with
[31:42] uh
[31:45] uh first i believe it's what i'm saying
[31:47] let me see i keep gotta keep turning
[31:49] here sorry
[31:51] yeah the power in jesus name so uh bible
[31:53] readers so get your bibles here to young
[31:55] people here and any adults if you want
[31:56] to read get your bible ready we'd
[31:57] appreciate it
[31:59] remember program had men and women read
[32:01] the scriptures in the services there so
[32:04] sisters can read us uh scriptures while
[32:06] the sermon is is going on i got i got
[32:09] the tapes praise god i'm just saying
[32:10] with the tapestry
[32:12] right brother joseph
[32:13] right brother billy paul all these
[32:14] brothers i'm just saying what the tapes
[32:16] say
[32:17] i do that in love because i reached out
[32:19] to them and uh i know i got balled out
[32:21] sometimes but it's all in love
[32:23] if you love somebody try to correct it
[32:27] now power in the name of jesus so
[32:28] there's many titles but one name
[32:31] right now i just put here
[32:33] the literal name of jesus christ is
[32:35] power
[32:37] amen it represents power and authority
[32:40] so i gave my testimony at the beginning
[32:41] of this section in chapter one when i
[32:43] first became a a christian before my
[32:45] preaching ministry
[32:47] i felt forgiven when i was baptized in
[32:49] the name of lord jesus i just felt like
[32:50] the i just felt like it was it was
[32:52] settled praise the lord because i've
[32:54] been falsely baptized twice before that
[32:57] the first time i didn't really want to
[32:58] do it i was just trying to get somebody
[32:59] off my back second time i wanted the
[33:01] lord jesus christ but the oneness people
[33:02] said jesus only all right and i was
[33:05] guilt guilt guilt guilt guilt shame
[33:07] shame shame you know foolishness you
[33:09] should have did it well i finally went
[33:11] and got it done and after that i just
[33:12] knew all the all the deaths were cleared
[33:14] the case was settled amen
[33:16] i've been buried in this name and i knew
[33:18] i was forgiven amen amen hallelujah
[33:24] also
[33:25] as soon as i started quoting acts 2 38
[33:28] memorizing it
[33:29] i stopped cussing instantly because
[33:31] there's power in the name of jesus
[33:32] christ
[33:34] that's even before i was baptized
[33:38] and as i spoken more and more god gave
[33:39] me a victory over tobacco pornography
[33:42] magazines idolatry and even more
[33:45] before the name of jesus christ i was
[33:47] helpless
[33:48] and i'll say like this hopeless
[33:50] yeah i was like man there must be no
[33:52] church that can help me right
[33:54] where's the church that can help me
[33:55] right
[33:56] little i know i was only one hour from
[33:58] at the whole time praise god i was
[34:00] living in liberty center lima was one
[34:01] hour south i mean literally i just had
[34:03] to go down route 109 one hour and i
[34:06] could have found power amen
[34:08] but god knows god has a time and season
[34:10] for everything god ordered my footsteps
[34:12] god ordered your footsteps that's why
[34:14] you're here tonight in the house of god
[34:16] amen praise the lord
[34:18] once i started preaching i saw even more
[34:20] victory in the name of jesus
[34:23] the holy spirit cast out devils heal the
[34:24] sin bring deliverance
[34:26] uh bring forth babies to the barren and
[34:29] even more right hallelujah
[34:31] now i've never seen it maybe you uh i
[34:34] don't know anyone else says i've never
[34:35] seen a miracle done in the titles
[34:37] fathers and only goes i've never seen it
[34:38] no brother man said evil spirits follow
[34:41] fathers and holy ghosts because of the
[34:42] catholic church
[34:44] so they'll always say father son holy
[34:46] ghost well evil spirits follow that
[34:47] right
[34:49] but the real holy spirit follows the
[34:51] name of jesus christ
[34:53] amen that's right
[34:57] now the entire bible shows power in the
[34:59] name so lydia uh john 1 12 malachi acts
[35:03] 4 7.
[35:04] i'm going to pick on them first because
[35:05] they're mine
[35:09] but before we get there
[35:11] when david defeated goliath
[35:14] he didn't come in the titles of god no
[35:17] he came in the name
[35:18] the bible said the name
[35:20] of the lord of hosts amen
[35:22] [Applause]
[35:23] he came in the name of jehovah
[35:25] hallelujah
[35:26] jehovah's name
[35:29] hallelujah
[35:30] and what happened the the giant fell
[35:34] the mountain moved because there's power
[35:37] in the name of jesus amen amen you got
[35:40] to speak the name
[35:43] wonderful lydia john 1 12 redone
[35:46] but as many as received him to them gave
[35:49] he power to become the sons of god
[35:53] power to become through what believing
[35:54] in his
[35:56] church you automatically have more power
[35:58] than the catholic because you believe in
[36:00] the name amen
[36:02] not just i'm not speaking any bad
[36:04] against them but they do not take the
[36:05] name of jesus now some do they might
[36:07] actually there are catholic charismatics
[36:08] i should say that there are some that
[36:10] actually speak the name of jesus and
[36:11] they actually see sometimes miracles i
[36:13] should i should correct that yes let me
[36:14] correct that yeah god bless those
[36:16] catholic charismatics that are using the
[36:18] literal name of jesus christ that they
[36:20] get some results thank god i forgot
[36:22] about that
[36:23] but but jesus said powers in the name
[36:27] that uh melka acts 4 7.
[36:31] and when they had set them in the midst
[36:32] they asked by what power or by what name
[36:35] have you done this
[36:36] praise god that was after peter raised
[36:38] that paralyzed the layman there right
[36:40] and gave him perfect soundness of health
[36:42] and ability to walk
[36:44] and peter said by the name of jesus
[36:46] christ of nazareth whom he crucified
[36:48] whom god raised from the dead even by
[36:50] him does this man stand before you whole
[36:53] on amen
[36:55] see name represents power and authority
[36:57] because even your name your name first
[37:00] and last has power in it
[37:02] as soon as you say austin laramie people
[37:04] oh i got a reputation
[37:06] right as soon as you say jesse smith
[37:09] nope something comes to your mind
[37:11] because there's power in your name
[37:14] you have a reputation that follows your
[37:15] name oh there's an eternal reputation
[37:17] for this guy
[37:18] the champion of love this mighty man
[37:20] this god from heaven amen what a rapid
[37:23] rep
[37:23] for the reputation amen that jesus
[37:25] christ has the champion of love
[37:28] amen proverbs 22 1 says a good name is
[37:31] rather be chosen than great riches right
[37:33] and loving favor rather than silver and
[37:35] gold right
[37:37] see your name and actions have a
[37:39] powerful impact on other people
[37:42] hallelujah
[37:43] you see the names authority on a check
[37:45] right or a receipt you can't buy it
[37:47] unless you sign them i gotta have it
[37:48] signed why you're gonna throw away well
[37:50] i gotta have it just sign your name on
[37:51] the receipt
[37:52] it's gotta be on there now the one
[37:54] that's more powerful is the power of
[37:55] attorney
[37:57] anybody ever been a power attorney here
[38:01] banks and businesses will only honor one
[38:03] name
[38:05] and that's the name that's certified and
[38:06] notarized as being a power of attorney
[38:10] no other names have power
[38:12] so if you're a power attorney you have
[38:13] power over someone's bank account over
[38:15] their their vehicles over their house
[38:17] and their property you have all the
[38:19] power it's called the power of eternity
[38:21] i'm sorry attorney for rather
[38:24] hallelujah in the same way the name of
[38:26] the lord jesus christ is the name above
[38:29] all names amen it's the power of
[38:32] eternity for every blessing from heaven
[38:34] church it will receive it praise god
[38:37] amen
[38:39] hallelujah
[38:40] that's how you access every blessing
[38:42] pray in the name of jesus
[38:45] speak in the name of jesus amen
[38:48] sing in the name of jesus hallelujah
[38:50] right worship in the name of jesus
[38:52] everything you do in word of deed do it
[38:54] all in the name of the lord jesus christ
[38:56] amen
[38:58] hallelujah now you've got power behind
[39:00] your actions amen yeah
[39:03] now you got the power of eternity praise
[39:04] yeah
[39:06] yeah
[39:07] thank god
[39:09] that we have that power right
[39:12] now remember church there's a great
[39:14] prophecy that the name
[39:16] or power
[39:17] would be denied in the last days by the
[39:20] false church
[39:23] imposters of christianity will take a
[39:25] form of godliness but deny true
[39:27] godliness
[39:31] now church which which churches are
[39:32] teaching them uh teaching their their
[39:34] members to cast out devils in the
[39:36] literal name of jesus christ
[39:39] which churches are doing that
[39:40] very few yeah and there's there may be
[39:43] some charismatics that we said here and
[39:44] there but most are not teaching them to
[39:46] cast out devils in the name of jesus
[39:48] christ yeah and if you want to review
[39:50] i'll give you a real quick review
[39:53] before you try to cast it out make sure
[39:54] the person has repented their sins
[39:58] and then say do you want to be set free
[40:00] this is how it's operated in my life at
[40:01] least i've seen in my life
[40:02] as soon as they say they're sorry and
[40:04] they want to be free from it we go to
[40:06] prayer we rebuke that spirit and then
[40:08] pretty soon it leaves and they feel
[40:09] better about god's grace right so where
[40:11] they scream or cry or shout or we weep
[40:12] whatever they do whether they smile
[40:14] afterwards whatever happens praise god
[40:17] and that's the end of the review was
[40:18] that was that was that difficult
[40:22] it's because jesus said you're a house
[40:24] and demons are in control they bound up
[40:26] your house so you got to expose them and
[40:28] get them out of the house amen otherwise
[40:30] you've got to clean out the house amen
[40:32] you've got to repent and expose them and
[40:33] then the name of jesus christ and then
[40:35] jesus comes in that house he opens the
[40:37] door and he says get behind me to have
[40:39] away man go to dry places jesus wants to
[40:42] clean out our houses amen
[40:44] houses of our loved ones
[40:46] houses of our families amen
[40:48] our friends
[40:50] very simple
[40:52] so i just thought you'd like that review
[40:55] first well confess your sins i guess
[40:56] maybe say that first confess your sins
[40:58] first all right brother tried to pray
[40:59] when he lied to our irs and the holy
[41:01] spirit said get your hands off that shot
[41:03] me make that right first before you try
[41:06] to cast out disease and try to pray for
[41:08] healing and deliverance and all these
[41:10] things
[41:13] praise god
[41:18] like i never forget when uh we're gonna
[41:19] go there a few weeks sister uh sister
[41:21] barbara met napoleon
[41:22] beth's sister sister best sister she got
[41:24] glasses
[41:27] i went to their preach when she first
[41:28] come in the message i didn't even know
[41:29] it
[41:30] for some reason i preached on cigarettes
[41:32] i don't even know why i just i think the
[41:33] holy spirit led me off i started
[41:34] blasting cigarettes i didn't know she
[41:35] was addicted to cigarettes i never
[41:37] smelled cigarettes on her she came up
[41:38] for prayer and i rebuked that spirit in
[41:40] the name of jesus christ praise the lord
[41:42] she said she went home she smoked one
[41:44] more cigarette threw it away and she's
[41:46] been delivered for these last 10 years
[41:48] [Music]
[41:49] who what what was that say was cast out
[41:53] i don't know why she had no one more i
[41:54] don't know
[41:56] that's between her and god
[41:57] but she had one more and it was gone
[41:59] amen yeah
[42:02] so just you know
[42:04] the use in the name of jesus christ is a
[42:06] great privilege amen because it is power
[42:09] is authority
[42:11] amen
[42:13] it's the power of eternity over satan
[42:15] amen amen hallelujah amen praise god
[42:20] but in the last days the bible says
[42:21] they'll deny the name
[42:25] they deny the power
[42:27] and where is it it's in revelation 13
[42:29] 5-6 can you put it up there
[42:31] sure the bible says the beast the
[42:33] brother brother man called this triple
[42:35] blasphemy yeah
[42:38] there was given him a mouth this is
[42:39] speaking of the beast the beast out of
[42:40] water which was rome
[42:43] speaking great things and blasphemies
[42:44] and powers given under to continue 42
[42:46] months now that's the that's the first
[42:48] half of the tribulation right and he
[42:50] opened his mouth and blaspheme against
[42:51] god the blessing what his name
[42:53] so what does the catholic church do they
[42:54] blaspheme the name yeah right they call
[42:57] it they actually have it in their books
[42:59] i i can show it to you if you're not a
[43:01] catholic you're actually cursed
[43:02] i don't care what they say in the
[43:03] newspaper their books haven't changed
[43:06] right
[43:06] they say you're cursed if you're not a
[43:08] catholic yeah if you don't do the father
[43:10] son holy ghost and these things and you
[43:12] don't obey what the pope says you're
[43:13] cursed all right see because they're
[43:15] blaspheming so they're saying anyone
[43:17] outside of us is cursed by safety
[43:20] they're basically calling us the curse
[43:21] by satan they're calling the believers
[43:23] satan
[43:24] satan worshipers that's blasphemy
[43:27] to call the works of jesus be elizabeth
[43:30] is blasphemy this system has blasphemed
[43:32] the name of jesus christ but we've
[43:34] received the name of jesus christ we've
[43:36] got the power of eternity of the name of
[43:38] jesus christ amen
[43:40] hallelujah we've got the keys to the
[43:42] kingdom the name of jesus christ
[43:45] hallelujah amen
[43:47] hallelujah
[43:49] it was prophesied blasphemy church means
[43:51] to slander to speak evil
[43:54] it means to detract
[43:56] when someone blasphemes they slander
[43:59] something good and call it evil sure
[44:01] they detract from the holiness of god
[44:05] that means they take away the value or
[44:08] worth of that holy baptism that we have
[44:10] praise god
[44:11] the water baptism and the spirit baptism
[44:14] amen because there's doctrines of
[44:16] baptisms amen amen there's one there's
[44:18] actually three baptisms there's water
[44:19] baptism lord jesus christ there's the
[44:21] baptism of the human mind
[44:24] right that's what john the baptist said
[44:25] then there's the baptism of the soul
[44:27] which is what they have in the day of
[44:28] pentecost the church said amen that's
[44:31] why the hebrews says in hebrews 6 the
[44:33] doctrine of baptisms the first
[44:35] principles of the doctrines of the faith
[44:37] amen amen hallelujah
[44:42] that's exactly right go to deuteronomy
[44:44] 29 16.
[44:47] deuteronomy 29 16.
[44:53] that blocks a busy body back there
[44:57] maybe you got it
[44:59] all right
[45:00] i pick on my own first
[45:02] rescue i'm gonna get on sunday night
[45:05] just kidding
[45:07] probably 29 16. uh hey man uh do um
[45:11] so this is all about how the catholics
[45:13] bless themselves when they do that
[45:15] they're actually blessing themselves
[45:18] right sir
[45:21] what's it called it's they're taught to
[45:22] bless themselves using the sign of a
[45:24] cross and the titles father so he goes
[45:25] they're blessing themselves
[45:27] like that's what he went in the holy
[45:28] water brother ray was telling me they
[45:29] walk into church and they sprinkle
[45:30] themselves they're blessing themselves
[45:31] they're anointing themselves with holy
[45:33] water yeah
[45:35] like you like we have any power to
[45:36] anoint ourselves like we have power to
[45:38] anoint water right like that yeah now
[45:41] god could if god wanted to but like
[45:42] every time you walk into church
[45:45] okay i'm holding now that's they
[45:47] actually believe that as long as that
[45:48] eucharist is in their body now they're
[45:50] holy but when it goes out
[45:52] then they don't have the holiness
[45:53] anymore they got to go back and get the
[45:54] holiness
[45:55] aren't you glad church that the holy
[45:57] ghost
[45:59] it is sealed lock stock and barrel it's
[46:02] locked in i mean it's tied in there
[46:04] there's no way to get it out it's sealed
[46:06] through the damn redemption amen
[46:09] don't come out when there's not a leak
[46:11] in it there's not it doesn't come out
[46:13] when you're sick it doesn't leak out
[46:15] it's in your name it's a part of you
[46:17] it's a part of your character it's a
[46:18] part of your being you and the father
[46:20] are one amen
[46:23] hallelujah
[46:25] that's why when no gibson did that movie
[46:27] the passion which some parts were good
[46:29] but other parts were all catholic right
[46:32] he went to mass every single day
[46:35] to make sure he was under the anointing
[46:38] isn't that sad you got to go eat
[46:40] a wafer and drink some uh drink some
[46:43] grape juice i don't even know if they
[46:44] use wine brother
[46:45] oh they do okay well that's one good
[46:46] thing
[46:48] that's a good thing there one good step
[46:51] but he had to make sure he was under the
[46:52] anointing the church also you've got to
[46:54] get on anointing and say jesus forgiven
[46:56] my sins i'm going to obey your word
[46:58] amen
[46:59] we don't got to go have a mass and do
[47:00] all these things and bow down
[47:03] open up and swallow it ridiculous
[47:06] nonsense
[47:08] and act like jesus just died right
[47:09] that's what they do they act like jesus
[47:11] just died right there when they do
[47:12] transubstantiation right they call it
[47:15] they call it the present calvary yeah
[47:18] calvary's present jesus is literally
[47:21] dead right there he's dying right there
[47:23] he's dead right there and then they
[47:24] partake of his blood and his
[47:25] his body yeah
[47:27] that's what they that's what they
[47:28] believe literally what they believe yes
[47:31] it's called transubstantiation look it
[47:32] up sometimes
[47:34] it's true they're not ashamed of it no
[47:36] well i'm not ashamed of our truth either
[47:37] praise god amen hallelujah okay haven uh
[47:40] read 16 huh
[48:02] all right next one
[48:04] yes
[48:13] turned away from this day from the lord
[48:16] our god to go and serve the gods of
[48:18] these
[48:28] you're going to see the next verse
[48:29] they're going to bless themselves
[48:31] when does a person bless themselves
[48:34] just walk around and say
[48:36] i'm blessing you jesse i'm going to
[48:37] bless you today hey you're blessed
[48:40] i'm blessing you you ever do that
[48:42] no you don't bless yourself now i like
[48:44] what other people say god bless you
[48:45] brother jesse i sure yeah thank you lord
[48:47] thank you keep me blessed yeah but we
[48:50] don't bless ourselves right
[48:52] right
[48:53] we're told to bless others bless those
[48:54] who persecute you pray for those who
[48:55] despite the using we're told to bless
[48:57] others but not ourselves so who what is
[49:00] the condition of a person who blesses
[49:01] themselves all the time
[49:03] their hearts turned away from god
[49:06] they think they can bless themselves
[49:07] yeah
[49:08] you can't bless yourself mercy only god
[49:10] can bless you and god will only bless
[49:11] you when you obey the word that he's
[49:13] revealed to you praise god hallelujah
[49:16] next verse 19.
[49:17] that's all let's all read this one two
[49:19] three and it come to pass when he
[49:22] heareth the words of this curse that he
[49:25] blessed himself in his heart saying i
[49:28] shall have peace though i walk in the
[49:31] imagination of my heart to add
[49:33] drunkenness to things leave it out there
[49:36] isn't that what they're doing they're
[49:37] walking in the imagination catholicism
[49:39] is actually real yeah like mary's
[49:42] actually
[49:43] taking down those and say jesus do you
[49:45] mind it uh can i bother you do you mind
[49:47] if i bother you can you meet these needs
[49:49] right here like jesus like mary can
[49:50] intercede that's what they believe right
[49:52] brother believe they believe jesus is
[49:54] mad with them right going to the father
[49:56] she goes to the father
[49:58] god
[49:59] yeah
[50:00] for us
[50:01] right because uh jesus gets pain every
[50:04] time we sin
[50:06] and he's mad at us right you showed that
[50:07] we showed that from your schooling
[50:10] and then well if anybody's gonna if
[50:12] anyone's gonna get jesus attention it's
[50:13] gonna be mary
[50:15] that's what they believe yeah
[50:18] insane but if jesus is god he can hear
[50:20] all of our prayers amen
[50:22] they say he's all god but he can't
[50:24] handle all their prayers what a lie what
[50:26] a contradiction my god is not that least
[50:28] my god is greater than that
[50:30] [Applause]
[50:34] see they
[50:35] they spew out these lies but they're
[50:36] constricting their own false doctrine
[50:38] amen full of lies full of contradictions
[50:42] amen
[50:46] see
[50:46] they bless themselves
[50:48] rather than let god bless them
[50:51] how many want to be blessed by god amen
[50:54] i don't want to be under god's curse i
[50:55] want to be under god's blessing amen see
[50:58] so we let we obey god's word and then
[51:00] god will bless us
[51:02] i was praying for a
[51:05] financial blessing
[51:07] to help out some of those saints in
[51:08] uganda because they are going through a
[51:10] famine a literal famine
[51:12] i asked the one brother uh he's a
[51:13] messenger pastor
[51:15] i said brother
[51:18] oh no i'm sorry yeah i talked to him and
[51:20] then one of his members emailed me
[51:22] asking for money i said well doesn't
[51:23] your pat did you ask your pastor for
[51:25] money i was just kind of i was wondering
[51:28] yeah
[51:29] and she's like well yes but they only
[51:30] give us like a couple handfuls of meal
[51:32] every sunday for the whole week
[51:36] the church how many of you
[51:39] could last
[51:41] two handfuls
[51:43] of meal for the whole week
[51:46] and that's what these and
[51:48] they sent me pictures where they're
[51:49] they're still having outdoor services
[51:51] trying to attract people they're up
[51:52] there dancing now you think after all
[51:53] that dancing and clapping and praising
[51:54] god don't you think they get hungry
[51:58] now they they they can still get it
[52:00] somewhere else but because the ti the
[52:02] pastor gets a little bit i mean he just
[52:03] gets a little bit of ties and offers
[52:04] just a little bit right
[52:09] so see it's a very
[52:10] it's a very difficult thing for them
[52:12] anyways i was praying lord sent us a
[52:13] blessing i got i go come in from work
[52:15] yesterday and there's two letters and

[52:46] supernatural he could just create bread
[52:48] there but he'd also like to train some
[52:51] of our character to pray for them and
[52:53] feel their burdens
[52:55] and be able to pray more and humble
[52:57] humble ourselves
[52:59] and brother jesse said amen
[53:02] humble myself and stop worrying about my
[53:04] first world problems
[53:08] and start caring about people who they
[53:10] have to make it through a week with a
[53:12] couple handfuls of bread
[53:15] of course they could you know they could
[53:16] try to work elsewhere but they said the
[53:18] economy's so bad
[53:21] because of famine
[53:23] so church how many are blessed today
[53:24] praise god very bad
[53:26] so blessed yes
[53:28] so blessed uh i want to try to bring
[53:30] this down to close here so let me see
[53:31] where i can go here
[53:36] help me jesus i just need the grace of
[53:38] the lord here
[53:42] i think uh
[53:44] yeah let's just close with first john 5
[53:46] 7. if you turn there that's all it's all
[53:48] turned in i think i'll just close with
[53:49] that one because that's the order of the
[53:51] book that i go so in the book
[53:53] towards the end of the chapter i just
[53:55] list all the the main scriptures that
[53:56] trinitarians disagree or the
[53:58] transgenders misinterpret like genesis 1
[54:01] 26 uh matthew 28 19 first john 5 7
[54:05] some other ones
[54:07] the main ones that they use
[54:11] thank you
[54:13] all right let's read that on for you all
[54:15] of us one two three for there are three
[54:17] that bear record in heaven the father
[54:21] the word and the holy ghost and these
[54:24] three are ones so trinitarians look at
[54:26] this and they say this says three
[54:28] persons does this ever does this does
[54:29] anyone see where it says three persons
[54:32] no no that's it at all but rather it
[54:34] gives support that god is one person
[54:36] because it says these three are one one
[54:39] one
[54:40] these three are one
[54:42] what are what are three there are three
[54:43] manifestations
[54:45] right because god is invisible before
[54:46] there was any space of time there was
[54:48] god
[54:48] but god had to make manifestations he
[54:50] had to appear the word manifest means to
[54:52] appear he had to appear he was invisible
[54:54] amen
[54:55] he had appeared he appeared as the
[54:56] father
[54:57] right
[54:58] he appeared as the word the son and he's
[55:01] appearing today as the holy ghost praise
[55:02] god hallelujah
[55:05] so it doesn't say three persons no it's
[55:08] three manifestations just like matthew
[55:10] 28 19.
[55:13] sure
[55:14] and see church just so the truth
[55:16] there's a catholic watching this son is
[55:18] not a name because it doesn't say the
[55:19] word sun here it says word right
[55:22] so sun is not a name if some was a
[55:24] special word john who knew the sun
[55:27] he laid in the bosom of the sun would he
[55:29] use the word sun if it was a special
[55:31] name it's not a name it's a title right
[55:35] it's a manifestation
[55:38] right
[55:40] so they're interchangeable sun and word
[55:42] are interchangeable because in the
[55:43] beginning was the word the words with
[55:44] god the word was god right and then the
[55:46] bible said in revelation 19 jesus was
[55:48] clothed with a vesture dipped in blood
[55:50] and his name is called the word of god
[55:52] what do you call the son the word of god
[55:55] hallelujah amen
[55:57] now what's not familiar is that most
[55:59] people don't understand these three
[56:01] manifestations will bear record in
[56:03] heaven for every person
[56:05] in other words you lived under one of
[56:06] these three
[56:07] dominions either lived under the father
[56:09] manifestation or the father dominion the
[56:12] son dominion or the holy ghost dominion
[56:15] and each one will witness against or for
[56:17] you amen thank god
[56:19] thank god the holy ghost will witness
[56:20] for us amen amen that we believe the
[56:22] word we repented we got baptized in the
[56:25] name of the lord jesus christ amen
[56:28] we believe what the bible says about
[56:30] everyone healing and and miracles holy
[56:32] and doctrine and all these wonderful
[56:34] blessings and mysteries we believe what
[56:36] it says we believe what the bible says
[56:38] the holy ghost will witness to that in
[56:40] heaven that we believed it amen amen
[56:44] hallelujah
[56:47] like i've said this many times but i'm
[56:49] resting my soul on that yes
[56:51] i've left denominations i've got friends
[56:54] i've left everything for this message
[56:56] i'm resting in my soul that this
[56:58] revelation is thus saith the lord amen
[57:01] amen
[57:02] they're calling me heretics they've all
[57:03] forsaken me they call me uh i've lost my
[57:06] rocker
[57:07] i don't know what they're saying
[57:09] mercy i don't want to know what they say
[57:11] all right
[57:12] that's okay sticks and stones may break
[57:14] my bones but words will never hurt me
[57:17] right they won't ever hurt me
[57:20] but see we're standing on the revelation
[57:22] of god's word
[57:24] you live
[57:25] in the days before the sun let's go to
[57:27] jude uh jude 1 and verses 14 and 15.
[57:34] if enoch preached to you then the father
[57:37] was a witness against you
[57:39] if people if people rejected enoch's
[57:42] preaching that rapture boy their hair
[57:44] wraps your type there amen the seventh
[57:46] from adam
[57:48] whoever received believe enoch
[57:51] of the father witnesses for them but
[57:54] whoever rejected enoch
[57:56] the father would witness against them
[58:00] the bible said he prophesied of these
[58:02] saying
[58:03] enoch the son from adam prophesied he
[58:05] said behold the lord cometh with ten
[58:06] thousand of his saints enoch prophesied
[58:09] of the battle of armageddon
[58:12] to execute judgment upon all to convince
[58:14] other ungodly among them of all their
[58:16] ungodly deeds which they have ungodly
[58:19] committed and all their hard speeches
[58:21] which ungodly sinners have spoken
[58:23] against him it sounds like jude wants us
[58:25] to know to be godly amen amen he says
[58:28] there are ungodly speeches there are
[58:30] ungodly lies so church what should our
[58:32] we should have godly prayer means
[58:34] godly services we should dress godly we
[58:37] should talk godly we should live godly
[58:39] we should be godly amen amen
[58:42] hallelujah
[58:43] if not it's judgment executed against
[58:45] the ungodly
[58:50] was the father's warning because the sun
[58:51] had not come
[58:52] right
[58:54] moses said i call heaven and earth to
[58:57] record this day against you that i've
[58:59] set before you life and death blessing
[59:01] and cursing therefore choose life that
[59:03] both thou and thy seed may live i call
[59:06] heaven and earth to witness against you
[59:09] right because there be witnesses on the
[59:10] earth
[59:11] human witnesses on the day of judgment
[59:13] but heaven also witnessed when god sent
[59:15] a prophet heaven would vindicate the
[59:16] prophet you know brother and use the
[59:19] same verse
[59:20] i think it was uh i'll look it up i
[59:22] think it was anointed once at any time i
[59:23] couldn't remember which one it was
[59:25] but he said so say i to you in the name
[59:27] of jesus christ don't you add one thing
[59:29] to the revelation god has given very
[59:31] badly amen
[59:33] i thought heaven and earth now think
[59:34] about the people that have added to
[59:36] brother revelation
[59:38] heaven and earth
[59:40] will witness against them sure
[59:42] that they that they became the eighth
[59:44] messenger or they allowed polygamy
[59:47] or they made every word on the tape thus
[59:48] saith the lord
[59:50] it's gonna witness against them right
[59:55] see i call heaven and earth what what
[59:57] dispensation was that that was the
[59:58] father dispensation
[1:00:01] these three bear record in heaven the
[1:00:02] father the word and the holy ghost these
[1:00:05] three are one
[1:00:08] now i could go many more remember i read
[1:00:10] to you a few weeks ago malachi said the
[1:00:11] father was a witness against the ungodly
[1:00:14] jewish men who mistreated their wives
[1:00:17] god will be of the father we a witness
[1:00:19] against them on the day of judgment
[1:00:21] because he sent the word he said the
[1:00:23] word through malachi praise god
[1:00:24] hallelujah
[1:00:26] that old testament prophet see god
[1:00:27] witnessing against heaven god went i'm
[1:00:30] sorry god witnessing from heaven to
[1:00:31] earth
[1:00:34] jesus
[1:00:36] said the works the same works that i do
[1:00:38] bear witness to me
[1:00:40] that the father has sent me sure so his
[1:00:43] works
[1:00:44] would witness of him that means if they
[1:00:46] turn down the works the works will
[1:00:48] witness against them sure
[1:00:52] jesus said the word that i've spoken to
[1:00:54] you the same shall judge him at the last
[1:00:56] day
[1:00:57] aren't you glad you're letting the word
[1:00:58] judge you right now praise god right
[1:01:00] i'm not going to wait for the last name
[1:01:02] for i want the only i want to look the
[1:01:04] hard sayings in the bible and i would
[1:01:05] look at them now and say god forgive me
[1:01:07] change my heart give me a new heart give
[1:01:09] me your spirit give me your give me a
[1:01:11] new spirit new heart new spirit give me
[1:01:13] all that so i can fulfill your word
[1:01:15] right now i can be judged now praise god
[1:01:17] hallelujah i can be forgiven now bless
[1:01:20] god
[1:01:22] because jesus said the words that i've
[1:01:23] spoken will judgment at the last day
[1:01:25] sure that includes jesus words but also
[1:01:27] jesus words through paul
[1:01:29] because paul said my gospel will judge
[1:01:30] all of them remember his gospel is the
[1:01:32] judgment standard
[1:01:36] hallelujah
[1:01:38] jesus said remember we went through this
[1:01:39] a few weeks ago
[1:01:41] jesus said there's going to be two
[1:01:43] witnesses rise up on the day of judgment
[1:01:45] he said the queen of the south men of
[1:01:47] nineveh
[1:01:48] they're gonna rise up against that
[1:01:49] generation and of course jesus will be
[1:01:51] standing right there on the throne or
[1:01:53] sitting rather
[1:01:54] right there on the throne
[1:01:56] see the father is a witness
[1:01:58] the eternal spirit
[1:01:59] the son is the witness and today the
[1:02:01] holy ghost is a witness
[1:02:04] i'll put up acts 5 31-32
[1:02:10] today the holy ghost gives witness for
[1:02:13] people when they're born again
[1:02:16] so if you're not born again keep
[1:02:17] believing until you're born again praise
[1:02:19] god amen amen that is heaven's witness
[1:02:22] that god has accepted your faith amen
[1:02:24] amen that's what the bible says
[1:02:28] god
[1:02:29] him hath god exalted with his right hand
[1:02:30] to be a prince and a savior for to give
[1:02:32] repentance to israel forgiveness of sins
[1:02:34] and we are as witnesses how we are
[1:02:36] witnesses of these things and so also
[1:02:38] the holy ghost whom god has given to
[1:02:40] them that obey him praise god amen
[1:02:42] hallelujah
[1:02:45] so the witness today that god is with
[1:02:47] you is that god lives in you praise god
[1:02:50] by the baptism of the holy ghost
[1:02:53] and so see on the day of judgment
[1:02:55] the father the word and the holy ghost
[1:02:58] will bear witness
[1:03:00] because whichever dispensation you lived
[1:03:02] in the word that was preached the works
[1:03:04] that were done that either witnesses for
[1:03:06] you you accepted it or witnesses against
[1:03:08] you because you've turned it down
[1:03:10] i'll be glad to be in the house of the
[1:03:11] lord tonight amen
[1:03:13] because you're a witness for the truth
[1:03:15] your witness for the revelation
[1:03:18] hallelujah
[1:03:20] and jesus said any word spoken against
[1:03:22] this will not be forgiven in this world
[1:03:25] neither in the world to come
[1:03:27] now we saw it on sunday people can
[1:03:29] blaspheme ignorantly like paul did
[1:03:32] and even paul blast him and then he
[1:03:33] tried to get other people to blaspheme
[1:03:35] but he didn't realize jesus was god
[1:03:38] but once he met jesus once he knew jesus
[1:03:40] was god then he said lord what must i do
[1:03:42] amen
[1:03:44] that's why we're here tonight lord what
[1:03:45] do you want me to do with my life how do
[1:03:47] you want me to invest my short few days
[1:03:49] on this earth my little humble
[1:03:50] insignificant life how do you want me to
[1:03:52] invest in just tell me what you want me
[1:03:54] to do and i'll do it praise god amen
[1:03:56] that's humility praise god
[1:04:00] that's what paul said when he first got
[1:04:01] saved lord what do you want me to do
[1:04:03] what shall i do
[1:04:06] jesus i got a job for you please
[1:04:09] preach to the gentiles go to jerusalem
[1:04:13] so church is in closing let's stand to
[1:04:14] our feet musicians can come first john 5
[1:04:17] 7 when it's closely examined it's clear
[1:04:19] john was not listing three persons that
[1:04:21] will sit on three thrones in heaven
[1:04:23] there is no scripture that says there
[1:04:24] are three thrones in heaven there's only
[1:04:26] one throne in heaven amen right look it
[1:04:29] up in uh revelation 4 the bible says one
[1:04:32] throne one sat on the throne not three
[1:04:34] thrones right
[1:04:40] so john is not listing three persons
[1:04:42] he's rather
[1:04:44] showing god three manifestations that
[1:04:46] serve as heavenly witnesses for all the
[1:04:49] action of humanity true praise god
[1:04:52] true hallelujah church that's the
[1:04:54] greatest witness we could have today is
