========================================

and we see that and when you see that happening and that's what we need to cry out like we did this morning america that they would be crucified amen we can't crucify them but we have the holy ghost power within us the table amen to the crucified [Music] hebrews i'm not quite sure which direction to go here with this thought and you pray to god amen blessed jesus i made the acquaintance of all of you here and i know i've met many of before and i'm terrible with names i can't remember i do remember brother bang meeting him for quite a few years and always enjoyed to see him work well or had car trouble this morning and weren't able to be with us it's sure good to see you tonight god would allow us to meet up again real soon chosen time hebrews chapter 12. amen i want to begin with the 25th verse you may have it say amen amen amen amen we read this it says see that ye refuse not him that speaketh for if they escape not who refused him to speak that's fake on earth much more shall not we escape if we turn away from him that speaketh from heaven whose voice then shook the earth but now he has promised saying yet once more i shake not the earth only but also heaven and this word amen this word yet once more signifies the removing of those things that are shaken that as the as of the things that are made that those things which cannot be shaken may remain what what's the what does the removing of the shakeable things the word of all might amen the word of almighty god wherefore we receive a kingdom there's our word again that's not to leave we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our god our god is a consuming amen amen hallelujah amen i just want to read one more spot and then just kind of debate on whether to put this scripture in here but the lord just needs me to put it in here right now matthew 7 chapter verse 24 matthew 7 24 whosoever heareth these sayings of mine and do with them i will liken him unto a wise man which build his house upon a rock we know the prophet god teaches that rock is a type of revelation hallelujah [Music] amen and everyone that heareth these sayings almighty doeth them not shall be likened unto a foolish man which built his house upon the sand and the rains descended the floods came and the wind blew and beat upon that house and it fell and great was the fall of it yes and then the house fell because it was built upon the wrong revelation that's right and then the house fell because someone heard the word and didn't heed the word amen he said this is them that speaketh we've heard one speak from heaven in our day and then let's not refuse them to have spoken hallelujah heavenly father once again we approach you this evening where god asks that you would just take complete control father move me out of the way lord amen once again guard my lips with that say something that's wrong or contrary to your word or to this great message that we follow lord amen which is jesus christ and lord god we just pray lord god that you would amen just speak through other words that would encourage this little portion of the body of christ as we see the day approaching the day that we're living that's jesus there's so many people falling away or so many people going back lord god the things that we've been delivered from lord god amen let us cry like we said this way oh god hold me back don't let me go and be one of those fathers tonight as we look into this word let us be possessed by that consuming fire that's able to take lord god all these things and consume them from our lives tonight we commit this timely people into your hands ask the lord to be with them i mean if you have a little bride there and i'll be in there tonight lord god who are you preach the word brother matthew as he ministers your word to the people tonight use him in a special way lord amen i just pray lord god feed the sheep there and get [Music] we thank you for the shepherd that you put in their way lord god we we love brother jesse and all that he stands for this message lord we just pray lord god you continue to give in revelation on the word of god amen he might lead this little group into a rapture father we just love you appreciate you ask your presence be among us tonight lord god everything that'll be done will be done to bring glory and honor to the name of the lord jesus christ in that name we pray amen amen amen amen you can be seated tonight i said i want to preach a little thought on uh our god being a consuming fire we talked this morning or being possessed by a consuming fire we talked this morning how that now that we need like david to cry out lord god even hold me back from those sins that i've been delivered from hold me back from the video taking me out don't let me start to get back into those things don't let me love those things so much yeah that i can't let them go and we see this trying to creep its way back in not just not just out in the world in the world but we see it trying to creep its way back into the believers in the message of the hour yeah and it it alarming to me and i saw some things that i didn't like and i just felt led to lead i felt led to preach this thought in our whole church and uh i just believe it was received well and i pray that it's received well tonight amen we find out over in the in the bible amen that a lot of people we've heard a voice spoke from heaven today how many believe we've heard a voice speak from heaven today amen amen a lot of people don't believe that that was the voice of god that spoke from heaven he said whose voice then shook the earth but once more he signifies the shaking that's taking place a voice that's spoken in our day amen let's not refuse that voice that we've heard speak from heaven in our day how many believes that the prophet of god come the voice of god spoke to us that man right from heaven right from heaven's gate god spoke through that man's lips amen amen and spoke truth to us in this day so so many people say well our our church is we don't believe quite the way you do our church doesn't quite think you have to do these things and our church thinks it's okay if you do those things but we've been delivered from all that once let's not get let's not let that world pull us back into those things that god has delivered hallelujah amen since you know we find out amen that they these people in the message even some people in the message circle starting to lean back to the things that god has delivered us from right god has taken us out of them but yet we see amen the dress start to slip in our women we see the things that people start to do start to creep back in that the prophet of god has delivered us the word of god through the prominent god has delivered us from yes we see those things start to and when you when you bring that up and then you become unpopular that's right you bring that up people say well you know why they didn't because they wanted like we said this point they're wanting to satisfy this old flesh man right that's right to satisfy this old guy because it makes me feel good to do those things or go to those places or or to you or to have people think that i look a certain way i look good like this and then like our sisters you know so many times the sister's been delivered i thank god but i see holy ghost-filled sisters here yes you know you go to some circles there are messy circles and you see that that that straining at the bit you see that pulling back to those things of the world those sins that we've been delivered from right the prophet of god has told us it's spoken our day how to be delivered from these things man we see it trying to creep its way back in among us yes we see it not just in the women or not just that when we see it it may start to uh to accept things or go to places that they shouldn't be going to amen we find it made people doing things that the prophet of god said if you do those things they're going to love those things the world the love of god is not even in you that's right but we find those little pet things that we used to enjoy so much when before we heard the word of god that god that shook all those things out of us amen yes [Applause] [Music] [Applause] amen but you know that people will say well our church doesn't quite teach it that way or archer that if it's not your churches what does the word of god say amen amen what did the prophet say in disney well i know but i think he said i think it's not what we think is what he said right yes over the book of kings we find out that there was an elijah in that day too and he was he was going through the same problems that we were going through in this day people begin to think that well uh our our thoughts are just as good as your thoughts or our thoughts are just as good as your thoughts what makes you the authority just because you've got this prophet elijah amen over the book of first kings we find out elijah came to the people and he asked this question he said how long halt you between two opinions how long are you going to halt between two opinions if the lord be god follow him yes he said but if they'll be god then follow him and the people didn't have an answer they didn't have an answer for the word they didn't have an answer but here's the prophet of god saying hey look either either this is truth or it isn't truth which way are you going to which way are you going to go yes then elijah said other people i even i only remain a prophet unto the lord that's a pretty bold statement in a day and age we're living in but i would be so far i would go so far as to say that the elijah of our day could say the very same thing i even i only if i've left i'm a prophet unto the lord yes right there's 1200 some different denominations right but there's one message that's true unto the word of they all god right right well we don't think you have to do that all you sisters don't have to dress like all your brothers can do this we think it's all my pastor says it's okay hey man well how you going to know yes i want to follow the god that's vindicated by fire notice what elijah told him he said therefore give me two bullets and let them choose one bullet for themselves he says prophets alvaro's prophets are 450 men i say well there's more than 450 false prophets out there right so let's have a showdown to find out just exactly who is god and who is it god he said let them therefore give us two bullets and let them choose one bullet for themselves cut it in pieces lay it on the wood and put no fire under it and i will dress the other book and land on the wood and i'll put no fire on it and it said that the one and you call on the name of your god and i will call upon the name of my lord and of the lord and the god that answers by fire let him be god amen is that fair enough yes let the golden eggs and i said if we would ask that today what god what lord has spoken or been vindicated in our day by fire other than the prophet of god for our day that's right the pillar of fire come down had a pitcher took it right over him and the pillar of fire raced down and then decided when he was ministering the word of god he was vindicated by fire amen that's right amen let's not let's not let's not turn away from our ears from the hearing of that word that he told us how to be delivered from all these things yes hallelujah let the one that makes himself known by fire let him be god and you know what began to you know what they begin to do all right our god's just as good as your god our god says you can have homosexual preachers our god says you can do this our god's going to do that our god said he gonna do that and he says well let the god that answers by fire my god says those things are sinful and you get them out of the church that's right we talked about this morning hold me back from those things lord amen but then we see them try to creep their way back into their church i mean i hear i'm here to say let's have a showdown that god did answer it by far amen and you know what they're doing they're doing all kinds of stuff in the world today i mean as they begin he said he let them go first yeah go ahead and show me and they begin to do this and they begin to shout they begin to rule they begin to holler and they begin to they begin to worship god call on bail they begin to do all these things you know we see at the churches today but we had a great meeting they shouted they ran they jumped and they hollered they glorified god but where was the fire amen that's right amen amen wherever the holy ghost did at all amen hallelujah where would that consuming fire consume all that amen yeah amen glory i'm not against all that stuff that stuff's good but let let when you hit the ground let's make sure we're walking according to the world hey man hallelujah man when they got done keep beginning to mock him in the middle of you know the whole story i'm not going to go into all that but church they're making a mockery of what god's word really says amen yes and probably god stood on his word he said no this is the word of god let the god that answers by fire our god is a consuming fire amen amen he said let him come down and consume the sacrifice how many know the word of god says i beseech you therefore brother present your bodies a living sacrifice holy acceptance let it be consumed that sacrifice need to be consumed and all the sin that was there needs to be consumed hallelujah glory as we said today amen it means to me it needs to be mortified or put to death yes hallelujah and they couldn't god didn't answer god didn't answer god and elijah got tired of it after a while he said okay he said i'll let the god that answered by far to let him be god amen the bible says over in the 36th verse that first kings 18 it said that it came to pass at the time of the evening sacrifice notice where it was it was in the evening it was in the evening time that the word of god was made manifest in there church i believe we're there this is the evening time yeah a whole lot later than we think amen oh he said and it came to pass about the time of the evening sacrifice that elijah the prophet came near and said lord god of abraham isaac and israel let it be known let it be known that thou art god in israel and that i am thy servant and that i have done all these things at thy word he said this word yet once more signifies the things that can be shaken yes let everybody know that i didn't just come up with this on my own this is thy word amen this is thus saith the lord amen amen many believe you've had in the life of you amen amen hear me o lord he began to speak that this people may know that thou art the lord and that thou has turned their heart back church there's been a people whose hearts have been turned back thanks to the word of god and are they amen he said the fire of god fell and it consumed the bird's sacrifice how many are thankful for a fire of god amen that holy ghost fire that fell and consumed this old sacrifice [Applause] hey oh thank you jesus thank you lord he said the lord is gonna consume the birth sacrifice that's why paul said i beseech you to present your body a living sacrifice let the holy ghost fire come down and burn it and consume it amen amen but not only did it consume the sacrifice but it consumed the wood and the stone and the dust and licked up the water you know the story he went watered down and built a trench and did all that it took all that out of the way i mean yes not only did it take anybody to burn all the dross out of this old flesh amen but all those things that troubled the flesh all the dust and all the things in the filth of this world it just consumed it all amen amen [Applause] when the people saw it all they fell on their face said the lord is god the lord he is god and elijah said unto them now listen elijah said to them he said take up the prophets of baal those false prophets all these false churches all these false things that the people paul that got him into the mess that they're in oh my church says it's okay my church says it's all right to cut your hair sister my church says it's okay to wear makeup my church says all this but the prophet of god the word has spoken are they said to get that thing out of there that's right right nobody believes it amen oh brother jim are you one of those legalistic preachers say that are you narrow-minded i said yeah i'm just as narrow-minded as this right here yeah that's how narrow mind is he says it in the word that's the way i believe it amen all right amen so what is it oh and he said he took the prophet the baal those things that have got us in the position and the mess that we're in said this is okay or that's okay it's not okay the word of god has spoken been vindicated by fire amen yes and he said let not one then not one yes not one of those let them escape and they took them down and they brought them down to the brook kishon and they slew them there yes first that's what we need to do tonight that's what's version i mean i like spurgeon hallelujah like i said when i'm studying something i study spurgeon quite a bit i study him and see what he said he says the same thing the prophet of god amen amen and spurgeon says this he says when the prophet elijah had received the answer to his prayer the fire from heaven consumed the sacrifice in the presence of the people and he called immediately upon the assembly of the people now he called upon the assembly of the people to take the priest to baal and he sternly cried let not one of them escape the church they said god is calling upon the people amen who have seen god vindicated they don't believe one of those old things amen [Applause] that bothered you up to this point [Applause] it's accepted your sacrament make sure not one of them escapes amen amen he said let one escape he took them all down and he slew them there he said so must with being with our sins they all are doomed we must not let one of them be preserved good not one of those things that we used to do don't let them be preserved in your life amen that's right because we have to make sure they are all consumed by that power we can't do it but there's a power brother william that can do it there's a power that old sin that old sinful nature thank god not one of them be preserved not no matter how dear that sin is to you spirit not though it'll cry oh oh no no you don't want to get rid of me right oh you know how good you look when you wear this kind of shirt or this kind of dress remember what it is hey man right don't let that thing escape oh but i i really like the way i look when i dress like this i really like the way i do when i do these things don't let it escape that's right every one of those things have been they have to be put to death you have to mortify all those things amen he says that's right he said every sin must be struck down amen hallelujah he said god struck at sin when he laid it upon his own son amen how many believes that he said i'm going to lay him all upon him that's right right he didn't really go off and then he struck sitting down and he went to great great depths to do it when he laid it upon his old son yes hallelujah he said with stern unflinching purpose must you condemn to death amen must you condemn to death the sin which once was idle in your heart it was an idol yes yes it was an idol that i looked good it was an idol that i was a hot shot it was an island i was the most beautiful thing on the face where boys would whistle with me when i walked down the street kill that thing he said amen said he's got to be put to death glory it's your brother jim amen we thought you'd come and preach something that would just be real deep i told you i'm not a deep preacher but church when i see something that's trying to invade and hurt my sheep i want that thing killed amen yes that's right hallelujah purpose you must condemn the death of sin was once idle in your what an idol in your heart he says how are you going to accomplish that how are you going to do it elijah didn't worry about accomplishing it how he was going to do it it was the fire that did it it was the holy ghost that did it it was the power of god that did it that's what we're going to jesus promised us it's his power that'll do it he says you have grace to overcome every sin amen they have that grace given to you to overcome sin it's been given to you in the covenant of grace he says you have strength to win the victory and in the crusade against the inward lust of the flesh because christ jesus christ has promised that i'll always be with you i'll never leave you i'll never forsake you that power is there but we need to draw upon that power amen nobody believes it tonight hallelujah we're getting down to the wires it's sin killing time in here [Applause] and he's coming back without a spot or a wrinkle hey man jesus he's getting ready to bring us into the promised land how many believe it hallelujah he's getting ready to take us home maybe you know when they got ready to take the children israel got ready to go over to their promised land you find over in deuteronomy it says when the deuteronomy 7 1 says when the lord thy god shall bring thee into the land and we call that the promised land let me know amen you know what a lot of people say oh well god's come to take us to heaven too brother brown says you got that wrong that's not the promised land he says cannon too big a lot of people confuse canada with being over in the promised land as being a type of heaven it's not heaven he says there's a lot of wars going on right now he said here he said when god put you into the promised land where is that promised land i just want to take you back to the book of acts i want to show you something that to me because they were brother jimmy you're all wet and that's okay leave me alone i'm happy this way but he said he said

type it's not a type of heaven right listen in acts 2 37 he says when the promise is given unto you all right amen i got that so it's not a type of heaven it's a type of the holy ghost that will give us power amen to take that or to possess the land amen amen so when the lord shall get bring you into the land how many believes he brought us into the holy spirit tonight he says where you go to

types girgicides amorites canaanites perizzites amen highlights amend jebusites seven nations greater and more mighty than thou art right i'm just gonna read that a little bit differently i'm not trying to add to or take away the scriptures but when he had delivered you from cigarettes that's right i delivered you from alcohol with the holy spirit to set you free from dressing like a harlot for the holy spirit told you not to come here with the holy spirit brought you into the promised land [Applause] [Music] amen amen but the lord your god shall deliver them before thee and thou shalt smite them and he said what do you do you utterly destroy them right you don't have the power but his power goes with you in the holy ghost and he said then that holy ghost power in you will only destroy them don't let one of them live amen amen thou shalt smite them utterly destroy them thou shalt make no covenant with them nor show no mercy to them yes neither shalt thou make marriages with them thy daughter shall not bury that nor give unto his son nor his daughter shalt thou give unto thy son no shelter unto thy son for they don't get old you man you have to have trifold with your bible when they get your head just wrong you can't see what you read amen when the lord their god shall deliver thee from before them and thou shalt smite them and utterly destroy them then shalt they'll make no covenant with them nor show no mercy to them we show mercy to some of these things because they satisfy our flesh that's right brother right neither shalt thou make marriages with them

like a pole cat in me he's as long as he believes this messaging he's got such cute little feet amen brother brown said how many read that in the message where he said that i don't care if he's got he's got feet like box cars he says if he believes this message that's all right he said if you don't if you if you go against it you if you even refuse this word that's shaking all that stuff out of us there's no more hope for us jesus he says for they will turn away thy son from following me they may serve other gods and the anger of the lord will be killed against you amen and destroy these sudden how about you but that's a stern warning yes i mean get that stuff killed get it done god's delivered is what don't let it creep back in and have any part in our lives this does show you deal with them you shall destroy their altars he said and break down their images and cut down their groves and burn their graven images with fire in other words he said every everything that even represents these things that you once were held and then captive by make sure every bit of it is destroyed one little thing escaping hallelujah glory but you know what the prophet god said one time he

young men at church how to dress and how to how to how to act and what to do and then they say oh i look like such an oddball oh all the rest of the sister dressed a different way all the rest of the brothers go there all the rest of the we do this and we do that amen but you know we're not supposed to look like all this under him above all the people are upon the face of the earth amen how many

say stuff tonight but i said see that guy long hair that's me and i didn't see the pictures i don't know what he was talking about but i could take you back to some pictures before we were before christ pc hey man that's right amen amen i can take you back some pictures see that woman that's my wife and man that one without the clothes on i mean what would that do well i can't believe you said

when we were down to it in the meetings in virginia i saw a picture of berry coffee shows a picture remember that picture he had a toboggan hat on the cigarette hanging on wow yeah that's me before christ that's [Applause] to have as an right they used to possess a now make sure they're all consumed by that hey amen glory you're a chosen generation yeah who got called out of darkness into this marvelous diet which in time passed we're not a people there i walked just like the rest of them in my days he said but now are people of god amen god who had not obtained mercy but now have have obtained mercy thank you jesus dearly beloved i beseech you as strangers and pilgrims to abstain from every fleshly love absolute totally abstained from all the things that used to satisfy the flesh that's right amen because the war against your soul be completely separated from them amen yes okay brother jim what are you trying to say tonight i'm trying to say don't let this stuff that we've been delivered from god has driven it out the holy spirit [Applause] wherefore we receive a kingdom with my word kingdom that basilian what do we see we receive a royal power an authority by god's holy spirit amen we receive a kingdom which cannot be moved this word yet once more signifies the moving of those they are removing those things which can be shaken we've received a word amen that anchors a rock a revelation of the word that cannot be moved hallelujah we reserve a kingdom which cannot be moved let us have mercy let us have grace whereby we may serve god acceptably with reverence and godly fear for our god is a consuming fire hallelujah paul tells us that that fire amen we are to present our bodies a living sacrifice the fire is to consume that sacrifice and then every bit of it in there not just leave part of it out but when that fire fell he'd been there on that day with elijah hey man there wasn't any of it left right that's right i don't want any of it left in my life i don't want any of it yeah we have to have that fire and consume every bit of that sin that we have held so dear to you why brother jim because the word of god says in the second peter 2 4 god spared not the angels that sin or disbelieved the word but he cast them down into hell and delivered them into chains of darkness to be reserved unto judgment and spirit not the old world but saved noah to eight persons in the eighth person a preacher of righteousness what did he preach he was preaching the word amen that's the guy he saved in him he said bringing in the flood upon the world of the ungodly but he saved the righteousness amen amen and he turned the city of the sodom agora into ashes and condemned them and overthrew with an overthrow making them an example unto those who after should live ungodly that's right he come down a war to me man if they wouldn't heed the war that they turned here say that you refused not him that spoke in this day amen right right they've been given for an example that we shouldn't do the same thing amen but he delivered just love that's right that's right thanks for the filthy communications of the wicked aren't you glad that he can deliver the righteous tonight thank god we have a god that can deliver the righteousness glory for the righteous man for the righteous man dwelling among them seeing and hearing he vexed his righteous soul from day to day with with their unlawful deeds and the lord knoweth how to deliver the godly amen amen [Applause] separate yourself from come out from among them amen don't touch the unclean thing praise god amen i thank god that he knows how to preserve the god aren't you glad he can preserve you tonight amen amen but god who is rich in mercy for the great love wherewith he loved us even when we were dead in sin when we were dead in our sins he has quickened us amen amen with christ by grace he saved us out of that amen and in my grace he spoke to my heart it says come out of that place i was satisfied down in a denominational church no i was never satisfied that's why i'm in the message but i was satisfied so to speak and then down to the confirmation church but god knew how to deliver god began to speak god began to talk to me i mean he began to pull me a minute he quickened that little cg down in my heart one day i heard that voice of that eagle scream and i said get up and get out of that mess amen amen god who's rich in mercy whereas he loved us even we were dead in our sins quickly together by grace i was saved and has raised us up together and made

the thing of the world the love of god isn't even in you he says is that true amen the church said right then you see you can't mix it he said you can't mix oil with water same thing he says he said oh you can turn it up and down and you can shake it all up he said you could say oh look i mix it up he said but it'll all settle out it'll suffer if it's real it'll separate he said it will not mix he said then your character will not mix if you're a godly son of god it will not make the world [Music] we see these little things trying to creep back in and man you know the first thing i want to do smack that thing oh god hold me back even like we said this morning and don't let that thing creep back in hallelujah the problem that people want to say i believe the message and i want to look like the word it doesn't work it doesn't work like that preach a message here a few weeks ago on testimony he said brother branham says you are your life will out will will out shadow or overshadow your testimony you say all day long i'm a son of god i'm a daughter of god but if you live like the world or the things of the world or in your life and then guess what and then your testimony means nothing amen amen your life is so loud i can't hear what you're testing on me to say that's right brother that's right move out get those things moved out of your life brother branson move out some people want to apply the blood and stay in you apply the blood and kick all the trash out of the house you can't allow one little bit because it spreads it begins to multiply when you do kick all the trash out of the house he said have a house cleaning he says you women take off them shorts you men throw out those cigarettes you women amen get all this old stuff of your old world system out of you all the things that used to satisfy the lust of the flesh when you were in the world he said it has got to be you can't have one escape that's right you know it's the truth i don't i don't have it with you right now but i had a piece of paper at the church just to show you what it is everything has to be not one not one those sins escape but i had a piece of paper at church and it was a pure white piece of paper about like that little jesse and i do a round black circle right in the middle and i held that paper up and i said what do you all see here you know what everybody said a black remark not one person said oh i see a beautiful sheet of white paper you know what because we're barred by that one [Music] that's what they saw and that's what jesus sees with he don't see all our righteousness his filthy rags he sees the one black mark he said therefore totally abstain from all the love [Applause] he said you can't mix it he said move out people want to live and apply the blood and stay and stay in he said apply the blood and kick all that stuff out get that old stuff out of your system of the world if you love the world of things the world because the love of god's not in you when you're ready to apply the token empty up and get ready for it he says you can't serve god and mammon at the same time hallelujah well you're ready for the holy ghost to be there that you can call on and it'll deliver you from all the sin the power of god in your life you take emptying out to do it amen amen then god's holy spirit will come down he'll he'll [Music] amen it's always been the idea of man all the way down the road brother branham said how long have i been preaching i don't know keep going brother it's always been a idea of man all the way down the road command to try to sin and live in earth at the same time and be in heaven at the same time i can't do it good question can't do jesus said you can't serve god in them this is an end sign amen preaching 1962 if it matters to anybody and then it doesn't matter to me prophet he's a prophet i know there's a progressive right i'm not going to get involved that's the reason we believe in total abstaining from sin amen been totally abstaining man you've been totally abstained from sin is that what he said yes you don't have to take my word for it he said dearly beloved i beseech you straight through pilgrim abstain from the freshly lust that war against your soul said that's why we believe in total abstaining from sin that's right get away from it why he says because it's poison amen poison he said there's poison don't fool around with poison yes somebody would fool around with poison if you're silly too to kill you yeah it will cause spiritual death to fool around with these things the sin of the world yes sir don't fool around with don't tolerate it at all have nothing at all to do with it don't see how close you can come to it amen without sinning remember brother man told that story about the man who was gonna head to head to have somebody take him over the mountain in the carriage he said i need somebody to take me over the mountain he said the real dangerous spot he says how close can you get to that the first guy said i i've been driving by here my six head of horses past that spot and he said and come within six inches of it and still get you there safe well that guy's a good driver he says the next guy how close can you get brother brother bank says well i can get you within three inches now but i can drive better than that guy i said jesse how close can you get me to it jesse so i'll tell you what brother they're a whole lot better i stay just as far away from it as i can get to make sure i make it home safe hey man then you fall over his depth he says stay away from that poison spot and see it [Applause] [Music] yes stay far away from anything even look simple stay what but don't have anything to do with it at all hey man amen but you know in this day and age we're living in people start to you know start to creep back in because everybody's doing it and it just starts to be accepted it just dips in so mentioned this and i preached a message one time years ago at the old church and i remember that day that beth come crying for her yes and i got to meet her sister that's right hallelujah amen but over in ezekiel the ninth chapter when we were using that scripture to preach out that uh there was a man who was the angel told a guard he was a white or whether he had a white vest or something to go with an acorn to mark all those decide and cry for the abomination amen he told the destroying no matter how much members there was how many things that they had done he said put a mark on that with the ink horn hey man let me get this right so i make sure i get it right he said he still he's he told the ceiling angel indeed till nine he said take and go through the city set a mark upon those who sigh and cry for the abomination of city he said the rest of them he said let the destroying angel destroy that's right let the destroying angel destroy them what was that ezekiel it was those that hated that sin that was going on and see if they were sighing and crying they hated that thing about everything else oh god why do you let that thing there oh god take that sin out if they didn't want to see that sin there yes hallelujah they didn't want to see that there i mean that's the way a true believer they don't want to see that sin in their life and that's the mark of the holy ghost letting everyone be destroyed amen hallelujah yes lord god hallelujah that represents the holy spirit brother branham says amen when you have that kind of feeling in you he says he come down and put a mark on those that had that spirit in there but the rest he said utterly slay destroy children women babies kill them all little children yes say man that's pretty harsh that's what it does when you don't hate sin it causes death doesn't matter who the ones that everybody does yes everyone's destroyed that's what sin does it shows no mercy amen that's why we can't show any mercy we have to make sure every one of them is put to death that's right all right brother that's right it's just like when joshua entered into the land of canaan from the brother says you don't let one of them live he said it's a cute little baby a little amalekite or a little amorite he says but you know it will grow up to be a big amalgam yeah yeah it'll cause you all kinds of problems in your life oh it's just it's it this little dress looks just so cute yeah but [Applause] just do what's rising do what the word says see that you refused about him that spoke from heaven in our day amen yes it's a little baby of malachi even sometimes it looks so cute right you know what we we've seen this video on youtube or something we were watching that you know they have always feed comes up whatever you watch the next thing will come up it'll have something to do with what you were watching and the next thing you'd come up with rock and roll music and there was a little we were watching little babies and then taking their first taste of a pickle or ice cream or whatever it was i can't remember them they'd make all these funny faces and it was kind of cute we were watching just for fun i guess you would call it the next eighth alone was this little bit he

these little sins oh they look so cute [Applause] amalekite it'll pollute the camp and the little thing come back and then to life and disagree with the word of god get red thing out of the house amen amen amen that's why i don't care i don't care what it is innocent it seems amen what church or denomination it belongs to you say well they're good people that go to that church i don't care how good the people are if they're contrary to the word of god amen get the thing away from you amen [Applause] he said it's a growing little amalekite looks so cute looks so innocent it looks like it's all right but don't you have anything to do with it just stay away from and utterly destroy that thing from your life amen amen you say well brother brown if i go down here you can go where you want he

from it amen how many believes with the truth here hallelujah first of all stay away from that stuff amen yes utterly destroyed amen the sigh and the cry for the abominations that's did in the city where do you see that same type of spirit in the people oh i hate that city where do you see that but rams ask you the question where do you see that in the city so i can show you ten thousand to speak with tongues but where's that one that hates the sin yes yes i can show you i can show you ten thousand that prophesy and it comes to pass he said but where's the one that hates the sins amen how many knows that's the truth that's true he said where's that one that hates the sin that much at first they can't pray for one hour he said he said oh you could he said that's what the holy spirit comes to march the people who said they may go forth and destroy everything that doesn't have that spirit on them that hates the sin if you don't hate cinder amen you're doomed for destruction in me that's right yes now where are those people that are that interested in seeing sin eradicated in their lives that's right i can show you people that jump and cry and run the church and i can show you people that shout and run all over the building i can show you people that prophesied it comes past i can show you those just speaking tongue run up and down the building say things and actually interpret and it comes to pass he said but where's that person that size and cries in their soul for the abomination i hate that thing so bad i want to do everything i can to kill it i don't want one of the little things left in my life hey man he said you see what i mean to see where we're standing that's where we're standing in this hour i get ready to close that's where we stand in this hour you know back in the bible days when the prophet samuel was about to go off the scene how many believes that our prophet prophet's gone off the scene that's right so when samuel was getting ready to go off the scene this is a message called the rejected king the prophet god said this there's a story you go home and read the rest of it brother brown said about the samuel man of god the prophet he was a just man he was a good man he was an honorable man a reputable man a true and honest amen to the people he never deceived them amen how many know we've had a prophet in our day that was the same way he never deceived us that's right he told us the word he told us how he meant to live a good godly christian life and then he spoke to us from heaven amen the bible god the bible tells us cd refused on him to speak it from heaven that's right his honorable reputable too honest never deceived him telling them nothing but thus straight thus saith the lord he had the word of god for the people in that day how many believe that our prophet had the word of god for us yes hallelujah amen but listen history tends to repeat itself yes he said but the people had come to a place where they wanted to change the program they looked upon the philistines and the amorites and the amalekites and the hittites and all the other nations of the world i'd say they looked at brother so-and-so's church and his brother so-and-so's church and this church over there and the church down the road they looked at all these churches you know what they said these are god i know some of these people they love the lord and they say it's okay they said to us they wanted to change the program i know the prophet said this we want to be like the rest of the world right brother you see that spirit trying to creep back in amongst the bride of jesus christ i'm scared yes the people come to the place where they wanted to change the program they looked at the philistine amrit all these other nations they had seen amen and so forth and they have seen and it seemed to be that israel wanted to pattern themselves like these other people we go to some youth camps and some different meetings and stuff yes and you look around you know what it's an influence that you see creeping into the people you see the way the younger ladies are dressing see the way the young men are dressed and you see the activity in the things they're doing that's right you can't do it church you said it must be utterly destroyed amen he said the people seem like they want to be like all the rest of the people you know i see that spirit trying to create this way back in among believers [Music] god's people has always been a peculiar people different people are called out separated people all together different in their actions i mean in their ways in their manner of living and they're different in their dress and that's what the people of the world has he said and then what the people of the world have been different in every aspect amen their appetites for the things that all that their makeup is has always been contrary to the things of the people that the world that the things the people of the world describe the church the prophet's off the scenes he never told us anything but thus saith the lord amen and if you'll follow that you refuse not him to speak it from heaven guess what amen this word yet once more signifies the removal of all these things amen it'll take away all the things and then all the sin get it out of your life even if you're just listening to that hallelujah how many believes it tonight amen this is a pretty strange message amen for a 10th or 5th 16th anniversary i mean we ought to tell us something we make us run and shout and we get this all down we'll all be right that's right brother amen hallelujah hey revelations amen here's the overcomer here's the bride galatians chapter 12 verse 10 i'm going to close with this scripture brother jesse amen i heard a loud voice saying in heaven now has come salvation strength and the kingdom of our god that there's that holy ghost that power amen to deliver the kingdom of our god and the power of his christ for the accuser of the brethren is cast down which accused them before god day and night amen he's been cast down how many believes he's been cast down aren't you glad he's been cast down in your life today amen gloria how the holy spirit destroyed him amen glory he said and they the bride have overcome him by the blood of the lamb and by the word of their testimony and here's the part and they love not their old fleshly lies there was no pet sin that they loved so much that they created take that out crucify get out of my life amen hey man that's the overcomer that's the bride how many wants to be a part of that tonight amen [Applause] amen see that ye refuse not him that speaketh amen for they for if they refused him that's faith on earth how much more shall we escape if we turn our voice or our ears away from him that is much more spoken from heaven and told us [Music] other than the word of god i don't want to be ruled by nothing but that's right i want god's word to come in and purify and deliver and to keep me keep me clean lord god amen hold me back from those presumptions and let the holy spirit come in amen and deliver me from every one of them
