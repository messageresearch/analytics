four i'd like to continue on this series here by god's grace i think it's part 14. good to see the blands as well by god's grace glad you guys had a good christmas johnny just said they had a great christmas sounds a lot like our christmas brother it was great christmas my god's great so restful and uh got to read the scriptures and sing the songs and everybody got their presents so they were real happy and i like my presence i really liked like hopefully you all like your presence as well what a great time of the year you know just to slow down and think about the lord and remember that the greatest gift we could possibly get is jesus christ and his holy spirit today praise god uh let's read philippians four i believe we're looking at verses uh seven eight and nine this morning we'll try to get through those i just love preaching through books of the bible i just think it's so glorious and you know sometimes we forget that this was this is thus saith the lord this is this wasn't to be something to take it lightly each and every words if we're resting on what paul said then we need to know what paul said praise god so uh philippians 4 let's read uh 6 7 8. let me read 6-7 and then as a church we'll read verse eight together so let me read six and seven be careful for nothing but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known unto god and the peace of god which passeth all understanding shall keep your hearts and minds through christ jesus let's read verse eight together one two three finally brethren whatsoever things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure whatsoever things are lovely whatsoever things are of good report if there be any virtue and if there be any praise think on those things praise god may god has blessings reading his word you may be seated praise god uh so by god's grace i'd like to uh share just a few quick things here uh can you switch over here i got some slides and uh notes i'd like to show as we get going here just give me a moment uh everybody had a great christmas in the lord brother jose how was your christmas brothers you guys have a good time in the lord okay a little bit okay amen bro oh that's right brother yes sir i'm so sorry brother yes i'm so sorry yes sir amen yes sir yes sir thank the lord for that yes sir i appreciate that amen brother praise god hallelujah thank the lord jesus i'd like to uh let me see if this will help out a little bit with that um i'd like to just do a few quick updates here by god's grace uh just want to let everybody know i adjusted the calendar a little bit for january i don't know if you saw that i had brother brian hawkins coming out but i asked him to come back a little later with wendy leaving it impacts our church finances a little bit so i just want to take a few months and i'll just preach for the next few months by god's grace i'm going to reschedule brother brian probably from march or something like that plus every time we try to have a minister in january february with all the snow you know it's just it's like there's always a question like and then it seems always snow at that time you know anyways just so you know i i did take the guest ministers off the calendar we'll take a few months and save up a little bit on finances and uh we got to get adjusted to having less finance right just like the family right sometimes can all the dads in it and mom say hey man you know sometimes uh finances aren't as easy as we like them to be and so i see the same thing in the church but we're so grateful to be here and i got to see the landlord you know this week and she was she's like we appreciate your loyalty and she said we just love you guys and i said well thank you we love her too you know uh so we're just grateful so just you know i did adjust the schedule there and also i wanted to show this too i did have uh i do have a new website i'm building here and it's not all it's my personal website okay so uh my the point of it is to defend jesus's message and his messenger you know this year more than ever you know i've been i've been i've been having a battle on both sides the side that wants to get rid of brother branham and the sides that wants to exalt brother branham you know i don't know if you know but i debated the man from believe the sign i debated him back in september uh and then i've been emailing uh and writing joseph branham and billy paul all year off and on all year and uh just feeling like the lord to do that right uh so i've just noticed this year in 2020 you know all the things about 2020 and the right vision you know i just felt like it was just such an important thing to do and i i'm building this website now um to defend you know just to put all that in one place just like they have their believe the sign just like they got and i'm sure other people have like a defend brother branham message website they might i i haven't been there if they have but i just want to build my own and i want to put it on there so just so you know i started doing that uh you know with the scriptures i got a little intro video on there i'm just building it slowly i got links to the books on there so got some testimonies on there so i just want to let you know i'm i'm building that and i want to be a place where i can put all of our videos and not have to worry about youtube you know shadow banning any of my videos or i don't know if they do but we know they censure things that are against their narrative right so i just want to have a place where everything can go where there's nothing hindering it as far as i know um so that's a little update there by god's grace and also you know this week i put out the uh or last week i put out the new video i did on is joseph branham of profit that's been pretty popular but i've got a lot of feedback on that one good and bad uh but i shared it with joseph and billy paul but they never emailed me back so i said okay well uh i uh shared it then uh live and um i'll share a few things at the end i've gotten some pretty intense feedback good and bad on that but just just just uh i just feel led of the holy spirit to do that i haven't done that because it's been easy it has not been easy i've had to pray and fast and this some of these videos have taken me months to do because i want to say exactly the truth and i want to say exactly i want to say it with the love of jesus christ and the thing is church you know both of these sides they're influencing millions of people but there's god i want to i want to be a voice in the midst of it that it's not that extreme it's not that extreme it's right down the middle of the road and so i just i fee that's what i feel led to do and brother man was the same way right he sent tapes out he sent his tapes out he was careful about you know pastors and who it was influencing but they went out anyway brother neville had a radio program every saturday he was on the radio preaching and teaching going out to whosoever will right right and brother adam said i love that he said he and his family listened to it every saturday morning it was just going out right it was going out it wasn't well just you know only pastors can listen to that so we want to just use the wisdom of the holy spirit and we want to get the word of god out and it's a it's been witness to me over and over again people need it and i know this god will direct his word to all the hungry hearted believers that i know because the elect will not be deceived and god ordains everything the footsteps of the righteous are order the lord and i want to be a voice for the truth of god's word amen so let's just look at this thought here uh and lord willing this evening i'll be preaching on music again uh i know it's been a big stir in in around ohio in the last few years i'm not sure if you're familiar with that but i'm just uh yeah i just i've heard about i've i haven't talked to anybody about it because i'm just kind of my own world over here you know trying to support my family run the church preach the gospel um and i haven't even listened to the sermons i haven't listened anything but i've just been feeling led to preach on that but just so you know with amen amen's been doing a great job as our song leader last few years i think the last one two three years just every every sunday faithfully but we had two adults come up to me brother last sunday they were visitors and they said brother jesse i just want to tell you you have such a freedom of the holy spirit in your worship visitors brother they said they said we feel so free and brother when they're telling me that they got these big huge smiles on their faces they're like brother the music is so great here and thank you for the freedom and liberty that we feel i said well thank the lord and thank god for both amen and malachi and lydia i don't want to leave anybody out you know and everybody's singing right everybody clapping i just want to encourage you people can feel the difference they can feel when people are bound but they can feel when people are free too i always feel free praise god so i thank the lord for that church we are to live free from anxiety it's done through prayer and thanksgiving anybody had any anxiety over christmas hopefully not uh but if you did you know this is the way to get rid of it come to the house of god and pray amen prayer the paul says prayer is the key to being relieved from all of our stresses and anxieties and it's not just any prayer it's prayer with thanksgiving so we have to choose to be thankful and remember the man writing this is locked in prison at the current time and he's not a hypocrite he's not writing something that he doesn't know about right we ended the last part 13 with that if they understood here's a man in prison and he can only write about what he's experiencing himself praise god and so in other words he knew how to worship he knew how to give thanks he knew how to give praise in the midst of difficult times amen and so he says don't be anxious for anything but in every aspect of our lives we must give thanks with thanksgiving to god and make known your requests to god tell god all about it right when you pray pour out your heart before the lord you know don't say anything foolish you know like sometimes we do say lord forgive me he'll forgive you he forgave job's wife right she she said curse god and i said you talk like a foolish woman well later she had all those kids she had more kids later on and we're not told job got a second wife or anything so god is merciful how many times did david complain right in the psalms where are you lord don't you hear my cry you know job said the same thing i cursed the day i was born you know believers we're human sometimes we get in the flesh right but god gives us grace and we're to pour out our hearts to the lord and he'll correct us when we're wrong but i'll say like this will also correct us to think the right thing next time and so we must be uh be understanding and aware that god wants to hear our request god wants to hear our burdens right uh but we've got to do it with uh thankfulness we gotta part our hearts and yet be thankful to know that god has blessed us he's helped us and he's gonna help us in the future uh and we must have a grateful heart now the bible says i'm sorry the lexicon says the word careful means anxious or troubled so when we feel troubled when we feel anxious or stressed prayer with thanksgiving is going to relieve that uh thankful prayers uh and requested god move on your behalf brings you peace even though you're content if he doesn't praise god because church we have enough wisdom we have enough understanding to know god will do what's best for us right god doesn't need our plan god doesn't need our thinking to figure something out right he doesn't need so as long as we can express lord this is what i like to happen as long as we can express that then we should be happy in that and not have to tell god what to do how to do it when to do it but just trust that he'll do what's best for me see so it's just about in other words it's about letting off the pressure there it is right there it's about letting up the pressure all these requests let off the pressure make them known to god and then the peace of god will overcome you so it's through thankful prayer so it's the right kind of prayer right there might be parts of our prayer that are weeping and desperate right or maybe upset or discouraged but hopefully by the end of the prayer hopefully by the end you can give thanks and say lord thank you for this little time i had to prayer thank you for this opportunity to i could get on my knees or thank you for this opportunity i could express myself to you lord god we should end the prayer with thanksgiving and the bible says the peace of god will overcome all our anxiety and trouble so what's greater is stress greater or is god's peace greater praise god right which one's greater is is the pressures in your life harder or is the peace of god stronger than that amen the peace of god is able church to overcome all anxiety all stress all difficulties all the problems the peace of god is able to keep you and oh and help you overcome all that it'll be a victory in your life the peace of god is so much greater so much stronger praise god and it's just waiting there for you if you'll express your heart to god and then receive his love and peace amen hallelujah now here's what i want to just get back to a thought i preached last year and i'm going to reference the sermon a little bit how many know the bible said it's good to stir up your minds by remembrance new things throw up your minds like last week we heard a new sermon about the five virgins wasn't that awesome uh zellofed i forget exactly how to say that i was thanking the lord for that this week i was like what a god gave cam a great revelation on the old testament the the five daughters of zelo fadad that's it's a perfect type to the five virgins uh in jesus parable oh my i've never heard that before so i would shout and rejoice and you know church i shouted too much and i told myself i'm going to take it easy on my throat today because i just shot and here i am going loud again so i just forget about it once i get with god's people you know worshiping and praising boy anyhow so uh you know we rejoice in the new revelations but the bible actually says peter says it god will stir you up by helping you remember something i love new things and jesus said i'm going to his minister is going to bring out treasures new and old right so god gave us a new one last week but i'm going to bring some old ones today hopefully there'll be some new ones in here too maybe it's new for somebody but uh so god wants to stir and that means to make active right to stir it back up to move everything around your life is gonna be become moved around you're gonna feel like you're walking the things of god when god brings a certain memory to mind god loves to do that jesus said the holy ghost will bring all things to your remembrance amen that's right so uh the bible says peace will keep your heart now what does keep mean like keep in your pocket well it's kinda it means to guard and to keep with a garrison which is a military outpost so the peace of god is a military outpost protecting you from being invaded hallelujah sounds like we're in a war or something church sounds like somebody's trying to attack you or something that is you must have the full armor of god on amen you are in a constant battle praise god but what's going to what's going to keep you the peace of god is going to guard your emotions your heart your mind your thinking right it's going to keep you from being besieged and overtaken and lose your testimony or the fruits of the spirit or the joy of your salvation right like jesus in matthew 12 he said you're like a house and you you got to keep out all the devils right if you don't keep the devils out they're going to spoil your house so what is going to keep you from being invaded or overtaken and besieged and overwhelmed the peace of god is gonna guard you like a garrison peace is gonna be like a garrison for you praise god now this reminded me remember this scripture church from proverbs 4 my son attend to my words is malcolm listen where's my son oh you just stepped out i was going to use that as a good example here let's just say malcolm look at me where's zion zion look at me buddy he's only four months though he can't look at me he said attend to my words so incline thine ear unto my saying so really give me your attention children really give your parents your attention let them not depart from thine eyes keep them in the midst of thine heart don't put something else at the center of your heart keep the words of your parents at the centers of your heart and how about you spiritual children too because i ain't just preaching to the kids now i'm preaching all of us children of god right here like me keep god's word at the center of your heart don't give something else first place keep god's word at the center he says for they are life unto those that find them so you got to find them you got to go searching right and health to all their flesh the word of god right keep thy heart with all diligence for out of it are the issues of life praise god how many know that if they if they keep their heart in the right condition they have better health praise god if you say positive about the word i'm not i'm just not talking about positive thinking like today's gonna be a good day today's gonna be good no today's a good day because the holy ghost is with me praise god anybody say this gonna be a better day it's gonna be a better day it's gonna be better anybody can say that but when we speak the positive word with faith in obedience to the word then our bodies benefit our families benefit we benefit everybody benefits amen because out of the word issues life amen so the writer solomon says keep your heart and minds the peace of god keeps it or or guards it now notice we're told solomon says you guard it meaning you have a choice to offer things thankful prayers are not so it's your choice uh how much protection do you want so this is what the question comes down to with prayer how much protection do you how long should i pray well as much protection as you need right i mean it's a guard your prayers your thankful prayers right being thankful and speaking god's word and you know being positive and praying that that that's so important and it will determine how much protection you have amen in other words you'll be able to overcome the enemy longer the more you pray remember you can pray without ceasing moms and dads that are busy so i got up at five to study this morning at 6 50 one of my little one comes in and i went you know usually i want three or four hours of quietness to study you know and then at 7 20 another one rolls in and pretty soon you know no more study i'll get up early and i yeah you know how it is with the kids you know you love your children but you know how it is how much how much protection do we need we need a lot by god's grace so we can pray you know it's up to us you keep it you and i can keep our hearts and minds but we got to be diligent about it we got to make sure we're praying throughout the day we've got to make sure we pray before we make that video or pray before we post that or or pray before we call that person or pray before we text that person we've got to keep our hearts and minds clear by god's grace and notice it's going to take diligence remember peter said that he said the stature of a perfect man he said give all diligence to make your calling an election sure so see it takes the human effort right and how much effort's required jesus said all of it how much effort do i need to give bro jesse all of it he said love the lord your god with some of your heart some of your strength and some of your soul some of your mind that's a mystique in the scripture he said give god all your strength amen give god all your heart praise god give god all your love it's going to take all your human ability praise god but the amount of the amount of effort we put into it determines how far the devil's kept off right now except in situations where we're tested like job and i listen to a servant about job this week it was a good message from a brother down in north carolina boy was it a great message my if you want it i'll share with you so let me know but i'm going to forget about it now but anyways the point was god looked at god looked at job and knew what satan was doing he's just walking around the earth you know and he said have you considered my servant job he's such a man of integrity praise god he's such a man of honesty and such a godly example have you considered him what a man he is hallelujah amen god likes to see his children overcome the test amen amen so in most cases your amount of effort in your prayer life whether it's in the morning throughout the day while you're washing dishes while you're mopping the floor whatever you're doing your devotion to prayer is going to keep the enemy off longer and so we've got to be devoted to that i've seen it have you seen it i've seen it i've had beautiful times of study and then i'll go into work and it's just a madhouse it seems like the kids it must have been a full moon they say brother bang right sometimes they say in a full moon people act crazy and i'll just have a crazy day at work but some days i'll be able to handle it okay other days if i didn't pray or if my mind's in the wrong spot or if i let something get to me i don't handle it as well and i whispered under my tongue like lord have mercy how can i help me to get through this you what's that oh yeah i gotta i gotta keep myself from complaining praise god but the bible shows us though here clearly the peace of god is gonna keep us and we've got to keep our the peace of god with all diligence so we've got to be more diligent in prayer and i'm talking to everybody me too because who can answer uh do the floods come in easier each time or do the floods come in harder each time they come in harder right so in other words it's not going to get easier to be a christian it's going to get harder because when the enemy comes in like a flood god has to raise the standard against it praise god amen so our battles are not going to get easier they're going to become more challenging and so we've got to be more devoted to prayer in 2021 can you imagine that we've got to be more devoted to prayer in 2021 than 2020. with all the riots the political turmoil the death the virus all these things the nowhere's the jobs and all these things all the financial stress all these things we've got to be more devoted we got to ask god to help us to be more diligent this year i mean the next year right that's why i'm already into 2021 already in my mind he says you keep it you see because you have a part in it right god's not going to force anybody to be a believer we have a part in it we've got to be more diligent to set up the garrisons in our mind what is the keep in the hebrew to guard regard so you guard it you guard your heart and emotions with all diligent behavior in other words be more on guard to make sure you say the right thing do the right thing and you keep all the pressures off you amen you'll be more on guard i need to be more on guard so i just put at the top this means pray diligently with thankfulness so be thankful all the time in our prayers amen then the peace from prayer keeps or guards your hearts and minds that's why the bible said in everything give thanks for this is the will of god in christ jesus see in everything because prayers with thanksgiving produce this protection right prayers with thanksgiving produce a garrison they produce a shield amen they produce a protection they produce power amen they produce a safety guard amen they produce protection for you and i when we are constantly thankful for what we have and what god has done when we're constantly thankful we are protected and we're safe glory now here's the quote i brought back him we speak of him this morning father we pray that you'll bless our hearts let his spirit move among us and bless us enrich our experience i don't want to get uh i don't want to experience as a christian as a dull experience i want to be more rich i don't want to be more pretend i want to be a reality praise god i want to be enriched he says and heal the sickness in our midst and give us overcoming grace and god as i go out yonder in the field to face the foe may i realize that i'm garrisoned every hour by prayer oh how i depend on my own wisdom oh how i depend on my tapes although we thank god for tapes right oh how i depend on brother neville his pastor no i depend on the garrison of prayer the enemy approaching but i know that the garrison holds because mothers fathers and boys and girls christians born again with the experience heaven-bound people is on their knees praying oh god give deliverance amen in other words i'm depending on the prayers of the saints praise god i'm depending on people uh seeking your favor i'm depending on people seeking first the kingdom of god and father we pray yo let us get out into the enemy's lines out yonder look at this he talked about battle he said i i need garrisons and then i pray that we'll go out and possess the gates of our enemies amen amen praise god he says and conquer every precious soul that's waiting praise god that's what i feel like i feel like there's souls waiting out there that i need to go rescue amen and god uses youtube and you know god uses a live stream right we've seen that we had a brother get baptized a few months ago just saw one of our videos got baptized amen i haven't heard from him lately but hopefully you'll find a good church uh he said he's busy working sundays he's down in newark ohio but you know god like we said if somebody's hungry god's gonna send him the word he said bring the line of darkness in the light for we ask you in jesus name amen so as a prophet he was depending on the garrisons of people's prayers what's a garrison it's a military outpost where you watch to make sure the enemy's not trying to do a sneak attack on you right it's one of those outposts let me see did i get that on here i tried to get it on there let's see if it updated oh it did okay now we'll get to this in just a minute i tell you that technology is pretty sharp there i saved it on my ipad and updated on my iphone without me knowing it now this is of course israel there's jerusalem and everything now david eventually builds because he's such a mighty conqueror as a type of christ he eventually builds his uh ghost here the tsarnaev peninsula there's egypt you know he is the territory and the the amazing part is he expands it all the way up to the euphrates praise god so he expands it further than than the king had done before but before saul had done he expanded the territory through garrisons amen praise god how many want expanded spiritual territory amen the time i went in natural territory because we had a tenth of an acre at our old house and i was like .10 acres i got four kids we need some more territory so now we got three quarters of an acre and i'm happy with that that's enough to mow for me but i'm not this morning i'm not talking about natural territory i'm talking about spiritual territory we need spiritual territory in other words we need god's forces to expand what we possess amen we need more uh protection to stay means praise god another we need a bigger buffer how many thankful for your buffer on your car your bumper your buffer bumper i'm thankful for that you ever got a fender bender oh thank god for that bumper that was there i've been thankful for that uh so we we need this protection and the and the the the the symbolism brother bran gives is that if i'm going out to battle the enemy it's the garrisons of people's prayers that's going to protect me in other words when brother ben goes out this is a spiritual territory well enemies are going to try to get in and get to brother branham now jerusalem is the capital so let's say brother ran into the capital so he has this protection that the devils are not going to be able to deceive him the devils are not going to be able to make him sick the devils are not going to uh steal souls away right or mislead souls as long as people are praying amen as long as they're doing their part in the battle as long as the soldiers are staying at their post of duty and their garrisons souls will be one praise god the kingdom of god will move forward as long as everybody's praying at their post of duty god's servants will be god's servants that are public servants will be able to be victorious as long as the private servants are doing their job do now don't get me wrong the public servants need to pray too that's where i get a lot of trouble these preachers get real comfortable i got a balance too every preacher's got a battle right we get comfortable we stop praying we stop seeking the lord well we saw what happens with uzziah right he was prosperous as long as he sought the lord at the end of his life he stopped seeking for the wisdom of god he thought he could do it all by himself happens a lot of preachers today they stopped really seeking for more revelation just preach the same old thing over and over and people know too i mean you can tell right you can tell hallelujah but see we got to keep our face before god but brother branham's territory brother i was going to be saved as long as the saints kept their garrisons as long as everybody did their part let me go back see i preached this back here's the screenshot i preach it back on september 15 2019 i preach garrison by prayer remember that one ah maybe somebody does it even there's a pm service you know evening service so remember a garrison is a station it's a place where somebody stands it's a a military or a fortified post and remember jonathan in this story in first uh samuel 13 we're not going to read there but jonathan actually possessed one of the philistines garrisons because he and a friend went up against it and i want to just remind you that uh overtaking and taking the enemy's land is an uphill battle in other words we're not going to get spiritual victories with the weak behavior or weak effort you can look we're not going to read the scripture but before he goes there he says lord we're going to call over to these philistines and and if they say you know come up we'll come up and that'll be our sign to get the victory but it was an uphill battle church how many once your loved one saved i want to see your children fill with the holy ghost i'm going to see i mean if we want these victories we got to be ready for an uphill battle praise god we can't be discouraged right we can't be discouraged on the way up because once jonathan got up there brother sister oh my he and his worker they knocked down about 20 those boys and then saul looks out and said who's out there fighting did he eat my honey or i might be mixing up the stories but anyways he was upset about it i can't quite remember it's one of those stories but he was all upset who's that guy out there who who's knocking over the philistines you know because he wanted he won the glory for himself you know but jonathan didn't go by his own leading he went by the ephod he went by the word praise god because the ephod had the urban thunderball in it praise god and that's what we need to do church whenever we go to get a victory whenever we try to possess uh grounds we gotta make sure the ephod goes with us amen make sure we consult the word first amen that's right that's a beautiful story so you gotta take along the word with you you gotta take the priest right the word not a person but the word someone who's got the word you gotta take the word with you and that will direct your victory but it was an uphill battle in other words we can't give up church after a few days how many times we prayed for your your your parents brother amen sister how many times do we pray for your parents same thing man we can't give up praise god it's an uphill battle hallelujah taking ground is not an easy footstep our possession step that's not an easy thing praise god it takes real warriors that are sincere that are keeping their hearts and minds by the peace of god amen see remember i said this earlier uh back in september 2019 garrisons were only built when much land had been possessed israel had to have an altar temple city while remember that and then and only then could the garrisons be established see a prayer life must be established and maintained right especially as our younger children when they've been baptized they've got to and as adults we've got to maintain our garrisons right and hopefully expand them but as a child as a young child that's been baptized they've got to work at building a prayer life praise god you just don't start with the prayer life i mean you got to get saved right you got to get the altar you got to go to the cross and you got to have an experience with god and then if you're going to be a victorious warrior you've got to slowly build up a prayer life daily read your bible daily pray and make sure it's thankful praying you've got to build it up saul got some great victories but he didn't build it further and expand it like david did now that shows you something right there a man or woman after the heart of god they'll get more victories they'll expand their territory praise god they'll grow in the things of god i believe that hallelujah so see a prayer life church we got to establish it and brother iran was trusting on the prayer lives of the people for victory now here's a couple examples let's read uh second samuel eight i got my i forgot my colon in there there's no second samuel 81 don't don't read your bible don't go looking for that read your bible but you won't find second samuel 81 forgive me let's read that there sorry second samuel 8 1-6 and after this it came to pass that david smote the philistines and subdued them and david took methic emma out of the hand of the philistines now look he's possessing the land church right and he smoked moab and measured them with a line casting them down to the ground that's what we need to do cast out anything that exalts itself against the word of god see he's casting it down praise god he's walking in the spirit he's conquering devils amen that's what we need to do church he says and so i'm sorry let me find my spot i lost in verse two there two lines okay uh even with two lines measuring you to put uh to death with one full line to keep alive and so the moabites became david's servants and brought gifts amen verse three david smole also had a deezer the son of rihab king of zoba as he went to recover his border at the river euphrates and david took him a thousand chariots and 700 horsemen and 20 000 footmen and david hoffed all the chariot horses reserved of them for a hundred chariots and when the syrians of damascus came to sakura had to had a deezer king of zoba david slew the syrians two and twenty thousand men twenty two thousand souls then david put garrisons in syria of damascus and the syrians became servants to david and brought gifts and the lord preserved david whither so ever he went praise god that sounds like an easy thing to do to get more land does it sound like david had to be more diligent or less diligent to possess the land i think you know the answer is praise god because the bible said keep your mind and heart with all diligence amen amen right so david had to be extremely diligent he had to be extremely focused and he was able to recover now recover history says they never even had it they were promised this border they were promised the border and joshua won but the bible said they never drove them all out so he recovered the promise that was given to him i believe it was a 400 or 500 years later praise god i think about that all the other generations couldn't accomplish this but david accomplished it by a heart that was after the heart of god amen and church one day there's going to be a bride that accomplishes a prophecy that no other bride has accomplished it's called the meeting in the air amen it's been promised for generations but one of these days amen there's going to be a bread that's after the heart of jesus that accomplishes that prophecy it's not because the other ones weren't born again right because we know brother was born again and paul was born again but they will come in to the right time and season god has a time and season for everything but that ride when she possesses that promise it'll be god's time it'll be god's season it won't be one second too late won't be one second early it'll be right on time praise god and now church david is so victorious because this is before his sin with bathsheba after it after his sin it's just trouble after trouble after trouble but before that sin he was on fire with the holy ghost he was it was victory after victory more possession more and that's what we've got to do we got to stay true to god if we fall short god forgive us but it may not be something that extreme praise god because a born-again person won't do something like that praise god so see we've got to be able to to keep in prayer keep the ephod amen keep consulting the ark of god amen keep consulting the urim and summon and we'll possess more and more promises that's right i read asa this morning this was actually the chapter you know i read one chapter morning and everything and this is actually the chapter i read this morning so it worked out great second chronicles 14. let's go there one time i met a brother named ace and i thought what where'd that name come from and then i read about him in the bible he was a mighty man of god he was kind of like you zai he kind of fell away at the end got a little prideful but you know everybody falls short of god's glory but what a beautiful testimony this man had second chronicles 14. now look at this prayer as a garrison let's go down to verse two uh chronicles 14 2 and ace did that which was good and right in the eyes of the lord wouldn't you like god to say that about you if somebody wrote a book about you wouldn't you like them to say it about you boy she did what was good and what was right in god's sight i love those summaries and he took away the altars of the strange gods and the high places and break down the images and cut down the groves and command of judah to seek the lord god of their fathers and to do the law and the commandment and he took away out of all the cities of judah the high places of the images and the kingdom was quiet before him see look what happens when you start taking over things quiet down pray god gives you peace see the peter is the peace of god passes all understanding amen hallelujah when we get serious and we really fight the enemy with god's word look what happens peace comes upon us oh thank the lord hallelujah there's a new one amen uh six and he built fence cities in judah fences fences for the land had rest and had no war in those years because the lord had given him rest why didn't he have wars because he had been faithful to the word of god and driven back the enemy he'd been dedicated to the things of god and when he's dedicated like that god protects him god gives him a buffer 10-year buffer amen can you imagine i haven't had battle for 10 years no bat no major battles for 10 years because he so served god because he i'll say like this he took care of his private sin right he took care of all the idols praise god he went through his house right and he cleaned out all the trash amen he applied the token is that right he applied the token and because he did that god gave him 10 years no major battles what a what a testimony so what does he do well this time does he just sit back and get drunk or do all kinds of things no he actually starts building he starts building his kingdom he built the fence cities in verse six the land had rescue now verse seven therefore he said to judah let us build these cities and make about them walls and towers gates and bars while the land is yet before us because we have sought the lord our god we have sought him and he has given us rest on every side so they built and prosper amen so see once he got rid of all the sin he started building and establishing his kingdom because there would come a time when he might need to fight and you'll we see it in the next chapter actually he starts he has a battle but see god gave him rest and church that's how we do we'll come through a difficult battle but the time after that is not to get lazy on god the time is to build up our prayer time or build up our fellowship or or build up our understanding of god's word it's not to click less on the bible's videos on our youtube it's to click more on them praise god right it's to build up our spiritual state not just let it loose or whatever we're clicking on see so he had he had to get this uh uh he had this great holy spirit anointing him when he got the victory he said i'm gonna strengthen my kingdom i'm gonna make sure this city strong that city strong i'm going to give them reinforcements i'm going to build this up so we're a strong nation they built and prospered verse 8 and asia had an army of men that bear targets and spears out of judah three hundred thousand and out of benjamin that bear shields and drew bows two hundred and four score thousand all these were mighty men of value valor yeah now in the rest of the chapter a king from ethiopia comes now look at this i love this a king from ethiopia comes and he's he's outnumbering asa and here's a man listen church he's already dedicated to god there's no sin in his life and look how he prays i love this the point i'm trying to be is that if you're really walking with god you'll always be desperate for his presence in other words you'll keep hungering and thirsting for righteousness he's already got peace he's got no enemies he's seeking god all the time he's stronger than he's ever been look at that church and when the enemy comes what's his attitude oh i'm a big i'm big somebody look at his attitude look at verse uh look at verse 11. and asa cried unto the lord his god bibraham tells us we should seek god before desperation comes see that's what asa was doing he was already seeking god before the ethiopian guy came but notice even when he comes look what he gets he gets in that desperation stage and he cries out to god let me read it he said lord it is nothing with thee to help and wither with many or with them that have no power help us o lord our god for we rest on thee and in thy name uh we go against this multitude o lord thou art our god let not man prevail against thee amen hallelujah so he cries out to god so that's what i'm saying when someone's really serving god and and and that they they're protected or they have peace or they've got a hedge about them when an enemy comes they're still desperate for god's presence they still want god close to them in order to get the victory praise god in other words someone that's really serving god that's really on fire they always are desperate for god's presence amen you would think he would have been so relaxed oh my i'm just enjoying my cup runs over i don't need to pray he needed to pray more right he was more desperate for the things of god that's how you know your life is at its best point when you're close to god you're keeping all the sin out all the the sins cleaned out but when trials come you still cry out to god for his presence beautiful what a beautiful testimony ace ahead so see this teaches fortification without obedience is useless right that's what the scripture said the bible said god gave them rest because of their victory but then they built right the the fenced cities they they built the outpost and the in the bible says that uh that that was going to protect them but really it was going to protect him because they were obeying the word of god amen right fortification without obedience is useless remember the story when samuel before saul was king they thought oh my the philistines are against us they said let's go get the ark remember that and the bible said they brought the ark in the camp and everybody shouted right and oh we're going to win now we've got the word and they go out there and they get whipped by the philistines because they were living in disobedience praise god it's the same idea here the only way we ensure victory is if it's god's will right but we must do our part we must keep our hearts diligently amen amen keep your heart with diligence and god will bring you the victory how many want to be victorious god here's your amens amen god you you've got to keep it praise god you got to keep your heart in mind amen keep it with all diligence out of your testimony flows the issue of life that's right praise god so yeah that was the picture there so david expands i just want to show that all the way up to the euphrates remember he he beat 22 000 at damascus 22 000 and then he expands the the garrisons miles and miles away wow if we can just get victories over some of these spirits right we just get victory over that lust devil we just get victory over that that pride devil amen look what a great expansion our influence will be expanded amen we can just get some of these victories praise god but if you got them then you have it already praise god but you still want to expand it for god's glory that's what james prayed right i'll share this at the end i just yesterday i heard a good youtube video man it was awesome so i was like i just went wrote my own prayer i'm like i'm going to quote every promise it's on my mind right now in prayer jabez is like make me more honorable than my brethren and not that we want to be better than other people but in other words we just want to honor god and we want we want people to see in other words we want to honor god in secret that he'll reward us openly that the light of god will shine praise god let's just city let the city on a hill shine because it can't be hidden amen not to be i want to be better than my brother i want to be better that's not the idea the idea is let me be so consecrated that my life can be a testimony and be a witness and that the sinners will have to admit jesus is with me so it's not a competition right it's not a competition see who can get the most rewards in heaven that's the wrong idea wrong idea remember brother braham just like we read in the last quote he got his strength from the prayers of the saints someone said to me long ago you've probably heard this before but man where does this come from how are you able to go meaning after meeting staying under the anointing now he's talking about the anointing of visions right because daniel had one vision he was sick on his head for a week remember that everyone uh everyone's sign made jesus week when the woman touches garments said i see you stand for an hour under that brother brahma said i like to tell you here's where it lays you don't want me to say this but my brother said near gene goad now this brother went away later and became a real real ranked sinner he's the one that got arrested out there in arizona but look see when these people were with brother brown many of them were living a godly life but when program left the scene a lot of them fell away he said that boy don't touch bread or water for days fasting and praying here says pat tyler i don't know about him he may have been a good gentleman hope so this other brother sitting here by him then men lay on their faces without food and water when i'm in a meeting praying for me that's where it comes from if there wasn't something like that i'd go down so why was brother branham able to handle more visions because the people prayed and fasted for him that's men that's behind the curtain the man who prays for strength for a message then that they lay down everything maybe they haven't got the gifts to do these things i'll tell you they got to get to praying fast praise god they might not have a gift to discern but they sure got a gift to pray and fast maybe they haven't got the gifts to do these things but they're putting every effort all diligence but how are you so successful how can you do things other people can't do people are diligent people are diligently praying for me that's okay buddy let me get that one yeah that was a that was not too bad you know some toys are louder than others you know that's actually pretty nice he said they lay down everything he said every effort see diligence and the only way they can do they know is prayer before god and fasting there's where the power lays let someone pray for you hallelujah amen church i can really use your prayers thank you for your prayers i could use them in the future too and i'll pray for you too praise god where's the power lay prayers of the saints the garrisons right the people out there their prayers are standing and protecting you because the bible said some kind only go out by prayer and fasting and the whole multitude sought to touch him for there went virtue out of him and healed them so see this is one brother said visions you know take your strength right so brother man said how can he they said how can you have so many visions well the people are praying for me people are praying for me and remember the power of unity church this is after peter raised that man he said the malteser to them that believe were of one heart and one soul neither said any of them that all of the things which he possessed was his own but they had all things in common and with great power gave the apostles witness of the resurrection of the lord jesus and great grace was upon them all neither was there any among them that lacked for as many as were possessors of lands or houses sold them and brought the peace prices of the things that were sold and laid them down at the apostles feet and distribution was made unto every man according as he had need look at the power of unity here church brother brahm had that unity the brothers were behind him right and so because the brothers were behind him faster than praying for him he was able to pray for the sick and god heal the sick he was able to handle more than what other prophets had handled think about that my goodness more than daniel right more than ezekiel he could handle more because brothers and sisters were laying down their meals so that god could bless the ministry of the prophet right and look god gave god gave them what kind of power when they were in one heart one soul god gave them great power amen what am i saying we want to have great power among us too and we want to be united in the faith praise god so it's going to take unity it's going to take prayer fasting is going to take diligence keeping our minds diligently praying right letting the peace of god protect us protect our church protect our loved ones that's that's up to us right solomon said you keep your heart with all diligence you keep it right you give diligence and uh set that barrier let that barrier peace protect you and your family and your church hallelujah now verse eight so i'm finally off verse seven now i'm gonna go to verse eight he said finally brethren what several things are true whatsoever things are honest whatsoever things are just whatsoever things are pure what sort of things are lovely whatsoever things are of good rapport if there be any virtue if there be any praise think on these things notice again your mind has eight ways to be transformed just choose one of them right there's eight different channels remember eight's the number of new beginnings eternity right uh it's new beginnings it's newness it's uh there's so many great things about the number eight i got a whole list of them so there's eight different things if you meditate on these now remember this is after prayer and this is where satan like satan likes to get in right between these verses right so here's chapter seven pray with thanksgiving and you have the peace of god but then he says now you gotta think on the things of god amen how many know you can have a good prayer right and then shortly after that satan will try to attack you throw your mind off so you had the right prayer but then he kind of got you to think about something else see that's kind of what we're that's our battlefield right that's why we're supposed to be trained soldiers i just think it's so beautiful right after the thank thankful prayers and the peace of god then he says now you've got to keep your mind on the things of god keep your mind on the things of god so you meditate on things that are true honest just pure lovely good report virtuous praiseworthy right now here's what i want to share for this week i'm almost done because i've already preached about an hour just this week in the youtube comments on my joseph video i was called or accused of the following and let me tell you when i read some of these sometimes i get a little attack on me but it's nothing like a in-your-face kind of attack right because it's still just through a screen right but this week just for making that video i was calling a laodicean i was called a feeder of bat droppings i know that's strange but i changed the words to that isn't that just wicked i didn't even respond reply that when i just leave that when i prayed for that guy they said i had a worldly haircut but yet the only way it's breaking the word is if you it's long and uncut where is that in the bible but iran said jesus had hair down to his shoulders but i've got short hair it just shows you how much wisdom people don't have they call me a blasphemer they said i'm doomed i'm doomed because i i don't believe joseph branham's a prophet they say i'm jealous of him i'm not jealous of him i'm happy for him in some ways some ways i'm really sad for him they called me a pitiful human for making that video they called me childish and they told me to shut up but i've learned this church i've learned i can see those the program says if you can't take the knocks of the people he said you need to go back to the cross praise god he told the preachers he said you preachers if you can't handle the knocks of the people you need to go back he said rededicate your walk at the foot of the cross praise god in other words if you can't stand the heat get out of the kitchen you can't fight if you can't handle the heat of the battle get off the battlefield well i'm sorry i ain't retreating praise god i ain't leaving the kitchen i'm on the battlefield for the word of god amen so i just learned to pass it on and you can see my comments you don't have to but so my comments are well dear lord please forgive sally or please forgive gene or whoever it is please forgive them because they don't know what they're saying they rejected the spirit of truth and that's what i do i just try to pray god please pray for them because they have no scriptures to back up their accusations please pray for them so i've learned church that when i and i i feel the attack i feel the attack i've learned when i get those i gotta instantly forgive and i gotta pray and i gotta be thankful i gotta be thankful and i've got to then think about things that are true honest just pure lovely good report virtuous and praiseworthy but church i've learned this the words of a close friend heard a whole lot more than words of strangers now church this is why peter said god has to give you the holy ghost i'm sorry god has to give you broadly kindness before he gives you charity on the stats perfect man breadly kindness is love for your brothers and sisters what's the last thing god gives you before you virtue in the kingdom of god brotherly love so that when you get in the family of god you'll be able to treat the brothers and sisters with kindness even when they call you a devil hallelujah he makes sure before i cap him before i seal that one off that last anointing is he's going to be kind to the people in the family of god i'll say like this those that are temporarily in the family of god right because jesus can brought their names off the book of life that would be awful but that happens sometimes david wrote for it was not an enemy that reproached me then i could abort see it's easy to bear these people you never see him face to face you never see him at any parties or anything like that or fellowships he said neither was it he that hated me that did magnify himself against me then i would have hid myself from him but it was thou a man mine equal my god my acquaintance we took sweet counsel together and walked on the house of god in company where did jesus get his deepest wounds in the house of his friends so church we want to use thankful prayers we want to express our request to god and then after prayer we want to meditate on things that are beautiful right things that are true things that are honest of good report let's stand to our feet can i just close these last few slides here verse 9 he says those things which you have both learned and received and heard and seen in me do and the god of peace shall be with you in other words follow the prophets as the example how many one god be with them amen paul said follow my example that church the amazing thing they hadn't seen him for 11 years and he says those things that you've seen in me or learned from me it's been 11 years can you remember a sermon from 11 years ago brother you might remember a couple these people must have a real good strong anointing on them right before uh commercials and before they they shortened our attention span right he said remember all those things i taught you 11 years earlier but now they've had preaching for 11 years since then he says remember the things i taught you remember what you saw in my life from 11 years ago see there was very few of them that would have if their church was growing like the churches were growing a lot in that time most of them never would have heard is oh i'm sorry most of them would have only heard of his character because he was there in about 50 a.d in other words they saw paul's life church they saw that his mind was constantly on the things of god and he cast down any enemy that was trying to get his mind off anything any time anxiousness tried to take him over and the end of the chapter tells us the anxious things he was anxious about in church he had some real anxious problems he had some real things that you and i might be anxious about like what am i going to eat like what am i going to wear i mean things that we don't we don't battle and yet they noticed some of them were still in the church and they noticed that this man had such a power over these natural things he had such a peace that was protecting him in other words they saw satan couldn't get to him because he was surrounded by garrisons he was surrounded by a hedge hallelujah he was surrounded by the power of god like this man he's like moses pharaoh can't get to him what a what a spiritual uh uh overcomer through what prayer prayer thanking god making you pouring out your heart to god getting letting off the pressure and then meditating on the things of god let's close service with let's close with some thankful prayers can we do that go and stop the lives live stream here some people may need prayer today musicians if you'll come let's let's
