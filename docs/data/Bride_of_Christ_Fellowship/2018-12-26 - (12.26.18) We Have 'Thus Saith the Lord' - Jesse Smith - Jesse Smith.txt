let's take our Bibles this evening by the grace of Lord that's why we sing right for all that he's done for us praise God well I like to look at a little different thought here tonight I've been dealing with the book of Revelation and also numerology but I spent about three hours a day trying to get a sermon on numerology it just didn't come to me I was trying to get all the numbers in the Isaiah 53 and it was just a little bit too much I didn't have enough time I need a little more time so I want to go back to this message I've never preached it here but I preached it down in North Carolina last year I like to preach on we have the say at the Lord so let's go to James 5:10 James 5:10 so I want to basically preach all these thus saith the Lord's that brother Branham has given us to kind of help us remember the power of thus saith the Lord praise God and also all that we have and as you'll see what the Prophet said when we have thus saith the Lord it should take away all of our fears all of our all of our questions thus says the Lord should just clear everything up we should be able to stand on God's eternal Word amen we all need it by God's grace amen so so often we forget so james 5:10 there was 3247 thus saith the lord that i went through on this study so quite a few and this was a wonderful study that the Lord gave me numerous years ago I don't think I've ever preached it here so I like to preach it by the grace of Lord tonight then Lord willing this weekend get back to numerology or the book of Revelation or where whatever God would have us to continue on by his grace James 5:10 if you're there say Amen now here's how you know a prophet a prophet will speak in the name of the Lord so let's read this together let's read verse 10 together on three one two three take my brethren the prophets who have spoken in the name of the Lord for an example of suffering affliction and of patience let's read one more let's go to Hagee i chapter 1 verse 13 Hagee i 1:13 how many know that brother Branham brought God's message it was his message to bring by the Rams to preach but it was actually God's message how many know that brother Ram did not think this up and thinking well I like to preach something new this is all for me he never said that it was always God's messenger preaching God's message and that's how we know thus saith the LORD is not from brother Branham it's actually from the Lord here's a beautiful scripture that says it plainly this is how prophets preached a message they must get it from God first Hebrews 1:13 then spake Haggai the Lord's messenger in the Lord's message unto the people saying I am with you say it the Lord are you glad he's with you tonight if God ever sends a message to people he's always letting them know I'm with you alright let's bow our heads for a word of Prayer we know we know Hebrews 13 says the Lord says I will never leave you nor forsake you so we know we have at least two witnesses the Lord is with us here tonight let's bow our heads and church remember he's walking him he's the Bible said he's walking and in the myths of the seven golden candlesticks which is a seven Church ages he's with us here tonight Heavenly Father we bow our heads we just come again Lori read your Lord our title is we have thus saith the Lord and we're grateful for that we recognize that it's your message dear God and father we just want to rehearse these things to our hearts in our minds Lord Jesus and we'd ask O God that they would make us rock solid Lord they would remind us of our rock foundation Lord God and father they would take away any doubts or any confusion any misunderstanding any fear lord or any drifting eyes Lord God that they would just bring us right back Lord to your word and your foundation that we need for surely we want to build our lives upon an unfailing rock Lord a solid rock we don't want it we want to be solid we don't want to be shifting we want to be Lord upon your Eternal Word so bless us now in your divine presence break this word to your people in Jesus Christ's name the church said Amen god bless you mean seated praise God so let's look at this thought here like I said I I never finished it you know I appreciate last last year last year at at North Carolina but I never really got to finish it so I like to preach it here tonight and rehearse some of these things to you by the grace of the Lord now let me read a few things here I'm gonna be reading a lot of quotes tonight now often often I'll put them up here but I didn't have a chance to put them all on individual slides and you know maximize the words or anything like that they're all really small even on my screen here so I'm just going to read off from here by God's grace now bro Ram tells us based upon Matthew 16 where Jesus said flesh and blood hath not revealed it but my father hath revealed it and upon this rock of Revelation I'll build my church the Prophet says the church is built on Revelation on thus saith the Lord anything that God makes known to you that is his will is a revelation how many know that well Graham said he said no revelation is God making his will known to you so when you know it's God's will for you to do something now you have a revelation of God's will and now you have something that you can build your life upon you can build it upon thus sayeth the Lord now program says this in 1956 he says say I feel religious I really do oh it's wonderful to serve the Lord and no it's thus saith the Lord takes all the Scarecrow's out and the spooks out and puts the Holy Spirit in there and lives with you with the Dove of meekness and quietness and eternal hope in your heart he said it takes all the guests out and all the hocus-pocus out and all the formalism out of your heart and puts a real nose so in there and a faith that's everlasting true amen he said that's true so I hope you heard that there he said it takes all the Scarecrow's out right remember scarecrows are set up to scare away the birds but if there's a scarecrow there must be something real after that right so if the devil is trying to put a scarecrow where you're not sure about something you got to remember there's something real there like that we know the Bible said there's a deep call to the deep praise God if you've got a deep desire for something from God in your heart and Satan puts a scarecrow there just remember that that thus saith the Lord will take you past that scarecrow and it'll take you to the the possession or or the your inheritance that God wants to give you praise God that's right so the said the Lord takes out the scarecrow the spooks and it gives you the Dove of meekness and quietness and eternal hope it takes the guessing out all the hocus-pocus all the formalism and puts a real no-show in there and a faith that's everlasting amen what a confidence that we have when God gives us thus saith the Lord there's no more guessing there's no more wondering about it there's no more questions we have exactly God's Word we know exactly what God wants us to do amen but Rahab said he was talking about how he was preaching this a new quote brother Ram because he had thus saith the Lord he said he said now you see why I'm hampering the way I do I got thus saith the Lord a church have you ever hammered how many hammering in a nail recently most of time I don't use hammers I use screws the power screw right so that's a lot easier than hammering it but the it's been a while since I used to hammer but I have you know I guess in the last year or so we've hammered different things but brother ham says as a Christian you're hammering away at something you're trying to you know drive a nail right you're trying to make something stick to something you're trying to make something solid right you don't want something that's flimsy that'll fall apart and brother says what what gives him strength to keep hammering away is that he has thus saith the Lord in other words he knows what God wants done with his life that's why he can just keep hammering away he can keep pressing on and church isn't that how you can keep pressing on you're not wondering if if our church is right about the Bible we don't don't wonder about is is this the right way for me to live I live hammering on that nail you can keep driving a nail after now after nail you can keep putting up the wall you can keep putting up this foundation you can keep putting up the house that God's giving you spiritually because you've got thus saith the Lord you got the blueprint ain't a glory you can hammer away you can keep putting up God's will for your life because you got thus saith the Lord hallelujah the Prophet tells us here that when you've got thus saith the Lord he said then you put away the leadership of man and man's plans and man's ambitions and thus saith the Holy Ghost is a living reality so church when you've got thus saith the Lord it's a reality your life is real it doesn't seem like a dream it doesn't seem like you're grasping at you know trying to grab a hold of something that you just can never grab a hold of right now you've got to bear with me here Church there's a part of us where the Bible says work we're longing right all creation is long for the manifestation of the sons of God right we're all longing for the latter rain I believe brother Simon said he mentioned that on Sunday the latter eight we're all waiting for the latter rain but just while we're waiting it doesn't mean we're just kind of guessing at our life we should know exactly what our life has meant to be amen we should know what God has called us to do and Lord willing we'll look at that on Sunday here by God's grace but it should be a reality we should know exactly what God has called us to do because we have thus saith the Lord amen hallelujah programs had noticed the harmony of the father and the son Jesus never did anything unless it was first showed him by the father John 5:19 this harmony is now to exist between the groom and his bride he says the word is in the ride as it wasn't Mary the bride has the mind of Christ for she knows what he wants done with the word she performs the command of the word in his name for she has thus saith the Lord then the word is quickened by the spirit and it comes to pass like a seed that's planted and watered it comes a full harvest serving its purpose hallelujah so brother ham says the word should be in you like it was in Mary how did the word get in Mary the Holy Ghost overshadowed her how does the word get in you the Holy Ghost has to do more than overshadow and you he has to live in you amen he has to seal your soul seal means mark he has to be a mark upon your soul and then you know what he once done with the word now churches should be pretty easy for us we should know what God wants done with this word right for example when we see somebody sick we should know what God wants done we should pray and find out God is at your wheel to heal them and if not then God then help us to show mercy to them help us to show them some kind of love if we see somebody the church you don't have enough money or seems like they're struggling we should feel we should know what God does once done with the word the Bible said you should do good to those of the household of faith especially as it is the opportunity that you have to do it grace it hard we should know what God wants and with the word the Bible says gather more as you see that Day approaching so if I call the service on New Year's Eve which I might and we might have communion on New Year's Eve night then you should come because the Bible says that gather more's you see the Day approaching we should know what God wants done with his word praise God and church that fills many of our days there's many days we don't have to remember to know or we have to know we don't have to wonder what does God want done today we should know most days what God once done we should look out and see the needs of the people if we're living for others we should have our eyes on other people and we should be able to try and help them by God's grace amen hallelujah amen she knows what he wants done with us say the Lord praise God he said those in the bride do only his will no man can make them do otherwise they have thus saith the LORD or they keep still they know that it has to be God in them doing the works fulfilling his own word he did not complete all his work while he while in his earthly ministry so now he works in and through the bride she things that him up but he will now fulfill through the bride the work that he left for this specific time praise God oh thank you Lord God's doing something now in other words God left a job for us to do praise the Lord now let me jump to another quote 1965 C does not air with a Chuck motor and said o jehovih eagle feed your little ones tonight upon that word Lord they're needy that's the diet they need that's what they need to know what the food is what thus saith the Lord is so your food but you're gonna eat on tonight what you eat on every service it should be the stay at the Lord and if not Church I'll tell you I'll say this is my thought where I'm not sure what brother I met here or I don't know what this means here but but when we've got the word and we know what the word says in a life with the Prophet and everything is pointing in one direction everything's in harmony then we know we've got thus saith the Lord hallelujah now here's what we'll find here brother Branham says it's not like it used to be his people has lost their common decency and modesty he said it used to be when the Prophet said thus saith the Lord the people trembled he said yea they certainly did they were they the people move for they were afraid but now they lost all the scare of it they don't fear God but the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom just the beginning of it so when we get to the spot where we're really nervous like oh I better do this have you ever been there recently I better confess this sir oh my I better do this when you're trembling right there and you're you're fearing God now you've got the beginning of wisdom praise God that's right church but the Prophet today can speak with thus saith the Lord and that people say nonsense see there's not a hope for them so church there's only a hope for those of us who tremble at the sat the Lord that's going to take a real sincere Christian isn't it it's not going to just takes not just gonna be somebody who just sometimes reads their Bible sometimes prays or we're just going through the motions of coming to church it could take somebody who really believes that this is God speaking to us right now that's right the Prophet goes to say this in power transformation it used to be in the church life long ago when the prophet has something to say thus saith the Lord the people moved they stayed right with it they moved but now they say I don't like that guy vote him out he said see they don't have understanding no more the people just don't move by the Spirit of God anymore he says God's Word as his spirit and his word comes to his prophet and the word is supposed to transform you from what the things of the world are into the image of sense of sons and daughters of God and the world can only come through these prophets as they spoke and it came has to be compared with the word and show that it was the word then if you accept that it'll transform you amen how many want to be transformed to be more like Christ yeah I was watching a little glassblowing class you ever seen glassblowing didn't we never see that and it reminded me of this word conform hum you know the Bible says we must be conformed to the image of the son of God anything that you see that's made of glass like these mason jars anything that's glass ornaments anything that's made of glass they've got to put it on this stick this big long rod they got to heat this furnace up to like thousands of degrees and they got to stick that in there and they just got to keep turning in it so all the heat goes equally around all there and then they got to bring it out they got to put these gloves on the handle and they got to have a tool and they got to start forming it and once it starts cooling off they got to put it in there again and they got to bring it out they got to smooth it out and they've got to shape that thing and and finally when it's about ready they'll have like a like a cookie cutter kind of thing and they've got to put that cookie cutter around that glass there to get the right shape kind like a template every know what I'm talking about what's what's another word like a factory makes them what are those called then they got like little templates I'm not sure what they're called now but it's like a cookie cutter yeah like a pretty a like a printing press or something like that so they had like that like they were making they were making sinks out of glass they're these stylish sinks that's when I was watching and so you know you have your faucet right and they're making a curved faucet and so that to take that faucet and know now then take the glass which was almost of the shape of the faucet and they had to kind of push it into that that cookie cutter thing there and then it pushed out everything that wasn't exactly right and when they brought it out of that pattern it was exactly in the right pattern and they just had to shave off some of the sides amen that's what all I should be praise God all live shirts got to be taking on this big stick of God and the Bible says the fiery trial of your faith will work patience in your life amen did you know that there's a pattern that God wants to form you off of and it's the pattern of Jesus Christ amen I'll tell you that's a really nice pattern and I'll tell you like this our lives don't always fit it very well do they and the church said how many of you live a life like Jesus Christ constantly casting out demons and healing the sick and raising the dead amen now we might not be called all those things but at the same time don't you want to live a higher life so God has to you have to say God okay take me through this fire take me through this trial help me not to take myself out of it and you know try to take the easy way let me go through the fiery trials and then for me let me be formed in the image and the shape of your son Jesus Christ amen but that's watching they got to keep that glass in there a long time it's got to be and around and around and around it's got to go it's got to go back in and another trial and another trial then put it in that little pattern maker there I'll just say like that a die again it might be a die there we go and you got to put in the die that's what we need to do die glory we need to fit into the die and it's the only way to do that is pressure they've got to put the pressure on that glass and put into that die so it fits and then they got to trim off anything that doesn't match that die or that pattern and this word is the great pattern that we want our lives to be based upon praise the Lord as a member it's never going to be in some great big Church Church we got such a we got such a blessing we have such an advantage because we're not a part of some big denomination or organization we're not following man we're not following money or popularity we have such an advantage but we've got to give a bit a greater sacrifice we've got to give God more of ourselves we got a trend what does st. the Lord amen praise God we have to tremble at the say the Lord if you want to be transformed you got to trem what the word when you went out when I read what what brother Adam says with thus saith the Lord I read out of the Bible and it's thus saith the Lord and if we don't tremble at it something's wrong with us I mean if we're not living it yeah you don't have to tremble if you're living it you can just rejoice and say hallelujah keep me humble Lord keep me on a real sweet Christian but if we're not living it we should be able to sit we should be able to tremble and say God help me to live that because when you tremble physically it shows that spiritually you've got the fear of the Lord that's what brother Branham said power transformation now here's the trouble church let me read it to you when the world and the church joins itself together then they don't want nothing spiritual they don't want thus saith the Lord they want what they want they want the world and to say they're Christian but live in the world and live with the world and live like the world and still maintain their confession of being a Christian that's a program says so they that's what the worldly Christians do they really don't want thus saith the Lord like like it is with water baptism right it's an easy one well you should you have to be baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ to receive the Holy Ghost and they'll say oh no it's okay I can still be sprinkled or I can use father son Holy Ghost right that's what people will say they don't want you to actually tell them that no it's actually thus saith the Lord if you want the the ghosts you got to be baptized in the name of Lord Jesus Christ right they don't want that say the Lord because they want to live like the world and still be called a Christian and we've got to make sure that we don't get complacent in our Christian walks with God right and just say well I've come this far I can relax I could I can just cool off with God no we've got to take thus saith the Lord to be transformed by the Word of God all right now I want to make I want to find something real quick here because I know I got something that everybody wants and I've got a thus saith the Lord for you because I never preached this anywhere I told you I was going to preach it my little prayer series I think I got through three only three parts on that series because I started reading other things I started reading other books maybe I'll go back to that we'll see but I got some quotes here I want to make sure that I pour in here and we'll probably revisit them again by the grace of the Lord yeah here they are here's one here's one yeah this will make sure I don't miss this here all right so here it is now before you raise your hand let me warn you don't raise your hand unless you really mean it but I'm not I'm not gonna ask you to raise your hands but just think in your heart if you would like to have a revival don't worry your hands because rub man tells us the stay at the Lord how to get a revival and that's not like well that's a pretty good idea too brother branham it's thus saith the lord so this is from 1956 and this is in Shreveport Louisiana now he's preaching this miss message called make the valley full of ditches remember that Jehoshaphat and Ahab's son right we're coming to Elisha I think it was it was Elijah for thus saith the Lord and Elisha is like I'm not gonna talk to them but the only reason I will be was because jehosophat's here remember that and they say what do we do you know we've got to take this victory and Elisha said thus saith the Lord go make the valley full of ditches and he was saying you got to dig and what remember that when they dug out the ditches water filled them and then when the enemy woke up in the morning the sunlight reflected off and it looked like blood and the enemy all got confuses at all we've all heard they've already defeated all these people let's run away that's what the enemy always does he runs at the blood of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah the brother has preaching this message in Louisiana now let's see if you want a revival and I got to do the same thing and now Church if you want a revival this would make you tremble in your soul if you want a revival or if you want to see revival in someone else's life I've never preached this anywhere so it's coming tonight he says now notice when they begin to dig they dug against things they just throwed it out they made big ditches the next morning the enemy looked down and the Sun come up and looked like blood they said well they fought on one soldier killed each other and away they went and were ambushed and they said this is just the light thing before the Lord sending forth his water and they went out into another land and they stopped up every well they cut down every good tree they just had a real old-fashioned revival so but I'm saying revival comes by digging revival comes by cutting digging and cutting brings revival brother Branham says listen Church I'm getting I'm getting to thus saith the Lord and I think if you're honest Church if you've ever seen a revival in your life which I know bang and I have and I'm sure everybody everybody's here seen a revival in your life right where the dead things you push out the dead things and now y'all you got no dead things in your life you're just living pure before the Lord how many of how many ever felt that way now it'd be a good time to raise your hand there's be a good time before I get to this quote if you've ever pushed all the dirty things out of your lake right like bro that's all the lake and here's a storm and a push out all the day if you've ever pushed now I don't want that anymore I don't want to see that I don't want to say that anymore I don't want to treat people like that if you've ever gotten to that place you've had revival Amen hallelujah and it takes Diggy now and it takes cutting out and he says they had a real old-fashioned and when it gets to that place at the people that love God will throw everything they got right into the revival with are you ready are you ready take a deep breath drink some water maybe you got to run to get some water real quick so you don't pass out he says we'll throw everything out and get right into revival with prayer and with everything else and seek God's face and pray and seek God and call out in the hours of the night for mercy and get the neighbors saved and so forth I tell you we'll stop the mouth of every critic we'll knock down every formal thing that's standing up and they'll have to know that God's been in the camp that's right friends we'll never do it until that thing takes place what thing he says prank seeking God and calling out to God in the night he said that's the way of revival for thus saith the Lord Elijah spoke it in the name of the Lord amen that's why didn't I didn't want to ask you to raise your hands now when if that ever becomes of the sat the Lord reality to us we know the way of revival now it's through prayer seeking the face of God trying to get the neighbor saved and at any time of the day calling out for mercy listen it don't have to be a nighttime making me during the daytime the thing is we just got it if God's really in your heart for revival brother hands houses thus saith the Lord you seek God and that lines up with what Peter said if you draw nigh to God God will draw nigh to you I mean it lines up with every other scripture if anybody wants revival in our church er if we will revival in our lives we've got to do thus saith the Lord he said that's the way for revival so in other words it means giving God all your free time praise God god never asked us to quit working Paul had great revivals but he's still had time to make tents praise the Lord he said time to eat right now I hope that was a blessing there and you could see that now I think there's another one let me see if I can find it real quick I thought I had - thus saith the Lord's on prayer oh here it is yeah yeah here's another one he said yeah here this chatauqua ohio 1960 he says if he can just get the Pentecostal Church now let's bring it down to us let's bring it down to message okay that's can we just bring it home tonight let me let me put let me put our church name into it if he can get Bride of Christ Fellowship Church to start thinking more of their buildings and their well-dressed congregations then they do have an old-fashioned prayer meeting and pairing meeting and the baptism of the Holy Ghost and a godly life and clean up their women and clean up their men make them live holy and either toe the mark or get out and not put so much on money and more money and raising funds the first thing you know you're gonna find going off without Christ again amen so like Mary and Joseph they left Christ right back at Jerusalem Laura said that's what the church does they leave the revival they leave Christ they leave the word and they care more about buildings clothes money and all these other things and I'm not done I'm not done brother sister you remember this listen thus saith the Lord now this I hope this makes somebody trim me the church better clean up you're drifting too far out come back to the Lord come back to real prayer meetings now church you might this might be just for Chautauqua Ohio's Church and night in in June of 1960 but listen it's got to be the same yesterday today and forever they cannot have a Holy Ghost revival any differently than we could and church brother hey miss and he just got the Holy Ghost two months ago I mean the Holy Ghost has been here praise God he was memories praying all week for the Holy Ghost I think he may have missed a few meals sport and he's been a different person since then he's been faithful right here it is posted dude he has he not see because the Holy Ghost puts you in power for service and this is the best service you could be in right here tonight amen because God says gather more gather more as you see the Day approaching get together with the Saints if you love one another you'll get together with each other and that's how you know you're my disciples you have love for the believers let me read that again brother sister you remember all my brothers did all my sisters here tonight you remember this thus saith the Lord the church better clean up you're drifting too far out come back to the Lord come back to rear real prayer meetings now I've told you this I've invited you to prayer meetings my heart my prayer meeting is 30 minutes before church that's a good prayer meeting could the Holy Spirit lead us to more sure but we ought to support the ones we've already got going first and then that'll create a hunger for more I believe a church that's those who are thus saith the Lord if you really want to revival if somebody wants to revival in their heart we don't have to wonder what it takes program tells us it takes us cleaning out a digging out digging out everything out of our life cutting down anything that's grown up in our lives seeking the face of God calling out to God I've never preached it anywhere else I was saving it right here for the home church I didn't preach this in North Carolina last year but this is the way for revival anything's that that's that's this laying in our lives must be dug out anything growing up must be cut down and let's give ourselves to prayer seeking the face of God he says that's thus saith the Lord that's how a revival comes hallelujah so I want to lay that in because I think that's most important how many be that's important to us certainly and like with brother amen testimony said he was praying all week for the Holy Ghost listen to the token message all week and you and you and I can do that too that's it we might you might already think you're born again which is wonderful praise God if God's give you that revelation but what about saving your neighbor that's something I can do right what about saving family members that's something I can do that's something you can do but if we really want to see revival the Prophet said that's how it's got to be done we really have to seek the face of God amen and that's not the stage I see that's thus saith the Lord that's right the Bible want a revival you got to dig out cut down seek the face of God God brings revival now see that's what the denominations do Church and you've all heard it you've all watched TBN or you probably watch YouTube of preachers every year this is the time church in fact it's going to be this Sunday every Church around in America is gonna say well that's I'm bringing the word for 2019 how many times have I seen that well let me let me prophesy let me give you a word from the Lord for 2019 Church if you're not a prophet if I'm not a prophet that we don't really have the word for in 2019 but let me tell you we've got the word for the age of Laodicea praise God now don't get me wrong God might speak through some of these things but what it oftentimes is is just people trying to become a minor prophet or something like that preachers just trying to prophesy oh this is the now whoever now listen whoever comes whoever follows up with those things that make sure it's right and the scene was this a year of what all those things they prophesied nobody follows up with it see because it's not real real revival it's not a real prophecy it's just presuming we don't want to presume we want to tremble it up saith the Lord amen and I'm not asking everybody to fast and pray and I mean if you got to do that but I'm saying if you if you and I ever won a revival we know thus saith the Lord what needs to be done pray see God called on God throughout the day night call on him all the time and he says thus saith the Lord will have a revival Amen so I never preached it anywhere I saved it for all you cuz I love you so much you're my sheep and I mean I'm your shepherd none just naturally but I'm a sheep too I need God's help too I'm not trying to exalt myself in like that but the Bible does say yeah I need a shepherd so I'm saying this is what thus saith the Lord is we have thus sayeth the Lord now remember this is the way to know the sayeth the Lord brother Branham says I'm speaking now but when he speaks I say it's not me it's thus saith the Lord he says and I can't say it until he tells me praise God now let me see how I'm doing on time here give me 30 more minutes I'd like to just do 30 more minutes that would give me an hour alright now let me go through these briefly and then it will try to close in 30 minutes now 30 minutes I don't know that's a bad word to use close I just shouldn't say that word until I'm ready to close there's three fulfilled or standing prophecies brother random game three of them are standing now these are ones that let me say like this these are ones that he said on tape before they happen there's some that are standing that were never on tape like the seven major visions of 1933 that was never on tape so we we actually can't say to somebody we'll see this was recorded before it happened we don't have the recording before it happens so while I believe those prophecies from 1933 I believe them I can't actually say that that I have proof that they had they were prophesied before they actually happened does anybody understand okay I believe they were but I don't have any proof other than just someone's word and even that was not in 1933 it was in 1958 was the earliest one I had of that but let me give you three that have already fulfilled or standing the first BAM says this he says the sign of the sermon he says the Royal seed of Abraham let me tell you the saith the Lord you're receiving your last son that's according to the scripture and the revelation of God in my heart that speaks this is the truth he says thus saith the Lord you will never and no more Gentile church age ever see any sign to succeed this go greater this is the last sign to the church amen glory brother Rams gifted discernment in the prayer line was the last sign to the Gentile church before the rapture thus saith the Lord he said nothing will rise he says if something rise is greater than this call me a false prophet has anything risen greater than brother Rams discernment no nothing is even close they're just guessing in ballpark prophecies nothing even comes close remember I heard I heard a recording a Benny Hinn he seems to be like the closest I imagine but there's recording of him in 1988 is and he's saying in the 1990s God will judge the homosexuals and burn them up in America did that ever happen no they only got more and more so see whenever they've tried to prophesy they always fail because God's not with them they might get the anointing as you know false prophets false Christ get the anointing sometimes and God might do miracles and things like that but when they try to prophesy it's never gonna be right it's not gonna be right because they're not they're not obeying all the Word of God because I thought the women cut their hair and he you know they these he's been known to do drugs and he's the lover of money rather than lovers of God we know it's we know how they live all right second here's another one this is so true knowing - one - the end time he said it's predicted they're going to it and they're going to do it for it's thus saith the Lord they're going to do it you remember them denominations will never break up and their denomination come back to the word it's thus saith the Lord they won't they will they go into the Antichrist exactly it's thus saith the Lord they will amen hallelujah so I told brother fangs when a brother brains banks brother I'm not going to call his name but I told brother veins brother to his face I said it's thus saith the Lord you better come on that denomination because I said your denomination is gonna take the mark of the beast I said it's thus saith the Lord and he told me said I'm gonna wait there to the sea if they get a revival and last time I talked to him he said they hadn't got it yet and I told me what you better get out of here sometime soon I said you don't have to come to our church but you better get out of denomination because it's thus saith the Lord they'll never break up their denominations and come back to the message and they will take the mark of the beast it's thus saith the Lord they will because that's what Revelation 13 says he deceives all nations and they all take a mark that they they so they can buy and sell and worship the Beast worship Antichrist they all going to Rome we know it okay that's the second thing third thing the third thing was on the preview of the bride oh here's another one - here's what I'm sorry yeah this is another one that goes along with that denomination one he says the chief captain Jesus Christ our general wants to lead us into the promised land and he's the only one that can do it our organizations will not do it thus saith the Lord mark that down praise God amen Church you're in the best place how many wanna go in the promised land of the rapture can I say like that you're in the black best place to do it because it's thus saith the Lord denominations can't take you there only Christ can take you there glory so the third one the first one is that we have the last sign he said no sign will ever rise greater than brother Graham's time discernment and never has that prophecy standing second one the denominations will never come back to the message and they'll all go the Antichrist the third but then said the preview of the bride he saw the Church of United States dancing the rock-and-roll smoking cigarettes naked from the waist up led by a witch I don't know who that witches in the Christian denominations but he said they're led by a witch dancing to rock and roll yeah might be a might be I'll have to see if she dances they're led by some woman which who must be call herself a prophetess like Jezebel but I believe this is one that's even most close to be fulfilled because and they all smoke and they all cuss and drink and they all live like the world and claim to be Christians now we try to be nice to them right we try to be nice to them but if they ever came here they're gonna hear us say at the Lord because we're not the judge and you know we're not we're not gods we're not we're not God we can't storm out we don't know who's gonna be saving who's now so we just talk real nice about Jesus we tell him how much we love that's her brother and said he said don't make yourself out to be a Christian just tell everybody how much you love Jesus amen hallelujah and if there's any seed in them if there's any desire then they'll see you're a real Christian and they'll want to be like you that's right all right okay twenty minutes okay all right now let me uh I'm gonna go through these quickly but the RAM said about United States there's numerous thus saith the Lord's brother branham said hey Lord in 1956 she made her fatal move but man said Los Angeles will go beneath the ocean thus saith the lord it will she's done she's washed she's finished what our I don't know when but it will be sunk right after that the earthquakes begin to jolt and bo-hee watch what the spirit following it there come a time in the name of the Lord that people will go completely insane the Bible says so they'll scream and holler great hideous things in their imaginary mind the radios and things our television programs are producing it there'll be such things as ants rise up on the earth now he's speaking of the this is the fifth trumpet I believe and there'll be high as 14 trees they're becoming a bird fly across the earth with wings four or five miles across and people will see them they'll scream and holler and cry for mercy but it'll be the plagues I'm sorry it's Revelation 15 and 16 wait till I preached on the plagues opening up so that's thus saith the Lord now we see the insanely happening already right many people insane in fact the Bible says if you accept homosexuality the Bible says you're already insane it's already says you've got a reprobate mind there were already see how Loren day go I hate to call names whatever I see how Loren day go said last week or a couple weeks ago well the answer is homosexuality wrong she says I don't know I don't think so she said I'm not God Church she's borderline insane when you get to the spot where you can say God says Sodom God condemns Sodom and Gomorrah over fifty times in the Bible and the New Testament and the Bible says five times plainly that homosexuality is wrong in the New Testament and if you're to the spot where you saying well I don't know I don't know you are almost insane and you've almost crossed the line between mercy and judgment almost because most people that go on that side they never come back why because the Bible said God gave them over to a reprobate mind a reprobate means rejected they're rejected and I heard people say well you know Lauren that's okay Lauren dayyou'll said that you know these celebrities get up there and say she's done more for Jesus then you'll do in 50 lifetimes and I said nonsense just because somebody seems a nice song doesn't mean you've done more for Jesus you've only done more for Jesus when you've done his will which is his word amen I don't know if you saw it I did repent to God because I watched a youtube video of her on a late-night show but she goes out there and she almost exposes all of her chest on there I say God forgive me always like that forgive me I don't I won't watch that again now that proves Church that that woman is getting close to crossing the line between mercy and judgment accepting homosexuality and then exposing yourself the Bible said a woman that will do that she wears the attire of a harlot and her heart is full of nets in other words she's trying to seduce men she's trying to drag men down to hell just like she's full of hell amen any woman that will take her shirt off or wear those yoga pants or whatever they're more strip herself off like that she's basically insane amen don't be fooled by that so we don't play her at our house anymore no more Lauren a go for us now I find people that do singer songs I'm not gonna play that woman she might be the witch I hate to say that but remember she's naked from the waist up and bromances like paper newspaper gray newspapers wrapped around her singing and dancing to rock and roll and smoking cigarettes oh we better be careful what we listen to any woman that exposed herself like that has done nothing for God because she's an object of lust is that right Church that's right the Bible said there's their dead while they're alive if they live in pleasure on this earth they're dead while they're alive oh did you know this - I hate to say more about this woman but she was recently invited because of her popularity for music this fall she was invited to a award ceremony for rappers and a rapper had wrote this evil song and got a word for it while he died in a gang shooting and she gave it she gave this award out and was clapping for this rapper and he was rapping about sexual immorality and all kind I went looked up the lyrics it was all customers it was all sexual and she's in there clapping and giving her there's this man's family members and award award do you think that person's going to get from God and hero someone who's claiming to be a Christian given award to someone who's taking people's souls to hell through rap music God won't give that a reward God will give that judgement amen I wasn't planning on preaching that so this is all coming fresh I'm acting insane he said it's thus saith the Lord they'll go insane what do we got today well that's that must been from God because I was not planning on saying that advance that's usually how I knows from God when I just feel to say something I wasn't planning on saying it well and said it in the name of the Lord he said there's a hydrogen bomb judgment is upon this nation she spurned God for her last there's no more hope there'll be a few stragglers coming to receive the Holy Spirit how was the meeting out of there yeah I was one of those truckers that came into the Holy Ghost right before this bomb falls on America oh I can see myself in that quote amen also those little stragglers right at the end praise the Lord right before the door closed oh my said by the america's judgment it close at hand mark that in your book and see if it comes to pass a hydrogen bomb heading this way thus saith the Lord Moran said so you just mark it down we're coming into a religious persecution with the same things they did in pagan Rome many years ago for it's thus saith the Lord so is there a persecution coming to America yes the Bible the details in Revelation 13 it's thus saith the Lord it's coming remember thus saith the Lord there will be a woman rule before the end time should either be a president vice president or it'll be the Catholic Church as a woman I've seen her a great woman the nation bowed to her it'll be one before the end time thus saith the Lord we don't know it's a it's either president vice president or the Roman Catholic Church we don't know I really thought it was Hillary but boy I was wrong on that one now here's what other half says now there he says many of you are looking for great growth and outpouring things just remember marketing your Bibles you'll not see it that's the sin it the Lord you'll not see it this nation is not going to have a great outpouring and great revival and all these things like that it's thus saith the Lord now brother man he says now seven major visions he says there were seven things smoke of what would happen it'll be that way that's in the name of the Lord it shall be that way the seven major visions it'll be that way thus saith the Lord but the RAM says I've got thus saith the Lord he said about the seven major visions he said she'll continue to strip herself he said they'll just be a little tiny group with a very elected that's predestination he said predestinated will escape that a man on an area so she's going to continue the women of this world are gonna continue to strip themselves so sisters continue to cover yourselves they're gonna continue strip more strip more strip we just more cover more cover more holy more pleasing to God it's a good sign that you're close to God when you're not stripping yourself if you can look in the picture five years ago and you got more clothes on or the same amount of clothes on you can say praise the Lord hey hallelujah because they're gonna keep taking off more and how many of these grandmother's do you think ever thought they wear yoga pants or leggings who ever thought a grandma would wear yoga pants and show off what's left of her body can I say like that who ever thought I never thought I'd see that in my lifetime but yet when I go to the rec center I see it I go in there to do my exercise in my modest clothes to do Taekwondo and I see grandma's walking out and they got those pants on what are you doing and I got all painted up and haircut and and also you know I'll just swagger it or whatever who would've thought that same could convince seventy year old women to wear yoga pants and try to be sexy at the age of 70 what a shame it shows you the spirit it's a spirit but ma'am says thus saith the Lord he said he said out here he said he says they don't know what decency means little old tight dresses on and things like that a man lusting after than our sisters we got to be careful we don't wear tight dresses right sisters he says and things like that men lusting after them and think they're decent you might not have done wrong sister but let me tell you something you're two of the devil so with a tight dress on it's a two of the devil and at the judgment bar they'll say if the Lord your answer for committing adultery and your soul will be gone can you imagine how much grace God is gonna have to have upon all of our Christian friends especially the women that wear tight dresses and short shorts and those yoga pants can you imagine man said thus saith the Lord you'll answer the judgment bar it's thus saith the Lord they will answer at the judgment bar as having a spirit of a prostitute can you imagine the grace God is gonna have to have on them in order for them to be saved and what is the grace the grace is when you've done it to one of the least of these my brethren you've done it unto me that's the only grace that's only hope they have for grace that's thus saith the Lord I have to wonder was that brother Branham was that is that somebody else that's God he said that's how you know it'll speak it it'll say thus saith the Lord alright got about 12 minutes here let me try to finish this up here by God's grace probably got three or four I guess said there's three thousand four hundred quotes if I just pulled out the ones that were very important for us here let's see I got doctrine ones I got mark of the beast thus saith the Lord what can I do in 12 minutes let's see got the revival okay let me let let me close with these few things here yeah let me do these go in your Bible you got your Bibles go to Revelation 13 revelation 13:16 Simon said he mentioned the squeeze again so let me just go back we have two scriptures at least that prove that there's gonna come a rush the oyster let me just rehearse those and I want to read another one more quote Revelation 3:16 I'll try 13 16 forgive me let me read it and he that's the Antichrist and he causes all both small and great rich and poor free and bond to receive a mark in their right hand or in their foreheads a church don't let this booming economy deceive you we are still 20 trillion dollars in debt and the church said did you see today they have the biggest jump ever on the stock market they had a huge that an awful plunge the day before Christmas on Christmas Eve and not today that the biggest jump don't let any economists or any political figure deceive you this nation is in trouble because of our debt I don't care how rich people are getting I don't know if you're getting rich or not I'm really not I haven't seen it it's probably for the stock market people the big business people I'm thankful though I mean haven't had many more new taxes I'm thankful for that but don't be deceived here this nation is still gonna have to sell out its twenty trillion dollars in debt and the spending bills they say well then they didn't know of course the President signed the last one which I don't blame him I kind of want the wall to if we're gonna be here but but the reality of it is over this year they've signed all these different bills they keep spending more than they bring in it's never they're gonna keep they all say they're stop kicking the can down the road but they're all just kicking it down the road they're just kicking it down the road why because they have to go that way because they have to sell out and somebody's got to bail them out they're kind old priests is going to bail them out the Pope because that's what prophecy says kind old priests got to bail them out did you see which have to look it up I saved I say the article one of these nations that produces all this gold I think it was Venezuela did you see that last week or couple weeks ago Venezuela when to get all their gold and cash in for their bonds because they're one of the biggest producers of gold and I think it was like 55 billion dollars because all the gold that back that money was in Europe somewhere I think it was break Britain and they're demanding they want their gold for these bonds well that's what it's going to come down to but answer they're gonna call the bonds they're gonna call the bonds in theirs and there's got to be something to back it so it looked like Venezuela was kind of catching that little it gets a little wisdom beforehand to get the gold I don't know we don't know the day or the hour but I thought that's interesting why would the nation all of a sudden want their gold and cash and all this paper bonds interesting now brother branham reads this scripture and he says this and pick up your pen and write this is his quote now he said I never wrote this the Spirit of God wrote this I believe someday the real Bride of Christ will be forced to stop preaching the Word of God the Bible prophesies it in revelation 13:16 so this is prophecy that you and I will have to stop coming to churches that our church that preaches the real gospel truth if it's in our data if it's in our lifetime he says if you want to put it down did Hama nations will force it to stop or take its mark then when the lamb the lamb will take his bride and judge the for this so this is an evil thing that the is going to bring down you got to take a marker we're controlling your money and brother BAM said Jesus gonna destroy the for doing this all right so we got scripture for do we not we got scripture we have scripture for the squeeze well Graham said they're gonna force the bride of Jesus Christ that's not preaching the Word of God all right go to Revelation 3:10 this is our second scripture saw Church I believe it is scriptural that the Bride of Christ will go through some small little minor persecution or squeeze because that's what that's what the Prophet said when he said this holy spirit told me to pick up my pen and write he said it was a message for the bride with the word revelation 3:10 because thou has kept the word of my patience I will also keep thee from the hour temptation which would come upon all the world to try them that dwell upon the earth brother Branham says that will come as follows the Academical move that has started on what seems such a beautiful and blessed principle fulfilling Christ prayer that we all might be one become so strong politically that she bears pressure upon the government to cause all to join with her either directly or through adherence to principles and acted into law so that no people will be recognized as actual churches unless under direct or indirect then I'm sorry domination of this council as this pressure increases so it's going to get greater and it will it will be harder to resist for to resist is to lose privilege and so many will be tempted to go along for they will feel it is better to serve God publicly in the framework of this organization then not to serve God at all publicly but they err to believe the devil's lie is to serve Satan even though you may want to calm Java 9 black will not be deceived we're not gonna be to see by churches that are trying to pressure us into joining some council I could be pressured into that if we live to see it he says the church system of the Roman Catholic Church in the Protestant is coming together will control the whole wealth of the world system and force the whole world into its religious trap or will kill them by refusing them the privilege of buying and selling whereby that would may they would make a living he says with no gold the system fails or Falls the Jews will be trapped and come into alliance and the harlot Church will take over the world how many believe that I believe that praise God let me see if I can poop that Mena's whaler quote real quick I think I can do it then is yeah there it is here it is yeah it's from the business insider Venezuela is coming again it's 550 million of gold at the Bank of England they want their gold and this was this was December 7th this year and Venezuela is one of the biggest producers of gold in the world and they're saying well we want our gold back the Bank of England's like what was it you just take your paper and he's like no we want the gold but ramesses without gold the system Falls the Jews will be trapped and coming to the Lions and the harlot Church will take over the whole world because it's got to come back to gold oh don't you see Church you're either gonna take natural gold or spirit so go there to see they want the natural gold but we want the spiritual goat we want the Holy Ghost amen hallelujah we want God's real deity in our myths we want to see the Holy Ghost win souls bring sinners to repentance heal the sick how do you you that's the gold we're concerned about but they're after natural gold we want the spiritual gold hallelujah let's stay on our feet here by God's grace I'm closing with this well this might seem a little different I'm going to close to this it kind of goes back to this move around Jeffersonville this is not the stay at the Lord but I just want to do this I want to say this Paul warned them the Ephesians to say what he said even as Peter did likewise he warned them that even he could not change one word of what he had been given by revelation I mean oh let it's Galatians chapter 1 let me read it to you Paul warned everyone and said if you change one word you're cursed but though we that includes Paul though we or an angel from heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which that we have preached unto you let him be accursed as we said before so say I now again if any man preach any other gospel unto you then that you have received let him be accursed for do I now persuade men or God or do I seek to please men for if yet I please men I should not be the servant of Christ hate to say church but I'm not here to please you neither are you here to please me although I want to make you happy I want to serve I want to serve you I want to help you guys out there how about all the church if I can but really I'm not here really to serve your desires I'm here to serve Christ desires and that's what Paul said anyone who tries to change the message the Lord's message because his aim brother branham's really it's really God's he's the messenger of the Lord's message how many remember we read read that tonight brother man said I may not do it but this message will introduce Jesus Christ to the world amen hallelujah I love that quote romance says Paul warned them that even if he could not change one word it would have been given by revelation oh how important is to hear the voice of God by the way of his messengers and then say what has been given them to say to the churches but false apostles come with their own word those Ephesians knew that the words that Pau thought they were full of the Holy Ghost by laying on Paul's hands they look those false apostles in the eye and said you're not saying what Paul said you are therefore false oh that sets my heart on fire get back to the word it is not you that really tries the Apostle and the prophet and the teacher it is the word that tries them one of these days there's going to come a prophet he says to the latest scene in church age and you will know he's the real one sent from God or not yes you will for he is of God he will be in that word exactly as God gave it to Paul he won't deviate from that word for one moment not by one iota how do we know brother Ryan was a prophet well he has prophecies that came to pass but also he didn't change one word in this holy blessed book that's either what I told you I'm closing with this the tape ministry movement of just play tapes just my tapes what does it do it it changes one word now pastors aren't needed to preach now evangelists aren't needed to preach you just need brother Branham to preach that change is what Paul said because Paul said when you have five ministry perfects the body of Christ does ever understand that's why it's so important not to change one thing that the Apostle Paul said not one now we're willing sunday will show all the other the state the Lord's I didn't get like it halfway through all those let's say the Lord's the church have you been blessed tonight by thus saith the Lord now you heard things I wasn't playing on I wasn't playing on the gold I wasn't playing on Lauren Daigle but I just said it I just felt like God wanted to bring that out so I just let it go by the grace of the Lord and we should be mature enough Church we should be spiritual enough to recognize demon spirits in fact that's when you now being winning invincible when we can recognize the two spirits in the framework of the church and then withstand them amen and do not not do not accept them but withstand the demon spirits and cast them out in Jesus Christ name praise God Brooke now Kai won't you come mmm bringing I'm going back to those quotes about prayer let me close with this I want to buy everybody last year Christmas time or I invite everybody to come before service to pray early I want to invite the church again if you can if you can come early to pray before service I really appreciate that I didn't get the time today that was my fault I didn't get here early enough I was trying to get some errands done I lost track of time so forgive me for that but I got there on Sunday at cam Church I was there half an hour early praying so I believe that I believe these quotes if you believe these quotes are for thus saith the Lord for brother Branham if you are revival he said throw everything you've got into prayer and seek God's face and call on God's mercy in the night time is it night tonight Church can we cry out to God in the night time hallelujah I just think that's such a beautiful quote he says friends will never have a revival until that takes place there'll be no revival in our lives there'll be no a revival in the church he says until that takes place when you throw everything you got into praying everything you got into crying out to God for something that's what a revival happens and that's not thus saith William Branham that's thus saith the Lord praise God let me go back to the other one that talked : brother sister you remember that saith the Lord the church better clean up you're drifting too far come back to the Lord come back to real prayer meetings real prayer meetings now the dangerous thing churches that make it about well the dangerous thing to say well we have to pray all night in order for God that you know in order to have a real prayer meeting that's not always true that's not always true if it takes like bodiham said if it takes you all night to die out then you better pray all night however long it takes you to die out that's how long you pray but this is how revival comes to us save the Lord we have aren't you glad for thus saith the Lord church that just means that all the free time I can't stop taking care of my children I got it I got how many times a day that I run them to the restroom especially Victoria I can't just say well no I gotta pray you just let nature take its course can't do that but in all those free moments all those little times you can just pray in your heart crowd to God can we just do that can we just pray for a few moments together Church I'm in my heart I'm just trembling now because this is the safe alone just trembling in my heart and you know I'm trembling because I know when I had to revival my life this is how I lived and I'm a man and I get busy I get into other things too but I know in my heart I want a revival sometimes I'm they want a revival sometime I didn't say today I said some time now be good time to raise your hand to be a good time to raise your head man I tremble at this the saying the lord I tremble at it [Music] and that's how you know Church you got the fear of the Lord when you can tremble when the state the Lord it shakes you ago god I wonder if I want my neighbor to be saved glory [Music] I want to see people in the church filled with the Holy Ghost if they're not filled fill them put them into service let's just have a time of Prayer can we just if you want to just raise your hands or if you just want to bow your head let's just have a word of Prayer here Heavenly Father I thank you for thus saith the Lord how they loo you Jesus Lord of my heart I'm trembling Lord because I see what your prophet said fake Christians just what they just want to look be in a church but they won't tremble thus saith the Lord the Lord we want to be real Christians hallelujah that tremble at the saith the Lord we would have been gee I need your mercy and forgiveness Lord at some point we all want a real revival and Lord you've told us not a suggestion on how to do it you told us thus saith the Lord how to do it dig out everything cut down anything seek the face of God call out to God in the night times cut the God in the morning card to God all day how they loo you Jesus hallelujah Jesus nor do you know I never preaches anywhere because I knew it was so crucial for our church it's crucial for every Christian my lord is machine for this little church that you may be pastor of Lord and I love so much they love me and such a special gathering that we have Lord every time we're gathered how I love these people and all they love me dear God they're your people Lord God and we're gonna stand together in judgment one day Lord and we want to be able to answer and give it a count of our lives with joy that we followed thus saith the Lord so father with that thought of mine I just pray right now Lord I see I know other people are praying to Lord John we just asked Lord in Jesus Christ's name Lord God you'd guide us to little revivals in our life and I say little because Lord we know it won't be something great like a nationwide thing we know the nation's gone but Lord may you bring a little revival in our lives in our church Lord God I imagine I guess you could bring a big one like happen in Lima but Lord we just ask that you to lead us into revival the Lord we know that would require sacrifice we know other things and other projects in our lives are gonna have to be put on the back burner because it's thus saith the Lord because it's the Word of God that says when you seek me with all your heart you'll find me babe oh thank you Jesus I troubled the how the Lord God at that scripture Lord in the context it was at the end of 70 years that the people started trembling at the words of Jeremiah and they started laying aside things in their lives they said prayers more important Oh God Lauren I'm a failure I'll be the first to admit I'm a failure many times of course I did pray today and I was in the closet praying Lord father many times I'm a failure Lord and I'm ashamed of that and I just pray God you lead me to revival you lead all of us to revival we know we're not lost but Lord we just want to be closer to you dear God we want to tremble when we hear a preacher say thus saith the father will be rarely anything from our own thoughts it'll always be from brother branham's your prophets thoughts opposite tremble either way dear God the Lord I trouble here tonight to your conscience I'd repeat but I pray that the Lord will have a burden for our neighbors Lord God give us a burden for our family we cried to God tonight Allu you with tears Lord God with sincere hearts we cry out Lord Jesus save them save our loved ones we cry out Jesus save them Lord use us Lord God to save souls bring revival Lord God we crowd tonight may the crying out continue tonight when we get home save my neighbors Lord dear God especially my atheist neighbor Lord I won't talk about it open his heart Lord open his life's heart and they'll want to talk about Jesus Lord God granted dear Lord Jesus Oh God it was a real prayer meeting Lord God before church after church Lord God hallelujah heal the sick Lord God fill those that are hungry for the Holy Ghost dear Jesus think of my children Lord may they be filled with the Holy Ghost dear God hallelujah hallelujah give each person a revival in their hearts dear God Nord if you do we know what we'll have to do we'll have to seek you with all of our hearts so that's what Jeremiah 29 says granted Jesus we tremble it thus saith the Lord and yet it's our foundation as well it's what the church is built upon thus saith the Lord thank you lord thank you for your word heavenly father I feel so close to you all nights like this dear God help us to keep just a real reverent atmosphere here Lord God Jesus will give you all the honor and all the praise in Jesus Christ's holy name the church said let's give the Lord I'm applause amen thank you lord thank you for that saith the Lord [Music] remember church that Jeremiah said when you're in Babylon it's time to come out of Babylon he said you'll seek me and find me when you seek me with all your heart let me want God to do that help them to seek help may God lead you to seek him with all your heart how many want that I don't know when but Lord I wanted to do that he said after seventy years be accomplished at Babylon I'll visit you and perform my good word to you cause you to return to this place Jerusalem for I know the thoughts that I think toward you says the Lord thoughts of peace and not of evil to give you an expected end then you should call upon me you should go and pray unto me and I will hearken unto you and you shall seek me and find me when you search for me with all your heart and I'll be found of you saith the Lord and I'll turn away your captivity and I will gather you from all the nations and from all the places whither I have driven you say at the Lord and I will bring you again in the place whence I caused you to be carried away captive praise God when you search for me with all your heart how many believe as thus saith the Lord other thing brother man was right when he said if you want a revival you got to cut everything out it's right there it's right there praise God hallelujah we have thus saith the Lord tonight what a blessing I'm glad I have more than thus saith the megachurch I'm glad I've got more than that brother very very thankful
