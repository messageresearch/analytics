[2:34] we preach here i think
[2:36] the more i uh understand about the bible
[2:39] and the context that the bible was
[2:41] written the more i appreciate the fact
[2:43] that we have a bible
[2:45] and the more i appreciate the fact that
[2:47] i was one of the chosen ones to hear the
[2:49] revelation of god
[2:52] hallelujah it's such a privilege
[2:54] colossians 1 verses 1 through 6.

[4:12] and
[4:13] i just hope we get such a heavenly
[4:14] atmosphere that we forget about the time
[4:16] that's what i'm kind of hoping that we
[4:17] go that direction like god's grace so
[4:20] again it's just a privilege to have the
[4:21] psalmist here god bless you richly and

[4:44] hallelujah so wonderful praise god
[4:46] so brother austin if you don't know
[4:47] that's my sister right there so she saw
[4:49] my worst you know as a sinner and now
[4:51] she sees my better as a christian
[4:54] and
[4:54] she's been a tremendous example and she
[4:56] loved brother dustin he's been a
[4:57] tremendous father and
[4:59] uh provider there for his family so and
[5:01] he's such a servant to the church back
[5:02] home he's a deacon at the church and
[5:03] lead songs and
[5:05] uh just uh
[5:06] i'm thankful that god saves families you
[5:08] know that's what i'm so thankful for you
[5:10] know that my own natural brothers and
[5:12] sisters can be my spiritual brothers and
[5:14] sisters it's just amazing and god's
[5:17] gonna do the same we're trusting god to
[5:18] do the same for your families and
[5:20] that's why we serve the lord you know as
[5:22] paul told that philippian jailer as for
[5:25] me and my house officer of the lord i'm
[5:26] sorry that's joshua although the
[5:28] philippian jailer believe on the lord
[5:29] jesus christ and thy and thy house shall
[5:31] be saved so we're just trusting that'll
[5:33] apply to us as well
[5:35] so let's look here to this book of uh
[5:36] colossians
[5:38] uh colossae i hope i'm saying that city
[5:40] right uh colossae was a uh was a very
[5:43] wealthy prosperous city
[5:46] it was on a trade route of course you
[5:48] know uh in those days you know
[5:50] connecting the middle east cities
[5:52] together it wasn't it's quite as big as
[5:54] ephesus or uh philippi other cities like
[5:57] that but it was it was a wealthy city
[5:59] and uh it was just a beautiful story
[6:02] uh paul never even visited
[6:05] colossae he never had a chance to visit
[6:07] there as far as history says
[6:09] but it didn't matter if the prophet
[6:11] visited or not
[6:13] because as long as somebody was carrying
[6:15] the prophet's message
[6:17] then god was going to direct his word
[6:20] to the elect saints praise god and so
[6:23] we're thankful we see a lot of that
[6:24] today
[6:25] and of course this is a prison
[6:27] uh letter paul wrote many of his letters
[6:30] you know at least 14 letters he wrote
[6:32] many of them were from prison
[6:35] and
[6:36] churches i hope we can just understand
[6:38] that if paul could write these things
[6:40] and experience some of these things
[6:42] while in chains
[6:44] and could pray the way he prayed in
[6:46] chains may god help us
[6:48] to pray more fervently and to labor and
[6:51] live such a life of revelation and the
[6:54] love of jesus christ that everybody can
[6:56] see it on our faces
[6:58] praise god if he could write some of
[6:59] these revelations and
[7:01] and uh expound on the revelation of
[7:04] jesus christ while in chains what could
[7:06] we do not being in chains
[7:09] praise the lord in other words we could
[7:11] be a city on a hill that could not be
[7:13] hidden we could be the salt of the earth
[7:15] praise god and we know we are by the
[7:17] grace of god so we're thankful for this
[7:18] prophet
[7:19] um so let's look at the uh
[7:22] i want to look at the purpose of the
[7:24] series remember you know we've been
[7:25] looking at i think this is the fourth
[7:27] uh letter we've looked at we preached
[7:29] right through galatians ephesians
[7:31] philippians now we're on colossians
[7:33] preached all the scriptures right
[7:34] through here why do we do this of course
[7:36] because uh brother branham had a vision
[7:38] he went beyond the curtain of time
[7:40] and uh he said well if this group goes
[7:43] in so will mine because i preach exactly
[7:46] the same word
[7:48] where paul baptized in jesus name
[7:51] i did too
[7:52] and millions screamed out we're resting
[7:55] on that
[7:56] now it's estimated today there's about
[7:58] 200 000 message believers so you can see
[8:00] how uh you know around the world so you
[8:02] can see how many of those people were
[8:04] from brother branham's day
[8:06] they've lived their lives they've gone
[8:07] on now to their eternal reward praise
[8:09] god
[8:10] but millions screamed out we are resting
[8:13] on the fact that brother branham
[8:15] preached the same gospel
[8:17] as paul praise god he said my if i'd
[8:20] only known this before
[8:22] i would make people come here now of
[8:23] course we know you can't make people
[8:24] come to everybody he was so zealous he
[8:26] like i would i'd do anything to make
[8:28] them come
[8:29] right you can't go beyond freemore
[8:30] agency
[8:32] he said they can't afford to miss this
[8:33] why lookie here so we're resting on the
[8:35] same word that paul preached because
[8:38] brother and preached the same revelation
[8:40] as paul
[8:41] and remember
[8:44] paul's revelation from jesus christ is
[8:46] the one and only judgment standard
[8:49] many people believe different things you
[8:51] know
[8:52] well i'm gonna i won't have to be judged
[8:54] you know i won't have to be judged
[8:56] because i'm saved that's actually
[8:58] contrary to the scripture
[8:59] the bible said we must all stand before
[9:02] the judgment seat of christ
[9:03] now if you're saved you and fill with
[9:05] the holy ghost you will not be judged
[9:07] unto condemnation
[9:09] but you will be judged for all the works
[9:11] that you did in this body
[9:13] praise god
[9:14] amen paul says that all of us will stand
[9:17] before the judgment seat of christ
[9:18] praise god
[9:19] and paul's gospel galatians ephesians
[9:22] philippians colossians corinthians you
[9:23] know you go through it philemon romans
[9:25] you go through all these letters this is
[9:26] the standard we'll all be judged by
[9:28] praise god hallelujah because the bible
[9:31] said there's a day
[9:32] when god will judge all of us by paul's
[9:35] gospel amen it's the revelation that
[9:38] jesus christ gave to paul praise god
[9:41] amen i'm glad we're not judged by a
[9:43] creed hallelujah
[9:45] i'm glad we're not judged by a website
[9:46] hallelujah amen i'm glad we're not
[9:49] judged by somebody else
[9:50] right i'm glad we're not judged by
[9:52] another preacher or another or grandma
[9:54] or grandpa i'm glad we all have the same
[9:56] judgment standard amen praise god we all
[9:58] know what we're going to be judged by
[9:59] praise god if i knew if i knew i was
[10:01] going to be judged or graded i want to
[10:02] read that rubric praise god that's why
[10:04] we read the bible praise god that's why
[10:06] you read it every day hallelujah amen
[10:08] because this is what you'll be judged by
[10:10] praise god this is the standard that we
[10:12] strive to live for
[10:15] amen
[10:16] i'm sorry i never i never clicked on
[10:18] sorry i got double clicks here because i
[10:19] can hardly see this phone you know so i
[10:21] gotta switch over so that's what we're
[10:23] resting on church we're resting on this
[10:25] uh scripture and many people don't know
[10:27] that i do do really do the homosexuals
[10:30] know that they'll be judged by paul's
[10:32] gospel
[10:33] do the women preachers know that they'll
[10:35] be judged by paul's gospel where paul
[10:37] says i do not suffer a woman to teach
[10:39] men
[10:40] do they know
[10:42] many of them do
[10:43] right many of them do very few of them i
[10:46] would say are ignorant because god makes
[10:48] himself known to all men so that all men
[10:50] and women are without excuse
[10:53] have they thought about it recently have
[10:54] they prayed about it have they have they
[10:57] pondered it because that will be the
[10:59] judgment standard praise god
[11:01] hallelujah
[11:02] and it's uh the word of god that jesus
[11:04] gave to paul
[11:06] amen
[11:07] now here
[11:09] we are resting on paul's gospel if we
[11:11] are rather we need to know what he said
[11:13] because remember he taught the whole
[11:15] council of god
[11:17] uh to the ephesians
[11:19] not part of the council
[11:21] uh uh not not half of the council he
[11:24] taught the whole council and from
[11:25] history remember he was there for three
[11:27] years so in other words if you had three
[11:29] years of a revival you could learn the
[11:31] whole gospel in three years amen
[11:34] hallelujah how long was jesus ministry
[11:36] amen three and a half years amen
[11:38] hallelujah you can learn it in three
[11:40] years you can learn the whole gospel
[11:42] in three years praise god and i just
[11:45] want to remind you churches we've been
[11:46] looking at that other series on doctrine
[11:48] so so many message people
[11:50] speak evil of doctrine like downgrade it
[11:52] they just must not study the bible
[11:54] because the bible says brother the bible
[11:56] says but we've gone through that
[11:58] recently but brother branham says
[12:00] uh someone has to rise up they've got to
[12:02] come it's thus saith the lord malachi
[12:05] the fourth chapter it's exactly what he
[12:07] said would be the sign just before the
[12:08] coming of the great and terrible day of
[12:10] the lord i'll send you elijah what will
[12:12] he do he'll turn the hearts of the
[12:14] children back to the doctrine of the
[12:15] fathers in other words the holy spirit
[12:18] will turn our hearts back to paul's
[12:19] gospel
[12:21] because that is doctrine doctrine means
[12:23] instruction praise god it means teaching
[12:25] and that's what paul said i'm a teacher
[12:27] to the gentiles amen hallelujah
[12:30] to bring them out of the power of
[12:32] darkness unto the power of god
[12:34] hallelujah
[12:35] out of these denominational difference
[12:37] and come back to the bible back to god
[12:41] that's what he said he would do notice
[12:42] the great time that we're living in uh
[12:44] you believe you're living in a great
[12:45] time
[12:46] this is a great time praise god remember
[12:48] brother man said if jesus would have
[12:49] asked me any time to live i'd i chose
[12:51] right at the end amen hallelujah that's
[12:54] where we're living right at the end amen
[12:56] hallelujah just a few more weary days
[12:58] and then hallelujah we're getting so
[13:00] close praise god amen
[13:02] it may be weeks maybe months maybe years
[13:05] maybe the next generation as well
[13:07] we don't know praise god but we're right
[13:09] at the end we're seeing the fulfillment
[13:11] of all these scriptures praise god amen
[13:13] hallelujah and we're seeing the maturity
[13:16] of the bride amen
[13:18] so paul said i did not
[13:20] shun to declare see there's something
[13:22] about a preacher now this is this is
[13:24] good it wasn't my notes preachers can
[13:26] either shun to tell you the truth or
[13:28] they can tell you the whole truth
[13:30] right and that's what denominational
[13:31] preachers are doing they're shunning to
[13:33] tell you the whole counsel of god
[13:35] they're not preaching the full word now
[13:37] we know some message churches are too
[13:38] right they're not preaching the full
[13:40] word of god they just go around and
[13:41] around god sent a prophet god sent a
[13:43] prophet god sent a prophet they just go
[13:44] around and around and around wandering
[13:46] in the wilderness but the prophet said
[13:48] you must possess the land
[13:50] you must be the joshua of your day amen
[13:53] and not just talk about the promises not
[13:55] but not just dream about them but
[13:56] experience them
[13:58] and that's what the baptism of the holy
[14:00] ghost does amen helps us experience the
[14:02] promises of god hallelujah
[14:05] for three years paul warned them and
[14:07] told them the whole counsel of god
[14:09] so you have counsel means purpose so you
[14:12] can learn god's purpose within three
[14:14] years
[14:15] praise god
[14:18] and so what a beautiful testimony that
[14:19] is church that uh my how long have we
[14:21] sat together brother brother of my since
[14:24] since 2020 or 2002 right so we've sat
[14:26] together almost 20 years maybe
[14:28] 2003 okay and praise god 19 years we sat
[14:30] together so he's heard the whole council
[14:32] so by
[14:33] but amen you've been with us a while now
[14:35] 2014 you've heard the whole council
[14:37] praise god amen because we've received
[14:39] the revelation of god
[14:41] now we've got to thank god that we've
[14:43] heard it but we also have to say lord
[14:45] help me to hear it again
[14:48] help me to grow in the understanding of
[14:50] the gospel
[14:51] because i'm still battling i still have
[14:53] sin in my members praise god and i still
[14:56] do things that i hate but i want to do
[14:58] that which is good praise god and i have
[15:00] two wars warring within me praise god
[15:03] now brother bran it's interesting
[15:04] brother you know with this thought about
[15:06] the whole council of god brother brahms
[15:08] accusers those who leave brother adam's
[15:10] message like believe the sign seek you
[15:12] the truth and if their spies are
[15:13] watching contact me if i hurt your
[15:15] feelings contact me don't contact
[15:16] somebody else contact me praise god show
[15:18] me your love show me that you really
[15:20] care about me
[15:21] he says uh they erroneously state
[15:24] uh that believers need only the four
[15:27] commands of acts 15. so uh remember when
[15:30] the church was transitioning from law to
[15:32] grace the apostles met and said what did
[15:33] we tell the gentiles and so they agreed
[15:35] let's talk things
[15:37] and so when we had the debate you know
[15:39] with them uh they were saying i was
[15:41] talking about you know women cutting
[15:42] hair and they shouldn't cut their hair
[15:44] the bible says that that and we
[15:46] shouldn't cross-dress
[15:47] and he basically said you know what
[15:48] about acts 15 there's only really four
[15:50] things we need to obey now isn't that
[15:52] isn't that such a sad statement church
[15:55] at the beginning there was four things
[15:57] before they could preach the whole
[15:59] council of god amen
[16:01] hallelujah notice the four things really
[16:03] dealt with two things food and
[16:05] fornication
[16:07] right
[16:08] so they're only given four things at the
[16:11] beginning praise god and i even said on
[16:13] the debate yes they needed four things
[16:16] right
[16:16] at the beginning but then paul came and
[16:19] gave them the whole counsel the whole
[16:21] purpose of jesus christ
[16:23] hallelujah so they asked me what are the
[16:25] only old testament laws and i gave the
[16:27] answer there's those four
[16:29] commands
[16:31] but it was only for a short time in
[16:34] transition because paul later says in
[16:36] galatians that jesus called him can you
[16:38] imagine jesus calling you out to a
[16:40] wilderness
[16:42] out to a desert jesus said don't stay
[16:44] there in the city paul come meet me out
[16:46] here in arabia
[16:48] hallelujah i want to spend time with you
[16:50] i want to fellowship with you out in the
[16:51] wilderness it may seem contrary why
[16:53] would you leave the church paul why are
[16:54] you leaving church because i want to
[16:56] give you a special revelation and this
[16:58] revelation will go to all the world and
[17:00] it will keep going all the world for 2
[17:02] 000 years
[17:04] so he couldn't trust it to him amongst
[17:06] other men with other ideas he had to
[17:08] have paul all alone to receive the
[17:10] revelation and now we've received that
[17:12] revelation praise god
[17:14] amen the full counsel of god
[17:17] now uh do they really believe do brother
[17:19] hammer's accusers really believe we only
[17:21] follow those four laws
[17:23] what about paul's other commands
[17:26] what about women preachers water baptism
[17:28] in the name of the lord jesus what about
[17:30] the mystery of god in christ how about
[17:32] bishops and deacon qualifications how
[17:34] about no required circumcision do they
[17:36] really believe that
[17:38] the five-fold ministry brings perfection
[17:40] to the church how about marriage
[17:42] commands they didn't mention that
[17:43] there's there's only food and
[17:44] fornication
[17:46] see how about then if you don't work you
[17:48] don't eat command
[17:50] how about gathering more with saints as
[17:52] you see that day approaching praise god
[17:54] hair lengths i mean we could go on and
[17:56] on those are the thoughts that came off
[17:58] the top of my head tonight all these
[17:59] commands see what is sad see what the
[18:02] when they leave the word they're leaving
[18:04] the whole council of god amen there it
[18:06] is right there they're forsaking their
[18:08] see that they're taking away from the
[18:10] counsel of god the bible said don't add
[18:12] and the boston bible said don't take
[18:14] away
[18:15] amen what they've done they've now taken
[18:17] away
[18:19] from the grace of god from the mind of
[18:21] god from the mind of christ
[18:23] and church they and you and i will be
[18:26] judged by that amen we'll be judged by
[18:28] the whole thing praise god
[18:31] preachers have started preaching as
[18:32] novices they'll be judged
[18:35] right they'll lose their reward
[18:37] they could they can still be saved of
[18:38] course right
[18:40] women that cut their hair brought shame
[18:41] to their husbands in christ and the
[18:43] father they'll be judged for that they
[18:44] might lose their reward no doubt they
[18:45] will lose their reward
[18:47] praise god
[18:48] women that dress immodestly if they are
[18:50] saved they'll lose they'll lose all
[18:52] their reward if they are saved because
[18:54] paul said dress modestly amen
[18:56] sometimes we forget church the power and
[18:59] the anointing that we have on us just to
[19:01] dress modestly amen i didn't hear you
[19:04] sometimes we forget that praise god amen
[19:06] that it takes the anointing to
[19:08] constantly live this life and all these
[19:10] commands praise god it takes the
[19:12] anointing in other words each day you
[19:14] must choose to put on christ
[19:17] because we've seen them now walk away
[19:18] they've been in our church they've left
[19:20] the message after 40 years in the church
[19:22] see they can choose to walk away that's
[19:24] because they've never been sealed in
[19:26] praise god but once you get sealed in
[19:28] you're sealed to the day of your
[19:29] redemption amen
[19:31] hallelujah
[19:32] how could we not rejoice in this now i'm
[19:34] going to skip past this i got it in my
[19:35] book but there's there's 14 or 15
[19:38] doctrines that when they leave the
[19:39] message they defy these doctrines
[19:42] and they'll be judged by it
[19:45] and what do they do they get under the
[19:47] spirit of jezebel with women preachers
[19:49] right they go under the spirit of lufts
[19:51] i've listened to some of those guys they
[19:53] love watching movies now with murders
[19:55] and uh fornications on them that's the
[19:57] spirit of lessons now
[19:58] see they leave and say they're free no
[20:00] they're not free from sin
[20:02] they're free from the anointing of god
[20:05] see they're under the spirit of pride
[20:08] they call themselves professors and
[20:10] walking bibles is what they let people
[20:11] call them they deny paul's gospel
[20:13] they're prideful they mock brother
[20:15] branham and other preachers
[20:17] they're deceivers saying there's only
[20:19] one work of grace and you've got the
[20:20] holy ghost as soon as you said a
[20:22] sinner's prayer
[20:23] you're filled with the holy ghost
[20:24] impossible praise god god doesn't work
[20:26] it like that praise god
[20:28] you got to really die out to self
[20:30] they're underlying spirits calling
[20:32] brother ram making all these assumptions
[20:35] about brother branham
[20:37] they they they instead of calling the
[20:39] catholic church to mother harlot they
[20:41] call her sister
[20:43] i'll tell you that's not my sister
[20:44] praise god my sister's here
[20:47] my sister's the holy ghost field church
[20:49] amen i didn't hear you praise god
[20:51] wherever she is amen whether napoleon or
[20:54] albion or iowa no matter where that holy
[20:57] ghost field church is that's my sister
[20:59] amen we can imagine they call the pope
[21:01] their sister and and
[21:02] they call our pope like rick warren our
[21:05] pope he ain't my pope praise god
[21:07] he ain't my father
[21:09] and they're under a lust spear with no
[21:11] modesty standards or little modesty
[21:13] standards and how about the unclean
[21:15] spirit of crossdressing these are all
[21:17] spirits of bondage whenever you leave
[21:19] the truth you become a slave to the evil
[21:22] spirit that drew you away from the truth
[21:25] hallelujah because it's not the holy
[21:27] spirit that takes away from the bible
[21:29] the holy spirit points to the bible
[21:31] praise god
[21:33] amen i know i'm going a long way to get
[21:34] the colossians but i know you can bear
[21:36] with me this is what come to me as i was
[21:37] praying and studying so i hope you enjoy
[21:39] it by god's grace
[21:40] i know you do
[21:42] okay i'm gonna go past that
[21:45] now let's look at the the background
[21:46] here now here's all apostles paul's
[21:48] epistles
[21:49] uh preach those three all the way
[21:51] through every verse so now we're on
[21:52] colossians so he had letters to churches
[21:55] to the hebrews and to brothers
[21:57] and then he had genera and these are
[21:59] general pistols these aren't paul's okay
[22:00] so just i'll just focus on these right
[22:02] here so paul had all those gospels and
[22:04] lord willing if the lord carries i want
[22:06] to preach all of paul's gospels
[22:08] lord willing by god's grace brother man
[22:10] preaching hebrews series so that i have
[22:11] a lot of the study on that one some of
[22:13] these though i gotta lean more upon you
[22:14] know history and and commentators
[22:16] because we don't have as many quotes on
[22:18] them right
[22:19] so uh
[22:20] you see we're we're trying to make our
[22:22] way through now i just want a background
[22:24] i preached on galatians in 2016
[22:26] ephesians i took a break there between
[22:29] 2016 i took a few years break and finish
[22:31] in april 2020 and then philippians we
[22:33] started it uh last year and finished it
[22:36] last year different number of parts
[22:39] i just want to rehearse a few important
[22:40] revelations church as a reminder this is
[22:43] what we've learned by the holy spirit
[22:45] and this is what we'll be judged by
[22:48] amen
[22:50] you're cursed to change paul's gospel
[22:52] which many churches are guilty of
[22:56] uh there's such a thing as spies that
[22:58] satan sends into churches in this case
[23:00] it was circumcision spies
[23:02] right just like satan sends spies in our
[23:04] church and we've got to preach them out
[23:06] praise god
[23:07] or pray him out that's what we did one
[23:08] time we pray out those evil spirits
[23:11] paul
[23:12] one preacher one prophet can con correct
[23:14] another we learn that
[23:16] no prophet is above correction
[23:19] now thus saith the lord is above
[23:20] correction but in their daily lives
[23:22] they're still men they're still going to
[23:24] sin they're going to still have a human
[23:25] side so their human side will still need
[23:27] corrected
[23:30] legalism frustrates grace
[23:33] churches can be bewitched back into
[23:35] legalism
[23:37] like the jezebel spirit right
[23:39] bewitched uh he taught us adoption what
[23:42] it means to be adopted to be baptized
[23:44] with the holy ghost and you grow into
[23:46] your adoption if you're born again
[23:48] you're already adopted and you're
[23:50] enjoying the blessings of being adopted
[23:52] now but the work is finished once you
[23:54] step into that theophany amen and you're
[23:56] fully adopted praise god
[23:59] paul said never lose your enthusiasm in
[24:01] 4 18.
[24:03] and it also saw how paul doubted some
[24:06] conversions in the galatian church
[24:09] that means that that means even paul as
[24:12] a prophet didn't know who was born again
[24:14] all the time can you imagine that
[24:15] he said you started off with with with
[24:18] faith and receiving the word and
[24:19] miracles why have you turned back the
[24:21] legalism
[24:23] see that's what we found too as we hang
[24:24] around the message long enough the word
[24:26] of god we find people i thought they
[24:27] were born again i found out later they
[24:29] weren't born again
[24:31] so it's okay to doubt people's
[24:33] conversion it's okay pray for them guide
[24:35] them point them to the word of god if
[24:37] they're god's elect they'll thank you
[24:39] for pointing them to the word of god
[24:41] amen
[24:42] hallelujah because the bible says you
[24:44] rebuke a wise man he'll love you praise
[24:46] god
[24:47] rebuke a foolish virgin they'll get
[24:48] upset and leave amen
[24:50] that's right that's i'm just
[24:51] paraphrasing that's the opposite it has
[24:53] to be the opposite praise god
[24:55] that's okay let him go
[24:57] god's good
[24:58] ephesians now let's look at some of
[25:00] these important ephesians we have church
[25:02] you and i have every spiritual blessing
[25:05] do not leave here if you need a
[25:07] spiritual blessing don't leave until you
[25:09] got it praise god
[25:10] or at least are sure you're going to get
[25:12] it i'm not promising every blessing here
[25:15] in the church remember today but i'm
[25:16] saying if you you should believe that
[25:18] everything you have need of is already
[25:20] been given to you praise god
[25:22] everything for your earthly journey is
[25:24] already inside you amen
[25:27] hallelujah
[25:29] now this was a growth area for me
[25:31] because i learned that every realm of us
[25:33] have a desire your flesh has desires
[25:36] your mind has desire so i desire to
[25:38] build that or dig that or i desire to
[25:40] write that but then your soul has
[25:43] desires and all three desires must be
[25:46] filtered by the word of god
[25:48] amen
[25:51] jesus blood broke down the middle wall
[25:53] partition so there's no more
[25:54] discrimination in the body of christ no
[25:56] matter the skin color no matter the age
[25:58] no matter anything no matter gender no
[26:01] matter what it is praise god the wall
[26:02] has been broken down and christ's body
[26:05] is a church praise god it's a
[26:07] multinational hallelujah generational
[26:10] worldwide body of believers and one
[26:12] thing they're known by that's their love
[26:15] hallelujah
[26:17] i also learned that we have intimacy of
[26:20] the mystery
[26:21] knowing the mystery of christ brings
[26:24] intimacy with god people say oh we don't
[26:26] need the mysteries shame on them they
[26:27] don't even know what they're talking
[26:28] about paul said the mystery brings
[26:30] intimacy with god
[26:32] so the more revelation you have of the
[26:34] mystery of god the more intimate your
[26:36] walk with god is that's why their walks
[26:38] aren't so intimate
[26:39] because they they deny the mystery of
[26:41] god
[26:43] and then we see the benefits of the fifo
[26:44] ministry i preach a lot on that but the
[26:46] new man versus the old man walk as wise
[26:49] not as fools and paul requested
[26:52] opportunities to declare the mystery of
[26:54] god
[26:56] now remember when we preached
[26:57] philippians part 1
[26:59] the very sermon we preached that that
[27:00] was when we brought the prayer club
[27:02] right here that's that was part one of
[27:03] the book of philippians i'm sometimes
[27:05] i'm going to make a memorial wall here
[27:06] and we're just going to hang up all of
[27:08] our memorials there praise god just like
[27:10] joshua amen he had to put up his
[27:11] memorials don't forget church this young
[27:13] generation can't forget that god is a
[27:15] miracle-working god
[27:18] amen
[27:19] but i always remember part one of
[27:20] philippians because that's when you come
[27:21] up for prayer for your daddy and god god
[27:23] god raised brother bang's faith all of
[27:25] our faith praise god to get that mighty
[27:27] miracle praise god in the midst of it
[27:28] amen
[27:29] i try to limit these to one slide by the
[27:31] way i also we also learned in
[27:33] philippians that we must pray to
[27:35] increase our discernment or judgment
[27:38] we can get more wise in other words we
[27:40] can get better at detecting sin
[27:43] we can get better at detecting
[27:45] righteousness as well praise god we also
[27:48] learned paul defended the gospel that's
[27:50] what i believe i've been called to do
[27:51] defend the gospel
[27:54] we also found christ's mind only was
[27:56] equal to god we don't have the full mind
[27:58] of christ all the time and the church
[28:00] said just look at the last week and see
[28:03] how you tried to make a decision and it
[28:04] didn't work out
[28:05] you don't always have the mind of christ
[28:07] right
[28:08] you have the holy ghost in your soul if
[28:10] you'll yield to that praise god but oh
[28:12] but jesus had the mind of god he alone
[28:15] was equal to god amen we have a portion
[28:17] of god but jesus is the image of god
[28:20] amen
[28:21] hallelujah
[28:24] epiphanies healing
[28:26] was god's mercy upon paul
[28:28] so when god heals our loved ones that's
[28:30] god's mercy to us
[28:33] we also learn enemies of the cross are
[28:35] dogs and their gods are their own
[28:37] beliefs they worship themselves
[28:40] right self-worshiping people
[28:43] he told us to rejoice always to be not
[28:45] anxious for anything and he said he
[28:48] learned contentment through christ
[28:50] shortly before his death
[28:52] if a man if a prophet can learn
[28:54] contentment as he's in his 50s or 60s
[28:56] then we should be able to learn things
[28:58] as we're in our growing years as well
[29:00] in other words the older we get we
[29:02] should still keep learning things about
[29:04] god
[29:06] let's not build denominations in fact
[29:08] that's the most dangerous thing is to
[29:09] build the denomination
[29:11] right to rally around our own thoughts
[29:13] or our own ideas everything we believe
[29:15] must be taken back to the word of god
[29:18] hallelujah now let's overview real
[29:20] briefly on the book of colossians here
[29:22] we'll look at a few verses here today by
[29:24] god's grace
[29:27] now overview here we see the outline is
[29:29] paul gives the greeting and thanksgiving
[29:31] from chapter 1 verse 1 to verse 12 and
[29:34] then he breaks this beautiful portion
[29:36] into the supremacy of christ
[29:39] and the two mysteries related to christ
[29:42] praise god one of them is the godhead
[29:44] the other is the baptism of the holy
[29:46] ghost amen
[29:48] oh in this book to this little city i'll
[29:50] say like that
[29:52] to this little city of course it was a
[29:54] prosperous city but it was a little city
[29:58] and then in chapter 2 verse 4 to 23
[30:01] paul denounces their false the false
[30:03] teachings that had entered into the
[30:05] church
[30:07] so see anyone who says we don't need
[30:09] teaching
[30:10] it would be the equivalent of taking the
[30:12] book of colossians and ripping out that
[30:13] whole book out of the bible
[30:15] oh we don't need teaching so let's rip
[30:17] it out
[30:18] in fact but paul's letter to teach them
[30:20] about the false teaching is what
[30:22] actually cleaned them out and brought
[30:24] them back into a personal intimacy with
[30:27] christ
[30:28] amen praise god
[30:30] that was in fact as we'll see here the
[30:32] whole purpose of the letter was to do
[30:34] that was to rebuke all the false
[30:36] teachers that had come up in the church
[30:38] amen hallelujah i tell you god's really
[30:40] protected our church praise god
[30:42] at one time i sat in here we had right
[30:44] here we had a minister's meeting with
[30:45] five other ministers that all come into
[30:47] our church
[30:48] right and i think by this time only one
[30:50] is preaching at this time
[30:53] and i think he's a little off that
[30:54] gentleman
[30:56] interesting
[30:57] interesting see many are called but few
[31:00] are chosen hallelujah amen
[31:03] many think they might have a call of
[31:04] many but the bible said make your
[31:07] calling an election sure hallelujah
[31:09] praise god amen
[31:11] that's what we must do we must seek the
[31:13] lord
[31:14] until we know his perfect will
[31:15] hallelujah
[31:17] so he denounced it and then he
[31:19] ends the letter by speaking of the
[31:21] christian life which is a beautiful
[31:22] portion we can't wait to preach that
[31:25] and uh and then gives the conclusion
[31:27] all right now church
[31:28] here's a picture of modern day colossae
[31:32] and i'm not talking about the houses
[31:33] down there i'm talking about that hill
[31:35] of dirt
[31:38] think about this for a moment
[31:41] paul was led in the holy spirit to write
[31:42] this letter he sent it there
[31:45] but today
[31:46] it's covered in dirt
[31:49] this city think about this that city
[31:50] that it had some of the whole glory it
[31:52] had some of the saints walking around
[31:54] filled with the holy ghost right in that
[31:55] city
[31:57] it was kind of this is a place where you
[31:59] know when you come in the presence of
[32:00] god you'll be standing on holy ground
[32:03] amen there are some saints there praise
[32:05] god this was a holy city but today 2000
[32:08] years later it's under dirt
[32:12] and it goes as a reminder for us church
[32:15] we must redeem the time amen
[32:18] the ways of this world will come and
[32:19] pass and the leaders will rise up and
[32:21] fall and source always change there's
[32:24] always going to be so much things going
[32:25] on the thing to do is know that heaven
[32:28] earth shall pass away but god's word
[32:30] will never pass away
[32:32] though the city's fallen the word of god
[32:34] sent to that city remains amen
[32:37] hallelujah same thing for ephesus
[32:39] there's only a few places left in
[32:41] ephesus that are actually excavated and
[32:43] you can see them because it was there
[32:45] for a while it only endured for a little
[32:48] season praise god but the bible says he
[32:50] that does the will of god liveth and
[32:53] abideth forever hallelujah amen
[32:56] hallelujah praise god
[32:58] colossae is a hundred miles east of
[33:00] ephesus
[33:02] 12 miles from laodicea modern-day turkey
[33:05] and it's a dirt pile today
[33:08] it's in ruins unexcavated i was
[33:09] listening to one doctorate you know
[33:11] historian he said they they've only just
[33:13] gone walked over the mound and they
[33:15] found pottery
[33:17] and it dates it back to about the time
[33:18] when it was you know
[33:19] uh when it was there in the days of uh
[33:22] the apostle paul and everything like
[33:23] that so right around 60 a.d
[33:27] they've never excavated it it's all
[33:29] buried
[33:31] in church let's say like this if the
[33:32] lord does tarry one day this church may
[33:34] not be here anymore
[33:36] praise god like you see down the street
[33:38] they had that church down there and some
[33:41] i don't
[33:42] want to be careful
[33:43] some unbeliever converted it into a
[33:45] shopping mall a church
[33:47] and it looks awful it looks like it's
[33:48] just it's a disgrace
[33:50] but it just goes to show revivals will
[33:52] only last as long as we want them to
[33:54] last
[33:55] ah
[33:56] but we as long as you want to have
[33:57] revival the bible says as long as you
[34:00] obey the word of god and overcome i will
[34:02] not take out the candlestick from among
[34:04] you but as long as you obey the word of
[34:06] god god's candlestick will remain in
[34:08] akron praise god
[34:09] amen amen napoleon is everywhere else
[34:12] where there's a real revival of god
[34:14] praise god
[34:15] amen
[34:17] remember you can have revival every day
[34:18] in your soul praise god you can have
[34:20] every day a revival in your mind where
[34:22] your mind is transformed to do the will
[34:24] of god
[34:26] praise god
[34:30] so we see it's not this is not colossal
[34:33] glossy this is glossy
[34:36] a mound of dirt
[34:39] a mods i think it's amazing here's a
[34:40] picture so you get an idea there's
[34:42] ephesus there's laodicea there's
[34:44] colossae
[34:46] classic so there was a trade route of
[34:47] course that connected all these you know
[34:48] went back over here and then of course
[34:50] down south here would be israel you know
[34:52] the syria over here turkey syria and
[34:54] then israel down here
[34:57] so here's where we get the uh this
[34:59] thought here now the word kolasi is a
[35:02] is a derivative somehow of the the term
[35:04] purple wool reminds you of lydia right
[35:07] sell her purple where's lydia there she
[35:08] is seller of purple one of these days
[35:10] she's going to put out some something
[35:11] purple
[35:13] she probably already has actually
[35:15] when she's a little one
[35:18] but that's how cities were known cities
[35:20] were named after what made them
[35:21] prosperous
[35:22] so colossae uh was as a form of purple
[35:25] woe
[35:26] and it was important stop on this major
[35:28] trade route now church what's amazing
[35:31] this city was destroyed by an earthquake
[35:34] in between 60 and 62 a.d so that is a
[35:38] pile of earthquake dirt right there
[35:42] and it was less than a decade
[35:46] after hearing the letter from the
[35:48] apostle paul
[35:51] paul died between 64 and 68 a.d under
[35:56] nero
[35:58] so let's let's understand
[36:01] let me say like this is there anything
[36:04] that is uh insignificant in god's eyes
[36:07] is there any believer here is there any
[36:09] child that god is not paying attention
[36:11] to no
[36:12] how can we prove that because this city
[36:15] was in its all of its glory all the
[36:17] purple wool they were selling they're
[36:19] making big money building buildings but
[36:21] god knew it was going to fall in less
[36:23] than 10 years but god in his rich grace
[36:26] he said every soul in there is
[36:27] significant i'm still going to send them
[36:30] thus saith the lord i'm still going to
[36:32] send them the word of god because i care
[36:34] and i love them even though destruction
[36:36] is coming amen i'm still going to send
[36:38] the word to all my believers because i
[36:41] love them and the word will set them
[36:43] free hallelujah
[36:44] i don't know how many colossians died in
[36:46] that earthquake i don't know if the holy
[36:48] spirit led them out like he did
[36:49] jerusalem in 80 70. we don't know
[36:53] history doesn't say but what we do know
[36:55] is that god cared so much he had his
[36:58] prophet write a letter in rome in prison
[37:00] glory and send it with uh with a couple
[37:03] of atticus and different men and said
[37:05] send this letter there god knew it was
[37:07] going to be destroyed but god knew
[37:09] despite destruction coming god knew the
[37:12] saints would want the word of god to
[37:14] deliver them to seal them he'd want them
[37:16] to know the godhead amen he want them to
[37:18] know about the baptism of the holy ghost
[37:20] that's how much god cares and no matter
[37:23] how many days we have or decades we have
[37:25] or or generations we have i want you to
[37:28] know god cares and god is sending you
[37:30] his word today
[37:31] amen
[37:33] let me say it like this ain't just one
[37:34] word it's the whole council of god amen
[37:38] hallelujah
[37:39] but as far as we know they got one or
[37:41] two letters history says they got the
[37:43] letter to the colossians and they got
[37:45] philemon's letter
[37:46] that's all they got
[37:49] and look what we got
[37:50] now what are we spending our time with
[37:51] praise god we should be spending our
[37:53] time in paul's gospel
[37:55] don't you think
[37:58] the last letters before destruction
[38:00] before an earthquake
[38:02] crumbles the whole city
[38:04] but what was god what was was god
[38:06] merciful or not of course he was he sent
[38:08] his word there before destruction came
[38:10] amen
[38:12] remember the opposite was true uh in
[38:14] laodicea uh well i should say the
[38:16] opposite let me say this let me reword
[38:17] that
[38:18] laodicea also had many earthquakes but
[38:21] each time they re rebuilt the city of
[38:23] laodicea i don't know if you knew that
[38:24] by history
[38:25] but laodicea also had numerous
[38:27] earthquakes in this area and each time
[38:29] the city fell they'd rebuild it but not
[38:32] colossae
[38:33] something about colossae maybe it was
[38:34] too small i know maybe it was
[38:36] insignificant you can tell they built
[38:37] one behind it
[38:40] but for some reason they never rebuilt
[38:42] this so this was the only chance of this
[38:44] city to receive the word of god and so
[38:47] god made sure glory god made sure he
[38:49] sent his word to all those that loved
[38:51] the word all those that would receive it
[38:53] in other words paul knew all that the
[38:55] father has given me will come to me
[38:57] praise god
[38:58] amen we can rest assured that god knows
[39:01] the events of history god orchestrates
[39:03] the events of history praise god and he
[39:05] directs his word to all those who love
[39:07] the living word of god
[39:10] oh glory
[39:11] so see church in my spiritual mind
[39:12] brother amen sometimes i look and look
[39:14] well there's a pile of actor and dust
[39:16] right there that could be akron
[39:17] right
[39:20] akron is falling apart you should be the
[39:21] rubber industry you know capital of the
[39:22] world now it's falling apart you drive
[39:24] down there by dustin you're gonna see a
[39:25] lot of abandoned rubber buildings and
[39:26] companies it's falling apart
[39:28] now of course they're trying to rebuild
[39:29] certain areas like the university and
[39:30] everything like that
[39:32] but it shows how man uh gloria the bible
[39:34] said man has no continuing city here
[39:37] praise god
[39:38] we're not trusting in akron we're not
[39:39] trusting in the local government praise
[39:41] god we're not trusting in the federal
[39:43] government we're not trusting in the
[39:44] state government praise god we're
[39:46] trusting in the unfailing unchanging
[39:48] eternal immortal word of god
[39:51] hallelujah that's what's going to
[39:52] sustain our lives that's what we're
[39:54] trusting in amen and as long as we have
[39:56] that we've got everything
[39:58] all right
[39:59] if you don't get your uh yeah if you
[40:01] don't get your tax return on time or
[40:03] something like that don't don't be
[40:04] discouraged as long as you've got god's
[40:06] word you've got everything
[40:09] get a return this year don't don't fret
[40:11] as long as you've got god's word that's
[40:12] the most important thing
[40:14] hallelujah
[40:16] thank the lord
[40:21] now we're going to get to this in a
[40:21] little bit but i just want to look at
[40:23] the blue here you know it's 12 miles
[40:24] from laodicea
[40:27] it's it's apparent that epiphyse now
[40:29] other people pronounce that different
[40:31] epiphyses was actually the founder of
[40:33] the church
[40:35] the prophet himself never visited
[40:37] colossae
[40:39] as far as i know the prophet never
[40:40] preached in akron either
[40:42] right or napoleon you just try to try to
[40:45] understand church to me this makes the
[40:47] bible more real
[40:49] this makes me feel like brother ashley
[40:50] like i was one of the colossians i never
[40:52] got to meet the prophet but i heard his
[40:54] message amen i don't know yet i received
[40:57] this message and it has transformed my
[40:59] life amen
[41:01] because that's what does the
[41:02] transformation a man doesn't transform
[41:04] you yes he's a burning shining light but
[41:06] then he
[41:07] fizzles out for a season and the church
[41:09] said like john the baptist that man's a
[41:12] burning shining light he goes off the
[41:13] scene but jesus is the eternal light
[41:15] amen
[41:16] and you can't shut him off praise god
[41:18] his light can't go down he's the light
[41:20] of the world amen
[41:22] he's the light of men the bible says
[41:24] hallelujah
[41:26] nothing can hinder the lord jesus christ
[41:32] so epiphys
[41:33] it's likely they say history wise that
[41:36] eperfus was from
[41:37] uh colossae and he heard paul preaching
[41:40] at some other location
[41:42] and then he heard the message glory and
[41:44] he took it to his hometown
[41:46] hallelujah praise god that's exactly
[41:48] right that's what betsy and dustin and
[41:49] cam all did there they heard the message
[41:51] they took it to their hometown amen we
[41:53] still got a few fish over there by god's
[41:55] grace amen some have come some have
[41:56] fallen away but that's what you do you
[41:58] take it to your own town praise god you
[42:00] take it to your people and all that the
[42:02] father has given me will come to me
[42:03] praise god but i say like this everybody
[42:05] deserves a chance to hear the word of
[42:06] god
[42:08] that's right
[42:09] now let's look at a little more
[42:10] background here
[42:14] they never saw paul's face i'm going to
[42:15] read colossians 2 verse 1. they never
[42:18] saw paul's face just to kind of give you
[42:19] an understanding
[42:23] remember church has returned i told you
[42:24] that testimony there's that brother jack
[42:26] uh from albie and he's still alive he's
[42:28] 94 i think
[42:30] he's on his third wife because he's
[42:31] outlived his two wives they've died and
[42:33] he just married another one yes
[42:35] and uh cam and i preached over there
[42:37] years ago together with brother jim and
[42:39] and he he saw brother brandon's meetings
[42:43] he saw brother discern when he was a
[42:44] young man that's how i come to know the
[42:45] message he come up to cam and i after
[42:47] one of the services and he said i want
[42:49] to tell you he said you're more blessed
[42:50] than i am
[42:52] i said no brother i said no you're more
[42:53] blessed look at you god has blessed your
[42:54] life you know and you got to see the
[42:56] prophet he said no but i've got
[42:58] scripture for it brother jesse
[42:59] he said it's the same uh same scripture
[43:02] jesus told doubting thomas you know
[43:04] he said and he said see i saw the
[43:06] prophet he said and i believe he said
[43:09] but you never saw the prophet yet you
[43:11] believe and he said jesus said it's more
[43:13] blessed uh to just receive it if you
[43:15] have not seen it praise god now i'm
[43:18] cutting up that scripture so forgive me
[43:19] i haven't recorded that one lately but
[43:20] you know what i mean you're more blessed
[43:22] if you haven't seen everything and yet
[43:24] you still believe the revealed word of
[43:27] god oh we sing that song about being
[43:29] blessed amen church i hope we know we're
[43:31] blessed amen it doesn't matter what men
[43:33] we've seen naturally with our natural
[43:35] eyes it matters if we've seen the holy
[43:37] spirit working in our midst and obeying
[43:39] his voice and obeying his word that's
[43:41] what matters that's what counts
[43:44] colossians 2 verse 1
[43:47] for i would that ye knew what great
[43:49] conflict i have for you and for them at
[43:51] laodicea and for as many as have not
[43:53] seen my
[43:54] face in the
[43:56] flesh
[43:58] paul had never met them
[44:00] but he still i still have a conflict for
[44:02] you i still have a burden for you i'm
[44:04] still praying and wrestling in prayer
[44:07] to help you overcome how many grateful
[44:08] for that praise god
[44:11] first that's why we can know saints uh
[44:13] and and hear about them and not even not
[44:15] even ever see them but we can still pray
[44:18] for them
[44:19] like we saw with jose's friend right we
[44:20] never we're never gonna meet half these
[44:21] people that we pray for from jose we
[44:23] send all these prayer prayer cloths and
[44:25] everything we're never gonna meet them
[44:26] until we get to the other side
[44:28] praise god
[44:29] now there's a scripture in here this
[44:31] book i don't have the exact one but
[44:32] colossians says where i'm with you in
[44:34] the spirit
[44:37] so there's something about when a saint
[44:39] is alive on the earth
[44:41] now this is i'm going to lay this out
[44:42] here a little bit hopefully you can
[44:44] hopefully everybody catches this it's
[44:45] very simple but
[44:47] while saints alive paul said i can be
[44:50] with you in the holy spirit even though
[44:52] i'm not there i mean i believe that
[44:54] but something must change when a saint
[44:56] dies
[44:58] right
[44:59] or
[45:00] or if that's not true then we would say
[45:02] brother branham's spirit is here now we
[45:04] know there's a move that believes that
[45:07] and that's spiritualism
[45:09] right
[45:10] isn't that something so while you're
[45:12] alive glory amen
[45:14] while you're alive my spirit can be a
[45:16] napoleon
[45:17] and i i'll be right here praise god
[45:19] you understand
[45:21] their their spirit can be here and yet
[45:23] they can be in napoleon
[45:26] there's something about the unity of the
[45:27] saints amen like when we pray we can
[45:30] just pray i know uh i know god's gonna
[45:32] bless the church services today napoleon
[45:34] and god's gonna bless the the services
[45:35] there in albion and up there and
[45:36] sheffield i know god's gonna bless him
[45:38] there's something about while we're
[45:39] alive our spirit can be present there
[45:42] through the holy spirit
[45:44] that's a great mystery i'm not trying to
[45:45] explain it today i'm just letting you
[45:46] know what's in the bible
[45:48] right but as soon as that person dies
[45:50] god told moses i'm sorry god told joshua
[45:53] moses my servant is dead
[45:56] praise god and then that that ends that
[46:00] right because now they're not
[46:01] joshua wasn't saying where's moses i
[46:03] feel moses presence here that's not what
[46:05] happened but it said jesus christ amen
[46:08] the captain of the host came and
[46:09] revealed himself to joshua amen and he
[46:12] said that i'm the captain of the lord's
[46:14] host praise god see the eyes were off
[46:15] the man the prophet went off the scene
[46:18] so now the eyes are fully on christ
[46:20] jesus
[46:22] something about that just struck me
[46:23] today as i was driving to church
[46:24] something about that
[46:26] we can be present there with somebody
[46:29] else even though we're here
[46:31] but yet when we pass
[46:32] that's over
[46:35] praise god we ain't starting any
[46:36] superstitions this morning
[46:38] well maybe brother branham is here maybe
[46:40] maybe he can preach for us
[46:42] nonsense
[46:44] nonsense
[46:45] maybe brother brown can do the wedding
[46:47] maybe brother that that's what they do
[46:49] right maybe brother brown can dedicate
[46:51] the preachers and the babies
[46:53] no
[46:54] not anymore not anymore
[46:57] see it's a lack of understanding
[47:00] and it's uh like the bible said a
[47:01] deceiving spirit i don't know the bible
[47:03] says that
[47:04] deceiving spirits is so close but yet
[47:07] it's so far away
[47:10] it'll be so close it deceived the very
[47:12] elected if it were possible
[47:16] so i hope that's a help by god's grace
[47:18] like that brother remember that brother
[47:19] austin who's helped us out from england
[47:22] remember i read that email on wednesday
[47:24] yeah
[47:25] who who really helped you out
[47:27] he said i'm there with you in the spirit
[47:29] and i first i didn't i didn't believe it
[47:30] but now i believe it because the bible
[47:32] says it
[47:34] he can be there in england but yet
[47:36] somehow through the holy spirit he's
[47:37] here today
[47:40] i'm just telling you the bible
[47:42] of course we won't worry about that we
[47:43] won't think about that but i'm just
[47:44] letting you know there's something about
[47:46] the unity of the holy spirit
[47:48] that people even can watch our sermons
[47:49] right they can watch our sermons on
[47:51] youtube or our videos on youtube and
[47:52] they can feel the presence of god
[47:55] right because god comes and anoints his
[47:57] word amen there's just something about
[47:59] it how god's spirit is just it's beyond
[48:02] boundaries amen hallelujah
[48:04] and he's able to touch lives through the
[48:07] same love and the same power the same
[48:09] word praise god
[48:11] it doesn't matter if we see their face
[48:12] or not our prayers are effective amen
[48:15] hallelujah our fervent prayers are very
[48:19] effective and effectual and they will
[48:21] prevail aren't you glad your prayers are
[48:23] heard and they will prevail
[48:25] hallelujah
[48:27] amen
[48:29] don't have to be there as long as god's
[48:31] there
[48:32] somehow with yours the holy spirit there
[48:33] and your spirit somehow you can be there
[48:36] but physically you don't have to be
[48:37] there
[48:39] that's really something
[48:41] now let's move on here i just thought
[48:42] i'd drop that in there so
[48:44] i'm expecting more revelation on that
[48:45] just so you guys know so after a few
[48:47] decades or whatever you know we'll see
[48:48] see if god dropped down some more
[48:49] revelation like he does he does that
[48:51] many times
[48:54] so while at ephesus paul sent epiphus as
[48:57] an apostle to the lycius valley or lycus
[49:00] valley in turkey and he established the
[49:02] church in colossae
[49:04] so it wasn't paul that started this
[49:06] church it wasn't the prophet that
[49:08] started this church it was another
[49:09] member in the five full ministry was it
[49:11] any less of a church
[49:14] did it have any less of the word well
[49:15] we'd say no because it had the
[49:16] revelation that they gave in there
[49:19] so see never looked down on ourselves
[49:21] never feel bad because we didn't know
[49:22] brother branham i don't feel bad
[49:24] so i've got the same holy spirit praise
[49:26] god
[49:27] they're like who are they they ask me
[49:28] who are you to uh uh understand brother
[49:31] man's opinions and his bible teachings i
[49:33] said i'm nobody but i said the same holy
[49:35] spirit that was in him is in me praise
[49:37] god amen it has to be that way praise
[49:39] god
[49:41] it has to be that way
[49:43] or else we're all if that's not the case
[49:45] then we have no discernment we have no
[49:47] understanding we have no gifts of
[49:49] ourselves but my bible says the gifts
[49:51] and callings of god are without
[49:53] repentance and my bible says the gifts
[49:55] of god are given to every man to profit
[49:57] with all
[49:59] amen
[50:00] and i had a man this week i don't know
[50:02] if i'd heard you told you this brother
[50:03] bang i demand this week he's almost done
[50:04] reading my book my long one not the
[50:06] short one the long one
[50:08] because i know it's hard to do that i
[50:09] know
[50:10] we're reading through it now it's like
[50:11] well it's a long book here
[50:12] at our house
[50:14] but he's almost done with my book he was
[50:17] so moved he went and got baptized by
[50:18] brother craig last sunday
[50:21] yep
[50:22] and he said uh he said he put a
[50:24] testimony there and said every church
[50:27] every christian should read this book
[50:28] now we know it's not going to happen but
[50:30] every predestinated christian will
[50:32] amen if they want to know the mystery of
[50:34] god
[50:34] and if that will be a help to them a
[50:36] long life's journey every christian
[50:38] that's predestinated we'll hear the word
[50:39] of god
[50:40] just like this a a a small church in
[50:42] colossae
[50:44] still receives the word of god
[50:46] can you imagine
[50:47] tickias he had this satchel around him
[50:49] and he had two letters in there that
[50:51] were just paper but that paper
[50:54] represented the mind of christ amen and
[50:56] and throughout maybe maybe he had rain
[50:58] on the journey maybe he had storms on
[51:00] the journey but god was protecting his
[51:02] word church let me tell you god is
[51:04] protecting his word god is protecting
[51:06] you god's will will be accomplished
[51:09] nothing can stop god hallelujah
[51:12] nothing can stop god god's word is going
[51:14] to find all those who want to hear it
[51:16] amen
[51:17] hallelujah his love is irresistible
[51:19] praise god
[51:20] his glory is magnificent praise god his
[51:23] ways are past finding out his ways are
[51:26] higher than our ways amen
[51:28] hallelujah nothing can stop our god
[51:32] how many can say amen to
[51:34] that hallelujah
[51:37] there's nothing to fear
[51:39] jesus is here
[51:42] this was a church of diverse ethnic
[51:45] backgrounds
[51:46] just wasn't all
[51:48] uh wasn't all those from turkey
[51:51] they had phrygians which was central
[51:53] turkey
[51:54] greeks which was from greece
[51:57] and jews
[51:59] this was a multi-ethnic
[52:01] church kind of like ours praise god
[52:04] amen i love it small church but had all
[52:07] kinds of different ethnic backgrounds
[52:11] and so epiphanes went there
[52:14] started the church but he come back and
[52:16] saw paul and let him know about all the
[52:19] heresies that were coming among them
[52:22] they started out on fire but then
[52:24] heresies come in how many know church we
[52:27] can't get lazy
[52:30] how many know you can't let yourself
[52:31] cool down
[52:33] don't cool down don't relax don't relax
[52:35] on your bible reading don't relax on
[52:37] your prayer stay close to the holy one
[52:39] praise god
[52:40] if you leave from his protection the
[52:42] tempter is going to get you
[52:44] don't leave beyond the protection of
[52:46] that word stay behind the word stay
[52:48] intimate with jesus amen
[52:51] stay intimate but see this proves in
[52:54] every church there's going to be strong
[52:55] ones and there's going to be weak ones
[52:57] may we all make it our hearts desire to
[52:59] be determined to be always strong always
[53:02] about the father's business amen
[53:04] hallelujah
[53:05] but some people in this colossian church
[53:07] are starting to receive doctrines about
[53:09] angels you can worship angels we're
[53:11] going to get to it
[53:13] kind of what they do today they worship
[53:14] brother brown the seventh angel right
[53:16] see and there's always a connection
[53:18] somehow
[53:19] always
[53:23] also in colossians you read about how
[53:25] some people are exalting holidays
[53:27] above what they should be
[53:29] and somewhere looking down well you
[53:30] celebrate this holiday you don't and
[53:32] paul said these are just all shadows of
[53:34] christ
[53:36] and then he said in romans if that's a
[53:37] holy day to you let it be a holy day to
[53:38] you but don't discourage that person
[53:40] right don't let your good be evil spoke
[53:42] enough
[53:44] see all these problems that creep into
[53:46] churches so what do we got to do god's
[53:48] testing us
[53:49] are we going to get critical and fight
[53:51] are we going to be loving and let the
[53:53] holy spirit get the victory
[53:56] i mean fight carnally we we fight
[53:58] spiritually by praying okay i'm trying
[54:01] trying to be right down the middle i
[54:02] hope you understand it by god's grace
[54:05] so see all these things that has started
[54:06] creeping in the church and the church is
[54:08] only going to last for another decade
[54:09] but god was so concerned even within the
[54:12] last 10 years of the church i'm going to
[54:14] send the word i'm going to send the
[54:15] revelation and it's going to help all
[54:17] the predestinated
[54:19] amen
[54:20] church i hope by now that you know
[54:22] you're part of the predestination
[54:24] hallelujah you are predestinated god
[54:26] chose the time and the place for you to
[54:29] receive the word of god
[54:30] it was a uh it was a
[54:32] special uh predestinated event
[54:35] god foreknew it god had it waiting there
[54:38] just for you praise god just like that
[54:39] woman at the web praise god jesus going
[54:41] about a regular business but here comes
[54:43] jesus i have a need to go there praise
[54:44] god you had a need to hear the word of
[54:46] god you had a need to go to akron praise
[54:48] god university of akron you had a need
[54:50] to meet all these different people
[54:52] because there was god there behind it
[54:54] revealing himself to you and you had to
[54:56] make sure that you make it no matter
[54:58] what the future holds you had to make
[55:00] sure you heard the word of god that you
[55:01] can manifest yourself as a child of god
[55:05] amen
[55:10] so now let's pick up your bibles let's
[55:12] go to colossians chapter one
[55:16] let me preach a few minutes in here i
[55:17] got about eight minutes left on my hour
[55:18] here so usually i go a little bit past
[55:21] that
[55:24] and i have lost track of the time so
[55:26] that's good that's good
[55:29] hallelujah
[55:31] remember church millions screamed out
[55:33] were resting on the fact that brother
[55:35] branham preached the book of colossians
[55:38] now if you know does anybody know his
[55:39] most famous sermon preached out of
[55:40] colossians anybody know it
[55:43] christ is the
[55:45] mystery of god reveal
[55:47] his text is colossians chapter one it's
[55:48] a godhead sermon right it's like a three
[55:50] hour sermon
[55:51] i preached on it years ago just slowly
[55:53] through it
[55:56] christ is the mystery of god revealed
[55:58] is the main text brother ram draws out
[56:00] of here
[56:02] and apparently if you understand this
[56:03] now church apparently there's some
[56:05] churches this was a church that needed
[56:07] help on the godhead
[56:09] right what did the corinthians need help
[56:11] on gifts
[56:13] right marriage and divorce
[56:16] uh brothers that were sleeping around
[56:18] the church
[56:19] right
[56:21] see every church had a different need
[56:22] but god had all these churches that had
[56:24] all these different needs and then he
[56:26] had one man paul
[56:27] to write the letters and direct and give
[56:29] them the whole council of god god aren't
[56:30] you glad yours
[56:32] and even the ephesian church they
[56:34] weren't perfect they were more mature
[56:35] but they weren't perfect they needed
[56:37] help with the five full ministry
[56:39] they needed help with marriage and
[56:40] marriage and husbands wives and children
[56:42] how to how to obey the parents right
[56:45] the armor of god
[56:47] right because remember the
[56:48] thessalonicans they got the armor of god
[56:50] too in thessalonians chapter 5.
[56:53] so there's going to be different needs
[56:54] in our church
[56:56] now as time goes on church i hope you
[56:58] can see which kind of church we are
[57:01] i haven't thought about until recently
[57:03] but this was a church that needed the
[57:04] godhead
[57:06] ephesian church needed the more family
[57:08] life
[57:09] corinthians needed gifts they were real
[57:11] fanatical real emotional everything was
[57:13] an emotion everything everything was a
[57:15] revelation everything was this or that
[57:16] or the other
[57:18] right
[57:19] clean living
[57:21] galatians were into legalism
[57:23] they were a legalistic church
[57:25] doesn't that help you out
[57:27] you see my there's different churches
[57:28] and each one has different needs but we
[57:30] have the benefit of not just getting one
[57:32] letter we have the benefit of all the
[57:33] letters
[57:35] and we have the benefit to hear the
[57:37] mystery of god finished in this day we
[57:39] have the benefit of getting our hearts
[57:41] turned back to paul's heart
[57:43] amen hallelujah
[57:45] we have this benefit
[57:48] okay so give me a few more minutes here
[57:49] by god's grace colossians chapter 1 uh
[57:51] verse 1.
[57:55] paul an apostle of jesus christ by the
[57:57] will of god and timotheus our brother
[57:59] now i brought just in my notes i just
[58:01] brought out this thought by the will of
[58:03] god
[58:05] each one of you are doing something by
[58:07] the will of god
[58:09] like i thought about emma working there
[58:10] at her job she's there by the will of
[58:12] god
[58:13] she has a work to do on her job
[58:15] praise god lydia does too they're out
[58:17] there written orchards
[58:19] she has by the will of god she's called
[58:21] to that place
[58:23] so are you brother bang you're called to
[58:24] that job
[58:25] by the will of god
[58:27] right
[58:29] each one of us
[58:30] god has made his will known to us
[58:34] and then we obey the will of god
[58:37] how do we know god's will like the bible
[58:39] said it was a personal revelation of
[58:41] jesus christ
[58:44] so somehow god let us know like austin i
[58:46] talk about this all the time different
[58:47] signs right we're looking for signs is
[58:49] this the right thing is this right is
[58:50] this going to be blessed right that's
[58:52] that's that's that's christianity
[58:54] we're trying to understand the bible
[58:56] said work out your own salvation with
[58:58] fear and trembling amen
[59:00] the bible said take it serious
[59:02] be very careful what you
[59:04] decide to do in the will of god for your
[59:06] life
[59:08] but paul knew i'm a preacher by the will
[59:10] of god
[59:12] and so how do we know the bible said
[59:14] prove all things in other words each
[59:17] decision in life must be taken to the
[59:19] spot where you can prove it was this
[59:20] god's will or was it not god's will
[59:23] did i obey the will of god for this area
[59:25] or did i disobey for this area
[59:28] now church that should be important to
[59:29] all of us
[59:30] because which one of us want to walk in
[59:32] the permissive will of god and get
[59:34] spanked
[59:36] right that's what the word uh the bible
[59:38] says in uh hebrews 12 he chastens every
[59:41] son
[59:42] chastened means beat or hit so that is a
[59:44] scriptural term right spanking
[59:47] when we purposely disobey and leave the
[59:49] perfect will of god like jonah or like
[59:52] brother branham right or ever we can all
[59:54] put our names there
[59:56] we're going to get corrected
[59:58] but the idea is to do things by the will
[1:00:00] of god
[1:00:02] and prove the bible said you can prove
[1:00:04] it when you have a transformed mind you
[1:00:06] can prove that this is god's will
[1:00:09] amen
[1:00:11] so especially as our young ones get
[1:00:12] older ones now and teenagers and they're
[1:00:14] gonna get to these marriage years it's
[1:00:16] the second greatest decision in your
[1:00:18] life
[1:00:19] thank god you made the greatest decision
[1:00:21] nelson great great thank god for that
[1:00:23] but now you got the second greatest
[1:00:24] coming up here
[1:00:25] you too emma and lydia maokai
[1:00:28] i'm out guys shaking said like no
[1:00:30] oh no no you are buddy
[1:00:33] don't don't doubt that buddy
[1:00:35] one of these days is going to turn like
[1:00:36] craig craig's like i'm never going to
[1:00:37] get married he didn't have the desire
[1:00:39] and all of a sudden he's got the i got
[1:00:40] to get married you better know what i'm
[1:00:42] talking about
[1:00:45] but these are major
[1:00:47] decisions these are not minor
[1:00:49] major
[1:00:51] so some of us thank god we've already
[1:00:52] made the right decision by the will of
[1:00:54] god and we can see god has guided us
[1:00:57] it's simple but it must be approached
[1:00:59] very reverently
[1:01:02] through much prayer
[1:01:03] waiting upon the lord counsel from
[1:01:06] parents right
[1:01:08] counsel from preachers if needed it's by
[1:01:11] the will of god
[1:01:13] let me tell you i didn't come to akron
[1:01:14] by my own will
[1:01:16] i don't want to come here it was the
[1:01:18] only scholarship i had and i don't even
[1:01:19] know there was a city called akron but
[1:01:21] god had a vang laying over here god had
[1:01:23] a predestinated seed
[1:01:24] hua right and brother austin and brother
[1:01:26] amen and god had all these predestinated
[1:01:29] seeds over here praise god
[1:01:31] it wasn't by my will
[1:01:33] it was by god's will
[1:01:35] how did your family even get over here
[1:01:37] god sent the american army to bring
[1:01:39] uh
[1:01:40] your people the hmong people from laos
[1:01:42] to avoid a genocide and brought them to
[1:01:44] akron praise god amen
[1:01:47] hallelujah praise god knows how to
[1:01:49] direct this word amen
[1:01:50] it's by the will of god hallelujah
[1:01:54] just let me refresh that to your
[1:01:56] thinking that we must each day in each
[1:01:59] great decision we must approach the
[1:02:01] throne of grace and know it is the will
[1:02:03] of god to do this
[1:02:09] i'm gonna get back to remember when i i
[1:02:10] didn't know if i should pastor this
[1:02:11] church or not it was when tim myers had
[1:02:13] left and uh like i told you how would it
[1:02:16] be different here if tim myers were
[1:02:17] still here
[1:02:19] y'all wouldn't be either here or you
[1:02:20] wouldn't believe the message anymore
[1:02:22] right i say that with love and respect
[1:02:23] i've texted him and we talked about it
[1:02:26] but look how god has an order
[1:02:28] look how god directs our paths
[1:02:31] praise god
[1:02:34] i didn't know if i should pastor it's
[1:02:36] the only time i ever opened my bible
[1:02:37] said lord speak to me i remember i was
[1:02:38] sitting with lydia in the bathroom up
[1:02:39] there i think she might have been in the
[1:02:40] tub
[1:02:41] over there in calgary fall i said lord
[1:02:43] if help speak to me i opened it up and
[1:02:44] it went to first timothy 4 12. let no
[1:02:47] man despise thy youth but you be the
[1:02:49] example of the believers in word and
[1:02:51] conversation and charity and spirit and
[1:02:52] faith and purity
[1:02:54] neglect not the gift that is within thee
[1:02:58] take heed unto thyself and to the
[1:02:59] doctrine
[1:03:00] because it will save yourself and them
[1:03:02] that hear thee
[1:03:04] and that's how i proved i knew it was
[1:03:06] god's will for me to pastor
[1:03:08] and have i manifested that or not i hope
[1:03:10] you can say amen
[1:03:12] i know i can say amen i've seen god do
[1:03:14] it in my own life i've given myself to
[1:03:16] the word of god to preaching the word of
[1:03:18] god and i've tried to make myself an
[1:03:20] example
[1:03:21] praise god because i know just because
[1:03:23] i'm young just because we're young
[1:03:24] doesn't mean we can we should be looked
[1:03:25] down upon
[1:03:27] because we're young we should be more
[1:03:28] strengthened we should have more energy
[1:03:30] more zeal for god amen
[1:03:32] those days are going to come when you
[1:03:34] don't enjoy them so much all the pains
[1:03:35] of life start catching up to you
[1:03:37] be the example the bible says
[1:03:40] but prove it by the will of god
[1:03:42] amen
[1:03:45] so church let us walk in the perfect
[1:03:47] will of god
[1:03:49] especially speaking since i had this
[1:03:50] opportunity i'm going to speak to the
[1:03:50] young ones there
[1:03:52] walk in the perfect will of god prove
[1:03:55] all things
[1:03:57] with a transformed mind and the only way
[1:03:58] it's gonna be transformed is be cleaned
[1:03:59] out by the word
[1:04:01] you've got to stay in the word you've
[1:04:02] got to meditate in the word and then you
[1:04:04] can prove this is the perfect will of
[1:04:06] god
[1:04:07] hallelujah
[1:04:10] like i did that the last the last time i
[1:04:11] did that was with brother amen it was
[1:04:12] 2014 our church was shrinking really
[1:04:14] small there's my hour i'm like lord i
[1:04:16] wrote it to myself in email and i prayed
[1:04:18] i said lord if i don't win a soul by the
[1:04:20] end of this year 2014
[1:04:22] and my ministry doesn't bring them into
[1:04:24] the message i'm going into evangelism
[1:04:26] that was like in the summer of 2014.
[1:04:28] well here you know around september 2014

[1:04:40] everything i've ever studied except one
[1:04:41] sermon why we're not denomination
[1:04:44] i said lord i have no idea why i'd ever
[1:04:45] preach this message but it's all i got
[1:04:47] and i'm tired and i'm exhausted this is
[1:04:49] the second service i'll just go preach
[1:04:51] it anyway
[1:04:54] and six people come up to the altar i
[1:04:56] baptized all six of them and there's
[1:04:58] only one that stayed
[1:04:59] brother amen and god gave me the amen to
[1:05:02] my ministry

[1:05:05] quit brother i'm to quit pastor i'm just
[1:05:07] going back into evangelism like i
[1:05:09] started off with brother brooks
[1:05:11] god gave me the amen
[1:05:13] prove the perfect will of god it is
[1:05:15] god's perfect will that you're here
[1:05:16] church amen
[1:05:19] it's god's perfect will this is you're
[1:05:20] doing exactly what god called you to do
[1:05:23] amen god has orchestrated all the events
[1:05:25] of your life leading up to this and we
[1:05:27] should go forward in the power and the
[1:05:29] authority and the anointing of the holy
[1:05:31] spirit today
[1:05:32] amen
[1:05:34] and if i know there's a scripture i'm
[1:05:35] off the word i don't know it
[1:05:38] if there is a scripture i'm off i don't
[1:05:39] know it amen
[1:05:40] hallelujah because that we prove the
[1:05:42] will of god we prove the perfect will of
[1:05:44] god by the word of god
[1:05:47] and as i said last wednesday as you know
[1:05:51] the tares and the wheat are going to
[1:05:52] have miracles
[1:05:54] they're all going to have the anointing
[1:05:55] what separates them one does the perfect
[1:05:57] will of god amen the other one doesn't
[1:06:00] the other one has false doctrine but the
[1:06:02] real bride of christ has two true
[1:06:03] doctrines and true miracles she's got
[1:06:05] all of it because she is the bride she's
[1:06:07] fully washed she's a to z the word of

[1:06:27] little earlier
[1:06:29] there's an option i could hide it but
[1:06:30] i'm just like well i'll just put it up
[1:06:31] there you know
[1:06:33] sorry i'm trying to find colossians i
[1:06:34] just could pass it colossians 1 verse 2.
[1:06:40] to the saints and the faithful brethren
[1:06:42] in christ which are at colossae grace be
[1:06:45] unto you and peace from god our father
[1:06:47] and the lord jesus christ
[1:06:49] so what are we church we are sacred we
[1:06:52] are morally blameless we are religious
[1:06:55] we're saints
[1:06:56] the word religion is not a bad word
[1:06:58] churches have made it a bad word because
[1:07:00] they like to disobey god's word
[1:07:02] don't let anybody ever tell you
[1:07:03] religion's a bad thing religion is a
[1:07:04] good thing
[1:07:06] james 1 verse 27 said pure and undefiled
[1:07:09] religion before the father is the visit
[1:07:11] visit the poor visit the widows visit
[1:07:13] the fatherless and to keep yourself
[1:07:15] unspotted from the world i am religious
[1:07:18] amen that's why brother emma said i feel
[1:07:19] religious amen
[1:07:21] religious means religion means
[1:07:22] observance i feel like i'm observing the
[1:07:24] word of god today amen i feel like i'm
[1:07:27] doing the word of god i feel like i'm
[1:07:29] obeying the word of god that's what
[1:07:30] jesus said teach them go to all nations
[1:07:32] and teach them to observe all my
[1:07:34] commands
[1:07:36] hallelujah
[1:07:37] teach them to be religious over all the
[1:07:39] commands all these people just don't
[1:07:41] know their bibles thank god we know the
[1:07:43] bible and may we keep knowing it and may
[1:07:44] we obey it praise god
[1:07:46] hallelujah
[1:07:48] so trapped in creeds and man-made ideas
[1:07:52] thank god for the word of god
[1:07:53] he said to the saints and the faithful
[1:07:56] the trustworthy
[1:07:59] trust i'm looking at the trustworthy
[1:08:00] ones i can trust you buddy
[1:08:02] i can trust all the sisters back here
[1:08:05] they if they tell me something they're
[1:08:06] going to do it
[1:08:08] hallelujah the saints the sacred ones
[1:08:11] that have a sacred purpose a holy
[1:08:13] purpose unto god
[1:08:14] and they're trustworthy
[1:08:16] hallelujah
[1:08:19] i told you austin i was going to help
[1:08:20] you out did i help you out can you trust
[1:08:21] me
[1:08:23] yeah i should be
[1:08:25] i should be a faithful christian if not
[1:08:27] it's time to repent
[1:08:29] amen
[1:08:30] everything i've told you i've done
[1:08:32] as far as i know
[1:08:34] if not let me know after service
[1:08:36] i'll take correction
[1:08:38] but that's what it means
[1:08:40] sacred believers who are trustworthy
[1:08:42] this letter is only to the trustworthy
[1:08:44] ones
[1:08:46] praise god
[1:08:48] and like paul said in titus they had
[1:08:50] elders in every city like akron
[1:08:53] every city should in every city that has
[1:08:55] the elect will have trustworthy people
[1:08:57] you can trust them
[1:09:00] right that's why jesus told peter he
[1:09:01] said because you've left all these he
[1:09:03] said i'm giving you families a hundred
[1:09:05] fold that means wherever peter traveled
[1:09:07] he could go into a christian's house and
[1:09:08] he was gonna get served
[1:09:10] because they were trustworthy they're
[1:09:11] not gonna mistreat peter they're not
[1:09:12] gonna call the cops on peter they're
[1:09:14] gonna feed peter and that's how it is
[1:09:16] with us right when we become real
[1:09:17] christians we inherit a huge family
[1:09:20] a real spiritual family
[1:09:26] to the saints that are in christ jesus
[1:09:29] a little more here on uh verse two
[1:09:33] i'm gonna skip uh sorry whoops
[1:09:39] i forgot to change this but i was gonna
[1:09:40] look at grace and peace let's look at
[1:09:42] grace and peace for a moment
[1:09:44] grace be unto you and peace from god our
[1:09:46] father lord jesus christ 14 times paul
[1:09:50] starts out letters like this
[1:09:53] you know what's the first thing that you
[1:09:54] would say i'd say god bless you you know
[1:09:56] that's a blessing right well when paul
[1:09:57] wrote a letter the first thing he'd say
[1:09:59] is grace to you
[1:10:01] peace to you grace and peace to you how
[1:10:04] do you want both of those
[1:10:05] that's a double blessing right there
[1:10:06] right
[1:10:07] grace and peace
[1:10:09] they're connected over and over again
[1:10:11] grace means unmerited favor
[1:10:14] so in other words he's saying may you
[1:10:15] have god's favor on your life
[1:10:17] and may you have rest and quietness how
[1:10:20] many were like that praise god in this
[1:10:22] loud world in this busy world he said
[1:10:24] i'm going to give you god's favor and
[1:10:25] i'm going to give you god's rest
[1:10:27] how many could use that today what do
[1:10:29] you say
[1:10:31] i can use it tomorrow when i go back to
[1:10:32] work
[1:10:34] i get a million questions on that
[1:10:36] on the school day tomorrow
[1:10:38] i could use some peace right there
[1:10:40] but notice also peace is the result of
[1:10:43] grace
[1:10:44] so if you ever receive god's favor that
[1:10:46] will give you peace in your heart
[1:10:48] because you know you're not at war with
[1:10:49] god anymore
[1:10:51] the bible says we were at war with god
[1:10:53] in our minds
[1:10:54] right we are at war with him
[1:10:57] but anyone who's received grace now has
[1:10:59] the peace of god in your heart so don't
[1:11:01] let the devil steal from you and the
[1:11:03] church said
[1:11:05] don't let the devil if you receive grace
[1:11:07] if you receive god's favor god's
[1:11:09] unmerited gift don't let the devil take
[1:11:11] your peace because peace is the result
[1:11:13] of having grace
[1:11:15] that's why that's what we talk about
[1:11:16] remember when you got saved what'd you
[1:11:17] feel you felt like this huge weight off
[1:11:19] your chest
[1:11:20] i know that's what i felt like when i
[1:11:22] saw tim anderson there praising god at
[1:11:23] the athletes in action and as soon as i
[1:11:25] repented and raised my hands i just felt
[1:11:27] like oh the weight of 19 years was off
[1:11:30] me i was like oh i can finally lift my
[1:11:32] hand thank god the weight of
[1:11:34] condemnation the weight of guilt jesus
[1:11:36] wants to take all those weights away lay
[1:11:38] those weights aside amen and run the
[1:11:41] race that is set before you hallelujah
[1:11:44] amen
[1:11:47] grace
[1:11:48] and peace
[1:11:50] to all of us today
[1:11:53] i know i could use some grace and peace
[1:11:58] what brings grace and peace it's god's
[1:12:00] presence
[1:12:03] i want to prove it by the bible
[1:12:05] when god passed by moses god moses had
[1:12:08] asked in chapter 33 of exodus he said
[1:12:10] lord show me your glory what a question
[1:12:12] what a question i want to see your glory
[1:12:14] let me say i want to see god's glory
[1:12:17] if you do you just got to wait on god
[1:12:20] and one of these days god is going to
[1:12:21] pass by in such a beautiful way you're
[1:12:23] going to tremble and hurt anointing
[1:12:25] you're going to you're going to cry
[1:12:26] under his anointing you might dance
[1:12:27] under his anointing you might scream
[1:12:29] under his anointing but when his
[1:12:30] presence passes your way you will feel
[1:12:32] the grace and mercy of god that's what
[1:12:35] his presence is it is grace and mercy
[1:12:38] amen it is his character it is his
[1:12:40] promises
[1:12:42] because he descended in a cloud and
[1:12:43] stood there
[1:12:44] imagine standing there with god god
[1:12:46] stands with you god said with moses if
[1:12:48] god said with moses god will stand with
[1:12:50] you too praise god
[1:12:52] and he proclaimed his own name and he
[1:12:54] said i am the lord what is he first he
[1:12:57] said i'm merciful and
[1:12:59] gracious
[1:13:01] that's why paul starts out all his
[1:13:03] letters grace and peace to you
[1:13:06] because when god showed himself to moses
[1:13:08] he was saying i'm giving you mercy i'm
[1:13:11] giving you grace
[1:13:14] church none of us deserve it
[1:13:17] none of us can earn it
[1:13:19] we should have some happy
[1:13:21] faithful saints here today by god's
[1:13:24] grace
[1:13:25] we should have some peaceful saints here
[1:13:26] today by god's grace
[1:13:28] the peace of god
[1:13:31] has so
[1:13:32] surrounded and filled our lives
[1:13:35] because of god's grace
[1:13:38] and this is what god god will always
[1:13:39] proclaim when his presence comes his
[1:13:41] presence will proclaim mercy grace
[1:13:44] long-suffering
[1:13:46] you mean god will still forgive me after
[1:13:48] the thousandth time i fail yes
[1:13:51] i'm gonna say it again god will still
[1:13:52] forgive me after the ten thousandth time
[1:13:54] i sin yes
[1:13:56] amen hallelujah praise god
[1:13:59] like we said last sunday paul
[1:14:01] did things he hated he knew they were
[1:14:03] wrong come on church you do things you
[1:14:04] know you're wrong
[1:14:06] but god's grace is sufficient he is
[1:14:09] longsuffering with you one of these days
[1:14:11] you're going to get the victory you
[1:14:12] might fight that critical spirit you
[1:14:13] might fight that lust demon for five
[1:14:15] days five years you might fight a long
[1:14:17] time but one of these days you're gonna
[1:14:19] get the victory because god is
[1:14:20] long-suffering amen
[1:14:22] however he forgives all iniquities
[1:14:24] praise god we know better yet we still
[1:14:26] do it but yet his mercy
[1:14:28] is declared before us amen hallelujah
[1:14:30] he's gracious he's merciful he's long
[1:14:33] suffering he's abundant in goodness and
[1:14:35] truth
[1:14:36] amen
[1:14:39] that was one of the blood of bulls and
[1:14:40] ghosts it's magnified today
[1:14:43] it's more grace and more mercy right
[1:14:45] it's the blood of jesus it's not law
[1:14:47] it's grace and the church said
[1:14:51] keeping mercy for thousands
[1:14:54] forgiving iniquity and transgression and
[1:14:55] sin that will by no means clear the
[1:14:57] guilty see there's they won't repent
[1:15:00] visiting the iniquity of the fathers
[1:15:01] upon the children and upon the
[1:15:02] children's children and the third and
[1:15:04] fourth generation
[1:15:05] i'm trying to close here
[1:15:09] in verse 3 he says we give thanks to god
[1:15:11] and the father of our lord jesus christ
[1:15:13] praying always for you he always prayed
[1:15:15] for the individual churches
[1:15:20] that's why we must pray for one another
[1:15:24] think about this when was the last time
[1:15:25] you prayed for the saints in the point
[1:15:27] when was the last time you prayed for
[1:15:28] the saints in sheffield or lorraine
[1:15:31] how about the saints in ghana
[1:15:34] paul his prayer life centered around
[1:15:37] praying for the believers
[1:15:39] and so our prayer life should center
[1:15:41] around that as well how many believe
[1:15:42] that
[1:15:45] see church you know listen we're not
[1:15:46] perfect we need reminders
[1:15:48] listen let me be honest i need a
[1:15:49] reminder to pray for the saints in the
[1:15:51] point because i have a lot of battles
[1:15:52] going on here
[1:15:54] you know they got battles going on too
[1:15:56] we need reminders that's why we got to
[1:15:57] pick these letters up and read them
[1:15:59] right
[1:16:02] help me to stop thinking about my own
[1:16:03] problems all the time help me to enter
[1:16:05] into somebody else's suffering
[1:16:07] pray for other churches paul in church
[1:16:09] he wrote this in prison he's right he's
[1:16:11] writing this in prison and he's a
[1:16:13] prisoner but he's praying for free
[1:16:14] people ah
[1:16:16] what what a sermon what a christian
[1:16:19] he's not praying god right now maybe he
[1:16:21] did but he said i'm always praying for
[1:16:22] you guys
[1:16:24] that's why brother bram says don't pray
[1:16:25] for yourself so much pray for other
[1:16:27] people
[1:16:29] in prison praying for the free people
[1:16:33] we're gonna close this in a moment by
[1:16:34] seeing what did he pray for because he
[1:16:36] actually tells us what did he pray for
[1:16:42] verse 4
[1:16:43] since we heard of your faith in christ
[1:16:44] jesus and of the love which ye have to
[1:16:47] all the saints so again
[1:16:48] when the message hits a place when the
[1:16:50] message of jesus christ hits a place it
[1:16:52] causes them to all fall in love with one
[1:16:54] another
[1:16:56] hallelujah
[1:16:58] that's how we should be known we should
[1:17:00] be known as a church that loves each
[1:17:02] other
[1:17:04] because paul said i've heard of your
[1:17:05] love i've heard of your faith
[1:17:10] the bible says you are you are a letter
[1:17:12] of recommendation for the preachers
[1:17:14] you've heard that's what written epistle
[1:17:16] means
[1:17:17] it means you are the letter of
[1:17:18] recommendation brother dustin and betsy
[1:17:20] there are letters of recommendation to
[1:17:21] brother brooks's and brother cam's
[1:17:23] ministry
[1:17:24] right maybe brother craig i'm not sure
[1:17:25] how long they said under him if they did
[1:17:26] or not but
[1:17:29] the corinthians were letters of epistle
[1:17:31] their life was a recommendation about
[1:17:33] the preaching of paul may god help us to
[1:17:35] live such a life that the preaching from
[1:17:37] this church writes the recommendation on
[1:17:40] your lives amen amen and people can look
[1:17:43] at your life in the the letter speaking
[1:17:45] you should go to briana christ
[1:17:46] fellowship because they got the word of
[1:17:47] god preached there
[1:17:49] amen praise god your life should be so
[1:17:51] salty be so loving that people look at
[1:17:53] you and say why are they so loving
[1:17:55] you're you're a living recommendation
[1:17:58] you're a living invitation to come to
[1:18:00] this church praise god
[1:18:02] now we know if you there be to find it
[1:18:03] but you're still a written epistle
[1:18:05] known and write of god
[1:18:08] you must love all the saints with god's
[1:18:09] own love i'm almost done
[1:18:13] and verse 5 says our hope is in heaven
[1:18:16] for the hope which is laid up for you in
[1:18:18] heaven where have ye heard before in the
[1:18:20] word of the truth of the gospel
[1:18:24] i'm going to skip a pass a few of these
[1:18:26] here and i'm going to move on uh
[1:18:30] let's just look at his prayer let's
[1:18:31] close with this here
[1:18:33] so verses 9.
[1:18:37] i'm going to close with this and let's
[1:18:39] let's spend this uh
[1:18:40] the close of this service praying for
[1:18:42] other people
[1:18:44] that seems to be like a thought that
[1:18:45] come off here as we're preaching
[1:18:50] let's pray for other people
[1:18:53] verse 9 says
[1:18:56] for this cause we also since the day we
[1:18:58] heard it do not cease to pray for you
[1:19:00] he's imprisoned
[1:19:02] i'm not going to stop praying for the
[1:19:04] saints in colossae
[1:19:08] did he have a prayer life church what do
[1:19:09] you think
[1:19:10] absolutely
[1:19:12] he could pray in prison can you pray
[1:19:14] in your freedom
[1:19:16] or are you a prisoner to your job
[1:19:19] or your phone
[1:19:21] you see
[1:19:23] if we're not careful we become prisoners
[1:19:26] yet we're not in prison
[1:19:28] but here's a man in prison who can be
[1:19:29] free
[1:19:30] hallelujah praise god who can redeem his
[1:19:33] time and pray for the saints
[1:19:35] god help us church
[1:19:37] he will help us
[1:19:38] that's why we're preaching it
[1:19:40] that's his help to us amen
[1:19:42] to give us the word
[1:19:45] he said do not cease to pray for you and
[1:19:47] to desire that you might be filled with
[1:19:48] the knowledge of his will
[1:19:50] in all wisdom and spiritual
[1:19:52] understanding that ye might walk worthy
[1:19:54] of the lord unto all pleasing
[1:19:57] being fruitful in every good work and
[1:19:59] increasing in the knowledge of god
[1:20:01] strengthened with all my according to
[1:20:02] his glorious power unto all patience and
[1:20:04] long-suffering with joyfulness isn't
[1:20:06] this beautiful
[1:20:08] how many think that's beautiful
[1:20:13] five
[1:20:14] prayer requests at the end of his well
[1:20:17] i'm sorry at the middle of this chapter
[1:20:20] he's at the end of his life the church
[1:20:21] only has 10 years
[1:20:23] if i knew the rapture was in 10 years
[1:20:25] what would what would i pray for right
[1:20:26] here right here
[1:20:30] we pray for this
[1:20:33] so this is what counts
[1:20:36] these are the major things how many can
[1:20:37] believe that these are the major things
[1:20:39] that we should have we should be what
[1:20:40] filled with all the
[1:20:42] knowledge
[1:20:43] of god's will
[1:20:45] in all wisdom and spiritual
[1:20:47] understanding
[1:20:50] that's a highly concentrated verse or
[1:20:52] phrase right there
[1:20:54] i got knowledge i understand his will
[1:20:57] in all wisdom
[1:20:59] sound advice
[1:21:00] and spiritual understanding
[1:21:04] in other words for all the will of god
[1:21:05] for my life i understand
[1:21:07] god has shown me and i understand what
[1:21:09] i'm doing in my life
[1:21:17] second that you'd walk worthy of the
[1:21:19] lord and everything you did all your
[1:21:22] walk with god would be all pleasing to
[1:21:24] him
[1:21:26] everything you do is pleasing
[1:21:28] that's what he would pray for that's
[1:21:30] what a prophet would pray for you
[1:21:34] third you would be fruitful in every
[1:21:36] good work you would see fruit abound to
[1:21:39] everything you put your hand to
[1:21:41] amen
[1:21:44] you would see god's blessings you'd have
[1:21:45] testimonies amen hallelujah you come to
[1:21:48] church with testimonies amen hallelujah
[1:21:51] thank god
[1:21:55] i pray that they'll have testimonies and
[1:21:57] everything they do they'll be fruitful
[1:21:58] on their job fruitful in their family
[1:22:00] fruitful and witnessing and uh fruitful
[1:22:02] and prayers fruitful and praying for the
[1:22:04] sick you know whatever area fruitful in
[1:22:06] their song services you know
[1:22:08] i want to see them be fruitful in
[1:22:09] everything they do that was that's what
[1:22:11] i would pray for as paul said
[1:22:14] for the last 10 years where this city
[1:22:16] existed
[1:22:20] increasing in the knowledge of god so
[1:22:21] this was the knowledge of his will but
[1:22:23] now this is just knowledge about god
[1:22:27] just knowing god more how many want to
[1:22:29] understand god more
[1:22:32] i've got a lot of room to grow
[1:22:33] especially with these prophecies you
[1:22:34] know they're all kind of the believe the
[1:22:36] sign people are attacking brother
[1:22:37] branham on prophecies i got a lot of
[1:22:38] room to grow there i've just come across
[1:22:40] some scriptures like wow i never it's
[1:22:42] like i read right over that and then you
[1:22:43] understand what he was saying
[1:22:45] there's a lot of room for me to grow
[1:22:47] about the knowledge of god for example
[1:22:50] god said that israel being there 400
[1:22:51] years in egypt how long were they in
[1:22:53] there
[1:22:54] 430.
[1:22:57] everybody's thinking now good
[1:22:59] well how can that be it was thus saith
[1:23:01] the lord 400.
[1:23:03] but they're in there 430.
[1:23:08] see
[1:23:09] how many can you feel like they can grow
[1:23:10] an understanding now
[1:23:12] it's like you got two different thus
[1:23:13] saith the lord did thus say the lord
[1:23:15] fail
[1:23:16] of course not
[1:23:19] but god doesn't always tell us all the
[1:23:21] details about the prophecy
[1:23:25] so what do you have to do you have to
[1:23:25] find a man of god that's anointed the
[1:23:27] holy ghost points us back to the word
[1:23:30] and you got to pray
[1:23:32] and you got to pray for all
[1:23:34] understanding and all knowledge
[1:23:36] hallelujah
[1:23:38] see church people are leaving the
[1:23:40] message by droves
[1:23:42] do you know that
[1:23:44] it's going uh
[1:23:45] brazil there's a sister that used to
[1:23:47] live in brazil she's been emailed me
[1:23:48] last week
[1:23:49] she she heard the message in 2017 in
[1:23:51] brazil she said the year after that
[1:23:54] people started leaving in droves she
[1:23:56] said pastors are falling away by the by
[1:23:58] the dozens
[1:23:59] she said in brazil there's a message
[1:24:01] church in every single town
[1:24:03] now that that's probably exaggeration
[1:24:06] but because of these things that are
[1:24:07] brought out
[1:24:09] and the preachers don't have answers you
[1:24:10] know why because they're not digging
[1:24:12] into the word of god to understand these
[1:24:13] things
[1:24:14] better they're saying i don't understand
[1:24:17] prophecy so i'm throwing out the water
[1:24:18] could you imagine this i'm throwing
[1:24:19] about the water baptism i'm throwing out
[1:24:21] the godhead i'm throwing about the
[1:24:22] holiness closed and i'll just go back to
[1:24:24] denomination
[1:24:25] oh it's korah
[1:24:27] it's korah
[1:24:28] it's judas iscariot again
[1:24:32] denying the word for what selfish desire
[1:24:34] they never got those desires cleaned out
[1:24:36] of their mind and their body praise god
[1:24:40] see that's why i'm saying we need to
[1:24:41] grow because guess what
[1:24:43] saint satan is not going to make it
[1:24:44] easier on us the bible said that he's
[1:24:46] going to come keep coming in like a
[1:24:47] flood
[1:24:49] he's going to keep coming with questions
[1:24:51] that you don't know
[1:24:52] so you have to have an intimacy with
[1:24:54] christ amen you have to ask seek and
[1:24:56] knock and then christ will open it unto
[1:24:58] you
[1:25:04] this is what a prophet would pray for
[1:25:07] when you have 10 years left before the
[1:25:09] coming of the lord for judgment i'm not
[1:25:11] making prophecies but you understand
[1:25:13] before the end of this city
[1:25:15] ten years
[1:25:16] and what would you pray for at the end
[1:25:18] let's stand to our feet
[1:25:20] he'd pray
[1:25:22] that you would have strength
[1:25:25] in fact almighty can come
[1:25:28] unto what
[1:25:29] he would pray lord make them stronger to
[1:25:33] have all patience
[1:25:35] and long-suffering and
[1:25:38] joyfulness
[1:25:45] this is a man that he'd seen a serpent
[1:25:47] bite him a viper and he
[1:25:49] threw it back into the fire
[1:25:52] he prayed for publicist father of the
[1:25:54] bloody flux and he was healed man was
[1:25:56] healed instantly
[1:25:58] there's a man who was stoned by the
[1:25:59] ozone he was stoned they thought he was
[1:26:00] dead he just walked after a few minutes
[1:26:02] everybody left he got right up he said
[1:26:04] god god brought me back
[1:26:06] it's a man that saw a man fall off a
[1:26:08] two-story building he died he went down
[1:26:10] there and prayed for him and the man
[1:26:11] raised right up here what would he pray
[1:26:13] for you do you see any miracles in there
[1:26:15] we love miracles but are miracles in
[1:26:16] that prayer
[1:26:19] no it's more about your character
[1:26:23] it's about you understanding god's will
[1:26:24] now god's will for you maybe miracles
[1:26:27] maybe tongues and interpretation
[1:26:30] maybe wisdom
[1:26:31] but this is what a man of god would pray
[1:26:33] for
[1:26:35] for you and i
[1:26:37] church it's a reminder
[1:26:38] about this simplicity that's in christ
[1:26:42] it's in a reminder that there is no
[1:26:43] continuing city here we don't know how
[1:26:46] long we'll be here
[1:26:49] but god has given us a sufficient word
[1:26:51] how many know the word is good enough
[1:26:52] for us
[1:26:54] satan's trying to distract us all these
[1:26:55] things to get us away from the word the
[1:26:57] word's not so exciting as it used to be
[1:26:59] it's not so enjoyable as it used to be
[1:27:00] but yet it is
[1:27:02] it is everything that we have in need of
[1:27:06] it is the only thing that we have a need
[1:27:07] of
[1:27:10] let's bow our heads for word of prayer
[1:27:16] i appreciate your attention
[1:27:18] i appreciate you pulling on the word of
[1:27:20] god today
[1:27:23] let's first pray for our church and then
[1:27:25] i want to
[1:27:26] just take so you can stop the livestream
[1:27:28] i just want to take some prayer requests
[1:27:29] of any churches you want to pray for
