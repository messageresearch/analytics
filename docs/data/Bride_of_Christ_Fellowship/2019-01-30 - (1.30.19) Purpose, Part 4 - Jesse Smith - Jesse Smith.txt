our Bibles here let's get to the word of the Lord that's what job chapter 17 tonight by God's grace job chapter 7 he lit like to look at purpose part 4 like degree hour eight of eight viewers so god bless our eight viewers there they Lord richly bless you I appreciate you taking this time out here to hear the word of the Lord and I know to be a blessing to you so let's go to job chapter 17 read 10 11 12 and 13 here's job in the midst of his trial we know he had a trial for months and months and months and lost all his family though his children his possessions and at this point he's lost his health for the most part as I've been reading in here you know job was saying how he could hardly sleep at night he was losing sleep and every night was just awful and worse and in the midst of this trial we see the enemy tried to convince job that he doesn't have a purpose in life anymore and so I want to look at that tonight and just kind of reassure our hearts on the purpose of God in the midst of trials those look at job 17 verse 10 verse 10 says but as for you all do he return they come now for I cannot find one wise man among youth that's joke talking to his three friends there and that's true because later they had apologized and Joe had to pray for them let's reverse the leaven together for the children we have their Bibles Joe 1711 ready 1 2 3 my days are past my purposes are broken off even the thoughts of my heart in re 12 and 13 they are they change the night in today the light is short because of darkness if I wait the grave is my house if I have made my bed I'm sorry I have made my bed in the darkness re 14 as well I've said to corruption thou art my father to the worm thou art my mother and my sister he was so sure that death awaited him he was so sure that there was no hope that he was calling the worm his mother of course we know the end of the story right we know what God did God did a complete restoration of job's life but in the midst of trials it was so difficult he thought he was going down to the grave soon and he thought he had no purpose in life and many times we get like that so that's just of our heads here and will preach on this thought by God's grace they have a need on your heart just maybe in your home there just raise your hand into the Lord Heavenly Father we know your spirit is omnipresent and omnipotent your all-powerful you can be in all places at one time Lord for those who welcome you in their homes Lord we pray tonight we've sang tonight we tried to welcome you in each home and dear God we just ask that you be in each home and may your presence be felt there dear God thank you for the songs that we can sing Lord God to glorify thy great name we've shouted the name of Jesus and I thank you Jesus and we ask o God that you'll speak to every heart by your word and our blessings now died to my presence in Jesus Christ's name never said Amen baby seated here they can you send me a text phone semi Texan saver of mine so I just actually if she make a reminder for me I want to send my cousin Adam a video I just been sending him text and I thought maybe it'd help him out if I just send the video talking a little bit maybe that would help them out my god it's great so let's look at our [Music] our text here by the grace of Lord now we're in job 17 again as we said and let me just skip to where I was going now we'll get to this in just a moment but I just want to go over this again here how job's trials made him doubt his purposes in life he said my purposes are broken off so we know the pain of broken bones right or we know the pain of promises that are broken the pain of you know of having a promise broken or a relationship broken we know the pain of brokenness and so that's what Jobe felt like through us months-long trial was that there were just no more purpose for him in life and thank God we know the end of the story and I just want to encourage you tonight no matter what you're going through and this is what I apply to my life as well as I prepare these thoughts from the Word of God is to not let anything frustrate the purpose of God in my life now I want to before getting more on Joe I want to preach a little more on Joe I want to just cover again the purpose of God to constantly feed on the Word of God you know some people we know in many churches you know because of the cold tonight canceled and you know they're allowed to do that and core we cancel gathering physically but you know many churches today cancelled it and so people won't be listening the Word of God tonight who knows what they'll be doing the sincere Christian though will be trying to find some way to feed upon the Word of God because we know that is God's purpose for their lives we're not going to turn there but in Hebrews 10 we know the Bible says to gather more as you see that Day approaching it's so important to keep gathering with believers so we appreciate you make it an opportunity or making the the effort to feed on the Word of God you'll never regret that brother Branham said he never regretted ever going to the house of Lord to worship and neither have I so something good can always come out of that but let's kind of review a few things I'm going to read from uncertain sound 1961 the Prophet said tonight we'd ask especially for our gracious loyal brother Sullivan that you bless him exceedingly abundantly seeing his heart's desires to serve you and to do something for you and to make all of these hours count for the kingdom of God that's what we want to do tonight make these hours tonight count for God's kingdom and he Madison brother Sullivan was bringing into the city ministers different ministers with different types of ministry that they might serve the purpose and they might feed the flock to which the Holy Spirit has made them overseer and brother branham's to thanks the Lord he said Lord we thank you for this and so that's of course what every god-fearing Church does that we try to call in different ministries mostly evangelist you know but we at times call in pastors and teachers we know there are and the that's the purpose of God to feed the flock of God I remember we're not going to turn there but Acts chapter 20 where Paul cried for three days and and Paul charged those Ephesian elders he said don't let these wolves come in he said feed the flock of God which the Holy Spirit has made you over see your stuff so I counted as a when the purposes of my life is to feed the flock the Word of God I love to see when that word is received whether it's through immediate revelation or maybe it takes time to receive that revelation maybe it's encouragement I love to see when the food that God has prepared for his people is received praise God that's God's purpose it was such a purpose that Paul cried about it he won the the Church of God to be protected he won them to be fed you know which one of us if we watched TV we don't cry when we see a baby that's starving to death you know they're usually from Africa you know when I was growing up we would see that constantly you know commercials trying to get people to send money to feed the poor starving children in Africa and how that hurts our hearts and it makes us sad it makes us want to do something but how about spiritually where God's people are not feeding on the Word of God they're not hearing preaching that pertains to them thank God that we have the message of the hour the food of this day to feed our hungry hearts we don't have to feed off on the old stale bread right we don't eat stale bread moldy bread from the days of Luther Wesley or Azusa Street we don't defeat on that but we got the fresh manna we got rapture food eating the head we got the food of this hour to feed on that's that's that's our life and that's the purpose of God for the fivefold ministry program thank the Lord for that now I want to just bring another thought to I may be getting this later on in future sermons I want to bring this thought that that that the purpose of God is feeding the flock of God and you know there's times and seasons for ministries you know I feel like maybe God has done this in Akron a little bit I'm looking at the the life of Peter not just for a moment you know when Jesus first caught him in Matthew chapter 4 he walked by Galilee he saw Simon and Andrews brother this is in Matthew 4 18 to 19 casting a net into the sea for they were fishers and he says oh then follow me and I'll make you fishers of men now of course we know that lasted for about three and a half years under the ministry of the Lord Jesus now right after Jesus was resurrected you know he met Peter and Peter denied him three times previously so Jesus asked him do you love me three times I want you to see how the shift of the purpose changes a little bit for Peter first he's a Fisher man and then it becomes a feeder of men I feel like that's you know what God has done in Akron recently you know God is back in 2000 you know 2003 we started the house services with Tim Meyers Tim Meyer started the house services and that was a great time of fishing where numerous fish got pulled into the the phone retailer or got pulled into the net and since then many times men met most of these years following have been feeding so we went from fishing to feeding the purpose of God slightly changed but the purpose of God is still in effect that we need to find God's sheep and then feed God's sheep so in John 21 15 you know that the scripture probably so when they died you just say at the Simon Peter Simon son of Jonas lovest thou me more than these they say unto Him yea Lord thou knowest that I love thee and he saith unto Him feed my lambs amen this I feel like I've got the burden like Peter I want to feed the lambs of God tonight I want to feed the Sheep of God tonight who are live streaming a part of Bride of Christ fellowship and those who are maybe in need of a home church and don't have one and they want to feed on the word of God we went from fishing to feeding now of course we always like doing fishing work right we send out postcards we put our videos on on YouTube or Facebook always trying to go fishing and try to see if anyone's hungry and thirsting for righteousness but right now our main ministry is feeding the people the Word of God and that's God's purpose that's one of God's great purposes for the church now one look at this here's another thought from this Melchizedek brother Brahim said being eternal with him at the beginning the eternal life that you had his thought of what you was he wanted me to stand in the pulpit say he wanted you to sit in the seat tonight then we are serving his eternal purpose he says in the one that left home only come to earth to service purpose is that right then that first finish it's brought back to glorify state it's matured and brought back again so brother Matt makes the point that we came from God's mind manifest in a flesh body and here we are in service tonight and whether you're standing preaching or sitting playing the piano or whether you're listening to the Word of God being preached to the Internet you are serving God's purpose right now I just want to remind you of that that it's God's eternal purpose God knew you'd be watching tonight and God had a purpose for you to watch tonight so please pay special close attention to every word of God that's being preached it's God's purpose to feed you and tonight it's God's purpose for you to hear the word of God and don't let it fall to the ground don't let it just go over the top of your head don't just be a hearer but be a doer of the word of the Lord my man tells us in perfect strength through perfect weakness which I got to listen to a couple times last week while shoveling snow for four hours brother Graham said he said that's when we come to church for is to find out where our faults is and the things that we might better ourselves by if we come to church for any other objective than this I'm afraid we won't get to much I've come into church so tonight as the word of God is being preached we should say lord help me to hear the word that I need to hear to strengthen my spiritual walk help me to be honest and say well maybe I'm not as strong as I need to be here maybe I'm not doing as well as I need to do in this area of my life whether it's prayer Bible reading or how I'm treating my family like here tonight how we treat one another maybe if we're not doing a good enough job the Holy Spirit help us to do a better job that's the purpose if we feel like we don't get anything out of this live stream then then we haven't taken a good-enough purpose we haven't looked at our lives or say inventory we haven't taken a good enough inventory of our spiritual walk as we need to do that tonight brother Graham says we must come to find our weaknesses find our bad places and see how little we are and put our trust in somebody that strong that's what we must do so that's what we're here to do tonight put our trust in Jesus Christ see how little see our bad places see our weak points and trust Jesus Christ to make those weak points strong that's God's eternal purpose for us tonight amen because I know as you know like brother Branham said I'll have to answer for everything I preach tonight I have to answer for many many services that's why I'm trusting in the blood of Jesus Christ to help me preach every service as honestly and sincerely as I can so that day I can answer and say I tried to live everything that God led me to preach now I just want to reiterate a few things here I want to go to the recent video I did on the home church series I will look at just a few things now remember from these five gifts of the fivefold ministry it's to produce at least five things in our life it's the produce the perfection or the equipping of the saints the so through tonight's sermon you're supposed to be equipped you're supposed to be given a tool you're supposed to be given a word you're supposed to be given a prophecy or something from the Word of God that's to equip you to be a better servant a better soldier for Christ second you're supposed to be given the work of the ministry so you're supposed to be encouraged to undertake a ministry praise God have a ministry do what God is calling you to do third your growth is to be promoted because that's the edifying of the body of Christ so this word that we hear tonight is to edify us help us grow in Christ Jesus as we said with food you know every plant needs food water and light you know all these things that it needs it makes its own food water light and temperature and soil of minerals and all these things that's what the Word of God is doing tonight it's promoting our growth it's meeting all of these needs forth it brings us to a unity of the faith said the conclusion of this sermon we should have more RP from us who make Bride of Christ fellowship our home church we should agree more on our beliefs we should have less confusion and more unity have more oneness of our thoughts and beliefs and fifthly unity and the knowledge of the Son of God and that's the unity of the precise truth so looks like 4 and 5 kind of go together with unity of faith and unity of knowledge that's what the Word of God is supposed to do for us and of course at any time if there's any questions you would have about the Word of God please reach out to me we'll be happy to answer any questions and these all work if we're into it the Holy Spirit then will work to the portion of the maturity of Jesus Christ they will raise you to the level of maturity you need to be in Christ Jesus because the Bible said unto a perfect man unto the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ we should see our lives looking more like Jesus Christ as the days go by and less like the world and lessen failure and lessened out lessened fear but more in strength and more in confidence more revelation more in service more like Jesus Christ because remember Jesus told the Church of thyroid sorry mister Thyatira your last works were more than the first so our works and our dedication of the home church our dedication to the Saints and the home church it should grow over time not diminish but it should grow and then it says mature Christians and Ephesians 4 speak the truth and love so we don't speak in hatred we don't speak in envy or jealousy we speak the truth in love for other people and then if we do that we will find where God has fitly joined us in our position in the body of Christ so see we've got to apply all those five benefits of the preaching when we do that we start speaking God's truth in love and we can find our position in the body of Christ also there will be four benefits or four weaknesses or states of temptation that we will be delivered out of remember this in Ephesians 4:14 will no longer be children which means immature unskilled or foolish virgin see that's why the foolish virgin doesn't pay the full attention to the fivefold ministry so we don't want to be children we don't want to be amateur we don't want to be tossed and agitated like waves about different topics will I believe this for a while I believe that now I'm back and forth we want to be heading in one direction third is carried by doubts or hesitations or opinions these two kind of go together with toss and carry we don't want to be driven by doubt as we saw on Sunday we don't want our lives driven by doubt or fear or by materialism we want them driven by the revelation of the Word of God driven by the Holy Spirit guided by the Holy Spirit and lastly to see them so the the fivefold ministry when we receive it preaching of the Holy Spirit it takes to all the deception out of our life in other words it delivers us from roaming around aimlessly being led astray by this person following that person following that person following the fivefold ministry which is Christ in the fivefold ministry brother Branham said the fivefold ministry is God's dress wear so Jesus Christ hides behind the fivefold ministry amen to that I love the video because that's what I've seen I've seen all the preachers I've sat under you know brother brother Brooks Samuel Brown the different ones I've sat under I've only seen Christ in their lives pointing me to live a closer life to Jesus Christ and I believe all those who sit under the ministry God has given me they're drawn to be more like Jesus Christ not to be more like the world not to be foolish but to be wise and always given Jesus Christ the preeminence in their lives amen now one more couple couple more things here the reasons for a church family are numerous first is to feel God's love and to love God's people jesus said in John 13:35 by this shall all men know you're my disciples if you have love one for another that's the first one the second this is where we can really grow as a church I know Bride of Christ fellowship can really grow this when it kind of deals with gifts and and the move the moving of the Holy Spirit that's what we want right we came here we gather to hear preaching to the see our are spots that aren't as strong as they need to be and God can help us to be stronger amen second so love each other and feel God's love thank them for all the love I feel from all the saints of brandy Christ fellowship I hope you feel the love of our family second you need to be provoked or receive inspiration from others and provide inspiration to others and that's Hebrews 10 24 and 25 now if you have your Bibles Church go to the first Corinthians 14:6 and why don't have what do you guys read that for me you sure enough that page back then a page from 1st Corinthians 14 6 it was getting a little bit deeper here and the Word of God with with the home Church and a local church but it's part of your purpose it's part of my purpose if God is truly gonna bring our little church Bride of Christ fellowship back to the original the full book of Acts Church which we believe we're a part of that we've seen in parts of that but if we're to be restored fully back to that then we've got to have a first Corinthians 14:6 church experience so let me read out for [Music] all right so see Paul said when I come amongst you I've got to edify you're going to help you by either giving a revelation a knowledge prophecy or doctrine all right so that's what we want to do amongst each other for example we want to save somebody come to church and maybe give a testimony say oh I had a revelation the Holy Spirit last night I had a dream or it could be a prophecy I had a dream and the Lord showed me that this was this was gonna happen let's pray and see if it comes to pass see if it be the will of the Lord or if God had a doctrinal question and you brought the church and you asked me after after church or before church about a doctoral question and then if it was by the Holy Spirit put on my heart I could share with the Saints so see all these parts are all these ways to edify the bride of Jesus Christ are clearly stated right here in the Word of God a revelation and knowledge of prophecy prophecy or doctrine so these are things we should pray for before we come to church Lord will give me a revelation to bring give me a knowledge give me prophesied or give me some type of doctrine and this is this is real mature Christianity here remember the book of Acts church when it was born was the mo mature church and if we are gonna be the restoration of the backs we've got to be just as mature just like this church here all right now we need to be happier joyful and Jesus said this takes place by feet washing and taking community which we do that quite a bit that's John 13 17 if you know these things happy are you if you do them so you need a church family to take communion and wash feet with and the Bible Jesus said you'll be happy if you do these things if you show his death until you come and you do it sincerely you examine yourself before you take communion jesus said to be happy so we ought to be very happy by the grace of the Lord alright next is you'll learn proper judgment this is why we need a church family you need to learn proper judgment in church family situations and this is how to judge yourself and fellow church family members because the Bible said in 1st Peter 4:17 that judgment begins at the house of God when there's problems in the church different people have different problems with with each other or with with the pastor we need to learn how to judge who's right or wrong in those situations the Bible says that plainly in 1st Corinthians 6 2 through 4 do you not know that the Saints will judge the world if the world should be judged by you are you unworthy to judge the smallest matters know ye not that we shall judge angels how much more things that pertain to this life so think about that if we're going to judge fallen angels and our testimony and our character will judge them then we cannot be scared to humbly judge between the Saints and the church if problems arise we shouldn't be scared because we're gonna have to judge fallen angels supernatural beings and how can we judge them if we're scared in the middle of conflict now I don't like conflict all the time I don't really know too many people who do but if we're to be the true family of God we've got to learn how to deal with problems and the family but so God will allow problems that happen to teach us how to judge between who's right and wrong in the family and if we're faithful with that if we can faithfully judge within the family then God will give us grace that judge fallen angels later see this is maturity this is not a milk sermon tonight and I hope everybody's at home same Amen you know asking you to bring a revelation to church asking to bring a doctor into church asking you to operate in a gift of the church that's not milk that's meat and this is where we need to grow into this is going to strengthen us this is to equip us without the vision the people perish and this is the vision that the true Bride of Christ Church are the world needs to have not just our church but anyone who's claiming to be a bride Church around the world we need to have this vision we need to learn to forgive and love like Christ within the church family that's an Ephesians 4:32 30 to let all bitterness and wrath and anger clamor evil speaking be put away from you with all malice be kind one to another tender-hearted forgiving one another even as God for Christ's sake has forgiven you so thank you everyone that I've heard that's forgiving me I appreciate that and I'll be happy to forgive you if you ever sin against me by the grace of the Lord okay so I just want to insert that how and I want to move on now but hopefully that showed the importance of having a home church and God's purpose for for you tonight for me tonight God's purpose is eternal God will I believe God wants us to review these things these are eternal truths and we need to remind ourselves of them especially for not manifesting in all these areas yet we need to review them pray about them ask God if this is a weak part in our life or this is a part where we're not strong yet God helped me to grow into that helped me to prepare myself so I can bring a revelation I can bring a prophecy I can bring a dream I can bring a word I can bring a doctrine that could be a blessing to people all right now let me take a few moments here and let me show more scripture about how God's purpose for you is absolutely secure so God's purpose for you cannot be thwarted it's already predetermined now all you have to do is submit to it all you have to do is obey it right because we know God will not if you want to go the permissive will of God and not do the perfect will of God God will allow that but if you want to do the perfect will of God and you want to walk in full obedience that purpose is is secure it's eternal it cannot be defeated the gates of Hell cannot prevail I it's a person who's received a revelation that Jesus is the Christ Jesus is the Messiah Jesus is God manifest in the flesh not a second person but the one person of God made flesh Romans 8:26 likewise the spirit also helpeth with our infirmities for we know not what we should pray for as we ought but the spirit itself maketh intercession for us with groanings which cannot be uttered and he that searches the hearts knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit because he maketh intercession for the Saints according to the will of God and we know that all things work together for good to them that love God to them who are called according to his purpose for whom he did foreknow he also did predestinate to be conformed to the image of his son that he might be the firstborn among many brethren so we've got to understand God's calling us to his purpose the only ones that are truly serving Jesus Christ or those who are taking up a cross they're taking up a heavy burden a heavy ministry and they're following him daily because they're called according to his purpose in order to find in your life you've got to lose your life lose your desires and then you find the life that Christ has for you because the sugar to say amen all right praise God and then God if he for knows you he calls you then he predestinate you then he conforms you to the image of his son all right Romans nine eleven for the children being not yet born speaking of Jacob and Esau neither having done any good or evil that the purpose of God according to election might stand not of works but of him that calleth so we know that Esau turned down God's call he was willing to sell out God's call just for food right and people today will sell out God's call just for a more higher paying job or a better looking spouse to get a second or third spouse and be adulterers the rest of their life they're willing to turn down God's call or purpose in order for temporary fleshly desires but God knew that Jacob had the true desire to do the God's will and God's purpose so God ordained that Jacob could rule over his brother and give him all the promises of the birthright praise God so see God's purpose will stand there firm God's purpose his intent for your life will stand as long as you see God like Jacob did amen as long as you're willing the rest of the Angels long as you're willing to say God change my walk I want a different walk I want people to see me walk different I don't want to fear anyone I don't want to be as scared I want to meet you and I want to wrestle with God until I get born again hallelujah that's what we got to have everybody my children everybody has to have that experience in order to be a real overcomer and to find God's purpose for their lives one more Ephesians 1 just kind of reiterating this this a very familiar scripture visions 1:9 but trying to hear God's Word tonight try to feed on this food from the Word of God having made known unto us the mystery of his will according to his good pleasure which he has purposed in himself so God let you know the mystery of his will according to his pleasure which he purposed in himself according to his intent that he had himself he made known the mystery of his will to you we should all say thank you lord we should all say Amen thank you for letting me know your will that the dispensation of the fullness of times he might gather together in one all things in Christ both which are in heaven and which are on earth even in him versa verse 11 partner in whom also we have obtained an inheritance being predestinated according to the purpose of him who worketh all things after the counsel of his own will praise God so whatever God allows that happened our lives that choices we didn't make things that seem unfair seems that the things that note that seem a surprise are out of the ordinary we have to remember that God predestined the purpose of his own will and the Bible said it was after the counsel of his own will so God had counseled God God God thought things over he knew things he never had a new thought but he already knew ahead of time through his wise heart and wise mind that you and I need an experienced a certain trial in order to bring about his purpose in our lives like we saw on Sunday as we saw with Garnett peak how God knew in order to stop him keep him from being an auctioneer that would go to hell I've got to drive him to me through polio I got to use polio to drive him to me God's wisdom God's predestinated a plan new that we don't like to hear that but that's that's the reality of the brothers testimony then brother Graham reassured us that his testimony would would either go against or for all the people in his community so sitting like this we're the we're the Queen of Sheba for Doylestown Ohio right we're that we're the Queen of Sheba for Akron Ohio some people might be the Garnett peak of Lima Ohio or whatever but in every community God once have a witness and those people who live the public life of Jesus Christ publicly God is going to raise them up and they're the witness they're the one that serve God's purpose and everybody's life will be judged by that life because garden had the fruit of the sphere of patience and that was a true fruit that God wanted everybody to see in that community and so we have to say God produce the fruit in my life that you want everybody to see praise God whether it's patience love joy peace longsuffering what fruits do you want Pete the public to see in my life like a Taekwondo what fruits does God want us to manifest a taekwondo that they can say mine that's a real christian they broke out the real love of christ they got the real fruit of long-suffering or they're so gently they're so meek they have such goodness where are whispering grace horses what do we want to what which of the workers see what fruit of the spirit does god want to produce in your lives that will be a public witness either for or against the people there that's what God wants to do God wants that you to have a purpose he wants to manifest the life of Jesus Christ to everyone around us so that should be going to whispering racehorses even more wonderful right that should be going to Taekwondo even more wonderful that should make me going to Arrowhead primary more wonderful knowing that I'm not going there more than just to do a job more than just to brush a horse more than just to do a form and and learn more about exercising but I'm going there to manifest and show them what the fruit of a Christian life produces praise God and that's all after the counts of his own will now here's the real meat of the sermon I want to get to right here just look at a few scriptures about how trials are allowed by God and we know as with Joe that God allowed Satan to bring all these trials upon Joe in order to frustrate job's purpose in life he wanted job to be frustrated you want a job to give up and curse God he really didn't want job dead he just wanted job to curse God okay so we got to make sure we never lay any evil to God's account if God doesn't answer our prayer for 5-meter first we should still send raise the Lord maybe the next five years I know havens gonna be praying for a horse for many years maybe maybe a few more years but each year she should say praise the Lord you know I'd like to be a full-time pastor and each year the passes I'm not I gotta say praise the Lord it's it's going to be in God's time or it's not going to be in God's plan we got to have enough love in our heart to know that God has ordered all of our steps according to his word according to his good counsel and His purposes must be accomplished in our lives not so much our purposes but the purposes of God so our text was job's 17 and it was so awful for job job thought corruptions my father and worms are my mother and sister hi I'm family members with worms it was so awful for and but the main verse I want to point out again was 11 17 11 my days are past my purposes are broken off even the intents of my heart I remember when I broke my AC joint I couldn't even move my arm I heard a crack and that that that joint fractured a broke and I heard the crack and it was instant pain and just paint got worse and worse and had to recover for you know I think it was four months and then had surgery and it was broken I was just broken had to be had to be had tied to heal it's very painful and some job has a spiritual pain of seeing his children pass away seeing his animals all died and being robbed and everything spoiled from him and then losing his health and he says my purposes are broken off I don't even have a purpose to live I don't have a purpose to go on the message of the hour I've lost my reputation right I've lost my church I've lost my family everything good about my message church and family is lost my purposes are all broken away from me they said my families I'm a family member of worms I don't know how you could get much lower than that do you children how could you get much lower than that I know more purpose everything I want to do is just down the the drain it's all ruined and my families I'm not even I don't have a human family anymore I'm family with worms it's about as low as you could get well what fruit was God producing again patience patience God wanted him to be in an example that you and I can look to for patience long job to get through this difficult time then surely I can get through it at least I've got my health or at least I saw my family I'm gonna lost all my money but at least I got my family I can make it through this I just got to be a little more patient that's right now wondering this quote this is from then Jesus came and called it brother man's making the point that Jesus shows up in your darkest hour and uses all these examples of Moses and Mary Mary and Martha and all these things after class was already died but he used his job and I just want to reiterate this again when all this distress came upon Joe his friends turned their back on him and accused him of being a secretive sinner I don't know if you've gone through that lately but hopefully you haven't had to endure that but job's friends literally turn their back now think about that if you had it so bad where your friends won't even text you back your pastor won't even text you back I mean that's very few people I try to text everybody back as far as I know your family turns their back you know Joe Matt is his life you know told me curse God and die his friends turned their back on him and yet he still never said anything wrong about God he said his wife turned him down everybody turned him down he said his breath was strange to his wife and all the things that happened to him and looked like even God turned him down look like it but it wasn't and he's going to die and go to the ground and God spoke to him and said now Joe gird up your loins I'm gonna talk with you and then God said you see the tree never send the flower never sin it served its purpose therefore was Dermott eyes one to another it didn't sin so it rises up again but a man that sins therefore he's cut off he said then Joe began to wander and then they got this dress just like Martha did when Lazarus died in the darkest hour when all of his influence had he lived it in vain so see he's wondering as I'm I lived in vain have all my purposes for being alive and cut off how would he speak to Joe he's a prophet how would God speak to him and my man said God spoke to him in a vision and brother man dramatizes it and he said the thunders roared the lightning flash and then Jesus came along and he said he saw Jesus in a vision and said I know my Redeemer liveth at the last days he shall stand upon this earth though the skin worms destroy this body yet in my flesh I shall see God whom I shall see the darkest hour then Jesus come along praise God we've got to be willing to wait until the darkest hour be willing to wrestle and fight against the devil push him back moving back and say noise there's still a purpose there's still something that God's trying to accomplish things are still not out of cater things are still as God planned I'm gonna put my trust me pretty soon Jesus Christ will show up amen now eventually see in chapter 17 job said my purposes are broken off my family's a bunch of worms you know I'm worms with family I'm sorry there's worms but in job 23 verse 8 job finally gets this understanding that this is a trial and that God's not against him but he gets this understanding it's a trial job 23-8 behold I go forward but he's not there and backward but I cannot perceive him on the left hand where he doth work but I cannot behold him he hides himself on the right hand that I cannot see him so he admits it's hard to find God this time in my life but he knoweth the way that I take when he tried me I shall come forth as gold so Joe finally gets their understanding this is a trial I can't feel God I'm not feeling his present I don't feel enthusiastic I don't feel goosebumps I don't see the Holy Spirit moving all around me but God knows who's the my integrity in other words God knows the ways that I'm passed I'm stepping in God knows the decisions I'm making and when he's tried me when he's finished trying me I'll come for with his gold amen and Peter said the same thing the fiery trials are more precious than what precious than gold so see what and that's how it is many times they begin a trial we think oh did I fail God is God done with me did I do something wrong and but pretty soon joke is understanding this is a trial I've just got to pass the test I've got it not say anything bad I'm just going to get through this and I know I'll be stronger at the other end aren't you glad God encourages us that at some point in our trial we finally get the revelation we just got to be faithful when this gets over we're gonna be stronger than we ever were before amen now chapter 23 go down to verse 14 I'll just skip ahead a little bit now I'm trying to go to 11 2311 my foot hath held his steps look he's he knows it he knows he's kept the Word of God his way of I kept and not declined neither I my going back from the commandment of his lips I've esteemed the words of his mouth more than my necessary food so see this is what Joe had finally understood Joe realized what God had already told the devil Jobe is the what a perfect man right Joe had made the sacrifices he was trusting in the blood he was trusting God for by the way and he said I know I've got the commands of God this is a trial verse 13 but he is of one mind hey who can turn him so sees that not three minds not three persons right God does have three minds three personalities got one mind who can turn him in what his soul desires even that he doeth verse 14 for he perform it the thing that is appointed for me such things are within so church be encouraged everything that has happened where it doesn't seem like it's right you search your life you feel like you have a life of integrity you haven't done anything purposely against God wrong we must have the same understanding his job that this is a trial God's going to make me a better Christian at the end of this and he is just performing what he's already appointed God had this appointed God knew this was going to happen in 2019 if we're still going through it in 20 January 2019 God knew I'd go through this and God is with me he's gonna bring me through it I'll be better on the other end go to Ezra 4 verse 5 Malcolm this room when he's ready Ezra 4 or 5 so here's another example about purpose and how we must understand trials are allowed by God but Satan tries to use those trials to make us give up on God's purpose in our life Jobe didn't give up though he felt like it he thought the purposes were all broken off but later he realized this is a trial to produce a better godly gold character my life Azra 4/5 yeah chapter 4 verse 5 alright so we know the scripture about zarubin being allowed to leave Babylon and come back to Jerusalem in order to rebuild the temple but the scripture plainly tells us even in the Nazareth writings here that once ezra got there he restored them all but the scripture plainly tells us that these evil men hired people just to frustrate god's people trying to restore the word of god for their age amen just like we're trying to restore true worship true worship under the right baptism in jesus christ name full immersion with the promise to receive the Holy Ghost we're trying to restore God's worship God's altar but yet Satan has planned all these ways to try to frustrate us try to discourage us and we just have to recognize and remember that's this is Satan's job he's trying to frustrate us we've just got to overcome frustration so we've got to be encouraged not be frustrated and that will help us overcome all the works of the devil the Bible said don't be ignorant of Satan's devices so you must recognize this is a device so this is a plan this is an attack of Satan our lives are pure he's just trying to frustrate God's / in my life and it's aruba bull could overcome satan's frustrations then we can because we've got the blood of Jesus Christ amen alright now let's go to 2nd Corinthians 1 verse 17 this is a scripture I've never really preached but it just says it plainly that we must not live according to purposes of the flesh we must live based upon eternal purposes we must let God's in eternal intentions direct our steps drive us forward not fleshly desires to drive a sport so sang Corinthians 1:17 lynnie can you read that for us [Music] okay so important in thien's he asked them to give an account of his purpose was was Paul guiding them by God's eternal purposes or was Paul guiding them by the the purposes of the flesh we know the Bible says in Jude that false preachers they have a god but their God is their belly they're only after feeding themselves helping themselves so they a basically are their own God right they they become their own idols right but Paul we know Paul did everything he could do to try to show the people he said he had all the rights to marry to take tithes and offerings he said I did none of those that I might be unblameable with the gospel so let this be a reminder that our purposes must not be of the flesh they must be of the holy spirit that's why I want to ask the church you know I remind everybody you know come early to the church if you feel led to do prayer meeting that's that's not a fleshly thing that's easy for the flesh to do prayer always takes crucified the flesh like Perry green said he said people say the 1940s and 50s was a revival it was easy to pray but he said it was never easy to pray it always took a sacrifice see the flesh must be crucified and it must be crucified not every Sunday but every day because we die daily so this is something that we gotta get a habit of doing every day dime died Wednesday died Thursday died Friday night Saturday and then the the blessings of all those deaths to the flesh will be felled on Sunday then we can bring a revelation that we can bring a doctrine then we can bring a dream or a prophecy then we can bring that if we crucify the flesh every day ok almost done here in these last few scriptures I would look at again recalling how we live with a purpose we have to know our purpose first God drives you to your purpose whether through trials before you're saved or maybe you're maybe you believe you're saved in a church but then God will drive you to the message of the hour like for me God drove me to the message of the hour through brother Simon and the Twin Towers falling 9/11 2001 on September 11 2001 that drove Simon to Bible study right and it's that that the word drove Simon to to bring it to me then of course you know I was hungry for God and I was always before the message came I was always wanting to hear preachers who had deeper teachings so God was driving me to deep teaching I went from you know just evangelical to to Baptist so evangelical water down to Baptist I was really enjoying the deep Baptist you know Christian hedonism teachings and so that prepared me to go deep or that when I heard the Serpent's see the message I could receive it because I've already gone a little deeper God was driving me to be able to hear this a hunger thirst for the true Word of God ok so let's just look at a few more scriptures before we close now acts 11 22 X 11 22 a missionary named Barnabas visited these Saints and when he leaves them listen to what he tells them and this is important for us because we've got to remember what purpose did we first have when we started out in the message some people was more it was a prayer life or they had a stroke passing out tracts think about that first love for God a purpose that you had and do we have that do we have that now that's we're gonna ask ourselves all right so just want to read that there so Barnabas was sent from Jerusalem out to the Saints to encourage the Saints these are new message believers and what his Barneses Barnabas's were to them he exhorted them that means to build them up he build him up and said with purpose of heart either cleave that means glue glue unto the word unto the Lord unto the holy spirit that's why I mentioned that earlier if we don't feel glued or connected to the word or to the prayer life or the witness and we used to the Bible study we used to do that then we've got to get back to that with Satan maybe have distracted us from our purpose and we've forgotten what God's intention was for our lives praise God so live with the purpose never know what God has called you to do know God's intention for your life this is what Holy Ghost filled Saints in the original book of Acts Church told the Saints to do so I know I'm preaching the word got tonight I know I'm preaching fresh manna the original Word of God everyone in our church needs to know their purpose and with their heart obey it from the heart not just from the mind I know I got to but pray until it's it agrees with your heart that yes in my heart I love them with this word of God and more with my heart I want to serve your purpose on this earth alright next a couple more here let's go to Daniel chapter one Daniel 1 verse 8 can you just Daniel one eights are working on those pipes at the same time just to see how they're doing now Daniel 1/8 now living with purpose but Daniel purposed in his heart that he would not defile himself with the portion of the Kings meat nor with the wine which he drank therefore he requested the Prince of the eunuchs that he might not defy them so think about this Oh church if you just hear me I'm trying to hear her the Holy Spirit myself Daniels ministry was so great because he was so disciplined to God's purpose he was so disciplined to being undefiled and I hope that can be an encouragement to us tonight even our children and myself when you wake up tomorrow morning or when you go to bed tonight you have to know the purpose and our purpose can be this it can be this I am NOT going to be defiled with whenever I've been struggling with I'm not going to be defiled with hatred I'm not going to be the foul with bitterness I'm not going to be the file with hopelessness or depression or greed or covetousness or lust I'm not going to be defiled by this app on my phone I'm not going to be the file by that Hollywood movie that I want to see that you have to have that purpose in your heart Daniel this purpose I will not be defiled I know it's going to defile me or what could have found me so it's my purpose not to be defiled and that's very similar to the one we just saw in Acts chapter 11 my purpose is the cleave to God I am cleaving to the word I'm not going to cleave to the Kings meat right I'm not going to cleave to the temptations of the world just like Samson lost that purpose he should have his purpose should've and I'm not going to give away my secret of my power but he did it he eventually gave that up he got he didn't cleave to the purpose of God like he could have right and so you can go through each person down through down through the Bible Moses and no and all these ones cleaving to God's purpose that was his purpose in life and that and I think that should be written down he knows this in the game Smith sermon from two years ago today he preached on having goals and maintaining goals and he said you know we Christians need to write it down and I agree we need to write it down if you've got a goal write it down meditate on it think upon it because if it's God's leadership it's good to write it down it's good to think about it it's good to meditate on it because if that helps you meditate that will help you overcome because remember there's eight things you can think I remember the eight things from Philippians four there's eight channels what sort of things are good holy pure of good report think on those things when you're writing it down you're thinking about that meditate on it make it that's my purpose I'm not going to be defiled by lust or bitterness or greed I'm not gonna be to file my purpose is to cleave to the Word of God and what did it produce in Daniels life a powerful testimony of a true prophet of God amen a man that predicted prophecies that are still coming to pass and mercy will finish coming to pass after the bride is even rapture the last three nine weeks of Daniel seventy weeks amen that's what that kind of purpose and devotion and dedication of Jesus Christ can produce in our lives it can have ramifications beyond our lifetime into the next life times in the next generations and and so forth hallelujah let's close to this this beyond that scripture so children you can stand you everybody can stand at home if they like to Psalm 17 Psalm 17 I've known people that could use this scripture maybe this is their purpose maybe their purpose is at oh I don't want to be Lord I need to help me not to be defiled with this at work or help me not to be to file with this in my home baby you have to have a purpose not to be defiled by things that come out of your mouth if that's the case then you got a defiled heart you got to get the heart clean first because from the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks but this is something David battle this is something David prayed for and if David prayed for it we can pray for it so I'm 17 1 a prayer of David here the right Oh Lord attended to my cry give ear unto my prayer that goeth not out of feigned lips so he wasn't playing around he just wasn't well the brothers preaching on it I'll say I'm sorry no it wasn't pretend it was truly sincere let my sentence come forth from thy presence let thine eyes behold the things that are equal thou has proved my heart that I was visited me in the night that I was tried me and shall find nothing I am purposed that my mouth shall not transgress hey I think about that that was David's purpose I will not transgress with my mouth I will not say anything sinful Daniels purpose was I'm not eating to file I'm not going to follow us up with the Kings meat Barnabas said your purpose in your heart should be cleaved to God and here David said my purpose is not to say anything evil with my mouth verse 4 concerning the works of men by the word of that lips I I have kept me from the pass of the destroyer hold up my goings in thy past that my footsteps slip down I have caught up on me for thou won't hear me o God incline on hearing to me and hear my speech shew thy marvellous loving-kindness Oh thou save us by thy right hand then which put their trust in thee from those that rise up against them amen Church I trust God spoke to your heart tonight when that beautiful I turned out much better or not my carnal mind thought so I know that I'm not thinking with my mind I'm thinking with the mind of Christ tonight we've got to have a purpose we got to go to bed with the purpose right down that purpose pray about that purpose lead God call upon God for that purpose and purposed it from your heart where there's nothing sit with your lips not to be the file with sinful things whether it's I need to clean clothes ER to God I need to be like glue on God God will help you [Music] let's bow our heads there's your in your homes if you can you might be watching children you might not be able to bow your head there if you can bow your head just bow your head let me have a word of Prayer for you Heavenly Father thank you for the word that we've heard today there's so many benefits to the fivefold ministry it has such an eternal purpose your prophets in you are Dane that I stand here preached and you are dated they would sit there and hear the word of God bless each one of us we serve your purpose tonight how they do you thank you Jesus glory to your father head help each person forgiven if they know anything wrong help them to have a purpose in their heart not be the file with simple things to not let any evil word come out of their mouths and to be like glue [Music] oh Jesus hallelujah thank you we call upon you Jesus help us to have a purpose apart of our hearts to feel your purpose for us well I've continued to pray make us a mature Church we know we will be if we hear the preaching the five more minutes remove light to our lives and we bring revelation all these things that we heard tonight I believe the prophecy of this Word of God is working the bride of Jesus Christ around the world I know it to produce that the original church and by your grace in numbers Oh God let us be a part of that as we know your company is even closer this week than it was last we should he should feel closer to we should be able to poll the Holy Spirit to be more sincere Jesus help us to know the purpose of your call and leave to in tune now reveal to us what our furnace needs to be tonight whether it's watching our words leaving more to your word not be defile with things I must to see the blessings of God in our lives for these requests we made over to you Jesus Christ Oh [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all nations [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] goodbye [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music]
