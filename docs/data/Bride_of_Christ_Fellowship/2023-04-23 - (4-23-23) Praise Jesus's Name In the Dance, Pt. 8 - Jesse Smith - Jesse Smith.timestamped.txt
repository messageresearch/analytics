[0:38] yeah I've been reading through the

[0:41] 119 this morning
[0:44] at the longest chapter in the entire
[0:47] Bible
[0:49] just filled with such beautiful thoughts
[0:52] I wanted to preach it this morning but I
[0:54] don't know if I got enough or enough
[0:56] time to do that actually I might run out
[0:58] of time
[0:59] but Lord wouldn't maybe we'll look at
[1:00] that on Wednesday by God's grace just a
[1:02] beautiful chapter if you haven't read
[1:03] that in a while I'd encourage you to
[1:05] consider reading that
[1:07] it's as long as the entire book of
[1:09] Philippians that one chapter you know
[1:12] the same length
[1:13] length any short book of the Bible it's
[1:14] just beautiful
[1:16] the Treasure Trove of blessings praise

[1:24] I'll read one and two and then we can
[1:25] all read verse three together Praise You
[1:27] the Lord sing unto the Lord a new song
[1:29] and praise His name in the congregation
[1:31] of saints let Israel rejoice in him that
[1:35] made him let the children of Zion be
[1:37] joyful in their King let's read verse
[1:40] three ready one two three let them

[1:46] sing praises unto him with the timbrel
[1:49] and heart I just got to read four and
[1:51] five for the lord taketh pleasure in
[1:53] bride of Christ Fellowship

[2:03] High Praise of God be in their mouth and
[2:05] a two-edged sword in their hand praise
[2:09] may God as blessings to the reading of
[2:10] his word you may be seated praise God
[2:14] I'm just feeling you know led to can
[2:16] kind of continue on this thought here by
[2:18] God's grace
[2:20] so we'll keep going here and try to pull
[2:23] out as many
[2:25] encouraging thoughts as possible this
[2:27] morning you know the title of course
[2:29] praised his name with the dance boat the
[2:30] subtopic is we'd say maybe the joy of
[2:33] the Lord we want to look at that this
[2:35] morning here by God's grace
[2:40] and God has given us many reasons to be
[2:42] joyful praise God so
[2:45] the song says count your blessings name
[2:47] them one by one praise God
[2:49] and you'll see what the Lord has done
[2:51] hallelujah he's done so much for us
[2:53] praise God
[2:54] I'd like to minister here also uh we'll
[2:57] forget to announce this brother uh but
[2:59] Austin's in a little a little contest
[3:01] there
[3:01] singing for Christian music so if you
[3:04] want to vote for him I think it's five
[3:05] bucks to vote for him you know so I put
[3:07] a vote in for our family this morning
[3:09] actually I put in
[3:11] a number of votes this morning for our
[3:12] family put a few extra votes in there
[3:15] for her
[3:16] but I think the church gets the money
[3:19] back is that right does it go to the
[3:20] charitable
[3:22] three percent
[3:27] okay praise God
[3:30] so uh we're thankful and it's just an
[3:33] encouraging way you know it's a good way
[3:34] to get uh
[3:36] you know brother it's a good way for
[3:37] brother Austin to use his gift for the
[3:38] Lord you know he's already got a couple
[3:40] testimonies back like oh this song
[3:41] blessed me I remember that one woman
[3:42] she's like I just played this for hours
[3:44] and hours on end you know remember
[3:46] you know that's how I do it too I'll
[3:48] find a song like I really like it I'll
[3:49] just put repeat one just play that all
[3:52] day
[3:54] I think when I was going in to preach it
[3:56] in the point where we had those Revival
[3:57] Services I think I played Sunday's
[3:59] coming for four straight days I think
[4:01] I'm not mistaken maybe three straight
[4:03] days
[4:05] Friday's good but Sunday's coming praise
[4:07] God
[4:08] so that's why I swear I normally do I
[4:10] just wear the song out praise God and
[4:12] then yeah you give a couple years it'll
[4:14] come back to the right season we'll sing
[4:15] that again you know
[4:16] like God's good think about that I mean
[4:17] think about how many years are we saying
[4:19] uh God has given us the victory I rose
[4:21] up this morning and it comes back yeah
[4:23] you say oh you're off it for a little
[4:24] while comes back it's fresh it's brand
[4:26] new like you never sang it praise God
[4:28] so uh we just want to say yeah if you if
[4:32] you want to feel led to vote you know I
[4:33] got the link I can share that maybe I'll
[4:34] do that maybe I'll share the link here
[4:36] probably easiest for me to do it since I
[4:38] I do the group text on
[4:39] uh the phones there but by God's grace
[4:43] we'd like to support our brother there
[4:45] so thank the Lord for him amen sister
[4:47] leaning there praise God hallelujah
[4:50] so I'd like to look at this dance series
[4:51] want to keep this going and like I said
[4:53] look at the joy of the Lord
[4:54] because it's so closely connected uh two
[4:58] dancing and so forth
[5:01] and you know we know the enemies work in
[5:03] overtime to take away our joy
[5:06] or or I should say like this maybe to
[5:09] distract us from our joy
[5:11] because I want to I want to remember you
[5:13] want to remember that
[5:14] if you're born again your soul has
[5:17] eternal life
[5:18] the soul can never sin so that means the
[5:21] soul always has Joy
[5:24] it always has peace right the the soul
[5:27] always has faith
[5:28] because it's God's Own spirit it's God's
[5:31] own life but what happens is we didn't
[5:32] we don't lose our joy what we do is we
[5:35] get distracted from our joy
[5:37] and we choose to uh or we just make the
[5:39] choice or you know when situations are
[5:42] forced upon us uh you know we we get
[5:45] distracted from the word of God and from
[5:48] the the blessing of God in our soul and
[5:50] then we get what's called and we get
[5:52] into mind battles we we got to go out to
[5:54] the battlefield to fight a fresh battle
[5:57] you know and uh and and so we're taking
[5:59] out to those battle the battlefield and
[6:01] we gotta fight and battle and it just so
[6:03] happens on many Wednesday nights and
[6:05] Sundays uh God gives us many victories
[6:07] praise God and we had to come back and
[6:10] sing and worship and the Music cast
[6:11] devils and help cast Devils out of our
[6:13] minds right you know mind battles and we
[6:16] get the victory on the battlefield
[6:17] praise God Amen we can remember all the
[6:20] blessings that God gives us in the soul
[6:22] praise God the life of God there in the
[6:25] soul and uh so you know we don't lose
[6:28] our joy uh you know David said that you
[6:31] know restore restore the joy
[6:33] and of course you know the Holy Ghost
[6:35] couldn't fall in the soul in his day so
[6:36] in his case that was restoring the joy
[6:39] in the mind and and we can say that's
[6:40] the same for us we need Joy restored in
[6:42] our mindset
[6:43] we've got to choose to meditate on the
[6:46] joyful things of God
[6:48] and that's that's where that scripture
[6:50] applies to us in the New Testament
[6:51] remember we are under a New Covenant
[6:52] better promises Hallelujah
[6:55] amen thank God and just remember the
[6:57] connection there with joy and dancing
[6:58] again uh you know this is the first time
[7:00] the dance and joy is used together
[7:02] together in the Bible within the same
[7:04] few verses after David got the victory
[7:06] came to pass as they came David was
[7:08] returned from the slaughter of the
[7:09] Philistine that the women came out of
[7:12] all the cities of Israel singing and
[7:13] dance notice the women
[7:15] to meet King Saul with tabots with joy
[7:18] and when with instruments of music
[7:20] praise God
[7:22] and the women answer one another as they
[7:24] played and said Saul as slain as
[7:26] thousands and David is ten thousands
[7:28] Hallelujah
[7:30] Glory thank God so again we see the
[7:33] connection wherever there's joy there's
[7:35] dancing
[7:36] praise God and so we're we're we're
[7:38] taught this by the word of God we can
[7:40] see it plainly from the scripture uh
[7:43] Jeremiah 31 13 then shall the Virgin
[7:46] rejoice in the dance both young man and
[7:50] old together for I will turn their
[7:52] mourning into Joy and Will Comfort them
[7:56] and make them Rejoice from their sorrow
[7:59] Hallelujah we also know this is earlier
[8:01] in the chapter yeah let me go back here
[8:02] to Jeremiah 31 I think earlier in the
[8:04] chapter if God gives the promise to
[8:06] bring
[8:07] Joy back so just bear with me here let
[8:09] me turn to Jeremiah 31.
[8:11] I think I preached this earlier in the
[8:13] series here
[8:16] yep there it is praise God yeah let's go
[8:18] to verse three Jeremiah 31 3 if you got
[8:20] your Bibles the Lord had the period of
[8:21] old unto me saying yea I have loved thee
[8:23] with an everlasting love
[8:26] somebody ought to say Amen to that
[8:27] praise God if God loved Israel that much
[8:29] he also said the same about the Gentiles
[8:32] praise God remember in Romans chapter 9
[8:34] he said he said I will call people that
[8:36] were not my people I will call them my
[8:38] beloved amen hallelujah the ones that I
[8:40] love amen I have lovely with an
[8:42] Everlasting Love Therefore with loving
[8:44] kindness have I drawn thee that's how
[8:47] God draws you closer to him he shows you
[8:50] his love
[8:51] he shows you his care
[8:53] he shows you his provision he shows you
[8:56] the cross again amen he shows you the
[8:59] resurrection hallelujah praise God he
[9:01] shows you all these blessings the great
[9:04] loving kindness and that draws us closer
[9:07] back into fellowship with him praise God
[9:09] he reminds us of all that he's done for
[9:10] us praise God
[9:12] and I like verse four again what a
[9:14] promise we have church again I will
[9:16] build thee so you may feel like you know
[9:18] life has tore me down it's it's it's
[9:21] broken up all all the bricks of my life
[9:24] where we'd say or you know uh it's
[9:26] broken down the walls with my trials and
[9:28] my all the battles I face has just tore
[9:31] me down but God said I will build thee
[9:34] again amen
[9:35] and thou shalt be built o Virgin of
[9:38] Israel Thou shalt again be adorned with
[9:41] thy tablets
[9:42] and shall go forth in the dances of them
[9:46] that make Mary praise God
[9:49] your life your life may look uh
[9:51] destroyed it may look defeated it may
[9:53] look downtrodden but God said I'll build
[9:55] you up again I'll draw you unto me with
[9:57] my love amen hallelujah and I'll make
[10:00] you I'll give you a reason to dance amen
[10:02] I'll give you a reason to praise the
[10:04] Lord hallelujah amen what a blessing
[10:07] praise God
[10:08] I just want you if you got your Bibles
[10:09] there let's go to uh Psalm 119 there I
[10:12] want to read this for just for a
[10:14] reference here
[10:16] church I you know I preached it there
[10:17] you know and the point also here too but
[10:19] remember if if you're waiting on God
[10:21] remind God of his promises
[10:24] remember it's okay to complain as long
[10:27] as you're telling the situation but end
[10:29] the complaint with hope praise God and
[10:31] then you quote Psalm 119 49 and 50.
[10:36] that's what we need to quote
[10:37] this is uh anointed now some people
[10:39] think Hezekiah wrote this chapter some
[10:41] people think David they don't say but it
[10:44] is one of Just A Beautiful chapter of
[10:46] the longest chapter in the Bible
[10:47] now look here's the prayer here's the
[10:49] psalm verse 49. Psalm 119 49 remember
[10:53] the word unto thy servant upon which
[10:58] thou has caused me to Hope
[11:01] he's saying God you're the one who made
[11:04] the promise you caused me to Hope in it
[11:07] now now I'm saying remember that promise
[11:09] amen amen amen so it just shows God
[11:11] doesn't answer every prayer immediately
[11:13] you know God doesn't give you every
[11:15] promise right when you want it and God
[11:18] in verse 50 this is my comfort in my
[11:21] affliction
[11:23] for the word hath quickened me praise
[11:25] God
[11:26] so when we're going through trials God
[11:28] wants us to remind him of his promises
[11:31] Lord remember you gave me this promise
[11:33] you wrote this in your word I'm
[11:35] reminding you of what you said this
[11:36] caused me to hope this scripture
[11:38] actually quickens me praise God
[11:41] this scripture actually encourages me
[11:43] and when I go through the trials Lord
[11:45] I'm going to remind you of your promises
[11:47] because I know you keep your word praise
[11:49] God that's why Jesus said keep knocking
[11:51] keep asking keep seeking God will open
[11:53] God will show it to us but God likes to
[11:55] see his children confess his promises
[11:58] back to him praise God
[12:00] God likes to see his children quote his
[12:02] own promise Hallelujah
[12:04] amen praise God
[12:06] I read that this morning I'm like that
[12:07] was yesterday and it might have been
[12:08] yesterday
[12:09] he calls me to Hope but I don't see it
[12:12] manifesting but then he says remember he
[12:14] says we're supposed to tell God remember
[12:16] your promise amen
[12:18] hallelujah praise God let's remind God
[12:21] what he said amen let me just remind God
[12:23] lord you promise to send a lot of rain
[12:25] hallelujah amen you promised a Rapture a
[12:29] bride who would not taste death
[12:31] Hallelujah
[12:32] praise God
[12:34] you promised to Philippian Jailer that
[12:37] die in thy house shall be saved God
[12:39] grant that God grant that great blessing
[12:41] to me praise God
[12:43] I know I'm not the Philippian Jailer but
[12:45] Lord I got the same desire I was
[12:47] baptized and I want to see the same
[12:49] faith in all my family members amen
[12:52] I really remember your promise Lord God
[12:55] amen so here's a promise here's a
[12:58] promise I'm going to give you a reason
[12:59] to dance again well the trouble is most
[13:02] message people never dance to begin with
[13:04] so that's the problem praise God
[13:06] and the reason is many times they don't
[13:08] experience the freedom of the Lord
[13:11] right the joy of the Lord or the other
[13:14] another reason could be they don't even
[13:16] really they never heard the real Gospel
[13:17] of Jesus Christ preach
[13:20] because when you really know the Gospel
[13:22] of Jesus Christ that all of your sin was
[13:25] put on Christ and then all of Christ's
[13:28] righteousness is put on you it has to
[13:31] produce something it has to produce a
[13:33] joy of God Amen
[13:35] hallelujah we're going to see it later
[13:37] even the Stony hearted person remember
[13:40] there's four kinds of hearts
[13:42] even the Stony heart which ended up
[13:43] being Judas not the Wayside that never
[13:46] believed it was a Sony or even the Sony
[13:48] heart when it heard the word Rejoice
[13:51] with joy
[13:54] even in church we're better than that
[13:56] it's by God's grace amen we're not a
[13:59] Sony hearted person that falls away When
[14:01] Trials come we keep believing praise God
[14:04] we keep having a good and honest heart
[14:07] praise God Amen and if Judas could have
[14:09] joy or or someone like that that fell
[14:11] away if someone could have joy and then
[14:13] Fall Away we should have joy and that
[14:15] Joy should continue amen like Jesus said
[14:18] he said I'm giving you my joy that's
[14:20] your joy might be full praise God
[14:22] Lord I don't want a half cup of Joy I
[14:25] wouldn't fall a cup of Joy amen Give Me
[14:27] A Reason devil at least a half a cup or
[14:30] a three-quarter cup or let my cup
[14:32] overflow amen amen sometimes we have
[14:36] overflowing Joy amen
[14:39] Hallelujah
[14:40] sometimes there are six hour Services
[14:42] too amen
[14:43] where the joys just overflowing my cup
[14:47] runs over praise God
[14:49] oh thank God Amen
[14:51] for the joy of the Lord amen
[14:55] and he promised that's right that was
[14:57] our prayer at the beginning of the year
[14:57] remember of 2023. that was our prayer
[15:00] Lord give us more reasons to rejoice
[15:02] give me more reasons to dance praise God
[15:05] I think sister Naomi was sharing after
[15:07] that Napoleon meeting she was Sharon I
[15:09] think it's okay if I share it you know
[15:11] she said her prayer at the beginning of
[15:12] January for the new year was Lord give
[15:14] us personal experiences with Jesus
[15:16] Christ
[15:18] we sure got them in Napoleon praise God
[15:20] right I thought what it was almost
[15:22] prophetic right for the little children
[15:24] they've been praying for a few years to
[15:25] get the Holy Ghost
[15:27] and I've just been preaching about eight
[15:29] or nine services on saith God I'll pour
[15:31] out my spear God pour out your spirit
[15:33] how many sermons did I preach that and I
[15:35] feel like God didn't pour out of the
[15:36] spirit
[15:38] and what should I have done I should
[15:39] have done just like the Bible said Lord
[15:40] remember your promise
[15:43] your promise caused me to hope that
[15:45] you'll pour out your spirit amen
[15:48] remember your word amen at the right
[15:50] time at the right season God will answer
[15:53] praise God
[15:55] amen hallelujah
[15:56] Glory
[15:59] God wants us to remember
[16:01] God wants us to Hope praise God God
[16:03] wants us to take all of our comfort
[16:06] not in Key Lime ice cream that's usually
[16:08] one of my favorites
[16:11] that we don't take comfort in that
[16:12] although sometimes it helps In the Flesh
[16:14] you know
[16:15] just a little bit now but God I'm just
[16:18] making a joke God don't want us to take
[16:20] any comfort and anything except the word
[16:22] of God hallelujah
[16:24] that's our comfort praise God
[16:27] amen
[16:30] he says this is my comfort and my
[16:31] Affliction for Thy word hath quickened
[16:34] me amen
[16:35] oh praise God hallelujah
[16:39] now remember again remember sin takes
[16:41] away the joy and the dance the joy of
[16:43] our heart is ceased our dances turn in
[16:45] the morning the crown has fallen from
[16:46] our head wound to us that we have sinned
[16:48] now that's a little bit a little bit of
[16:50] background let me just read a few more
[16:51] of these quotes here I got a couple of
[16:52] new ones here but they're very familiar
[16:55] as they March over Israel how beautiful
[16:57] that types our churches today how they
[16:58] cross through the Red Sea and then Moses
[17:00] began to sing in the spirit Miriam
[17:02] picked up the tambourine begin to dance
[17:03] just like an old-fashioned Holy Ghost
[17:06] meeting
[17:07] I like that they were dancing like an
[17:10] old-fashioned Holy Ghost meeting amen
[17:13] hallelujah praise God
[17:15] he said dancing and singing and praise
[17:17] the Lord why they had the victory they
[17:19] got the Victory and who got the victory
[17:21] for him was it Moses not exactly it was
[17:24] Christ amen
[17:26] Moses couldn't pull back the waters God
[17:28] just used Moses to move back the waters
[17:30] amen
[17:31] and when anything good happens in our
[17:33] midst it wasn't us it was God using us
[17:35] amen
[17:37] and that's why we rejoice in the victory
[17:39] Of God we've got the victory because
[17:41] Jesus gave us the victory
[17:43] oh amen
[17:45] grabbed a tambourine down by the bank
[17:47] she went beating this tamarine I ate
[17:49] like like what Cam said 86 years old
[17:51] being the damn right Hallelujah nobody's
[17:53] got an excuse here today praise God well
[17:55] I'm too old I'm too fragile no you're
[17:57] not actually you're just at about the
[17:58] right age amen you're actually kind of
[18:00] young for this calling and the daughter
[18:03] of his Israel Israel fouled her shouting
[18:04] and beating the tambourines and dancing
[18:06] and Moses sung in the spirit if that
[18:08] ain't an old-time Holy Ghost meeting I
[18:12] never seen one
[18:14] you got one man singing The Spirit uh
[18:17] he's up here singing and praising and
[18:19] you got all the sisters dancing and
[18:21] praising God and running around
[18:22] worshiping God everybody's praising God
[18:25] if that ain't an old Holy Ghost meeting
[18:27] I never seen one thank God we've seen
[18:29] him amen
[18:31] oh praise God that's why I told the
[18:33] children I said you ought to now be able
[18:35] to look at the book of Acts chapter 2
[18:37] and say I know what that's like amen
[18:40] I was acting like I was drunk in this
[18:42] beer
[18:43] I've ever saw Haven or Paris or Acacia
[18:46] drunk that was a day I thought they were
[18:47] drunk praise God
[18:49] hallelujah praise God Amen that's all we
[18:52] want praise God Amen so they have an
[18:55] experience with God they know God keeps
[18:57] his word they know God pours out his
[18:59] fear praise God and we can have
[19:00] old-fashioned Holy Ghost meetings amen
[19:03] [Music]
[19:04] [Applause]
[19:06] God Amen
[19:09] I like this brother random talks in the
[19:11] church age book talk about Israel
[19:14] they were the Pentecostals of their day
[19:17] so are we
[19:18] they had taken Refuge under the blood
[19:21] who's taking Refuge under the blood
[19:23] they'd all been baptized in the Red Sea
[19:24] I haven't even baptized in the name of
[19:25] the Lord Jesus Christ and they came up
[19:27] out of the waters singing this fear and
[19:30] dancing under the energy of the Holy
[19:32] Ghost
[19:34] what gives you that energy brother Jesse
[19:35] to dance the Holy Ghost gives you that
[19:37] energy
[19:38] is that right while Miriam the
[19:40] prophetess played her tambourine
[19:43] oh don't you love that praise God
[19:46] and I like my brother I said in the
[19:47] church in his book he said our spirit is
[19:49] clean
[19:51] our spirit is fresh
[19:54] it's sober nevertheless full of the joy
[19:58] of the Lord praise God
[20:01] oh church that's why I like that song
[20:03] Spirit of the Living God fall fresh on
[20:06] me
[20:07] give me a fresh feeling about coming to
[20:09] church give me a fresh feeling about
[20:11] reading my Bible about loving my family
[20:13] loving my children and loving God's
[20:15] people make it fresh Lord God because
[20:17] that's what your spirit is it's fresh
[20:19] hallelujah it's not stale like a
[20:21] denomination it's fresh praise God
[20:24] come on somebody amen
[20:28] it's fresh it's clean
[20:30] he said we just ought to be as just as
[20:32] exuberant about our religion as the
[20:35] world is about the NBA playoffs
[20:38] right
[20:39] whatever they got going on now maybe I
[20:41] don't know what they got going on in
[20:42] April
[20:44] some some heathenism somewhere probably
[20:46] no doubt
[20:49] but see it's the energy of the Holy
[20:51] Spirit praise God
[20:54] that produces this kind of worship I'm
[20:56] glad to be a Pentecostal of this day
[20:58] Hallelujah
[20:59] amen thank God now here's here's just a
[21:03] little balancing here now
[21:05] brother said now stand now when we're
[21:07] dancing like that we're not standing by
[21:08] the angel of the Lord
[21:10] we're just Anointed with the whole where
[21:11] I say just Anointed with the Holy Ghost
[21:15] see because because he says standing by
[21:17] the angel Lord you think you'll be
[21:19] shouting and screaming and of course you
[21:20] can take this back to the scripture you
[21:22] know John was in the presence of Jesus
[21:23] in Revelation 1 and he fell down like he
[21:24] was dead
[21:26] right Daniel had to Daniel fell down
[21:28] before the angel the angel had to touch
[21:30] him and raise him up
[21:32] he said uh that that degree of the
[21:36] spirit of God scares you to death nearly
[21:38] so there's a difference in rejoicing and
[21:40] bubble dancing I like bubbles because
[21:42] bubbles come from rushing waters
[21:45] and Jesus said when you got the Holy
[21:47] Ghost it's like a living water that
[21:49] bubbles up inside you amen yes I do
[21:52] bubble dance because I've got a living
[21:54] water bubbling up in me praise God
[21:57] of course
[21:58] I feel like I wrote a man cause of
[21:59] bubble dancing
[22:01] [Applause]
[22:02] bubbling is fresh water Hallelujah
[22:05] Artesian whale it's fresh water it's
[22:08] straight from God Almighty amen the
[22:11] Fountain of all goodness Purity and love
[22:15] but he said then coming down to that
[22:16] real thing yeah it's a fearful thing not
[22:19] that you fear that you're lost but
[22:21] you're really
[22:22] before Angelic being in the Holy Ghost
[22:23] himself standing there now Church let's
[22:25] just think about how often is that going
[22:27] to happen in our lives
[22:29] how often do you get to stand in the
[22:30] presence of an angel I don't maybe once
[22:32] in my life even then I'm guessing I
[22:34] don't even know there's times I felt
[22:36] like I was going to die worshiping God
[22:37] praying or singing or praying or
[22:39] something like that very few
[22:43] so some people will take this and
[22:45] they'll go to seed on this
[22:46] well we're too mature for bubble dancing
[22:48] and we need the fear of God well you
[22:50] need both actually you need both praise
[22:52] God the Bible said the Holy Ghost
[22:54] produces joy in your life that's what
[22:55] we're going to focus on this morning
[22:57] the Holy Ghost will produce joy in your
[23:00] life
[23:01] Hallelujah
[23:04] and of course I'm not going to ask you
[23:05] raise hands but who could feel like they
[23:07] need more joy expressed in their life so
[23:09] yeah
[23:13] even in Biden's economy yes even in
[23:15] Biden's economy yes
[23:19] two more good quotes and I noticed how
[23:21] dancing was the victory I thought well
[23:23] maybe I just hadn't got Victory enough
[23:26] maybe that's what it is maybe just a
[23:28] little bit of self has to die out yet
[23:32] like those other quotes brother Adam
[23:34] said it was Pride that kept him from
[23:36] dancing
[23:38] Pride
[23:40] self-confidence
[23:43] I know all about it I'm in control see
[23:45] God wants you to lose control praise God
[23:47] so he can take control Hallelujah
[23:51] that's right
[23:53] he said I was never on a dance floor in
[23:55] my life but I guess I did it all right
[23:57] that's the same thing I say
[24:00] now I did dance for the world I know I
[24:02] did it awful there
[24:03] was God tell me my friends told me they
[24:06] said you don't have any beat you don't
[24:07] have any rhythm you can't dance I said
[24:08] that's exactly right I never said I did
[24:10] actually
[24:11] but when I dance for Jesus all I can say
[24:13] is I guess I do it all right
[24:17] but I sure found awful good and I've had
[24:21] a lot of victory since I've been dancing
[24:24] the church said amen
[24:29] because I don't care what anybody else
[24:30] thinks I care what Jesus thinks amen
[24:34] that'd be all right then I guess
[24:36] I got a little special treat for us
[24:38] today here
[24:40] I brought my
[24:43] I brought my thimble
[24:45] I brought my washboard today
[24:47] I told my family we're going to worship
[24:49] like it's 1933.
[24:52] brother Brown is a pastor he's teaching
[24:54] for four and a half hours
[24:55] I said I've got one desire
[24:58] that I might dwell in the house of the
[25:00] Lord
[25:00] all the days of my life
[25:03] Hallelujah so he taught for four and a
[25:06] half hours he took a break and he let
[25:08] these people come up and this group of
[25:10] sisters
[25:11] is that right
[25:13] and they started playing and beating on
[25:15] the tambourine and beating on the on the
[25:18] washboard
[25:22] there's my rhythm there
[25:25] and Broadband said
[25:27] imagine my Tabernacle this is horrible
[25:30] in my Tabernacle
[25:33] then he goes in he says this is terrible
[25:36] this has happened in my he said turning
[25:38] my Tabernacle into a bar room he said
[25:44] and he said I was in the seat of the
[25:46] scornful so brother Mann was looking
[25:48] down on some sisters that would dance
[25:50] and say there's going to be a meeting in
[25:55] the air in that sweet sweet bye
[26:01] I'm going to meet you great to over
[26:06] there in that home
[26:14] never heard my modeling they'll be
[26:18] glorious
[26:23] Hallelujah
[26:30] [Applause]
[26:35] brother answer that's terrible until he
[26:37] started thinking about
[26:39] until you start thinking about is that
[26:41] in the Bible
[26:44] and he said yeah that's right Miriam was
[26:46] the first one that danced in the Bible
[26:48] and then he started patting his foot and
[26:51] he said before I knew it I was out there
[26:53] dancing with the blonde girl singing and
[26:55] praising God I sure felt awful good
[26:57] church it's so good to feel awful good
[27:00] amen hallelujah
[27:02] the joy of the Lord amen
[27:06] I didn't hear you now someone to use
[27:07] this after service he sure can praise
[27:09] God
[27:10] I'm just going to say like this this is
[27:12] my instrument praise God
[27:15] I'll share it
[27:17] see Church
[27:19] you sure feel awful good when you're
[27:22] worshiping God
[27:24] because that's what you're created to do
[27:26] amen
[27:29] thank God
[27:31] I did maybe I did all right I don't know
[27:33] but I sure feel awful good praise God
[27:35] when I praise the Lord
[27:36] amen I just thought I'd give you a
[27:39] visual what it must have been like and
[27:40] brother Rams the whole time he's like
[27:42] and all of a sudden no
[27:44] I can get into this and pretty soon he's
[27:46] out there dancing with the sisters
[27:48] praising God hallelujah thank you Jesus
[27:51] praise God oh I love how the Holy Ghost
[27:53] can transform our minds amen
[27:55] Glory
[27:58] I guess I danced all right I don't know
[28:00] I'd say the same thing
[28:02] Church there's a time to mourn and then
[28:04] a time to dance
[28:05] God is going to make our lives beautiful
[28:07] in his time
[28:10] hallelujah how many believe that by
[28:11] God's grace
[28:13] Hallelujah
[28:16] and that great question Miriam had the
[28:18] victory did you ever get that much
[28:20] victory
[28:21] now Church to get a victory you got to
[28:23] fight battles
[28:25] and you got to fight with the right
[28:26] weapons which is God's word
[28:29] God could have gave us if he would have
[28:31] gave us any other weapon that was better
[28:32] he would have gave it to us but the
[28:34] weapon is remembering God's promise
[28:37] believing God's promise and asking God
[28:39] lord Quicken your word to me let me hope
[28:42] in your word in the midst of my
[28:44] afflictions praise God ah amen now we're
[28:47] battling praise God
[28:49] praising God in the midst of our
[28:51] afflictions amen
[28:52] now
[28:54] I want to spend the majority of our time
[28:55] here Lord willing on the joy of the Lord
[28:57] in the New Testament did you ever
[28:58] anybody ever do that study just just
[29:00] study joy in the New Testament
[29:02] I don't know if I ever have by God's
[29:03] grace
[29:04] that's why I felt that the Lord to do
[29:06] that today by the grace of the Lord
[29:08] Matthew 13 20. here's the Stony seed
[29:11] right
[29:12] the Stony sea which is likened unto
[29:13] Judas someone that falls away
[29:16] he hears the word and with Anon with joy
[29:19] receives it
[29:21] so if someone who falls away could have
[29:24] joy how much more should us that
[29:26] continue in the gospel how much more joy
[29:29] should we have amen
[29:31] remember people can fall away people
[29:32] stumble
[29:33] you know they don't realize that people
[29:35] can fall away if they're not baptized
[29:37] with the Holy Ghost
[29:39] now of course people can be saved if
[29:40] they're just Justified or Sanctified
[29:42] they can be saved but the fact is you
[29:43] can fall away without the seal the
[29:45] baptism of the Holy Ghost
[29:47] right
[29:49] but Church we're not like Jesus or Judas
[29:51] rather we're not like Judas is scared
[29:53] we've sold out everything for Jesus
[29:56] and Judas sells out Jesus we're not
[29:59] trying to sell out the word we're trying
[30:01] to sell out everything to gain the word
[30:03] amen
[30:05] that's right
[30:06] Jesus said I'll blot out those who do
[30:09] not overcome
[30:11] so so that's what we need we need
[30:12] Victors today we need Warriors people
[30:15] that want to overcome people that want
[30:17] to get Victory people that want to dance
[30:18] for Jesus amen
[30:21] hallelujah what scenes of victory in our
[30:23] lives amen
[30:25] I'll tell you since I made that
[30:27] confession there and it confessed my sin
[30:29] there to brother Brooks and brother cam
[30:30] well I've had victory since then on that
[30:32] was that Thursday night service I've had
[30:34] a lot of Victory I've seen a lot of
[30:36] victory in my life since then I'm still
[30:37] riding the victory actually I'll say
[30:39] like that I'm still riding the victory
[30:41] praise God
[30:42] in church it does something to go up and
[30:44] confess sins right to others praise God
[30:47] it does something
[30:49] spend some time there worshiping and
[30:51] confessing your sins it does something
[30:53] praise God
[30:54] Hallelujah
[30:57] and notice the Kingdom of Heaven is
[30:58] likened to treasure hidden the field
[31:00] this is of course eternal life that
[31:01] which when a man hath found he hideth
[31:03] and for Joy she hides the word in his
[31:05] heart hides that treasure in his heart
[31:06] and joy therefore goes and sells all
[31:09] that he has that he might buy this field
[31:13] for Joy the joy of the Gospel the joy of
[31:17] the good news
[31:18] the joy of Promise of eternal life amen
[31:22] sells out everything in order to gain
[31:25] The Treasure of God's spirit praise God
[31:28] eternal life
[31:29] that's what I was saying the people
[31:30] haven't danced maybe they don't even
[31:32] understand salvation yet
[31:34] you've been saved you've been delivered
[31:37] you're not in the bondage of Hell
[31:39] anymore
[31:40] you're not a slave to the you're not a
[31:43] slave in the prisons of hell you're not
[31:45] a slave to the powers of Darkness you're
[31:48] a free man or woman praise God you're a
[31:50] free young person praise God you're free
[31:52] in Jesus Christ you're delivered praise
[31:54] God you're no longer under Satan's power
[31:56] now you're under the power of the Holy
[31:58] Spirit praise God
[32:00] amen
[32:01] oh thank God Amen I know what I'm
[32:03] talking about amen each one of you
[32:05] that's got that justification you know
[32:07] what you're talking about Hallelujah
[32:09] Glory
[32:12] so you know I thought it might also be
[32:13] helpful for you to see the definition of
[32:15] joy in the Greek
[32:17] well 51 time it's defined it's called
[32:19] joy and then it's three times it's
[32:20] called Glenn
[32:22] it just means gladness
[32:24] right now what's a more modern
[32:25] definition for us I'd look this up on
[32:27] the computer
[32:28] a feeling of great pleasure and
[32:30] happiness
[32:32] that's why brother man said we ought to
[32:33] be the most happy people in the world
[32:36] hallelujah what are some other words
[32:38] that we might use instead of Joy well
[32:39] brother Jesse the holy spirit makes me
[32:41] joyful well you might say the holy
[32:42] spirit gives me great pleasure it gives
[32:44] me jubilation
[32:46] like a Year of Jubilee or something
[32:47] praise God Amen I've been set free
[32:50] praise God
[32:52] I've Triumph and Jesus always causes us
[32:55] to Triumph Hallelujah
[32:57] in Christ exaltation rejoicing happiness
[32:59] gladness Glee
[33:02] I've got Glee
[33:05] I'm waiting for a testimony like that
[33:06] brother Jesse God anointed me I feel the
[33:08] Glee of the Lord
[33:11] exhilaration amen
[33:14] exuberance Elation Euphoria Bliss
[33:17] ecstasy
[33:19] transports of delight never heard that
[33:21] before Rapture Radiance enjoyment
[33:23] gratification Cloud Nine I'm on cloud
[33:26] nine in the message
[33:28] that's what this message did to me I
[33:30] remember Simon's always told that story
[33:31] Betsy Dustin when you first come in the
[33:33] message you would just sit in their car
[33:34] in the Walmart parking lot and listen to
[33:36] brother Brooks sing
[33:38] praise God now I used to sit in the cars
[33:41] and parking lot and smoke cigarettes
[33:43] when I was a sinner right but when I got
[33:45] saved then I would just sit there and
[33:47] praise God and listen to sermons see
[33:49] what does it bring it brings a real Joy
[33:51] it puts you on cloud nine amen it takes
[33:54] you out of misery it takes away all your
[33:57] despair it gives you hope it gives you
[33:59] eternal life amen ah
[34:02] [Applause]
[34:04] I'm ravish with his love oh Hallelujah
[34:08] my goodness
[34:11] I enjoy the presence of God how many Joy
[34:13] the presence of God
[34:15] Glory
[34:18] parable of the talents well done thou
[34:20] good and faithful servant thou has been
[34:21] Faithful over a few things I'll make the
[34:23] rule over many things enter thou into
[34:25] the joy this is how Heaven is described
[34:28] you mean you can have a taste of Heaven
[34:30] now exactly praise God you're a partaker
[34:33] of the divine nature amen that's what
[34:36] Peter said we are partakers of Heaven
[34:39] now praise God
[34:40] we know it's in part we know it's in
[34:42] measure but nevertheless when we
[34:44] transform over to new body and get a
[34:46] body change the best way God describes
[34:49] it is now you're living in the joys of
[34:51] the Lord
[34:52] amen
[34:54] thank God Amen
[34:56] brother brother says Sublime Time
[34:58] Sublime is that what he said
[35:01] there's no other way to describe it
[35:03] Joy
[35:05] happiness
[35:08] now look at the combination of feelings
[35:09] these women see Jesus raised on on the
[35:13] greatest day in the history of the world
[35:14] and the angel said go quickly tell his
[35:17] disciples he's risen from the dead and
[35:18] behold he goeth before you nigali there
[35:20] you shall see him lo I told you they
[35:22] departed quickly from the septica with
[35:23] fear
[35:25] and great joy
[35:27] teacher sometimes we got a combination
[35:29] of all these feelings
[35:31] now fear would have been like that death
[35:33] death afraid because the angel
[35:35] right the women saw him it would have
[35:37] been like deathly afraid but then
[35:38] they're leaving like deathly afraid like
[35:39] Hallelujah he's alive Hallelujah he's
[35:42] alive and then they're running down the
[35:43] station they're running to tell the
[35:45] brothers let's go he's alive amen
[35:48] so sometimes church we have multiple
[35:50] experiences multiple feelings at the
[35:53] same exact time
[35:55] praise God
[35:58] and so what I mean by that as I don't
[36:00] know what Satan to beat you up if you're
[36:02] feeling joyful yet troubled
[36:05] don't let Satan beat you up
[36:07] we're going to get to that Paul did that
[36:09] every day
[36:11] every day Paul was joyful but then sad
[36:14] other parts of the day
[36:17] it's just part of being a Christian
[36:19] don't get don't don't get defeated
[36:21] because you can't keep maybe the joy all
[36:23] day well there's some days you'll have
[36:24] more joy than others
[36:27] but you know the best part is you know
[36:28] you got access to Joy any day you need
[36:30] it that's the best part
[36:33] you're never going to lose it praise God
[36:36] like you might lose it up here but
[36:38] you're going to get it back because it's
[36:39] already in your soul praise God
[36:41] I never lost it really it's still a part
[36:43] of me praise God
[36:45] ah
[36:49] in memory Church even when people hate
[36:51] you
[36:52] and won't fellowship with you and say
[36:54] bad things about you call you evil call
[36:56] you a devil that's still an opportunity
[36:58] to rejoice
[37:01] we don't got an excuse to crawl into the
[37:03] corner and say oh they don't love me
[37:04] anymore nobody cares about me and
[37:08] they said bad things about me
[37:11] Jesus said do exactly the opposite
[37:15] and again he said leave for Joy amen
[37:18] leave for Joy when they hate you and
[37:21] won't fellowship with you Jesus said
[37:22] that's the time to praise God Amen
[37:26] God hallelujah amen amen oh it's so
[37:29] contrary to what the world tells us so
[37:31] contrary to what our own feelings tell
[37:33] us we got to get rid of our own feelings
[37:35] and get to my new Christ amen go back to
[37:38] that mind of Christ right go back to the
[37:40] spirit of Christ in our souls
[37:42] and Jesus says at that time you have a
[37:44] great reward
[37:47] because every the Bible said any all who
[37:49] live Godly in Christ Jesus shall suffer
[37:51] some persecution
[37:53] some level of persecution
[37:56] this should produce Joy
[37:59] when people say bad things about us we
[38:01] ought to say praise God
[38:03] Hallelujah God is with me and then the
[38:06] Bible said pray for them who
[38:08] despitefully use you
[38:10] right pray for them that's the
[38:12] opportunity to intercede for the
[38:14] unlovable
[38:16] right
[38:17] that's that I was going to say like this
[38:19] that's your opportunity to be like Moses
[38:21] who stood in the gap for Israel
[38:23] now what would you have said if God
[38:24] would have said you know what brother
[38:25] amen I'm going to destroy all the
[38:27] message I'm gonna start a new message
[38:28] and I'm just going to start with you
[38:30] now how many of us would have said okay
[38:32] that sounds good
[38:34] I think I'm a pretty good person I think
[38:36] I could handle that
[38:37] I could be just like Abraham father the
[38:39] faith
[38:40] but Moses said no block me out
[38:44] he said take me think about that same
[38:47] thing Paul said I wish I was a curse for
[38:49] my Brethren's sake
[38:51] that so let's remember that's the real
[38:53] kind of Jesus is Love right there
[38:56] when people mistreat you and do bad
[38:58] things you God allowed it and so God
[39:00] wants you to God wants you to act like
[39:02] Moses amen
[39:04] God wants you to act like Stephen father
[39:06] lay this not to their charge God wants
[39:08] you to act like him Jesus amen father
[39:10] forgive them they don't know what
[39:12] they're doing that's your chance to
[39:14] glorify Christ amen
[39:16] your chance to be like Christ
[39:19] I think at the leap too just make sure
[39:21] if you're older you stretch out before
[39:22] you leave
[39:23] I had to learn that the hard way
[39:26] and 70 returned again with Joy saying
[39:28] the law even the devils are subject unto
[39:30] us through thy name we know this story
[39:31] right
[39:32] now look at that nothing by well any
[39:34] means hurt you now this doesn't apply to
[39:36] everybody this applied to those uh this
[39:38] applies to those apostles
[39:41] right we've had a preacher come in here
[39:43] years ago and he said uh he quoted Luke
[39:46] 10 where Jesus told the disciples uh
[39:48] you'll raise the Dead all these things
[39:49] and say look you can do that well
[39:51] if you're called you can do that
[39:53] that was actually spoken to the apostles
[39:56] and then First Corinthians 12 said to
[39:58] are all workers of Miracles
[40:01] did anybody catch that I'm sure you did
[40:02] I probably preached on a few times
[40:04] so that that's just like not rightly
[40:06] dividing the word of God and it puts
[40:08] pressure on you like if you don't have
[40:09] Miracles something's wrong with you well
[40:11] listen I got the miracle of Salvation
[40:12] that's the most important miracle I need
[40:14] praise God I do believe in miracles but
[40:17] God has to do it praise God
[40:20] if you're so full of Miracles why don't
[40:21] you do all the Miracles we need in our
[40:23] church you know
[40:24] if you're the if you're the person of
[40:26] Miracles you're the master of Miracles
[40:28] we'll do all the Miracles then
[40:31] well see they don't want to do that
[40:33] well it's your faith no it's your faith
[40:36] but my face not the problem your false
[40:39] teaching is the problem
[40:40] now I'm not I'm not saying anything bad
[40:42] about any preachers I'm just saying
[40:43] we've got to rightly divide the word of
[40:45] God hallelujah and then Jesus says don't
[40:47] rejoice when you cast out a devil he
[40:50] said Rejoice because your name's
[40:52] recorded on the last book of life in
[40:54] heaven amen
[40:56] Hallelujah
[40:57] Rejoice that heaven knows your name
[41:00] praise God
[41:01] oh thank God Amen Just Like Heaven new
[41:04] cornelius's prayers having new Cornelius
[41:07] is fasting Heaven new cornelius's
[41:10] almsgiving church when you do the same
[41:12] thing Heaven remembers you Hallelujah
[41:15] amen
[41:18] Rejoice because your names are written
[41:20] in heaven
[41:25] the parable the woman finding the piece
[41:27] of silver
[41:29] she sweeps the house she seeks
[41:31] diligently till she finds it then she
[41:33] calls all her friends rejoiced with me I
[41:35] found it and this is liking enough a
[41:37] person being saved likewise I say unto
[41:39] you there's joy in the presence of the
[41:41] angels of God over one sinner that
[41:43] repents
[41:45] so when someone gets saved there ought
[41:47] to be Joy with that person
[41:49] if you're really saved you ought to have
[41:51] some Joy
[41:52] yeah don't worry praise God
[41:55] and then not only that but Heaven starts
[41:58] having a jubilee
[42:00] I wonder if angels dance I don't know I
[42:02] just wanna we know God dances God said
[42:04] so amen
[42:06] Jesus dance before the foundation of the
[42:08] world Hallelujah
[42:10] thank God
[42:12] we ought to Rejoice on on Earth and we
[42:15] know Heaven rejoices as well
[42:17] when someone really gets saved
[42:19] Hallelujah
[42:22] remember Jesus went to Zacchaeus
[42:25] and Jesus said I'm going to come and I'm
[42:26] going to buy it at your house today
[42:28] and the Bible said he received him
[42:30] joyfully
[42:32] so we ought to have joy knowing Jesus is
[42:34] coming home with us today
[42:36] Hallelujah
[42:38] Church please don't leave Jesus here
[42:40] don't leave all your Praises here
[42:43] they'll probably be gone when you get
[42:45] back if you do that
[42:47] some somehow some way there they'll find
[42:49] their way out you know
[42:51] or they'll annoy somebody else
[42:54] don't leave it here praise God we've got
[42:55] to take Jesus home with us amen
[42:58] we got to take the Praises home like I
[43:00] love driving home from church sometimes
[43:01] I'll be raising my hands or even driving
[43:03] to church this morning raising my hands
[43:04] shot in a point sometimes people drive
[43:06] by like what is it
[43:09] I'm like hey
[43:11] there's joy in the house of the Lord
[43:13] amen
[43:15] now you just don't know what I know
[43:16] praise God you know you just haven't
[43:17] been saved like I've been saved
[43:20] sometimes I'm pounding on the steering
[43:22] wheel you know
[43:25] see we receive him joyfully he's coming
[43:27] home with me Hallelujah
[43:32] now this is the scripture voice of God
[43:33] needs and I just started a series on
[43:35] them YouTube videos to try to help the
[43:37] people and help them too I try to do it
[43:38] with kindness part two will come out
[43:40] today about two o'clock I scheduled it
[43:43] this is the scripture they need John the
[43:45] Baptist Was Elijah and he said he that
[43:47] the bride is the bridegroom
[43:49] but the friend of the bridegroom Elijah
[43:52] John the Baptist which standeth and
[43:53] hearth and rejoice greatly because of
[43:55] The bridegroom's Voice
[43:57] this my joy therefore is fulfilled
[44:01] he must increase but I must decrease now
[44:03] we see voice of God going the opposite
[44:05] way they want brother Branham to
[44:06] increase
[44:08] right but a real man of God said I must
[44:11] decrease and Jesus must increase
[44:15] so see church we listen to sermons thank
[44:17] God for William sermons I was listening
[44:18] to what when I was listening yesterday
[44:19] oh Souls that are in prison now I
[44:22] started it good start I'll keep going on
[44:23] that one
[44:24] we listen to it it's wonderful
[44:27] but we can't Rejoice necessarily in a
[44:29] man we thank God for his ministry we got
[44:31] to hear the voice of Jesus Christ amen
[44:34] because that's where the real man of God
[44:36] does a real preacher of God a real
[44:38] Prophet a real Elijah will rejoice in
[44:41] the voice of Christ because he's the
[44:43] bridegroom amen
[44:45] thank God Hallelujah
[44:48] he rejoices more in Jesus voice than his
[44:50] own voice and that's what brother man
[44:52] said all the time he said forget in the
[44:55] seventh year he said forget anything
[44:56] about me he said put all this grace on
[44:58] Jesus Christ
[45:00] I'm a sinner Say by Grace that's what we
[45:02] should say too put any Grace in my life
[45:04] put it on Jesus Hallelujah
[45:08] as a father has loved me so I've loved
[45:10] you continue my love if if you keep my
[45:12] Commandments he shall abide in my love
[45:14] even as I kept my father's Commandments
[45:15] and abide in his love these things have
[45:17] I spoken to you that your that my joy
[45:20] might remain in you and that your joy
[45:22] might be full
[45:24] this is my commandment that you love one
[45:26] another as I have loved you so we see a
[45:30] little formula here loving Jesus and
[45:32] obeying produces Joy
[45:36] so again it goes back to that thought
[45:37] when we sin it takes away the joy when
[45:40] we sin it takes away the dance so we've
[45:42] got to stop sinning we got to start
[45:43] obeying and get the joy back praise God
[45:45] God don't want you halfway on Joy he
[45:48] wants your cup overflowing amen
[45:51] hallelujah praise God
[45:54] they're not saying to you that ye shall
[45:56] weep and lament but the world shall
[45:57] rejoice and ye shall be sorrowful but
[45:59] your sorrow shall be turned into Joy
[46:02] speaking of the Resurrection
[46:04] go to verse 22 and ye that now therefore
[46:06] have sorrow but I will see you again and
[46:09] your heart shall rejoice and your joy no
[46:12] man taketh from you
[46:16] your boss cannot take your joy
[46:19] let me say like this Satan cannot take
[46:22] your joy ah
[46:25] I guess song says the world didn't give
[46:28] it to me so the world can't take it away
[46:31] that's what Jesus said that's that's the
[46:32] inspiration for that song nobody can
[46:35] take away my joy I'm keeping my joy
[46:38] because Jesus gave it to me praise God
[46:41] oh it's glorious
[46:44] full Joy he promised you
[46:46] and no man could take it from us
[46:48] if the pastor discouraged you doesn't
[46:51] take your joy away
[46:53] if your husband discards you doesn't
[46:55] take your joy away
[46:57] if your wife discourages you doesn't
[46:59] take your joy away praise God
[47:01] the church said
[47:03] the children do something act up on you
[47:05] doesn't take your joy away
[47:07] now you make you pray more right you'll
[47:10] have you know you'll feel burdened in
[47:12] the moment right like we all do yeah
[47:14] but like I said there's always these
[47:16] combinations of feelings
[47:18] and no man can take away the joy
[47:21] Hallelujah
[47:23] in other words Jesus says I'm hedging
[47:24] this and I'm protecting this just like
[47:26] he said hurt not the oil and the wine
[47:28] Hallelujah ah nobody can touch this oil
[47:32] why this is the joy Hallelujah
[47:38] that's good I'm gonna preach my voice
[47:39] out again
[47:40] the brother just emailed me from
[47:42] Washington he's like hey you got your
[47:43] voice back from the point I'm like yeah
[47:45] I come in here I'm like no I'm going to
[47:47] lose it again here
[47:48] John 16 23 and that day you shall ask me
[47:51] nothing barely available to you whatever
[47:52] you asking my father my name he'll give
[47:55] it to you
[47:56] but remember you might have to say
[47:57] remember Lord
[47:59] remember on the verse you caused me to
[48:01] Hope in
[48:03] that we can all we can all make it
[48:05] through one service I believe God I
[48:07] believe God I believe God let's come
[48:08] back to the next service with the same
[48:09] attitude
[48:11] church I'm the one that needs help too
[48:13] we all need help
[48:15] this is my comfort the word of God
[48:17] comforts me in my affliction
[48:19] I have hope that God will keep his
[48:21] promise
[48:23] he said ye shall receive that your joy
[48:26] might be full
[48:30] so we're supposed to have joy before
[48:33] we ask the promise
[48:35] we're supposed to have joy while we're
[48:36] waiting on the promise
[48:38] and then we have a lot of Joy when it
[48:40] happens amen Lord thank God Amen
[48:44] see
[48:45] you'll receive it that your joy might be
[48:48] full praise God
[48:51] Hallelujah
[48:55] what a beautiful promise
[48:57] so yes God wants you to have joy at the
[49:00] end once you receive the inheritance
[49:02] once you receive the promise God wants
[49:04] you to show your joy praise God
[49:07] oh hallelujah amen is that Zion all
[49:11] right
[49:15] John 17. Jesus last prayer with us with
[49:18] his disciples before he was crucified
[49:19] and now I am no more in the world but
[49:21] these are in the world and I come to
[49:23] thee Holy Father now it's not the pope
[49:25] either he wasn't praying to the Pope
[49:26] keep through thy know name Those whom
[49:28] now has given me that they may be one as
[49:30] we are while I was with him in the world
[49:33] I kept them in thy name it's the
[49:35] authority I kept the name is Authority
[49:36] reputation
[49:38] that those that thou gave us me I've
[49:40] kept and none of them is lost but the
[49:42] Son of Perdition that the scripture
[49:44] might be fulfilled and now I come to
[49:46] thee that and these things I speak in
[49:48] the world that they might have my joy
[49:51] fulfilled in themselves amen so really
[49:54] when you're joyful it's the joy of Jesus
[49:57] Amen
[49:59] I've got the Peace of Jesus I got the
[50:01] love of Jesus I got the power of Jesus
[50:03] and I got the joy of Jesus Amen
[50:06] it's his Joy
[50:09] and God wants to fulfill it in our lives
[50:11] now let me just say like this as long as
[50:12] we keep surrendering and repenting to
[50:14] God and loving Jesus he will fulfill
[50:16] everything for our lives
[50:19] every promise every every every uh the
[50:22] Bible said workmanship every work he's
[50:24] given you to do God will fulfill in your
[50:26] life
[50:28] it's only when we continually disobey
[50:30] that we'll miss out on what God's called
[50:32] us to like Saul King Saul
[50:35] like Samuel said you know you could have
[50:36] had this you would have had this Kingdom
[50:38] forever but you disobeyed God I think it
[50:40] was what two or three times in a row
[50:42] now I'm not making a Doctrine on that
[50:43] you know we we all fall short of God's
[50:45] glory
[50:46] but he was the king he should have
[50:47] obeyed he had a prophet he had thus
[50:48] saith the Lord he should have obeyed
[50:52] so the point is God will finish in his
[50:55] life I'm sorry in your life what he
[50:58] started
[50:59] and then when you see the Fulfillment
[51:00] you'll dance for joy
[51:03] I'm glad to see that a few weeks ago he
[51:05] saw them dancing for joy I saw Ally
[51:06] dancing for joy there praise God
[51:08] hallelujah Garrison Haven and in case
[51:11] you're dancing for joy Hallelujah he saw
[51:13] us I am a dancing for joy amen
[51:15] the Fulfillment of God's promise
[51:17] Hallelujah
[51:19] that's right
[51:20] Glory Acts 8.
[51:24] again church now here this also produces
[51:26] Joy
[51:28] when devils are cast out unclean spirits
[51:30] are cast out and people are healed and
[51:32] Supernatural Miracles take place that
[51:35] produces great joy
[51:37] right for those got to be those got to
[51:40] be ordained by God and some of them we
[51:42] got to pray and fast for
[51:44] like we were texting on the other day
[51:45] right gotta praying fast
[51:48] this causes great joy right but remember
[51:51] again people are going to get sick again
[51:53] after they get healed right
[51:55] they're going to praise pray through
[51:56] that battle pray through that battle
[51:58] but God does give us these Seasons we're
[52:00] Supernatural is to produce great joy of
[52:03] the Lord
[52:05] next time God knows a miracle somebody
[52:06] remind that person you need to have a
[52:08] dance session here now and praise the
[52:10] Lord you need to this is your season of
[52:12] Victory Hallelujah
[52:15] because guess what another season of
[52:17] trial is going to come around probably
[52:18] pretty soon
[52:19] you better dance while you got the
[52:21] chance
[52:21] a good rhyme right there
[52:23] you better dance well you got the chance
[52:25] Saints
[52:27] that's a good one Hallelujah
[52:30] acts 20. Now Behold Paul said I go bound
[52:33] the spirit under Jerusalem not knowing
[52:34] the things that will follow me there say
[52:36] that the Holy Ghost witnesseth in every
[52:38] city
[52:39] the bonds and afflictions boy he sure
[52:40] did get in jail not a lot
[52:43] now look none of these things move me
[52:45] neither count I my life dear unto myself
[52:47] so that I might finish my course with
[52:50] joy
[52:51] look at that
[52:53] Paul was joyful by not counting his
[52:56] Earthly life dear to himself
[53:00] now look Church most people get sad when
[53:02] they think about the end of their life
[53:04] Paul didn't think that way
[53:07] Paul said I don't count my number of
[53:09] days I don't count my number of years as
[53:11] this is so precious like the world like
[53:13] they'll do anything just let me live a
[53:15] little longer let me live a little
[53:16] longer Paul wasn't that way
[53:18] because Paul said I got a real life that
[53:19] starts when I pass over oh man amen
[53:22] that's what my real life actually starts
[53:24] amen
[53:25] Hallelujah he said what's more needful
[53:27] that I stay here with you so I can be a
[53:30] blessing to you praise God
[53:32] I just want you to see this
[53:34] if God should take somebody early like
[53:36] you know Hua and and bang and zur's Dad
[53:38] if God takes how old was he how old was
[53:40] your dad
[53:42] 64 that's pretty young right
[53:45] it's pretty young
[53:47] we all wish we could be like what 80
[53:49] maybe I don't know I don't know how old
[53:50] you want to be
[53:51] you're gonna have pains either way you
[53:53] know
[53:55] but the fact is you know Paul did not
[53:58] count his life dear unto himself
[54:02] see because he wanted to finish he just
[54:04] wanted to finish his life with the joy
[54:06] of the Lord
[54:07] remember everyone makes that statement
[54:09] he said don't he said don't let the
[54:10] devil Crown your life as a cranky old
[54:12] person
[54:14] remember
[54:17] don't don't let Satan Crown your life
[54:19] with a crown of defeat and
[54:20] discouragement
[54:22] where you're just sour all the time
[54:26] is sour
[54:27] okay so it's a sour space I can make
[54:31] if I could do worse than that but
[54:33] instead let the crown I believe the
[54:35] Bible says the crown is God's loving
[54:36] kindness and I'm not mistaken Crowley
[54:38] with loving kindness let me look it up
[54:40] who's got a concordance here real quick
[54:41] look at that I believe the Bible said
[54:42] Cry Me Lord with loving kindness
[54:50] loving
[54:52] that is right hallelujah amen thank you
[54:54] Jesus Hallelujah uh Psalm 103 verse 4.
[54:58] oh yeah it's right at this who forgiveth
[55:00] all thy iniquities who healed all thy
[55:01] diseases who redeems our life from
[55:03] destruction who crowded thee with loving
[55:06] kindness and Tender Mercies amen
[55:09] Glory praise God
[55:11] don't let me be crying with sourness and
[55:13] and sinful complaining
[55:15] gotta balance that out
[55:18] don't let me be crying with that but let
[55:20] me be a crowned with Jesus put his Mercy
[55:22] on my head praise God
[55:25] Jesus put his loving kindness upon my
[55:28] head and that's what I'm crying with
[55:30] Jesus has had loving mercy on me
[55:33] I walk around and people see he's crying
[55:35] with God's mercy
[55:38] God in other words God's remorseful to
[55:40] Pastor Jesse
[55:42] right
[55:44] God has been merciful to each and every
[55:45] one of us
[55:47] be crying with that let God cry on your
[55:49] life with that
[55:50] Paul said I'm not going to be crying
[55:51] with well I didn't get to live long
[55:53] enough
[55:54] I didn't get to live up to my uh three
[55:56] score and ten
[55:58] he died at I think 65 or 64 if I'm not
[56:00] mistaken 63. somewhere in there just
[56:03] like just like your dad
[56:05] he said I'm not counting this dear to
[56:06] myself
[56:08] I want to finish my course as a joyful
[56:10] Christian
[56:15] God commended his love toward us and
[56:17] that while we were yet sinners Christ
[56:18] died for us much more than
[56:20] I haven't been preached an hour yet
[56:22] being now justified by his blood we
[56:23] shall be saved from wrath through him
[56:25] for if when we were enemies we were
[56:27] reconciled to God by the death of his
[56:28] son much more being reconciled shall we
[56:30] be saved by his life
[56:32] and not only so but we also joy in God
[56:36] through our Lord Jesus Christ by whom we
[56:39] now have received the atonement The
[56:42] Exchange
[56:44] so one reason of your joy is the
[56:47] exchange God did between you and Christ
[56:52] amen like that song says I'm Trading My
[56:56] Sorrows I'm trading my shame it's an
[57:00] exchange I'm laying it down for the joy
[57:03] of the Lord amen now we got a good song
[57:05] after service amen
[57:06] of course it's got a tough bridge on it
[57:14] God he loved me before I loved him he
[57:16] loved me while I was a sinner but then
[57:18] he gave me Redemption he gave me
[57:20] reconciliation he gave me favor back and
[57:23] he took my sin
[57:25] I want to make somebody joyful in here
[57:28] me Hallelujah You All God's Children
[57:32] praise God
[57:33] oh thank the Lord

[59:22] the Bible said the kingdom of God is
[59:23] righteousness joy and peace in the Holy
[59:26] Ghost
[59:27] that all comes with it praise God
[59:29] right that all comes with it

[59:56] right and we can trust God with our
[59:58] lives

[1:02:14] come over I call God for a record upon
[1:02:16] my soul that to spare you I came not as
[1:02:18] yet to Corinth not for that we have
[1:02:20] dominion over your faith but we are
[1:02:22] helpers of your joy for by faith you
[1:02:24] stand now look Paul says Paul says I
[1:02:27] don't determine your level of Faith the
[1:02:28] preacher doesn't determine your level of
[1:02:30] Faith oh boy that's good I like that
[1:02:31] that's pretty good the preacher can't
[1:02:33] take away your faith if you don't let
[1:02:35] him like let's say the preacher's off
[1:02:37] the word or something
[1:02:39] but what preachers are supposed to do
[1:02:41] and like and all the all the Christians
[1:02:43] we're supposed to help you be more
[1:02:45] joyful
[1:02:49] so no church that's not always an easy
[1:02:51] thing
[1:02:52] we suffer we go through trials so we
[1:02:54] really need God's grace to bring joy to
[1:02:55] one another
[1:02:57] and maybe it's like we said just a smile
[1:02:59] and a handshake or I'm praying for you
[1:03:00] or can I pray for you right now there's
[1:03:02] an hour
[1:03:05] but this is what this is what I want to
[1:03:07] be I want to be a helper of your joy
[1:03:10] how can I help you be more joyful well I
[1:03:12] can preach on Dancing that's one thing I
[1:03:13] can do
[1:03:15] did I help anybody join with that one
[1:03:17] okay I got a few amens amen sorry I
[1:03:20] thought I'd helped somebody
[1:03:21] I knew God wanted me to preach that I
[1:03:22] knew that that was a revelation to me I
[1:03:25] knew I knew we were supposed to have
[1:03:26] those services that was Revelation to me
[1:03:28] too
[1:03:28] I failed it by God's grace
[1:03:32] and so see the preacher can't
[1:03:35] you can't take away your faith
[1:03:37] the preacher wants to help your faith
[1:03:40] I want to help your joy today
[1:03:43] and you know the best way I can help
[1:03:44] your joy is by saying Look what Jesus
[1:03:46] said oops Look what Jesus said Look what
[1:03:48] Jesus said
[1:03:50] look what the Bible says
[1:03:53] look at the Bible says remember the word
[1:03:56] the word's going to Quicken you that's
[1:03:57] going to bring you Joy praise God
[1:04:00] great is my boldness of speech toward
[1:04:02] you great is my glory of you I'm filled
[1:04:04] with Comfort I am exceedingly joyful in
[1:04:06] all
[1:04:07] our
[1:04:09] tribulation
[1:04:11] The church here is a real Paradox of joy
[1:04:15] the whole subject is Joy especially when
[1:04:17] you look at Paul's writing the whole
[1:04:19] Paradox is you're supposed to be Joy
[1:04:21] when joyful when everything looks awful
[1:04:26] and if we're all honest with ourselves
[1:04:28] and if we're all honest with the Holy
[1:04:30] Ghost we all got to admit we struggle
[1:04:32] with that sometimes
[1:04:34] when things aren't going my way when I'm
[1:04:36] in the seasons of loss when I'm a season
[1:04:38] of Bad Health when I'm a season of
[1:04:40] persecution it's hard to be joyful but
[1:04:43] Paul was constantly helping their Joy
[1:04:45] amen he was constantly asking God to
[1:04:47] help him
[1:04:49] help others be joyful in the midst of
[1:04:52] their tribulations because don't you
[1:04:53] know Church even when we suffer even
[1:04:55] when we go through hard times Jesus is
[1:04:58] still on the throne praise God
[1:05:01] he's still seated with all Heaven and
[1:05:03] Earth under his Dominion praise God
[1:05:06] and he can speak one word and all your
[1:05:09] struggles will be taken away praise God
[1:05:10] or he could wait 10 years
[1:05:12] foreign
[1:05:14] I got one right
[1:05:15] that's our dog around it's hard thing to
[1:05:17] amen or he can make you wait 25 years
[1:05:19] like Abraham
[1:05:22] but either way he's still on the throne
[1:05:29] so you learn to be joyful in Tribulation
[1:05:35] okay this is Paul you know talking about
[1:05:36] how you rebuked that brother in the
[1:05:38] First Corinthians
[1:05:42] now therefore we were comforted in your
[1:05:44] comfort yea and exceedingly the more
[1:05:45] joyful we joined for the joy of Titus
[1:05:48] because his Spirit was refreshed by you
[1:05:50] all
[1:05:52] so Paul is joyful that Titus was joyful
[1:05:56] through the fellowship
[1:06:00] so Church let's let's try to let's try
[1:06:02] to think of this when we see somebody
[1:06:04] else joyful no matter what we're going
[1:06:05] through we should try to join be joyful
[1:06:08] for them
[1:06:09] I'm glad brother Austin's got the
[1:06:10] victory or I'm glad sicilina's got the
[1:06:12] victory I'm glad bro Jesse finally got
[1:06:14] the victory
[1:06:16] that's what Paul says I'm joyful for
[1:06:19] Titus because Titus is joyful
[1:06:22] amen praise God
[1:06:24] bye
[1:06:27] and again these are all within their
[1:06:29] tribulations
[1:06:31] now I better I'm gonna have to I'm going
[1:06:33] to move on I don't think I can get to
[1:06:34] all these I kind of want to finish with
[1:06:35] this other thought here
[1:06:38] let me see where am I at
[1:06:41] okay go one two three four five six
[1:06:43] seven eight nine ten eleven twelve
[1:06:45] thirteen fourteen fifteen
[1:06:48] eight I got 18 more scriptures
[1:06:50] I'm not sure I'm gonna get to that
[1:06:53] um I might finish that on Wednesday
[1:06:54] we'll see here
[1:06:57] ah
[1:06:59] I'm gonna skip that here uh let me try
[1:07:01] to bring this down to close here let me
[1:07:04] so let me do 15 minutes here
[1:07:07] I try to do an hour and a half so
[1:07:11] I mentioned this earlier
[1:07:13] as Christians you know we're familiar as
[1:07:15] what Paul said we just read all those
[1:07:16] scriptures like I said there's 18 more
[1:07:17] scriptures where Paul says joyful in the
[1:07:19] midst of Trials joyful in the midst of
[1:07:21] your your tribulations
[1:07:23] joy joy joy
[1:07:26] don't let Satan take your joy let no man
[1:07:28] let no woman take your joy praise God
[1:07:31] don't anybody take your joy your
[1:07:32] gladness and what Christ has done for
[1:07:34] you
[1:07:36] and then the reality is we've got to
[1:07:37] balance all these feelings
[1:07:40] we have to balance all these experiences
[1:07:43] right let me prove it to you
[1:07:45] it seems Paul rotated between all these
[1:07:48] emotions in and out all throughout the
[1:07:51] day
[1:07:52] somebody ought to say Amen on that
[1:07:54] if if you've experienced it you can't
[1:07:57] amend something you don't know
[1:07:59] right but I can say Amen to that
[1:08:03] like I'll get a tax or email oh this is
[1:08:05] bad news oh God can you bro Jesse can
[1:08:07] you pray yes I'll pray and all of a
[1:08:08] sudden a few minutes later I get some
[1:08:09] good news ah Hallelujah sad morning Joy
[1:08:14] rejoicing
[1:08:16] and the cycle repeats over and over
[1:08:17] again
[1:08:19] right
[1:08:23] so let me go to this one first Paul said
[1:08:25] rejoice in the Lord just on Sundays and
[1:08:27] Wednesdays
[1:08:31] rejoice in the Lord alway and again I
[1:08:32] say
[1:08:34] let me repeat that in case somebody
[1:08:35] missed it he says
[1:08:37] if you missed it the first time you're
[1:08:38] gonna get the second time
[1:08:40] Rejoice always rejoice
[1:08:44] be careful don't don't be anxious about
[1:08:45] anything don't don't let stress
[1:08:46] overwhelm you
[1:08:48] but cast all your cares make your
[1:08:50] requests and run to God
[1:08:52] what's Rejoice mean again to be glad
[1:08:54] that's the same thing as Joy right Joy
[1:08:55] means glad you see they're kind of
[1:08:57] synonyms here
[1:08:58] and Paul wrote this Paul writes
[1:09:02] to be joyful always while he's in prison
[1:09:06] he's in bonds he's he's under bondage he
[1:09:10] has no Freedom a man that has no Freedom
[1:09:13] still says I'm free to be joyful praise
[1:09:15] God oh think about that the Paradox amen
[1:09:19] of the Christian Life
[1:09:21] I have no Freedom all my rights have
[1:09:24] been stripped from me but I still got my
[1:09:25] spiritual Bill of Rights amen
[1:09:28] I've still got my spiritual Declaration
[1:09:30] of Independence amen
[1:09:32] I've still got the rights that Jesus
[1:09:34] gave me I can still rejoice in the midst
[1:09:36] of my trials
[1:09:38] that's that's all we're all we all need
[1:09:41] to come up to that church
[1:09:42] I need it we all we all got to be able
[1:09:44] to come up and say I'm going to be
[1:09:45] joyful in the midst of my trials
[1:09:48] now he says Rejoice always but then he
[1:09:50] says beside those things that are
[1:09:52] without all the trials he had outside of
[1:09:53] him I preached on this recently maybe
[1:09:55] last year
[1:09:56] it was last year
[1:09:58] beside all these troubles without
[1:10:01] there's also the troubles that come upon
[1:10:03] me every day the care of all the
[1:10:05] churches
[1:10:06] so each day he gets you get Brothers
[1:10:08] coming in Hey Brother so-and-so
[1:10:11] Hallelujah God bless you brother
[1:10:14] how is the church in Rome doing how's
[1:10:16] the church the thessalonica doing and
[1:10:18] that every day you get visitors come
[1:10:19] back and say Well they're really they're
[1:10:20] really struggling here
[1:10:22] they're poor here
[1:10:24] they're going through persecution here
[1:10:25] some of them are died and martyred
[1:10:27] every day he's got the care of all these
[1:10:29] churches on
[1:10:31] every day we got the same man writes
[1:10:33] Rejoice always
[1:10:36] it's kind of like well brother Paul
[1:10:37] which one do you want me to do you want
[1:10:38] me to Rejoice or do you want me to you
[1:10:40] you want him to pray yeah be burden
[1:10:42] which one should I do
[1:10:44] but the route of is we have to do all of
[1:10:46] it
[1:10:47] we have to follow because like this the
[1:10:50] leadership of the Holy Ghost
[1:10:52] for that hour he's leading you to
[1:10:54] intercede the next hour he might be
[1:10:57] leading you to dance
[1:11:00] Oh you mean message people still dance
[1:11:01] well yeah the real message Believers
[1:11:02] still do the real message right
[1:11:07] Hallelujah and then on top of that then
[1:11:09] he says
[1:11:11] I Die daily
[1:11:14] officers Rejoice always
[1:11:17] Die daily and also deal with all the
[1:11:20] burdens of all the churches
[1:11:22] on the same day Emma all day
[1:11:25] every day
[1:11:27] every day
[1:11:29] every day
[1:11:33] the Christian Life Is A Wonderful Life
[1:11:38] but it's a life of concept battle
[1:11:40] constant overcoming
[1:11:42] constant renewal
[1:11:45] I think it's so refreshing to look at if
[1:11:48] anybody knew what it's like to suffer
[1:11:49] outside of Jesus
[1:11:51] it was Saint Paul
[1:11:52] and yet he's the one that tells us
[1:11:55] Joyce always brother awesome
[1:11:58] for the amen Rejoice always
[1:12:00] and again I see
[1:12:05] but don't forget all the needs of the
[1:12:06] churches
[1:12:09] remember the last thing Paul said to
[1:12:11] Peter before they left Jerusalem he said
[1:12:12] don't forget to remember the poor
[1:12:16] okay now I gotta remember the poor
[1:12:18] churches
[1:12:20] that's a big to-do list anybody ever
[1:12:22] write out your real to-do list for each
[1:12:23] day
[1:12:24] one time I saw my brother policy he was
[1:12:26] I said send me a picture of your
[1:12:27] toothless it was like three pages long
[1:12:29] I'm like bro I'm glad I'm not you
[1:12:32] I'll text him that too
[1:12:37] that's a lot of that's a lot of work
[1:12:39] there to do man my goodness
[1:12:43] but each man is called each each
[1:12:45] person's you know office
[1:12:48] remember this scripture
[1:12:50] Jesus has shined in our hearts
[1:12:53] we have the light of the knowledge of
[1:12:55] the glory of God in the face of Jesus
[1:12:57] Christ we have treasure on Earth and
[1:12:59] vessels who's got treasure this morning
[1:13:01] you've got the power of God in you and
[1:13:05] yet you're troubled on every side
[1:13:08] this is Paul talking
[1:13:09] same guy that said Rejoice always
[1:13:12] I can Rejoice all the time and I've got
[1:13:14] trouble all around me
[1:13:16] that's what he's saying
[1:13:18] I got trouble at home I got trouble at
[1:13:21] church I got trouble on the job I got
[1:13:23] trouble at the school
[1:13:25] I got trouble all around me yet I'll
[1:13:27] Rejoice always
[1:13:29] and again I'll say rejoice
[1:13:34] word distressed
[1:13:36] we're troubled yet not I'm sorry we're
[1:13:38] troubled not distressed not we're
[1:13:41] perplexed but not in despair I'm not
[1:13:44] hopeless like I'm going to commit
[1:13:45] suicide right
[1:13:46] got some of us battle that
[1:13:48] some people do but the Bible says we
[1:13:51] could have victory over that
[1:13:53] because we can have joy of the Lord
[1:13:55] what's the Hope again the hope is God's
[1:13:57] promise he'll fulfill it in his time
[1:14:02] persecuted but not forsaken cast out but
[1:14:04] not destroyed I'm cast out and
[1:14:06] persecuted yet I can rejoice in the Lord
[1:14:08] the Bible says you can
[1:14:10] I'm always bearing in my body the dying
[1:14:12] of the Lord Jesus that the life also of
[1:14:14] Jesus might be manifest in our body
[1:14:19] and he says for this cause we're always
[1:14:21] delivered unto death for Jesus sake that
[1:14:23] the life of Jesus might be made manifest
[1:14:24] in our mortal flesh
[1:14:27] here's another thing in all things
[1:14:29] approving ourselves as the Ministers of
[1:14:31] God in much patience and afflictions in
[1:14:33] necessities and distresses and stripes
[1:14:35] imprisonments and torments and labors
[1:14:37] and watchings in fastings by pureness by
[1:14:39] knowledge by long-suffering by kindness
[1:14:41] by the Holy Ghost by Love unfeigned by
[1:14:44] the word of God by the power of God by
[1:14:45] the armor of righteousness on the right
[1:14:48] hand and on the left
[1:14:50] ah
[1:14:53] and Paul wasn't kidding when he said he
[1:14:55] had troubles all around him
[1:14:58] and then on top of that caring for the
[1:15:00] poor
[1:15:02] on top of that caring for all the
[1:15:03] churches
[1:15:08] now church hopefully your troubles maybe
[1:15:10] when you come into service maybe they
[1:15:11] were like this now maybe they're feeling
[1:15:12] like a lot better like this now
[1:15:16] right
[1:15:19] and you still got a reason to praise
[1:15:22] you still got a reason to show some
[1:15:23] gratitude
[1:15:26] because here's a guy who had a preacher
[1:15:28] prophet he had it all around
[1:15:31] yet he said I Die daily
[1:15:33] yeah I Rejoice always
[1:15:36] I can't wait to meet this guy
[1:15:38] I'm gonna say I got like 90 percent of
[1:15:40] my sermons from you Paul
[1:15:42] I love you
[1:15:44] you're a good man can I can I fellowship
[1:15:46] with you for about 10 000 years
[1:15:48] by Honor and dishonor by evil report and
[1:15:50] good report as deceivers are we're
[1:15:52] called deceivers yet we're true as
[1:15:54] unknown yet well known as dying and
[1:15:56] behold we live as chasten and not killed
[1:15:58] as sorrowful yet always here he says
[1:16:00] again always rejoicing
[1:16:03] I'm sorry for God doesn't move here I'm
[1:16:05] sorry I'm sorry for your suffering and
[1:16:07] God hasn't moved the situation yet but
[1:16:08] yet I'm rejoicing
[1:16:11] because God is going to move praise God
[1:16:14] like brother man I said he's going to
[1:16:15] answer our prayer some way one way or
[1:16:16] another
[1:16:18] right one way or another is going to be
[1:16:19] answered whether we live to see it or
[1:16:21] whether we don't live to see it
[1:16:22] God's going to answer our prayer somehow
[1:16:25] so I can be sorrowful
[1:16:27] yet always rejoicing
[1:16:32] I can be poor yet making many rich
[1:16:37] I can have nothing yet I can possess all
[1:16:41] things
[1:16:42] Church what does this leave us it leaves
[1:16:44] us access to every spiritual blessing
[1:16:47] that we have need of in this life
[1:16:48] and it also at least there's no room for
[1:16:51] any excuses in our Christian walk with
[1:16:52] God
[1:16:54] because we're offered every spiritual
[1:16:57] blessing in Christ Jesus
[1:17:02] Hallelujah
[1:17:07] remember his resume of sufferings
[1:17:11] Labor's more abundant Stripes above
[1:17:14] measure in prisons more frequent and
[1:17:17] deaths off oftentimes close to death
[1:17:21] five times I received 40 Stripes save
[1:17:23] one
[1:17:24] Thrice I was beaten with rods once I was
[1:17:26] stoned Thrice hour Shipwrecked a night
[1:17:28] and a day I had been in the Deep in
[1:17:31] Journeys often in Perils of waters and
[1:17:33] Perils of robbers when was the last time
[1:17:35] you erupt hopefully not recently
[1:17:37] in perils built by my own countrymen in
[1:17:40] perils by the Heathen in perils in the
[1:17:42] city in perils in the wilderness and
[1:17:44] perils in the sea and perils among false
[1:17:46] brethren
[1:17:50] in weariness and painfulness in
[1:17:53] watchings often in hunger and thirst and
[1:17:55] fastings often in cold and nakedness
[1:17:59] beside those things that are without
[1:18:00] that which cometh upon me daily the care
[1:18:02] of the churches who is weak and I'm not
[1:18:04] weak in other words who's suffering and
[1:18:06] I haven't suffered it
[1:18:08] is there any excuse for any Christian
[1:18:10] here today
[1:18:11] to say I can't have the joy of the Lord
[1:18:13] is there any excuse there's no excuses
[1:18:15] now you might be in a season where
[1:18:16] you're you're not full Joy but Jesus
[1:18:19] wants you to get he wants he'll take you
[1:18:20] there he'll eventually get you to full
[1:18:22] Joy praise God
[1:18:24] who's offended and I'm Bernat
[1:18:27] if I must needs Glory I will glory the
[1:18:29] things which concern my infirmities
[1:18:33] so I'm closing with this church let's
[1:18:34] take advantage of the joyful seasons of
[1:18:36] life
[1:18:40] I could go back to that list I'm not
[1:18:42] going through I'm not going through any
[1:18:43] of those things right now
[1:18:47] haven't been robbed recently
[1:18:49] now I've given to people and whether
[1:18:51] they robbed me or not it doesn't matter
[1:18:52] I'm going to pray for them anyway
[1:18:57] I've never been Shipwrecked the worst we
[1:18:59] had was I had a flat tire a few weeks
[1:19:01] ago Malachi right that's the worst I've
[1:19:03] had
[1:19:04] in the rain
[1:19:05] but it wasn't heavy rain
[1:19:09] think of our trials
[1:19:11] that's why the Bible says our trials are
[1:19:13] light afflictions
[1:19:15] right
[1:19:16] and then in all things in all situations
[1:19:19] we are admonished rejoice in the lord
[1:19:22] always and again I say rejoice
[1:19:27] Rejoice because you have the atonement
[1:19:30] Rejoice because Jesus has done The Great
[1:19:33] Exchange
[1:19:34] and recently with those Napoleon
[1:19:36] Services if one or a few of my daughters
[1:19:39] or Naomi's daughters whoever was there
[1:19:41] in Betsy and Dustin's daughters whoever
[1:19:42] believe they got the Holy Ghost if just
[1:19:44] one of them received eternal life
[1:19:47] think about that church that's the one
[1:19:50] and only time they'll ever receive it
[1:19:52] because it's a seal unto the day of your
[1:19:54] Redemption
[1:19:58] that is the greatest occasion we could
[1:20:01] any of us could ever think of now I
[1:20:03] didn't put wedding up there that's a
[1:20:04] pretty good day when you get married I
[1:20:05] don't want anybody to feel bad you know
[1:20:10] but if you receive eternal life
[1:20:12] there could be no greater gift you could
[1:20:14] ever receive
[1:20:16] because everything else will run out
[1:20:18] you might get a brand new car for your
[1:20:20] birthday if your parents are rich
[1:20:21] eventually is going to rust out
[1:20:23] it's going to break down
[1:20:27] but if you receive eternal life
[1:20:29] there's no greater gift than ever could
[1:20:31] be given to anybody
[1:20:33] praise God
[1:20:35] that's why the Bible says I have no
[1:20:36] Greater Joy
[1:20:38] than to hear that my children walk in
[1:20:40] the truth
[1:20:42] that my children choose our children
[1:20:44] choose the path of righteousness
[1:20:47] the straight and narrow way
[1:20:50] and the church said let's end our feet
[1:20:52] musicians can come praise God
[1:20:54] got to recognize
[1:20:56] take advantage of the joyful seasons of
[1:20:58] life
[1:21:01] church let me share this too
[1:21:04] before I preached that Saturday night
[1:21:05] service about dancing their brother cams
[1:21:07] I visited Mike McCloskey
[1:21:12] and I cried with him
[1:21:15] yet I was joyful with him
[1:21:23] and I said brother I said you have
[1:21:24] suffered
[1:21:26] he said all I want is healing and he
[1:21:28] said I just got to have patience I said
[1:21:29] you're exactly right
[1:21:31] I looked at him and I was crying I had
[1:21:33] tears in my eyes I said brother you have
[1:21:35] way more faith than I'll ever have
[1:21:39] because you have suffered through a 14
[1:21:41] year season of absolute physical torment
[1:21:46] and I get upset when I get a cold sore
[1:21:48] in my mouth and I can't heal it after a
[1:21:49] few days I'll be like god what have I
[1:21:51] done
[1:21:52] foolishness
[1:21:54] immaturity
[1:22:00] I said brother you have way more faith
[1:22:01] than I'll ever have
[1:22:03] yeah I've spoken things God's allowed me
[1:22:05] to speak things he anointed to me and
[1:22:06] prayed for people and healed
[1:22:08] I said I'll never have faith like that
[1:22:10] unless God will call me to that
[1:22:15] and he looked at me and he said brother
[1:22:16] Jesse he said I can't wait
[1:22:18] until I get out of this wheelchair
[1:22:21] that's for Jesus
[1:22:23] I said I'll dance for you tonight
[1:22:24] brother and boy did I
[1:22:31] suffering in this season
[1:22:33] his season is this awful long season of
[1:22:36] suffering when is it going to end we
[1:22:38] don't know we don't know
[1:22:40] but he's choosing patience he's choosing
[1:22:44] to quote the promise of God he's
[1:22:46] choosing remember God's Pride
[1:22:50] remember God's promise
[1:22:54] Church all of us are in different
[1:22:55] seasons of life right all of us go
[1:22:57] through different trials

[1:23:38] the churches
[1:23:40] yet having to Die daily yet being beaten
[1:23:45] fasting often cold often
[1:23:48] work most of us don't battle what half
[1:23:50] of these things
