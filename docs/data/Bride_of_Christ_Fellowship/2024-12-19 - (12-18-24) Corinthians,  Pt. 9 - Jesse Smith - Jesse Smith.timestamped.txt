[0:00] series here by the grace of God by the
[0:01] help of
[0:02] God I told Brother Brian I said brother
[0:05] you just preached uh uh your best sermon
[0:07] I've ever heard that and I was I'm not
[0:08] saying that to lift people up you know I
[0:10] try not to lift people up but I can just
[0:12] tell he's really yielding and is the
[0:14] live stream on now okay so I won't say
[0:16] anything more but maybe after the live
[0:17] stream's over but um yeah I felt the
[0:20] Holy Spirit was really Discerning
[0:22] situations in the church I told Brother
[0:24] Brian that and he said brother Jesse I
[0:26] don't listen to anything you preach I
[0:28] said praise God brother
[0:30] uh so I was very thankful and I felt uh
[0:32] really Vindicated by the holy spirit
[0:34] that God's dealing with us helping us uh
[0:37] get through the trials we'll get through
[0:38] them by the grace of the Lord God's
[0:39] faithful and we just got a lot to be
[0:41] thankful for so very thankful God Is So
[0:46] timely so 1 Corinthians chapter 5 verse
[0:49] one by the grace of God this is part
[0:50] nine on the Corinthians series I don't
[0:53] have any slides uh we just had a crazy
[0:55] busy week here at school but uh after
[0:57] this week we get two weeks off so I'm be
[0:59] rejoicing in that I try to take a few
[1:02] naps and I don't know try to enjoy life
[1:04] a little bit by God's grace a little
[1:06] more I should say 1 Corinthians 5 vers1
[1:09] let's just read verse one and then uh
[1:11] we'll have you be seated here by God's
[1:13] grace I want to watch your time
[1:14] hopefully I can finish in an hour maybe
[1:15] a little less we'll
[1:17] see on three one two 3 it is reported
[1:21] commonly that there is fornication among
[1:24] you and such fornication as is not so
[1:28] much as named among the Gentiles that
[1:31] one should have his father's wife what a
[1:34] text and what a letter to write uh from
[1:36] the St Paul God bless you as you're
[1:38] being seated may God add his Blessing to
[1:40] the reading of his word 1 Corinthians
[1:42] chapter 5 we're starting there now
[1:44] remember uh in verse uh well chapter
[1:47] four the previous chapter he ends with
[1:50] this question am I going to come and see
[1:52] you with a rod am I going to come see
[1:54] you in love or in the spirit of
[1:57] meekness now that was when he would
[1:59] physically get there now here in chapter
[2:01] 5 now he starts a new uh area here of
[2:04] we'd say sin in the church he spent the
[2:07] first four chapters on divisions and
[2:11] groups that isolate themselves away from
[2:13] other groups now see church we got to be
[2:15] real careful not to isolate ourselves
[2:17] from other people right if we see
[2:20] ourselves or other people not wanting to
[2:22] be around people uh we got to really
[2:25] watch that that's divisions like Paul
[2:27] was talking about here a Christian uh
[2:29] brother R said if you can't wait to get
[2:31] into the church to see your brothers and
[2:33] sisters in Christ he said something's
[2:35] wrong with you brother Ram said if
[2:36] you've got the Holy Ghost he said you
[2:38] can't wait for those doors to open and
[2:40] to worship with your brothers and
[2:42] sisters and the church said so you
[2:44] should be happy if you were happy to
[2:45] come here tonight by God's grace if not
[2:47] it's time to clean out your life
[2:48] Hallelujah get your heart right because
[2:50] if you got the Holy Ghost you can't wait
[2:52] to get to church worship God see your
[2:54] family that you're going to spend
[2:55] eternity with amen amen hallelujah
[2:58] that's right so it's a great Blessing by
[3:00] the grace of God he spends four chapters
[3:02] on groups that were divided in this case
[3:04] they're divided on ministers who was the
[3:07] best Minister who was their favorite
[3:08] Ministry who baptized them and we've
[3:11] been through that quite extensively and
[3:13] I thought that was great brother Brian I
[3:14] told him I said brother you preached uh
[3:17] on favorite preachers at the end he
[3:19] mentioned Le in the middle so I said
[3:21] brother you preached a perfect sermon
[3:23] between chapter four and chapter five
[3:26] Hallelujah because he mentioned four
[3:29] right divisions and then he mentioned L
[3:30] I said well I'm going right into l in
[3:32] chapter 5 I said brother couldn't have
[3:33] been more perfect so I was very thankful
[3:36] and he said brother Jesse I don't listen
[3:37] to anything you do on purpose I said
[3:39] thank you
[3:40] brother I appreciate that like I told
[3:42] Simon too you know I told Simon I said
[3:44] brother was such a wonderful message I
[3:46] said that's why I don't talk to Simon
[3:47] about anything Simon har list is to
[3:48] anything I say unless you know he said
[3:50] he woke up one time and Beth was playing
[3:52] something I was uh one of my videos
[3:54] there by God's grace but I love it I
[3:56] don't talk to those preachers I don't
[3:57] tell them any of our problems or any of
[3:58] my problems right I tell Jesus my
[4:00] problems and my wife uh and so we're
[4:04] thankful that God comes in here he knows
[4:05] how to give us the word of Truth praise
[4:07] God he knows how to discern the thoughts
[4:08] and intents of our hearts so we're very
[4:11] thankful we rejoice in what God has done
[4:13] now Paul said am I going to come with a
[4:14] rod when I come physically and be with
[4:16] among you or in love and the spirit of
[4:19] meekness well uh by history it looks
[4:21] like he came with the spirit of meekness
[4:23] because the people had repented but but
[4:26] as we can see right here in chapter five
[4:27] he's going to come with a rod in chapter
[4:29] five
[4:30] the rod there in the Greek if you look
[4:31] up the rod it means the most severe
[4:34] Christian punishment and so we're going
[4:35] to see the most severe Christian
[4:37] punishment here in chapter five is
[4:40] excommunication kicking somebody out of
[4:42] the church and saying don't come back
[4:44] until you repented your sins so Paul's
[4:47] going to write with the spirit of a rod
[4:50] to correct them uh like brother R said
[4:52] in that remember uh at the beginning of
[4:54] you remember when I preached on the
[4:54] Rapture brother Ram said I hope uh uh to
[4:57] make Sinners so ashamed of themselves
[4:59] that they'll become Christians at the
[5:00] end of this
[5:01] sermon so see you we should be ashamed
[5:04] of our sin it should make us ashamed of
[5:07] ourselves then we should repent and get
[5:09] right with God because of our sin
[5:11] Hallelujah so we should feel that
[5:12] conviction of the Holy Spirit now here
[5:15] in verse one uh 1 Corinthians 51 it says
[5:17] it's reported commonly that there's uh
[5:19] fornication among you I think it was if
[5:21] I'm not mistaken in chapter 1 wasn't it
[5:22] the house of Khloe that are reported to
[5:24] Paul these
[5:26] divisions let me just make sure I got
[5:28] that right let me peek back there
[5:31] yes verse yeah chapter one The House of
[5:34] Khloe you reported to the the uh the
[5:36] prophet of God so Khloe and Oliver House
[5:38] said listen you know we've seen this in
[5:39] the church we got divisions here this
[5:41] one was Paul Apollos and so we wonder if
[5:44] Khloe's house also let let him know
[5:46] about the fornication here we don't know
[5:48] um but see that wasn't tattling right it
[5:50] wasn't like tattling it wasn't
[5:51] backbiting it was just letting the
[5:53] prophet know because nobody in the local
[5:54] church was fixing it so hopefully
[5:56] somebody outside the church could fix it
[5:59] so that's why the house of Khloe let
[6:01] Paul know these people weren't even sad
[6:03] about their sins remember we're going to
[6:06] see right here they're puffed up they're
[6:08] proud of their sexual sin in the church
[6:11] so the house of kloe's like what can we
[6:13] do the pastors aren't making nobody's
[6:14] correcting it they reach out to the
[6:16] prophet of God
[6:18] hallelujah so a a man is sleeping with
[6:21] his stepwisely
[6:29] right this is and think of you know
[6:31] think of the news around us today you
[6:33] know you often don't hear things like
[6:35] this right a man with his own
[6:38] stepmother but church if you think about
[6:40] it you know this is really nothing new
[6:42] to the people of God if you think about
[6:45] it just for a moment I know it might
[6:47] might sound strange but hang on just a
[6:48] second God's people often struggle more
[6:51] with sin than even unbelievers in small
[6:54] little CA I'm sorry there are a few
[6:56] cases I shouldn't say often there are a
[6:58] few cases where God's people strugg with
[6:59] sin more than the
[7:01] heathens right Israel sinned worse than
[7:05] the heathens that God kicked out of
[7:07] their
[7:08] land there was generations of Jews uh
[7:12] for example Manasseh pull up 2 Kings
[7:15] 21:9 God says it plainly they've been in
[7:17] the promised land you know hundreds of
[7:18] years now and God said that they hekken
[7:21] not and manasse seduce them to do more
[7:24] evil than the Nations whom the Lord
[7:26] destroyed before the children of Israel
[7:30] so everybody see that that's that's
[7:32] scriptural uh so we shouldn't expect
[7:34] that sometimes Christians are going to
[7:36] do such awful things to put a reproach
[7:39] on the name of Christ now why is that
[7:41] now this just my guess this just me
[7:43] brother R says when people say they're
[7:44] Satan and Born Again Satan takes every
[7:46] gun he's got and he points it right at
[7:49] them every firing squad right every man
[7:52] with a weapon every woman with a weapon
[7:55] as soon as somebody says I'm filled with
[7:57] the Holy Ghost I'm a real Saint amen
[7:59] Satan comes around and says prove it and
[8:02] God lets him because remember Satan
[8:04] before he can come around there with
[8:05] every gun poin at you he's got to say uh
[8:08] God can I do this God will have to say
[8:10] yes or he'll say no that's why the Bible
[8:12] said lead us not into temptation we
[8:14] should pray that God don't don't suffer
[8:16] me to go through this hard temptation
[8:18] but Deliver Me From Evil Hallelujah see
[8:22] God doesn't tempt anybody but God allows
[8:24] us to be tempted that's why Jesus said
[8:26] we should pray God like it's just like
[8:28] brother R said uh said I pray all the
[8:30] time lord don't let your hedge go out
[8:32] from around me don't let Satan come in
[8:34] and attack
[8:35] me like a job situation that type of
[8:38] situation lead me not into temptation
[8:41] but Deliver Me From Evil
[8:43] Hallelujah now that's just my thought
[8:46] because Satan Works extra hard on the
[8:49] church or the Believers just like he did
[8:51] there uh the Jews that's one
[8:55] example so you know we should understand
[8:58] this has happened before
[9:00] sins that not even that don't even
[9:02] happen in the heathens can happen
[9:04] amongst Believers now why is that true
[9:06] also Church another reason why is people
[9:09] misuse
[9:10] Grace they don't understand that Grace
[9:13] doesn't lead us to a less Holiness it
[9:15] leads us into
[9:17] Holiness Grace should give us uh
[9:19] appreciation for God and help us to
[9:21] serve God more
[9:23] Faithfully Hallelujah like I listed all
[9:26] those things brother Brian I mean look
[9:27] at there's like a list of 20 sins he
[9:29] preached on 20 sins that stop us from
[9:32] worshiping
[9:33] God think about that and now I think I
[9:35] told uh our church you know I feel like
[9:37] our worships kind of gone down when was
[9:39] the last time we danced you know just
[9:42] spontaneously think about that well is
[9:46] it because of something we've done or is
[9:47] it just a season or but see each
[9:49] person's got to look at their life
[9:51] individually am I giving God my best
[9:54] amen think about that when was it are
[9:56] you really clapping like you mean it are
[9:57] you really raising your hands like mean
[9:59] it are you even saying amen like you
[10:01] mean it and you you don't have to I'm
[10:03] just saying like you know you you got to
[10:05] judge
[10:06] yourself but that's what God preached to
[10:08] us through brother Brian if you don't
[10:10] give God your all then then you're
[10:12] you're holding back you're robbing God
[10:13] of worship and you're bringing a a a a
[10:17] polluted sacrifice to the house of
[10:19] God hallelujah I'm going to get to more
[10:21] on that just a minute because I heard a
[10:22] good preacher preach something on that
[10:24] this week really good thought I was like
[10:26] wow that was good it was really timely
[10:28] right after I got done pray prayed in
[10:29] the prayer closet uh I heard this
[10:31] preacher say I'm like that was good so
[10:33] hopefully hopefully you like it as much
[10:34] as I did it's coming up pretty soon here
[10:36] it's pretty soon in my notes
[10:38] here so see we could expect that because
[10:40] Satan's got all of his guns pointed on
[10:42] the True Church of God and if God allows
[10:45] him to do it then we're going to go go
[10:46] through tests remember all those things
[10:47] job he struggled with oh I wish I was
[10:50] never born cursed to be the day I was
[10:51] even
[10:52] born I mean he he was on emotional
[10:54] roller
[10:56] coaster months of not sleeping well
[10:58] which he couldn't sleep on any side I
[11:00] mean he's got boils all over he couldn't
[11:02] find a good side to sleep
[11:03] on some days he'd have good days some
[11:05] days he'd had bad days cursing even the
[11:08] day he was born but yet the whole time
[11:11] God's like ah he's a perfect man he's
[11:14] going to stand the test he's going to
[11:15] overcome I wouldn't allowed him to go
[11:17] through it if I didn't know he wouldn't
[11:19] overcome it he will overcome and seven
[11:22] times in Revelation 2 and3 Jesus said he
[11:24] that overcometh gets the reward how many
[11:26] want to be Overcomers
[11:28] amen if you want to be an overcomer you
[11:30] got to overcome something got to
[11:32] overcome some test you got to fight some
[11:35] battle you got to fight some enemy you
[11:36] got to fight some wickedness you that
[11:38] means it's got to get close to you you
[11:40] got to fight it off Hallelujah we can do
[11:42] it by the grace of God hallelujah he
[11:44] gave us the greatest weapon he could
[11:45] give us the word of God verse two and ye
[11:48] are puffed up and have not rather
[11:50] mourned that ye that he had done this
[11:52] deed might be taken away from among you
[11:56] so they were proud of their sexual sin
[11:58] now that's hard to understand I don't
[12:00] know how that we've never had that in
[12:02] our church I don't know um I I don't
[12:04] know how this could happen but maybe
[12:06] again they tried to act like maybe I
[12:08] heard a I heard a preacher say this
[12:09] maybe they were trying uh to act like
[12:12] they were being
[12:13] gracious like Oh Brother son so yes I
[12:15] know you're in sin but oh God still
[12:17] loves you and God's going to bring you
[12:18] through and we're just proud you came to
[12:21] church but Paul says you've been proud
[12:24] about this sexual sin you should have
[12:26] done the opposite you should have
[12:27] mourned how can this guy keep coming to
[12:30] church like this God have mercy now not
[12:33] criticizing but feeling the weight of
[12:35] sin and make sin making you
[12:39] sad but here they get prideful about
[12:41] their sin well maybe they're saying well
[12:43] well we're the most gracious and loving
[12:44] Church in the message so that's why he
[12:46] can we're just glad he comes till he
[12:49] gets the Victory and Paul's like that's
[12:51] the wrong
[12:52] attitude
[12:54] Hallelujah with this sexual sin now I'm
[12:56] talking about sexual sin
[13:00] perhaps it was like Jude 1:3 Paul I'm
[13:03] sorry Jude said men of old were ordained
[13:05] to this Con condemnation to turn the
[13:07] grace of God into
[13:09] lasciviousness so that's just my guess I
[13:11] could be wrong again so again some of
[13:13] these statements are pretty uh
[13:14] interesting by St Paul hard to maybe be
[13:16] understood but sin should make us mourn
[13:19] should should or sin should not make us
[13:25] prideful now here's a new thought I had
[13:27] pull up Psalm 516 and I got it from a
[13:29] preacher it wasn't from the directly
[13:31] from the Holy Spirit or something like
[13:32] that I mean believe ultimately it was
[13:33] from the Holy Spirit but Psalm 51:16 and
[13:37] 17 two verses there so I check this
[13:40] thought I I thought it was just said
[13:41] beautifully and I probably can't do it
[13:42] credit but uh I really like this
[13:44] preacher in the message he said for this
[13:47] is of course after David's sexual sin
[13:49] with
[13:49] basheba now let's not don't don't turn
[13:52] me off think about if you've had a sin
[13:54] and you know you've done wrong and you
[13:55] haven't made it right yet that's what
[13:56] I'm talking about let's let this apply
[13:59] to us and not just well David or that
[14:01] that guy in Corinthians or that person
[14:03] out there let's apply this to ourselves
[14:05] and especially our worship because we
[14:07] just heard about that God sent a man in
[14:09] here to preach on our worship we got to
[14:11] give God our best Hallelujah is that
[14:14] right we got to give God our best or God
[14:17] doesn't receive it amen he only worship
[14:19] he only receives Worship in spirit and
[14:21] in truth
[14:23] hallelujah
[14:26] right verse 16 for thou Divi desire not
[14:29] sacrifice so after David's sexual sin
[14:33] God didn't want him to go sacrifice
[14:36] animals so when you sin God don't want
[14:38] you to stand up and and give give God
[14:41] praise and sing that's not the sacrifice
[14:43] God wants even God don't want you to
[14:45] clap and you know well I'll pay a little
[14:48] more extra in the tithe I'll give a few
[14:50] dollars of offering and I'll actually
[14:52] play pay some
[14:54] offering you most people don't pay
[14:55] offering right in a lot of most churches
[14:58] I mean all the pastors I've talked to a
[14:59] lot of people just don't give offering
[15:01] and that's that shows how much you love
[15:03] God now I didn't plan to preach on money
[15:05] I just came to me right
[15:07] now but look God doesn't Dei desire that
[15:10] God didn't devire desire David's
[15:12] sacrifice of animals else I would give
[15:14] it thou Delight us not in the burnt
[15:17] offering God didn't want David to go
[15:19] kill some animals the sacrifices of God
[15:22] are a broken Spirit God wanted David to
[15:25] cry about his
[15:27] sin that's what God wants for from us
[15:29] when we sin God don't wants to come and
[15:31] try to get through song service or
[15:32] pretend so so nobody thinks we're a
[15:34] hypocrite right pretend like we're
[15:36] worshiping God wants you to be sad about
[15:38] your
[15:39] sin that's the sacrifice he wants then
[15:42] when you repented and you feel the joy
[15:43] of the Lord you feel forgiven then start
[15:45] bringing some burnt offerings
[15:47] amen I just loved how it was said like
[15:50] that God don't if you're in sin don't
[15:52] try to pretend like you're happy and
[15:53] things like that give God a broken
[15:56] Spirit that's the sacrifice he wants so
[15:59] I heard a good preacher say that that
[16:00] was really good one of the best
[16:01] preachers I
[16:03] know I'm not going to name names because
[16:04] I don't want to get into
[16:06] that so see Church you know we got to
[16:08] God doesn't want us to pretend to enjoy
[16:10] song service or he wants us broken for
[16:13] our sin
[16:14] Hallelujah and yes I know we got to
[16:16] bring our bodies into subjection I'm not
[16:17] talking about that I'm talking about
[16:19] when you have sin that's not right and
[16:21] you're harboring things or like a
[16:22] brother listed all those sins and you
[16:24] don't make it right shame on us God
[16:27] wants us to have a broken spirit first
[16:29] then bring a sacrifice of praise
[16:32] Hallelujah 1 Corinthians 5:3 for I
[16:35] verily as absent in the body but present
[16:37] in spirit have judged already so see
[16:40] Paul said I've already judged this as
[16:42] though I were present concerning him
[16:44] that had done this deed now we're going
[16:45] to know why because he'd already wrote
[16:47] to them about not eating with
[16:48] fornicators they already knew his
[16:50] judgment and those who had the Holy
[16:52] Ghost in that congregation they already
[16:54] knew what Paul was going to judge
[16:55] because they're born again now was it
[16:58] must have been a small group right
[16:59] because there's a lot of sin going on
[17:01] there not much being
[17:03] confessed Hallelujah so this must mean
[17:06] the Holy Spirit should have convicted
[17:08] the Saints the real saints to know what
[17:10] Paul would have judged and Paul as we
[17:12] said he already we're going to see this
[17:13] he' already wrote to them at this is
[17:15] actually this this first Corinthians is
[17:16] actually the second letter of the
[17:18] Corinthians if you know your Bible real
[17:21] well which it's just a small point but
[17:23] see he said I've judged already what a
[17:26] prophet can judge yes a Prophet can
[17:29] judge but remember in chapter 3 Paul
[17:32] said don't judge anything before the
[17:34] time so that must be referring to a
[17:36] different judgment and it is that's
[17:38] referring to judging a Ministry to make
[17:40] a final decision well that brother's
[17:42] lost or that brother's a true man of God
[17:43] or that brother he's off the word a
[17:45] final judgment now see so that's the
[17:48] that's the one you leave up to God God
[17:51] will judge that
[17:52] preacher right now can we judge fruits
[17:55] absolutely we judge that's a good fruit
[17:58] that's a corrupt fruit we judge the
[18:00] fruits of people's lives Hallelujah but
[18:03] to make a final judgment just say Lord
[18:05] save that brother save that sister bring
[18:07] them to repentance help them Lord God
[18:09] I'm not making a final judgment
[18:11] amen but see we can judge individual
[18:14] situations and Paul says I've judged
[18:16] this man sleeping with his stepmom
[18:19] already
[18:21] hallelujah what about all these people
[18:23] that say don't judge me don't judge me
[18:25] don't judge me Paul's like I'm judging
[18:27] I'm judging I'm judging
[18:29] the corrupt fruits I'm not judging your
[18:32] Eternal destination I'm judging the
[18:34] current corrupt fruits you're spewing
[18:36] out before the church
[18:39] Hallelujah that's
[18:41] right so in other words Paul did not
[18:44] have a plank in his eye he could judge
[18:45] this the right way Paul wasn't sleeping
[18:48] around or doing other things like that
[18:49] Paul was living clean so he could judge
[18:51] this the right
[18:53] way right that's the only time you can't
[18:55] judge is when you got sin in your life
[18:57] that's when you shouldn't judge people's
[18:58] fruits because you've got bad
[19:00] fruits
[19:03] right Paul wasn't committing sexual sin
[19:06] remember in chapter 4 he said he didn't
[19:07] have any sin in his life it was 4 verse4
[19:09] from last Wednesday for I know nothing
[19:11] by myself see I don't know nothing I I
[19:13] don't know any sin I've done wrong yet
[19:15] am I not hereby Justified but he that
[19:17] judges me is the Lord see it said as far
[19:20] as my conscience before God I don't have
[19:22] any planks in my eye Hallelujah I'm
[19:25] living righteously before God almighty
[19:28] Hallelujah now verse four now this one I
[19:30] used for water baptism see if you can
[19:32] see where I use it for water baptism a
[19:34] few years ago uh in the name of our Lord
[19:36] Jesus Christ when you're gathered
[19:38] together and my spirit with the power of
[19:40] our Lord Jesus Christ now how does this
[19:43] relate to baptism some people said well
[19:46] there's no power uh in the Lord Jesus
[19:48] Christ it's father son Holy Ghost I beg
[19:52] I beg your pardon he said in the name of
[19:54] the Lord Jesus and the power of our Lord
[19:57] Jesus Christ see there's power in the
[20:00] name of our husband Hallelujah there's
[20:02] wonderwork power in the Precious Blood
[20:05] of the Lamb
[20:06] Hallelujah that's
[20:08] right why didn't Paul say in the name of
[20:11] the father son Holy
[20:14] Ghost right why do you say Lord Jesus
[20:16] Christ because that is the name of the
[20:18] father son Holy Ghost Hallelujah and
[20:21] remember Paul said uh Jesus Christ
[20:24] revealed the gospel to him so Paul's
[20:26] going to make a judgment he said I'm
[20:27] judging this situation in the name of
[20:29] the Lord Jesus Christ now can you judge
[20:31] situations in the name of the Lord Jesus
[20:33] Christ in the next chapter he's going to
[20:34] say when there's problems in the church
[20:37] he said why can't you get judges around
[20:38] and see who can judge it right
[20:42] Hallelujah that's right and when you
[20:44] make the right judgment if you really
[20:46] under the spirit of God you can say I
[20:47] judge this in the name of our Lord Jesus
[20:49] Christ you better be right too or if not
[20:51] you're got a lying Spirit on you is that
[20:54] right that's what Paul did he said I'm
[20:57] judging this in the name of the Lord
[20:59] Jesus Christ I don't have sexual sin in
[21:00] my life but I can judge this I can judge
[21:03] this by the power of the Holy Spirit
[21:06] Hallelujah remember Paul said in Romans
[21:08] 2:16 all men would be judged by his
[21:10] gospel and Galatians 1 Paul said Jesus
[21:12] Christ revealed this gospel to me what
[21:14] the gospel of the power in the name of
[21:16] the Lord Jesus Christ
[21:20] Hallelujah and notice Paul said in the
[21:22] name of Jesus Christ and my spirit so
[21:25] what's he saying he said he's saying
[21:27] remember me Paul Paul said you have a
[21:29] 10,000 instructors but you don't have
[21:31] many fathers in in other words remember
[21:33] me I was a father figure to you in the
[21:35] faith I taught you the gospel I showed
[21:38] you the gospel you got saved under my
[21:39] Ministry praise God
[21:42] Amen and also he was a prophet of God he
[21:45] told them he was a prophet of God in 1
[21:47] Corinthians 14:36 what came the word of
[21:50] God out from you or came unto you only
[21:52] he's talking about women no women
[21:53] preachers verse 37 If any man think
[21:56] himself to be a prophet or spiritual let
[21:58] acknowledge that the things that I write
[22:00] unto you are the Commandments of the
[22:02] Lord but if any man be ignorant let him
[22:04] be ignorant that's quite a statement
[22:07] there Hallelujah he said did the word
[22:10] come out of you no the word came out of
[22:11] me I met Jesus Christ in the desert
[22:14] Hallelujah Jesus revealed himself to me
[22:16] Hallelujah he's taking on that Apostolic
[22:18] Authority Hallelujah now look he says
[22:20] let the ignorant be ignorant so why
[22:22] didn't Paul say well no uh no I need to
[22:24] go to every single person and try to win
[22:26] them over because I believe Paul had the
[22:27] same revelation Jesus did Jesus said all
[22:30] that the father has given me will come
[22:32] to me praise God if you got the right
[22:35] spirit and if you really want the truth
[22:36] God will guide you into all truth
[22:38] hallelujah that's the promise he'll give
[22:41] you your heart's desire he'll give you
[22:43] every man and woman the desire of their
[22:45] heart like he gave balum right like he
[22:47] gave Paul each one God will give you
[22:50] your heart's desire Hallelujah so you
[22:52] must desire the true teaching of the
[22:53] word of God the true move of the Holy
[22:57] Spirit verse vers five so in the name of
[23:00] the Lord Jesus Christ verse 5 to deliver
[23:02] such and one unto Satan for the
[23:04] destruction of the flesh so this is the
[23:06] rod this is the absolute worst thing
[23:08] that could happen to a person a church
[23:10] would kick them out of church and they'd
[23:12] be given over think of that you're in
[23:14] the hands of angels but then you're then
[23:16] you're given into the very hands of
[23:18] Satan
[23:19] himself what worse thing could happen to
[23:21] a person than that where God's not going
[23:24] to come in and try to make any any help
[23:26] they're just going to be given over and
[23:27] suffer and suffer and shame and pain and
[23:31] he's going to K slowly kill you or quick
[23:33] try to quickly kill you into the very
[23:36] hands of Satan himself nothing could be
[23:38] worse than this but this didn't have to
[23:39] happen right and and it didn't happen
[23:42] because he realized I shouldn't live in
[23:44] this sexual sin thank God a prophet
[23:46] corrected me thank God someone's trying
[23:47] to correct me to get this evil spirit
[23:49] this evil spirit of Pride off my life
[23:51] amen thank
[23:53] God because someone told me the truth
[23:56] somebody tried to reach out to me thank
[23:57] God someone reached out to me so I'm not
[23:59] giv over into the hands of Satan
[24:05] himself
[24:07] Hallelujah deliver someone like that
[24:10] that won't repent that's prideful over
[24:12] their sins deliver someone like that
[24:14] over to Satan that Satan will destroy
[24:17] his flesh that the spirit may be saved
[24:19] in the day of the Lord Jesus so no doubt
[24:22] the church would have already had to
[24:23] follow the steps of Matthew 18 we talked
[24:25] about that a few weeks ago right uh go
[24:27] oneon-one but if it's a woman against a
[24:29] man well men and women that aren't
[24:31] married shouldn't be alone together so
[24:32] you got to take somebody else with you
[24:35] right so you got to take balance with
[24:36] the scripture so you go one to one if
[24:38] it's man to man or woman to woman if the
[24:40] person doesn't repent then you take
[24:42] another witness right and then if it
[24:44] won't repent then you take it before the
[24:46] whole church
[24:49] Hallelujah that's the scripture so Paul
[24:52] and and Paul must have known the
[24:54] Corinthians had gone through this
[24:56] process
[24:59] now what's interesting church is this
[25:00] look at this thought of uh God allows
[25:02] people to be given over to the
[25:04] destruction of their flesh to go through
[25:06] sufferings that they might be saved and
[25:09] they they might learn to obey the word
[25:11] of God he wasn't this man this man in
[25:14] sexual sin wasn't the only one I believe
[25:16] also the thief on the cross probably had
[25:18] to go through
[25:19] this God had to let him be crucified so
[25:23] he could run into
[25:25] Jesus his flesh was being destroyed but
[25:28] what happened happened his Spirit was
[25:29] saved hallelujah amen hallelujah brother
[25:33] said he knew many a man and woman that
[25:35] had to be put on their deathbed in order
[25:37] to repent of their sins what happened to
[25:39] that this is what
[25:41] happened even if they left the church
[25:43] see you can run you can run for so long
[25:45] but you can't run forever from God
[25:46] hallelujah and if you're a child of God
[25:48] God's going to chasen you and get you to
[25:50] repent he's going to do whatever he can
[25:52] to get that Soul saved hallelujah
[25:56] amen Jo had to suffer in order to repent
[26:00] in the whale's
[26:01] belly
[26:03] hallelujah king Manasseh we read about
[26:05] him earlier he let Israel get to the
[26:07] absolute worst state even worse than the
[26:09] heathens before that but yet he was
[26:11] captured by the Assyrians but then he
[26:13] repented while in prison and God heard
[26:16] his prayer think about that the message
[26:18] preacher that went the furthest into sin
[26:20] even if he would humble himself God
[26:22] would deliver
[26:24] him that's 2 Chronicles uh 33:12 you
[26:28] want to put that up there maybe about
[26:29] Manasseh I hope I typed that out
[26:31] right 2 Chronicles
[26:35] 33:12 and he was in Affliction there it
[26:37] is and he besought so he was getting you
[26:39] know just the the the prison food the
[26:41] prison water not getting a good diet and
[26:43] God had to break him down walk him
[26:45] across the desert in Chains God had to
[26:47] Humble him probably strip his clothes
[26:50] and embarrass him all this and finally
[26:52] after all that embarrassment and all
[26:53] that shame finally in his prison he can
[26:55] humble himself and recognize the
[26:57] presence of God and God can have his
[26:59] body and his health destroyed and then
[27:00] in that condition then God can get a
[27:02] repentant heart Hallelujah and God knew
[27:04] that's exactly what happened to get all
[27:06] that Pride out of his heart
[27:09] amen but no wonder brother said pride is
[27:12] such an awful
[27:14] thing people can't say they're sorry
[27:16] they can't get the victory right they
[27:19] think they're so great and all these
[27:20] lifting themselves above above over the
[27:22] other people just like Paul's dealing
[27:23] with in this church here such an awful
[27:26] thing
[27:28] but it took this all this Affliction he
[27:31] finally beseeches the Lord so before he
[27:34] wasn't seeking God before he wasn't
[27:35] going after God he can now he can
[27:37] finally while in prison with barely
[27:38] little food all the pain and suffering
[27:40] of prison and captivity slave life he
[27:43] can finally find a place of
[27:46] repentance
[27:48] Hallelujah doesn't this remind you of
[27:50] The Prodigal Son except his prison
[27:52] wasn't a physical
[27:54] prison it's a spiritual prison
[27:59] what does it take a starving man wanting
[28:01] to eat Pig's
[28:02] food that finally caused him to come to
[28:05] himself why am I living like this why
[28:07] did I do this why did I betray my father
[28:09] why did I betray my mother why did I
[28:11] betray my brother why did I do all this
[28:13] surely I I could live a better life if I
[28:15] just realize I sinned against heaven and
[28:17] I sinned against my father surely
[28:19] they'll receive me surely I can have a
[28:21] better life than this oh thank God
[28:22] people can come to their senses that
[28:24] their souls can be saved
[28:26] hallelujah thank God Hallelujah
[28:29] remember even Paul himself when he was
[28:31] first Saved he had to be blind for three
[28:34] days and not eat anything for three days
[28:37] to finally accept
[28:38] Christ
[28:40] blind right the flesh feeling like it's
[28:43] destroyed and then he still suffered all
[28:45] the eye trouble and then God still let
[28:48] uh Devils Buffet his flesh to keep him
[28:52] humble see God many times does many
[28:54] things in our flesh to keep us humble to
[28:57] save our soul Souls CU realize this
[29:00] flesh is going to end Someday my soul's
[29:01] going somewhere I'm not just a a a
[29:05] spoonful of uh Ohio dust as brother Ram
[29:09] said Kentucky Indiana
[29:12] dirt I'm more than just a spoonful of
[29:15] Ohio dirt you got a soul inside that
[29:18] that body that's worth 10,000
[29:20] worlds Hallelujah and what about my last
[29:23] one what about Nebuchadnezzar God let
[29:26] him wander around for seven years years
[29:29] like a beast like a brother Ram said a
[29:32] no-brain animal like a no wit animal uh
[29:36] he had feathers like eagles and eating
[29:39] the grass like an oxen for seven years
[29:41] until he finally God let us get his mind
[29:43] back and realize who was really great
[29:46] who really gave them power who really
[29:48] gave him money and authority and all
[29:49] these things it was God that gave him
[29:51] that Hallelujah now what caused him to
[29:53] get away Pride as
[29:55] well so God had to let his flesh get
[29:57] into such a a spot where he was under so
[29:59] much torment so much uh beastly o
[30:03] overtaken his flesh like a beast so he
[30:06] could finally get his soul saved now
[30:08] that's what I thought was interesting it
[30:09] seemed like he got saved at the end but
[30:10] I don't know for sure because remember
[30:12] he writes that letter All Nations got to
[30:13] worship God the D or the god of Daniel
[30:16] right hallelujah
[30:19] amen so see church this isn't uncommon
[30:22] where God let somebody's flesh get
[30:24] destroyed in O in order to get obedience
[30:26] out of them
[30:30] verse six your gloring is not
[30:34] good so see this prideful think about
[30:37] that they were gloring in that oh thank
[30:39] God our brother's here thank God even
[30:41] though he's living in sin and sleeping
[30:43] with his mother well thank god he's here
[30:44] thank God for God's grace that he's here
[30:47] how is that even possible how could
[30:49] people glory in that see they they care
[30:52] more about church attendance than about
[30:53] obeying the word of God or public
[30:56] recognition they care about more than
[30:58] public recognition than getting sin out
[31:00] of our
[31:02] lives and you're going to see this was
[31:05] the church better with that sinner in
[31:07] the church or out the sinner out of the
[31:08] church which one out they were better
[31:11] Glory they were an unleavened church
[31:14] with that man out of the church they're
[31:15] a they're a new church they're a better
[31:17] Church
[31:18] Hallelujah without that sin that
[31:20] arrogant prideful sin in there they're a
[31:22] better Church they were like a brand new
[31:24] church if that person just didn't come
[31:25] to
[31:26] church right
[31:28] this is what he says don't you know a
[31:31] little leaven leavens the whole
[31:35] lump so because that man was in sexual
[31:38] sin
[31:39] Pride it affected the others because
[31:42] they didn't do anything about it they
[31:43] didn't get it out of the house they
[31:44] didn't get it out of the church the
[31:46] church is the house of
[31:48] God see pride against God and the propit
[31:52] of God is not
[31:55] good A little leaven leavens the whole
[31:57] church your sin affects the entire
[32:01] church and the church said remember
[32:04] brother McBride preached on secret sins
[32:06] ACH and secret sin I think it was 16 men
[32:08] died if I'm not mistaken 16 men died
[32:11] because of his secret sin in 1
[32:13] Corinthians 11:30 Paul said even in this
[32:15] church they had people dying many were
[32:17] weak and sickly and many sleep because
[32:20] they didn't discern the Lord's body they
[32:21] didn't treat each other the right
[32:24] way so we got to remember that when
[32:26] people get weak sickly or die sometimes
[32:27] s it's because they don't discern the
[32:29] body of Jesus Christ that's right and
[32:33] think about this this church had them
[32:34] dropping it said many where's brother so
[32:36] and so where's sister so and so they're
[32:37] sick well I wonder is our life right
[32:39] with God do we ever ask
[32:41] that
[32:42] Hallelujah is that what the Bible
[32:45] says see secret sin is such a is such a
[32:49] a a trap remember the Bible says they
[32:53] get taken into the I was going to preach
[32:54] on I had a thought on this on Sunday
[32:56] about just preaching on the snares of
[32:57] the enemy the Bible said they get
[32:59] trapped in Satan's snares at Satan's
[33:01] will so that means the person gives into
[33:04] Satan's will they want to do Satan's
[33:06] will instead of God's
[33:08] Will and then he said pre-venture they
[33:10] have to acknowledge their sin in order
[33:13] to get out of that snare but if they
[33:14] don't acknowledge their sin they're
[33:15] going to stay in that trap like a
[33:17] trapped mouse in a mouse trap because
[33:20] that's what we have at our
[33:22] house right how many m m have I seen
[33:25] that mouse trap the glue glue trap
[33:28] now now we use glue
[33:31] traps and yet that's what happens when
[33:34] people are exalted in Pride and they
[33:36] won't confess their sins and this church
[33:38] in Chan Church they were gloring in it
[33:40] oh praise God the brother's here
[33:41] hallelujah thank god oh he's all right
[33:44] at least he's coming to church at least
[33:45] he's got a chance to repent no he knows
[33:47] he should have repented a long time
[33:48] ago and don't eat with that man kick him
[33:51] out of the church because you tried once
[33:53] you tried it again okay now he's
[33:56] out right
[33:58] verse 7 Purge out therefore the old
[34:00] leaven so now he tells them you got to
[34:02] purge it out that ye may be a new lump a
[34:05] new
[34:07] church as ye are unleavened now look at
[34:09] this Paul's speaking by faith you are
[34:12] unleavened in one way what by the blood
[34:15] of
[34:15] Christ by the blood of Christ when
[34:17] everyone's living right we are an
[34:19] unleavened Church no sin among us then
[34:22] then Jesus said then ask what you will
[34:25] right he said abide in me my words abide
[34:28] in you and then ask what you will and
[34:29] see if I won't do
[34:31] it
[34:35] Hallelujah he said so he's speaking by
[34:37] by faith and also by the eyes of Grace
[34:39] you're unleavened but you got some
[34:40] little leaven in there for even Christ
[34:43] Our Passover is sacrificed for
[34:48] us hallelujah now remember there was all
[34:51] types of 11 I got that uh list I I
[34:54] shared with you there was all types of
[34:55] 11 I'm going to give you the verses
[34:56] today herod's leav the leav of Herod
[34:59] mark 8:15 was worldliness and
[35:03] sensuality some people so have S such a
[35:06] a a lure to the world they're always
[35:08] into movies or worldly music or porn as
[35:13] we talked about all these things that's
[35:15] that's a leav that's a
[35:17] sin and people are attracted to that
[35:19] like Herod was attracted to that right
[35:22] people those aren't the only ones right
[35:25] there there's everybody falls under one
[35:26] of these the Sadducees was leav of the
[35:28] Sadducees in Matthew 16:6 it was false
[35:31] Doctrine they denied the Supernatural
[35:33] and the afterlife and Angels they denied
[35:34] that so was just all about right here
[35:36] right
[35:37] now right denying the the supernatural
[35:40] things of God days of Miracles passed
[35:44] right the leaven of the Pharisees mark
[35:46] 8:15 as well was hypocrisy now how many
[35:49] message people do we have like that or
[35:51] just churches in general they say one
[35:54] thing but they do something else oh I'm
[35:56] living right right with with God I'm
[35:58] right with God and they're not living
[35:59] right with God because God knows their
[36:02] life Hypocrites right uh what they they
[36:06] try to put on a public front church we
[36:08] all know that people come to church act
[36:09] like everything's okay nothing's okay
[36:12] that's the Le of the
[36:14] Pharisees that's
[36:19] hypocrisy now the Le in the Church of
[36:21] Corinth was sexual immorality or
[36:24] carnality we just read that being
[36:26] prideful about sex ual sin puffed up
[36:29] prideful this the leav of galatian now
[36:32] doesn't say Le but we know all sin is
[36:35] leav was legalism about circumcision and
[36:37] bringing in the law of Moses and
[36:40] requiring things that were not in the
[36:42] Bible Galatians 2:4 Galatians 3:1 he
[36:45] said they were
[36:47] Bewitched right so taken over with an
[36:49] evil spirit an evil spirit had seduce
[36:52] them into adopting a a a legalistic
[36:56] false Doctrine
[36:58] well isn't that the same then being
[36:59] seduced by sexy women right with this
[37:01] guy or seduced by his mother-in-law
[37:04] somehow
[37:06] mother-in-law I'm sorry stepmom
[37:10] stepmom Ephesus I couldn't find much Le
[37:12] in there which is good thing they're the
[37:14] Ephesian church right the mature Church
[37:17] the Colossians they battled mysticism
[37:20] and will worship so just worshiping
[37:22] however your will instead of God's will
[37:23] that's in Colossians 2:18 so now get
[37:26] into a little too far Supernatural Well
[37:28] an angel visit me how many preachers
[37:30] today say angel visit me angel visit me
[37:32] and what they say is not in the word of
[37:33] God or for some other person at a
[37:35] different time that's
[37:38] le le if that doesn't get stopped it's
[37:40] going to spread through the whole
[37:42] church well then everybody becomes a
[37:44] prophet everybody everybody meets an
[37:46] angel everybody has a prophetic dream
[37:48] everybody has prophetic this prophetic
[37:49] that prophetic that and watch if it
[37:51] comes to pass Hallelujah in Philippi
[37:55] they had division as well remember he
[37:57] said he listed two women in Philippians
[38:00] uh 2:4 it was Y udias and ctii or
[38:03] something like that Philippians
[38:06] 4:2 and then they had sorry then they
[38:09] had an anxiety pardon
[38:15] me so they had women that were divided
[38:17] women arguing fussing the church and
[38:20] they got anxiety Paul says be careful
[38:21] for nothing don't worry about it so they
[38:23] battled the spirit of
[38:25] fear anxieties
[38:27] the Thessalonians had lots of things but
[38:30] their main thing was lazy men and
[38:33] gossipers that's in 2 Corinthians 3 I'm
[38:36] sorry 2 Thessalonians 310 11 and 12 Paul
[38:39] said if the man don't work he doesn't
[38:42] eat he said there're a bunch of busy
[38:44] bodies going from house to house of the
[38:46] church members spreading lies now I've
[38:48] heard a modern day example that let me
[38:50] tell you that uh a pastor had died and
[38:52] so they're trying to vote on the next
[38:54] pastor and so all these people in the
[38:56] church that wanted a certain certain
[38:57] Pastor went from house to house like a
[38:59] bunch of politicians instead of praying
[39:02] on it and letting God do it they tried
[39:04] to do it and now that church is even
[39:06] split because they got the pastor they
[39:08] wanted because of their politics and now
[39:09] it's split because uh the pastor did
[39:12] some false
[39:13] Doctrine so what good did that do a
[39:15] whole lot of
[39:21] nothing we just need mature people is
[39:23] what we need we need mature people who
[39:24] have the Holy Ghost that's what we need
[39:29] now I'm going to look go back to 1
[39:31] Corinthians 5:7 for even Christ Our
[39:34] Passover is sacrificed for
[39:38] us so now Paul brings this
[39:41] thought get the leaven out because it's
[39:44] we're in the Passover how many remember
[39:46] the Passover in Exodus 12 the death
[39:50] Angels come into every house it's G to
[39:52] pass it will pass over if you've got the
[39:55] blood of the lamb but it if you got Le
[39:58] in your house you'll
[40:00] die so what does it mean we can't let
[40:02] sin get in our life we can't be addicted
[40:04] to sin and have unconfessed sin because
[40:06] the death angel could strike right there
[40:08] could destroy the flesh right that the
[40:10] soul might be
[40:11] saved hallelujah look at that it's a
[40:14] beautiful type you got to get the leav
[40:17] out you had to get all the leav out
[40:18] before the Passover the lamb started
[40:21] getting uh examined on the 10th day it
[40:23] was killed on the 14th day just like
[40:25] Jesus was examined when he come in on on
[40:27] uh
[40:29] uh uh what was the uh Palm Sunday Palm
[40:32] Sunday four days later he's
[40:34] killed same thing 10th day 14th day same
[40:38] exact thing amen Rose three days later
[40:40] on the 16th day Hallelujah the Feast of
[40:43] first fruits Hallelujah he Rose thank
[40:46] God so Paul said get the leav out of
[40:49] your church because you're in a
[40:50] spiritual
[40:52] Passover now how did you uh get the the
[40:55] Passover the token
[40:58] the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so
[41:01] clearly this man sleeping with his
[41:02] stepmom did not have the token because
[41:05] he said death is going to pass over him
[41:07] and if he doesn't repent he's going to
[41:09] be killed that his soul might be
[41:11] saved see the blood was publicly applied
[41:15] and that allowed the death angel to pass
[41:17] over their houses see we got to have the
[41:18] Holy Ghost in our homes as well
[41:21] Hallelujah got to keep our homes clean
[41:23] do everything we can do to keep sin out
[41:24] of our homes H Allelujah
[41:28] so see by God's grace if we have the
[41:29] Holy Ghost death has passed over us we
[41:32] pass from Death unto life
[41:35] Hallelujah and we live because he lives
[41:38] also
[41:39] Hallelujah now in the natural I love
[41:41] brother Brooks's sermon he called it the
[41:42] mighty lamb the lamb the mighty Lambs
[41:44] those little lambs delivered two million
[41:47] people from
[41:48] slavery God gave them deliverance and
[41:52] also
[41:53] Freedom naturally
[41:55] speaking but because Jesus Christ The
[41:58] Mighty lamb gave his life he gave his
[42:01] life for an innumerable multitudes of
[42:03] Believers not just two million but so
[42:05] many like the stars of the heaven
[42:07] Abraham seed that cannot be numbered
[42:09] amen oh Hallelujah one lamb Jesus Christ
[42:13] took all of our sin on him that we might
[42:15] be unleavened that we might be saved
[42:18] Hallelujah and he made us free and he
[42:20] delivered us so why should we be in
[42:22] bondage to sin when the lamb has made us
[42:24] free hallelujah amen just got to get the
[42:27] lamb out I'm sorry the leav out
[42:28] Hallelujah you got to get the lamb in
[42:30] and get the leaven
[42:31] out pardon
[42:36] me and this Mighty lamb delivered us
[42:38] from sin
[42:40] slavery and eternal judgment not eternal
[42:44] hell Eternal judgment the Judgment would
[42:46] last eternally the person would be
[42:48] annihilated the soul would be
[42:49] annihilated but the Judgment the
[42:51] sentence would last eternally eternally
[42:53] separated from God
[42:57] so what is it true what does it say
[42:58] Church Christ is our Passover what was
[43:00] the Passover it was the meal they had to
[43:02] eat the meal they had to get all the
[43:03] leaven out they had to eat in haste the
[43:07] bread was just Ms of bread it was just
[43:08] like this hard bread like we eat it we
[43:11] didn't have time to let that rise we're
[43:14] we're in The Exodus the death Angel's
[43:17] coming the leaven got to be out Christ
[43:20] is our Passover meal and the the cross
[43:22] of Jesus Christ was our Passover meal
[43:25] Hallelujah you must eat my body
[43:27] Hallelujah take this body which was
[43:29] broken for you Hallelujah that's the
[43:32] communion and we take the word of God we
[43:34] take the word Hallelujah in Jesus cross
[43:37] is our spiritual Passover Hallelujah he
[43:40] died for me amen he died to take away
[43:42] all my sins he took my sin that I might
[43:45] have his righteousness
[43:47] amen Christ is our Passover Christ is
[43:50] our UNL
[43:52] bread what was leaven I'm sorry what was
[43:54] unleavened Feast it was removing the
[43:56] leaven what was the unleavened bread in
[43:58] the spiritual Jesus tomb was
[44:01] unleavened there was no sin in that
[44:03] house amen or you can say Jesus body was
[44:05] the was the house there's no sin in that
[44:08] body amen hallelujah so we had death of
[44:11] a lamb no sin and if we follow all these
[44:14] things we're going to get the fir the
[44:16] Feast of f first fruit sorry we're going
[44:18] to get a resurrection Hallelujah if we
[44:20] can have the Passover Lamb if we can
[44:22] have all these things no leaven surely
[44:24] we'll get the Feast of first fruits
[44:26] we'll get the resur rection Hallelujah
[44:28] Jesus said because I live ye shall live
[44:30] also amen Christ is our Pentecost our
[44:34] Feast of
[44:35] Weeks Hallelujah 50 days later Christ is
[44:39] our trumpet and I'll say our last Trump
[44:42] because the last Trump shall sound and
[44:44] the dead in Christ shall rise first our
[44:45] bodies will be changed in a moment and
[44:47] the twinkling of an eye now the last
[44:49] Trump for Israel of course I'm sorry the
[44:51] Trump for Israel the Feast of the
[44:52] trumpets is the two witnesses of Israel
[44:55] now I found out today too this is pretty
[44:56] awesome too
[44:58] I watched a Jewish I was listening to a
[44:59] Jewish man I didn't watch him I was
[45:00] listening to a Jewish man talk about the
[45:01] modern day Passover and they said at the
[45:04] very end of the Passover there's a knock
[45:06] on the door and it opens up and one of
[45:08] the children pretend to be
[45:10] Elijah and then Elijah announces the
[45:12] Messiah is
[45:14] coming hallelujah amen a't that like
[45:17] Moses and Elijah amen Moses and Elijah
[45:19] in a minister for three and a half years
[45:20] and then they're going to say we're
[45:21] going to die but Messiah is coming Jesus
[45:24] is coming hallelujah oh my Hallelujah
[45:27] glory to God think about that Elijah is
[45:29] still in the modern Jews Passover Elijah
[45:32] is connected to the second coming of
[45:34] Jesus Christ hallelujah oh my just like
[45:38] on uh just like on Mount Transfiguration
[45:40] Moses Elijah Christ Moses represents the
[45:43] dead in Christ Elijah represents the
[45:45] saints that don't have to die
[45:46] Hallelujah but then Elijah that then
[45:48] that's typed also those two also go to
[45:51] the 144,000 and Elijah is already
[45:53] recognized in their in modern day Jewish
[45:55] houses oh it's Elijah he's going to
[45:57] bring in the Messiah because of Malachi
[45:59] 45 and6 hallelujah
[46:04] amen Christ is our holy day our day of
[46:07] atonement right Christ will make us holy
[46:10] on one day when we get a body change
[46:12] Hallelujah the day of atonement for
[46:14] Israel is 144,000 get in the baptism of
[46:16] the Holy Ghost and Christ is our Feast
[46:19] of Tabernacles Tabernacles was dwelling
[46:21] in booths right so what's what's our
[46:24] Feast of Tabernacles it's the millennial
[46:27] Hallelujah the honeymoon with Christ and
[46:29] his wife Hallelujah I taught this week
[46:32] at middle school Bible Club on uh The
[46:34] Book of Revelation and afterwards this
[46:36] little H Fifth Fifth Grader comes up and
[46:38] said Mr Smith she said I never
[46:40] understood this how can men be part of
[46:43] the bride of Christ because uh they're
[46:45] men and how can they be a woman married
[46:47] to Jesus how can a man be married to a
[46:49] man I said that's a very spiritual
[46:50] question little
[46:52] one and I said it's not natural it's a
[46:55] spiritual thing I said Christ is the
[46:57] head and all men and women who love
[46:59] Jesus are submitted to his spirit in the
[47:02] spiritual I said it's not a physical
[47:04] love it's a spiritual love how many love
[47:07] Jesus with all your heart amen
[47:09] hallelujah that's a good question that's
[47:11] a very spiritual question there well she
[47:13] goes to church a lot so that's part of
[47:14] the reason why I've known her family for
[47:16] years in fact her Grandpa asked me to
[47:18] preach in May so I can't do it now I got
[47:20] to let them know they're having a men's
[47:21] conference in May we got Lord willing
[47:23] got the baby coming so won't be able to
[47:25] do that want to preach at his men's
[47:28] meetings there in
[47:30] akan Hallelujah so Paul says get that
[47:34] sinner out of the church now you're
[47:37] going to see what he says at the end
[47:38] chapter about this guy he calls him
[47:40] brother at the beginning wait till you
[47:41] see what he calls him at the end some of
[47:43] you looking ahead in your Bible verse
[47:46] eight therefore let us keep the feast
[47:48] what we're supposed to keep a Passover
[47:51] yes keep the sin out of your
[47:54] life if not it's going to impact other
[47:56] people in the
[47:58] church like I've seen that you know some
[48:00] of the sin that goes that I find about
[48:02] our church you know if it's not
[48:03] confessed or people don't confess it it
[48:05] keeps me up it worries me I find myself
[48:08] struggling because other people
[48:10] sins right and the same is true if I'm
[48:13] struggling that can affect other people
[48:14] too we must all get the leaven out of
[48:16] our Lives
[48:18] Hallelujah A little leaven leavens the
[48:20] whole
[48:22] church so we should keep the Feast of
[48:25] Passover what the Death Angel has to
[48:27] pass over by the blood of the Lamb I'm
[48:29] not going to be killed by Satan I'm
[48:31] going to overcome because I've got the
[48:32] blood of the Lamb he can't touch me I'm
[48:34] covered by the blood amen I'm covered
[48:37] covered covered by the blood
[48:38] Hallelujah walking by faith living in
[48:41] love hallelujah amen see don't keep the
[48:44] feast with old leaven neither with a
[48:46] leaven of malice and wickedness so now
[48:48] he gets into this malice and wickedness
[48:51] that was part of the divisions in the
[48:52] church in the first four chapters this
[48:55] is sexual immorality in chapter 5 but
[48:58] see it's a whole it's the leav is is
[49:02] representative of the all the sin in the
[49:03] church not just sexual sin there's
[49:05] malice well I'm a Paul I'm of apos right
[49:09] there's wickedness in the church now
[49:11] wickedness yes is the sexual sin because
[49:12] he names it at the end of the chapter
[49:14] but with the unleavened bread of
[49:16] sincerity and truth so see we keep the
[49:18] feast and we remember we're not slaves
[49:21] to sin amen I'm not a slave to Egypt
[49:25] amen I'm living in the promise land
[49:27] church amen hallelujah I'm not a slave
[49:29] amen he can't keep me slave because the
[49:32] lamb Set Me Free
[49:33] Hallelujah I've done going through the
[49:35] Red Sea I've been baptized Hallelujah I
[49:38] was there when it happened amen I went
[49:40] through the wildness of sanctification
[49:41] and I crossed over Jordan I was
[49:43] circumcised I've had a permanent
[49:45] relationship with Jesus Christ it I was
[49:47] there when it happened I ought to know
[49:49] praise God
[49:52] hallelujah see we got to get the slaves
[49:56] out of the the
[49:57] church or at least get them to repent so
[49:59] they're stop being a slaved to
[50:02] sin that's why church if you know
[50:04] somebody sin you got to pray you got to
[50:05] go to that
[50:07] person call them text them do something
[50:09] try to talk to them in church do
[50:11] whatever you can do you got to get the
[50:13] sin out of the church and the church
[50:15] said if not we become an old lump not
[50:19] ready to leave not ready for the Rapture
[50:20] not ready for an
[50:22] exodus neither with the leaven of mouse
[50:24] and wickedness but with the unleavened
[50:27] of sincerity and Truth this proves those
[50:30] that are addicted to sin or prideful and
[50:32] won't repent they're insincere and
[50:34] they're Liars they're lying to God like
[50:37] everything's okay they're lying to the
[50:38] people it's okay no that's
[50:41] leaven right insincere not real worship
[50:45] God's not receiving their worship like I
[50:47] said if they have sin God don't want
[50:49] your praise God don't want your songs
[50:50] God don't want your collapse although
[50:52] some people don't even want to give it
[50:54] right when they're living in sin you
[50:55] know what I'm talking about right
[50:57] everybody's gone everybody's gone
[50:58] through that you don't feel like
[50:59] praising God because you're stuck or
[51:00] you're in a struggle we all go through
[51:03] that he said but this approves if you're
[51:06] addicted to sin or won't confess sin
[51:09] insincere and you're lying to others and
[51:11] lying to God like everything's okay when
[51:14] it's not
[51:18] okay but see church thank God you don't
[51:20] have to stay that
[51:22] way thank God there's a blood hallelujah
[51:25] thank God there's Mercy hallelujah thank
[51:28] God that we have a cleansing process
[51:29] amen he he lists it later in chapter six
[51:32] maybe we read that in just a moment
[51:34] remember Church even brother ramam lied
[51:35] to the IRS what was that leaven and he
[51:36] said brother ramam said I already saw
[51:38] that spread to my Joseph and Joseph said
[51:40] daddy do you want me to tell him you're
[51:42] not here the leaven had already spread
[51:44] to his
[51:45] son see when our family sees our sin or
[51:48] our spouse or husband or children it
[51:50] spreads to other people in the family
[51:52] that's we got to confess our sins we
[51:54] have to live sincere tell the truth we
[51:58] have to be sincere we got to get the
[51:59] leaven out of our Lives
[52:03] Hallelujah I told Brother Brian I said
[52:05] that was perfect brother you mentioned
[52:06] the leav you mentioned the division for
[52:09] preachers I said this perfect Abraham
[52:12] lied twice so did Isaac Leven pass down
[52:16] to his family see church sometimes
[52:18] you'll struggle with the same things
[52:19] your parents struggle
[52:21] with right like I I told Malachi this I
[52:24] said why do I why do we Str why do men
[52:26] sometimes struggle with the the lust of
[52:28] the eyes or even pride of life because
[52:29] our dads did and our grandfathers did
[52:34] why would women maybe struggle with a
[52:35] dominating female spirit because their
[52:37] moms did their grandmas
[52:39] did and the church
[52:41] said
[52:43] Hallelujah right you see that you're
[52:45] around that that impacts you and even
[52:47] genetically somehow it's it's in a
[52:50] somehow
[52:53] right so we got to keep sincere and
[52:57] we've got to tell the truth oh it's
[52:59] almost 8:00 my goodness why do I always
[53:02] think I'm not going to preach very long
[53:03] and then I always preach long I always
[53:04] feel like my notes are really shallow or
[53:06] or or small but it always turns out like
[53:08] they're I got enough verse nine I wrote
[53:11] unto you an epistle not to company with
[53:12] fornicator so see that was actually the
[53:14] first letter to the Corinthians but we
[53:15] don't have it it's lost now devil come
[53:17] around and say oh look I found the
[53:19] letter to the First Corinthians and
[53:20] it'll have some false doctrines in it
[53:23] that's the devil right if it goes
[53:25] against anything else Paul said anywhere
[53:26] else or any other man of God so Paul had
[53:29] already told them before don't company
[53:32] with fornicators verse 10 yet not
[53:35] altogether with the fornicators of this
[53:36] world or with the
[53:38] Covetous so sexual fornication or people
[53:42] Covetous for money or fame or popularity
[53:44] or whatever it may be Goods worldly
[53:46] Goods houses lands cars all these things
[53:49] today don't even fellowship with them
[53:53] now there's times you got to be around
[53:54] them or extortioners extortioners are
[53:56] are robbers they rob people of
[53:59] money or with idolators any Idol in
[54:02] their life let they lift up they they
[54:05] they respect this more than they respect
[54:07] God for then must you needs go out of
[54:10] the world so Paul said to avoid all
[54:11] these people you just have to go to
[54:12] heaven that's the only way you can avoid
[54:13] these people
[54:16] totally so you cannot Escape Sinners so
[54:19] Paul adds the next verse verse 11 but
[54:22] don't forget evil company corrupts good
[54:24] manners
[54:26] you find a person addicted to sin or a
[54:28] person that won't repent and pride look
[54:30] who they're hanging around probably
[54:31] somebody else who's got the same
[54:34] problem 1 Corinthians 15:33 says be not
[54:37] deceived evil Communications or
[54:40] associations corrupt good manners if you
[54:44] hang around the right people the pure
[54:45] people you'll stay pure you hang around
[54:48] backsliders or lukewarm people you'll
[54:49] get lukewarm and
[54:51] backslide that's why I tell Malachi
[54:53] lytica you don't hang around with these
[54:55] teenagers unless they're serving God cuz
[54:57] they're going to pull you
[54:59] down that's right they're going to pull
[55:03] you
[55:04] down that's why I don't hang around with
[55:06] people like that and I believe I got the
[55:08] Holy Ghost because I experience every
[55:10] time I go get a haircut even though I
[55:11] got a haircut Saturday I would reach my
[55:13] hand out in the name of Jesus Christ let
[55:14] me keep their pure attitude because it's
[55:16] just a it's a it's a spirit it's an
[55:18] atmosphere and I've got to be careful
[55:20] for 25 minutes to get a haircut not to
[55:22] lose the anointing not to bring reproach
[55:25] upon the love name of Jesus Christ not
[55:28] to get leaven in my in my life because
[55:31] they joke and they they talk all these
[55:32] things always got to bring it back to
[55:34] Jesus and he even even my Barb got me a
[55:37] nice little gift he said to my good
[55:39] brother he said to a good friend but
[55:41] also my brother in Christ I said thank
[55:43] you yes sir by God's
[55:46] grace he's asking me do you tell your
[55:48] kids about Santa Claus no I don't lie to
[55:50] my
[55:51] kids that was the end of that
[55:53] conversation but it's all it's all good
[55:55] it was very respectful very respectful
[55:58] see evil communication corrupt good
[56:00] manners so Paul said you know if you
[56:02] want to get away from it you just have
[56:04] to go to heaven you have to die and go
[56:05] to heaven he' already told you not to
[56:08] accompany with fornicators of people are
[56:09] in sexual sin don't be with them don't
[56:12] spend time with him verse uh Now 1
[56:14] Corinthians 15:34 awake to righteousness
[56:16] so that proves people hanging around
[56:18] sinful people are spiritually
[56:21] asleep they're they have slumber they
[56:23] don't even see what's going on they're
[56:24] missing the move of the Holy Ghost when
[56:26] you're hanging around the wrong people
[56:28] I'm talking about people that won't
[56:29] repent of their sins people addicted to
[56:31] sin that's what I'm talking about
[56:33] they're asleep they don't even see the
[56:35] spirit of God like when Brian preaches
[56:36] or whoever Simon when something's
[56:38] preaching into our lives if if if if we
[56:41] leave and we we stay with the same
[56:43] condition we were spiritually asleep and
[56:45] missed the whole thing although we could
[56:46] have been saying Amen to every
[56:48] word that's
[56:50] right hallelujah it's 11 awake to
[56:53] righteousness and sin not for some have
[56:55] not the knowledge of God I speak this to
[56:58] your shame he says in other words be
[57:00] very careful who you hang around
[57:03] with better be very careful who starts
[57:05] talking to you about the things of God
[57:06] better be very careful that you know
[57:09] that person can quickly drag you down in
[57:10] the spot you don't want to
[57:12] be right so you got to cut it off or
[57:14] raise them up and say no no no here's
[57:16] what I believe change the subject get
[57:18] things on get conversation on the word
[57:20] of God because remember there's power in
[57:22] your
[57:23] thoughts remember you got an alabaster
[57:25] box
[57:27] Hallelujah that's right Church
[57:29] Hallelujah verse 11 I'm almost
[57:33] done busy body but now I have written
[57:36] unto you not to keep company so now so
[57:38] before I said don't fellowship with
[57:39] fornicators but now do not keep company
[57:43] if a any man that's called a brother be
[57:45] a fornicator or Covetous so any Covetous
[57:49] brother who's Covetous over worldly
[57:52] Goods or brother who's an idolator or
[57:55] sister who's a now here's what I
[57:57] told you in our in my experience as a
[57:59] pastor the most Spirits I've struggled
[58:01] with and battled is critical Spirits
[58:03] that's what reviler is a is a
[58:06] is a reviler reviler means
[58:08] criticize in an angry way that's the
[58:11] spirit I've dealt with the most as a
[58:14] pastor I'm going to keep doing it when
[58:15] people when I when I feel that Spirit
[58:17] I'm going to walk to their chair and I'm
[58:18] going to rebuke that Spirit In Jesus
[58:20] Christ's name now I'm also thankful we
[58:23] don't have you know the lustful Spirits
[58:24] I'm very thankful for that very thankful
[58:26] thank hallelujah thank God you know no
[58:28] sexual sin as far as I know I'm thankful
[58:29] for that but see we all got to battle
[58:32] something praise God we all got to
[58:34] overcome we got to overcome by the blood
[58:36] of the Lamb
[58:38] Hallelujah he says don't eat with a
[58:40] idolor a a crit a Critic a
[58:43] drunker he puts all these people on the
[58:45] same level so someone that looks like
[58:48] they're living holy and they're critical
[58:49] or someone that looks like they're
[58:50] living holy drunk sleeping around a
[58:53] secret or have Idols in their life
[58:54] especially money usually money in
[58:55] America America all about the
[58:58] money don't even eat with that person if
[59:01] they won't repent of that now see if you
[59:04] got to if they see sin though you got to
[59:05] do something about it you have to do it
[59:07] doesn't have to be the pastor all the
[59:08] time it can be
[59:09] you right that's what Jesus said in
[59:12] Matthew 18 is anybody anybody if you see
[59:14] somebody in sin you go to
[59:17] them or an extortioner extortioner again
[59:20] is robber so any unconfessed robbery
[59:23] drunkenness crit critics Idol Idols
[59:26] Covetous fornicators don't even eat with
[59:29] them now thankfully I can say this I've
[59:30] told you this before I said thankfully
[59:32] the people that were in this situation
[59:33] in most cases they separate from us
[59:35] before we have to do anything and I
[59:37] thank God for that I thank God for
[59:40] that one in particular was a man living
[59:42] in fornication and I and I talked to him
[59:45] right outside that door and I said now
[59:46] brother I said if if you need lunch I
[59:48] said we we can't eat with you you got to
[59:50] take it home with you he said oh no
[59:51] we're going home for lunch and then I'd
[59:53] never seen him again or never seen him
[59:55] since but I told him that I said right
[59:57] out side of that door I said well but
[59:58] you know you right by the car on the
[1:00:00] other side of the
[1:00:02] car see we can't do that we can't we
[1:00:05] can't uh let leaven into our midst we
[1:00:09] got to live
[1:00:10] holy you know why because God is Holy
[1:00:13] and he said be holy for I'm
[1:00:16] holy so I thank God God has kept us away
[1:00:19] from these
[1:00:21] people verse 12 for what have I to do to
[1:00:24] judge them also that are without the
[1:00:26] church he's like what do I have to do
[1:00:27] with them I don't have nothing to do
[1:00:28] with these people outside the church do
[1:00:30] not ye judge them that are within don't
[1:00:33] you're supposed to judge the people
[1:00:34] within the church oh don't judge me
[1:00:36] brother Jess don't judge me sister
[1:00:38] that's what we're supposed to do we're
[1:00:41] supposed to say are we living good lives
[1:00:42] or not are we living true to Christ or
[1:00:44] not did we let a little leaven get into
[1:00:47] our
[1:00:48] midst and it's every person's
[1:00:51] responsibility to go to the person right
[1:00:54] each one of us
[1:00:57] verse
[1:00:58] 13 for them that are without the church
[1:01:02] God will judge
[1:01:05] them but guess what we find out in
[1:01:07] chapter six God made us the judges on
[1:01:09] earth
[1:01:10] now he said don't you know the Saints
[1:01:12] will judge
[1:01:14] angels and how can you judge Angels if
[1:01:16] you can't judge these matters right in
[1:01:18] the
[1:01:18] church I've been thankful over the years
[1:01:20] like I told you one time I think I
[1:01:21] counted six times mostly critical
[1:01:23] spirits but all these times the spirits
[1:01:25] have attacked me and when I have shared
[1:01:27] that with others not naming names but
[1:01:29] when I've shared the details of that
[1:01:30] almost every person I've shared it with
[1:01:32] they could judge it the way I did isn't
[1:01:35] that
[1:01:36] interesting every the majority of the
[1:01:38] Christians can all look at a situation
[1:01:40] and the majority that have pure hearts
[1:01:41] can all judge the same oh yeah I I would
[1:01:43] judge that the same way but the person
[1:01:45] with the evil spirit they think they're
[1:01:49] right and it's like a the majority of
[1:01:51] saints if it's a true church will all
[1:01:53] judge the same situation the right way
[1:01:55] and the person with Le their life will
[1:01:57] judge it the wrong
[1:01:59] way
[1:02:02] Hallelujah I've had people tell me like
[1:02:04] brother just really that actually
[1:02:05] happened to you someone told you that
[1:02:07] about money or ties or somebody
[1:02:08] criticize you for yes
[1:02:10] yes that's my battle apparently
[1:02:14] overcoming critical Spirits right but
[1:02:16] what was Corinth sexual sin divisions
[1:02:20] amongst preachers the rich thinking
[1:02:22] they're better than the poor drunkenness
[1:02:24] at the Lord's table
[1:02:27] all kinds of people suing each
[1:02:30] other how much money did you want Mercy
[1:02:32] goodness
[1:02:34] like this is the this was the leaven in
[1:02:36] the
[1:02:37] church and yet Paul says you're saved
[1:02:41] you're without leaven see he's speaking
[1:02:43] by spiritual right he's speaking by fore
[1:02:45] knowledge right all the elect are
[1:02:47] unleavened
[1:02:50] Hallelujah now look how look how he ends
[1:02:52] this now in in the beginning of the
[1:02:54] chapter he called him a brother who
[1:02:55] who's sleeping with his stepmother but
[1:02:58] what do he calm at the
[1:03:00] end but them that are without God judges
[1:03:03] therefore put away from among yourselves
[1:03:05] that Wicked
[1:03:08] person oh brother Wicked nice to see you
[1:03:11] today in church sister Wicked thank you
[1:03:13] so much for coming today uh you got to
[1:03:16] leave
[1:03:18] actually Hallelujah this is a sexual
[1:03:22] sinner sexual sinner Paul says yeah
[1:03:25] they're a brother but they're live He's
[1:03:27] look he's judging them by their
[1:03:30] fruits see we can't sugarcoat well oh
[1:03:33] you're just such a sweet person if
[1:03:34] you're living wickedly let's call it
[1:03:36] Wicked you're in a wicked
[1:03:39] condition
[1:03:41] hallelujah what was he bringing he's
[1:03:43] bringing a rod of Correction this is the
[1:03:44] harshest judgment we see I I maybe I
[1:03:47] shouldn't say that it's one of the
[1:03:48] harshest the harshest might be ananas
[1:03:50] and
[1:03:52] Safa where they got one chance to say
[1:03:54] the truth and when they Li
[1:03:56] they die that might be the
[1:03:59] harshest but look how Paul brings a rod
[1:04:03] of
[1:04:04] Correction now he's called wicked so
[1:04:06] he's a wicked brother he's a wicked
[1:04:08] message believer
[1:04:12] brother but this is not a final judgment
[1:04:15] thank God there is a book of second
[1:04:20] Corinthians but this here is a judgment
[1:04:23] this is Paul's judgment on the corrupt
[1:04:25] fruits of a message believer a book of
[1:04:29] Acts
[1:04:32] believer so in closing I just want to
[1:04:34] say this church this chapter gives us
[1:04:37] such wisdom and understanding and as we
[1:04:40] heard this weekend if our worship is not
[1:04:44] giving God our
[1:04:46] all it's time to get the leaven
[1:04:51] out if we're if we're standing here in a
[1:04:53] church sometimes criticizing people why
[1:04:55] does he wor like that why does she
[1:04:56] worship like that then we've got the
[1:04:58] evil spirit on us if we don't want to
[1:05:00] give God praise if we don't got the joy
[1:05:02] of the Lord something's wrong with us
[1:05:05] hallelujah we just heard it this weekend
[1:05:09] where's my
[1:05:10] notes I couldn't believe I was like oh
[1:05:13] my goodness he's preaching on all these
[1:05:14] things I preach in my murmuring
[1:05:17] gossiping right right here indignation
[1:05:20] anger against people leaven cheating
[1:05:22] cheating god of the worship he desires
[1:05:24] give a a a false sacrifice when the
[1:05:27] sacrifice God wants is a crying
[1:05:28] repentant
[1:05:30] heart tradition see just going to church
[1:05:33] and just going through the motions and
[1:05:34] not getting anything out of
[1:05:37] church sitting in the sea of the
[1:05:39] scornful competition Pride people
[1:05:44] competing and then he said accusers of
[1:05:46] the Brethren so again the critical
[1:05:49] spirit critical Spirits again he said
[1:05:51] disputing arguing competing criticizing
[1:05:54] backbiting then he ends with worshiping
[1:05:57] preachers now I know we don't have that
[1:05:58] here
[1:06:00] hallelujah because none of you worship
[1:06:02] the ground I walk on and you never
[1:06:03] should because it's not Holy Ground I'm
[1:06:06] there's nothing good about me but we
[1:06:09] know it happens with the preachers who
[1:06:10] call themselves the greatest of all time
[1:06:12] but I'm not preaching on that tonight
[1:06:14] our inspiration tonight comes from the
[1:06:17] scripture the Bible said ye are
[1:06:19] unleavened and we must keep the feast
[1:06:22] with sincerity and Truth let's stand to
[1:06:26] our feet here by God's grace musicians

[1:07:01] caught in sin but Jesus can break every
[1:07:04] Fetter with a repentant
[1:07:05] heart I love that verse uh it was I was
[1:07:10] hearing a brother Tim puit preach and
[1:07:11] that's the one from Psalm 51 he used
[1:07:14] that verse what a beautiful verse God
[1:07:16] doesn't want our fake hands raised or
[1:07:18] whatever fake eyes closed singing good
[1:07:21] if we have sin in our life God wants us
[1:07:22] to repent and cry about our sin that's
[1:07:25] what God God
[1:07:27] wants
[1:07:32] Hallelujah Jesus
