[2:03] you would turn the second chronicles
[2:06] of chapter 7.
[2:13] starting in the 14th verse
[2:19] it's one it's all my family I apologize
[2:21] I know you just heard this recently
[2:25] I've preached most of the messages
[2:29] more than once but I've found they don't
[2:34] they're not the same
[2:37] even though it might be the same subject
[2:39] matter they're not they're not they
[2:41] don't turn out to be the same so may the
[2:44] Lord bless us let's see good to see you
[2:46] brother Bank
[2:49] happy belated birthday
[2:53] Second Chronicles chapter 7 and verse 14
[2:55] it says
[2:57] If my people
[2:59] which are called by my name
[3:01] shall humble themselves and pray and
[3:04] seek my face and turn from their Wicked
[3:07] Ways then will I hear from heaven
[3:11] and will forgive their sins
[3:13] and will heal heal their land
[3:17] turn to Psalms chapter 27 and verse 8.
[3:32] it says when thou said seek ye my face
[3:36] is what we just read at the second
[3:37] chronicles 7. you mentioned that in
[3:40] there
[3:41] if you're so humble that if they shall
[3:43] humble themselves and pray and seek my
[3:45] face
[3:46] so when thou said seek ye my face my
[3:50] heart said unto thee thy face Lord will
[3:53] I see
[3:55] in Matthew chapter 18 and verse 20.
[4:05] it says for where two or three are
[4:07] gathered together in my name
[4:10] there are mine in the midst of them
[4:15] most gracious Heavenly Father this again
[4:18] that's with Thanksgiving in our hearts
[4:20] to to have this privilege to come and
[4:22] Minister your word one more time
[4:24] father we pray that you would bless us
[4:26] Service Guard my lips I wouldn't say
[4:28] anything contrary to that word or to the
[4:30] teaching
[4:32] father again we just ask that the people
[4:34] would be blessed
[4:38] help us to go away from here with a
[4:40] a newfound desire to to want to to serve
[4:44] you and to seek your anointing
[4:47] Lord we ask all these things in your
[4:49] precious name of Jesus Christ amen
[4:56] if you would turn to uh
[4:58] Exodus 25
[5:01] in the first verse
[5:15] it says then the Lord spake unto Moses
[5:17] saying speak unto the children of Israel
[5:20] that they bring me an offering of every
[5:22] man that giveth it willingly with his
[5:25] heart you shall take by offering
[5:30] yeah so this is a willful
[5:33] they're talking about he's saying that
[5:35] it's a willful offering something that's
[5:36] not held back but something that uh
[5:39] somebody really wants to give
[5:43] it it's not a it's not a requirement but
[5:46] uh
[5:49] but he's he's asking for the for the
[5:51] people to bring an offering and uh
[5:54] so if every man that giveth it willfully
[5:57] with his heart ye shall take my offering
[6:00] and this is the offering which he shall
[6:02] take of them gold and silver and brass
[6:06] and blue and purple and Scarlet and fine
[6:10] linen and goat's hair and RAM skins died
[6:13] red and Badger skins and them would
[6:19] oil for the light spices for anointing
[6:21] oil and for sweet incense
[6:24] Onyx stones and stones to be set in the
[6:27] ephod and in the breastplate also known
[6:30] as the urmathama
[6:33] so and let them make a let them make me
[6:37] a sanctuary that I may dwell among them
[6:40] according to all that I show thee after
[6:42] the pattern of the Tabernacle and the
[6:45] pattern of all the instruments thereof
[6:47] even so shall you make it if you take
[6:50] note this is the first Tabernacle that's
[6:52] being built so how could he say that
[6:55] after the pattern of the Tabernacle in
[6:59] order for there to be a pattern those
[7:00] that those that might sow things that
[7:03] might have made dresses shirts whatever
[7:06] it might be you have a pattern that you
[7:08] follow after now some people are able to
[7:10] have a vision in their mind and they're
[7:12] able to produce the material just
[7:14] through that Vision just like artists
[7:16] that they're able to paint something
[7:17] just by looking at something and they
[7:19] have that in their memory and they can
[7:21] they can put that thought on paper so
[7:24] for there to be a pattern there has to
[7:26] be something existing already right so
[7:30] uh and so according to all that I show
[7:33] thee after the pattern of the Tabernacle
[7:35] so that there we know that there's an an
[7:38] Earthen Tabernacle but there is also a
[7:40] Heavenly Tabernacle so after that
[7:42] pattern of all the uh of the Tabernacle
[7:45] and the pattern of all the instruments
[7:47] thereof even so shall you make it and
[7:50] then we'll skip down to the 41st verse
[7:52] excuse me Exodus 29 sorry a different
[7:54] chapter Exodus 29 and verse 41.
[8:06] it says and the other lamb Thou shalt
[8:09] offer at even
[8:11] and shalt do there too according to the
[8:13] meat offering of the morning and
[8:15] according to the drink offering thereof
[8:17] for a sweet saver an offering made by
[8:19] fire unto unto the Lord
[8:23] this shall be a continual burnt offering
[8:26] throughout your Generations at the door
[8:28] of the Tabernacle of the congregation
[8:30] before the Lord
[8:33] where I will meet you to speak there
[8:35] unto thee
[8:38] and there I will meet with the children
[8:40] of Israel and the Tabernacle shall be
[8:43] Sanctified by my glory which is also his
[8:45] presence
[8:46] uh verse 44 it says and I will sanctify
[8:50] the Tabernacle of the congregation and
[8:53] the altar I will sanctify also both
[8:56] Aaron and his sons to minister to me and
[8:58] the priest's office
[9:01] and I will dwell among the children of
[9:03] Israel and will be their God
[9:05] and they shall know that I am the Lord
[9:07] their God
[9:09] that brought them forth out of the land
[9:10] of Egypt that I may dwell among them I
[9:13] am the Lord their God
[9:16] amen so you could think of we're not
[9:19] from Egypt I've never been to Egypt has
[9:21] anybody ever been to Egypt
[9:23] I've never been to Egypt so
[9:25] uh you could you could pretty much type
[9:28] Egypt is a type of our struggles our
[9:31] trials our our Temptations the old man
[9:34] Egypt that that's where we've been
[9:36] brought from unto a new creation unto a
[9:39] new land so
[9:42] you could think of it of either way but
[9:45] I've like I said I've never been to the
[9:46] Natural Egypt so
[9:49] either way he's still God right and and
[9:52] I'm still his child so I am his people
[9:55] you are his people so he's speaking to
[9:58] us right
[9:59] so as we read in second Chronicles
[10:03] chapter 7 and verse 14 If my people are
[10:07] you his people
[10:08] amen so if my people which are called by
[10:11] my name whose name are we called by
[10:13] God's name through the Lord Jesus Christ
[10:16] if we so humble ourselves and pray and
[10:19] seek his face and turn from our Wicked
[10:22] Ways then will we hear from heaven right
[10:26] so and he will forgive our sin and he
[10:29] will heal our land now I know brother
[10:31] Branham somebody had asked me the last
[10:35] time I ministered this uh I guess it was
[10:37] last week
[10:39] somebody had asked me well how do you
[10:41] how do you feel about the other other
[10:43] side of that uh have you thought about
[10:45] that on uh in another way
[10:48] about uh healing the land now I know
[10:52] brother Branham mentioned that you know
[10:54] there won't there won't be any more
[10:56] revivals as far as the U.S is concerned
[10:59] because the U.S is the United States
[11:01] they they've turned they've turned their
[11:03] back on God so they've they've rejected
[11:06] him so there's a small Remnant that
[11:08] still served him and that's us uh so if
[11:12] I kind of think of that
[11:13] my answer to him was uh
[11:16] when it where it says that I will heal
[11:18] your land I'm thinking in my body
[11:20] because my body is the Tabernacle and
[11:23] this is the land and where he dwells
[11:25] there is a difference between the Old
[11:27] Testament and the New Testament uh
[11:31] but you know there are some some
[11:33] differences as uh
[11:36] you know it doesn't apply some things
[11:38] don't apply to us because we're not the
[11:40] children of Israel and you know that
[11:42] he's talking to the the uh to Israel and
[11:44] certain things but I still put my name
[11:46] in there I still put it in as a
[11:49] personalized letter to me because it's a
[11:52] history and brother uh brother Branham
[11:54] had taught us about you know uh the
[11:57] representation about George Washington
[11:59] when he went through the things that he
[12:00] did Abraham Lincoln uh the different
[12:02] things that he did we as Americans are
[12:05] identified through that so whether it's
[12:08] New Testament or Old Testament I still
[12:10] believe that I maintain that same
[12:12] representation because Jesus Christ the
[12:14] same yesterday today and forever that
[12:16] what he did back then is it is the same
[12:18] thing that he could do now so
[12:21] uh that's kind of how I I view that as
[12:24] as far as uh healing our land and uh
[12:28] I've I've had uh several experiences of
[12:31] of being healed sister Kristen I
[12:33] understand she had the testimony of
[12:35] being healed in her knee and many others
[12:38] anybody else experienced the healing of
[12:41] the Lord is uh you know we're just
[12:43] thankful for that so that's kind of how
[12:45] I see that uh I try to view it
[12:48] differently
[12:50] not so much the United States but if I
[12:53] can humble myself and I can get myself
[12:56] right with him that he will heal me he
[12:58] will heal my spirit
[13:00] but as we read uh in in Exodus about the
[13:03] Tabernacle
[13:05] and in the sanctuary he said to build me
[13:07] a sanctuary now what is a sanctuary a
[13:10] sanctuary is a place where we get away
[13:11] from from the things of the world we get
[13:14] it we we like we were speaking this
[13:16] morning that we isolate ourselves uh not
[13:19] not so much from each other's presence
[13:21] but for a temporary time to get alone
[13:23] with God so uh a sanctuary is a place to
[13:28] where uh we could go without anybody uh
[13:32] uh bothering us we can get away from the
[13:34] problems uh if there's in the Old
[13:37] Testament a place of sanctuary if a man
[13:39] slayed another man he can go into the
[13:41] sanctuary City and nobody could touch
[13:43] him as long as he stayed within the the
[13:45] lines of the sanctuary City but if he
[13:47] stepped out of that Sanctuary he was
[13:49] free game so we want to come into the
[13:53] sanctuary What did the what did it say
[13:55] that the Lord Sanctified he Sanctified
[13:57] the sanctuary he Sanctified the the
[13:59] sacrifice he Sanctified the priests he
[14:02] Sanctified the people everything that he
[14:04] was in in his presence was sanctified
[14:07] so
[14:09] uh what I'd like to to speak on this
[14:12] evening is uh
[14:15] I will meet you there
[14:19] I will meet you there
[14:22] and as we read through those scriptures
[14:24] we we saw that he was he was saying that
[14:26] I will meet you there I will speak to
[14:28] you there and in the one once body said
[14:30] uh you go into this certain spot and
[14:32] I'll talk to the priests but we'll go
[14:35] into the sanctuary and I won't only talk
[14:37] to the priests but I also talk to the
[14:39] children of Israel or to the people of
[14:40] Israel so he could he could speak to the
[14:43] priests and he could speak to the people
[14:45] of Israel that's where that's this is
[14:47] where we come for the learning and for
[14:49] the uh the learning of the word of God
[14:50] this is where we come as into the
[14:52] sanctuary we're in a sanctuary so it's
[14:55] the Tabernacle where the presence of God
[14:57] comes and it's where it's a place of
[15:00] cleansing it's a place of sacrifice see
[15:02] we sacrifice our time from something
[15:04] else we've come here to Worship the Lord
[15:07] see the Tabernacle is also a place of
[15:10] worship but in order for that that
[15:11] worship to take place and uh there has
[15:14] to be a cleansing right so we have to be
[15:16] clean all sin every anything everything
[15:19] ought to be cleansed from us right
[15:21] so we can't come as a dirty vessel
[15:23] because we know that God can't dwell the
[15:26] Holy Spirit can't dwell with sin sin or
[15:29] the holy spirit is the one that we've
[15:31] that is one or the other that prevails
[15:33] in our life whichever one that we give
[15:35] over unto like we were talking this
[15:37] morning about the flow you could shut
[15:38] the flow of God off where you could set
[15:40] the flow of Satan off it's it's totally
[15:42] in your control which one you are going
[15:45] to uh accept the one that you were going
[15:48] to entertain uh the one that you're
[15:50] going to open up to so you you set the
[15:53] atmosphere and uh we're taught that even
[15:55] brother Branham said that we are the
[15:57] creators of our atmosphere if we get
[15:59] into an atmosphere that we don't like
[16:00] whether it be vulgarity we can change
[16:02] that atmosphere or Escape that
[16:04] atmosphere we don't have to sit there in
[16:07] an atmosphere of vulgarity unless you're
[16:09] on an airplane you know something like
[16:11] that you can't really go anywhere but
[16:13] you can go somewhere else in your mind
[16:17] you see you don't really have to pay
[16:19] attention to that because you can go
[16:21] somewhere else in your mind and your
[16:23] spirit because you could just start
[16:24] praying within you can ignore what's
[16:26] going on
[16:30] but he he said he said to see Kim
[16:34] see and uh I like how David said the
[16:36] Lord said unto me to to seek my face and
[16:40] something inside of him
[16:42] it's something something was struck on
[16:44] the inside of him that it was the desire
[16:46] because he was a man after God's Own
[16:47] Heart so we should be the same type of
[16:50] people that we should be people after
[16:51] God's Own Heart so when the when the
[16:54] when the word came to seeking my face uh
[16:57] David had said Lord thy face will I seek
[17:00] see there was an effort on David's part
[17:03] that he had to put forth right so we're
[17:05] not just going to be laying on the side
[17:06] of the street and just waiting for for
[17:08] God to come and to just move on our
[17:10] behalf but there's something that we
[17:12] also have to do amen but see uh
[17:15] but and with the with the priests it was
[17:18] a it was a certain called out people
[17:20] that could only be the priests uh not
[17:22] all Levites were were priests but all
[17:25] priests were Levites but see uh
[17:29] so there were special certain people
[17:30] that had to meet certain criteria uh
[17:33] they they couldn't have any broken bones
[17:35] they couldn't have uh they I can't
[17:38] remember all the stipulations but there
[17:40] are different things you couldn't have a
[17:41] crooked finger or something like that
[17:42] you couldn't have a crooked nose you
[17:44] know just different things like that the
[17:46] the priest had to be and meet the
[17:49] certain criteria to be in a perfect
[17:51] shape if you will
[17:53] and the same thing with the sacrifice as
[17:55] the sacrifice couldn't be second best it
[17:57] couldn't be a second-rate sacrifice it
[17:59] had to be the choice sheep or whatever
[18:02] it is it had to be the choice item that
[18:05] was being sacrificed out of a flock or
[18:08] whatever it was it had to be the best it
[18:10] had to be there had to be there couldn't
[18:12] be any blemish within that sacrifice but
[18:15] see we have we don't have Levites in
[18:17] this day you know when I first got uh
[18:19] when I first felt that I was called to
[18:21] the ministry
[18:22] uh there was I I met some resistance uh
[18:27] whether I should be a minister or not
[18:29] because I didn't meet certain criteria
[18:31] according to what the what the Levites
[18:33] were I guess
[18:35] but then I heard the the message one day
[18:37] I think uh hear ye him where he said the
[18:40] levitical priesthood has ceased and you
[18:43] want to talk about jumping and shouting
[18:44] I was running around in my living room I
[18:46] said well there's my release you know
[18:48] there's there's the there's my
[18:49] confirmation right there because we
[18:51] don't we cannot in this day there's
[18:53] there's no way that almost nobody would
[18:56] be able to be a minister if we had to
[18:58] come to the same criteria as a as a
[19:00] levitical priest
[19:03] especially when I was younger you know
[19:05] I've had a few broken bones so that
[19:07] would that would dis discredit me right
[19:10] there but uh and and so there's been a
[19:12] lot of people that's that's broken bones
[19:14] and different things like that but uh
[19:17] but I just thank God that there was one
[19:19] perfect high priest that doesn't have to
[19:21] he's already met all that and not only
[19:24] was he not only is he he the high priest
[19:26] but he's he is the life he is the blood
[19:28] he is the he is the sacrifice he's
[19:31] everything of what was required for the
[19:33] Tabernacle he is everything being put
[19:35] into one
[19:37] and he is a high priest of it all amen
[19:39] so today Jesus is our high priest he is
[19:43] the holiest of holies he is the Lamb he
[19:45] is our sacrifice and his word is the
[19:47] urma thumb right so for we come to the
[19:50] word for righteous Judgment of truth
[19:52] right we this this is where we judge
[19:54] things it's not our opinions it's not
[19:57] our man-made opinions that that judge
[19:59] things if it's right or not but it has
[20:01] to be according to the word so therefore
[20:03] this is the year of thumb and you
[20:05] remember uh the urima thumb of what it
[20:08] was it was the breastplate of
[20:09] righteousness and when somebody would
[20:11] come forth if they had a prophecy or or
[20:13] a word of Truth or something they had to
[20:15] speak it in the presence of the year my
[20:18] thumb and if it was truth the the
[20:20] breastplate would light up right but if
[20:23] it was false it would just sit there
[20:26] so that was the Judgment back then but
[20:28] now we have the whole word of God they
[20:29] didn't have this they didn't have a
[20:31] whole written bible back then
[20:35] but it uh this word is urim a thumbem so
[20:38] before we come to this word for
[20:40] righteous Judgment of truth and the
[20:42] stones in the ephod again would light up
[20:45] so if it doesn't line up with the word
[20:47] of God is there won't be any light right
[20:50] because it's not Christ because he said
[20:51] I am the light of the world so if it
[20:53] doesn't light up if it's not lined up
[20:55] with Christ it's not going to light up
[20:57] so it's just going to be nothing
[21:00] so let's turn to Hebrews 4 and 14.
[21:13] it says seeing then that we have a great
[21:15] high priest that has passed into the
[21:18] heavens Jesus the son of God see you
[21:20] don't have to take my word for it it
[21:22] says it right there
[21:23] let us hold fast our profession
[21:26] for we have not a high priest which
[21:28] cannot be touched with the feeling of
[21:30] our infirmities and I thank God for that
[21:32] but was in all points tempted like as we
[21:35] are yet without sin now see a lot of the
[21:37] Levites I guess you could say they
[21:39] probably wouldn't have so much
[21:40] compassion because they're man you know
[21:42] understandably they they might know some
[21:45] of our problems because they can only
[21:48] understand so far of what they've gone
[21:51] through what they've experienced that's
[21:53] the only thing that they could share
[21:54] with you but I thank God that there's
[21:56] Jesus Christ the high priest that has
[21:58] been tempted like all men he suffered
[22:00] under all those temptations that we go
[22:02] through amen
[22:04] so understandably he can understand
[22:06] everything that we're going through
[22:11] foreign
[22:12] so let us therefore come boldly unto the
[22:15] throne of grace that we may obtain mercy
[22:17] and find Grace to help
[22:20] to find Grace to help in time of need
[22:22] now see I can't get away from this
[22:24] thought here but uh I I just think so
[22:27] many people when you talk to when you
[22:29] talk to people about the word and and
[22:31] and you try to talk to them of how
[22:33] there's a a better place in Christ Jesus
[22:35] than the condition that they're in they
[22:37] say well I'm damaged goods
[22:40] I can't tell you we were all damaged
[22:43] goods because we were all born in sin
[22:45] shaped in iniquity coming to the world
[22:47] speaking lies so things were already
[22:48] against us
[22:50] so people say well God won't have me
[22:53] because I'm damaged goods I've I've gone
[22:56] too far I've sinned my day away
[22:58] not so
[22:59] that is not so and they they trick
[23:03] themselves because they have that kind
[23:04] of a mindset not realizing that that's
[23:07] just like Johnny Crowe that was that was
[23:09] tied up for so long and then when he was
[23:10] released he was freed he couldn't even
[23:13] understand what Freedom was
[23:15] he couldn't go he didn't understand the
[23:17] freedom
[23:18] so it's the same thing as people they
[23:20] don't see the freedom that they can
[23:22] attain if they would just come and
[23:24] humble themselves and give themselves
[23:26] over to the Lord Jesus Christ
[23:28] see they're they're hidden behind that
[23:30] because uh they can't see that because
[23:33] they just think they're looking at
[23:35] themselves and their condition we will
[23:37] never ever ever be good enough we didn't
[23:40] earn any of it
[23:43] but that's where Amazing Grace comes in
[23:46] amen so I just thank God for that see
[23:49] we're told in the word to draw nigh unto
[23:52] God and He will draw nigh unto thee see
[23:54] there's an effort that we have to put
[23:56] forward amen so we have to be able to
[23:58] take a step forward if we just stand
[24:00] there and don't move how do we expect
[24:02] God to move on our behalf see he he said
[24:05] if you meet these certain conditions I
[24:07] will meet you there do you build this
[24:09] Sanctuary you do this you bring the
[24:11] sacrifice you do all these things
[24:12] according to my instructions and I will
[24:15] meet you there
[24:16] see in your troubles he will meet you
[24:18] there in your heartache he will meet you
[24:21] there in your weakness he will meet you
[24:23] there when you need comfort he will meet
[24:25] you there if you need healing he will
[24:28] meet you there as long as you meet the
[24:29] right criteria the same conditions of
[24:32] what he is requesting so uh when you're
[24:35] faced with tough decisions he will beat
[24:37] you there too see when you feel all
[24:39] alone he will meet you there he will not
[24:41] leave you alone see when you feel so
[24:43] much despair where you feel like you
[24:45] want to take your own life he will meet
[24:46] you there
[24:48] he will meet you there in any condition
[24:50] you try to you just name it if you've
[24:53] got a need you just you just laid out to
[24:55] Christ and he will meet you there as
[24:57] long as you meet the the conditions of
[25:00] his instructions amen
[25:02] see even if you're backslid he will meet
[25:04] you there if you humble yourself
[25:08] and get right with him
[25:10] right that's the first part just humble
[25:12] yourself that is so hard for some people
[25:14] they can't say
[25:16] I am wrong
[25:18] they have a hard time saying I'm sorry
[25:22] I'm wrong it's hard for some people why
[25:25] because pride gets in the way Pride
[25:28] becomes the issue that holds so many
[25:30] people back
[25:33] oh you might say well I'm a tough guy
[25:36] nothing will hurt me I can handle
[25:38] anything that comes my way oh you
[25:40] jellyfish let me tell you something you
[25:42] get so emotionally hurt when somebody
[25:44] calls you out on something or or points
[25:47] something out in your life you get so
[25:48] emotionally hurt that you know something
[25:50] that you don't like as being said I
[25:52] gotta I gotta choke myself here
[25:55] ha
[25:56] and you get mad when somebody when
[25:59] somebody calls you out on something but
[26:00] see there was there was uh
[26:04] there was a woman in the Bible that she
[26:06] didn't think too much of herself see
[26:07] that's the problem is uh when I first
[26:09] came into the message there was a
[26:11] Brother Bruce Faust he used to make a
[26:13] comment uh if you're offended I'll tell
[26:15] you why because you think too much of
[26:17] yourself and that's where we get that's
[26:18] a good position that we get a lot is we
[26:20] think too much of ourselves and that's
[26:22] that's where we get hurt in our pride
[26:24] but there was a woman one time uh that
[26:26] Jesus uh
[26:28] Jesus was coming along the way walking
[26:30] along the way and she was crying out
[26:32] Jesus Jesus have mercy on me thou son of
[26:36] David and we know that reading through
[26:38] the scripture that she had no right to
[26:39] call him thus the son of David you know
[26:42] for she was a gentile right
[26:44] so and what did he say
[26:46] he called her dog it's not meat to give
[26:48] dog the the crunch to the dogs at the
[26:51] table right
[26:53] or it's not it's not meat to give the
[26:55] the children's bread to to dogs but she
[26:58] came along and said but I'll just take
[26:59] the crumbs you know I'll take the
[27:01] Overflow because if these dudes aren't
[27:03] going to take it I'm here to step in to
[27:05] take it amen
[27:08] but see it just shows that she had the
[27:10] desire she had a need
[27:13] and she was going to take any point
[27:16] necessary to get what she uh to get the
[27:19] remedy that she needed amen and even
[27:21] though he called her a dog talk about
[27:24] emotional damage
[27:27] you know I said this last week I said
[27:29] man could you imagine somebody calling
[27:30] you a dog how offended but then there
[27:33] are some people that are identify as
[27:34] cats nowadays that they got litter boxes
[27:36] in school so it might be right down
[27:38] their alley
[27:40] but back then at that time that that was
[27:42] that was quite the insult
[27:45] you know I wouldn't want to be referred
[27:47] to as a dog
[27:48] you know or somebody that doesn't belong
[27:50] because we all want to feel included in
[27:52] something we don't want to be excluded
[27:54] for from anything right if there's
[27:56] something that we want we don't want to
[27:57] feel excluded you know how it feels when
[27:59] you try to go play on the playground a
[28:02] game with all the other kids and ah we
[28:04] we don't want you with us you know you
[28:06] kind of feel shame you feel embarrassed
[28:08] because you're not included do you
[28:10] imagine how this woman might have felt
[28:11] that day uh you can't have the
[28:13] children's bread
[28:16] but she had persistence
[28:19] she stayed with it just like that woman
[28:21] with the unjust judge judge I'm here
[28:24] avenge me in my adversaries avenge me
[28:27] judge I'm here
[28:29] so it's a persistence
[28:31] to seek after God see he said seek my
[28:34] face but what do we say
[28:37] no I don't feel like it today
[28:39] or is there something on the inside Lord
[28:41] yes I will seek your face
[28:44] I will seek you but there is an effort
[28:46] that has to come forth from us right we
[28:49] can't just lay around and just expect
[28:50] things to happen
[28:53] amen
[28:54] well praise the Lord
[29:09] so like I said we can't expect God to do
[29:10] everything for us right so there's
[29:12] something that we have to do if he makes
[29:14] a promise it's up to us to go after
[29:16] right
[29:17] see a slugger to somebody who expects
[29:19] somebody else to sustain them because it
[29:22] you know it's so much effort to put
[29:24] their hand to their mouth to feed
[29:25] themselves they they want somebody else
[29:27] to do something for them they're looking
[29:29] for a head now hey somebody else
[29:32] you've got so much why don't you give
[29:34] unto me well why don't you go work for
[29:35] it well I don't feel like working I've
[29:37] got this I've got that so people make so
[29:39] many excuses why I can't go to work a
[29:42] lot of problems a lot of the problems in
[29:44] this day is it's oh I make too much on
[29:47] unemployment to go get a job
[29:50] that's what it is and people aren't
[29:51] going to get a job we've got a hiring
[29:53] crisis because people aren't going to
[29:55] work why because they're making more
[29:57] staying at home
[29:59] living off of the system
[30:02] but we know as Christians you know if we
[30:04] don't work we don't eat right so that's
[30:07] kind of our our Mantra if you will I
[30:09] shouldn't say Mantra but that's kind of
[30:11] the way that we live because we do
[30:12] everything under Christ Jesus if we do
[30:14] anything we do it all unto the Lord we
[30:17] don't we don't work for Amazon I mean we
[30:19] might get paid by Amazon I don't work
[30:21] for I work for vitro but I don't do my
[30:23] work for vitro
[30:25] I do my work as unto the Lord and
[30:27] whatever vitro gets that's that's the
[30:29] benefit for them right because I I give
[30:31] my best not just because I work for
[30:33] vitro yeah my paycheck comes from vitro
[30:36] but I give my best to the Lord
[30:39] and then He blesses from there
[30:41] amen so that's what we're taught in the
[30:43] scriptures we will do our best
[30:46] because we want to do it we're not going
[30:47] to bring some second-rate uh work ethic
[30:50] to work right we're going to come and
[30:51] we're going to bring our best and we're
[30:53] going to do the best that we can every
[30:54] day all day until our shift is over
[30:57] right so
[30:59] that's our work ethic is Christ Jesus so
[31:04] so you can't have faith if you're
[31:06] slaughtered right because see faith is a
[31:08] revelation we understand that faith is a
[31:10] revelation but faith is also action
[31:13] Faith puts into action Faith does
[31:16] something about it
[31:17] amen
[31:19] but see faith faith is an action for
[31:22] faith without works is dead so let us
[31:24] like Paul said you you show me your your
[31:27] faith uh you show me your works I'll
[31:30] show you my faith by my works so you
[31:32] think it's all these works that you're
[31:34] that you're earning all this stuff but I
[31:36] say unto you it's Grace that I earned
[31:38] all this stuff and through my faith I'm
[31:40] going to do these works and you see how
[31:42] that works
[31:44] it's going to be a whole different and
[31:46] I'm going to perform differently
[31:49] through faith instead of just works
[31:52] see if you have faith you're already
[31:54] automatically going to do the works of
[31:56] faith amen nobody has to prompt you to
[31:58] do it
[32:00] see there was a woman with a blood issue
[32:02] one time so did she just lay in the
[32:05] street and just Jesus come to me
[32:09] she wasn't just laying there just
[32:10] waiting for something to happen
[32:13] what does she do oh if I could just
[32:16] Touch the Hem of His Garment so she got
[32:18] closer and closer and there were people
[32:21] all around
[32:23] and there she touched
[32:24] she took the Hem of His Garment
[32:26] and then she was healed well what did
[32:28] Jesus feel
[32:31] who touched it who touched me he said
[32:34] well Lord what are you what are you
[32:35] talking about who touched you you see
[32:36] all these people around and you're going
[32:38] to say who touched me
[32:40] but it was a different touch it was a
[32:42] touch of faith
[32:43] because what did he say I perceived
[32:45] virtue has gone from me
[32:47] oh my see in our weakness we are made
[32:50] strong through him see through her
[32:52] weakness and through her ailment
[32:56] reaching out and touching him she
[32:58] received his strength
[33:00] amen
[33:02] see it's not in US
[33:04] it's not in us we can't do it
[33:07] but it was the effort that she put forth
[33:09] to go meet him
[33:11] amen
[33:13] now see uh the queen of the South which
[33:16] is also Queen of Sheba right
[33:18] she put a step forward
[33:20] and she'll put the put the put the shame
[33:23] I'll just read the scripture in Luke 11
[33:25] and 31.
[33:27] it says the queen of the South again
[33:29] that's that's the uh the Queen of Sheba
[33:31] shall rise up in the Judgment with the
[33:34] men of this generation
[33:35] and condemn them for she came from the
[33:38] utmost parts of the earth to hear the
[33:40] wisdom of Solomon and behold a greater
[33:43] than Solomon is here so if if she came
[33:46] from the utmost parts of the earth
[33:47] through desert with no air conditioning
[33:50] it's and she brought gifts
[33:54] she didn't just bring a couple coins
[33:57] she brought Lots
[33:59] she brought a lot with her because she
[34:00] wanted to give
[34:02] see she gave willingly nobody told her
[34:05] hey give all this stuff but it was
[34:07] something that was within her that she
[34:08] wanted to give so
[34:11] she's going to have judgment upon men of
[34:15] this generation because back then she
[34:17] was just going to hear the wisdom of
[34:19] Solomon that was great that Solomon had
[34:21] all that wisdom but in today's the hour
[34:23] we've got somebody that's much better
[34:25] and much higher
[34:27] than Solomon
[34:29] if people aren't willing to go people
[34:32] just want to sit at home well I could I
[34:34] could worship God here I could worship
[34:36] God at home I could sit on my porch and
[34:38] drink my cup of tea and worship god well
[34:40] I can go to work and I can worship god
[34:42] well I could go to a baseball game and
[34:44] worship God while you're worshiping God
[34:46] all right but it's just not the god of
[34:48] the Bible
[34:50] see God is an object of worship right
[34:53] oh my
[34:56] you're worshiping some God
[35:00] just not the true God
[35:03] okay I give I'll give you that that yeah
[35:06] you can worship God at home but
[35:09] home is not that that's forsaking the
[35:12] assembling of of of of each other right
[35:14] that's forsaking the assembly
[35:17] with uh Saints of leg presses Faith the
[35:21] people that you need to be around
[35:24] I must not be talking to you all must be
[35:26] talking to whoever's listening so
[35:28] because you're here
[35:30] you're not at home and now I understand
[35:32] that there's a difference between
[35:34] streaming at home if you're not feeling
[35:35] feeling very well or something you know
[35:38] once or every now and then that you
[35:40] can't make it to church that you're
[35:41] going to listen from home
[35:43] but it's still your church right so and
[35:47] you're still worshiping God but you're
[35:49] not sitting home watching I love Susie
[35:51] as brother Branham calling or you're not
[35:54] watching Sue Thomas or or something like
[35:56] that you're not staying at home watching
[35:57] TV
[35:59] or some ungodly show
[36:03] but you're coming for you're coming and
[36:05] putting forth the effort
[36:07] to hear something to receive something
[36:09] from God right now we all know I'm not
[36:12] God I'm I'm the least of the least but
[36:15] hey if there's something that I could
[36:17] say that somebody could get
[36:19] more power to you so and that's what I'm
[36:22] here for is I'm a minister I like what
[36:24] brother Jesse has on on his wall in
[36:26] there uh about brother Brandon talking
[36:28] about being a public servant you know as
[36:30] a minister and uh what's what's the
[36:33] ending it says something that uh in the
[36:35] face if you can't take all the knocks
[36:37] and you know and people doing the
[36:39] ridicule because that's what a public
[36:40] servant endures even you look at your
[36:42] law enforcement this day and uh people
[36:45] in a public office wherever it might be
[36:46] it could be the license place and they
[36:49] take a lot of stuff from a lot of people
[36:51] so just thinking of a minister of what
[36:54] he had hanging on the wall if you can't
[36:56] do that then I would go and research
[36:58] your calling again yo
[37:01] so the same thing as a Christian if you
[37:03] can't take the persecution I would
[37:05] question your calling or go research it
[37:09] go to make sure that you're being called
[37:10] to be a Christian
[37:13] see this is a day that that we've got to
[37:15] be serious about all this we we can't be
[37:17] playing church anymore but if we want to
[37:20] receive something something from God
[37:21] we've got to go and attain it so if we
[37:24] come according to his instructions he
[37:26] will meet us there right I
[37:27] wholeheartedly believe that
[37:36] talking about that woman with the blood
[37:37] issue of how of of how she she saw Jesus
[37:41] in the midst and
[37:42] and all she needed to do was just Touch
[37:44] the Hem of His Garment was it the Hem of
[37:46] the Garment that that healed her no but
[37:48] it was the faith that she had in him
[37:52] if she could just get close enough now
[37:54] all I could I I can't help but think of
[37:56] that that woman uh that Mexican woman
[37:58] when she lost her baby when her baby
[38:00] died
[38:01] those deacons are nobody else that that
[38:03] tried to keep her down you couldn't you
[38:06] can't keep a mother down when she's
[38:07] desperate for a child
[38:09] she's going to find a way
[38:11] and she did she was so desperate that
[38:14] she had to get the brother Branham to
[38:15] get prayed for
[38:17] oh my
[38:19] but she knew where to go she wasn't
[38:22] sitting on the sideline you know Fido
[38:24] kicked up well he'll come to me
[38:27] waiting for something to happen but she
[38:30] went and met
[38:32] him there
[38:34] amen
[38:37] let's turn to Luke chapter 7 and verse
[38:39] 36.
[38:48] this okay this evening
[38:50] he's the Lord
[38:55] I don't plan on being too much longer
[38:58] listen
[39:02] I was feeling tired this afternoon too
[39:04] so I
[39:05] matter of fact I kind of fell asleep in
[39:07] there for a little bit
[39:13] let's see it's amazing what 10 or 15
[39:15] minutes will do for you
[39:17] you know it almost does what eight hours
[39:19] will do for you it's amazing
[39:23] now don't go trying to live off of 15
[39:25] minutes of sleep
[39:26] well brother Brian said no I didn't
[39:32] but no just just take it a rest
[39:36] just take it a rest every now and then
[39:37] just get refreshed
[39:41] we weren't Built To Go 24 hours a day
[39:44] seven days a week you know even the Lord
[39:46] rested from his word so and if we're
[39:48] Made In His Image now don't take that
[39:50] over don't go overboard with that one
[39:51] and resting too much to where you become
[39:54] slothful amen
[39:57] uh Luke chapter 7 and verse 36
[40:01] it says in one of the Pharisees desired
[40:04] him
[40:05] that he would eat with him
[40:07] and he went in into the Pharisees house
[40:09] and sat down to meet
[40:12] and behold a woman in the city which was
[40:14] a sinner
[40:16] catch that
[40:20] which was a sinner was a sinner
[40:24] when she knew that Jesus sat at meat in
[40:26] the Pharisees house brought an alabaster
[40:28] box of ointment and we learned from the
[40:31] other uh the other gospels that this was
[40:33] a very costly I mean I think she spent
[40:35] all her her life savings on this
[40:37] Alabaster Box so this was very valuable
[40:40] to her because she spent everything that
[40:43] she had on this box
[40:46] verse 38 says and stood At His Feet
[40:50] behind him weeping and began to
[40:53] and began to wash his feet with tears
[40:55] and did wipe them with the hairs of her
[40:57] head and kissed his feet and anointed
[40:59] them with the ointment I'll say I'm the
[41:02] type of person when I read I get very
[41:04] visual in my head it's almost like
[41:07] watching a movie I don't is anybody else
[41:09] like that so when I read through this
[41:11] stuff it's like a drama being played out
[41:13] in my mind so could you imagine her
[41:17] washing somebody's feet with just tears
[41:20] yo if you have a little bit of water in
[41:23] a basin you have a hard time getting all
[41:24] that water on some on somebody's foot to
[41:27] to wash it so could you imagine how much
[41:29] how many tears she was shedding how much
[41:32] was coming from her the sincerity that
[41:35] this woman had
[41:40] knowing of what type of person she was
[41:42] in the presence of knowing what type of
[41:45] person he was
[41:47] and you want to talk about damaged goods
[41:49] these people want to say well I'm too
[41:51] damaged think of this woman and what she
[41:53] did think of what he could have done
[41:57] is exactly what what Simon is getting
[41:59] ready to say here what we're getting
[42:01] ready to read
[42:04] let's read 38 again and stood At His
[42:06] Feet behind him weeping
[42:12] and began to wash his feet with tears
[42:15] and did wipe them with the hairs of her
[42:16] head and kissed his feet and anointed
[42:19] them with the ointment
[42:20] now in the Pharisee which had bitten him
[42:22] saw it he spake within himself saying
[42:24] this man now notice it was within
[42:26] himself he wasn't talking to anybody
[42:27] else he said he spake within himself
[42:30] saying and this is what makes a prophet
[42:32] here or this is part of it this man if
[42:34] he if he were a prophet would have known
[42:36] who and what manner of woman this is
[42:38] that toucheth him for she is a sinner
[42:41] see he's saying that she is a sinner but
[42:44] just before that it shows that she was a
[42:47] sinner
[42:49] and Jesus answering said unto him Simon
[42:52] I have somewhat to say unto thee and he
[42:55] saith Master say On and Here Comes the
[42:58] rebuke
[42:59] there is a certain creditor which had
[43:01] two debtors the one owed 500 Pence of
[43:04] the other 50. and when they had nothing
[43:06] to pay he frankly forgave them both
[43:08] tell me therefore which of them will
[43:10] love him most
[43:11] Simon answered and said I suppose that
[43:13] he to whom he forgave most and he said
[43:16] unto him thou Hast rightly judged and he
[43:19] turned to the woman and said unto Simon
[43:21] see us out this woman I entered into
[43:23] thine house thou gavest be no water for
[43:26] my feet see that was a custom back then
[43:28] if you invite somebody in you take care
[43:30] of that person you take care of that
[43:32] guest but this this special guest that
[43:35] they didn't realize who was in their
[43:36] midst he didn't do anything for him he
[43:39] brought no water so he says you gave us
[43:41] me no water for my feet but she hath
[43:43] washed my feet with her tears and wiped
[43:46] them with the hairs of her head now you
[43:47] tell me which one of you is more sincere
[43:49] which one of you wants to see me the
[43:52] most which one of you has more need of
[43:54] me
[43:55] oh my see thou gavest me no kiss but
[43:59] this woman since the time I came in had
[44:01] not ceased to kiss my feet
[44:03] my head with all doubt it's not anoint
[44:06] but this woman hath anointed my feet
[44:08] with ointment with everything that she
[44:10] had she spent all of her money on me
[44:13] just to anoint me
[44:16] see wherefore I say unto thee her sins
[44:19] which are many are forgiven for she
[44:22] loved much but to whom little Is
[44:24] Forgiven the same loveth little
[44:27] see she loved him so much she gave
[44:30] everything for him see there was an
[44:32] action that see that was Faith by her
[44:35] works oh my see that's something that's
[44:38] a whole lot different from somebody
[44:39] sitting on the sidelines waiting for
[44:41] something to happen she went and made
[44:43] something happen amen see there must
[44:45] have been something on the inside that
[44:46] told her to go do this kind of a thing
[44:48] because she probably didn't have any
[44:50] instruction besides if she went in there
[44:52] knowing who she was she probably figured
[44:54] well if I go in there they're going to
[44:56] kick me out they won't let me in here
[44:58] because they know what kind of a woman I
[45:00] am they know what kind of a person we
[45:01] are so if somebody came through these
[45:03] doors and you know what kind of person
[45:04] they are are you going to kick them out
[45:06] I sure hope not I sure hope that you
[45:09] would extend your arms and wrap them
[45:10] around them and draw them in amen see
[45:13] that's what loving Christians will do
[45:15] amen see we're not looking at somebody's
[45:17] present uh condition we're looking at
[45:19] what can be amen
[45:22] we're looking at an investment see if
[45:24] somebody came through there that's
[45:25] exactly what it is it's an investment
[45:28] amen
[45:32] and he said unto her thy sins are
[45:34] forgiven now see this confounded them
[45:36] because they said and they that sat at
[45:38] me with them began to say within
[45:40] themselves who is this that forgive his
[45:42] sins also and he said to the woman thy
[45:45] faith hath saved thee go in peace
[45:49] thy faith has saved thee now they see
[45:52] there's something about faith amen faith
[45:56] can move a mountain right Faith puts
[45:59] into action Faith doesn't sit around
[46:01] sitting and stewing and whining and
[46:03] complaining about somebody's condition
[46:05] Faith does something about it
[46:09] now see back in back in the times of
[46:11] Egypt
[46:13] what did they do they murmured and they
[46:15] complained they murmured and can
[46:16] complain but then there was a time as
[46:18] the years went by they started figuring
[46:21] out let us cry out unto our God so there
[46:23] must have been something inside of them
[46:25] that said if we just turn our hearts
[46:27] back to God that he will heal us and he
[46:30] will heal our land and he will give us
[46:32] Deliverance amen there must have been
[46:33] something within them to come forth see
[46:36] they didn't have an instruction book to
[46:37] go by
[46:39] but it's by the revelation we know faith
[46:42] is revelation right so we know we could
[46:46] kind of assume that in their
[46:48] conditioning we could do better than
[46:50] this Our God can do we know that he
[46:52] could take care of us better than what
[46:54] we've got here
[46:56] oh my
[46:58] they wanted out
[47:01] not to say that they weren't complaining
[47:02] to murdering about the release later
[47:07] see it just seems like you can't make
[47:09] anybody happy they cry that they want
[47:12] one thing they get it and they and then
[47:13] they cry because they didn't get it the
[47:15] way they expected to get it
[47:18] oh well thank you for the new car but I
[47:21] was kind of I wasn't expecting a
[47:23] Volkswagen Little Beetle I was expecting
[47:25] a Lamborghini
[47:29] can't you be happy with something that
[47:31] you could actually drive
[47:33] and afford to fix
[47:36] oh I want a beamer I want a BMW
[47:42] I'm not a mechanic but that's one of the
[47:44] most expensive cars not just a buy just
[47:48] a fix
[47:52] Mercedes-Benz
[47:53] those are for Rich folks
[47:55] because they can afford to fix it that's
[47:58] not for poor people
[47:59] because the parts cost oh my parts cost
[48:02] a lot
[48:05] this is I had to change the alternator
[48:07] at our the Honda Pilot at one time this
[48:10] was about a year ago I think David
[48:13] drives it now
[48:15] now see mind you I did I didn't change
[48:17] an alternator for a long time so I think
[48:20] the last alternator I bought I don't
[48:22] know how many years ago it was like 40
[48:24] bucks
[48:26] if it went to 50 bucks you'd have heard
[48:27] somebody crying and complaining
[48:30] actually they were just 40.
[48:32] let's see when I went and bought this
[48:33] alternator
[48:36] I'm glad I was sitting down because it
[48:37] was 120 bucks
[48:40] what happened to 40.
[48:44] inflation hit
[48:45] not only did it hit but it hit hard
[48:49] so everybody's kind of feeling that in
[48:51] this day I mean just everybody's
[48:53] struggling because everything costs more
[48:56] than what it used to except McDonald's
[48:58] food because it's not real food
[49:01] that's like plastic that's
[49:03] made edible for people to eat I don't
[49:05] know I don't like McDonald's food
[49:08] okay I do like their fries
[49:10] but that's about it I can't stand their
[49:12] burgers I can't stand that food I'd just
[49:14] rather stay away from McDonald's sorry
[49:16] McDonald's I'm not
[49:18] promoting your company but
[49:22] now Burger King no
[49:26] you can pay me later no oh
[49:29] but yeah just
[49:31] I can't even remember what I was saying
[49:33] I don't know why I went where I went but
[49:35] uh but anyways
[49:38] oh
[49:40] kind of finishing up in in the in the
[49:42] Luke chapter 7 of verse 50. he says and
[49:46] and he said to this woman thy faith had
[49:48] made
[49:49] has saved thee and he says go in peace
[49:52] now in Matthew and Mark Jesus says this
[49:55] about the woman married uh both of them
[49:58] kind of say that I think they say the
[50:00] same thing they're just in different
[50:01] different gospels so I'm only going to
[50:03] read one of them
[50:05] this is out of Matthew 26 and 13. he
[50:07] says verily I say unto you
[50:10] wheresoever this gospel shall be
[50:12] preached in the whole world there shall
[50:14] also
[50:15] excuse me there shall also this that
[50:18] this woman hath done be told for a
[50:20] memorial of her see he thought of her so
[50:25] much because of what she did see if you
[50:28] honor God he will honor you
[50:30] now see kind of and I believe it would
[50:32] be in this same type of a manner that if
[50:34] we give him honor he will also honor us
[50:38] amen see he said be ye holy for I am
[50:42] Holy so you come into these the same
[50:44] condition of what he requires
[50:47] you give him honor not coming wow you're
[50:50] making me do this you're making me do
[50:52] that but it's
[50:54] I don't think the bride has that kind of
[50:55] an attitude the bride says whatsoever
[50:58] you want I want to give
[51:01] I want to come according to your way
[51:03] that's a bride
[51:05] coming his way according to the husband
[51:07] right amen
[51:11] but see this woman that that anointed
[51:14] his feet and and washed his feet with
[51:16] her tears dried her dried his feet with
[51:18] her hair
[51:20] oh my
[51:22] knowing that she was a sinner
[51:24] knowing that he was believing that he
[51:26] was the Messiah I want to I'll go as far
[51:29] as to say that I think she believed that
[51:31] he was the Messiah at least she believed
[51:33] that he was somebody important
[51:37] but see she came and she got something
[51:39] right she came and she gave him honor
[51:42] and that's where he met her
[51:44] see through this honor when she honored
[51:47] him and he honored her as well see what
[51:50] happened is when those people when Simon
[51:53] was ridiculing him or excuse me
[51:55] ridiculing her and his mind
[51:58] Jesus perceived that and he came to her
[52:00] defense
[52:03] so he'll do that for that he'll do that
[52:05] for us too when we need him he will meet
[52:07] us there
[52:09] if we need him at our defense he'll meet
[52:10] us there
[52:13] amen so if he'll meet us there if he'll
[52:15] defend us then what weapon formed
[52:17] against was shall prosper amen no matter
[52:20] what the accuser of the Brethren will
[52:21] bring forth those are old things I've
[52:23] repented of those things you can't use
[52:25] that anymore that's old news pal
[52:28] see when we come to the Lord we give him
[52:31] everything
[52:33] we repent we've humbled ourselves we've
[52:35] made things right
[52:37] what weapon formed against us shall
[52:39] prosper what accusation will the enemy
[52:41] have against us amen
[52:48] Jeremiah 29
[52:50] 11.
[52:55] he says
[52:56] for I know the thoughts that I think
[52:58] towards you saith the Lord thoughts of
[53:01] peace and not of evil to give you an
[53:03] expected end
[53:05] then shall ye call upon me and ye shall
[53:09] go and pray unto me and I will hearken
[53:11] unto you and ye shall seek me and find
[53:15] me
[53:16] when ye shall search for me with all
[53:19] your heart
[53:21] not just halfway not just a half step
[53:25] but it's a whole step
[53:27] with a determination With a Purpose with
[53:30] your whole heart
[53:33] and I will be found of you saith the
[53:35] Lord and I will turn away your captivity
[53:37] and I will gather you from all the
[53:40] nations and from all the places whether
[53:42] I have driven you saith the Lord and I
[53:44] will bring you again into the place once
[53:46] I caused you to be carried away captive
[53:48] amen if you stand to your feet I'll go
[53:51] ahead and close
[53:54] yeah
[53:56] see faith is the substance of things
[53:59] hoped for
[54:00] see faith is good right it's great to
[54:02] have faith for the just shall live by
[54:04] faith right that's how we live for that
[54:06] we read that that woman was saved by her
[54:09] faith right
[54:11] but the problem is is that most people
[54:14] are stuck at Hope
[54:16] see faith is a substance of things hoped
[54:18] for
[54:20] hope is just a desire for something to
[54:23] happen a strong desire if you will
[54:25] because hope hope has a lot of power
[54:27] behind it
[54:28] but see the difference is Faith is
[54:31] possession hope is you're almost there
[54:33] but faith is attained
[54:35] faith is is a tangible thing I guess you
[54:38] could say the the distinguishing Factor
[54:42] faith is possession
[54:47] let's see there was one time that that
[54:49] Jesus uh called Peter or bid Peter to
[54:52] step out under the water Peter didn't
[54:54] stay in the boat right all the other
[54:55] disciples stayed in the boat
[54:57] but Peter was the one who stepped out
[55:00] Peter did something about it when he was
[55:02] called he answered the call and he
[55:03] stepped out but yet did he doubt when he
[55:06] got before he got to Jesus yeah he
[55:08] started to die
[55:09] but the point is is he at least stepped
[55:11] out under the water he was the only one
[55:13] who took Jesus at his word
[55:15] he was the only one
[55:19] in a million if you might say
[55:21] to take a step out amen
[55:24] see he gave he gave others instructions
[55:27] right Gideon
[55:29] Samson
[55:31] Joshua you know all these Heroes of the
[55:34] faith he gave instructions
[55:36] but you know if they didn't follow those
[55:38] instructions
[55:40] they wouldn't have made it anywhere they
[55:42] wouldn't have succeeded
[55:44] so we know that uh we know with Samson
[55:47] because he didn't give God his whole
[55:48] heart
[55:51] that it seemed like he kind of failed in
[55:53] certain areas
[55:55] but Gideon he was saying well if God
[55:58] before us where are all the Miracles
[56:00] but see he got to that point where Faith
[56:04] kicked in and he obeyed the Lord he
[56:06] obeyed the angel of the Lord's
[56:07] instructions right
[56:09] so we have certain instructions
[56:12] and if we follow these instructions what
[56:15] should hinder us
[56:16] amen see if you have a need he will meet
[56:20] you there Naaman in the Bible when the
[56:23] prophet told him to go Washington and
[56:24] the River Jordan seven times he looked
[56:26] at them you want me to wash in there
[56:30] yeah
[56:31] go wash in there
[56:33] for that's that was the instruction
[56:35] but he was too prideful at first
[56:38] and then then a servant said name it if
[56:41] he told you to go do some great thing
[56:42] you wouldn't hesitate to go do that
[56:44] great thing but he's asking you this
[56:46] small thing just to wash in Jordan seven
[56:48] times
[56:49] so if you would do the great things why
[56:51] can't you why wouldn't you do the small
[56:52] things
[56:54] amen
[56:55] amen
[56:58] say and that's where I think people get
[57:00] they get too embarrassed so if you want
[57:02] the Holy Spirit what does what is this
[57:04] the Seal of God the Seal of God is the
[57:07] holy spirit right so we know that that
[57:09] Holy Spirit is the token how important
[57:12] is that it's it's the it's the token
[57:14] that seals you until the day of your
[57:16] Redemption that's how important it is
[57:19] amen so what are what are people willing
[57:22] to give up to receive the Holy Ghost you
[57:24] know brother Brandon talked about MOS uh
[57:26] I I think it was Moe's and uh about his
[57:29] boss I think it was his boss he said you
[57:32] know if you want the Holy Spirit then
[57:34] why don't you come in here this is where
[57:35] to go get it in the in the in the mud of
[57:38] the pigsty
[57:40] they said well I'm not going to go in
[57:42] there well if you want it you're going
[57:43] to have to come in here how bad do you
[57:45] want it how bad do we need to how bad do
[57:48] we want the touch from God today
[57:50] amen are we willing to take that stuff
[57:53] forward amen
[57:54] see the problem is people can't humble
[57:56] themselves
[57:58] see people want to say what's that
[58:00] scripture uh
[58:03] resist the devil and he will flee from
[58:04] you everybody wants to quote that part
[58:06] of it but they forget the beginning
[58:07] where it says submit yourselves unto God
[58:11] that's a hard thing for people is they
[58:13] can't submit themselves because they
[58:15] don't want to be controlled by another
[58:16] entity they want to be the ones in
[58:18] control they have a trust issue because
[58:21] they can't trust anybody else especially
[58:23] into a being that they can't see
[58:26] yeah you know just like Thomas he said
[58:27] well I'm not going to believe that it's
[58:29] the Lord until I see the nails and the
[58:31] the nail prints in his hand
[58:34] but see more blessed are we if we're not
[58:36] offended at him and that we don't have
[58:38] to see those kind of things but we have
[58:40] that faith in him already we have that
[58:42] faith in the one that we can't see
[58:45] amen and how much stronger that Faith
[58:48] would be
[58:49] to not being able to see physically see
[58:52] God
[58:54] amen
[58:55] amen let's look to the Lord in prayer
[58:59] see the scripture says humble yourselves
[59:01] therefore under the mighty hand of God
[59:03] that he may exalt you in due time
[59:06] casting all your care upon him for he
[59:08] cares for you
[59:10] so let us do that this evening
[59:12] that we will cast all of our cares upon
[59:15] Him o gracious Heavenly Father
[59:18] Lord I just thank you for what you've
[59:21] done for us I thank you for meeting us

[59:47] need of healing that to call the Elders
[59:49] of the church and pray the prayer of
[59:51] faith the anointing with oil and
[59:54] that they shall be healed father I pray
[59:57] to that and not look back oh God that
[1:00:00] the Lord may she have her May her faith
[1:00:02] be unto you the author and the finisher
[1:00:05] of our faith father may she hold on to

[1:00:16] to you or the call out to you Lord I
[1:00:18] have this situation I have this certain
[1:00:20] need in my life Lord and I will humble
[1:00:22] myself whatever it takes I will come to
[1:00:24] you according to your provided way I
[1:00:27] will come to you this evening Lord God I
[1:00:29] just pray that you just
[1:00:31] needs as they reach out to you tonight
[1:00:33] father Lord the unspoken request that
[1:00:35] might have been uh somebody might have
[1:00:37] raised her hand earlier today having a
[1:00:40] need upon their hearts but may they
[1:00:41] bring it unto you casting all of their
[1:00:43] cares upon them upon you humbling
[1:00:46] themselves before you are God and I pray
[1:00:48] that you would just move upon those
[1:00:50] those needs here tonight going on for I
[1:00:52] believe it's a promise that you said
[1:00:54] that if we would come in these certain
[1:00:56] conditions that you will meet us there
[1:00:57] oh father so Lord we're just taking you
[1:01:00] at your word tonight and we know that
[1:01:01] you are not a breaker who promises but
[1:01:03] Lord you are a promise keeper oh God and
[1:01:05] Lord we just we just cling on
[1:01:08] that knowing that that's a a promise
[1:01:10] that we're we're holding on to
[1:01:15] in Jesus Christ's name we ask it father
[1:01:17] amen
[1:01:18] [Music]
[1:01:21] amen praise the Lord I read this this
[1:01:25] song at the home church last week
[1:01:28] um not that I want to say because I
[1:01:31] don't know it I had just uh seen it for
[1:01:34] the first time last week it's called
[1:01:36] kneel at the cross anybody hear that
[1:01:38] anybody hear that song
[1:01:40] I never heard it until I sold the lyrics
[1:01:43] and then I've heard it through song one
[1:01:44] or two times online
[1:01:47] I really like the words to it again this
[1:01:50] is Neil at the cross it says kneel at
[1:01:52] the cross Christ will meet you there
[1:01:55] come while he waits for you listen to
[1:01:59] listen to his voice leave with him no
[1:02:02] care
[1:02:03] and begin life at noon and the courses
[1:02:07] kneel at the cross leave every character
[1:02:11] we'll meet you there and then the only
[1:02:14] other verse that I found or that I saw
[1:02:16] kneel at the cross there is one for all
[1:02:18] so we don't hold anybody back
[1:02:23] Come As You Are you are never the Holy
[1:02:25] Spirit do the changing but if you meet
[1:02:27] him at the cross he will meet you there
[1:02:32] for all who would his glory share bless
[1:02:36] their awaits harm can never be formed
[1:02:38] those who are anchored
[1:02:42] beautiful words
[1:02:43] um
[1:02:45] you might say
[1:03:05] Amazing Grace
[1:03:51] thank you

[1:06:19] [Music]
[1:06:38] to the gate of the city behold there was
[1:06:42] a dead man carried out the only son of
[1:06:45] his mother and she was a widow and much
[1:06:48] people of the city was with her
[1:06:52] and when the Lord saw her he had
[1:06:54] compassion on her and said unto her weep
[1:06:59] not
[1:06:59] and he came and touched the touched the
[1:07:02] beer
[1:07:03] and they that bear him Stood Still and
[1:07:06] he said young man I say unto thee arise
[1:07:08] and he that was dead sat up and began to
[1:07:12] speak and he delivered him to his mother
[1:07:14] now take no she didn't ask for this I
[1:07:18] know that pretty much for this whole
[1:07:19] message
[1:07:19] [Music]
[1:07:24] but we have to meet him but there was a
[1:07:27] need that he saw and he had compassion
[1:07:29] but he still
[1:07:30] there even though she didn't ask there
[1:07:34] was something that moved Upon Jesus name
[1:07:36] to where he had compassion honored
[1:07:41] and then in verse 16 it says and there
[1:07:43] came a fear on all and they glorified
[1:07:45] God saying that a great prophet is risen
[1:07:48] up among us and that God hath visited
[1:07:52] his people
[1:07:54] amen
[1:07:56] and this rumor of him went forth
[1:07:58] throughout all to give and throughout
[1:08:00] all the region round about and The
[1:08:03] Disciples of John showed him of all
[1:08:06] these things
[1:08:07] and then
[1:08:09] the next the next new verses talks about
[1:08:11] going to John the Baptist
[1:08:14] so then he was kind of acquainted this
[1:08:17] one that we're going to look for yeah
[1:08:19] but uh where it says in verse 14 it says
[1:08:22] that he can
[1:08:26] he came I guess you could say that
[1:08:28] your attributes
[1:08:30] a gurney in this day or a deathman
[1:08:34] um you see according to the customers of
[1:08:36] Jews
[1:08:37] but something was going to have to take
[1:08:38] place
[1:08:40] because if he was going to touch that
[1:08:42] beer
[1:08:43] or that Gurney whatever each stretcher
[1:08:46] whatever you might want to call it see
[1:08:48] they couldn't touch anything dead or
[1:08:50] they would be defiled so Jesus touched
[1:08:52] that that death bed now see if something
[1:08:55] wouldn't have happened he would have
[1:08:56] been defined
[1:08:57] but that man would have had to raise up
[1:08:59] the life for him not to be defined
[1:09:01] [Music]
[1:09:04] see there's a crater that Solomon here
[1:09:07] but there's a greater than all of them
[1:09:09] here because he's better than what the
[1:09:11] high priest said he's better than all
[1:09:13] the Jews in the Old Testament and he's
[1:09:15] better than any in the New Testament
[1:09:16] there's none like amen
[1:09:19] praise the Lord
[1:09:21] [Music]
[1:09:26] let's go to verse 30 real quick and then
[1:09:29] I know I'll be done
[1:09:32] I almost promise
[1:09:34] verse 30 says but the Pharisees and the
[1:09:37] lawyers rejected the Council of God
[1:09:40] against themselves being not baptized
[1:09:43] see the Pharisees of the lawyers these
[1:09:46] people they rejected the counsel of God
[1:09:50] and then and the Lord said where to then
[1:09:53] shall I like him the men of this
[1:09:55] generation and to what are they like
[1:09:57] they are like unto children sitting in
[1:09:59] the marketplace and calling one to
[1:10:01] another and saying we have pint unto you
[1:10:03] and you have not danced but we have
[1:10:05] warned to you and yet you have not wept
[1:10:09] for John the Baptist came neither eating
[1:10:11] bread nor drinking wine and ye say he
[1:10:13] hath the devil the son of man has come
[1:10:16] eating and drinking and you say Behold a
[1:10:18] gluttonous man and a wine River a friend
[1:10:21] of publicans and sinners but wisdom is
[1:10:23] Justified of all her children
[1:10:26] see at one point that kind of goes back
[1:10:28] to what I was talking about people can't
[1:10:30] be satisfied even if you give them a new
[1:10:31] card they say that for John the Baptist
[1:10:33] came neither eating eating bread or
[1:10:36] drinking wine and you say as a devil but
[1:10:38] the
[1:10:40] [Music]
[1:10:46] these people couldn't be satisfied
[1:10:49] either way
[1:10:50] but if we could just humble ourselves
[1:10:52] and accept them for who he is he will
[1:10:55] where we need him
[1:10:57] amen there any further needs a savior
[1:11:00] again if you need prayer be happy
[1:11:06] thank you
