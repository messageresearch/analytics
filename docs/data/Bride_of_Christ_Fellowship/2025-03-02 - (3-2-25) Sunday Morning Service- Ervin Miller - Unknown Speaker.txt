25 Matthew 7 verse 24 it says therefore whosoever Hearth these sayings of mine and doth them I will liken him unto a wise man which build his house upon a rock and the rains descended and the floods came and the winds blew and beat upon that house and it fell not for it was founded upon a rock that sounds to me like a solid foundation let's bow our heart heads for prayer Heavenly Father we ask that you would just lead this message today Lord Lord help me to get out of the way yes Jesus and you speak to our hearts Lord whatever we need thank you Lord and we ask that every demon demonic powers are cast out and have to go in dry places Lord in the name of Jesus thank you Lord for this and we ask that we could be truly yielded to you Lord Lord thank you Lord and only you and Lord give us wisdom and Revelation and understanding of your word which is you we we pray this in your holy name amen amen you may be seated I seeing more and more how important it is to have the word and I'm seeing more and more what the devil's trick is to try to get us away from the word that is the only place to stand the only safe place to stand but Satan is a deceiver and God warned us that they asked him what are the signs of the last times and what were the words that Jesus told them be careful that no man deceive you so if we look back what what did Satan you back in it started all the way back in the Garden of Eden while sin started in heaven cuz Satan was in heaven but sin started uh back there in the Garden of Eden and when the serpent came to Eve they had the word they had the promise right is it anything different from today we got the word we got the promise but why do we struggle James I think it's in James 1 it says uh if we are tossed to and fro we are unstable in our ways I think if I don't if I'm not mistaken yesterday morning we had a pretty strong wind I think it was coming from the south or the Southwest well by evening it was coming from the North or Northeast and it was a cold wind so let's just picture in our minds if we were out on a boat on a on the sea if we if we didn't have our anger down of the on the boat which is upon the rock where was that boat yesterday morning it would have blown all the way to the North End Of The Sea and by last evening it would have been all the way to the South End Of The Sea and that's the way our lives are if we don't know where we stand with God and Satan loves it you know what he's doing today if I remember right there were thousands of demons released in the arrus river right who who are they attacking are they attacking the denominational system or are they attacking the bride of Christ amen they are attacking the bride of Christ because they want to destroy them so what are they going to do they're trying to get us off the word of God that's what they're trying to do how are they going to do it they do it he those demons tried to get us uh through religion stop and think it started all the way back there in the Garden of Eden Satan came to Eve and he twisted it got her to doubt doubt the word of God what happened they couldn't be in the Garden of Eden any longer so what did they do they made fig leaves and that's exactly what people are doing today if people say we need more and the word of God it is evidence that they're not trusting the word of God because it is the promise so let's just come down to the Rock to the real thing if I'm not trusting the word I'm going to try to build a religion if we build a if we build a religion it's we're telling people we're telling God we don't trust his word but it looks good we might have 30 40 people in here today and there's a difference if we have the spirit of unity if everybody would just agree with just agree as a group we'll be doing this doesn't really matter what the word says we'll agree to do one thing and we'll do that that Spirit of unity it looks good that's what Cain was doing he was offering up sacrifice to God it looked real good you know what is more powerful if we are in unity with the spirit of godallah one person standing in unity with the spirit of God is more power than 40 people agreeing on something that is not lining up with the word of godallah amen yes stop and think after the flood of Noah it says Noah was a man he walked with God he was obedient to God God told him to build an ark did he do it he did it did it save him and his family amen where were all the other people there was a lot more people on the Earth at that time where where were they they weren't believing the word of God or they would have been in the ark they would have been helping built the ark that's right but they weren't they weren't can you imagine how Noah probably got mocked no rain so here it says the rain descended the flood BLS came the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell not because it was founded upon the rock so what is the rock for us today Hallelujah we've got a lot of people that know the word of God or they think they know it they're smart yes they figure things out but this is what I'm seeing we need the revelation of the word and that only comes from God revealing it to us and that's the only thing that can stand it says the Gates of Hell will not Prevail against it isn't that true right yes it won't be shaking us we won't be in one side of the Sea on the morning and the other side in the evening if we know where we stand amen amen it's not because we are smart it is because we humbled ourselves we repented and we received the Holy Ghost and God is revealing his truth to us the veil the veil has taken off our hearts and our minds and our eyes and we've got anointed anointed by the on our ears and our eyes we need that amen hallelujah if we stop and think after the the flood was and God promised that there will never be a flood again right to destroy all the Earth did they believe it absolutely not they didn't believe it because they started building a tower in case it would rain again that they could get above the water that's religion so they didn't believe the promise of God yes and that's where this all started Cain and then the Tower of Babel what was it the power Babel is confusion yes is is confusion from God or from the enemy yes sir from the enemy yes how many times does the enemy come and try to get us and we struggle maybe we're not believing the right thing that's the enemy and it says in verse 26 and everyone that Hearth these sayings of mine and does them not is like an unto a foolish man which build his house upon the sand and the rains descended and the floods came the winds blew and beat upon the house and it fell and great was the fall I found the verse that really touched my heart but I want to share something else yesterday morning I got up early opened my Bible and I wasn't sure what God is saying I know this is not what he's talking about here in Luke it's it says in Luke 21 verse 14 I don't know if God was saying just relax but it says settle it therefore in your hearts not to meditate before what ye shall answer I open my Bible and that verse just popped out to me but the verse I um I really noticed something I've read it many times but something just stood out to me it's in it's talking about about when Jesus went out SE it the seed it I'm going to go in Luke in Luke 8 verse 11 it says now the parable is this the seed is the word of God so there's different kinds of hearts that the seat is falling on that's right verse 12 it says this is in Luke 8:12 the G by the wayside are they that hear then cometh the devil and taketh away the what out of their hearts the word isn't he a deceiver that's right he wants to take the word out of our hearts and if he can do that he has us yes sir I've read that many times but it really just chummed out to me then the devil taketh away the word out of their hearts lest they should what believe and be saved Hallelujah so does that mean if we don't have the word we can't believe that's right amen amen it doesn't say anything about join the church or go to church does it sir it's I think we're living in a time doesn't it say in Revelation that Jesus moved out of the church and is calling people to come out to him it's an individual relationship with us sir now it says some seed in verse 13 it says they on the Rock are they which when they hear receive the word with joy and these have no root which for a while believe and in time of Temptation they fall away we we see these things happening yes sir there's people that you think both they're receiving the word but there's different kinds of soil so we better let God prepare the soil so what do we have to do we have to surrender it says I think in Psalms 51 a broken and a contrite spirit oh God thou will not despise there's a lot of power in there brothers and sisters what did Paul do he said I Die daily Hallelujah the flesh has to die let's never try to make this flesh better because we can if there's something deeper inside if the Holy Spirit rests in our soul it gives us power to come overcome victories and things and let's not condemn us if we fail if if this fleshly body fails let's not condemn us cuz let's stop and think Moses failed that's right many times yes sir before God used him mightily and afterwards he hit the rock and he wasn't supposed to but he still was a man of God Amen GL Abraham says believe God and it was counted to him for righteousness that's right did he fail absolutely he did he lied he failed evidently he didn't believe God that he took Hagar for his wife caused him a lot of trouble that's right he had the promise right where is Abraham today the word of God says in heaven yes this helped me a lot let's not condemn us if we fail let's just repent and move on Amen verse 14 it says and that which fell among the Thorns are they which when they hear the word go forth and are choked with the cares and the riches and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to Perfection yes sir wow I can tell you one thing if God is working in our lives those things are starting to dimish Hallelujah they are Glory but the spiritual things are coming more and more of what we want it says walk in the spirit and ye will not fulfill the lust of the flesh so let's remember that the richest and pleasures of this life yes but it says something before that it says the cares good good would we like to take that word out of there preach brother sir Hallelujah aren't we caught sometimes in the cares of this world I am yes sir yes sir we're not always trusting God in everything are we yes sir verse 15 for some reason I got this highlighted in yellow it says but that on the good ground are they which in an honest and good heart having heard the word keep it and it bringeth forth fruit with patience Hallelujah patience patience is the fruit of the spirit that's right good brother good how many times do we pray to God we ask him but he is not answering right away right that's why we need patience Hallelujah we need patience and the Bible says tribulations work as patience good Hallelujah where would we be if God would immediately answer every prayer for us we wouldn't need patience would we that's right brother maybe God is checking us seeing if we got faith if we trust him yes yes sir Abraham it went many years till he got the promised son right Hallelujah till his prayer was answered till the promise that God gave him amen so I don't care what anybody says to you friends enemies whatever believe the word hallelujah trust God trust God Hallelujah it makes me think when Jesus was out on the boat the storm came why did the Storm come it came at the right time right Jesus fell asleep he was sleeping God wanted to show something to these people yes they awoke him what did he say what did Jesus say to his people on the boat oh ye of little faith yes that makes me think that didn't he say in another scripture if you have faith at a grain of mustard seat you can move mountains that's right now he said little faith maybe they didn't have any faith yes how big is a mustard seed very tiny but I think a lot of people have faith in the wrong thing good brother in the wrong thing a lot of people have faith in a religion yes I forget where it is but I I was reading it and it says something about other gods can we have other gods beside the true God sir sometimes in the Bible there's a capital G and sometime there's not a capital G there's a difference doesn't it say that our belly can be our God good brother that's right yes it does yes sir something that griefs me what I just read here in verse 14 the cares the riches and the pleasures of life and bring no fruit yes we can be living in that it's our choice that's right brother yes sir I see a lot of people living in pleasure just enjoying the Earthly things that's right and not aligning theirself with the word of God yes amen and I'm talking about people in my family yes sir I don't think I have to convince people to believe like I believe but I want to convince people to believe the word of God that's what I want to do turn people to Jesus Let Jesus get into their heart Hallelujah I don't have to go out and tell people quit smoking quit drinking quit running with women or running with men I don't need to tell them to do that I just need him to lead him to Jesus if Jesus gets into their heart they will repent the god that we serve can take away even the desire to smoke a cigarette or to chew tobacco that we can't even do it anymore that's the God we serve amen I don't need to offer you 50 bucks to quit smoking right I think if I do that money is my God right I'm just exposing what is in my heart if I do that if I have to pay somebody to quit sinning right I think the best thing we can do is just tell them Jesus paid for all that garbage Hallelujah Hallelujah everything in verse 16 it says no man when he has light at a candle covers it with a vessel and put us it under a bed and settle sth it but set us it on a Candlestick that they which enter in may see the light maybe that's what we need to do maybe we got to live it yes Hallelujah maybe people will start to believe once they see the light of Jesus coming out of our life Hallelujah yes I know one thing I believe more what I see in people than what they say that's right that's right that's right brother that's right so evidently that might be true for me yes I think it's true Hallelujah re question already came up did Jesus find us or did we find Jesus not everybody has experienced this SC that's right when Paul was on the road to Damascus was he looking for Jesus no sir or was Jesus looking for him right yes amen but weren't there more people with him yes they Hur the voice right yes but they didn't see anybody so that is quite a thing that happened there Paul was pretty persecuting the true Christians but when Jesus got a hold of him now let's stop and think when he heard the voice he asked Jesus who are you he said you're persecuting me was he persecuting Jesus he was persecuting God's people that's right amen so we can be careful yes Hallelujah we can be careful where is Jesus today is he sitting up in heaven or is he in our hearts yes sir I hope he's on the throne of our heart huah but coming back to Paul's experience there's a man involved there that by Marvel his name was ananas evidently his life was in line with God yes because God talked to him in a vision there's a man coming to you that needs help you you help this manlu can we do that yes can God use us Hallelujah so it looks to me if I study my Bible which the Bible says we're supposed to study the word yes it looks to me the word is the only thing that is safe to stand on that's right yes sir so this is the word of God right but if our house would catch on fire and if our Bibles would be burned would there be no word God is the word Jesus is the word hallelujah the word would still be here would still be alive that's right so how do we know that the word is actually a safe place and a sure place I'm going to turn back to Matthew chapter 4 Hallelujah we were singing a song we want to be like Jesus how many people want to be like Jesus if we believe in him we better start acting acting like him right loving our enemies forgiving people that hurt us yes sir did we like that when we sang that song Or would we love to take some of the words out of there what did Jesus do that's right the woman that came and wept and washed jesus' feet and the proud religious man not very happy that Jesus was accepting this woman what was wrong with him that's right yes sir maybe he had more sins than he realized yes that's right but Jesus said to whom who you think love us the most the person that's forgiven the most or the least and then he said the person who's forgiven the most did we give Jesus any tears to wash his feet yes hallelujah or are we like what was wrong with the Pharisees what is the Pharisee wasn't it the Pharisees that were given Jesus a rough time yes when he was walking here on Earth yes sir weren't they church people did they all die let's ask us a question did the Pharisee Spirit die no sir I think he's alive and well that's right and there's one person that I'm concerned about and that is me that I don't have that Spirit living in my life yes sir we can so easily get to that place to have a better than thou Spirit that's right because we're in the message let's talk about that this is how deceptive Satan is he tries to get you out of the denominations get you into the message why not get into the word why did God send us a prophet right we can be very careful that we don't do exactly the same thing now we're in the message church now we are in the Baptist Church it's the same thing that's right right it's the very same thing we better be in the word we better be in Jesus and Jesus in us I think the reason God send the prophet is to open the seals to reveal the tricks of the enemy what he's doing from Genesis to Revelation and God is exposing it what the devil is doing yes the churches that look so good the denomination things that look so big it is a spirit that is wrong it is the Antichrist Spirit their anti- word yes sir that's right we might as well say the truth yes sir hallelujah amen I've read this in the back in Pentecost in Acts 2 they asked they were pricked in their hearts and they asked him what shall we do then Peter being full of the Holy Ghost said repent and be baptized every one of you in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and ye shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit right is that something we can trust it's a promise yes sir I've read this it says being in Christ means receiving the baptism of the Holy Ghost yes we can go to a message church and not have the baptism of the Holy Ghost that's right brother yes sir we all need a personal relationship with God hallelujah hallelujah Satan is trying to twist things around getting people to believe if you're in so such a such a church that teach the truth you're okay you might be okay and you might not be okay that's right yes so we want to be like Jesus let's go to Matthew chapter 4 after Jesus was baptized why did he have to be baptized I thought if we when we were baptized it washed off all the sin of our life and Jesus wasn't a sinner that's right but he was obedient Hallelujah baptism doesn't wash sin away today for us we need to repent and believe in the blood of Jesus christall Paid For All sin sir paid for all healings Hallelujah in Matthew 4 it says then was Jesus led up of the spirit Into the Wilderness to be tempted of the devil and when he had fasted 40 days and 40 nights he was afterwards a hunger when The Temper came to him he said if thou be the Son of God command that these Stones be made bread did we ever notice if thou be the son of God sounds to me like the same spirit that came to Eve in the Garden of Eden try to get her well maybe did we ever have that come to us well maybe we don't have to do this or maybe this is okay and we knew that the word said something different yes sir yes sir so if something is Twisted is it from God or the devil it's from the devil yes just twist it the devil likes to take truth and twisted that's right what did Jesus say in verse four he answered and said it is written man shall not live by bread alone but by every word yes that proceed us out of the mouth of God God so Jesus came back to the word yes so do you think it will work for us that's right I think that's the only thing that will work for us yes hallelujah we're living in a time I don't want to scare anybody but we want to stay with the word that is the only thing that's going to stand Hallelujah that's a safe place to be we we we better have our anger down on the Rock Glory that's right because sand it would be a lot easier just build on the sand build on religion wouldn't that be easier it would just fit in with a group right go to church sing a couple songs go home and live however you want to right have pleasure yes verse 5 it says then the devil taketh him up into a holy city and Seth in on the pentacle of the temple and sayth unto him if thou be the Son of God there he does it again cast thyself down for it is written he shall give his angels charge concerning thee and in their hands they shall bear thee up lest at any time thou Dash thy foot against the stone Jesus said unto him it is written again Thou shalt not tempt the Lord thy God hallelujah I love it the devil can't do anything about the word can he that's right Hallelujah sounds to me like a pretty big rock yes sir verse S Jesus said un no again 8 the devil taketh him up into an exceedingly high mountain and shows him all the kingdoms of the world and the glory of them and says unto them all these things will I give thee if thou will fall down and worship me then sayth Jesus unto him get thee hands Satan for it is written Thou shalt Worship the Lord thy God and him only shall thou serve then the devil leaveth him and behold the Angels Came and ministered unto him him Hallelujah so there's our example yes Hallelujah so we have the word to stand on are we going to go through tribulations trials we will but didn't it Paul go through a lot of Trials I think I read this morning in Acts it says that they even stoned him and Drug him out of the city one day they thought he was dead how many of us people would go back to a church and preach if we'd be treated like that that's right that's right I would like to have more of whatever Paul had more of what Jesus this yes sir Hallelujah so I think and I believe Paul knew where he was standing yes sir why did he because if we read in Ephesians it said it was revealed to him from God that's right he knew where he stands the Gates of Hell couldn't Prevail against it the enemies the the wicked people the ious people tried to destroy him but God used him mightily Hallelujah it says I have fought a good fight I've have kept the faith yes Paul kept the faith yes and he received the crown Hallelujah but it says behind there it is not to him only but to all that love his appearing hallah amen thank you Lord so talking about the good ground spring is just around the corner the way it looks the farmers knows how it is to go out get the soils ready to plant and if we are a good farmer or a ladies a good Gardener we will not go and plant seats on our driveway and think there's something going to come up right for Harvest are we or go out in the woods where a lot of trees are and rocks and plant there but we usually try to find a good spot where the soil is dark and black and we work the soil and and then we put the seed in the ground Hallelujah that's our job yes but the Lord gives the increase Hallelujah yes wonderful last summer God put us through a drought where things didn't want to grow anymore pastors turned brown we had to feed hay to the cows so I was thinking what was God what is he telling us what is he teaching us we need rain we need sunshine in our lives don't we Hallelujah yes if every day would be cloudy and rainy how many depressed people would be walking around on The Thirst if the sun wouldn't come up in the morning yes but what if the sun would be up every day bright and shining and no rain right maybe this will help us to see our life maybe God will take us to a trial to test us to try our Fai see we're going to trust him Hallelujah he does he did Abraham he did Noah Moses they went through a lot of Trials yes sir it's amazing to me that God could use the man Moses not didn't he kill a person I used to believe if somebody would kill a person he should probably be in prison the rest of his life maybe I'm not understanding God like I should I'm understanding one thing God is got a lot of Grace for us yes thank God thank God how do we know that didn't he uh about the Fig Tree he gave him a couple years time that's right yes what kind of a lesson can we get out of this fig tree he came to get fruit and there was no fruit on it but it had leaves right is that how we are do we just have leaves or is there fruit coming out of our Lives Hallelujah did he immediately condemn the tree no he didn't he had patience he had Grace how many people are glad that God had Grace on our lives thankes I am Hallelujah and I trust he's got enough Grace to bring me home Hallelujah I need his grace every day brothers and sisters so I think sometimes we struggle believing maybe we're not good enough we would like to be like Jesus but we're not quite there yet that's right so doesn't the bible teach us that we were supposed to grow in Grace yes this little baby that was dead at this morning is not a woman that's right it's a baby we were all babies yes sir we grow up in adulthood right it took what 20 years maybe 40 years maybe 60 years to try to get us God's still working on us still chipping on us isn't he yes so let's give God time to work on us let's not condemn us right away if we're not where we want to be yes sir Hallelujah I think that's from the enemy trying to get us to doubt that we're on the right way that's right I love it to know that we are on the right way but we're not there yet yes but as long as we're going on the right road on the narrow road it's as straight as the path to the narrow road and that's the road we want to walk on yes Lord and by grace of God we can walk walk on that road if the storms and Trials come we can still walk on that road yes sometimes if we're driving down the freeway 70 M hour and this just happened yesterday or the other day the wind came and it it pushed the car a little bit but we kept right on going we didn't run into the ditch yes and that's the way trials and things come up we keep on going we keep our focus on Jesus hallelujah we're not to look back if we look in the mirror always to see what's behind us we'll probably end up in the ditch that's right that's right sometimes it's good if we have our wife in the passage seat to watch the road while we're watching scenery I've learned one thing usually where you're looking is where you're going that's right brother my wife is growing she drove about 2/3 of the way up to Dober and I was fairly relaxed Hallelujah and I think she was more relaxed than she was a couple years ago so I hope the more we mature in Christ the more relaxed we can be on this journey my mind goes back to the children of Israel when they put the blood on the door PL post they're in Egypt what did that repres God told them to do it right is what's instructions God gave them so they believed the word of God and they put the blood on the door post on the top but what was that sign that was a token they had but it was a sign that the people on the inside of the house believed in God what is our token the token is the life life of God in us yes the life of God in us is the token Hallelujah it makes me think of Rahab the Harlot isn't it something how Jesus accepted these harlots into his kingdom yes sir yes sir because he paid the price to forgiven yes sir I'm glad he did yes amen weren't we doing the same things following a different God instead of the Living God right we were living in adultery right God help us to keep focused on our living God Jesus our savior Hallelujah the price is paid we were talking about the word there's a lot of scripture to read from it says in uh acts 2:41 it says they well I'm going to read in 40 and with many words did he testifying sword saying save yourself from this unto word generation then it says in verse 41 in Acts 2 it says they that gladly received the word were baptized and the same day we're added unto them about 3,000 souls and they continued steadfastly in the apostles Doctrine Fellowship in breaking bread and in prayer so once the spirit of God is living in us it will cause us to follow his ways Hallelujah yes sir we want to it says use not your Liberty as an occasion to the flesh but by love serve one another Wonder wonderful so how we treat each other is very important yes sir yes sir we're not here to condemn people we're here to help people yes sir Hallelujah there's a lot of people walking around that are in bondage people that are going to church people that are not going to church going to church doesn't get us out of bondage right oh I thought that's a good place to be in church but we do go to church if we're a true Christian that's right yes sir lift our praises to our Savior pise God bless him praise Him Hallelujah have fellowship with each other encourage each other pray for each other yes the power of prayer Glory in second Peter chapter 1 verse 5 it says besides this giving diligence what does he say in here add to your face virtue and to Virtue knowledge so that sounds to me we are to have faith in God and now it says we're to add the things to it yes amen so maybe once the first day we believ we didn't have all this evidently not that's right I think it's by the grace of God that we can believe yes sir I think God put a seed in us so we can believe right verse six it says and to knowledge Temperance and to Temperance patient there comes the word patient again and to patience godliness and to Godliness brotherly kindness and to brotherly kindness charity wow we're not going to stop there there's a promise here we want to see it Hallelujah for if these things be in you and abond they make you that ye shall neither be Barren nor unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ I think that's a promise we can stand on that's the word of God so let's have it in our lives hallelujah amen oh there's another verse here that we need to read but he that lackes these things what's wrong with him he's blind and it says he can't even see very far wow that'd be a dangerous place to be but it doesn't stop there it says and has has forgotten that he was perched from his old sins right wow anybody here today that is believing that he might not be forgiven I believe all sin is Forgiven Hallelujah past present future hallelujah it's paid for God can I believe that what is the number one sin unbelief that's why the children of Israel most of them couldn't enter the land of promise because of unbelief I'm glad that there were a couple that could Hallelujah Josh and Caleb had a right Spirit right so maybe that what was wrong we need a right Spirit within us so we can believe and trust God yes Josh and Caleb they've seen some things over there that didn't look like just minor little things they saw giants and stuff didn't they yes they did but wor did they have their trust in the Lord Jesus Christ hallelujah hallelujah in the same God that little David that destroyed the giant I think we need to destroy Giants that come up in our life yes sir sir not by our strength and our muscles but through trusting God yes sir GL and one of the Giants is that the enemy wants to bring to us is doubt fear yes believing lies believing I'm not good enough right maybe I'm not forgiven the Bible's pretty clear that we can be forgiven and if he sets us free we are free indeed it says ye shall know the truth and the truth shall make you free sometimes we just quote part of the verse but it says ye shall know the truth the truth is the word yes and that will make you free we don't need to walk around in bondage we sang a song like that didn't we I know the weight that went off my back and my shoulders when I turned to Christ Hallelujah Glory there were sins that I was struggling with in my life that never came up again not because of me not because of me but greater is he that is in you than he that is in the world I love it but I had to humble myself and repent and believe Hallelujah Glory if it worked for me it will work for all of you prise the Lord it makes me think of the the 10 virgins they were called to come out right yes who were they supposed to meet the bridegroom where were they coming out of it looks to me like they were church people weren't they yes sir it says five of them were wise yes so what were the difference five of them were wise and five were foolish but they were all virgins yes sir the wives came out they were ready to meet their bridegroom right yes they have the oil represents the Holy Spirit right that's right so they had it the cry was made I think the cry is made today too the cry is here sir come out to meet the bridegroom Hallelujah I think that's our protection today the bridegroom is right here on Earth in human bodies yes Hallelujah and I think he's going to take care of his people Satan deceived many people but there is an elect that are not going to be deceived this time the very elect won't be deceived because they have the oil in their lamps yes Hallelujah the foolish one that they had get oil from the others but they couldn't isn't that how it is with us I can't get my salvation from Chessie that's right or from Howard or John that's right I can't do that yes go go to Jesus and get it yourself hallu hallelujah it's free my Bible says it's free Glory the living water is free for all who want it hallelujah praise God thank you Jesus thank you Lord we had a guy come to our church prob three and a half four years ago and he sat beside me and I at one time I wouldn't have wanted to sit beside a person like that why was divorc but I learned something from that guy there's a verse here that he claimed and we can find it in Philippians 4:13 this is something if I think of that man I think of this verse I can do all things through Christ which strengthens meall I've noticed he was trusting God even for his work to make a living I've had to repent many times already in the last couple years and before that repentance is a change of mind Hallelujah that's what Jesus wanted the scribes and the Pharisees to do he wanted them to have a change of mindah I look at people different from what what I did because God made all of them sometimes we meet people maybe in town or at gas stations maybe they need prayer I was with a guy one time last year we were down Logan a gas station and he talked with a a guy in the gas station he was struggling and when he came out he said I want to pray with this guy and when he came out he went out and asked if he could pray for him and we prayed for him right there in front of the gas station this guy was troubled he had tattoos over his body I need Jesus and he needs Jesus no difference that's right no difference Hallelujah God in verse 19 it says my God shall supply all your needs according to his riches in Glory by Christ Jesus do we believe that yes we could change one one word my God shall supply all your wants according to his it's not what it says I think sometimes we get our wants and our needs that's why we need to grow in grace to get our wants and our needs in order that's why we need Christ God so I see I need to Die daily and yield to God so he can have his way in my life Hallelujah that's very important yes it is so we got to come to the feet of Jesus yes sir yes sir I want to share one more thing if we read in The Book of Ruth I don't understand all this but I think I got a a revelation of something there with Ruth and boas a kinsman redeemer neom and her two daughter-in-laws were widows right and Ruth had made a choice to go with Naoma wherever she went [Music] thy people will be my people thy God will be my god look what happened she went out in the field to pick up grain that the Reapers didn't get right but was it I think it was in boas field and he if I remember right he told the Reapers to let some more grain lay there so she could have it I think we need that also we need some of that bread too from Heaven don't we Hallelujah but this is what I want to point out I think we all want to be the bride of Christ right yes Hallelujah this is the last thought I want to share what did Ruth do she was a virgin there was men out there gleaning but she was a virgin and she was safe but at night after they had boas had eaten he went and laid down to sleep where did Ruth lay down at the feet of boas our carnal nature think whoa what's going on here but this is a spiritual lesson where is the bride of Christ we lay oursel down at the feet of Jesus at midnight Bo awoke and see there's a woman laying at his feet this is a spiritual lesson Ruth wanted boas to cover her with his skirt isn't that what we want Jesus to do for us we want Jesus to cover oursel with his skirt Hallelujah yes Lord and boas ended up marrying her later yes and that's where Jesse and David isn't that wonderful hallelujah hallelujah I want to encourage all of us let's stand on the word of God if the enemy comes to try to get us to doubt to twist things it is written this is what the word of God says and let's stand on it that's the only thing that's going to stand yes and let's lay oursel at the feet of Jesus thank you for his grace let's stand for prayer Heavenly Father we thank you for your grace and your love for us Lord I ask that you would just pour your love out in every heart today thank you Lord for being here hallelujah thank you Lord for living in our hearts thank you for ripping the veil thank you Jesus yes Lord we ask that you would lead and guide and direct us as we move on our journey Lord give us Grace to believe and Lord give us more Revelation and more wisdom whatever we need Lord help us to walk in your ways Lord we ask to keep a hch around every one of us and we ask that your blessings could just flow out over everybody's lives we pray this in Jesus holy name amen am for [Music]
