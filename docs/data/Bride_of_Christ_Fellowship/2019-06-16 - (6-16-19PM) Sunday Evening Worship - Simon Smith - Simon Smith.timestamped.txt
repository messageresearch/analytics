[34:36] [Applause]
[34:44] [Music]
[34:55] [Music]
[35:13] hey man thanks
[35:15] praise Lord you may be seated I'm I
[35:19] don't sing too much and I can carry a
[35:23] tune when I'm next to somebody mostly
[35:25] I've done a couple song specials but
[35:28] they're far view between and struggled
[35:31] and stumbled through them by God's grace
[35:36] so this morning we taught on the
[35:38] Antichrist spirit ways to look at
[35:41] identify it we want to obviously want to
[35:45] do our best to sit on always we want to
[35:52] do our best to identify the Antichrist
[35:54] spirit seek the mind of God and do our
[35:57] very best we can so I heard through the
[36:02] grapevine a little thought a brother a
[36:05] head and I thought on and I thought on
[36:07] it I thought it was it's very simple but
[36:09] I think I taught just at home on
[36:12] Wednesday by the grace of God and I went
[36:15] well very well so we went to hopefully
[36:17] Lord will be a blessing here again
[36:18] tonight
[36:19] I think our pastor Jesse there for
[36:21] inviting us out and being with us so if
[36:25] you want we stand here ever the reading
[36:28] of the word by the grace of God
[36:31] simple little thought if we're going to
[36:35] go through the three passages of
[36:38] Scripture by grace by the grace of God
[36:40] in Matthew 728
[36:54] since God as the rapture draws near we
[36:56] want to have our we want to have full
[37:00] understanding full revelation ready to
[37:06] go at a moment's notice
[37:08] spiritually speaking and if you think
[37:13] about everything that's going on in the
[37:14] world today there's always a spiritual
[37:17] type in the natural we have Preppers
[37:19] they're storing food there's a Malaysia
[37:22] ammunition and guns escape routes and
[37:24] but in the spiritual we are also
[37:27] Preppers and we were eating the Word of
[37:30] God we have our Bible full of nuggets we
[37:34] have Prayer speaking the word spiritual
[37:37] warfare all those things so as you think
[37:41] on everything natural that comes to you
[37:44] there's a spiritual reason so here in
[37:46] Matthew 7 verse 28 he says and it came
[37:50] to pass when Jesus had ended these
[37:53] sayings the people were astonished at
[37:55] his doctrine for he taught them as one
[37:59] having Authority and not as the scribes
[38:02] who is this man why is he speaking in
[38:06] such a way
[38:08] go to Matthew 13 verse 54 Matthew 13
[38:18] verse 54 and when he was come into his
[38:23] own country he taught them in their
[38:25] synagogue in so much that they were
[38:27] astonished and said whence has man this
[38:31] wisdom who was this guy who is this guy
[38:34] he says and these mighty works not only
[38:37] could he speak in such a way and act in
[38:41] such a way but power signs wonders and
[38:44] miracles follow as well he says and now
[38:47] here's as investors verse 45 is not this
[38:50] the carpenter's son isn't that not his
[38:53] mother his mother called Mary and his
[38:56] brother and James and Jose's or josie's
[39:01] and Simon and Judas and his sisters are
[39:04] they not all here
[39:05] with us whence hath this man all these
[39:08] things so they're confounded by this man
[39:11] Jesus they're compounded by Christ one
[39:15] more set of scriptures here in Matthew 5
[39:17] verse 48 the Bible says be ye therefore
[39:24] perfect even as your father which is in
[39:29] heaven is perfect
[39:32] so let's bow our heads this evening here
[39:36] do you have the father Lord Jesus we
[39:39] just love you Lord Lord we're not tossed
[39:43] around by every wind of stranger
[39:45] doctrine Lord where Lord we were not
[39:48] even concerned about this life Lord and
[39:51] nor with though some may be short here
[39:53] or lacking here or a loved one here or
[39:56] Lord there's a concern maybe a little
[39:59] anxious desiring their heart Lord Lord
[40:02] we're not worried Lord Lord we we see
[40:06] the devil coming in like a flood Lord
[40:09] but Lord you promised in your word Lord
[40:11] to be a standard guard Lord he would
[40:13] raise up
[40:22] Lord and we just love your Lord and
[40:25] Norway we just be so humble over here
[40:27] and may take full control of Lord my
[40:30] little mouth here God and tongue Lord
[40:32] and and Lord just bless the people or be
[40:34] the here may they just catch the
[40:36] revelation the very thought here we're
[40:37] trying to express Lord we love you so
[40:39] much Lord bless the people Lord in the
[40:41] name of Jesus Christ amen
[40:43] you may have your seats so today tonight
[40:46] here we want to speak on be perfect in
[40:54] this a just the end of the end time is
[40:57] far spent I was at home preaching this
[41:04] and I raised my hand I said are you guys
[41:07] gonna give up
[41:08] anyone here ready to give up fold up
[41:11] just head on back into the world do the
[41:14] things this can't this came to me the
[41:19] other day my sister had went to a search
[41:20] and I believe was like a a wedding or
[41:22] something there was DJ's there playing
[41:24] and come to find out as we come into the
[41:27] Word of God and the truth the our many
[41:31] men brothers and sisters of faith at
[41:35] that time we witnessed to them and they
[41:37] rejected it and the Bible says when you
[41:40] reject the Word of God you you you
[41:43] wander into darkness and at this wedding
[41:46] or wherever they were at there was some
[41:47] DJ's playing and here they were
[41:49] Christian DJ's in the name of the the DJ
[41:52] thing was divine symphony or divine
[41:54] inspirations or something like that and
[41:56] here they're playing ac/dc they're
[41:58] playing Metallica they're playing all
[42:00] these things and yet they're Christian
[42:02] DJ artists so it shows that the world
[42:06] the Christian nominal Christian world is
[42:09] not living the truth I've been in the
[42:12] trades now a construction for almost 15
[42:15] 16 years I'm sorry
[42:18] 18 years almost now and in that course
[42:22] of span of working in the construction
[42:24] I'm at one Christian true true Christian
[42:28] as far as the majority Christians I meet
[42:31] they're they still they still cuss and
[42:34] swear til dirty Joe
[42:35] they drink socially they my smoker
[42:39] cigarette here are there they live just
[42:41] like the world listen to ungodly music
[42:44] and those things but one man I didn't
[42:46] meet and I watched him the entire job I
[42:48] watched him and looked over him and
[42:50] tried him and I seen when he was next to
[42:52] someone who told a bad joke and he he
[42:54] didn't even crack a smile and I thought
[42:56] that was a gallant of him and remarkable
[42:59] for even in a sanctified state you know
[43:03] did a tremendous job and I at the end of
[43:06] job I walked to him I said John Babcock
[43:07] I said you're a real Christian and I
[43:09] shook his hand and he said thank you
[43:11] brother Simon I said I watched you and I
[43:14] said you're clean he said thank you
[43:15] brother so I appreciate that so anyhow
[43:21] we want to preach on on be there perfect
[43:24] a thought had common and in first
[43:30] Corinthians two if we could let's turn
[43:32] to 1st Corinthians 2 verse 6 the Bible
[43:36] says here st. Paul the prophet of that
[43:39] day that one that packed packed the Word
[43:41] of God that understand and had the
[43:44] revelation of Jesus Christ in his day
[43:46] look how he starts this he says howbeit
[43:48] we speak wisdom among them that are
[43:51] perfect how many here is perfect by the
[43:54] grace of God we know perfect is not in
[43:58] the flesh perfect is not in the spirit
[44:01] realm but it's down into the soul of the
[44:03] Holy Ghost believer and that's what
[44:05] we're looking and that's what we're
[44:06] talking about this morning he says
[44:08] howbeit we speak the wisdom among them
[44:10] that are perfect yet not the wisdom of
[44:12] this world saints of God it
[44:14] scientifically it doesn't matter a
[44:16] medically a does not matter we're
[44:19] talking about spiritual perfection here
[44:22] he says he says uh yet not the wisdom of
[44:25] this world nor the prison's world that
[44:27] come to naught he says all these things
[44:30] come there still finding scientific
[44:33] discoveries that are being disprove of
[44:35] old science they had see they think this
[44:39] happens and that happens and this takes
[44:40] root but every day there's a new
[44:42] scientific discovery and they have to
[44:45] rewrite now their science books so they
[44:46] should be he says but we speak the
[44:48] wisdom of
[44:49] in a mystery he says even the hidden
[44:51] wisdom which God ordained before the
[44:54] world unto our glory which none of the
[44:56] princes of this world knew for had they
[44:58] had known it they would not have
[44:59] crucified the Lord of glory right he
[45:03] says now in verse 9 he says but as it is
[45:05] written eye hath not seen he says as nor
[45:09] ear heard neither have loved into the
[45:11] enter have entered into the heart of man
[45:13] the things which God hath before
[45:15] prepared for them that love him see so
[45:19] in our greatest understanding we cannot
[45:22] understand what Jesus Christ has for us
[45:25] over there up beyond or up in heaven as
[45:28] we pass through the heavenly portals
[45:30] these earthly portals moving into the
[45:32] heavenly ones we cannot end as a as I
[45:34] taught back home there and have you ever
[45:36] seen doctor Kent Hovind he's old
[45:39] creation the Evangelist he said he said
[45:42] now he says maybe we if we cross over
[45:44] there he says what do you think about
[45:45] colors he says new colors have noises
[45:49] your colors smell up there is there more
[45:53] colors we know by the the scientific
[45:56] spectrum of light eases or frequencies
[45:59] there's only a certain portion and we
[46:00] can actually see of the the waves there
[46:03] okay the light waves but but the
[46:05] majority we cannot see he says what if
[46:07] there's new colors show me a new color
[46:09] we could put purple and blue and pink
[46:14] together but but that would not be what
[46:15] I'm talking about we're talking about
[46:17] something heavenly up there there's
[46:19] things we can't even imagine or even
[46:20] comprehend with our mortal minds right
[46:22] he says but God has revealed to live
[46:24] unto us our spirit for the spirit
[46:26] searches all things yea the deep things
[46:29] of God he saw so if God has his plan and
[46:32] he's up there and he's only revealed a
[46:35] very important of his plan here that
[46:37] shows that he goes much much much more
[46:40] deeper than we can even comprehend over
[46:42] here correct a man he says for what man
[46:45] knoweth the things of man save the
[46:47] spirit of Man which is in him even so
[46:49] the things of God knoweth no man he said
[46:51] we can't even understand the true nature
[46:54] of God he says but the Spirit of God he
[46:57] says now we have received not the spirit
[46:59] of world but the spirit which is of God
[47:01] that we might know the
[47:02] things that are freely given to us of
[47:04] God so the things that he give us he
[47:07] said now there are he's does anything
[47:09] get in freely he says we could keep him
[47:11] absolutely he said but only those things
[47:13] that he gives correct he says which
[47:15] things we also also we speak not in the
[47:18] word is in words that which man's wisdom
[47:20] teaches but which the Holy Ghost teaches
[47:24] comparing spiritual things with
[47:25] spiritual everything you know everything
[47:31] you were heard bring it back to a
[47:33] spiritual sense you must to be perfect
[47:40] you must be spiritual we were born in
[47:44] these fleshly bodies in this fleshly
[47:46] world to snatch your world but we must
[47:48] now a sand into something heavenly
[47:52] saints of God every natural battle
[47:56] battle you see is caused by a spirit as
[48:00] they were confounded with Jesus Christ
[48:04] why were they confounded to Jesus Christ
[48:05] they're hearing something they've never
[48:07] heard before they're seeing something
[48:10] they've never seen before
[48:12] correct a man he says that which also
[48:15] things we speak not in words of man's
[48:17] wisdom teaches but with the Holy Ghost
[48:19] teaches comparing spiritual things with
[48:22] spiritual he says but the natural man
[48:24] receiveth not the things of the Spirit
[48:27] of God if you remain in a natural state
[48:32] if you keep your carnal mind right here
[48:35] present and never ascent into a higher
[48:37] thought into a higher understanding
[48:40] you'll remain a carnal believer you'll
[48:43] remain a carnal Christian right but in
[48:47] order to receive these spiritual things
[48:50] you must receive the baptism of the Holy
[48:53] Ghost and I heard someone just recently
[48:57] preached this he said brother he says
[48:59] maybe we've been preaching the Holy
[49:01] Ghost all wrong how what do we teach
[49:05] here in this message if you repented me
[49:08] baptize in the name of Jesus Christ you
[49:11] shall receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[49:14] everyone that comes and here's this word
[49:16] and God reveals and open up that mystery
[49:19] and is baptized in the name of Lord
[49:21] Jesus Christ do they all receive the
[49:23] Holy Ghost they don't many have left
[49:29] come and go as they please
[49:32] the Bible prophesies of a foolish virgin
[49:35] well I thought the Bible said then if
[49:38] you repent ameba ties in the name of
[49:41] Jesus Christ for their missionary sins
[49:42] you shall receive the gift of the Holy
[49:45] Ghost and the man said he said this he
[49:54] said there's a one throne room in your
[49:55] heart there's an open little void that
[49:59] science is even proven is open and
[50:00] there's no blood in there no blood
[50:02] vessels is a little chamber in your
[50:03] heart is for the Soul and if you never
[50:06] put Christ on the throne room of you if
[50:09] you never open that if you never take
[50:11] yourself off the throne room of your
[50:14] heart you'll never enter in why because
[50:17] we baptism represents a death we bury
[50:20] dead people
[50:22] and when I was baptized I went down as
[50:26] dead as I could but it was not until a
[50:28] year and a half later I received a full
[50:30] baptism of the Holy Ghost amen yes Lord
[50:35] now see so what we must die out to
[50:39] ourselves fully the reason people do not
[50:42] receive the Holy Ghost the full baptism
[50:44] of the Holy Ghost is because they never
[50:45] let Christ in the throne room Lord have
[50:49] thy perfect will in perfect way I looked
[50:51] at my than one of the other forms of the
[50:53] job and I said Jeff I said and I told
[50:57] him that same little thought there I
[50:58] said it Jeff em you were seeing the Holy
[50:59] Ghost I said I said would you be willing
[51:02] if God told you told you to go to
[51:04] Thailand would you be willing to go he's
[51:07] like I don't know I don't know he says
[51:11] he you can go he'd go he's not ready to
[51:13] die out yet oh my now he says but he
[51:18] that a spiritual judgeth all things yet
[51:21] he himself is judged of no man see so if
[51:24] you're spiritually minded you can judge
[51:27] all things as a very
[51:29] but we have the mind of Christ to be
[51:34] therefore perfect you must have the mind
[51:36] of Christ we must elevate it's time
[51:42] brother just when we were in the world
[51:43] and that we were just was pretty big in
[51:45] basketball I play basketball I practice
[51:47] basketball I love playing basketball but
[51:49] there's a sayings that elevate and
[51:50] decide in the air well I didn't have
[51:55] much hang time but I did I did decide
[51:57] lot of things before I jumped in after I
[51:59] jumped but here we must decide before we
[52:04] get in the air amen he says but we have
[52:06] the very mind of Christ he rose rich and
[52:14] not to the world I work with a man he's
[52:19] in the outlaw motorcycle club he's in
[52:21] the outlaws and he's a one-percenter
[52:22] which is the one of the highest you can
[52:24] get in that Club will he ever read the
[52:26] Bible probably not if I witness to him
[52:29] absolutely the Bible is not written for
[52:36] unbelievers it's written for believers
[52:38] but if you search the scripture there's
[52:40] two kinds of people that God is dealing
[52:43] with in this Bible there's the spiritual
[52:46] and there is the carnal there's the
[52:48] there's the Holy Ghost field and there's
[52:51] one still caught in the flesh and we
[52:54] want to discern which ones we are we
[52:56] want to because remember only the Bride
[52:59] of Christ will make this rapture correct
[53:01] and Romans 8 for he says he says that
[53:04] the righteousness of the law might be
[53:05] fulfilled in us who walk not after the
[53:08] flesh after it so we must want every day
[53:12] wake up say our prayers what pray our
[53:14] prayers and read the scripture what he
[53:16] says he says and then what we must walk
[53:18] in the spirit for they that are after
[53:20] the flesh do mind the things of the
[53:22] flesh he says but they that are after
[53:24] the spirit the things of the Spirit for
[53:27] to be carnally minded is death but to be
[53:30] spiritually minded is life and peace
[53:32] because the carnal mind is enmity
[53:35] against God for is not subject to the
[53:37] law of God neither indeed can be
[53:39] so they that are in the flesh cannot
[53:42] God here Paul is identifying two kinds
[53:45] of believers
[53:46] there's carnal believers and a Holy
[53:47] Ghost filled believers there's spiritual
[53:49] believers and then there's flesh
[53:51] believers a man sure and of course we
[53:55] know he says now yeah but you're not in
[53:57] the flesh if but in the spirit if so be
[54:01] that the Spirit of God dwelling you here
[54:03] how many here have their baptism of the
[54:04] Holy Ghost we are believing that we have
[54:07] the baptism the Holy Ghost and if you
[54:09] have the bathroom the Holy Ghost you
[54:11] must now start if you have not already
[54:13] which we believe we have we must now
[54:15] elevate our minds into the spiritual
[54:18] realm okay now in Philippians 2 verse 1
[54:22] here
[54:24] he says if there be any be there for any
[54:28] consolation in Christ if any comfort of
[54:31] love if any fellowship of the Spirit if
[54:33] any bowels and mercies fulfill ye my joy
[54:36] that ye might be like-minded having the
[54:38] same love being of one Accord or one
[54:41] mind he says these wonderful beautiful
[54:46] words here he says let nothing be done
[54:50] through strife and vainglory but in
[54:52] lowliness of mind let each esteem other
[54:55] better than themselves listen if we can
[54:59] come in contact with one another we must
[55:01] lift the other one up you're the great
[55:04] one your higher Eman you're you're the
[55:06] one that God I'm here to serve
[55:07] absolutely he says and he then he says
[55:10] he says let not let not other every
[55:13] earth look not every man on his own
[55:15] things but every man also on the things
[55:17] of others he says let this mind be in
[55:19] you which was also in Christ Jesus
[55:23] Christ came and did the exact same thing
[55:26] for you and I he says who being in the
[55:29] form of God thought it not robbery to be
[55:32] equal with God this is also in her mind
[55:35] you have to be spiritually minded to
[55:39] catch right here let this mind be in you
[55:43] which was in also in Christ Jesus who
[55:45] being in the form of God thought it not
[55:48] robbery to be equal with God equal with
[55:51] God as far as Authority the
[55:55] weapon jury spiritually the same the
[55:58] same garments as far as his
[56:01] righteousness the same favors the same
[56:05] sonship all of God he says but made
[56:08] himself of no reputation and took upon
[56:10] him the form of the servant amen and was
[56:13] made in the likeness of men a man sure
[56:16] we have to have this very mind okay now
[56:21] moving on here in Psalms 40 verse 4 it
[56:29] says blessed is that a man that maketh
[56:31] the Lord his trust and respected not the
[56:33] proud nor such as turn aside unto lies
[56:36] her to lies he says many O Lord are my
[56:39] god are they wonderful works which thou
[56:42] has done and thy thoughts which are to
[56:46] us word if God has his mind and it's
[56:50] deeper than deep and he has these
[56:52] thoughts about us he said is it he said
[56:55] he said he's in other words God has all
[56:57] these wonderful things he's thinking
[56:59] about us right he has all these
[57:02] wonderful things he wants to share with
[57:04] us they are caught up what in the very
[57:06] mind of God they cannot be reckoned up
[57:08] in order lunch knee if they would
[57:10] declare to speak of them for they more
[57:12] than can be numbered saints of God if we
[57:13] were to draw a circle right now in front
[57:15] in the air here and you would be able
[57:17] and I was like that's all within the
[57:20] circles all of your thoughts I say all
[57:22] knowledge if everything that could be
[57:25] known on the earth was in this circle
[57:27] how much would you know just maybe a
[57:30] little sliver of that circle would be
[57:33] your intelligence do it how many here
[57:35] knows all the plumbing code how many
[57:39] know is here to teach children maybe
[57:41] just how many here knows the electrical
[57:43] code how many knows botany all botany
[57:46] life ornithology who knows Oliver thorn
[57:51] ornithologist study of birds huh I don't
[57:54] I don't know all that see so we're very
[57:57] limited in what we understand and what
[57:58] we know but the Bible says God he's the
[58:01] creator of all things he knows all these
[58:03] things amen it confounds many in Psalms
[58:06] 92 verse 5 O Lord how
[58:08] great other works and the thoughts are
[58:10] very deep amen
[58:12] science still refuses to believe that
[58:15] God created all nature they still reject
[58:18] you they might but even if they look at
[58:20] the smallest thing it's so complex sure
[58:23] the various sale the may I'm me by the
[58:25] way
[58:26] single-celled organisms more complex
[58:28] almost than a human being even though
[58:30] they can dwell within us sure uh now
[58:33] here in in isaiah 55:6 seek either lower
[58:37] while he may be fine but be found he
[58:40] says he says call upon how on upon him
[58:42] while he was near let the wicked forsake
[58:45] his way and the unrighteous man his
[58:47] thoughts amen
[58:49] saints of God is this not the time to
[58:51] call on Jesus Christ the world is
[58:53] falling apart
[58:55] sister when he said all of Hong Kong is
[58:57] an uproar they're called they're trying
[58:59] to pass laws you can deport anyone
[59:02] whether it's false accuser nor true
[59:04] acute accusation wherever they can
[59:06] deport you back to China and then he's
[59:07] then you're pretty much done you're in
[59:10] China's courts then I just saw a thing
[59:13] on Facebook every five minutes a
[59:16] Christian is martyred and a lot of them
[59:19] in China saints of God this is a serious
[59:23] battle the Bible says when you're in
[59:24] prayer he says pray for the ones
[59:26] overseas that are in bounds that are
[59:28] inbound and going through all kinds of
[59:30] hardships Saints absolutely he says he
[59:32] so see we must seek the Lord while he is
[59:34] near ye may be found he says let the
[59:36] wicked forsake his way and the
[59:37] unrighteous man his thoughts he said we
[59:39] must get away from these carnal thoughts
[59:40] okay he says in lay him return unto the
[59:43] Lord and He will have mercy upon him and
[59:45] to our God and He will pardon abundantly
[59:48] pardon
[59:49] he says for my thoughts are not your
[59:51] thoughts he says neither are you my he
[59:53] says your ways of my ways saith the LORD
[59:55] for as the heavens are higher than the
[59:58] earth so are my ways higher than your
[1:00:00] ways and my thoughts than your thoughts
[1:00:03] since we must understand we have to
[1:00:07] think like Christ how many spiritual
[1:00:11] here any spiritual
[1:00:14] I mean really understand the word let me
[1:00:17] see so now as we go into the word of God
[1:00:25] the logos was made flesh he come down
[1:00:29] onto the earth and this is very simple
[1:00:32] you know why I love and November they
[1:00:35] think about this now the Bible is the
[1:00:37] Bible is the Word of God right it is all
[1:00:39] the thoughts of God now one thing I love
[1:00:42] about the Bible is that Christ the Bible
[1:00:45] was written and he did not just include
[1:00:47] himself what if there is a Bible what if
[1:00:49] the by what if got her in the Bible and
[1:00:51] was all just about him it was all just
[1:00:54] about his majesty nasgo I wish there
[1:00:56] isn't contained in there it's think it's
[1:00:58] contained in there but he was so good
[1:01:01] that he included Abraham and and Adam
[1:01:04] and Eve and he included Moses and all
[1:01:07] these wonderful brothers and sisters of
[1:01:09] us absolutely he included all those he
[1:01:11] shared his glory with us he put those
[1:01:15] things in there but now if you look here
[1:01:18] in Matthew 4 verse 1 for thousands of
[1:01:29] years the Old Testament was the law the
[1:01:32] Old Testament is the way of living eye
[1:01:35] for an eye a tooth for a tooth
[1:01:38] it was completely carnal it showed you
[1:01:42] it it told them how to live naturally
[1:01:45] the natural Commandments were here then
[1:01:48] that do this naturally do this naturally
[1:01:50] do not do this naturally do not do this
[1:01:51] naturally this naturally this all
[1:01:53] ordinances and all those things right
[1:01:55] all natural but when God come on the
[1:01:59] scene in the form of man in Matthew 4
[1:02:03] verse 1 after he the spiritual one came
[1:02:08] down he was baptized and received the
[1:02:12] baptism the Holy Ghost but notice tear
[1:02:15] after directly after the baptism look
[1:02:18] what happens here then was Jesus led up
[1:02:21] of the spirit into the wilderness to be
[1:02:23] tempted of the devil
[1:02:25] the verse November he was tatties
[1:02:27] water boilers and we know that but he
[1:02:29] was he was fasting forty days and forty
[1:02:31] nights in other words the spirit led him
[1:02:33] right into death it was time for him to
[1:02:37] die out can you imagine not eating for
[1:02:41] ten days five days I don't know how many
[1:02:44] went the longest I ever made it was four
[1:02:47] days and I just get lightheaded and
[1:02:48] already passed out from working all that
[1:02:50] kind of stuff but here our Savior was
[1:02:53] brought in for 40 days and 40 nights
[1:02:55] here into the world to be tempted and he
[1:02:58] fasted 40 days and after he's a hunger
[1:03:00] now remember here's a man full he's
[1:03:02] almost dead almost brought up right to
[1:03:05] the point of death lean had an agent
[1:03:10] there's nothing but it was met the
[1:03:12] commandments of the Spirit he says and
[1:03:14] when the tempter came to him he says if
[1:03:17] thou be the Son of God command that
[1:03:19] these stones be made bread right now
[1:03:21] these are temptations and one by one
[1:03:24] they would come to Jesus Christ
[1:03:25] absolutely and Christ would uh he would
[1:03:28] deal with them a certain way and now
[1:03:32] Satan is bringing these things and he's
[1:03:34] challenging him in the natural but
[1:03:36] Christ now is firing you right back in
[1:03:39] the spiritual right he says it is
[1:03:41] written man shall not live by bread
[1:03:44] alone but by every word that proceedeth
[1:03:46] out of the mouth of God I wonder if
[1:03:50] there's coming a time Saints we know
[1:03:54] there's a collapse coming how can you be
[1:03:56] trillions and trillions of debt this
[1:04:00] nation in debt the entire world is in
[1:04:01] debt to who we know who how can it last
[1:04:05] it can't last we know there is coming an
[1:04:07] economy of collapse it's coming and I
[1:04:10] wonder sometimes if this spiritual law
[1:04:14] here is going to have to come into fact
[1:04:18] I'm so hungry I'm so thirsty
[1:04:20] let's read the Word of God and it takes
[1:04:24] control of it it takes it takes it under
[1:04:27] control what if we will have to do this
[1:04:30] [Laughter]
[1:04:34] now thanks you thanks parish what was
[1:04:36] Christ doing before he even took him he
[1:04:39] said he was a hungered and he was
[1:04:40] tempted
[1:04:41] create something unnatural and here he
[1:04:43] said he says I'll eat the Word of God we
[1:04:48] must elevate now our minds Versailles
[1:04:52] you'll die if you don't eat natural food
[1:04:54] will I Christ it if you just ate on the
[1:04:59] Word of God you would live now remember
[1:05:04] what was Jesus Christ
[1:05:06] Jesus Christ was God from heaven in
[1:05:10] human form so if God sees it this away
[1:05:16] then we must see it this way too he was
[1:05:20] showing how it is up there every way
[1:05:23] that Jesus Christ act everything that
[1:05:25] Jesus Christ did reflected how it was up
[1:05:28] there everything every word every action
[1:05:32] reflected up there but what was what was
[1:05:37] he showing here
[1:05:38] he got tempted three times what was he
[1:05:40] showing what was he what what major
[1:05:44] combat ative weapon was he showing what
[1:05:48] exactly was he trying to convey to who
[1:05:51] us now the readers and those at that
[1:05:54] time and to Satan to display the tactics
[1:05:57] you remember the prophet of God he said
[1:05:59] Jesus Christ had all power in heaven and
[1:06:01] earth and he could have done anything he
[1:06:03] wanted he was at every major gift he
[1:06:06] could have just spoke this spoke glad
[1:06:08] the Bible said he was the second Adam
[1:06:10] and we know the first Adam spoke the
[1:06:11] Word of God the second Adam could speak
[1:06:13] the word as well right but here at this
[1:06:16] time he could have pulled any power out
[1:06:18] but what did he use used only the word
[1:06:21] of God right amen
[1:06:25] what was he displaying saints of God how
[1:06:28] many is getting hammered here as far as
[1:06:31] we're getting as far as I was like in my
[1:06:33] church right now there are many many
[1:06:35] battles going on many broken marriages
[1:06:41] cancers sprung up our brother that's
[1:06:43] been with us now too and a few years
[1:06:44] still in the wheelchair God has not
[1:06:46] healed them he's healed but does not
[1:06:48] manifest her but our church is in an
[1:06:53] almost like an uproar
[1:06:55] Satan has come in in such a way but what
[1:06:58] do we what if was Christ trying to teach
[1:07:00] us here in James chapter 4 verse 6 but
[1:07:05] he giveth more grace wherefore he saith
[1:07:08] God resists the proud but giveth grace
[1:07:10] to the humble
[1:07:11] now look what he says submit yourselves
[1:07:12] therefore to God and he says what resist
[1:07:15] the devil at Christ's weakest spot he
[1:07:20] was at the point of death hasn't eaten
[1:07:22] for forty days and forty nights and he
[1:07:25] needed one thing he resisted the temple
[1:07:29] if anything comes to you
[1:07:32] I don't no matter he says resist the
[1:07:35] devil what kind of forms does devil come
[1:07:37] in financial difficulties mayor told
[1:07:41] problems physical disease yes any
[1:07:47] problem any form the devil comes to you
[1:07:50] in resisted if I went and got tests and
[1:07:54] said brother sigh you got cancer no I
[1:07:56] don't did God as brother said enthuse
[1:07:59] God tell you that I know he didn't tell
[1:08:02] me that there are many times I've woken
[1:08:06] up and I had one time I felt like my
[1:08:08] left arm was paralyzed I couldn't even
[1:08:10] move it and I saw it for the first time
[1:08:12] I thought about caught off work and I
[1:08:13] said you know what I'm in control here
[1:08:17] God gave me the authority and I said you
[1:08:20] know what a little arm here you're going
[1:08:21] to work and you're gonna like it
[1:08:23] and I got dressed one arm they got
[1:08:26] everything on one-armed I drove the work
[1:08:28] one arm and it came back I got to the
[1:08:30] back of the van I was ready to pull on
[1:08:31] ladder and say guess what buddy tonight
[1:08:33] it's time to shine and I made that arm
[1:08:36] and in their heart I don't know what
[1:08:38] happened that night but it hurt and by
[1:08:40] the end of that day I want this thing
[1:08:42] and it was about 80% back you command
[1:08:45] whatever you speak the word what you
[1:08:49] want this is not the will of God that
[1:08:52] this arm does not work and I spoke it
[1:08:56] and I made it work and it works never
[1:08:59] had promised ins resists the devil in
[1:09:04] any form and he will just say when
[1:09:08] their timetables on this on July the 3rd
[1:09:11] know at 4 p.m.
[1:09:12] no it said and he will flee from me what
[1:09:18] was that oh I don't know if I should say
[1:09:22] this maybe one cut this out a certain
[1:09:30] brother I'll say Lee's a certain brother
[1:09:33] came and preached at our church and he
[1:09:35] said he said did you know you're the god
[1:09:37] of the devil and when he said that I
[1:09:41] like absolute that's all I needed now I
[1:09:45] can control him I tell him we wouldn't
[1:09:49] prayed over a brother that bril Jesse
[1:09:50] knows and I said death you cannot have
[1:09:53] this one three days later somebody else
[1:09:56] from that town died and not him was up
[1:09:58] now I told death what to do I talked to
[1:10:04] that brother later on he says he's
[1:10:05] pretty down and I said brother didn't
[1:10:06] you just say that you're the god Devils
[1:10:08] oh my goodness I should listen to my own
[1:10:09] sermons I said brother when you said it
[1:10:14] went down deep it told me what now I
[1:10:16] understand my authority now I understand
[1:10:20] what I what God has ordained me to do we
[1:10:23] are here to destroy the devil's is his
[1:10:27] fortresses his kingdom must be thrown
[1:10:31] down the power of God must be displayed
[1:10:35] one more time amen
[1:10:36] lots more Lord praise be to God so here
[1:10:40] the Holy Ghost annoys James he says
[1:10:41] resist the devil and he will flee from
[1:10:44] you he says draw nigh to God and He will
[1:10:46] draw nigh to you
[1:10:47] he says cleanse her hands he sent his
[1:10:49] pure hearts you double-minded a man in
[1:10:51] Ephesians 4:26 he said be easy be angry
[1:10:56] and sin that it's okay to be mad he's
[1:10:58] but just don't sin he says let not the
[1:11:00] Sun go down on your wrath he's anemic
[1:11:01] neither give place to the devil
[1:11:05] absolutely I heard the man Achmed say he
[1:11:09] said he said a lot of times he said he
[1:11:11] said if you're diagnosed with anything
[1:11:12] if you would just let it go and not
[1:11:16] accept the ESA's you'll get better it's
[1:11:18] how you accept what's present
[1:11:21] to you yes that's me or no that's not me
[1:11:26] Amen now let me read this testimony here
[1:11:29] I'm gonna show you a little testimony
[1:11:31] here by Malachi 4 by the grace of God
[1:11:33] okay yes now I want to read because this
[1:11:37] is so powerful I really really enjoyed
[1:11:41] this and I read to the home church there
[1:11:43] and now we know where the Prophet the
[1:11:47] man of God had had stomach problems
[1:11:48] right early on when he first became a
[1:11:51] Christian largest warfare when I was
[1:11:55] healed with stomach trouble why I
[1:11:56] remember holding my stomach along here
[1:11:59] and Jesus and when I was prayed for I
[1:12:01] didn't have nobody with the gift of
[1:12:04] healing to pray for me 9 spiritual gifts
[1:12:11] in the body one of them is miracles and
[1:12:13] one is healing and he did not have
[1:12:15] anyone with the gift of healing to pray
[1:12:17] over him you think he had the easy way
[1:12:20] out no he had to fight it and sweat it
[1:12:22] out like the rest of us he's decided to
[1:12:24] have nobody with the gift of healing
[1:12:25] pray for me the elder anointed me with
[1:12:27] oil I read it in the Bible he says I

[1:21:03] I'd still say I'm healed yes sir that's
[1:21:05] right sure because God's Word is right
[1:21:07] do you believe it amen let's sing off
[1:21:10] amen
[1:21:11] oh praise the Lord that just lifted my
[1:21:13] faith up I was like my goodness so here
[1:21:16] in Matthew 4 verse 17 Christ now is
[1:21:20] going is starting his ministry
[1:21:23] everything it went from carnality the
[1:21:26] word that the Old Testament it was
[1:21:28] dealing we know the share of the type
[1:21:30] that was dealing with the flesh man but
[1:21:32] it was also a type of the spiritual
[1:21:35] correct notice the very first thing to
[1:21:38] we're talking about spiritual amnesia
[1:21:40] lifting the spiritual amnesia having the
[1:21:42] mind of Christ right being therefore
[1:21:46] perfect how do you be perfect
[1:21:49] now watch Christ elevate this watch him
[1:21:52] elevate in Matthew 4 verse 17 and from
[1:21:56] that time Jesus began to say in reach
[1:21:58] they repent for the kingdom of heaven is
[1:22:00] at hand not a natural kingdom a
[1:22:04] spiritual kingdom and so now he says the
[1:22:07] spiritual Kingdom is about ready to be
[1:22:09] set up
[1:22:12] he's not by the Sea of Galilee salts you
[1:22:15] but it's up Andrew his brother casting
[1:22:16] that scene for they were fishermen they
[1:22:18] were fishers and he said to him follow
[1:22:20] me and I'll make you fishers of men
[1:22:23] so what God hand-picked two men who were
[1:22:26] natural fishermen and these natural
[1:22:28] fishermen were raised up by their daddy
[1:22:30] as fishers showed how to fix nets how to
[1:22:33] throw nets how to cast on this side cast
[1:22:35] on this seat side you know and then the
[1:22:37] waves come in now deal with the ocean
[1:22:39] and the winds and all these things and
[1:22:41] God said I've been preparing you from
[1:22:43] your birth up he says you've been can't
[1:22:45] you been fishing naturally but now it's
[1:22:47] time to fish spiritually so now these
[1:22:52] men are going natural fish spiritual
[1:22:56] fish now we've most of all come in it
[1:23:00] we've all come into this we already are
[1:23:01] know these things but notice how he's
[1:23:03] God is challenging these men now to
[1:23:05] think higher is this water know the sea
[1:23:12] is multitude peoples nations and tongues
[1:23:16] fish in the people fish in the people my
[1:23:19] how many are going lost in the hell
[1:23:21] right now thousands and millions are
[1:23:23] dying every day seven billion people
[1:23:25] pawn to face the earth you go a
[1:23:27] generation at seven billion people that
[1:23:29] majority will prime go to hell if we
[1:23:31] don't do something or but God knows all
[1:23:34] things so the first thing here now is
[1:23:38] easy as easy as look he says it's a
[1:23:40] spiritual Kingdom spiritual fisherman
[1:23:43] now moving now on to Matthew and here's
[1:23:47] the hard thing right here Matthew 18
[1:23:50] verse 21 and this is
[1:23:56] I was healed pretty heavy the Lord
[1:23:58] healed me after a couple sermons here
[1:24:00] spiritually and it did just tremendous
[1:24:03] wonders for me and Matthew 18 verse 21
[1:24:07] then came Peter to him and said Lord how
[1:24:11] oft shall my brother sin against me and
[1:24:15] I forgive him till seven times a brother
[1:24:21] a brother not a worldly person someone
[1:24:25] you really love hey brother in the
[1:24:27] church a system to church look what
[1:24:30] Jesus Jesus of them I say into thee
[1:24:31] until seven times but until until seven
[1:24:36] times seven seventy times seven saints
[1:24:40] of God if I sin against my sister Wendy
[1:24:43] here and she's like Versailles bah bah
[1:24:45] bah I said we forgive me she says yeah
[1:24:50] what do you have to do to move on
[1:24:53] because remember up there there's
[1:24:55] forgiveness and also up there is
[1:25:00] forgetfulness forgive and forget
[1:25:07] absolutely clear it out of your mind
[1:25:10] any offense that someone does unto you
[1:25:14] you forgive them and forget we can
[1:25:20] always forgive but forgetting is a very
[1:25:22] very hard part and that's where I
[1:25:24] struggled for years until this thought
[1:25:26] came right here can you forget it
[1:25:30] can you move on and just say that is it
[1:25:33] this is out of my mind and look at the
[1:25:35] individual as a brand-new brother and
[1:25:37] sister can we do that this is the mind
[1:25:42] of Christ
[1:25:43] moving up higher can you totally forget
[1:25:47] every occurrence a man
[1:25:54] thirty five so likewise shall my father
[1:25:57] Matthew 18 verse 35 so likewise shall my
[1:26:00] Heavenly Father do also unto you if ye
[1:26:02] from your hearts forgive not every one
[1:26:03] his brother hid their trespasses so we
[1:26:06] must forgive amen
[1:26:07] now why is that see one of the beautiful
[1:26:11] things about the Old Testament is shows
[1:26:12] law this and this if you do this this
[1:26:15] death do this it's death
[1:26:17] you this it's death right you'll be
[1:26:19] stoned or this or that and however you
[1:26:21] can allow to hold all these things
[1:26:22] inside of you you're allowed to do that
[1:26:26] but if you go to Leviticus 19 verse 17
[1:26:30] Leviticus 19:17 thou shalt not hate thy
[1:26:33] brother in thy heart in thy heart thou
[1:26:41] shout in anywise rebuked thy neighbor
[1:26:44] and suffer and not suffer sin upon him
[1:26:47] thou shalt not avenge neither he says
[1:26:51] nor bear any grudge against the children
[1:26:53] of thy people but thou shalt love thy
[1:26:55] neighbor as thyself I am the Lord you
[1:27:01] know my God says that because God does
[1:27:03] not hold any grudges
[1:27:04] God does not hold any evil in his heart
[1:27:08] millions and millions of people treat
[1:27:11] God like he's absolutely non-existent
[1:27:13] and God does not hold it to heart there
[1:27:17] is a time coming well that will come
[1:27:18] back upon them but for right now he lets
[1:27:20] them live and do what they want to do
[1:27:22] but he is God is able to fully forgive
[1:27:25] and forget it is a higher mindset the
[1:27:29] very mind of Christ amen in Matt Micah
[1:27:35] let's see here in Micah 7:19 and he will
[1:27:40] turn again he will compassion on us he
[1:27:41] will subdue our iniquities and thou will
[1:27:44] cast all their sins into the depths of
[1:27:46] the sea amen what he wipes it completely
[1:27:49] out right and if it's like that up there
[1:27:51] it must be like that here be therefore
[1:27:54] perfect as your father's in heaven is
[1:27:56] perfect in Isaiah 1:18 he says though
[1:27:58] your sins be as scarlet they shall be
[1:28:00] white as snow saints of God if I sin or
[1:28:03] you sin we should just be able to cover
[1:28:05] one another's faults and failures with
[1:28:07] the
[1:28:07] I love amen that's exactly right says
[1:28:13] now 107 as high as heaven as the earth
[1:28:16] so great is his mercy towards end the
[1:28:18] period for as far as the east is from
[1:28:20] the west so far hath he removed our
[1:28:22] transgressions from us and I hope we
[1:28:26] treat each other like this from this day
[1:28:27] we're forward any fault you see in me
[1:28:30] just put it as far away from me as I can
[1:28:32] and these fall I see in you or whatever
[1:28:34] it's just as it's like it's not even it
[1:28:36] doesn't even exist amen
[1:28:38] this is the very mind of God absolutely
[1:28:42] now I want to show you something here in
[1:28:45] the Old Testament God was given the laws
[1:28:47] and the prophets said he that they
[1:28:49] should have rejected them laws the Ten
[1:28:51] Commandments correct so look here in
[1:28:54] John 1:14 and the Word was made flesh
[1:28:57] and dwelt among us and we beheld his
[1:29:00] glory and the glory as of the only
[1:29:02] begotten of father full of grace and
[1:29:04] truth so here we were dealing with the
[1:29:07] glory of the Sun right the glory logos
[1:29:11] right he says then in John 17 verse 24
[1:29:13] father I will that they also whom thou
[1:29:15] has given me be with me where I am that
[1:29:18] they may behold my glory he switched
[1:29:21] ours given me for that allows me before
[1:29:24] the foundation of the world there's
[1:29:26] something special about the logo Saints
[1:29:28] remember the logos is what the word the
[1:29:30] Word made flesh what was that what was
[1:29:33] supposed that word F that logos packing
[1:29:36] all Redemption was right there because
[1:29:40] none of the word had to be made flesh
[1:29:41] and that flesh saved us who were caught
[1:29:44] in sin in the flesh correct amen
[1:29:47] so it must be a different thing and now
[1:29:49] here I'm gonna show you this this deals
[1:29:51] with it's a it's the shadow of the
[1:29:53] thunders in Exodus 33 verse 17 Exodus 33
[1:30:01] verse 17 and the Lord said unto Moses I
[1:30:04] will do this thing also that thou has
[1:30:06] spoken for thou has found grace in my
[1:30:08] sight and I know thee by name and he
[1:30:11] said I beseech thee show thee show me
[1:30:14] thy glory Moses had show me your glory
[1:30:17] Lord memmer was father-son descending
[1:30:20] God
[1:30:21] within the logos and he said I will make
[1:30:24] all goodness pass before thee and and I
[1:30:26] will proclaim the name of the Lord
[1:30:28] before thee and will be gracious to whom
[1:30:30] I will be gracious and will shew mercy
[1:30:31] on the who mouths show mercy and the
[1:30:33] Lord said to Moses here in Exodus 34
[1:30:36] verse 1
[1:30:38] remember the Ten Commandments were
[1:30:40] broken God brought now this man he said
[1:30:43] Moses he says I'm going to meet you on
[1:30:44] that mountain bringt for two more
[1:30:47] tablets he says and I'm going to show
[1:30:49] you my glory and our break eases and I
[1:30:52] will write upon these tablets the words
[1:30:54] which were in the first tablets we saw
[1:30:55] break us and be ready in the morning and
[1:30:58] come in the more come up in the morning
[1:31:00] upon Mount Sinai and present thyself to
[1:31:03] me in the top of the mount and in verse
[1:31:08] 4 and he huge
[1:31:10] Moses huge two tables of stone like in
[1:31:12] the first and Moses rode up early rose
[1:31:14] up early in the morning and went up unto
[1:31:16] Mount Sinai as the Lord had commanded
[1:31:18] and he took in his hand two tables of
[1:31:20] stone now look what takes place and the
[1:31:24] Lord descended in a cloud and stood with
[1:31:27] him there and proclaimed the name of the
[1:31:29] Lord in the in the tenth commandment
[1:31:31] says thou shalt not this thou shalt not
[1:31:34] that shalt not thou shalt not thou shalt
[1:31:37] not thou shalt not in God when the show
[1:31:39] Moses something greater he said that's
[1:31:42] not me
[1:31:43] he said that's just low that's just
[1:31:44] something to live by but let me show you
[1:31:46] some about me and the Lord passed by
[1:31:49] reform and proclaimed the Lord the Lord
[1:31:51] our God is merciful
[1:31:53] he's azan gracious and long-suffering
[1:31:55] and abundant goodness and truth they
[1:31:58] might that's the god of the New
[1:32:00] Testament inna that's exactly who Jesus
[1:32:03] Christ is keeping mercy for thousands
[1:32:06] forgiving iniquity transgression and sin
[1:32:09] and that by no means clear the guilty a
[1:32:11] man now that's the real God that is the
[1:32:14] glory of God amen because up there he's
[1:32:17] not don't do this don't do that he's
[1:32:19] like I am full of grace and mercy amen
[1:32:21] yes Lord amen
[1:32:24] now this ties right in here with Matthew
[1:32:25] five and verse 1 as he went now into up
[1:32:31] into the mountain Matthew 5 verse 1 and
[1:32:33] seeing the mountain
[1:32:34] he went up into a mountain and and when
[1:32:37] he was sad the disciples came under him
[1:32:39] so here is God now descending or came
[1:32:42] upon a mountain and what did he start to
[1:32:45] teach and he opened his mouth and taught
[1:32:48] them saying blessed are the poor in
[1:32:51] spirit for theirs is the kingdom of
[1:32:55] heaven
[1:32:56] he's jesus christ is taking away all
[1:32:59] natural stuff don't think carnal anymore
[1:33:04] in the book of psalms david always
[1:33:06] wondered he said God why do the wicked
[1:33:09] always prosper why do the people who do
[1:33:11] wrong always get this and get that and
[1:33:13] he's always questioning God but that's
[1:33:16] not the spiritual law then the spiritual
[1:33:19] law has blessed our poor in spirit for
[1:33:21] theirs of the kingdom he says blessed
[1:33:23] are they that mourn for they shall be
[1:33:25] comforted Ignite remember the opposite
[1:33:28] what they think is good is absolutely
[1:33:30] what is good I say that's like what they
[1:33:32] think of good is after two what God
[1:33:34] would think sure because up there what
[1:33:37] everybody's uh uh there's the kingdom
[1:33:41] that those that are mourned down here
[1:33:43] will be comforted of theirs and our meek
[1:33:45] shall inherit the earth
[1:33:46] they either do hunger thirst at the
[1:33:48] righteous they shall be filled he says
[1:33:50] blessed are the merciful so they they
[1:33:53] shall obtain mercy
[1:33:54] this is totally contrary to the Old
[1:33:57] Testament he says he says blessed are
[1:34:00] the pure in heart for they shall see God
[1:34:02] blessed are the peacemakers relieved she
[1:34:04] call shall be called the kingdom of God
[1:34:06] blessed are they which are persecuted
[1:34:07] for righteousness sake for theirs is the
[1:34:09] kingdom of
[1:34:13] now you want to persecute you and shall
[1:34:16] say all manner of evil against you
[1:34:17] falsely for my many my name's sake
[1:34:18] rejoice to be exceeding glad for great
[1:34:20] is your reward in heaven all these
[1:34:24] natural trials yield spiritual rewards
[1:34:29] absolutely this is Howard to look at it
[1:34:32] so just we're almost an hour here we'll
[1:34:35] just be calling her momentarily
[1:34:38] obviously can go through all the Gospels
[1:34:41] and pull out all these high thoughts why
[1:34:44] did Jesus Christ curse that fig tree
[1:34:47] according to time of season that fig
[1:34:50] tree was not supposed to bear fruit but
[1:34:53] he cursed it anyhow why because up there
[1:34:56] the tree of life yields fruit every 12
[1:34:58] every month in the Garden of Eden up
[1:35:03] little rubber in the private realm of
[1:35:06] God the trees bear fruit every man yes
[1:35:12] sir now look at this here now look he's
[1:35:15] diving now in Matthew 5 verse 21
[1:35:17] you gave heard it was some of them of
[1:35:19] old time thou shalt not kill but then
[1:35:21] now he said that's natural law but now I
[1:35:24] said what's over in whosoever is angry
[1:35:26] with his brother without a cause shall
[1:35:27] be a danger of judgment he goes deeper
[1:35:30] he goes forget about even killing
[1:35:33] anything are you even angry with him he
[1:35:35] brings it from a natural act to a
[1:35:37] spiritual problem this is a higher
[1:35:40] thought these are things about now we're
[1:35:43] going into eventually saints of God we
[1:35:44] are going to into spoken word again this
[1:35:48] will manifest this very spoken word
[1:35:50] where we will actually speak and things
[1:35:51] happen will come into play very shortly
[1:35:54] but we must get these smaller things
[1:35:56] ready in Matthew 5 and 27 you have heard
[1:36:01] that it was said of them a little time
[1:36:02] thou shalt not commit adultery what does
[1:36:04] adultery it's a natural act but he says
[1:36:07] but that whosoever looketh upon a woman
[1:36:10] to lust after her hath committed
[1:36:11] adultery already with her in his heart
[1:36:14] see so that is and that is the dealing
[1:36:17] with the natural acts but there's a
[1:36:18] spiritual problem yes so in the Old
[1:36:22] Testament you were guilty if you perform
[1:36:23] the act in the New Testament you're
[1:36:24] guilty if you just think about it
[1:36:27] see the mind of Eldon must elevate to
[1:36:31] his mind and when we resist the devil we
[1:36:35] the reason we're resisting a devil by
[1:36:36] doing these things identifying the
[1:36:39] spiritual problem what it's in the heart
[1:36:43] it says now look at this in Matthew 5
[1:36:48] verse 38 you have heard that have been
[1:36:51] said an eye for an eye a tooth for a
[1:36:52] tooth but I say unto you that ye resist
[1:36:55] not evil
[1:36:56] don't resist evil in this way when evil
[1:37:00] comes just take it just resist Satan now
[1:37:05] say like that in other words in other
[1:37:07] words uh but whosoever shall smite you
[1:37:09] on the treat on the cheek turn to him
[1:37:11] the other also and if any man will sue
[1:37:15] thee at law take away that take away thy
[1:37:17] coat let them take away thy coat let him
[1:37:20] also like let him have thy cloak also
[1:37:22] and who's there shall compel thee to go
[1:37:25] a mile go with him Twain give to him
[1:37:28] that asketh thee and from him that would
[1:37:29] borrow of thee turn out now away in
[1:37:32] other words give all that you have if
[1:37:36] something bad happens just wait on God
[1:37:38] it'll subside but just take it whatever
[1:37:41] has suffer yourself to be defrauded amen
[1:37:44] now now look here in Matthew 5 verse 43
[1:37:49] ye have heard that it's been said notice
[1:37:52] Jesus said it is written he did not say
[1:37:53] it is written he said you have heard so
[1:37:57] notice the Pharisees and scribes of that
[1:37:59] day they had added to the Word of God
[1:38:02] thou shalt love thy neighbour and hate
[1:38:05] thine enemy that is nowhere in the
[1:38:06] scripture thou shalt love thy neighbor
[1:38:09] the Bible says there is no where it says
[1:38:12] hate thine enemy they added to the Word
[1:38:15] of God because Christ said ye have heard
[1:38:17] that have been said he did not say it is
[1:38:19] written so he catches this and he says
[1:38:22] he said that's not true but I say if you
[1:38:25] love your enemies
[1:38:27] he says bless them that curse you and do
[1:38:29] good to them that hate you and pray for
[1:38:31] them the spies easily and persecute you
[1:38:33] hey man that's right a higher thinking
[1:38:37] higher law
[1:38:39] of everyone a man just a little bit
[1:38:43] longer and of course after all these
[1:38:46] first five chapters there he's dealing
[1:38:48] with many things in Matthew 5 in verse
[1:38:50] 48 be therefore perfect even his father
[1:38:53] which is in heaven isn't perfect I
[1:38:55] wonder if you fulfilled us those first
[1:38:56] four first five chapters you'll met
[1:38:58] you'll reach that perfection if you can
[1:39:01] just operate in that you mean you don't
[1:39:03] have to speak the spoken word you don't
[1:39:05] have to lay hands on the sick and they
[1:39:06] shall be recovered you just have to do
[1:39:07] these simple things and you are perfect
[1:39:10] you've done the perfect will of God
[1:39:12] [Music]
[1:39:15] so here Christ is he's bringing this new
[1:39:18] doctrine and the people the Bible says
[1:39:20] were astonished at his doctrine because
[1:39:22] it's a higher law and then after these
[1:39:25] doctrines he's bringing forth he what
[1:39:27] goes on a healing campaign now why is
[1:39:29] their healing campaign because there's
[1:39:31] no one sick up there there's no one
[1:39:33] demon-possessed up there amen
[1:39:35] that's right because what up there is
[1:39:37] perfection amen
[1:39:38] and if we have the mind of Christ we
[1:39:41] want to see this place just like it is
[1:39:44] up there if you encounter someone sick
[1:39:46] go up to it's a brother sister may I
[1:39:48] pray for you absolutely
[1:39:49] if you see someone lost a brother sister
[1:39:51] dear friend do you need Jesus Christ
[1:39:53] salvation do you even need to be
[1:39:55] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ you
[1:39:56] need to receive the Holy Ghost amen
[1:39:58] do you need to come up higher amen in
[1:40:00] the Word of God amen amen
[1:40:05] we are fully trusting in his word
[1:40:08] because the Bible when I wrote the word
[1:40:14] even all that which was spoken it will
[1:40:16] accomplish everything they don't leave
[1:40:18] that I believe that as well in Matthew 6
[1:40:22] verse 25 therefore I sent you take no
[1:40:25] thought for your life I saw saying one
[1:40:30] time as you get older you you realize
[1:40:33] how little time you have and at that
[1:40:36] point wait when you get a little bit
[1:40:38] older you realize you're willing to
[1:40:39] sacrifice more of your life because
[1:40:41] there ain't much left but if we could we
[1:40:43] could have caught that earlier on when
[1:40:45] we were younger therefore I take no
[1:40:48] thought for your life what you shall eat
[1:40:50] what you shall drink
[1:40:53] no yet for your body what you shall put
[1:40:57] on is not the life more than meat and
[1:40:59] the body than arraignment behold the
[1:41:03] fowls of the air they sow not neither do
[1:41:05] they reap nor gather into barns for your
[1:41:08] heavenly father feed them or are you not
[1:41:11] much better than they of this before the
[1:41:13] fall I didn't have to have job he did
[1:41:14] not have to work anyone up to that level
[1:41:19] yet I'll quit my job I'm resigning it
[1:41:22] and I'm gonna trust God that he's gonna
[1:41:24] pay all my house payments my bills my
[1:41:26] electrical bill my eating and all that
[1:41:28] and my car payment but I'm trusting
[1:41:29] later have I arrived there yet the Bible
[1:41:35] says work while you're still daytime but
[1:41:37] at night there's coming a time will you
[1:41:38] not work saints of God there's coming a
[1:41:41] time where we're going we are gonna put
[1:41:43] this word to the test and God is gonna
[1:41:46] perform magnificently he is going to
[1:41:50] perform exactly how he said he would he
[1:41:53] is going to take care of his bride
[1:41:56] I believe it there is nothing that could
[1:41:59] sway me anyway I know he is going to
[1:42:02] protect us sister you're newer here or
[1:42:09] whatever I don't know right no you in
[1:42:11] Matthew I'm sorry in revelations 13 it
[1:42:14] talks about if you study the scripture
[1:42:16] study history it deals with America and
[1:42:19] there's a great persecution coming to
[1:42:22] America it's hit almost everywhere and
[1:42:25] we're looking forward to it here we must
[1:42:28] prepare ourselves we just want to alert
[1:42:29] you there's these things coming if you
[1:42:33] look in the religious realm laws being
[1:42:35] passed things there is a religious
[1:42:39] movement coming in Matthew 13 the Bible
[1:42:42] says that Jesus would gather the tares
[1:42:45] first he'll gather the faults together
[1:42:50] to be burnt but then he'll bring the
[1:42:52] wheat into the barn so one of the things
[1:42:55] we're going to see before the rapture is
[1:42:57] going we're going to see the binding of
[1:42:58] the tares and the interpretation that
[1:43:01] would be the binding of the false
[1:43:03] churches
[1:43:07] everywhere they're calling for unity
[1:43:09] come together come together we must all
[1:43:11] be one layer down lay down lately aside
[1:43:14] all doctrine no no we must hold fast to
[1:43:17] the doctrine we must build her house on
[1:43:20] that Iraq amen amen
[1:43:23] yes now in closing in closing if you
[1:43:28] want to stand here by the grace of God I
[1:43:29] know I've been a little bit long here
[1:43:30] I know second services rough keep away
[1:43:32] there I want to I want to show you one
[1:43:35] more one more thought here things of God
[1:43:38] I want my mind to be so transformed to
[1:43:40] these to this level of thinking for the
[1:43:44] cam i put my pastor had just talked to a
[1:43:47] kid just talked to a an evangelist very
[1:43:51] gifted evangelist very spiritual and
[1:43:54] he's coming in july i'm gonna be there
[1:43:58] and he said brother john he said my
[1:44:02] church is getting tore up it's the devil
[1:44:07] is infiltrating everything John said
[1:44:09] praise be to God he says it shows you're
[1:44:13] on the right track why because the
[1:44:16] spiritual mind sees battles as Satan's
[1:44:20] angry whatever is fixing to take place
[1:44:23] there Satan is trying to stop it and he
[1:44:28] is the spiritual mind to say praise the
[1:44:30] Lord sounds like you're on the right
[1:44:31] track see but the carnal mind is like oh
[1:44:36] my goodness beside this and brother sigh
[1:44:37] this and both side that brother sigh
[1:44:39] that Hunnam God isn't for control we're
[1:44:43] not gonna let one hair our head turn
[1:44:45] gray because of worry it's gonna be old
[1:44:48] age or nothing
[1:44:51] Amen now here let's end here in John 19
[1:44:56] John 19 this is a very some
[1:45:01] thoughtbut it to me sayings it does
[1:45:03] tremendous gives me tremendous strength
[1:45:05] and insight
[1:45:07] these are simple fundamental thoughts
[1:45:10] here but this is spiritual if you can if
[1:45:13] we can always think on this there are
[1:45:17] many things I see in my own life I went
[1:45:18] changed and I'm just believing for them
[1:45:22] I'm waiting patiently I'm resisting
[1:45:24] everything that I can within me I'm
[1:45:27] resisting it I'm refusing to look at it
[1:45:29] but I'm actually want to see what God
[1:45:32] has promised in John 19 here verse 7
[1:45:38] then the Jews answered him we have a law
[1:45:39] and that by our law he ought to die
[1:45:41] because he made himself the son of God
[1:45:44] when pyle therefore heard that saying he
[1:45:46] was the more afraid and when again into
[1:45:49] the judgment Hall and said unto Jesus
[1:45:50] whence art thou but Jesus gave him no
[1:45:53] answer then said Pilate unto Him
[1:45:56] speakest thou not unto him or speak is
[1:46:02] now not unto me knowest not that I have
[1:46:04] power to crucify thee and have power to
[1:46:07] release thee what did Jesus say thou
[1:46:13] could have no power at all against me
[1:46:17] except it were given thee from above
[1:46:22] therefore he that delivered me unto thee
[1:46:26] hath the greater sin Christ was ready to
[1:46:30] be offered up as a sacrifice to into
[1:46:32] death and he said let me tell you
[1:46:35] something my father's in full control
[1:46:36] here he said anything that's it if
[1:46:40] there's a government that comes against
[1:46:43] you law judicial whatever police
[1:46:46] anything that comes in religious comes
[1:46:48] against you
[1:46:49] God has fully allowed this to take place
[1:46:52] fully allowed it you cannot have any
[1:46:55] duty was Jesus Christ worried all here
[1:46:57] he was not worried one bit
[1:46:59] he said no he knows my father's in full
[1:47:01] control every time I'm on the road and
[1:47:04] something happens to a vehicle like it
[1:47:06] dies or whatever I'm saying Lord I can't
[1:47:07] wait to see how you get me out of this
[1:47:09] every situation I run to on the job I'm
[1:47:12] like lord I know you're gonna show me
[1:47:13] how to fix this and I
[1:47:15] he always does he gives me the way am I
[1:47:17] the smartest guy absolutely not but I
[1:47:19] always I always when I'm a plumber and
[1:47:21] when I look at a certain situation here
[1:47:23] how am I gonna fix this it's underneath
[1:47:24] the concrete how am i do this does this
[1:47:26] I say your sander and I kind of wait I
[1:47:27] wait for the revelation to strike and
[1:47:30] then once I see oh now I know and I go
[1:47:34] with it I don't get worried don't get
[1:47:36] stressed I just wait on God for the
[1:47:38] answer
