getting an awakening praise god i've seen it in south america myself and i hear about it in japan they were talking about it uh brother tim pruitt's church japan is just exploding with the message people are on fire and i was just small little groups there but they're having an awakening praise god amen let's take our bibles here tonight let's stand i just want to preach this thought i've been talking about this for about a month now and i just want to preach this so we'll try to get back to the children's bible studies next week lord willing well we have mother's day we'll see second corinthians chapter three let's go there i want to preach tonight on from glory to glory uh and this with the sub-topic the best is yet to come amen the best is yet to come second corinthians chapter three this is a beautiful text here showing us the type of moses in the presence of god and how we come into the presence of god moses was changed in the presence of god so are we changed every time we come into god's presence amen second corinthians chapter three let's go to verse 15 second corinthians 3 15. now i'll read verse 15 16 and 17 that we can all read 18 together verse 15 says but even unto this day when moses is read the veil is upon their heart can i say it like this when wes when wesley's read right and some people when brother branham's read right moses was a great man of god many people jews especially have failed to move on to this day well the same thing's true people can read his thoughts and it can be availed to their eyes they don't see the truth of it verse 16 nevertheless when it shall turn to the lord the veil shall be taken away verse 17 now the lord is that spirit and where the spirit of the lord is there's liberty let's all read verse 18. ready one two three but we all with open face beholding as in a glass the glory of the lord are changed into the same image from glory to glory even as by the spirit of the lord let's have a word of prayer here ask god to minister here tonight heavenly father we're happy to be in your house lord god this is your house come and dwell amongst us heavenly father we love you we bless your holy name and father we're so grateful lord that we can gather under the name of jesus christ oh god let the holy spirit have us under the spirit of liberty tonight lord god and take this thought bless it to our hearts god that we can receive it and lord it will give us a fresh anointing lord god and it will change us as the scripture says from glory to glory father as we even prayed for this morning lord we need a stronger anointing lord god as the enemy comes in like a flood lord give us a stronger anointing father god to be lights and witnesses o god to testify of the truth of christ and to stand upon the word of god having done all to stand so father take this word blessed lord anoint us god for thy service in jesus christ's name and the saint said amen god bless you as you're being seated praise god praise the lord so at the end i'll have a few slides but i don't have any right now i'd kind of just add the notes there i haven't gone through and uh labeled everything i'd like to read so we're starting here in second corinthians and we will look to this chapter a little bit to kind of get an idea about the from glory to glory okay so at the beginning of this chapter paul's saying in verse one he said do we begin again to commend ourselves or need we as some others epistles of commendation to you or letters of condemnation i'm sorry commendation from you so paul is saying do ministers like he said myself and our ministers do we need letters of commendation in order for you to receive us right because in those days they had to send a letter they'd have to carry a letter oh look paul sent me you can receive me right but paul says do you need those type of letters those handwritten letters and verse two ye are our epistle written in our hearts known and read of all men so paul says you are our letter of recommendation right your testimony the life that you live is our written uh commendation right in other words your life proves that we are the true ministers of god amen so we we take a lot of joy in that because we know no matter what anyone says about us or no matter what we may say about each other right or what we may say about any other preacher any other ministry the life that we live proves what we are right a tree is known by its fruit praise god and when we live the word of god and hear the word of god our life speaks louder than any uh testimony or any email or any text you could write about you or me or anybody else the life we live speaks louder brother says your thoughts are louder in heaven than your words are on earth so god clear our thoughts right cleanse our thoughts help us to think the right thing what a beautiful portion this is verse 3 for as much as ye are manifestly declared to be the epistle of christ ministered by us so each person is a letter a spiritual letter of commendation right written by written by the spirit of god so the spirit of god makes every person's life you're a walking testimony right you're a walking letter of recommendation the spirit of god in your life right written by the holy spirit the spirit of the living god not in tables of stone but in fleshly tables of your heart oh it's so important for us to receive the word of god not just in our heads but it's got to go down to our souls praise god on our hearts and that way we become the epistle of christ we become the letter christ letter of commendation amen hallelujah and verse 4 in such trust have we through christ to godward not that we are sufficient of ourselves to think anything as of ourselves but our sufficiency is of god see the word that he wrote upon us that makes us sufficient that makes us strong the word that we receive and believe and live that's what makes us strong praise god not of ourselves but it's his word that we receive in our hearts verse 6 who also hath made us able ministers of the new testament not of the letter but of the spirit for the letter killeth but the spirit giveth life so the old testament they could lead the letter of the law but it can never bring life because the law couldn't take away sin right animal blood couldn't take away sin but the blood of jesus abolished all sin amen and what that did that set us free the bible says the bible says now the spirit of our sacrifice can come upon us i'm glad you know the the goat spirit can't come up upon us right the the lamb spirit or the uh the calf spirit none of those animal spirits could come upon us right but the spirit of jesus christ our sacrifice does come upon us and it gives us life not the letter the letter kilth but the spirit of the sacrifice gives life verse 7 but if the administration of death written and engraved in stones was glorious so that the children of israel could not steadfastly behold the face of moses for the glory of his countenance which glory was to be done away with how shall not the ministration of the spirit be rather glorious amen remember the old testament had moses face shining right it was so glorious it had it was delivered by angels but the bible says this one our our testament is even more glorious praise god it exceeds verse 9 says it exceeds in glory verse 10 for even that which was made glorious had no glory in this respect by reason of the glory that excelleth for if that which is done away was glorious much more that which remaineth is glorious seeing then that we have such hope we use great plainness of speech and not as moses which put a veil over his face that the children of israel could not steadfastly look to the end of that which is abolished but their minds were blinded for until this day remaineth the same veil untaken away in the reading of the old testament which veil is done away in christ praise god so anyone without christ in the baptism of the holy ghost has a veil the bible said not over their face but a veil over their heart right it's veil it's keeping their heart from letting the light of christ shine into it right so we have to take off the veil and recognize that god's experience is more than just church membership right it's receiving the life of christ amen like in the the clear examples like david he had so much anointing right he could defeat goliath but he still fell to adultery right that's why this is much more glorious because we can defeat natural we could defeat natural giants we can we can cause spiritual mountains to move but we can also continue to live a holy life amen and not be taken down later our life can be more glorious because verse 18 says we are changed how many been changed by the holy spirit praise god in the last week and today right you could be changed today you could be changed last week the bible said you're changed by the holy spirit writing the word of god on your heart afresh from glory to glory amen i want to read this what brother branham said he had a good quote from glory to glory yeah brother brahm said the fire is moving on he said he said let's move on from glory to glory he said from bible experience to bible experience let's unfold and open our hearts raise our hands up to god he said keep saying so keep keep keep smart right stay in the bible don't get outside of that he says stay right there praise god see like with sister who is dad being healed that's a bible experience of with the prayer cloths right i can honestly say i don't think we ever had one like that like like that powerful so that see i'm going from that bible experience to the next one praise god and before that we must have i'm sure we had some other healing or some other testimony we brother said we go from that experience to another bible experience are you looking forward to the next one praise god see that's that's what we got to do we got to live from one experience to the next one we're changed from glory to glory our faith is going to be stronger next time praise god for the next the next battle the next test our faith can be stronger we can go higher in the things of god and yet we still live the same holy life amen we don't let sin in the door we keep the sin out praise god we keep the home clean and purge from all 11 right we just we just keep the same holiness and the bible it says we go from experience but to experience bible experience to bible experience amen oh it's beautiful i love how brother man said that let's move on he said it's time for us to make footprints praise god we can't stay here in this same camp he said the fire is moving so see we can't stay on the same things right we have to move deeper into the things of god amen hallelujah like i was telling that brother uh or that brother that sent us his book he had a good testimony uh he said i like that idea for your next book he said because if you missed one of the the revelations of the mysteries you're confused and that's so true the one i see a lot of people miss is the fifth one the statue of perfect man they miss that and they somehow they don't think that they get those until after they're born again and a lot of them don't even think they're born again and so it's for them it's a hopelessness right they've lost all hope they're like oh i'll never get virtue i'll never get that i never get real patience i'm so impatient like because they don't understand it they're so confused they don't know what they've got but church if we've got jesus christ living in us we should be able to see i have the faith of christ i have the virtue of christ i have the knowledge of christ right i've got the temperance i've got my passions under control i've got the patience of jesus amen so see we should see that uh we've got to overcome the confusion that the enemy brings so the mysteries are so crucial and he said that's what he thought was a a great element and i totally agree if we can't see a lot of these revelations like another one is the baptism of the holy ghost right with christ in you the hope of glory and i counted one time i think i knew five preachers that left the message because they all taught you get the holy ghost when uh you believe god sent a prophet that is that's not it it's not it's it's so far off it's not even close right these things are but see they're so confused on on these topics they think john the baptist got the baptism of the holy ghost in his mother's womb well the bible said he was filled with the holy spirit but then john 7 says no one could receive the holy spirit though jesus was glorified and so they're so confused and they can condemn themselves well if a baby could get it and i don't have it how how how insignificant am i you know i must be hopeless if a baby can receive it but i can't but john didn't get it in the soul john got it in the spirit right and so that means john had to have his soul and spirit when he was in the mother's womb when he was six months old right so john's spirit and soul was already in him at six months old the holy spirit filled his mind which he couldn't talk at that point but yet he was leaping and shouting for joy in his mother's womb right but the holy ghost couldn't be given the soul till the day of pentecost but see that confuses it confuses people so badly but we know the real baptism of the holy ghost occurs when someone has repented fully surrendered they've obeyed the word of god god's cleaned out their uh their desires they want to be born again and then god fills them praise god that's the next thought on joshua that circumcision you know what that is church what is that a circumcision it's a willing surgery it's a willing self-inflicted pain of a surgery right a man has to go to that uh well a child the parents have to go to that and they willingly allow this surgery and god says circumcise your hearts right that's what god told israel well how can you circa it's not a natural thing it's a spiritual thing and god said you so in other in other words in order to be born again you've got to willingly say god cut this out of my life i don't want it anymore permanently take it out of my life amen and and so many people don't go there they they think they can still have a church membership and believe god sent a prophet and still enjoy sin but to be the very essence of being born again is that the old nature has been cut off and god makes you a new creature in christ jesus oh there's so much there's so much revelation church there's so much revelation god has given us that we should go from glory to glory the confusion should be taken away praise god all the doubts and all the all the misunderstandings should be taken away and we should see clearly the bible says we should see clearly the plan of god for our lives amen amen that's beautiful i love i love that quote we can't stay in the same camp we have to move on from bible experience to bible experience amen all right now here i'd like to uh look at that thought again we we're changed from the same image from glory to glory even by the spirit of the lord so the holy spirit won't let us stay the same right if we are going to obey the holy spirit we can't stay the same we've got to get more holy right we've got to we got to train our minds to be more obedient to the word of god now look at chapter four it goes right in this thought it keeps flowing because remember they didn't have chapters until just a few a hundred years ago when they inserted these chapters verse one therefore seeing we have this ministry as we have received mercy we faint not but have renounced the hidden things of dishonesty so see they will go from glory to glory so you have to renounce your dishonesty okay not walking in craftiness right nor handling the word of god deceitfully but by manifestation of the truth commending ourselves to every man's conscience in the sight of god so we have in other words you have to live true before every man right we have to manifest truth we have to tell the truth to every man or woman praise god and doing that then the bible says we renounce all dishonesty we live truthfully and we go from glory to glory now church the one of the greatest indicators of this is how you can live with your husband or wife right and your children they're the ones where we have to we have to make sure we show them the love of god we have to show them the spirit of truth right we have to manifest living true and living loving to them and that's no doubt if we live there at home if we live our our home lives with truth and and holiness and righteousness we will be changed from glory to glory my wife was telling me the other day just how she's seen our children improve in their walks with the lord you know i'm not there all the time so i didn't see i thought well praise the lord they're going from glory to glory now i see it a little bit but not as much as my wife you know she's there all the time and the same thing when you know guest ministers come and they talk to you and they fellowship with you and they'll say oh my what a wonderful time we had talking with the brothers and sisters and now they're really they're they're so holy and they're we had such a great time and they had such good testimonies about the lord so they can see you going from glory to glory now it's hard to see ourselves go right that's why we got those memorials we talked about this morning hallelujah where we can look back a year and say wow look how far we've come through the pandemic well pandemic right so just like just like a normal flu you know flu season well they call it these things but look look at our faith how it's grown stronger in the word of god we're more confident of god's word praise god we're still trusting in the living god we're not trusting in you know a government right we're not trusting in our own ability we're not trusting in the world's economy or the united nations we're trusting in the living god and we're going from glory to glory amen now so we can clearly see the texas moses stayed in god's presence and he went from glory to glory but now we live in the presence of the holy spirit and we go from glory to glory as well and that's what the statue of perfect man is from glory to glory from anointing to anointing from portion to portion all right now i want to just look at a few uh examples here of how we go from glory to glory and the best is yet to come so why don't i just start with some believers lives i just kind of want to uh go to let's go to job 42. i think i'll start there job 42. we'll just look at job's life and how the best of job's life was the end of his life job 42. so i preached on this you know i think i preached three sermons on it but i never really took a lot of time to read 42 verse 12. i never i don't think i read all these scriptures at the end remember earlier in chapter 42 he says i've heard about god but now i've seen god and in verse 6 i abhor myself and repent in dust and ashes now remember he was such a mighty man of god right uh the princes would come to him and lay at his feet just to hear a little bit of wisdom before he got sick right before he he went through this test uh and he was a very wise man god said he's a perfect man but job still had areas where he needed to humble himself so god allowed it uh he he humbled himself and then the bible says he repents and god blesses his latter end more than his gr his former so verse 12 so the lord blessed the latter end of job more than his beginning for he had 14 000 sheep six thousand camels and a thousand yoke of oxen and a thousand shias's he had also seven sons and three daughters and he called the name of the first gemini and the name of the second kaziah in the name of the third karen hapak and in all the land were no woman found so fair as the daughters of job and their father gave them inheritance among their brethren after this job lived 140 years and saw his sons and his son's sons even four generations so job died being old and full of days praise god so when was the best time of job's life the end was the best of job's life praise god he went from glory to glory right but he had to go through this very difficult testing time right months probably less than a year the historians say went through months of testing time oh okay yeah yeah please do uh yeah maybe use a different port now guy did you try all the ports all four okay yeah that's strange okay i think he needs this i had this i had a portable external drive across wait till he comes up but you can clearly see job's latter end was greater now now these are natural things right but we'd still consider them blessings how many would consider financial blessings a blessing from god yeah i would because i'm no good at making money right like i'm not a i'm not a stock market guy you know they can predict the stock markets and they can invest in the right stocks and make up ten thousand here the next week make twenty thousand i i couldn't do that i don't have enough i don't have enough nerve to do that some of your relatives can do that i think we've talked about that i know my brother can do it too one of my brothers but this guy he could make a lot of money or job was blessed financially with his animals so god bless his natural money right and his the fruit of his womb right seven sons and three dollars ten more children he had and then also his daughters were so beautiful you need to try this one too this has got uh that one truck well i'm sorry yes you got the cord okay that's so strange that worked all all day i'm not sure why it's not working that's all right and then the bible said his daughters were not just i mean he had great daughters but they were beautiful as well that was a blessing they have beautiful children handsome boys and beautiful girls right that was a blessing so god just poured out every blessing he could upon job because job was a man that feared god he sacrificed praise god he trusted god and god made the end of his life better than the beginning amen here's look at a few more here i got a number of different saints here i think i've skipped ahead so when was the best part of moses's life the first 40 years middle 40 or the last 40. which part was best the last third of his life the first 40 he was being taught the wisdom of egypt brother ramsey took the next 40 to burn it all out of him right praise god so church we got to remember that that uh you know god may take years to take things out of our life that we've allowed in them right things we've allowed god may take years brother said god will train a man years for a few months of ministry john the baptist he was trained 30 years for six months of ministry praise god amen that's an encouragement praise god and the idea is to remain faithful even while you're waiting for god to maybe put you in your position or put you in your life's purpose remain faithful to god be dedicated diligent to god that's what god's doing every day is training amen every day is a chance to get closer to him every day is a chance to show god how much you love him and appreciate him amen and then one day you'll find out what was the purpose what was the one thing in my life that was so important for me to do remember the the queen of sheba what was the one thing that she wants to do she know that she had lived a good life it was to cross the desert to say i'm going to make a trip across the desert i don't care who i don't care what happens i'm willing to risk my life in order to see this gift of god i want to see the man of god operate that discernment amen like brother brandon right brother said it the gifts are very similar get the discernment i want to see that discernment operate right she was willing to cross the desert and that's what god's going to use her for on the day of judgment praise god that was the one moment of her life that was so crucial that she had to just do something that was just so amazing but i said no one else can do what god's called you to do amen no one can do it you have something so unique that you're the only one that can i'll say like this step up to the plate and do god's will hallelujah oh thank the lord so job best part and moses the best part was that last third of his life the last 40 years of his life was the greatest time did he make mistakes yes i didn't get to this morning my brother branham said is it still what's the percentage on it okay well it's okay if it doesn't charge yeah just check again i don't think i have any other it's okay if we lose the live stream but you know big deal i know they might have been watching it that's so weird it worked all day yesterday did you try to plug it into different plugs on that um electrical outlet did you try that okay just try it's no big deal if we lose it you know just kind of maybe a chance for somebody to hear the word but no big deal as far as uh you know not a big concern moses oh yeah brother ram said uh even this last this even in the best part of his life brother adam said that he failed to circumcise studying on circumcision he failed to circumcise his sons so zipporah came circumcised the boys threw down the foreskins and said thou art a bloody husband to me brother abraham said god send us some zipporahs hallelujah now how can that apply to us god send us some mothers that will pray the children or adults through to the baptism of the holy ghost in other words if nobody else will come up and pray amen if you see somebody at the altar no one else will pray for them you come up and pray for them pray god no matter if you're male female preacher non-preacher if you see somebody who wants to be born again then you step up and you pray for them amen amen the man said send us some zephorus hallelujah but i'm talking about the churches the nominations won't get them born again he said the denominations don't want the baptism he said the seal of god they don't want the seal of god he said but send us some zipporahs that'll circumcise the hearts remember a woman can do anything except preach she has all nine gifts in the spirit she can pray for her people she can she can do any of those nine gifts right remember uh the bible said the bible said i preached this a few months ago the bible said the woman's like a cornerstone the bible said if you raise your daughters the right way they'll be cornerstones and who is the other cornerstone jesus christ amen so god how did god compare how can i compare a faithful woman
