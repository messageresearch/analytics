[19:29] [Music]
[19:45] hey I think we'll be done there why
[19:48] don't we stand and we'll just read
[19:49] little scripture Bible here by the grace
[19:51] of the Lord and then we'll just stand in
[19:54] honor of the word let's go to Exodus
[19:55] chapter 4 as we sent out on the postcard
[20:00] we'd like to preach on thus saith the
[20:02] Lord for today amen
[20:04] so let's look at it Exodus chapter 4 we
[20:06] will look at the stay at the Lord for
[20:08] the day of Moses and then we'll see how
[20:11] that applies to us today because it
[20:13] certainly does apply to us today in fact
[20:17] this is the first time in scripture that
[20:18] we ever read us say at the Lord so let's
[20:21] see what it meant here to Moses Exodus
[20:26] chapter 4 verse 19 and we'll go 19 to 23
[20:39] and so I'll read 19 to 22 and then we
[20:42] can all read 23 together by God's grace
[20:44] so Exodus 4:19 says and the Lord said
[20:48] unto Moses in Midian go return into
[20:50] Egypt for all the men are dead which
[20:53] sought thy life and Moses took his wife
[20:56] and his sons and set them upon an ass
[20:58] and he returned to the land of Egypt and
[21:00] Moses took the rod of God in his hand
[21:04] and the Lord said unto Moses when thou
[21:06] goest to return into Egypt see that thou
[21:09] do all those wonders before Pharaoh to
[21:12] which I have put in thine hand but I
[21:14] will harden his heart that he shown let
[21:17] the people go now let's pay attention to
[21:20] verse 22 I'll read that still and thou
[21:23] shalt say on
[21:23] Pharaoh thus sayeth the Lord Israel my
[21:27] son even my firstborn let's all read
[21:31] verse 23 together one two three and I
[21:34] say unto thee let my son go
[21:37] that he may serve me and if thou refuse
[21:40] to let him go
[21:42] behold I will slay thy son even thy
[21:45] firstborn let's have one more word of
[21:47] Prayer let's just bow our heads father
[21:49] we love you today dear God we thank you
[21:51] for your mercy your son Jesus Christ
[21:54] father just bless our our ministry today
[21:57] bless our gathering with thy divine
[21:59] presence Lord God bless every heart and
[22:02] soul that's here those livestreaming
[22:04] those that are hungry to hear thus saith
[22:06] the Lord for today just take control of
[22:08] me and could take control of every heart
[22:10] Lord that we could all hear the Word of
[22:12] God in Jesus Christ's name every said
[22:14] amen god bless you being seated praise
[22:16] the Lord so Malachi can switch over when
[22:23] you're ready thank you sir I'll try to
[22:26] keep this within 45 minutes so let me
[22:29] set a timer here so I do try to keep my
[22:32] word here by God's grace so we like to
[22:36] welcome everyone here to our little
[22:39] summer Series in July and we'll be
[22:42] teaching the foundations of the
[22:43] Christian faith because there's only one
[22:46] faith amen
[22:48] so some of you may know we sent out
[22:51] 2,500 postcards to this this zip zip
[22:55] code right here around the church here
[22:57] so those that are right close to the
[22:59] church and we're gonna take this month
[23:01] and focus on what the Holy Spirit or the
[23:03] pillar of fire has spoken to this
[23:07] generation we're so glad that else was
[23:09] able to attend this wonderful she could
[23:11] make it by God's grace and each Sunday
[23:15] we'll be looking at a different topic
[23:17] today where I look at some of the thus
[23:18] saith the Lord statements for today next
[23:21] Sunday we'll look at prophecy we'll look
[23:24] at future thus saith the Lord that God
[23:26] has spoken that are going to come to
[23:28] pass in two weeks we'll look at the
[23:31] power of the name of Jesus Christ in
[23:34] Baptism in miracles in the Godhead
[23:37] we'll look at that name that special
[23:39] name of the Lord Jesus Christ three
[23:42] weeks we'll look at the 12 New Testament
[23:44] mysteries and then the last week we'll
[23:46] look at the book of Revelation revealed
[23:48] will show as many symbols as we can in
[23:51] the 45-minute session so people can
[23:54] understand what the book of Revelation
[23:57] is all about so let's look at this
[24:01] thought here we read our text in
[24:03] Ephesians 4 I'm sorry I'm sorry it's not
[24:05] Ephesians Exodus 4 and and I'm just
[24:09] gonna use a few pictures and slides here
[24:11] so we learned from verse 22 that God
[24:15] told Moses to speak for him and when
[24:19] Moses was speaking God's words he would
[24:21] literally say thus saith the Lord
[24:24] because that's what he said God said you
[24:26] shall say unto Pharaoh thus saith the
[24:29] Lord
[24:31] and remember in Deuteronomy 18 Moses was
[24:34] called a prophet because that's what a
[24:35] prophet is a prophet is one who speaks
[24:38] for the Lord and when a prophet says
[24:43] thus say at the Lord that means God told
[24:46] them to say that and they're being
[24:48] obedient saying what God said because
[24:51] God Moses told the people that God would
[24:54] raise him up a prophet and put my words
[24:57] or put God's words in his mouth
[25:00] so this is gives us a little bit of a
[25:02] background humming Oh Joshua was a
[25:04] prophet Joshua said thus saith the Lord
[25:08] there is an accursed thing in the midst
[25:11] of thee so Joshua was also a prophet he
[25:15] was a spokesperson for God people might
[25:19] not be aware of that but whenever God
[25:22] wanted to say something and let them
[25:25] know that it was him talking he would
[25:26] say first thus saith the Lord and we
[25:31] know Sam you know this picture of Samuel
[25:32] and David but when Samuel says here was
[25:35] not to David of course this is what he
[25:37] told to Israel Samuel told Israel thus
[25:40] saith the lord you have rejected your
[25:43] God and chosen a king so now we see you
[25:47] know these three examples Moses Joshua
[25:49] and now Samuel
[25:51] all saying these important words thus
[25:54] say at the Lord and that was to let the
[25:57] people know that this is not an idea of
[25:59] a man this is just isn't
[26:00] Joshua's opinion or Samuel or Moses
[26:03] opinion but it's actually God's own word
[26:07] this is a positive thus saith the Lord
[26:10] statements we've already read a few that
[26:12] are kind of like judgments right that
[26:14] are God judging the people but here's a
[26:16] really encouraging positive thus say at
[26:19] the Lord statement this is Isaiah Isaiah
[26:22] said thus saith the Lord I lay in Zion
[26:25] or is Jerusalem a precious cornerstone
[26:28] that's in first samuel 10 II I'm sorry
[26:32] that's not first a meal that's uh isaiah
[26:35] 28:16 i'm sorry i forgot to change this
[26:37] right here that should be isaiah 28:16
[26:41] forgive me but we all know that Peter
[26:45] quoted what Isaiah said and Peter said
[26:48] Isaiah was talking about Jesus Christ
[26:51] because Jesus Christ is the foundational
[26:55] stone he's the cornerstone
[26:57] he's our sure foundation so again we
[27:01] have isaiah saying thus saith the lord
[27:03] and this is a positive promise and God
[27:06] did what he said he sent Jesus Christ
[27:08] and now Christ is the cornerstone of
[27:10] your faith aren't you glad that your
[27:13] faith is built upon the cornerstone of
[27:15] Jesus Christ amen he is the cornerstone
[27:17] of my faith in your faith here's another
[27:22] example I love this picture of Jeremiah
[27:24] Jeremiah spoke with thus saith the Lord
[27:26] did you know he used thus saith the Lord
[27:30] 147 times Jeremiah said thus saith the
[27:34] Lord so God was in constant contact with
[27:37] Jeremiah the Prophet and look what he
[27:40] said he said thus saith the Lord I will
[27:42] make my words in thy mouth fire and this
[27:47] people would so this was another kind of
[27:51] a time of judgment right God was going
[27:53] to judge Israel and so the word of
[27:55] Jeremiah would be thus saith the Lord
[27:57] it'd be like fire and it would consume
[27:59] or burn the people up now how many how
[28:03] many know did the people receive
[28:04] Jeremiah or the
[28:05] rejected they rejected him they didn't
[28:08] now people did not repent in the days of
[28:10] Zedekiah they did not repent and that's
[28:13] why God said the people are gonna be
[28:16] like wood but your word which would be
[28:18] thus saith the Lord is going to be like
[28:20] fire to them so thus saith the Lord is a
[28:22] very powerful statement I hope everybody
[28:24] can see that I could have went further
[28:27] Ezekiel said the second-most thus say at
[28:30] the Lord's he said 126 thus say at the
[28:33] Lord's so the phrase thus saith the Lord
[28:36] is very critical to understanding how
[28:39] God speaks to his people when God speaks
[28:43] to his people through a prophet he uses
[28:45] those words thus saith the Lord
[28:48] now now that you understand what a
[28:52] prophet does they speak for God now you
[28:56] can begin to understand today's sermon
[28:58] why I called it thus saith the Lord for
[29:01] today I'm going to share what God has
[29:04] spoken today with thus saith the Lord
[29:07] through a prophet most people are
[29:11] probably not aware that God has spoken
[29:13] with us saith the Lord as I was not
[29:16] aware until I was 21 years old I had no
[29:19] idea God even spoke with us say the Lord
[29:22] anymore - I was 21 years old and I heard
[29:24] the message similar to what we're about
[29:27] to hear right now but we're very
[29:30] thankful God has spoken with us say at
[29:32] the Lord today now as you probably
[29:36] noticed on the front of the postcard I
[29:38] sent out or those of you who are live
[29:41] streaming and saw my facebook post about
[29:44] this you probably see a man here on the
[29:47] right-hand side and that name is the
[29:50] name of that man is William Branham and
[29:52] we believe he was God's prophet for this
[29:55] last day this last day generation he
[30:00] passed away in 1965 of course he there's
[30:03] his age right there from 1909 to 1965
[30:06] and there were over 60 times that I
[30:10] counted that I found where he spoke to
[30:13] the listeners of the Christians using
[30:17] the phrase thus say
[30:18] at the Lord as it applied to truce from
[30:22] the Bible and so we're gonna share about
[30:24] 10 or 15 of those I probably can't get
[30:27] to all of them because there's just not
[30:30] enough time it would take hours and
[30:32] hours and hours so I'll be sharing some
[30:34] of those now if you notice the words the
[30:37] pillar if I wrote the words pillar of
[30:38] fire on here because of the next picture
[30:42] I'm gonna show it's gonna come up next
[30:44] and I don't know Alice have you seen
[30:45] this picture here that comes up right
[30:48] here have you seen this picture before
[30:48] okay wonderful amen wonderful so this
[30:54] picture of course is a picture of
[30:56] William Branham with the pillar of fire
[30:59] okay and here's a little bit more info
[31:01] about that the picture was taken in 1950
[31:04] in Houston the Houston Coliseum in Texas
[31:07] now that cow scene was now torn down and
[31:09] they got a bigger one bill but in 1950
[31:12] this picture was taken and we believe
[31:15] this is the same pillar of fire that led
[31:19] Moses all the days of his life and
[31:22] helped lead Israel out of Egypt we also
[31:25] believe this is the same pillar of fire
[31:28] Paul met on the road to Damascus where a
[31:31] light struck him knocked him off his
[31:34] horse and he said who is it Lord and he
[31:37] said I am Jesus so we believe that this
[31:40] same pillar of fire that was with Moses
[31:43] that spoke to Paul is the same pillar of
[31:47] fire that was with brother Branham and I
[31:50] think after listening and watching some
[31:53] of the videos and hearing some of the
[31:55] things I'm going to share I think you'll
[31:56] agree that God was with this wonderful
[31:59] man of God because you'll see
[32:02] supernatural vindications and you'll see
[32:04] that his Bible teaching was pure it was
[32:07] the same teaching that Paul taught
[32:11] brother Branham always stayed with the
[32:13] Bible and so that's why I put on that
[32:16] postcard that's why I put on the
[32:18] postcard the pillar of fire has spoken
[32:20] this generation because it wasn't
[32:22] brother branham's ideas he was just reap
[32:25] reaching everything that the Apostle
[32:28] Paul had already preached but most of it
[32:30] had been lost where we
[32:32] to churches and we wouldn't hear much of
[32:34] what the Bible says you wouldn't hear
[32:36] preached but God wanted to bring him
[32:39] back God wanted to restore it and he did
[32:42] it by His Holy Spirit or what we call
[32:44] the pillar of fire so we're so grateful
[32:47] God has spoken to this generation with
[32:49] the pillar fire amen
[32:51] now just so everyone knows - in 1950
[32:56] after this picture was taken brother
[33:00] branham's friends had a man examine the
[33:04] picture they examined the negative of it
[33:07] and a man named George J lacy examined
[33:11] it in 1950 and this is the actual
[33:13] document and I can print off a copy if
[33:15] you'd like a copy he examined it and his
[33:19] opinion is at the bottom he said further
[33:21] I am the definite opinion that the light
[33:23] struck I'm sorry the light streak
[33:25] appearing above the head in a halo
[33:28] position was caused by light striking
[33:31] the negative in other words he was
[33:33] saying this picture was not doctored
[33:34] this picture was not a phony this is a
[33:38] legitimate picture of God and so if you
[33:42] you can research George de Lacy online
[33:44] of course he's passed away now but he
[33:47] was the president of the American
[33:49] Society for questioned documents and
[33:52] examiner's because after brother Branham
[33:54] and his friends saw this picture they
[33:56] said well is this God or what is this
[33:58] they believed it was God so they sent it
[34:00] out to the most advanced examiner they
[34:04] knew for documents and he did all the
[34:07] tests you could if you want to read
[34:08] through here here's the examination
[34:10] there's there's five paragraphs on the
[34:12] test that they did to make sure that
[34:14] this was not a phony picture and the
[34:17] results came back that it was a
[34:19] legitimate picture of the pillar of fire
[34:22] so as far as we know this is the first
[34:25] time gods ever been photographed and God
[34:28] chose to take a photograph with his
[34:30] prophet now doesn't that sound like
[34:32] Moses God identified his prophet with
[34:35] the pillar fire and that's what we see
[34:38] today God identifying in other words God
[34:40] showing to everybody here's the man I'm
[34:42] gonna speak through and we all need to
[34:45] listen to what he says
[34:46] when he says thus saith the Lord all
[34:49] right so hope that's helpful by God's
[34:51] grace I think that's a beautiful
[34:53] testimony of how how official it is that
[34:59] God has spoken to this generation so
[35:04] let's let's say that photo is legitimate
[35:06] which we believe it is but some people
[35:08] you know might not but let's say let's
[35:10] say it was were there any other
[35:12] supernatural signs that might let us
[35:15] know that brother Branham was a prophet
[35:18] of God and I would say yes there are
[35:21] many supernatural signs
[35:23] I think I'll share too because of time
[35:26] let me share too and I'm gonna show a
[35:29] video next
[35:30] okay so Malachi do you have the remote
[35:31] we may have to turn it up just a little
[35:33] bit we'll see I tested it after first
[35:35] service I want to show you a testimony
[35:38] of a congressman William Upshaw who was
[35:43] healed he was he was paralyzed in a
[35:46] wheelchair and he served in Congress for
[35:49] eight years he went to a meeting a
[35:51] brother branham of course where we know
[35:54] the pillar of fire was leading brother
[35:55] Branham and God spoke to brother Branham
[35:58] to speak to him and it raised his faith
[36:01] and he was healed and he got up out of
[36:03] his wheelchair and he spent the last few
[36:05] years of his life completely healed by
[36:07] the grace of God so let's watch a quick
[36:10] video on that and then we will move on
[36:13] to the next thought but I want to share
[36:15] that testimony with you I may have to
[36:21] rewind this the following has been
[36:24] written set up brother Brandon the
[36:27] ending of world war two marked the
[36:28] beginning of a phenomenal growth period
[36:30] for the Pentecostal people around the
[36:32] world it was perhaps the greatest
[36:33] healing revival ever witnessed in the
[36:35] history of the world the person
[36:37] universally acknowledged as the revivals
[36:39] father and peace center was William
[36:41] Brandon the sudden appearance of his
[36:43] miraculous healing campaigns in 1946 set
[36:47] off a spiritual explosion in the
[36:49] Pentecostal movement which was to move
[36:51] to Main Street USA by the 1950s and give
[36:55] birth to the broader charismatic
[36:56] movement in the 1960s which currently
[37:00] every denomination in the country now I
[37:03] want to quickly point out this is not
[37:05] brother branham saying this about
[37:07] himself but these are historians who
[37:10] wrote about this in the dictionary of
[37:11] Pentecostal and charismatic movements so
[37:15] these historians have recognized the
[37:17] person who was known to start this
[37:20] revival of healing was William Branham
[37:23] and if you know history the the person
[37:26] who always starts the move was usually
[37:28] the one who is led of God and then Satan
[37:30] comes after God does something and tries
[37:32] to pervert the move and try to deceive
[37:36] people but it's just like in the days of
[37:38] Moses Moses didn't copy anybody Moses
[37:41] was the starter of the move of God and
[37:43] so was William Branham he started the
[37:46] move of God amen
[37:47] now here next we have a testimony of
[37:49] William Upshaw and you can even hear his
[37:51] voice from 1951 international it's
[38:00] February 1961 issue
[38:02] wrote in Bible days there were men of
[38:04] God who were prophets and seers but in
[38:07] all the sacred records none of these
[38:08] have a greater ministry than that of
[38:10] William Brandt a prophet and seer of God
[38:12] brandon has been used by God in the name
[38:15] of Jesus to raise the dead the late
[38:19] worldwide evangelist Tommy Osborne has
[38:21] said William Branham came our way as a
[38:23] prophet of God and showed us in the 20th
[38:26] century precisely the same things that
[38:28] were shown us in the Gospels so now we
[38:31] have a few more witnesses of prominent
[38:33] worldwide evangelist like Tommy Osbourne
[38:36] and this the voice of healing editors
[38:39] they were right they were witnessing all
[38:41] the healings and miracles in those days
[38:43] and they recognized that of all the
[38:45] gifts that God had given to these men to
[38:47] do divine healing William branham's gift
[38:50] surpassed all of them and he had the
[38:52] most we'd say the most anointing he was
[38:56] closest to the scripture he was the one
[38:58] God was using in the most spectacular
[39:00] ways and now I believe it's the
[39:03] testimony of congressman Upshaw so
[39:05] forgive me
[39:07] the Holy Spirit vindicated the ministry
[39:10] william branham time and time again by
[39:12] infallible proofs such as the morality
[39:14] of the United States congressman we in
[39:17] the up draw at the age of 84 after 66
[39:22] years of being a paraplegic while bound
[39:24] to a wheelchair and crutches the
[39:26] congressman who served eight years in
[39:28] Congress from 1919 to 1927
[39:31] groaning widely dispersed pamphlet that
[39:34] you can download and enjoy today that
[39:36] detailed the miraculous presence of the
[39:38] Holy Spirit that came down and healed
[39:40] him during a healing campaign of brother
[39:43] Branham and earned Baxter so I'll pause
[39:46] that right there here's a picture of
[39:48] congressman Upshaw one of brother
[39:49] branham's meetings look at all those
[39:50] people because in those days God was
[39:53] moving in a tremendous way in divine
[39:55] healing and so it attracted thousands
[39:57] and thousands of people so he was in a
[39:59] wheelchair for 66 years he came to a
[40:01] Branham meeting and then now and then he
[40:04] got healed and he stood up and then he
[40:05] wrote an article about it and sent it
[40:07] out to everybody he knew then the Lord
[40:16] said William Branham earned Baxter
[40:18] either side with their ministry of
[40:20] healing in Calvary's criticism time man
[40:23] then suddenly Calvary temple was lit
[40:26] with heavens flame I threw away my
[40:28] crutches and walked in Christ dear name
[40:31] yesterday today forever Christ they got
[40:35] the same my Savior and my healer oh
[40:37] praise His Majesty halls are right there
[40:49] that's the actual voice of William
[40:50] Upshaw after he's healed he preaches
[40:53] three or four times a day and he's 84
[40:55] years old if God healed you after 66
[40:58] years you'd probably do the same once
[40:59] yeah for the brothers and the sisters
[41:01] you witness and testify and this is
[41:04] brother Branham and William Upshaw
[41:06] talking in 1951 this is a United States
[41:08] congressman so that means the power of
[41:11] God was known in the White House back
[41:12] then
[41:13] amen
[41:25] [Music]
[41:33] [Music]
[41:58] praise the Lord let's give that round
[42:00] Baz amen
[42:01] so this nation you know cannot say that
[42:04] God has not spoken to it because God
[42:06] reached all the way to the white house
[42:08] and God showed his supernatural power
[42:11] all the way there to Congress now here's
[42:14] the next testimony I want to share in
[42:18] 2010 I met a woman by the name of sister
[42:21] Humes I forget personai but anyways I
[42:25] met her in 2010 she was an older woman
[42:27] at that time since a few years ago she
[42:30] went home to be with the Lord she passed
[42:32] away but when I was there I preached and
[42:35] she came up to me afterwards she was
[42:36] pushing her husband in the wheelchair
[42:38] and she said brother Jessie she said you
[42:40] preach exactly what brother Branham
[42:41] preached and that made me feel real good
[42:44] because that's what I want to preach I
[42:45] want to preach the Bible because I know
[42:47] brother Branham preached the Bible it
[42:48] was quite humbling and sister Humes
[42:51] here's a picture of her
[42:52] she went to Branham tabernacle from
[42:55] around 1960 to 1965 until the time
[42:59] brother Branham passed away and the
[43:03] testimony behind her is that she was
[43:05] dying of tuberculosis in 1955 so four
[43:10] years after that recording we just heard
[43:12] with William Upshaw she was dying of
[43:14] tuberculosis had no children and her
[43:18] husband was all you know flustered upset
[43:21] well she went to a meeting of William
[43:22] Branham and she got in the prayer line
[43:24] and she got to stand right in front of
[43:27] brother Branham and here's what brother
[43:29] Branham said to her now I didn't have
[43:31] time to put the the audio on here but I
[43:33] could get it for you food
[43:34] listen to it her brother Graham said
[43:36] you're thin lady and tired night sweats
[43:38] no one has to tell you what it is you
[43:41] know that the doctor can't do it but
[43:43] that's the first disease that Jesus
[43:45] cured you believe that don't you I TB or
[43:48] tuberculosis is no more to him he can
[43:51] just make you well in a moment do you
[43:53] believe it come forward and then he lays
[43:55] his hands on sister Humes almighty god
[43:58] the omnipotent God omniscient the
[44:00] resurrected Lord Jesus this poor little
[44:03] woman standing here dying Lord Satan as
[44:05] did this evil and she's trying and I
[44:10] take charge over him so over Satan
[44:13] through the authority of the Bible and
[44:16] through God's Eternal Word and I condemn
[44:18] Satan in Jesus Christ name turn the
[44:21] woman loose and may she go and be made
[44:23] well amen now this is the main part of
[44:26] her testimony because brother Graham
[44:29] said god bless you sister tell you what
[44:31] to do whether I told you the truth or
[44:34] not so maybe she was struggling with am
[44:36] I gonna be healed or not brother Branham
[44:38] said you go Monday and weh-weh yourself
[44:40] on a scale then next Monday way again
[44:44] see what I've told you
[44:46] amen and sister Humes testimony was at
[44:49] that next Monday she went weighed
[44:50] herself she was one pound more and with
[44:53] tuberculosis you don't gain weight you
[44:55] just lose weight she said the next
[44:57] Monday she was another pound heavier and
[44:59] it just kept going until she was back to
[45:01] her full weight and she had numerous
[45:04] children after that this is one of her
[45:05] sons
[45:06] he's the pastor in North Carolina I just
[45:09] preached for him back in December and
[45:11] January his name is Tim Humes and then
[45:14] he's had children and a grandchildren
[45:16] and so God through the prayer William
[45:19] Branham healed this woman and now this
[45:22] woman has a great legacy her children
[45:24] and children's children are serving the
[45:26] Lord so I thought that would be a great
[45:28] encouragement to know that I've met
[45:31] people who were healed in the meetings
[45:33] of brother Branham so I'm a I'm a second
[45:36] hand of witness of what God did in those
[45:37] meetings because I'm too young to be a
[45:38] first hand but this man will tell you
[45:43] the testimony if you'd like to talk to
[45:44] him have his phone number if you'd like
[45:45] to contact him a true man of God
[45:48] in fact when we were down there they
[45:49] were just worshipping and thanking God
[45:51] three people were healed of cancer in
[45:53] the last month of their last month of
[45:56] their church three people have been
[45:58] healed of cancer so our God is the
[46:01] greatest God he's the only God he's the
[46:03] only living God and his name is Jesus
[46:05] Christ and so we're so thankful to know
[46:10] that God moved through William Branham
[46:12] and he's still moving today because
[46:14] Jesus is the same yesterday today and
[46:16] forever so that's a another testimony so
[46:21] if the photo was legitimate and all
[46:24] these testimonies are legitimate then
[46:26] how else do we know he was a genuine
[46:29] prophet well here's here's one thought
[46:32] on it the Bible says this the Bible says
[46:36] in Deuteronomy 18 if you say in your
[46:38] heart how should we know the word which
[46:41] the prop which the Lord hath not spoken
[46:44] okay
[46:45] so Moses told the people this is how you
[46:48] know if God did not send this person as
[46:51] a prophet when a prophet speaks in the
[46:53] name of the Lord if the thing follow not
[46:55] nor come to pass that is the thing which
[46:58] the Lord hath not spoken but the prophet
[47:00] has spoken it presumptuously thou shalt
[47:04] not be afraid of him so this is how you
[47:07] measure a prophet if he says thus say at
[47:09] the Lord and it comes to pass then you
[47:11] know it was God and I have a few
[47:14] examples here there's video on our
[47:17] website - I did a video on three of
[47:19] brother branham's prophecies that we can
[47:22] clearly say have come to pass or are in
[47:26] the process of coming to pass in other
[47:28] words they have stood true since the
[47:30] moment he said them so we're gonna watch
[47:33] a video on these three if you want to
[47:35] write them down you can the first one is
[47:37] the one that we know without a shadow of
[47:40] a doubt has been fulfilled brother
[47:43] Branham prophesied that the Churches of
[47:45] the United States would get more and
[47:48] more immoral he said he saw a vision and
[47:51] I'll you'll listen to a little bit he
[47:52] saw a vision he said this is thus saith
[47:54] the Lord about the churches in America
[47:57] so we know that has literally come to
[47:59] pass
[48:00] the two that are in the process of
[48:02] coming to pass are the last two that I
[48:06] put up here number two and three there
[48:08] will be no greater ministry to the
[48:10] Gentiles than the ministry that God gave
[48:12] to William Branham now he didn't say
[48:14] that in Pride
[48:15] but he just said it in the truth that it
[48:18] was it was just true his gift which
[48:21] we're gonna see also in a few moments
[48:23] was the the greatest gift the Gentile
[48:26] people would ever see and I think you'll
[48:28] agree after watching it there could be
[48:30] no greater gift than what God gave to
[48:32] William Branham because it was Jesus is
[48:36] it was Jesus's gift in William branham's
[48:38] life and the third prophecy that is
[48:41] still standing today is that brother
[48:43] Branham said thus saith the Lord no
[48:46] denomination will return to the original
[48:48] Bible faith and that that prophecy is
[48:52] still standing today and so we're
[48:54] thankful for those three and member this
[48:56] is how we know if he was a prophet if if
[48:58] he said thus saith the Lord and it came
[49:00] to pass or it's in the process of coming
[49:03] to pass then we know he's a true man of
[49:05] God but if any of these would have
[49:07] failed then we would know he was not a
[49:09] true man of God so we know he's a true
[49:12] man of God amen so let's watch this
[49:17] video this video is going to be a little
[49:18] bit longer and we're gonna look at how
[49:22] these three prophecies are fulfilled or
[49:25] in the process of being fulfilled and
[49:28] I'll probably stop at a few points and
[49:29] make a few points that I want to make by
[49:32] God's grace whoops
[49:33] bear with me alright so here's the next
[49:37] one now I may have to take it back and
[49:39] may need to rewind sorry let me pause
[49:45] that go back here I skipped a little bit
[49:56] and in reality at that time history says
[50:01] that rock and roll itself and musicians
[50:02] like Elvis Presley were denounced by
[50:05] most clergy members but William Branham
[50:07] was given a vision that predicted the
[50:09] churches would soon embrace rock and
[50:11] roll and other worldly practices let's
[50:13] listen to the
[50:16] so this is the actual voice of brother
[50:18] Branham prophesying in 1965 brother
[50:21] Graham sees a vision what does the
[50:23] church United States gonna look like in
[50:24] the future and he says it's thus saith
[50:26] the Lord
[50:27] so now he's speaking like Moses spoke
[50:29] right now he's speaking like Ezekiel and
[50:32] Jeremiah and Samuel he's speaking as a
[50:34] prophet you turn it up a little bit just
[50:41] the twisting walk to rock'n'roll and I
[50:57] said is that the Church of the United
[51:00] States okay so hope everybody could
[51:05] understand that he sees the vision of
[51:07] what what is Miss USA what is the
[51:09] churches of USA going to be about toward
[51:11] the end time and they're going to be
[51:13] immorally dressed they're not going to
[51:15] be dressed in covering up their bodies
[51:16] the way they should they're gonna be
[51:19] addicted to smoking and and they're
[51:20] going to be they're going to love rock
[51:22] and roll right and then he says that's
[51:26] the stay at the Lord that's the vision
[51:28] the Lord showed me the immoral condition
[51:34] today's United States urges would be in
[51:35] and correctly prophesied of what God
[51:38] showed him in many churches today their
[51:40] worship services closely resemble a rock
[51:42] and roll concert due to the popularity
[51:44] and influence of the lucrative business
[51:47] of Christian contemporary music along
[51:49] with that many church members enjoy
[51:51] listening to rock and roll music and do
[51:53] not see it as a sinful act anymore
[51:55] although used to be considered sinful
[51:57] many church members see no problem
[51:59] single on and dancing to worldly rock
[52:00] and roll in their homes cars at weddings
[52:03] restaurants and other social gatherings
[52:07] prophecy number two to the greater
[52:10] ministry to the Gentiles
[52:11] meaning William branham's ministry from
[52:13] Jesus Christ would be the last signs of
[52:16] the Gentile people before the second
[52:18] coming of Jesus Christ now let me pause
[52:21] this this is very in critical that we
[52:23] watch this watch the Ministry of William
[52:26] Branham and
[52:27] I'll just summarize it brother branham
[52:29] would have sick people or people that
[52:31] need a prayer come up to him and as he
[52:34] was talking to them God would show him
[52:35] visions and then he would tell each
[52:37] person the secrets of their heart and it
[52:41] never failed it was always thus saith
[52:43] the Lord and I'm gonna show you one case
[52:44] where he showed a woman 15 things 15
[52:47] secrets about her life now only Jesus
[52:50] Christ could do that nobody here could
[52:52] do that I can't do that no one can do
[52:54] that it had to bend Jesus Christ that's
[52:56] why we say his gift was the greatest
[52:59] possible gift you could have because it
[53:01] was Jesus Christ showing him a vision
[53:03] showing him all the secrets and then
[53:06] knowing things that no man can know only
[53:08] God could do that and that's why we say
[53:10] it is the greatest gift and the the last
[53:13] I'm sorry the greatest ministry before
[53:15] the rapture before the time of the
[53:17] Gentiles is over fifty years ago William
[53:24] Branham repeatedly prophesied that no
[53:26] ministry would arise to the Gentiles
[53:28] which are non-jews that would be greater
[53:30] than the ministry that Jesus Christ gave
[53:32] to him we REM said that God told him his
[53:35] ministry was the last sign and the
[53:37] greatest sign to the Gentiles before the
[53:39] second coming of Jesus Christ he also
[53:41] told us that the next great ministry on
[53:43] the earth after his would be that of the
[53:46] two Jewish prophets of Revelation
[53:48] chapter 11 the Bible plainly shows that
[53:53] were in the last day
[53:54] [Music]
[53:55] I'm fairly young yet I'm 53 years old
[54:18] [Music]
[54:25] what mean William Rand is minister he's
[54:27] so unique why would the Spirit of God
[54:29] make such a bold claim we didn't read
[54:32] him had a prophetic gift of discernment
[54:33] that could tell people that our thoughts
[54:34] and secrets of their hearts William Rand
[54:37] his prophetic gift was the fulfillment
[54:38] of Luke 17 30 the revealing of this
[54:41] the man to the Gentiles this prophetic
[54:44] gift was simply the return of the same
[54:46] gift that the Lord Jesus himself
[54:47] exercised in Saint John chapter 1 with
[54:50] Peter Nathanael and in Saint John
[54:52] chapter 4 with the Samaritan woman at
[54:54] the well
[54:55] immediately after the Samaritan woman's
[54:57] simple secret of having six men in our
[54:59] life was revealed by Jesus prophetic
[55:01] gift she knew the gift of a prophet was
[55:04] present with her where she said sir I
[55:06] perceived a tower to prophet in Saint
[55:08] John 4:19 later in verse 29 she said
[55:12] common see a man which told me all the
[55:14] things I ever did is not this the Christ
[55:17] now let's watch as God lets William
[55:19] Branham manifest the same prophetic gift
[55:21] a discernment that Jesus did this son of
[55:24] man and gift in his life were revealed
[55:26] 15 secrets to a patient in this
[55:28] particular parent line from 1954 so now
[55:32] we're gonna watch as brother Branham
[55:34] does the same thing Jesus Christ it
[55:36] because it was Jesus Christ taking over
[55:39] brother branham's body and that's all a
[55:41] gift is a gift is when the Holy Spirit
[55:43] takes over you and I and then God does
[55:45] what he wants to do so brother Branham
[55:48] gets no praise brother Branham gets no
[55:49] thanks all the glory goes to Jesus but
[55:52] remember the Holy Spirit said thus saith
[55:55] the Lord
[55:55] there will be no greater sign than this
[55:58] given to the Gentiles so this must be an
[56:00] amazing powerful gift and 15 secrets he
[56:05] tells to one woman
[56:50] your window he just told her what ten
[57:02] things that were true one after another
[57:04] because he's seeing in a vision just
[57:05] like Jesus saw the visions because Jesus
[57:08] said I do nothing except the father show
[57:10] me first
[57:11] so everything Jesus did the father
[57:13] showed him in a vision and then he would
[57:14] go do it and this is the same thing
[57:16] Jesus is doing the brother branham he's
[57:18] showing him visions and then letting the
[57:21] people know that God knows their hearts
[57:23] and lifes and God wants to heal them
[57:55] this is powerful he goes he sees more
[57:58] vision he tells her her name what city
[58:01] she lives in and her address and then he
[58:03] says you're going home to be well only
[58:06] Jesus Christ could do that
[58:08] remember this is a very similar thing to
[58:10] what he did to my well the my
[58:12] acquaintance that I met mrs. Hulme
[58:13] sister Humes the very same thing he said
[58:17] if you're not sure go measure yourself
[58:19] on Monday and then the Monday after he
[58:21] saw on a vision if she goes and measures
[58:23] herself she's gonna start gaining weight
[58:25] and she's gonna be healed so this is the
[58:27] this is the gift of a prophet the gift
[58:30] of a seer someone who knows the will of
[58:32] God
[58:37] [Music]
[58:57] thank you Jesus he's God
[59:08] the reason we believe this last sign
[59:11] prophecy is in the process of being
[59:13] fulfilled over fifty years later is
[59:15] because no preacher has ever manifested
[59:17] the power of Jesus Christ on or near the
[59:19] same level as the ministry that God gave
[59:21] to William Branham churches today have
[59:23] grown in attendance and finances and
[59:26] preachers have written more books and
[59:27] had worldwide television ministries but
[59:30] no gift has ever risen that compares to
[59:32] the prophetic son of man gift that God
[59:34] gave to William Branham where's the
[59:35] gifted man that can tell strangers their
[59:38] name their address their sickness and
[59:40] many other details of their lives by
[59:42] receiving visions from Jesus Christ we
[59:44] have not seen a man do this infallibly
[59:46] since William Branham ministered to
[59:48] God's people
[59:49] all right I'll pause right there okay
[59:52] there's a little more on congressman
[59:54] Upshaw but I hope everybody saw it by
[59:57] God's grace that this gift was so
[1:00:00] powerful it packed out stadiums this was
[1:00:04] such a powerful gift the reason it was
[1:00:06] rejected is because the message that
[1:00:08] came after it brother Branham would
[1:00:11] preach and he would pray for the sick
[1:00:12] people would be healed but then when
[1:00:14] brother Branham started preaching what
[1:00:15] the Bible says people didn't like it
[1:00:17] anymore and that just proves he was a
[1:00:20] true prophet of God but this gift in his
[1:00:22] life was a true gift of God it was a
[1:00:24] prophet gift
[1:00:25] a discernment gift and no gift has ever
[1:00:29] risen that's greater than this gift can
[1:00:32] anybody raise your hand tell me a
[1:00:33] greater gift on TV or has anyone ever
[1:00:35] seen a greater gift on a preacher than
[1:00:37] this I was I hear is cricket's
[1:00:40] of course not no no one has ever seen
[1:00:43] anything as close to this where it would
[1:00:45] tell them thoughts and in secrets of
[1:00:47] their heart and tell them parts of their
[1:00:49] lives that no one else would know no no
[1:00:52] one has even seen a gift close to this
[1:00:54] so that's why we know no greater gift
[1:00:56] will no greater ministry will rise
[1:00:58] before the rapture
[1:01:00] that's thus saith the Lord so we have
[1:01:02] confidence in that because that's what
[1:01:04] God told His Prophet to say now here's a
[1:01:07] little more on I may skip past this
[1:01:09] because we already watched the part on
[1:01:10] when Upshaw earlier further okay so
[1:01:20] here's the last one no return of
[1:01:22] Christian denominations to the pure
[1:01:25] teaching of the Bible in 1965 william
[1:01:30] prophesied the denominational churches
[1:01:32] would never break up their denominations
[1:01:34] and come back to preaching and living
[1:01:36] the true Word of God their worship would
[1:01:38] not resemble the book of Acts church
[1:01:39] which had supernatural power gives to
[1:01:42] the spirit the baptism of the Holy Ghost
[1:01:44] and Christian Holiness the reason we
[1:02:04] know this prophecy is in the process of
[1:02:06] coming to pass is because in the past 49
[1:02:08] years all denominations whether Catholic
[1:02:11] or Protestant have failed to break up
[1:02:12] their denominations and denounced their
[1:02:14] man-made bylaws and traditions of men
[1:02:16] most of nominations have little to no
[1:02:19] religion that resembles the true church
[1:02:20] in the book of Acts and the signs that
[1:02:22] Jesus said would follow true believers
[1:02:24] in mark chapter 16 such as speaking in
[1:02:27] tongues healing the sick and casting out
[1:02:29] Devils
[1:02:29] all of these are missing from many
[1:02:31] congregations all right let's give that
[1:02:34] round pause amen amen
[1:02:38] all right so we'll keep going here by
[1:02:41] the grace of the Lord I hope that's
[1:02:43] three powerful vindications like I
[1:02:46] showed there there's three powerful
[1:02:48] times that God had his prophets say thus
[1:02:51] saith the Lord and it's either come to
[1:02:53] pass this has clearly come to pass
[1:02:55] my mom was raised in church and she
[1:02:57] never saw rock-and-roll coming to the
[1:02:59] church into the last 15 or 20 years so
[1:03:01] brother Branham saw that fifty years in
[1:03:04] advance and he prophesied of it and said
[1:03:06] thus saith the Lord rock and roll's come
[1:03:08] into the churches and it has come so we
[1:03:11] know it's coming to pass
[1:03:12] also we've never seen a greater ministry
[1:03:14] than that of brother Branham and no
[1:03:16] denomination whether Baptist or
[1:03:17] Protestant or Catholic no denomination
[1:03:20] has ever broken up and say you know
[1:03:21] we're gonna we're gonna forsake all of
[1:03:23] our traditions we just want to believe
[1:03:24] the
[1:03:25] they've never done it and they can't
[1:03:27] because it's thus saith the Lord all
[1:03:29] right now let's keep moving here by
[1:03:30] God's grace so why did we need thus
[1:03:38] sayeth the Lord I have some scriptures
[1:03:41] here because Paul said evil men and
[1:03:44] seducers are gonna wax worse and worse
[1:03:47] deceiving and being deceived we needed
[1:03:49] someone to come and say thus saith the
[1:03:51] Lord because there's so many men out
[1:03:52] there tricking people especially when it
[1:03:56] comes to the Bible and that's what Paul
[1:03:57] said this was 2,000 years ago
[1:03:59] Jesus said the same thing jesus said
[1:04:02] something very similar he said go into
[1:04:04] the strait gate why does the gate broad
[1:04:06] is the way that leads to destruction
[1:04:08] many there be which go in thereat
[1:04:11] because Strait is the gate narrows the
[1:04:14] way which leadeth unto life and look at
[1:04:15] this this is reality few there be that
[1:04:18] find it
[1:04:19] Jesus Christ Himself said few people
[1:04:22] will be saved and yet we have more
[1:04:24] churches today than we've ever had and
[1:04:25] yet Jesus said fewer people will be
[1:04:29] saved and there's gonna be more
[1:04:30] deception in the end time that's why we
[1:04:32] needed thus saith the Lord praise the
[1:04:34] Lord and Paul said even more about these
[1:04:38] last days Paul said in the last days
[1:04:40] perilous times will come for men should
[1:04:43] be lovers of their own selves covetous
[1:04:46] boasters proud blasphemers disobedient
[1:04:49] to parents unthankful and unholy and the
[1:04:54] Bible said they'll be lovers of
[1:04:55] pleasures more than lovers of God on
[1:04:58] this next slide here and this is where
[1:05:01] we're at today people say they love God
[1:05:03] but their lives show that they love sin
[1:05:06] more than they actually love God and
[1:05:07] this is the condition that we live in so
[1:05:11] of course God would have to send
[1:05:12] somebody to the earth and give them thus
[1:05:14] saith the Lord to speak to his people
[1:05:17] and to get them on the straight in there
[1:05:19] aren't you glad to be on the straight
[1:05:20] and narrow
[1:05:21] hey man I'm so thankful that God has
[1:05:24] sent us thus saith the Lord and we need
[1:05:27] thus saith the Lord because the Bible
[1:05:28] said Satan was going to deceive the
[1:05:30] whole world like Paul said already the
[1:05:32] Bible said the devil Satan deceives the
[1:05:34] whole world so that means every nation
[1:05:37] is going to be to see
[1:05:38] except for a very few small group of
[1:05:41] people the Bible also said Satan is the
[1:05:45] god of this evil age in 2nd Corinthians
[1:05:49] 4 3 so really he's the one that's
[1:05:51] getting most of the worship is Satan
[1:05:53] because they're not worshiping God
[1:05:55] according to the Bible amen and that
[1:05:59] paints quite a picture that most people
[1:06:01] think they're saved when they're not
[1:06:03] because it's deception they've been
[1:06:06] deceived into thinking they are saved so
[1:06:10] God had to send us thus saith the Lord
[1:06:11] and remember this - we needed the stay
[1:06:15] at the Lord because the Beast which is
[1:06:16] the Antichrist spirit is going to cause
[1:06:19] everyone small and great rich and poor
[1:06:21] free and bond to receive a mark in their
[1:06:24] right hand or in their foreheads there's
[1:06:27] coming a great deception where it's
[1:06:28] going to be so tricky is this does God
[1:06:31] want us to take this mark or not and so
[1:06:34] God had to send thus saith the LORD so
[1:06:36] we know not to take of the mark of the
[1:06:38] beast it's gonna look good it's gonna
[1:06:40] look like it's the right thing but it's
[1:06:42] gonna be a lot it's gonna be a deception
[1:06:43] and so God had to send thus saith the
[1:06:46] LORD - tell us what the mark of the
[1:06:48] beast is and we'll get to that in a few
[1:06:50] moments now it's going to be so
[1:06:56] mark of the beast is gonna be so
[1:06:57] personal you and I or whoever it is
[1:06:59] maybe if we don't live to see it they're
[1:07:01] not gonna be able to buy or sell without
[1:07:02] taking the mark so Satan knows how to
[1:07:05] create a trap he's gonna make people
[1:07:07] choose the true faith over finances and
[1:07:11] most people are gonna choose finances
[1:07:12] over the true faith but we believe by
[1:07:15] God's grace we'll be out of here before
[1:07:16] that markets laid down because we see
[1:07:19] that that same pattern in the Holy Bible
[1:07:21] God always takes away his people before
[1:07:24] destruction so we always see that so
[1:07:27] which one would you choose hopefully you
[1:07:29] would choose the Word of God and
[1:07:31] believing the truth over finances amen
[1:07:34] that's what God wants you to choose
[1:07:36] praise God now despite the growing
[1:07:42] deception God promised to restore now I
[1:07:46] don't have the time because I told you I
[1:07:47] want to keep it short but these five
[1:07:50] scriptures if you want to write these
[1:07:51] down or I can give them to you
[1:07:52] afterwards if you put these five
[1:07:54] scriptures together you will see what
[1:07:58] God is doing right now God is sending us
[1:08:01] the God has sent us thus saith the Lord
[1:08:02] and we are receiving it living it and
[1:08:06] spreading it around the world that's
[1:08:08] what God is doing right now how many
[1:08:11] know that to be the truth it's totally
[1:08:13] in the Bible it's thoroughly taught
[1:08:15] through the scripture I don't have time
[1:08:17] because I don't want to wear you out
[1:08:18] tonight
[1:08:19] but here's a summary of what all these
[1:08:23] scriptures say Jesus will remain in
[1:08:26] heaven so he will not come until the
[1:08:30] hearts of the end time believers are
[1:08:33] restored to obedience through the
[1:08:37] revealed mysteries of the Bible that
[1:08:39] came by an Elijah anointed prophet so if
[1:08:45] you if you read those scriptures in your
[1:08:47] in your quiet time read those I can make
[1:08:50] copies everything if you read those you
[1:08:52] will see Jesus said Elijah must come and
[1:08:54] restore all things and Jesus will remain
[1:08:57] in heaven until everything is restored
[1:08:59] you will see that this had to happen and
[1:09:03] just so you know William Branham was
[1:09:04] that elijah anointed prophet amen
[1:09:09] and he revealed the mysteries of God
[1:09:10] which we'll be talking about on July 20
[1:09:13] seconds on the back there will be
[1:09:15] showing those 12 New Testament mysteries
[1:09:17] by the grace of God okay so let me skip
[1:09:24] ahead here like I said I want to be
[1:09:26] mindful the time I don't want to wear
[1:09:28] you out
[1:09:28] so to summarize it again the the message
[1:09:32] of the hour so the thus saith the lord
[1:09:34] of the hour involves three r's and this
[1:09:36] is on the video - on our website but
[1:09:39] just to kind of shorten it God is
[1:09:41] revealing the word revealing the
[1:09:44] mysteries restoring our hearts back to
[1:09:47] the faith of the Apostolic fathers and
[1:09:49] then he's gonna rapture the Christians
[1:09:52] off the earth those are the three hours
[1:09:54] and I'll just say I could say it this -
[1:09:57] he's gonna reveal the Bible mysteries
[1:09:58] restore the hearts and then rapture the
[1:10:01] bride off the earth that is what God is
[1:10:04] doing right now and I'm thankful to be a
[1:10:08] part of it by God's grace so thankful
[1:10:12] now if Jesus does this if Jesus does
[1:10:17] these three hours then that would make
[1:10:19] himself the same yesterday today and
[1:10:22] forever how many want to serve a god
[1:10:24] the same God that was in the Bible that
[1:10:26] we read every day that's the kind of god
[1:10:28] I want to serve well that's what brother
[1:10:30] Banias ministry did it brought us the
[1:10:32] reality of Jesus Christ that Jesus
[1:10:34] Christ is here he's the same yesterday
[1:10:37] today and forever that's what the
[1:10:41] ministry was to do and that's what we're
[1:10:43] enjoying today by the grace of the Lord
[1:10:47] now next before I show some of these
[1:10:51] thus saith the Lord statements let me
[1:10:53] give a little bit of a warning here I
[1:10:55] just want to give a little bit of
[1:10:56] warning cuz some of these are very
[1:10:57] personal especially to our our live
[1:10:59] streamers anyone who would watch it
[1:11:01] before I say the thus saith the Lord's
[1:11:03] for today that brother Branham gave us
[1:11:05] you have to know they're out of the
[1:11:07] Bible everything he said that was thus
[1:11:09] saith the Lord you can find in the Bible
[1:11:11] okay but let me just give a little brief
[1:11:13] warning here before I read these the
[1:11:16] Word of God will reveal the heart
[1:11:19] conditions in other words when you read
[1:11:20] the Bible
[1:11:22] you disagree with something it shows
[1:11:23] your heart is not in the right condition
[1:11:25] but if you agree with God's Word then it
[1:11:28] shows your heart is getting into the
[1:11:29] right condition and anytime you read the
[1:11:32] Bible it reveals your heart condition
[1:11:34] because Jesus is the word of God the
[1:11:37] Word of God is Jesus's nature remember
[1:11:40] the scripture Simeon told Mary that
[1:11:43] Jesus would reveal the thoughts of many
[1:11:46] hearts so when Jesus came he was
[1:11:48] preaching preaching preaching because he
[1:11:50] was God's Word he was preaching and
[1:11:53] teaching and however they responded to
[1:11:55] it showed what was in their hearts so
[1:11:58] the Apostles they believed it showed so
[1:12:00] it showed they had good hearts but the
[1:12:02] Pharisees and Sadducees the Herodians
[1:12:05] who rejected it it showed their hearts
[1:12:07] were not right with God because they
[1:12:09] rejected the truth of God's Word and so
[1:12:11] the same is true today however we
[1:12:14] respond to thus saith the Lord straight
[1:12:16] out of the Bible it will reveal what's
[1:12:18] in our heart
[1:12:18] how many can say amen to that praise the
[1:12:22] Lord
[1:12:22] because remember the Word of God is like
[1:12:25] a sword it's not like a piece of cotton
[1:12:29] that's all soft it's like a sword it's
[1:12:31] gonna cut it's gonna hurt the human mind
[1:12:34] it's a discerner so it's a judge it's a
[1:12:37] judge of the thoughts and intents of the
[1:12:39] heart the Word of God is sharp a member
[1:12:44] of the Bible said Jesus was the word
[1:12:47] because the Bible said in the beginning
[1:12:48] was the word the Word was with God the
[1:12:50] Word was God and then the Word was made
[1:12:52] flesh so Jesus was the sword made into a
[1:12:55] human he was a walking around sword he
[1:13:00] was the Word of God and so whenever we
[1:13:03] show preach the Word of God it's a sword
[1:13:05] coming forth it's either gonna cut off
[1:13:07] if you let it it's gonna cut off the
[1:13:09] flesh or if not you're gonna be upset
[1:13:11] with it but we want to let the Word of
[1:13:14] God cut off any of our ideas and just
[1:13:16] have a circumcised heart like we said
[1:13:18] this morning and remember the Bible also
[1:13:23] said Jesus's name Jesus has a name
[1:13:25] another name and his name is the Word of
[1:13:27] God
[1:13:28] all right I'm trying to keep going here
[1:13:30] now here's what I mean to do our meaning
[1:13:32] to speak all these things in love so
[1:13:35] going to share some thus saith the Lord
[1:13:37] statements now they're very personal but
[1:13:39] they are straight from the Bible so I
[1:13:41] want to show these by the grace of the
[1:13:43] Lord so thus saith the Lord for today
[1:13:47] now I think this is I'm just gonna show
[1:13:50] that slide right there yeah yeah let me
[1:13:54] just show that one there and I'm gonna I
[1:13:56] didn't have time to get everything on
[1:13:58] here like I wanted to someone to read it
[1:13:59] off of a document here so we can know
[1:14:05] thus saith the Lord for today and again
[1:14:08] I'm saying this with all the the love
[1:14:10] and grace in my heart so the first one I
[1:14:16] think I chose about 15 here I'll try to
[1:14:18] be as brief as I can reading these by
[1:14:22] the grace of the Lord just a moment okay
[1:14:29] this one's not coming up so let me uh oh
[1:14:33] there's okay here we go yes sorry I
[1:14:41] tried to category
[1:14:43] categorize these in a way that you could
[1:14:45] understand it to hopefully it'd be
[1:14:47] pretty simple okay the first thus saith
[1:14:49] the Lord statement is hard for a lot of
[1:14:51] Patriots to hear but the prophet of God
[1:14:53] said thus saith the LORD the God that
[1:14:56] America claims to serve will destroy her
[1:14:59] that's hard to hear but God is going to
[1:15:03] destroy America for all of her sins and
[1:15:05] that's in Revelation chapter 13 we don't
[1:15:08] have time to go through all these but
[1:15:09] this is just to introduce you to the
[1:15:11] stay at the Lord for today now like this
[1:15:13] morning we should pray that things in
[1:15:16] the government change but ultimately we
[1:15:18] know what's going to happen America and
[1:15:20] every nation according to revelation is
[1:15:22] going to take the mark of the beast so
[1:15:24] we know there's no hope for national
[1:15:26] revival but we do want to see the
[1:15:28] individuals around the country that can
[1:15:30] be saved we do in a preach until all the
[1:15:32] individuals are saved but that's thus
[1:15:34] saith the Lord brother Branham said thus
[1:15:37] saith the Lord America will never rise
[1:15:39] again in the faith so America will never
[1:15:42] get back to being a Christian nation
[1:15:44] she'll never rise again spiritually
[1:15:45] she's gonna keep getting more and more
[1:15:47] defiled
[1:15:48] that's thus saith the Lord
[1:15:51] next if you have your Bible first
[1:15:53] Timothy 2:9 here's what brother Branham
[1:15:55] says let me read this it's straight out
[1:15:57] of the Bible and remember that's what
[1:15:58] the prophets did they came to emphasize
[1:16:00] God's Word
[1:16:01] 1st Timothy 2:9 let's read that if you
[1:16:08] got it you can write it down in like
[1:16:10] manner also that women adorn themselves
[1:16:12] in modest apparel with shamefacedness
[1:16:14] and sobriety so if you look at our women
[1:16:18] in here they're modestly dressed they're
[1:16:21] not showing off their bodies women today
[1:16:23] like to show off their their chests
[1:16:25] their behinds their legs their shoulders
[1:16:28] they like to show off everything but the
[1:16:30] Bible says we're not to do that were to
[1:16:33] be modestly dressed and so brother
[1:16:36] Branham said this with thus saith the
[1:16:37] Lord he says these women out here with
[1:16:41] little old tight dresses on and things
[1:16:44] like that men lusting after them they
[1:16:47] think they're decent he said you might
[1:16:50] not have done anything wrong physically
[1:16:52] but let me tell you something he says
[1:16:55] you're a tool for the devil and at the
[1:16:58] judgment bar thus saith the Lord you'll
[1:17:00] answer for committing adultery because
[1:17:03] you dressed immodestly
[1:17:04] and the church said Amen that is tough
[1:17:10] to hear for a lot of people but for
[1:17:12] someone who loves God and loves the
[1:17:14] Bible you could see how God wants us to
[1:17:16] cover our bodies so we don't cause
[1:17:18] others to stumble can everybody see that
[1:17:20] so he says thus saith the Lord we don't
[1:17:23] dress modestly will answer for at the
[1:17:26] day of judgment that sounds like all the
[1:17:29] prophets in the Old Testament as well
[1:17:30] sounds very familiar also here's another
[1:17:34] one that's important 1st Corinthians 11
[1:17:37] where the Bible says that women should
[1:17:41] have short I'm sorry women should have
[1:17:42] long uncut hair or as long as they can
[1:17:44] grow and then men should have short hair
[1:17:47] 1st Corinthians 11 I know this is hard
[1:17:52] but you know when I first heard this my
[1:17:54] hair was long and my fiancee my wife
[1:17:57] Kristen at the time my fiancee
[1:17:59] her hair was little shorter she just got
[1:18:01] her hair cut but after we heard this
[1:18:03] cut my hair she let her hair grow out
[1:18:05] that's because we love the Bible because
[1:18:08] we believe God has truth in his Bible
[1:18:10] how many believe God's Bible is all
[1:18:12] truth amen
[1:18:15] so first Corinthians 11 now we don't
[1:18:19] have time to read the whole chapter but
[1:18:21] if you read the first sixteen verses
[1:18:22] you'll find that a woman was never
[1:18:25] supposed to cut her hair women are not
[1:18:27] supposed to cut their hair in fact you
[1:18:29] will never find one godly woman cutting
[1:18:33] her hair in the entire Bible huh me no
[1:18:35] that's the truth I challenge and I say
[1:18:37] that with the love of God in my heart I
[1:18:39] challenge everyone listening
[1:18:40] livestreaming go read your Bible search
[1:18:42] your Bible you'll never find a godly
[1:18:45] woman cutting her hair because they
[1:18:48] women were to have long hair because it
[1:18:51] represented they were under the full
[1:18:53] authority of their husband and men were
[1:18:56] always supposed to have short hair
[1:18:57] unless they were under a Nazarite vow
[1:18:59] but that was either for a lifetime or
[1:19:02] for just for a short season because the
[1:19:05] Bible says it's a shame for a man when
[1:19:07] he has long hair because he's looking
[1:19:09] like a woman it's a shame for a man to
[1:19:11] have long hair so let's just read that
[1:19:13] one so you know it actually let's read
[1:19:18] verse 6 for if the woman be not covered
[1:19:20] let her also be shorn but if it be a
[1:19:22] shame for a woman to be shorn or shaven
[1:19:23] let her be covered now go down to verse
[1:19:26] 13 judging yourselves is it calmly that
[1:19:30] a woman pray unto God uncovered doth not
[1:19:32] nature even nature itself teach you that
[1:19:35] if a man have long hair it's a shame
[1:19:37] unto Him but if a woman have long hair
[1:19:41] it is a glory to her for her hair is
[1:19:43] given her for a clothes are covering and
[1:19:45] the church said now there you'll never
[1:19:49] find another scripture where Paul says
[1:19:50] well it's okay for the women in the
[1:19:53] Church of Philippians they can cut their
[1:19:54] hair you'll never find that in fact
[1:19:57] you'll find in 1st Corinthians 4:4 verse
[1:19:59] 17 every church was taught the same
[1:20:02] thing by the Apostle Paul Paul name
[1:20:04] never changed one thing he preached he
[1:20:06] preached the same thing to every church
[1:20:08] because Jesus Christ is the same
[1:20:09] yesterday today and forever now brother
[1:20:12] Branham says thus saith Lord I don't
[1:20:14] care how much a woman
[1:20:17] dances or sings or sings in the choir or
[1:20:20] speaks in tongues or runs up and down or
[1:20:22] has some type of Aid Societies if she
[1:20:26] cuts her hair she's dead he says which
[1:20:29] means not born again she's not born
[1:20:32] again if she cuts her hair because the
[1:20:33] Bible says it's a shame for her to cut
[1:20:35] her hair just like it's a shame for a
[1:20:38] man to have long hair all right I know
[1:20:41] that's very personal but we also know
[1:20:43] that's the Word of God and we want to
[1:20:45] let God in every personal area of our
[1:20:46] lives he created us we love Him we want
[1:20:49] him to have his way in our lives
[1:20:51] amen next go to first Timothy 2:12 let's
[1:20:56] go to this one this is a hard one for
[1:20:59] many people to hear but it's thus saith
[1:21:01] the Lord 1st Timothy 2:12 but I suffer
[1:21:07] not a woman to teach nor to assert or
[1:21:09] 'ti over the man but in the Beast I'm
[1:21:11] sorry but to be in silence for Adam was
[1:21:13] first formed then Eve so the lesson
[1:21:16] behind this is that women are not
[1:21:18] supposed to preach they can do any other
[1:21:20] gift they can cast out Devils they can
[1:21:22] speak in tongues they can prophesy they
[1:21:24] can do any other gift but they're not to
[1:21:26] be leaders behind the pulpit and brother
[1:21:30] Branham says this is thus saith the Lord
[1:21:33] he says she ain't got business over any
[1:21:36] authority in the church he says and
[1:21:40] after my going away from the earth he
[1:21:42] says many of you young children will
[1:21:44] find out in the days to come that this
[1:21:46] is exactly the truth because I speak it
[1:21:48] in the name of the Lord so this is thus
[1:21:51] saith the Lord women are not to preach
[1:21:53] men are supposed to preach but then we
[1:21:55] need men that have the Holy Ghost to
[1:21:57] preach and they're not there for a meal
[1:21:59] ticket right we need men that really
[1:22:01] preach the gospel because they love
[1:22:02] Jesus Christ amen
[1:22:04] just a few more can you bear with me a
[1:22:06] few more go to acts 2:38 let's go to
[1:22:10] acts 2:38 I'm trying not to
[1:22:15] got a little bit longer to go bear with
[1:22:17] me maybe hopefully 15 more minutes I've
[1:22:18] already gone longer than I thought but
[1:22:20] god bless you for your your patience
[1:22:22] everybody I didn't want to go too long
[1:22:23] acts 2:38 then Peter said to them repent
[1:22:27] every one of you and be baptized in the
[1:22:29] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[1:22:31] of sins and you shall receive the gift
[1:22:34] of the Holy Ghost now in this statement
[1:22:36] brother Branham is saying to baptize in
[1:22:39] the name of the Lord Jesus Christ is the
[1:22:41] correct water baptism because that's
[1:22:44] what we see in the book of Acts I can
[1:22:46] show you five times when they baptized
[1:22:48] in the book of Acts that they use a
[1:22:49] literal name of Jesus Christ or the Lord
[1:22:52] Jesus Christ
[1:22:54] so brother Han tells us thus saith the
[1:22:56] Lord he said the baptism using the
[1:22:58] titles father son Holy Ghost is false
[1:23:01] thus saith the Lord I command every one
[1:23:05] of you here that hasn't been baptized
[1:23:07] name of Jesus Christ to be baptized
[1:23:09] again in the name of the Lord Jesus so
[1:23:13] we know that when Jesus said Father Son
[1:23:16] and Holy Ghost he wasn't giving the
[1:23:18] formula he was actually revealing the
[1:23:20] mystery that there's one name to God
[1:23:22] there's one name to the father son Holy
[1:23:24] Ghost that one name is the name above
[1:23:26] all names the name of Jesus Christ and
[1:23:29] if you study history knowing baptized
[1:23:31] father son Holy Ghost it's about 70
[1:23:34] years after Jesus had already left
[1:23:36] because they didn't understand the
[1:23:38] revelation that there's one name for God
[1:23:40] amen which the Bible says in Zechariah
[1:23:42] there will be one God in his name one
[1:23:44] there's only one name for God and that's
[1:23:46] the Lord Jesus Christ okay oh my I'm
[1:23:51] just not gonna have a whole lot of time
[1:23:52] here let me let me just do let me do two
[1:23:59] more I promise you two more let me just
[1:24:02] do two more then we'll close with a few
[1:24:03] more scriptures the next one is
[1:24:06] revelation 17 so go to Revelation 17
[1:24:17] 17 verse 5 this is one of the most
[1:24:27] notorious women in the entire Bible this
[1:24:30] symbolic woman called Mystery Babylon
[1:24:31] brother branham tells us who she is
[1:24:34] she's a woman who looks like a Christian
[1:24:37] Church but she's not she's actually
[1:24:39] opposite of Christianity she's actually
[1:24:41] a deceptive Church and again I hate to
[1:24:44] say this but but I've got to tell the
[1:24:46] truth and I'm not against any person in
[1:24:49] these churches were against the system
[1:24:50] because it limits it changes the Word of
[1:24:53] God it perverts the Word of God but God
[1:24:57] is calling all of us people to come out
[1:24:58] false churches and come into the Word of
[1:25:00] God come into the truth come into a true
[1:25:02] church okay
[1:25:04] Rev revelation 17:5 and upon her
[1:25:07] forehead was a name written Mystery
[1:25:08] Babylon the Great the mother of harlots
[1:25:10] and abominations of the earth
[1:25:13] abominations our thing God hates in
[1:25:16] harlots of course are untrue women who
[1:25:18] sell themselves verse 6 and I saw the
[1:25:20] woman drunken with the blood of the
[1:25:22] Saints and with the blood of the martyrs
[1:25:23] of Jesus and when I saw her I wondered
[1:25:25] with great admiration now if you read in
[1:25:30] verse 9 this woman sets on seven
[1:25:32] mountains which are seven hills let's
[1:25:34] all say it out loud who knows who's this
[1:25:36] church is the Roman Catholic Church the
[1:25:39] Roman Catholic Church so as hard as that
[1:25:42] is for me to say I have to say it this
[1:25:44] woman who's a deceptive church is the
[1:25:46] Roman Catholic Church I have friends
[1:25:48] that are Catholic and I love them but my
[1:25:50] desire is that they will come out of the
[1:25:52] Roman Catholic Church because Rome sits
[1:25:55] on seven hills anyone who reads history
[1:25:57] or geography knows that ancient Rome was
[1:26:00] established on Seven Hills and I have a
[1:26:03] video on our website that shows it shows
[1:26:04] 17 proofs that Mystery Babylon is the
[1:26:08] Roman Catholic Church because they exalt
[1:26:10] Mary above Jesus and they pray to Saints
[1:26:14] and Mary thinking that they're being
[1:26:16] heard when they cannot be because Jesus
[1:26:18] is the only mediator between God and man
[1:26:21] he's the only mediator the last one I'll
[1:26:24] do here before we finish up is the mark
[1:26:28] of the beast and brother
[1:26:30] told us marker than he said he said thus
[1:26:33] saith the Lord he said I know it's
[1:26:36] unpopular to speak against organization
[1:26:38] but that's the mark of the beast so the
[1:26:41] mark of the beast is organized religion
[1:26:43] like denominations or even
[1:26:45] non-denominational churches that adhere
[1:26:49] to false teachings all right so I know
[1:26:53] those are personal like I said I could
[1:26:54] have preached about 15 or 20 more but
[1:26:57] let's finish up here all right
[1:26:59] I read the best those are just a few
[1:27:02] thus say enough to kind of catch
[1:27:05] somebody's attention and all these
[1:27:09] things we've seen hope the hope that's
[1:27:10] enough to catch everybody's attention
[1:27:11] all right so what's this mean for you
[1:27:13] and I today what says thus saith the
[1:27:15] Lord mean for you and I today first it
[1:27:17] means we need to pray and listen to
[1:27:19] sermons and seek God to decide if this
[1:27:21] man was a true prophet or not because if
[1:27:24] he was true then God will require his
[1:27:26] words from us if he was false then we
[1:27:29] forgetting forget about him but if he's
[1:27:31] true God will require that we listen to
[1:27:34] when he said thus saith the Lord ii pray
[1:27:38] again listen to sermons again ask god
[1:27:40] again to help you live the original
[1:27:43] faith of the apostles we want to live
[1:27:45] the way they lived at the very beginning
[1:27:46] of the church in the book of Acts we
[1:27:48] want to be a book of Acts Church don't
[1:27:50] we amen we don't want just formal
[1:27:52] Creed's and traditions of men we want
[1:27:54] the Living Christ amongst us amen and
[1:27:57] also on my webpage here I've got over 50
[1:28:01] videos that teach all these revelations
[1:28:03] that brother to us so you're more of
[1:28:07] course everyone's encouraged online go
[1:28:09] to that page
[1:28:10] pastor Jesse Smith and these are none of
[1:28:12] my teachings their Bible teachings that
[1:28:15] God gave to His Prophet and I'm just
[1:28:17] prophesying again what the prophets
[1:28:19] already said that's all I'm doing it's
[1:28:21] not my thoughts it's God's Word
[1:28:25] third listen and pray to the sermons
[1:28:28] again ask God to help you find a church
[1:28:30] that preaches the message of the hour
[1:28:32] the thus saith the Lord for today the
[1:28:35] revelation the restoration so you can be
[1:28:38] prepared for the rapture you can only
[1:28:42] live as high as the preaching
[1:28:44] that you hear before I heard this
[1:28:47] message I never could overcome
[1:28:49] pornography cussing addictions of drugs
[1:28:53] I could never overcome that but after I
[1:28:55] heard this message God has helped me
[1:28:57] overcome all of those because the Word
[1:29:00] was so much higher it gave me even more
[1:29:02] power because the word is power it will
[1:29:04] give you power to overcome all the sins
[1:29:07] of this world but we've got to fall in
[1:29:10] love with Jesus Christ
[1:29:11] and Jesus Christ is the word the last
[1:29:16] call of the Holy Spirit is the Holy
[1:29:21] Spirit's calling come out of her this
[1:29:23] this woman come out of the Catholic
[1:29:25] Church come out of denominational
[1:29:27] churches come out of churches that are
[1:29:29] preaching false things come out of her
[1:29:31] that you be not partakers of her sins
[1:29:33] and her plagues and brothers and sisters
[1:29:37] I'm not proselyting I'm not saying join
[1:29:39] my church I'm saying you're welcome to
[1:29:42] come here we preach the truth we preach
[1:29:43] the message of the hour but go to a
[1:29:45] church that preaches the full gospel go
[1:29:48] to the church that believes Jesus Christ
[1:29:50] is the same yesterday today and forever
[1:29:51] and believes that the book of Acts is
[1:29:53] still going on today we are see where
[1:29:56] this is a kind of a touchy situation
[1:29:58] we're supposed to call them out of
[1:30:00] churches it looks like we're proselyting
[1:30:03] but we're not we're trying to get them
[1:30:05] washed in the blood of Jesus because to
[1:30:09] us it's not about numbers it's not about
[1:30:10] big buildings it's not about a bigger
[1:30:12] denomination it's about getting the
[1:30:14] people washed in the blood of Jesus and
[1:30:16] ready for the rapture that's what it's
[1:30:19] about how many believe that I'm almost
[1:30:21] done bear with me here I'm trying to go
[1:30:23] finish up yeah a few more because this
[1:30:27] is where you will get perfected the
[1:30:29] Bible says by five preaching gifts you
[1:30:31] will get perfected which means God will
[1:30:33] use their preaching to make you the best
[1:30:36] Christian you can be to fulfill all of
[1:30:39] God's Word for your life so you've got
[1:30:42] to come out of false churches and false
[1:30:44] doctrines and you've got to come into a
[1:30:46] church that believes the message of God
[1:30:48] the message of the hour amen
[1:30:52] and this is what we said earlier God
[1:30:56] gave
[1:30:56] space for the Roman Catholic Church to
[1:30:58] repent but she repented not so she gets
[1:31:01] cast into a bed with those that
[1:31:03] committed adultery and they get judged
[1:31:05] but remember the Bible also said that
[1:31:07] this woman has children which are all
[1:31:09] the churches that came after that
[1:31:11] stopped believing the move of the Holy
[1:31:13] Spirit it's not every Church but it's
[1:31:17] the majority of churches who do not let
[1:31:20] the Holy Spirit teach them all of the
[1:31:22] Word of God when they stop and say I
[1:31:24] can't learn anymore I don't want anymore
[1:31:26] of God
[1:31:26] I'm not hungry for money anymore of God
[1:31:28] they de nominate and the Holy Spirit
[1:31:31] leaves the church and God is calling all
[1:31:34] believers come out of those dead
[1:31:35] churches and come into a living Christ
[1:31:37] amen so what was Williams random mission
[1:31:42] let's stand here I'm gonna be done here
[1:31:44] I freeze a lot longer than I thought I
[1:31:45] preached a whole hour I wanted to do 45
[1:31:47] minutes what was William branham's
[1:31:49] mission his mission was this he said not
[1:31:53] for one moment do I bring a message to
[1:31:55] the people that they may follow me or
[1:31:56] join my church like I say I'm not I'm
[1:31:58] not asking you to follow him he would
[1:32:00] follow William Branham or anything like
[1:32:02] that or go to his home church or
[1:32:04] anything like that or start some
[1:32:06] fellowship or organization I've never
[1:32:08] done that and will not do that now I
[1:32:10] have no interest in those things but I
[1:32:12] do have an interest in the things of God
[1:32:14] in people and if I can accomplish just
[1:32:16] one thing I'll be satisfied that one
[1:32:21] thing is to see establish a true
[1:32:23] spiritual relationship between God and
[1:32:25] man wherein men and women be can become
[1:32:29] new creatures in Christ Jesus fill with
[1:32:32] this holy spirit and live according to
[1:32:34] his word I would invite plead and warn
[1:32:38] all to hear his voice at this time and
[1:32:40] yield yourselves completely to him even
[1:32:43] as I trust in my heart that I've given
[1:32:44] him my all to him god bless you and may
[1:32:48] is coming rejoice your heart and that's
[1:32:50] from William Branham in 1965 let's just
[1:32:52] thank the Lord for that phrase God thank
[1:32:54] you lord
[1:32:56] see it's such a balance God is calling
[1:32:58] we saw in the Bible God is calling us
[1:33:00] out of dead churches and we've got to
[1:33:03] have a church somewhere but that's not
[1:33:05] the whole point of it just to join a
[1:33:06] church the whole point is to know Jesus
[1:33:08] Christ and him crucified
[1:33:10] and to let the spirit of Jesus Christ
[1:33:13] flow through you so much that you'll
[1:33:15] fall in love with every word that Jesus
[1:33:17] said and you will be an ambassador for
[1:33:20] Jesus Christ you'll be one telling
[1:33:22] people to come follow Jesus come hear
[1:33:24] the word it will transform your life
[1:33:26] you'll be a real Christian amen let's
[1:33:28] bow our heads here Malachi you come to
[1:33:30] the piano when you're ready sir I really
[1:33:32] appreciate you letting me go a little
[1:33:33] further I didn't mean to go so long I
[1:33:35] hope it was a blessing by the grace of
[1:33:37] God I'm so thankful and if you want to
[1:33:39] share this with anyone you know you can
[1:33:40] do that on your links I'm going to share
[1:33:41] it with some of our family members I've
[1:33:43] been talking with on Facebook there and
[1:33:45] trust that they will have a kind of an
[1:33:47] idea now hopefully they caught the whole
[1:33:49] hopefully the Holy Spirit was working on
[1:33:51] them and they were hearing the Holy
[1:33:53] Spirit by the grace of God I hope they
[1:33:55] heard what the Holy Spirit speaks as
[1:33:58] thus saith the Lord for today amen
[1:34:02] Heavenly Father we love you Lord God we
[1:34:07] thank you for the stay at the Lord I
[1:34:09] tried to summarize in about an hour
[1:34:12] thank you Lord for those who have heard
[1:34:15] it I appreciate their patience nor the
[1:34:18] people being patient with me ultimately
[1:34:21] Lord all's we want is to see us true
[1:34:23] spiritual relationship between God and
[1:34:24] man we are not proselyting we're not
[1:34:28] trying to just get a bigger church or
[1:34:30] get more money god that's the last thing
[1:34:32] on my heart and you're a witness Lord
[1:34:34] you know that I know that but yet Lord
[1:34:39] we know the scripture we've got to call
[1:34:41] people out of foster systems that do not
[1:34:45] believe all the Word of God we've got to
[1:34:49] call people to become perfected by the
[1:34:51] five fold ministry
[1:34:53] [Music]
[1:34:55] so father bless your people guide your
[1:34:59] people I pray for all those here

[1:35:03] would minister to them your word Lord no
