[3:17] so i do have uh slides here uh by the
[3:19] grace of the lord
[3:28] i was just listening that song whom
[3:29] shall i fear but i heard brother randy
[3:31] sing that i was like okay good i was
[3:33] like man i want to sing that so thank
[3:34] you
[3:35] hallelujah that's a beautiful song
[3:37] thank god so let's look to the word of
[3:39] god here today i'm just trusting god to
[3:41] speak to you and
[3:44] it's just it's a just amazing subject
[3:46] the more i study this the more
[3:48] joyful i get about it because i can
[3:49] finally understand it after all these
[3:51] years
[3:51] and i can see the i can see uh how you
[3:54] take everything back to the word of god
[3:57] now just briefly here um you know let me
[3:59] back up from last week i remember last
[4:01] week when i forgot something i was in
[4:02] the middle of a thought you remember
[4:03] that and i just forgot well i went and
[4:05] listened this morning and i remember
[4:06] what i was going to say
[4:08] so forgive me i'm going to go show you
[4:09] what i was going to say
[4:12] i was dealing with this thought about i
[4:14] was just mentioning uh
[4:15] rick warren's purpose-driven life right
[4:18] and then all of a sudden i'm like what
[4:19] was i talking about
[4:21] okay uh sometimes that happens to me
[4:23] so let me find that i want to show that
[4:25] illustration of brazil but i just drew
[4:28] some pictures into it
[4:30] um
[4:31] uh where i didn't have all these notes
[4:34] yeah there it is okay so i was dealing
[4:35] with this last sunday morning i was in
[4:37] the middle of a thought i was just
[4:38] opening the sermon uh
[4:40] and trying to remind everybody about
[4:42] this i remember sister elizabeth was
[4:43] here last week and stephen i remember
[4:45] them and we were talking about this
[4:48] but you and i this is what we've come to
[4:49] we've come not to brazil this is
[4:51] actually a map of brazil but i just
[4:52] found it because the first one i could
[4:53] find that had no uh political lines
[4:55] drawn on it
[4:56] uh and i thought well this is like us in
[4:58] the baptism of the holy ghost right
[5:01] and especially for me as a pastor i
[5:02] can't even pastor until i bring my own
[5:04] home into subjection
[5:07] so i cannot possess the pastor land
[5:09] until i get the victory in my own
[5:11] personal life
[5:13] and we saw that in manasseh remember
[5:14] manasseh said joshua give us more land
[5:16] we're out and josh is like no you go
[5:18] take the land that's got woods on it and
[5:20] they said well we can't take it because
[5:21] of the chariots of iron
[5:23] right and so god
[5:25] uh god used joshua to give them strength
[5:27] and say no you will take it so they were
[5:29] afraid they wanted somebody else's land
[5:31] because they they were afraid to take
[5:33] their own land
[5:34] right and so we found that that's how a
[5:36] lot of new testament christians are they
[5:38] want to go somewhere else or find
[5:39] something else to do rather than take
[5:41] care of the giants in their own life
[5:42] and we're all guilty of it like we all
[5:44] run from our problems right sometimes
[5:46] can everybody say amen on that one
[5:48] i'm not the only one right we we all we
[5:50] all run from our problems at times
[5:52] because they look too big to us
[5:53] but god is faithful and if we'll just
[5:55] take courage from joshua the holy ghost
[5:58] if we listen to the holy ghost then god
[5:59] will give us great victories in our
[6:01] lives
[6:02] amen so i was talking about this last
[6:04] week right and i was going into how rick
[6:07] warren you know the book is excellent
[6:08] other than two thoughts i found two
[6:09] trinitarian thoughts in there that are
[6:11] wrong but other than that it's a great
[6:13] bible study and it's a great teaching
[6:15] and then i after i read that i preached
[6:17] a series on purpose
[6:18] right uh and then i lost track of my
[6:21] thought well what i was going to was in
[6:23] that series on purpose
[6:25] i taught i i went back and preached on a
[6:28] sister in branham tabernacle named mrs
[6:30] ford
[6:31] i don't know if you remember that she's
[6:32] a black sister and she died
[6:35] brother ram did the funeral and brother
[6:37] man was talking about the next sunday
[6:38] after the funeral
[6:39] and brother bam said look mrs ford
[6:42] uh this this elderly black woman she
[6:44] fulfilled all of god's will for her life
[6:48] and he was yeah he had their the uh
[6:51] the the widow the husband and the
[6:53] children sitting right there up front
[6:54] and brother bam says
[6:56] mr ford and boys he said could you have
[6:59] asked for a better mother than mrs ford
[7:01] and you can hear him say no
[7:04] could you have asked for a better wife
[7:05] mr ford than mrs ford
[7:07] no
[7:09] and so that tells you she possessed
[7:11] the land and her relationships
[7:14] the kids and dad couldn't ask for a
[7:15] better mom than that
[7:17] and then brother ram said do you
[7:18] remember how she all used to always come
[7:20] up here and testify and praise the lord
[7:22] and remember how she used to sing song
[7:23] specials
[7:25] he said she was such a blessing to us
[7:28] and so we can see that she possessed her
[7:30] location right she stayed in her place
[7:32] she's a housewife she possessed there
[7:35] she was in jeffersonville
[7:37] and the gifts of ministries now we know
[7:38] we're not given all the details on that
[7:40] but that woman was a blessing in the
[7:42] house of god and brother oh yeah i said
[7:43] she'd always shot a good healthy amen
[7:48] so she had some zeal about her you know
[7:51] maybe god called her to be a little more
[7:52] verbal than other women which is okay
[7:54] some men aren't verbal either like that
[7:56] you know god has a variety of people
[7:59] but that's the thought i was going to
[8:00] get to
[8:02] that here's a woman elderly black woman
[8:04] she dies and brother ram can come
[8:05] afterwards and say now look she did all
[8:08] the will of god for her life
[8:10] he said just a humble housewife like mrs
[8:13] ford amen
[8:15] now look what if she would have been
[8:16] married twice
[8:18] what has she been married three times
[8:20] what if she would have abused her
[8:21] children
[8:23] but she didn't church she was faithful
[8:25] she possessed all the gates of the
[8:27] enemies amen
[8:29] hallelujah praise god and then i went
[8:31] into this thought now that's what i
[8:32] forgot okay but here's another thought i
[8:34] want to finish from last sunday too i
[8:36] talked about billy graham billy graham
[8:38] never led people to this land
[8:42] billy graham led him out of egypt but
[8:44] then he stopped right there can you
[8:45] imagine this he crossed through he
[8:47] crossed through the red sea billy graham
[8:49] did with his people
[8:50] and let the waters come down he said and
[8:52] then he told him praise god you're in
[8:54] the promised land
[8:56] right
[8:57] because i've seen billy graham's book i
[8:58] saw it on google right he says once
[9:00] you're born again i'm sorry once you
[9:02] confess and repent you're completely
[9:03] born again and baptized with the holy
[9:05] ghost that's nonsense
[9:08] and church as proof of that
[9:11] i looked it up this morning as proof of
[9:12] that
[9:14] numerous daughters of brother branham
[9:16] have been divorced and married other
[9:18] ones
[9:19] see they never possess the gates
[9:22] of their marriages
[9:26] what did i say
[9:28] i'm sorry did i say brother brandon or
[9:29] i'm sorry i meant billy graham thank you
[9:32] see that's my correction can we let's
[9:33] give her uh no let's say praise the lord
[9:35] amen praise the lord i didn't mean to
[9:37] say that see that's just a slip of the
[9:38] tongue just like brother ram said uh uh
[9:40] rebecca went to marry her bride brother
[9:43] baby said that like five times
[9:45] and she didn't go to marry a bride bride
[9:47] groom it's just a slip of the tongue
[9:49] so forgive me brother billy graham
[9:52] brother billy graham
[9:53] his daughters many of them are enough
[9:56] men a couple of them have been divorced
[9:57] one of them has been divorced three
[9:59] times and is now in the fourth marriage
[10:02] and billy graham supported it
[10:07] that proves he wasn't a prophet of god
[10:10] right
[10:11] he just had a gift evangelize brother
[10:13] man said nobody can preach salvation
[10:14] like billy graham that's true go listen
[10:15] to his services you can listen to them
[10:17] they're they're they're tremendous
[10:19] he has such zeal and force for salvation
[10:22] but he just he got him past the red sea
[10:24] and the waters come down
[10:26] and they say okay now you're in the land
[10:27] in church they're just wandering around
[10:29] they're wondering from this marriage to
[10:31] that marriage now what about some of his
[10:33] sons well i read a little bit about that
[10:34] but one of his sons is a preacher and
[10:36] supports women preachers
[10:39] that's not that's not very good
[10:41] that's not that's not really because
[10:43] those women that preach they're not even
[10:45] possessed in the land of their gifts and
[10:46] ministries
[10:47] they're actually encroaching into
[10:49] somebody else's territory
[10:51] a surfing authority
[10:53] right and then brother billy graham it's
[10:55] on record billy graham said his
[10:56] daughter's a preacher
[10:58] and he said his daughter is the best
[11:00] preacher in the family now can you
[11:02] imagine that
[11:05] she's a doctorate
[11:08] and he said look he's a preacher he says
[11:10] the best preacher in the family is my
[11:11] daughter
[11:12] now church can everybody see that billy
[11:14] graham never can take you to the
[11:16] promised land
[11:17] because all those all those things they
[11:19] do go against the word of god
[11:21] right and you wouldn't get to them
[11:22] joshua only got to the promised land for
[11:24] the amen by obeying every word
[11:27] amen
[11:28] hallelujah we only get to the promised
[11:30] land by obeying all the word of god
[11:33] amen there it is how did he
[11:36] that's what i forgot last week church so
[11:38] just bear with me here as we get started
[11:40] here was that helpful
[11:41] okay i hope it was helpful by god's
[11:42] grace i only had to scroll down to slide
[11:44] 196. okay i had to scroll down 196
[11:47] slides to get to that thought so i'm
[11:49] sorry i forgot that last week i don't
[11:50] want to fail you you know i i don't like
[11:52] forgetting things
[11:54] just a small thing now let's review
[11:56] quickly uh last week uh last sunday i
[11:58] preached on uh
[12:02] i think i preached on all four of these
[12:03] yeah i preached on all four of those
[12:04] last sunday the wednesday before i
[12:06] preached on reuben
[12:07] so if you haven't listened those i think
[12:09] it'd be a blessing to you but let's just
[12:10] review this real quick
[12:12] uh reuben was the oldest but he was
[12:14] disgraced
[12:16] and really had no blessings promised to
[12:19] him
[12:19] through his his father and then moses to
[12:22] the tribe that later you know his
[12:24] descendants okay let's read this i want
[12:26] you to read this because i was just
[12:27] blessed so if you forgot your bible go
[12:29] to first chronicles 5.
[12:32] the bible literally says that god took
[12:34] away his place as the firstborn because
[12:37] of his sin
[12:38] was sleeping with his dad's servant
[12:41] you see church there's something's going
[12:43] to happen the bible says remember the
[12:44] bible says when a man sleeps with a
[12:46] harlot or something they're one flesh
[12:48] there's something that happens when
[12:50] someone actually goes through that act
[12:52] and it's going to last right uh brother
[12:54] madam say you'll never get away from the
[12:56] the consequences of that you can be
[12:58] forgiven of that but you'll never get
[13:00] away from the consequences of that
[13:02] praise god
[13:04] and so this case reuben did an awful
[13:06] thing it's almost like incest some of
[13:08] the writers say
[13:09] uh and he just because of that you know
[13:12] he was forgiven later we know he has a
[13:14] throne he was forgiven of that uh like
[13:16] david was forgiven of adultery and
[13:17] murder right
[13:18] god can still give you rewards right you
[13:21] can still be forgiven but there's going
[13:23] to be effects on that for all the days
[13:25] of your life but aren't you glad those
[13:27] who obey there's going to be blessings
[13:29] that remain on you all the days of your
[13:31] life too praise god
[13:33] for those who remain faithful those who
[13:34] keep the word of god god's blessings are
[13:37] going to overtake you amen that's what
[13:39] that's what moses said they're going to
[13:41] run after you and chase you down amen
[13:44] i'm ready for some more chasing downs
[13:46] somebody lord i know he's going to chase
[13:48] me down and bless me amen because we've
[13:50] tried to line up our lives with the word
[13:52] of god
[13:54] amen
[13:58] first chronicles five one and two now
[14:00] the sons of reuben the firstborn of
[14:02] israel for he was the firstborn but for
[14:04] as much as he defiled his father's bed
[14:08] his birthright was given unto the sons
[14:11] of joseph now look at that
[14:12] even uh
[14:13] esau right esau gave up his birthright
[14:16] and that was voluntarily well here he
[14:18] the this reuben gives it up through
[14:20] sexual sin
[14:24] so see how church we can lose rewards
[14:26] that's how people can they can have a
[14:28] promise they can have blessings of god
[14:30] but if they for if they live despite the
[14:32] word of god god will take things away
[14:35] right
[14:37] his birthright was given to the sons of
[14:38] joseph the son of israel and the
[14:40] genealogy is not to be reckoned after
[14:43] the birthright
[14:44] look at that
[14:46] god takes it away look at verse 2 for
[14:49] judah prevailed above his brethren amen
[14:52] god was looking at their lives and said
[14:54] i can see that judah is going to
[14:56] overcome the sexual temptation can i say
[14:58] like that judah is going to overcome the
[14:59] violent spirit that simeon and levi had
[15:02] amen judah was going to prevail he was
[15:05] going to overcome because like joshua
[15:07] said choose you this day it's all up to
[15:09] your choice do whatever you want but god
[15:11] will honor those who submit to the holy
[15:13] spirit
[15:15] ah
[15:16] there it is
[15:17] prevail god's not forcing us to do
[15:20] anything god wants to see what you're
[15:22] gonna do with your free more agency
[15:27] rich and deep amen
[15:30] judah prevailed above his brother and of
[15:32] him became the chief ruler but the
[15:34] birthright was joseph's
[15:36] so joseph got the birthright but then
[15:38] judah prevails above them and judah gets
[15:41] the scepter the bible says
[15:43] to rule over them
[15:46] right so now can anybody see that okay
[15:48] reuben was a
[15:50] awful sin but god for game at the end of
[15:51] his life but his god foresaw that his
[15:54] tribe was not going to do very much
[15:55] after that
[15:56] remember no king no prophet ever came
[15:59] out of reuben
[16:00] all right they all had the opportunity
[16:02] to do it but uh no they never came out
[16:04] of it because of their choices they
[16:06] made all right now last sunday we looked
[16:09] at simeon and levi these two were the
[16:12] ones that
[16:13] slayed those men of sheikham right when
[16:15] they were circumcised and they were
[16:17] healing up they did awful and jacob was
[16:19] so mad at them
[16:21] but simeon
[16:22] was disgraced into significance we never
[16:24] find him doing anything either
[16:26] but levi was redeemed and exalted to the
[16:30] priesthood
[16:31] levi took the warning and then his
[16:33] descendants like aaron and moses and
[16:35] phineas they
[16:37] moses said who's on the lord's side and
[16:39] all the sons of levi came and stood with
[16:41] them just according to the prophecy
[16:44] because moses said moses said you'll
[16:46] give me the lawgiver of your people and
[16:48] you will hold the yerman thummim praise
[16:50] god
[16:51] amen and that this gives us the the
[16:54] grace we can have two brothers right
[16:55] that are that together they're not very
[16:58] good but if you get them apart they'll
[16:59] serve god amen then you can have
[17:01] brothers that serve god like james and
[17:03] andrew
[17:04] right and james and john i know you're
[17:06] peter and andrew rather you can have
[17:08] brothers that work together like johnny
[17:09] and his brother amen like myself and my
[17:11] brothers amen
[17:13] right god can put us together and we can
[17:15] do something for the glory of god amen
[17:19] hallelujah but these two needed
[17:21] separated so god did it
[17:24] now we also saw judah
[17:27] he was exalted to the lead with the
[17:29] scepter through david
[17:31] and ultimately
[17:32] he was given david and all the good
[17:35] kings and messiah
[17:38] jesus christ came through the line of
[17:40] the tribe of jude and the church said
[17:42] amen the lion of the tribe of who judah
[17:46] because judah was one who prevailed
[17:48] wasn't it jesus that said i prevailed
[17:50] for you amen i've gone to the cross i
[17:52] prevailed the guard in gethsemane i did
[17:54] that for you amen and because i lived
[18:00] you can prevail also
[18:02] oh
[18:03] hallelujah thank god amen
[18:07] beautiful
[18:08] now we looked at dan
[18:10] on sunday night
[18:13] and the holy spirit prophesied that he
[18:16] would rule this people and that was only
[18:18] the time of samson
[18:20] which was 20 years imagine that the holy
[18:22] spirit looked at dan's he looked at
[18:23] dan's genealogy and he said well for 20
[18:25] years he's going to rule so i'm going to
[18:26] just point that out to the people
[18:28] but then remember in the days of
[18:30] jeroboam
[18:32] dan let jeroboam set up a calf in israel
[18:35] on their land and the bible said after
[18:37] that that god took their name off the
[18:39] book
[18:40] right
[18:41] dan and ephraim he said they're they're
[18:43] giving unto idols leave them alone
[18:46] and then god blocks their names out from
[18:47] under heaven
[18:49] right that was a thousand years before
[18:50] christ
[18:52] okay
[18:53] so and then there's not much said about
[18:55] dan after that
[18:56] he had a lot of good land we looked at
[18:57] that you have nice land and everything
[19:00] uh not much said now here actually let
[19:02] me pull this up here let me see if i can
[19:04] uh i'm on slide what 11.
[19:06] i want to this is another thing i
[19:08] couldn't remember last week too so i'm
[19:10] kind of making up for last or lost
[19:11] ground from last week okay
[19:13] remember i was trying to think of all
[19:14] the kings of judah who were all the good
[19:16] kings of judah whether they're the ones
[19:18] that are shaded in here asa
[19:20] remember the northern kings had no good
[19:22] kings
[19:24] no good kings ever came out of that
[19:26] lineage jeroboams right
[19:29] because you got ahab they got ahab now
[19:32] they say jehu was kind of good kind of
[19:33] bad
[19:34] and he was it was a mixture i guess but
[19:36] not overall a good king but here the
[19:38] bible said asa was a good king
[19:39] jehoshaphat
[19:40] uh
[19:41] and then some kind of in between i think
[19:43] uzi was really good he just got off
[19:45] right at the end of his life just
[19:46] remember that he got leprosy he just got
[19:48] off right at the very end he stopped
[19:50] seeking god but he had a tremendous
[19:52] testimony if you read the scripture he
[19:53] was such a warrior so faithful to god
[19:56] that was such a sad thing
[19:58] uh but hezekiah and josiah were these
[20:01] wonderful kings that god raised up yeah
[20:03] jehoshaphat ii there so at least judah
[20:06] had some good kings praise god just like
[20:09] god said i'm gonna give you the scepter
[20:11] and there was godly kingdom now look at
[20:12] that church we're gonna get to this
[20:13] later but each generation had a chance
[20:16] to obey god
[20:18] each glory each generation had a chance
[20:20] at revival amen and we've got the chance
[20:23] right now amen
[20:25] we've got a chance to be revived in the
[20:27] holy spirit praise god i'm talking about
[20:29] not just the soul i'm talking about your
[20:31] mind too
[20:33] i i thank god that we never lukewarm in
[20:35] our souls but sometimes we get lukewarm
[20:37] in our minds amen
[20:39] that's where we need the victory praise
[20:40] god
[20:41] right if you're born again hallelujah
[20:43] but don't give up your mind we'll look
[20:45] at the mind tonight for the kids bible
[20:46] study we're gonna do a bible study on
[20:48] the five inlets to the human spirit
[20:50] so i was studying on that this morning
[20:51] so lord willing if the children want to
[20:53] we can if we can do one or i can just
[20:55] preach it whatever the children want but
[20:56] my guess is they might want to do bible
[20:57] study but i could be wrong
[21:00] so look that's what the bible says judah
[21:02] would have good kings that came out of
[21:04] out of him and that's exactly what
[21:06] happened praise god not everyone in fact
[21:08] only a minority now plus you had you
[21:11] know david and solomon was partly good
[21:13] david was mostly good
[21:16] but then solomon you know started off
[21:17] good but then kind of fell off at the
[21:18] end
[21:20] so partly good partly bad
[21:22] all right now back up here
[21:24] that wasn't too bad
[21:26] now just to review church
[21:28] here's how they were camped i love this
[21:29] picture man this is this just makes me
[21:31] want to shout i'm going to do right now
[21:33] hallelujah praise god this is what the
[21:35] holy spirit show balaam
[21:38] remember balak said come curse me he
[21:40] said nah he said come come up okay so he
[21:42] finally went remember the donkey tried
[21:43] to stop him he he went past that
[21:46] and balak said come look at them he said
[21:48] come look at them and curse them and the
[21:50] bible says the holy spirit came upon
[21:52] balaam
[21:53] and he said how goodly are your tents o
[21:55] jacob praise god for there shall rise a
[21:58] star out of jacob amen this is what he
[22:01] saw he saw the cross amen
[22:04] hallelujah
[22:05] he saw the pillar of fire
[22:08] right in the midst of the camp and
[22:09] that's what we got today healing our
[22:11] sick for the jose we got the pillar of
[22:13] fire in the camp today amen it's at the
[22:16] very heart of our worship what does all
[22:18] of our worship go back to the holy
[22:20] spirit the word of god the leadership of
[22:22] the holy ghost it's right in the midst

[22:31] the east side you've got benjamin
[22:33] manasseh ephraim on the west you got gad
[22:35] simeon ruben on the south got dan asher
[22:38] naphtali on the north and don't don't
[22:40] forget church each of them had a banner
[22:42] that they flew
[22:44] they all had their uh they all had their
[22:47] chair of them guarding them
[22:49] amen
[22:50] hallelujah they had the they had the
[22:52] lion
[22:53] the ox the man and the ego praise god
[22:58] why they were all guarding the presence
[23:01] of god matthew mark luke and john all
[23:04] guarding the book of acts amen

[23:09] the apostles in other words the acts of
[23:11] the holy ghost in you and i
[23:14] hallelujah thank god amen hallelujah
[23:18] that's where we stand today
[23:20] with the anointing of the holy ghost
[23:22] here today
[23:23] to bless us to help us instruct us god
[23:26] say like this to keep us in order
[23:28] and he's going to make sure we fulfill
[23:31] all the positions that god has called us
[23:33] to
[23:34] do thank god amen
[23:38] now let's look at god for a few minutes
[23:41] i'm really going to try to watch my time
[23:42] now i say that but i'm really going to
[23:44] try today
[23:45] all right
[23:46] i've probably been preaching what maybe
[23:47] 15 minutes so we'll see how this goes
[23:50] god
[23:52] now again let's get your bible let's go
[23:53] to the scripture here now genesis 30
[23:55] let's look at his life
[23:57] i'm sorry his birth rather yeah the
[23:59] beginning of his life
[24:01] now remember this is what we're trying
[24:02] to show we're trying to show how we have
[24:04] to rightly divide brother ram's message
[24:07] right
[24:08] a lot of people will get quiet on that
[24:10] which is i understand that we want to be
[24:11] respectful to brother branham but
[24:12] brother adam said prove me by the word
[24:15] right he said try all things he said
[24:17] take everything back to the bible
[24:21] so there's quotes for brother man says
[24:23] every hebrew mother prophesied and
[24:25] foretold where the boys would end up in
[24:27] the promised land well we can't find
[24:29] that in the bible
[24:30] it may have happened but we can't find
[24:32] the bible but we do find the mothers
[24:35] giving them names based upon the trials
[24:37] they were going through
[24:40] it wasn't about it was actually their
[24:42] their father jacob and then the prophet
[24:44] moses that actually placed them in the
[24:46] promised land in certain cases not every
[24:49] case
[24:50] okay so we don't want any william random
[24:52] worshipers here we only want jesus
[24:54] christ worshipers here
[24:55] praise god
[24:57] and i say that with all due respect like
[24:59] i had a guy was i was texting with
[25:01] yesterday he watched my joseph video
[25:03] didn't like it very much i said well
[25:04] that's fine he said he went to joseph
[25:06] years ago when he had the hair down to
[25:07] his his shoulder
[25:09] and his son had cancer and he said that
[25:12] he just fellowship with him for two
[25:13] hours
[25:14] they didn't even pray for the boy
[25:17] and he went back to uh the doctor with
[25:19] the boy and the boy was healed
[25:21] he said he must be a prophet i said
[25:23] that's i said that's fine i'm i said i'm
[25:25] glad he was healed but he didn't even
[25:27] pray for him
[25:28] he didn't anoint him with oil or nothing
[25:30] and he didn't even his hair should have
[25:31] been that long either
[25:33] and i said and so the man said that's
[25:35] why i call joseph our christ he calls
[25:38] him christ joseph
[25:39] that's that's almost blasphemy if not it
[25:42] is
[25:43] they said they say uh joseph our christ
[25:45] they call him that's what this guy calls
[25:46] him it's so so sad i said your reasoning
[25:50] is about as uh uh
[25:52] about as weak as anything i've ever
[25:53] heard
[25:54] because my mom was here to cancer
[25:58] and the woman i just called her angie i
[25:59] don't remember her name but the woman
[26:01] angie came with thus said the lord to my
[26:03] mom and she was healed of cancer well i
[26:04] said should my mom call angie christ
[26:06] angie
[26:08] no
[26:10] of course not if jesus said call no man
[26:13] father
[26:15] how much more should we call no man
[26:16] christ
[26:20] i said all when there's a miracle all
[26:22] that proves is the holy ghost honor of
[26:23] that one prayer that doesn't prove that
[26:25] person's life is sealed in the baptism
[26:27] of the holy ghost
[26:29] right
[26:30] and i said here's 11 more false
[26:32] doctrines that church is producing prove
[26:34] one of them wrong and he proved zero
[26:35] wrong because he wrote right back he
[26:37] said oh you just don't understand i said
[26:39] no i understand exactly what
[26:41] there's a whole video about it i
[26:42] understand
[26:43] i understand see how that spirit gets in
[26:45] there and it exalts men ah but there's
[26:48] there's people that are earnestly
[26:50] contending for the faith once delivered
[26:52] to the saints amen
[26:54] thank you brother bran the same honor
[26:56] that was given to john the baptist amen
[26:58] and john the baptist given that honor he
[27:01] pointed them to christ and he said look
[27:02] away from me look to jesus the lamb of
[27:05] god who takes away the sin of the world
[27:07] amen
[27:09] so any honor we good we would give to
[27:10] brother abraham or john the baptist they
[27:12] would always say go follow him he's the
[27:14] one that baptizes you with the holy
[27:16] ghost
[27:17] hallelujah
[27:20] oh my goodness these people
[27:23] church aren't you glad to have a sound
[27:24] mind today
[27:25] aren't you glad you woke up today with a
[27:27] sound mind
[27:28] that you don't wake up with a uh i doubt
[27:30] your spirit like that on you
[27:32] see sometimes we forget to count our
[27:33] benefits i've got healthy body i got
[27:36] food on the table
[27:37] i'm not insane
[27:40] i don't have a reprobate mind that's
[27:42] what these guys have
[27:44] and they won't receive correction you
[27:46] can't correct them on anything because
[27:48] they know everything about it right
[27:50] there's no humility they can't humble
[27:52] themselves to the word of god
[27:54] oh but god has given us a spirit of of
[27:56] love power and a soulmate
[27:59] that's a gift of grace hallelujah that's
[28:02] grace to us amen
[28:04] and we can recognize that we're wrong
[28:06] and the holy spirit can guide us into
[28:07] all truth i feel good this morning
[28:09] praise god amen all right now
[28:12] genesis 30 verse 9 through 11.
[28:17] verse nine when leah saw that she had
[28:18] left bearing she took zilpah her maid
[28:20] and gave her jacob to wife and zilpah
[28:23] leah's made bear jacob a son and leah
[28:25] said a troop cometh and she called his
[28:28] name gad
[28:31] gad now it seems from the text that she
[28:33] says she means a troop of boys
[28:37] but this one this one is actually
[28:38] prophetic this one was really prophetic
[28:40] because that's what this is later what
[28:42] moses says
[28:43] moses later brings us out how he's going
[28:46] to be a troop in other words they're
[28:47] going to be warriors
[28:49] they're going to be military men
[28:52] the mob just meant it for well
[28:54] now i got a troop of boys
[28:57] but god by the holy spirit inspired her
[28:59] to say that amen
[29:01] now no she didn't place him in the land
[29:03] she just placed what they would be
[29:05] warriors
[29:06] there'd be an army that's what we are
[29:08] church we're the army of the lord today
[29:09] amen
[29:11] you're true praise god we're troops in
[29:13] here today we're getting spiritually fed
[29:15] amen what do they call that in the
[29:16] military when you get fed what's they
[29:18] call the reverie what do they call it
[29:19] mess yeah this mess hall praise god
[29:22] this is the message hall can i say like
[29:23] that praise god amen we're getting the
[29:26] message fed to us amen the word of god
[29:29] for our day hallelujah
[29:31] now that's it for the prophecy right
[29:35] gad right now asher's next his name is
[29:38] means happy that's a great name
[29:41] okay go to
[29:42] uh genesis 49 19 please
[29:48] genesis 49 19. yeah here's dad
[29:51] prophesying over gad jacob's dying
[29:55] and he goes through all the boys here
[29:56] and he prophesies about god look what he
[29:58] said just one sentence about him imagine
[30:00] that your dad what would your dad what
[30:02] would the holy spirit prophesy over you
[30:03] if they had one sentence what is your
[30:04] life going to be most identified by oh
[30:06] my may god granted that be something
[30:09] great to glorify christ a life of
[30:11] obedience praise god a life of of
[30:14] magnifying jesus a life of obedience a
[30:16] life of a power in the holy spirit
[30:19] amen
[30:20] verse 19. one sentence this man utters
[30:23] by the holy spirit verse 19 dad a troop
[30:27] shall overcome him but he shall overcome
[30:30] at the last
[30:33] wow he picks up the same inspiration as
[30:36] right as earlier right
[30:38] picks up the same inspiration from mama
[30:42] you're going to get defeated early but
[30:44] don't quit
[30:45] don't quit early because you're going to
[30:47] win at the end amen
[30:49] you might get defeated early on but just
[30:52] don't give up church amen
[30:54] just don't quit on god hallelujah just
[30:56] keep fighting and you know your troop
[30:58] you know your army you might be defeated
[31:01] you might have had some law of losses
[31:02] you might have suffered a little bit but
[31:04] stay in the fight victory's assured
[31:06] hallelujah
[31:08] amen
[31:09] god is going to help this truth amen god
[31:12] is going to help this army god is going
[31:14] to protect his bride amen
[31:17] hallelujah
[31:20] it ain't over until god says it's over
[31:23] can i say like that praise god
[31:25] this fight is not over until god says
[31:28] it's over
[31:29] as long as i'm here it's not over
[31:33] as long as you're here it's not over
[31:35] keep fighting you're our troop you're an
[31:38] army god is with you his angels are with
[31:40] you amen hallelujah
[31:43] an angel army goes before you
[31:47] hallelujah maybe some of those losses
[31:49] are just to humble us
[31:51] maybe god knows you just need a little
[31:52] suffering to produce
[31:54] obedience
[31:56] right because all messenger believers
[31:57] don't obey the word of god right
[32:00] and we when we're and we're going to
[32:02] fall ashore but how many want to
[32:04] overcome and they want to obey in the
[32:05] end
[32:07] i do
[32:09] right we're all going to fall short
[32:10] we're going to make mistakes but in the
[32:12] end i want to overcome by the grace of
[32:14] god
[32:15] amen i don't want to fail to the devil i
[32:17] don't want to be beaten i want to stand
[32:19] upon the heads of my enemies
[32:23] like the bible said we want to put satan
[32:25] under our feet shortly
[32:28] thank god amen
[32:31] now brother adam said his name meant
[32:33] cattle raiser
[32:34] now you can
[32:35] you can believe that if you want but i
[32:37] just can't point you to any bible verse
[32:39] for that
[32:40] so that one's going to be on the shelf
[32:41] until eternity okay until we get the
[32:44] answer because maybe they did utter that
[32:46] but we just weren't there
[32:48] okay i think here's where it says it
[32:50] here let me yeah so brother i have said
[32:52] uh as it was with moses great message
[32:53] obviously preach on that for a long time
[32:56] but man says see now look he's guessing
[32:57] right he's just doing his best to
[32:59] remember i don't have it all wrote down
[33:00] here but let's say let's say reuben
[33:02] meant sheepherder and gad means cattle
[33:05] razor
[33:06] and ephra meant cornraiser
[33:08] okay so he's just doing his best to kind
[33:10] of you know just to kind of understand
[33:12] how they were they were placed by their
[33:14] names they replaced by prophecy is what
[33:16] he was trying to get to right that's the
[33:18] beautiful thought we can see in it
[33:19] praise god
[33:21] now there's god just i mean we'll get to
[33:22] this in a moment but there's again
[33:24] notice here's the jordan river right did
[33:26] they did they get into the promised land
[33:28] no
[33:29] they chose to live outside the promised
[33:31] land which types the foolish virgin
[33:34] right yet but they fought and they
[33:36] helped their brethren
[33:37] right and brother bam said that foolish
[33:38] virgin should be a help to the bride
[33:42] praise god that's just these are
[33:43] beautiful types we see in here we need
[33:44] to understand them
[33:46] right
[33:48] so we already preached on reuben he
[33:49] remained there
[33:51] gad here was north of ruben
[33:54] and then on this side west manasseh and
[33:56] then east minnesota so he's all
[33:57] surrounded by manasseh
[33:59] except on the south they had ruben there
[34:01] so just interesting to see there now
[34:03] yeah we preached on naftali like i said
[34:06] that was prophetic wednesday that was
[34:07] prophetic of jesus and his apostles
[34:09] almost every apostle came out of naftali
[34:13] and that's what the bible said they
[34:14] would have goodly words come out of the
[34:15] tribe of naphtali just i mean just
[34:18] amazing i never i never saw that okay
[34:20] deuteronomy 33 we read this yeah let's
[34:22] go back there
[34:23] deuteronomy 33 we'll get back to this by
[34:25] the grace of god
[34:28] 33 verse 20 and of god he said blessed
[34:31] be he that enlargeth god he dwelleth as
[34:33] a lion and teareth the arm with the
[34:36] crown of the head
[34:38] teareth the arm with the crown of his
[34:40] head
[34:42] verse 21 he provided the first part for
[34:44] himself because there in a portion of
[34:46] the giver was he seated and he came with
[34:49] the heads of the people he executed the
[34:50] justice of the lord and his judgments
[34:53] with israel
[34:55] praise god now let me just do something
[34:56] real quick i need to look for a date
[34:57] here real quick in the bible shall we
[34:59] take me a few seconds i'm going to
[35:01] first king 17 and you'll see why i'm
[35:02] going there just a minute okay
[35:04] so this is uh
[35:06] 600 years there about 550 years later
[35:08] okay
[35:10] all right
[35:11] now the results we'll get to now but
[35:13] notice it mentions god was seated in a
[35:16] portion of the lawgiver this means
[35:19] he was given his placing by moses
[35:21] because moses was the lawgiver
[35:23] right remember moses remember moses was
[35:26] the one who promised the two and a half
[35:27] tribes the land remember moses did that
[35:29] and josh would just follow through and
[35:30] make sure we keep what moses said
[35:33] right that's what we're here we're just
[35:34] keeping what brother man told us to do
[35:36] praise god stay with the word
[35:39] hallelujah praise god we're doing what
[35:41] the prophet said amen
[35:44] now there's a quote brother brandon he
[35:45] said a man cattle razor i can't find
[35:47] that i think the bible says it says
[35:49] troop right so that's okay that's
[35:51] brother i'm doing his best he's human
[35:54] now
[35:55] easton's bible dictionary says the
[35:57] portion allowed to the tribe of god was
[35:58] on the east of jordan and comprehended
[36:01] the half of gilead
[36:03] a region of great beauty and fertility
[36:05] bounded on the east by the arabian
[36:07] desert and on the west by the jordan and
[36:10] on the north by the river jabuk it thus
[36:12] included the whole of the jordan valley
[36:14] as far north as to the sea of galilee
[36:16] where it narrowed almost to a point
[36:19] the tribe was fierce and warlike
[36:22] they were strong men of might men of war
[36:25] for the battle that could handle shield
[36:28] and buckler
[36:29] their faces the faces of lions
[36:33] now isn't that interesting
[36:35] and like rose upon the mountains for
[36:38] swiftness so these guys were expert
[36:41] warriors
[36:43] you wouldn't want to come across them in
[36:44] a fight
[36:46] right because they're fast as a deer
[36:49] how many seen a deer lately run out in
[36:51] front of you right
[36:52] i see him all the time
[36:54] uh or as fierce as the face of a lion
[36:58] that's what kind of family this was
[37:00] going to be you ever seen a family of a
[37:01] lion
[37:02] uh around the message some of them
[37:04] fierce
[37:06] yeah you do see it that's what the bible
[37:08] says there's all these different
[37:09] varieties now look at this
[37:11] the bible said berzele
[37:14] and elijah
[37:15] was of this tribe
[37:19] elijah
[37:21] was of gad
[37:22] huh
[37:24] we'll get to that a little bit it was
[37:26] carried into captivity at the same time
[37:27] as the other tribes of northern kingdom
[37:29] by tigleth
[37:32] plesser and the time of jeremiah their
[37:34] cities were inhabited by the ammonites
[37:40] so now i'm going to matthew henry a
[37:42] preacher in the 1900 1800s and here's
[37:44] what he says on jacob's prophecy
[37:47] he alludes to his name signifying a
[37:50] troop it foresees the character of the
[37:52] tribe it should be warlike and so we
[37:54] find that
[37:56] the gadites were men of war
[37:58] fit for the battle
[38:00] he foresaw the situation that the tribe
[38:02] on the other side of jordan would expose
[38:04] it to in the incus incursions of the
[38:07] neighbors the moabites and the ammonites
[38:09] in other words uh gad would battle the
[38:11] ammonites and the moabites right that's
[38:14] where their main arch enemies would be
[38:17] and that they might not be proud of
[38:19] their strength and valor he foretells
[38:21] the troops of their enemies should in
[38:23] many skirmishes overcome them aren't you
[38:26] glad god is so gracious
[38:28] god is so gracious he says you're going
[38:29] to be strong and mighty but you're going
[38:31] to lose a lot at the beginning but just
[38:33] hold on to the end
[38:35] see i like that don't you believe that
[38:37] god will foretell us if we're going to
[38:39] have a loss in the future don't you
[38:40] believe god always warns men and women
[38:43] do you believe that
[38:44] i believe that i think the holy spirit
[38:46] warns them
[38:47] all throughout the day
[38:49] right he warns us and we should pay
[38:52] attention to the warnings
[38:54] right
[38:57] jesus even warned judas right
[39:00] he said one of you is going to betray me
[39:02] in here right he warned him in advance
[39:04] right because he knew what's going to
[39:05] happen he said woe to that man
[39:07] who betrays me
[39:08] it'd be better if he never would have
[39:09] been born
[39:10] he got warned
[39:12] right
[39:13] and if if we're just kind of saying like
[39:14] this if we're just quiet enough we'll
[39:16] sense the warning of the holy spirit
[39:21] so they're warned they're told you're
[39:22] going to be great mighty
[39:24] you're going to lose some
[39:26] but hang on to the end if you don't quit
[39:29] you will overcome at the end
[39:31] praise god
[39:33] glory
[39:35] so see god allows us to lose to humble
[39:38] us
[39:39] right
[39:43] yet that they might not be discouraged
[39:45] by their defeats he assures him that
[39:47] they would overcome at the last
[39:50] which was fulfilled in saul's time and
[39:53] david's the moabites and ammonites were
[39:56] wholly subdued so let's read that let's
[39:58] go to first chronicles 5. we were there
[39:59] earlier but let's read it
[40:02] first chronicles 5.
[40:05] this reminds me of the
[40:07] third tier in church age where jesus
[40:08] said he said i see your works your labor
[40:10] your love he said and your works your
[40:13] last to be more than the first
[40:16] see
[40:17] god wants us not to be discouraged in
[40:19] our service but actually increase our
[40:21] service
[40:23] thank god
[40:24] hallelujah
[40:26] first chronicles five
[40:28] why do i do that why do i pound that
[40:30] because i know people who've decreased
[40:31] their service to god they get cold on
[40:33] god they give up on god but god says
[40:36] keep going keep it at full steam go full
[40:39] blast to the end praise god amen
[40:41] and i'll see that your last works were
[40:43] more than your first amen amen
[40:46] other than brother ram said like this he
[40:48] said he said people are telling me i
[40:49] should i should make less tapes because
[40:52] i i need to repent of my lord jesus
[40:54] christ baptism but man said no he said
[40:56] i'm not doing that we're making more
[40:58] tapes is what he said
[41:01] praise god the devil's trying to say
[41:02] slow down slow down don't put out so
[41:05] much word and revelation but the holy
[41:07] spirit said no we're doing more of it
[41:08] amen we're going to get more truth out
[41:11] and god's people are going to receive
[41:13] the word of god
[41:18] so prophetically
[41:21] this is about 400 years later was when
[41:25] moses's promise promises and prophecies
[41:27] were fulfilled in verses 18 to 22.
[41:31] the sons of reuben and the ghadites and
[41:33] the half tribe of manasseh of valiant
[41:36] men men able to bear buckler a shield
[41:38] and sword and to shoot with the bow and
[41:40] skillful in war were four and forty
[41:44] thousand and seven hundred and three
[41:46] score
[41:48] man i have to break that down a little
[41:49] bit i couldn't get the exact number on
[41:51] that that went out to war
[41:53] and they made war with the hagarites
[41:55] with jeter and and nefesh and no dab and
[41:59] they were helped against them and the
[42:00] hagrites were delivered in their hand
[42:02] and all that were with him
[42:04] with them rather for they cry now look
[42:06] at this church
[42:07] how do you get the victory church
[42:10] what do you do you cry into the lord
[42:13] i think jose's the sister that mary i
[42:15] think she was here did you say she
[42:17] prayed part of the night or something
[42:18] like that yeah so the woman with that
[42:20] blood the blood in her eye
[42:23] she stayed up extra night
[42:25] extra long to cry out to god and when
[42:28] she woke up she was healed
[42:30] oh that's a good example praise god
[42:32] that's what jehoshaphat did when he was
[42:34] camped out remember he said let's get
[42:36] the prophet the prophet came and said
[42:38] this art this battle i'm fighting for
[42:40] you
