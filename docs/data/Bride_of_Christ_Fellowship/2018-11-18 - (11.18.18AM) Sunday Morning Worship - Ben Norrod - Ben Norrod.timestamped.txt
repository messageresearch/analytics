[33:39] what a privilege it is to be back here
[33:42] with you Saints here in Akron I just
[33:44] appreciate the opportunity to get to
[33:46] come back and appreciate brother Jesse
[33:48] and just enjoying the good singing this
[33:51] morning and good music I was happy to
[33:54] hear that brother was playing the piano
[33:55] I had made my mind up there wasn't going
[33:58] to be nobody here on music this morning
[33:59] I was going to come out and I was going
[34:01] to help play so I said well I'm thinking
[34:03] about helping you and he said he's going
[34:05] to do the I said praise God I was so
[34:07] happy to hear that I I just I love to
[34:10] see young people get in there and doing
[34:12] things for the Lord that that blesses me
[34:14] and uh you know they talk about oh you
[34:16] members so and so on how so-and-so used
[34:18] to doing years ago such and such and I
[34:21] said yeah that's true but one time they
[34:23] were young people learning how to do it
[34:25] too what we need is just another crop of
[34:27] young people coming on and learning how
[34:28] to do all the things everyone said amen
[34:31] and I appreciated seeing that I
[34:33] appreciate hearing that and of course I
[34:35] always like to play and sing and he said
[34:37] I like it I really like it and I told
[34:39] him I said well I said God would give a
[34:41] man the desires of his heart I'd never
[34:43] preach another lick I'd play and sing
[34:45] the rest of my life that's all I'd ever
[34:46] do I enjoy it I I like music and I I
[34:49] feel a little naked as they say this
[34:52] morning my wing girl ain't here with me
[34:54] this morning and uh as most of you know
[34:56] she started teaching seventh grade
[34:58] social studies and so she was called
[35:00] away she had things that she had to
[35:02] attend to school-wise and I I hate it
[35:05] when she don't get to travel with us and
[35:06] I I just miss her when I not around but
[35:09] I've got my middle daughter with me
[35:10] annalize and I'm going to have her sing
[35:13] in just a little bit I'm gonna have her
[35:14] come sing a song and she's quite a
[35:17] singer and you heard the one she wrote
[35:18] and and the Lord's blessing her talents
[35:20] and I'm thankful for that and uh my
[35:24] oldest daughter Elizabeth I want to
[35:25] thank you for praying for her I mean she
[35:27] has had some way to go just to give you
[35:31] a little spot just quickly before we
[35:33] go over here and sing a little bit
[35:36] they um doctors told us a.m that the
[35:40] check her because she's having
[35:41] pancreatitis they have a certain enzyme
[35:44] that releases from your pancreas called
[35:46] lipase and so they check the lipase
[35:48] level to see you know kind of where it's
[35:50] at and it's saying an average person
[35:52] normal healthy person's between 0 and
[35:54] 160. when Elizabeth went into the
[35:56] hospital the other night she was 27 500
[36:00] and some odd numbers and the doctors
[36:02] were scratching their head trying to
[36:03] figure out why on her organs shutting
[36:05] down why isn't her body quitting all
[36:06] together and I just said well it was the
[36:09] hand of the Lord that was what kept her
[36:10] going and God was with the child and so
[36:12] we took her in and uh I had to preach in
[36:16] Canada a couple weekends ago and so I
[36:18] had to leave Saturday morning to head to
[36:20] a place called Wyoming Canada which is
[36:22] over by Port Huron and uh I just walked
[36:25] to the platform at night and I asked the
[36:26] Saints if they would pray and I said I
[36:29] feel like in my heart that this is like
[36:31] you hear Brothers say he hide from the
[36:33] doctor but he can't hide from God I just
[36:35] feel like that this thing is hiding
[36:36] somehow
[36:38] with the first episode of pancreatitis
[36:40] uh you know they couldn't find they'd
[36:42] done eight or ten or 12 tests or what it
[36:44] was and they couldn't find anything well
[36:46] on Sunday before I even got out of the
[36:49] pulpit the doctor had done come in and
[36:51] done said to Samantha well it was hiding
[36:54] on us but we found what was going on he
[36:56] said I and I when he said them words
[36:58] just that way I said well praise the
[37:00] Lord that's exactly what we was thinking
[37:02] on and so
[37:04] your gallbladder which that's one of the
[37:06] first things that they do whenever you
[37:08] start passing a stone like she was
[37:09] passing them uh it was basically like
[37:12] Plumbing it was clogging up her whole
[37:14] system causing everything to back up
[37:16] which is extremely dangerous in the
[37:17] human body in your sink it just cost you
[37:19] a couple hundred dollars to get it fixed
[37:21] but it can kill you otherwise on a human
[37:23] being you know and a gallstone isn't
[37:25] like a kidney stone you can pass those
[37:27] but a gallstone they get stuck in your
[37:30] system and it can just it can just kill
[37:32] you all together so we said well you
[37:34] know I don't like the idea of her being
[37:36] just now in October 12 years old or
[37:38] having to go and have surgery like that
[37:40] but I like the idea of her being alive a
[37:42] whole lot better than having to go on
[37:43] that surgery and so I told him I said
[37:46] well if that's what you're you I said he
[37:48] said I'm 100 sure this is the way so we
[37:51] took her in and they got her ready and I
[37:53] did the surgery took them a couple hours
[37:55] to do the surgery they deliver biopsy
[37:57] while they was in there to check and see
[37:58] if there was anything additional going
[38:00] on and um as we know the uh doc doctor
[38:04] said that everything that he the best he
[38:06] could tell and this was Wednesday we had
[38:08] the final report that we had three
[38:10] appointments right in a row we had to go
[38:11] start from the morning just go all the
[38:13] way through the afternoon and every one
[38:14] of them that we sat down and talked to
[38:16] they just said normal normal normal
[38:18] perfect perfect normal normal every test
[38:21] came out just just exactly right
[38:23] we appreciate your prayers for our
[38:25] daughter and I I tell you that's a you
[38:27] parents know that's a scary thing
[38:28] whenever you come up on things like that
[38:30] and that it just you just don't know how
[38:32] to feel about it sometimes it's a an
[38:34] Emergency thing and I put it on Facebook
[38:36] and I know some people might think well
[38:38] here he is the preacher and he ought to
[38:40] be able to pray through and get a hold
[38:41] of God all by himself but I learned a
[38:43] lesson many years ago when I listen to
[38:45] them tapes and I'd hear the prophet of
[38:47] God talking about demons crying for help
[38:49] whenever they get in trouble and Jesus
[38:51] is about to expose them he said these
[38:52] demons are crying for help they helped
[38:55] me get them to disbelieve and so forth I
[38:57] learned that if Devil's had enough sense
[38:58] to call for help when they're in trouble
[39:00] a saint of God ought to have as much
[39:02] sense to be able to call for help amen
[39:04] so I I like looking out on the on
[39:07] Facebook I was looking at it and there
[39:08] were some two three hundred people from
[39:10] all over the world all over the country
[39:11] praying for our daughter and I said well
[39:12] thank you Lord for that I I tell you
[39:14] it's nice to have people you can depend
[39:16] on like Adam I want to thank the Smith
[39:18] family for their love for us and I I
[39:20] called that a boy yesterday on accident
[39:22] a friend of mine just had a boy and I
[39:24] was just a buddy a buddy how you doing
[39:26] buddy and girl I think it was Carousel
[39:28] one of them said it's a girl I said oh
[39:30] my oh my and I knew that too but I don't
[39:34] know how I did it but I was happy to see
[39:36] the new edition I I like that amen I'm
[39:39] praying everyone I'm become missionaries
[39:41] piano players violent players trumpet
[39:43] players everyone puts in them and just
[39:45] you know just increase their gifts and
[39:47] you got a whole Orchestra right here
[39:49] they actually got a baseball team or a
[39:51] basketball team right there don't you
[39:52] know Jesse something like that amen and
[39:55] I I just just thankful to the Lord and
[39:57] so we love you God bless you and I just
[39:59] wanted to talk to you just a minute and
[40:01] just tell you what's going on of course
[40:02] you know my daddy passed and I
[40:03] appreciate your prayers over that and uh
[40:06] there's a whole lot of things I could
[40:07] tell you on that but I just it was God's
[40:09] time it was God's Will and we um I will
[40:12] tell you this a little part I I did have
[40:14] an experience when I was in the motel
[40:15] room it was August 26 that passed and on
[40:18] the 25th or 24th something like that I
[40:21] was praying and uh brother Jesse I don't
[40:24] like to say this about myself but I just
[40:25] believe it's God things God God stuff
[40:28] you know not me but the the word and and
[40:30] I I was just talking to the Lord and it
[40:33] seemed like the Holy Spirit come to me
[40:34] and said you know you've got the power
[40:36] to speak him out of that bed don't you
[40:38] and I thought
[40:40] yeah Lord according to what you said
[40:42] here in this Bible I do I do I've got
[40:44] that power if a holy ghost filled
[40:46] Christians then I can come again you
[40:48] know you could just speak and to be over
[40:50] with don't you and I thought yeah that's
[40:51] true and then it seemed to come back to
[40:53] me like this but what's the motive
[40:56] what's objective you got dementia you
[40:58] got Alzheimer's you got rheumatoid
[41:00] arthritis he got glaucoma diabetes you
[41:03] know he shuffled when he walked he half
[41:06] the time he just sit in the chair and
[41:07] raise his head and say is this living is
[41:10] this life is this what living's all
[41:12] about so I thought well
[41:14] the motive and the objective would be
[41:16] just a selfish thing just because I'd
[41:17] like to let you around a little bit
[41:19] longer but really I thought every look
[41:22] like every road somehow would just lead
[41:24] to his exit so I just commit Lord I was
[41:28] on my way down to um Dayton down there
[41:30] where they had him and um
[41:32] they called us and they said no no it
[41:34] ain't severe you know might be able to
[41:36] pull out of this so I waited around a
[41:37] little while and uh the evening that I
[41:40] was supposed to be traveling that day in
[41:42] the evening they called us back my
[41:43] brother did who works at Children's
[41:45] Hospital which is about 10 minutes down
[41:46] from Miami Valley where they had him and
[41:48] he said um Benjamin he said ain't too
[41:51] good he said Dad's throwing a clot into
[41:53] his right foot and they're gonna have to
[41:55] amputate his leg all the way up to the
[41:57] top nearly and said if they do that he
[41:59] won't survive the surgery and so on and
[42:01] so forth like that
[42:02] I said I I don't know he said well you
[42:05] probably should get here if you're going
[42:06] to try to get here I said well let's see
[42:08] see what we can work out but I've been
[42:09] looking at plane tickets and I knew that
[42:11] it was way too it was 12 13 14 15 just
[42:14] try to get on the flight get overseeing
[42:16] and I had to preach in Minnesota on uh
[42:19] Thursday morning I had to be in a
[42:21] meeting a whole convention that whole
[42:23] week and I was preaching Michael Tidwell
[42:25] up there and we had a whole string of
[42:26] meetings and uh I thought well I these
[42:30] are advertised meetings people are
[42:31] traveling and I can't just bow out you
[42:33] know I need to try to fulfill my meeting
[42:35] and I knew that's what Dad would want
[42:36] anyways I know he'd want me to go preach
[42:38] instead of sitting around the hospital
[42:39] balling just calling and carrying on and
[42:41] I thought well Lord I don't know what to
[42:43] do and it seemed like the holy spirit
[42:45] said to me look at him again so I I went
[42:48] back to the computer and I pulled up the
[42:50] tickets again
[42:51] I use a little thing called kayak and it
[42:53] pulls up several different ones at a
[42:55] time and you can kind of compare and see
[42:56] which one might be the better flight and
[42:59] I looked at it and where it was thirteen
[43:03] hundred dollars before it was 735
[43:05] dollars and I thought well that's still
[43:07] quite a bit and then I remember brother
[43:09] Jesse earlier in the year I had given up
[43:12] my seat on the way to Arizona and I was
[43:14] going to uh um yeah I was on the way to
[43:18] a meeting in Arizona about real early
[43:20] morning flight five some in the morning
[43:21] when I got to this place uh I started or
[43:24] summer like I forget where they
[43:25] stationed us and I give up my flight
[43:27] because I thought well I got plenty of
[43:28] time to get there I don't have to preach
[43:30] to the next day so this would be nice I
[43:32] can use the money for something later in
[43:33] preaching probably and so they give me
[43:35] an 800 voucher believe it or not I've
[43:37] done that two different times I've done
[43:39] that two different times in the day the
[43:41] first voucher I needed it to get to
[43:43] Trinidad for Easter and that was the
[43:45] voucher that got me there for Easter
[43:47] well I'd stuck this other one in my
[43:49] little cabinet at home and I I hadn't
[43:51] thought much about it I was sitting
[43:53] there and I remembered they had give me
[43:55] that other 800 voucher sitting right
[43:57] over there in that cabinet I pulled it
[43:59] out it was the same airline
[44:01] when it wasn't that Airline before it
[44:03] was the same airline with this voucher
[44:05] so I was able to go and see my daddy my
[44:07] desire was I wanted to lay my hands on
[44:09] him committing to God and I did that I
[44:12] was thankful I had a chance to do that
[44:13] and then of course the Lord took him
[44:15] Sunday morning later that week and so I
[44:17] was I wasn't going to tell you all this
[44:19] but I'm here now anyways might as well
[44:20] stay with it but so I was kind of
[44:23] feeling upset a little bit about having
[44:25] to leave him and go preach so Saturday
[44:27] night I come out of a
[44:29] service I think I got done preaching
[44:31] Saturday I think it was and uh I got
[44:34] done with the service and I believe if I
[44:36] remember correctly it was I kind of
[44:37] walked out the side door like this and I
[44:39] think if I remember at the sister and
[44:40] her husband was standing over toward the
[44:42] door light and she had this piece of
[44:43] paper in her hand like this and I said
[44:45] what's that woman got she's looking
[44:47] right at me when I walked out and was
[44:48] following me around as I go shake hands
[44:50] and things and I thought I thought well
[44:51] either it's a bill or an IOU or some
[44:53] something's going on I didn't know what
[44:55] it was and and you know how your mind
[44:57] does and so I walked over to her and she
[44:59] said brother Ben she said the Lord spoke
[45:00] to me this afternoon and told me to give
[45:02] you something I said yes ma'am she said
[45:04] I was sitting in my chair resting me and
[45:06] my husband she said the Holy Ghost spoke
[45:09] to my heart and said she said I had a
[45:11] great big old bookshelf all the way up
[45:13] to the top nice
[45:15] she had hundreds of books in there and
[45:16] she said the Lord spoke to me and said
[45:17] walk to the cabinet go to the top and
[45:20] said pull off the first book up there in
[45:22] the middle open it up in the paper you
[45:24] fall to take it out and give it to
[45:25] brother Ben I said what'd you do she
[45:27] said I went to the Shelf grabbed the top
[45:28] book right in the middle pulled it down
[45:30] opened it up first paper I got I pulled
[45:32] it out I said you didn't go searching
[45:33] for it she said no the first paper I
[45:35] grabbed it and I'm holding it in my hand
[45:37] now this is Brother Brenham standing in
[45:40] the Pulpit when his mother was dying
[45:42] and he made the remark he said like this
[45:44] he said she may be gone tonight said she
[45:47] may already be gone tomorrow so you may
[45:49] already be gone maybe gone tomorrow but
[45:51] says she's still with us tonight he said
[45:53] and if she is with us tonight by God's
[45:56] grace he said I'll be here at the pulpit
[45:57] to fulfill my duty for it becometh me to
[46:00] fulfill all righteousness
[46:01] and I thought well Lord you you're
[46:03] mindful of even these little things like
[46:05] this now I'm saying that to say this
[46:07] the whole reason that I even preach and
[46:09] do like I do is because of my dad when I
[46:12] was 12 years old my father
[46:14] he became permanently disabled with
[46:16] rheumatoid arthritis is permanently
[46:17] disabled he stuck me in a car and packed
[46:21] me across the country take me all these
[46:22] holy ghost meetings and introduce that's
[46:25] how I met brother Carol that's how I met
[46:26] my wife him and all these people and
[46:28] when I was a sinner of course I was
[46:31] raised in the message and I I was in a
[46:34] camp meeting as the night before I got
[46:35] saved there's a fellow there by name of
[46:37] Steve Shelley preaching and he was
[46:38] preaching House of hell and he was
[46:40] talking about uh House of Hell giveaway
[46:42] and then people just got to screaming
[46:44] and hollering House of Hell giveaway
[46:46] women screaming man shaking and running
[46:48] all over the place is mournful it scared
[46:50] me to death I got up out of there and as
[46:52] I walked out the door like this my daddy
[46:53] was standing here looking at me like
[46:55] this
[46:56] my grandpa was Benny Albert and dad
[46:59] always called me Benny he said where are
[47:01] you going Benny I said Daddy that scares
[47:04] me to death he said don't run from it
[47:07] run to it
[47:09] next morning I received the baptism of
[47:11] the Holy Ghost
[47:13] and I I owe a lot to him and I just
[47:16] wanted to say that and
[47:19] I don't exactly know him maybe you know
[47:21] if they look over the banister of time
[47:23] you know and they get to see what's
[47:25] going on here you like to say thank you
[47:27] a lot you know and how you appreciate
[47:29] them but really I thank God my father
[47:33] for my Earthly dad
[47:36] and it's a lot of the reason why I'm
[47:37] here this morning but it's amazing how
[47:39] even in these hard times like this God
[47:41] was so mindful to let you know that
[47:44] every step every footstep every pathway
[47:46] but could you imagine laying there in a
[47:49] hospital dying they don't send him to
[47:51] hospice he's already in the hospice by
[47:53] this time the Holy Spirit speak to you
[47:55] and say you know you got power to change
[47:56] that don't you now brother sister I'm
[47:58] going to tell you something if you don't
[48:00] have character and I don't claim I got
[48:02] anything except for what God's done for
[48:03] me but if you don't have the right kind
[48:05] of character boy somebody could make a
[48:07] show out of that oh look at me and I've
[48:09] got power and this and that but you know
[48:11] I learned through the years seek for the
[48:14] will of God
[48:15] and seek for what God wants don't seek
[48:18] for what you want and that's really the
[48:20] key of Christianity God thy will be done
[48:23] not my own and not the Lord's Prayer
[48:25] amen so anyhow I just wanted to share
[48:27] that with you we love you and appreciate
[48:30] you and I appreciate your prayers and uh
[48:33] I just thought them little things were
[48:34] outstanding I I wanted to share them so
[48:36] God bless you I'm saying and we'll get
[48:37] right into this preach in just a minute

[55:32] [Music]
[55:34] good job
[55:37] good job kid
[55:43] let's stand together this morning
[55:45] amen
[55:47] praise the Lord
[55:50] let's turn this morning to Acts chapter
[55:51] 2.
[55:54] we'll speak to you this morning on these
[55:56] two words one thing
[55:58] one thing
[56:01] amen these two words one
[56:03] thing
[56:05] Acts chapter 2 verse 38.
[56:09] now if you're a Bible read it all you
[56:11] know exactly what this scripture is all
[56:13] about amen
[56:15] amen
[56:17] then Peter said unto them repent
[56:20] and be baptized every one of you in the
[56:23] name of Jesus Christ for the remission
[56:26] of sins
[56:28] and you shall receive the gift
[56:31] not gifts now but gift
[56:33] of the Holy Ghost because there is only
[56:35] one true gift
[56:37] it might break up into nine different
[56:38] gifts later might break up into five
[56:41] offices later but there's only one true
[56:43] gift and that's the gift of the Holy
[56:46] Ghost amen praise the Lord look at that
[56:49] again repent every one of you repent
[56:54] every one of you let's pray together for
[56:56] the word Lord Jesus we thank you this
[56:58] morning for the opportunity to come into
[57:00] your house Lord we are so privileged as
[57:03] your children to be able to Bow our
[57:05] heads over the word of God that's been
[57:07] carved out Lord that's been
[57:10] sacrificed and martyrs and so forth to
[57:12] give their life to us as your children
[57:15] to be able to read from this sacred text
[57:16] this morning and we thank you Lord this
[57:19] morning for the Bible we pray that as
[57:21] the reading has gone forth now that you
[57:23] will come and bring to us a context of
[57:25] this which we're studying this morning
[57:27] may you anoint me May unite the people
[57:29] that we might be receptive and we love
[57:32] you so much Lord for everything you've
[57:33] done in our lives and I know Lord Jesus
[57:36] as I stand here this morning there's
[57:37] probably many many needs right here in
[57:40] this little body of people here at bride
[57:42] of Christ Fellowship and I pray that
[57:43] you'll minister to every need this
[57:45] morning may the Holy Ghost just come
[57:48] today and give us the freedom and the
[57:50] Liberty to be able to express what you
[57:52] have in your mind this morning as we
[57:54] yield ourselves to you for your service
[57:56] in the name of Jesus Christ we commit
[57:58] the word now both speaker and listener
[58:00] and oh God if we've done anything or
[58:03] said anything in a sinful manner to be
[58:04] displeasing to you forgive us of it
[58:06] quickly Lord cleanse Us by thy blood and
[58:08] wash Us by the blood as we say thing
[58:10] coming out here Lord about the precious
[58:12] blood of Christ make it right for us
[58:15] Lord in every way we pray in Jesus
[58:17] Christ's name we commit ourselves now
[58:18] into your hands amen and amen and all
[58:22] the saints said amen and praise the Lord
[58:23] hallelujah and glory to God amen amen
[58:26] you may be seated may the Lord bless you
[58:28] real good
[58:29] now let's turn to Saint John chapter 3
[58:32] while you've got your Bible open there
[58:34] and we're going to go to a very familiar
[58:37] picture on the new birth here on the
[58:39] first doctrine that Jesus ever shown and
[58:42] that was here with Nicodemus but now
[58:45] when you get your place there in the
[58:47] scripture just hold it steady for just a
[58:48] moment because I want to give you a
[58:50] foundation if you will on what we're
[58:52] going to talk about this morning the
[58:53] Lord helping us and um you know
[58:56] sometimes in evangelism I like to uh I
[59:00] like to bring things that I think is
[59:02] going to help the body and it changes
[59:04] every place you go sometimes you go to
[59:06] places and you might have a more uh
[59:09] scholarly type group well then I just
[59:10] preach like a Firebrand and I don't know
[59:13] my feet hit the ground I just float the
[59:15] whole time and then when I get on the
[59:16] other side and hit a church it's always
[59:18] up in the clouds and I just anchor
[59:20] myself down and I amen go right into the
[59:22] teaching of the word of God and try to
[59:24] bring balance as part of evangelism is
[59:26] bringing balance everywhere you go and I
[59:28] know pastors have that responsibility
[59:30] but it is also our job as a an
[59:33] evangelist to reprove
[59:36] long-suffering and Doctrine and I think
[59:38] that being that it is my responsibility
[59:40] as an evangelist to come in and set the
[59:43] city on fire run back out as hard as we
[59:46] can go I I it's always needful to try to
[59:49] find what God would have in our our
[59:51] hearts about where we should go and how
[59:54] to go and what to say and how to
[59:56] approach it because you never want to do
[59:57] this with your own mind you understand
[59:58] you never want to try to say well I
[1:00:00] think the people need this the minute
[1:00:02] you get that in your mind you'll be as
[1:00:03] wrong as 100 miles is from 100 miles
[1:00:06] apart and just be wrong just absolutely
[1:00:08] wrong and backwards and and it won't
[1:00:10] help nobody and and I I learned that you
[1:00:13] can't use your mind of how you're going
[1:00:15] to approach it and there's been many
[1:00:16] times you walk out of the office and you
[1:00:18] think now God I don't know where I'm
[1:00:19] going to go or how I'm going to get
[1:00:21] there but I'm just going to trust you
[1:00:22] and what seemingly sometimes what you
[1:00:26] think would be the wrong thing to say
[1:00:28] turns out to be the exact thing you
[1:00:30] should have been saying all along well
[1:00:32] the Lord knows how to manage these
[1:00:34] things if we allow him to do it and you
[1:00:36] know in my my thinking I feel like that
[1:00:39] if we would allow God to have control
[1:00:41] over our lives over our walk with him I
[1:00:44] feel like that he knows the right
[1:00:46] pathway for all of us there's only
[1:00:49] really one thing that God has ever
[1:00:52] really required of us in the way of
[1:00:54] Ovation and that is what we just read
[1:00:57] right here in Acts 2 38 repent now you
[1:01:00] say of course be baptized yes but all of
[1:01:02] that comes after this one thing this one
[1:01:05] thing is repent it's the only thing that
[1:01:08] God has ever really asked of us now as I
[1:01:11] say it's good for us to give our lives
[1:01:13] over to Jesus Christ and allow him to
[1:01:15] take control allow him to lead us and to
[1:01:18] guide us because if you allow man to
[1:01:20] lead your allow some human being of some
[1:01:23] sort to lead you in some way that man
[1:01:25] will always use his thinking on how he
[1:01:28] thinks things should be done and we've
[1:01:30] seen examples all over creation that you
[1:01:32] know when a man's doing the leading it
[1:01:34] always ends up in some disaster it
[1:01:36] always ends up in some wrong way or some
[1:01:39] deal like that no matter how successful
[1:01:41] the person is if a man's doing the
[1:01:43] leading it always ends up in the failure
[1:01:45] down the road somewhere you see examples
[1:01:47] all the time of these businessmen make
[1:01:49] millions and billions of dollars and
[1:01:50] they're the spotlight of all the
[1:01:52] industry and all of that then come down
[1:01:53] to the end of row old and be like
[1:01:55] somebody like Jack Daniels who kicked a
[1:01:57] safe got mad because it wouldn't open up
[1:01:59] kicked his safe and ended up dying from
[1:02:01] gangrene in his toe after making
[1:02:03] millions of dollars selling his whiskey
[1:02:04] so really when man's leading even what
[1:02:07] looks like a success it's a complete
[1:02:09] failure at the very end of the row
[1:02:10] because really when they've shut those
[1:02:12] coffins down on many of them that I've
[1:02:14] preached in their funerals and sang and
[1:02:16] what more in their funerals and they
[1:02:17] shut that coffin down on that person I
[1:02:19] have yet to see all of their houses and
[1:02:21] lands and monies and stock exchanges and
[1:02:24] all that go in there with them they go
[1:02:26] into the ground they're buried six foot
[1:02:27] under as the expression goes and they're
[1:02:30] left there without any Earthly thing to
[1:02:33] take with them except for this one thing
[1:02:36] whether they did that or didn't do that
[1:02:38] as God has required it whether they
[1:02:39] repented or whether they did not repent
[1:02:42] this is the only thing God has ever
[1:02:44] really asked of us as his children now I
[1:02:47] realize that you know there's Holiness
[1:02:48] things that God asked us to do I realize
[1:02:50] the three main articles to the church uh
[1:02:53] water baptism uh communion and foot
[1:02:56] washing or his brother Joe foreign which
[1:02:59] I kind of like amen and you get in there
[1:03:01] and you absolutely uh do these things
[1:03:04] because you love the Lord we don't take
[1:03:05] the bread and we don't drink the wine
[1:03:07] because we believe it's a literal Body
[1:03:08] of Christ we do it because it's a symbol
[1:03:11] it is a symbol to show the Lord's death
[1:03:13] until he comes his broken body
[1:03:15] unleavened bread why not grape juice now
[1:03:18] but wine which has a Resurrection Life
[1:03:20] in it it is the blood of the grapes it
[1:03:23] is the death the barrel and the
[1:03:24] resurrection of Those Grapes that bring
[1:03:25] forth wine it's not grape juice because
[1:03:28] grape juice has got additives in it
[1:03:30] man's doctrines and trinitarian
[1:03:31] everything else stuff down in it but
[1:03:33] wine is pure amen all the way through it
[1:03:35] which represents Jesus Christ and his
[1:03:38] very Doctrine itself because everything
[1:03:40] that you look at in the natural way of
[1:03:42] what God's asked us to do all of that is
[1:03:45] secondary to this one main thing that
[1:03:48] God is requiring of us and that is to
[1:03:50] repent to make our hearts right with God
[1:03:52] now as you got your Bible open there
[1:03:54] Saint John chapter 3 let's start at
[1:03:56] verse 1. there's a man of the Pharisees
[1:03:58] named Nicodemus a ruler of the Jews the
[1:04:01] same came to Jesus by night and said
[1:04:03] unto him Rabbi I watch these words we
[1:04:06] know that thou art a teacher come from
[1:04:10] God we know that thou art a teacher come
[1:04:13] from God now here again I want to stress
[1:04:16] to you as I started out saying these
[1:04:18] words anytime man is leading the show
[1:04:20] it's always bound to fail now here these
[1:04:23] men they are aware that Jesus Christ is
[1:04:25] on the scene they are mindful of what
[1:04:28] kind of man he really is because he
[1:04:30] testifies right here we know who you are
[1:04:32] but rather than this man Nicodemus come
[1:04:35] to the Lord Jesus and say all right
[1:04:36] we're coming in a repentant heart we're
[1:04:39] coming in a repentant attitude we're
[1:04:41] asking you to do for us what no other
[1:04:44] human being can do on this planet
[1:04:45] because you are the Messiah you are the
[1:04:48] lamb that takes away the sins of the
[1:04:49] world we are committing and surrendering
[1:04:52] ourselves to you but instead of doing
[1:04:55] that Nicodemus wants to argue
[1:04:58] watch him here in the next few verses
[1:04:59] now if he knows that he's a teacher come
[1:05:02] from God
[1:05:03] explain to me then why he didn't fall
[1:05:05] down at his feet and say master teach me
[1:05:08] you don't see this out of him now watch
[1:05:11] he says Jesus answered said verily I say
[1:05:14] unto thee except a man be born again he
[1:05:17] cannot see the kingdom of God Nicodemus
[1:05:19] says how can he be a man be born when he
[1:05:21] is old and he entered his second time in
[1:05:23] his mother's womb and be born Jesus
[1:05:26] answered verily I say unto thee except a
[1:05:29] man be born of water and of the spirit
[1:05:30] he cannot enter into the kingdom of God
[1:05:33] now watch this carefully
[1:05:35] now here Jesus goes through all of these
[1:05:37] remarks
[1:05:39] got about well I guess I'm trying to
[1:05:41] count here one two three four five six
[1:05:43] seven eight nine verses all together
[1:05:46] that really brings this conversation
[1:05:48] into what the Holy Ghost is all about
[1:05:51] and in verse 4 instead of Nicodemus
[1:05:54] saying now Jesus
[1:05:56] this whole born-again thing is above me
[1:05:59] I need you to teach me I need you to
[1:06:02] show me if there's something I'm lacking
[1:06:04] I want to know what it is that you're
[1:06:07] talking about instead of doing that he
[1:06:09] has a arrogant attitude
[1:06:11] he's ready to argue with Jesus now if
[1:06:14] you don't think so look at these next
[1:06:16] words and uh verse 9 look at nicodemus's
[1:06:19] next words how can these things be you
[1:06:22] see how he's not doing like the woman at
[1:06:24] the well he's not doing like the blind
[1:06:26] man he's not doing like the rest of them
[1:06:27] that said oh God have mercy on me a
[1:06:30] sinner he's debating Jesus Christ
[1:06:33] rather than have the attitude of saying
[1:06:35] Mighty God you are a teacher come from
[1:06:38] God and I am surrendering myself to you
[1:06:40] he enters into a debate with him or I'd
[1:06:43] like to preach right here for just a
[1:06:44] minute how many people are doing the
[1:06:46] very same thing with Jesus Christ oh you
[1:06:48] say Jesus isn't here the Bible said he's
[1:06:50] the same yesterday today and forever
[1:06:53] he is here in his word he is here and
[1:06:56] his bride he is here in the form of the
[1:06:58] Holy Spirit yes yes sir yes ma'am Jesus
[1:07:01] Christ is here you want to want to
[1:07:03] answer the question he's here he's here
[1:07:05] right now amen you say how do you know
[1:07:07] the Bible said we're two and three are
[1:07:08] gathered and if they're gathered in my
[1:07:10] name if they're gathered in the Holy
[1:07:12] Spirit I'll be right there in the midst
[1:07:14] of them not just gather for gathers sake
[1:07:16] but gathered wanting to receive from
[1:07:18] almighty God what he has in his word
[1:07:21] one of the hardest things that it is to
[1:07:23] accept though is somebody always wanting
[1:07:26] to debate something now here's where I
[1:07:27] run into a lot of things down through
[1:07:29] the years I've been at this 27 years
[1:07:31] this June coming up on 28 years next
[1:07:33] summer and I preached my whole life I've
[1:07:36] dealt with hundreds of thousands of
[1:07:37] people in my lifetime tens of thousands
[1:07:39] of cases and I I don't say these things
[1:07:41] I just say it for them to make a point
[1:07:43] and every one of them are always the
[1:07:45] same I don't care if they're yellow skin
[1:07:47] or white skin or black skin or red skin
[1:07:49] or whoever they might be I promise you
[1:07:52] people are people and it don't matter if
[1:07:54] they're This Tall or this tall or you
[1:07:57] know ever what they might be or going
[1:07:58] the other direction like me you know hey
[1:08:00] they're people and they have their own
[1:08:02] way and their own approach of doing
[1:08:04] things and listen to me friends people
[1:08:06] are influenced by Spirits all around
[1:08:09] this world they're influenced by devils
[1:08:11] and Satan is the same Satan he's always
[1:08:13] been from the very beginning he's just
[1:08:16] gotten smarter he's just has got more
[1:08:18] devices more tools more ways of being
[1:08:21] able to get at the child of God or get
[1:08:23] at the human being and we know that the
[1:08:25] devil has all of these imps around him
[1:08:28] that are willing at any moment to do his
[1:08:30] bidding hey we are up against the
[1:08:33] greatest battle that any human being
[1:08:35] could ever fight in this dispensation
[1:08:37] we're up against it right now has never
[1:08:40] has there been a time where Satan has
[1:08:42] been has got so much exposure so much he
[1:08:45] can get a hold of everything from
[1:08:46] Hollywood down to the churches he's got
[1:08:48] his hands wrapped in every one of them
[1:08:51] and for us we have to be smart we have
[1:08:53] to be wise to Satan's devices and I see
[1:08:57] people get influenced by things even in
[1:08:59] churches oh you say well glory to God I
[1:09:01] come to church but being in this church
[1:09:02] doesn't make you any more of a Christian
[1:09:03] than standing in a garage makes you an
[1:09:05] automobile come on somebody amen it
[1:09:09] doesn't mean anything as far as your
[1:09:10] experience with God being in the church
[1:09:12] house is only just being in this
[1:09:14] building this very same building by next
[1:09:16] week time could be converted into a a
[1:09:18] into a lodge of some sort to meet for
[1:09:21] the uh you know for some kind of a uh
[1:09:23] you know men's Gathering some motorcycle
[1:09:25] club or so I mean it doesn't matter
[1:09:27] about the actual physical building
[1:09:29] itself it is your heart right with
[1:09:31] almighty God and are you living where
[1:09:33] you should that's what matters
[1:09:36] but as I say people are people they
[1:09:38] always do the things they want to do
[1:09:39] they behave the way they want to behave
[1:09:41] they act brother Jesse the way they want
[1:09:42] to act
[1:09:43] and no matter what you tell them unless
[1:09:46] they can willing to do this one thing
[1:09:49] it'll be debate debate debate debate
[1:09:52] debate it all comes down to this one
[1:09:55] thing as I started to tell you as an
[1:09:57] evangelist I travel and I try to find
[1:09:59] out what will help the people to kind of
[1:10:01] bring a little bit of a balance now I
[1:10:03] know some brothers when they come they
[1:10:04] find a church that shouts and tears the
[1:10:06] walls down they get in there with them
[1:10:07] and do the same thing glory to God we've
[1:10:09] had a meeting I'm a little bit different
[1:10:11] I guess I've got a little bit of a
[1:10:12] Defiance disorder in me I like to rub
[1:10:15] against the grain a little bit because I
[1:10:17] feel like that a false balance is
[1:10:18] wickedness before the Lord and you got
[1:10:20] people real flighty like that and ain't
[1:10:22] got no foundation in the word well I say
[1:10:24] glory to God open your Bible we're going
[1:10:25] to read some scriptures tonight I'd like
[1:10:27] to just anchor it down
[1:10:30] but in my mind I'm thinking God I'm
[1:10:33] going to try to help these people get
[1:10:34] somewhere I'm trying to say something to
[1:10:36] you and I want you to follow my thought
[1:10:37] here that whenever you get somebody to
[1:10:40] that spot you think all right now here
[1:10:41] we are two hours into preaching an hour
[1:10:43] and a half of what it is I went through
[1:10:45] 500 scriptures and I've got them
[1:10:47] anchored down now they walk right out
[1:10:49] the door the same way they walked in
[1:10:51] then I go to another church and there
[1:10:53] might be a stoic you know kind of
[1:10:54] backward type group everyone it might be
[1:10:56] and I try to preach the walls on fire
[1:10:58] they walk out the same way they walked
[1:11:00] in you know why there's only one thing
[1:11:02] God ever required of us and that's
[1:11:04] repentance what you find out in this
[1:11:07] life friends is it's not about whether
[1:11:09] or not you can kindly balance and like I
[1:11:11] said I do it for the right motive I try
[1:11:13] to balance people in the word I try to
[1:11:14] be a balanced type preacher I don't want
[1:11:17] to go on there and just do what
[1:11:18] everybody likes and act as everybody
[1:11:20] wants me to act I try to find what will
[1:11:22] help the church even if it's a little
[1:11:23] bit different sometimes I want to try to
[1:11:25] help the body but in all of that all of
[1:11:28] the wisdom you can apply and all of the
[1:11:30] smarts you can put together
[1:11:31] it still takes us one thing right here
[1:11:33] to get them where they need to get
[1:11:35] whether they're willing to repent now I
[1:11:37] know in our mind repentance means coming
[1:11:39] to you Alder and screaming cry God
[1:11:40] forgive me God forgive me if there's
[1:11:42] many different ways to repent and I
[1:11:44] believe in that too that needs to happen
[1:11:46] absolutely many times in churches that's
[1:11:48] why some people don't get any further
[1:11:49] with God they're not willing to break
[1:11:50] down their pride and things and come and
[1:11:52] cry out to the Lord they need to do it
[1:11:54] sometimes I need to do it sometimes you
[1:11:56] need to do it sometimes it's a part of
[1:11:58] our walk with God don't you agree
[1:12:00] now notice Nicodemus is not in an
[1:12:03] interview you study this conversation
[1:12:05] closely you'll find out he's not in the
[1:12:07] mode of repenting this is not Nicodemus
[1:12:10] coming to Jesus saying master I need
[1:12:12] your help he's coming to him like one of
[1:12:14] these smarter like message guys that
[1:12:15] knows everything
[1:12:17] you know I know have you know Jesus I
[1:12:19] mean maybe Nicodemus was an older man
[1:12:22] physically speaking he might have been
[1:12:23] older than the Lord Jesus they tried
[1:12:25] that trick on him one time he said
[1:12:26] before Abraham was I am amen
[1:12:29] amen he always seek to come Osama
[1:12:32] approach and you watch his Pharisees and
[1:12:34] his Sadducees sister Wendy they never
[1:12:36] came to Jesus to understand what the
[1:12:39] truth of the Gospel really was all about
[1:12:41] they came for debate's sake well I think
[1:12:44] this and I think that and I feel this
[1:12:46] and I believe that you notice even when
[1:12:49] Nicodemus is responding to Jesus in
[1:12:51] verse 9. how can these things be that is
[1:12:54] not the attitude of a repentant man
[1:12:57] if the man is willing to repent
[1:12:58] everything that Jesus said to him he
[1:13:00] ought to have been saying Lord I don't
[1:13:02] understand it but help me get there
[1:13:04] help me get there help me understand how
[1:13:06] do I get from what you're talking about
[1:13:08] from where I am to where you're trying
[1:13:10] to take me help me get there how do I
[1:13:12] get there God
[1:13:13] it would have been important it's the
[1:13:16] one thing that God requires of us for
[1:13:18] salvation the only one thing he's ever
[1:13:20] asked us to do but it's the one thing
[1:13:22] many people won't do
[1:13:25] I I hope you take this right but I have
[1:13:28] used every every Evangelistic trick in
[1:13:30] the book
[1:13:31] and then our tricks believe me when I
[1:13:33] tell you I have used every expression I
[1:13:36] should every one-liner I've used every
[1:13:39] catchphrase trying to move the people in
[1:13:41] some direction or another and I found
[1:13:43] out almost 30 years of this there's only
[1:13:46] one thing that you can get them to do
[1:13:50] and if they're not willing to do that
[1:13:51] all of the catch phrases and all the
[1:13:53] good one-liners and all that listen
[1:13:55] brother I when I first started I was a
[1:13:58] Firebrand when I started I still am a
[1:14:00] Firebrand I still love to preach and and
[1:14:02] move in the anointing I'm not ashamed of
[1:14:04] Pentecostal type of knowing I like it I
[1:14:07] think it's wonderful I enjoy being a
[1:14:09] part of the Holy Ghost movie
[1:14:10] I love it I think it's God in action in
[1:14:13] The Last Day
[1:14:14] and I started out a Firebrand I'll
[1:14:16] probably go out of here a Firebrand amen
[1:14:19] when I started boy I'd kicked my leg
[1:14:22] this way Hallelujah glory to God hoping
[1:14:24] somebody would wake up
[1:14:26] then I'd come over on this side glory to
[1:14:28] God praise the Lord
[1:14:30] I'd have big older calls I was in a
[1:14:32] meeting one time and there was 300
[1:14:34] people just packed right up and down the
[1:14:36] aisles me and Timmy was in Mexico some
[1:14:38] time ago and and had an honor call and
[1:14:40] they was going out the back of the door
[1:14:41] while he was preaching I've seen him get
[1:14:44] out and cry and holler and Carry On and
[1:14:46] Shout use gifts and everything else in
[1:14:48] the world
[1:14:49] but after the meeting's over with it
[1:14:50] they still wasn't willing to have this
[1:14:52] repentant attitude
[1:14:53] it didn't matter if you kick your leg
[1:14:55] this way or kick your leg that way or
[1:14:57] hold your hands this way or hold them
[1:14:59] that way or be loud or be soft or be
[1:15:01] scholarly or be Pentecostal it's just
[1:15:03] one thing that they've got to be willing
[1:15:05] to do in order to get them somewhere
[1:15:07] amen I hope we're checking up this
[1:15:09] morning on our own attitudes about the
[1:15:11] word of God when you hear something that
[1:15:13] rubs your grain stop and ask yourself
[1:15:14] why'd that rub me
[1:15:17] praise the Lord somebody
[1:15:19] is it because I've got to repent
[1:15:21] attitude and it just rubbed my flesh a
[1:15:23] little bit or is it because I'm a little
[1:15:25] bit stubborn when it comes to what I
[1:15:26] think ought to be done remember what I
[1:15:28] said man always leads you in the wrong
[1:15:30] direction even if you're the man that's
[1:15:32] doing the leading
[1:15:33] man always takes you in a Direction
[1:15:35] that's contrary to the word of God man
[1:15:38] cannot keep this word if he could we we
[1:15:41] wouldn't have needed Jesus Christ
[1:15:42] hi hey man now I want to say something
[1:15:45] while I'm here it has been said about
[1:15:47] people in this message that oh you know
[1:15:49] and I had a friend of mine that some
[1:15:51] years ago he left the message and and I
[1:15:54] was very very close to this brother and
[1:15:56] it it broke our hearts when he decided
[1:15:57] to leave the message and I thought you
[1:15:59] know what what a shame this brother he
[1:16:01] had a real real Ministry before the Lord
[1:16:03] it was a real good-hearted guy and a
[1:16:05] pastor and how to do I mean he went out
[1:16:07] in the middle of nowhere I mean nowhere
[1:16:08] there wasn't no there's one message
[1:16:09] Church within 300 miles of him he went
[1:16:12] in the middle of nowhere and carved a
[1:16:13] message search out right almost the side
[1:16:15] of the mountain as we say in Tennessee
[1:16:16] now and and I love this man I thought
[1:16:19] you know I really appreciated his
[1:16:21] friendship I appreciate it when he left
[1:16:23] the message it broke our hearts of
[1:16:24] course and the report came back he said
[1:16:27] one problem he had about people in this
[1:16:29] message is we present this message as
[1:16:32] the only means of salvation
[1:16:35] I said
[1:16:37] you said everybody not me
[1:16:39] I don't
[1:16:40] I said this message is not a means of
[1:16:42] Salvation this message is for rapturing
[1:16:45] faith in the Readiness of Jesus Christ
[1:16:47] coming the second time
[1:16:49] salvation comes by Jesus Christ Alone
[1:16:53] anybody can repent but it takes them to
[1:16:56] another level when they come into the
[1:16:57] revelation of this message
[1:16:59] this message is not for everybody this
[1:17:03] message is the opening of The Book of
[1:17:04] Revelation come on now this message is
[1:17:07] the finishing of the mysteries of God
[1:17:09] but this message is not a means of
[1:17:11] Salvation that comes by Jesus Christ
[1:17:14] Alone
[1:17:17] now with that said if you are saved and
[1:17:19] you are bride you will come to this
[1:17:21] message absolutely the Holy Ghost will
[1:17:23] lead you and guide you into all truth
[1:17:25] and this message is the truth
[1:17:26] I believe that I believe with all of my
[1:17:29] heart I believe that everything that
[1:17:30] brother Branham taught us I believe
[1:17:32] could be right back here to the
[1:17:33] scripture and can be balanced out with
[1:17:36] what Jesus taught with all these other
[1:17:37] prophets Paul and the rest of them I
[1:17:39] believe brother when he went beyond the
[1:17:40] curtain of time and told the angel of
[1:17:42] the Lord I preached exactly what Paul
[1:17:44] prayed I believe
[1:17:46] I believe that's what he preached
[1:17:49] but we present sometimes I say we I mean
[1:17:52] some message people that in order to be
[1:17:54] saved you've got to know the name
[1:17:56] William Branham but I ain't what the
[1:17:58] Bible said the Bible said that any man
[1:18:00] that would know the name of Jesus Christ
[1:18:02] could be saved
[1:18:04] that's true now there are different
[1:18:06] means of salvation Salvation don't mean
[1:18:09] bride I'm teaching now brother Jesse I'm
[1:18:12] out of that evangelistical thing for
[1:18:14] about 30 seconds okay I'm teaching now
[1:18:15] for a minute but Salvation don't always
[1:18:18] mean bride there'll be a saved group of
[1:18:20] people that will dwell on the outside of
[1:18:22] the city that comes back to this earth
[1:18:23] there'll be saved people that never knew
[1:18:26] nothing about this message matter of
[1:18:27] fact they were only saved because they
[1:18:29] were good to you
[1:18:30] there's a group of foolish virgins that
[1:18:32] will inherit eternal life or not inhere
[1:18:34] to be given to eternal life rather
[1:18:35] simply because they were cut off the
[1:18:38] bride cloth and God allows them to go in
[1:18:40] as the remnant that come off this bride
[1:18:42] time
[1:18:43] they never had the Holy Ghost but they
[1:18:45] were saved people they knew salvation by
[1:18:48] Jesus Christ Alone
[1:18:50] then there'll be a group of people that
[1:18:52] will be saved that will have salvation
[1:18:55] that would come on in through salvation
[1:18:57] but would never make the Bride of Jesus
[1:19:00] Christ in any way whatsoever who those
[1:19:02] people are I don't know Jesus
[1:19:04] categorizes them as when I was in prison
[1:19:06] you visited me when I was sick you
[1:19:09] brought me this or you've done that for
[1:19:10] me yes there are a people that's good to
[1:19:13] the bride but there's also a saved group
[1:19:15] that comes in at the same time
[1:19:18] they're not bride
[1:19:20] but they're saved I've heard the prophet
[1:19:22] of God taught that saved don't mean born
[1:19:24] again
[1:19:25] [Music]
[1:19:27] you can be saved and not be born again
[1:19:30] absolutely right I'll use the example
[1:19:33] that my buddy Andrew Glover uses he said
[1:19:35] if you walked out here on this parking
[1:19:37] lot and you saw a cell phone line on the
[1:19:39] parking lot you picked that cell phone
[1:19:41] up you've saved it you brought it in
[1:19:43] here and get the real Jesse one of these
[1:19:44] brothers and said hey I found this cell
[1:19:46] phone somebody could have run it over
[1:19:47] stepped on it got rained on snowed on
[1:19:49] everyone I've saved that cell phone but
[1:19:52] if I pick that cell phone up off the
[1:19:53] parking lot and I flip it around and
[1:19:55] it's my cell phone I have not saved it I
[1:19:58] have redeemed it I have brought it back
[1:20:00] to the original owner altogether
[1:20:03] because I was the original owner it was
[1:20:06] my cell phone and I brought it back to
[1:20:08] me oh Hallelujah now the difference in
[1:20:12] being saved and being born again is the
[1:20:14] difference between saved and Redemption
[1:20:17] there is no Redemption for anybody
[1:20:20] outside of the Bride of Jesus Christ
[1:20:22] that's thus saith the Lord
[1:20:25] Redemption is alone for those that had
[1:20:29] their names on the Lamb's Book of Life
[1:20:31] before the foundation of the world
[1:20:34] at 144 000 are included in that bride
[1:20:37] type because Israel was God's bride
[1:20:39] before he put it away to come over here
[1:20:41] to these Gentiles but that bride part
[1:20:43] all of that is redemption God brings you
[1:20:46] back if you was already his before the
[1:20:48] foundation of the world
[1:20:50] but God allowed this this stream of
[1:20:53] human time whenever Eve fell in the
[1:20:55] Garden of Eden and so forth like that he
[1:20:57] allowed in this stream of time tens of
[1:20:59] thousands of people to be born in this
[1:21:01] world that would have never originally
[1:21:03] been intended had she stayed behind that
[1:21:05] word of God like she was supposed to
[1:21:07] tens of thousands of people that were
[1:21:10] never intended to be here on this Earth
[1:21:12] brother Adam said the way God was going
[1:21:13] to do it was take the book of life and
[1:21:15] Adam would take that Lamb's Book and
[1:21:17] speak him from the dust to the ground
[1:21:18] and only the names that was on that book
[1:21:20] would have come forth but I hear Eve
[1:21:22] falls in the Garden of Eden now we have
[1:21:24] another program coming in now you have
[1:21:27] one son another son ten Sons forty
[1:21:29] dollars you have all of this Humanity
[1:21:31] coming in and God is not willing that
[1:21:33] any of them should perish
[1:21:35] but all of them should come to
[1:21:37] everlasting life so how does God fix it
[1:21:39] that bride foolish virgin good to the
[1:21:42] bride all of these groups can get a
[1:21:43] chance even Judas got a chance at being
[1:21:46] saved and in one way he was saved
[1:21:51] he was justified he was sanctified
[1:21:54] the prophet of God said when Judas was
[1:21:56] baptized the devil got baptized
[1:22:00] when Judas preached the gospel of the
[1:22:02] devil preached the gospel
[1:22:04] and one way of looking at things Judah
[1:22:07] stood there amen his name was on the
[1:22:09] Lamb's Book of Life which we know is
[1:22:11] another section of that book of life
[1:22:12] that name can be blotted out the ones on
[1:22:15] the lamb section can never be blotted
[1:22:17] out
[1:22:17] amen that gives me a consolation to know
[1:22:19] that no matter what I do or how I live
[1:22:21] in this life God is obligated to make me
[1:22:23] do right and go right
[1:22:25] I'm a child of God and I say well I'm
[1:22:27] going to quit I'm going to give up I've
[1:22:29] had enough of this life there's always
[1:22:31] something there it's always drive you
[1:22:33] back the other direction
[1:22:35] amen thank God for that little something
[1:22:37] that lays on the inside amen I've said
[1:22:40] it many times the one lesson that I've
[1:22:41] learned as a Christian was it's never
[1:22:43] been me holding on to him it's always
[1:22:46] been him holding on to me
[1:22:48] amen because of things you see in this
[1:22:50] life the older you get the harder you
[1:22:52] get and it wasn't for you know the grace
[1:22:55] of God in our lives I would quit all
[1:22:57] together I'd leave this whole thing
[1:22:59] called the message I'd leave this stuff
[1:23:00] this church stuff and all this old
[1:23:02] nonsense walk out and do my own thing
[1:23:04] but then that's what use about time I
[1:23:07] hear Jesus say how can you quit
[1:23:08] something you never began boy
[1:23:11] because my Bible tells me he that began
[1:23:14] this good work I didn't begin it but he
[1:23:16] began it he will finish that work to the
[1:23:18] day of Jesus Christ
[1:23:21] but there is a section on This Book of
[1:23:22] Life of names that can be blotted out
[1:23:24] the mystery of the foolish virgin are
[1:23:27] the ones that their names remained on
[1:23:29] The Book of Life That's the ones that
[1:23:31] judgment that are called out and he says
[1:23:33] move depart to you know your workers
[1:23:36] iniquity go this way and that'd be the
[1:23:38] goat side he said then those entering
[1:23:40] the joys that's the Blessed that's him
[1:23:42] foolish version some of them been good
[1:23:43] that go on in at the second uh
[1:23:46] Resurrection at the white Throne
[1:23:47] judgment they're granted Eternal Light
[1:23:49] they're not heirs to it they didn't
[1:23:51] inherit it it was never their personal
[1:23:53] property God just gave it to him because
[1:23:56] of their Works in this life here
[1:23:58] God gave it to him greater than that the
[1:24:01] Bride of Jesus Christ never stands in
[1:24:04] the Judgment as a sinner
[1:24:07] amen because she's been redeemed by the
[1:24:09] blood of Jesus Christ
[1:24:11] she is Forgiven as though it never took
[1:24:13] place in the beginning
[1:24:15] Hallelujah amen it's one thing to be
[1:24:18] forgiven if I made a mark on this wall
[1:24:21] and I got me some kills and I got some
[1:24:23] color matching and I matched the paint
[1:24:25] and kills it over and then covered it
[1:24:27] over you may never see it but Demarcus
[1:24:29] still there
[1:24:30] in the Old Testament God would paint
[1:24:33] over their sins he covered it where he
[1:24:36] couldn't see it no more but the Mark was
[1:24:37] still there they went out with the same
[1:24:39] old desire that they walked in with but
[1:24:42] when Jesus shed his blood at Calvary for
[1:24:44] you and I and the life of God not the
[1:24:46] chemistry of the blood but the lateral
[1:24:48] life of Jesus Christ came back to the
[1:24:50] believer it was as though the mark never
[1:24:52] went on the wall in the first place
[1:24:55] glory to God and even greater than that
[1:24:58] it was it was it went so far back it
[1:25:01] went all the way back so deeply back
[1:25:02] that as though there was nothing to make
[1:25:04] a mark in the first place amen amen I
[1:25:07] didn't even have the ability to make the
[1:25:08] mark That's How far back God took us
[1:25:11] now there's a difference in that and a
[1:25:13] difference in somebody that's cut to a
[1:25:15] different different cloth or a different
[1:25:17] pattern a different way
[1:25:19] God though puts every single one of us
[1:25:22] on this same Foundation repent
[1:25:26] now I've just got through describing to
[1:25:28] you about eight or ten different end
[1:25:30] results
[1:25:31] but where do they start at
[1:25:34] it has the same effect when a foolish
[1:25:37] virgin is repenting
[1:25:38] as it does if a bride member is
[1:25:40] repenting
[1:25:41] same as it does that somebody even be
[1:25:43] what we'd say serpent seed or somebody
[1:25:45] that'd be Satan's child
[1:25:48] let the devil come and repent and God
[1:25:50] might forgive him
[1:25:52] on certain conditions he might forgive
[1:25:54] him if he would repent but you want to
[1:25:56] know one reason why that Satan ain't
[1:25:58] never made a move to do right he ain't
[1:26:00] never going to repent that's why
[1:26:03] I hope you understand what I'm saying to
[1:26:05] your church it doesn't matter where the
[1:26:07] end result is there's only one thing God
[1:26:10] ever acquired of us that's repent
[1:26:13] repent say you're sorry
[1:26:16] now after that God may take him this
[1:26:18] direction that direction this direction
[1:26:19] that direction that direction that's up
[1:26:21] to God where he wants to take us but we
[1:26:23] all start at the same Foundation of
[1:26:25] repentance he said repent and be
[1:26:27] baptized in the name of Jesus Christ
[1:26:29] now what was the difference in these
[1:26:31] ones that repent and this one like
[1:26:33] Nicodemus that's the one thing that he
[1:26:35] would not do
[1:26:37] the Pharisees refused to Humble
[1:26:40] themselves to Jesus New Testament
[1:26:43] Doctrine
[1:26:44] this is what he was bringing to him he
[1:26:46] said a new commandment bring I to you oh
[1:26:48] they'd sit around and say what it mean a
[1:26:50] new commandment who do you think you are
[1:26:52] Moses who are you one of these Prophets
[1:26:56] John told the story on that one
[1:26:59] he said oh he said let me tell you who
[1:27:01] he is not just a prophet but this is the
[1:27:04] Lamb of God to take away the sins of the
[1:27:06] world
[1:27:07] brother man said Not only was he a
[1:27:08] prophet but he was God of the prophets
[1:27:11] he was the prophet of prophets the king
[1:27:13] of kings
[1:27:14] absolutely right Jesus Christ was all at
[1:27:18] all he was the very head of the church
[1:27:20] said Paul
[1:27:21] amen and him being the head he was the
[1:27:24] one that had the mind of Christ when
[1:27:26] Paul said Philippians 2 let this mind
[1:27:28] that was in Christ Jesus also be in you
[1:27:30] the Lord Jesus had the mind of God 100
[1:27:35] not partially in all of it
[1:27:39] let me give you an example in the
[1:27:40] unveiling of God but Abraham uses a word
[1:27:43] called kinos
[1:27:45] k-e-n-o-s it's a Greek word
[1:27:47] and uses this word to describe how that
[1:27:50] God poured himself out of Heaven into
[1:27:52] Jesus Christ now kinos would be like
[1:27:55] I've got this bottle of oil here in my
[1:27:57] hand Keynotes would not be that I take
[1:27:59] this oil and pour it into another cup
[1:28:02] that's not kinos
[1:28:03] whatever you know something it would
[1:28:06] mean that the liquid the bottle the
[1:28:09] glass the lid the seal the paper all of
[1:28:13] it will go from one completely into the
[1:28:15] other
[1:28:16] that's kinos
[1:28:18] when God poured himself into Jesus
[1:28:20] Christ it wasn't just the oil that went
[1:28:23] into Jesus
[1:28:25] but in him dwelt the fullness of the
[1:28:27] godhead bodily cap seal oil bottle
[1:28:30] everything became Jesus Christ
[1:28:34] now then when Jesus is standing here
[1:28:35] talking to Nicodemus and he says You
[1:28:38] must be born again in other words you
[1:28:39] must receive the Holy Ghost
[1:28:41] well I reckon he knew what he was
[1:28:43] talking about because he was standing
[1:28:45] there a man baptized with the Holy Ghost
[1:28:49] he knew all the doctrine he knew what
[1:28:51] Moses said he knew what all them
[1:28:52] prophets said he was living on another
[1:28:54] level altogether
[1:28:56] and yet Nicodemus was sitting there
[1:28:58] under that intellectual thing
[1:29:00] they knew the word of God so well they
[1:29:02] could quote you every uh uh uh but but
[1:29:05] that Moses ever said when he was
[1:29:06] preaching
[1:29:07] they knew it so well they could quote
[1:29:10] volume chapter verse and in what color
[1:29:12] the book was
[1:29:14] but this is one thing that Jesus was
[1:29:16] trying to get him to understand there's
[1:29:18] a whole other level you can go to
[1:29:19] Nicodemus
[1:29:21] what you've got is okay like he told the
[1:29:23] Rich Young Ruler whatever you come to
[1:29:25] him he said you know the Commandments he
[1:29:26] said all these I've kept from the youth
[1:29:28] up I'm a message kid I was raised in the
[1:29:29] message you said
[1:29:31] and he was
[1:29:32] I done all of these things since I've
[1:29:34] been a youth and Jesus said but one
[1:29:36] thing you lack
[1:29:37] well I know we talk about that oh it was
[1:29:39] money and so that that was the material
[1:29:41] part but the real lacking in his heart
[1:29:44] was the fact he wouldn't repent
[1:29:47] you see repent means that you've got to
[1:29:50] give God control
[1:29:51] again let me say when you let man lead
[1:29:53] it it always ends up in disaster
[1:29:56] so the only way that we could ever come
[1:29:57] to the realities of Jesus Christ and
[1:30:00] what he is we've got to allow him to
[1:30:02] take full control of everything we do
[1:30:06] I hope you understand brother sister
[1:30:08] that a lot of times the reason people
[1:30:10] come so far in God sometimes they sit in
[1:30:13] churches for years you know uh uh like
[1:30:16] like down south from us a little bit
[1:30:18] Pastor for 30 years all of a sudden
[1:30:19] they're done we see these people spend
[1:30:22] all that time what happens they lose
[1:30:24] that repentant attitude
[1:30:26] they lose that attitude of being
[1:30:28] teachable and touchable they lose that
[1:30:31] attitude of being able to receive from
[1:30:33] God a new understanding to be changed to
[1:30:36] be corrected even and let me tell you
[1:30:37] when a man a woman gets to that spot
[1:30:39] they're in a bad place
[1:30:41] you can argue with them and I've done it
[1:30:43] you can fight with them and I've done
[1:30:45] that
[1:30:45] you can threaten them with bodily harm
[1:30:47] and I've done that too
[1:30:49] I remember one guy who was into it and
[1:30:51] he was really going at it and he said
[1:30:53] I'm getting out of here I said you head
[1:30:54] to that door I'm going to tackle you
[1:30:56] don't you leave me wrong in the middle
[1:30:59] you go through all these things and try
[1:31:01] to wrestle them like Jacob almost
[1:31:03] wrestling god try to hold him down but
[1:31:06] if they don't have a repentant attitude
[1:31:07] be it a man boy girl child preacher
[1:31:11] Deacon trustee you can't do nothing with
[1:31:13] them until they get that attitude back
[1:31:16] now let's look at a character in the Old
[1:31:18] Testament to prove this Saul and David
[1:31:20] the very difference between Saul and
[1:31:23] David was this one thing that I'm
[1:31:25] talking about this morning
[1:31:26] Saul arrived in a place to where he
[1:31:29] thought I'm king of the world I can
[1:31:31] control I can speak I've got money I've
[1:31:34] got power all I gotta do is say it and
[1:31:37] everybody will they'll they'll holler to
[1:31:39] what I say yes so yes yes yes whatever
[1:31:41] you want we'll do what you want us to do
[1:31:45] but there was one man in the Kingdom
[1:31:46] that wasn't absolutely going to put up
[1:31:48] with it his name was Samuel
[1:31:51] God told him through Samuel go down
[1:31:52] there and kill everything
[1:31:54] kill kill a guy kill the women kill the
[1:31:57] children kill the the the the cattle
[1:32:00] kill the kill and get out of it Saul
[1:32:02] said in his heart I'll do what I want to
[1:32:05] if I get down there and I think I can
[1:32:07] make a good business proposition play a
[1:32:09] little church politics I think it'd be
[1:32:10] good for my bottom line
[1:32:12] well I'll work it out the way I want to
[1:32:14] I'm King I'm anointed after all who is
[1:32:16] saying well he's the one that had the
[1:32:17] oil I'm the one he put it on
[1:32:21] Samuel come to him he said if he died
[1:32:23] that the Lord told you to do he said oh
[1:32:25] yeah yeah I've done it sure I've done it
[1:32:28] don't you see the difference
[1:32:29] change the picture just a moment Now
[1:32:31] find out when David got in trouble when
[1:32:33] Nathan come to him and said let me tell
[1:32:35] you a story about a man that done such
[1:32:36] David man is on the Pharaoh fly
[1:32:41] Nathan said Thou Art the man
[1:32:44] now look at the difference here's Saul
[1:32:46] standing here in front of Samuel and
[1:32:48] Samuel says done everything the Lord
[1:32:50] yeah I've done it what's the bleeding of
[1:32:52] this sheep I hear oh you see the people
[1:32:54] it's the people's fault I I tried to
[1:32:56] tell them I tried and amazing the man
[1:32:59] had a complete and total Authority until
[1:33:00] he got in trouble and that was the
[1:33:02] people's fault
[1:33:04] you're talking about people that he
[1:33:06] would threaten their life if they didn't
[1:33:07] obey him any other day of the week
[1:33:10] do what I say it's going to cost you
[1:33:12] your head or a night in jail or whatever
[1:33:14] but all of a sudden now when Samuel puts
[1:33:16] the rubber to the road all of a sudden
[1:33:18] now Saul has got an excuse why he can't
[1:33:20] do it
[1:33:21] but look at David look at the difference
[1:33:23] when Nathanael says to him without The
[1:33:25] Man David didn't say well you know
[1:33:28] that's a that's quite an accusation
[1:33:30] don't you know I could take your head
[1:33:32] from your shoulders for that thing
[1:33:34] come here guards take this man down put
[1:33:36] him in the dungeon what'd David do oh
[1:33:39] God
[1:33:40] Forgive Me Lord
[1:33:42] forgive me God I'm guilty
[1:33:45] you know one reason the prophet of God
[1:33:47] said that David was a man after God's
[1:33:49] Own Heart because he had a repentant
[1:33:51] Spirit about him
[1:33:53] oh Hallelujah
[1:33:54] but what Samuel say to Saul when he was
[1:33:57] left when you was
[1:34:01] when you saw yourself as being little
[1:34:03] when you was hiding around this stuff
[1:34:05] you depended on God but now you're a big
[1:34:07] king and you think you rule the world
[1:34:10] you're not little in your eyes no more
[1:34:12] Saul you see yourself as being a big
[1:34:14] shot y'all know what a big shot is don't
[1:34:17] you it's a it's a little shot far away
[1:34:18] from home
[1:34:21] laughs
[1:34:24] amen
[1:34:25] and here he stands there with this
[1:34:27] attitude on him
[1:34:29] Samuel takes a sword and kills a guy
[1:34:31] right there in front of his face what's
[1:34:33] the blaming of the sheep I hear
[1:34:35] somebody that God required for obedience
[1:34:39] is better than your sacrifices
[1:34:41] he even tried to turn it religious
[1:34:44] well I'm going to sacrifice these unto
[1:34:46] the Lord sure you was
[1:34:49] sure you was Saul I bet you had a I bet
[1:34:51] you had a sheep traitor just out on
[1:34:53] ready you had him on your speed dial get
[1:34:55] ready to make you some money at the end
[1:34:57] of the day
[1:34:59] but it was the one thing that David
[1:35:02] would do
[1:35:03] it was the one thing that Saul would not
[1:35:05] do
[1:35:07] he would not repent
[1:35:08] now hold on lady who sins I'm coming to
[1:35:10] your backyard in just a few moments
[1:35:13] but look at how the attitude changed
[1:35:15] look at David when you read him in the
[1:35:16] song my couch is wet with tears oh
[1:35:19] brother sister I want to ask you a
[1:35:20] question we have had ever experience
[1:35:22] when it comes to Doctrine we've had ever
[1:35:24] Supernatural Revelation when's the last
[1:35:26] time we've had that experience making
[1:35:28] our couch wet with tears crying out to
[1:35:30] God saying God forgive me help me Lord
[1:35:34] [Music]
[1:35:38] because we get bigger on site we get to
[1:35:40] think and we can run the place we can
[1:35:42] take the ball and we'll just run it how
[1:35:44] we want to run it
[1:35:45] one thing we have to understand brother
[1:35:48] Adam said about a pastor he said that if
[1:35:50] the pastor's got the ball for example he
[1:35:52] talked about like a football game he
[1:35:54] said we blocked for the man he said we
[1:35:56] don't strip the ball out of his hand and
[1:35:57] run it ourselves he said we block for
[1:35:59] him but listen in this game My Life
[1:36:00] brother sister Jesus is the one who's
[1:36:02] got the football
[1:36:05] Hallelujah somebody
[1:36:07] praise the Lord somebody we ought to
[1:36:09] take it out of his hand we allow hand
[1:36:12] nor how do we block for him that's the
[1:36:13] way the game of life is played
[1:36:16] who is a god amen amen amen
[1:36:19] that's the one thing that folks won't do
[1:36:22] I've kicked my leg this way
[1:36:24] I kick it that way
[1:36:27] I've tried to catch him in the odd ways
[1:36:29] if they're a stoic bunch I've tried to
[1:36:30] preach them in the clouds
[1:36:35] it's very clouds up but there's one
[1:36:36] thing that God requires only one thing
[1:36:39] Godly sorrow worketh repentance
[1:36:43] it's the one thing we need in our
[1:36:46] message today
[1:36:47] to bring Revival to the churches
[1:36:49] is a repentant attitude
[1:36:52] now listen let me explain it to you
[1:36:54] in this message today
[1:36:56] on this crazy little tablet I preach on
[1:37:00] I can hook up Wi-Fi
[1:37:02] I can sit down in a coffee shop
[1:37:04] but I said I didn't hit a button on the
[1:37:06] table down there I tell you everything
[1:37:08] brother said about the Rapture no matter
[1:37:10] about 10 seconds
[1:37:12] we've got Bibles on top of Bibles where
[1:37:15] I used to go to college that I used to
[1:37:16] cross the international headquarters of
[1:37:18] The Gideons almost every every week I'd
[1:37:20] cross that big headquarters up there and
[1:37:22] I thought there's the word of God being
[1:37:23] printed and presses back up here in that
[1:37:25] headquarters
[1:37:27] but 10 Bibles don't change your life the
[1:37:29] message don't change your life
[1:37:31] it's this attitude whether it'll change
[1:37:33] your life or not
[1:37:35] because you can have all of the message
[1:37:36] you can have all of the Bibles
[1:37:38] if you're not willing to do this one
[1:37:40] thing it won't do nothing
[1:37:42] amen that one thing is what brings us
[1:37:44] into this channel that one thing is what
[1:37:47] brings us into this atmosphere of
[1:37:49] understanding what this message is all
[1:37:50] about and what this Bible is all about
[1:37:52] forgive me but a man without that or a
[1:37:54] woman without that or a pastor without
[1:37:56] that or a deacon without that he's just
[1:37:59] flying by sexuals or she is
[1:38:02] they are walking by faith they're not
[1:38:04] walking in the spirit they're walking by
[1:38:06] their own arm of understanding
[1:38:08] and as I've said several times allow me
[1:38:10] to say it again when you lean to the arm
[1:38:12] of Flesh you will always lead you in the
[1:38:13] wrong direction
[1:38:15] because man is not permitted to know the
[1:38:17] ways of God Only God can take the reins
[1:38:20] there's only one thing that God ever
[1:38:22] asks look at Nicodemus again
[1:38:24] verse 9 watch him Nicodemus answered
[1:38:26] said unto them how can these things be
[1:38:29] Jesus answered and said unto him
[1:38:33] art thou a master of Israel
[1:38:35] and no it's not these things
[1:38:38] Jesus said you want to debate let's do
[1:38:40] her
[1:38:42] you want to fight I'm ready for the
[1:38:44] fight
[1:38:45] bring it boy I know what I'm standing
[1:38:47] the Bell Rings the boxing gloves come on
[1:38:52] but look at the difference scene when
[1:38:53] Jesus Is by The Well side in Saint John
[1:38:55] 4.
[1:38:57] when he's standing about the well side
[1:38:59] you don't hear no Bell you don't see no
[1:39:00] boxing gloves glory to God I feel like
[1:39:02] hollering
[1:39:04] oh God
[1:39:06] you don't see no rubs you don't see no
[1:39:08] referee
[1:39:09] there ain't no trainers in the corner
[1:39:11] Jesus is sitting on the well says to go
[1:39:13] get your husband look how easy he made
[1:39:15] it for
[1:39:16] why because she had a repented attitude
[1:39:19] he knew that she would receive his
[1:39:22] promised word of the day
[1:39:24] hey man we knew that there was something
[1:39:27] on the inside the prophet said them
[1:39:30] Pharisees were all white on the outside
[1:39:31] but dark on the inside but she was lying
[1:39:35] on the inside where she was dark on the
[1:39:37] outside
[1:39:39] amen she wasn't religious she didn't
[1:39:41] have a religious exterior but she had
[1:39:43] enough for opinion of attitude when
[1:39:45] Jesus said go get your husband you don't
[1:39:48] have one he said you said the truth
[1:39:49] don't worry
[1:39:51] go back here and find Nicodemus talking
[1:39:53] that way
[1:39:56] he said we know you're a ruler in Israel
[1:39:58] well you slimy hypocrite if you know it
[1:40:01] how come you didn't take a stand for him
[1:40:02] then
[1:40:04] if you're now that Jesus Christ is the
[1:40:06] same yesterday forever if you not that's
[1:40:08] why it is true if you've watched him
[1:40:10] heal watch him raise the dead watched
[1:40:13] him open Blind Eye watched him do all
[1:40:15] these great things tell me the Nicodemus
[1:40:17] why don't you make a public stand for it
[1:40:22] why because this one thing
[1:40:25] he wouldn't repent
[1:40:27] even though Jesus put him in the corner
[1:40:30] boxed him to The Knockout I don't know
[1:40:33] if it's a TKO or a 10 count but it was
[1:40:35] someone
[1:40:37] okay right to the Limit
[1:40:40] and Jesus said are you a master in
[1:40:42] Israel and you don't get this
[1:40:44] a friend you say
[1:40:46] what are you making so hard on him
[1:40:48] because Jesus knew his attitude
[1:40:50] listen to me children of God
[1:40:53] one reason sometimes God makes it hard
[1:40:55] on people
[1:40:56] is because he knows their attitude
[1:40:59] before he says a word to him
[1:41:02] you know what I Gage let me tell you
[1:41:04] what I Gage
[1:41:05] if I have a big meeting let's say this
[1:41:07] morning
[1:41:08] I get done preaching this I have an
[1:41:10] altar calling every single one of you
[1:41:11] pastors included me included for that
[1:41:13] matter just put me in there I could be
[1:41:15] fair Jesse
[1:41:16] Oliver down here screaming and crying
[1:41:18] and squalling by the end of this service
[1:41:19] I walk away I said Thank You Lord but
[1:41:21] ain't when I watch to see what's going
[1:41:22] on
[1:41:23] you know what I watch
[1:41:25] I watched six months after this meeting
[1:41:28] I watched down the road to see are they
[1:41:30] coming to church are they paying their
[1:41:31] tithes are they given their offerings
[1:41:32] are they reading their Bible are they
[1:41:33] saying uh forgiveness things to their
[1:41:35] brother and sister are they keeping
[1:41:36] bitterness out of their heart are they
[1:41:38] living right at home are they attending
[1:41:40] church regularly I watch to see is what
[1:41:42] they done up here is it really a
[1:41:44] repented attitude or was it a show
[1:41:47] hoping they could get God to kind of
[1:41:49] give them a pass from going to hell
[1:41:52] hello somebody
[1:41:54] yes sir brother you have to realize
[1:41:55] where we're coming at Hollywood
[1:41:58] evangelism
[1:42:00] you know what brother I'm called it that
[1:42:01] because what I just described to you is
[1:42:03] Hollywood evangelism
[1:42:06] it looks good on the internet forgive me
[1:42:08] I appreciate it I'm not against it it
[1:42:10] looks good on the internet when a
[1:42:11] preacher has a big meeting and the
[1:42:13] altar's full
[1:42:14] he can stand up here and he can jump and
[1:42:16] kick his leg Gloria God all of that's
[1:42:18] wonderful but brother where are they
[1:42:20] Landing after you've got them preached
[1:42:22] in the clouds
[1:42:24] Hollywood evangelism doesn't bring the
[1:42:27] people to Godly sorrow
[1:42:29] it works them up gets them into an
[1:42:31] emotional thing
[1:42:36] God sorrow is what works repentance
[1:42:38] not emotional if you just get emotional
[1:42:40] with me this morning because I'm
[1:42:41] emotional well then then all I did is
[1:42:44] work on your emotions and that's okay
[1:42:46] I don't mind making you emotional if I
[1:42:48] get emotional and you feel it and you
[1:42:49] get emotional too praise the Lord
[1:42:51] but when our feet touch the glass what
[1:42:54] is our attitude when we hit the ground
[1:42:58] you say well well certainly people are
[1:43:01] carrying on to order you should
[1:43:03] appreciate that what if one of them was
[1:43:04] named Esau
[1:43:06] because the Bible said he sought it with
[1:43:08] bitter tears and it wasn't found
[1:43:10] just because they can cry and Squall and
[1:43:12] carry on I've been to some of these
[1:43:14] places overseas and mine uh and I and I
[1:43:18] don't mean any remark against nobody
[1:43:20] when I say this just my own experiences
[1:43:21] I'm referring to I've been in places in
[1:43:24] Africa where some of them folks have
[1:43:25] come out of idol worship and when they
[1:43:27] was in idol worship they would scream
[1:43:29] and holler and dance and carry on to
[1:43:31] their idols and then when they crossed
[1:43:33] over the message they maintain the same
[1:43:34] type of behavior only for Jesus Christ
[1:43:37] that doesn't mean it's the Holy Ghost
[1:43:39] doing that sometimes it's just training
[1:43:43] oh God y'all get any quicker we're going
[1:43:45] to revert to the to the Presbyterians or
[1:43:47] something
[1:43:48] come on now preach with me
[1:43:50] sometimes it's just the humanistic side
[1:43:55] but if it's Godly sorrow
[1:43:57] it'll work repentance
[1:43:59] real evangelism isn't about kicking your
[1:44:01] leg this way or kicking leg that way
[1:44:03] Pastor in a church teaching the body
[1:44:05] being an apostle or a missionary being
[1:44:07] prophetic to the body has nothing to do
[1:44:10] with how deep you can get it's whether
[1:44:12] you can get the people to this attitude
[1:44:13] right here
[1:44:15] because if everything we do doesn't lead
[1:44:17] to this right here we're fighting a
[1:44:18] losing battle I don't care who you are
[1:44:21] because I could preach mysteries of God
[1:44:23] and I do I could preach deep things and
[1:44:26] I will this will do of God permit
[1:44:29] but if I'm dealing with a bunch of
[1:44:30] people that don't have a repentant
[1:44:31] spirit
[1:44:34] how is anything I'm going to say I'm
[1:44:35] going to get across to him
[1:44:37] right it can't
[1:44:39] it absolutely can't let me show you how
[1:44:41] deep this goes let's turn the Book of
[1:44:43] James real quick now I may have used
[1:44:45] this example
[1:44:47] in many many many other services and
[1:44:49] preaching different ways but this really
[1:44:52] stood out to me in this little message
[1:44:54] I'm bringing to you this morning and I'm
[1:44:56] watching the time we're getting down to
[1:44:58] a little while here in just a minute I
[1:45:00] know we got to go eat and come back at
[1:45:01] four so I'm going to save some of it for
[1:45:03] tonight
[1:45:04] amen now watch
[1:45:06] in James chapter one there's a whole
[1:45:09] build up if you will
[1:45:11] of James trying to balance us out on
[1:45:14] works now in the Book of Romans Paul is
[1:45:17] trying to establish this upon our faith
[1:45:19] it's our faith that save us and so forth
[1:45:21] like that but James in the Book of James
[1:45:23] is showing us our works paired with our
[1:45:26] faith he said if you want to say got
[1:45:27] faith all right I'll show you by my
[1:45:29] Works in that Bible and I would have
[1:45:31] said
[1:45:31] now when James is bringing what the real
[1:45:34] man is supposed to look like I'm talking
[1:45:36] about the Christian Godly Man James
[1:45:39] refers
[1:45:40] that this man he refers it to a model
[1:45:43] that would be modern day for them a
[1:45:45] modern day way of looking into a mirror
[1:45:47] okay now for these people
[1:45:50] looking into a mirror wasn't the same
[1:45:51] for us or as the same as us I mean to
[1:45:54] say
[1:45:55] in other words
[1:45:56] they might use brass they might use some
[1:45:59] kind of a an instrument you hear Paul
[1:46:00] say looking through a glass Darkly it's
[1:46:03] because it wasn't the type of glass like
[1:46:04] we got today so they might uh even in
[1:46:07] the Old Testament the women would take
[1:46:08] their looking glasses which was brass
[1:46:10] pieces and they would shape them and
[1:46:12] artify someone more for the making of
[1:46:14] the brass the labor and the uh the brass
[1:46:17] Ultra the Brazen altar all that stuff
[1:46:18] come from looking glasses or what we
[1:46:21] would say would be pieces of metal but
[1:46:24] now in James referring in verse 22 but
[1:46:26] be you doers of the word and not hear is
[1:46:28] only deceiving your own selves for If
[1:46:31] any man be a hearer of the word and not
[1:46:33] a doer he is like unto a man beholding
[1:46:36] his natural face in a glass
[1:46:40] for he beholdeth himself and goeth his
[1:46:42] way and straightway forgetth what manner
[1:46:46] of man that he was
[1:46:48] now when they looked into their mirrors
[1:46:52] or their glass
[1:46:53] we in our in our society today we've got
[1:46:56] them up here eye level everyone look
[1:46:59] I know that's true because every one of
[1:47:01] you got every hair if you got hair in
[1:47:02] place this morning every one of you
[1:47:05] why because our mirrors are always up
[1:47:07] like this our ties are straight sisters
[1:47:09] our dresses are just so so because we
[1:47:11] constantly look we know what we look
[1:47:12] like
[1:47:13] that's why some of y'all probably think
[1:47:14] you're you're either ugly or beautiful
[1:47:16] one or the other depends on what you see
[1:47:17] when you see it right
[1:47:19] because you're always constantly looking
[1:47:21] in my mirror you know even uh say that
[1:47:24] there's a picture on the wall let's say
[1:47:26] uh right here the Hoffman's head of
[1:47:28] Christ you look at it maybe from sisters
[1:47:29] angle or brothers angle right here look
[1:47:31] up in a certain direction they'll see a
[1:47:33] reflection of something
[1:47:37] you close to it I can see my reflection
[1:47:39] in that glass everything's at eye level
[1:47:42] but in this time period that James is
[1:47:44] referring to
[1:47:46] they didn't have things at that level
[1:47:48] they set the glass on the ground
[1:47:51] so in order for the man to see himself
[1:47:54] he had to stoop down to get down there
[1:47:58] he had to get down to a place of
[1:48:01] humility
[1:48:02] in order to see his own reflection
[1:48:05] he didn't have it at eye level like we
[1:48:07] do he had to get down like this
[1:48:09] in order to see himself the right way
[1:48:12] and this is where James said this is the
[1:48:14] reason he forgets what man or man he is
[1:48:16] because looks into that mirror he stands
[1:48:19] back up
[1:48:20] well he you don't have it here he has it
[1:48:22] here so he forgets
[1:48:25] what
[1:48:26] how did that go again he has to get
[1:48:28] right back down again oh glory to God
[1:48:32] what a perfect type
[1:48:34] of the real Christian of
[1:48:37] a Christian man or Christian woman
[1:48:39] as a Son of God Amen they are looking at
[1:48:42] a high level
[1:48:44] because we don't put ourselves on the
[1:48:45] same level as God
[1:48:49] but in order to see him right
[1:48:52] we got a stoop
[1:48:54] we got to get down
[1:48:56] it's one reason why we bow our heads
[1:48:58] when we pray
[1:48:59] you realize that one reason we bow our
[1:49:02] heads when we pray is we are showing
[1:49:04] humility
[1:49:05] to the one who created us
[1:49:08] glory to God hallelujah
[1:49:11] we are showing our life of surrender
[1:49:13] Glory
[1:49:15] by powering our head over and saying
[1:49:17] Lord Jesus
[1:49:21] so when this man looked into the mirror
[1:49:24] in order for him to see his true
[1:49:26] reflection as a godly man that is
[1:49:29] he had to stoop
[1:49:32] now you know why some people will never
[1:49:34] see themselves in the word right
[1:49:37] because they're not willing
[1:49:39] stoop yes sir
[1:49:43] you know how it goes in churches
[1:49:46] he looked right at me when he said that
[1:49:51] at a small Church like this I'm sure he
[1:49:54] will
[1:49:57] I I don't mean small and derogatory
[1:50:00] senses
[1:50:01] but I mean we at eye level
[1:50:06] he said we'll have glory to God
[1:50:08] brother Jesse just knew about my
[1:50:10] circumstance brother Jesse just knew
[1:50:12] about my that's the reason he said that
[1:50:14] what's the difference does that make
[1:50:17] whether you know it or you don't know it
[1:50:19] when you feel led to the Holy Ghost to
[1:50:20] say something you got to say something
[1:50:22] just in case you don't know you ain't
[1:50:24] the only one in this church building
[1:50:25] every Sunday and Wednesday and whenever
[1:50:26] you have church
[1:50:29] sometimes one example can be not for
[1:50:31] just you but could be for other members
[1:50:33] of the body
[1:50:34] but people got chips on their shoulder
[1:50:36] glory to God
[1:50:38] Hallelujah that Pastor don't he know he
[1:50:42] ought to leave me alone when he's
[1:50:44] preaching maybe maybe God's the one
[1:50:46] bugging you maybe it ain't the pastor
[1:50:49] because I'll tell you something right
[1:50:50] now brother sister sometimes the pastor
[1:50:52] don't always know who he bugging
[1:50:55] Glory come on now
[1:50:58] they're not infallible people they don't
[1:51:00] know everything that goes on
[1:51:02] and when people go through circumstances
[1:51:04] it's hard not to say things that relate
[1:51:06] or sound like
[1:51:07] seems like
[1:51:09] but you know what when you're preaching
[1:51:10] the gospel you just got to preach it
[1:51:13] the people of their attitudes glory to
[1:51:15] God
[1:51:19] and they wonder why they never get any
[1:51:22] further in God than where they're at
[1:51:24] to lacking or repenting that what would
[1:51:26] be the difference if you'd stop and say
[1:51:28] hell yeah maybe maybe brother Jesse or
[1:51:30] brother Ben or whoever maybe them
[1:51:32] brothers maybe maybe brother cam maybe
[1:51:34] brother cam up here and preached some
[1:51:35] well God maybe brother cam maybe he did
[1:51:37] know about that thing but you know what
[1:51:39] he's a spirit-led man and God was
[1:51:41] leading him and I'm trusting that was
[1:51:42] for our benefit somewhere another
[1:51:45] which one you all think God appreciates
[1:51:46] better
[1:51:49] he appreciates the one that has the
[1:51:51] repentant attitude
[1:51:53] now I I'm not reading these a lot of
[1:51:55] these things word by word on purpose
[1:51:57] because we'd be here all morning and I I
[1:51:59] like to read I like to read the Bible
[1:52:01] but I want to refer to you just a
[1:52:03] scripture here before we close
[1:52:06] and we'll go a little bit further into
[1:52:08] other things tonight but just right here
[1:52:10] where we're at I just want to bring us
[1:52:11] to this place in the temple Jesus of
[1:52:15] course gives this parable about this
[1:52:17] event and he says here that two of them
[1:52:20] went down to the temple to pray
[1:52:22] and he said the one standing there at
[1:52:24] the temple he was a Pharisee
[1:52:26] the other one he's just no publican
[1:52:32] he didn't get his name called in the
[1:52:33] market
[1:52:34] he didn't have his phylactus on his head
[1:52:36] and his arm he didn't have his long
[1:52:37] borders and his long dresses and when
[1:52:39] when he uh what I call dresses they're
[1:52:42] robes over into their dresses but anyhow
[1:52:46] the public can walk down through the
[1:52:48] synagogue or down on the streets of the
[1:52:50] synagogue or wherever it might be people
[1:52:52] will say well hello that Pharisee hi
[1:52:54] there sir honor Reverend hi there doctor
[1:52:58] when he walked by him and said oh God
[1:53:00] does he have to walk so close to me
[1:53:04] he stinks
[1:53:08] ain't bathed in a month
[1:53:12] oh God
[1:53:14] oh when Mr Pharisee walked down oh hello
[1:53:16] Reverend oh can I get you anything going
[1:53:18] to get you a cup of coffee can I help
[1:53:20] carry your Bible there can I uh what can
[1:53:22] I do for you sir uh Reverend sir
[1:53:25] Jesus Takes these two men
[1:53:28] and he places them in the temple lower
[1:53:30] to God
[1:53:32] and it shows how the Republican gets
[1:53:35] down and beats on his chest
[1:53:37] ah mercy on me I'm a sinner
[1:53:42] and then Here Comes Mr Reverend Dr
[1:53:44] Pharisee high and mighty
[1:53:47] thank you Lord creator of heavens and
[1:53:50] earth
[1:53:51] great omnipotent God who By the Waters
[1:53:54] for our fathers
[1:53:58] and by the way thank you for not making
[1:53:59] me like this scumbag over here
[1:54:03] Jesus said which one you would think
[1:54:05] walked away Justified
[1:54:09] it wasn't a Pharisee
[1:54:10] uh amen it was this guy down here
[1:54:14] saying God have mercy on me as soon
[1:54:17] let me tell you something children I
[1:54:19] don't care how deep in this message you
[1:54:20] get how much you learn or how much you
[1:54:22] know you ever lose that attitude right
[1:54:24] there you're gone I don't care who you
[1:54:26] are
[1:54:27] you're gone
[1:54:29] and there's no way back until you come
[1:54:31] back to that attitude right there
[1:54:34] I'm gonna shock you for a minute
[1:54:36] I don't mean this correctively but I
[1:54:38] want you kitties listen this real good
[1:54:40] remember this is a good little nugget
[1:54:42] Sunday school nugget okay
[1:54:44] Jezebel was a good woman
[1:54:48] y'all see them eyes going like that
[1:54:51] she was
[1:54:53] brother Branham said
[1:54:55] she was a good woman in the beginning
[1:54:58] but it was as she developed
[1:55:01] she turned into what we know today
[1:55:04] as Jezebel
[1:55:06] Nebuchadnezzar
[1:55:08] was a good man
[1:55:10] tell it was fam had a tender heart
[1:55:13] before God
[1:55:15] but his heart became hardened
[1:55:19] ready for another one
[1:55:21] Hezekiah
[1:55:23] when he turned his face to the wall and
[1:55:25] told God to let him live the prophet
[1:55:27] said the reason he'd done that is
[1:55:28] because he had more work to do for God
[1:55:31] and didn't want to die then because he
[1:55:34] had more Idols to bust more Groves to
[1:55:36] burn down and more things to do for the
[1:55:37] kingdom of God he had a Godly objective
[1:55:41] but when God said it's however he
[1:55:43] changed his attitude toward God and said
[1:55:45] oh God no it ain't over yet because I
[1:55:46] got more stuff I got to do
[1:55:48] but who's the one carrying the football
[1:55:49] Hezekiah
[1:55:52] and you know what he created more
[1:55:54] trouble in the last 11 years of his life
[1:55:56] and what he would if he would have just
[1:55:57] went on
[1:55:59] because the god that raised up Hezekiah
[1:56:01] is a God that could have raised up
[1:56:02] another Hezekiah
[1:56:03] mightier than him
[1:56:05] oh shall we see example examples of it
[1:56:07] down through the scripture
[1:56:09] all right I'm going to give you another
[1:56:10] example
[1:56:11] somebody that was tender before the Lord
[1:56:13] the Heathen King
[1:56:16] that Abraham lies to
[1:56:20] God he said you're good as a dead man
[1:56:25] but Lord didn't he tell then he'd tell
[1:56:28] me that was his sister Lord you know the
[1:56:31] Integrity of my heart
[1:56:34] a heathen
[1:56:36] and you can't get some of these backslid
[1:56:38] message people even say Amen in church
[1:56:40] much less than anything like that
[1:56:43] I don't mean you all I mean the attitude
[1:56:45] of people against the last day move of
[1:56:46] God real holy ghost moving in Pentecost
[1:56:49] they just sit there like a duck on a
[1:56:51] river they only look at it as being
[1:56:52] anything spiritual
[1:56:54] come on somebody
[1:56:57] but this Heathen King
[1:56:59] Glory
[1:57:00] he had such a repentant heart
[1:57:03] God said I know the Integrity of your
[1:57:06] heart that's why I didn't permit you to
[1:57:07] sin against me
[1:57:10] glory to God
[1:57:12] he said as a matter of fact I'm going to
[1:57:13] make a way for you go back to my Prophet
[1:57:15] let him pray for you because when you go
[1:57:18] tell him what I've revealed to you he's
[1:57:19] got some repentance to do on the same
[1:57:21] token
[1:57:29] and when Abram got caught what'd he say
[1:57:31] oh Lord I mean
[1:57:34] he said you're right Lord
[1:57:37] you see the difference between a lot of
[1:57:39] people brother
[1:57:40] it comes down to this attitude we're
[1:57:42] talking about right here
[1:57:44] forgive me for this
[1:57:46] but uh some years ago it's been five or
[1:57:49] six years now on this believed the sign
[1:57:50] thing hit the message
[1:57:52] seek ye the truth and all this stuff
[1:57:54] that come up I'll try to be nice when I
[1:57:56] say this even though I don't feel so
[1:57:58] nice about it
[1:57:59] but all these things come up you realize
[1:58:01] what was happening
[1:58:03] it was the devil seeking out people who
[1:58:06] had been walking the fence all these
[1:58:08] years
[1:58:09] and he just give them an excuse or a
[1:58:11] reason to tip over the fence
[1:58:14] and to choose what side that they've
[1:58:16] been leaning either way listen the only
[1:58:18] way they can fall back toward God is
[1:58:20] they've got to have a repentant attitude
[1:58:22] so he gives him an out
[1:58:24] God will give them an excuse
[1:58:27] if they want one
[1:58:29] remember what he said about those that
[1:58:30] put their hand to the plow and then turn
[1:58:32] around said they're not even Worthy
[1:58:34] he said if they once they make the
[1:58:36] decision they got to stick with it all
[1:58:37] the way you can't walk the line
[1:58:42] you understand what's happening the
[1:58:44] reason things are thinning out like the
[1:58:46] all around the ranks the reason why
[1:58:48] at this church this morning I told
[1:58:50] brother Jesse last night I suggested you
[1:58:52] could have a big church I mean you got a
[1:58:53] big sweet group here now Lord have mercy
[1:58:55] come a long way from that four or five
[1:58:57] we started with in the beginning and
[1:58:59] beginning
[1:59:02] God's bless this little body
[1:59:04] why you got a good pastor he loves God
[1:59:07] I'm jealous of him in a way I come in
[1:59:10] here he's down on his face before God
[1:59:12] crying out and all of his young ones
[1:59:13] around him I thought oh God that's kind
[1:59:15] of man I want to be
[1:59:17] I want that I want to see my girls in
[1:59:19] that I want to see our families in the
[1:59:22] message I like to see all of them with
[1:59:24] that kind of spirit about him
[1:59:26] he said but I don't know if I agree with
[1:59:28] all of his Doctrine but you better have
[1:59:29] the same attitude as God or else it
[1:59:32] won't matter to end What doctrine is all
[1:59:34] about
[1:59:36] what disagree You can disagree but if
[1:59:38] you don't have that kind of attitude
[1:59:41] it isn't going to matter whether you
[1:59:42] agree or disagree at the end of the day
[1:59:44] because God ain't looking to see if
[1:59:46] you've got all of your little eyes
[1:59:48] dotted and T's crossed
[1:59:50] I told Jesse Esther I said
[1:59:52] it was his birthday by the way happy
[1:59:54] birthday to you happy birthday to you
[1:59:57] and you don't look no older he gets
[1:59:59] better looking with age
[2:00:01] me I get balder
[2:00:06] but I
[2:00:07] I told him I said you could have a big
[2:00:09] church if you want it all you got to do
[2:00:11] is lay a few empty hands on some empty
[2:00:13] heads call a few women to preach
[2:00:15] drop your standard
[2:00:17] I said before nightfall you'd have a
[2:00:19] church of 400 sitting in here just glory
[2:00:21] to God hallelujah praise the Lord
[2:00:23] but at the end of the day what kind of
[2:00:25] people do you have
[2:00:26] people that if you really present truth
[2:00:28] to them they won't listen to it
[2:00:31] no matter what you should tell them
[2:00:34] God ain't looking for the type of person
[2:00:36] that has everything right
[2:00:40] understand as men our intellectual brain
[2:00:43] can work against us
[2:00:45] we're smart people in this life it's day
[2:00:47] and age they don't think we're smart
[2:00:49] look at us we can shoot a rocket to the
[2:00:51] moon can't get it back sometimes when we
[2:00:52] can shoot her up
[2:00:56] we're actually it's an intellectual day
[2:00:59] yes sir all my science progressed to the
[2:01:02] place we progressed
[2:01:04] we got a stupid telephone in our hand
[2:01:06] that can do everything and yet ain't got
[2:01:08] enough brains to turn it off and set it
[2:01:10] down and talk to your families that
[2:01:11] suffer we smart people
[2:01:15] you understand what I mean
[2:01:17] there's a need that might be one thing
[2:01:18] you know we sometimes we text and things
[2:01:20] and we got to do it but I'm talking
[2:01:21] about some people are glued to that
[2:01:23] thing you know what I'm talking about
[2:01:25] they've almost forgotten the art of
[2:01:27] human interaction because they don't
[2:01:28] interact no more is everybody on
[2:01:29] Facebook and Twitter and all these other
[2:01:31] places
[2:01:32] right
[2:01:34] we're such a smart educated people that
[2:01:36] we know how to do everything
[2:01:39] but when it comes to serving God brother
[2:01:42] you can't use not one intellectual mind
[2:01:45] it's not whether or not I can figure the
[2:01:47] seals out figure the Thunders out figure
[2:01:48] the godhead out figure water baptism out
[2:01:51] if that's the route you take
[2:01:54] you're missing the one thing
[2:01:56] that God's ever asked of us
[2:01:58] let me say my brother Ben God asks us to
[2:02:00] be holy God all of that's true but
[2:02:02] that's after this one thing
[2:02:07] living holy ain't gonna do you no good
[2:02:10] if you don't repent
[2:02:13] all right
[2:02:15] Paul said though I have ah streets of
[2:02:17] God get my body to be burned
[2:02:20] yet without love and how could you ever
[2:02:22] receive that love unless you're willing
[2:02:24] to rip in
[2:02:25] now Revelation chapter 3.
[2:02:28] Revelation chapter three I told you I
[2:02:30] was going to get this lady who sins in
[2:02:31] here before this is over let's get there
[2:02:34] revelation 3.
[2:02:36] just love the Bible don't you
[2:02:41] now watch this last stage
[2:02:43] I pick him up here in this third chapter
[2:02:45] verse 14 under the angel of the church
[2:02:47] the latest thing to write
[2:02:49] he knows her works
[2:02:52] because I'll say us I'm rich in Greece
[2:02:54] with Goods skipping down here now 17.
[2:02:57] picking up A.T a council buying me gold
[2:02:59] Trident of Fire
[2:03:01] he says anoint thy eyes
[2:03:04] with eyes have that thou mayest see now
[2:03:07] watch this next verse
[2:03:09] I hear
[2:03:10] is the spirit
[2:03:12] of a real Christian in lady Lucia as
[2:03:15] many as I love
[2:03:17] I rebuke and chasten
[2:03:19] be zealous
[2:03:21] in other words don't wait around for the
[2:03:23] right opportunity
[2:03:24] don't wait for the cards to line up or
[2:03:26] for the things to stack up or the things
[2:03:28] get in a row and how people talk
[2:03:32] waiting for such and such no no don't
[2:03:35] wait till the Ducks get in the Rope
[2:03:38] be zalius
[2:03:40] the moment God moves on you
[2:03:43] repent
[2:03:46] you hear Brothers prayer lines whenever
[2:03:47] he's getting ready to call on the
[2:03:48] discernment the Holy Spirit be over
[2:03:50] somebody maybe the brother there and
[2:03:51] he'd say oh oh he's going to miss it
[2:03:53] he's going to miss it maybe that sister
[2:03:55] oh she's going to miss it she's going to
[2:03:56] miss it
[2:03:57] he said see answer quickly when the Holy
[2:04:00] Spirit starts moving
[2:04:02] this is what Jesus said here
[2:04:04] be zealous therefore and what learn
[2:04:08] Mysteries become more deep more
[2:04:09] intellectual put the Thunders together
[2:04:11] but to God had to get listen all that's
[2:04:13] wonderful but if you miss this none of
[2:04:16] that will mean anything to you
[2:04:19] because this right here is the main
[2:04:20] thing amen
[2:04:21] amen repent
[2:04:23] they were Rich they were increased so
[2:04:26] good they had need of nothing
[2:04:29] and God's telling them
[2:04:32] repent
[2:04:33] very next verses you know what he's
[2:04:35] talking about
[2:04:36] behold I stand at the door and knock
[2:04:39] you know why they were standing at the
[2:04:41] door of his church and knocking
[2:04:43] because they wouldn't do verse 19.
[2:04:46] they would not repent
[2:04:48] therefore they put Jesus Christ out of
[2:04:50] the church world
[2:04:53] they put him out of the church put him
[2:04:55] out of there choirs put out their music
[2:04:58] put him out of their preaching
[2:05:03] when he said in the in the series was
[2:05:05] preaching their Tabernacle we talked
[2:05:06] about the lady was seeing time that
[2:05:08] little girl with her hair balled up on
[2:05:09] her back preacher said God's children
[2:05:11] must be excellent wonderful she said
[2:05:12] amen glory to God that's right and
[2:05:14] everybody crane their neck around look
[2:05:15] at her before long they told her to
[2:05:17] quiet down them before that or after
[2:05:19] that rather they asked her to leave and
[2:05:21] he screamed out and said your dad and
[2:05:23] you don't even know it why because they
[2:05:25] would not repent
[2:05:29] they wouldn't repent of their
[2:05:30] intellectualism they wouldn't repent of
[2:05:32] their formal ways they wouldn't repent
[2:05:35] of their denominational ideas and
[2:05:37] standings
[2:05:38] and it put Jesus on the outside
[2:05:41] listen to me message children
[2:05:44] if we're not careful
[2:05:46] we'll do the same things
[2:05:48] that the lady of seeing Bunch has done
[2:05:50] the Pentecostal bunch
[2:05:52] the same thing they'd done to Jesus
[2:05:54] Christ
[2:05:55] when he comes down a mighty angel with a
[2:05:57] book open in his hand he comes down sets
[2:05:59] his foot on the land sets his foot on
[2:06:00] the sea
[2:06:01] one foot here one foot here
[2:06:04] if there's time is no longer in other
[2:06:06] words these denominational ages has run
[2:06:08] out
[2:06:09] not the Methodist not the Presbyterian
[2:06:12] not the Baptist not the Church of God
[2:06:13] not Pilgrim Holiness not Luther not none
[2:06:16] of them
[2:06:17] will never have a chance
[2:06:18] to do verse 19 ever again
[2:06:21] and what I receive them as long as
[2:06:23] they're out there in that organized
[2:06:24] system cut out of her my people
[2:06:27] yes that doesn't mean they can't repent
[2:06:29] from there and then come on but as long
[2:06:32] as they follow that attitude
[2:06:34] that was fostered in those environments
[2:06:36] as long as they follow the
[2:06:37] denominational Creeds and doxology
[2:06:39] whoever heard of Peter stand up on the
[2:06:41] day of Pentecost so let's let's say
[2:06:44] together now the Apostles Creed
[2:06:47] that church back home I was telling you
[2:06:48] about Jesse I was at a funeral one time
[2:06:52] and somebody had died it was a sinner
[2:06:54] man that had died I guess this man or
[2:06:56] woman or who it was and we went there
[2:06:58] out of respect for the family that was
[2:06:59] gathered there and found me from the
[2:07:01] local church there
[2:07:02] and this I guess he was a Lutheran
[2:07:04] remember who he was he stood up and he
[2:07:06] said now we will recite the Apostles
[2:07:09] Creed
[2:07:11] and I looked around and there's some of
[2:07:12] our own message people standing up there
[2:07:14] reciting it with him oh God
[2:07:17] I just sat down I thought y'all they may
[2:07:19] get mad at me but if they want me to
[2:07:21] recite the Apostles Creed I'll read to
[2:07:22] him Acts chapter 2 verse 38.
[2:07:25] because that was their that was their
[2:07:27] Creed
[2:07:29] a lot of you and be baptized in the name
[2:07:31] of Jesus Christ
[2:07:33] for their mission to say that you shall
[2:07:34] receive the gift of the Holy Ghost
[2:07:37] but it's the attitude
[2:07:40] oh we don't want to offend anybody we
[2:07:42] don't want to hurt anybody we don't want
[2:07:43] to
[2:07:44] sure but compromise your standard
[2:07:47] and put Jesus on the outside of the
[2:07:49] church
[2:07:50] well we don't want to cause separation
[2:07:52] sometimes the word of God causes
[2:07:54] separation
[2:07:56] and if the word is doing it that's
[2:07:57] entirely all right
[2:08:00] if I'm the one doing it that might be a
[2:08:02] different thing but if the word's doing
[2:08:03] it then so be it
[2:08:05] because God separated the light from the
[2:08:07] darkness for a reason
[2:08:09] yes but the world put him out you think
[2:08:11] we're not too far behind this
[2:08:14] you think we're coming to a time look
[2:08:16] around
[2:08:17] pay attention what's going on even in
[2:08:19] your own local area
[2:08:21] you say well I don't get out much sure
[2:08:23] but look around your own local church
[2:08:24] look around around the rest of the body
[2:08:26] look at what you hear trickling in
[2:08:28] coming from the outside look at the
[2:08:30] condition of your city
[2:08:32] we're right for judgment why
[2:08:35] not because this city of Akron and these
[2:08:37] other places and Loki and these other
[2:08:39] spots around it not not because they
[2:08:41] don't know the seals or don't know
[2:08:42] brother Bam's message that ain't the
[2:08:44] reason we're right for judgment
[2:08:46] right for judgment because of one reason
[2:08:49] you've got a city and a nation full of
[2:08:51] people that won't repent
[2:08:52] right you could put a Billy Graham on
[2:08:55] every street cornica but oral Robertson
[2:08:56] every Pulpit could put a William Branham
[2:08:58] in every Church
[2:08:59] and they won't repent
[2:09:02] at one time America had a good heart
[2:09:05] but at the end of 1956 ushering in 1957
[2:09:09] by the time it hit Jan 1 1957 the
[2:09:12] prophet of God wrote it in the church
[2:09:13] age book she's done she's over she'll
[2:09:16] never come back why
[2:09:18] not think of it 1957 was quite a ways
[2:09:22] before brother Branham really started
[2:09:23] digging into Doctrine
[2:09:26] they came out of church
[2:09:28] it wasn't until 1958 he starts preaching
[2:09:30] things like the unity of one God and one
[2:09:32] church 1959. he starts bringing to us uh
[2:09:36] uh why we're not a denomination why I'm
[2:09:37] against organized religion 57 he brought
[2:09:39] Christianity versus idolatry
[2:09:43] they came 1960 brings us Daniel 70 weeks
[2:09:45] the serpent seed
[2:09:48] he starts building on those thoughts
[2:09:51] 1962 building building come to 63 the
[2:09:54] opening of the seals
[2:09:55] God was done with that denominational
[2:09:57] bunch
[2:09:58] he was done with this Bunch called
[2:09:59] Americans they shut the door on him
[2:10:02] because they wouldn't repent
[2:10:04] and it amazing that the very precursor
[2:10:06] to the opening of the word was a
[2:10:09] Ministry of healing and repentance
[2:10:11] around the world
[2:10:14] God was looking for a bride that be
[2:10:16] willing to do this
[2:10:19] you know the ones that entered on into
[2:10:21] the truth of it the ones that was
[2:10:22] willing to repent
[2:10:25] the ones that was willing to change who
[2:10:26] they were to follow the fresh message of
[2:10:28] the day
[2:10:31] all right one last thing we're going to
[2:10:33] stand
[2:10:34] this in Acts chapter 2 verse 38 was the
[2:10:37] first message to the New Testament
[2:10:39] Church it's the first one and it's the
[2:10:42] last one and it still hasn't changed in
[2:10:45] between
[2:10:46] repent repent repent
[2:10:50] that's the message of God to all of us
[2:10:53] get right with God
[2:10:55] I think I told you last time I was here
[2:10:57] take your experience and put it a
[2:10:59] hundred years ago
[2:11:01] you may not think you're a Powerhouse
[2:11:03] but take the same Holy Ghost experience
[2:11:05] you got it'd start a Welsh Revival
[2:11:07] same prayer life that you got today it
[2:11:10] would spark a a healing campaign
[2:11:13] same Bible studies that we have in this
[2:11:15] day and age the Lord they'd start a
[2:11:17] worldwide Ministry overnight if we was
[2:11:20] living a hundred years ago 200 years ago
[2:11:22] back in that anointing when them things
[2:11:24] were moving like that why aren't people
[2:11:26] moving like that today
[2:11:29] because they won't repent at the
[2:11:32] preaching of the Gospel I said one thing
[2:11:34] I mean two things I just thought of
[2:11:36] another
[2:11:36] Jesus went down and preached to the
[2:11:38] souls in prison who was the ones he was
[2:11:40] preaching to message people
[2:11:43] in general but message people
[2:11:46] as you would say the people here in the
[2:11:48] message of the hour that would not
[2:11:51] repent at the preaching
[2:11:56] wonderful this is what God requires one
[2:12:01] thing that's all he ever asked us to do
[2:12:03] well so then after that one thing what
[2:12:05] am I supposed to do let him carry the
[2:12:06] football
[2:12:09] on everything I don't care about your
[2:12:11] money be your house your homes your
[2:12:12] lands your family your health
[2:12:15] let him pack the ball
[2:12:18] stand with me
[2:12:23] thank you Jesus
[2:12:26] I got everything done in an hour and 40
[2:12:28] minutes I'm so proud of myself today
[2:12:33] amen
[2:12:35] you figure our preaching 15 minutes of
[2:12:38] talking 10 minutes of saying I ain't too
[2:12:40] bad for a day's work isn't Jesse
[2:12:42] amen
[2:12:46] you know friends
[2:12:48] the one thing that I pray
[2:12:51] I I know compared to somebody in here I
[2:12:54] I'm this may sound silly to you
[2:12:58] but being on the other side of 40 now
[2:13:01] a little bit of a change in me
[2:13:03] I think if that thing's a little
[2:13:05] different
[2:13:06] things a little different
[2:13:08] and I pray this all the time God
[2:13:11] I've studied this word since I've been a
[2:13:13] little boy
[2:13:14] there's scriptures laying in this Bible
[2:13:16] like according verbatim for hours at a
[2:13:18] time
[2:13:19] never even peel back a scripture
[2:13:22] things I could quote in a message I
[2:13:23] could tell you what side of the page
[2:13:25] you're on on whether it's the old book
[2:13:26] or the new book and how many butts he
[2:13:29] said
[2:13:30] I said God
[2:13:32] what if I come to the road like my daddy
[2:13:34] did he had dementia Alzheimer's he
[2:13:36] couldn't even hardly remember where he
[2:13:37] was at half the time
[2:13:39] a month before he died he was sitting in
[2:13:41] my house in Tennessee and he stood up in
[2:13:43] my room I have up and my oldest
[2:13:45] daughter's Elizabeth room and he stood
[2:13:47] up hello Walker with him and he pulled
[2:13:49] over the door and he got right up close
[2:13:50] to my face he said Benny where am I at I
[2:13:52] just can't seem to find my room I said
[2:13:54] Daddy you're with me in Tennessee
[2:13:56] oh he said but my room's around here
[2:13:58] somewhere isn't it and I thought God
[2:14:01] I may come to a spot like my dad where I
[2:14:03] may not be able to remember where I'm at
[2:14:06] but always let me have Lord
[2:14:09] that repentant type spirit
[2:14:12] and anytime you want to deal with me or
[2:14:13] anything that you want to talk to me
[2:14:15] about
[2:14:16] I got that kind of hard to say God I
[2:14:17] want to hear you
[2:14:19] I want to hear what you got to say
[2:14:21] because you realize that's the only
[2:14:23] thing God has ever required of us
[2:14:25] one thing
[2:14:27] happens to be the one thing that people
[2:14:29] just won't do anymore
[2:14:31] but God help me
[2:14:33] help me be a David not a soul
[2:14:35] help me be like the thief on the cross
[2:14:39] you know there were two of them there
[2:14:41] the one standing and looking and said
[2:14:44] why don't you just speak the word and
[2:14:46] get off that cross you who you say you
[2:14:48] are
[2:14:49] Jesus didn't even answer if you don't
[2:14:51] even find him having a conversation with
[2:14:52] him but then the other fellow looked at
[2:14:54] him and said Lord when you come to your
[2:14:55] Paradise remember me
[2:14:57] sure it was a deathbed repentance but
[2:15:00] still it was a repentance
[2:15:04] that's the only one thing
[2:15:06] and what Jesus say to him this day
[2:15:09] you'll be in Paradise With Me
[2:15:11] even prophesied today was going to die
[2:15:13] how Jesus know they kept him alive for
[2:15:15] five or six days but there he is hanging
[2:15:16] on the cross a sinner himself
[2:15:19] George Jesus didn't die God he died of
[2:15:20] Sinner
[2:15:22] sure did he had to
[2:15:25] it couldn't have been the propitiation
[2:15:27] for my sins and went to the Cross as God
[2:15:30] he went as a sinner
[2:15:32] he became a sinner for me
[2:15:34] that I could become the righteousness of
[2:15:36] God
[2:15:37] they tell me that when brother Brown
[2:15:39] went and saw the movie The Robe
[2:15:42] or no it's been her one of them I think
[2:15:44] it was is that one spot where Jesus
[2:15:46] woken up to calvary's Hill
[2:15:48] it stops and does a few things
[2:15:50] Supernatural in the movie brother was
[2:15:53] standing they said outside the movie
[2:15:54] house they looked at another brother
[2:15:55] said he couldn't have done that
[2:15:57] because by that time he had all the sins
[2:15:58] of the world had done been placed on him
[2:16:00] he was a sinner
[2:16:02] he had to walk up calvary's hill to
[2:16:03] Center
[2:16:05] but yet his character
[2:16:07] his attitude
[2:16:08] was still intact
[2:16:11] though he had homosexual Aid on him
[2:16:12] perversions of all kinds laid on him
[2:16:15] theft laid on him he's the Lamb of God
[2:16:17] but he's got all of the sins of the
[2:16:19] world remember that little lamb became
[2:16:20] the center of Israel
[2:16:22] when he went to lay his hands on that
[2:16:24] little lamb it became the center of
[2:16:26] Israel they were the ones that became
[2:16:28] clean the lamb became the sinner
[2:16:32] well they're pulling his beard out glory
[2:16:34] to God
[2:16:35] he said father forgive him
[2:16:37] you see there was that repentant
[2:16:39] attitude
[2:16:40] father forgive him
[2:16:43] they don't know what they're doing
[2:16:45] oh God
[2:16:48] let me always have that attitude
[2:16:51] that's about her hits this morning
[2:16:54] Lord Jesus
[2:16:57] how we thank you this morning for your
[2:16:59] word
[2:17:03] God I pray that the Holy Spirit Will
[2:17:06] just come into this place today
[2:17:10] and Lord you will bless us oh God
[2:17:16] with this repentant attitude
[2:17:20] some Services Lord we seek for
[2:17:22] Revelation which is wonderful
[2:17:25] Life Giving life prevailing revelation
[2:17:29] we need it
[2:17:30] but God before Revelation could come to
[2:17:32] us
[2:17:33] we've got to have a repentant heart
[2:17:36] we got to have a teachable spirit
[2:17:38] a touchable attitude
[2:17:41] so Lord
[2:17:42] I'm praying for every one of us this
[2:17:44] morning
[2:17:45] and Lord if there be one here even today
[2:17:47] that
[2:17:49] would have a resistance in their heart
[2:17:51] to what I'm saying
[2:17:52] God I just pray that you'll loosen them
[2:17:54] up
[2:17:56] allow them to think very seriously about
[2:17:58] their ways not every one of us checked
[2:18:01] this morning
[2:18:02] check up on our hearts
[2:18:04] to see whether we be in the faith or not
[2:18:07] granted Lord don't let us go out of here
[2:18:09] like
[2:18:10] the rest of these people in the world
[2:18:12] that go on day by day no matter what God
[2:18:15] does right before him shakes himself
[2:18:16] right in front of their face yet they
[2:18:19] don't see it though one be raised from
[2:18:21] the dead they're still not convinced
[2:18:23] but God help us not to be that way
[2:18:26] help us always do this one thing that
[2:18:28] you've ever asked of us
[2:18:30] in Jesus Christ's name
[2:18:33] now with your heads about just a moment
[2:18:35] I'd like to ask this audience this
[2:18:37] morning
[2:18:39] if you're standing here
[2:18:41] in your heart you know what I'm saying
[2:18:43] is strike at home with you
[2:18:45] and you can see that there's a lacking
[2:18:48] of that in your heart and your attitude
[2:18:50] you see that you're not as repentant as
[2:18:52] you should be
[2:18:53] let's just raise your hand in the Lord
[2:18:55] this morning
[2:18:56] and you say God I want you to help me
[2:18:58] this morning Lord

[2:19:10] father

[2:19:14] mechanism of repentance was the
[2:19:17] precursor to Revelation
[2:19:19] before Revelation can come
[2:19:22] it must be this little mechanism of
[2:19:24] repent
[2:19:25] so I pray father
[2:19:27] I pray that you'll help every one of us
[2:19:31] help every person in this building
[2:19:34] may you tender our hearts Lord and
[2:19:35] softness God
[2:19:36] that we might be able to receive
[2:19:39] a real repentant Spirit the Bible called
[2:19:42] it broken contrite
[2:19:44] in the Old Testament they would speak in
[2:19:46] the manner of having a broken
[2:19:48] countenance Lord that just simply means
[2:19:50] they were soft enough that you could
[2:19:52] deal with them
[2:19:53] help us Lord to get there granted Lord
