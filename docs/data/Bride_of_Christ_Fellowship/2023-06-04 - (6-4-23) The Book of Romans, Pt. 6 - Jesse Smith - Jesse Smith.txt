TRANSCRIPT
========================================
take me a number of sermons to get through but I just kind of felt led to go to that message so let's read this here Romans 5 verse 8. we'll have you be seated here by the grace of God Romans 5 verse 8. let's read that on three ready one two three but God commandeth his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us of course this means command means to prove God proved his love toward us in that while we were yet sinners Christ died for us he died he died for us before we even loved him before we express any love or any interest in God God had already prepared Christ to die for us what a great promise you may be seated here by God's grace may God has blessings the Ring of his word if you would here let's go back to Romans chapter 3 and I want to maybe I can build my way up to that I'm not sure how far I'll get I don't have any slides for this one I did all my slides for the souls that are in prison I'll look at that one tonight here by God's grace I want to go to Romans 3 25 we'll start there Romans 3 25 we kind of left off there on Wednesday night of course this has been a beautiful chapter here uh we're looking at Romans 3 about how the Jews had an advantage over everyone else because the word of God was given to them through Moses everyone else didn't have the words of God but the Jews of one small nation out of many nations had the word of God the law of God so there was an advantage of having the word of God but of course it's a disadvantage for all of us because we're all sinners right and so whether the the Jews had the law or whether the Gentiles didn't have the law they were all Sinners right and this is why God had to send Jesus Christ Hallelujah because we were all Sinners and we all needed saved by the grace of God but I started here Romans 3 25 here and we'll just work our way through here by God's grace let me set a timer here I'd like to uh watch my time here by God's grace here today so Romans 3 25. the Bible says whom God hath set forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood to declare his righteousness so God declared Jesus's righteousness for the remission or the sending away of sins that are passed through the forbearance of God hallelujah now this word propitiation means a that's a propitiary sacrifice through faith in his blood it also means a place of propitiation Hallelujah it also means a mercy seat in the Old Testament The Mercy Seat was sprinkled with atoning blood on the day of atonement in token that the righteous sentence of the law had been carried out so that what must else have been a judgment seat could righteously be a mercy seat so there's a lot said in there right in the Old Testament uh a goat had to die on the day of atonement and they would take the blood of the goat and they'd sprinkle it on every piece of furniture in the in the Holy place they start in the outer Court work their way to the inner core and then in the holiest of holies who had the Ark of the Covenant and there was a a box which was called the voice of holies on top of that the lid was called The Mercy Seat and the Bible said God Jesus is a propitiation or Jesus is The Mercy Seat and remember God's presence dwelt above that box that mercy seat and God God was going to judge the people unless there was blood on The Mercy Seat right and so once the blood of the goat was on The Mercy Seat now the people could speak to God and God would speak forgiveness to them God would speak Mercy to them God would God would say that your sins are paid for now because something has paid for your sins and innocent sacrifice paid for your sins and now I can talk with you now I can commune with you praise God Amen Hallelujah and Jesus is The Mercy Seat Jesus is no doubt he's the mercy you see plus he's the goat that died right plus he's the high priest that brought his own blood in this case he brought his own blood into heaven and he brought his own blood before the almighty invisible spirit of God and God received his sacrifice and now God can look at us and say you're forgiven hallelujah amen now you're righteous now I can speak to you now I won't judge you because a sacrifice has taken your place amen oh what a blessing amen the the faith the blood of Jesus Christ is a propitiation it takes the Judgment that was against us and gives us the righteousness of Jesus Christ and now Jesus's righteousness is declared for us and our sins are remitted the Bible said remission there was two goats on that day one goat died and they took the blood into the holiest the other goat had all the sins confessed upon it and it was sent out in the wilderness never to be seen again that's called the scapegoat right the scapegoat that escaped but all the sin was placed upon that goat sent away and the Goat would never be seen hallelujah amen the goat would be taken off in the wilderness and never seen again and it represents how our sin was placed upon Jesus and Jesus took our sins and carried it so far away that our sins Will Never Be Remembered in heaven anymore praise God oh my oh it's a beautiful picture praise God Jesus both died for our sins and he carried our sins far away Hallelujah amen where did he carry our sins to he carried our sins down to Hell itself that's First Peter chapter three let's read that First Peter chapter 3 by God's grace that's where you look we'll look a bit further at that tonight we look at Souls that are in prison now I thought with our visitor Kyle we just kind of keep things straight right from the word of God there by God's grace so he can so it can be just as clear as possible here by God's grace first Peter 3. then we'll get into you know the ministry of God's Prophet this this evening by God's grace first Peter 3 18. so here's where Christ carried our sins uh the Bible said he carried him far away and here the Bible said he carried them down to Hell Verse 18 for Christ also also has once suffered for sins the just for the unjust that he might bring us to God being put to death in the flesh but quickened by the spirit by which also he went and preached unto the spirits in prison so we'll look at that later tonight verse 20 which sometime we're disobedient when Once the long-suffering of God wait in the days of Noah while the ark wasn't preparing wherein few that is eight Souls were saved by water so the Bible says in verse 19 he went and preached on the spirits in prison so this was Jesus going down into the depths of the regions of the Lost in the heart of the earth Jesus went into the heart of the Earth and the Bible said that he took the keys of death and Hell from Satan and because he took the keys of death and hell he could he could cause a resurrection praise God and then when Jesus raised he didn't he didn't raise alone praise God hallelujah he brought up many of the Old Testament Saints and they Rose praise God and they were seen in the city let's read out here Matthew I believe it's 27. Matthew 27 let's read that 27 51. so jesus carried our sins down to the heart of the Earth the regions of the lost and he condemned Satan down there but he took the keys of took his keys of death and hell and now Jesus has power over the grave Hallelujah he can conquer the grave he can bring out the Old Testament Saints out from the heart of the earth and he can resurrect them up to the Earth and eventually up to heaven praise God Amen verse 51 and behold the veil of the temple was written Twain From the top to the bottom and the Earth did quake and the Rocks rent verse 52 and the Grays were open and many bodies of the Saints which slept arose and came out of the graves after his resurrection and went to the holy city and appeared unto many so when Jesus raised from the dead he didn't raise alone he brought an army with him praise God how many believe that by God's grace and we know when Jesus comes the second time he's doing the same thing Hallelujah because the Bible says the dead in Christ will rise first Hallelujah he's bringing him an army with him robed in white hallelujah thank God Amen and church many of our loved ones or or if we would happen to die then we will raise first the Bible says because the dead in Christ rise first hallelujah what a promise so in both cases at both resurrections he brings uh the dead Saints with him because he has power over death hell and the grave Hallelujah and he proved it when he raised Lazarus from the grave amen he proved it every time he raised somebody from their dead that he had the power to conquer death itself amen hallelujah praise God now let's go back to Romans 3 26 here Romans 3 26 we'll go back here we're just preaching verse by verse here to declare I say at this time his righteousness so church is not your righteousness that's declared right you're you know God's not going to use your righteousness to to let you into heaven the Bible said God is preparing Jesus and declaring Jesus's righteousness for you and I hallelujah oh there should be no words brother gets in the spot in his in his ministry where he says the ultimate goal of the Christian is to rest in what Jesus has done like he brings it to that place and said we have to rest as Believers in other words that means a lot of people when we all do it we wrestle are we saved you know can God forgive me will God really forgive me and he says the ultimate place of a Believer is resting in the finished work of Jesus Christ sacrifice Hallelujah and here's a man who says after he served God for 30 or 40 years he's still learning how to rest in church I think as we go on we just need concert reminders to rest in the promise rest in the blood of Jesus rest in Jesus purchasing our Salvation we've got to trust in his righteousness it's the only righteousness there really is praise God our righteousness the Bible says it says filthy rags and yes God will use us at certain times to do good things and we can see God working our lives but it's not our works that allows us to get to heaven we didn't pay the price to get to heaven God paid the price Hallelujah with his own blood with his own son Hallelujah that's why we worship and love Jesus amen that's why he's the way the truth and the life Hallelujah he's the way the truth and the life hallelujah thank God Jesus's righteousness is what gets us there verse 26 that he might be just that God is fair and he's the justifier or the one who declares righteous of him that believes in Jesus so God declares us righteous because we believe in Jesus Christ amen verse 27 now where is boasting then who's going to brag why serve God for 40 years I serve God for 50 years who's going to brag in heaven the Bible says it's excluded there's no there's no place for well the braggers or the holiest people will be over here bragging about how they got to heaven on their own there'll be no spots in heaven for that praise God Amen it's excluded by what law or what works nay no but by the law of Faith Hallelujah in other words God is going to save people just because they believe in Jesus Christ because they receive Jesus Christ now we're going to see the balance later in the chapters but you know the balance if you receive the faith uh to have faith in Jesus Christ well then then what you've received is forgiveness of sins and because you're so happy to be forgiven because you're so thankful to be forgiven then you want to do works for Jesus you don't want to work for Satan he was trying to kill you and destroy you murder you he was trying to get you a frame he was trying to betray you you know he was he was trying to make your life or make you lose your life he was trying to get rid of you but Jesus came and had mercy on you and so when you receive salvation you want to do something for Jesus Hallelujah anything Lord I'll do anything I don't care if I'm the I don't care if I have to open the door to the church if I never get to do a miracle I never get to do anything it doesn't matter I just want to do something for Jesus Hallelujah if I just get to wash the toilets at the church praise God hallelujah what whatever God's called me to do I want to do something anything to glorify Jesus Christ Hallelujah hey Master David said I'd rather be the doorkeeper at the temple of God than to dwell with the tents of the wicked I'd rather be I'd rather be the sweeper here today at the church I know I'm the preacher but if I wasn't the preacher I'd rather sweep these floors than be drunk with those bunch of Sinners that are lost out there my heart goes out to them we're sad for them I'd rather be here picking up crumbs off the floor then laying on the floor there with a hangover something like that I'd rather serve Jesus because he's the Savior praise God amen thank God but there would be no boasting in heaven like how great I was or how great you were there'll be no boasting now verse uh 28 therefore we conclude that a man is justified by faith without the Deeds of the law so no matter how much Moses could keep so many Commandments or Aaron or Miriam or any of the Saints they were not declared righteous because of all their deeds they were declared righteous because they had faith in God faith means confidence right it means trust in other words as long as a person I'm just as long as a person is just trusting in God they are saved that's what saves them they're trusting in the sacrifice of Jesus Christ how many trusting in Him Today oh thank God I am Hallelujah with all my heart praise God verse 29 is he god of the Jews only is he not also the Gentiles yes of the Gentiles also thank God because we're all Gentiles right if we're not Jews if we're not Israelites then we're all Gentiles thank God that he's the god of the Gentiles as well amen verse 30 seeing it is one God not three Gods one God which shall justify the circumcision by faith and uncircumcision through faith now we're going to get to this here in chapter four in just a moment but for the Jews it was so important all the males had to be circumcised and by the time Jesus came 1 500 years after Moses they were making that surgery the evidence that they were saved instead of trusting in God they were trusting that they had the surgery now God wanted them to have a surgery but they begin to trust in their fleshly Works does that sound familiar people today will say as long as I give money to church then I'm saved no that's actually not it as long as you know they're trusting in their own works as long as I I stopped doing this and start doing that then I'm then I'm saved by my works I'm a good person so God's going to save me that's not it at all it's trusting in the finished work of Jesus Christ he died for me so that I could be saved hallelujah it's that simple just trusting in that and then if you really believe that it will change your heart the Bible said God Will Take Your Heart of Stone and it'll make it a heart of Flesh Hallelujah he'll transform your heart where you're not Stony towards the word of God you're not hard and bitter against God's word but now it's a living your heart's alive to the things of God oh my you're sensitive in other words you're sensitive to the things of God the spirit of God moves you sometimes you're shouting sometimes you're dancing sometimes you're praising God I feel like dancing and you're you're just loving God sometimes you're weeping uh you want Sinners to be saved all these emotions come on you because now you've got a heart of Flesh you can feel God's heart praise God you feel what God feels God wants Sinners to be saved Hallelujah God for you God Jesus wept when Lazarus died you'll feel the emotions you're sensitive to the Holy Spirit Hallelujah and today we want to feel what the holy spirit is putting into our hearts amen in other words let's be sensitive today what is God trying to speak to our hearts today what does God want to accomplish today in our hearts and lives amen Glory so God justifies or declares righteous Jews if they're circumcised by faith and Gentiles if they're not circumcised by faith both groups he declares them righteous because of faith in the word of God Amen now here Romans 3 31 now we're finished in chapter 3 moving into chapter four here I think this is the last verse yes chapter 4. Romans 3 31 do we then make void the law through faith so Paul says so then should we just get rid of all those Old Testament books then God forbid no no don't get rid of him yay we establish the law in other words we make firm the law now this doesn't mean we go back to legalism as we're going to say it just means we make it firm in other words God was speaking so many truths in the law that we need it we don't want that we don't want that Foundation to fall we need that Foundation I'm going to show you another one here you probably remember this one but go to First Corinthians 15. I'll show you a reason why we need this I didn't get to this on Wednesday night but I wanted to I'll preach here today First Corinthians 15 51. First Corinthians 15 51. behold I shoe you a mystery we shall not all sleep but we shall all be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye at the last Trump so this is speaking of the rapture the second I'm sorry the first resurrection for the trumpet shall sound and the dead shall be raised incorruptible and we shall be changed for this corruption I'm sorry for this corrupt that we must put on encryption and this Mortal must put on immortality verse 54 is where we want to go so when this corruptable shall have put on incorruption and this Mortal shall put on immortality then shall be brought to pass the saying that is written death is swallowed up in Victory amen hallelujah so at some point in the future Jesus is going to come down and he's going to Rapture he's going to snatch up all the Believers who are filled with the Holy Spirit and then he's going to pour out his wrath he's going to keep all those Saints in his heart up in heaven Hallelujah he's going to keep them close to his heart and they should have all the Angels pour out all the wrath upon the Earth he's going to rescue his wife Hallelujah his Believers off the Earth Hallelujah but when he does that the Bible said our bodies will be changed our bodies now are dying they're corruptable but in that moment when he snatches us up we're going to get transformed we're gonna get brand new bodies Hollywood can't touch you I don't care how many movies they make about superheroes and Star Trek and all that's all a perversion but what's good they're getting close to guessing it what is what might be like but it's a perversion God is the one who's going to change our bodies are somehow going to be swallowed up how do you know how do you swallow something up he's gonna the holy spirit's gonna come over and swallow us up we'll have brand new bodies and then we'll start rising up to meet him in the air amen oh what a transformation praise God hallelujah what a blessing now verse 55 oh death where's thy sting oh grave where's thy Victory The Sting of death is sin and the strength of sin is the law but thanks be to God which giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ amen so Paul before he was martyred before his head was cut off in Rome around 56 A.D or 65 A.D he was trusting that at some point he knew his dead his body will get swallowed up in life and he would get a resurrected body he was trusting in that 2000 years ago here we are today we're still trusting in the same promise but where does that promise come from it comes from the law and the prophets so go to Isaiah chapter 25 now this is why I love this scripture should we get rid of the law should we make void the law no because the law has promises the law and the prophets have promises of your Resurrection amen Isaiah 25 I believe it's verse 8. you know there's famous preachers that uh one's in Georgia and they're not message Believers but there's a famous preacher who says we need to unhook ourselves from the law in other words we don't need to know the law we don't need to read the law we don't need to obey anything in the law and that's a really immature statement and church to me what it's saying is almost uh it's almost like this like well then we don't need the rapture because the Rapture is in the Old Testament praise God Jesus Rapture was in the Old Testament praise God Isaiah 25 verse let's go to let's read verse six because this kind of ties in with the former latter rain and in this mountain shall the Lord of hosts make unto all people a feast of fat things a feast of wine there's the wine on the leaves of fat things full of marrow of wines on the leaves well refined and he will destroy in this mountain the face of the covering casts over all people and the veil that is spread over all nations he will swallow up death in Victory and the Lord God will wipe away tears from off all faces and the rebuke of his people shall he take away from off all the Earth for the Lord has spoken in amen church this was spoken 712 years before Christ so we're coming up on now it's been 2 000 years since Christ was here we're coming up on 2700 years this has been prophesied death is going to be swirled up death is going to be swirled up Paul was trusting in this Hallelujah every believer is trusting in this and now we're trusting in this praise God we will not make void the law will not get rid of the law we'll keep believing in the law praise God we won't now here's what the difference we're not going to find our righteousness in the law because we'll never be able to keep it our righteousness is in Christ but in the law or promises about you and I aren't you glad God wrote about you 2700 years ago he wrote about every Christian every Gentile believer that would be in the Rapture he wrote about you 2700 years ago and church God's promise cannot fail if you're a real saint of God if you're a real believer that your death will be swallowed up in Victory Hallelujah oh I ought to make somebody shout praise God glory I'm gonna Shout hallelujah thank you Jesus so see we don't want to make void the law as far as we don't want to get rid of the law we still need to reference it there's still prophecies in there that we're believing Hallelujah of course we we could go to all the prophecies about the Millennium right you're in there the Bible says uh children will lead lions and lambs and uh wolves children will lead them on a rope imagine a child leading one of those big lines on the Akron Zoo imagine them leaving oh hey come here little guy come on guy he just pulled him around that's what the Millennium is going to be like that's your promise amen okay say like this your children whoever's children are going to lead Lions around and then the lion and wolf will lay down right by the lamb and there'll be buddies cuddling on each other that's a promise I don't want to make that void that promise is true praise God and church while that's going on the Bible said we're going to rule the Nations because we were Believers in Jesus Christ will rule and reign with Christ not for five months or five years but for a thousand years Hallelujah if we can rule over sin Satan the Devil the world and hell and Temptation now he makes us rulers for a thousand years in the Millennium praise God oh what a promise amen so keep ruling over sin today praise God how many will do it we're all going to battle sin but keep crucifying sins and and The Temptations keep crucifying that and if you do rule over that then Jesus will make you a ruler in the millennium he promised it praise God amen what a blessing now don't forget this here I want to look at this also the law was so important now go to Romans 7 12. you got your Bibles Romans 7 12. I want to read this to you people that know the Bible know the law is so important but we do not get our justification from the law we get it through Jesus Christ we're not saved through the law we will never be able to keep I think somebody counted either 613 or 616 laws that they had to follow now if you subtract there's about 200 that go to the uh uh the the priests so if you subtract that now you're only down to 400 if you're not a priest none of us are priests here right so then you don't have to keep about 400 laws that sounds easier but it's still impossible right oh my God so see we we want to establish the law we want to make it firm because there's promises in there there's types and shadows of Jesus Christ in there there's there's uh our future spoken about in there praise God we establish the law he says in other words we make sure it's firm we don't forget about it but we remember it Romans 7 12 wherefore the law is what church it's holy and the Commandment holy and just and good see people today say God they say well God God gives us rules we're not a rule following Church the Bible says rules are good the Bible says Commandments Are Holy it's only rebellious sinner that doesn't want rules right oh you don't like rules okay well let's go to a property let's go to something you bought whether it's your car and whether it's your home and let's let uh let's let people just demolish it and then say okay that's okay there's no rules just let all these homeless people destroy and they can live in my house they can live in my car and I don't have any place to live would you uh do you still want rules now or not it's foolish to say people don't want rules until it affects them then they want rules like these people that said defund the police and yet they've got police escorts wherever they go bunch of hypocrites right it's a spirit it's a spirit of confusion the Bible says Commandments Are Holy rules are holy thank God for the rules of the Holy Spirit thank God for them they protect us rules protect us hallelujah like you have the right to care bear arms right you got that rule that's a good rule it protects you gives you a right to a sense of protection by God's grace these are all things that we must remember so the Bible says the Old Testament was good and holy and just it was fair now go to Galatians 3 24. this is what we're familiar with this one's a little bit dear to my heart since I'm a school teacher and should be dear to our homeschooling moms teachers Hearts as well I think Bang's going to homeschool so it's going to be dear to his heart Galatians 3 24 wherefore the law was our school Master to bring us unto Christ that we might be justified by faith right and what kind of teacher was the law was it a uh was it just like a laid-back loose kind of teacher no the law was a strict teacher you break one command you broke all of them so the Bible says the Old Testament law is so strict but it's pointing you so you'll get your justification not in the law but from Christ amen Hallelujah see that's how that's how people's attitude is towards uh the Bible as long as they're keeping the law it's like well I please the teacher I please the teacher but then they know as soon as they break one command the teacher is going to be upset that's how that's how it is when you're trusting in your own Works to be saved but when you're trusting in Grace Hallelujah and then then you have you have confidence when I go to Christ he's not going to get rid of me he's not going to wipe my name off the book he's going to forgive me the Bible said he's ready to Pardon Me praise God he wants to forgive me he wants to forgive us more than we want to go confess our sins right but here we see the laws good holy just and the law was a school Master it was pointing us it was trying to teach us something it was teaching us that salvation doesn't come by animal sacrifice salvation doesn't come by human efforts salvation comes by you receiving the gift of Jesus Christ amen Hallelujah I want to just show you go to Psalms 119 it's the longest chapter in the Bible if you've got it Psalms 119 verse 97 this is this is beautiful praise God the scriptures are so beautiful Psalms 119 verse 97. now mem is the name of a Hebrew letter this chapter has a section that starts with every Hebrew letter in the Hebrew alphabet of course that speaks of how Jesus is the Alpha and Omega the beginning and the end the first and the last right Jesus the first letter the last letter he's everything in between he's our whole language we can't get any language without Jesus praise God he's our everything Psalms 119 verse 97 ma'am oh how I love thy law and preachers will say they despise the law how different are they from David right a man after God's Own Heart God's law it is my meditation all the day all the day I'm thinking about the scriptures what scriptures were you thinking about yesterday were you thinking about him if not let's get our minds back on the scriptures see when you meditate on God's word it makes you what sad or happy Church what does it make it makes you happy put a sermon on and find a scripture just meditate on that scripture all the day long praise God it's my meditation all day long verse 98 thou through thy Commandments has made me wiser than mine enemies for they are ever with me so David was always around his enemies but he saw how the word of God made him wiser you ever seen that you know you maybe you told a friend not to do something you told your friend about the word of God they they went against your advice and then they ruined something in their life because they went against the word of God right we told people I've told people not to get married because they weren't Believers and they went ahead and got married and runes ruins their life they're now divorced or they're in worse condition they try to warn them and give them warnings and if they just would have obeyed the word of God it would have been all right the marriage might have worked out because they would not have married that one they would have waited till they got the one that God had for him right that's what that one brother years ago I shouldn't call the name but tried to warn the brother and see the word of God it's just humbling ourselves to trusting God's wisdom rather than our own wisdom right trust in the wisdom of God not in the wisdom of man verse 99 I have more understanding than all my teachers for thy testimonies are my meditation that means his teachers weren't meditating on God's word that'd be a pretty bad situation to be in right you got teachers but they don't know the word of God well I think all of us can probably say we went if we went to public schools that was the case right or even going to college now right or AP classes or whatever you're in not to be prideful but if you meditate on God's word you're actually wiser than your instructors right that's the word of God go to uh verse 103 of the same chapter Psalm 119 103. oh Church my what a promise how sweet are thy words unto my taste yay sweeter than honey to my mouth Hallelujah David would just he would just think about the word of God it was like he was eating honey yesterday I had syrups I didn't have honey but I had syrup on some pancakes boy were they sweet yesterday right that's some sweet syrup but David says the only thing I compare to meditating on God's word is honey anybody had any honey lately a couple people all right good well that's a good that's a good natural reminder of what God's word is like when you really put trust in it I'm not talking about just here and then forget about it I'm talking about meditating it all throughout the day Hallelujah and then it becomes sweet to you it becomes I mean that Isaiah scripture that all be sweet to us brother amen one day death will be swallowed up in life like in a brand new body and I got a body like Jesus's own body praise God that ought to be sweet to our taste one day Hallelujah death will be swallowed up in life there'll be no more aches no more pains no more worries no more Sorrows of a perfect body with a perfect mind I mean just like Jesus Hallelujah oh my thank God this made David say your words are sweeter than honey to my mouth oh Hallelujah that's why I was singing that song before or as we come up here uh you know his love I could sing him his love forever why because his love is so great because the promises of his love give us the promise of eternal life blessings in this life praise God we have so many great precious promises the Bible tells us go to verse uh 165 last one out of Psalm 119. Psalm 119 verse 165. see people get stressed out they get anxious they get nervous because they don't meditate on God's word and we're all guilty but we all need reminders that's why we all come here praise God the Bible doesn't say a little bit of peace the Bible says great peace have they which love thy law and nothing shall offend them praise God hallelujah the enemy can't overcome them right uh their brother or sister mom or dad can't can't make them uh leave this atmosphere of love this atmosphere of Peace nobody can move them is that what the Bible says God will make us so strong that we shall not be moved amen hallelujah no one will be able to move us out of our state of peace out of our state of love because of God's law that we meditate on we think about God's promises we think about God's mercy oh and we are the benefactors we're the we're the objects of God's love Hallelujah oh what a blessing amen all right now go to Romans chapter 4 verse 1. Romans 4 verse 1. all right so begin chapter four today by God's grace Romans 4 verse 1. now this section is in the same section about God solves the guilt problem through justifying Believers through faith in Christ so remember the first three chapters all about there's no hope for the sinner there's no hope for Jew or Gentile anyone there's no hope at all so the only hope is Faith in Jesus Christ oh hallelujah thank you Jesus Romans 4 verse 1. what shall we say then that Abraham our father as pertaining to the flesh hath found for If Abraham were justified by works he hath whereof to Glory but not before God so think about this Abraham's called the friend of God he's called the father of our faith and yet he cannot even boast before God about his works the Father the the one who started the Jewish faith right the one who the Christian faith goes back to him as well the man that God chose to start a holy nation a holy group of spiritual group of believers the very man himself has nothing to brag about before God the church remember where did he start with who remembers where he started with he started near the Tower of Babel he was an idolater he was a maker of Idols he was worshiping dead things right with his dad he was worshiping Idols that couldn't talk back but then God started talking to him amen aren't you glad God talked to you as well praise God he called you out of your sinful lifestyle and now he talks to you yes sometimes through dreams or Vision sometimes like sister who you might hear the voice of God right under testimony there to speak to your heart you'll get a conviction on your heart you'll get a voice you'll get some some uh some Heavenly instruction come right to your mind God talks to us now and he talks words of Peace words of Victory great peace the Bible says amen great peace gives the Holy Spirit to all those who trust in him praise God oh my so Abraham will not be declared righteous by his Works God will not say look at Abraham look at all the works that he did now I'll save him because of what he did that's not how Abraham was going to be saved he's not saved by works verse 3. for what saith the scripture Abraham believeth God hallelujah amen and it was counted unto him for righteousness oh that's beautiful Glory see it takes a belief in God can I say it like this church for Sinners and if we remember when we got saved what was just the first thing we had to do we just had to believe God remember Hebrews 11 said God's rewarder of them that diligently seek him and like Jesus said all it takes to be become a fruitful Christian is Faith Like a mustard seed I wish I would have brought the Mustard Seed I probably lost it but you can buy a container or mustard see there's like a thousand mustard seeds in there it's so small in other words our faith is so small but if we keep adding God's word to it we keep worshiping God it'll grow into something great it'll grow into a testimony that glorifies God Almighty oh my praise God hallelujah so take that seat of faith and just keep believing God plant that faith in Jesus Christ water it every day with your prayers your Bible reading your worship your church attendance singing to God just keep watering it it's going to grow into something great and pretty soon you'll start seeing the fruits of the Holy Spirit amen what a promise ah so Abraham just believed I just believe God's word and now God counts it to him as being righteous righteousness right verse 4. now to him that worketh is the reward not reckoned of Grace but of debt right so when we just believed God it's a reward of Grace and it's not like well God owes me something church God doesn't owe us anything right the Bible said in Acts 17 that God doesn't really need anything right he can just exist he doesn't have to have anything to exist he self-exists amen that's what John Yahweh means a self-existent one Hallelujah the great one the self-existent one Jehovah he doesn't need anything to exist it's by his grace that we exist I'll say like this as far as pleasure that we exist the Bible says amen you were made for God's pleasure okay so see we get the reward of Grace if we believe in Jesus Christ it's not well I believe so I get the reward and of the debt and God owed me because I believed in him he owed me so now he's going to give me righteousness not of debt it's by grace so church I'll just say like this uh any brother even brings it down to Divine Healing right anything that we have need of whether it's Divine Healing today was our financial need we might need forgiveness today right whatever we need of maybe we need a Praying for a spouse for our young ladies and young men praying for children whatever you're praying for we should pray and ask God Lord by your grace I'm asking you give this to me as a gift of Grace it's never going to be a gift of works it's going to be a gift of Grace it's not God you owe me this and you owe me a spouse or you owe me this that's not it it's Lord I would like this as a gift of your grace but either way we should say let thy will be done hallelujah let's ask for God's will in our lives not our own will it's okay to express our desires to God but really the child of God is able to trust God with their entire life and we got to learn to do that right we're learning to Die daily as the Bible says submit submit yourselves therefore unto the mighty hand of God resist the devil and he will have to flee praise God amen so it's a it's and that's what brother Brandon said you know in works is Faith expressed with Divine Healing if you need healing just say Lord I'm going to keep believing until you give me this gift of Grace brother man said if you ever had Faith to be healed it was a gift of Grace oh my I always say think about the Miracles you've had in your life brother every single one of them was a gift of Grace praise God you didn't earn it I didn't earn it nobody earned it it was all gifts of Grace praise God it was God's unmerited favor you know tonight I'll go through the times you know the Lord has allowed me to speak to mountains right you have a sheriff numerous times uh we'll look at times brother random spoke to some mountains by faith and each time he said it was God leading me to do it it wasn't him like well I like to do a miracle today what Miracle could I do today because I'm so holy that's that's impossible right even Jesus said I the son can do nothing of himself but what he sees the father do the son doeth likewise praise God Amen oh my in other words we're distrusted we're waiting on God's timing we're waiting on God's grace amen for God to move and really finish his story that he's writing in our lives that he started praise God oh God started my testimony God saved me out of my sins and God's gonna bring me to heaven with him praise God he started my salvation he's going to finish it amen hallelujah praise God I'm happy today church are you happy today by God's grace well thank God thank God for Amazing Grace Hallelujah oh thank you Jesus it just makes me happy just to you know I battle you know you probably battle it too I battle feeling like I've earned it oh have been good enough today have I been have I studied enough now for where God can send his spirit it's never going to be enough right we'll never we'll never have enough so we have to just follow the word of God the best we can and then God in his moments of Grace will pour out his grace Upon Us praise God oh amen thank God be faithful right watch him pray Jesus says keep watching and praying God is perfecting the Bible said uh the Bible said I will praise the Lord for he will perfect that which concerneth me Hallelujah how do you believe that he's going to perfect your life it may not look like it's going to work out it may not look like it's going to be good or something but the bible promises if you trust in God he will perfect those things that concern you in other words he'll bring it to completion what he's trying to do in your life praise God Hallelujah no breeds of completion that's what he does amen Hallelujah he's got to do it praise God he's the all the Bible said he's the author and finisher of your life praise God amen I really I want to just maybe if I could I want to get down to verse 11 where when I would close in about 15 minutes here or so by God's grace that way I just preach you all or just preach an hour and five minutes at the Amish or at the Junction City Church so that was a real short sermon for me I really I really enjoyed that I hope you're enjoying the word of God today by God's grace now verse five Romans 4 verse five that's be I just love preaching through the books like this because you see the whole picture there's times that you know like tonight when we look at souls in prison now I'll just go scripture by scripture all around the Bible but it's so nice just to read through it and see God's truths in here and compare it with the rest of the scriptures because this is thus saith the Lord right this is thus saith God verse 5 Romans 4 verse 5. but to him that worketh not but believeth so see believe is opposite of human works so see when someone's trying to earn their salvation they really don't believe and they're not really putting any trust in God they're putting trust in themselves well if I work harder if I do more then God will forgive me no God wants you to just believe he forgives me amen just believe it because he said so Hallelujah he said so right the Bible said confess your sins and he will he will be faithful and just to cleanse you of all unrighteousness just confess them say God I'm sorry forgive me God help me to be stronger next time give me strength so I don't fall to that sin next time and the Bible said he gives you his righteousness amen oh what a blessing amen thank you Jesus verse five yeah we're trying to cool down here thank you there's my 45 minutes all right so verse 5 but to him that worketh not but believeth on him that justified the ungodly his faith is accounted for unrighteousness I'm sorry for righteousness so church if we believe on God that God justifies Sinners Like Us then the Bible said God counts that for your righteousness I believe God forgives you of all your sins now you're righteous you're righteous that's the Simplicity of the Gospel if you just believe God will forgive you then the Bible said he will that he just forgives You by Grace by faith Hallelujah oh what a what a blessing this is verse six even as David also who does he go back to the man after God's Own Heart Hallelujah even as David also described the blessedness of this man well here's a man that murdered and was an adulterer and he can describe the blessings of justification what a perfect example to use amen what a perfect example he doesn't deserve it but yet he still gets it Hallelujah we don't deserve justification but we still get it praise God Amen glory and church will have to take a whole another sermon and just go over Abraham's failures yes he was a man of Faith but it might help us to remember sometimes all of his failures and still he was declared righteous in the sight of God because he believed God he doesn't believe he wasn't trusting in his righteousness he was trusting in God's mercy Abraham in other words was a repeated liar now don't raise your hands but we've all lied I have to say who's lied I already know you've lied and if you don't I know you're lying you just started today right don't start lying in church either that's a bad bad thing to do right but look at this Abraham was a repeated liar he ran when things got tough in a drought he ran from the prince of God and went down to Egypt he went down to a place of sinners he was so brother random calls him cowardly now that's brother Adam's work he was such a coward he gave his wife over to two different Kings and didn't stand up for his wife now sisters how would that make you feel if your husband doesn't stand up for him and brothers we've all probably failed our wives at some point right we didn't pray enough intercede enough didn't care enough right right this is what Abraham did and then Abraham takes Hagar he takes a second wife he lets his wife talk him into having another wife which only caused trouble and then the wife gets mad at him she got mad at him you're the one who talked me into this in other words we we hear these names and we think instant Perfection and total righteousness they had no righteousness but God's righteousness and yes they learn to obey but they didn't earn salvation Glory Church you didn't earn salvation God say like this God chose you for salvation God chose you to be saved amen and you just responded Hallelujah and you received it by faith and now Christ gives you his righteousness and now you're forgiven and all your sins are remitted set far away and now you are the righteousness of Christ ah Hallelujah just wish there was a way I could say it where it was more impactful praise God if I just say holy spirit you know help let the people receive it despite my failures or my lack of words maybe but I trust you're receiving what God's word says about you praise God amen so David says you get the righteous of God without your works that's why I always go back to the thief on the cross he had no works he was a thief and he was being killed and it was just he was justly dying the true picture of us amen we deserve to be crucified but all he does is he stands up for Jesus and said Jesus did nothing wrong and he said remember me when you come into your kingdom and he doesn't say well maybe after 10 years of purgatory I'll let you in he said today you'll be with me in Paradise amen hallelujah today Hallelujah today it was instant into the paradise of God and that beautiful praise God oh my God all he did was basically confess and say we're worthiness he's not worthy he said today you'll be with me in Paradise oh my church if if God if time goes on and one of us go to the Grave one by one we can be assured we'll be with Christ in Paradise amen but Paradise has a new location it's not in the heart of the earth anymore now it's up in the Heavenly Realm Hallelujah so we won't go down when we die we go up praise God Hallelujah ma what a promise so how does David describe this forgiven believer verse 7. how did he describe he said blessed are they whose iniquities are forgiven iniquity means lawlessness blessed are they whose Lawless sins are forgiven and whose sins are covered over Hallelujah they just cover God just covers over all your sins don't see him anymore praise God blessed is that man who God does not impute iniquity in other words I don't I don't pay you back for all the sins you did in fact I cover over all your iniquities you don't see any more praise God oh what a blessing verse 8. blessed is the man to whom the Lord will not impute sin see church people say oh man this person got a five million dollar contract he's blessed not exactly that contract might take him to places he never the Bible said riches many times are a snare that's what the Bible says because people start trusting in their riches like I talked to a guy uh I went to college with was it who was it I was talking with anyways oh yeah my former High School football coach he went to another school and taught and one of his football players played baseball and he just signed a 63 million dollar contract to pitch I forget I think it's the Toronto or I member's name I have to text him and look it up but he was rejoicing in that and I'm thinking well yeah I mean I'm kind of jealous of that in my flesh but who's more Rich if you just have 63 million dollars and don't have salvation or you have a few dollars like us and you have salvation amen who's more blessed and which one would be more uh which one should you get more happiness about the blood of Jesus Christ amen hallelujah the greatest reward the greatest Victory the greatest blessing you could have blessed is the man who God forgives all of his sins amen I'm happy for the guy I'm glad you got to reach that level of being a pro that's I didn't reach that level I only made it to college but I'm glad I got the police play in college but that doesn't bring me any spiritual blessings it's just a human a dream or human desire but the Bible said we must set our affections on things above Hallelujah where Jesus sits on the right hand of the throne on the majesty and high praise God amen blessed is the man verse 8 to whom the Lord will not impute the sin that means reckon he won't reckon that Austin sinned he won't reckon well Jose I'm Reckoning you you're sinning you know in other words there's a Day of Reckoning I'm paying you back for all those sins Jose the Bible said blessed is a man that God does not give him a Day of Reckoning in other words church we have nothing to fear on the damn judgment praise God Jesus already took our judgment for us praise God the Bible said he was made sin that we might become the righteousness of God hallelujah there's no Reckoning I'm not going to have to pay for the sins that I committed last week or last year there's no Reckoning because Jesus already took all the punishment on the cross for me now do I have to confess my sins yes I confess them every day yes I confess them this morning or whenever whenever I did him yesterday whatever I confess my sins but I know I'm blessed that Jesus already paid for all my sins because I just believe in him and then my life my Works my Works speak that I believe in him because I'm overcoming them I'm trying to I'm asking for God's help I'll say I'm not trying I'm receiving God's help amen trying works for a little while but at some point you want to start receiving God's strength praise God you might try for a few days or weeks or whatever months years whatever but at some point you got to get the victory you got to receive overcoming Grace Hallelujah because Jesus said to he who overcomes I'll let him sit on the throne right of my father as I am set on my father's Throne Overcomers praise God church I think you're I think you're we're honest right even since we struggle with that are really pleasurable after a while we all get tired of them and the church said so now that to me speaks of God's grace because at some point this used to be satisfying to our flesh but not anymore God let it get old ah thank God God and so it's like and then when it gets old and you don't even want to do it anymore that's God's mercy the Bible said sin is only pleasurable for a season thank God for New Seasons in our lives amen thank God for a new Victory and new Strength thank God that sin gets old and God's love never gets old praise God oh Hallelujah the love of God how rich and pure amen how marvelous and strong praise God it shall forevermore endure the Saints and Angels song praise God oh we got to sing that one here in a little bit by God's grace thank God for the love of God Hallelujah verse 9. cometh this blessedness then upon the circumcision or Jews only in other words do Jews are they the only ones that God covers over all their sins of course you know the answer or upon the Gentiles uncircumcision only for we say that Faith was reckoned to Abraham for righteousness how when that how then was it I'm sorry how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or in uncircumcision so for a lot of Abraham's life he wasn't yet circumcised so Paul asked this question was he forgiven before he was circumcised or did it have to be after now Church the same applies today what's the spiritual seal of the Holy Ghost today what is it is it circumcision what is it somebody say what is it the baptism Holy Ghost that's the spiritual seal today did I say that the wrong way okay I was trying to show how in the Old Testament the Seal of being in the Covenant was circumcision but there's a different circumcision today we just read it in chapter two it's the circumcision of the Soul there you go praise God now I'm saying that to get to the verse 11 is where I eventually you want to get I want to close it with verse 11. I'm trying to show you Paul's asking this question when was he forgiven when was he a real believer was it before he got the token you say like that or was it after he got the token I think you know the answer I hope you do by God's grace and I hope it makes you happy today hope it hope it renews your strength in the Lord today hope for you I'll help you see God's Grace afresh today verse 10 okay I already read verse 10. Oh no verse 10. how was it then reckoned when he was in circumcision or an uncircumcision look what he says not in circumcision so not in Genesis 17 but in uncircumcision Genesis I'm sorry Genesis 12. Genesis 12. all right so hold your place here hold your place here because we're in and end with verse 11. go to Genesis 12 verse 1. this was spoken around 1920 BC Genesis 12 and now this is based upon uh the historian Usher I think that's how you say his name oh sure u-u-s-h-e-r -bouchure I'm not sure Genesis 12 verse 1. now this after the flood of course after Tower of Babel and then Genesis of Genesis 12 verse 1. now the Lord had sent unto Abram get thee out of thy country and from thy Kindred and from thy Father's House unto a land that I will shoe thee and I'll make of thee a great nation I'll bless thee and make thy name great and thou shalt be a blessing and I will bless them that bless thee and curse him that curseth thee in these shall all families of the earth be blessed now there's a lot in here but I'm going to share it for Kyle's sake in Galatians Church remember Paul applies this scripture to you your Abraham seed in other words Brother Kyle anyone who blesses you God will bless them anybody who curses you God will curse them because God is protecting his children praise God what would you do with your children would you bless the people you know that bless your children of course because many times in the natural it's a life and death battle especially look at the Jews today getting bombed across the borders of Israel and all the time God's going to bless those who bless Israel he's going to curse those who curse Israel because he's protected his children Hallelujah but this here is God's first word recorded to Abraham and what does he do in verse 4. now thankfully church he doesn't laugh this time but there are times he laughs at God's promise and that's another one of his human mistakes that God looks over aren't you glad God looks over your mistakes Church now we might not laugh at God's promise but we might be discouraged oh God we're never going to Rapture us or God when are you ever going to answer my prayer we might not laugh but we might sulk and complain right there's my hour we might get bitter with God or he might get angry with God but either way it's the same reaction it's unbelief but God will overcome your unbelief God will overcome my unbelief because God is going to finish what he started hallelujah amen God has a plan God has a purpose praise God hallelujah and he works everything out to his purpose verse four and so Abraham departed look he does exactly what God says at the beginning as the Lord has spoken unto him and lot went with him now go to Genesis 17. verse 9. this is in BC 1911. nine years later see at the beginning Abraham just had childlike faith God said leave your family oh and he left and what did that verse later say did he obey God all the way no my wife's got she's she's catching the thought here he took lot with him he disobeyed God he only partially obeyed God Amen now church then I'll encourage you when you got saved the Bible says repent and be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ but sometimes we repent of all of our sins sometimes we didn't right that's why we didn't get the Holy Ghost right away and the church said that's why we didn't get the Holy Ghost right away we still struggle with things in our lives and yet God's grace was still for us amen God's mercy still applied to us God still called us his children praise God that'll make a Methodist y'all that'll make a Baptist shot that'll make a message believer shout praise God hallelujah thank God Amen for the mercy of Jesus Christ Upon Us upon us all thank God verse 9. and God said in Abraham Thou shalt keep my Covenant therefore thou and I see it after the in their generation this is my Covenant which ye shall keep between me and you and thy seed after the every man shout among you shall be circumcised now go down to verse 14. and the uncircumcised Man Child whose flesh of his foreskin is not circumcised that show that Soul rather shall be cut off from his people and he hath broken my Covenant so this was quite a statement if you don't circumcise them they have no part in our covenant that means no forgiveness that means no blessings that means all the curses come upon you so you can see why by the Pharisees kind of got into this legalism well as long as I do the circumcision I'm good with God but then it became the only one of the few things they obeyed right because Jesus said you do ties you do offerings you do circumcision but you've left out judgment Mercy and I think Grace was the other one or righteousness see in other words they were like at a spiritual Buffet I just want to do that in the Bible I just want to do that but I don't want to do all this but we should eat the whole book the Bible says in Revelation 10 John eat the whole book thank you for your patience I'm almost done okay now go back to Romans 4 11 here when did God oh this is beautiful when did God declare Abraham was righteous was it when he finally got the circumcision when did it come verse 10 I'm finishing verse 10 at the very last sense not in circumcision but in uncircumcision in verse 11. and he received the sign of circumcision a seal of the righteousness of the faith which he had yet being uncircumcised so you see that Abraham started serving God at the at the beginning there in 1920 BC he was saved and forgiven right there but nine years later God gives him the seal now you're sealed in this Covenant but he was already righteous way back at the beginning church can I say like this you are already righteous when you first believe in Jesus Christ Amen brother Austin I love how he amended amen praise God Amen Hallelujah I was already righteous before I came in the message when I first got saved at the athletes in action Congress I was already righteous back there praise God but then all these years later God gives me the gift of the Seal of the baptism of the Holy Ghost but I was already forgiven back there I was already God's child but here he just gives a seal that you are my child praise God oh hallelujah thank God Amen in other words you already had the faith at the beginning that you need to take you all the way there and what God finished that same Faith he put at you in the beginning that same faith if you keep feeding it and growing in it will take you all the way home praise God let's stand to our feet by God's grace musicians can come Hallelujah oh my I'm gonna finish that verse that he might be the father of all them that believe though they be not circumcised that righteousness might be imputed unto them also see here Paul is saying you are righteous and saved even before you get the seal hmm hallelujah praise God how can people not see foolish virgins how can they not see it it's right here you're already forgiven before you get the baptism of the Holy Ghost you're already forgiven you're already righteous in the sight of God how many are thankful for the righteousness of Christ today let's bow our heads here as we pray church I don't know what spoke to you today I trust something from the word of God spoke to today maybe it was just a word of encouragement maybe it was just a fresh reminder of how God is gracious to you Hallelujah I just want you to know churches like Abraham Abraham was righteous nine years before he got the Seal of the token he was already righteous God gave it to him without that still God gave him total forgiveness total remission of sins hallelujah thank God and so church that ought to encourage us no matter where we are on our our walk with the Lord as soon as we believed and obeyed even partially Hallelujah Jesus imputed his righteousness for us and then yes we must walk on and he'll give us signs and visions and Direction and understanding and and testimonies and healings and victories all these things and then he gives us the seal the token in our souls but we must remember Hallelujah that we are righteous when we first believed by the grace of God in church you all of you know Ephesians 1 verse 4. that even before we were saved we were chosen in the mind of Christ before the foundation of the world oh Hallelujah how many are thankful that you're in God's plan church we should be so grateful God is writing our story and he's going to finish it if he started it he's going to finish it just like he did Abraham's just like he did David's let's have a word of prayer today Father God we thank you for the word of God that's been preached we thank you for the songs that we've sung Lord God in preparation for this word Lord no doubt you put on brother amen's heart that we can sing I can sing of this love forever amen This Love that chose me before the foundation of the world love that called me out spiritually out of my spiritual life just like he called Abraham This Love That Forgives me when I make mistakes just like you forgave David his mistakes what Mercy what love what Grace Lord God thank you that this blessedness comes upon the circumcision and the uncircumcision the Jew and the Gentile upon all those who believe Lord I pray servants would anchor the people's souls and your promises they'll know their children of God they'll know that they're blessed and yet Lord also be able to accept a chastisement except the correction from their father to all those that you love [Music] correct granted Lord Jesus Lord we want to thank you God for 17 years shining here in Akron where Souls can come and hear the word of God about the truth it's got me my family all these Saints for 17 years now we
