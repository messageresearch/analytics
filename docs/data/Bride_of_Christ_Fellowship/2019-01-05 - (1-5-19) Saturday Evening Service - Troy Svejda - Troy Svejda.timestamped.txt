[38:03] amen it was god bless his saints it's
[38:05] good to see each and every one of you
[38:06] here this evening I praise the Lord I
[38:09] know he'll have something special for
[38:11] you tonight
[38:11] amen amen that's one thing about the
[38:14] Lord he knows he gave us a promise he
[38:16] said that wherever two or three are
[38:19] gathered in my name and he was looking
[38:21] down on through the future when he said
[38:23] that amen because he news the end from
[38:25] the beginning so he gave out that
[38:27] promise knowing that he'd be able to
[38:29] fulfill that promise
[38:31] amen so he said he prophesied he
[38:33] promised that wherever two or three are
[38:35] gathered in my name all the way on down
[38:37] through history I will come right there
[38:39] in the midst of them and think about
[38:42] whenever he comes he heals when he comes
[38:45] he delivers and it comes accessory
[38:47] whoever will open their hearts to him he
[38:50] will come he has a blessing for you
[38:52] tonight
[38:52] amen if you'll just open your heart for
[38:54] me it's possible because he promised it
[38:57] amen amen so as we turn our Bibles to
[39:01] the book of first Corinthians chapter
[39:03] four I got a message from the smart this
[39:10] evening that you know everyone swell
[39:13] yeah your preach a sermon you just
[39:14] really struggle to put a title to it you
[39:17] know and you know what the sermon is but
[39:19] to put a title there's just so many
[39:20] different things you could call it will
[39:23] call this tithes and offerings but in
[39:27] reality it goes a lot deeper than that
[39:29] for a secondary tile I guess we call it
[39:31] forsaking all amen so 1st Corinthians
[39:35] chapter 4 we'll start with the sixth
[39:39] verse and going down to the tenth verse
[39:40] it says and these things brethren this
[39:44] is Paul speaking I have in a figure
[39:47] transferred to myself and Apollo's for
[39:50] your sakes that you might learn in us
[39:52] not to think of men above that which is
[39:55] written that no one of you be puffed up
[39:58] for one against the other for who maketh
[40:01] thee to differ from another and what
[40:04] hast thou that thou dis not receive now
[40:08] if thou dis receive it why does thou
[40:10] glory if thou has not received it
[40:13] think about that everything that we have
[40:14] we cannot glory in it because we know
[40:17] where we got everything that we own we
[40:20] got it from the Lord Himself amen now ye
[40:22] are full now year rich you have reigned
[40:26] as kings without us and I would to God
[40:29] that she did reign that we also might
[40:31] reign with you for I think that God hath
[40:34] set for us set forth us the Apostles
[40:37] last as were appointed to death for we
[40:40] are made a spectacle under the world and
[40:42] angels and men and we are fools for
[40:46] Christ's sake but you're wise in Christ
[40:48] we are weak but ye are strong you're
[40:52] honorable but we are despised a man one
[40:56] more scripture will go over to the book
[40:57] of Genesis chapter 12 Genesis 12 and
[41:03] we'll read the first two the third verse
[41:05] and then we'll power has a word of
[41:08] Prayer Genesis 12 verse 1 and it says
[41:17] now the Lord had said unto Abram get
[41:21] thee out of thy country and from thy
[41:24] kindred and from thy father's house unto
[41:27] a land that I will show thee and I will
[41:31] make of thee a great nation I'll bless
[41:36] thee and I will make thy name great and
[41:38] thou shalt be a blessing and I'll bless
[41:41] them that bless thee and curse
[41:42] him that curseth thee and in thee shall
[41:45] all the families of the earth be blessed
[41:49] hey missus bar has an order prayer
[41:52] Heavenly Father we just wanted to invite
[41:55] you into this room just now Lord
[41:57] according to a promise that you gave us
[41:59] two thousand years ago that you said
[42:02] Lord in your word when you spoke that
[42:04] promise that wherever two or three are
[42:06] gathered in your name Lord that you come
[42:09] right there in the midst of them and
[42:10] lorda we just want to thank you for
[42:12] coming into this room this tonight Lord
[42:14] though we know that look if there be any
[42:16] needs upon the hearts of the believers
[42:18] father that we pray Lord that you
[42:20] carefully consider those needs according
[42:23] to your promise and according to the
[42:24] blood that you shed for us and lord I
[42:27] pray father if there be any questions
[42:29] upon the hearts of the people tonight
[42:30] father that may be through the preaching
[42:32] of the word that you would just answer
[42:34] those questions and be a blessing under
[42:37] the people father because Lord every
[42:38] time you speak we are blessed and we
[42:41] love your word father and so we just
[42:43] turned the service over into your hands
[42:45] lord have thine own way just now in the
[42:49] name of the Lord Jesus Christ we pray
[42:51] amen okay man you can be seated amen our
[43:01] father Abraham he was the father of the
[43:03] faith amen and you know there's one
[43:06] thing about Abraham is he had such a
[43:09] strong belief you know anybody that has
[43:12] had a few experiences with the Lord they
[43:15] begin to get to this place in the Lord
[43:17] where they just believe they've seen God
[43:20] do so much that they just begin to
[43:23] believe that God could do anything you
[43:26] know and that's just a really good place
[43:28] to be a man you know eyes flying over
[43:31] here from Des Moines Iowa and we went to
[43:36] Atlanta first and we flew from a land up
[43:38] to Cleveland and there was a lady
[43:41] sitting now when we got to Atlanta we
[43:44] were looking at our boarding passes for
[43:45] the next leg of the flight and my son
[43:48] and I were going to be separated from
[43:49] each other they weren't gonna be sitting
[43:51] next to each other and I really was you
[43:53] know to be sitting with my son so
[43:57] so we went up and it's just right before
[44:00] boarding we went up to the lowly gate
[44:02] agent the ticket agent there and but the
[44:05] gate and and I asked lady yes I know
[44:07] it's kind of late to be asking this
[44:09] because there's people are lined up for
[44:10] boarding and I said you know and there's
[44:13] a full flight and I was like my son I
[44:15] would like to sit next to each other is
[44:17] there something you can do and she
[44:19] looked and she moved somebody else to
[44:23] give us and completely we were gonna be
[44:25] in 3438 and she moved us up to the row
[44:28] 15 so that we could sit next to her and
[44:31] there was three seats there there's me
[44:33] and my son and then someone else and so
[44:36] we we we get up to get on the plane and
[44:39] we were walking towards our row and
[44:40] there's a an elderly lady there and
[44:43] she's sitting there and and she looked
[44:47] up and she moved for us so we can get in
[44:49] and sit next to the window there and and
[44:51] she set back down and and I told her she
[44:55] asked what we were doing and I Ohio and
[44:57] I told her you know we're come here to
[44:58] preach and and she she said you know
[45:03] normally I hate to travel alone you know
[45:05] I just every time I fly I always have a
[45:07] companion with me and and I was scared
[45:09] to fly by myself so at home I just got
[45:12] down on my knees I was asking Lord Lord
[45:14] just gifts let me have someone really
[45:17] nice sit next on the way and right
[45:22] before we got on the Lord the agent
[45:25] moved someone away from her and put us
[45:27] in that spot and that lady had a
[45:30] relationship with the Lord she had a
[45:33] need
[45:33] she had a desire upon her heart that she
[45:36] wanted to she didn't get to have a
[45:37] travel companion so she prayed that the
[45:40] Lord would give her a travel companion
[45:41] and so it's Lord somehow saw fit to have
[45:44] me be her travel companion for that leg
[45:46] of the trip amen I just it was just it
[45:49] reminds me of that whenever we have a
[45:51] need of something and you and you've
[45:53] seen God do something for you in the
[45:55] past it just gives you a certain faith
[45:57] to know that God will do something for
[45:58] you in the future
[45:59] amen and the same thing with Abraham
[46:02] here you know I really don't know what
[46:05] Abraham's early life was like I don't
[46:08] know why it is
[46:10] when God first called him that there's
[46:12] something that struck on his heart that
[46:14] says I have to answer this call I have
[46:17] to go and go with what this call is
[46:19] calling yonas call said get thee out of
[46:22] thy father's house get the away from my
[46:24] father's kindred don't go and follow in
[46:27] your father's way don't go and worship
[46:28] at your father's simple don't go and do
[46:30] all those things but I want you to
[46:32] separate yourself from your father's
[46:34] household and go into a land that I will
[46:36] show you and there I will bless you
[46:39] and so Abraham had to forsake all that
[46:43] he knew all that was familiar to him all
[46:46] that he was used to all that he had and
[46:49] he had seen in times past where men
[46:52] would grow old and they would die and
[46:55] they give an inheritance to their sons
[46:56] and so Abraham you know in the pattern
[46:59] of life is that he'd have the
[47:01] inheritance of his father his father's
[47:03] land his father's people his his
[47:05] extended family his answer his uncles
[47:07] his cousins you know there would be that
[47:09] support group you know that you would
[47:10] have him you worship and his father's
[47:12] temple you know and all those things but
[47:13] he left all of that behind to follow
[47:17] this voice that promised him another
[47:22] inheritance so he gave up on his own
[47:25] father's inheritance and received a new
[47:27] father by the name of Jehovah and he
[47:30] left that behind he forsook all
[47:33] forsaking all and went into the promised
[47:35] land amen amen
[47:37] what a what a you know there's it's just
[47:41] us human nature that you know when
[47:45] people come in to Christianity when
[47:47] people come to Christ a lot of times
[47:49] it's just human nature that they like to
[47:51] come halfway they want to come halfway
[47:54] you know they want to hold on to this
[47:56] over here and then go into Christ and
[47:58] see how close to Christ they can get
[48:00] while still holding on to something back
[48:03] over here amen but but the reality is is
[48:06] Christ asks us to forsake all he asks us
[48:09] to leave our past behind and go and move
[48:13] into the Lord Jesus Christ amen and to
[48:16] make that clean separation that the
[48:17] things you know like when they left
[48:18] Egypt they are leaving Egypt behind they
[48:21] went through the Red Sea and God purpose
[48:23] we took him through a way that they
[48:25] couldn't go back amen because God says
[48:28] you know I could lead him up through the
[48:30] other way over here where they might go
[48:31] through war but I'm afraid they'll get
[48:33] scared and try to go back so I'm gonna
[48:34] take him through the wilderness and
[48:35] right up to the Red Sea and he parts the
[48:38] Red Sea and goes through they couldn't
[48:40] go back he had a clean break away from
[48:42] Egypt and so is a soweth when if God has
[48:45] ever called you let me tell you that's a
[48:47] blessing if God ever speaks to your
[48:51] heart that's a blessing yo there's a lot
[48:54] of people out this heart on this earth
[48:56] have never heard anything
[48:58] amen there's a lot of people in the if
[49:00] you were out tone you said has God ever
[49:02] spoken to you they'd laugh in your face
[49:05] there are people that say I don't
[49:07] believe there is such a creature as this
[49:08] God I don't believe there is such a
[49:10] being as this God and you know there's a
[49:12] lot of people who say those things you
[49:13] know and they'll say oh god I have all
[49:15] kinds of things they believe about God
[49:16] but if you are sitting here in this room
[49:18] tonight
[49:18] and you as some time in the past have
[49:21] felt the very first time you felt God
[49:24] call and call your heart and call you a
[49:26] fake come be my son to come be my
[49:29] daughter
[49:29] let me tell you that is a blessing
[49:31] knowing everybody has received that amen
[49:35] and when you if you ever once receive
[49:38] that call that pole on your heart to
[49:40] come then let me tell you answer that
[49:42] quickly
[49:43] don't let that pass you by because that
[49:46] is a blessing well the Bible is full of
[49:49] examples there are not just not just
[49:52] examples from thousands of years ago
[49:55] that can never happen again but the
[49:57] Bible is full examples of people that
[49:59] heard that call upon their heart and
[50:01] they answered it and look at the things
[50:03] that they did they saw the Dead come
[50:05] back to life a man they saw people that
[50:07] get healed and delivered a man they saw
[50:10] sees past a man there's people that
[50:12] didn't even die they walked right up
[50:14] into glory like Enoch you know there's
[50:16] just the Bible is full of testimonies of
[50:18] things that people have experienced
[50:19] because when God called them they
[50:22] answered that call and it calls for
[50:25] forsaking all this path calls for
[50:28] forsaking all
[50:30] amen you know when abraham when he he
[50:34] gave up his father's inheritance
[50:37] everything that he could have maybe
[50:39] naturally expected in life he gave all
[50:42] that up and he followed this call to go
[50:44] into this land the land that jehovah
[50:46] showed him amen and jehovah became his
[50:51] father and Jehovah you know in John 1:12
[50:57] says but as many as received him to them
[50:59] he gave the power to become the sons and
[51:03] daughters of God amen now you think you
[51:06] know it right now if any one of you went
[51:08] up to your mom or your dad and you said
[51:09] oh oh you know I wish that you would you
[51:12] know I need this or I need that you know
[51:14] you hear stories you know we need to
[51:16] learn so hard times Lois Imani or you
[51:18] know your you know your your parents you
[51:21] know most the times will help you upon
[51:23] life's road if you have a hard need or
[51:25] something you're in rough battle your
[51:27] parents can help you out amen but how
[51:29] much more so is it that the God Himself
[51:32] says I will give you the Holy Ghost if
[51:34] you ask
[51:35] amen amen so now let's turn over to
[51:43] Genesis chapter 14
[51:47] Genesis chapter 14 you know as Abraham
[51:51] as he went into this promised land he
[51:54] just kept having more and more
[51:56] experiences with Jehovah amen and his
[52:00] faith would go higher and higher and
[52:02] higher amen
[52:04] a sword of Genesis chapter 14 verse
[52:08] verse 17 how he is familiar with the
[52:12] story of the Battle of the Kings amen
[52:16] now if you remember Abraham and his and
[52:19] his nephew lot they go into the Promised
[52:21] Land amen lot goes and looks at the
[52:25] looks at the land of Sodom and decides
[52:27] to go off and live in the land of Sodom
[52:29] where Abraham is staying up on the hill
[52:32] with Jehovah amen
[52:34] a lot chose his place and Abraham chose
[52:37] his place and so as as as law is living
[52:42] there in Sodom
[52:43] there was all sudden there was a war
[52:45] that went on Amen and Sodom ended up
[52:48] being on the losing side of that war and
[52:52] and the conquering our armies took all
[52:55] Sodom all their goods and went through
[52:59] their houses that took all their gold
[53:00] all their silver all their cattle
[53:02] everything that they had and and took
[53:04] even took lot as a prisoner to be a
[53:07] slave amen
[53:08] and they took him and they started going
[53:10] back to where that army had come from
[53:13] and lot was now a prisoner amen and you
[53:17] know Abraham is up on the hill having
[53:20] experiences with Jehovah amen he is he
[53:24] is now is no longer Abraham or a he's no
[53:28] longer Abram of Terah but now he is
[53:31] Abram of the Most High God amen he is
[53:34] now becoming a son of God amen not just
[53:37] a son of Terah but behavor is now up
[53:40] there on the hill he's becoming a son of
[53:42] God amen you know someone asked me a
[53:44] long time ago you know they told me that
[53:46] they they were chastising me for for
[53:50] believing in predestination you know and
[53:53] they just you know they just couldn't
[53:55] have it and and then so I just sighs we
[53:58] were sitting there at a coffee shop and
[54:00] I asked him I says well when do you
[54:01] think Abraham was saved you know was do
[54:06] you think the Abraham was saved when he
[54:07] met Melchizedek or perhaps do you think
[54:11] that maybe he was saved you know when he
[54:13] crossed over the River Jordan or was he
[54:17] saved when he gave ties on to
[54:19] Melchizedek or was he saved when he got
[54:22] received the call back there in her end
[54:25] or good know Abraham what point in his
[54:28] Abraham's life was he saying God had
[54:31] chosen Abraham before the foundation of
[54:33] the world
[54:34] amen and God knew exactly is waiting on
[54:37] down through history of every generation
[54:39] until there was a blend of qualities
[54:42] that was just right he needed a man like
[54:44] Abraham to be the father of the faith
[54:45] amen
[54:46] God knew exactly who Abraham was gonna
[54:49] be you know exactly what kind of person
[54:50] he was gonna be and he was just waiting
[54:53] for time for the for all the things that
[54:56] he had put in the human
[54:57] to come to a special blend so he could
[54:59] have a special man that he could put his
[55:01] hand upon and use a manual Eve God you
[55:05] know God did the same thing with you
[55:07] amen he's done the same thing with you
[55:10] amen so Abraham is up here on the hill a
[55:12] man and he's he's been following this
[55:15] Jehovah amen he's becoming more like
[55:18] this Java man and now he's getting that
[55:21] he has an opportunity to display the
[55:24] attributes of Jehovah down on the inside
[55:26] his head nephew as beings there's been
[55:29] taken away as as a slave going down
[55:33] going down into the enemy territory and
[55:35] was he do he goes off after him to safe
[55:37] his cousin the safe his nephew amen so
[55:41] verse 17 it says and the king of Sodom
[55:44] this is Genesis 14 17 and the king of
[55:47] saw it and went out to meet him after
[55:49] his return from the slaughter of Chalmer
[55:52] and of the Kings are with him in the
[55:54] valley of shaveh
[55:55] which is the king's Dale I watch this
[55:57] and Melchizedek king of Salem brought
[55:59] forth bread and wine and he was the
[56:02] priest of the Most High God and He
[56:04] blessed him and said blessed be Abram of
[56:07] the Most High God possessor of heaven
[56:11] and earth now I wonder if Abraham knew
[56:15] that before before this moment in time
[56:19] I wonder if Abraham knew this or if this
[56:22] was the first time Abraham began to
[56:24] realize here's this man Melchizedek he
[56:29] has no father no mother no beginning of
[56:33] days no end of life he sitting there
[56:35] speaking to him he says blessed are you
[56:40] of the Most High God
[56:42] none of Terah not Abram of Terah but
[56:45] Abram of the Most High God
[56:47] blessed are you you are the possessor of
[56:50] heaven and earth now I don't know about
[56:54] you but that would do something for me
[56:56] you know it has done something for me
[56:59] possessor of heaven on earth Amen all
[57:01] things were his Amen he was cut from one
[57:04] is he had he had rejected all of his
[57:06] past he laid everything down and now
[57:09] there's a
[57:09] patient has come to him he's Italy's
[57:12] that has his audience with Java a man
[57:15] has his audience with God in the flesh
[57:17] and God in the flesh is telling them you
[57:19] are the possessor of heaven on earth you
[57:23] are my son you this is your inheritance
[57:25] amen he gave up everything to follow me
[57:29] and now I am beginning to reveal unto
[57:31] you your inheritance
[57:32] hey man what is he doing he begins to
[57:34] act like Christ he goes down saves lot
[57:36] now after the battle is over remember
[57:40] what happened now after the battles or
[57:42] what happened Abraham and all the kings
[57:46] that he saved he saved all their
[57:48] household goods and all their gold and
[57:50] their silver and he brought it back and
[57:51] they try to offer something to him now
[57:55] let's go down to the end of the chapter
[57:56] here's I'm just building something up
[57:57] here real quick as they met there let's
[58:08] go down to we'll just read down the neck
[58:16] Mercer verse 20 and blessed be the Most
[58:19] High God which hath delivered thine
[58:21] enemies into thy hand and he gave him
[58:23] tithes of all so if something about this
[58:26] visitation that caused Abraham to pay
[58:29] his tithing there's something about this
[58:32] visitation that caused Abraham to give
[58:34] tithes on milk a Tzadik a man will get
[58:37] that into later on amen and the king of
[58:40] Sodom sent Abram give me the persons and
[58:43] take the goods to thyself he's trying to
[58:45] give Abraham a reward and Abraham said
[58:48] to the king of Sodom I have lifted up my
[58:50] hand under the Lord and to the Most High
[58:52] God the possessor of heaven and earth
[58:54] that I will not take from a thread even
[58:57] to a shoe latch it and I will not take
[58:59] anything that is thine lest thou should
[59:02] say I have made Abraham rich save only
[59:05] that we'll just operate there I I don't
[59:08] want to take anything from you because I
[59:10] don't want you to have any opportunity
[59:11] to say that I have made Abraham rich
[59:13] I have lifted my hand unto Jehovah God
[59:17] is my provider everything that I have
[59:20] has come from Jehovah everything that I
[59:22] want everything that I desire he is the
[59:24] possessor of heaven earth I am now of I
[59:28] am now have his inheritance that he has
[59:31] made me a possessor of heaven and earth
[59:32] they meant everywhere I go every old
[59:35] footsteps I go everywhere I go is mine
[59:37] everything if I want something I asked
[59:39] the Lord he gives it to me
[59:40] amen and so now he so so when the kings
[59:44] of saw him says comes up to give him an
[59:46] offering to give him something he says I
[59:48] don't want anything to do with it
[59:49] I've rejected all this treasure of her
[59:52] I've rejected all the treasure of my
[59:54] father I've heard no I'm rejecting all
[59:57] the treasure of Sodom I don't want any
[59:58] part of it why because I have one father
[1:00:00] that is God amen I have one that want
[1:00:03] one this that has called me one that has
[1:00:06] saved me and that is the one that'll
[1:00:08] lift my hand - he is my source he is my
[1:00:10] deliverer he is my comforter he is the
[1:00:13] one that has given my daily bread he is
[1:00:15] the one that heals me when I'm sick he's
[1:00:17] the one that delivers me he's the one
[1:00:18] that keeps me and he is the only one
[1:00:20] that gives me anything that I have need
[1:00:22] of amen Abraham knew where he stood a
[1:00:26] man be good for all of us to know where
[1:00:27] we stand he meant
[1:00:29] let me tell you if you have something
[1:00:31] need of you know ask him Amen ask him
[1:00:35] the more we ask him the more we receive
[1:00:37] and it raises our faith in Him blessed
[1:00:43] be Abram of the Most High God possessor
[1:00:45] of heaven and earth what an inheritance
[1:00:49] you know we have a supernatural
[1:00:51] inheritance as we when we were called
[1:00:56] when that call first came across your
[1:00:59] life maybe we didn't know it at that
[1:01:01] time what God was gonna call us unto but
[1:01:04] God has not called us just to live a
[1:01:06] natural life on this earth
[1:01:08] Amen you know we are sons and daughters
[1:01:11] of Abraham yes amen we have an
[1:01:16] inheritance for us now if Abraham could
[1:01:19] separate himself from all the from the
[1:01:22] world and all the things of the world
[1:01:23] and go into the land that God showed him
[1:01:26] and what did that do it caused a
[1:01:29] visitation it caused a visitation you
[1:01:33] know all of us are do a visitation when
[1:01:38] you reject the world and the things of
[1:01:39] the world it should cause a visitation
[1:01:42] every single one of us is do a
[1:01:44] visitation to where when you get away
[1:01:47] from the world the things of the world
[1:01:48] you separate yourself and you and you
[1:01:51] get alone with God you are doing
[1:01:53] cetacean it's got to happen why it's got
[1:01:56] happened that's what we call being
[1:01:57] filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:01:59] we're caught you where there is a
[1:02:00] calling that that once you once you're
[1:02:03] called God wants to fill you with
[1:02:04] himself he wants to deliver he wants to
[1:02:06] keep you he wants to be with he wants to
[1:02:08] walk with you he wants you to be his
[1:02:09] temple
[1:02:10] amen to walk with day in and day out
[1:02:12] yeah amen
[1:02:18] let's turn over in her Bibles to mark
[1:02:21] chapter 10
[1:02:38] mark Chen there's this there's a story
[1:02:42] of the rich young ruler and this this
[1:02:49] first versed in this and this story is
[1:02:54] just amazing to me when you read mark
[1:02:59] 10:17 let's read it it says and when he
[1:03:03] Jesus was gone forth into the way there
[1:03:07] came one running and kneeled to him and
[1:03:13] asked him good master what shall I do
[1:03:17] that I may inherit eternal life now any
[1:03:22] one of us if we were to see that happen
[1:03:24] we would look at that man we say that
[1:03:26] man is gonna be a real good Christian
[1:03:30] think about it running
[1:03:33] he came running to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:36] it came running to the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:03:39] we'd all put our hands over heart like
[1:03:41] oh my I know what's getting ready to
[1:03:42] happen when a man comes running to the
[1:03:46] altar we know what's gonna happen we
[1:03:50] think oh praise God another one saved
[1:03:53] now let's watch he kneeled to the Lord
[1:03:57] Jesus Christ and he asked him he said
[1:03:59] good master what shall I do that I may
[1:04:01] inherit eternal life you know anytime
[1:04:05] you ask the Lord Jesus Christ a question
[1:04:08] like this you know that he'll answer you
[1:04:11] amen so so this man asked the Lord Jesus
[1:04:15] Christ how do i inherit eternal life so
[1:04:17] well now what he's doing answer a ment
[1:04:21] he asked in all good honesty he asked
[1:04:23] this question and good honest faith amen
[1:04:26] and he when he went to the Lord he asked
[1:04:28] him how can I inherit eternal life so
[1:04:30] this man is now do an answer so what
[1:04:33] does the Lord Jesus do he has to contact
[1:04:35] his spirit he
[1:04:37] this man ran to the word he ran to the
[1:04:41] word he asked the word what can I do to
[1:04:44] inherit eternal life now the word is
[1:04:46] gonna respond back the word has to go
[1:04:49] down into his heart down into his soul
[1:04:51] and discern and find out where the
[1:04:54] problem is say well what problem was
[1:04:58] there this man didn't have eternal life
[1:05:01] that was the problem
[1:05:03] amen he should have eternal life amen
[1:05:07] this man was a child of Abraham amen he
[1:05:10] was living in the promised land amen he
[1:05:13] should have eternal life he shouldn't
[1:05:16] hate being a hair of the land amen he
[1:05:18] should have eternal life but he comes
[1:05:20] running up to the word he comes running
[1:05:22] up to Melchizedek he comes running up to
[1:05:24] Jesus Christ amen
[1:05:25] and it says good master what shall I do
[1:05:28] that I may inherit eternal life
[1:05:30] now the eternal life himself has to
[1:05:33] answer back and tell him what the
[1:05:35] problem is
[1:05:37] amen so he sold no Street on further
[1:05:40] Jesus Jean and Jesus said unto verse 18
[1:05:42] why call us thou me good there is none
[1:05:47] good but one that is God thou knowest
[1:05:49] the commandments do not commit adultery
[1:05:52] do not kill do not steal do not bear
[1:05:55] false witness defraud not honour thy
[1:05:57] father and thy mother amen but you know
[1:06:00] for all that this didn't answer his
[1:06:02] question Jesus is discerning his sphere
[1:06:05] here discern his spirit it didn't answer
[1:06:07] it didn't give them any peace didn't
[1:06:08] give me a rest and the worst when he
[1:06:10] says and he answer he said to a master
[1:06:13] all these things I have observed from my
[1:06:15] youth and then jesus beholding him loved
[1:06:18] him and said unto him now look the word
[1:06:23] has discerned where the trouble was yes
[1:06:28] the word where the problem was
[1:06:30] the word discerned it as answering back
[1:06:32] and says one thing thou lackest
[1:06:37] man if you lacked just one thing
[1:06:40] wouldn't that be a blessing to know what
[1:06:41] it was amen
[1:06:44] one thing thou lackest go thy way sell
[1:06:47] whatsoever thou hast and give to the
[1:06:50] poor
[1:06:51] and now shall have treasure in heaven
[1:06:52] and come take up that cross and follow
[1:06:56] me and he was sad at that saying and
[1:06:59] went away grieved for he had great
[1:07:01] possessions the word discerned that this
[1:07:05] man could not forsake all he couldn't do
[1:07:09] it now his father Abraham forsook all
[1:07:13] his father Abraham went before and told
[1:07:16] the testified under the king of Sodom I
[1:07:19] have lifted up my hand unto Jehovah and
[1:07:22] I will not take anything from you from
[1:07:25] the world or the things of the world
[1:07:26] lest the world should say that I have
[1:07:29] made you rich but I have lifted my hand
[1:07:31] unto Jehovah amen and what do what God
[1:07:34] say God has swung back to him in Genesis
[1:07:36] 51 I am nice exceeding great reward amen
[1:07:39] the word know when when now let's go
[1:07:42] back to Genesis let's just read that
[1:07:43] real quick we're on a hurry are we
[1:07:47] amen amen
[1:07:54] injustice 14 22 it says and Abra's said
[1:07:58] no ada was speaking to the king of Sodom
[1:08:01] he says an abram said to the king of
[1:08:03] sodom i have lift my hand unto jehovah
[1:08:06] unto the Lord and the Most High God the
[1:08:10] possessor of heaven and earth that I
[1:08:12] will not take from a thread even to a
[1:08:15] shoe latchet and that I will not take
[1:08:18] anything the design lest you should say
[1:08:20] I have made a more rich let's go to the
[1:08:24] next chapter 15 verse 1 it says after
[1:08:27] these things the word of the Lord came
[1:08:29] unto Abram in a vision so what got the
[1:08:32] word Salwa abram said and now the word
[1:08:35] is responding amen
[1:08:37] they said said it to Abram in a vision
[1:08:39] saying fear not Abram I am thy shield
[1:08:41] and I exceeding great reward my he had
[1:08:48] met the possessor of heaven and earth
[1:08:49] the possessor of heaven earth is
[1:08:51] responding back to him he says I am
[1:08:53] thine I everything I have is yours you
[1:08:56] know now Abraham is beginning to realize
[1:08:58] the longer has he just the son of Terah
[1:09:01] but he has become again being given
[1:09:04] power
[1:09:04] to become a son of God and so to all
[1:09:08] those that believe on the Lord Jesus
[1:09:10] Christ and this day to them the God
[1:09:12] gives the power to become the sons and
[1:09:14] daughters of God amen
[1:09:16] so this rich young ruler what'd he do he
[1:09:19] went away sad for he had great
[1:09:21] possessions he wouldn't do what his
[1:09:23] father Abraham did his father Abraham
[1:09:27] forsook everything lifted his hand up to
[1:09:30] Jehovah but here comes the rich young
[1:09:32] ruler who was a son of Abraham living in
[1:09:35] the promised land of Abraham but he
[1:09:37] would not do the acts of his father
[1:09:41] Abraham the acts of his father Abraham
[1:09:44] he would not - Amen no now let's now now
[1:09:47] think about it number whomever's the
[1:09:49] story of Zacchaeus now Zacchaeus also
[1:09:53] received a similar visitation just like
[1:09:55] this rich young ruler a man Zacchaeus
[1:09:57] was up in the tree amen and that Lord
[1:10:00] Jesus Christ is walking by he's hiding
[1:10:03] himself in the leaves and all sudden
[1:10:05] Jesus looks up and it calls him by name
[1:10:08] knows what his name is a man knows that
[1:10:10] kiss was a Jew was a son of Abraham he
[1:10:14] was living in the promised land and and
[1:10:17] the word comes and walks by his way the
[1:10:20] word looks up as that kiss and says that
[1:10:23] kiyose come down I must eat with you
[1:10:27] this night and and Zacchaeus runs down
[1:10:30] out of the tree receives Jesus Christ
[1:10:33] into his own house and with joy receives
[1:10:36] the word and now look when where what
[1:10:39] Zacchaeus say he said Lord the half of
[1:10:43] my goods I give to the poor now why is
[1:10:47] it that the rich young ruler had to give
[1:10:50] up everything
[1:10:51] Bizet kiyose only had to give half why
[1:10:55] is that because that Kia said are
[1:10:59] already given up everything the moment
[1:11:01] that Zacchaeus received the Lord Jesus
[1:11:03] Christ at the table look the word knew
[1:11:06] in his heart this man has given up all
[1:11:11] this man gave up all I think about it
[1:11:14] that it wasn't a problem for Zacchaeus
[1:11:18] everything got the word already had
[1:11:21] discerned that the Zacchaeus being a
[1:11:24] rich man they meant that Zacchaeus a
[1:11:26] businessman there's the word already had
[1:11:29] discerned that the word had possession
[1:11:32] of all Zacchaeus amen the word had
[1:11:36] possession of all of Zacchaeus but when
[1:11:38] the rich young ruler ramped to the word
[1:11:40] the word discerned that he couldn't get
[1:11:42] possession of zakian of the rich young
[1:11:45] ruler amen
[1:11:47] so the word called out the problem in
[1:11:49] the rich young ruler what was that kiss
[1:11:51] there was no problem Amen or lady put it
[1:11:55] this way
[1:11:56] Zacchaeus answered his own word problem
[1:11:58] heed what he if I have taken anything
[1:12:01] from anyone I will restore to him
[1:12:03] fourfold amen
[1:12:06] Zacchaeus immediately upon meeting the
[1:12:08] word gave up all what was what what was
[1:12:11] that kiss doing he's testifying I like
[1:12:14] my father Abraham and lifting my hand to
[1:12:18] Jehovah he had received a visitation of
[1:12:21] the word in his house amen and the word
[1:12:24] responded back and the word and
[1:12:27] Zacchaeus were in communion one with the
[1:12:29] other and Zacchaeus laid everything down
[1:12:31] and proved that he was a son of Abraham
[1:12:36] by doing the acts of Abraham Amen now
[1:12:40] remember her act
[1:12:41] you know Abraham went to save his
[1:12:43] brother or to save his nephew he was
[1:12:45] showing that Christ was in his life so
[1:12:47] does every single one of us when we
[1:12:49] receive that call of God in our lives we
[1:12:52] must come to the place where we start
[1:12:54] displaying the Lord Jesus Christ on the
[1:12:56] inside amen but we can only do that when
[1:12:59] we forsake all they meant now people
[1:13:03] they can they can do what the rich young
[1:13:05] ruler did come running to the altar they
[1:13:09] can kneel before the Lord they can say
[1:13:12] oh good master they can sing the songs
[1:13:15] but if they do not forsake all it cannot
[1:13:19] be a son of Abraham can't do it amen
[1:13:23] they cannot be as a received inheritance
[1:13:26] of their father
[1:13:29] amen amen you know there's something
[1:13:38] about that visit know what why do we pay
[1:13:41] our tithing let's go back to the subject
[1:13:43] of tithing why do we pay our tithing
[1:13:47] there's something about that visitation
[1:13:50] that Abraham had when he he'd followed
[1:13:55] Jehovah he'd received the call of
[1:13:58] Jehovah but at the very point that he
[1:14:02] entered into the promised land Eve went
[1:14:04] where Jehovah told him to go and then he
[1:14:07] received a visitation of Jehovah in the
[1:14:09] flesh amen
[1:14:12] and yeah that is a blessing this is like
[1:14:14] the culmination think about it think
[1:14:16] about it if all think about was when you
[1:14:18] when did you first receive Christ think
[1:14:22] back to when you first received Christ
[1:14:24] you when you when you first receive
[1:14:26] Christ you didn't necessarily know all
[1:14:29] that the Lord was gonna do in your life
[1:14:30] amen will neither did Abraham a man but
[1:14:34] he just knew I'm gonna follow this call
[1:14:36] I'm gonna follow this call let me tell
[1:14:38] you one night when I received the Lord
[1:14:39] Jesus Christ I didn't know that see all
[1:14:42] to see the healings I've seen I didn't
[1:14:44] know I would see all the deliverances
[1:14:46] that I've seen I didn't know I get to
[1:14:48] see Jesus Christ in action like I've
[1:14:50] seen him amen I didn't know all that but
[1:14:53] you know I've received visitations of
[1:14:55] Christ I've seen him I've I felt his
[1:14:57] presence I've I've come into the room
[1:14:59] I've had a meet me in my car I've had a
[1:15:01] meet me at the church I've had a meet me
[1:15:04] everywhere I go I've had a meet me at
[1:15:05] work amen
[1:15:06] I've had him meet me while I'm listening
[1:15:08] to tapes I've had him meet me when I'm
[1:15:09] singing the songs and there's been
[1:15:11] visitation after visitation after
[1:15:13] visitation why because the word is
[1:15:15] coming to his son amen the word is
[1:15:18] coming to his son so does he deal with
[1:15:19] you there's something about it that when
[1:15:22] Abraham came into the promised land that
[1:15:25] he received a visitation and when he
[1:15:27] received this visitation it just caused
[1:15:30] him to give up all the to give a token
[1:15:34] to show that he had surrendered all he
[1:15:36] gave up his tithe until the milk isn't
[1:15:39] so now so when the when he gave a tithe
[1:15:43] in the milk
[1:15:43] so now when the children of Israel 400
[1:15:46] years later going to the promised land
[1:15:47] God Institute's this into the law itself
[1:15:51] of tithes and offerings let's go to the
[1:15:53] numbers chapter 4 numbers chapter 18
[1:16:16] numbers 18 verse 20 what the the now
[1:16:23] remember when the children of Israel
[1:16:28] went into the Promised Land they went
[1:16:31] into the Promised Land as twelve tribes
[1:16:34] amen and they were sons of Abraham and
[1:16:40] they've been in Egypt for hundred years
[1:16:43] but that promise of God that that land
[1:16:46] of Israel would belong to the sons of
[1:16:49] Abraham that promise still lived amen
[1:16:53] so what the shirt of Israel were doing
[1:16:55] when they went into the back to the
[1:16:57] promised land after leaving Egypt as
[1:16:58] they're entering back into the
[1:17:00] inheritance that been given unto their
[1:17:03] father Abraham amen they were doing
[1:17:06] inheritance they were they were doing
[1:17:09] inheritance but they so that God owed
[1:17:12] them an inheritance because why because
[1:17:14] God has to fulfill his word amen
[1:17:17] remember when remember when God told
[1:17:19] Abraham he said he met him at the tent
[1:17:22] and he led him out of the tent door he
[1:17:23] says look up into the sky Abraham count
[1:17:27] the stars if you can as many as the
[1:17:32] stars are out there are to be as many as
[1:17:34] your children and he gave that land unto
[1:17:37] Abraham's children go down to the the
[1:17:39] beach or to the desert and count the
[1:17:41] grains of the sand social ABI is like
[1:17:44] into your children and I'll give your
[1:17:46] children that land as an inheritance
[1:17:48] it's yours Abraham it belongs to you and
[1:17:51] to your family to your seed after you
[1:17:55] and 400 years in Egypt couldn't take
[1:17:57] away their inheritance from them amen so
[1:18:01] now here in numbers chapter 20 or
[1:18:03] Numbers chapter 18 they're getting ready
[1:18:04] to go back into the promised land
[1:18:06] they're getting ready to to regain their
[1:18:09] inheritance all twelve tribes to get
[1:18:12] regain the inheritance that that was due
[1:18:15] unto them that was owed to them from
[1:18:17] Jehovah himself but then he come to
[1:18:20] numbers 1820 and the Lord spake unto
[1:18:25] Aaron thou shalt have no inheritance in
[1:18:30] their land that's amazing now think
[1:18:35] about Aaron was a son of Abraham he was
[1:18:38] doing inheritance and now God is
[1:18:41] speaking to him and says you're not
[1:18:43] getting your inheritance my and the Lord
[1:18:47] spake unto Aaron thou shalt have no
[1:18:49] inheritance in their land neither shalt
[1:18:52] thou have any part among them I am thy
[1:18:56] part and 9 inheritance among the
[1:18:59] children of Israel verse 21 and behold I
[1:19:02] have given the children of Levi all the
[1:19:05] tents in Israel for an inheritance for
[1:19:08] their service which they serve even the
[1:19:10] service of the tabernacle of the
[1:19:12] congregation my so God took the aaron
[1:19:17] and his sons and the Levites and all
[1:19:20] their sons and God you know God likes to
[1:19:22] reserve a tenth unto himself a man so
[1:19:26] what'd he do he took a tenth
[1:19:27] I basically almost a tenth of the
[1:19:29] children of Israel and reserve them unto
[1:19:31] himself all the sons of Aaron and all
[1:19:34] the and all of the tribe of Levi and God
[1:19:37] reserved them unto himself and says
[1:19:38] you're not going to inheritance but I am
[1:19:40] your inheritance that was a tithing of
[1:19:43] the people unto God amen and then he
[1:19:45] says but I will give you an inheritance
[1:19:47] a tenth of all the increase of the
[1:19:50] children of Israel tenth of all they
[1:19:51] produce will come unto you and that will
[1:19:54] be your reward now who gave the tithing
[1:19:56] unto the Levites and to the sons of
[1:19:58] Aaron it wasn't that the children of
[1:20:01] Israel gave it to him Jehovah gave it to
[1:20:04] them
[1:20:07] amen they were doing inheritance of the
[1:20:09] land but when they've got into the land
[1:20:11] God told no you are not to have an
[1:20:14] inheritance among slant but I am going
[1:20:17] to give you the tithing as your
[1:20:19] inheritance and I will be your portion
[1:20:21] and I will take care of you
[1:20:23] amen so it wasn't that the children of
[1:20:26] Israel gave the tithing
[1:20:27] to the priests is that God had already
[1:20:30] given the tithing to the priests and so
[1:20:33] the children of Israel are just being
[1:20:35] faithful to do to make manifest what God
[1:20:38] had already done when they pay their
[1:20:40] Titan those are the same thing with us
[1:20:42] when we pay our tithing it's not us
[1:20:45] giving the tenth of our income unto the
[1:20:47] ministry but no we're just giving that
[1:20:50] God already gave our tithing to the
[1:20:52] Ministry but he and we're holding on to
[1:20:55] it and we are just being faithful to
[1:20:57] manifest what God has already done amen
[1:21:00] hey man let's keep reading last couple
[1:21:04] verses here neither must the tongue of
[1:21:06] Israel hits forth come nigh the
[1:21:08] tabernacle of the congregation lest they
[1:21:10] bear sin and die but the Levites shall
[1:21:13] do the service of the tabernacle of the
[1:21:15] congregation and they shall bear their
[1:21:17] iniquity and it shall be a statute
[1:21:19] forever throughout your generations that
[1:21:23] among the children of Israel they shall
[1:21:25] have no inheritance amen they become
[1:21:28] fools for Christ a man like we read in
[1:21:31] the beginning we are fools but we are
[1:21:34] poor but you are rich amen we are
[1:21:36] despised of all men amen amen
[1:21:41] as Paul said I think that God has sent
[1:21:43] the Apostles as last amen amen
[1:21:49] so think about you know the visitors
[1:21:51] what are the ministers do they have a
[1:21:52] right to as we call you know the
[1:21:54] American dream you know to go and do
[1:21:56] this do that but instead they take of
[1:21:58] their time to minister unto the people
[1:22:02] amen
[1:22:07] amen amen
[1:22:10] let's turn over to Ephesians chapter 4
[1:22:14] now before we go into pieces chapter 4
[1:22:32] you know God has always had a dwelling
[1:22:38] place he's always had a place where he
[1:22:41] would meet the people he always had a
[1:22:43] way to communicate to his people amen so
[1:22:49] you know you know in the Garden of Eden
[1:22:51] he had a place where he would meet his
[1:22:53] daughter a man in the tabernacle a
[1:22:55] wilderness he had a place that he would
[1:22:57] meet them amen
[1:22:59] you know and when the temple was built
[1:23:01] he had a place where he could visit with
[1:23:03] the people a many knowing when when
[1:23:06] Jesus Christ was born on the earth he
[1:23:10] was that place where the people were to
[1:23:12] meet God amen amen it was and Jesus
[1:23:15] Christ was filled with the Holy Ghost
[1:23:17] amen he was the Holy Ghost he was the
[1:23:20] Spirit of God brooding over the earth
[1:23:23] again amen brooding over the people
[1:23:24] again amen and so but when I when the
[1:23:27] wind you know and what he do he drew
[1:23:29] twelve disciples to himself amen and
[1:23:32] they followed him everywhere they went
[1:23:34] everywhere Jesus went they kept they
[1:23:36] followed him they followed three and a
[1:23:37] half years they followed him or they
[1:23:39] doing their fault when they recognized
[1:23:41] that the Spirit of God was within this
[1:23:43] man amen that he was the son of the
[1:23:45] Living God and they were following it
[1:23:47] because of the revelation that they
[1:23:48] received amen and then all sudden one
[1:23:51] day to their astonishment that this man
[1:23:54] that they followed that they knew was
[1:23:56] the Son of the Living God they knew was
[1:23:58] the promise of the Scriptures be
[1:24:00] fulfilled that one day this man was
[1:24:02] lifted up on a cross and was crucified
[1:24:03] and died and was taken away from the
[1:24:07] depository of the Holy Spirit on the
[1:24:09] earth was taken and nailed to a tree and
[1:24:12] crucified amen and and and so and so it
[1:24:16] was he he goes is putting in the tomb he
[1:24:18] is resurrected he starts appearing I may
[1:24:21] in appearances and making appearances
[1:24:22] amen and visitation after visitation and
[1:24:25] and now and all sudden there and they
[1:24:27] have joy again because they realize
[1:24:29] their Lord and Savior has raised from
[1:24:32] the dead and he was not he did not just
[1:24:34] die and never to come back but he raised
[1:24:36] back again amen and as he is ministering
[1:24:40] to him he says wait here in Jerusalem
[1:24:42] until you be endued with power from on
[1:24:45] high
[1:24:46] you weigh right here in Jerusalem until
[1:24:49] you be endued with power from on high
[1:24:51] amen and as they watched amen and they
[1:24:54] watched as Jesus ascended up into the
[1:24:57] heavens and he was concealed away by a
[1:24:59] cloud a man there standing there looking
[1:25:01] up into the heavens and all sudden two
[1:25:03] angels appear and the two angels appear
[1:25:08] and they say why are you looking up into
[1:25:10] the heavens you know go why are you look
[1:25:14] he will return in the same way that he
[1:25:17] left but go and be obedient to
[1:25:19] everything that he told you to do amen
[1:25:21] answer or they go and they go and they
[1:25:23] waited in Jerusalem until they were in
[1:25:25] dude with power from on high
[1:25:27] you know a lot of Christians they'll
[1:25:28] wait until their endued with power from
[1:25:30] on low but it's important that we be
[1:25:32] endued with power from on high
[1:25:34] a man I think we all know what be to be
[1:25:36] is to be endued with power from down low
[1:25:38] I mean that's when you're acting your
[1:25:40] own ideas your own thinking your own
[1:25:42] thoughts your own ways but when you're
[1:25:45] one sindoor with power from on high now
[1:25:47] your longer thinking your thoughts but
[1:25:49] you have subjected yourself you've
[1:25:51] lifted your hand unto Jehovah you're no
[1:25:53] longer walking in your path but you like
[1:25:55] Zacchaeus have given up all Amen you
[1:25:59] have now forsaken all and now you're
[1:26:02] doing the same thing your father Abraham
[1:26:03] did and you're testifying that I too am
[1:26:06] living in the promised land and I am a
[1:26:08] son or a daughter of Abraham and an heir
[1:26:10] according to the promise Amen praise God
[1:26:13] that is our inheritance amen when we
[1:26:16] forsake all then that inheritance is do
[1:26:19] unto us amen but now if we do not
[1:26:22] forsake all that inheritance is not do
[1:26:26] unto us but all of us must take up our
[1:26:29] cross and follow Jesus amen so as the
[1:26:32] disciples were waiting there there
[1:26:34] waiting there in Jerusalem and all
[1:26:35] sudden they were endued with power from
[1:26:37] on high
[1:26:38] amen and the Bible says that when Jesus
[1:26:40] Christ ascended let's read here in
[1:26:42] Ephesians chapter 4 Ephesians 4:8 now
[1:26:48] wherefore he saith that when he ascended
[1:26:51] up on high he led captivity captive
[1:26:54] isn't that great isn't that wonderful
[1:26:58] that he led captivity captive he did
[1:27:01] that for you he did that for me amen he
[1:27:04] led captivity captive and he gave gifts
[1:27:07] unto men now he did this as he was
[1:27:09] ascending he led captivity captive and
[1:27:11] he gave gifts unto men now let's go down
[1:27:15] to verse 11 what are some of these gifts
[1:27:17] he gave unto us now if we if we have
[1:27:19] gifts remember we have an inheritance a
[1:27:21] man it's one thing about sons and
[1:27:23] daughters of Abraham as they want to
[1:27:25] know exactly what their inheritance is
[1:27:27] amen because if there's an inheritance
[1:27:29] of God's giving me something I want to
[1:27:31] have it amen I want to have it I want to
[1:27:34] obtain it I want to know exactly what it
[1:27:36] is I want to revere it and I want to
[1:27:38] love it amen amen so what we'll so what
[1:27:41] were some of the gifts he gave and he
[1:27:42] gave some apostles and some prophets and
[1:27:46] some evangelists and some pastors and
[1:27:49] teachers now why'd he give these gifts
[1:27:51] verse 12 for the perfecting of the
[1:27:54] Saints for the work of the ministry for
[1:27:57] the edifying of the body of Christ amen
[1:28:02] wouldn't we like you would you like to
[1:28:04] be perfected amen so would I we want to
[1:28:08] be sons and daughters of Abraham and we
[1:28:10] have to forsake all to get there amen so
[1:28:13] as our Lord Jesus Christ was ascending
[1:28:15] he led captivity captive he threw some
[1:28:18] gifts back among men and now the Holy
[1:28:21] Spirit that left when Jesus left
[1:28:24] returned back upon the heads of the
[1:28:27] apostles and that Holy Spirit is still
[1:28:29] descending upon men it's still filling
[1:28:31] min every ever since then that Holy
[1:28:33] Spirit has been going on filling and
[1:28:35] filling and filling men and women with
[1:28:38] the Holy Ghost amen amen and he is
[1:28:40] getting he is given a ministry a
[1:28:43] fivefold ministry for the perfecting of
[1:28:46] the Saints well
[1:28:48] what does that ministry to do to make us
[1:28:50] enter into the full inheritance that's
[1:28:52] due unto the sons of God to lead us into
[1:28:55] the perfection of the Saints to give us
[1:28:57] everything that we have need of on this
[1:28:59] life's journey amen
[1:29:00] to show us exactly what we own what we
[1:29:02] possess what is do unto us a make us one
[1:29:05] thing that one thing that is true about
[1:29:07] about mankind is we'll go back to our
[1:29:10] own natural ways if God does not give us
[1:29:14] a supernatural vision without a vision
[1:29:17] the people perish so God has given a
[1:29:19] fivefold ministry to keep the
[1:29:22] supernatural vision before the eyes of
[1:29:24] the people so that the people could
[1:29:27] always have in their eyesight to know
[1:29:29] this is the direction walking in it
[1:29:32] this is the way to go walking in it amen
[1:29:34] and that ministry is supported by the
[1:29:37] ties that you get amen and it's not that
[1:29:42] you give your ties to the ministry God
[1:29:45] already gave the ties to the ministry
[1:29:48] but when you bring forth now tithes
[1:29:50] means 10% that's what the word tithes
[1:29:54] means is 1/10 as 10% amen and when you
[1:29:57] give your tithing to the ministry you
[1:29:59] are fulfilling your doing the same thing
[1:30:02] Abraham did when he received the
[1:30:04] visitation amen
[1:30:06] that's one thing that that's one thing
[1:30:07] about men and women is when they receive
[1:30:10] a visitation of the Lord Jesus Christ
[1:30:12] and when the love of God fills their
[1:30:15] hearts and makes them a giving people
[1:30:17] amen
[1:30:18] you see it and when it happened to
[1:30:20] Abraham he gave a tenth of all what
[1:30:22] happened to Zacchaeus he says behold I
[1:30:24] give a half that I own to the poor Amen
[1:30:26] if I have wronged a by or restore him
[1:30:28] fourfold it's one thing you know if you
[1:30:30] go to a really church service where the
[1:30:33] where the spirit is there and a manatee
[1:30:35] or rejoicing and when you walk out of
[1:30:37] that church service you just feel all
[1:30:39] scoured out and you just my you just
[1:30:41] love your brother you love your sister
[1:30:43] you love anything you love them all why
[1:30:45] because the Holy Spirit and you have
[1:30:47] become one amen
[1:30:49] the blessings of the Holy Ghost are fun
[1:30:51] it causes you to love one another
[1:30:53] amen when you love one another you're
[1:30:56] giving people
[1:30:59] man amen amen amen now let's turn over
[1:31:09] to Malachi chapter 3 now Kai 3 verse 8
[1:31:33] and says will a man Rob God
[1:31:39] now you wouldn't think that was even
[1:31:43] possible you know I mean for you even if
[1:31:47] I went and I struck to you I told you I
[1:31:49] want you to go Rob God many people will
[1:31:52] say I don't even know how you would ever
[1:31:54] do that
[1:31:56] amen but the scripture says here will a
[1:31:59] man Rob God and it says yet ye have
[1:32:03] robbed me but ye say wherein have we
[1:32:06] robbed thee entice and offerings you are
[1:32:10] cursed with the curse for you robbed me
[1:32:12] even this whole nation bringing all the
[1:32:15] tithes into the storehouse that there
[1:32:17] may be meat in mine house and prove me
[1:32:19] now herewith saith Lord of Hosts if I'm
[1:32:21] not open unto you the windows of heaven
[1:32:23] and pour you out a blessing that there
[1:32:26] shall not be room enough to receive it
[1:32:28] now why is he saying because when people
[1:32:30] really withhold their tithing they're
[1:32:33] testifying that they don't trust God as
[1:32:35] their provider amen
[1:32:37] they're also testifying that they have
[1:32:39] not forsaken all and they're testifying
[1:32:41] that are not sons and daughters of
[1:32:42] Abraham because they're not doing what
[1:32:45] their father Abraham did yeah amen and
[1:32:48] verse 11 it says and I will rebuke the
[1:32:51] Devourer for your sakes that he shall
[1:32:53] not destroy the fruits of your ground
[1:32:55] you know Satan is going about like a
[1:32:58] roaring lion right now seeking whom he
[1:33:01] may devour
[1:33:02] he's been by your house he's been by
[1:33:06] your house this week Satan like a
[1:33:09] roaring lion has come by your house this
[1:33:11] week seeking whom
[1:33:12] could devour amen he the same is
[1:33:16] faithful to do what he is do his work
[1:33:19] amen he does not call in sick amen he is
[1:33:22] always doing what his work is amen he is
[1:33:25] a roaring devourer roaring lion seeking
[1:33:27] whom he may devour but the Bible says
[1:33:30] here that when you pay your ties and you
[1:33:32] pay bring your tithes into the
[1:33:33] storehouse that he will rebuke the
[1:33:35] Devourer for your sakes
[1:33:38] what a blessing amen so when you see the
[1:33:42] devour coming by your household when you
[1:33:45] see Satan come by your household and
[1:33:47] devouring something check out your
[1:33:49] checkbook look and see if you've paid
[1:33:50] your ties and if you haven't call it
[1:33:53] before the Lord say Lord I obeyed your
[1:33:55] word and look what the Devourer is doing
[1:34:01] right amen because what why because we
[1:34:04] have an ability to call God on the scene
[1:34:08] to answer his word why because as a
[1:34:11] member of the Bride of the Lord Jesus
[1:34:13] Christ whenever we see a promise in the
[1:34:16] word we have the ability to take that
[1:34:19] promise up to the Lord in prayer and the
[1:34:22] Bible says that Jesus Christ right now
[1:34:25] is standing at the altar waiting to make
[1:34:28] intercession for us based upon his
[1:34:31] confession based upon our confession
[1:34:33] says in Hebrews that the Lord Jesus
[1:34:35] Christ Himself entered in with the blood
[1:34:38] of his own sacrifice and he's standing
[1:34:40] there right now waiting to make
[1:34:42] intercession for us based upon what our
[1:34:44] confession is so when we confess his
[1:34:47] word and say lord I see the devourer
[1:34:49] devouring something in my life I've
[1:34:51] checked out my life I can't find any
[1:34:53] unconfessed sin I've paid my tithing and
[1:34:56] I need you to rebuke the Devourer for my
[1:34:58] sakes and then he can intercede for you
[1:35:01] based upon his own word amen that's what
[1:35:04] the Lord does I will rebuke the Devourer
[1:35:07] for your sakes and he shall not destroy
[1:35:10] the fruits of your ground
[1:35:11] neither shall your vine casts their
[1:35:14] fruits before the time in the field amen
[1:35:17] and all nations shall call you blessed
[1:35:19] for ye shall be a delights and
[1:35:21] delightsome land Lord
[1:35:25] amen what a promise what a promise you
[1:35:28] know God has a high interest in his
[1:35:30] bride even sometimes I don't know if we
[1:35:34] realize how much they God watches over
[1:35:37] us to perform his work just waiting for
[1:35:39] us to take some portion of his word of
[1:35:42] his word and to bring it before him in
[1:35:45] prayer and say Lord I have a need right
[1:35:47] now for you to answer your scripture I
[1:35:49] am a son of daughter of Abraham is the
[1:35:52] power of forsaking all amen that's why
[1:35:56] we have to check up constantly
[1:35:57] faithfully Lord have I been obedient to
[1:36:00] your word lord have I done everything
[1:36:02] you told me to do Lord have I left
[1:36:04] anything off Lord have I been obedient
[1:36:06] Lord am I doing what your ministry says
[1:36:08] for me to do
[1:36:09] Lori am i doing what your word says for
[1:36:11] me to do and checking up Lord I want to
[1:36:13] be faithful to what you say why because
[1:36:15] there's blessings in that there's
[1:36:17] blessings and being faithful
[1:36:19] there's blessings in being obedient to
[1:36:21] the word amen try it watch it watch it
[1:36:25] when you be obedient to the word watch
[1:36:27] what God will do in your life amen amen
[1:36:34] now let's turn over to Deuteronomy
[1:36:37] chapter 12 I don't have too many
[1:36:40] scriptures left here but I just want to
[1:36:42] turn to a couple more here this may not
[1:36:49] be a shout and message but but it's good
[1:36:51] anyhow amen amen
[1:36:58] Deuteronomy chapter 12 will read the
[1:37:00] tenth verse there I actually I'd
[1:37:06] recommend reading this whole chapter
[1:37:08] when you go home it's a wonderful
[1:37:10] chapter but we'll read the tenth and
[1:37:14] we'll end up going on down to the
[1:37:15] nineteenth first I just wanna spend some
[1:37:18] time in these ten verses here
[1:37:20] Deuteronomy 12:10 and it says but when
[1:37:26] you go over Jordan and dwell in the land
[1:37:30] which the Lord your God giveth you to
[1:37:32] inherit when he giveth you rest from
[1:37:34] your enemies round about so that you
[1:37:36] should dwell in safety
[1:37:38] there shall be a place which the Lord
[1:37:41] your God shall choose to cause his name
[1:37:44] to dwell there thither shall you bring
[1:37:46] all that I command you your burnt
[1:37:49] offerings and your sacrifices and your
[1:37:51] ties and the heave offering of your hand
[1:37:53] and all your choice vows which you have
[1:37:55] vowed unto the Lord and you shall
[1:37:57] rejoice before the Lord your God ye and
[1:38:00] your sons and your daughters and your
[1:38:01] men's service and your maidservants and
[1:38:04] the Levite has within your gates for as
[1:38:07] much as he has no part know nor
[1:38:10] inheritance with you you know to me this
[1:38:13] sounds like a church service you're
[1:38:15] gonna leave your house you're gonna go
[1:38:17] on to the place where God puts his name
[1:38:19] there and you're going to take your
[1:38:21] Levite with you you're gonna meet there
[1:38:22] Amen and you're gonna rejoice before the
[1:38:25] Lord and you're gonna bring your tithing
[1:38:26] there to me that sounds like a church
[1:38:28] service amen amen and God wants you to
[1:38:31] go and your church go to church amen
[1:38:33] amen
[1:38:35] that's not the guys put his name in this
[1:38:37] building but God has put his name in his
[1:38:39] bride amen and God has put his name in
[1:38:42] his bride and he's told them together
[1:38:43] the more as they see the Day approaching
[1:38:45] amen and and was he also as done he's
[1:38:48] given a fivefold ministry to minister
[1:38:51] unto his bride so that they can come to
[1:38:53] perfection and he wants them to gather
[1:38:56] together with this mystery and around a
[1:38:59] local gift that God has given to him
[1:39:01] amen now if God if you are living in a
[1:39:03] town if you're living in a certain
[1:39:06] region it's in if God says that when he
[1:39:08] ascended up on high he gave gifts unto
[1:39:10] men if you do not have one of those
[1:39:13] gifts Amen if you don't know where one
[1:39:15] of those gifts are then then you ought
[1:39:18] to at least find out where that gift is
[1:39:20] why because if you do not have a pastor
[1:39:22] then you're missing something
[1:39:25] amen why because when God was ascending
[1:39:27] when Christ was ascending he gave that
[1:39:29] gift back to you amen if you don't have
[1:39:32] that gift if you have a Levi if you
[1:39:35] don't have a pastor that you can call
[1:39:37] your own then you're missing something
[1:39:39] that God gave to you amen
[1:39:42] and when you find that gift when you
[1:39:44] find that pastor that pastor that
[1:39:47] ministry is to lead you is there for
[1:39:50] your perfection is there to lead you
[1:39:52] into
[1:39:52] amen and so what do you do when you find
[1:39:55] such a such a ministry you take all of
[1:39:58] your daughters and your sons and your
[1:40:00] wife and your tithing and you leave your
[1:40:03] house you go to where they gather you
[1:40:06] find that ministry that has the Spirit
[1:40:09] of God that is is identified by the
[1:40:12] Spirit of God and you bring your tithing
[1:40:15] unto that ministry amen and you rejoice
[1:40:18] there and sing unto Jehovah then that
[1:40:22] sounds like a church service amen yes
[1:40:25] now let's keep reading verse 13 take
[1:40:31] heed be careful watch out take heed to
[1:40:38] thyself that that offer not thy burnt
[1:40:42] offering in every place that thou seest
[1:40:45] be careful watch out but in the place
[1:40:51] which the Lord shall choose in one of
[1:40:53] the tribes there thou shall offer thy
[1:40:57] burnt offerings and there they shall do
[1:40:59] all that I command thee be careful watch
[1:41:03] out where do you pay your tithe you have
[1:41:05] to be careful where you pay your tithe
[1:41:07] you have to be careful where you bring
[1:41:08] your offerings amen now let's go to
[1:41:13] verse 17 we'll skip down to 17 thou
[1:41:18] mayst not you shouldn't do it don't do
[1:41:21] it
[1:41:21] thou may us not eat within thy gates the
[1:41:25] tithe of thy corn or of thy wine or of
[1:41:29] the oil or the first things of thy herds
[1:41:31] or LifeLock nor any of thy vow shall vow
[1:41:34] us nor thy free will offerings or heave
[1:41:37] offerings of thine hand don't do it
[1:41:40] don't eat it at your own home so if you
[1:41:42] take care tithe money and you use it to
[1:41:45] order Domino's Pizza you're in
[1:41:50] disobedience to this verse amen
[1:41:53] if you take that that 10 percent of your
[1:41:56] increase and you take that and you use
[1:42:00] it for something there in your household
[1:42:01] or use it for your own benefit then
[1:42:03] you're in disobedience to this first
[1:42:04] right here yes
[1:42:06] amen verse 18 but thou must eat them
[1:42:11] before the Lord thy God where is the
[1:42:15] LORD thy God where is he had he said two
[1:42:20] thousand years ago he said wherever two
[1:42:22] or three are gathered in my name I'll be
[1:42:25] right there in the midst of them
[1:42:26] I'll be right there wherever two or
[1:42:29] three are gathered they're right there
[1:42:30] and in God when he ascended up on high
[1:42:32] he gave gifts unto men he gave you a
[1:42:34] pastor it gave you a ministry it's good
[1:42:38] to find out no matter where you are find
[1:42:40] that pastor find that ministry and
[1:42:43] support him why because we want a
[1:42:45] healthy ministry amen
[1:42:48] why do we give our tithe because the
[1:42:52] ministry needs to be healthy now the
[1:42:56] tithing goes on to the fivefold ministry
[1:42:58] amen
[1:42:59] I don't you know it's not there to pay
[1:43:01] for the rent it's not there to pay for
[1:43:03] the lights it's not there to pay for all
[1:43:04] the insurance policies it's there to
[1:43:07] support the fivefold ministry the
[1:43:09] offerings are to go for all the other
[1:43:12] needs of the church amen amen
[1:43:14] and and we want a healthy ministry why
[1:43:17] why because because our brother Jesse
[1:43:21] here has a right had a right to the
[1:43:24] American Dream had a right to develop a
[1:43:27] career had a right to to go up higher
[1:43:30] and higher and whatever career that he
[1:43:32] has anyway I know he's a teacher you
[1:43:34] know and he could have gone up higher
[1:43:36] and higher or wherever he could have
[1:43:38] maybe been a principal he could have
[1:43:39] done many things like ranches but he's
[1:43:41] been careful to watch the time that he
[1:43:45] has and I watched this man use man's
[1:43:47] diligent with his time he is diligent
[1:43:50] with his time and he sacrifices and he
[1:43:53] gives out and he goes and he visits the
[1:43:55] six and he does everything that the
[1:43:57] Bible says a pastor ought to do he's
[1:44:00] been faithful with his calling amen
[1:44:02] he's been faithful with his coin and
[1:44:04] that ministry should be supported and
[1:44:07] should be supported with the tithing
[1:44:08] amen
[1:44:09] and we went why because God already gave
[1:44:12] the tithing to the ministry we're just
[1:44:15] manifesting it when we put it in the
[1:44:17] offering plate
[1:44:18] and if we hold it back then we're
[1:44:21] robbing God because God gave something
[1:44:24] to the ministry and you stole it
[1:44:26] amen that's what we do when we don't pay
[1:44:29] our tithing now let's finish verse 18
[1:44:31] there it says but thou must eat them
[1:44:34] before the LORD thy God in the place
[1:44:36] which the LORD thy God shall choose thou
[1:44:39] and thy son and my daughter and thy
[1:44:41] manservant and I maid servant and that
[1:44:43] the leet and the Levite as within I
[1:44:45] gates and thou shalt rejoice before the
[1:44:47] Lord thy God and all that that put us
[1:44:50] thy hands unto amen verse 19 take heed
[1:44:53] be careful watch out take heed to
[1:44:57] thyself that thou forsake not the Levite
[1:45:00] as long as they live us upon the earth
[1:45:04] be careful watch out make sure you
[1:45:08] remember that I feel as a tenth
[1:45:10] it doesn't mean 9% it doesn't mean 8%
[1:45:15] it doesn't mean take you know a couple
[1:45:17] percent off over here a couple percent
[1:45:19] off over here no if God has given you a
[1:45:22] ministry if God has given you a pastor
[1:45:25] that will faithfully search out the word
[1:45:28] and find out what it is that God has a
[1:45:30] need for the local body for the
[1:45:32] perfecting of the Saints then that ties
[1:45:34] goes to that ministry amen amen amen you
[1:45:41] know and then people say well I'm just
[1:45:42] gonna I'm just gonna all stay at home
[1:45:44] and I'm not gonna leave my gate and I'm
[1:45:47] just gonna stay at home and I'm gonna
[1:45:49] mail my tithe check off over to this
[1:45:51] church a thousand miles away and you
[1:45:53] know but that's not what the Bible said
[1:45:55] the Bible says I remember what why do we
[1:45:58] sit they say they're back in verse let
[1:46:03] me find it real quick here
[1:46:10] I will go back to
[1:46:15] let's go back to numbers real quick I'm

[1:47:40] room we have to keep that scripture
[1:47:43] where Jesus said wherever two or three
[1:47:45] are gathered together I'll be right
[1:47:47] there in the midst ISM you know we think
[1:47:49] oh you know it's just just a natural
[1:47:51] building with sometimes some of us tend
[1:47:53] to supernatural eyes everything and I
[1:47:56] think well this this natural building
[1:47:58] doesn't mean anything you know or it's
[1:47:59] just a natural place all right I meet
[1:48:01] God in my home in the spirit you know
[1:48:03] but but God has designed this little
[1:48:05] place here to be the place where we
[1:48:08] gather together you know the Bible says
[1:48:10] iron sharpens iron but it only sharpens
[1:48:13] iron with the context amen and we have
[1:48:16] to come and contact one with the other
[1:48:18] amen and if God has given you a gift
[1:48:21] which he said he did when he was
[1:48:22] ascended up on high he gave you a gift
[1:48:24] of the fivefold ministry amen all of us
[1:48:27] have to find
[1:48:28] ministry and stay there honor at love at
[1:48:30] cherish bring our Titan unto it come to
[1:48:33] church with it
[1:48:34] we rejoice rejoice rejoice day in day in
[1:48:37] day out bring her like a fire into the
[1:48:39] church as part of our duty as part what
[1:48:41] are we doing we're testifying that were
[1:48:42] sons and daughters of Abraham because
[1:48:45] we're being obedient to this do the same
[1:48:47] thing he did amen amen
[1:48:50] why we want a healthy church a healthy
[1:48:53] ministry amen amen a swear our children
[1:48:57] can be raised in the nurture and the
[1:48:59] admonition of the Lord amen a healthy
[1:49:02] place that that when we go to the
[1:49:04] grocery store and the Lord smoothes upon
[1:49:06] your heart to go and witness to someone
[1:49:07] that you can say come I want you to come
[1:49:10] over to this church I want you to bring
[1:49:11] you over here why because this is where
[1:49:13] the Word of God is preached and we have
[1:49:14] a healthy ministry there and you can see
[1:49:16] the Word of God in action amen why
[1:49:20] because because everything is operating
[1:49:22] a well-oiled machine just the way God
[1:49:25] designed it amen
[1:49:28] we want a healthy ministry Amen because
[1:49:29] I you I you I've seen the churches to
[1:49:31] where there's you know or where there's
[1:49:33] the the tithing doesn't come in or the
[1:49:35] people don't invite people to church the
[1:49:37] people don't go out and minister the
[1:49:39] people don't go out and witness
[1:49:40] themselves you know and the church
[1:49:42] dwindles down in numbers the pastor
[1:49:44] isn't supported the people aren't
[1:49:46] praying and what do you have if you were
[1:49:48] ever to witnesses someone where would
[1:49:50] you bring them amen but we want to have
[1:49:54] a healthy ministry a healthy place to
[1:49:57] where we can bring the unbeliever amen
[1:49:59] why so the unbeliever can come and have
[1:50:01] their needs taken care of amen amen
[1:50:06] let's just stand a
[1:50:12] hey man you know we may not have a
[1:50:14] natural land like the share of Israel
[1:50:17] did that is our inheritance but we do
[1:50:19] have an inheritance the Lord Jesus
[1:50:21] Christ has given us his spirit
[1:50:23] it is our inheritance amen hey man we
[1:50:26] may sometimes think of pain or ties as
[1:50:29] just a natural tradition thing that is
[1:50:33] optional but there's something about
[1:50:37] that visitation with Melchizedek that
[1:50:39] caused Abraham to pay our tithing amen
[1:50:42] if we ever once meet the Lord Jesus
[1:50:44] Christ
[1:50:44] it'll cause us to do the same things
[1:50:47] it'll cause us to love one another it
[1:50:49] cause us to cherish our pastor not
[1:50:52] second-guess our pastor no I think I
[1:50:54] wish our past or do this or do that but
[1:50:56] to find out why God gave you such a
[1:50:58] bastard
[1:50:58] amen amen to love your pastor to care
[1:51:01] for him to watch out over to make sure
[1:51:03] that we have a healthy ministry amen
[1:51:06] amen let's just power has a word of
[1:51:08] Prayer
[1:51:08] Heavenly Father I I just maybe it was
[1:51:12] just a maybe a sermon not quite what
[1:51:14] we're used to Laura but Lord this has
[1:51:16] been on my heart these last several
[1:51:18] months Lord to preach this message Lord
[1:51:20] and I pray father for this local church
[1:51:22] this local assembly father that you who
[1:51:25] Lord have have called a man by the name
[1:51:27] of brother Jesse Lohr Neve your daenam
[1:51:30] to be a pastor over this church Lord
[1:51:32] Lord and all of us Lord if we were to be
[1:51:35] honest with ourselves we'd say if we
[1:51:38] were to ask one another do we want to
[1:51:39] have a healthy church or not we look
[1:51:42] down in our hearts we would say yes have
[1:51:44] a healthy church if we're gonna have a
[1:51:46] place to where if we can go out and
[1:51:48] witness Lord if you'd grass to be able
[1:51:50] to win our neighbor or our co-worker or
[1:51:52] mother or father our children our nephew
[1:51:55] our aunt or uncle to Christ that we have
[1:51:58] a place that we could take them a place
[1:52:01] where the Holy Spirit is familiar with a
[1:52:03] place where the Holy Spirit has there's
[1:52:06] a well-beaten passed from heaven to the
[1:52:08] sanctuary where God comes and answers
[1:52:11] our prayers stay in a day out so where
[1:52:14] are the people come and they say when
[1:52:16] they come to church when they come in
[1:52:17] the door they say I know that God is
[1:52:19] gonna meet us here this morning because
[1:52:22] he never fails
[1:52:24] to answer his word where you said Lord
[1:52:27] where two or three are gathered
[1:52:28] combining who would be right here in the
[1:52:30] sense we know if that Scripture is true
[1:52:33] and no matter what if even if the
[1:52:35] service seems like a dry service maybe
[1:52:37] our old mental selves if we're tired for
[1:52:40] weary we can look to that scripture and
[1:52:42] know that no matter how we feel in our
[1:52:44] own bodies that that scripture remains
[1:52:47] true and that the promise that he will
[1:52:50] not withhold from us are brought his
[1:52:51] promise and lord I just pray father the
[1:52:54] Lord that the people who have respects
[1:52:57] under this place and respects on your
[1:53:00] ministry to treat her right Laura that
[1:53:04] you might be that you might rebuke the
[1:53:05] Devourer for their sakes I pray Lord
[1:53:08] that if they're meeting me here there's
[1:53:10] been a dilatory Lord to be obedient to
[1:53:14] your word Lord that you would give them
[1:53:16] the witness back Lord when that when
[1:53:18] they're obedient to your word that you
[1:53:19] would show them that you would reveal to
[1:53:21] them that you are rebuking the Devourer
[1:53:23] for their sins in obedience just like
[1:53:26] what's your word said lord I just thank
[1:53:28] you for those people Lord for being so
[1:53:31] attentive to your word this this evening
[1:53:33] I pray Lord that for the service
[1:53:36] tomorrow Lord we're looking for
[1:53:38] something special
[1:53:40] lord I just pray thought you'd meet us
[1:53:42] here again in the morning and we thank
[1:53:45] you Lord for all things the name of Lord
[1:53:47] Jesus Christ we pray amen amen
[1:53:50] Jesse if you come amen god bless you
[1:53:54] Saints appreciate you how many children
[1:54:15] of Abraham do have in the church today I
[1:54:18] know that's one way I know that I met
[1:54:21] Melchizedek is because boys given ten
[1:54:25] percent of my income to the Lord I
[1:54:27] really appreciate that word don't you
[1:54:29] preach appreciate that word tonight
[1:54:30] that's good Lord Rama Claus amen
[1:54:32] ladies got I've never heard it brought
[1:54:36] at that angle that's a really good angle
[1:54:38] start there with Abraham that was a
[1:54:42] really wonderful wonderful message we
[1:54:44] thank the Lord for that and now can you
[1:54:49] just switch over Lydia can you switch
[1:54:51] over real quick here just to my iPad
[1:54:54] you know just the last is interesting
[1:54:57] the brother told me that God's been
[1:54:58] dealing with him for this thought for
[1:55:00] our church for a few months and so two
[1:55:05] months ago I put out a video called ties
[1:55:06] in the Bible
[1:55:08] last month I put out part two last week
[1:55:12] I put out part one of the home church
[1:55:14] increasing your church attendance by
[1:55:16] part two I just put out this morning
[1:55:18] about having a pastor every Christian
[1:55:21] needs to have a pastor and the five
[1:55:23] benefits of the five preaching ministry
[1:55:25] I did tell him that you know
[1:55:28] so it's just you know God's timing is
[1:55:31] perfect so I just thought it was
[1:55:33] important to share that and I've had
[1:55:36] people call me you're a son of perdition
[1:55:37] believing in paying ties like I'm not
[1:55:41] the Bible says that God has ordained
[1:55:45] that they which preach the gospel should
[1:55:48] live of the Gospels
[1:55:49] 1st Corinthians 9 13 and 14 so no matter
[1:55:54] what people say a child of Abraham knows
[1:55:57] he's doing the works of Abraham he or
[1:56:00] she is doing the works of a race and so
[1:56:03] a person who's met Melchizedek acts like
[1:56:07] Abraham he met Melchizedek and that's
[1:56:12] what he did
[1:56:12] once you meet God then you willingly you
[1:56:14] understand that it's God is the one
[1:56:17] who's giving me a hundred percent
[1:56:19] God gives me a hundred percent and just
[1:56:20] asked me to give up ten or eleven or
[1:56:22] twelve or thirteen or whatever you can
[1:56:24] be so I appreciate that and the good
[1:56:28] thoughts there what a blessing by the
[1:56:31] grace you know and church I find this I
[1:56:36] love what the brother said there about
[1:56:38] the Bible says proof me if I won't pour
[1:56:41] open if we know some heaven I think you
[1:56:44] know when we go through hard times that
[1:56:45] that's what God is doing he's he's
[1:56:47] encouraging us okay we need to call out
[1:56:50] to me I want to hear I want to hear more
[1:56:52] of your prayers

[2:17:25] special man you said he was a special
[2:17:27] blend he took this and this and this and
[2:17:29] brought it all down to produce Abraham I
[2:17:31] use that same quote on Wednesday night
[2:17:33] God adds this one and that one that one
[2:17:35] and he has a special ring to your
[2:17:37] testimony and God knew he was going to
[2:17:39] form you to be this type of personality
[2:17:42] and to be this type of overcomer
[2:17:44] do not be overcome by evil but overcome
[2:17:48] evil with good that's what makes his
