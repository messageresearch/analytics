[26:17] [Music]
[26:24] I
[26:30] [Music]
[26:49] praise God let's take our Bibles here
[26:51] let's get to the word of the Lord that's
[26:52] what job chapter 17 tonight by God's
[26:55] grace
[26:56] job chapter 7 he lit like to look at
[26:59] purpose part 4 like degree hour eight of
[27:03] eight viewers so god bless our eight
[27:05] viewers there they Lord richly bless you
[27:08] I appreciate you taking this time out
[27:10] here to hear the word of the Lord and
[27:15] I know to be a blessing to you so let's
[27:18] go to job chapter 17 read 10
[27:21] 11 12 and 13
[27:29] here's job in the midst of his trial we
[27:33] know he had a trial for months and
[27:34] months and months and lost all his
[27:36] family though his children his
[27:39] possessions
[27:41] and at this point he's lost his health
[27:44] for the most part as I've been reading
[27:46] in here you know job was saying how he
[27:48] could hardly sleep at night he was
[27:50] losing sleep and every night was just
[27:53] awful and worse and in the midst of this
[27:56] trial
[27:58] we see the enemy tried to convince
[28:01] job that he doesn't have a purpose in
[28:04] life anymore and so I want to look at
[28:06] that tonight and just kind of reassure
[28:08] our hearts on the purpose of God in the
[28:11] midst of trials those look at job 17
[28:14] verse 10
[28:19] verse 10 says but as for you all do he
[28:23] return they come now for I cannot find
[28:25] one wise man among youth that's joke
[28:29] talking to his three friends there
[28:32] and that's true because later they had
[28:34] apologized and Joe had to pray for them
[28:36] let's reverse the leaven together for
[28:39] the children we have their Bibles Joe
[28:41] 1711 ready 1 2 3
[28:44] my days are past my purposes are broken
[28:49] off even the thoughts of my heart in re
[28:52] 12 and 13 they are they change the night
[28:56] in today the light is short because of
[28:58] darkness if I wait the grave is my house
[29:02] if I have made my bed I'm sorry I have
[29:04] made my bed in the darkness
[29:07] re 14 as well I've said to corruption
[29:10] thou art my father
[29:11] to the worm thou art my mother and my
[29:14] sister he was so sure that death awaited
[29:18] him he was so sure that there was no
[29:20] hope that he was calling the worm his
[29:22] mother of course we know the end of the
[29:25] story right we know what God did God did
[29:27] a complete restoration of job's life but
[29:31] in the midst of trials it was so
[29:32] difficult
[29:33] he thought he was going down to the
[29:35] grave soon
[29:36] and he thought he had no purpose in life
[29:39] and many times we get like that so
[29:41] that's just of our heads here and will
[29:43] preach on this thought by God's grace
[29:46] they have a need on your heart just
[29:48] maybe in your home there just raise your
[29:51] hand into the Lord Heavenly Father we
[29:53] know your spirit is omnipresent and
[29:55] omnipotent your all-powerful you can be
[29:58] in all places at one time Lord for those
[30:01] who welcome you in their homes Lord we
[30:04] pray tonight we've sang tonight we tried
[30:06] to welcome you in each home and dear God
[30:08] we just ask that you be in each home and
[30:10] may your presence be felt there dear God
[30:13] thank you for the songs that we can sing
[30:14] Lord God to glorify thy great name we've
[30:17] shouted the name of Jesus and I thank
[30:19] you Jesus and we ask o God that you'll
[30:21] speak to every heart by your word and
[30:23] our blessings now died to my presence in
[30:25] Jesus Christ's name never said
[30:28] Amen baby seated here
[30:36] they can you send me a text phone
[30:39] semi Texan saver of mine
[30:45] so I just actually if she make a
[30:47] reminder for me I want to send my cousin
[30:49] Adam a video I just been sending him
[30:52] text and I thought maybe it'd help him
[30:54] out if I just send the video talking a
[30:56] little bit maybe that would help them
[30:57] out my god it's great so
[31:01] let's look at our
[31:02] [Music]
[31:04] our text here by the grace of Lord
[31:11] now we're in job 17 again as we said
[31:17] and let me just skip to where I was
[31:19] going
[31:22] now we'll get to this in just a moment
[31:24] but I just want to go over this again
[31:25] here how job's trials made him doubt his
[31:28] purposes in life
[31:30] he said my purposes are broken off
[31:35] so we know the pain of broken bones
[31:38] right or we know the pain of
[31:41] promises that are broken the pain of you
[31:44] know of having a promise broken or a
[31:47] relationship broken we know the pain of
[31:50] brokenness and
[31:52] so that's what Jobe felt like through us
[31:55] months-long trial was that there were
[31:58] just no more purpose for him in life and
[32:00] thank God we know the end of the story
[32:05] and I just want to encourage you tonight
[32:07] no matter what you're going through and
[32:10] this is what I apply to my life as well
[32:12] as I prepare these thoughts from the
[32:14] Word of God is to not let anything
[32:17] frustrate the purpose of God in my life
[32:21] now I want to before getting more on Joe
[32:25] I want to preach a little more on Joe I
[32:27] want to just cover again the purpose of
[32:30] God to constantly feed on the Word of
[32:32] God you know some people we know in many
[32:35] churches you know because of the cold
[32:37] tonight canceled and you know they're
[32:40] allowed to do that and core we cancel
[32:42] gathering physically but you know many
[32:44] churches today cancelled it and so
[32:47] people won't be listening the Word of
[32:48] God tonight who knows what they'll be
[32:50] doing
[32:50] the sincere Christian though will be
[32:53] trying to find some way to feed upon the
[32:56] Word of God because we know that is
[32:59] God's purpose for their lives we're not
[33:02] going to turn there but in Hebrews 10 we
[33:04] know the Bible says to gather more as
[33:06] you see that Day approaching it's so
[33:08] important to keep gathering with
[33:11] believers so we appreciate you make it
[33:14] an opportunity or making the the effort
[33:16] to feed on the Word of God you'll never
[33:19] regret that brother Branham said he
[33:20] never regretted ever going to the house
[33:22] of Lord to worship and neither have I so
[33:25] something good can always come out of
[33:27] that
[33:28] but let's kind of review a few things
[33:32] I'm going to read from uncertain sound
[33:35] 1961 the Prophet said tonight we'd ask
[33:39] especially for our gracious loyal
[33:41] brother Sullivan that you bless him
[33:43] exceedingly abundantly seeing his
[33:45] heart's desires to serve you and to do
[33:47] something for you and to make all of
[33:49] these hours count for the kingdom of God
[33:51] that's what we want to do tonight make
[33:53] these hours tonight count for God's
[33:55] kingdom and
[33:57] he Madison brother Sullivan was bringing
[34:00] into the city ministers different
[34:02] ministers with different types of
[34:03] ministry that they might serve the
[34:07] purpose and they might feed the flock to
[34:11] which the Holy Spirit has made them
[34:13] overseer and brother branham's to thanks
[34:16] the Lord he said Lord we thank you for
[34:18] this and
[34:20] so that's of course what every
[34:22] god-fearing Church does that we try to
[34:25] call in different ministries mostly
[34:27] evangelist you know but we at times call
[34:29] in pastors and teachers we know there
[34:32] are and the that's the purpose of God to
[34:36] feed the flock of God I remember we're
[34:39] not going to turn there but Acts chapter
[34:40] 20 where Paul cried for three days and
[34:43] and Paul charged those Ephesian elders
[34:46] he said don't let these wolves come in
[34:48] he said feed the flock of God which the
[34:51] Holy Spirit has made you over see your
[34:53] stuff so I counted as a when the
[34:57] purposes of my life is to feed the flock
[34:58] the Word of God I love to see when that
[35:01] word is received whether it's through
[35:05] immediate revelation or maybe it takes
[35:07] time to receive that revelation maybe
[35:09] it's encouragement I love to see when
[35:11] the food that God has prepared for his
[35:13] people is received praise God that's
[35:17] God's purpose it was such a purpose that
[35:19] Paul cried about it he won the the
[35:21] Church of God to be protected he won
[35:24] them to be fed you know which one of us
[35:26] if we watched TV we don't cry when we
[35:28] see a baby that's starving to death you
[35:30] know they're usually from Africa you
[35:32] know when I was growing up we would see
[35:33] that constantly you know commercials
[35:35] trying to get people to send money to
[35:37] feed the poor starving children in
[35:39] Africa and how that hurts our hearts and
[35:42] it makes us sad it makes us want to do
[35:44] something but how about spiritually
[35:47] where God's people are not feeding on
[35:49] the Word of God they're not hearing
[35:50] preaching that pertains to them thank
[35:53] God that we have the message of the hour
[35:55] the food of this day to feed our hungry
[35:58] hearts we don't have to feed off on the
[36:01] old stale bread right we don't eat stale
[36:03] bread moldy bread from the days of
[36:05] Luther Wesley or Azusa Street we don't
[36:07] defeat on that but we got the fresh
[36:09] manna we got rapture food eating the
[36:11] head we got the food of this hour to
[36:14] feed on that's that's that's our life
[36:16] and that's the purpose of God
[36:19] for the fivefold ministry program thank
[36:22] the Lord for that
[36:26] now I want to just
[36:30] bring another thought to I may be
[36:32] getting this later on in future sermons
[36:35] I want to bring this thought that that
[36:38] that the purpose of God is feeding the
[36:40] flock of God
[36:42] and you know there's times and seasons
[36:44] for ministries you
[36:46] know I feel like maybe God has done this
[36:49] in Akron a little bit I'm looking at the
[36:51] the life of Peter not just for a moment
[36:54] you know when Jesus first caught him in
[36:56] Matthew chapter 4 he walked by Galilee
[36:59] he saw Simon and Andrews brother this is
[37:02] in Matthew 4 18 to 19 casting a net into
[37:05] the sea for they were fishers
[37:08] and he says oh then follow me and I'll
[37:11] make you fishers of men
[37:13] now of course we know that lasted for
[37:16] about three and a half years under the
[37:18] ministry of the Lord Jesus now right
[37:21] after Jesus was resurrected you know he
[37:24] met Peter and Peter denied him three
[37:25] times previously so Jesus asked him do
[37:28] you love me three times I want you to
[37:30] see how the shift of the purpose changes
[37:34] a little bit for Peter first he's a
[37:36] Fisher man and then it becomes a feeder
[37:39] of men I feel like that's you know what
[37:41] God has done in Akron recently you know
[37:44] God is back in 2000 you know
[37:47] 2003 we started the house services with
[37:50] Tim Meyers Tim Meyer started the house
[37:51] services and that was a great time of
[37:54] fishing where numerous fish got pulled
[37:56] into the the phone retailer or got
[37:59] pulled into the net and since then many
[38:02] times men met most of these years
[38:04] following have been feeding so we went
[38:06] from fishing to feeding the purpose of
[38:10] God slightly changed but the purpose of
[38:13] God is still in effect that we need to
[38:15] find God's sheep and then feed God's
[38:17] sheep so in John 21 15 you know that the
[38:21] scripture probably so when they died you
[38:24] just say at the Simon Peter Simon son of
[38:26] Jonas lovest thou me more than these
[38:28] they say unto Him yea Lord thou knowest
[38:31] that I love thee and he saith unto Him
[38:33] feed my lambs amen this I feel like I've
[38:36] got the burden like Peter I want to feed
[38:38] the lambs of God tonight I want to feed
[38:40] the Sheep of God tonight who are live
[38:42] streaming a part of Bride of Christ
[38:44] fellowship and those who are maybe in
[38:46] need of a home church and don't have one
[38:48] and they want to feed on the word of God
[38:51] we went from fishing to feeding now of
[38:53] course we always like doing fishing work
[38:55] right we send out postcards we put our
[38:58] videos on on YouTube or Facebook always
[39:02] trying to go fishing and try to see if
[39:03] anyone's hungry and thirsting for
[39:04] righteousness
[39:05] but right now our main ministry is
[39:09] feeding the people the Word of God and
[39:11] that's God's purpose that's one of God's
[39:13] great purposes for the church
[39:17] now one look at this here's another
[39:19] thought from this Melchizedek
[39:22] brother Brahim said being eternal with
[39:25] him at the beginning the eternal life
[39:27] that you had his thought of what you was
[39:31] he wanted me to stand in the pulpit say
[39:34] he wanted you to sit in the seat tonight
[39:37] then we are serving his eternal purpose
[39:42] he says in the one that left home only
[39:45] come to earth to service purpose is that
[39:48] right then that first finish it's
[39:49] brought back to glorify state it's
[39:51] matured and brought back again so
[39:54] brother Matt makes the point that we
[39:56] came from God's mind manifest in a flesh
[39:59] body and here we are in service tonight
[40:01] and whether you're standing preaching or
[40:03] sitting playing the piano or whether
[40:06] you're listening to the Word of God
[40:07] being preached to the Internet you are
[40:09] serving God's purpose right now I just
[40:12] want to remind you of that that it's
[40:14] God's eternal purpose God knew you'd be
[40:16] watching tonight and God had a purpose
[40:19] for you to watch tonight so please pay
[40:21] special close attention to every word of
[40:25] God that's being preached it's God's
[40:27] purpose to feed you and tonight it's
[40:30] God's purpose for you to hear the word
[40:32] of God and don't let it fall to the
[40:34] ground don't let it just go over the top
[40:36] of your head don't just be a hearer but
[40:39] be a doer of the word of the Lord
[40:42] my man tells us in perfect strength
[40:45] through perfect weakness which I got to
[40:46] listen to a couple times last week while
[40:48] shoveling snow for four hours brother
[40:51] Graham said he said that's when we come
[40:53] to church for is to find out where our
[40:55] faults is and the things that we might
[40:58] better ourselves by if we come to church
[41:02] for any other objective than this I'm
[41:04] afraid we won't get to much I've come
[41:06] into church so tonight as the word of
[41:08] God is being preached we should say lord
[41:11] help me to hear the word that I need to
[41:14] hear to strengthen my spiritual walk
[41:16] help me to be honest and say well maybe
[41:19] I'm not as strong as I need to be here
[41:21] maybe I'm not doing as well as I need to
[41:24] do in this area of my life whether it's
[41:25] prayer Bible reading or how I'm treating
[41:28] my family like here tonight how we treat
[41:31] one another
[41:32] maybe if we're not doing a good enough
[41:33] job the Holy Spirit help us to do a
[41:36] better job that's the purpose if we feel
[41:39] like we don't get anything out of this
[41:41] live stream then then we haven't taken a
[41:44] good-enough
[41:46] purpose we haven't looked at our lives
[41:49] or say inventory we haven't taken a good
[41:52] enough inventory of our spiritual walk
[41:54] as we need to do that tonight
[41:57] brother Graham says we must come to find
[42:00] our weaknesses find our bad places and
[42:04] see how little we are and put our trust
[42:06] in somebody that strong
[42:09] that's what we must do so that's what
[42:11] we're here to do tonight put our trust
[42:12] in Jesus Christ see how little see our
[42:15] bad places see our weak points and trust
[42:19] Jesus Christ to make those weak points
[42:21] strong that's God's eternal purpose for
[42:24] us tonight amen because I know as you
[42:27] know like brother Branham said I'll have
[42:29] to answer for everything I preach
[42:30] tonight I have to answer for many many
[42:33] services that's why I'm trusting in the
[42:35] blood of Jesus Christ to help me preach
[42:38] every service as honestly and sincerely
[42:40] as I can so that day I can answer and
[42:42] say I tried to live everything that God
[42:45] led me to preach
[42:47] now I just want to reiterate a few
[42:50] things here I want to go to
[42:54] the recent video I did on the home
[42:58] church series I will look at just a few
[43:00] things now remember from these five
[43:03] gifts of the fivefold ministry
[43:06] it's to produce at least five things in
[43:11] our life it's the produce the perfection
[43:14] or the equipping of the saints the so
[43:17] through tonight's sermon you're supposed
[43:19] to be equipped you're supposed to be
[43:20] given a tool you're supposed to be given
[43:22] a word you're supposed to be given a
[43:24] prophecy or something from the Word of
[43:27] God that's to equip you to be a better
[43:30] servant a better soldier for Christ
[43:32] second you're supposed to be given the
[43:35] work of the ministry so you're supposed
[43:37] to be encouraged to undertake a ministry
[43:39] praise God have a ministry do what God
[43:43] is calling you to do
[43:45] third your
[43:47] growth is to be promoted because that's
[43:50] the edifying of the body of Christ so
[43:53] this word that we hear tonight is to
[43:54] edify us help us grow in Christ Jesus as
[43:58] we said with food you know every plant
[44:00] needs food water and light you know all
[44:02] these things that it needs it makes its
[44:03] own food water light and temperature and
[44:06] soil of minerals and all these things
[44:08] that's what the Word of God is doing
[44:10] tonight it's promoting our growth it's
[44:13] meeting all of these needs
[44:15] forth it brings us to a unity of the
[44:19] faith said the conclusion of this sermon
[44:22] we should have more RP from us who make
[44:27] Bride of Christ fellowship our home
[44:28] church we should agree more on our
[44:31] beliefs we should have less confusion
[44:33] and more unity have more oneness of our
[44:36] thoughts and beliefs and fifthly
[44:39] unity and the knowledge of the Son of
[44:41] God and that's the unity of the precise
[44:44] truth so looks like 4 and 5 kind of go
[44:47] together
[44:47] with unity of faith and unity of
[44:50] knowledge that's what the Word of God is
[44:52] supposed to do for us and of course at
[44:56] any time if there's any questions you
[44:57] would have about the Word of God please
[45:00] reach out to me we'll be happy to answer
[45:02] any questions and
[45:04] these all work if we're into it the Holy
[45:07] Spirit then will work to the portion of
[45:09] the maturity of Jesus Christ they will
[45:12] raise you to the level of maturity you
[45:14] need to be in Christ Jesus because the
[45:16] Bible said unto a perfect man unto the
[45:19] measure of the stature of the fullness
[45:21] of Christ we should see our lives
[45:24] looking more like Jesus Christ as the
[45:27] days go by and less like the world and
[45:29] lessen failure and lessened out lessened
[45:33] fear but more in strength and more in
[45:35] confidence more revelation more in
[45:37] service more like Jesus Christ because
[45:40] remember Jesus told the Church of
[45:41] thyroid sorry mister Thyatira your last
[45:44] works were more than the first so our
[45:47] works and our dedication of the home
[45:49] church our dedication to the Saints and
[45:53] the home church it should grow over time
[45:55] not diminish but it should grow
[46:00] and then it says mature Christians and
[46:03] Ephesians 4 speak the truth and love so
[46:05] we don't speak in hatred we don't speak
[46:08] in envy or jealousy we speak the truth
[46:11] in love for other people and then if we
[46:14] do that we will find where God has fitly
[46:16] joined us in our position in the body of
[46:20] Christ so see we've got to apply all
[46:22] those five benefits of the preaching
[46:24] when we do that we start speaking God's
[46:26] truth in love and we can find our
[46:28] position in the body of Christ
[46:32] also there will be four benefits or four
[46:37] weaknesses or states of temptation that
[46:40] we will be delivered out of remember
[46:42] this in Ephesians 4:14 will no longer be
[46:46] children which means immature unskilled
[46:49] or foolish virgin see that's why the
[46:53] foolish virgin doesn't pay the full
[46:55] attention to the fivefold ministry so we
[46:58] don't want to be children we don't want
[46:59] to be amateur we don't want to be tossed
[47:01] and agitated like waves about different
[47:04] topics will I believe this for a while I
[47:06] believe that now I'm back and forth we
[47:08] want to be heading in one direction
[47:11] third is carried by doubts or
[47:13] hesitations or opinions these two kind
[47:16] of go together with toss and carry we
[47:18] don't want to be driven by doubt as we
[47:20] saw on Sunday we don't want our lives
[47:22] driven by doubt or fear or by
[47:24] materialism we want them driven by the
[47:27] revelation of the Word of God
[47:29] driven by the Holy Spirit guided by the
[47:32] Holy Spirit and
[47:34] lastly to see them so the the fivefold
[47:37] ministry when we receive it preaching of
[47:39] the Holy Spirit it takes to all the
[47:41] deception out of our life in other words
[47:43] it delivers us from roaming around
[47:45] aimlessly being led astray by this
[47:48] person following that person following
[47:50] that person following the fivefold
[47:52] ministry which is Christ in the fivefold
[47:56] ministry brother Branham said the
[47:57] fivefold ministry is God's dress wear so
[48:00] Jesus Christ hides behind the fivefold
[48:04] ministry amen to that I love the video
[48:07] because that's what I've seen I've seen
[48:09] all the preachers I've sat under you
[48:11] know brother brother Brooks Samuel Brown
[48:13] the different ones I've sat under I've
[48:15] only seen Christ in their lives pointing
[48:18] me to live a closer life to Jesus Christ
[48:21] and I believe all those who sit under
[48:24] the ministry God has given me they're
[48:26] drawn to be more like Jesus Christ not
[48:28] to be more like the world not to be
[48:30] foolish but to be wise and always given
[48:33] Jesus Christ the preeminence in their
[48:35] lives amen
[48:37] now one more couple couple more things
[48:41] here
[48:42] the reasons for a church family are
[48:45] numerous
[48:48] first is to feel God's love and to love
[48:52] God's people jesus said in John 13:35 by
[48:55] this shall all men know you're my
[48:57] disciples if you have love one for
[49:00] another
[49:02] that's the first one the second this is
[49:06] where we can really grow as a church I
[49:08] know Bride of Christ fellowship can
[49:10] really grow this when it kind of deals
[49:11] with gifts and and the move the moving
[49:13] of the Holy Spirit that's what we want
[49:16] right we came here we gather to hear
[49:18] preaching to the see our are spots that
[49:20] aren't as strong as they need to be and
[49:22] God can help us to be stronger amen
[49:26] second so love each other and feel God's
[49:29] love thank them for all the love I feel
[49:31] from all the saints of brandy Christ
[49:33] fellowship I hope you feel the love of
[49:35] our family
[49:37] second you need to be provoked or
[49:39] receive inspiration from others and
[49:42] provide inspiration to others and that's
[49:45] Hebrews 10 24 and 25
[49:50] now if you have your Bibles Church go to
[49:53] the first Corinthians 14:6 and why don't
[49:55] have what do you guys read that for me
[50:00] you sure enough that page back then a
[50:02] page from
[50:04] 1st Corinthians 14 6
[50:09] it was getting a little bit deeper here
[50:11] and the Word of God with with the home
[50:13] Church and a local church but it's part
[50:16] of your purpose it's part of my purpose
[50:19] if God is truly gonna bring our little
[50:22] church Bride of Christ fellowship back
[50:24] to the original the full book of Acts
[50:27] Church which we believe we're a part of
[50:29] that we've seen in parts of that but if
[50:31] we're to be restored fully back to that
[50:33] then we've got to have a first
[50:35] Corinthians
[50:36] 14:6 church experience so let me read
[50:40] out for
[50:47] [Music]
[50:54] all
[50:56] right so see Paul said when I come
[51:00] amongst you I've got to edify you're
[51:03] going to help you by either giving a
[51:06] revelation a knowledge prophecy or
[51:10] doctrine all right so that's what we
[51:13] want to do amongst each other for
[51:17] example we want to save somebody come to
[51:19] church and maybe give a testimony say oh
[51:21] I had a revelation the Holy Spirit last
[51:23] night I had a dream or it could be a
[51:26] prophecy I had a dream and the Lord
[51:28] showed me that this was this was gonna
[51:29] happen let's pray and see if it comes to
[51:31] pass see if it be the will of the Lord
[51:34] or if God had a doctrinal question and
[51:40] you brought the church and you asked me
[51:42] after after church or before church
[51:44] about a doctoral question and then if it
[51:47] was by the Holy Spirit put on my heart I
[51:49] could share with the Saints
[51:51] so see all these parts are all these
[51:54] ways to edify the bride of Jesus Christ
[51:57] are clearly stated right here in the
[51:59] Word of God a
[52:01] revelation and knowledge of prophecy
[52:03] prophecy or doctrine so these are things
[52:06] we should pray for before we come to
[52:08] church Lord will give me a revelation to
[52:10] bring give me a knowledge give me
[52:11] prophesied or give me some type of
[52:14] doctrine and this is this is real mature
[52:17] Christianity here remember the book of
[52:19] Acts church when it was born was the mo
[52:22] mature church and if we are gonna be the
[52:27] restoration of the backs we've got to be
[52:29] just as mature just like this church
[52:32] here
[52:34] all right
[52:37] now we need to be happier joyful and
[52:39] Jesus said this takes place by feet
[52:42] washing and taking community which we do
[52:45] that quite a bit
[52:47] that's John 13 17 if you know these
[52:50] things happy are you if you do them so
[52:53] you need a church family to take
[52:54] communion and wash feet with and the
[52:56] Bible Jesus said you'll be happy if you
[52:59] do these things if you show his death
[53:00] until you come and you do it sincerely
[53:03] you examine yourself before you take
[53:04] communion jesus said to be happy so we
[53:07] ought to be very happy by the grace of
[53:09] the Lord
[53:18] alright next is you'll learn proper
[53:21] judgment this is why we need a church
[53:22] family you need to learn proper judgment
[53:25] in church family situations and this is
[53:29] how to judge yourself and fellow church
[53:31] family members because the Bible said in
[53:34] 1st Peter 4:17 that judgment begins at
[53:37] the house of God when there's problems
[53:40] in the church
[53:41] different people have different problems
[53:44] with with each other or with with the
[53:46] pastor we need to learn how to judge
[53:49] who's right or wrong in those situations
[53:52] the
[53:53] Bible says that plainly in 1st
[53:56] Corinthians 6 2 through 4
[53:58] do you not know that the Saints will
[54:00] judge the world if the world should be
[54:02] judged by you are you unworthy to judge
[54:04] the smallest matters know ye not that we
[54:06] shall judge angels how much more things
[54:09] that pertain to this life so think about
[54:11] that if we're going to judge fallen
[54:14] angels and our testimony and our
[54:16] character will judge them then we cannot
[54:19] be scared to humbly judge between the
[54:23] Saints and the church if problems arise
[54:26] we shouldn't be scared because we're
[54:28] gonna have to judge fallen angels
[54:30] supernatural beings and how can we judge
[54:33] them if we're scared in the middle of
[54:36] conflict now I don't like conflict all
[54:37] the time I don't really know too many
[54:39] people who do but if we're to be the
[54:43] true family of God we've got to learn
[54:44] how to deal with problems and the family
[54:47] but so God will allow problems that
[54:50] happen to teach us how to judge
[54:52] between who's right and wrong in the
[54:55] family and if we're faithful with that
[54:57] if we can faithfully judge within the
[54:59] family then God will give us grace that
[55:01] judge fallen angels later
[55:03] see this is maturity this is not a milk
[55:07] sermon tonight and I hope everybody's at
[55:09] home same Amen you know asking you to
[55:12] bring a revelation to church asking to
[55:14] bring a doctor into church asking you to
[55:16] operate in a gift of the church that's
[55:18] not milk that's meat and this is where
[55:21] we need to grow into this is going to
[55:23] strengthen us this is to equip us
[55:25] without the vision the people perish and
[55:28] this is the vision that the true Bride
[55:30] of Christ Church are the world needs to
[55:33] have not just our church but anyone
[55:35] who's claiming to be a bride Church
[55:36] around the world we need to have this
[55:38] vision
[55:41] we need to learn to forgive and love
[55:44] like Christ within the church family
[55:45] that's an Ephesians 4:32 30 to let all
[55:49] bitterness and wrath and anger clamor
[55:50] evil speaking be put away from you with
[55:52] all malice
[55:53] be kind one to another tender-hearted
[55:56] forgiving one another even as God for
[55:58] Christ's sake has forgiven you so thank
[56:01] you everyone that I've heard that's
[56:03] forgiving me I appreciate that and I'll
[56:06] be happy to forgive you if you ever sin
[56:08] against me by the grace of the Lord
[56:11] okay
[56:13] so I just want to insert that how and I
[56:17] want to move on now but hopefully that
[56:19] showed the importance of having a home
[56:22] church and God's purpose for for you
[56:25] tonight for me tonight God's purpose is
[56:28] eternal God will I believe God wants us
[56:31] to review these things these are eternal
[56:33] truths and we need to remind ourselves
[56:35] of them especially for not manifesting
[56:37] in all these areas yet we need to review
[56:39] them pray about them ask God
[56:41] if this is a weak part in our life or
[56:44] this is a part where we're not strong
[56:45] yet God helped me to grow into that
[56:48] helped me to prepare myself so I can
[56:50] bring a revelation I can bring a
[56:52] prophecy I can bring a dream I can bring
[56:55] a word I can bring a doctrine that could
[56:58] be a blessing to people
[57:00] all right
[57:02] now let me take a few moments here and
[57:06] let me show more scripture about how
[57:10] God's purpose for you is absolutely
[57:13] secure so God's purpose for you cannot
[57:16] be thwarted it's already predetermined
[57:19] now all you have to do is submit to it
[57:22] all you have to do is obey it right
[57:25] because we know God will not if you want
[57:27] to go the permissive will of God and not
[57:29] do the perfect will of God God will
[57:30] allow that but if you want to do the
[57:32] perfect will of God and you want to walk
[57:34] in full obedience that purpose is is
[57:38] secure it's eternal it cannot be
[57:41] defeated the gates of Hell cannot
[57:43] prevail I it's a person who's received a
[57:46] revelation that Jesus is the Christ
[57:49] Jesus is the Messiah Jesus is God
[57:52] manifest in the flesh not a second
[57:54] person but the one person of God made
[57:56] flesh
[57:59] Romans
[58:02] 8:26 likewise the spirit also helpeth
[58:06] with our infirmities for we know not
[58:08] what we should pray for as we ought but
[58:11] the spirit itself maketh intercession
[58:12] for us with groanings which cannot be
[58:15] uttered and he that searches the hearts
[58:17] knoweth what is the mind of the Spirit
[58:19] because he maketh intercession for the
[58:21] Saints according to the will of God and
[58:23] we know that all things work together
[58:25] for good to them that love God to them
[58:28] who are called according to his purpose
[58:32] for whom he did foreknow he also did
[58:35] predestinate to be conformed to the
[58:37] image of his son that he might be the
[58:39] firstborn among many brethren
[58:43] so we've got to understand God's calling
[58:47] us to his purpose the only ones that are
[58:50] truly serving Jesus Christ or those who
[58:52] are taking up a cross they're taking up
[58:54] a heavy burden a heavy ministry and
[58:56] they're following him daily because
[58:59] they're called according to his purpose
[59:01] in order to find in your life you've got
[59:03] to lose your life lose your desires and
[59:06] then you find the life that Christ has
[59:08] for you because the sugar to say amen
[59:10] all right praise God and then God if he
[59:14] for knows you he calls you then he
[59:16] predestinate you then he conforms you to
[59:18] the image of his son
[59:22] all right Romans nine eleven for the
[59:25] children being not yet born speaking of
[59:27] Jacob and Esau neither having done any
[59:30] good or evil that the purpose of God
[59:32] according to election might stand not of
[59:35] works but of him that calleth so we know
[59:39] that Esau turned down God's call he was
[59:42] willing to sell out God's call just for
[59:45] food right and people today will sell
[59:47] out God's call just for a more higher
[59:50] paying job or a better looking spouse to
[59:54] get a second or third spouse and be
[59:55] adulterers the rest of their life
[59:57] they're willing to turn down God's call
[1:00:00] or purpose in order for temporary
[1:00:02] fleshly desires but God knew that Jacob
[1:00:05] had the true desire to do the God's will
[1:00:08] and God's purpose so God ordained that
[1:00:11] Jacob could rule over his brother and
[1:00:13] give him all the promises of the
[1:00:16] birthright praise God
[1:00:18] so see God's purpose will stand there
[1:00:22] firm God's purpose his intent for your
[1:00:26] life will stand as long as you see God
[1:00:28] like Jacob did amen as long as you're
[1:00:31] willing the rest of the Angels long as
[1:00:33] you're willing to say God change my walk
[1:00:35] I want a different walk I want people to
[1:00:38] see me walk different I don't want to
[1:00:39] fear anyone I don't want to be as scared
[1:00:41] I want to meet you and I want to wrestle
[1:00:43] with God until I get born again
[1:00:45] hallelujah that's what we got to have
[1:00:49] everybody my children everybody has to
[1:00:51] have that experience in order to be a
[1:00:54] real overcomer and to find God's purpose
[1:00:56] for their lives
[1:01:00] one more
[1:01:01] Ephesians 1 just kind of reiterating
[1:01:04] this this a very familiar scripture
[1:01:06] visions 1:9 but trying to hear God's
[1:01:09] Word tonight try to feed on this food
[1:01:12] from the Word of God
[1:01:14] having made known unto us the mystery of
[1:01:16] his will according to his good pleasure
[1:01:18] which he has purposed in himself
[1:01:23] so God let you know the mystery of his
[1:01:26] will according to his pleasure which he
[1:01:29] purposed in himself according to his
[1:01:31] intent that he had himself he made known
[1:01:34] the mystery of his will to you we should
[1:01:37] all say thank you lord we should all say
[1:01:39] Amen thank you for letting me know your
[1:01:41] will
[1:01:42] that the dispensation of the fullness of
[1:01:45] times he might gather together in one
[1:01:47] all things in Christ both which are in
[1:01:49] heaven and which are on earth even in
[1:01:51] him versa verse 11 partner
[1:01:55] in whom also we have obtained an
[1:01:57] inheritance being predestinated
[1:01:59] according to the purpose of him who
[1:02:01] worketh all things after the counsel of
[1:02:05] his own will praise God
[1:02:10] so whatever God allows that happened our
[1:02:13] lives that choices we didn't make things
[1:02:15] that seem unfair seems that the things
[1:02:18] that note that seem a surprise are out
[1:02:20] of the ordinary we have to remember that
[1:02:23] God predestined
[1:02:25] the purpose of his own will and the
[1:02:29] Bible said it was after the counsel of
[1:02:31] his own will so God had counseled God
[1:02:35] God God thought things over he knew
[1:02:37] things he never had a new thought but he
[1:02:39] already knew ahead of time through his
[1:02:41] wise heart and wise mind that you and I
[1:02:44] need an experienced a certain trial in
[1:02:47] order to bring about his purpose in our
[1:02:49] lives like we saw on Sunday as we saw
[1:02:53] with Garnett peak how God knew in order
[1:02:56] to stop him keep him from being an
[1:02:58] auctioneer that would go to hell I've
[1:03:00] got to drive him to me through polio I
[1:03:03] got to use polio to drive him to me
[1:03:07] God's wisdom God's predestinated a plan
[1:03:10] new that we don't like to hear that but
[1:03:13] that's that's the reality of the
[1:03:16] brothers testimony then brother Graham
[1:03:18] reassured us that his testimony would
[1:03:21] would either go against or for all the
[1:03:24] people in his community
[1:03:25] so sitting like this we're the we're the
[1:03:29] Queen of Sheba for Doylestown Ohio right
[1:03:32] we're that we're the Queen of Sheba for
[1:03:35] Akron Ohio
[1:03:36] some people might be the Garnett peak of
[1:03:39] Lima Ohio or whatever but in every
[1:03:42] community God once have a witness and
[1:03:44] those people who live the public life of
[1:03:46] Jesus Christ publicly God is going to
[1:03:49] raise them up and they're the witness
[1:03:50] they're the one that serve God's purpose
[1:03:53] and everybody's life will be judged by
[1:03:55] that life because garden had the fruit
[1:03:59] of the sphere of patience and that was a
[1:04:02] true fruit that God wanted everybody to
[1:04:04] see in that community
[1:04:06] and so we have to say God produce the
[1:04:09] fruit in my life that you want everybody
[1:04:11] to see praise God whether it's patience
[1:04:14] love joy peace longsuffering
[1:04:17] what fruits do you want Pete the public
[1:04:20] to see in my life like a Taekwondo what
[1:04:24] fruits does God want us to manifest a
[1:04:26] taekwondo that they can say mine that's
[1:04:28] a real christian they broke out the real
[1:04:29] love of christ they got the real fruit
[1:04:32] of long-suffering or they're so gently
[1:04:35] they're so meek they have such goodness
[1:04:37] where are whispering grace horses
[1:04:41] what do we want to what which of the
[1:04:44] workers see what fruit of the spirit
[1:04:46] does god want to produce in your lives
[1:04:48] that will be a public witness either for
[1:04:51] or against the people there
[1:04:55] that's what God wants to do God wants
[1:04:58] that you to have a purpose he wants to
[1:05:00] manifest the life of Jesus Christ to
[1:05:03] everyone around us so that should be
[1:05:05] going to whispering racehorses even more
[1:05:07] wonderful right that should be going to
[1:05:10] Taekwondo even more wonderful that
[1:05:12] should make me going to Arrowhead
[1:05:13] primary more wonderful knowing that I'm
[1:05:16] not going there more than just to do a
[1:05:17] job more than just to brush a horse more
[1:05:20] than just to do a form and and
[1:05:23] learn more about exercising but I'm
[1:05:26] going there to manifest and show them
[1:05:28] what the fruit of a Christian life
[1:05:31] produces
[1:05:32] praise God and that's all after the
[1:05:36] counts of his own will
[1:05:39] now here's the real meat of the sermon I
[1:05:43] want to get to right here
[1:05:46] just look at a few scriptures about how
[1:05:49] trials are allowed by God
[1:05:53] and we know as with Joe that God allowed
[1:05:56] Satan to
[1:05:58] bring all these trials upon Joe in order
[1:06:02] to frustrate
[1:06:04] job's purpose in life he wanted job to
[1:06:07] be frustrated you want a job to give up
[1:06:10] and curse God he really didn't want job
[1:06:14] dead he just wanted job to curse God
[1:06:16] okay so we got to make sure we never lay
[1:06:20] any evil to God's account if God doesn't
[1:06:22] answer our prayer for 5-meter first we
[1:06:25] should still send raise the Lord maybe
[1:06:26] the next five years I know havens gonna
[1:06:28] be praying for a horse for many years
[1:06:29] maybe maybe a few more years but each
[1:06:32] year she should say praise the Lord you
[1:06:34] know I'd like to be a full-time pastor
[1:06:37] and each year the passes I'm not I gotta
[1:06:39] say praise the Lord it's it's going to
[1:06:42] be in God's time or it's not going to be
[1:06:43] in God's plan we got to have enough love
[1:06:46] in our heart to know that God has
[1:06:48] ordered all of our steps according to
[1:06:50] his word according to his good counsel
[1:06:53] and His purposes must be accomplished in
[1:06:56] our lives not so much our purposes but
[1:06:59] the purposes of God
[1:07:01] so our text was job's 17
[1:07:05] and it was so awful for job
[1:07:08] job thought
[1:07:10] corruptions my father and worms are my
[1:07:13] mother and sister
[1:07:16] hi I'm family members with worms it was
[1:07:19] so awful for and but the main verse I
[1:07:23] want to point out again was 11 17 11
[1:07:27] my days are past my purposes are broken
[1:07:32] off
[1:07:33] even the intents of my heart I remember
[1:07:36] when I broke my AC joint I couldn't even
[1:07:38] move my arm
[1:07:39] I heard a crack and that that that joint
[1:07:44] fractured a broke and I heard the crack
[1:07:46] and it was instant pain and just paint
[1:07:50] got worse and worse and had to recover
[1:07:52] for you know I think it was four months
[1:07:55] and then had surgery and it was broken I
[1:07:59] was just broken had to be had to be had
[1:08:02] tied to heal it's very painful and some
[1:08:06] job has a spiritual pain of seeing his
[1:08:09] children pass away seeing his animals
[1:08:11] all died and being robbed and everything
[1:08:14] spoiled from him and then losing his
[1:08:16] health and he says my purposes are
[1:08:18] broken off I don't even have a purpose
[1:08:21] to live I don't have a purpose to go on
[1:08:23] the message of the hour I've lost my
[1:08:26] reputation right I've lost my church
[1:08:28] I've lost my family everything good
[1:08:30] about my message church and family is
[1:08:32] lost my purposes are all broken away
[1:08:35] from me
[1:08:36] they said my families I'm a family
[1:08:39] member of worms I don't know how you
[1:08:41] could get much lower than that do you
[1:08:43] children how could you get much lower
[1:08:44] than that I know more purpose
[1:08:48] everything I want to do is just down the
[1:08:50] the drain it's all ruined and my
[1:08:53] families I'm not even I don't have a
[1:08:56] human family anymore I'm family with
[1:08:58] worms
[1:08:59] it's about as low as you could get
[1:09:03] well what fruit was God producing again
[1:09:06] patience
[1:09:07] patience God wanted him to be in an
[1:09:10] example that you and I can look to for
[1:09:13] patience long job to get through this
[1:09:14] difficult time then surely I can get
[1:09:16] through it at least I've got my health
[1:09:18] or at least I saw my family I'm gonna
[1:09:20] lost all my money but at least I got my
[1:09:22] family I can make it through this I just
[1:09:25] got to be a little more patient
[1:09:27] that's right
[1:09:32] now wondering this quote this is from
[1:09:35] then Jesus came and called it brother
[1:09:37] man's making the point that Jesus shows
[1:09:39] up in your darkest hour and uses all
[1:09:42] these examples of Moses and Mary Mary
[1:09:45] and Martha and all these things after
[1:09:46] class was already died but he used his
[1:09:48] job and I just want to reiterate this
[1:09:49] again when all this distress came upon
[1:09:53] Joe his friends turned their back on him
[1:09:55] and accused him of being a secretive
[1:09:58] sinner I don't know if you've gone
[1:10:00] through that lately but hopefully you
[1:10:01] haven't had to endure that but job's
[1:10:03] friends literally turn their back now
[1:10:05] think about that if you had it so bad
[1:10:07] where your friends won't even text you
[1:10:09] back your pastor won't even text you
[1:10:11] back I mean that's very few people I try
[1:10:13] to text everybody back as far as I know
[1:10:16] your family turns their back you know
[1:10:18] Joe Matt is his life you know told me
[1:10:20] curse God and die his friends turned
[1:10:23] their back on him and yet he still never
[1:10:26] said anything wrong about God
[1:10:30] he said his wife turned him down
[1:10:32] everybody turned him down he said his
[1:10:34] breath was strange to his wife and all
[1:10:36] the things that happened to him and
[1:10:37] looked like even God turned him down
[1:10:39] look like it but it wasn't and he's
[1:10:42] going to die and go to the ground and
[1:10:43] God spoke to him and said now Joe gird
[1:10:45] up your loins I'm gonna talk with you
[1:10:48] and then God said you see the tree never
[1:10:50] send the flower never sin it served its
[1:10:52] purpose therefore was Dermott eyes one
[1:10:55] to another it didn't sin so it rises up
[1:10:57] again but a man that sins therefore he's
[1:11:00] cut off he said then Joe began to wander
[1:11:03] and then they got this dress just like
[1:11:05] Martha did when Lazarus died in the
[1:11:08] darkest hour when all of his influence
[1:11:11] had he lived it in vain so see he's
[1:11:14] wondering as I'm I lived in vain have
[1:11:16] all my purposes for being alive and cut
[1:11:19] off
[1:11:20] how would he speak to Joe he's a prophet
[1:11:23] how would God speak to him and my man
[1:11:25] said God spoke to him in a vision
[1:11:28] and brother man dramatizes it and he
[1:11:31] said the thunders roared the lightning
[1:11:33] flash and then Jesus came along and he
[1:11:37] said he saw Jesus in a vision and said I
[1:11:39] know my Redeemer liveth at the last days
[1:11:41] he shall stand upon this earth though
[1:11:43] the skin worms destroy this body yet in
[1:11:46] my flesh I shall see God whom I shall
[1:11:49] see the darkest hour then Jesus come
[1:11:53] along praise God we've got to be willing
[1:11:56] to wait until the darkest hour be
[1:11:59] willing to wrestle and fight against the
[1:12:01] devil push him back moving back and say
[1:12:03] noise there's still a purpose there's
[1:12:05] still something that God's trying to
[1:12:06] accomplish things are still
[1:12:09] not out of cater things are still as God
[1:12:12] planned I'm gonna put my trust me pretty
[1:12:14] soon Jesus Christ will show up amen
[1:12:20] now eventually see in chapter 17 job
[1:12:24] said my purposes are broken off my
[1:12:26] family's a bunch of worms you know I'm
[1:12:28] worms with family I'm sorry there's
[1:12:30] worms but in job 23 verse 8 job finally
[1:12:34] gets this understanding that this is a
[1:12:36] trial and that God's not against him but
[1:12:41] he gets this understanding it's a trial
[1:12:44] job 23-8 behold I go forward but he's
[1:12:48] not there and backward but I cannot
[1:12:50] perceive him on the left hand where he
[1:12:52] doth work but I cannot behold him he
[1:12:55] hides himself on the right hand that I
[1:12:57] cannot see him so he admits it's hard to
[1:12:59] find God this time in my life
[1:13:02] but he knoweth the way that I take when
[1:13:06] he tried me I shall come forth as gold
[1:13:10] so Joe finally gets their understanding
[1:13:13] this is a trial I can't feel God I'm not
[1:13:16] feeling his present I don't feel
[1:13:18] enthusiastic I don't feel goosebumps I
[1:13:21] don't see the Holy Spirit moving all
[1:13:23] around me but God knows who's the my
[1:13:26] integrity in other words God knows the
[1:13:28] ways that I'm
[1:13:29] passed I'm stepping in God knows the
[1:13:32] decisions I'm making and when he's tried
[1:13:35] me when he's finished trying me I'll
[1:13:37] come for with his gold amen and Peter
[1:13:39] said the same thing the fiery trials are
[1:13:41] more precious than what
[1:13:43] precious than gold
[1:13:46] so see what and that's how it is many
[1:13:50] times they begin a trial we think oh did
[1:13:51] I fail God is God done with me did I do
[1:13:54] something wrong and but pretty soon joke
[1:13:56] is understanding this is a trial I've
[1:13:58] just got to pass the test I've got it
[1:14:00] not say anything bad I'm just going to
[1:14:02] get through this and I know I'll be
[1:14:03] stronger at the other end aren't you
[1:14:05] glad God encourages us that at some
[1:14:08] point in our trial we finally get the
[1:14:10] revelation we just got to be faithful
[1:14:12] when this gets over we're gonna be
[1:14:14] stronger than we ever were before
[1:14:15] amen
[1:14:19] now chapter 23 go down to verse 14 I'll
[1:14:23] just skip ahead a little bit now I'm
[1:14:25] trying to go to 11
[1:14:26] 2311 my foot hath held his steps look
[1:14:30] he's he knows it he knows he's kept the
[1:14:32] Word of God his way of I kept and not
[1:14:35] declined
[1:14:36] neither I my going back from the
[1:14:38] commandment of his lips I've esteemed
[1:14:40] the words of his mouth more than my
[1:14:42] necessary food so see this is what Joe
[1:14:45] had finally understood Joe realized what
[1:14:49] God had already told the devil Jobe is
[1:14:51] the what a perfect man
[1:14:53] right Joe had made the sacrifices he was
[1:14:56] trusting in the blood he was trusting
[1:14:58] God for by the way
[1:15:00] and he said I know I've got the commands
[1:15:02] of God this is a trial
[1:15:06] verse 13 but he is of one mind hey who
[1:15:11] can turn him so sees that not three
[1:15:13] minds not three persons right God does
[1:15:15] have three minds three personalities got
[1:15:17] one mind
[1:15:18] who can turn him in what his soul
[1:15:20] desires even that he doeth
[1:15:25] verse 14 for he perform it the thing
[1:15:29] that is appointed for me
[1:15:32] such things are within
[1:15:36] so church be encouraged everything that
[1:15:39] has happened where it doesn't seem like
[1:15:41] it's right you search your life you feel
[1:15:43] like you have a life of integrity you
[1:15:45] haven't done anything purposely against
[1:15:47] God wrong we must have the same
[1:15:50] understanding his job that this is a
[1:15:53] trial God's going to make me a better
[1:15:55] Christian at the end of this and he is
[1:15:57] just performing what he's already
[1:15:59] appointed God had this appointed God
[1:16:03] knew this was going to happen in 2019 if
[1:16:05] we're still going through it in 20
[1:16:06] January 2019 God knew I'd go through
[1:16:09] this and God is with me he's gonna bring
[1:16:12] me through it I'll be better on the
[1:16:14] other end
[1:16:17] go to Ezra 4 verse 5 Malcolm this room
[1:16:20] when he's ready Ezra 4 or 5
[1:16:31] so here's another example about
[1:16:34] purpose and how we must understand
[1:16:37] trials
[1:16:39] are allowed by God but Satan tries to
[1:16:43] use those trials to make us give up on
[1:16:46] God's purpose in our life
[1:16:48] Jobe didn't give up though he felt like
[1:16:50] it he thought the purposes were all
[1:16:52] broken off but later he realized this is
[1:16:55] a trial to produce a better godly gold
[1:16:59] character my life Azra 4/5
[1:17:12] yeah chapter 4 verse 5
[1:17:23] alright so we know the scripture about
[1:17:26] zarubin being allowed to leave Babylon
[1:17:29] and come back to Jerusalem in order to
[1:17:32] rebuild the temple but the scripture
[1:17:36] plainly tells us even in the Nazareth
[1:17:38] writings here that once ezra got there
[1:17:40] he restored them all
[1:17:41] but the scripture plainly tells us that
[1:17:45] these evil men hired people just to
[1:17:48] frustrate god's people trying to restore
[1:17:52] the word of god for their age amen just
[1:17:55] like we're trying to restore true
[1:17:57] worship true worship under the right
[1:17:59] baptism in jesus christ name full
[1:18:01] immersion with the promise to receive
[1:18:03] the Holy Ghost we're trying to restore
[1:18:05] God's worship God's altar but yet Satan
[1:18:09] has planned all these ways to try to
[1:18:11] frustrate us try to discourage us and we
[1:18:15] just have to recognize and remember
[1:18:17] that's this is Satan's job he's trying
[1:18:20] to frustrate us we've just got to
[1:18:22] overcome frustration so we've got to be
[1:18:24] encouraged not be frustrated and that
[1:18:28] will help us overcome all the works of
[1:18:30] the devil the Bible said don't be
[1:18:32] ignorant of Satan's devices so you must
[1:18:35] recognize this is a device so this is a
[1:18:37] plan this is an attack of Satan our
[1:18:41] lives are pure he's just trying to
[1:18:43] frustrate God's / in my life and it's
[1:18:45] aruba bull could overcome satan's
[1:18:48] frustrations then we can because we've
[1:18:51] got the blood of Jesus Christ amen
[1:19:01] alright now let's go to 2nd Corinthians
[1:19:03] 1 verse 17 this is a scripture I've
[1:19:05] never really preached but it just says
[1:19:08] it plainly
[1:19:10] that we must not live according to
[1:19:12] purposes of the flesh we must live based
[1:19:16] upon eternal purposes we must let God's
[1:19:20] in eternal intentions direct our steps
[1:19:23] drive us forward not fleshly desires to
[1:19:27] drive a sport
[1:19:29] so sang Corinthians 1:17 lynnie can you
[1:19:32] read that for us
[1:19:36] [Music]
[1:19:46] okay so
[1:19:47] important in thien's he asked them to
[1:19:52] give an account of his purpose was was
[1:19:54] Paul guiding them by God's eternal
[1:19:57] purposes or was Paul guiding them by the
[1:20:00] the purposes of the flesh we know the
[1:20:03] Bible says in Jude that false preachers
[1:20:05] they have a god but their God is their
[1:20:08] belly they're only after
[1:20:11] feeding themselves helping themselves so
[1:20:14] they a basically are their own God right
[1:20:16] they they become their own idols right
[1:20:19] but Paul we know Paul did everything he
[1:20:22] could do to
[1:20:23] try to show the people he said he had
[1:20:27] all the rights to marry to take tithes
[1:20:28] and offerings he said I did none of
[1:20:30] those that I might be unblameable with
[1:20:35] the gospel
[1:20:37] so let this be a reminder that our
[1:20:40] purposes must not be of the flesh they
[1:20:42] must be of the holy spirit that's why I
[1:20:45] want to ask the church you know I remind
[1:20:47] everybody you know come early to the
[1:20:49] church if you feel led to do prayer
[1:20:51] meeting that's that's not a fleshly
[1:20:53] thing that's easy for the flesh to do
[1:20:55] prayer always takes crucified the flesh
[1:20:58] like Perry green said he said people say
[1:21:01] the 1940s and 50s was a revival it was
[1:21:05] easy to pray but he said it was never
[1:21:06] easy to pray it always took a sacrifice
[1:21:09] see the flesh must be crucified and it
[1:21:13] must be crucified not every Sunday but
[1:21:14] every day because we die daily so this
[1:21:19] is something that we gotta get a habit
[1:21:20] of doing every day dime died Wednesday
[1:21:23] died Thursday died Friday night Saturday
[1:21:26] and then the the blessings of all those
[1:21:29] deaths to the flesh will be felled on
[1:21:32] Sunday then we can bring a revelation
[1:21:33] that we can bring a doctrine then we can
[1:21:35] bring a dream or a prophecy then we can
[1:21:38] bring that if we crucify the flesh every
[1:21:40] day
[1:21:43] ok almost done here
[1:21:48] in these last few scriptures I would
[1:21:50] look at again recalling how we live with
[1:21:55] a purpose we have to know our purpose
[1:21:58] first God drives you to your purpose
[1:22:01] whether through trials before you're
[1:22:04] saved or maybe you're maybe you believe
[1:22:06] you're saved in a church but then God
[1:22:08] will drive you to the message of the
[1:22:10] hour
[1:22:12] like for me God drove me to the message
[1:22:14] of the hour through brother Simon and
[1:22:16] the Twin Towers falling 9/11 2001 on
[1:22:21] September 11 2001 that drove Simon to
[1:22:24] Bible study right and it's that that the
[1:22:27] word drove Simon to to bring it to me
[1:22:30] then of course you know I was hungry for
[1:22:33] God and I was always before the message
[1:22:36] came I was always wanting to hear
[1:22:39] preachers who had deeper teachings so
[1:22:41] God was driving me to deep teaching I
[1:22:43] went from you know just evangelical to
[1:22:47] to Baptist so evangelical water down to
[1:22:50] Baptist I was really enjoying the deep
[1:22:52] Baptist you know Christian hedonism
[1:22:54] teachings and so that prepared me to go
[1:22:56] deep or that when I heard the Serpent's
[1:22:58] see the message I could receive it
[1:23:00] because I've already gone a little
[1:23:02] deeper God was driving me to be able to
[1:23:05] hear this a hunger thirst for the true
[1:23:08] Word of God
[1:23:10] ok so let's just look at a few more
[1:23:13] scriptures before we close now acts 11
[1:23:16] 22
[1:23:18] X 11 22
[1:23:28] a
[1:23:29] missionary named Barnabas visited these
[1:23:32] Saints
[1:23:34] and when he leaves them listen to what
[1:23:37] he tells them
[1:23:39] and this is important for us because
[1:23:43] we've got to remember what purpose did
[1:23:46] we first have when we started out in the
[1:23:49] message
[1:23:50] some people was more it was a prayer
[1:23:53] life or they had a stroke passing out
[1:23:55] tracts think about that first love for
[1:23:58] God a purpose that you had and do we
[1:24:01] have that do we have that now
[1:24:03] that's we're gonna ask ourselves
[1:24:28] all right so just want to read that
[1:24:31] there
[1:24:32] so Barnabas was sent from Jerusalem out
[1:24:35] to the Saints to encourage the Saints
[1:24:37] these are new message believers and what
[1:24:41] his Barneses Barnabas's were to them he
[1:24:44] exhorted them that means to build them
[1:24:46] up he build him up and said with purpose
[1:24:49] of heart either cleave that means glue
[1:24:53] glue unto the word unto the Lord unto
[1:24:57] the holy spirit
[1:24:59] that's why I mentioned that earlier if
[1:25:02] we don't feel glued or connected to the
[1:25:05] word or to the prayer life or the
[1:25:08] witness and we used to the Bible study
[1:25:10] we used to do that then we've got to get
[1:25:13] back to that with Satan maybe have
[1:25:16] distracted us from our purpose and we've
[1:25:18] forgotten what God's intention was for
[1:25:21] our lives praise God
[1:25:24] so live with the purpose never know what
[1:25:28] God has called you to do know God's
[1:25:30] intention for your life this is what
[1:25:33] Holy Ghost filled Saints in the original
[1:25:37] book of Acts Church told the Saints to
[1:25:39] do so I know I'm preaching the word got
[1:25:41] tonight I know I'm preaching fresh manna
[1:25:43] the original Word of God
[1:25:45] everyone in our church needs to know
[1:25:47] their purpose and with their heart obey
[1:25:49] it from the heart not just from the mind
[1:25:52] I know I got to but pray until it's it
[1:25:55] agrees with your heart that yes in my
[1:25:57] heart I love them with this word of God
[1:25:59] and more with my heart I want to serve
[1:26:01] your purpose on this earth
[1:26:06] alright next a couple more here
[1:26:11] let's go to Daniel chapter one
[1:26:32] Daniel 1 verse 8
[1:26:48] can you just
[1:26:51] Daniel one eights are working on those
[1:26:53] pipes at the same time just to see how
[1:26:56] they're doing
[1:27:00] now Daniel 1/8 now
[1:27:03] living with purpose
[1:27:08] but Daniel purposed in his heart that he
[1:27:12] would not defile himself with the
[1:27:14] portion of the Kings meat nor with the
[1:27:17] wine which he drank therefore he
[1:27:20] requested the Prince of the eunuchs that
[1:27:21] he might not defy them so think about
[1:27:24] this Oh church if you just hear me I'm
[1:27:27] trying to hear her the Holy Spirit
[1:27:28] myself
[1:27:31] Daniels ministry was so great because he
[1:27:33] was so disciplined to God's purpose
[1:27:37] he was so disciplined to being undefiled
[1:27:41] and I hope that can be an encouragement
[1:27:44] to us tonight even our children and
[1:27:46] myself
[1:27:48] when you wake up tomorrow morning or
[1:27:50] when you go to bed tonight you have to
[1:27:52] know the purpose and our purpose can be
[1:27:54] this it can be this I am NOT going to be
[1:27:58] defiled with whenever I've been
[1:28:00] struggling with I'm not going to be
[1:28:03] defiled with hatred I'm not going to be
[1:28:06] the foul with bitterness I'm not going
[1:28:07] to be the file with hopelessness or
[1:28:10] depression or greed or covetousness or
[1:28:13] lust I'm not going to be defiled by this
[1:28:16] app on my phone I'm not going to be the
[1:28:19] file by that Hollywood movie that I want
[1:28:21] to see that you have to have that
[1:28:23] purpose in your heart Daniel this
[1:28:24] purpose I will not be defiled I know
[1:28:27] it's going to defile me or what could
[1:28:29] have found me so it's my purpose not to
[1:28:31] be defiled and that's very similar to
[1:28:34] the one we just saw in Acts chapter 11
[1:28:36] my purpose is the cleave to God I am
[1:28:39] cleaving to the word I'm not going to
[1:28:41] cleave to the Kings meat right I'm not
[1:28:43] going to cleave to the temptations of
[1:28:45] the world
[1:28:49] just like Samson lost that purpose he
[1:28:52] should have his purpose should've and
[1:28:53] I'm not going to give away my secret of
[1:28:55] my power
[1:28:56] but he did it he eventually gave that up
[1:28:58] he got he didn't cleave to the purpose
[1:29:00] of God like he could have
[1:29:03] right and so you can go through each
[1:29:06] person down through down through the
[1:29:08] Bible Moses and no and all these ones
[1:29:11] cleaving to God's purpose that was his
[1:29:14] purpose in life and that and I think
[1:29:17] that should be written down he knows
[1:29:18] this in the game Smith sermon from two
[1:29:20] years ago today he preached on having
[1:29:22] goals and maintaining goals
[1:29:24] and he said you know we Christians need
[1:29:27] to write it down and I agree we need to
[1:29:29] write it down if you've got a goal write
[1:29:31] it down meditate on it think upon it
[1:29:33] because if it's God's leadership it's
[1:29:36] good to write it down it's good to think
[1:29:38] about it it's good to meditate on it
[1:29:41] because if that helps you meditate that
[1:29:43] will help you overcome
[1:29:45] because remember there's eight things
[1:29:47] you can think I remember the eight
[1:29:48] things from Philippians four there's
[1:29:50] eight channels what sort of things are
[1:29:52] good holy pure of good report think on
[1:29:55] those things when you're writing it down
[1:29:56] you're thinking about that meditate on
[1:29:59] it make it that's my purpose I'm not
[1:30:01] going to be defiled by lust or
[1:30:03] bitterness or greed I'm not gonna be to
[1:30:05] file my purpose is to cleave to the Word
[1:30:08] of God and what did it produce in
[1:30:10] Daniels life a powerful testimony of a
[1:30:12] true prophet of God amen
[1:30:14] a
[1:30:16] man that predicted prophecies that are
[1:30:20] still coming to pass and mercy will
[1:30:22] finish coming to pass after the bride is
[1:30:24] even rapture the last three nine weeks
[1:30:26] of Daniel seventy weeks amen that's what
[1:30:29] that kind of purpose and devotion and
[1:30:32] dedication of Jesus Christ can produce
[1:30:35] in our lives it can have ramifications
[1:30:37] beyond our lifetime into the next life
[1:30:40] times in the next generations and and so
[1:30:43] forth
[1:30:45] hallelujah
[1:30:47] let's close to this this beyond that
[1:30:49] scripture so children you can stand you
[1:30:51] everybody can stand at home if they like
[1:30:53] to
[1:30:53] Psalm 17 Psalm 17
[1:31:05] I've known people that could use this
[1:31:07] scripture maybe this is their purpose
[1:31:09] maybe their purpose is at oh I don't
[1:31:11] want to be Lord I need to help me not to
[1:31:13] be defiled with this at work or help me
[1:31:15] not to be to file with this in my home
[1:31:17] baby you have to have a purpose not to
[1:31:20] be defiled by things that come out of
[1:31:22] your mouth if that's the case then you
[1:31:25] got a defiled heart you got to get the
[1:31:27] heart clean first because from the
[1:31:28] abundance of the heart the mouth speaks
[1:31:30] but this is something David battle this
[1:31:33] is something David prayed for and if
[1:31:35] David prayed for it we can pray for it
[1:31:38] so I'm 17 1 a prayer of David here the
[1:31:41] right Oh Lord attended to my cry give
[1:31:44] ear unto my prayer that goeth not out of

[1:32:03] things that are equal thou has proved my
[1:32:05] heart that I was visited me in the night

[1:32:11] nothing I am purposed that my mouth
[1:32:13] shall not transgress hey I think about
[1:32:18] that
[1:32:20] that was David's purpose I will not
[1:32:24] transgress with my mouth I will not say
[1:32:27] anything sinful

[1:32:31] file I'm not going to follow us up with
[1:32:32] the Kings meat
[1:32:33] Barnabas said your purpose in your heart
[1:32:36] should be cleaved to God and here David
[1:32:38] said my purpose is not to say anything
[1:32:41] evil with my mouth

[1:32:53] of that lips I I have kept me from the
[1:32:56] pass of the destroyer hold up my goings
