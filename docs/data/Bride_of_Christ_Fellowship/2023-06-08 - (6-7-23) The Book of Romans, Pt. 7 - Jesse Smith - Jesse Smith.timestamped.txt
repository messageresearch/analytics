[0:05] I just thought this might be an
[0:06] encouragement here to the church tonight

[0:24] Romans is part seven we've been looking
[0:26] at the book of Romans just preaching
[0:27] verse by verse and pulling out quotes
[0:30] from Brother Branham and uh all these
[0:32] wonderful thoughts here by God's grace
[0:34] it's such a joy to go scripture by
[0:36] scripture and we're resting on what Paul
[0:38] preached praise God and we're resting on
[0:40] the fact that brother Brandon preached
[0:41] what Paul preached Hallelujah as each
[0:43] Church age has to look at the messenger
[0:45] their Messenger will present them to
[0:47] Christ Hallelujah as a chaste virgin
[0:49] hallelujah amen what a blessing
[0:51] Hallelujah the messenger for each age
[0:54] presents the people to Christ Hallelujah
[0:57] so we're grateful for the message
[0:58] uh of the holy spirit that God gave to
[1:02] brother Branham and we're continuing
[1:03] that on by God's grace Romans 4 verse 11

[1:23] of Abraham a little bit deeper here a
[1:25] little more in depth here tonight as we
[1:27] mentioned on Sunday

[1:35] well how about I read 11 and we'll all
[1:38] read 12. how about that I'll read 11
[1:39] because
[1:41] and he received a sign of circumcision a
[1:44] seal of the righteousness of the faith
[1:45] which he had yet being uncircumcised
[1:48] that he might be the father of all them
[1:50] that believe though they be not
[1:52] circumcised that righteousness might be
[1:55] imputed unto them also let's read verse
[1:58] 12 1 2 3 and the father of circumcision
[2:01] to them who are not of the circumcision
[2:05] only but who also walk in the steps of
[2:09] that Faith of Our Father Abraham which
[2:13] he had being yet uncircumcised
[2:17] let's have one more word of prayer if
[2:18] you ever need on your heart let's make
[2:19] it unto God father God we thank you

[2:43] word of God strengthen your people Lord
[2:45] as the Bible says may we mix the word of

[2:51] scriptures and I pray God your minister

[2:55] people God we both need to be Anointed
[2:57] God that your will might be accomplished
[2:58] here tonight in Jesus Christ's name and
[3:01] the Saints said
[3:02] amen God bless you as being seated
[3:04] praise God hallelujah
[3:10] I really appreciate your prayers you
[3:12] know it does something for me to hear
[3:13] you pray too you know I I feel like you
[3:15] know I feel like I could just pray all
[3:18] the time in front of everybody but I
[3:19] sure like to hear your prayers that
[3:20] really does a lot to me
[3:22] so I appreciate you praying tonight by
[3:24] God's grace
[3:29] well yeah that too but tonight we just
[3:31] had such a small group I just gathered
[3:33] everybody around here and then I I felt
[3:35] led to ask you know can you pray for
[3:36] that can you pray for that because we
[3:37] had a long list of prayer requests and
[3:38] so we were I was feeling kind of small
[3:40] so I said well let's just gather here
[3:42] together you know like
[3:43] like a bunch of eaglets by God's grace
[3:47] you can switch over I do have some
[3:49] slides today so you know sometimes we'll
[3:51] do that brother at the end of service
[3:52] too like you know we've done that
[3:53] numerous times we've all come up here
[3:54] for prayer I said well who would like to
[3:57] pray for this or does anybody have any
[3:58] requests you know it just kind of makes
[4:00] a different experience and I sure like
[4:02] to hear people pray you know just
[4:07] so we want to start here where we left
[4:08] off you know we left off on Sunday you
[4:10] know showing
[4:12] that Abraham already had the
[4:14] righteousness of God before he had the
[4:16] seal
[4:17] and uh my wife let me know I asked that
[4:21] question I asked the question to
[4:22] everybody you know what was uh what was
[4:24] the New Testament anti-type of the Old
[4:27] Testament circumcision and of course I
[4:29] said it wrong so forgive me that's why
[4:31] nobody can come up with the answer I
[4:33] said it wrong
[4:35] and of course we know the anti-type of
[4:37] circumcision is the baptism of the Holy
[4:39] Ghost so forgive me my wife kind of said
[4:41] well you know brother Jesse you said
[4:43] that wrong and I'm like well I'm sorry
[4:44] about that that was my fault
[4:46] so in other words
[4:48] this scripture
[4:49] says that Abraham was already righteous
[4:52] before he had the seal
[4:54] that church this opens up the revelation
[4:56] of course that foolish virgin already
[4:57] righteous even if they're not born again
[5:00] it opens that Revelation up because this
[5:02] is a type right and then we have the
[5:05] anti-type we have you know Matthew 25
[5:07] verses 1 to 13 of the parable of the
[5:09] wise of foolish version
[5:11] you have later Matthew 25 uh the scene
[5:14] of the great white Throne judgment where
[5:15] Christ is Seated on the throne and then
[5:18] he separates all the Believers are all
[5:20] the people sheep as goats right and he
[5:23] gives eternal life unto the Sheep right
[5:25] but they're surprised how did we when
[5:27] did we ever do anything good for you and
[5:30] of course we know that that means those
[5:31] are the foolish virgins and those that
[5:33] are granted eternal life right and the
[5:35] bot and Jesus said
[5:37] he says that uh he said enter into the
[5:40] joys prepared for you from the
[5:42] foundation of the world so that means
[5:44] Jesus had all the foolish virgin in his
[5:47] mind as well
[5:49] right like brother random talks about a
[5:50] remnant of cloth right you cut out a
[5:52] certain cloth Haven's doing it right now
[5:54] for her dress she's making a dress it
[5:55] she's doing sewing camp this week
[5:57] learning how to sew with a sewing
[5:58] machine well she's got to cut a certain
[6:00] part of the fabric out right and
[6:02] tomorrow you're going to finish the
[6:03] dress so that dress is a type of the
[6:05] wise virgin praise God but everything
[6:07] that's left over we can still salvage
[6:09] some of that praise God
[6:10] and that be the type of the food is
[6:12] Virgin
[6:13] right and it's also a beautiful type of
[6:15] how the Bible says in second Peter
[6:17] chapter 2 that lot was righteous
[6:19] although he was vexed daily because he
[6:22] chose to live closer to Sodom and
[6:23] Gomorrah he chose it on purpose yet he
[6:25] was still a righteous man
[6:27] right without the seal
[6:29] right we don't even know if he ever got
[6:31] the seal but the Bible called him
[6:33] righteous well yeah he would have got
[6:34] the seal right because he would have
[6:35] been with Abraham's Group Well possibly
[6:37] I'm not sure on that one I have to I'll
[6:39] have to research out a little bit
[6:40] further by God's grace but one thing's
[6:42] for sure lot was called righteous by
[6:44] Peter
[6:45] so we have Abraham who had the seal lot
[6:48] who perhaps didn't have it now we know
[6:49] brother M says Abraham was a silver
[6:51] dollar and a lot was a penny right we
[6:54] know brother brother have said that in
[6:56] other words he's showing the wise and
[6:57] foolish virgin types in the Bible right
[6:59] all down through the Bible from Genesis
[7:01] to Revelation right so we can see that
[7:04] plainly
[7:05] but
[7:07] I hope that was a blessing you know uh
[7:09] Mr Brother Ray I just showed how Abraham
[7:11] was called out
[7:12] uh to serve God in Genesis 12 but it
[7:16] wasn't until nine years later that he
[7:18] got the seal
[7:20] but the whole time he was righteous amen
[7:23] praise God right and so did it can be in
[7:25] our lives right as soon as we repent and
[7:27] we're baptized we're forgiven
[7:30] we're righteous
[7:31] Jesus has Justified us praise God now
[7:34] the seal will come later on some longer
[7:37] than others it doesn't really matter
[7:38] though as long as you get the seal
[7:39] that's the main thing praise God make
[7:41] sure you get Born Again In other words
[7:42] press into the kingdom of God hallelujah
[7:45] don't don't hold back just keep pressing
[7:48] on just keep traveling on pretty soon
[7:50] you'll cross over Jordan amen hallelujah
[7:53] just keep believing God's word
[7:54] hallelujah
[7:56] keep applying the word of God to your
[7:58] life keep trusting in God's word keep
[8:00] making Footsteps in your walk with God
[8:02] and pretty soon you'll cross over into
[8:04] Jordan hallelujah amen
[8:07] now for tonight though I want to
[8:09] emphasize this next part just briefly
[8:11] that righteousness might be imputed unto
[8:15] them also
[8:18] Abraham was not necessarily a Jew right
[8:22] he wasn't because the Jews weren't even
[8:23] in existence yet Judah had not even been
[8:26] born yet right Abraham Isaac Jacob and
[8:29] Judah came out of Jacob right
[8:32] so there wasn't even Jew yet
[8:34] right but the Bible said that Abraham
[8:37] was given salvation and then a seal uh
[8:41] he was already righteous that
[8:43] righteousness might be imputed to the
[8:45] Gentiles also
[8:46] so this was a sign he wasn't even a Jew
[8:48] yet or there wasn't an official Jewish
[8:50] Nation or anything God was starting a
[8:52] nation with Israel or I'm sorry with uh
[8:54] with with Abraham but the fact was he
[8:57] was showing that God saved Abraham by
[8:59] Grace remember we saw that it was by
[9:01] faith only
[9:02] by grace through faith and he was
[9:04] already righteous and that was a sign
[9:06] that God can make us righteous as well
[9:08] Hallelujah that's what he says right
[9:11] here to them also not just the
[9:13] circumcision but the uncircumcision not
[9:16] just the Jew but you and I praise God
[9:18] Amen oh my God just church I think you
[9:21] know I think when when we have that
[9:23] Revelation and it's fresh in Our Minds
[9:25] when we have a revelation that's fresh
[9:27] that I am the righteousness of God we
[9:29] live differently
[9:30] right instead of living like I'm a I'm
[9:33] such a failure right instead of living
[9:35] I'm a failure or I'm sorry I struggle
[9:37] all the time instead of living like that
[9:39] we can live that I have the
[9:41] righteousness of Christ
[9:43] Christ has imputed righteousness to me
[9:45] all my sins are gone amen
[9:48] they're underneath the blood amen of the
[9:51] Cross of Calvary as far as darkness is
[9:54] from dawn praise God
[9:56] ah when we live with that understanding
[10:00] we live a different life praise God
[10:03] we don't live a life of defeat anymore
[10:04] praise God we live a life of Victory
[10:07] praise God
[10:08] Hallelujah
[10:09] now that verse of course reminds me of
[10:12] another book you're familiar with this
[10:14] now then what we are ambassadors for
[10:16] Christ the same writer Paul says as
[10:19] though God did beseech You by us we pray
[10:21] you in Christ's dead be you reconciled
[10:23] to God
[10:25] that means to be made uh right
[10:27] relationship again reconciled to have
[10:30] favor again
[10:31] you have favor with God you're in good
[10:33] relationship with God God's not angry
[10:36] for he hath made him to be sin for us
[10:40] who knew no sin
[10:42] that we might be made the righteousness
[10:45] of God in him wow what a what a
[10:49] statement that is Christ was made your
[10:52] sin
[10:53] Christ became my sin now think how ugly
[10:56] our sin was all of us all of us have sin
[10:58] that's ugly
[11:00] and Christ was made to be that sin for
[11:04] us
[11:04] Christ became your lies you're stealing
[11:07] you're cheating whatever it was
[11:10] your uh unfaithfulness lying whatever it
[11:13] was
[11:14] backbiting Christ became all that he
[11:18] took upon your sin that you might become
[11:20] his righteousness now think of his
[11:22] Holiness that's what you've got praise
[11:24] God
[11:25] it's imputed to you in heaven praise God
[11:28] Hallelujah
[11:30] what is scripture
[11:33] I just you know I just feel like
[11:35] wouldn't we just live so much higher and
[11:37] this scripture was constantly in our
[11:39] thoughts here
[11:40] Christ became my sin that means my sins
[11:43] paid for
[11:44] Jesus became my sin all of it not just a
[11:47] little all of it praise God
[11:50] the Bible said Isaiah 53 all of our
[11:52] iniquity was placed on him
[11:55] can you turn on that fan Malachi just
[11:56] pressed the power button three times
[11:57] that puts it on high it's a little warm
[11:59] in here tonight by God's grace
[12:01] maybe all that singing and shouting and
[12:03] praying and preaching maybe it makes us
[12:06] me hot up here so maybe that would cool
[12:07] me off
[12:08] hallelujah thank you Lord
[12:11] Christ was made to be sin for us
[12:13] now brother man says he never sinned and
[12:16] he wasn't a sinner he became sin
[12:20] sin was placed upon him but Jesus never
[12:23] sinned
[12:24] he never was a sinner
[12:26] Hallelujah he never he knew he knew no
[12:28] sin
[12:30] that we may might be made the
[12:32] righteousness of God in him Hallelujah
[12:35] so through Jesus we become righteous
[12:38] Hallelujah
[12:39] oh thank God
[12:41] think about uh you know the person who's
[12:45] writing this blaspheme Jesus
[12:49] if anybody was not worthy of
[12:51] righteousness it was the guy who wrote
[12:52] this amen
[12:54] he persecuted Jesus's people he took him
[12:57] off to prison he consented they should
[12:59] die we don't know that he killed anybody
[13:01] he'd stand there and say they deserve to
[13:03] die
[13:03] kill them
[13:05] blasphemy
[13:07] and this is the guy that says all my sin
[13:10] for that was put on Jesus and now I am
[13:13] the righteousness of God right how can
[13:15] our minds even wrap our we can't even
[13:17] wrap our minds around that praise God
[13:20] the guy who doesn't believe or doesn't
[13:22] shouldn't deserve it right we would
[13:23] think doesn't deserve it he's the one
[13:25] that says he's got it praise God
[13:27] and if he's got it you and I got it
[13:30] praise God
[13:31] amen
[13:33] a church we kind of laugh and say well
[13:35] no I'm the chief of Sinners no you're
[13:36] the chief no I'm the chief of Sinners
[13:38] right we try to Humble ourselves but
[13:40] Paul said he felt like he was the chief
[13:42] of sinners
[13:44] and yet he says I
[13:47] have the righteousness of Christ because
[13:49] Christ took all my sin
[13:52] praise God
[13:54] amen
[13:55] if we have trouble if we have trouble
[13:57] with our sin question well let's go
[13:59] listen to that day on Calvary because
[14:00] brother said Calvary settles the same
[14:02] question and let's read II Corinthians 5
[14:05] 20 and 21 let's read it over and over
[14:07] again amen hallelujah
[14:09] until we can be assured that Jesus Paid
[14:12] the penalty for all of our sins and that
[14:15] Jesus is righteousness is now given
[14:18] freely to you and I
[14:20] ah
[14:24] it's gracious what a promise man what a
[14:27] promise
[14:27] it's just like the Bible said Abraham
[14:30] live by faith
[14:32] he just believed God that's what we're
[14:34] going to get to he just believed
[14:37] he didn't earn salvation by Austin he
[14:39] just believed what God Said
[14:42] and then he did his best he just did his
[14:43] best to obey it
[14:45] Hallelujah he wasn't perfect I'm going
[14:48] to show you like five or six times the
[14:50] Bible says he just plainly failed God
[14:52] oh yeah there's all those seven or eight
[14:54] other times the Bible records he'd
[14:55] obeyed God hallelujah
[14:57] [Applause]
[14:58] in other words he was up and down up and
[15:00] down just like you and just like God
[15:03] forgave him God will forgive you too
[15:05] praise God
[15:07] just like we he didn't just he didn't
[15:09] look like he deserved God's
[15:10] righteousness but he got it so do you
[15:12] get it to praise God because the Bible
[15:14] said you're a child of Abraham
[15:17] he's your father praise God the
[15:19] spiritual father the Bible says
[15:22] and if he gets God's righteousness you
[15:24] get it too praise God
[15:27] if the dad got it the children get it
[15:28] too
[15:29] that's what the Bible says it's his him
[15:33] and all of his seed praise God
[15:36] how many know that God has blessed you
[15:39] and nobody can curse you how many know
[15:40] that
[15:41] that's
[15:43] I cannot deny that
[15:45] I deserved I've done things that deserve
[15:48] cursing yet God has blessed my life
[15:52] Sports you know full ride scholarship a
[15:54] nice job nice family like I don't
[15:56] deserve
[15:58] God's blessing but somehow I'm blessed
[16:01] sister who
[16:02] and I know I'm a child of Abraham praise
[16:05] God
[16:06] now look at your life you can say the
[16:08] same thing I don't deserve it I did this
[16:10] and that I I was ashamed of myself there
[16:12] I surely didn't deserve it there but yet
[16:14] all you can do is look at your life and
[16:16] say Jesus has blessed me Hallelujah
[16:20] Familia praise God
[16:23] like you know you know there's people on
[16:24] YouTube that they try to curse me and
[16:26] they don't like our beliefs and the
[16:27] message and I'm like that doesn't hurt
[16:28] my feelings you can't curse me God has
[16:31] already blessed me praise God you're
[16:33] just wasting your time typing out you're
[16:35] wasting your breath nobody can curse me
[16:37] because God's already blessed me
[16:39] Hallelujah
[16:40] he said it it's thus saith the Lord in
[16:42] uh Genesis 12 and Galatians 3 and 4
[16:46] praise God you can't curse what God has
[16:49] blessed Hallelujah
[16:58] the verse that means so much to me I
[16:59] don't know if I'm gonna go through this
[17:00] verse tonight I reached one verse
[17:05] Brother Brad says you could spend all
[17:07] months on just one of those seals you
[17:10] know just and that's like one or two
[17:11] verses
[17:13] and the father of circumstance says him
[17:15] to them who are not of the circumcision
[17:17] only
[17:18] are Gentiles
[17:20] but who also walk
[17:23] in the steps of that Faith of Our Father
[17:26] Abraham
[17:28] which he had
[17:30] yet being uncircumcised
[17:33] so Abraham had God's righteousness even
[17:35] though he didn't have the seal yet
[17:39] see even if you're not born again or
[17:41] wherever you are with God even if you
[17:43] are born again think about when you
[17:44] weren't born again you were already
[17:46] given Jesus's righteousness when you got
[17:49] saved praise God but really before the
[17:52] foundation World God already had it for
[17:54] you praise God you just recognize it
[17:57] when you got saved Hallelujah
[18:01] praise God
[18:03] what a blessing I want to emphasize this
[18:10] Abraham is the father
[18:12] is your father because you walk in a
[18:15] similar step as Abraham
[18:19] can everybody see that
[18:21] who also but who also walk in the steps
[18:25] of that Faith of Our Father Abraham
[18:28] so in Abraham's life we see a walk of
[18:31] faith and you see that same walk in your
[18:34] life
[18:37] see and remember Brotherhood said the
[18:39] three works of Grace were typed in
[18:41] Abraham's life
[18:43] praise God
[18:44] Genesis 12 was his justification Abraham
[18:47] come out from among them
[18:49] come into a place that I've separated
[18:52] you unto amen that was justification
[18:55] and then sanctification was he had to
[18:58] separate from lot
[19:00] right
[19:01] he had to get uh more about the Covenant
[19:03] in Genesis 15.
[19:05] and it wasn't until Genesis 17 that he
[19:08] actually got the seal so he was saved in
[19:11] 12 right Justified and then 13 14 15 16
[19:15] at the beginning of 17 for five chapters
[19:17] he's going through there's five
[19:19] sanctification amen Grace amen
[19:21] hallelujah and then in the Genesis at
[19:24] the end of Genesis 17 he gets the Seal
[19:26] of the baptism of the Holy Ghost praise
[19:29] God ah
[19:30] and then in Genesis chapter 21 he gets a
[19:34] body change Hallelujah and he brings
[19:36] forth Christ Hallelujah that's the type
[19:38] of the Rapture amen oh the body change
[19:41] amen hallelujah so we see the three
[19:44] works of grace and the Rapture in
[19:46] Abraham's life that's the steps you're
[19:49] walking into you're walking the same
[19:51] steps of the faith of your spiritual
[19:53] Father Abraham you're walking in
[19:56] justification sanctification baptism of
[19:58] the Holy Ghost body change for a rapture
[20:01] Glory
[20:03] Hallelujah
[20:08] these are a couple
[20:09] these are a couple of charts here I just
[20:11] want to show
[20:15] now when he went from herb child Dees to
[20:17] Heron it was 600 miles he traveled
[20:20] and then 50 miles
[20:22] South about I'm sorry Euros 50 50 miles
[20:25] south of Babylon
[20:27] now when he went to shecham it was 400
[20:29] more miles
[20:31] and then we went to Bethel it was 20
[20:33] more miles
[20:35] and that's where he built his first
[20:37] altar when he separated himself now so
[20:39] far look at the miles this man's
[20:41] traveled over a thousand miles that's a
[20:44] type
[20:45] now Austin how many miles was it to
[20:47] Arizona do you remember
[20:49] 2 400. so this guy reminds us of Abraham
[20:52] tonight
[20:54] boy is that
[20:55] it traveled a lot
[20:58] because God was moving him from place to
[21:00] place he had to have faith because God
[21:03] was calling him to travel
[21:06] and then sometimes he made mistakes and
[21:08] he traveled but God would call him back
[21:11] that's a that's a type of you and I
[21:13] making a decision it wasn't the right
[21:15] decision but God in his grace brings us
[21:17] back praise God to her sometimes it
[21:19] could be a long road back and the church
[21:22] said
[21:24] sometimes it can feel like a long way I
[21:26] got to go all the way here to get back
[21:28] with God sometimes you do praise God
[21:33] sometimes God's path you know sometimes
[21:35] to get back on God's path it seems like
[21:37] a long road but if you're a child of
[21:39] Abraham you'll reach that destination
[21:41] Hallelujah
[21:43] and praise God
[21:45] and then remember he went down to Egypt
[21:47] that was outside the will of God that
[21:49] was 225 miles now church he wasn't
[21:52] flying Southwest Airlines
[21:55] he wasn't driving in a Tesla
[21:59] this was walking now look he now think
[22:02] about that he walked
[22:04] 225 miles out of God's will
[22:10] sometimes church let me say like this
[22:12] sometimes we'll go 225 days out of God's
[22:15] will
[22:18] listen
[22:19] I had a friend in the message confessed
[22:22] to me I'm not going to try to give many
[22:24] details because I don't want anybody
[22:25] it's not this church
[22:27] I love my people I don't
[22:30] I just want to encourage you this friend
[22:32] said they've been out of the will of God
[22:34] I think it was for the last five years
[22:37] because they were trying to get worldly
[22:41] riches
[22:46] and I I don't know how much more I
[22:48] should go
[22:49] they were trying to be more I can say
[22:52] like this they're trying to be more
[22:53] comfortable in this world
[22:55] and they said they got out of the
[22:56] perfect will of God and into the
[22:58] permissive will of God and while they
[23:00] were chasing those better conditions
[23:01] better life conditions it their
[23:04] spiritual life suffered with them and
[23:06] their children
[23:07] and I say that with all the love and due
[23:09] respect and everything like that
[23:12] so C Church what I'm saying is that they
[23:14] can still be children of Abraham
[23:16] because sometimes you and I might
[23:18] disobey for months at a time
[23:20] or years at a time
[23:23] right
[23:26] 225 miles let's go Sarah come on
[23:29] let's in other words he said let's get
[23:31] out of the will of God come on let's
[23:32] let's go let's get in the permissible of
[23:33] God come on sir
[23:36] now Church think about if a pastor let
[23:39] think about if I led you out of the
[23:41] perfect will of God by preaching
[23:42] something false how many pastors have
[23:44] done that brother
[23:47] many
[23:49] and for years churches can get out of
[23:52] the will of God until God graciously
[23:54] brings them back
[23:56] we might not go 225 miles
[23:59] we might go 225 days
[24:03] and the church said
[24:06] the Bible said that you also walk in the
[24:08] steps of Father Abraham
[24:10] we all walk in the steps of Father
[24:12] Abraham
[24:14] now back remember he left there he lied
[24:17] to King the Pharaoh he had to come back
[24:19] 225 more miles he had to come back
[24:22] same way same thing you left you had to
[24:24] come right back to it
[24:26] and then he had to go to memory and
[24:28] Hebron which is 35 miles and then he
[24:30] went to hobot which was 160 miles
[24:33] and then from there he went to mammary
[24:35] 100 more miles
[24:38] and then he went to Greer that was uh 40
[24:41] miles
[24:43] and then from Greer to Bathsheba they
[24:45] don't list the miles there but then he
[24:47] went to Mount Moriah to sacrifice Isaac
[24:50] that was 55 miles and then back to
[24:52] Beersheba 55 more miles and then back to
[24:55] Hebron and his death 30 miles
[24:57] and again church that was walking
[25:00] or riding a camel or you know because
[25:02] remember his servant Elisa had camels to
[25:05] go get Rebecca
[25:07] riding a camel This Ain't Easy Living
[25:09] that's a
[25:11] that's not a lot of fun
[25:13] now some of these were good steps some
[25:15] of these were God ordained travels like
[25:18] awesome testified it was God's ordade
[25:21] ordination he had to get to Arizona to
[25:23] find Lena and he had to realize he had
[25:25] to learn all those lessons out in
[25:27] Arizona right brother it was God's will
[25:29] sometimes the only way to learn lessons
[25:31] is to disobey
[25:33] and we've all done it praise God so it's
[25:36] a great example of your faith you got
[25:37] the faith of Abraham brother you came
[25:39] all the way back to where you left God
[25:43] hallelujah praise God so did I I left
[25:46] god with worldly music so how'd I come
[25:47] back I had to come back through
[25:49] Christian music amen
[25:51] Hallelujah
[25:53] Wherever You Lead God that's where you
[25:54] got to go back and get him
[25:57] now look I put these red dots and I know
[25:59] this is really blurry but this was the
[26:00] best one I could find
[26:03] here he Abraham's called to serve God at
[26:05] 75 but remember he only partially obeyed
[26:08] so I put these red dots when he made
[26:09] some mistakes
[26:11] he only partially obeyed he took lot
[26:13] with him he wasn't supposed to take a
[26:15] lot with him
[26:17] right sometimes church we can get saved
[26:20] and we just make we just make the wrong
[26:22] decisions right after we got saved
[26:25] right
[26:27] my goodness
[26:30] he's given the Covenant there when he
[26:32] gets saved okay then he Journeys through
[26:34] Kane into and then uh then he he leaves
[26:37] once he gets there to Canaan there's a
[26:39] drought he leaves and goes down into
[26:41] Egypt that was a big mistake
[26:44] he lied to the king to the pharaoh
[26:50] remember City cowardly lied
[26:53] didn't protect his wife like he should
[26:55] have he was trying to protect his own
[26:56] life
[26:57] church we all do that sometimes all we
[26:59] think about is ourselves
[27:02] sometimes we'll do anything we'll lie
[27:04] we're cheat we'll steal we'll do
[27:05] anything to protect ourselves
[27:08] for being exposed
[27:10] that's just like Abraham
[27:13] and you walk in the steps
[27:16] I should have heard at least one Amen on
[27:18] that
[27:20] right we all do it amen I'll say Amen if
[27:22] nobody else wants to say I say Amen
[27:24] sometimes we protect me all three
[27:27] protect is number one we just take care
[27:28] of ourselves
[27:29] we all do it
[27:31] no one's perfect
[27:32] no one will brag in heaven say I never
[27:34] cared about myself I always served
[27:36] everybody else I never put myself first
[27:39] nobody will brag and say that
[27:41] we all fall short of God's glory
[27:45] right but then he came back
[27:48] okay
[27:49] he went up to Bethel what's the next
[27:51] things that happened
[27:52] uh he separated from a lot there's that
[27:54] sanctification he's starting
[27:56] I just can't serve god with this foolish
[27:58] version I've got to be with just message
[28:00] Believers
[28:02] I've got to be with just Believers of
[28:04] like Precious Faith praise God
[28:07] amen I've got to separate from the
[28:10] bullish virgin
[28:11] I've got to leave my denominational
[28:13] church I've got to join the message
[28:14] Church praise God
[28:16] I do that
[28:19] now look and then his lot gets captured
[28:21] he had to go fight and win a battle with
[28:24] the five Kings
[28:26] and then he meets Melchizedek on the way
[28:28] back and has communion
[28:30] that's where he started communion amen
[28:32] hallelujah hallelujah praise God now
[28:36] look he met Jesus he met Melchizedek he
[28:38] had communion but he wasn't born again
[28:40] that's a good type we talked about
[28:41] sister that's a good time
[28:43] see some people say you can only have
[28:44] communion when you're officially born
[28:46] again well it doesn't even work in the
[28:48] type
[28:49] it doesn't work he had type he had the
[28:51] Holy Ghost I'm sorry he had communion
[28:52] before he got the Holy Ghost over here
[28:53] got the circumcision here
[28:55] and the church said
[28:57] didn't the uh didn't the disciples have
[28:59] communion with Jesus on the night of his
[29:01] arrest
[29:02] were they born again what'd the church
[29:04] say no they weren't born again
[29:06] they are communion with Jesus before
[29:08] they were born again
[29:10] and see it's because people
[29:11] misunderstand the quote brother says you
[29:13] got to be born again to have communion
[29:14] that's before you had the Revelation
[29:16] that born again and the Holy Ghost
[29:18] baptism are one of the same
[29:20] hallelujah praise God
[29:22] amen
[29:24] and then after he wins the battle he
[29:26] wins his brother back he wins his
[29:27] brother from the world saves him out of
[29:29] the world
[29:30] then God shows him the Covenant
[29:34] remember that that was a beautiful
[29:35] Covenant remember he had to shoot all
[29:37] the birds away he started casting out
[29:39] Devils Brother Ray
[29:40] Hallelujah he speak to the devil you
[29:43] know shoot those evil birds away
[29:44] remember him so that's a type of casting
[29:46] out devils
[29:47] God had to put Abraham asleep and
[29:49] remember the furnace of the fire passed
[29:51] by remember that
[29:52] that represented hell but remember said
[29:55] God was showing Abraham you're worthy of
[29:57] hell
[29:58] but something died for you remember he
[30:00] killed and separated all those clean
[30:02] beasts
[30:04] he was showing him I'm making a covenant
[30:06] with you you had nothing to do with it
[30:07] I'm putting you to sleep well I'm gonna
[30:09] make a promise to you I'm Gonna Save you
[30:11] and all your seed all your Offspring by
[30:14] the blood hallelujah oh my God I'm
[30:17] saving you from the furnace of fire I'm
[30:19] saving you from hell because you're mine
[30:22] I chose you praise God oh that's a
[30:25] covenant praise God hallelujah that's a
[30:28] covenant hallelujah praise God
[30:30] amen
[30:32] but what does he do not right after that
[30:34] he lets his wife talk him into Marin
[30:36] Hagar lust of the flesh
[30:40] churches are he's already met
[30:42] Melchizedek he's met Melchizedek he's
[30:45] met God
[30:46] in flesh
[30:48] but he lets his wife talk him into
[30:50] taking another wife
[30:51] of course a concubine
[30:54] and boy what did that produce
[30:57] wild man
[30:58] still to this day
[31:02] Children of the Bond woman not of the
[31:04] free woman
[31:06] and they persecute they always persecute
[31:08] the true seed of God
[31:10] so right there church there's three big
[31:12] mistakes he's made
[31:14] but look he's got pretty good testimony
[31:15] he's got he's got more good than bad I
[31:18] already got more good than bad in your
[31:20] life amen
[31:21] hallelujah thank God Amen you know it
[31:24] you know you got more good than bad
[31:26] Hallelujah
[31:28] because you're walking in the faith
[31:30] right
[31:31] think about that most of the day we're
[31:32] walking by Grace walking obedience
[31:35] but then maybe once a day we fall
[31:37] shorter two three times we fall short
[31:39] what are you doing you're walking in the
[31:41] same steps that Abraham walked in
[31:47] and then ishmael's born
[31:50] okay and then now we get to Genesis 17.
[31:56] God uh God brings a covenant
[31:58] circumcision and what does Abraham do he
[32:00] goes out and he circumcised Ishmael he
[32:02] says oh let Ishmael live before you
[32:04] and then God visits him and says Abraham
[32:07] I'm going to give you a son from Sarah
[32:10] and Abraham laughs he laughs at God he
[32:14] said oh God that's a good one that's
[32:16] real good that's the Bible we read it
[32:19] Genesis 17 17. he laughed at God I think
[32:22] he fell on his face
[32:23] it was so funny
[32:25] and unbelievable he fell on his face
[32:31] 1717.
[32:34] then Abraham
[32:36] fell yeah let's read 15 and God said in
[32:38] Abraham as for Sarai thy wife Thou shalt
[32:40] not call her name Sarah I but Sarah
[32:42] shall be your name and I'll bless her
[32:44] and give thee a son also of her yea I
[32:46] will bless her and she shall be a mother
[32:47] of Nations Kings of people shall be of
[32:50] her then Abraham fell in his face and
[32:52] laughed and said in his heart shall be
[32:54] born unto him that is 100 years old and
[32:57] shall Sarah that is 90 years old bear
[33:00] he gets thus save the Lord and he laughs
[33:03] about it
[33:05] he's 99 years old
[33:08] and he's still laughing at God's promise
[33:11] God had already told him 25 24 years ago
[33:14] your seed is going to be like the stars
[33:17] of heaven and he thought oh through
[33:19] Ishmael he says God said no I'm doing it
[33:21] through Sarah and Abraham laughed to God
[33:24] I put a red mark for laughing at God's
[33:26] promise
[33:27] because God got the last laugh
[33:30] [Applause]
[33:38] it means laughter
[33:40] God God turned their laughing from
[33:43] mocking to Joy praise God
[33:45] Hallelujah they went from mocking and
[33:48] laughing a disbelief a laugh of unbelief
[33:51] and then God gives him a laugh of Joy
[33:53] hallelujah oh God has made me happy God
[33:57] 's made me glad
[34:06] Church you know sometimes it's hard to
[34:07] believe God's going to Rapture our
[34:09] church out of all the churches in Akron
[34:11] Austin visited some pretty beautiful
[34:12] Church haven't you brother in the last
[34:14] few weeks right
[34:15] pretty beautiful Church stained glass
[34:17] windows I visited some too over the
[34:19] years boy Brother Ray and then come to
[34:21] our place and you think
[34:23] God's going to Rapture this people
[34:25] yes
[34:27] Hallelujah
[34:28] yes amen
[34:29] I praise God why
[34:34] why
[34:37] in our hearts we might laugh or battled
[34:39] unbeliever or something like that but
[34:41] when the word of God comes down to who
[34:43] believes the word who's preaching the
[34:45] true revelation of God's word then we've
[34:47] got the best chance we've got the best
[34:49] possibility we've got thus hate the Lord
[34:51] praise God
[34:52] amen
[34:54] that's what the Bible says
[34:57] the dead in Christ shall rise for us and
[34:58] then we which are alive and remain Shall
[35:00] be Called together to meet them in the
[35:02] air and I heard Brothers say today and
[35:03] take insides with Jesus brother said
[35:05] let's live like the Rapture is going to
[35:07] be today
[35:08] he said but it might be in 100 Years bro
[35:10] right he said it might be 500 years and
[35:12] then he said it might be 10 000 years
[35:13] look it up
[35:15] because I I did a screenshot on my phone
[35:17] to make sure I was telling the truth
[35:19] look it up
[35:21] he said the Rapture might be in 100
[35:22] years well that would be 2062 we're
[35:25] coming up to that
[35:26] hahaha Hallelujah
[35:30] in other words let's just be ready for
[35:32] the Rapture praise God
[35:34] it's thus saying the Lord the Rapture is
[35:35] going to happen and we've got to believe
[35:37] we're a part of it just like Abraham had
[35:39] to believe I'm in the plan of God
[35:42] I'm in the program of God I'm walking in
[35:46] the steps of Abraham praise God
[35:49] amen
[35:51] so he laughed he left he laughed at God
[35:56] it didn't uh throw God off God wasn't
[35:59] like oh he's laughing at me
[36:02] God's like I knew You're gonna laugh
[36:04] but I'm greater than your unbelief right
[36:07] faith my faith is greater than your
[36:09] unbelief
[36:11] everybody's gone amen like brother Adam
[36:14] said unbelief does not hinder God
[36:16] hallelujah
[36:18] when the unbelief of a Believer doesn't
[36:21] hinder God God's will will be
[36:23] accomplished praise God Amen nobody can
[36:26] stop God
[36:28] even Abraham's laughter could stop God
[36:31] even Ishmael couldn't stop God
[36:33] nothing will stop God
[36:36] and then what's next in Genesis 18 God
[36:39] Appears himself
[36:41] Hallelujah
[36:43] and Abraham said Abraham's waiting for
[36:45] him under the tree in the plains he's
[36:47] just waiting for God I know God's going
[36:49] to show up I know he's going to show up
[36:50] I'm 99 years old God promised me I know
[36:53] he's going to show up and as soon as
[36:54] those three Messengers come the Bible
[36:55] said he runs out to meet them Hallelujah
[36:58] God is here God's spirit is visiting
[37:00] I've got a visitation from God he says
[37:02] Sarah go uh go kill the fatted cow go
[37:05] get some meat ready go make some bread
[37:06] ready God's here let's wash his feet
[37:08] praise God
[37:10] Church don't you know when God's spirit
[37:12] comes in here and you start praying or
[37:14] you start worshiping God you start
[37:16] crying or somebody starts jumping what
[37:18] you're doing is you're you're welcoming
[37:20] God you're entertaining God hallelujah
[37:23] when we start dancing around and
[37:25] praising God that's what we're doing
[37:27] we're entertaining God God is here amen
[37:31] I'm just making him feel welcome we're
[37:34] just watching his feet praise God
[37:37] as we prayed over here tonight with my
[37:39] tears running on my face that's the same
[37:41] as washing his feet
[37:43] it's the same yeah
[37:46] when you raise your hands or you shout
[37:47] hallelujah or you say thank you Jesus
[37:50] you're washing his feet
[37:52] yeah you're kissing the sun lest he be
[37:55] angry
[37:57] let's make Jesus for your welcome
[37:59] Hallelujah
[38:01] every time we come to church it don't
[38:02] matter who's here or who's not here
[38:05] Jesus is here praise God
[38:08] that's what matters Hallelujah
[38:10] amen
[38:13] Hallelujah
[38:17] so Jesus comes and meets him
[38:24] and then
[38:25] that's a time when Sarah laughed
[38:28] Sarah's behind him in the tent and God
[38:30] said I'll visit you next year about this
[38:32] time and Sarah will have a child and the
[38:34] Bible said Sarah laughed
[38:38] I'm 90 years old
[38:41] then God said why'd you laugh she said I
[38:43] didn't laugh God said you did laugh
[38:46] she's like she lied to God laughed to
[38:50] God and she was still a child of God
[38:52] hallelujah
[38:54] Church don't let the devil beat you down
[38:56] with guilt just say Lord I'm sorry
[38:58] forgive me my sins I'm still a child of
[39:00] God just like Abraham and Sarah praise
[39:03] God
[39:03] right I'm just trying to overcome
[39:05] unbelief I'm trying to overcome all
[39:07] these battles I'm trying to believe in
[39:09] miracles praise God I'm a man I believe
[39:11] in God's a miracle worker I may not be
[39:14] able to see it yet but I believe it
[39:15] praise God
[39:17] amen
[39:19] Hallelujah her laughter her disbelief
[39:23] doesn't hinder God
[39:25] neither does ours
[39:28] how about a high five brother I said how
[39:30] about a high five buddy glory amen
[39:33] our unbelief our mind battles our
[39:36] failures does not hinder God God will
[39:39] bring his promise to pass Hallelujah
[39:42] amen
[39:44] thank you Jesus
[39:46] and then the Angels go down to Sodom and
[39:49] what did Abraham do
[39:50] sister who he went to intercessory
[39:52] prayer he said God if there's 50 in the
[39:54] city spirit
[39:56] God said I'll do that Lord there's 40.
[39:58] Abraham must have knew there wasn't many
[40:00] Believers down there
[40:02] God said I'll do it if there's 30. I'll
[40:04] do it God there's 20 I'll do it Lord
[40:07] please forgive me I can ask one more
[40:09] time if there's 10 will you save it now
[40:12] look at his intercession there
[40:14] he didn't stop praying after one prayer
[40:18] church we got to keep praying
[40:20] isn't that just isn't that a perfect
[40:22] example Jesus said the like the the
[40:24] widow woman keep knocking Abraham didn't
[40:28] knock once and say can I have 50. he
[40:29] said with
[40:31] everybody's he keeps going on he keeps
[40:33] knocking we got to keep praying listen
[40:35] Church nobody else in Akron is praying
[40:37] like we're praying
[40:39] we're praying for the last Souls the
[40:41] last seed the last person to get the
[40:43] Holy Ghost for God to pour out his fear
[40:45] so we can go in the Rapture we've got to
[40:47] keep praying praise God
[40:49] amen
[40:51] I believe we've got at least a few years
[40:52] away because all my children got to get
[40:54] the Holy Ghost
[40:55] before I'm going that's just my humble
[40:58] request I don't have thou say the Lord
[41:01] but Abraham but Moses took all
[41:03] everything everything that it was in
[41:05] Egypt Moses took it out
[41:07] in that Exodus so I'm believing by God's
[41:10] grace
[41:11] there won't be one hoof left behind in
[41:13] my family
[41:14] I'm I cannot believe that I'm like I'm
[41:17] like Moses praise God Glory Hallelujah
[41:20] so are you we're the people of God
[41:22] Glory
[41:24] amen I like that praise God I'm going to
[41:27] believe that
[41:28] Hallelujah
[41:32] so he intercedes and then in the very
[41:35] next portions we see him lying to King
[41:39] abimelech the Philistine King he lies
[41:41] and said Sarah's not my wife Sarah's my
[41:43] sister
[41:45] Church he's already had God to visit him
[41:47] how many times
[41:48] chapter 12
[41:51] chapter 15 17 18. God has given him four
[41:56] visitations
[41:58] and he still lies
[42:00] he still lies he's still afraid of his
[42:03] life he's in that moment he's more
[42:05] afraid of the king than he is God
[42:08] right because he got caught in the flesh
[42:11] he got a spirit of fear on him
[42:15] but what overcomes fear power love and a
[42:19] sound mind
[42:20] in church it's just so amazing one day I
[42:22] hope God gives me the Revelation this
[42:24] at all the end of that lie God has
[42:27] abimelech pray or God God has God says
[42:30] abimelech Abraham has to pray for you to
[42:33] get the curse off your family but it was
[42:35] it was Abraham's fault that caused that
[42:38] curse to come
[42:39] Abraham's Abraham's unbelief caused
[42:44] the curse to come upon abimelech and
[42:46] pharaoh
[42:49] Abraham's mistake caused the trouble but
[42:51] Abraham's got to pray to get the trouble
[42:53] off
[42:54] them
[42:56] now somebody explained that to me
[42:59] I believe it
[43:01] I believe it but it just seems so
[43:02] strange
[43:03] sure and brothers said that's where God
[43:06] is God has predestination
[43:08] that shows God has ordained each one of
[43:11] his servants
[43:12] and giving them favor
[43:15] praise God
[43:17] bye
[43:18] now the next chapter Isaac's born in
[43:20] Genesis 21. Hallelujah
[43:23] the promised son is born
[43:25] they got a body change that's the type
[43:27] of the Rapture praise God it is
[43:30] Hallelujah
[43:32] chapter 22 God said go sacrifice the
[43:35] most precious thing to you
[43:37] now think about that I preached this
[43:39] years ago and didn't know what I was
[43:41] preaching way way long time ago
[43:44] last week was our 17th anniversary of
[43:46] our church brother last last Sunday
[43:48] but I think it was in like the third or
[43:49] fourth year I preached this where
[43:52] Abraham had to sacrifice the thing
[43:54] dearest to him and there was somebody in
[43:56] the church that was moving and the
[43:58] person that was staying that was their
[44:00] best friend moving
[44:02] they lost in other words the person in
[44:03] our church lost their best friend and I
[44:06] preached that right at the time when
[44:07] that person needed that they they in
[44:09] other words in other words they had to
[44:10] let that person go they couldn't sulk
[44:12] they couldn't cry about it they couldn't
[44:13] be discouraged about it God was testing
[44:16] them
[44:18] right
[44:19] sometimes God will test us do you love
[44:21] me more than
[44:24] something
[44:25] and you you put it there what do you
[44:27] love the most what do you cherish the
[44:29] most in your life your family
[44:32] your friends you know what
[44:34] and sometimes God will say I want to see
[44:37] what do you love more me or this other
[44:39] thing this other person
[44:42] and guess what he passed the test
[44:44] amen this person our church passed the
[44:47] test
[44:48] Hallelujah they told me about it as a
[44:50] testimony
[44:51] I didn't even know what I was preaching
[44:54] but see he's already Justified saying
[44:56] divided he's already got the Holy Ghost
[44:57] and God said I'm still going to test you
[45:00] to see what do you love most
[45:03] obedience
[45:05] or some other thing in life
[45:08] and you can put it in there put whatever
[45:10] you want in there
[45:11] what do you love more obeying God's word
[45:13] or His blessings more
[45:17] we ought to obey obedience more than all
[45:19] things that way you're a child of
[45:21] Abraham that way you know
[45:31] okay not long after that I'm sorry then
[45:32] Sarah dies
[45:36] she was 127 he was 137.
[45:40] now church this is amazing
[45:42] and then he goes and seeks a wife for
[45:44] Isaac
[45:45] that's a type of brother Branham right
[45:47] the messenger I'm sorry the servant
[45:49] being sent out to get a bride for Isaac
[45:51] so look we have two types of the Rapture
[45:52] in here brother I've never seen that
[45:53] till tonight you got the Rapture and the
[45:56] body change here when Isaac's born yep
[45:59] yeah there and he got the type of the
[46:01] servant the messenger going out to get a
[46:03] bride for Isaac

[46:53] brother man tell me more
[46:57] about Jesus Christ Our Lord
[47:00] amen
[47:03] thank God
[47:06] church and then after Isaac gets married
[47:08] he marries Katura and he has more more
[47:10] Sons I think he got three more Sons
[47:13] six more five more Sons
[47:15] but what's amazing about all that church
[47:17] is that the Bible said even before he
[47:20] had Isaac his inward parts were dead
[47:23] he could he was past the age of having
[47:25] children
[47:27] so the Holy Ghost anointing the body
[47:30] change that he got
[47:32] a lot of that power remained for the
[47:35] rest of his life
[47:37] because Brother Ray he didn't go back to
[47:39] being dead in his loins
[47:41] oh the power of the seed
[47:44] oh my goodness he got a body change and
[47:48] the power of the seed remained can I say
[47:50] like this the power of the seed in your

[48:11] ah
[48:13] the power of the seed
[48:17] the Bible said he was dead in his loins
[48:20] but even after God Isaac the seed power
[48:23] remained
[48:27] body change lasted
[48:29] going Hallelujah Glory thank you Jesus

[51:17] weary days and then

[52:09] gave us the Covenant praise God to make
[52:11] it
[52:12] the Sea of circumcision to make it
[52:14] praise God
[52:16] hahaha
[52:18] I can hardly get through two scriptures

[52:26] that's how you know God's in it my plans
[52:28] I always want my plans to fail praise
[52:30] God
[52:32] for the promise that Abraham should be
[52:34] heir of the world
[52:36] heir of the world
[52:38] was not to Abraham or to the Sea don't
[52:41] the Bible say the meek shall inherit the
[52:43] earth
[52:45] church let those people have the Yachts
[52:48] now let them have the vacation homes now
[52:50] they're only going to enjoy it for a few
[52:52] years but we get it for a thousand years
[52:54] praise God
[52:56] let them have it now let them make make
[52:59] it look like they're living something
[53:01] now they're living under distress they
[53:03] got to get drunk or get high all the
[53:05] time just to avoid uh the the hounds of
[53:08] hell that are chasing after them but we
[53:10] can worship God we can praise God we can
[53:12] know our blessing is in time to come
[53:15] praise God
[53:16] we'll rejoice in the future praise God
[53:18] we inherit the earth we get the Earth
[53:21] they get sent to prison but we inherit
[53:24] the earth We Rule and reign with Christ
[53:26] for a thousand years praise God
[53:31] blessed are the meek
[53:33] we shall inherit the earth
[53:36] Hallelujah
[53:39] the promise that he should be heir of
[53:41] the world
[53:42] hahaha
[53:44] Hallelujah
[53:45] I can't wait to see brother Ray's
[53:46] portion on the Earth
[53:49] hey brother hey can I come over I don't
[53:50] have to get on a cell phone I can just
[53:51] talk to him
[53:54] like right now I got a walkie-talkie but
[53:55] really we'll have a spiritual
[53:56] walkie-talkie I'll be like
[53:58] a channel to Brother Ray but already
[53:59] mind if I come over for a little bit
[54:03] yes sir I'll come right over
[54:05] hey everybody show me around your place
[54:07] man
[54:08] what what what portion how's the ruling

[54:14] how's the ruling and reigning going are
[54:16] you raining okay are you ruining okay

[54:19] this Rod of iron right here

[54:25] obedient to me by God's grace
[54:27] I'll say that's the same for me brother
[54:29] same for me
[54:33] heir of the world
[54:36] Hallelujah
[54:38] in other words we rule and reign with
[54:40] Christ for a thousand years This Promise
[54:42] was not to Abraham or to his seed
[54:44] through the law through all the works of
[54:46] the law but through the righteousness of
[54:49] faith
[54:50] now think about that promises are just
[54:53] received by what faith or Revelation
[54:55] which is also trust or assurance
[55:01] Abraham knew he'd inherit the world
[55:03] because he trusted God
[55:06] that's all
[55:07] he didn't work his way into it oh this
[55:10] time I'm not going to lie I lied last
[55:12] time to Pharaoh I'm not going to lie to
[55:14] abimelech and then I'll inherit the
[55:15] earth no it was that wasn't the case
[55:21] he failed again
[55:23] the guy still says you're my child amen
[55:25] you're going to inherit the earth you'll
[55:28] overcome that lion Spirit pretty soon by
[55:30] God's grace
[55:31] thank you
[55:33] I made a way you can overcome that I've
[55:36] already made the way for you I'm
[55:38] predestinated you to be an heir of the
[55:40] world praise God
[55:42] you'll overcome Because I Said So amen
[55:47] amen think about that you had to
[55:49] overcome a lying Spirit a coward spear a
[55:52] spirit of fear
[55:54] and maybe lust with Hagar I don't know
[55:57] who knows but he should not have taken
[55:59] her
[56:00] right
[56:01] God never told him to do that
[56:07] he overcame all that through what just
[56:09] through well God I'm going to do a
[56:11] better job today God you remember you're
[56:13] really going to see I do a better job
[56:14] today
[56:15] now church we want to do better
[56:18] we should do better
[56:20] but we can never earn the promise
[56:23] it's just given to us
[56:27] amen like a gift is just given to us
[56:30] I didn't ask for the gift it was just
[56:32] given to me
[56:34] that's what it was given to Abraham
[56:37] Hallelujah
[56:42] I think of that song Blessed assurance
[56:44] Jesus is mine over the foretaste of
[56:46] Glory to rhyme I'm an heir of Salvation
[56:48] purchase of God I'm born of a spirit
[56:50] washing his blood
[56:53] that's my Blessed Assurance amen
[56:56] Jesus is born amen
[56:59] Hallelujah
[57:01] what a blessing what a promise it's just
[57:04] my your Assurance trust in God I believe
[57:07] what God Said
[57:09] I believe what God Said brother Ram said
[57:12] the reason God gave
[57:14] gifts of the Holy Spirit and dreams and
[57:16] Visions is to give us more confidence in
[57:19] God's word
[57:21] brother Adam said God gave us the
[57:22] promise in the Bible brother answered
[57:24] that should be enough
[57:26] brother I said if I was God that'd be
[57:28] enough he said but God is so merciful
[57:30] not only does he give us the promises in
[57:32] the word he'll give us tongues and
[57:34] interpretation he'll give us Gifts of
[57:36] wisdom Gifts of knowledge the nine gifts
[57:39] of the holy spirit praise God and on top
[57:41] of that brother said then God will speak
[57:42] to people like Joseph and Mary in dreams
[57:47] and God does all that to make sure that
[57:49] his elect believe him praise God
[57:52] in other words God is going to make sure
[57:54] you believe his promise praise God

[59:30] there's a lot of people not in our
[59:32] church but there's a lot of people in
[59:32] other churches that could go to church
[59:34] but they sit at home instead well I'm
[59:36] just going to live stream it ain't the
[59:37] same
[59:39] unless you're totally consecrated and
[59:41] praying and fasting you're going to get
[59:43] caught up in your home life
[59:45] unless you're really devoted to God
[59:48] that's right
[59:50] Hallelujah
[59:52] the church we're not we're not slothful
[59:54] we're not lazy
[59:55] but we're followers of them who through
[59:57] faith and patience inherit the promise
[1:00:00] church if we need healing just look look
[1:00:02] at brother Ram's example you can look at
[1:00:04] any Bible example but look at brother
[1:00:05] Ram every seven years you get sick and
[1:00:07] he cry to God for healing and then God
[1:00:09] right then of his life heals him and
[1:00:11] Brogan thanks God for it now he doesn't
[1:00:13] know he's going to pass at that certain
[1:00:15] time he kind of knew he would there's
[1:00:16] quotes where it says like he knew he's
[1:00:17] going to pass soon but he still thank
[1:00:20] God for the healing so we should take
[1:00:22] courage from that
[1:00:24] God might let me go through trials he
[1:00:26] might let me suffer and things like that
[1:00:28] but I can trust God he's going to heal
[1:00:30] me someday praise God
[1:00:34] let's have faith like people that have
[1:00:36] had testimonies before us let's learn
[1:00:38] from their testimonies let's grow in our
[1:00:40] faith praise God
[1:00:42] Hallelujah
[1:00:47] for when God made promise to who the
[1:00:49] same one we're talking about Abraham
[1:00:51] because he could swear by no greater he
[1:00:53] swear by himself thank you Father
[1:00:56] saying surely I Will Bless thee and
[1:00:59] multiplying I will multiply thee God
[1:01:01] said it and so after he had patiently
[1:01:04] endured Abraham obtained the promise
[1:01:07] [Music]
[1:01:08] he was patient my laughter mom sister
[1:01:11] who come on Sarah come on let's go we
[1:01:13] got only got 50 more miles to go let's
[1:01:15] go come on we're gonna inherit the
[1:01:17] promise let's keep going just 25 more
[1:01:19] miles Malachi let's keep going don't
[1:01:21] give up just keep trusting in God just a
[1:01:23] few more weary miles and then we'll fly
[1:01:26] away
[1:01:27] just keep trusting God
[1:01:29] just patiently wait upon God and you
[1:01:33] will inherit the promise
[1:01:34] how many believe that
[1:01:39] see we have to be patient with God
[1:01:42] we have to trust God
[1:01:45] brother Ram said this about John the
[1:01:46] Baptist he said sometimes God will train
[1:01:48] a man for 30 years for six months of
[1:01:50] ministry
[1:01:53] six months is like that here we are six
[1:01:55] months in 2023
[1:01:58] it's been like that
[1:02:00] I'm like it's already halfway through
[1:02:02] the year Lydia already graduated high
[1:02:03] school what wait wait what
[1:02:07] she's already graduated
[1:02:09] what how it happened
[1:02:12] and for 30 years three decades John the
[1:02:15] Baptist had to be trained watching the
[1:02:17] serpents the locusts cutting down trees
[1:02:21] here to be taught it observed nature to
[1:02:23] sleep out in nature
[1:02:25] he had to wear camel skins
[1:02:28] he had 30 years of training just for six
[1:02:31] months of ministry
[1:02:32] and Jesus said there's never been a man
[1:02:34] born of a wound greater than John the
[1:02:37] Baptist
[1:02:40] it's not the quantity again it's the
[1:02:43] quality
[1:02:44] amen praise God hallelujah
[1:02:48] it's the quality of your walk with God
[1:02:51] that matters
[1:02:53] the Bible said he didn't do one Miracle
[1:02:55] Brother Ray so that means he was greater
[1:02:57] than Moses and Moses did all those
[1:02:58] miracles
[1:03:01] Moses was such a great man he said I'm
[1:03:02] going to raise up a prophet like unto
[1:03:03] him which was Jesus
[1:03:05] but Jesus said
[1:03:06] John the Baptist is greater
[1:03:10] because of his obedience that must be
[1:03:12] obedience the word of God
[1:03:14] where to see John the Baptist murdered
[1:03:16] anybody
[1:03:19] where you see John the Baptist failing
[1:03:21] to circumcise children and
[1:03:23] like Moses he was going to die for that
[1:03:25] church he's going to die
[1:03:30] where does he Moses where do you see
[1:03:32] John the Baptist glorifying himself
[1:03:33] Moses said you bunch of rebels I'll
[1:03:35] fetch you water on this rock I'll do
[1:03:37] Miracles myself
[1:03:38] and God said no you're not going the
[1:03:40] promised land because of that
[1:03:46] all John did was
[1:03:47] preach the word repent be
[1:03:49] nice
[1:03:50] repent be baptized I baptize you and
[1:03:53] then he says Behold the Lamb of God who
[1:03:55] takes away the sin of the world follow
[1:03:57] him praise God
[1:04:00] that's all I did he said I must decrease
[1:04:03] Christ must increase amen
[1:04:06] that's what we need today we need Jesus
[1:04:08] Christ to increase in our lives amen
[1:04:12] Hallelujah
[1:04:21] I want to see where I wanted to get to
[1:04:23] here let's see
[1:04:29] it's already 8 30. let me um
[1:04:33] Hallelujah
[1:04:35] I know about kill myself I feel
[1:04:38] I pray so hard I feel like I could
[1:04:40] just lay in bed all day Thursday
[1:04:44] I just get caught up in the Holy Spirit
[1:04:46] you know by God's grace
[1:04:48] Bible say we have to be a sacrifice
[1:04:50] present your bodies a Living Sacrifice
[1:04:51] to Christ
[1:04:53] verse 13 so we did
[1:04:55] that
[1:04:59] let me just go through this part here by
[1:05:01] God's grace now verse 14 for if they
[1:05:03] which are of the law be heirs
[1:05:05] faith is made void so if you can inherit
[1:05:08] if you can work your way to
[1:05:09] righteousness
[1:05:11] then faith we don't need faith
[1:05:14] like I heard brother Ramsay all right
[1:05:16] brother say this uh Rhode Ram said I
[1:05:18] have no power to heal
[1:05:21] brother said no man has the power to
[1:05:23] heal he said if you did he said that
[1:05:25] negates Calvary
[1:05:28] now think about that brother Ray
[1:05:30] Jefferson bill says the tapes are the
[1:05:33] absolute absolute means Unlimited in
[1:05:36] power
[1:05:38] brother Ram said so that's what that's
[1:05:40] what Webster's Dictionary says
[1:05:42] and brother Adam comes out on the tape
[1:05:43] that's what I show the contradiction
[1:05:45] they say every word is absolute every
[1:05:46] word is powerless I'm sorry powerful
[1:05:49] unlimited power and then Brothers says
[1:05:51] by his own words I have no power
[1:05:55] so how can the taste be the absolute if
[1:05:57] the one speaking on tape doesn't have
[1:05:58] any power
[1:06:00] can't be
[1:06:01] right
[1:06:03] my lover brother says I don't have power
[1:06:05] to heal if I did I'd heal everybody he
[1:06:07] said no man has any power for to heal if
[1:06:10] you've got power you took away Calvary
[1:06:12] well that means Calvary still has the
[1:06:14] power Amen in other words trusting in
[1:06:17] the blood of Jesus Christ is the only
[1:06:19] source for power Hallelujah
[1:06:22] let's trust in the Lamb of God let's
[1:06:24] trust in the shed Blood let's trust in
[1:06:26] the healing powers of the Holy Spirit
[1:06:28] praise God
[1:06:30] but he even says quote I'm powerless
[1:06:35] end quote
[1:06:39] they're saying he every word he said is
[1:06:41] unlimited power and brother man says I'm
[1:06:43] powerless
[1:06:45] now who are we going to believe
[1:06:47] Jefferson Bill or brother Bradham I'm
[1:06:50] gonna be brother Brandon on this one
[1:06:53] Hallelujah
[1:06:54] now who's really saying what the tapes
[1:06:56] say
[1:06:57] we are
[1:06:59] we're the ones saying what the tapes say
[1:07:01] praise God
[1:07:04] I've heard preachers even say this uh
[1:07:06] this week it's so sad
[1:07:09] they say oh all the tapes are even a
[1:07:11] preacher here in Ohio
[1:07:13] uh not locally here they're not not in
[1:07:16] this side of the state but they said
[1:07:18] every word on tape is uh is the absolute
[1:07:21] they said this message is the absolute
[1:07:23] every word on tape and they make the
[1:07:25] statement that don't even tell me
[1:07:26] there's a contradiction on on the tapes
[1:07:28] or there's a mistake on the tapes
[1:07:30] they said that's garbage to my ears why
[1:07:32] are you putting garbage in my ears
[1:07:35] I'm like
[1:07:36] who does this person even listen to the
[1:07:38] tapes that's why that's what I wonder do
[1:07:39] they even listen to the tapes I think
[1:07:42] they just listen to other preachers and
[1:07:44] how they get people to shout and they
[1:07:46] actually don't even listen to the tapes
[1:07:47] because I can't even go one tape without
[1:07:48] finding brother and making a human
[1:07:50] mistake but that's okay God look past
[1:07:52] his mistakes just like God look past
[1:07:54] Abraham's mistakes just like God will
[1:07:56] look past your mistakes and you're still
[1:07:58] a child of Abraham praise God
[1:08:00] brother I'm still a prophet amen he
[1:08:03] never made a mistake with thus say the
[1:08:04] Lord he just made mistakes with human
[1:08:06] mistakes like we all do his thus saith
[1:08:09] the Lord was invaluable but other than
[1:08:11] that he was a man he was fallible just
[1:08:13] like all of us just like all the Seed of
[1:08:16] Abraham praise God
[1:08:19] you know sister who as time goes on all
[1:08:22] these seeds are manifesting their fruit
[1:08:24] we're really finding out what people's
[1:08:26] fruit is I'm glad because I like to know
[1:08:29] what I like everybody know what fruit I
[1:08:30] got praise God because I believe the
[1:08:32] word of God
[1:08:33] but I'm not a William Brandon worshiper
[1:08:36] no
[1:08:37] Hallelujah
[1:08:39] brother Austin I'm a right down the
[1:08:41] middle of the road holy ghost-filled
[1:08:42] Saint praise God
[1:08:45] I take as much of the met I take
[1:08:47] Brothers coach as much as I can I take
[1:08:48] it from the Bible as much as I can I
[1:08:50] gotta balance right down the middle
[1:08:51] praise God
[1:08:53] but I see all these preachers even I
[1:08:55] mean the the tape guys are way over here
[1:08:57] on the extreme every word is not say the
[1:08:58] Lord but some of the preachers are going
[1:09:00] that way too
[1:09:02] just believe every word on the taper who
[1:09:04] are you to correct it ain't me that's
[1:09:05] correct in anything it's the holy ghost
[1:09:07] that finds Corrections
[1:09:09] Hallelujah
[1:09:12] hallelujah it's the Holy Ghost in us
[1:09:14] that finds Corrections when brother
[1:09:16] makes a human mistake it's the holy
[1:09:18] ghost that points that off it points it
[1:09:20] out so we can see it by God's grace
[1:09:23] Hallelujah
[1:09:26] thank the Lord Church
[1:09:29] Hallelujah I know where I stand by God's
[1:09:31] grace
[1:09:31] Hallelujah I've got this Brother Ray of
[1:09:34] over 85 just
[1:09:35] mistakes brother I made on tape not
[1:09:37] without say Lord just humor mistakes
[1:09:39] like he said uh
[1:09:42] like you said one place he said Enoch
[1:09:43] served God for 500 years the Bible says
[1:09:45] 365.
[1:09:49] brother Ram said women have sperm well
[1:09:51] we know that's not true they just got
[1:09:52] eggs
[1:09:54] I mean just simple things like that and
[1:09:56] preachers will have the audacity to say
[1:09:58] you got to believe everything on the
[1:10:00] tapes or you're it's garbage if there's
[1:10:03] contradiction on the tapes
[1:10:04] you must not be listening then
[1:10:06] that exposes you are not a listener
[1:10:11] you've exposed that your ears cannot
[1:10:13] hear right
[1:10:16] where is your discernment brother answer
[1:10:18] the two we need for this day is
[1:10:20] discernment of the Holy Ghost praise God
[1:10:23] to be able to judge between God's word
[1:10:25] and human opinions yeah
[1:10:27] yeah they said brothers did you prophesy
[1:10:29] that a million black people will die by
[1:10:31] Martin Luther King Jr but I said no he
[1:10:33] said I have nothing on it from the Lord
[1:10:34] that's just my opinion
[1:10:37] and they can't hear that sister who
[1:10:38] sisters oh they can't hear it because
[1:10:41] all they do is worship brother man
[1:10:42] worship around yet they they claim to
[1:10:44] believe the message
[1:10:46] I'm sorry the Holy Ghost will not
[1:10:48] worship brother Branham the Holy Ghost
[1:10:50] will only worship Jesus Christ
[1:10:53] a lot of the churches I don't care how
[1:10:55] emotional a preacher is the Holy Ghost
[1:10:57] will only magnify Jesus Christ praise
[1:11:00] God
[1:11:00] right the Holy Ghost will honor every
[1:11:03] Prophet every man or woman of God the
[1:11:04] Holy Ghost there's no respect to our
[1:11:06] persons with God
[1:11:10] right
[1:11:12] but the Holy Ghost will only worship and
[1:11:14] magnify Jesus Christ
[1:11:17] I'm gonna stop right there let's stand
[1:11:18] musicians can come here I better stop
[1:11:21] right there I'm just going to keep going
[1:11:22] here by God's grace
[1:11:24] Hallelujah
[1:11:26] let's just take one more
[1:11:28] all right let's just
[1:11:30] I just remember the promises of God
[1:11:32] briefly here
[1:11:36] Saints let me just say this in closing
[1:11:38] the righteousness of Jesus Christ comes
[1:11:41] on all those who walk in the steps
[1:11:44] of the Faith of Our Father Abraham
[1:11:47] now just by looking at Abraham's life
[1:11:49] briefly how many are encouraged that God
[1:11:51] still loves you
[1:11:54] how many are encourage that you're
[1:11:56] walking just like Abraham did
[1:11:59] Abraham had his UPS Abraham's had his
[1:12:01] Downs Abraham had his partial obedences
[1:12:04] and then he had his complete obedences
[1:12:09] Hallelujah
[1:12:11] in church God was building his faith
[1:12:13] look how his faith grew I didn't get to
[1:12:15] where I wanted to go tonight that's okay
[1:12:16] got it I guess I got where God wanted me
[1:12:18] to go
[1:12:19] but by the end of his life he can be
[1:12:21] willing to obey God so much to kill his
[1:12:23] son Isaac and believe God's going to
[1:12:26] resurrect him right there that's how
[1:12:27] much his faith grew
[1:12:29] now that's talk about being strong in
[1:12:32] the faith
[1:12:34] so early in his life he was afraid of
[1:12:36] dying at the hands of Kings like pharaoh
[1:12:39] at the end of his life he has so much
[1:12:41] Faith he could believe he could kill his
[1:12:43] own son and God would raise him up right
[1:12:45] there probably after three days amen
[1:12:47] probably after three days just like
[1:12:50] Christ Hallelujah
[1:12:51] amen he probably saw a vision of the
[1:12:54] Cross amen
[1:12:57] and he saw he saw the Seed of Abraham
[1:13:00] Jesus Christ then
[1:13:02] Rising on the third day he said well if
[1:13:04] he rose Isaac will rise praise God
[1:13:07] because he's a prophet
[1:13:09] the Bible said he knew that's a good
[1:13:11] rise if he died amen hallelujah my
[1:13:15] goodness thank you Jesus amen he's
[1:13:17] looking experience of dimensions and
[1:13:19] he's seeing Revelations and he had such
[1:13:21] faith God made him so strong at the end
[1:13:24] of his life and let me say like this
[1:13:25] church despite our trials God is going
[1:13:27] to make us so strong he can Rapture us
[1:13:29] praise God
[1:13:30] amen it'll be God doing it not us it'll
[1:13:34] be God doing it praise God
[1:13:36] we just gotta walk in the steps of
[1:13:39] Abraham
[1:13:42] confess our wrongs and keep believing
[1:13:46] keep believing keep walking in promise
[1:13:49] with God how many will walk in the
[1:13:51] promises of God
[1:13:52] let's bow our heads here for a word of
[1:13:54] Prayer
