========================================

series here by the grace of God by the help of God I told Brother Brian I said brother you just preached uh uh your best sermon I've ever heard that and I was I'm not saying that to lift people up you know I try not to lift people up but I can just tell he's really yielding and is the live stream on now okay so I won't say anything more but maybe after the live stream's over but um yeah I felt the Holy Spirit was really Discerning situations in the church I told Brother Brian that and he said brother Jesse I don't listen to anything you preach I said praise God brother uh so I was very thankful and I felt uh really Vindicated by the holy spirit that God's dealing with us helping us uh get through the trials we'll get through them by the grace of the Lord God's faithful and we just got a lot to be thankful for so very thankful God Is So timely so 1 Corinthians chapter 5 verse one by the grace of God this is part nine on the Corinthians series I don't have any slides uh we just had a crazy busy week here at school but uh after this week we get two weeks off so I'm be rejoicing in that I try to take a few naps and I don't know try to enjoy life a little bit by God's grace a little more I should say 1 Corinthians 5 vers1 let's just read verse one and then uh we'll have you be seated here by God's grace I want to watch your time hopefully I can finish in an hour maybe a little less we'll see on three one two 3 it is reported commonly that there is fornication among you and such fornication as is not so much as named among the Gentiles that one should have his father's wife what a text and what a letter to write uh from the St Paul God bless you as you're being seated may God add his Blessing to the reading of his word 1 Corinthians chapter 5 we're starting there now remember uh in verse uh well chapter four the previous chapter he ends with this question am I going to come and see you with a rod am I going to come see you in love or in the spirit of meekness now that was when he would physically get there now here in chapter 5 now he starts a new uh area here of we'd say sin in the church he spent the first four chapters on divisions and groups that isolate themselves away from other groups now see church we got to be real careful not to isolate ourselves from other people right if we see ourselves or other people not wanting to be around people uh we got to really watch that that's divisions like Paul was talking about here a Christian uh brother R said if you can't wait to get into the church to see your brothers and sisters in Christ he said something's wrong with you brother Ram said if you've got the Holy Ghost he said you can't wait for those doors to open and to worship with your brothers and sisters and the church said so you should be happy if you were happy to come here tonight by God's grace if not it's time to clean out your life Hallelujah get your heart right because if you got the Holy Ghost you can't wait to get to church worship God see your family that you're going to spend eternity with amen amen hallelujah that's right so it's a great Blessing by the grace of God he spends four chapters on groups that were divided in this case they're divided on ministers who was the best Minister who was their favorite Ministry who baptized them and we've been through that quite extensively and I thought that was great brother Brian I told him I said brother you preached uh on favorite preachers at the end he mentioned Le in the middle so I said brother you preached a perfect sermon between chapter four and chapter five Hallelujah because he mentioned four right divisions and then he mentioned L I said well I'm going right into l in chapter 5 I said brother couldn't have been more perfect so I was very thankful and he said brother Jesse I don't listen to anything you do on purpose I said thank you brother I appreciate that like I told Simon too you know I told Simon I said brother was such a wonderful message I said that's why I don't talk to Simon about anything Simon har list is to anything I say unless you know he said he woke up one time and Beth was playing something I was uh one of my videos there by God's grace but I love it I don't talk to those preachers I don't tell them any of our problems or any of my problems right I tell Jesus my problems and my wife uh and so we're thankful that God comes in here he knows how to give us the word of Truth praise God he knows how to discern the thoughts and intents of our hearts so we're very thankful we rejoice in what God has done now Paul said am I going to come with a rod when I come physically and be with among you or in love and the spirit of meekness well uh by history it looks like he came with the spirit of meekness because the people had repented but but as we can see right here in chapter five he's going to come with a rod in chapter five the rod there in the Greek if you look up the rod it means the most severe Christian punishment and so we're going to see the most severe Christian punishment here in chapter five is excommunication kicking somebody out of the church and saying don't come back until you repented your sins so Paul's going to write with the spirit of a rod to correct them uh like brother R said in that remember uh at the beginning of you remember when I preached on the Rapture brother Ram said I hope uh uh to make Sinners so ashamed of themselves that they'll become Christians at the end of this sermon so see you we should be ashamed of our sin it should make us ashamed of ourselves then we should repent and get right with God because of our sin Hallelujah so we should feel that conviction of the Holy Spirit now here in verse one uh 1 Corinthians 51 it says it's reported commonly that there's uh fornication among you I think it was if I'm not mistaken in chapter 1 wasn't it the house of Khloe that are reported to Paul these divisions let me just make sure I got that right let me peek back there yes verse yeah chapter one The House of Khloe you reported to the the uh the prophet of God so Khloe and Oliver House said listen you know we've seen this in the church we got divisions here this one was Paul Apollos and so we wonder if Khloe's house also let let him know about the fornication here we don't know um but see that wasn't tattling right it wasn't like tattling it wasn't backbiting it was just letting the prophet know because nobody in the local church was fixing it so hopefully somebody outside the church could fix it so that's why the house of Khloe let Paul know these people weren't even sad about their sins remember we're going to see right here they're puffed up they're proud of their sexual sin in the church so the house of kloe's like what can we do the pastors aren't making nobody's correcting it they reach out to the prophet of God hallelujah so a a man is sleeping with his stepwisely right this is and think of you know think of the news around us today you know you often don't hear things like this right a man with his own stepmother but church if you think about it you know this is really nothing new to the people of God if you think about it just for a moment I know it might might sound strange but hang on just a second God's people often struggle more with sin than even unbelievers in small little CA I'm sorry there are a few cases I shouldn't say often there are a few cases where God's people strugg with sin more than the heathens right Israel sinned worse than the heathens that God kicked out of their land there was generations of Jews uh for example Manasseh pull up 2 Kings 21:9 God says it plainly they've been in the promised land you know hundreds of years now and God said that they hekken not and manasse seduce them to do more evil than the Nations whom the Lord destroyed before the children of Israel so everybody see that that's that's scriptural uh so we shouldn't expect that sometimes Christians are going to do such awful things to put a reproach on the name of Christ now why is that now this just my guess this just me brother R says when people say they're Satan and Born Again Satan takes every gun he's got and he points it right at them every firing squad right every man with a weapon every woman with a weapon as soon as somebody says I'm filled with the Holy Ghost I'm a real Saint amen Satan comes around and says prove it and God lets him because remember Satan before he can come around there with every gun poin at you he's got to say uh God can I do this God will have to say yes or he'll say no that's why the Bible said lead us not into temptation we should pray that God don't don't suffer me to go through this hard temptation but Deliver Me From Evil Hallelujah see God doesn't tempt anybody but God allows us to be tempted that's why Jesus said we should pray God like it's just like brother R said uh said I pray all the time lord don't let your hedge go out from around me don't let Satan come in and attack me like a job situation that type of situation lead me not into temptation but Deliver Me From Evil Hallelujah now that's just my thought because Satan Works extra hard on the church or the Believers just like he did there uh the Jews that's one example so you know we should understand this has happened before sins that not even that don't even happen in the heathens can happen amongst Believers now why is that true also Church another reason why is people misuse Grace they don't understand that Grace doesn't lead us to a less Holiness it leads us into Holiness Grace should give us uh appreciation for God and help us to serve God more Faithfully Hallelujah like I listed all those things brother Brian I mean look at there's like a list of 20 sins he preached on 20 sins that stop us from worshiping God think about that and now I think I told uh our church you know I feel like our worships kind of gone down when was the last time we danced you know just spontaneously think about that well is it because of something we've done or is it just a season or but see each person's got to look at their life individually am I giving God my best amen think about that when was it are you really clapping like you mean it are you really raising your hands like mean it are you even saying amen like you mean it and you you don't have to I'm just saying like you know you you got to judge yourself but that's what God preached to us through brother Brian if you don't give God your all then then you're you're holding back you're robbing God of worship and you're bringing a a a a polluted sacrifice to the house of God hallelujah I'm going to get to more on that just a minute because I heard a good preacher preach something on that this week really good thought I was like wow that was good it was really timely right after I got done pray prayed in the prayer closet uh I heard this preacher say I'm like that was good so hopefully hopefully you like it as much as I did it's coming up pretty soon here it's pretty soon in my notes here so see we could expect that because Satan's got all of his guns pointed on the True Church of God and if God allows him to do it then we're going to go go through tests remember all those things job he struggled with oh I wish I was never born cursed to be the day I was even born I mean he he was on emotional roller coaster months of not sleeping well which he couldn't sleep on any side I mean he's got boils all over he couldn't find a good side to sleep on some days he'd have good days some days he'd had bad days cursing even the day he was born but yet the whole time God's like ah he's a perfect man he's going to stand the test he's going to overcome I wouldn't allowed him to go through it if I didn't know he wouldn't overcome it he will overcome and seven times in Revelation 2 and3 Jesus said he that overcometh gets the reward how many want to be Overcomers amen if you want to be an overcomer you got to overcome something got to overcome some test you got to fight some battle you got to fight some enemy you got to fight some wickedness you that means it's got to get close to you you got to fight it off Hallelujah we can do it by the grace of God hallelujah he gave us the greatest weapon he could give us the word of God verse two and ye are puffed up and have not rather mourned that ye that he had done this deed might be taken away from among you so they were proud of their sexual sin now that's hard to understand I don't know how that we've never had that in our church I don't know um I I don't know how this could happen but maybe again they tried to act like maybe I heard a I heard a preacher say this maybe they were trying uh to act like they were being gracious like Oh Brother son so yes I know you're in sin but oh God still loves you and God's going to bring you through and we're just proud you came to church but Paul says you've been proud about this sexual sin you should have done the opposite you should have mourned how can this guy keep coming to church like this God have mercy now not criticizing but feeling the weight of sin and make sin making you sad but here they get prideful about their sin well maybe they're saying well well we're the most gracious and loving Church in the message so that's why he can we're just glad he comes till he gets the Victory and Paul's like that's the wrong attitude Hallelujah with this sexual sin now I'm talking about sexual sin perhaps it was like Jude 1:3 Paul I'm sorry Jude said men of old were ordained to this Con condemnation to turn the grace of God into lasciviousness so that's just my guess I could be wrong again so again some of these statements are pretty uh interesting by St Paul hard to maybe be understood but sin should make us mourn should should or sin should not make us prideful now here's a new thought I had pull up Psalm 516 and I got it from a preacher it wasn't from the directly from the Holy Spirit or something like that I mean believe ultimately it was from the Holy Spirit but Psalm 51:16 and 17 two verses there so I check this thought I I thought it was just said beautifully and I probably can't do it credit but uh I really like this preacher in the message he said for this is of course after David's sexual sin with basheba now let's not don't don't turn me off think about if you've had a sin and you know you've done wrong and you haven't made it right yet that's what I'm talking about let's let this apply to us and not just well David or that that guy in Corinthians or that person out there let's apply this to ourselves and especially our worship because we just heard about that God sent a man in here to preach on our worship we got to give God our best Hallelujah is that right we got to give God our best or God doesn't receive it amen he only worship he only receives Worship in spirit and in truth hallelujah right verse 16 for thou Divi desire not sacrifice so after David's sexual sin God didn't want him to go sacrifice animals so when you sin God don't want you to stand up and and give give God praise and sing that's not the sacrifice God wants even God don't want you to clap and you know well I'll pay a little more extra in the tithe I'll give a few dollars of offering and I'll actually play pay some offering you most people don't pay offering right in a lot of most churches I mean all the pastors I've talked to a lot of people just don't give offering and that's that shows how much you love God now I didn't plan to preach on money I just came to me right now but look God doesn't Dei desire that God didn't devire desire David's sacrifice of animals else I would give it thou Delight us not in the burnt offering God didn't want David to go kill some animals the sacrifices of God are a broken Spirit God wanted David to cry about his sin that's what God wants for from us when we sin God don't wants to come and try to get through song service or pretend so so nobody thinks we're a hypocrite right pretend like we're worshiping God wants you to be sad about your sin that's the sacrifice he wants then when you repented and you feel the joy of the Lord you feel forgiven then start bringing some burnt offerings amen I just loved how it was said like that God don't if you're in sin don't try to pretend like you're happy and things like that give God a broken Spirit that's the sacrifice he wants so I heard a good preacher say that that was really good one of the best preachers I know I'm not going to name names because I don't want to get into that so see Church you know we got to God doesn't want us to pretend to enjoy song service or he wants us broken for our sin Hallelujah and yes I know we got to bring our bodies into subjection I'm not talking about that I'm talking about when you have sin that's not right and you're harboring things or like a brother listed all those sins and you don't make it right shame on us God wants us to have a broken spirit first then bring a sacrifice of praise Hallelujah 1 Corinthians 5:3 for I verily as absent in the body but present in spirit have judged already so see Paul said I've already judged this as though I were present concerning him that had done this deed now we're going to know why because he'd already wrote to them about not eating with fornicators they already knew his judgment and those who had the Holy Ghost in that congregation they already knew what Paul was going to judge because they're born again now was it must have been a small group right because there's a lot of sin going on there not much being confessed Hallelujah so this must mean the Holy Spirit should have convicted the Saints the real saints to know what Paul would have judged and Paul as we said he already we're going to see this he' already wrote to them at this is actually this this first Corinthians is actually the second letter of the Corinthians if you know your Bible real well which it's just a small point but see he said I've judged already what a prophet can judge yes a Prophet can judge but remember in chapter 3 Paul said don't judge anything before the time so that must be referring to a different judgment and it is that's referring to judging a Ministry to make a final decision well that brother's lost or that brother's a true man of God or that brother he's off the word a final judgment now see so that's the that's the one you leave up to God God will judge that preacher right now can we judge fruits absolutely we judge that's a good fruit that's a corrupt fruit we judge the fruits of people's lives Hallelujah but to make a final judgment just say Lord save that brother save that sister bring them to repentance help them Lord God I'm not making a final judgment amen but see we can judge individual situations and Paul says I've judged this man sleeping with his stepmom already hallelujah what about all these people that say don't judge me don't judge me don't judge me Paul's like I'm judging I'm judging I'm judging the corrupt fruits I'm not judging your Eternal destination I'm judging the current corrupt fruits you're spewing out before the church Hallelujah that's right so in other words Paul did not have a plank in his eye he could judge this the right way Paul wasn't sleeping around or doing other things like that Paul was living clean so he could judge this the right way right that's the only time you can't judge is when you got sin in your life that's when you shouldn't judge people's fruits because you've got bad fruits right Paul wasn't committing sexual sin remember in chapter 4 he said he didn't have any sin in his life it was 4 verse4 from last Wednesday for I know nothing by myself see I don't know nothing I I don't know any sin I've done wrong yet am I not hereby Justified but he that judges me is the Lord see it said as far as my conscience before God I don't have any planks in my eye Hallelujah I'm living righteously before God almighty Hallelujah now verse four now this one I used for water baptism see if you can see where I use it for water baptism a few years ago uh in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ when you're gathered together and my spirit with the power of our Lord Jesus Christ now how does this relate to baptism some people said well there's no power uh in the Lord Jesus Christ it's father son Holy Ghost I beg I beg your pardon he said in the name of the Lord Jesus and the power of our Lord Jesus Christ see there's power in the name of our husband Hallelujah there's wonderwork power in the Precious Blood of the Lamb Hallelujah that's right why didn't Paul say in the name of the father son Holy Ghost right why do you say Lord Jesus Christ because that is the name of the father son Holy Ghost Hallelujah and remember Paul said uh Jesus Christ revealed the gospel to him so Paul's going to make a judgment he said I'm judging this situation in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ now can you judge situations in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ in the next chapter he's going to say when there's problems in the church he said why can't you get judges around and see who can judge it right Hallelujah that's right and when you make the right judgment if you really under the spirit of God you can say I judge this in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ you better be right too or if not you're got a lying Spirit on you is that right that's what Paul did he said I'm judging this in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ I don't have sexual sin in my life but I can judge this I can judge this by the power of the Holy Spirit Hallelujah remember Paul said in Romans 2:16 all men would be judged by his gospel and Galatians 1 Paul said Jesus Christ revealed this gospel to me what the gospel of the power in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ Hallelujah and notice Paul said in the name of Jesus Christ and my spirit so what's he saying he said he's saying remember me Paul Paul said you have a 10,000 instructors but you don't have many fathers in in other words remember me I was a father figure to you in the faith I taught you the gospel I showed you the gospel you got saved under my Ministry praise God Amen and also he was a prophet of God he told them he was a prophet of God in 1 Corinthians 14:36 what came the word of God out from you or came unto you only he's talking about women no women preachers verse 37 If any man think himself to be a prophet or spiritual let acknowledge that the things that I write unto you are the Commandments of the Lord but if any man be ignorant let him be ignorant that's quite a statement there Hallelujah he said did the word come out of you no the word came out of me I met Jesus Christ in the desert Hallelujah Jesus revealed himself to me Hallelujah he's taking on that Apostolic Authority Hallelujah now look he says let the ignorant be ignorant so why didn't Paul say well no uh no I need to go to every single person and try to win them over because I believe Paul had the same revelation Jesus did Jesus said all that the father has given me will come to me praise God if you got the right spirit and if you really want the truth God will guide you into all truth hallelujah that's the promise he'll give you your heart's desire he'll give you every man and woman the desire of their heart like he gave balum right like he gave Paul each one God will give you your heart's desire Hallelujah so you must desire the true teaching of the word of God the true move of the Holy Spirit verse vers five so in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ verse 5 to deliver such and one unto Satan for the destruction of the flesh so this is the rod this is the absolute worst thing that could happen to a person a church would kick them out of church and they'd be given over think of that you're in the hands of angels but then you're then you're given into the very hands of Satan himself what worse thing could happen to a person than that where God's not going to come in and try to make any any help they're just going to be given over and suffer and suffer and shame and pain and he's going to K slowly kill you or quick try to quickly kill you into the very hands of Satan himself nothing could be worse than this but this didn't have to happen right and and it didn't happen because he realized I shouldn't live in this sexual sin thank God a prophet corrected me thank God someone's trying to correct me to get this evil spirit this evil spirit of Pride off my life amen thank God because someone told me the truth somebody tried to reach out to me thank God someone reached out to me so I'm not giv over into the hands of Satan himself Hallelujah deliver someone like that that won't repent that's prideful over their sins deliver someone like that over to Satan that Satan will destroy his flesh that the spirit may be saved in the day of the Lord Jesus so no doubt the church would have already had to follow the steps of Matthew 18 we talked about that a few weeks ago right uh go oneon-one but if it's a woman against a man well men and women that aren't married shouldn't be alone together so you got to take somebody else with you right so you got to take balance with the scripture so you go one to one if it's man to man or woman to woman if the person doesn't repent then you take another witness right and then if it won't repent then you take it before the whole church Hallelujah that's the scripture so Paul and and Paul must have known the Corinthians had gone through this process now what's interesting church is this look at this thought of uh God allows people to be given over to the destruction of their flesh to go through sufferings that they might be saved and they they might learn to obey the word of God he wasn't this man this man in sexual sin wasn't the only one I believe also the thief on the cross probably had to go through this God had to let him be crucified so he could run into Jesus his flesh was being destroyed but what happened happened his Spirit was saved hallelujah amen hallelujah brother said he knew many a man and woman that had to be put on their deathbed in order to repent of their sins what happened to that this is what happened even if they left the church see you can run you can run for so long but you can't run forever from God hallelujah and if you're a child of God God's going to chasen you and get you to repent he's going to do whatever he can to get that Soul saved hallelujah amen Jo had to suffer in order to repent in the whale's belly hallelujah king Manasseh we read about him earlier he let Israel get to the absolute worst state even worse than the heathens before that but yet he was captured by the Assyrians but then he repented while in prison and God heard his prayer think about that the message preacher that went the furthest into sin even if he would humble himself God would deliver him that's 2 Chronicles uh 33:12 you want to put that up there maybe about Manasseh I hope I typed that out right 2 Chronicles 33:12 and he was in Affliction there it is and he besought so he was getting you know just the the the prison food the prison water not getting a good diet and God had to break him down walk him across the desert in Chains God had to Humble him probably strip his clothes and embarrass him all this and finally after all that embarrassment and all that shame finally in his prison he can humble himself and recognize the presence of God and God can have his body and his health destroyed and then in that condition then God can get a repentant heart Hallelujah and God knew that's exactly what happened to get all that Pride out of his heart amen but no wonder brother said pride is such an awful thing people can't say they're sorry they can't get the victory right they think they're so great and all these lifting themselves above above over the other people just like Paul's dealing with in this church here such an awful thing but it took this all this Affliction he finally beseeches the Lord so before he wasn't seeking God before he wasn't going after God he can now he can finally while in prison with barely little food all the pain and suffering of prison and captivity slave life he can finally find a place of repentance Hallelujah doesn't this remind you of The Prodigal Son except his prison wasn't a physical prison it's a spiritual prison what does it take a starving man wanting to eat Pig's food that finally caused him to come to himself why am I living like this why did I do this why did I betray my father why did I betray my mother why did I betray my brother why did I do all this surely I I could live a better life if I just realize I sinned against heaven and I sinned against my father surely they'll receive me surely I can have a better life than this oh thank God people can come to their senses that their souls can be saved hallelujah thank God Hallelujah remember even Paul himself when he was first Saved he had to be blind for three days and not eat anything for three days to finally accept Christ blind right the flesh feeling like it's destroyed and then he still suffered all the eye trouble and then God still let uh Devils Buffet his flesh to keep him humble see God many times does many things in our flesh to keep us humble to save our soul Souls CU realize this flesh is going to end Someday my soul's going somewhere I'm not just a a a spoonful of uh Ohio dust as brother Ram said Kentucky Indiana dirt I'm more than just a spoonful of Ohio dirt you got a soul inside that that body that's worth 10,000 worlds Hallelujah and what about my last one what about Nebuchadnezzar God let him wander around for seven years years like a beast like a brother Ram said a no-brain animal like a no wit animal uh he had feathers like eagles and eating the grass like an oxen for seven years until he finally God let us get his mind back and realize who was really great who really gave them power who really gave him money and authority and all these things it was God that gave him that Hallelujah now what caused him to get away Pride as well so God had to let his flesh get into such a a spot where he was under so much torment so much uh beastly o overtaken his flesh like a beast so he could finally get his soul saved now that's what I thought was interesting it seemed like he got saved at the end but I don't know for sure because remember he writes that letter All Nations got to worship God the D or the god of Daniel right hallelujah amen so see church this isn't uncommon where God let somebody's flesh get destroyed in O in order to get obedience out of them verse six your gloring is not good so see this prideful think about that they were gloring in that oh thank God our brother's here thank God even though he's living in sin and sleeping with his mother well thank god he's here thank God for God's grace that he's here how is that even possible how could people glory in that see they they care more about church attendance than about obeying the word of God or public recognition they care about more than public recognition than getting sin out of our lives and you're going to see this was the church better with that sinner in the church or out the sinner out of the church which one out they were better Glory they were an unleavened church with that man out of the church they're a they're a new church they're a better Church Hallelujah without that sin that arrogant prideful sin in there they're a better Church they were like a brand new church if that person just didn't come to church right this is what he says don't you know a little leaven leavens the whole lump so because that man was in sexual sin Pride it affected the others because they didn't do anything about it they didn't get it out of the house they didn't get it out of the church the church is the house of God see pride against God and the propit of God is not good A little leaven leavens the whole church your sin affects the entire church and the church said remember brother McBride preached on secret sins ACH and secret sin I think it was 16 men died if I'm not mistaken 16 men died because of his secret sin in 1 Corinthians 11:30 Paul said even in this church they had people dying many were weak and sickly and many sleep because they didn't discern the Lord's body they didn't treat each other the right way so we got to remember that when people get weak sickly or die sometimes s it's because they don't discern the body of Jesus Christ that's right and think about this this church had them dropping it said many where's brother so and so where's sister so and so they're sick well I wonder is our life right with God do we ever ask that Hallelujah is that what the Bible says see secret sin is such a is such a a a trap remember the Bible says they get taken into the I was going to preach on I had a thought on this on Sunday about just preaching on the snares of the enemy the Bible said they get trapped in Satan's snares at Satan's will so that means the person gives into Satan's will they want to do Satan's will instead of God's Will and then he said pre-venture they have to acknowledge their sin in order to get out of that snare but if they don't acknowledge their sin they're going to stay in that trap like a trapped mouse in a mouse trap because that's what we have at our house right how many m m have I seen that mouse trap the glue glue trap now now we use glue traps and yet that's what happens when people are exalted in Pride and they won't confess their sins and this church in Chan Church they were gloring in it oh praise God the brother's here hallelujah thank god oh he's all right at least he's coming to church at least he's got a chance to repent no he knows he should have repented a long time ago and don't eat with that man kick him out of the church because you tried once you tried it again okay now he's out right verse 7 Purge out therefore the old leaven so now he tells them you got to purge it out that ye may be a new lump a new church as ye are unleavened now look at this Paul's speaking by faith you are unleavened in one way what by the blood of Christ by the blood of Christ when everyone's living right we are an unleavened Church no sin among us then then Jesus said then ask what you will right he said abide in me my words abide in you and then ask what you will and see if I won't do it Hallelujah he said so he's speaking by by faith and also by the eyes of Grace you're unleavened but you got some little leaven in there for even Christ Our Passover is sacrificed for us hallelujah now remember there was all types of 11 I got that uh list I I shared with you there was all types of 11 I'm going to give you the verses today herod's leav the leav of Herod mark 8:15 was worldliness and sensuality some people so have S such a a a lure to the world they're always into movies or worldly music or porn as we talked about all these things that's that's a leav that's a sin and people are attracted to that like Herod was attracted to that right people those aren't the only ones right there there's everybody falls under one of these the Sadducees was leav of the Sadducees in Matthew 16:6 it was false Doctrine they denied the Supernatural and the afterlife and Angels they denied that so was just all about right here right now right denying the the supernatural things of God days of Miracles passed right the leaven of the Pharisees mark 8:15 as well was hypocrisy now how many message people do we have like that or just churches in general they say one thing but they do something else oh I'm living right right with with God I'm right with God and they're not living right with God because God knows their life Hypocrites right uh what they they try to put on a public front church we all know that people come to church act like everything's okay nothing's okay that's the Le of the Pharisees that's hypocrisy now the Le in the Church of Corinth was sexual immorality or carnality we just read that being prideful about sex ual sin puffed up prideful this the leav of galatian now doesn't say Le but we know all sin is leav was legalism about circumcision and bringing in the law of Moses and requiring things that were not in the Bible Galatians 2:4 Galatians 3:1 he said they were Bewitched right so taken over with an evil spirit an evil spirit had seduce them into adopting a a a legalistic false Doctrine well isn't that the same then being seduced by sexy women right with this guy or seduced by his mother-in-law somehow mother-in-law I'm sorry stepmom stepmom Ephesus I couldn't find much Le in there which is good thing they're the Ephesian church right the mature Church the Colossians they battled mysticism and will worship so just worshiping however your will instead of God's will that's in Colossians 2:18 so now get into a little too far Supernatural Well an angel visit me how many preachers today say angel visit me angel visit me and what they say is not in the word of God or for some other person at a different time that's le le if that doesn't get stopped it's going to spread through the whole church well then everybody becomes a prophet everybody everybody meets an angel everybody has a prophetic dream everybody has prophetic this prophetic that prophetic that and watch if it comes to pass Hallelujah in Philippi they had division as well remember he said he listed two women in Philippians uh 2:4 it was Y udias and ctii or something like that Philippians 4:2 and then they had sorry then they had an anxiety pardon me so they had women that were divided women arguing fussing the church and they got anxiety Paul says be careful for nothing don't worry about it so they battled the spirit of fear anxieties the Thessalonians had lots of things but their main thing was lazy men and gossipers that's in 2 Corinthians 3 I'm sorry 2 Thessalonians 310 11 and 12 Paul said if the man don't work he doesn't eat he said there're a bunch of busy bodies going from house to house of the church members spreading lies now I've heard a modern day example that let me tell you that uh a pastor had died and so they're trying to vote on the next pastor and so all these people in the church that wanted a certain certain Pastor went from house to house like a bunch of politicians instead of praying on it and letting God do it they tried to do it and now that church is even split because they got the pastor they wanted because of their politics and now it's split because uh the pastor did some false Doctrine so what good did that do a whole lot of nothing we just need mature people is what we need we need mature people who have the Holy Ghost that's what we need now I'm going to look go back to 1 Corinthians 5:7 for even Christ Our Passover is sacrificed for us so now Paul brings this thought get the leaven out because it's we're in the Passover how many remember the Passover in Exodus 12 the death Angels come into every house it's G to pass it will pass over if you've got the blood of the lamb but it if you got Le in your house you'll die so what does it mean we can't let sin get in our life we can't be addicted to sin and have unconfessed sin because the death angel could strike right there could destroy the flesh right that the soul might be saved hallelujah look at that it's a beautiful type you got to get the leav out you had to get all the leav out before the Passover the lamb started getting uh examined on the 10th day it was killed on the 14th day just like Jesus was examined when he come in on on uh uh uh what was the uh Palm Sunday Palm Sunday four days later he's killed same thing 10th day 14th day same exact thing amen Rose three days later on the 16th day Hallelujah the Feast of first fruits Hallelujah he Rose thank God so Paul said get the leav out of your church because you're in a spiritual Passover now how did you uh get the the Passover the token the baptism of the Holy Ghost amen so clearly this man sleeping with his stepmom did not have the token because he said death is going to pass over him and if he doesn't repent he's going to be killed that his soul might be saved see the blood was publicly applied and that allowed the death angel to pass over their houses see we got to have the Holy Ghost in our homes as well Hallelujah got to keep our homes clean do everything we can do to keep sin out of our homes H Allelujah so see by God's grace if we have the Holy Ghost death has passed over us we pass from Death unto life Hallelujah and we live because he lives also Hallelujah now in the natural I love brother Brooks's sermon he called it the mighty lamb the lamb the mighty Lambs those little lambs delivered two million people from slavery God gave them deliverance and also Freedom naturally speaking but because Jesus Christ The Mighty lamb gave his life he gave his life for an innumerable multitudes of Believers not just two million but so many like the stars of the heaven Abraham seed that cannot be numbered amen oh Hallelujah one lamb Jesus Christ took all of our sin on him that we might be unleavened that we might be saved Hallelujah and he made us free and he delivered us so why should we be in bondage to sin when the lamb has made us free hallelujah amen just got to get the lamb out I'm sorry the leav out Hallelujah you got to get the lamb in and get the leaven out pardon me and this Mighty lamb delivered us from sin slavery and eternal judgment not eternal hell Eternal judgment the Judgment would last eternally the person would be annihilated the soul would be annihilated but the Judgment the sentence would last eternally eternally separated from God so what is it true what does it say Church Christ is our Passover what was the Passover it was the meal they had to eat the meal they had to get all the leaven out they had to eat in haste the bread was just Ms of bread it was just like this hard bread like we eat it we didn't have time to let that rise we're we're in The Exodus the death Angel's coming the leaven got to be out Christ is our Passover meal and the the cross of Jesus Christ was our Passover meal Hallelujah you must eat my body Hallelujah take this body which was broken for you Hallelujah that's the communion and we take the word of God we take the word Hallelujah in Jesus cross is our spiritual Passover Hallelujah he died for me amen he died to take away all my sins he took my sin that I might have his righteousness amen Christ is our Passover Christ is our UNL bread what was leaven I'm sorry what was unleavened Feast it was removing the leaven what was the unleavened bread in the spiritual Jesus tomb was unleavened there was no sin in that house amen or you can say Jesus body was the was the house there's no sin in that body amen hallelujah so we had death of a lamb no sin and if we follow all these things we're going to get the fir the Feast of f first fruit sorry we're going to get a resurrection Hallelujah if we can have the Passover Lamb if we can have all these things no leaven surely we'll get the Feast of first fruits we'll get the resur rection Hallelujah Jesus said because I live ye shall live also amen Christ is our Pentecost our Feast of Weeks Hallelujah 50 days later Christ is our trumpet and I'll say our last Trump because the last Trump shall sound and the dead in Christ shall rise first our bodies will be changed in a moment and the twinkling of an eye now the last Trump for Israel of course I'm sorry the Trump for Israel the Feast of the trumpets is the two witnesses of Israel now I found out today too this is pretty awesome too I watched a Jewish I was listening to a Jewish man I didn't watch him I was listening to a Jewish man talk about the modern day Passover and they said at the very end of the Passover there's a knock on the door and it opens up and one of the children pretend to be Elijah and then Elijah announces the Messiah is coming hallelujah amen a't that like Moses and Elijah amen Moses and Elijah in a minister for three and a half years and then they're going to say we're going to die but Messiah is coming Jesus is coming hallelujah oh my Hallelujah glory to God think about that Elijah is still in the modern Jews Passover Elijah is connected to the second coming of Jesus Christ hallelujah oh my just like on uh just like on Mount Transfiguration Moses Elijah Christ Moses represents the dead in Christ Elijah represents the saints that don't have to die Hallelujah but then Elijah that then that's typed also those two also go to the 144,000 and Elijah is already recognized in their in modern day Jewish houses oh it's Elijah he's going to bring in the Messiah because of Malachi 45 and6 hallelujah amen Christ is our holy day our day of atonement right Christ will make us holy on one day when we get a body change Hallelujah the day of atonement for Israel is 144,000 get in the baptism of the Holy Ghost and Christ is our Feast of Tabernacles Tabernacles was dwelling in booths right so what's what's our Feast of Tabernacles it's the millennial Hallelujah the honeymoon with Christ and his wife Hallelujah I taught this week at middle school Bible Club on uh The Book of Revelation and afterwards this little H Fifth Fifth Grader comes up and said Mr Smith she said I never understood this how can men be part of the bride of Christ because uh they're men and how can they be a woman married to Jesus how can a man be married to a man I said that's a very spiritual question little one and I said it's not natural it's a spiritual thing I said Christ is the head and all men and women who love Jesus are submitted to his spirit in the spiritual I said it's not a physical love it's a spiritual love how many love Jesus with all your heart amen hallelujah that's a good question that's a very spiritual question there well she goes to church a lot so that's part of the reason why I've known her family for years in fact her Grandpa asked me to preach in May so I can't do it now I got to let them know they're having a men's conference in May we got Lord willing got the baby coming so won't be able to do that want to preach at his men's meetings there in akan Hallelujah so Paul says get that sinner out of the church now you're going to see what he says at the end chapter about this guy he calls him brother at the beginning wait till you see what he calls him at the end some of you looking ahead in your Bible verse eight therefore let us keep the feast what we're supposed to keep a Passover yes keep the sin out of your life if not it's going to impact other people in the church like I've seen that you know some of the sin that goes that I find about our church you know if it's not confessed or people don't confess it it keeps me up it worries me I find myself struggling because other people sins right and the same is true if I'm struggling that can affect other people too we must all get the leaven out of our Lives Hallelujah A little leaven leavens the whole church so we should keep the Feast of Passover what the Death Angel has to pass over by the blood of the Lamb I'm not going to be killed by Satan I'm going to overcome because I've got the blood of the Lamb he can't touch me I'm covered by the blood amen I'm covered covered covered by the blood Hallelujah walking by faith living in love hallelujah amen see don't keep the feast with old leaven neither with a leaven of malice and wickedness so now he gets into this malice and wickedness that was part of the divisions in the church in the first four chapters this is sexual immorality in chapter 5 but see it's a whole it's the leav is is representative of the all the sin in the church not just sexual sin there's malice well I'm a Paul I'm of apos right there's wickedness in the church now wickedness yes is the sexual sin because he names it at the end of the chapter but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth so see we keep the feast and we remember we're not slaves to sin amen I'm not a slave to Egypt amen I'm living in the promise land church amen hallelujah I'm not a slave amen he can't keep me slave because the lamb Set Me Free Hallelujah I've done going through the Red Sea I've been baptized Hallelujah I was there when it happened amen I went through the wildness of sanctification and I crossed over Jordan I was circumcised I've had a permanent relationship with Jesus Christ it I was there when it happened I ought to know praise God hallelujah see we got to get the slaves out of the the church or at least get them to repent so they're stop being a slaved to sin that's why church if you know somebody sin you got to pray you got to go to that person call them text them do something try to talk to them in church do whatever you can do you got to get the sin out of the church and the church said if not we become an old lump not ready to leave not ready for the Rapture not ready for an exodus neither with the leaven of mouse and wickedness but with the unleavened of sincerity and Truth this proves those that are addicted to sin or prideful and won't repent they're insincere and they're Liars they're lying to God like everything's okay they're lying to the people it's okay no that's leaven right insincere not real worship God's not receiving their worship like I said if they have sin God don't want your praise God don't want your songs God don't want your collapse although some people don't even want to give it right when they're living in sin you know what I'm talking about right everybody's gone everybody's gone through that you don't feel like praising God because you're stuck or you're in a struggle we all go through that he said but this approves if you're addicted to sin or won't confess sin insincere and you're lying to others and lying to God like everything's okay when it's not okay but see church thank God you don't have to stay that way thank God there's a blood hallelujah thank God there's Mercy hallelujah thank God that we have a cleansing process amen he he lists it later in chapter six maybe we read that in just a moment remember Church even brother ramam lied to the IRS what was that leaven and he said brother ramam said I already saw that spread to my Joseph and Joseph said daddy do you want me to tell him you're not here the leaven had already spread to his son see when our family sees our sin or our spouse or husband or children it spreads to other people in the family that's we got to confess our sins we have to live sincere tell the truth we have to be sincere we got to get the leaven out of our Lives Hallelujah I told Brother Brian I said that was perfect brother you mentioned the leav you mentioned the division for preachers I said this perfect Abraham lied twice so did Isaac Leven pass down to his family see church sometimes you'll struggle with the same things your parents struggle with right like I I told Malachi this I said why do I why do we Str why do men sometimes struggle with the the lust of the eyes or even pride of life because our dads did and our grandfathers did why would women maybe struggle with a dominating female spirit because their moms did their grandmas did and the church said Hallelujah right you see that you're around that that impacts you and even genetically somehow it's it's in a somehow right so we got to keep sincere and we've got to tell the truth oh it's almost 8:00 my goodness why do I always think I'm not going to preach very long and then I always preach long I always feel like my notes are really shallow or or or small but it always turns out like they're I got enough verse nine I wrote unto you an epistle not to company with fornicator so see that was actually the first letter to the Corinthians but we don't have it it's lost now devil come around and say oh look I found the letter to the First Corinthians and it'll have some false doctrines in it that's the devil right if it goes against anything else Paul said anywhere else or any other man of God so Paul had already told them before don't company with fornicators verse 10 yet not altogether with the fornicators of this world or with the Covetous so sexual fornication or people Covetous for money or fame or popularity or whatever it may be Goods worldly Goods houses lands cars all these things today don't even fellowship with them now there's times you got to be around them or extortioners extortioners are are robbers they rob people of money or with idolators any Idol in their life let they lift up they they they respect this more than they respect God for then must you needs go out of the world so Paul said to avoid all these people you just have to go to heaven that's the only way you can avoid these people totally so you cannot Escape Sinners so Paul adds the next verse verse 11 but don't forget evil company corrupts good manners you find a person addicted to sin or a person that won't repent and pride look who they're hanging around probably somebody else who's got the same problem 1 Corinthians 15:33 says be not deceived evil Communications or associations corrupt good manners if you hang around the right people the pure people you'll stay pure you hang around backsliders or lukewarm people you'll get lukewarm and backslide that's why I tell Malachi lytica you don't hang around with these teenagers unless they're serving God cuz they're going to pull you down that's right they're going to pull you down that's why I don't hang around with people like that and I believe I got the Holy Ghost because I experience every time I go get a haircut even though I got a haircut Saturday I would reach my hand out in the name of Jesus Christ let me keep their pure attitude because it's just a it's a it's a spirit it's an atmosphere and I've got to be careful for 25 minutes to get a haircut not to lose the anointing not to bring reproach upon the love name of Jesus Christ not to get leaven in my in my life because they joke and they they talk all these things always got to bring it back to Jesus and he even even my Barb got me a nice little gift he said to my good brother he said to a good friend but also my brother in Christ I said thank you yes sir by God's grace he's asking me do you tell your kids about Santa Claus no I don't lie to my kids that was the end of that conversation but it's all it's all good it was very respectful very respectful see evil communication corrupt good manners so Paul said you know if you want to get away from it you just have to go to heaven you have to die and go to heaven he' already told you not to accompany with fornicators of people are in sexual sin don't be with them don't spend time with him verse uh Now 1 Corinthians 15:34 awake to righteousness so that proves people hanging around sinful people are spiritually asleep they're they have slumber they don't even see what's going on they're missing the move of the Holy Ghost when you're hanging around the wrong people I'm talking about people that won't repent of their sins people addicted to sin that's what I'm talking about they're asleep they don't even see the spirit of God like when Brian preaches or whoever Simon when something's preaching into our lives if if if if we leave and we we stay with the same condition we were spiritually asleep and missed the whole thing although we could have been saying Amen to every word that's right hallelujah it's 11 awake to righteousness and sin not for some have not the knowledge of God I speak this to your shame he says in other words be very careful who you hang around with better be very careful who starts talking to you about the things of God better be very careful that you know that person can quickly drag you down in the spot you don't want to be right so you got to cut it off or raise them up and say no no no here's what I believe change the subject get things on get conversation on the word of God because remember there's power in your thoughts remember you got an alabaster box Hallelujah that's right Church Hallelujah verse 11 I'm almost done busy body but now I have written unto you not to keep company so now so before I said don't fellowship with fornicators but now do not keep company if a any man that's called a brother be a fornicator or Covetous so any Covetous brother who's Covetous over worldly Goods or brother who's an idolator or sister who's a now here's what I told you in our in my experience as a pastor the most Spirits I've struggled with and battled is critical Spirits that's what reviler is a is a is a reviler reviler means criticize in an angry way that's the spirit I've dealt with the most as a pastor I'm going to keep doing it when people when I when I feel that Spirit I'm going to walk to their chair and I'm going to rebuke that Spirit In Jesus Christ's name now I'm also thankful we don't have you know the lustful Spirits I'm very thankful for that very thankful thank hallelujah thank God you know no sexual sin as far as I know I'm thankful for that but see we all got to battle something praise God we all got to overcome we got to overcome by the blood of the Lamb Hallelujah he says don't eat with a idolor a a crit a Critic a drunker he puts all these people on the same level so someone that looks like they're living holy and they're critical or someone that looks like they're living holy drunk sleeping around a secret or have Idols in their life especially money usually money in America America all about the money don't even eat with that person if they won't repent of that now see if you got to if they see sin though you got to do something about it you have to do it doesn't have to be the pastor all the time it can be you right that's what Jesus said in Matthew 18 is anybody anybody if you see somebody in sin you go to them or an extortioner extortioner again is robber so any unconfessed robbery drunkenness crit critics Idol Idols Covetous fornicators don't even eat with them now thankfully I can say this I've told you this before I said thankfully the people that were in this situation in most cases they separate from us before we have to do anything and I thank God for that I thank God for that one in particular was a man living in fornication and I and I talked to him right outside that door and I said now brother I said if if you need lunch I said we we can't eat with you you got to take it home with you he said oh no we're going home for lunch and then I'd never seen him again or never seen him since but I told him that I said right out side of that door I said well but you know you right by the car on the other side of the car see we can't do that we can't we can't uh let leaven into our midst we got to live holy you know why because God is Holy and he said be holy for I'm holy so I thank God God has kept us away from these people verse 12 for what have I to do to judge them also that are without the church he's like what do I have to do with them I don't have nothing to do with these people outside the church do not ye judge them that are within don't you're supposed to judge the people within the church oh don't judge me brother Jess don't judge me sister that's what we're supposed to do we're supposed to say are we living good lives or not are we living true to Christ or not did we let a little leaven get into our midst and it's every person's responsibility to go to the person right each one of us verse 13 for them that are without the church God will judge them but guess what we find out in chapter six God made us the judges on earth now he said don't you know the Saints will judge angels and how can you judge Angels if you can't judge these matters right in the church I've been thankful over the years like I told you one time I think I counted six times mostly critical spirits but all these times the spirits have attacked me and when I have shared that with others not naming names but when I've shared the details of that almost every person I've shared it with they could judge it the way I did isn't that interesting every the majority of the Christians can all look at a situation and the majority that have pure hearts can all judge the same oh yeah I I would judge that the same way but the person with the evil spirit they think they're right and it's like a the majority of saints if it's a true church will all judge the same situation the right way and the person with Le their life will judge it the wrong way Hallelujah I've had people tell me like brother just really that actually happened to you someone told you that about money or ties or somebody criticize you for yes yes that's my battle apparently overcoming critical Spirits right but what was Corinth sexual sin divisions amongst preachers the rich thinking they're better than the poor drunkenness at the Lord's table all kinds of people suing each other how much money did you want Mercy goodness like this is the this was the leaven in the church and yet Paul says you're saved you're without leaven see he's speaking by spiritual right he's speaking by fore knowledge right all the elect are unleavened Hallelujah now look how look how he ends this now in in the beginning of the chapter he called him a brother who who's sleeping with his stepmother but what do he calm at the end but them that are without God judges therefore put away from among yourselves that Wicked person oh brother Wicked nice to see you today in church sister Wicked thank you so much for coming today uh you got to leave actually Hallelujah this is a sexual sinner sexual sinner Paul says yeah they're a brother but they're live He's look he's judging them by their fruits see we can't sugarcoat well oh you're just such a sweet person if you're living wickedly let's call it Wicked you're in a wicked condition hallelujah what was he bringing he's bringing a rod of Correction this is the harshest judgment we see I I maybe I shouldn't say that it's one of the harshest the harshest might be ananas and Safa where they got one chance to say the truth and when they Li they die that might be the harshest but look how Paul brings a rod of Correction now he's called wicked so he's a wicked brother he's a wicked message believer brother but this is not a final judgment thank God there is a book of second Corinthians but this here is a judgment this is Paul's judgment on the corrupt fruits of a message believer a book of Acts believer so in closing I just want to say this church this chapter gives us such wisdom and understanding and as we heard this weekend if our worship is not giving God our all it's time to get the leaven out if we're if we're standing here in a church sometimes criticizing people why does he wor like that why does she worship like that then we've got the evil spirit on us if we don't want to give God praise if we don't got the joy of the Lord something's wrong with us hallelujah we just heard it this weekend where's my notes I couldn't believe I was like oh my goodness he's preaching on all these things I preach in my murmuring gossiping right right here indignation anger against people leaven cheating cheating god of the worship he desires give a a a false sacrifice when the sacrifice God wants is a crying repentant heart tradition see just going to church and just going through the motions and not getting anything out of church sitting in the sea of the scornful competition Pride people competing and then he said accusers of the Brethren so again the critical spirit critical Spirits again he said disputing arguing competing criticizing backbiting then he ends with worshiping preachers now I know we don't have that here hallelujah because none of you worship the ground I walk on and you never should because it's not Holy Ground I'm there's nothing good about me but we know it happens with the preachers who call themselves the greatest of all time but I'm not preaching on that tonight our inspiration tonight comes from the scripture the Bible said ye are unleavened and we must keep the feast with sincerity and Truth let's stand to our feet here by God's grace musicians can come not too bad a little after 8 o' but how many enjoyed the word of God tonight Hallelujah again it's amazing how God gave brother Brian all those thoughts chapter four chapter 5 very wonderful thought there by God's grace play uh Jesus breaks every Fetter that's what gets people in trouble is they're they get snared in sin they get caught in sin but Jesus can break every Fetter with a repentant heart I love that verse uh it was I was hearing a brother Tim puit preach and that's the one from Psalm 51 he used that verse what a beautiful verse God doesn't want our fake hands raised or whatever fake eyes closed singing good if we have sin in our life God wants us to repent and cry about our sin that's what God God wants Hallelujah Jesus breaks every every F Jesus breaks Hallelujah every better [Music] oh Jesus [Music] [Applause] breaks every every fed for he [Music] SS let's s that again Jesus breaks Jesus breaks every every better Jesus breaks every better oh Jesus breaks [Music] every for he said [Music] now let's have a word of prayer if your heart was convicted by anything here said tonight let's make it right by the grace of God let's first pray for that and then we'll pray if you're living above sin then let's pray is there anyone in the church that we should go to is there any sin that we're missing that we should be mourning over and then go outside then to your family to your co-workers anyone and maybe another message Church someone that you could try to help by the grace of God Church remember we don't do Matthew 18 with people outside of our church Matthew 18 is only done inside the church see we just reach out in love to people that you feel you know might be outside the word in another church that's how you do that outside the church let's pray father God we thank you for tonight Lord thank you for the truth of your word God we're worshiping here tonight we're sincere I'm sincere and we've got the truth of your word each one of us wants to be that kind of worshipper Lord God father if there's any sin in any heart I just pray Lord God that each individual would give the sacrifice of a broken Spirit Lord for a broken and contrite heart thou will not despise Hallelujah that's what David had Lord God he wept there in the the temple of God lord when I've sinned that's what I've done I've wept before you Lord God just you and I or maybe right here at the church in front of people I don't I don't care I want a heart that's pure Lord God I want the Refiner's Fire to clean out my life to refine my faith to purify My Heart Lord God In The Name of Jesus Christ in the spirit of Jesus Christ in the power of the Lord Jesus Christ as Paul said remember heart examine themselves Lord God and know that you break every Fetter and Lord that we should live in a way where we keep the leaven out of our Lives sin that we're aware [Music] of so father first we pray for our church Lord if there's anyone in the church that has that in their life may they repent now or if they're listening later on the archive may they repent Lord of any sin that they're aware of Lord [Music] God for Lord none of us want to be the aan none of us want to be the the secret sinner that hinders the church so father May each individual search their heart and life here tonight dear God or on the archive Grant it Lord [Music] Jesus help us to judge our ourselves first and then we can judge others Lord as Paul said Lord Lord you'll judge those outside the church we're commanded to judge those inside the church oh Lord help help us to think of the leaven of Herod the leav of the Pharisees the leev of the Sadducees oh god oh Jesus have mercy Lord God bring your people to repentance Lord God whoever's in need of it Lord God even on the live stream how many times have we got good testimonies Lord God so we pray for our church
