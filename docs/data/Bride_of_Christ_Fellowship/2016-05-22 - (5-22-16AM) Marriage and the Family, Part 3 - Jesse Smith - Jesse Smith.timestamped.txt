[4:42] everybody I missed everybody last week
[4:44] it's good to be in the house of the Lord
[4:45] uh this morning by God's grace uh for
[4:48] Wednesday night services we've been
[4:49] doing u a series on Galatians and now
[4:51] we're on Ephesians so if you can stream
[4:53] those I'm sure you'll be really blessed
[4:55] I've got a lot of good feedback on those
[4:56] and thank God for that going right
[4:58] through the scripture you know uh our
[5:00] prophet's message is supposed to turn
[5:02] our hearts back to the apostolic fathers
[5:05] right and so when we read those books
[5:07] you know uh those Epistles of Paul Paul
[5:09] was of course the first church age
[5:11] messenger and so when we do that by
[5:13] God's grace we can uh see how our faith
[5:15] ought to look amen and uh I believe it's
[5:18] turning back that way I really do I
[5:19] believe our faith is turning back to the
[5:20] apostolic fathers praise God we like to
[5:23] see it in a greater way but uh it's it's
[5:25] progression it's little by little uh God
[5:27] will do it by his grace and mercy
[5:30] so let's look today at the marriage and
[5:31] the family part three I got a little I
[5:33] got a lot of quotes and a lot of
[5:34] scriptures to show everybody so I hope
[5:37] uh if you like a copy of this just email
[5:39] me or ask me I can email it to you in
[5:41] like 30 seconds and you can have all the
[5:42] quotes in the scriptures uh it's very
[5:46] important to have the right kind of
[5:47] marriage and the right kind of family
[5:49] praise God it's extremely important uh
[5:52] that's what the Holy Ghost is leading
[5:53] all the families to by God's grace the
[5:56] right kind of family to manifest Christ
[5:58] so we read our text this morning uh now
[6:01] I just have a few quick announcements um
[6:03] today of course May 22nd uh the PM
[6:06] service I'm going to preach on Sharp
[6:08] contention uh and the reason I'm
[6:10] preaching on that because we've had two
[6:11] families recently leave the church uh
[6:14] and I'm not going to preach on them okay
[6:16] I'm just going to share with you why
[6:18] they left we just had contention we'll
[6:20] say it like that um I had you know I
[6:22] sent the email out letting us know that
[6:24] one of the families left recently and um
[6:26] I got one reply back asking about it and
[6:29] uh but I imagine it's on other people's
[6:31] minds uh everything is friendly with
[6:34] everyone who's left and everything is
[6:35] kind and their problems have either been
[6:38] with me or brother brandom that's what
[6:39] their problems have been with either me
[6:41] or brother brandom so uh it hasn't been
[6:44] against anybody here hasn't know get
[6:46] anybody here so of course I I not name
[6:48] names or anything like that but I want
[6:49] to bring the scriptural points and the
[6:52] reason I'm calling it sharp contention
[6:53] is because in the Bible in Acts 15 there
[6:55] was sharp contention between Holy Ghost
[6:57] filled Believers uh Paul and Barnabas
[6:59] you remember that and yet later
[7:01] everything was in one Accord they just
[7:03] had a sharp disagreement the Bible calls
[7:05] it a sharp contention so uh brother
[7:08] random said you should be able to
[7:09] bitterly disagree with somebody sir and
[7:11] then at the end hug them yes sir and
[7:13] think just as much of them as Christ
[7:15] does Amen sir Christ thought so much of
[7:17] them he died for them that's right so
[7:20] that's why it's okay to have sharp
[7:22] contentions I just want to let you know
[7:24] uh it's not because of the people it's
[7:26] because of things I've said that people
[7:28] have just dis agreed with and uh and
[7:31] they're they're they're welcome to do
[7:32] that and I want to let you know what
[7:34] they disagree with because if you
[7:35] disagree with me
[7:37] too we need to know that okay we'll
[7:40] never see eyeye on everything but I do
[7:41] believe this we will the bride will be
[7:43] one ACC court before the Rapture and
[7:45] that's for of course the leadership of
[7:47] the Holy Ghost and the things that
[7:48] pertain to the Rapture uh and we agreed
[7:51] recently with you know the family that
[7:53] left we agreed that it was just a minor
[7:54] thing um so the uh an individual
[7:57] disagreed on a minor thing and and
[7:59] they're welcome to leave they're welcome
[8:01] to come and go as they please but we
[8:03] want to find where the Holy Ghost has
[8:05] called us to be and we want to be at our
[8:07] post of Duty right there amen that's
[8:09] what brother Brandon taught always be at
[8:10] your posted duty all those things like
[8:12] that so we want everybody to find the
[8:13] leadership of the Holy Ghost and just be
[8:15] right there at the posted duty till
[8:17] Jesus comes amen that's what we want so
[8:19] this evening I'm just gonna uh and I'm
[8:21] gonna try to keep the evening Services
[8:23] shorter because I think that's one
[8:24] reason why I got sick is because I'm
[8:26] just pouring out myself and my body runs
[8:28] down and I can't don't sleep very much
[8:29] and I'm susceptible to get infections so
[8:32] I'm going to try to really shorten
[8:33] service today I really want somebody to
[8:35] time me like give me an hour just give
[8:37] me an hour I'll just be I'll just done
[8:39] because it it it it wears on me
[8:41] physically I have to preach you know
[8:43] three times a week I do Bible clubs I
[8:45] preaching four times a week so I'm
[8:46] preaching at those kids you know and
[8:49] they they enjoy it you know Friday I
[8:52] preach on social medias I I showed the
[8:53] children how to do social media amen and
[8:57] took it back to the Bible the Bible
[8:59] every word should be used for Godly use
[9:01] and
[9:02] edify not for complaining not for lust
[9:06] not for
[9:07] anger so the Bible said whatever you do
[9:09] in word or deed do it all in the name of
[9:11] the Lord Jesus Christ so if you can post
[9:13] something if you can tweet something uh
[9:16] if you can Instagram something in the
[9:17] name of Jesus Christ we'll go ahead
[9:18] right on to it it's got to be in his
[9:21] name though yes
[9:22] sir so next Sunday um I'm sorry next

[10:53] that Sunday brother Brian Hawkins has
[10:55] agreed to well I'm sorry he's praying
[10:56] about it but normally after he prays he
[10:58] feels that and last time he was here God
[11:00] really moved and healed one of our
[11:01] sisters now since they've left the
[11:03] church but God instantly healed one
[11:05] right there so we know the power of the
[11:07] Lord is present to heal in this place
[11:09] how many that amen amen so that's just
[11:12] upcoming weeks here by God's grace so
[11:14] I'm not gonna be able to preach on
[11:15] family for a while we'd say for about
[11:17] three or four weeks so I want to make
[11:18] sure I really dial in this morning and
[11:21] try to preach on that amen okay so
[11:23] everybody love the Lord this morning
[11:25] okay praise the Lord you have any as
[11:27] I've always said if you have any ever
[11:28] have any questions for me any correction
[11:29] for me just contact me I'm happy to take
[11:32] it I'm happy I love questions I like
[11:34] talking on the phone with you I like
[11:36] emailing back and forth I like that
[11:38] whatever is best for you we just want to
[11:39] be United in Christ
[11:41] Jesus okay so the purpose of these uh
[11:44] family sermons is to manifest the love
[11:46] of Jesus Christ in our marriages
[11:49] families and homes uh if we plan to go
[11:52] to the marriage in the sky that I
[11:55] believe our marriages here on Earth
[11:56] should resemble the Heavenly Union
[11:58] between Christ and his bride as I've
[12:00] said it before how are we going to get
[12:02] to that marriage if our marriages here
[12:03] AR aren't in the right order praise the
[12:05] Lord how's it gonna How's that gonna
[12:07] happen Okay well we got to manifest
[12:10] Christ here and then that of course
[12:11] shows us that we are going to that
[12:14] marriage in the sky uh amen because then
[12:17] we're living the life of Christ now just
[12:18] a quick review and as I said brother
[12:20] brandom I have quotes for all this that
[12:22] brother brandom said I quotes for every
[12:23] one of these uh here by God's grace and
[12:26] I found it interesting yesterday I was
[12:28] going through my old notes that I
[12:29] printed off on marriage and family and
[12:31] conduct and things like that and I found
[12:32] an old p uh pamphlet by Harold Becka
[12:35] every everyone know Harold Becket okay
[12:38] well he put out this H quote book on
[12:40] marriage and I just loved it first time
[12:42] I read it I thought glory to God and uh
[12:45] and I was reading the book and pretty
[12:46] soon I find that he had five needs for
[12:49] women and five needs for
[12:51] men and I found out that he must have
[12:53] read that book that I bought every
[12:55] couple of the church but his needs her
[12:57] needs so uh that was encouraging that
[12:59] another message Minister who has a
[13:01] worldwide influence over people uh you
[13:03] know a different uh men of God and
[13:06] different things like that read that
[13:07] book years ago and then found all these
[13:09] quotes and then that's the same thing
[13:10] I've done so I felt led of the Lord to
[13:12] do that and I believe it's a good thing
[13:14] but all these things that man wrote
[13:16] about in his book that brother Becket
[13:17] and that I've read I'm sure other
[13:19] brothers brother Brandon said all of
[13:21] them and that's the beauty of it and I
[13:23] believe it'll help you this morning by
[13:24] God's grace so let's review part one a
[13:26] little bit uh the pastor's marriage
[13:28] impacts the church Grace keeps every
[13:32] family together even God's family
[13:34] couples must be so in love after the
[13:36] wedding when the toils and trials of
[13:37] Life come in brother bam said so here's
[13:39] what brother B said he said he gathers
[13:41] his wife and kids around the radio every
[13:42] Saturday morning to listen to brother
[13:44] Neville and then he says this he said I
[13:46] love brother Neville look at the
[13:47] underlined words there this first he's a
[13:49] theologian first thing he's a child of
[13:51] God the next thing he's the same every
[13:52] day I known him for years he's never
[13:54] changed one bit he's still Orman Neville
[13:55] a serving the lord Jesus now I go down
[13:57] to the yellow here when you see a
[13:59] minister and his wife getting along like
[14:02] that speaking of brother Neville and his
[14:03] wife in sweetness and humbleness that
[14:06] just makes the church go that much
[14:09] better so brother Bram says the home
[14:11] life the way the husband and wife love
[14:13] each other and get along and sweetly
[14:15] live will directly impact the local
[14:17] church so that struck me as soon as I
[14:20] saw brother Ram said that M uh and
[14:22] remember brother brandham said in
[14:23] December of 1963 he said the brandham
[14:26] Tabernacle was the most spiritual place
[14:28] he'd ever been to wow on the earth
[14:30] praise the Lord he said we don't have
[14:32] the most speaking in tongues we don't
[14:33] have the most Miracle amen and he gave
[14:36] brother Neville the credit for that amen
[14:38] amen listen to it December 29th you're
[14:40] gonna listen to it uh so it's extremely
[14:43] important how we love at home how we
[14:45] manifest Christ at home that will
[14:47] directly impact the church because we
[14:50] cannot play church just in the church
[14:52] and be nice to everybody here we got to
[14:53] have the real life of Christ at home
[14:55] amen then manifest that love here in
[14:58] Church brother Braham said Grace keeps
[15:00] family together I'm just going to read
[15:01] the underline part he said then it takes
[15:04] Grace to keep that family together oh
[15:05] God it taking the grace of Jehovah to
[15:07] keep his family together and that's the
[15:10] only way we're in Jehovah's family today
[15:11] is because of the grace of Jesus Christ
[15:13] we'd all be gone but it's Grace oh Grace
[15:16] Amen brother Ram said shame on men who
[15:19] lose their affections for their wives he
[15:21] said never let that honeymoon cease for
[15:23] it isn't going to cease in heaven amen
[15:26] love should create a hunger to be
[15:27] together as brother said I'm counting
[15:29] down the days when I can get there to be
[15:30] with his wife M here's that quote where
[15:33] he says and couples got to be so in love
[15:35] When Trials come he said now right
[15:37] before you're married everything's just
[15:38] fine and dandy but after you get married
[15:40] then the toils and the trials of Life
[15:42] come in that's when you've got to be so
[15:44] in
[15:45] love that you understand one another
[15:48] when you're disappointed in her she's
[15:49] disappointed in you you still understand
[15:51] one another that's the way it is with
[15:54] Christ see we've got to be so in love
[15:56] with him so when we ask for something he
[15:59] doesn't give it to us that doesn't shake
[16:01] us a
[16:02] bit all right so you got to be so much
[16:05] in love after your married not just uh
[16:08] in love before you're married you got to
[16:10] be in love after you're married too
[16:11] because that's when the trials will come
[16:12] and love keeps everybody together amen
[16:15] Amen brother now the Bible said the man
[16:17] must be brave and strong so this is kind
[16:19] of part two where I preached a few
[16:20] Sunday nights ago the Bible said quit
[16:23] you like men and be brave and be strong
[16:26] so men today don't fear Le O deia I'm
[16:28] not scared of Le oia praise the Lord I'm
[16:31] not scared of Hollywood I'm not scared
[16:34] of anyone that leaves a message I'm not
[16:36] scared of pornography I'm not scared of
[16:38] anything because I've got a greater one
[16:40] in me than he that's in the world yes
[16:42] amen I have nothing to fear I'm brave
[16:44] I'm strong I'm a Christian I've got the
[16:46] greatest force in all the universe
[16:48] living in me it's called Divine love
[16:51] amen glory yeah I've got the full armor
[16:54] of God on so what should I fear I'm a
[16:56] soldier of the Cross I'm a servant yeah
[16:59] praise the Lord I've got the sword the
[17:00] word in my hand what uh evil can come
[17:03] before me everything will fall our feet
[17:06] if we just speak the word of God and say
[17:08] the name of Jesus amen amen glory we saw
[17:13] the man must labor for Spiritual meat
[17:15] more than natural meat Jesus himself
[17:17] said that don't work so hard Brothers to
[17:19] provide you know the fanciest home or
[17:21] the the most expensive food or the
[17:23] nicest clothes don't labor for that he
[17:25] said labor for the spiritual meat amen
[17:29] work hard to get your family to hear the
[17:31] word of God Amen that's what Jesus
[17:33] Christ said so you're doing the right
[17:35] thing by bringing your family to church
[17:36] amen you Brothers God bless you and we
[17:39] saw a virtuous woman is a crown to her
[17:41] husband she's the he she's the glory of
[17:45] him when she lives a virtuous and that
[17:47] means a powerful Army life she's like a
[17:50] AR she's like a uh she's leading like an
[17:52] army of children in the home amen and
[17:55] she's a she's an army the Bible said
[17:56] that Song of Solomon as well keeps
[17:58] everything in
[18:00] order now the man must honor his wife
[18:02] and understand her that's what the Bible
[18:04] said he's got to do it a man has to have
[18:07] the Holy Ghost enough to honor his wife
[18:09] and then understand her amen he's got to
[18:12] understand well a woman's not built like
[18:14] a man a woman's built differently I've
[18:15] got to love her and the spirit's got to
[18:17] help me to love her that's right brother
[18:20] Braham said men should never lose their
[18:21] affections he said the wife really needs
[18:23] your attention brothers so Brothers we
[18:25] got to make time to give our wies some
[18:26] attention that's what brother R said I'm
[18:29] just quing what brother Ram said the man
[18:31] should be Burly but have the fruit of
[18:32] gentleness by the spirit so we got to be
[18:34] Burly Brothers but there's also time to
[18:36] manifest gentleness as well by The Same
[18:39] Spirit we just because if we're Burly
[18:41] with our wise all the time Burly prod
[18:43] produces Burly well the man said temper
[18:45] breeds temper love breeds love though
[18:47] amen so if we treat our wives rough and
[18:50] wonder why our wives are so rough that's
[18:51] our fault that's right but if we love
[18:54] our wives and are gentle to our wives
[18:55] then we should expect our wives to be
[18:57] gentle
[18:59] yes amen because it's an atmosphere we
[19:02] create the home as men amen we've got to
[19:05] create the right atmosphere but you're a
[19:08] Creator husbands must love their wives
[19:11] and not themselves other women the world
[19:15] or anything else Holy Spirit just said
[19:17] love your wives husbands that's what we
[19:20] got to love of course we love if we love
[19:22] Jesus will do that because Jesus is
[19:23] greater than everybody but he's our
[19:25] first love and then the husbands love
[19:27] your wives now the man must keep the
[19:29] value made to God and family and friends
[19:32] that he would love his wife all all of
[19:34] us when we got married we stood before
[19:35] everybody everybody smiling taking
[19:37] pictures there's flowers and it's all
[19:38] beautiful but brother sometimes we
[19:41] forget that we made a promise to love
[19:42] our
[19:43] wives praise the Lord sometimes we
[19:45] forget and we got to keep our promise
[19:47] brother Bram said No Man's no better
[19:49] than his word you promis to love your
[19:52] wife you promised to love your children
[19:53] you promis to love God now be a man and
[19:55] keep your word amen men must be Fighters
[19:59] for love and Holiness brother Bram said
[20:01] be a hero do you know he said that he
[20:02] said be a hero we need some heroes in
[20:05] here right that going to save and rescue
[20:07] some Souls is that right always be that
[20:10] Gallant
[20:11] boyfriend so brother said yeah that's
[20:14] what he
[20:16] said men so men Gotta Fight For Love and
[20:19] Holiness in their homes they gotta fight
[20:20] for that because they're fighting out L
[20:22] to see they're fighting out Temptations
[20:24] they got to fight for honor and the
[20:26] Bible honors men who fight for love
[20:28] remember Proverbs 5 said the man must
[20:31] always be ravished uh with the love of
[20:33] his wife that means intoxicated he must
[20:35] always look at his wife and feel in love
[20:37] with her that's what the Bible says in
[20:40] proverbs 30 remember the the Holy Spirit
[20:43] wrote to the writer you know there's
[20:44] three or four things I can't explain
[20:46] that are too wonderful me wonderful for
[20:48] me one of them the holy spirit said was
[20:50] a man who's trying to chase a maid a man
[20:53] who's trying to uh win her heart he said
[20:57] that's too wonderful for for me and see
[20:59] that why is God why does God like love
[21:01] and romance because that's what Christ
[21:03] is doing right now to us he's trying to
[21:05] make love to us amen he's trying to woo
[21:07] our hearts he's trying to uh show us his
[21:09] love and we got to receive his love amen
[21:13] glory right brother brandom said the
[21:15] books you read mold your character so
[21:18] everyone reads on their phone so there's
[21:19] no excuse to not be able to read good
[21:21] books amen there's no better leader for
[21:24] a woman and children than a
[21:25] Spirit-filled and spirit-led man man
[21:28] said there's no better duck to lead the
[21:29] Ducks than that one duck that rallies
[21:31] them all together same way with a man
[21:33] same way with a pastor same way with a
[21:35] man in the house there's no better
[21:36] leader than than you Brothers when
[21:38] you're anointed and walking in the
[21:40] spirit amen amen then we showed how
[21:43] Joseph twice immediately obeyed the
[21:46] voice of God in regards to marrying
[21:47] Jesus so his wife and his unborn it
[21:50] wasn't his it was God's unborn son yeah
[21:53] it wasn't his but anyways he was taking
[21:55] care of the child that would be a part
[21:56] of his natural family Ezra and the men
[21:59] fasted we read this we read this a few
[22:01] weeks ago Ezra and the men fasted for
[22:03] the future of their wives and children
[22:05] that's what we should do if we don't
[22:06] know which direction to go which which
[22:08] decision to make let's fast and pray I
[22:10] told you brothers that night I said if
[22:12] you want to come fast and pray on
[22:13] Saturday I'm right here with you I'll be
[22:14] here you just tell me I'll come and fast
[22:16] and pray amen we'll pray as long as we
[22:19] can pray then we'll read the Bible we'll
[22:20] sing or we'll study the word and then
[22:22] we'll go back to praying we've done it
[22:24] before John bang and I have shut in a
[22:26] few years ago we shut remember that we
[22:27] shut for a weekend at the church uh yeah
[22:31] brother Ram said everyone is looking now
[22:33] this is real important everyone's
[22:35] looking for somebody to love them
[22:37] brother said I want somebody to love
[22:40] me and you search everywhere he said to
[22:42] find someone who will love you so you
[22:45] see everybody wants to be loved what
[22:47] causes separation in families though is
[22:49] the neglect of love someone fails to
[22:51] love and that causes separation
[22:54] sometimes physically and so sometimes
[22:55] spiritually and brother M said family
[22:58] has to love one another
[23:00] yeah here's where he says everybody
[23:02] needs love and looks for love here you
[23:04] hymn 57 the world's looking for
[23:07] something today when your little wife
[23:08] told you she'd be your sweetheart and
[23:10] wife she was looking for somebody to
[23:12] love her not just love her till you got
[23:13] married but love her after she got
[23:15] married am
[23:16] Glory that's what she's looking for and
[23:19] when you promised your husband he was
[23:21] looking he was looking brothers were
[23:23] looking for somebody to love them when
[23:25] he come in tired and weary from working
[23:27] all day some little wife to put her arms
[23:29] around him and kindly brush his hair
[23:30] back and tell how much she loved him
[23:32] that's what caused a separation in fam
[23:34] say the neglect of love people fail to
[23:37] love that's what causes separation in
[23:39] churches neglect of Love we've got to
[23:41] have love amen got to have it at home
[23:44] gotta have it here at the church all
[23:46] right now that was uh about 10 minutes
[23:48] review so let's get now to today now
[23:51] brother brandom says here and I'm basing
[23:53] this all off the Bible and of course
[23:54] brother bram's quotes uh we must have
[23:57] exclusive love when you get married you
[23:59] love somebody exclusively all your love
[24:01] goes to that person say this calling
[24:04] Jesus on the scene you know man if
[24:06] you're the right kind of husband there's
[24:09] no woman in the world that you love like
[24:12] your wife yeah right there might be
[24:16] other women more fair there might be
[24:18] women that would prettier so forth but
[24:20] something if you really love your wife
[24:22] there's something in there that you
[24:23] don't notice what she looks like you
[24:25] love her you don't know why but you love
[24:27] her and you women the same for your
[24:29] husband
[24:30] women you love and you young girls are
[24:33] your boyfriends boyfriend to girlfriend
[24:35] if you met that person that you know you
[24:36] love there's something in there you know
[24:39] you love them yeah resuming 62 and if
[24:43] you don't truly love your wife better
[24:45] than any woman in the world she's not
[24:48] yet there is something
[24:50] wrong if we don't love our wives better
[24:53] than other sisters something's wrong
[24:55] with us husbands I need to love my wife
[24:57] I better than I treat all the sisters in
[24:59] here amen and the church
[25:02] said if I don't something's wrong how
[25:05] can I love God's spiritual bride but not
[25:07] my natural bride that Christ gave me how
[25:10] that's that's that's a contradiction
[25:12] that's wrong that's hypocrisy I'm to
[25:15] love my wife more than any other woman
[25:18] in the world amen
[25:21] glory that's what brother Ram says
[25:24] right if you now here sisters if you
[25:26] don't love your husband if you trifle on
[25:29] him I don't know what trifle means I
[25:31] look that one up so somebody look that
[25:33] up if you you trifle on him and don't
[25:35] live the right kind of Life there is
[25:38] something
[25:39] wrong all right let's go on here uh
[25:42] Hebrews chapter 6 part two now you say
[25:46] well brother Brandon then if I become a
[25:47] Christian I can just do anything I want
[25:49] to absolutely if you're a Christian do
[25:52] anything you want to and I'll guarantee
[25:54] you won't have any desire to do wrong
[25:57] yeah yes you do anything I always did
[26:01] just what I wanted
[26:03] to Glory I've always done what my soul
[26:06] wants to do sometimes I do what my flesh
[26:09] does but I try to not do what my flesh
[26:10] wants to do praise God that's what we
[26:13] must differentiate what does our soul
[26:15] want to do and what does our flesh want
[26:17] to do we must cast down throw it down
[26:19] what the flesh wants to do and always do
[26:21] what the Soul's telling us to
[26:24] do now look what he says about his wife
[26:26] I wouldn't hurt her for nothing because
[26:28] he loves her brothers we should not
[26:30] enjoy hurting our wives that's right we
[26:32] should not enjoy making our our wives
[26:34] Cry Praise the Lord Amen brother Ram
[26:37] never enjoyed hurting sister ma because
[26:40] he says it right there he wouldn't hurt
[26:42] her for anything he doesn't want to hurt
[26:43] that wonderful we say flower or crown
[26:46] that God gave her he wants to treat her
[26:48] the right way amen faith in God 52 but
[26:52] you know I found the one lady that I
[26:55] really love and I asked her if she
[26:57] thought that much
[26:58] me and she said yes so we got
[27:00] married and I told her now look honey
[27:03] all my love I give to you no matter what
[27:07] other women say now he talks about what
[27:08] if an attractive lady came on the street
[27:10] and said Oh Billy I really love you with
[27:12] all my heart look what he would say to a
[27:13] woman that did that he said well here's
[27:15] the first place if she has a love for me
[27:18] it's bound to be false so if you're
[27:20] already married and a woman comes up and
[27:22] said oh Jesse you're a pretty handsome
[27:24] guy or you're you're you're you're
[27:26] something like that I love you he said
[27:28] it's already false because my first duty
[27:31] is what I pledge to my wife that's hers
[27:34] first I got to think of her first she's
[27:36] my first I told her I'd give her all my
[27:38] love and then my first duties is to her
[27:41] I'd say now look sister you're just
[27:43] infatuated or something
[27:46] lustful he's already married he's
[27:48] already made a vow he already promised
[27:50] God I'm giving all my all my love to my
[27:52] wife if another woman comes around and
[27:53] say well I love you you're so well this
[27:55] and that he said you're just infatuate
[27:57] uated with the spirit of
[27:59] lust
[28:03] amen pardon me he said now look you're
[28:06] just evadu because you're not in love
[28:08] and I'm not in love with you because I
[28:09] love one woman and that's the mother of
[28:12] my children that's my first
[28:14] Duty Oh Glory what what does brother R
[28:17] say as the secret to your success he
[28:20] said love yeah love is a secret to your
[28:24] success as a Christian how many knew
[28:25] that you know that amen not how much you
[28:29] can read or pray although love will make
[28:30] you do that not how much you can attend
[28:33] church but love will make you attend
[28:34] church right but the secret is living by
[28:39] love because the Bible says this 1 Peter
[28:42] 1:22 seeing you have purified your souls
[28:44] in obeying the truth through the spirit
[28:46] unto what unan that means unmasked love
[28:50] no hypocrisy it's not a pretend love
[28:52] it's a genuine pure love that's how you
[28:56] purify your soul just love someone
[28:59] purely from the
[29:01] heart see that you love one another with
[29:03] a pure heart fervently now brother R
[29:06] tells this
[29:07] story of Paul Raider how we know the
[29:10] story of Paul Raider when he kisses his
[29:11] wife okay one morning I'm not going to
[29:14] read all this but uh he didn't apologize
[29:17] to his wife and then they they always
[29:19] Kissed before he went out to work or
[29:21] went out to preach or whatever it was
[29:23] and uh so he left
[29:26] so
[29:28] now he goes down the street let's skip
[29:29] ahead of this so he kissed her you know
[29:30] he never apologized he he mistreated his
[29:33] wife and just kissed her and walked away
[29:35] and then he said he went down the street
[29:37] and I began to think about M how can I
[29:39] stand it what if something happened to
[29:40] me today that's my sweetheart I look I
[29:43] said something I ought to
[29:46] say so Paul Raider was a preacher uh
[29:49] made a mistake didn't apologize to his
[29:51] wife he goes walking down the street and
[29:53] look the spirit convicts him to go make
[29:55] that
[29:56] right so he does so he said in his heart
[30:00] he got to swelling big and looked around
[30:02] and run back in real quick jerked the
[30:04] door open and heard somebody cry and she
[30:06] was standing behind the door crying he
[30:08] made his wife
[30:10] cry he said he looked around and grabbed
[30:12] her by the shoulder pulled around kissed
[30:14] her as big as he could like that walked
[30:16] out the door and said goodbye and she
[30:18] said goodbye he said just like she did
[30:21] the other time but the last time had a
[30:23] feeling in it so the first kiss was just
[30:25] like just going through the motions he
[30:27] upet he went back and made sure he
[30:29] kissed her with some feeling in it and
[30:31] brother said that's the way it is about
[30:33] knowing
[30:34] Christ you can know him but there is a
[30:37] feeling a real love feeling a real
[30:39] Fellowship that's the way that's the
[30:42] secret to the
[30:43] success that's the way is a real genuine
[30:46] love that's not a put on that's why when
[30:49] I come to church I want to worship from
[30:51] from my heart yes I don't want to try to
[30:54] well brother and is trying real hard
[30:55] I'll try to impress him by maybe jumping
[30:57] a little a little more or running or
[30:58] spinning around or something like that
[31:00] or maybe I'll try to really Pump It Up
[31:01] and things like that I just want to love
[31:03] from the purity of my heart amen I'm G
[31:06] to close my eyes and think about Calvary
[31:08] the resurrection how he saved me what I
[31:10] used to be what I am now and sing based
[31:12] upon genuine love not a put on because
[31:17] that's not the pretending is not the
[31:19] secret to success loving and honesty and
[31:22] Purity and Holiness that's the secret to
[31:24] success amen glory it's real and God
[31:28] knows it's real so does Satan know it's
[31:31] real when you love the Lord with a
[31:33] genuine
[31:34] love yes amen said only the Holy Ghost
[31:38] can outdo
[31:39] Satan you see Satan's gonna attack our
[31:41] marriages and our families uh and the
[31:43] only thing that can out do Satan is the
[31:46] Holy Ghost here he says it sin is
[31:48] attractive any way you take it sin is
[31:50] attractive to the human being Satan
[31:52] knows how to make it attractive he's a
[31:53] genius at a job at his job he's a genius
[31:57] at tempting people M he'll get a real
[31:59] person who's real solid on the word and
[32:01] get them to start questioning the word
[32:03] get them to start questioning what's in
[32:05] their home questioning if they can do
[32:06] this questioning if they can do that
[32:08] because he's a genius at his
[32:11] job the Bible said he accuses the saints
[32:13] of God Day and Night Before the Throne
[32:16] he's an
[32:17] accuser like what brother says in the
[32:19] first seal he said no remember it wasn't
[32:21] Rush the Antichrist is smooth fell just
[32:23] watch how smooth he is it just takes the
[32:25] Holy Spirit the only thing that can
[32:27] outdo
[32:28] him so the only thing that can outdo
[32:30] this this Spirit of Satan in our homes
[32:33] or in our church is the Holy Ghost and
[32:35] he is love because God is love amen amen
[32:39] did you know brother man said Satan
[32:40] works the hardest on women did you know
[32:41] that how many knew that by God's grace
[32:44] so Brothers we need to really pray for
[32:45] our
[32:46] wives Brothers we need to pray for the
[32:48] Sisters in the church Satan Works harder
[32:50] on the women this is perseverance 1962
[32:54] he's talking to a brother he said I
[32:55] guess your sweetheart came too I I know
[32:57] you feel that way about her she's still
[32:58] your sweetheart that's the way I know
[33:00] listen all of us Christians feel that
[33:03] way about our wives got any Christians
[33:05] in here that are married men sir yeah
[33:07] you should feel that way about your wife
[33:10] she's your
[33:12] sweetheart oh yes amen I'm gonna go down
[33:15] to the underline part and see that
[33:17] Satan's tool where he works the hardest
[33:20] that was his first instrument what Eve
[33:22] was yeah so he takes it back to Genesis
[33:24] what was Satan's first uh temptation was
[33:27] to the woman yeah so that's where he
[33:29] works the hardest brother Brandon says
[33:32] he's never changed he stays right there
[33:34] we just have to pray for our sisters
[33:36] constantly Brothers when was the last
[33:37] time we prayed for our wives amen he
[33:41] said pray for your wives
[33:45] constantly yes amen sounds like it's
[33:48] really hitting home out there I could
[33:49] hear a pin drop almost out
[33:51] there we brother said we need our
[33:54] spouses just a
[33:55] moment
[33:59] we need our spouses brother says in
[34:01] perseverance he was talking to a brother
[34:04] here I'm going to skip past
[34:05] that okay I'm sorry this is the same no
[34:08] this is a different quote 62 I know you
[34:11] said I guess your sweetheart came to I
[34:13] know you feel that way she's still your
[34:14] sweetheart I know we all of us as
[34:15] Christians feel that way about our wives
[34:17] they're still our sweethearts I hope it
[34:18] never changes in my family it never
[34:20] Chang in your family that we can always
[34:22] feel that way about our wives after all
[34:24] they stand side by side with us help us
[34:27] fight these battles and we need them
[34:30] yeah praise God although I've said many
[34:33] scorching things to them but it wasn't
[34:35] in such a way to make them feel bad it
[34:37] was in such a way to keep them in line
[34:39] with the
[34:40] gospel amen hallelujah I have a coote
[34:44] brother said I don't even know where I'd
[34:45] be without sister
[34:46] ma now think about that he he couldn't
[34:49] even imagine where would I be without my
[34:51] wife and most of the time she just sat
[34:53] at home and raised the kids most of the
[34:54] time right yeah I can imagine where
[34:57] would I be without my wife Brothers we
[34:59] should probably say the same thing where
[35:00] would be we we be without my without
[35:02] without our wives I'll say it like that
[35:04] I don't even want to imagine where I
[35:05] would be I know where I would be and I
[35:07] don't want to talk about it it ain't
[35:09] good because I'm very thankful God gave
[35:11] me a wonderful wife and saved my soul
[35:13] praise the Lord amen hallelujah so I
[35:16] know what I used to be I know what I am
[35:17] now by the grace of the
[35:18] Lord Brother manam said marriage is of
[35:21] God and God is watching how we treat one
[35:23] another man said married life is of God
[35:26] the B said that married life is of God
[35:29] the bed's
[35:31] undefiled Genesis 21:18 of course
[35:33] marriage was God's idea God did this in
[35:35] Genesis 2:18 God said it's not good that
[35:38] man should be alone I'll make him a
[35:39] helpmate for him so this whole
[35:41] institution was of God it's God's idea
[35:44] now we read this last week Malachi
[35:47] 2:14 yet ye say wherefore because the
[35:50] Lord has been witness between thee and
[35:51] the wife of thy youth against whom thou
[35:54] has dealt treacherously yet she is thy
[35:56] comp companion and the wife of thy
[35:58] Covenant so God had noticed that Israel
[36:01] men had started dealing treacherously
[36:02] against their wives and they thought
[36:04] they could get away with it so God sent
[36:06] a Prophet by the name of Malachi to B to
[36:08] ball out those men sound familiar God
[36:11] send brother Ram to ball out men God
[36:13] says brother R to ball out women if
[36:15] there's any mistreating going on God
[36:17] will send the prophet to straighten the
[36:19] people out amen glory he said I've been
[36:22] watching you and your house how you're
[36:24] treating each other I've been watching
[36:26] how you deal with each other how you
[36:28] treat each other God sent a prophet to
[36:30] let him know I'm watching how your home
[36:31] life
[36:32] is and did he not make one yet he had
[36:35] the resue of the spirit and wherefore
[36:37] one that he might seek a Godly seed
[36:39] therefore take heed to your spirit and
[36:42] let none deal treacherously against the
[36:43] wife of of his youth how do you take
[36:45] heed to your spirit while you start
[36:47] meditating upon what are you thinking
[36:49] what are you saying that's how you take
[36:50] heed to your spirit you start examining
[36:52] are my words and my actions and my
[36:54] thoughts about my wife or my husband are
[36:57] these lining up with the word of God if
[36:58] not then I need to take heed to my
[37:00] spirit and I need to
[37:02] repent that's exactly right take heed
[37:05] look at your spirit look what's your
[37:06] thinking what's your thought process and
[37:09] that's why I said I'll be happy to sit
[37:10] down with any married couple and uh just
[37:12] sweetly work these things out I've seen
[37:13] it happen before it's happened many
[37:15] times it could happen again by God's
[37:17] grace but you have to be able to humble
[37:19] yourself and take heed to your spirit
[37:20] and honestly look at yourself am I
[37:22] living a Christian Life or am I dealing
[37:25] right with my spouse or am I not and
[37:28] then just be humble enough to repent and
[37:29] move on God will give you the victory
[37:32] amen glory Song of Solomon 412 a garden
[37:36] enclosed is my sister my spouse a spring
[37:39] shut up a fountain sealed so what
[37:41] happens if you neglect your garden oh my
[37:43] the weeds take over they take over you
[37:46] just watch it if you haven't seen it yet
[37:49] go back out in your Landscaping today
[37:51] may take a little stroll and hold your
[37:53] wife or husband's hand and take a little
[37:54] stroll if you don't keep up your Garden
[37:57] uh it becomes a wasteland yeah it
[38:00] becomes a wasteland right you got to and
[38:02] so it is with your wife my wife is a
[38:04] garden Solomon said I've got to keep up
[38:06] with her needs I've gotta make sure she
[38:08] has what she needs I'm gonna try to
[38:10] close later on with this where brother B
[38:12] said Joseph was a shield to
[38:14] Mary so the man has to be able to stand
[38:17] there and protect he's got to be a
[38:18] shield and protect his little wife
[38:20] behind him brother brand said that yeah
[38:24] amen yes sir and so she's a garden you
[38:27] got to attend to your garden you got to
[38:29] pay attention to your garden and make
[38:31] sure it's it's bringing forth fruit
[38:33] praise the Lord I like this wives can be
[38:36] a tremendous blessing to help to their
[38:38] husbands because the Bible said she will
[38:40] do him good and not evil all the days of
[38:41] her
[38:42] life amen sisters are we trying to do
[38:45] that by God's grace amen glory look at
[38:48] this brothers look at this this is real
[38:49] encouraging who so find a wife findeth a
[38:51] good thing and obtains favor of the Lord
[38:54] God already favors me more because I'm
[38:57] married not only do I have Grace and
[38:59] forgiveness and eternal life but I also
[39:02] have favor because I took a wife and I'm
[39:05] married why because I'm typing Christ in
[39:08] the church amen that's right Proverbs
[39:11] 19:14 house and riches are the
[39:14] inheritance of fathers and a Prudent
[39:16] Wife is from the Lord amen so that means
[39:20] God sent my wife she comes from his
[39:23] thinking down to me amen yes just like
[39:26] on Wednesday night when we showed how
[39:28] you were chosen in Christ before the
[39:31] foundation of the world where did you
[39:32] come from the mind of Christ amen where
[39:35] did your prent right from come from she
[39:37] came from the the mind of Christ amen
[39:40] and she's from the Lord if you got a
[39:42] prent wife amen thank God for that
[39:48] glory amen Jehovah Gyra 3 and a
[39:51] righteous one is the best thing you get
[39:53] a hold of outside of
[39:55] salvation
[39:57] yeah amen that's right ain't the newest
[40:00] car ain't the newest job it ain't it
[40:02] ain't like that the best thing he can
[40:04] get a hold of outside of Salvation is a
[40:06] good wife
[40:08] yeah if God could have give a man a
[40:10] better thing than a wife he would have
[40:11] give it to him because God just gives
[40:13] his children the good
[40:16] things oh I'm so full of joy this
[40:18] morning amen so I know I got favor I
[40:21] know I got a good thing I know I got
[40:23] what God has for me praise the Lord amen
[40:27] that's part of the message that's part
[40:28] of the word that's part of the the
[40:30] message of the hour this is our hearts
[40:32] being restored back to the Pentecostal
[40:34] fathers amen that's right it's part of
[40:36] it because it's part of the
[40:38] word notice there's nothing that God
[40:41] could give a man outside of Salvation
[40:42] better than a nice wife there's no
[40:45] person I'm gonna get to this later can
[40:47] console a person when they're
[40:49] tired they won't confide in anyone like
[40:52] they do their own
[40:53] wife so Brothers when they're tired the
[40:56] person that helps them feel better is
[40:58] their wife and I can say Amen to that
[40:59] when I've been tired and worn out and
[41:01] stressed and even sick who's the one
[41:03] that helps me and console me my
[41:05] wife better than all my brothers that
[41:07] send me text I appreciate texts and I
[41:08] appreciate prayers but the one that
[41:10] consoles me and I conf find and the one
[41:12] I share and confide my secrets in and my
[41:15] prayers and all these things the one
[41:16] that I share my deepest feelings and
[41:18] things is my
[41:20] wife that's what brother random said
[41:23] what a fortunate thing you brothers are
[41:25] when you've got a nice little wife
[41:26] that's clean and upright and moral and
[41:28] you can come in when you're tired and
[41:29] weary sit down and she can talk to you
[41:31] she can do more with you than anybody
[41:35] else amen so there's no better nurse for
[41:38] the husbands than their wives amen
[41:41] that's right she can do more for you
[41:43] brother Ram said than anybody else is
[41:46] your wife right flashing red light oh he
[41:49] keeps going same quote but remember
[41:51] woman is made for man not man for woman
[41:53] the last created being God ever created
[41:54] was a man a woman's a by product from a
[41:56] man and she was made for a man not man
[41:58] made for a woman they have vice versa it
[42:01] around and man falls at The Shrine of
[42:03] woman today oh my we won't do that
[42:06] though we won't worship women amen we'll
[42:08] worship Jesus Christ praise the Lord but
[42:10] the man in his place and the woman right
[42:12] under him by God's grace because man is
[42:14] to rule the head of the woman Christ is
[42:16] the head of the uh man and then God is
[42:18] the head of Christ because the eternal
[42:19] spirit is the head of the body amen okay
[42:22] Mark of the Beast they say behind every
[42:25] good man there's a good wife that's very
[42:28] fine if there's any credit go to the
[42:30] Brandon family give it to her because
[42:32] she's 10 years younger than I am now and
[42:34] snow whitee headed and she just stood
[42:36] between me and the public and I don't
[42:38] know what I would do without her what a
[42:41] compliment yeah a prophet of God like
[42:44] Elijah with the same Spirit of Elijah I
[42:47] don't know what I would do without my
[42:50] wife my goodness
[42:53] amen God certainly give me a wonderful
[42:56] why they're wonderful thing brother
[42:57] Smith Oh Brother Smith he's talking to
[43:00] me why if he could have give a man
[43:02] anything better he would have done it
[43:04] that's the truth he was find a w wife
[43:05] has found a good thing says the wisest
[43:08] man we ever had so the wisdom of the
[43:11] holy spirit says if you found a good
[43:12] wife you found a good thing I think that
[43:15] a wife is the best thing a man can have
[43:17] outside of Salvation amen
[43:19] glory that's quite that's quite a
[43:21] ranking isn't it salvation would be the
[43:23] greatest thing you could ever have well
[43:25] right underneath that is a Godly
[43:28] wife amen not riches and not luxury not
[43:32] an easy life not all these things not
[43:35] pleasure but a wife is the is the second
[43:38] greatest thing outside of Salvation
[43:40] according to our Prophet I many believe
[43:42] he's a prophet yes sir oh
[43:44] absolutely living the life at home okay
[43:46] let's I thought this scripture was
[43:48] beautiful Let's uh let's dial in here
[43:50] Psalms
[43:52] 101:2 look what uh the holy spirit says
[43:55] I will behave myself wisely in a perfect
[43:57] way oh when wil Thou come unto me so
[44:00] he's saying Lord when will you come and
[44:02] your spirit come come to me I will walk
[44:05] within my house with a perfect
[44:09] heart so if we want God to visit our
[44:11] houses we got to walk with a perfect
[44:14] heart in our
[44:15] houses
[44:17] amen so how you live at home makes all
[44:19] the difference in your Christian Life
[44:21] home life brings a presence of God to
[44:23] your
[44:25] life
[44:28] let's just soak that in for a little bit
[44:30] I will walk within my house with a
[44:31] perfect heart David said when I want to
[44:34] see the Holy Spirit Min Minister my
[44:35] family I've got to live the right kind
[44:37] of Life at
[44:38] home Amen brother brandom said uh this
[44:43] is kind of a jokey thing but brother
[44:46] brandom says that he tells me that he
[44:49] loves her but she says you don't love
[44:52] me okay I know it's kind of difficult
[44:54] but he said it's because I don't show
[44:56] her enough
[44:58] signs okay now and he says why because
[45:00] he'd be out preaching as soon as he get
[45:01] home he don't want to spend time with
[45:02] his wife he wants to go hunting and
[45:04] fishing so here's what he says just just
[45:06] so you can see it but brother R admits
[45:08] he said I I need to maybe I don't show
[45:09] her enough signs that I love her that
[45:12] might just be like a joke back and forth
[45:14] between a couple okay but let's look
[45:17] questions
[45:18] answers he said me and my wife disagree
[45:21] we sure do I tell her I love her and she
[45:23] says don't believe I do when I first
[45:26] heard that about my jaw about dropped
[45:28] I'm like brother say
[45:30] that but he's talking this is just like
[45:32] the experienced married married couple
[45:34] that maybe isn't spending much time
[45:36] together so then we certainly disagree
[45:38] but I'm telling you that we sure get
[45:40] along all
[45:41] right now look now notice maybe I don't
[45:45] show enough signs to her that I do it
[45:49] I'm out preaching then come in home get
[45:50] my fishing rod Go Fish and see but down
[45:53] in my heart I love her I just have to
[45:55] stay away from her that's
[45:59] all now I don't recommend Brothers in
[46:01] our church doing that because none of
[46:04] the brothers in our church travel around
[46:05] the world to preach seven times right
[46:09] and none of our Brothers Spend 80% of
[46:10] their lives in visions and in a hour and
[46:13] two and three hour long prayer lines and
[46:15] get their body so tore down they can
[46:17] hardly walk out of the
[46:19] meeting amen yeah amen so I don't
[46:23] recommend people following this example
[46:25] unless you are a prophet yeah because
[46:28] what do you do with all the other quotes
[46:29] that brother brandom said and I got a
[46:31] whole bunch coming up so you're you just
[46:33] seen the I you just seen the tip of the
[46:35] iceberg okay now uh I want to get here's
[46:38] the main thing I want to preach here the
[46:39] main thing I finally just laid that
[46:41] groundwork I just kind of want to here's
[46:42] a main thing I want to show this is from
[46:44] the book uh his KN turn but I'm going to
[46:47] show it's all scriptural and it has it's
[46:50] all back by quotes it's all back by
[46:52] quotes So the book says this this is
[46:54] what brother Harold Becket say said as
[46:56] well because he must have read the
[46:57] book he has five needs that he needs to
[47:01] be a happy husband and she's got to meet
[47:04] those five needs now five is a number of
[47:06] great I thought that was very scriptural
[47:08] uh she has five needs and he's got to
[47:12] meet those now these are the number of
[47:13] the slides just so I could find the
[47:14] slides because I want to start with the
[47:15] sisters needs first because I always
[47:17] start with challenging the men and
[47:18] encouraging the men trying to strengthen
[47:20] the men to uh be leaders in their homes
[47:23] uh Satan will battle men to the tooth
[47:26] and nail to not be a good leader because
[47:27] that's what they're called to do yeah
[47:30] God God wants men to be strong leaders
[47:32] but Satan wants to fight them and make
[47:33] them be more passive and well honey you
[47:35] just do whatever you want instead of
[47:37] taking up and taking command brother
[47:39] said a man should be like a general in
[47:40] the
[47:41] home he should have the leading of the
[47:43] Lord he said I never seen I don't have
[47:46] this score with me but I read on Herold
[47:47] Beck Herold becket's packet he said I
[47:50] never seen one woman ever leave a man
[47:52] that stood up and was led of the Lord
[47:54] and spoke and led like a a real General
[47:57] amen why because she's made to follow
[48:00] she's made to be submissive that's what
[48:02] she naturally does and she wants
[48:04] somebody to go lead
[48:05] her if she's a spiritful woman if if she
[48:08] or she if she falls away or she's not
[48:10] LED of the spirit or something like that
[48:12] brother she said she gets an iron
[48:14] disposition so iron disposition is your
[48:16] disposition is your your countenance uh
[48:19] the way your face looks your actions and
[48:21] your attitude so a woman with the iron
[48:23] disposition has the wrong Spirit on it
[48:26] and God can't work with that she's got
[48:28] to repent of that instead of an iron
[48:30] disposition you's got to have a soft
[48:32] disposition a gentle
[48:35] disposition
[48:37] amen hallelujah amen I'll just keep
[48:40] preaching because I know it's the truth
[48:41] yes sir I preached this in Guyana one
[48:44] time and I was just I was so sad I'm
[48:46] like they're not even saying amen and
[48:48] the sisters come up the next morning and
[48:50] said brother Jesse don't be discouraged
[48:52] he said you're just preaching these
[48:52] things so hard and they're so true it's
[48:54] cutting us so deep we can't can't even
[48:55] say Amen because we have so many things
[48:57] to fix in our home I said thank you for
[48:58] sharing that sister that really helped
[49:00] me so I wanted to hear more amens you
[49:02] know the previous Services I preach and
[49:04] they be amen and brothers be jumping
[49:05] smacking the walls and and you know
[49:07] theyd be waving their their their their
[49:10] hanger Chiefs and everything and then
[49:11] when I preach on family it's like you
[49:13] could you could hear a pin drop all
[49:14] around the church like am I the same
[49:16] preacher are you the same people what's
[49:18] going on
[49:19] here yeah amen I hope I hope what I'm I
[49:23] hope what I'm doing I hope I'm skin down
[49:25] all of our of our our fleshly habits
[49:28] yeah that the soul might over the soul
[49:31] might confess our sins and the Soul
[49:33] might take greater control of Our Lives
[49:35] Lord and not walk by the fleshly desires
[49:39] okay so let's look at um her uh her
[49:43] needs and uh next time Lord willing I'm
[49:45] here it's going to be a few weeks as far
[49:46] as when I preach on a Sunday it's gonna
[49:48] be a while but I'll be here on Wednesday
[49:49] night's preaching uh but uh what I'll do
[49:52] Lord
[49:53] willing I want to next time we're here I
[49:56] want to I want to have the couples
[49:58] identify which needs are the most
[50:00] important okay for example like a woman
[50:03] has five needs and this is what this
[50:05] Christian counselor found out after uh a
[50:08] thousand counseling sessions and brother
[50:10] random said all these so here here they
[50:12] are a woman needs affection brother bam
[50:15] said every one of
[50:16] these uh she needs affection she's got
[50:19] to have affection she's got to have
[50:21] openness and honesty she's got to have a
[50:23] conversation with her husband
[50:25] conversation often she's got to have him
[50:27] committed to the
[50:28] family and she's got to have financial
[50:31] support those are the five most
[50:32] important now what we mean by this is in
[50:34] your marriages you got to identify what
[50:36] is the most important for you so for
[50:38] like some sisters number one might just
[50:40] be I just need an honest husband for
[50:43] some sisters it might be I just need a
[50:44] husband that hugs me and kiss me and
[50:46] when I walk in gives me a hug and uh
[50:48] things like that or when you know he
[50:50] walks in or whatever more that might be
[50:52] their number one need or maybe
[50:54] conversation I I just need somebody to
[50:56] talk to I'm all day talking to these
[50:57] kids all day long I just got to talk to
[50:59] the adult when he gets home I just need
[51:01] somebody to talk to it all depends on
[51:03] your need and brothers if you care about
[51:06] your wife you'll try to do better job
[51:08] that's exactly right if you care yeah
[51:10] amen because you promised to love her
[51:14] you promised God you would love
[51:16] her and that's no joke you don't make
[51:19] but the Bible said don't make a vow to
[51:20] God and not pay it you will
[51:23] suffer that's true so let me recall this
[51:26] this is in red now it was
[51:29] important the brothers who are married
[51:32] probably have already been able to do
[51:34] all those things which is why their
[51:36] wives married them in the first place at
[51:39] some point he was meeting all of her
[51:41] needs and so she said yes I will I will

[52:23] forget a lot of good things too don't we
[52:26] everybody forgets everybody falls short
[52:27] of the glory of God everybody needs to
[52:29] relearn things and so forth like
[52:31] that okay so let's go through these by
[52:33] God's grace how I do it on time okay
[52:34] I've been preaching about an
[52:36] hour okay praise the Lord not even an
[52:39] hour yet okay the first need she has now

[52:56] five I'm sorry brother Andy can you do
[52:59] Ephesians 5:25 anyone else can read for
[53:01] me Malachi can you read uh 1 Peter 3:7
[53:05] Scott can you read 1 Corinthians 73 now
[53:08] I need one more reader we have one more
[53:11] uh s Amy can you read Romans 12:10 okay
[53:15] so we got it
[53:16] Andy Malachi Brother Scott and sister
[53:21] thank you okay Andy whenever you're
[53:23] ready sir how love your wives even as
[53:26] Christ also loved the church and gave
[53:28] himself for it amen so Paul commands
[53:31] them to love okay uh Malachi what's
[53:34] First Peter 3:7 likewise he husbands
[53:38] dwell them according to knowledge honor
[53:41] unto the wife as unto the weaker vessel
[53:44] and as being HS together of the grace of
[53:47] life that your prayers be not okay so
[53:50] affection can be showed through honor
[53:52] affection is of course motivated by love
[53:55] uh and man must dwell with his wife with
[53:57] an understanding she needs affection she
[54:00] needs love she needs flowers or hugs or
[54:02] kisses or whatever she needs you got to
[54:03] give it to her but Scott First
[54:05] Corinthians
[54:07] 7:3 the husband renderto the wife Ben
[54:11] likewise also
[54:12] wife okay now that's speaking of the
[54:15] physical marriage but benevolence just
[54:17] means overall kindness yeah and love and
[54:21] affection so just as a man needs his pH
[54:23] we'll get to that one Lord willing
[54:25] eventually just as a man needs physical
[54:27] relations so a woman needs
[54:29] affection she's got to have that in fact
[54:32] what the book says the book says before
[54:34] a man touches her body he should touch
[54:35] her heart and show her that he loves her
[54:38] yeah with affection yeah there a woman
[54:41] don't feel love like for example a man
[54:43] because he's so high passion a man can a
[54:46] woman a wife can just rub his arm and
[54:48] he'll start getting thinking about those
[54:50] kind of things are you with me I have to
[54:51] go too deep I don't want to go I don't
[54:53] want to go too descriptive but a man is
[54:55] so quick High passion many times if his
[54:57] wife just rubs his shoulder or something
[54:59] like that or gives him a hug he can be
[55:01] ready to have uh some uh he can ready
[55:03] have some relations brother call some
[55:05] family relations that's how that's how
[55:08] he's wired brother said he's built to do
[55:10] that so he can
[55:12] reproduce and fulfill the re fruitful
[55:15] multiply that God commanded Adam okay
[55:18] but he's got to show her du benevolence
[55:20] he's got to he's got to return the love
[55:22] like she gives herself to love him he's
[55:24] got to return love back to her amen okay
[55:27] Romans
[55:28] 1210 be kindly affection one to another
[55:32] with Brotherly Love in honor preferring
[55:34] one another amen kindly affection
[55:37] affection is a Bible word yeah and
[55:40] brother said so we should be
[55:41] affectionate towards all the saints what
[55:43] about our wives and husbands I just
[55:45] showed you du benevolence and a man must
[55:47] love okay so here's brother R shaming
[55:49] men who lose affection for their wives I
[55:51] was talking to men about losing their
[55:53] affections I told you brother ra said
[55:54] this literally for their wives and don't
[55:57] love them as they did when they were
[55:58] sweethearts shame on you you ought to do
[56:00] it she's always your sweetheart
[56:02] absolutely that's the part she should be
[56:04] and you should treat her like that oh
[56:06] never let that honeymoon cease because
[56:07] it ain't gonna going to in heaven it's
[56:10] just going to be perfectly one
[56:12] there like looks like some women ought
[56:14] ought to said amen he said don't it I
[56:18] like that looks like some women ought to
[56:20] Said Amen to that yeah brother starts
[56:22] talking to the congregation yeah amen
[56:24] how come another sister said
[56:26] amen he said sister Hickerson why don't
[56:29] you say something for somebody back
[56:30] there oh thank you sister Cox very good
[56:32] brother Cox that's for you everywhere
[56:35] you are now he says so I just preach
[56:36] that for you brother
[56:39] Cox glory and we should never forget to
[56:42] honor each other always be sweethearts
[56:44] never let it cease he tells a story I
[56:47] read this two weeks ago of the Catholic
[56:50] man he said brother brandom my wife
[56:53] thinks I ought to come in every night
[56:54] and kiss her and hug her and make it out
[56:57] like we just was fixing to get
[56:59] married and we got a bunch of kids he
[57:03] said whoop wait a minute boy you're
[57:05] wrong that's just the same as it was
[57:07] before you're married you must always
[57:09] remember she's 40 years old now and she
[57:11] really needs your attention other words
[57:13] you're you're wrong you need to kiss her
[57:15] you need to hug her that's right are you
[57:18] with me church I say you're wrong shame
[57:20] on that Catholic man for not loving his
[57:23] wife like he did before got married and
[57:26] brother shame on me and shame on us if
[57:27] we don't love our wives the right way
[57:30] yes that won't get a lot of amens but it
[57:33] will in heaven I know that yeah I know
[57:36] the Lord saying amen glory yes sir right
[57:40] conversation she needs
[57:43] conversation um now this is more implied
[57:46] there's no scripture that says
[57:48] conversation but let's let's just read
[57:50] uh First Corinthians 7:33 read that and
[57:54] look what Paul
[57:57] says this is where I'm taking this I
[57:59] believe that this is implied because
[58:01] brother brandom says it a lot I have a
[58:03] lot of quotes for this one I have no
[58:04] scripture that says you know have a lot
[58:06] of conversation but I have a lot of
[58:07] quotes brother said you need to sit and
[58:09] talk to your wife sit down and talk with
[58:12] your wife amen I think the sisters are
[58:15] sister are you really liking these
[58:16] sermons here by God's grace sisters okay
[58:19] all right so the sisters not be happy
[58:21] with me the brothers be mad with me okay
[58:24] all right I'll be I'll be careful
[58:26] Brothers I'm just kidding I'm just
[58:28] kidding we all love the Lord don't
[58:30] we but he that is married care for the
[58:33] things that are of this world how he may
[58:35] please his wife this is Paul now what if
[58:38] everyone everyone in that day would have
[58:40] took Paul's opinion about oh everybody
[58:41] should be single the coming of the Lord
[58:42] is
[58:43] not yeah that he said this is not me
[58:46] this is my this is he said this is not
[58:48] the Lord this is my thoughts he say well
[58:50] we wouldn't have many more many families
[58:52] many Christian families they'd all die
[58:54] out
[58:55] right it's a good thing some of them
[58:57] have got married and here Paul is giving
[58:59] advice to married couple and he's never
[59:01] been married right right could you have
[59:04] received correction from a man that
[59:05] never been married oh my I hope you
[59:07] could because he was a prophet yeah amen
[59:11] that's exactly right yeah see because
[59:13] it's the office God God gives a gift he
[59:16] gives an office and we're supposed to
[59:17] submit to the word that comes through
[59:18] that gift and office yeah whether they
[59:21] experience it or not submit to the word
[59:23] that comes through the office exactly
[59:25] right okay now here's the word he's
[59:27] supposed to please his wife okay
[59:29] Brothers brothers are supposed to strive
[59:31] to please to accommodate oneself to the
[59:34] opinions desires and interests of others
[59:37] women have an interest in talking don't
[59:39] they they just like to talk and there's
[59:41] nothing wrong with that I like talking
[59:42] too as long as it's about good things I
[59:44] really like it I like to talk about
[59:46] Jesus you know who wouldn't do that but
[59:48] some but you know women just like to
[59:49] talk even in first grade the girls are
[59:51] more linguistic than the boys girls pick
[59:53] up reading normally a lot faster than
[59:54] the boys the boys are always slower the
[59:56] boys have a hard time expressing
[59:58] themselves but girls can rattle off and
[59:59] talk and if I let them talk they'll keep
[1:00:01] talking talking talking talking
[1:00:03] talk God made them that
[1:00:07] way God made them to be more verbal
[1:00:10] that's true so as a man we I've got to
[1:00:14] under Peter said I got to understand
[1:00:16] with a deep understanding how to love my
[1:00:17] wife and honor my wife and then Paul
[1:00:19] said if you're married you're have to
[1:00:21] please your husband or wife and that
[1:00:23] means know what h desires are an
[1:00:25] interest my wife just just desires to
[1:00:28] have conversations sometime so after we
[1:00:30] put the kids to bed sometimes they'll
[1:00:32] come out and walk out we'll just talk on
[1:00:33] the couch sometimes I give her a back
[1:00:35] massage or shoulder massage sometimes
[1:00:37] I'll massage her feet or something like
[1:00:38] that every now and then I let her give
[1:00:40] me a foot massage that's kind of nice
[1:00:42] but not all the time but it's just
[1:00:44] something we can do while talking and we
[1:00:46] just need to talk and just connect and
[1:00:48] just uh she that's how she feels love so
[1:00:50] I'm trying to meet her need and I think
[1:00:53] a Christian should do that
[1:00:55] look what brother BR
[1:00:57] says he said um something happened to me
[1:00:59] a few weeks ago I'm determined by the
[1:01:00] help of God never to be negative on
[1:01:02] anything
[1:01:04] anymore to blast my heart out and remind
[1:01:06] me no matter what it costs be sincere
[1:01:08] get down to the bottom of it he said you
[1:01:10] don't get no complex by the blood of
[1:01:12] Jesus Christ you get love see if we have
[1:01:14] a complex toward our wives our husbands
[1:01:16] we have this complex we can't get rid of
[1:01:18] this bad feeling or towards a church
[1:01:20] member or a pastor or preacher or a
[1:01:22] sister anybody that's not from Christ
[1:01:25] that's from our own human
[1:01:27] flesh Christ doesn't bring complexes
[1:01:29] Christ beings
[1:01:31] love he said
[1:01:34] uh okay I'm gonna skip that now he said
[1:01:37] Fellowship comes by love and love
[1:01:38] requires fellowship if you love your
[1:01:40] wife you've just got to get with her and
[1:01:44] talk with
[1:01:46] her that means Brothers you got to
[1:01:48] listen and then say some words back okay
[1:01:51] here's how it goes you listen and you
[1:01:53] comment about that comment
[1:01:55] and and that's how you talk is that okay
[1:01:58] brother I had to learn that I had to
[1:02:01] learn that like I told you once we had
[1:02:02] two kids I think I shared this testimony
[1:02:04] when I opened the series after we had
[1:02:06] two kids I was so busy preaching and
[1:02:07] doing my Master's Degree that I wasn't
[1:02:09] even talking to my wife and my wife said
[1:02:11] we're just like uh she said we're just
[1:02:13] like roommates I don't even know I don't
[1:02:14] feel like she said I don't even want any
[1:02:16] more kids because I don't have any I'm
[1:02:17] just I feel like I'm all alone with my
[1:02:19] with my two children and when she told
[1:02:21] me that about broke my heart because it
[1:02:23] kind of convicted me like oh that's
[1:02:25] right I'm not even paying attention to
[1:02:26] you I've got yeah a lot of
[1:02:27] responsibilities but what's more
[1:02:29] important my master's degree or my
[1:02:30] family can anybody tell me that my job
[1:02:33] or my income is that more important or
[1:02:34] is my family more important family right
[1:02:36] family right praise God yeah brother man
[1:02:39] said God family you're
[1:02:42] last right and so that convicted me then
[1:02:45] that's when we started praying and
[1:02:46] reading books and finding quotes or
[1:02:48] brother R says these very same things
[1:02:50] that are being said see if you love her
[1:02:53] you just got to get with her and talk
[1:02:54] with her if you love your friends just
[1:02:55] got to get with them and talk to them if
[1:02:57] you love God there's got to be a basis
[1:02:59] for fellowship and that agreement is
[1:03:01] based upon your vow see I vow to love
[1:03:03] Jesus so I sit down and talk to him I
[1:03:05] vowed to love my wife so I'll sit down
[1:03:06] and talk to her glory desperations I
[1:03:10] love this the only way you can have
[1:03:12] faith is have love first because after
[1:03:15] all faith is Love's
[1:03:17] incentive okay it's an incentive to love
[1:03:21] now you if you don't have love you can't
[1:03:23] have faith Faith how can you have faith
[1:03:25] in your wife if you don't love her
[1:03:27] that's felo how about agapo to God how
[1:03:29] can it be if you don't love God now
[1:03:32] listen here it is if you said you loved
[1:03:35] your wife Brothers how many love their
[1:03:37] wives but you never tell her about
[1:03:41] it and set her down and make love to her
[1:03:45] and express it to her kiss her hug her
[1:03:48] and tell her she's the best cook in the
[1:03:50] country and all the things that you know
[1:03:54] so see you have to express what you know
[1:03:56] a woman needs to hear what you know and
[1:03:59] the brother said Amen brother brandom I
[1:04:02] believe desperation was a good message
[1:04:03] from
[1:04:04] God I believe it
[1:04:06] was I can amen it
[1:04:10] yes and how pretty she is and how much
[1:04:13] you love her if you don't do that she'll
[1:04:16] never know
[1:04:18] it because a woman has a built-in
[1:04:20] insecurity about her you read books and
[1:04:23] things about women women are constantly
[1:04:25] battling insecurity am I pretty enough
[1:04:27] am I smart enough uh does he love me is
[1:04:30] our marriage on the right place am I
[1:04:32] okay did I do anything wrong she has a
[1:04:34] built-in insecurity and so God made the
[1:04:37] man he's supposed to be a fighter he's
[1:04:39] supposed to be a conquer he's supposed
[1:04:40] to go after her and win her heart and
[1:04:42] love
[1:04:43] her and keep loving
[1:04:46] her and keep meeting her need praise the
[1:04:49] Lord and how does he do that through the
[1:04:51] love of Christ so it's not selfishly
[1:04:53] motivated it's motivated by Christ love
[1:04:55] when he has a lot of Love Of Christ in
[1:04:57] his heart he'll of course love his wife
[1:04:59] that Christ gave
[1:05:01] him if you don't do that she'll never
[1:05:04] know it that's the way if you do love
[1:05:06] her you express it yeah and I know
[1:05:10] Brothers some of us have had hard
[1:05:11] childhoods and things like that like I
[1:05:13] said my my mom and dad never told me
[1:05:15] they love me never so as soon as I was
[1:05:17] old enough to get girlfriends I always
[1:05:18] say i' love you because I always want to
[1:05:19] hear somebody say they love me back I
[1:05:22] knew my mom and dad loveed me but they
[1:05:23] never told me
[1:05:25] so I always was want to have somebody
[1:05:26] love me tell me you love me and still
[1:05:28] this day I love words of affirmation
[1:05:30] that's the five love languages that's a
[1:05:31] whole another book but I just love when
[1:05:33] people tell me something like really
[1:05:35] Glory because I never had that as a
[1:05:37] child I always uh always wanted someone
[1:05:40] to tell
[1:05:41] me so and sometimes it's it's it's so
[1:05:44] bad sometimes it would be so bad I'm
[1:05:46] like fishing for compliments I just try
[1:05:48] to get some feedback from somebody like
[1:05:50] I go up to my uncles and say you what
[1:05:52] can I do to be a better husband and
[1:05:53] they're like you're doing doing fine
[1:05:54] you're doing a great job he said you
[1:05:56] know they said you know why you do that
[1:05:57] Jess you know why you come up and ask
[1:05:59] men all the time for advice is because
[1:06:01] you're so insecure because your dad
[1:06:02] never told you that when you were
[1:06:03] younger I started crying I said you're
[1:06:05] exactly
[1:06:07] right my dad never said I was doing good
[1:06:10] he would he would slap me on the back
[1:06:12] and joke around with me you know I'd win
[1:06:13] state championships and I'd win all
[1:06:15] these I'd break all these records and
[1:06:16] still I just wanted somebody to tell me
[1:06:18] I was doing good I just wanted my dad
[1:06:19] and mom to tell me that but they just
[1:06:21] weren't built like that that's not their
[1:06:22] build that's not their ja up so now God
[1:06:26] showed me these things oh okay that I
[1:06:29] now I have the love of Christ now I can
[1:06:31] forgive them I don't have to hold that
[1:06:32] against them they're just a different
[1:06:34] kind of person but now I can love them
[1:06:36] back the way they need to be loved
[1:06:38] praise the Lord so I won't be selfish
[1:06:40] and say well because they didn't love me
[1:06:42] I'm not gonna love them back I'm gonna
[1:06:43] say well I got so much love of Jesus I
[1:06:44] can love them back even if they don't
[1:06:46] know how to love yet because I'm hoping
[1:06:47] one day they learn how to love am
[1:06:50] amen I don't have an excuse to sit back
[1:06:52] and say well because I wasn't loved I'm
[1:06:54] not going to love back that's
[1:06:56] selfish that's prideful but when you got
[1:06:59] the love of Christ you can't help to
[1:07:01] express it to
[1:07:02] somebody
[1:07:04] amen so if you never tell your wife
[1:07:07] how's she gonna know a woman is built to
[1:07:09] be like I said insecure so the man can
[1:07:12] keep coming and telling like every time
[1:07:15] my wife cooks a meal you can ask my
[1:07:16] children I say children what do we tell
[1:07:18] Mom for supper and they all say thank
[1:07:20] you Mommy it's delicious all these
[1:07:22] things like that I try to do that every
[1:07:24] Mother's Day I try to pour out love on
[1:07:26] my wife every time there's an
[1:07:28] anniversary pour out love because she
[1:07:29] needs to know that she's
[1:07:31] loved and think of the type does the
[1:07:33] church need to know that the church do
[1:07:35] you need to know that Jesus loves you
[1:07:36] every now and then does every enjoy that
[1:07:38] when the spirit comes down and he just
[1:07:40] makes love to
[1:07:41] you anybody like that out there anybody

[1:08:30] in the menopause
[1:08:32] time that's when everything's wrong with
[1:08:34] her and there's nothing wrong with her
[1:08:36] yet everything's wrong with her and
[1:08:37] she's not just putting on she really
[1:08:39] feels that it's just as real any person

[1:09:37] going through the changes and
[1:09:38] everything's wrong but everything's
[1:09:39] right all at the same time that's when a
[1:09:42] man really has to love his wife that's
[1:09:44] what a prophet of God

[1:10:49] complete your wedding in the bedroom
[1:10:51] amen he said because that's where life
[1:10:53] moves song so that's the final that's
[1:10:55] the completion of a married
[1:10:57] life amen you still love me Church Amen
[1:11:01] Brother John is there going to be a vote
[1:11:02] afterwards about the next Pastor for
[1:11:04] this church okay let me know the bylaw
[1:11:06] say I gota at least know you're gonna
[1:11:07] vote on it okay all right that's the
[1:11:10] bylaws Okay the third one is financial
[1:11:14] support great

[1:11:19] decade's pretty a 10 a tithe financial
[1:11:24] support uh she's got to have it now
[1:11:26] we're not going to read all these this
[1:11:27] is I don't think this is a major problem
[1:11:29] here now it might be a major problem
[1:11:30] Brothers if we work too
[1:11:32] much praise the Lord Ian I talk with all
[1:11:35] the brothers you talk with me we all can
[1:11:38] work too much sometimes can't we let's
[1:11:39] just be honest we all can do it
[1:11:41] sometimes we can't help it sometimes we
[1:11:43] can help it so God help us to be able to
[1:11:45] balance it but 2 Thessalonians 310
[1:11:48] through2 says a man that doesn't work
[1:11:49] shouldn't eat uh God this is Genesis 2
[1:11:51] God told Adam to work and subd do the
[1:11:54] the the garden 1 Timothy 58 I don't
[1:11:56] remember that one let me read that one I
[1:11:59] got it 1 Timothy
[1:12:02] 58 but if any provide not for his own
[1:12:04] and especially for those of his own
[1:12:06] household he yet denied the faith and is
[1:12:07] worse than an Infidel okay that's for a
[1:12:09] man that won't work and provide okay and
[1:12:12] Colossians 3:23 and 24 I don't remember
[1:12:14] that one I think it that's work with all
[1:12:17] your heart if I'm not
[1:12:19] mistaken Colossians 3 so she's got have
[1:12:23] financial support she's got to have
[1:12:25] somebody if she's a stay at home she
[1:12:26] needs somebody to support
[1:12:30] her okay yeah knowing that of the Lord
[1:12:33] you shall receive the reward of the
[1:12:34] inheritance for you serve the Lord
[1:12:36] Christ I like that you serve the Lord
[1:12:38] Christ but he that doeth wrong shall
[1:12:40] receive for the
[1:12:42] wrong no I'm sorry I I skip verse 23 and
[1:12:45] whatsoever you do do it hardly as to the
[1:12:47] Lord and not unto men knowing that of
[1:12:48] the Lord you shall receive the reward of
[1:12:50] inheritance for you serve the Lord
[1:12:52] Christ okay yeah so whatever work you do
[1:12:54] do it with all your heart so most
[1:12:57] Brothers in here do a lot of great work
[1:12:58] in their hearts uh and they they work
[1:13:00] really hard for their families praise
[1:13:03] God at least as far as I know Brothers

[1:13:06] lately and sleeping and their alarm's
[1:13:08] not going off anybody any any brothers
[1:13:10] proud of to admit

[1:13:18] we had traffic I was late once once or
[1:13:21] twice but one thing I don't want to be

[1:13:28] perish yes sir I don't want to be late

[1:13:32] brother M said you it'd be better to
[1:13:33] miss work than it would be to miss
[1:13:34] service amen I got a quote on that you
[1:13:37] want to see that okay should a person
[1:13:39] pay ties to an individual or should a
[1:13:41] Christian work sure he should he's the
[1:13:43] man that will work as a
[1:13:45] Christian now if a man sick and his now
[1:13:47] this is get on a different thought if a
[1:13:49] man is sick and his wife can't work I
[1:13:52] mean if he can't work I don't blame his
[1:13:54] wife has got to make a living that's
[1:13:56] right but if she's just out working to
[1:13:57] have a little extra money you better
[1:13:58] keep her away from that scalawag
[1:14:01] Bunch uh I know a marriage uh that was
[1:14:03] in the message at the time is no longer
[1:14:05] the message and it never came to this
[1:14:06] church just so you
[1:14:08] know uh the husband got really greedy
[1:14:10] for money so he made he forced his wife
[1:14:12] to go out and work and then men started
[1:14:15] hitting on her and she hated it but he
[1:14:18] forced her to do it because of
[1:14:20] money and they they were in the message
[1:14:22] at the time
[1:14:24] this quote I don't know if this quote
[1:14:25] ever got to them but this this situation
[1:14:28] was a reality of this
[1:14:30] quote women don't belong out there with
[1:14:32] a bunch of lustful men that are beasts
[1:14:35] can I say it like that they're beasts
[1:14:37] without the Holy Ghost yes sir and they
[1:14:38] look at a woman and young women and just
[1:14:40] you sisters Know a Man without the Holy
[1:14:42] Ghost most of them look at women as just
[1:14:44] a sex object yeah right is that true
[1:14:46] Brothers right that's nothing but that's
[1:14:49] pretty flat but that's pretty true a man
[1:14:51] is so built like that with a
[1:14:52] testosterone that's all he thinks about
[1:14:54] is this his next uh conquering of a
[1:14:55] woman is this his next pleasure is this
[1:14:57] his next that or that if a man don't
[1:14:59] have a clean mind he's not pure by the
[1:15:01] Holy Spirit he's nothing but a beast
[1:15:02] he's Savage right that is that true yeah
[1:15:06] it's
[1:15:07] true that's why sister you don't hang
[1:15:09] around people that don't have are born
[1:15:10] again you don't hang around with people
[1:15:11] one-on-one like that with brothers that
[1:15:13] are one-on-one don't hang on around like
[1:15:14] that keep yourself pure you don't know
[1:15:16] what a man will do they're they're
[1:15:18] without the Holy Ghost they cannot trust
[1:15:19] them
[1:15:21] right now he goes on to say this again
[1:15:23] and Mister you might call yourself ever
[1:15:25] so good but if you got lodes and other
[1:15:27] things that calls you away from her at
[1:15:28] night you ought to be ashamed of
[1:15:30] yourself so things that keep you away
[1:15:32] from your wife at night now if Brothers
[1:15:34] got to work third shift that you know
[1:15:36] that's part of life um but if you got
[1:15:38] other things that you don't need to miss
[1:15:40] or that you could miss and you're
[1:15:41] purposely staying away from your wife at
[1:15:43] night that's wrong God gave you a home
[1:15:45] to cherish and comfort and things like
[1:15:47] that it's a shame to see the way man
[1:15:49] does their wives and wives do man the
[1:15:51] Womanhood and fatherhood of the nation
[1:15:53] is Tor to Pieces divorce courts piled
[1:15:55] full see they purpos it now how can they
[1:15:57] be married look at this church how can
[1:15:59] they be married on their wedding day and
[1:16:00] so in love and then a few years later
[1:16:02] I'm not even gonna go home I don't even
[1:16:03] want to go home to see my wife what
[1:16:04] happened there what happened how can
[1:16:07] they be so much in love and then a few
[1:16:09] years later they don't even want to be
[1:16:11] together they'll purposely make excuses
[1:16:12] to stay away from home what is that what
[1:16:15] spirit is that ain't the holy spirit
[1:16:18] because the holy spirit said I promise
[1:16:19] you God I'm going to love her like she

[1:17:01] to preach a Sunday for you for a while
[1:17:03] so just bear with me here yes and I
[1:17:05] don't know who's staying for the second
[1:17:06] service and like I said it's a whole
[1:17:07] different topic but uh I want to make
[1:17:09] sure I get through these okay family
[1:17:10] commitment
[1:17:12] now she's got to have family commitments
[1:17:15] and this is separate from just working
[1:17:16] and making money this is separate this
[1:17:17] is spiritual leadership she's got to
[1:17:20] have a spiritual leader in the home now
[1:17:22] this is Genesis 18 this is where uh God
[1:17:25] said I know Abraham will command his
[1:17:27] children and his servants after him to
[1:17:29] keep the will of the Lord so see Abraham
[1:17:32] was a commander he taught his children
[1:17:34] he C he taught his servants he was a
[1:17:35] teacher in his home and and the brother
[1:17:38] said and if you're the Seed of Abraham
[1:17:40] let's do the same thing Abraham seed
[1:17:42] Deuteronomy 11 is where God tells Moses
[1:17:44] tell the children of Israel when they
[1:17:45] come into the promised land he said talk
[1:17:47] about the Commandments of God and you're
[1:17:49] laying down and you're rising up at the
[1:17:51] table as you walk as you work he said
[1:17:53] put him on your forehead put him on the
[1:17:56] doorpost this is how a man is committed
[1:17:58] to his children he talks them about the
[1:18:01] Lord amen glory that's was before the
[1:18:04] Holy Ghost came in the baptism okay and
[1:18:08] Colossians 3:21 I'm gonna read that
[1:18:09] because I'm already in Colossians 3 oh
[1:18:11] yeah fathers provoke not your children
[1:18:13] to anger so provoke means a stir up
[1:18:15] fathers should stir up their children
[1:18:17] not to anger but to happiness or some
[1:18:19] motivation
[1:18:21] amen
[1:18:23] husbands we are supposed to stir our
[1:18:24] children up that's right I'm not talking
[1:18:27] a a protoplasmic spanking that's I'm not
[1:18:30] talking about that although they need
[1:18:32] that sometimes but what I'm talking
[1:18:35] about is you're we're supposed to be
[1:18:36] able to deal with our children to stir
[1:18:37] them up not to get angry but to get
[1:18:40] motivated to do something right whether
[1:18:42] it's to learn how to handle money or
[1:18:43] learn how to work or learn to be better
[1:18:45] in school we're supposed to Ser them up
[1:18:47] to want to do better not to get them
[1:18:50] angry but to get them to serve God
[1:18:53] okay but if you do that lest they be
[1:18:55] discouraged so you can always tell a
[1:18:57] child that isn't being father the right
[1:18:58] way because they're disheartened and
[1:19:00] they're spiritless they're just kind of
[1:19:03] it's going along there's no heart now
[1:19:05] when they get a teenager sometimes it
[1:19:06] just happens you might be the best
[1:19:07] parent in the world but they're just
[1:19:09] going through all those emotions and
[1:19:11] hormones and things like that okay so a
[1:19:13] woman's got to have this now let's look
[1:19:15] at this brother R talks about the family
[1:19:17] altars got to be
[1:19:19] established God I pray you'll mend up
[1:19:22] the broken homes I pray God will do that

[1:19:27] here God I pray you'll men up the broken
[1:19:29] homes and make the ones that's in homes
[1:19:32] that's indifferent fathers and mothers

[1:19:42] see serving the lord how many got this
[1:19:44] morning and thanked him for the year old
[1:19:47] or the old year what it meant and asked
[1:19:48] him and said forget my back year forget
[1:19:50] the last year he said we did at the
[1:19:54] bedside when we got up so brother got up
[1:19:55] and prayed with his family right by the
[1:19:57] bed and then come to the table where we
[1:19:59] usually have a little family altar they
[1:20:01] gather on the table and pray so mother

[1:20:05] prayed at the breakfast table
[1:20:07] together that's having a family altar in
[1:20:10] your house and so we always try to make
[1:20:12] it a habit of praying of a night before

[1:22:26] I'm sorry you put me on your apron let
[1:22:28] me help you get
[1:22:30] supper now if I put my wife's apron on
[1:22:33] at home I would look
[1:22:34] ridiculous it's got pink and dots and
[1:22:37] I'm like my goodness I can I rather just
[1:22:39] get dirty than wear an apron myself
[1:22:41] that's normally what I
[1:22:43] do but if I I do help out at home I do
[1:22:46] wash dishes I do help cook sometimes and
[1:22:48] different things like that I do sweep
[1:22:49] and I take out the trash and recycle and
[1:22:52] clean out the fridge and I do the
[1:22:53] grocery shopping I do whatever I can do
[1:22:55] to help out the home but look what he
[1:22:56] does he said I'll put on your Rob or
[1:22:59] your apron and I'll help you get supper
[1:23:01] ready because she's already frazzled and
[1:23:03] she needs some help so he says I can
[1:23:05] help
[1:23:06] you Brothers can we maybe find some ways
[1:23:09] to help out at home maybe by God's grace
[1:23:11] if we pray about it maybe we
[1:23:13] can if brother brand could help out we
[1:23:15] can help out yeah and so I put this
[1:23:18] apron on you know you imagine brother
[1:23:21] Brandon honey tie the back string oh
[1:23:22] that's too tight can you loosen

[1:23:48] because love condescends down to
[1:23:50] someone's lower level in other words
[1:23:53] love
[1:23:54] serves love sees someone hurting and
[1:23:58] goes down to their level a woman's role
[1:24:01] was below brother Ram's level but
[1:24:03] because he loved her and because he
[1:24:04] wanted to help her he had to condescend
[1:24:06] and come down to her level same thing
[1:24:08] God did God was way above our fleshly
[1:24:10] level but he condescended and created a
[1:24:12] body in the Virgin womb of Mary and
[1:24:15] Condes himself down and became flesh and
[1:24:18] lived in flesh and died to death that we
[1:24:21] might Ascend into heaven amen glory
[1:24:24] hallelujah
[1:24:26] amen and I begin to chop up some carrots
[1:24:29] and things you know going on some those
[1:24:31] Brothers might chop off our fingers if
[1:24:32] we try to do that but be careful
[1:24:34] Brothers if you haven't chopped carrots
[1:24:35] in a
[1:24:36] while right he chopping carrots he got

[1:24:50] heart that's a real man
[1:24:53] and as soon as I got her quiet after a

[1:25:59] the atmosphere here at church just gotta
[1:26:01] love each
[1:26:02] other did y'all know that brother said
[1:26:04] all these things or is this all new to
[1:26:05] everybody is this is this old is this
[1:26:07] old it's real it's exactly what he
[1:26:11] said okay all right now this is the same
[1:26:14] story yeah I'm G let's get past that
[1:26:17] okay I'm trying to get down here okay
[1:26:18] honesty and openness this is one's
[1:26:19] critical this one is absolutely critical
[1:26:22] and let me say like this is this is the
[1:26:23] one I struggle with
[1:26:25] sometimes because when I was younger I
[1:26:27] would lie a lot I would steal a lot I
[1:26:28] was very dishonest that was kind of in
[1:26:31] my my atmosphere and so I've got I've
[1:26:35] I've had to learn over the years to be
[1:26:36] very careful to be totally honest with
[1:26:38] my wife tell her everything and be open
[1:26:40] to tell her what I'm thinking what I'm
[1:26:41] doing I struggle with that as a
[1:26:43] child I would lie and tell do tell
[1:26:46] things right and things like that now
[1:26:48] there's all kinds of scriptures on this
[1:26:50] so I'm just going to get to the quotes
[1:26:51] by said be honest with all men um I love
[1:26:55] this one Jesus said if you're my friends
[1:26:57] I tell you everything that I do so Jesus
[1:27:00] the husband tells the bride
[1:27:03] everything Abraham oh this God tells the
[1:27:06] secrets to his children Israel I love
[1:27:09] this one let's read that one Psalms 325
[1:27:10] let's if you got your Bibles let's read
[1:27:12] that you'll like that one because
[1:27:13] Genesis 38 is Adam hiding from God and
[1:27:16] brothers that's what I struggle with and
[1:27:18] that's what a lot of men struggle with
[1:27:20] they hide when they sin they hide
[1:27:22] instead of just going to confess
[1:27:26] it uh Psalms
[1:27:30] 325 I think as humans that's what we all
[1:27:32] do because the Bible said Adam and Eve
[1:27:33] both hid from the Lord but um we know we
[1:27:36] know men are supposed to be leaders they
[1:27:37] supposed to be bold but when they fall
[1:27:39] short many times they just hide there so
[1:27:41] they don't tell anybody but the Lord
[1:27:43] sees all of it and he'll help us to
[1:27:44] overcome it okay Psalms 325 I
[1:27:47] acknowledge my sin unto thee and my
[1:27:49] iniquity have I not hid I said I will
[1:27:53] confess my transgression unto the Lord
[1:27:55] and thou forgave us the iniquity of my
[1:27:56] sin Saya praise God so Adam hid the sin
[1:28:02] but David said I think this yeah this is
[1:28:04] David but David said I didn't hide my
[1:28:06] sin glory and if we're Christians we
[1:28:09] shouldn't hide our
[1:28:10] sins a woman needs honesty and
[1:28:14] openness brother B said if there's
[1:28:16] anything that's a hindrance to
[1:28:17] Christianity Today is the way that Pro
[1:28:20] professed Christians live
[1:28:23] dishonest dishonorable and living any
[1:28:25] way don't do that we are Christians
[1:28:28] don't say nothing but what's the truth
[1:28:30] then you can always tell the truth every
[1:28:31] time and God will honor the
[1:28:34] truth he says she's not a door man but
[1:28:37] you should sit down and talk to her and
[1:28:38] reason with her and tell her and read
[1:28:40] the Bible and pray
[1:28:42] together see she needs someone who's
[1:28:44] honest and
[1:28:45] open won't hide things from his wife now
[1:28:48] there's a there's a secret there's a
[1:28:49] certain line there my wife and I talk
[1:28:50] about it from time to time Jesus said
[1:28:52] don't let your right hand know what your
[1:28:53] left hand's doing so there's times where
[1:28:56] I've given to PE given things away
[1:28:58] whatever more and not told my wife and
[1:28:59] then you know it's kind of hurt her
[1:29:00] feeling sometimes but I say well honey
[1:29:03] I'm just trying to follow what the Lord
[1:29:04] said but I'm trying to learn how to do
[1:29:07] that though because my wife sometimes
[1:29:08] likes to know about that so I'm just
[1:29:10] praying and ask the Lord to leave me I
[1:29:11] don't have the absolute answer on that I
[1:29:13] don't think every time I have to tell my
[1:29:14] wife or I should have to tell my wife
[1:29:16] and it's not that my wife wants to know
[1:29:17] every time I'm just saying well that's
[1:29:19] one thing we've always wondered about if
[1:29:21] you don't let your right hand know what
[1:29:22] your left hand's doing how does that
[1:29:23] work with
[1:29:24] marriage the wife don't sometimes like
[1:29:27] to be surprised or you know uh kind of
[1:29:30] some surprised I'll just say it like
[1:29:31] that
[1:29:34] okay look what brother says about
[1:29:36] mothers she'd appreciate you a whole lot
[1:29:38] more if you just sit down and talk with
[1:29:40] her just a little bit and write her a
[1:29:42] line Pat her on the shoulder kiss her on
[1:29:44] the cheek mother's like that okay tell
[1:29:46] her you love her it'll go a lot farther
[1:29:48] than all the flowers you could buy from
[1:29:51] the Florest
[1:29:52] now this is uh openness and honesty
[1:29:55] here's what I like the most God's great
[1:29:57] mystery what the Eternal God had as a
[1:29:59] mystery has now been unfolded in Jesus
[1:30:01] Christ and given right down to his
[1:30:03] church Jesus listen making love to the
[1:30:05] church's bride Whispering secrets to her
[1:30:08] has he ever whispered a secret to you
[1:30:11] his will or his word or his Revelation
[1:30:13] yeah and now he types this to a married
[1:30:16] couple Jesus Whispering secrets to the
[1:30:19] bride is like a husband Whispering
[1:30:20] secrets to his wife you know how you
[1:30:22] tell your wife things you know the
[1:30:24] little girl you're going to marry you
[1:30:26] love her so much you just tell her the
[1:30:27] secrets and get her up next to you and
[1:30:30] you love and love you and everything you
[1:30:32] know how it is you know how it is he
[1:30:35] said that's that's what God Christ is
[1:30:37] doing to the church he's letting her to
[1:30:40] know the secrets just the secrets not
[1:30:42] these flirters amen we don't flirt with
[1:30:45] the world we're just true to Christ amen
[1:30:48] I mean his wife see you know now look by
[1:30:50] having the revelation of a secret May
[1:30:52] known to them by his grace how the grace
[1:30:54] of God but the secret that God is
[1:30:56] sharing with the whole church if they
[1:30:58] would just receive
[1:31:01] it now let me read this Christians are
[1:31:04] called to have the mind of Christ how
[1:31:05] many know that this is an anti type of a
[1:31:08] marriage relationship as the wife needs
[1:31:11] to know the mind of her head her husband
[1:31:14] the husband must be open and honest with
[1:31:15] his plans for their life as they Heirs
[1:31:18] of the grace of life
[1:31:20] together that's why the said we're
[1:31:22] supposed to have the mind of Christ
[1:31:23] we're supposed to know what Christ wants
[1:31:25] well see it hurts a wife if the husband
[1:31:27] doesn't tell her what he's thinking and
[1:31:29] what she's doing because he is her head
[1:31:32] Christ is our head he tells us what he's
[1:31:34] doing so Brothers we should pray and get
[1:31:36] the leading from God and tell our wives
[1:31:38] what we feel led to do praise
[1:31:43] God oh my I don't know if I can finish
[1:31:46] this you sure are patient church here
[1:31:47] I'm trying to relax trying to finish
[1:31:49] notice there's nothing that God could
[1:31:50] give a man outside salvation better than
[1:31:52] wife now notice no person can console or
[1:31:54] confide when they're tired they won't
[1:31:56] confide in anyone like they do their
[1:31:59] wife I've read this one before I don't
[1:32:01] know I'm going to Define it she can do
[1:32:04] more with you than anybody else he said
[1:32:06] the greatest thing God give man out of
[1:32:07] Salvation was wife she was to comfort
[1:32:09] him to help him bless him and console
[1:32:12] him and be a real companion to him so
[1:32:14] what do these mean what's console wives
[1:32:17] are we doing this and husbands will we
[1:32:19] let will we let our wives do this wives
[1:32:21] Soul means to alleviate alleviate the
[1:32:23] grief and sense of loss or trouble or
[1:32:26] Comfort why should comfort their
[1:32:28] husbands when they're
[1:32:29] down and men should be able to confide
[1:32:32] in their wives brother brandom said
[1:32:34] imparting secrets that's what brother
[1:32:35] brandom said that Christ is doing to the
[1:32:37] church amen does everybody like
[1:32:41] that wives should comfort their husbands
[1:32:43] then H husbands should confide their
[1:32:46] secrets in their
[1:32:47] wives because they are the head of the
[1:32:50] wife
[1:32:53] this is scriptural because when Isaac's
[1:32:55] mother died he was comforted after his
[1:32:58] mother's death through the
[1:33:00] fellowship of his wife Rebecca so when
[1:33:04] Isaac loved Rebecca he was comforted or
[1:33:05] consoled by
[1:33:07] her all right let's stand to our feet
[1:33:09] I'm going to close with this husband has
[1:33:10] a
[1:33:11] shield I'm just going to go through this
[1:33:13] quickly
[1:33:17] here husbands are a shield those are the
[1:33:19] five things she needs now different
[1:33:21] women have different ones which is the
[1:33:23] top one and that's what I want we that's
[1:33:24] what I want to do next time when I'm
[1:33:25] here preaching on a Sunday I want to
[1:33:27] have you sit down and maybe we'll do as
[1:33:29] part of a service or something like that
[1:33:30] or maybe make the PM service I want you
[1:33:32] to sit there and talk to your whis
[1:33:33] Whisper back and forth to your husband
[1:33:35] and wife and say which one is the most
[1:33:36] important for you which one is the mo
[1:33:39] how can I love you better and we need to
[1:33:41] do that by God's grace if we're going to
[1:33:43] have Christ in the home we got to have
[1:33:45] love in the home got to have strong
[1:33:47] homes and you have a strong Church by
[1:33:49] God's
[1:33:50] grace
[1:33:52] so a husband has a
[1:33:54] shield let me read this quote here but
[1:33:56] bam
[1:34:02] says okay man said this I'm sorry it's
[1:34:05] so small please don't try to read that
[1:34:06] that it's really going to hurt your eyes
[1:34:08] okay this is we have seen this star now
[1:34:10] he found out right away he married her
[1:34:12] Joseph he was no more question then he
[1:34:15] took to marry the wife and knew her not
[1:34:17] as a wife until that child happy about
[1:34:20] it he was glad to be Mary
[1:34:22] Shield he was glad to Bear her reproach
[1:34:26] so he was a shield to his wife when a
[1:34:29] man can be revealed that Jesus Christ is
[1:34:31] the same yesterday today and forever no
[1:34:33] matter how many Creeds try to turn it
[1:34:35] back you're glad to be a shield you're
[1:34:37] happy to be a shield let them say
[1:34:39] whatever you got a big Shield up there
[1:34:41] to knock off the fiery
[1:34:43] darts amen does everybody see how he did
[1:34:46] that yeah all the reproach was coming on
[1:34:49] Mary Mary you're you're a forn care to
[1:34:51] marry or this or that and the husband
[1:34:53] stood right there and said no she's not
[1:34:55] and he stood right there as a
[1:34:57] shield I'm going to protect my wife from
[1:35:00] all these evil darts now look what I
[1:35:02] this is what the book says when he loves
[1:35:05] when he loves her with Christ's love
[1:35:07] he's protecting her from The Temptations
[1:35:09] reproaches that Satan constantly throws
[1:35:12] at women now sisters I'm taking this
[1:35:14] from the book do you constantly wonder
[1:35:16] if you're pretty or not for your
[1:35:17] husbands do you constantly wonder that
[1:35:19] this is what they said 99% of women have
[1:35:22] struggle with these these thoughts am I
[1:35:24] pretty so Satan's throwing fiery darts
[1:35:27] you're not pretty enough you're not
[1:35:29] pretty
[1:35:30] though does he really love me and
[1:35:33] there's a dart oh he doesn't love you he
[1:35:36] doesn't love you he married you but now
[1:35:38] he doesn't love you he doesn't love you
[1:35:39] like he used to these are darts being
[1:35:41] fired at your wives
[1:35:43] husbands is my marriage secure that's a
[1:35:46] dart shooting it at him all the time I
[1:35:49] don't know if my marriage is secure is
[1:35:51] it on the rocks or what's going on this
[1:35:53] is a dart that Satan Fires at
[1:35:57] couples especially women I'm sorry
[1:36:00] should I go back to worldly clothes or
[1:36:01] go back to makeup or am I not pretty
[1:36:03] enough or all these temptations that
[1:36:04] they're struggle with even single women
[1:36:07] even married women is that right
[1:36:09] sisters that's
[1:36:11] right and you think well they ought to
[1:36:13] be stronger well they're just as strong
[1:36:15] as you are when you have your mind
[1:36:17] battles amen Brothers you fight mind
[1:36:20] battles too Brothers
[1:36:22] they're a weaker vessel of course but
[1:36:24] they're still human and they still get
[1:36:26] attack and Satan Works harder on the
[1:36:28] woman than he does on the
[1:36:31] man and the church said
[1:36:34] amen you're not
[1:36:37] praying and Satan can you imagine Satan
[1:36:39] standing back there gets up there pulls
[1:36:41] back releases all these darts on your
[1:36:43] wife all day long and then when the
[1:36:45] husband walks in he don't even want to
[1:36:46] talk with his wife and don't even want
[1:36:48] to hug her or give her a kiss or
[1:36:49] anything like that and all day long
[1:36:51] maybe maybe that's a really hard day and
[1:36:52] she's battling am I pretty enough does
[1:36:54] he really love me is my marriage secure
[1:36:56] should I go back into the world would it
[1:36:58] be better to go out of the world some
[1:36:59] kind of evil relationship or something
[1:37:01] like this and but if the man's anointed
[1:37:04] to the Holy Ghost he can be a shield for
[1:37:06] her
[1:37:07] amen he can walk in the door and be a
[1:37:10] hero Brothers Hallelujah he can walk in
[1:37:13] the door and be a gallant boyfriend
[1:37:15] again that's what we need in this hour
[1:37:17] church we need men that are LED of the
[1:37:20] Holy Spirit and brothers if you don't
[1:37:22] believe me ask your wife ask your wife
[1:37:24] on the drive home
[1:37:27] today they battle these things sisters
[1:37:30] battle these things and it takes a man
[1:37:32] who's LED of the Holy Ghost to realize
[1:37:34] god build her that way and God has
[1:37:36] anointed me to meet her needs and I'm
[1:37:39] going to stand there I'm going to block
[1:37:40] all the darts and say honey you are
[1:37:41] beautiful we're not judging your beauty
[1:37:43] by the devil's standards a bunch of
[1:37:45] painted bed Jezebels that are bound for
[1:37:47] hell that have no help no even hope to
[1:37:49] go to heaven or something like that
[1:37:50] we're not judging Beauty by that we're
[1:37:52] judging Beauty by the character of
[1:37:54] Christ and by the word of God amen amen
[1:37:57] and he stands there as a shield and he
[1:37:59] takes that D in and it blocks it from
[1:38:01] her say You're beautiful honey don't pay
[1:38:03] attention to what they say amen and yes
[1:38:06] honey I love you with all my heart
[1:38:07] sometimes I get distracted by work and
[1:38:09] sometimes I get distracted by these
[1:38:10] problems in the church and things like
[1:38:12] that but I love you with all my heart
[1:38:14] and I'll tell you about it more God
[1:38:16] helps me to do that and you got to stand
[1:38:18] there and say you are loved you are
[1:38:20] beautiful you are the woman for me
[1:38:21] you're the one God gave me you're the
[1:38:23] best thing God gave me outside of

[1:38:32] need God's help to help me Express a
[1:38:34] little more amen and if you'll be
[1:38:36] patient with me if you'll pray for me

[1:38:41] give me a few reminders from time to
[1:38:43] time on how I can love you better and so
[1:38:46] now she'll give me ideas on what to get

[1:38:57] reproach of our sisters honey those
[1:39:00] worldly clothes all there all that
[1:39:01] that's just all the devil don't worry
[1:39:03] about that you just keep hiding you you
[1:39:05] you just protect the beauty God gave you
[1:39:06] hide it behind those modest garments
[1:39:08] because modesty is a Bible command and
[1:39:10] you'll surely go to heaven if you can if
[1:39:12] you can keep your life lined up with the
[1:39:14] word of God Amen God God thinks so
[1:39:17] highly of you you're his daughter
[1:39:19] conduct yourself like a daughter

[1:39:30] important needs of a couple let's bow
[1:39:31] our heads
[1:39:34] here praise God I got no musicians so
[1:39:38] I'm just going to talk with you a little
[1:39:39] bit this is an extremely personal topic
[1:39:42] I know that and church please I don't
[1:39:46] I'm not upset with any brothers I'm not
[1:39:48] upset with any sisters I'm trying to
[1:39:50] preach the word word and I'm trying to
[1:39:52] bring it in the in the power that it's
[1:39:54] given as I study and pray and seek God
[1:39:58] I'm trying to bring it in that
[1:40:01] way and church we don't expect overnight
[1:40:04] changes but we got to have an open heart
[1:40:06] to change now on either side how many
[1:40:10] would raise your hand and say brother
[1:40:11] just pray for me to be a better husband
[1:40:12] or a better wife help me to meet the
[1:40:15] needs of my spouse God bless those hands
[1:40:18] God bless those hands church it's it's
[1:40:20] it's reality let you can put your hands
[1:40:22] down now let me pray for you it has to
[1:40:24] be a reality it has to be where you wake
[1:40:26] up in the morning you got to start
[1:40:28] investing time into it you got to invest
[1:40:29] prayer into it you got to repent of the
[1:40:31] wrongs you've done if you haven't been
[1:40:33] committed to your family you got to
[1:40:34] repent to that if you haven't been
[1:40:36] affectionate you got to repent of that
[1:40:38] repentance is always the way back like
[1:40:40] brother man said I cut you real deep but
[1:40:42] there's some Bal and gilad this morning
[1:40:44] there's some there's some healing amen
[1:40:46] through what
[1:40:48] repentance and sisters I'll say like
[1:40:50] this some Brothers aren't ready to go
[1:40:51] into this yet so if not you got to pray
[1:40:54] and ask God to forgive them and give
[1:40:56] them Grace until they're ready to do it
[1:40:58] so let's pray together Heavenly Father
[1:41:01] Lord thank you for topics like this Lord
[1:41:03] I truly believe that with all my heart I
[1:41:05] believe you revealed that to me one day
[1:41:08] when I was studying on family I believe
[1:41:09] it dropped down in my heart from heaven
[1:41:12] where you said how is a marriage going
[1:41:14] to make it in the Rapture to the
[1:41:15] spiritual marriage if the natural
[1:41:17] marriages are not lined up with my word
[1:41:21] I believe you drop that down into my
[1:41:23] heart I believe that with all my heart
[1:41:25] because I see it all over the scripture
[1:41:27] I see it all through brother ROM's
[1:41:28] quotes all through his
[1:41:31] sermons we know brother brandom seemed
[1:41:33] to have his own little disagreements he
[1:41:35] said in his marriage Lord as we all
[1:41:38] do but Lord we're here today we're here
[1:41:40] in the now we're here trying to live
[1:41:43] right now in
[1:41:44] 2016 and we're trying to be better
[1:41:46] examples Lord you saw the hands that
[1:41:48] were raised Lord I pray for first for
[1:41:51] the husbands we'd have Gallant men here
[1:41:53] dear God we would have Gallant uh
[1:41:56] husbands dear Lord I pray that they
[1:41:59] would see themselves as a
[1:42:00] shield they can block the fiery darts of
[1:42:04] Satan that Satan shoots at their wives
[1:42:06] if they stand in the Gap and tell their
[1:42:09] wives you're beautiful I love you I love
[1:42:13] our marriage you're the best thing ever
[1:42:14] happened to me outside of Salvation God
[1:42:17] gave you to me I cherish you I honor you
[1:42:20] I will love you better help our brothers
[1:42:23] if they've made mistakes to say forgive
[1:42:25] me honey I made a mistake I'm going to
[1:42:28] try better pray with me pray for me that
[1:42:30] I'll do better next time I'll get the
[1:42:32] victory pray that God changed my
[1:42:35] character and my habits and my
[1:42:37] thinking that I take heed to my spirit
[1:42:40] forgive me if I've dealt treacherously
[1:42:42] with you and Lord give our sister
[1:42:44] special
[1:42:46] strength Lord if husbands aren't ready
[1:42:48] to go into this these type of things yet
[1:42:50] give them strike to be patient and wait
[1:42:52] upon you dear Lord that's that's
[1:42:54] extremely hard
[1:42:55] [Music]
[1:42:57] Lord Lord as our sisters lord they're
[1:43:00] the ones that battle
[1:43:02] insecurities Lord may you bring security
[1:43:05] to them may you bring Blessed Assurance
[1:43:07] to our sisters this morning may as as as
[1:43:11] the Holy Spirit would would you bring
[1:43:12] Brothers courage would you bring
[1:43:14] Brothers uh the anointing dear God to
[1:43:17] love will you give them a selfless
[1:43:19] service attitude dear God we don't want
[1:43:22] to play pretend message church and act
[1:43:25] like everything's right at church if
[1:43:27] things are not right at
[1:43:28] home we want to act the same way at home
[1:43:31] as we do church because we know there's
[1:43:33] creative power we want to create such an
[1:43:36] atmosphere in the home Lord God where
