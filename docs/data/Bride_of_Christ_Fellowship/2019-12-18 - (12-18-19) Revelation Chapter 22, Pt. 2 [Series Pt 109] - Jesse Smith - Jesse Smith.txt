series tonight revelation 22 verse 1 revelation 22 1 prairies God I was preparing I was look my notes and I was like why I could move on but I just feel led to continue these thoughts here looking at the final chapter of the Bible praise God final chapter of the Bible think about what words as we looked at last son or last Wednesday night what words would you leave if you had a choice about your last words and this is what the Holy Spirit left us with praise God so revelation 22 verse 1 and he showed me a pure river of water of life clear as crystal proceeding out of the throne of God and of the lamb in the midst of the street of it and on either side of the river was there the tree of life which bare twelve manner of fruits and yielded her fruit every month and the leaves of the trees tree were for the healing of the nation now notice it always says one tree doesn't say multiple trees it says one tree verse three and there shall be no curse no more curse rather but the throne of God and of the lamb shall be in it and his servants shall serve him a lot of people we'll look at this a little bit tonight a lot of people say what will we do for all eternity brother Jess well here's part of it we're gonna serve Him praise God if we're gonna serve him and he must have things he wants done praise God he wants us to find our job and do our job and he's gonna pack I was are you gonna give us orders that he wants us to pack out praise God I'll say like this we'll be happy to serve Him over there because we're serving him right here praise God let's read verse four together if we can let's blow up first for there okay so let's read that together on three one two three and they shall see his face and his name shall be in their foreheads let's have a word of Prayer here as we bow our heads here you haven't eaten your heart just making known unto God we know he's faithful he's merciful he visits on Sunday morning just like he knows on Wednesday night praise God because he's with us he never leaves us nor forsakes us Heavenly Father we love you tonight Lord it's a privilege to be in your house it's better to be in this Court than a thousand elsewhere Lord God this day Lord were so happy Lord and we thank you and give you praise transform our our minds Lord transform our thinking by the renewing of the Holy Spirit here tonight let us set our affections on things above Lord we're so blessed to be able to read this book of Revelation father just call them every heart Lord God let us Lord as we say rest our hearts and minds from all the cares of the day and may we care about you here tonight Lord God may we set all of our cares and refocus all of our cares on you may we cast our cares upon you for you care for us and Lord may we look to the things spiritual dear God here tonight we love you Lord take this scripture anoint it to our hearts dear God and father will be happy to receive your word Lord God and serve you as we see Lord we'll be serving you for eternity and Lord it's our pleasure to serve you now in Jesus Christ's name and the church said amen god bless you being seated praise God so I want to continue here tonight and look at this here just pulling up a real quick thought here by God's grace I forgot to look for that one so let's look revelation 22 and I would deal with this a little bit further here by God's grace I like to point out a few things here as we look to this here it's a real blessing this chapter isn't it just to see how God chooses to end this book what a beautiful ending he gives it to us last week and just briefly I'll just remind us of a few things here that we looked at how we're so blessed to be able to hear the word and not just hear it but to keep the Word of God and we saw how this house or this this we'd say house a future home I had a spearmint house we'll only have those that love the Lord they're right because the Bible said those who do not love the Lord let him be cursed there'll be no unbelievers there for they're all curse and they're all done away with in the lake of fire and there'll be no Liars there the Bible specifically calls out that in verse 18 and 19 and not to add to or take away to the Word of God and Jesus said come quickly which could mean all so suddenly doesn't have to mean you know quickly but of course in God's eyes you know one day is as a thousand years with men so Jesus's words are true always right when he says quickly he means both timewise and also suddenly because he comes like a thief in the night we saw how it was a unveiling this whole book is an unveiling of God Almighty praise God the unveiling of Jesus Christ no doubt all that he is and all that he his plans and all that he is future plans so all that he was doing he has done and all that he will do its unveiling of all of his plans praise God what a pleasure to know that you're a part of his plans in the Blessed part of his plans praise God amen and he hides it from the wise and prudent reveals it unto babes praise God and then we saw his last words we saw Stephens last words Father forgive them and his last words looking up to heaven and god game of glitz a glimpse of the heavenly throne and his last words were about forgiveness in other words his last words were grace praise God amen God have grace and we know he had to have grace because Paul was standing right there of course he was Saul at the time but God had to have grace because there was a predestinated seed that would believe and that would hear the Word of God amen and Jesus gives those last notable words surely I come quickly praise God amen what a blessing praise the Lord now tonight I want to pick up on some more of these thoughts and pull them up here I want to look at this first thought here how we we're speaking about not adding to or taking away from the words of this book so it's a familiar passage here but revelation 22:18 for I testify on every man that heareth the words of the prophecy of this book If any man shall add unto these words God shall add unto Him the plagues that are written in this book and if any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy God shall take away his part out of the book of life and out of the holy city and from the things which are written in this book this is a course a very stern warning but we learn a good lesson here church that if we want to live eternally with Jesus Christ we learn the lesson that God's book of itself God's Bible is sufficient praise God we don't need anything added to it although like we said the church age book gives us more revelation on it it's necessarily needed for salvation right right the Word of God of itself is sufficient praise God for our earthly journey how many know that that God's Word is your absolute and that's all you need for this earthly journey praise God God gives us additional blessings as we said with the church age book and and the program sermons on paper praise God and I hope my books and as one of those blessings that people get amen but the Bible of itself is sufficient and so nothing should be added to it and then nothing should be taken away from it praise God now I was noticing here that Scofield cites the inspiration of this book he says his little note here on verse 19 If any man shall take away from the words of the book of this prophecy I want to read this to you what Scofield said I like it he said it's the summary is the testimony of the Bible to itself so the Bible acts as a testimony of itself and we realize that because no one Word of God will ever fail right heaven earth shall pass away but my word should never pass away but graham tells us the Bible interprets itself so if someone has a question about a common example as easy as father son Holy Ghost well although answer is not laid out in some other book the answers laid out in acts 2:38 praise God along with Acts chapter 8 in Acts chapter 10 where Peter said baptize them in the name of the Lord and then Acts chapter 19 where Paul buries them in the name of the Lord Jesus praise God and so the Bible doesn't need other books really to interpret itself the Bible interprets itself praise God and Scofield pulls up this thought I like it he said the writers of the Bible affirm where they speak of this subject at all that they speak by direct divine authority they invariably testify that the words and not the ideas nearly are inspired how many believe that that the words not just the ideas but the words are inspired amen that's why we stay with this King James Version praise God remember a few months ago and I was showing how I think it was a Sunday morning I preached on rightly dividing the word of God and I showed you how all these modern versions of the Bible come from different Scrolls right and they all come from different Scrolls but all the King James comes from the Texas Receptus the received text and it's very important that we into that the right that the translators interpret from the right scrolls praise God because the the other scrolls are missing words they're missing you know the second half of mark 16 they leave it out they don't even put it in there they leave out scriptures like first John 5:7 and so when they leave out a word then we know the Bible says they're under the judgment without mercy without repentance without forgiveness if those translators and those writers of the scrolls don't repent then we know that their part will be taken out of the holy city and the book of life hi what a what I what a job but forgive me what a job that would be Church what a job to translate the Word of God but now you say well that's a great and I agree that's a great job but it's a great responsibility to translate it not on paper but in flesh amen in other words you and I have to be the translation of the Bible in flesh amen right because my dad said some people will never go to church but they'll see your life and you are the Bible to them praise God hey man let me turn this silly thing off here I got to put it on airplane mode that's because I'm going in airplane mode right now up to heaven hey Emily place is rather Amen so see it's a this idea where the Bible interprets itself and the words themselves are inspired I'll give me another example but bad boy says the word Trinity is not in the Bible because it wasn't a wasn't a word that God thought was inspired to use for the Godhead amen it wasn't it was coined by Tertullian right Tertullian coined it you know about two hundred years after John now you can balance that out because Road Ram said Trinity means three and one but as long as you say Trinity of manifestations or Trinity of offices you can use it but it's not really an inspired word that we would use right whereas the Bible you know uses the Bible says in Philippians two that he changed his form and brother and said look at that word form he came in the form of a servant Jesus speaking of and program said what's that Greek word and morphe see God chose that word that Jesus had more faith into flesh and that more fame means to change his mask or change his physical appearance that's a word that God chose God didn't choose he he sent the second person down God chose the word that he changed his mask and him he came down himself a head he came down himself hallelujah sees the Bible's inspired and it vindicates itself praise God that's why banan said when the seals were broke to him when he saw the visions he'd spend the rest of the day going back in the concordance and running it down and makes sure the revelations he saw from the Angels lined up with God's Word because Paul said though we are an angel he said it cannot be changed if any change in an angel man let him be cursed he said let every he said try every spirit and make sure we prove all things that everything lines up with the word of God glory thank the Lord so I found that important to make sure that brother Ram when he when he brought the message he didn't have to add anything outside the Bible now he said God could do that if God wanted he could do things outside the Bible he said but it's safer to just stay in the Bible praise God and God will say in the Bible praise the Lord until when brother a we don't need it anymore in the in the millennium where we need to Bible anymore probably not because we have glorified bodies hey then the Bible says death will be swallowed up in the immortal life praise God will have immortal life immortal bodies praise God bodies that cannot make a mistake hallelujah bodies that can't be tempted bodies that can't fall will have such a such a nature about us will be fully partakers of the divine nature praise God amen my glory beautiful God's Word is beautiful hallelujah so we see that God interprets is so weird so what I'm trying to say with this main thought with Revelation is that to interpret the Bible walls you have to do is look other places in the Bible which were familiar with that now I want to read this motor Arabs are not program but Scofield says the most important passage is first Corinthians 2:7 2:15 which he said which you should see so let's read that briefly this go keep your spot there we'll come back to revelation 22 well first Corinthians 2:7 2:15 and I looked at this text I thought this would be a good text to read first Corinthians to seven but we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery even the hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory now I used to feel pretty bad when people and newcomers would come to our church and they'll act like they didn't know what I was talking about I used to feel bad but I don't feel bad anymore praise God because the Bible says when we speak God's wisdom it's a mystery to those that don't book that don't understand it that's why I appreciate brother Samuel I was thinking about that you know when we first come into message my wife and I said when we first came he was preaching so high with a lot of things we didn't understand but the Bible truth is this that if you're a child of God you will sense that truth is being preached praise God and if you can't receive the meat then there surely be milk for you as well praise God amen amen praise God so when you're a believer you even if you can't take the meat you want to eat it praise God but it might not be ready for it but see I don't feel bad anymore if people don't understand it will I explain it afterwards of course if they want me to explain it from my Bible I'll be happy to explain it or if they want a deeper Bible study I'll be happy to do that but the reality of it is is that when we speak the Word of God if they're not hungry for the word of God then they won't be able to eat the Word of God if they're not thirsty then they won't want to drink of it praise God it's in a mystery hallelujah because it's hidden wisdom which God ordained before the world unto our glory it's hidden wisdom like people will laugh and the laugh at the women that don't wear makeup anymore right the laugh at the men that won't wear shorts anymore it doesn't watch dirty movies anymore I won't a gamble or cheat or steal anymore but they don't realize that that's the hidden wisdom of God amen and I just don't understand that they they think oh you know who cares it's no big deal cultures change and all these things that's true cultures change but God's heavenly culture will never change amen in other words heaven the will of heaven must come down to earth praise God hallelujah so it's hidden if they really wanted to know they could know but an answer they don't pray enough right they don't see God enough he said they don't dig down in the spirit of Revelation enough verse eight which none of the princes of this world knew for had they known it they would not have crucified the Lord of glory if the if the princes would have known that crucifying Christ would have unleashed a new army of Christians they would not have done it if they knew it would have unleashed the lion of the tribe of Judah praise God the Living Christ upon the earth if they knew that it would have brought a living Savior to send this holy spirit into the hearts of men and the preach righteousness and love righteousness and spread righteousness they would not have done it praise God amen but they didn't know so God hid it and he hid it in one small verse remember when I preached out a few years ago Jesus resurrection was hid in one verse now others other scriptures referenced it right like the rod that got its life back you know in the holiest of holies but that one scripture was in Psalm 16 where he said I will not suffer my Holy One to see corruption amen and it was hiding out there brother ray for a thousand years before the resurrection of Jesus Christ and Satan just looked it over in other words of the the Prince of the world just looked it over they thought Oh once we kill him he's dead but they didn't understand the hidden wisdom of God the wisdom of God that though my my son dies as a lamb he whose body won't see corruption because I'm gonna raise it up amen oh my thank the Lord they didn't catch that as smart as they were as great buildings as they had is great money and wealth that they had they couldn't catch the hidden wisdom of God because they weren't interested in it they weren't interested in a righteousness they were selfish and interested in unrighteousness so God hid it from him but to us it's what we speak we speak the wisdom of God in a mystery amen hallelujah so I don't feel bad when people look at me and don't understand what I'm saying I don't feel bad I try to explain it to high heels to a couple gentlemen a few years ago and they just looked at me and said huh and they said when it went on and did something else they don't see that it's right there in Isaiah 3 that they went tinkling as they went and they walked forth with with a stretched out neck and and their tinkling as they go they don't I can't see it why because it's hidden from them because they don't want it so don't feel bad you just give the word and those that want the wisdom of God will receive the wisdom of God now here I better move fast now first night but as is written eye hath not seen ear if not heard neither have entered in the heart of man the things which God hath prepared for them that love him now this is true there are as good there's going to be so many great things in the future but if you look at the next verse this scripture is often taken out of context look at verse 10 but God hath revealed them unto us by his Spirit amen see we often say that in church I say it often - which it's partly true it's true you we can't even understand the things God has prepared for them that love us but the Bible says here he's revealed them to us by the Holy Spirit amen so what is what's one of those revelations the new body praise God a glorified body what's another one of those revelations the Millennium what's another one the future halt Bray's God is there revealed by the Holy Spirit for the spirit searches the deep things I'm sorry searches all things yea the deep things of God so let's keep that up there just for a minute see when message people when we receive the message we're so happy if we really get the holy spirit it won't be satisfied with the surface level understanding of the Bible you'll want to dig deeper in the things of God praise God you want to learn more about the Word of God you want to see the spirit guide you into all truth but it's rare Church it's rare you don't find many people that want to get closer to God you want to you see a lot of people that want to coast with God but you can't coast with God you either growing closer or you're leaving your first love praise God so this scripture is often misunderstood so the things that God has revealed to us are deep things and that's it's what is not and entered into the heart of man before but now it's entered into our hearts praise God verse 11 for what man knoweth the things of a man save the spirit of Man which is in him even so the things of God knoweth no man but the Spirit of God now we have received not the spirit of the world but the Spirit which is of God that we might know the things that are freely given to us of God praise God not so all these things that seven seals the church ages future home millennium by the rapture the shout voice Trump all these things they're freely given to us by the Holy Spirit and it's not just it's not just knowledge but it's a reality praise God you can't know these things as a man you got to know them through the Holy Spirit praise God they don't enter into the heart of just a man who's not born again you got to have the the mind of Christ amen and they then they enter in and they transform your life they transform your walk so that you're living prepared for that day praise God you're preparing for that City amen freely given so Church of they're freely given what do you got to do just have to ask who he's got to come to church he's got to go our prayer cause they got I want more revelation I want more of the deep things of God and he said I'll freely give them to you amen verse 13 which things also we speak not in the words which man's wisdom teaches but which the Holy Ghost teacheth comparing spiritual things with spiritual so not carnal things but spiritual things right like with the M morph a will go back to that example the Godhead you compare a spiritual thing with the spiritual thing so you have the Godhead you compare that with a more faith you don't bring something that's not spiritual right like a three leaf clover you know like that like they do you don't bring like an egg that now they say that tourneys like an egg you know shell and the white stuff and then though the yolk three separate things you know they try to do it like that but the Bible says gotta be spiritual lessons with spiritual lessons amen in other words scripture upon Scripture line upon line here a little there a little praise God Isaiah 28 verse 14 but the natural man receiveth not the things of the Spirit of God for their foolishness unto him neither can he know them because they are spiritually discerned but he that is spiritual judgeth all things yet he himself is judged of no man for who hath known the mind of the Lord that he may instruct him but we have the mind of Christ so getting back to this thought Scofield picked up this thought and he goes to show how the Bible interprets itself so that's why the Bible ends by saying if anybody adds or anybody takes away your curse because the Bible of itself is sufficient to give you revelation it'll take you in the deeper things of God amen because you compare spiritually compare revelation you know with Isaiah or you can be compared Jeremiah with Hebrews you know you compare those things and look at verse 15 again he that spiritual judges all things yeah but what about Jesus he said judge not lest ye be judged so you gotta balance it out and what that means is that we don't judge and condemn people to hell and we don't judge their eternal destination but we judge every thought because the Bible said try every spirit that's how we judge we judge all things because remember jesus said if you hate your brother without a cause you're guilty of murder right so that's why we don't judge people's final destination right or because we don't know unless God would say it you know with us saith the Lord which that don't happen at all very very much at all so he says a spiritual man judges all things yet he himself is judged of no man that's why we should judge the music we listen to we should judge what we read praise God we should judge our conversations we should judge with that person saying to us we should judge the text messages we used to judge the YouTube videos we should judge what we see on Facebook or Instagram we're always judging it as saying is that right or wrong is that pleasing to God or not that's when we know we're spiritual you be you'll be surprised how how quickly people just accept something or laugh at it or joke about it and they're being very carnal raise god they're not even thinking about what they're what they're saying you'd be surprised so you must judge all things because when you judge all things you are judged of no man see cuz you're judging yourself so see before somebody bring up an accusation well brother Jesse you should have said that you've already confessed and say God forgive me I didn't mean to say that because he judged it right you judged your own life praise God you examine your own life making sure you're in the faith praise God now let me read this from the church age book well Graham said in the Ephesus church age and I'm sorry not Ephesus yeah what happens to church age they had to try the Apostles that said they were apostles but were liars and wrote and said how did they try them he said Galatians 1:8 but though we are an angel of heaven preach any other gospel unto you than that which we have already preached unto you let him be cursed he said that was the Apostles who brought the original word to the people that original word could not change not even a dot or dash of it No praise God Paul knew it was God who had spoken him and said even if I come and try to give a second revelation try to one little change what I gave originally let him be accursed Paul knew the first revelation was correct God can't give a first revelation and then a second revelation if he did he'd be changing his mind but he can give a revelation and then add to it as he did in the Garden of Eden when he promised the seed of that woman and then later designated that seed had come through Abraham and then later said had to come to sit through the same bloodlines and David it was the same revelation it only gave the people more information to help them receive and understand it amen hallelujah I hope you caught that church you we can't change one thing Paul said did the book of Revelation change anything Paul said no it only added to it praise God and that's what we see today we are not to change anything but if the spirit searches deep things it's going to give us more information about the same revelations we've always believed yes and that's why the move in Jefferson Bill's wrong because they can't change one thing Paul ever said Paul never said Timothy sit down and shut up and just read my epistles he never said that and so when they change the church whether they know it or not they're bringing themselves under at least a temporary curse because to change one word of it is to become a temporary curse at least and we've got to be careful we've got to watch our lives not to change one bit of it praise God but I love how he says you can give more information on the same revelation praise God that's beautiful and he said they these Ephesians were full of the Holy Ghost by the laying on of Paul's hands they lift those false apostles in the eye and said you are not saying what Paul said you there are you are therefore false I like that praise God we must always be saying what Paul said right brother Adams group would look out and they'd say we're resting on what brother Ram said because brother Ram was resting on what Paul said amen program said the seven church age Messenger will be in the word exactly as God gave it to Paul he won't deviate from that word for a moment not by one iota amen so children that's why we got to read them New Testament right that's why we got to know Paul's gospel Paul's epistles if we know them then we will be unable to be deceived because Paul said if you change anything you're cursed right and then the Bible ends by saying if you add to the book or take away from it you get the plagues or your name out of the book and you can't enter the city oh how important it is if we want to be a part of that city to live by the book of that city praise God hallelujah so I've been ordered to read that because it goes right along with this idea at the end of Revelation now let me get the revelation 20:2 let's go back there by God's grace and since I'm on that thought go to revelation 22:16 now in revelation 22:16 I've heard now because I subscribed to some of the people from Jeffersonville they now at least some of the followers now attach revelation 22:16 to brother Rams ministry just like they attached revelation 10 7 Malachi 4 5 6 Luke 17:30 one of the men I watch he's he goes to Ram tabernacle there he now says he says all those scriptures and he says revelation 22:16 and the reason he says that is because his pastor preached that this angel is brother Branham and that these churches are taped churches because I've heard it I have the recording that's what the recording says I got it you want to listen to it let me know I'll make your CD of it so now they say I Jesus have sent mine angel brother bran to testify unto you these the in the churches now this is the angel if you read him verse 8 that John fell down and was almost worshiping right but he says no I know that fellow servant of our brethren the prophets and of them which keep the sayings of this book worship God so now they've added something to the message that's the not end the message and this angel cannot be brother branham for this reason because brother Aaron tells us the order of the manifestation of us and let me read this from who is this Melchizedek program said you will never be the word unless you were a thought at the beginning that proves the predestination of God you can't be the word unless you're a thought you had to be in the thinking but in order to stand temptation you had to bypass the theophany you had to come down here in flesh to be tempted by sin and then if you stand all that the father has given me will come to me and I'll raise him up at the last day see you had to be first how many are standing on God's Word tonight you got to stand the test you guys and this is the test case you leave that up there honey yeah this is a test are we going to say make this brother random or not we've got to stand on with the revealed word of this hour because the word cannot change one iota as it came to Paul so program says you start out as a thought or another word as attribute then you bypass the theophany so thought you skip the theophany you come to flesh he said but before the foundation world his name is put on the Lamb's Book of Life then from that he become the word the theophany that could appear disappear then he become flesh and returned back again resurrect the same body in a glorified condition but you bypassed that theophany and became a flash man to be tempted by sin and then if this earthly Tabernacle is dissolved you have one already waiting we have not yet the bodies praise of the heart amen so did you catch it this cannot be brother branham because John had this vision in 80 90 95 let me know that and for John to be able to see brother Branham if this was brother Ram brother Branham would have already had to bend his theophany you catch yet but he wasn't yet his theophany he was still a thought in the mind of God because the orders you go from thought you bypass the theophany to flesh then after flesh you die you go to theophany and that the rapture you go to glorified body condition hey man there it is right there so the very teaching of the Branham Tabernacle goes against what brother Ram taught this cannot be brother Ram because you can't appear in theophany before flesh only Jesus could do that praise God so this is that brother branham now you and I can make as many guesses as we want but it can't be somebody that lived so that had it live yet it had been someone that already lived and was now entered in theophany Amen I don't hear you praise God because we come from thought down to flesh and then we go to theophany and come back and get the glorified body amen i with me so what do we see again now we see the same people adding to the message that they say they believe or they so cherish and they say every word is thus saith the Lord but yea they transgressed the word so don't let that be Church don't let that be a confusion program is not that angel we don't know who that angel is you're welcome to your guests just as much as I'm welcome to my guests and specifically if you've read the church age book by the way you know this but have been specifically said he didn't agree with the doctrine of the pre-existence of souls amen he said that's a Mormon doctrine the Mormons believe you pre-exists in heaven you're just like you know a spiritual body theophany in heaven waiting to go down to earth no but I've said I'm against the pre-existence doctrine so now it shows what spirits on them they got a false prophet spirit on them because a frost prophet wrote that doctrine Joseph Smith oh my Milan struck me there I'm a better way to say that later see they got they got the Mormon spirit on them and that's the spirit following a false prophet I hope you caught that I just said something there without saying it oh my mercy God have mercy ah they picked up a false doctrine and they got what's like a pump telling them wind and pray render read that Bob was a wooden what to listen to it exactly what to do they got somebody ordering them around what to do church we must try and test every spirit and take every teaching back to the Word of God if not will become like Catholics who become like Mormons because it proves right there they got a Mormon doctrine they have the pre-existence of souls that's what that verse is brother Ram pre existed before he came down in flesh nonsense he didn't believe that and he preached it even in the the what was the fish see oh yeah he'll because it was the souls under the altar amen glory he said this vision disproves the pre-existence of souls the vision a program had praise God he said the revelation of this seal of efficacy of Prayer that those souls are alive amen he says not so sleeping it's not pre existence of souls praise God those souls are alive there under the altar praise God crying out how long O Lord this teaching was right nah that's good praise God thank you lord now I want to remind you Church that that we have so much thus saith the Lord on Revelation brother Branham says about Revelation at the end of the seventh seal sermon program records a special ending and he says the visions of the seventh seal which were the seven angels visions as well and then the visions he received in March of 63 ye preached the seals he says the visions press + the word + the church ages he said plus the other one he said it's all he said the interpretation thereof is thus saith the Lord so whether that means Revelation chapter one two and three are thus say I'm sorry n 6 are thus saith the Lord we got the interpretations for those chapters Amen everybody says you can't understand the seals without understanding the church ages first aim ahead because you got to go in the order to the church ages then the seals then the trumpets and the vials amen oh god I'm feeling good here tonight praise God amen we've got lost saith the Lord on Revelation one two three and six and maybe probably eight - because that's the seventh seal and then Church I believe also we have thus saith the Lord on revelation 13 and 17 because brother Ram said thus saith the Lord world rules at the end time amen and who is that beast out of the sea that was rolled and that same beefs got new life in the beast out of the land which Simon preached on Sunday is the United States of America it's the Roman Catholic Church in the United States of America so we've got thus saith the Lord on three four five six at revelation seventeen seven chapters we have a literal not saith the Lord oh we have nothing to fear the cover has been taken off how do I say it the blankets been taken off the statue praise God we see Revelation clearly it's been unveiled Amen hallelujah I wanted you to see that and that's why church brother branham can make that statement in 1961 and they asked him our Trinitarian save he said yes he said but the time has come where the God tell him the truth he said trinitarianism is son of the devil thus saith the Lord he says so now that means that revelation one that Jesus can't be a second person he's got to be the one person of God Amen cuz we got thus saith the Lord amen and it lines up with the word and the word interprets it praise God so when you have the Bible says you have you have God sitting on the throne and then the sons the son steps forward and takes the book out of the hand of him that South wrote that doesn't mean a young man takes it from an old man it means from out of the spiritual out of the osha category men out of the pillar of fire i that comes forth the Lamb of God the man hallelujah the further revelation of God it's the same person just the visible image of God Amen hallelujah of that rainbow Rowell Shekinah glory that they're eternal oh that miserable little Gus out of that sets forth to live and he comes and takes the book not out of our physical right hand but out of the authority the right hand of power praise God a man because it's this saith the Lord because you never see any other picture of two gods and one on this road and I know their God standing in front of the bow so there's only one throne not three through one through because the Bible interprets itself amen and we've got thus saith the Lord to agree with us praise God we don't add to the word we don't take it away we just believe what it says amen amen see that's the glory church I say like this that's the security sister Beatrice of having thus saith the Lord we I can't explain every scripture brother I can't do it but I've got the assurance and I got the security that when that prophet said they'll save the Lord it was right amen it is going to come to pass you can rest your soul on that because he said it before and it comes to pass right and so if he says it again we know it's arrived and we might shake a little bit get nervous until we know the answer but we just stay with God with all of our questions to him and in due season God gives the answer amen praise God why cuz we got thus saith the Lord on it yeah not to worry about that we got I love I love the end of the second seal brother Branham says he said that's the second seal that's interpretation thereof everybody gets real quiet and then all of a sudden he screams out that's dust saith the Lord anybody go Saturday rejoicing and praising God and he said if all these other visions come to pass so is this the second seal is dust saith the Lord now what kind of preacher you ever heard do that I haven't seen a one of them praise God they haven't men since the days of st. Paul st. Paul can write that letter and said I write this I speak to you in the name of the Lord amen that's what he wrote to those tests alone and icons amen he said this I speak to you by the Word of God he said don't flip over your loved ones he said because they're not dead he said but you'll see the dead in Christ rise first amen there will come a shout a voice and a Trump he said comfort one another with these words because I tell you the word of the Lord amen hallelujah that's why I want to write a book on Revelation and then gonna be this one but Lord willing will be or whatever that because Church if we've got the say delay then surely we can piece together the rest of the chapters in there if we've got the Holy Spirit because it it digs deeper into the things of God right we just read it tonight the spirit won't shy away but the spirit searches the spirit wants you to go reading your bible little more praise God the spirit wants you to search it every time I do that brother ray I get a blessing every time I listen to another sermon every time I try a little bit more to get closer to God some will strike me all that's right I didn't understand that oh I hear a brother preach something I just learned from the Lord I thought oh my there's a series of second indication he meant there's another indication that God is getting me into the deep things of God into all truth amen it was a show he keeps his word he's a rewarder of them that diligently seek Him praise God that's the power of thus saith the Lord amen thank the Lord now let me here try to go into some other things here because I want to get these thoughts down let me I think I can just finish it here tonight because there's not these aren't too long here I would like to be able to finish here okay go back to Revelation 20 to look at this I saw this little thought I was listen to a preacher I thought there's a good thought in revelation 22 one two and three God is mentioned and the lamb is mentioned so where's the holy spirit the Holy Spirit is the River of Life Jesus said when you get the holy spirit it will flow out of you like living waters of living to walk life they met so here we see at the very height at the very top of the pyramid we see God the lamb and the water these three bear record on earth right right the water blood and spirit father word Holy Ghost the three bear record and these three are one ha ha the father is invisible right the father is invisible so how is he visible through the lamb praise God so you have the father they're God's invisible you have the lamb which the father created the body of the land to dwell in then you got the Holy Spirit the waters flowing down there you say that should have stumble your church no on the day of Pentecost the Holy Ghost was in a hundred 20 different manifestations does that mean he's 120 different persons that's what eternity Aaron would told you right well well see a Jesus baptism the oh there's a voice of the Dove and a body so three persons nonsense if that's true then the Holy Spirit is 120 different persons oh mine there's more than that because he was speaking the box of the spirit spoke they spoke as the Spirit gave them utterance amen Mary so Peter James and John and man weren't speaking their words all right they were speaking the spirits words amen it was God's voice it was the voice of God to those seventeen nations that were trying to hear worship and they were actually hearing the voice of God in my glory so just because it says God lamb water doesn't mean they're three it means God wants to manifest himself in these attributes for eternity because God is incomplete unless he manifests himself in his three attributes praise God just like you you're not manifested completely unless your body soul and spirit yet because God is perfected in threes right his design is perfect in three parts so we see at the top of the pyramid we see the Father Son Holy Ghost we see these three and these three are one not three one look at these go to the last verse revelation 22:20 one key point up there acacia thank you hon revelation 22:20 one remember what were Stephens last words Father forgive them was it judgment or grace grace how does this book end Church the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all amen how does the Old Testament end and he shall turn the heart of the father's to the children and the hearts of the children of their fathers lest I come and smite the earth with a curse it ends with God sending Elijah or else there's going to be a curse right and that's the scripture we know is for the Gentiles right so the Old Testament ends with a warning of a curse I've got to send Elijah or also it's going to be a curse but the New Testament ends with grace amen even so he says the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ me with you all amen you notice that's how Paul ends most of his letters he said the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you praise God how many one God's grace with them like Stephens last words weren't judgmental God slay them send those soup receive IPERS to hell wasn't that he said Father forgive them they don't know what they're doing the same thing Jesus said amen grace the Bible said let your words be seasoned with grace oh my what lesson do we get here let's end everything with grace now not giving people a pass for sin but interceding for them and asking God to help them and help them forgive right help them repents they can be forgiven but oh it's okay for my dad to smoke it's okay for my mom to commit adultery no it's not okay but we should say God have mercy on them that they can repent of that and go to heaven our last words should be grace Jesus last words we saw were surely I come quickly Jesus is begging people to quench that holy thirst he's preaching to the soul of man and he's saying all every soul freely choose to come Church do not let anyone beg you to come to church do not any let anyone persuade you to come to church or convince you if you're a real believer no one has to beg you to do anything because it's the Holy Spirit not begging you it's the Holy Spirit guiding you praise God it's the Holy Spirit leading you praise the Lord amen if someone's got to beg you or push you that's no better than a lot the Angels had to pull him out of Sodom right they had to pull them out and say come on hurry up it's time to go I don't want somebody to pull me to church I almost somebody didn't pull me to prayer closet I want God to guide me there amen I want God to shine the light and guide me show me the way and Jesus gets to the spot at the end and he says you've heard this word and he said anyway who wants to come let him come because he says surely I come quickly praise God he ends this book not by begging but just saying come if you want to come and be a part of the future home he says come because I'm coming quickly you need him back anybody he said don't add to it don't take it away he said I'm coming quickly the words this Bible is he said it before this Bible interprets itself and Jesus said this Bible is enough to be a witness either for you or against you god help us to be that list will be a witness for our lives amen that we heard the things that were preaching it and we lived it and we made ready for Christ's coming beautiful beautiful invitation from Jesus oh my so what we'll be doing in the heaven Church we get some ideas here in Revelation 7 you see the Gentile bride two times brother Branham calls it the bride one time he calls it bruised virgin I believe it's the bride because he says it in the sense in the future home I believe and also the church age book revelation 7 you see the Saints now the first half is 144,000 but the last half verses 9 to 17 is the Gentile bride and they're crying with a loud voice saying salvation to our God which sitteth on the throne revelation 7 10 and verse 11 and all the Angels stood right about the throne and about the elders of the four beasts and fell before the throne on their faces and worship God amen so what are we going to do in heaven part of its going to be worship and search not just us but the angels are going to work something oh yeah the beasts are gonna worship the 24 elders praise God yeah Mao Kai Lydia will be waving poems like that the Bible said we waving our palms amen it'll be the greatest worship service you've ever been a part of don't miss it thanks God amen well amantha to the Gentiles to be praising God worshipping and their voices will join the angels and bless God for his salvation oh that's glorious what the Bible say we're gonna meet the Saints in Matthew 8:11 let me read that we're gonna have time to meet the Saints we're gonna sit down with the Saints the Bible says Matthew 8:11 and I say unto you that many shall come from the east and the west and shall sit down with who Abraham and Isaac and Jacob in the kingdom of heaven but the children of the kingdom shall be cast out into outer darkness and there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth remember that was not the Jews the Jews will be kicked out those that rejected Christ and the Gentiles will come and sit down can you imagine sitting down there by Abraham say hey buddy tell me what was that like what was it like the body change tell me about that and he'll be able to explain like this but then he'll say tell me about your body change when you were in the rapture so what we have a lot in common hey man I'm seen of ham great we're family praise God he knows about the natural body change and we know about the spiritual into the natural eternal body change a man glory and we both had a body change to receive the son ha ha yeah I'll sit down by your buddy let's talk about the body change what was that like my I just walked into it one day and time Oh Jesse I just took God at His Word I'm a man of faith that's the same thing I did allowed to see you praise God I said one day at a time I kept the word I charged my family I charged my servants to keep God's Word obey the Word of God and become a mighty army in order for the body change that happen hey man what we can do and have we're going to sit down by Abraham and haven't talked about the body change how about Jacob what was the like rest of that angel oh brother let me tell you first he had headlock they took out my leg and then he was pulling me up and I'll be like I know what that's like Ida Russell when I got the Holy Ghost I wrestled for a man I wrestled this day together I wrestled that day together I kept going back and finally one man funny one day I got a real change amen Laurie I had a new look I got a new name mrs. Lord Jesus Christ ah Oh got a lot more in common what we thought praise God we're gonna sit I'm gonna sit right down by them praise God not that I deserve it but because God ordained it praise God God predestinated the Jews turned him down so he slides the Gentiles in and they'll sit right by Abraham Isaac and Jacob what are you in heaven we're gonna worship we're gonna sing we're gonna meet the saints we're gonna ask Jesus questions because he said the reward the overcomer is the hidden manna and Beau Graham said that's asking him questions throughout all eternity can you imagine I mean it will ask me a question I'll say let me pray about it but there oh there but there we don't get we're not gonna ask somebody and wonder what give me a few minutes so I can answer this and wonder I wonder if they're giving me you might wonder I'm just Jessie given me the right scripture or not or no church with Jesus we're gonna ask him and we'll see him and we'll know we're getting not just an idea we're getting the full revelation of God praise God he'll give us that hidden manna that we didn't see before my goodness what else will the Bible said will reign over nations and have the same Dominion like Adam had the Bible said if you rule if you're faithful with 10 talents you'll be fate you'll rule over 10 cities no no how that's going to be well we'll probably be live in the city there with Christ and maybe we'll take a little chariot ride out there maybe just like a body change ride like a translation will move like a thought you know we'll go out there to our constituents and we'll tell them you know because remember there's gonna be no buildings maybe and we'll be like we'll be rulers over them and the Bible said reigning over them and telling them what to do we'll be like a thought maybe right back to the our mansion praise God our room for the Lord see it's Dominion its ruling it's raining and serving God's purpose so God will have a purpose that you were to serve his purpose in that place in that New Jerusalem will be really busy in heaven praise God oh my we're gonna see Nations by the Ray healed you imagine all the war in the Middle East but one day there's gonna be no war in the Middle East you have actually real believers that are Arabs right different nations and there'll be no more wars between them just peace we'll see that we'll see nations heal people that will can you imagine a perfect civilization where there's no envy no bitterness there's no starvation there's no disease no cancer not and we just see we'll watch and see us everything is healed everything comes back to perfect perfection and if we're faithful Christians will reign over it they shall reign with him the Bible says nations will be healed kings and priests will reign close of this this future home is the New Eden right programs to the third purpose of God's mystery was to bring him back to Eden but this Eden is way better than the first Eden there is a river in Genesis there was those three rivers in Genesis but here we only need one River the River of Life raised God in the first Eden there was a tree of life and a tree of knowledge good evil but in the last eaten there's no tree of knowledge of good and evil there's no more evil because there's no curse amen hallelujah and church this is a big tree of life I don't know how big it wasn't the first unit but now it's massive God's tree has now grown and it's so big it's on both sides of a river Oh God if it is a physical tree right it may be just a mouth of Christ's presence but they had one little there one small tree Christ presence but now it's massive tree not two trees what's down to one tree Satan entered the first one but the Bible said no evil thing will enter this holy city praise God he could enter the first he didn't but he's not entering the last Eden praise God the first Eden was a garden the last Eden is a city I think the first eater was one family the laughs Eden is old gods family amen it's a multitude of family members Amen it's the better Eden praise God glory it's the magnified Eden it's like the first Eden but multiplied and made greater there was in there in the first Eton there's only day in the last season because the light of Jesus lights the whole thing his face lights the whole thing the Bob said there be no night there Jesus will never have to come and say good night brother Jesse it's time to go to bed like you did with Adam and Eve good night Adam and Eve but there there's no night because there'll be no darkness there'll be no curse it'll always be light it always been pure tea holiness amen no need for rest because our bodies are eternally empowered with energy amen holy energy praise the Lord their beam was like this let me close to this and church the best part of all this I believe in verse 4 and they shall see his face I kind of mentioned that earlier oh right now sister Beatrice the Bible said we see duck ly through a glass kind of like our car windows right they get all foggy before we scrape them off that's kind of like how it is right now we're trying to do e we see this you know really but really that's just like seeing through a glass darkly that's just like a window that needs washed off right right now we see as a glass darkly but Paul says but when perfection comes we'll see face to face praise God and John says we let's read first John 3:2 real quick first John 3:2 I turned right to it praise the Lord that saves a little bit of time beloved now we are the sons of God and it does not yet appear what we shall be but we know that when he shall appear we shall be like him for we will see him as he is amen glory what a blessing so to me church the spark is like what Peter said Peter said whom you haven't seen yet you love and Jesus said blessed is he that hasn't seen yet still believes amen glory so the best way for us is that we will finally see what we believe this whole time and we'll see him in all this beauty it was blue and it was holiness and we won't see him like the backside of a man like Moses saw but he'll turn his back and we'll see his face amen hallelujah amen Moses only got this is my praise God but we're good to see his face thank you Jesus praise God let's say to our feet like that song says turn your eyes upon Jesus look full in his wonderful face right now we're just trying I wanted to be what'll be like and the Bible said it doesn't yet appear what it'll be like but when we see him we'll have a body like unto his glorious body amen hallelujah what was his body like brother Ray it could eat fish and bread after the resurrection but it could also walk through a wall I can't do that yet but maybe one day I will what else could is mind you it could just rise up you could ascend to heaven in a cloud I wonder if our bodies will be able to do the same whatever he is if we let him know when we see him we'll be just like him so to me that will be the highlight of revelation 22 see revelation is 22 is the last chapter of the Bible but it's the first chapter of our new life amen hey this is the hope of the Saints children come up here here whoa after seeing this vision of 22 chapters what were John's last words he said even so Lord Jesus come quickly the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you I hope after these 109 sermons I hope your desire is like my desire I hope we all have the same desire that we just want to see Jesus return amen yes we want to see our children I want to see them live out their lives but really I really want to see him come back raised God let's see him come and give us the reward of eternal life of a glorified body and that we can be called his children his sovereign say men that we could have the pleasure the joy of serving him eternally and never have to leave his side praise God what a joy John saw the church ages he saw the horse riders ride he saw the veils and the destruction and the vials and the trumpets but the last thing he sees is Jesus on the throne the lamb the father and the water and all I can think of to say is surely come quickly Lord God come quickly please don't delay it much longer it's certainly getting darker this world but for the Christian it's becoming more bright because we're starting to get closer to see this face praise God [Music] we long to see his face because there will be the end of death will be the end of Tears be the end of cancer the end of lust the end of fear the end of selfishness the end of temptation the understated the of demons the end of everything sinful it'll be the beginning of a new chapter with Christ oh yeah so the end of this is just the beginning for us John says quickly Lord he was completely bring this new city bring this home where no one ever has to cry anymore please bring this city clean off this earth get rid of the rancid gonna have so right now the skies of contaminated with demons because Satan is the Prince and power of the air God looks dying in this whole places contaminated evil everywhere but when Jesus comes he's gonna clean it off with his blood amen praise God he's gonna clean off a fire amen holy fire he give us a fresh start this life will have no end I can't get off the coast road Madison he said we'll spend five hundred years he said just walking around investigating mountains what he said he and brother Humes he said we'll go for 500 years then I'll come back and see some sisters her like hey I just seems like I seen a few years ago and she say no it was about 1 million years ago that we saw you so just there be no end we no end to the joy I'll just keep getting greater and greater and greater let's have a word of Prayer here have any father the one thing to me longer than the highlight of this entire thing this climactic chapter Lord is that we get to see your face [Music] Lord I think now the face that was spit on this face that was slapped by that high priest they thought he blaspheme that he did it Oh God the face that had to be kissed by Judas's betrayal kiss Oh God baba it was the same face that went to Peter and said do you love me hallelujah same face that freely forgave a failing servant the same face that went to Thomas said do you not believe now that you've seen the news to my heads the nail prints my video I believe the same very thing that same
